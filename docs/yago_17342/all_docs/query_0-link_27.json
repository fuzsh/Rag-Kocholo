Cinema Italiano is the story of that world.\n\nI\n\nn its heyday – beginning in the late 1950s and lasting for over 20 years – Italy was second only to Hollywood as a popular film factory, exporting cinematic dreams worldwide. Italian filmmakers, backed by international finance and fielding multinational casts, crafted dramas, horror films, westerns, spy movies, sword and sandal epics, costume adventures, war movies, crime films, science fiction, political thrillers and comedies with equal gusto and in inimitable style. Many of these films became great international successes, but the cliché of Italian cinema is that it predominantly fed oﬀ other movies, adopting found ideas, plots and actors, and making whole genres its own. A common criticism of Italian genre filmmakers is that their films are not as good as the Hollywood films they imitate, when in many cases they are actually superior to the ‘genuine article’. Cinema Italiano discuses both Italian ‘popular’ and ‘arthouse’ cinema. Mythological sword and sandal epics, gothic horrors, sci-fi, crime films and spaghetti westerns are analysed alongside the best of Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Some of the films discussed in this book are internationally famous, even infamous, while others are forgotten gems. I’ve sought to demonstrate that the work of world cinema heavyweights – Fellini et al. – has much in common with popularist filmmakers such as Sergio Leone and Dario Argento. In this respect, I’ve tried to treat everyone equally, from Pier Paolo Pasolini to Gianfranco Parolini, and from The Leopard to Puma Man. The story of Italian cinema is essentially a series of creative explosions, interspersed with fallow periods of audience exhaustion. If a film was popular, literally dozens of imitations would be made to cash-in at the domestic and international box oﬃce. This intense technique often resulted in each fad enjoying\n\nHughes_Prelims.indd ix\n\n3/23/2011 12:03:05 PM\n\nx\n\nCinema Italiano\n\nStarlet Sylvia Rank (Anita Ekberg) and companion in Federico Fellini’s once-scandalous La dolce vita (1960).

Only the most talented directors, the biggest stars or the most imaginative gimmicks prevailed. Mythological muscleman films starring Steve Reeves as Hercules became the first Italian popular genre to enjoy widespread international success. This craze lasted from 1958 to 1964. It was superseded by Italian ‘spaghetti’ westerns, which took oﬀ in 1965 – with the massive success of Sergio Leone’s ‘Dollars’ films starring Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name – and lasted until 1970 when comedy, horror-thrillers [gialli] and crime films [poliziotteschi] coaxed audiences to pastures new. Gothic horror, Hammer-style, was popular in Italy from 1960 to 1965 and the James Bond movies inspired a spy cycle from 1963 to 1967. Within each of these frantic cycles there were many imaginative hybrid crossovers, which brought out the best in the fevered imaginations of Italian filmmakers. One trend is obvious: Italian genre cinema is obsessed with caped crusading superheroes. Even the most mercenary of Italian supermen are on the side of ‘good’, helping the exploited, downtrodden and victimised. It’s no coincidence that everyone – from Hercules to The Man With No Name – wears a cape. During most of these genre explosions, primary influence came from elsewhere. Time and again big international hits, regardless of their country of origin, were copied by Italian filmmakers – gothic horrors and Bondian espionage are good examples, both being inspired by already established formulas. Mythological epics, spaghetti westerns and gialli were reboots of classic Hollywood film genres. The trigger films in each case – Hercules (1958), A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1969) – are quite unlike their Hollywood counterparts. As soon as films and genres became hits, they also became targets for ridicule. Italian clown Totò parodied La dolce vita (1960) in Sergio Corbucci’s Totò, Peppino and la dolce vita (1960), and Franchi and Ingrassia’s goofy stockin-trade were movie spoofs. Each of the chapters of Cinema Italiano maps out how various Italian genres rose, prospered and played out and analyses each cycle’s most interesting, influential and financially successful examples, with plot resumes and cast, location, production and release details. During the boom years of the 1960s and early 1970s, Italian film studios exceeded even Hollywood’s film output. For example, there were 242 Italian films made in 1962, compared to 174 in the US; 245 Italian films to 168 American in 1966; and 237 productions to 156 in 1974. The Italian’s cinematic assembly line – based in studios such as Rome’s Cinecittà, Titanus, Dinocittà, Incir-De Paolis and Elios – churned out everything from sumptuous international epics to low-budget potboilers and action movies. In addition to Italy’s own output, from 1957 to 1967 US companies spent approximately $35 million per year to finance or buy the distribution rights to Italian films, or to make their own films, with Italian studios as their production base. This enabled US filmmakers to take advantage of the Mediterranean weather and picturesque filming locations in Italy, Spain, North Africa and the former Yugoslavia. Often European casts and crews adopted anglicised pseudonyms to deceive audiences both at home and abroad. Films were\n\nHughes_Prelims.indd xi\n\n3/16/2011 8:06:41 PM\n\nxii\n\nCinema Italiano\n\nUS double-bill poster for Michael Reeves’ The She Beast (1965 – starring Barbara Steele) and Dino Tavella’s The Embalmer (1965).

In the Italian versions of the film, the Italian director would be credited, while the international version would trumpet the Hollywood ‘name’. US companies’ investments often took the form of co-productions with Italian partners, though French, West German, Spanish or Yugoslavian financiers also participated in such ventures. Stars from these countries were cast, in an eﬀort to appeal to as broad a market as possible, with poster billing altered accordingly for diﬀerent markets. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Italy had a rich crop of home-grown stars, with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni pre-eminent among them. Popular Italian stars who broke through internationally – and sometimes appeared in Hollywood films – included Gina Lollobrigida, Claudia Cardinale, Mario Girotti/‘Terence Hill’, Silvana Mangano, Alida Valli, Monica Vitti and Franco Nero. But with American money came American stars. These included some genuine Hollywood legends – Burt Lancaster (The Leopard, Moses and 1900), Orson Welles (David and Goliath, The Tartars and Tepepa) and Henry Fonda (Once Upon a Time in the West, My Name Is Nobody and Tentacles) – but usually meant supporting players, lesser stars and minor celebrities such as Henry Silva, Charles Bronson, Steve Reeves, Guy Madison and Jack Palance. Italian cinema aﬀorded them star billing, fan adoration and lucrative careers as box oﬃce draws in Europe. Cameron Mitchell is a good example: a stage actor and minor Hollywood star, he travelled to Italy in 1961 to headline in a brace of Viking movies and never looked back. Several stars forgotten by Hollywood – such as Broderick Crawford, Joseph Cotton, Stewart Granger and Alan Ladd – enjoyed rejuvenated careers in Italy. Their Italian films were then truncated and dubbed for US and UK audiences and often released as ersatz Hollywood productions. There were several British performers – bodybuilding champion Reg Park, Wirral-born actress Barbara Steele and thespian Edmund Purdom – who became famous in Italy, and Italian cinema created a global superstar in Clint Eastwood (an American TV actor who became an overnight sensation in Italian westerns). In his Psychotronic Video Guide, a comprehensive roundup of the best in world, cult and exploitation cinema, Michael J. Weldon compiled a list of the ten most prolific ‘psychotronic movie directors’. It is headed by Spaniard Jesus ‘Jess’ Franco and includes such luminaries as Al Adamson, Fred Olen Ray, William ‘One Shot’ Beaudine and Jim Wynorski. Weldon notes that the list ‘does not include Italians or serial directors’. Italy has produced more cult genres and movies than any other country in the world. During the writing of Cinema Italiano I collated a ‘Top 20’ of essential Italian films which in my view no collection should be without: La dolce vita (Fellini, 1960), The Mask of Satan (Bava, 1960), Hercules Conquers Atlantis (Cottafavi, 1961), The Horrible Secret of Dr Hichcock (Freda, 1962), The Leopard (Visconti, 1963), Contempt (Godard, 1963), The Gospel according to St Matthew (Pasolini, 1964), Castle of Blood\n\nHughes_Prelims.indd xiii\n\n3/23/2011 12:03:07 PM\n\nxiv\n\nCinema Italiano (Margheriti, 1964), Fists in the Pocket (Bellocchio, 1965), Battle of Algiers (Pontecorvo, 1966), Blowup (Antonioni, 1966), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Leone, 1966), The Big Silence (Corbucci, 1967), Diabolik (Bava, 1968), The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (Argento, 1970), The Conformist (Bertolucci, 1970), Violent City (Sollima, 1970), The Marseilles Connection (Castellari, 1973), Illustrious Corpses (Rosi, 1975), Suspiria (Argento, 1977) I also compiled a further list of o eat items. Some of these are perhaps less known than the previous titles and feature the work of journeymen directors who ploughed many furrows. The films’ subject matter includes four-armed space mutants, coﬃn-dragging gunfighters, hardened criminals, Greek myths, reanimated flesh-eating zombies, secret agents, giant octopi, orgiastic Roman decadence, World War II action, gothic horror, slapstick comedy, incompetent superheroes, horror-muscleman epics and the world’s first (and last) spaghetti western hero to be pitted against the Moors and the Vikings: The Trojan War (Ferroni, 1961), Maciste in Hell (Freda, 1962), Sons of Thunder (Tessari, 1962), Blood and Black Lace (Bava, 1964), The Castle of the Living Dead (Kiefer, 1964), The Last Man on Earth (Salkow/Ragona, 1964), The Wild, Wild Planet (Margheriti, 1966), Django (Corbucci, 1966), Special Mission Lady Chaplin (De Martino, 1966), Django, Kill! (If You Live Shoot!) (Questi, 1967), Fellini Satyricon (Fellini, 1969), They Call Me Trinity (Barboni, 1970), Milan Calibre 9 (Di Leo, 1972), Deep Red (Argento, 1975), Get Mean (Baldi, 1976), Tentacles (Assonitis, 1976), The Inglorious Bastards (Castellari, 1977), Zombie Flesh Eaters (Fulci, 1979), Puma Man (De Martino, 1980), 1990: The Bronx Warriors (Castellari, 1982). In my opinion, the archetypal Italian cult film would be directed by Enzo G. Castellari, Antonio Margheriti or Sergio Corbucci and would star Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, Klaus Kinski or Jack Palance. It would feature at least one bottle of J&B (Justerini & Brooks) whisky – the tipple of choice in Italian cinema – would have a score by Ennio Morricone or the De Angelis brothers and have been shot in a quarry in Lazio. Today such movies have been reclaimed by the cultists. It was once possible to encounter these films by accident on TV, often in the late-night schedule, but if you want to see most of the movies discussed in this book, you will have to buy or rent them. With the boom in DVD collecting worldwide, the best of this cinema has never been more accessible and popular. Many of these films are now available in pristine DVD editions – where were all these flawless, uncut, widescreen prints in the 1980s and 1990s, when collectors often had to make do with grainy, truncated, jumpy, faded, cropped and ‘panned-and-scanned’ releases? There will be films in this book you would have seen. There will be films you would want to see and even films you may never want to see. My only hope is that Cinema Italiano ignites or re-ignites your passion for this fantastic cinema.

Making these epics was partly a way of utilising sets and costumes from Hollywood productions – including Quo Vadis (1951) and Helen of Troy (1955) – which had been filmed at Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Christened ‘Hollywood on the Tiber’, Cinecittà was a vast studio complex opened by Mussolini in 1937. Italian productions capitalised on the vogue for ancient spectacles (‘Big Screens Mean Big Themes’ went the publicity for Helen) by taking an already popular genre – the sword and sandal epic – and making it their own. Such films were christened ‘peplum’ (plural ‘pepla’) by French critics after the Greek word ‘peplos’, the name of the short skirts worn by the heroes. The most popular stars were Steve Reeves, Reg Park and Gordon Scott: muscly outdoor types whose sheer bulk and screen presence compensated for their thespian shortcomings. Several of these musclemen – including Mickey Hargitay, Reg Lewis, Gordon Mitchell and Dan Vadis – had been bodybuilders in Mae West’s risqué touring stage review in the US. There was also a phalanx of pseudonymous Italian musclemen – for example, stuntman Sergio Ciani became ‘Alan Steel’ and ex-gondolier Adriano Bellini was billed as ‘Kirk Morris’. They played heroes named Hercules, Goliath, Ursus, Samson and Maciste. Ursus and Maciste were unfamiliar to English-speaking audiences, so many of their adventures were dubbed into Hercules or Goliath vehicles. Embassy Pictures released several as the ‘Sons of Hercules’ series, with a rip-roaring ‘Sons of Hercules’ title song: ‘On land or on the sea, as long as there is need, they’ll be Sons of Hercules!’ If the truly ‘epic’ biblical epics of Hollywood director Cecil B. De Mille were famous for giving cinemagoers more than their money’s worth, then peplum audiences sometimes felt a little short-changed.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 1\n\n3/23/2011 12:00:42 PM\n\n2\n\nCinema Italiano The central theme of pepla is man’s freedom. Often an oppressive overlord is misruling with vigour, enslaving the populace. With help from the hero the slaves cast oﬀ the shackles of oppression, an act representing a symbolic image of freedom that was a genre signature. There is often a wily, morally bankrupt queen (who desires the hero) and a virtuous heroine (for him to save from danger). Recurrent elements include torture, tests of strength, a cataclysm (usually an earthquake) and at least one cabaret spot by a group of dancing girls as court entertainment, to eat up the running time. Sometimes the hero is lifted completely out of his mythological context – Hercules against the Sons of the Sun shipwrecks its hero in South America, Maciste in Hell is set in Scotland – but to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, it’s possible to believe anything provided it is incredible.\n\nHercules the Mighty The trigger film for these ‘bicepics’ was Pietro Francisci’s Hercules (1958), ‘freely adapted’ by Francisci from The Argonauts written by Appollonius of Rhodes in the third century BC. Francisci cast American Mr Universe winner Steve Reeves as Hercules opposite Yugoslavian starlet Sylva Koscina as Iole, King Pelias’ daughter. Francisci had already had success with Attila the Hun (1954), which paired Anthony Quinn and Sophia Loren. Immortal Hercules is summoned to the city of Iolcus in Thessaly by Pelias (Ivo Garrani) to teach his braggart heir Iphitus (Mimmo Palmera) the art of war. Iphitus is savaged to death by a lion while in Hercules’ care and the hero renounces his immortality. Jason (Fabrizio Mioni), the rightful heir to Pelias’s throne, is sent to retrieve the Golden Fleece from Colchis. On board the Argo, built by Argos (Aldo Fiorelli), Jason gathers the Argonauts – the musician Orpheus (Gino Mattera), the Dioscuri (twin heroes) Castor and Pollux (Fulvio Carrara and Willi Columbini), Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini) the son of Laertes (Andrea Fantasia), Tifi the pilot (Aldo Pini) and Hercules. Pelias’s henchman Eurystheus (Arturo Dominici) tags along to sabotage the trip. The questers are distracted on Lemnos, Island of the Women, where Jason falls for Antea, alluring Queen of the Amazons (Gianna Maria Canale). Later the Argonauts are ambushed by ape men in Colchis and Jason fights a dragon guarding the fleece, before returning to Iolcus to claim his throne. Hercules was shot in Eastmancolor and French widescreen process Dyaliscope and is accompanied by a score by Enzo Masetti. Musical highlights include the lush title theme; the jaunty ‘Athletes’ theme; a lusty sailors’ choir led by Orpheus; the theramin-led Sirens’ theme; and love themes for Hercules and Iole, and Jason and Antea. Lidia Alfonsi played oracle ‘the Sybil’ and future Bond girl Luciana Paluzzi was Iole’s handmaiden. Exterior footage was lensed at the Nature Reserve and beach at Tor Caldara, Anzio Cape, with palace interiors at Titanus Studios, Rome. Hercules’ farewell to Iole was filmed at the arching fountains in Rome’s EUR district; the athletes’ games, where Hercules humiliates Iphitus, were also staged in EUR. Mario Bava’s lighting and special eﬀects\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 2\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:38 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n3\n\nare impressive and there are some memorable settings: the volcanic Island of Lemnos (a tropical paradise of palm trees, parrots and cascading flowers) and the tiered waterfall at Monte Gelato in the Treja Valley, Lazio. Antea’s glittering grotto is festooned with stalactites, flowers (courtesy of Sgaravatti of Rome) and what appear to be strips of shimmering clingfilm. The Italian title (Le fatiche di Ercole) translates as ‘The Labours of Hercules’, though only two of the Twelve Labours feature: the strangling of the Nemean lion and the capture of the Cretan Bull (represented by a North American bison). Hercules was a colossal success, especially in the US in 1959 where it grossed $20 million when independent Boston producer Joseph E. Levine bought the US rights for $120,000 and spent $1.2 million on advertising, including the precedent-setting use of TV ads in what William Goldman called ‘the most aggressive campaign any film ever had’. Two diﬀerent English language dubs of the film exist: the UK print opens with the titles over a Greek frieze, while the US version substitutes an animated starfield and a superior dubbing track. Distributed by Warner Bros, Hercules was one of their biggest hits of the year. Levine formed Embassy Pictures (later Avco-Embassy) as a result of this success and was later the producer of the Oscar-winning The Graduate (1967) and The Lion in Winter (1968). Francisci’s sequel, Hercules Unchained (1959), was based on Oedipus at Colonus by Sophocles (a dramatisation of the last hours of King Oedipus), The Seven against Thebes by Aeschylus (recounting the Theban Wars) and The Legends of Hercules and Omphale, again ‘freely adapted’ by Francisci. Hercules and his wife Iole (Reeves and Koscina), with Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini), land in Attica, Hercules’ home, to find King Oedipus (Cesare Fantoni) at odds with his sons, Eteocles (Sergio Fantoni) and Polyneices (Mimmo Palmera). Oedipus has decreed that each will rule Thebes for a year, but Eteocles refuses to cede\n\nSteve Reeves flexes muscle in Pietro Francisci’s Hercules Unchained (1959), the first sequel to the phenomenally successful Hercules (1958).\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 3\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:38 PM\n\n4\n\nCinema Italiano power. Polyneices has laid siege to the city with his mercenary Argives. Francisci crowbarred Hercules into the story, casting him as a peace envoy. Hercules and Ulysses take a truce from Eteocles to Polyneices, but they are kidnapped en route by Lydian soldiers, who brainwash Hercules with ‘the waters of forgetfulness’. He becomes the love slave of Omphale (Sylvia Lopez), the Queen of Lydia. As Omphale tires of her lovers they are transformed into human statues by her Egyptian henchmen, in a steamy vitrification process. One critic noted, ‘Such a fate would have made little diﬀerence to Reeves’ performance’. Eventually a rescue party led by King Laertes frees Hercules, who rushes to Thebes where Iole is about to become tiger food in Eteocles’ arena. Hercules Unchained is superior to its predecessor, with tighter plotting, punchier action and superior acting. Carlo D’Angelo appeared as Theban high priest Creon, Daniele Vargas played an Argive general, Gianni Loti was Sandone (Captain of Omphale’s guard) and future peplum stars Alan Steel and Giuliano Gemma appeared as oﬃcers. Ballerina Colleen Bennet was the Lydian court dance soloist and Patrizia Della Rovere played Penelope, Ulysses’ girl. Iole, plucking Orpheus’s lyre (called a ‘lute’ in the slapdash dubbing) serenades Hercules by miming to June Valli’s ‘Evening Star’ (lyrics by Mitchell Parish), the melody of which was used as the root of the film’s title music. En route to Thebes Hercules fights Antaeus, the son of the earth goddess (played by world champion boxer and wrestler Primo Carnera, ‘The Ambling Alp’). The film’s impressive finale features a pitched battle as the Argives wheel their siege towers to the gates of Thebes. Hercules leads the Theban counter-attack across the plain in a fourhorse quadriga chariot, lassoing and toppling the Argive towers. Mario Bava was again in charge of lighting and eﬀects and the Dyaliscope cinematography in crisp Eastmancolor is a major asset. The sunny Italian exteriors – beaches, cliﬀs, valleys, cities and woodland – are amongst the finest in pepla. Exteriors were filmed in Lazio (including the coast at Tor Caldara and the Treja Valley), with interiors at Titanus Appia Studios. It is in the exotic landscape of Lydia where the production really scores. When Hercules drinks from a bewitched woodland spring, there’s a gnarly tree root shaped like a grotesque troll, with water pouring from its eye and the moss glistening magically. The Monte Gelato waterfall on the River Treja is bedecked with flowers for Hercules and Omphale’s tranquil idyll. During a scene between Hercules and Omphale in her grotto beneath a waterfall, the flowery backdrop changes colour as the seductive mood changes. Omphale, as played by French actress Sylvia Lopez, is a red-haired seductress. She sashays across the screen in a variety of diaphanous dresses and Ester Williams sequinned bathing suits, gossamer trailing in her wake, while Bava lushly bathes the sets in her radiated sensuality. Men, even the sons of gods such as Hercules, are hypnotised by her. Lopez’s portrayal of the doomed queen is movingly eﬀective, particularly in light of her death from leukaemia at the age of 28 in November 1959. Levine again bought the rights, distributing the film through Warner Bros in the US and the UK in 1960. It made\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 4\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:38 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n5\n\na fortune, through an intense TV advertising campaign which magnetised huge audiences into theatres. Francisci returned to the Hercules saga with Hercules, Samson and Ulysses (1963). In Ithaca, Hercules (Kirk Morris), Ulysses and crew embark on an expedition to kill the Great Sea Monster. They are shipwrecked in Judea where they become embroiled in the rebellion against the evil ruler, the Seran (Aldo Giuﬀre), who is battling his enemy Samson (Iloosh Khoshabe, billed as the more easily pronounceable ‘Richard Lloyd’). In one of the most violent scenes in pepla, the Seran orders the razing of a village which has been sheltering Samson, crucifying many of the locals to the walls of their houses. Such horror is dissipated by the Seran’s soldiers’ World War II-era German helmets. The finale, shot at the beach and headland at Tor Caldara (decked with fake palm trees), had Hercules and Samson joining forces to jack up the Temple of Dagon, which collapses and buries the Seran’s army. When Delilah (a deliciously duplicitous Liana Orfei) attempts to entice Hercules to bathe with her in the Monte Gelato waterfall, he politely refuses (‘Not today Delilah’) and Hercules and Samson evidently prefer each others oiled company. Samson is so lubricated he appears to have been lacquered. For their big fight, the pair hurl outsized cardboard boulders, columns and masonry at each other.\n\nMighty Feats: In the Footsteps of Hercules Between the release of Francisci’s first and last ‘Hercules’ movies, Italian pepla veered oﬀ in many directions. Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia’s The Loves of Hercules (1960 – Hercules Versus the Hydra) is told without pretension, attention to myth or logic. Hungarian bodybuilder and ex-Mr Universe Mickey Hargitay and his wife, busty Hollywood bombshell Jayne Mansfield, were cast as Hercules and Queen Deianara of Acalia. Hercules’ wife Megara and Deianara’s father Eurystheus are murdered by Lico (Massimo Serato) and his henchman Philoctetes (Andrea Aureli) who plan to usurp the throne of Acalia, while Hercules is falsely accused of killing Deianara’s lover, Achillos (Gil Vidal). Hercules slays the three-headed Hydra and falls under the spell of Amazon queen Hippolyta (Mansfield again), who transforms herself into the living image of Deianara. Escaping her domain, Hercules races back to the fortress of Acalia to lead the people in revolt against Lico. Mansfield made the film in Italy when Hollywood studios refused to cast her opposite Hargitay. She had to diet during its making to conceal the fact that she was pregnant with her second child, but still looked fabulous in voluminous, colourful costumes, her blonde hair hidden beneath a black or purple hairpiece (for Deianara) and a burnished red wig (for Hippolyta). Giulio Donnini and Andrea Scotti were Lico’s devious high priest and Hercules’ faithful shield-bearer Temanthus respectively. Accompanied by a majestic score by Carlo Innocenzi and shot in the Italian countryside (the impressive gates of Acalia were built beside the Monte Gelato falls) and amid vast Acalian city sets at\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 5\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:38 PM\n\n6\n\nCinema Italiano Cinecittà, Loves has several memorable action scenes. Hercules saves Deianara from a wild bull (which had to be tranquillised for the scene when Hargitay wrestles it) and also from Halcyone, a snaggletoothed ape. Hercules beheads the fire-breathing Lernean hydra (a puppet dragon) in a hokey scene which can be glimpsed in the 1968 mondo documentary The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (released after the actress’s death by decapitation in a car accident in 1967). Loves’s surreal surprise is Hippolyta’s ‘Forest of Death’, where men she has loved live on as wailing tree creatures. Eventually one of the damned exacts revenge and strangles the evil queen with its branches. This murky Valley of Tree Men, which contributes some of the movie’s least wooden acting, was constructed at Tor Caldara. Like Francisci’s Hercules, Riccardo Freda’s The Giants of Thessaly (1961) was inspired by the Golden Fleece saga. Set in 1250 BC, King Jason of Thessaly (Roland Carey) embarks on a quest to find the fleece – if he fails, the gods will destroy Iolcus with a volcanic eruption. Ziva Rodann played Jason’s wife Queen Creusa, Massimo Girotti was Orpheus and Luciano Marin was Eurystheus. Alberto Farnese was pointy-bearded despot Adrastes, who fancies Creusa (‘Her loveliness is ablaze in me like an open furnace’) and Raf Baldassarre plays Adrastes’ henchman Antius. The Argonauts land on an island of witches, ruled by Queen Gaia (Nadine Saunders), an enchantress who turns Jason’s crew into talking sheep. Gaia and Jason traverse a bubbling pool in a grotto on a floating throne, which resembles a peplum pedalo. The Argonauts save a city from a giant one-eyed gorilla (special eﬀects were by Carlo Rambaldi) and Jason scales a colossal statue to retrieve the fleece. Shot on interiors at Cinecittà and the Instituto Nazionale Luce, with exteriors on the steps of Palazzo Della Civilta, EUR, Rome (the storming of Iolcus’s palace), Giants builds to a splendid conclusion. As Adrastes is about to marry Creusa, the Argonauts burst forth from statues in great plumes of fire. Columbia Pictures’ version of the Golden Fleece saga, Jason and the Argonauts (1963), was lensed in picturesque locations in Campania, Italy, and at SAFA Studios in Rome. It featured Ray Harryhausen’s stop-motion special eﬀects in Dynamation 90 and Eastmancolor, with Nigel Green’s Hercules opposite Todd Armstrong’s Jason. Goliath was second only to Hercules in popularity in the US and Vittorio Cottafavi’s Goliath and the Dragon (1960) was one of the most successful examples. The Italian version (‘The Vengeance of Hercules’) was a sequel to Francisci’s Hercules films. Emilius the Mighty, the ‘Goliath of Thebes’ (Mark Forrest), descends into the Cave of Horrors to retrieve the Blood Diamond for the Goddess of Vengeance, battles Cerberus the three-headed fire-breathing hell-hound (a puppet) and then wrestles a giant bat (a man in a giant bat suit). Eurystheus the Tyrant (Broderick Crawford), the scar-faced King of Ocalia, wants to take over Thebes. He murders Goliath’s parents and imprisons Goliath’s brother, Ilus (Sandro Moretti). Eventually, the Sybil (Carla Calo) foretells that\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 6\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n7\n\nIlus will be King of Ocalia, but it will cost Goliath the life of his wife, Dejanira (Leonora Ruﬀo). Crawford is a fine villain, who dies in his own snake pit wresting a large rubber python. Gaby Andre appeared as evil Ismene, in league with Eurystheus’s advisor Tindar (Giancarlo Sbraglai). Wandisa Guida played slave Ancinoe, dispatched by Eurystheus to poison Goliath, and Federica Ranchi was Thea, Eurystheus’s daughter. Salvatore Furnari, as Goliath’s midget companion, was a peplum regular, working often with Cottafavi. Goliath wrestles a bear, prevents Ilus from being crushed by an elephant’s foot and tears down his own house when he realises he can’t enjoy a mortal’s life: ‘Collapse like my shattered dreams!’ he rages. Goliath enters the city’s underground caverns, smashing the stalactite support pillars, causing Ocalia to crumble. Dejanira is kidnapped by Polymorphus the Centaur (Claudio Undari), a less-than-convincing half man– half deer, though the spectacular setting for his arrival is the cascading Cascate Delle Marmore (Marmore Falls) in Umbria. Polymorphus escapes with Dejanira through billowing clouds of purple smoke. Goliath takes on the dragon, with stop-motion footage of the beast (animated by Jim Danforth) intercut with close-ups of Forest battling a puppet in the rock-hewn underground caverns at Grotte Di Salone, Lazio. The US release replaces Alexandre Derevitsky’s original score with new Les Baxter compositions. In Cottafavi’s Hercules Conquers Atlantis (1961) the portents foretell that Greece is to be destroyed by an unknown menace from across the sea. King Androcles of Thebes (Ettore Manni) leads an expedition, taking Hercules (British bodybuilding champion Reg Park) with him. They are shipwrecked on Atlantis, which is ruled by Queen Antinea (Fay Spain), who has created a race of invincible warriors. Antinea gains her power from the blood of the god Uranus, now cast as a rock hidden deep in the Mountain of the Dead – Hercules destroys the rock with a sunbeam, causing the destruction of Atlantis, and saves the known world. With lushly saturated cinematography by Carlo Carlini, in Technicolor and 70mm widescreen ‘Super Technirama’, Hercules Conquers Atlantis is one of the most visually sumptuous epics of the 1960s that holds its own with its Hollywood contemporaries. It was filmed in Italy at Tor Caldara (here a swirl of sulphurous yellow mist), in the cavernous Grotte Di Salone (used as Prophet Tresias’s underground temple and the bowels of Atlantis) and various limestone quarries and coastal beaches, with interior sets at Cinecittà. Androcles’s galley was constructed at Nettuno Naval Shipyard. The film’s settings and décor by Franco Lolli are at their best in the Atlantean production design. For the temple interior, a statue of Atlas strains under the weight of the vaulted ceiling, and the temple’s towering entrance doors dwarf even Hercules. Park, in his best role, plays Hercules as a lazybones, but when he’s roused his strength is unsurpassed, as he battles monsters and men in Thebes’ name. Park’s Hercules is wily: he spits out the queen’s drugged wine, while Reeves would have downed it. Luciano Marin played Hercules’ son Hylus and Salvatore Furnari was their midget companion\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 7\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\n8\n\nCinema Italiano Timotheus. The Theban Council featured Mino Doro as the head of the council, and guest stars Gian Maria Volonté, Ivo Garrani and Enrico Maria Salerno as Greek kings. Laura Altian played Antinea’s daughter Ismene – if she outlives her mother, Atlantis will be destroyed. Hercules saves Ismene from sacrifice to the god Proteus (Maurizio Caﬀarelli), who transforms himself into a snake, a lion, a vulture and a horned lizard to battle Hercules. Mario Petri played Zenet, the priest of Uranus, and Mimmo Palmera was the zombified head of Antinea’s black-cloaked guard. Scabby captives, imprisoned in a valley and fed animal carcasses, are massacred by the Atlantean Invincibles. Hercules dispatches the Invincibles with a fiery oil slick and destroys the Blood Stone, triggering mayhem. As the volcano erupts, water swamps the city and crumbling masonry and ash cascade – the special eﬀects were by Galliano and Ricci, with actual volcano stock from Haroun Terzieﬀ, whose footage cropped up in many pepla. For its US release by Woolner Brothers Atlantis was cut and retitled Hercules and the Captive Women. This version begins with a wobbly Filmation title sequence (which bills the director as ‘Cottafani’) and a tacked-on prologue, with voiceover narration by Leon Selznick. The score was re-edited by Gordon Zahler, and it partially replaced the original score with stock ‘epic’ music: Armando Trovajoli’s pastoral themes for the sea voyage are now accompanied by triumphant trumpet fanfares.\n\nDark Worlds: Peplum Horror Melding disparate genres was Mario Bava’s forte, so when he was approached to direct a Hercules film, it was no surprise that the results were genre-twisting. The working title was ‘Hercules in the Realm of the Dead’, but the release title in the UK was Hercules in the Centre of the Earth (1961). Hercules (Reg Park) returns to Icalia to find Deianara (Eleonora Ruﬀo) bewitched by King Lico (Christopher Lee). Warned by chancellor Keros (Mino Dora) that the city is under the curse of ‘Forces of Evil’, Hercules learns from seer Medea that he must travel to the Island of the Hesperides to find a golden apple, so he can pass into Hades, the Kingdom of the Dead. Hercules and his companions Theseus (Giorgio Ardisson) and Telemachus (Franco Giacobini) retrieve the apple and travel to the Underworld, where Theseus falls for Pluto’s favourite daughter Persephone (Ida Galli) and Hercules steals Pluto’s magic stone. Lico plans to drink Deianara’s blood during an eclipse to become ‘King for all Eternity’. Bava reused the palace interior and exterior sets at Cinecittà from Hercules Conquers Atlantis. The film opens with a band of brigands (led by Raf Baldassarre) ambushing Hercules at the Monte Gelato waterfalls, while beach exteriors (when Telemachus is almost torn apart by wild horses) were lensed at Tor Caldara. Hades was filmed in the Grotte Di Castellana (the Grottoes of Castellana) and the toxic menace of Hell seeps across the screen. The caverns are festooned with jagged stalactites and swathed in throbbing, vibrant colours (red, green, purple and blue) and swirling dry ice, filmed in Technicolor and Super/100 Totalscope.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 8\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n9\n\nThe heroes travel across the sea in Sunis’ magic ship, which sails against the wind under a blood-red sky. In the Garden of the Hesperides, the Land of Endless Midnight, granite golem Procrustes tortures Theseus and Telemachus on bonecrunching racks. When the heroes arrive in Hades, a beautiful woman, naked and chained, attempts to waylay them, but she is an apparition, who laughs mockingly as she bursts into flames. Hercules has been told by Arethusa, Queen of the Hesperides (Marisa Belli), ‘Do not believe in what you think you see’. Hercules and Theseus hack through a dense tangle of vines, which scream as they are cut, the branches dripping blood. The melancholic, haunting music by Armando Trovajoli deploys grating gypsy violins as spellbound Deianara rises from her tomb and an eerie clarinet bodes ill. For the macabre finale, as the stone tombs of Lico’s corpse army creak open, Hercules rushes through Lico’s dank cave lair to save Deianara. He is attacked by translucent-shrouded ghouls, which emerge from cobweb draped coﬃns and fly, swooping and clawing through the mist. At Lico’s mountain-top sacrificial altar, amid a ring of monoliths, Hercules kills Lico and fights the spectres. As the sun emerges, Lico’s corpse burns. The US release by Woolner Brothers, as Hercules in the Haunted World, features livelier title music and an animated title sequence designed by Filmation, its hypnotic swirls and flying ghouls resembling a schlocky drive-in poster. Maciste against the Vampire (1961) was co-directed by Giacomo Gentilomo and Sergio Corbucci, and co-scripted by Corbucci and Duccio Tessari. Maciste (Gordon Scott) returns to his village to find it has been razed by pirates led by slave trader Amahl (Van Aikens). Maciste’s mother (Emma Baron) has been slain and his lover Giulia (Leonora Ruﬀo) sold into slavery in the faraway Arabian city of Salmanak. Maciste and Giulia’s young brother Ciro (Rocco Vitolazzi) travel to Salmanak, where Sultan Abdul (Mario Feliciani) and his slave Astra (Gianna Maria Canale) are oppressed by Kobrak the Vampire, a master of black magic who lives on human blood. Maciste teams up with Kurtik (Jacques Sernas) and his clan of subterranean Blue Men. Astra (who is in league with Kobrak) takes Giulia hostage: Kobrak wants to use Maciste as the model for his race of zombies. Maciste leads the Blue Men in an attack on Kobrak’s lair, but the Blue Men are no match for the massed ranks of Kobrak’s zombie army. Salmanak (with its minarets, palace and bazaar) was filmed at De Laurentiis Studios and the Kingdom of the Blue Men’s azure grotto is typically Bavaesque. Kobrak’s club-wielding zombies are ‘slaves without a human soul’, their skeletal faces a blank mask. Maciste survives sonic torture from a huge clanging bell by stuﬃng wax in his ears. The sacking of Maciste’s coastal village, as the pirates slaughter and pillage, was filmed at Tor Caldara. Maciste’s numerous acrobatic brawls with the Salmanak guard feature an imaginative set piece in Salmanak’s bustling town square. Scott’s athleticism and acting are way above average for the genre (he’d played Tarzan in four screen adventures). Angelo Lavagnino’s score was replaced in the retitled US version (Goliath and the Vampires) with\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 9\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\n10\n\nCinema Italiano\n\nGordon Scott faces Kobrak the Vampire in Giacomo Gentilomo and Sergio Corbucci’s imaginative peplum-horror. Italian poster for Maciste against the Vampire (1961), which was also released as Goliath and the Vampires.

Lavagnino’s weird atonal violins scrape eerily on the soundtrack whenever Kobrak materialises in a cloud of red smoke. Annabella Incontrera plays Giulia’s friend Magda and Kobrak transforms himself into Maciste’s twin. The Macistes fight, with stuntman Giovanni Cianfriglia doubling for Scott. Maciste reveals Kobrak’s true identity (a skull-like face) and the vampire is dispatched with an exploding vial of deadly vapour. Riccardo Freda’s Maciste in Hell (1962 – The Witch’s Curse) remains the wackiest peplum horror. On 1 November 1550 in the Scottish village of Loch Laird, witch Martha Gaunt is put to the stake by Justice Edgard Parrish (Andrea Bosić) for having ‘Communion with the Devil’. A hundred years hence the locals are again witch-hunting – women are possessed by madness, while others try to hang themselves from a cursed tree, which flowers each time Martha Gaunt’s hex claims another victim. Newlyweds Martha and Charles Law (Vira Silenti and Angelo Zanolli) arrive to take up residence in Martha’s ancestral home, until the locals find out that her maiden name was Gaunt and sentence her to burn. So unravels the first 18 minutes of Maciste in Hell, made on atmospheric sets at Incir-De Paolis Studios and at Caldara Di Manziana. Then Maciste (Kirk Morris) rides in wearing a loincloth and the film swerves abruptly oﬀ-track, as he travels to Hell to convince witch Martha to remove her curse. The Hell scenes were staged in the caves of Castellana, an underground network of dramatic caverns and corridors with concretions of stalactites and stalagmites. It is still open as a tourist attraction today. Freda bathes these caverns in red tints, sets fires billowing smoke through them and pits Maciste against a roster of obstacles: a lion; a troglodyte Goliath (Pietro Ceccarelli); a giant stone being rolled uphill for eternity by Sisyphus (Bosić again); laughing, mocking voices; and a giant eagle which is pecking the entrails of tortured Prometheus (Remo De Angelis). Further extraordinary sights served up in Freda’s Tartarus are a great fiery iron door (The Gate of Death) and a cattle stampede, in which Maciste drives a herd oﬀ a cliﬀ in a scene animal lovers will shudder at. Maciste falls in love with beautiful Fania, but she’s actually sorceress Martha, who bewitches him. He forgets his quest and is reminded by replays of his previous exploits which appear in a pool of water (via clips from Atlas in the Land of the Cyclops and Samson and the 7 Miracles of the World). Helene Chanel appeared as both youthful Fania and old hag Martha, and John Karlson played Loch Laird’s mayor. English film critic John Francis Lane, disguised in a hat and long scarf, appears briefly as the coachman driving the honeymooners. The hero’s name is pronounced Mash-ee-stay, though in view of the Scottish setting perhaps it should have been Mac-Sheest. Carlo Franci’s score is a booming brass arrangement, augmented by an operatic choir who unleash a shrill salvo. Maciste picks his way through the writhing condemned, tormented by devils, who seem to have been influenced by Rodin’s ‘Gates to Hell’. Indestructible Maciste forges a path of fire through the caves and the whole violent exercise\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 11\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\n12\n\nCinema Italiano becomes an endurance test for both protagonist and audience – a hellish experience all-round. Dan Vadis (real name Constantine Daniel Vafiadis) played Argolese in Alvaro Mancori’s Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness (1963). Argolese liberates a kingdom from the Dragon of the Mountains (which he achieves via stock footage from Hercules) and then travels to the city of Demios, deep inside a mountain, to save his lover Telca (Spela Rozin) and her people, enslaved by Queen Ella (Carla Calo) and henchman Kabal (Ken Clark). Virtually non-stop, noisy action ensues in this preposterous yarn which deploys stock footage from Mole Men against the Son of Hercules and sets from Ursus in the Land of Fire. Usurper Melissa (Maria Fiore) murders Ella and plans to drink Telca’s blood, until Argolese lets fly, destroying the underground city as the creeping lava bubbles in. The warriors of Demios are flesh-eating cannibals, and tortured Argolese is chained between four elephants. The city is accessed by a stone drawbridge, which spans a chasm of lava. Argolese uses an uprooted tree as an improvised bridge, then for extra thrills he wrestles a bear whilst gingerly crossing the log. Giuseppe Vari’s Rome against Rome (1964 – Night Star: Goddess of Electra and War of the Zombies) was a unique take on Rome’s civil wars. Centurion Gaius Quintilius (Ettore Manni) is sent to Salmatia, a haunted land cloaked in tales of human sacrifice, torture and voodoo witchcraft, to track down a missing treasure. Suspicion falls on Praetor Lutetius (Mino Dora) but the culprit is Aderbal (John Drew Barrymore), the sorcerer high priest to the Goddess of Gold, a cult who worship the Daughter of Osiris, a golden cyclops statue which fires a blinding laser beam from its eye. Aderbal plans to mobilise a reanimated army of zombie Roman soldiers. Lutetius’s wife, Tullia (Susy Andersen), is in league with Aderbal, but Gaius has an ally in Tullia’s handmaiden Rhama (Ida Galli). Roman Consul Lucilius leads his legions against Aderbal’s forces, but the zombie hordes are indestructible. Gaius confronts Aderbal and Tullia in the sorcerer’s lair, stabbing the statue’s eye with his sword, which blinds Aderbal, causing the zombies to disperse. Aberbal’s torch-lit cavern lair, a mist-swathed underground set (filmed at CSC Studios), is dominated by the Goddess of the Night Star’s statue. Roberto Nicolosi’s score adds to the unsettling atmosphere. Barrymore (father of actress Drew Barrymore) was a hellraiser oﬀ-screen and his performance as Aderbal, the zealot with a hypnotic stare, is histrionic. Aderbal’s minions are knobbly faced mutants, who roam the misty battlefields by night, looting the dead, stealing treasure and carting oﬀ corpses. When Aderbal drinks human blood, translucent corpses rise from their tombs, accompanied by dissonant choral chanting on the soundtrack. The film is undermined by sluggish scenes of court intrigue (as Roman senator Andrea Checchi discusses foreign policy) and by the liberal use of stock footage from Hannibal and Constantine and the Cross. When Aderbal conjures up wind and snow to slow down the invading legions, we’re actually\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 12\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n13\n\nwatching Hannibal’s army crossing the Alps. The confrontation between Rome (living) and Rome (dead) is Hannibal’s Battle of Cannae, with the ghostly zombie cavalry galloping in slow motion. Antonio Margheriti’s cleverly plotted Hercules Prisoner of Evil (1964) cast Reg Park (minus his trademark beard) as Hercules (Ursus in the Italian print). In a vaguely medieval setting, evil Prince Zara (Furio Meniconi) and his Kirghiz tribe covet the land of Hercules’ neighbouring Chircassian tribe. Hercules is in love with the Kirghiz princess, Amiko (Mireille Granelli), and they enjoy trysts in the Grotto of the Falcon. The countryside is being terrorised by a caped fiend. Zara accuses Hercules of the attacks and then sacks Maliba, Hercules’ village, blaming the monster. But Amiko isn’t the real princess of the Kirghiz – Hercules’ slave Katia (Maria Teresa Orsini) is the true heir. Amiko is a witch who turns men into the monster with her potion. At various points Hercules, his brother Ilo (Ettore Manni) and tribesman Fredo (Claudio Ruﬃni) are transformed into the beast without knowing it. The monster, with its scarred face, hairy torso, muscly arms and a black cape, runs madly through the woods, squawking like a parrot. The film has a good, nocturnal atmosphere (filmed in Italian woodland undergrowth and torch-lit grottos) backed by Franco Trinacria’s dramatic score. In the finale, Hercules (transformed into the monster) carries Katia to the top of a cliﬀ, intending to throw her to her death. Ilo kills Amiko, breaking the spell, and Hercules (now himself) extinguishes a forest fire by bursting a dam.\n\nBorn from the Rock: Maciste For Son of Samson (1960 – Maciste the Mighty or Maciste in the Valley of the Kings) Mark Forest resurrected Maciste, an Italian muscleman hero who had been popular since silent cinema, when Genovese docker Bartolomeo Pagano played him in 25 features, beginning with Cabiria (1914). Forest explains that ‘Maciste’ means ‘I was born from the rock’. Son of Samson was directed by Carlo Campogalliani in Egypt, at the Sphinx and pyramids at Giza. Just as Samson smote the Philistines, his son Maciste pummels the Persians, the oppressive regime who are enslaving the Egyptians in the eleventh century BC. The Persian queen, Smedes (Chelo Alonso), and her conniving grand vizier (Peter Dorric) assassinate Pharaoh Armitee (Carlo Tamberlani) and take over his court at Tanis. The pharaoh’s son Kenamun (Angelo Zanolli), bewitched by the Necklace of Forgetfulness, marries Smedes – until Maciste arrives and provokes a slave revolt. The exquisite costumes and lavish sets appear to have been left over from a more expensive production. Alonso makes her evil role count and Smedes commits suicide by throwing herself into a crocodile pit. Formerly a dancer in the Folies Bergère in Paris, Alonso was known as the ‘Cuban H-bomb’. Whatever her shortcomings as an actress, she was a terrific dancer, which she demonstrated with a hip-notic, sensual showstopper in each of her pepla. Good support is oﬀered by Federica Randi as Kenamun’s lover Nofret and Vira Silenti as her sister,\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 13\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\n14\n\nCinema Italiano Maciste’s lover Tekaet. Egyptian musical accompaniment was provided by Carlo Innocenzi and Maciste’s feats include boulder hurling, lion and croc wrestling, ladder carrying and a bit of bar-bending and chain breaking. He escapes from the Cell of Death (as the walls close in), destroys a bridge as the Persian cavalry cross it and helps slaves erect a giant stone obelisk. The film also features some surprisingly gory action: in an arena a group of blindfolded slaves (including women and old men) are scythed down by a chariot with rotating knives on the wheels. Only in the final battle, shot in Yugoslavia, with extras poking each other with axes, pitchforks and spears, does the film falter. In Tanio Boccia’s The Triumph of Maciste (1961 – Triumph of the Son of Hercules), the hero again defied the gods – and a hernia – with feats of strength. In Memphis, Queen Teniphus (Ljubja Bodin) holds power with a magic sceptre and daily sacrifices to the God of Fire in the Temple of the Mountain of Thunder, the stronghold of the troglodyte Yuri Men. Maciste (Kirk Morris) is recruited to stop this barbarity – save the sacrificial victims, save the world. Joseph Nathanson created the matte shots of Memphis, Innocenzi provided a Chinese-sounding score, and Bodin played Teniphus as a sexy, low-rent Cleopatra. Maciste enters the Mountain of Fire and battles a lion, the burning gates of the inferno, a rockslide and a giant caveman – all stock footage from Morris’ Maciste in Hell. Giorgio Ferroni was similarly thrifty in Hercules against Moloch (1963 – The Conquest of Mycenae), which pitted Gordon Scott as Prince Glaucus (‘a Hercules’) against the Cult of Moloch. Ferroni cobbled together extensive battle and burning city footage from his own The Trojan War and The Last Glory of Troy, while the women drummers in Moloch’s Bavaesque lair were from The Bacchantes (1960). In fact, there’s more stock than new footage. Antonio Leonviola’s Mole Men against the Son of Hercules (1961) cast Mark Forest as Maciste (here pronounced ‘Machestus’), first seen on a beach reeling in a harpooned whale. He’s attacked by the Mole Men – an anaemic subterranean-dwelling race dressed in white robes, masks, horned headdresses and grass skirts – who die when caught in sunlight. Maciste and black slave Bangor (Paul Wynter) are put to work as labour in the Mole Men’s gold and diamond mine, driving The Great Wheel. Princess Saliura (Raﬀaella Carra) is to be sacrificed by Queen Halis Moyab (Moira Orfei) to appease the Moon Goddess. Despite a second-rate plot and Armando Trovajoli’s recycled score from The Giant of Metropolis (1961), Mole Men features some impressive sets. Location footage was shot at Tor Caldara and the spectacular Umbrian Marmore Falls (here wreathed in a rainbow), with interiors at Cinecittà. The Mole Men’s caverns are filled with mining paraphernalia: water jets, conveyors, chutes, pulleys and a heavy stone crusher, as the slave drivers whip hundreds of labourers toiling at the Great Wheel. Torture and suﬀering are commonplace: as punishment, one lax Mole Man guard is chained in the sunshine and reduced to a skeleton, and Maciste is placed in a cage with an ape man. As the slave uprising is stalled by the Mole Men’s accurate archery, Maciste uses the Great Wheel to demolish the\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 14\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:39 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n15\n\ncavern pillars. The film has added cult value for the early performance by future Euro-star Gianni Garko as villainous Katan the Mole Man. Gordon Mitchell (billed as ‘Mitchell Gordon’) starred in Antonio Leonviola’s Atlas in the Land of the Cyclops (1961 – Monster from the Unknown World). It opens on the Island of the Cyclops, the lair of the last descendant of Polyphemus. Queen Capys (Chelo Alonso) of Sadok is doomed with a curse which can be lifted only when the last heirs of Ulysses are dead. Capys’ soldiers attack the village of King Agrisandro (Germano Longo), killing him and capturing his wife Penope (Vira Silenti), but their baby son (Ulysses’ heir) survives. Efros (Massimo Righi) takes the boy to Maciste (Mitchell) – despite the title, Atlas is nowhere to be found, even in the English language dub. Maciste hides the boy on Mount Ramak and rides to Sadok. The villains include Dante De Paolo as henchman Ephetus and Paul Winter as brutal slave Mumba (who is eaten by a shark). Location scenes were shot on Tor Caldara beach. For a chase between two galleys towards the Cyclops’ island, Maciste rows a galley by himself. The film remains a cult favourite for its towering title villain (played by Aldo Padinotti), whom Maciste blinds with a sword and buries in rubble.\n\nFury of the Gods: Ursus Second only in popularity to Reeves’ Hercules in Italy was Ed Fury’s Ursus. Carlo Campogalliani’s Ursus (1961 – The Mighty Ursus or Ursus Son of Hercules) saw ‘The Hero of the Euphrates’ return from war to Sakara, to find that his fiancée Attea (Moira Orfei) has been spirited away to the Island of Zais. With blind shepherdess Doreide (Maria Luisa Merlo), Ursus heads across the desert (Tor Caldara, Lazio) and then travels to the tropical island, where he battles its evil queen. A good ‘mystery peplum’, Ursus was shot on location in Italy and Spain (including on leftover sets from King of Kings [1961]) and has a score by Roman Vlad. Roberto Camardiel played innkeeper Cleonte, Luis Prendes was villainous Setas, and Christina Gajoni and Soledad Miranda appeared in supporting roles. The incredible arena finale had Doreide regain her sight and Ursus (or rather Fury’s stuntman) convincingly tossed and trampled by an unleashed wild bull. In Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia’s Ursus in the Valley of the Lions (1961), Ursus (Fury), the infant son of a dethroned king, is abandoned in the desert and raised by a family of lions. Alberto Lupo played Ayak the usurping barbarian, Moira Orfei was Queen Theor, Gerard Herter played barbarian General Lothar and Mariangela Giordano was Ursus’ love interest, slave girl Anya. Scenes were filmed on location at Tor Caldara, Grotte Di Salone and the Monte Gelato Falls, and at Incir-De Paolis and Olimpia Studios. Anya is lowered into a pool of quicksand by evil Lothar, who gets his comeuppance when he falls into an animal pit and dies abruptly of hyenas. Fury makes a great doomed hero, an unfaltering force to be reckoned with. The scene when Ursus returns to his desert grotto, only to find his beloved lion family slaughtered, deliberately killed by Lothar with poisoned\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 15\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\n16\n\nCinema Italiano meat, is one of the most poignant in pepla – in the climax Ursus’ lion companion Simba takes revenge and mauls Ayak to death. Fury followed this with his best outing, Giorgio Simonelli’s Ursus in the Land of Fire (1963). Shepherd Ursus (Fury) and his people are oppressed by a warlike tribe from the Mountain of Fire, who covet the shepherds’ land. Evil General Hamilar (Adriano Micantoni) murders good king Lothar (Giuseppe Addobatti). Hamilar, with his lover Mila (Claudia Mori) and henchman Lero (Pietro Ceccarelli), massacres the shepherds’ village and leaves Ursus buried in a rockslide. Vengeful Ursus travels to the land of fire, fights tyranny and saves Princess Diana (Luciana Gilli). Ursus in the Land of Fire is successful through its arresting combination of sets and violence. The region’s volcanic atmosphere is evoked through Italian landscapes swathed in smoke, intercut with eruption stock footage. Location scenes were lensed at the Grotte Di Salone, Monte Gelato falls, the valley at Tolfa and at Tor Caldara, with studio work at Elios. The cavernous sets were decorated with giant gargoyle eﬃgies of the Fire God Ayat and other grotesqueries, and Carlo Savina provided the lush score. Ursus takes part in Hamilar’s grand tournament in a conspicuous disguise: a finned helmet and an outfit with leopardskin trim. He takes on all comers in the quarry arena during a muscle-twisting Trial of the Chariots and battles Lero and five highly trained wrestlers (including stuntmen Nello Pazzafini and Giuseppe Mattei) near a spiked pit, before being put to work driving the city’s millstones. When Hamilar murders the Fire God’s High Priest (Nando Tamberlani), the volcano erupts, the cascading flames staged by Eros Bacciucchi. Fury is a fine hero, especially during the fight scenes and when he wanders, dazed, into the razed shepherds’ village. Epitomising his indestructibility, colossal, lumbering Ursus, with his quiﬀ, sheepskin jerkin and boots, emerges dusty but unscathed from beneath the rubble of a volcanic eruption. Vengeance of Ursus (1961) headlined another muscleman contender as the hero – Canadian wrestler Samson Burke. With help from his little brother Darius (Robert Chevalier), Ursus escorts Sira (Wandisa Guida), princess of Lycia, to marry tyrant King Zagro (Livio Lorenzon) of Karia, though it’s a ruse by Zagro to take over both kingdoms. Directed by Luigi Capuano, Vengeance featured Gianni Rizzo as advisor Lycurgus and fencing master Franco Fantasia as the captain of Zagro’s guard. The film benefits from plenty of action: a bandit attack on a barge, Darius menaced by a hungry ocelot, a tavern brawl and the final storming of the city by Zagro’s army (filmed at De Paolis Studios). Pugnacious, brokennosed Burke for once looked like a man who wrestled lions, fought elephants and brawled with soldiers. He also played Hercules in The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962). Alan Steel played Ursus in Gianfranco Parolini’s knockabout The Three Avengers (1964), filmed at Elios Studios with costumes left over from Maciste against the Vampire. In Arabia Ursus is pitted against an Ursus impostor (Mimmo\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 16\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n17\n\nPalmera), resulting in some Ursus-versus-Ursus action. The real Ursus is blinded by acid for many of the combat sequences and his companions have to direct his movements. Ursus also duels with Semur (Nello Pazzafini), the axe-wielding leader of the desert-dwelling Tanusi. Glamorous set dressing was provided by Lisa Gastoni (Alina) and Rosalba Neri (Demora), and Gianni Rizzo played villainous Tiamoco.\n\nSamson Mounts a Mighty Challenge The last Italian muscleman hero to appear was Samson (1961), the figure from the Bible. Samson (Brad Harris) arrives in the city of Sulam to visit Queen Mila (Irena Prosen), but she has been usurped by Queen Romilda (Mara Berni), in league with Warkalla and his mercenaries, who seek the Treasure of Sulem hidden beneath the Temple of Baal. With rebel strongman Hermes, nicknamed Millstone (Alan Steel), Millstone’s sister Jamine (Brigitte Corey) and King Botan (Carlo Tamberlani), Samson takes on Warkalla, who has secretly imported his army, the Tribe of Var. With location footage lensed in Yugoslavia and the Sulam dancing girls played by the Ballet of the Zagreb Opera, Samson thrusts its muscleman hero into a familiar tale of court intrigue and civil war. What hoists Samson above standard fare is director Gianfranco Parolini’s brisk staging of the two-fisted action. Samson wrestles Igor, a well-oiled Ural mountainman, and fights Millstone blindfolded. Warkalla flees on a raft but, weighed down by treasure, drowns and is eaten by sharks. The best reason for seeing Samson is nefarious Warkalla, played by Serge Gainsbourg (the French crooner of ‘Je T’aime ... Mais non Plus’), with his rodent-like features and creepy sadism – a peplum nosferatu. Parolini and Harris also made The Fury of Hercules (1961) in Yugoslavia (at Dubrava Film, Zagreb) with Gainsbourg as the villain, Menistus. Hercules (Harris) returns to Arkad to find Queen Canidia on the throne and the city rife with rebellion. The film is a remake of Samson and Steel appears as villain Janek, who with his four Neanderthal brothers challenges Hercules.\n\nHit and Myth: Peplum Send-ups As pepla gained popularity in Italy and abroad, overt self-parody crept into the formula. Vittorio Sala directed a spoof of The Loves of Hercules – Colossus and the Amazon Queen (1960 – Love Slaves of the Amazons and Queen of the Amazons) – starring Gianna Maria Canale as the eponymous ruler. All males who land on the Amazons’ island are used for one night of passion and then put to work in a stone quarry guarded by bears. Amongst the male suitors are Rod Taylor as twitchy loveboat Pirrus and Ed Fury as Greek muscleman Glaucus. Shot in Italy and accompanied by a comic musical score that includes ragtime jazz and mambo, this intended romantic farce is an incoherent mess. Ignazio Leone appears as comic relief Egyptian Sofo who invents the boomerang. The\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 17\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\n18\n\nCinema Italiano plot hinges on the theft of the Amazons’ Sacred Girdle and the arrival of some greedy pirates (led by Alberto Farnese), but the slapstick situations and broad comedy don’t work in a peplum setting. In Mario Caiano’s Ulysses against the Son of Hercules (1962 – Ulysses against Hercules), following the Trojan War, Ulysses (Georges Marchal) blinds cyclops Polyphemus on Sicily. Heracles, the Son of Hercules (Michael Lane), is dispatched to bring Ulysses before the Gods. The two heroes find themselves shipwrecked and captured by the Bird Queen (Dominique Boschero in a feathered outfit, which resembles an ostrich). Ulysses hides in the caverns of King Lago (Gianni Santuccio), the head of a troglodyte army, and Heracles agrees to join King Icano, Lago’s enemy, if he can marry the king’s daughter Helen (Alessandra Panaro), an agreement that doesn’t please her lover Adrastes (Raf Baldassarre). The film is self-parodic in its approach to the genre and its most memorable feature is the queen and her bird army (a flock of extras in feathery loincloths and beaks) who live in a tropical paradise. They prepare to sacrifice the heroes to their god, the Mighty Vulture. During the ritual the feathery fiends perform a frenzied sacrificial dance, which resembles synchronised aerobics. The film ends with an impressive dust-swathed desert battle scene between King Icano’s forces and Lago’s trog minions. The finest parody peplum was Duccio Tessari’s directorial debut Sons of Thunder (1962), which starred former stuntman Giuliano Gemma as Crios, the youngest and smartest of the Titans. King Cadmus of Crete (Pedro Armendariz) kills his wife and declares himself a god. With Queen Hermione (Antonella Lualdi) he makes himself immortal and will remain so until the day Cadmus’ daughter Antiope (Jacqueline Sassard) falls in love. The gods release Crios from Hades with instructions to kidnap Cadmus and drag him to the Avernus, the entrance to Hades. Sons of Thunder was bankrolled by Franco Cristaldi for his Vides production company. It was shot in Italy and Spain on sets decked with palm trees from King of Kings. Carlo Rustichelli provided the score, which is as playful with peplum convention as Tessari is with the form. Gemma (his hair dyed blond) is brimming with confidence as the acrobatic lead, a trickster immortal posing as a country boy. Gemma’s poetic love scenes with Sassard are the finest romantic interludes in pepla – ‘All you need is love’, he tells her in the fadeout, having sent Cadmus back to Hell with a thunderbolt. Fernando Rey was Cadmus’ conniving high priest, Fernando Sancho was the captain of the Cretan guard and Antonio Molino Rojo was Cadmus’ advisor Idomeneus. Gerard Sety was mute Achilles (Crios’ ally in Cadmus’ palace) and muscleman Serge Nubret played condemned prisoner Rator. Tessari’s bravura set pieces include Cadmus’ soldiers chasing Crios through the marketplace (acrobatic Gemma trampolines on stall awnings), a corrida in a bullring and a manhunt with Rator the prey. There were 12 Titans in Greek myth and the youngest was called Kronos – here they are 10, who apart from Crios are bearded strongmen. The fantasy elements feature special eﬀects by\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 18\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n19\n\nJoseph Nathanson and photographic eﬀects by Galliano and Ricci, deploying miniature sets, outré designs and matte shots. In Hades, Sisyphus rolls a stone uphill, Prometheus has his liver pecked out by a vulture and starving Tantalus is tantalised by fruit he’ll never reach. Crios bribes a giant Hades’ guard with a ring in order to enter the Underworld and steal Hades’ helm, which endows invisibility. He rescues Antiope from her island prison by outwitting a snake-haired Gorgon sorceress, and to attack Cadmus he buys a quiver of lightning bolts from a Cyclops. In the white caverns below the city, the Titans face Cadmus’ indestructible soldiers, but Crios breaks the spell by breaching a dam with a thunderbolt. Sons of Thunder is a masterpiece of Italian cult cinema, its vitality and imagination making it one of the top pepla. It was titled Arrivano i titani in Italy and was released as My Son, the Hero in the US, promoted with the tagline ‘My Son ... The Hero! Smarter than a Fox! Braver than a Lion! Cuter than a Pussy Cat!’ If Sons of Thunder strove to subvert pepla, there were those where the humour was wholly unintentional. In Vulcan Son of Jupiter (1962), Vulcan, the God of Fire (Rod Flash Ilush), and Mars, the God of War (Roger Browne), quarrel on Mount Olympus over Venus (Annie Gorassini). Jupiter (Furio Meniconi) decides to punish them, but Mars and Venus flee to earth where they enlist the help of Thracian general Milos to build a tower up to Olympus to obtain power. Vulcan foils their plan, falling for earthly Etna (Bella Cortez) in the process. Directed by Emimmo Salvi, Vulcan has some of the wildest footage in the genre. Vulcan is discovered by a group of sea nymphs on Tor Caldara beach. They are imprisoned by Lizard Men, with scaly backs and tails and vampire teeth, and saved by Neptune’s Tritons, undersea fish-men. Gordon Mitchell had a supporting role as Pluto, the God of Darkness, and Salvatore Furnari appeared as Vulcan’s midget sidekick, Jaho, who infiltrates the Thracian camp disguised as a bush. Vulcan, the Blacksmith of the Gods, tends his workshop (shot in Grotte Di Salone) where he forges on a giant anvil. Unfortunately, Browne and bombshell Gorassini’s bland love scenes (backed by Marcello Giombini’s smoochy sax) lack chemistry: Vulcan’s anvil generates more sparks. Browne reprised the role in Mars, God of War (1962 – The Son of Hercules Versus Venus) where his ‘personification of Jupiter’s thunderbolt’ saves the city of Telvia from King Aﬀro (John Kitzmiller) and his African warrior army. When Mars falls for mortal Daphne (Jocelyn Lane), his request to renounce his immortality is granted by Jupiter – ‘Let it be done ... you will remain a mortal man, forever’ – and he later saves Daphne from being sacrificed to Perganto, a tentacled giant cactus. Fire Monsters against the Son of Hercules (1963 – Colossus of the Stone Age) starred Reg Lewis (ex-Mr America and Mr Universe) as Maciste, the ancient world’s first and last ginger muscleman. In probably the worst dubbing job of all time, Lewis delivers his dialogue with a condescending halfsmile. For the English language version, Maciste’s name is changed to Maxus.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 19\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\n20\n\nCinema Italiano To avoid redubbing the entire film, each time Maxus’ name is mentioned, a completely diﬀerent higher-registered voice dubs in the amended name. Set in prehistoric times, Fire Monsters tells of the peaceful valley-dwelling Tribe of Dorak (who worship the sun) and their war with the cave-dwelling Droods (who worship the moon), led by the evil Fuan (Andrea Aureli). The Droods kidnap Dorak’s women, so Maxus, a freelance do-gooder with a ginger quiﬀ, rescues them. Maxus falls for Moa (Margaret Lee) but when they are buried up to their necks by Fuan to be eaten by worms, a handy volcanic eruption splits the earth, freeing them. The Droods team up with the cannibalistic Ulma (led by Nello Pazzafini, wielding a rubber club) who wear headbands with two cow’s horns attached. Fire Monsters, directed by Guido Malatesta, is a prehysteric adventure set 1 million years BC (‘Before Cinecittà’). It was shot in Incir-De Paolis Studios in Rome and on location in the lakes, forests and caves of Yugoslavia. After they’ve been out clubbing, the Dorak enjoy watching dancing girls twisting in hairy outfits which resemble a carwash, and romance isn’t depicted very well in the film. Maxus and Moa enjoy romantic walks beside a swamp (accompanied by Mantovani strings) and during a wedding ceremony the groom is told that if his wife doesn’t obey him, ‘Then you have the right to put her to death’. The Fire Monsters of the title – a dragon in a lake, an underwater hydra and a monitor lizard that surprises Maxus and Moa in a cave – are puppet beasts, which Maxus easily dispatches. Colossus and the Headhunters (1963) deployed the volcanic eruption from Fire Monsters as its opening apocalypse, when Maciste (Kirk Morris) helps a tribe flee their island home. Escaping on a raft, the refugees drift to the land of Urya – a lush, forested country (looking very much like Yugoslavia) which has been taken over by Kermes (Frank Leroy) in league with a cruel tribe of headhunters led by Goona (Nello Pazzafini). Kermes plans to marry the deposed queen, Amoa (Laura Brown), but Maciste leads the Urians to liberty. Headhunters is a by-the-numbers peplum, again directed by Malatesta, and Queen Amoa wears the shortest peplum censors would allow.\n\nDelightfully Imaginative: Myths Remixed Alberto De Martino’s Perseus the Invincible (1963 – Perseus against the Monsters and The Medusa against the Son of Hercules) is an imaginative remix of Greek myths. According to mythology, Perseus defeated Medusa the Gorgon, a winged woman-beast with writhing serpents for hair, whose gaze turned her victims to stone. De Martino and his scriptwriters largely rewrite the story, with Perseus (Richard Harrison) caught between warring kingdoms, the cities of Seriphos and Argos. Acrisius, the evil king of Argos (Arturo Dominici), and his son, whip-lashing Prince Galinor (Leo Anchoriz), stop the merchants of Seriphus from using a trade route to the sea, which is guarded by a dragon and Medusa. Perseus, not knowing that he is the rightful ruler of Argos, sides with\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 20\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n21\n\ngood king Cepheus of Seriphus (Roberto Camardiel) and woos his daughter, Princess Andromeda (Anna Ranalli). Perseus was shot at Cinecittà (with set design by Franco Lolli), on location near Madrid and in Italy, notably at an almost unrecognisable Tor Caldara, here transformed with a matte shot and some mist into a magnificent jagged mountainscape: Medusa’s Valley of Petrified Men. Carlo Franci provides a horror movie score, deploying swirling violins, drums and ominous, resounding chords. Elisa Cegani played Queen Danaë, Perseus’ mother, who recognises her son by a birthmark, the Sign of Jupiter. The supporting cast includes Antonio Molino Rojo as Tarpetes (a traitor to Seriphus who is eaten by a dragon) and Lorenzo Robledo and Frank Braña as two princes. Legend has it that if the Medusa is killed, her petrified victims return to life, which will provide Seriphus with an army. Perseus kills the dragon and confronts Medusa, presented here not as a snake-haired woman but as a shuﬄing shrub-like creature with a mass of cascading tentacles and one glowing golden eye. Perseus hacks at its tendrils and uses his highly polished shield as a mirror. Eventually Perseus punctures Medusa’s bulbous eye, slitting it like an egg yolk, and the beast dies twitching. The hideous Medusa was created by Carlo Rambaldi, who went on to work on some of the most disgustingly convincing Italian horror eﬀects and created the lost alien in ET The ExtraTerrestrial for Steven Spielberg and the creature in Alien (1979). In Osvaldo Civriani’s Hercules against the Sons of the Sun (1964), Hercules (Mark Forest) is swept oﬀ course while crossing the Great Ocean from Hellas and is shipwrecked in Inca-period South America. He teams with rebel prince Maytha (Giuliano Gemma) to rid the kingdom of usurper king Atahualpa (Franco Fantasia), who has imprisoned the prince’s father, King Huascar (Jose Riesgo), and sister, Princess Yamara. Using Hercules’ modern know-how (including the invention of the wheel), Maytha’s army attack the fortified city of Tiwanaka with war machines to restore democracy. The film is lifted by its unusual setting and Lallo Gori’s Mexican-flavoured score. The cast look resplendent in their elaborate, colourful Inca costumes, with intricate ornamentation, gold decoration, beads, cloaks, skull masks and feathered headdresses, but the overlong dance sequences, choreographed by Gino Landi and Archie Savage, and showcasing the black dancer Audrey Anderson, slow the film’s pace. Giulio Donnini played Atahualpa’s high priest and Angel Rhu his queen. Anna-Maria Pace was cast as Maytha’s sister Yamara, under threat of sacrifice to the great god Viracocha. By hiring a few llamas for the camp scenes, the Italian countryside was transformed into the Andes, though Hercules is shipwrecked, as always, at Tor Caldara, Anzio Cape. Like Kirk Morris, Forest found that his peplum heroes were well-travelled, as in Michele Lupo’s Goliath and the Sins of Babylon (1963). In 200 BC, Goliath (Forest) returns to Nefer on the Persian Gulf to find it under Babylonian rule. Pergaso (Piero Lulli), the king of Nefer, must pay a yearly gift of 30 virgins to Babylon, with Babylonian Morakeb (Erno Crisa) ensuring the tribute is paid.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 21\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\n22\n\nCinema Italiano\n\nUS artwork for Michele Lupo’s Goliath and the Sins of Babylon (1963), starring Mark Forest as the imperilled hero. Poster courtesy Ian Caunce Collection.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 22\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:40 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n23\n\nGoliath teams up with rebel gladiators led by Evandro (Livio Lorenzon) and wins the hand of Princess Resya (Jose Greci) in a chariot race. Lupo cast Giuliano Gemma as acrobatic rebel Sandros and his gladiator compatriots included Mimmo Palmera as Arcao, Jeﬀ Cameron and Nello Pazzafini, with Paul Muller as the Babylonian king Kafus. A sea battle and Babylon burning are stock footage from Carthage in Flames (1960). For the US release by American International Pictures (AIP), it had new theme music composed by Les Baxter (replacing Francesco De Masi’s), tying it in with other ‘Goliath’ movies. Siro Marcellini’s The Hero of Babylon (1963), another Babylonian-set movie, starred Gordon Scott as Nipur, up against King Balthazar (Piero Lulli) and Queen Ura (Moira Orfei). A great-looking but pedestrian peplum, shot in Italy at De Paolis, it was misleadingly called The Beast of Babylon against the Son of Hercules in the US. The all-female Amazon tribe of Greek myth were understandably popular with peplum audiences. Antonio Leonviola’s Thor and the Amazon Women (1963) starred Newcastle upon Tyne champion wrestler Joe Robinson as Thor. In Carol Reed’s A Kid for Two Farthings (1955) Robinson had wrestled Primo Carnera, the ‘Ambling Alp’ from Hercules Unchained. Thor travels to the city of Babylos in the all-female country of Nalia, to free dethroned queen Tamar (Susy Andersen). Janine Hendy was the queen of Babylos, which forces its women captives to fight for their freedom in the Triangle of Death arena: the film was originally called Le Gladiatrici [The Gladiatrixes]. It was shot in Ceria Studios (Trieste), on location in Yugoslavia and in the Grottoes of Postumia. Black muscleman Harry Baird appeared as Thor’s sidekick Ubaratutu. Clips from Ursus in the Valley of the Lions and Mole Men against the Son of Hercules crop up in stock footage, and Tamar’s flashback to the death of her father is the attack on the Viking village from Erik the Conqueror (1961). Thor engages the entire female population of Nalia in an immense tug of war contest for his life, so that ‘The authority of men will be restored’. Dan Vadis played Hercules in Alberto De Martino’s lively The Triumph of Hercules (1964), filmed at Incir-De Paolis’ arena and city street sets, and on location at Tor Caldara. In the city of Mycenae, Prince Milo (Pierre Cressoy) has taken power by assassinating the king, the father of Princess Ate (Marilu Tolo). With a band of rebels led by Euristeo (Piero Lulli), Hercules plans to win Ate’s hand, but Prince Milo is aided by his sorceress mother, Pasiphae (Moira Orfei). The witch has given Milo a magic dagger, the golden Dagger of Gaea, which when unsheathed conjures up seven indestructible muscleman mercenaries made of gold. The Seven Sons of Gaea – bald, beefy and sprayed gold – resemble towering Oscars. Milo’s evil conspirators include Reto (Enzo Fiermonte) and Gordio (Renato Rossini), Jacques Stany played Erione (Hercules’ ally) and Aldo Cecconi and Nazzareno Zamperla played two cut-purses, the film’s comic relief. The witch lives in a mossy, misty cave and watches the action in a magic pool. For the finale, Pasiphae transforms herself into Ate – the only indication that she is an impostor is her orange eyes. For this scene Tolo wore tinted contact lenses.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 23\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\n24\n\nCinema Italiano The End of the Myth As steamrollering pepla began to run out of puﬀ, they ricocheted in ever more outlandish directions. Reg Park filmed his outdoor scenes for Piero Regnoli’s Maciste in King Solomon’s Mines (1964) in the Republic of South Africa. In the city of Zimba, evil Riad (Elio Jotta) overthrows the king with the help from Bedouin warrior queen Fazira (Wandisa Guida). The rightful heir, Vazma (Loris Loddi), is spirited away by Samara (Eleonora Bianchi) and sheltered in Bambara, with the Myedonga tribe. Maciste (Park), bewitched by a drugged garland of flowers and entranced by Fazira’s magic ankle band, is put to work in the Zimban gold mines, a plodding zombie slave. When Samara is about to be gilded in molten gold, Maciste breaks loose and Riad and Fazira are smothered instead. With the Myedonga sporting Zulu-like oval shields, assegai spears and knobkerry clubs, and with liberal stock wildlife footage and a voiceover that resembles the TV series The World About Us, this Maciste entry is one of the most distinctive – the African footage is intercut with Italian location shots (Tor Caldara and De Paolis Studios), thus providing an unusual backdrop. Park is his usual muscular self – he won Mr Universe the following year for the third time. Hercules the Avenger (1965) liberally reuses stock footage from previous Park adventures, cut-and-pasting to ingenious eﬀect. In Syracuse, recently widowed Queen Lida (Gia Sandri) receives proposals from several suitors, but Anticleia the oracle dissuades her from a swift union. Hercules (Park) travels to the Sunerian Marsh, to cure his son Zanthus, who has gone mad following a mauling by a lion. Hercules’ quest is footage from Hercules Conquers Atlantis and Hercules in the Centre of the Earth. The film also stars Giovanni Cianfriglia as the New Hercules, an impostor whose exploitation of the city leads to a revolt (footage from Atlantis). Hercules seeks out this impostor, who is revealed to be Antaeus, the son of the Earth goddess Gaia. Hercules plugs up a volcano, which erupts and destroys Syracuse (more footage from Atlantis), and then fights Antaeus in the Grotte Di Salone. Following Hercules the Avenger Park retired to South Africa to concentrate on his chain of bodybuilding gyms. Gordon Scott’s final contribution to pepla was the title role in the 47-minute pilot for a TV series called Hercules, produced by Joseph E. Levine in 1965. Hercules and the Princess of Troy featured an Anglo-Italian cast: Paul Stevens (Diogenes), Roger Browne (Ortag), Gordon Mitchell (a pirate captain), Diana Hyland (Princess Diana) and Giorgio Ardisson (Leanda, Diana’s lover). Photographed by Enzo Barboni on authentic peplum locations (the beach at Tor Caldara and the Grotte Di Salone), the show’s saving grace was its sea monster, a bug-eyed, stickle-backed, insect-like beast with pincers, which resembled a giant prawn. The show’s weekly format would have served up a diﬀerent adventure, as Hercules voyages to Thebes on his ship, the Olympia, but the peplum fad had passed and the series was never commissioned. Giorgio Capitani’s comedic Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus the Invincibles (1964) was released internationally as Samson and the Mighty\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 24\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n25\n\nChallenge. Alan Steel starred as Hercules, Howard Ross was Maciste, Nadir Moretti was Samson and Yann L’Arvor played Ursus. Elisa Montes (Omphale) and Luciano Marin (Inor) were the young lovers, Helene Chanel was the oracle and Livio Lorenzon a whip-cracking brigand. This shot-in-Spain production welded Greek mythology to the Old Testament. It was this film that was chosen for spoof dubbing in the Australian sendup Hercules Returns (1992). In Melbourne, disillusioned Brad McBain (Dave Argue) resigns from his job at the Kent Cinema Corporation and refurbishes a rundown cinema, with help from projectionist Sprocket (Bruce Spence) and maverick publicist Lisa (Mary Coustas). For the gala opening they show the last film that was screened at the cinema, billed as Hercules but actually Capitani’s movie. Too late they discover that their Italian language print is not subtitled, so the trio dub the film themselves. Hercules Returns was based on the live show ‘Double Take meets Hercules’, which was performed by Des Mangan and Sally Patience, who provide most of the principle voices here. In their story Hercules (‘The dumbest man in the world’) saves heroine Labia (Elisa Montes) from drowning, on his way to the city of Climidia. Muriel, Labia’s mother, owns the Pink Parthenon nightclub and won’t allow her to marry Testiculi (Luciano Marin), the son of a rival beer garden proprietor (Livio Lorenzon). Samson, with a weedy voice and pigtails, is now henpecked by Delilah, Ursus is a tavern brawler with a Glaswegian accent, and Maciste (now Machismo) has an eﬀeminate voice and a horse named Cyril. The Oracle (Helene Chanel), with her smoking skillet, is cleverly redubbed as a crepe chef. It was the unlikely figure of Pier Paolo Pasolini who had the last word on Greek myths in 1960s Italian cinema. Oedipus Rex (1967) was inspired by Sophocles’ plays Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus (also a source for Hercules Unchained). Abandoned as a child on Mount Cithaeron by a herdsman (Francesco Leonetti), Oedipus is found by a shepherd (Giandomenico Davoli) and is adopted by King Polybus (Ahmed Bellachmi) and Queen Merope (Alida Valli) of Corinth. Adult Oedipus (Franco Citti) travels to the Oracle at Delphi and learns that he is fated to murder his father and make love to his mother. En route to Thebes, where three roads meet, Oedipus murders a rich traveller. In Thebes, Oedipus kills the city’s tormentor, a monster called the Sphinx, and marries Queen Jocasta (Silvana Mangano), the widow of Laius (Luciano Bartoli), the recently murdered king. But Thebes is scourged with a plague which won’t lift until Laius’ murderer is found. Oedipus is implicated in the killing and suspects that Jocasta’s brother Creon (Carmelo Bene) is trying to take power. Tiresias the blind prophet (Julian Beck) identifies Oedipus as the culprit – King Laius and Queen Jocasta had tried to dispose of their newborn baby when they heard the evil prophecy, but fate brought cursed Oedipus back to Thebes. Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus pokes out his own eyes with a pin from her dress, wandering into exile as a blind beggar. As one would expect from idiosyncratic Pasolini, this isn’t regular peplum fare. The story is bookended by scenes set in modern Italy (shot in Bologna),\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 25\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\n26\n\nCinema Italiano but the majority takes place in the desert lands between Corinth and Thebes, which Pasolini shot on spectacular locations in Morocco. Oedipus was lensed by Giuseppe Ruzzolini, the grand cities and crumbling villages of Morocco more believable than Cinecittà’s cardboard palaces. Most of the extras are North Africans, with desert life etched into their faces. The costumes by Danilo Donati are stylised, almost to the point of distraction, the chunky woven fabrics, armour, helmets and crowns looking at once authentic and risibly bogus. Pasolini is a filmmaker with a fine eye for visuals. The Oracle at Delphi resembles an African tribal witch doctor, with a gourd-like headdress decorated with sticks and straw, while the Sphinx is similarly indigenous, not a monster but a man bedecked in straw, animal hair and necklaces. When we first meet Queen Jocasta, she is being pushed ahead of her entourage in a wheelbarrow, and victims of the contagion are tossed onto funeral pyres. Laius’ servant carries baby Oedipus tied to a spear over his shoulder – the child’s feet are tightly bound, which inspires his name: ‘Little Swollen Feet’ (Oedipus). Pasolini favourite Ninetto Davoli appears as Angelo, a Theban messenger boy who becomes blind Oedipus’ companion, while Pasolini has a cameo as a Theban spokesman. Mangano, one of the great faces of Italian cinema who shot to stardom in Giuseppe De Santis’ Bitter Rice (1949), makes a flawless Jocasta. The musical score is a string ‘Quartet in C Major’ by Mozart (used when Oedipus first meets Tiresias), a selection of Romanian folk songs (for village celebrations and ceremonies) and ancient Japanese music – a hollow beating drum and whistling flutes – which accompanies Oedipus on his desert odyssey. Pasolini followed Oedipus Rex with Medea (1969), loosely based on the play by Euripides. Jason (Giuseppe Gentile) is raised by a centaur (Laurent Terzieﬀ ) and returns to Iolcus to claim his throne from King Pelias (Paul Jabara). The king sends Jason on a quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece. In Colchis, sorceress Medea (opera diva Maria Callas), the daughter of King Aeëtes, helps Jason to steal the fleece and runs away with him to Iolcus. In Corinth Jason falls in love with Glauce (Margareth Clementi), the daughter of King Creon (Massimo Girotti), and Medea uses her magic to take revenge. Partly based on the same source material as Hercules and The Giants of Thessaly, it is almost unrecognisable as the same story. The costumes are a mixture of Middle Eastern, African, Japanese and Medieval, giving the film a distinctive visual style. A chariot used by Medea looks nothing like its peplum equivalent, but rather a rickety construction of animal skins and timber, with solid wooden wheels, while the Argo is simply a raft with a livestock pen and oars. Pasolini filmed in Turkey (cave dwellings represent Colchis and weird tepee-like rock formations at Goreme) and Syria (the citadel fortress of Aleppo as Corinth’s walls). Pasolini also shot in Italy: the Camposanto (cemetery) with its distinctive arched wall in the Piazza Dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles) in Pisa became Corinth and the coast at Grado (in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region) was the setting for Jason’s upbringing. Pasolini even uses the beach at Tor Caldara, when Jason and his Argonauts leave Colchis.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 26\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\nMythological Epics\n\n27\n\nPasolini stages some incredible brutality in Medea. In Colchis, a sacrificial victim is dismembered with an axe – his blood is dabbed on the crops, his vital organs are rubbed against fruit trees and his body parts are burned on a fire, to guarantee a good harvest. When King Aeëtes leads a posse after the fleece thieves, Medea hacks up her brother Absyrtus (Sergio Tramonti) and leaves a trail of body parts through the desert, slowing the pursuers down, as the king collects the bits of his son for burial. Fearful of the sorceress, King Creon exiles Medea, who takes revenge on Jason by killing Glauce. Pasolini includes two versions of this: one as described by Euripides, one his own interpretation. Medea gives a dress to Glauce, but as the princess puts it on, it catches fire, immolating her. In Pasolini’s variation, Medea gives Glauce a bewitched dress which compels Glauce to jump to her death from Corinth’s walls. For her final vengeance, Medea murders her three sons by Jason and burns their house: ‘You will suﬀer with me’, she tells Jason. Callas, in her only film, is a powerful screen presence. That face, with its strong forehead, noble nose and deep eyes, is the living image of classical Greek vase artwork. Medea is powerful, intellectual filmmaking – Hercules with subtitles it ain’t.\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 27\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\nHughes_ch01.indd 28\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:41 PM\n\nChapter Two Historical Escapades, High Seas and Low B’s Costume Adventures\n\nD\n\nuring the boom in Italian popular cinema, Italy, Spain and the former Yugoslavia were passed oﬀ as many locations, from the plains of Troy to the Russian steppes. Yugoslavia was an attractive location for international coproductions in the 1960s, due to its wide range of majestic, picturesque landscapes (from rolling, lush valleys and woodland to mountains and waterfalls) and its hoards of cheap extras. Italian cinema produced many disparate costume adventures, usually inspired by big budget Hollywood productions of the day, including pirate movies set in the Caribbean, swashbuckling cavalier and musketeer films, Napoleonic and Risorgimento epics, desert-set Arabian adventures and tales of rampaging Tartar and Mongol hordes.\n\nComes a Norseman: Viking Adventures An unexpectedly popular sub-genre of Italian adventure cinema was the Viking saga. Richard Fleischer’s The Vikings (1958) was the trigger film, with Kirk Douglas’ scar-faced Einar (one eye plucked out by a falcon) and Tony Curtis’ slave Eric (who has his left hand chopped oﬀ ) fighting over Welsh princess Morgana (Curtis’ then-wife Janet Leigh). Mario Nascimbene’s fine score and the siege finale proved particularly influential and the film spawned half a dozen Italian derivatives starring Cameron Mitchell, Gordon Mitchell, Giorgio Ardisson or Giuliano Gemma, and also Richard Widmark’s Hollywood vehicle The Long Ships (1964), which was shot in Yugoslavia. Giacomo Gentilomo’s Last of the Vikings (1961) cast Hollywood star Cameron Mitchell as Viking leader Harald. Viken, his village, is destroyed and his father murdered by Sveno (Edmund Purdom), the king of Norway. Harald poses as Danish emissary ‘Prince Ragmar’ to kidnap Sveno’s daughter, Princess\n\nHughes_ch02.indd 29\n\n3/23/2011 12:00:55 PM\n\n30\n\nCinema Italiano Hilda (Isabelle Corey). Aakon (Andrea Aureli, with one eye and a scarred face) seizes control of Viken, but Harald kills his usurper. The Vikings construct war machines (a battering ram tower and catapults that fire flaming logs) to attack Sveno’s castle. Last of the Vikings is the best of the Italian cycle. Instead of the model trireme often deployed in pepla, it has full-sized Viking ships with dragon prows ‘Furnished by Nettuno Navy Yard’. It also has a percussion-driven Roberto Nicolosi score and vivid costumes and set design. This is especially apparent in the Vikings’ return to Viken (a crow-pecked, arrow-riddled misty ruin) and in Sveno’s labyrinthine stone castle and torture chamber (interiors were filmed at Cinecittà and Titanus), where Harold’s brother Guntag (Giorgio Ardisson) is crucified by Sveno on an X-shaped cross. The bloodletting is frequent, with death by arrow in the eye, hatchet to the head, torch to the face and sword through the chest, complete with blood spurts. Viking formula ingredients include boisterous feasts and funeral pyre send-oﬀs to Valhalla. London-born Edmund Purdom, cast as Sveno, had worked with Laurence Olivier on the Broadway stage in Caesar and Cleopatra and Anthony and Cleopatra. His histrionic shambling transforms Sveno into Richard III; Purdom portrayed several historical figures in Italian spectacles, including Herod and Rasputin. The supporting cast features Mario Feliciani and Piero Lulli as Sveno’s henchmen Simon and Hardak, and Aldo Buﬀo Landi as Harald’s lieutenant Longborg, while fencing master Benito Stefanelli appears as Viking Lorik. Mitchell turns in an eﬀective performance as the dynamic Harald, who in one scene dispatches a bear about to ravage Hilda. The success of Last of the Vikings in Italy resulted in Mitchell being called back to make Erik the Conqueror (1961), directed by Mario Bava. It was released as Fury of the Vikings in the UK, and has been known variously as The Invaders, Viking Invaders and Conquest of the Normans. This is not to be confused with Giuseppe Vari’s Attack of the Normans (1962), with Mitchell as the villain, which was set in the time of the Norman Conquest. Erik the Conqueror begins in 786 AD with a spectacular action sequence staged on the beach at Tor Caldara, Anzio Cape (depicting the coast of Northern Britain), as Sir Ruthford’s British army pillage a Viking village. Viking Erik (Giorgio Ardisson) is captured and raised by British queen Alice (Françoise Christophe). In adulthood he becomes Duke of Helford, commander of the British navy, while his brother Eron (Cameron Mitchell) becomes a Viking chief and leads an expedition against Britain. Eventually Erik and Eron face each other in a duel. Filmed from August to October 1961, the film’s interiors were at Cinecittà and Titanus Studios, including a vast Viking great hall (dominated by a gnarly root from Hercules in the Centre of the Earth). The colour-drenched Bava compositions in widescreen Dyaliscope visually enhance the film. Bava staged his sea battles indoors on studio soundstages – to suggest the forward movement of\n\nHughes_ch02.indd 30\n\n3/16/2011 8:04:50 PM\n\nCostume Adventures\n\n31\n\nUS poster for AIP’s release of the Viking epic Erik the Conqueror (1961), directed by Mario Bava and starring Cameron Mitchell and the Kessler twins.

Bava created a castle atop the bluﬀs of Tor Caldara by simply cutting an image from the National Geographic and aligning it in the frame. The final battle, as the Vikings storm Queen Alice’s fortress, is a convincing swirl of fire and sword (plus stock footage from Last of the Vikings). The cast included Andrea Checchi as Sir Ruthford, Raf Baldassarre as his trusty bowman assassin, Folco Lulli as Erik and Eron’s father, Joe Robinson as Viking warrior Garion and Franco Ressel as King Lothar (Queen Alice’s murdered husband). Lothar is king of the Britons in the English language print, but of Scotland in the Italian version. A casting coup was the beautiful East German Kessler twins, Alice and Ellen, as white-robed Vestal Virgins. Erik falls for Rama (Alice) and Eron loves Daya (Ellen). The Kesslers were cabaret stars (they perform a synchronised dance routine in Erik) and later appeared briefly in The Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah. AIP trailers for Erik billed them as ‘Life’s Cover Girls’. In Mario Caiano’s Erik the Viking (1965 – Vengeance of the Vikings), Erik (Giuliano Gemma) leads an expedition across the Sea of Darkness and discovers America. Lucio De Santis, Gordon Mitchell and Eduardo Fajardo covet the Indians’ gold and Elisa Montes is Erik’s Indian princess love interest. Photographed by Enzo Barboni and scored by Carlo Franci, the film is notable for its tropical greenery, shot in the botanical gardens of Finca (country house) La Concepcion, north of Malaga. Bava’s Knives of the Avenger (1966) is a western in Viking garb. Although his penchant for gore, mist and shadow is more than evident in the film, it was yet another Bava hybrid, coining ‘Viking horror’. Karin (Elissa Pichelli, billed as ‘Lisa Wagner’ or ‘Lissa’) and her little son Moki (Luciano Polletin) are warned by seer Shula to go into hiding. Aghen (Fausto Tozzi) is trying to kill them, so Karin and Moki relocate to a hut in the mountains. They are visited by a wandering stranger (Cameron Mitchell), an expert crossbowman and knifethrower. He is vengeance-seeking Rurig (some sources call him Rurik) – Aghen beheaded Rurig’s wife "
