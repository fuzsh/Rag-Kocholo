        "text": "We asked critics and film historians what they consider to be the most obvious and serious dark areas that still impede a complete overview of the history of Italian cinema.\n\nMany of the replies concentrate on Italian silent cinema, others indicate even more unfamiliar territories. Alberto Farassino and others indicate that “the great unknown (not seen, not studied, not talked about) of Italian cinema is the documentary.\n\nThere is no list of films in this sector, not even a partial one, no history, no recognized competence. In fact, even among critics and historians there is always an unfavorable prejudice. Though never admitted, this prejudice can be noted when the choice has to be made between a documentary and a ‘real film’. And the number of titles available is quite small.”\n\nTo this still greatly unexplored sector we dedicate a brief program, hoping to readdress it in a more articulate presentation in the successive editions of Il Cinema Ritrovato."
