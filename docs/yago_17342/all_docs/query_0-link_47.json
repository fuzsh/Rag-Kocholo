Fifty years after their first self-titled album in 1973, Acqua Fragile comes out with a brand new work, a studio album with totally original songs, still with three original members of the band: Piero Canavera (drums, percussion and vocals), Franz Dondi (bass) and Bernardo Lanzetti (lead vocals, guitar and Glovox); they are joined by other musicians, all previously together on stage in live adventures, over the past two years.\n\nLino Capra Vaccina: Syn.Thesis. Dark Companion (DC019). Street date: 15-12-23. Once again Lino surprises us. Always a poet of silences and strictly acoustic sounds, now he offers an album where synthetic sounds are the protagonists! What makes it truly incredible is that it doesn't matter whether Lino sits at the piano or his beloved vibraphone or his arcane gongs. Lino is immediately recognisable. There is something ephemeral yet persistent in his semantic expression. Something that in fact makes Lino Capra Vaccina's poetics unique and capable of probing deep ancestral chords: sounds of memory without time and space!\n\nDivae Project: Stratosferico & Other Stories. Ma.Ra.Cash Records (MRC118). This CD release reissues and brings together the mini LP \"Stratosferico\" - released for the Record Store Day in 2021 - and the single \"After the War\", an homage to John Wetton that reached the market in 2023. In addition to this are three tracks that form \"the other stories\": La Follia Che Diventa Realtà, with lyrics by Gianni Leone (originally recorded for the anthology Progressivamente 1973-2003), an orchestral version of the tune \"È la Guerra\" (one of the tracks on the 2023 single) and finally \"A Gift For Keith Emerson\", homage in four instrumental movements, a minisuite describing the iconic keyboardist's problematic life, which ended in suicide on March 11th, 2016! The project was conceived by Guido Bellachioma (music critic, director of the «Prog Italia» magazine and of the Progressivamente Festival since 1993) and Davide Pistoni (multi-instrumentalist and uniquely talented composer), who developed and worked on the ideas together, right up to the final mix, obtaining a full-bodied and nuanced sound. Around them they gathered some of the best Italian musicians of yesterday and today, including among other Banco's pianist Gianni Nocenzi, Lino Vairetti (the charismatic voice of Osanna!), Fabio Trentini (Le Orme) but many many more yet!\n\nMoongarden: Christmas Night 2066. Ma.Ra.Cash Records (MRC124). December 2023. Musically suspended between vintage atmospheres in the best tradition of symphonic rock and modern sound design thanks to Cristiano Roversi's decades of work as producer, the album represents not only the band's first concept album, but also their creative peak, being in all respects the culmination of a career that starts way back in the 90's. Welcome to a musical film composed of eight \"scenes\", each representing a crucial moment of a family drama .... Available as 2CD - the 2nd filled with extra content, titled \"Still More Oddities\", but also presenting collaboration between the band and other (Il Porto di Venere, Mangala Vallis, Saro Cosentino, etc...) - and vinyl (MRCLP042)\n\nSyndone: DirtyThirty. Ma.Ra.Cash Records (MRC125). December 2023. This 9th album by the Turin-based band encompasses a vision and the desire to make a mark in the world! Syndone is a shape-shifter, a band that has changed its skin and its musicians without ever changing its soul: swimming against the tide, defying fashion and the decline (not only musical) of an era in which you can be successful only if it pleases the powers that be. Syndone, with their erudite rock, as violent and energetic as they are melancholic and orchestral, are a counterpoint, a raised middle finger to the devious strategy of collective narcosis slyly dropped from above in the Kali Yuga of Western civilization. They are an antidote to the apathic mediocrity floating and deafening all around!\n\nIT'S A BIG ... BIG ... WORLD!\n\nPROG IN THE UNITED KINGDOM!\n\nPorcupine Tree: Closure / Continuation. Live Amsterdam 07/11/22. Street date: 23-02-24. Deluxe 2Bluray + 2CD + Book. Blu-Ray disc 1 will be full show + bonus features and Blu-Ray disc 2 will be Dolby Atoms Surround Sound Audio, 5.1 Surround Sound Audio and 24 bit High Resolution Audio + 60 page 12\"-sized book housed in slipcase. Will also be released on 4 x 12\" heavyweight clear vinyl, in individual sleeves and inner bags housed in slipcase.\n\nOUR LITTLE SCANDINAVIAN CORNER!\n\nTasavallan Presidentti: Live at Ruisrock 1971. Street date: 01-03-24. Much live material from the Finnish band has been released those last years and after their initial performance at the Ruisrock festival in 1970 - presented on the album \"Changing Times and Movements\" - comes now their performance from 1971, again released by Svart Records! There's also been a lot of talk among fans about a certain cover tune by Tasavallan Presidentti and its discovery and release are long overdue. Well, here it is, King Kong by Frank Zappa, performed by Tasavallan Presidentti at Ruisrock 1971! The release will be available on various formats: Svart exclusive! 2LP, ultra clear/black marble vinyl, gatefold, booklet. Limited to 150 copies / 2LP, transparent purple vinyl, gatefold, booklet. Limited to 400 copies. / 2LP black vinyl and finally 2CD with booklet.\n\nFROM OVER THE ATLANTIC!\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPE?\n\nMarkus Stockhausen / Luca Formentini: Rêverie. Dark Companion (DC020). Street date: 08-12-23. Luca (guitarist) and Markus (trumpeter) began playing together in 2005, when Markus formed an international ensemble to play at the Suoni delle Dolomiti festival. On July 9th, 2021 Markus visited Luca while traveling to some concerts in central Italy. They set up in Luca's studio and recorded a fully improvised set, where nothing was previously arranged or agreed. The full set is captured on this album: four takes without any overdubs. The music reflects the meeting of two different musical stories, each musician reacting to the other in a continuous flow of inspiration, tension and release. Their dedication to listening to each other is tangible and yet they still maintain their personal presence - to call or answer and to move together into unknown territories. You can almost grasp the musicians? wonder at the evolving and unpredictable sonic landscape. Acoustic sounds interweave with electronic parts in constant exploration with the spontaneity of intuitive composition. A deep sense of space and dreamlike atmospheres emerge from the music, the dimensions of width, depth and time seem to expand!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCANTERBURY TALES ...

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE EAST ... WHAT HAPP...\n\nRoz Vitalis: Quia Nesciunt Quid Faciunt. Lizard (lizard cd 0190). December 2023. This band has existed since 2001 as a mainly keyboard studio project, conceived by keyboard player-composer Ivan Rozmainski, but has evolved over the years into a large instrumental collective with a progressive rock bent. Most of the songs of this *new* concept album were developed during the band's concerts in 2018-2021, but further recording, mixing and mastering continued until 2023. What sets it apart from all other studio albums are its very technical drum parts. Unfortunately, the drummer - he was also the author of two short pieces played on synthetic piano and the sound engineer responsible for mixing and mastering - left the group shortly before the album's completion. So this release is both the first and last studio album of Roz Vitalis with the participation of Evgeny Trefilov!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ ....JAZZ .... JAZZ ....\n\nRon McClure: Just Sayin. SteepleChase Records (SCCD 31959). Street date: 15-03-24. The latest album embodies 8 tunes by this prolific composer including the famous Nimbus which he wrote at age 15 but has never recorded himself before. Recorded in February 2023 with Anthony Ferrara on tenor saxophone, Michael Eckroth on piano and Steve Johns on drums\n\nSun Ra! The label Cosmic Myth will reissue Sun Ra's Saturn Records catalog under official license from Sun Ra LLC, comprised of the artist's heirs, using the best available audio sources and meticulous remastering techniques. Check them out!\n\nTomasz Stanko: Wooden Music II. Astigmatic Records (AR026CD). Street date: 27-10-23. This is the 2nd and last part of the Wooden Music adventure and the last recorded session in the legendary line-up of Stanko, violinist Zbigniew Seifert, saxophonist & flutist Janusz Muniak, bass player Bronislaw Suchanek, drummer Janusz Stefanski. It was recorded in Hamburg on November 9th 1972, in some way a conclusion of the band's vision of free-jazz! It's also available in a limited edition on violet vinyl, together with a B2-sized poster\n\nAVANT GARDE / NEW MUSICS\n\nPhilip Corner - Chorus At The Corner: A Joyfull Noise. Angelica Records (IDA054). Street date: 05-01-24. Born in 1933, with a career spanning over 65 years, the American composer Philip Corner has explored the most diverse artistic and musical expressions: as a pianist and trombonist, as composer and performer, member of the ensemble Fluxus. He experimented with both \"action\" music and \"meditative music\", electronic or concrete montages, proto-plunderphonic collages, graphic scores, verbal philosophical/poetic instructions, contemporary gamelans, extreme minimalism, but he also composed for string quartets, chamber music ensembles, orchestras?.... A Joyfull Noise is a commission work entirely dedicated to his compositions for choir.\n\nWith the arrival of Eargong Records, a new recording path will lead you to the most hidden areas of experimental music and sound research. Experimental rock, creative jazz, contemporary music, collective improvisations, pre-digital electronics ... On the border of established genres and on the horizon of new sounds, Eargong's mission will be to find unpublished recordings and reissues from the analogue archives of the great innovative 60's, 70's and 80's.\n\nChristian Wolff: Sveglia. Angelica Records (IDA055). Street date: 05-01-24. The programme offered on May 7th, 2022, revolved around Sveglia, a new composition for seven electric guitars commissioned as a world premiere by the festival. Largely completely notated, but with a series of compositional features left open (i.e. no specification of tempi, dynamics and spacing of musical elements), Sveglia also includes short quotations from other compositions (Bach?s Brandenburg Concertos n. 3 and 6, and a motet by Gombert), \"that need not necessarily be noticed\".\n\nELECTRONIC MUSICS\n\nBRAZILIAN MUSIC\n\nDVDs ...

It is impossible for us to know WHEN this will happen and with time going, they may still appear here after being sold out or deleted; therefore take a good look at the street date we provide ( when we know it!) and don't be too surprised if you happen to discover an unavailable item here; you will probably have found it too late, years after it was written down!\n\n25,000 Kittens: S/T. Sad Disco (SADI3). August 2022. 10\" EP limited edition. Originally released in 2014 as a limited edition of 50 cassettes on the legendary Japanese ambient/new age cassette label \"Ginjoha\", this rare work has now become extremely hard-to-find item on the market place. It now has been reissued in analog format with additional tracks!\n\n3 Hür-El: Hür-El Arsivi. Guerssen (GUESS056). July 09. 2nd album that came out in 1976, still on the Diskötur label. It has a more Western feel than the previous; more drums, less percussions but still an astounding blend of psychedelic rock and Turkish tradition, plenty of distorted fuzz guitar and electric saz. Comes with an insert, with liner notes and photos.\n\n3 Hür-El: S/T. Guerssen (GUESS057). July 09. One of the very few, if not the only one, Turkish groups not doing any covers but only self-penned compositions, here in their debut album from 1972. A brilliant set of Turkish ethno-influenced folk-rock tracks with a psychedelic feel, some great electric guitar and fantastic Eastern percussion. A very rare album now available again, with mastertape sound, insert, liner notes and photos.\n\nA Piedi Nudi: Creazione (95). Mellow Records. Sent in May 08: last copies of this LP + EP by an Italian prog metal band which many have compared to Deus Ex Machina because of the numerous stop-and-go sections, the constant theme changes and the musical complexity. So don't wait too long! If you read this today, act today! €25\n\nA.T.R.O.X.: The Night's Remains. Spittle (SPITTLE46LP). February 2022. A.T.R.O.X. were one of the first bands to move beyond typical new wave styles and introduce strong electronic elements. Not too far from works of their contemporaries Tuxedomoon and Minimal Compact. The Night's Remains was originally released in 1982 on the Italian label Trinciato Forte Records, and is now back in print on LP for the first time since then.\n\nA.T.R.O.X.: Water Tales. Spittle (SPITTLE47LP). February 2022. This was the group's second and final album, originally released in 1984 on the Italian label Contempo Records, and now back in print on LP for the first time since then.\n\nAaltonen / Helasvuo / Hauta-aho / Vesala: Jazz Liisa 17. Svart Records. Street date: 09-03-18. 200 copies on green vinyl but also available on black vinyl! In January 1973 an impromptu supergroup took over the airwaves on the Jazz Liisa series. Saxophonist Juhani Aaltonen, pianist Esa Helasvuo join bassist Teppo Hauta-Aho and the iconic drummer Edward Vesala in a special one-of-a-kind show of contemporary, revolutionary jazz.\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : Jazz Sahara. So Far Out (OUT5002LP) 180 Gr. vinyl. Feb. 2013. Decades before the advent of 'World Music', bassist-composer Ahmed Abdul-Malik introduced Arabic music into jazz, creating a distinct, unique sound that was far beyond its time. He was also the first to use the oud, a pear-shaped, traditional Middle Eastern stringed instrument similar to a lute, as a jazz instrument. Recorded in 1958, with tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin (his bandmate in the Monk quartet), and originally out on the Riverside label, Abdul-Malik's debut solo album Jazz Sahara was a burning fusion of Middle East and West. €16\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : Spellbound. Klimt (MJJ388). Street date: 28-11-16. A mindblowing mix of jazz and Middle Eastern influences and a rare 60's treasure from Thelonious Monk's former bassist! Ahmed Abdul-Malik blends together percussion, bass, and oud with some soulful solo work from Seldon Powell on tenor and flute, and Ray Nance on cornet, stretching out over long tracks with an exotic vibe.\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : Eastern Moods Of Ahmed Abdul-Malik. Sowing Records (SOW028). Street date: 02-09-22. Another reissue and limited edition of 500 copies pressed on clear vinyl (see album description below).\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : Sounds of Africa. Life Goes On Records (LIFE032). Street date: 10-03-23. This is the fourth album by double bass and oud player Ahmed Abdul-Malik, featuring performances recorded in 1962 (except one track from 1961) and originally released on the New Jazz label. This early 60's Afro-jazz jam with Middle-eastern and Latin flavours is one of the first in its genre. The album also features drummer Andrew Cyrille, alongside the lesser known Bilal Abdurahman and Chief Bey.\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : The Eastern Moods Of Ahmed Abdul-Malik. Doxy ACV (ACV2084). Street date: 19-01-17. The group on the set is a trio - Ahmed on bass and oud, Bilal Abdurrahman on alto, Korean reed flute and percussion, William Henry Allen on bass and percussion. With that kind of lineup, you can imagine the feel - lots of spare rhythms, with snaking reed work over the top, done in a very evocative way - and although there's less jazz than usual, the alto sax solos still give the record enough of a jazz component to set it apart from straight world music. Numbered limited edition of 500 copies.\n\nAbdul-Malik, Ahmed : The Music Of Ahmed Abdul-Malik. Life Goes On Records (LIFE031). Street date: 10-03-23. Featuring drummer Andrew Cyrille, recorded here early in his career, playing in a more traditional style than he would eventually become known for! Recorded by Rudy Van Gelder, the album comes from one of those many sessions from the '60s, here featuring an often overseen jazz musician of Sudanese descent!\n\nAbiogenesi: Io Sono Il Vampiro. Black Widow 180 gram LP (also available on CD). BWR088LP / BWR088CD. 4th album by Tony D'Urso, this album is the soundtrack of the italian horror movie \"I am a Vampire\" in the usual Dark Prog style but also exploring a more psychedelic touches with the addition of great cover versions of Never Let go (Camel), Lady in Black (Uriah Heep) and Mary Clark (Black Widow) and with the help of Marco Cimino (keys) and Gigi Venegoni (guitars) from the 70's Italian band Arti e Mestieri. Beautiful artwork made by Anna Ferrari in gatefold cover. (LP €18 & CD €17)\n\nAccordo Dei Contrari: Violato Intatto 2LP. Ma.Ra.Cash (MRCLP018). Nov. 2018. This double vinyl is much more than a reissue of Violato Intatto, as the original album is here embellished by two additional unreleased tracks, Onta Anexelenkta and Crash, recorded in February 2018. The track list has been therefore reconceived in two parts, Violato (disc 1) and Intatto (disc 2)\n\nAcqua Fragile: Moving Fragments. Ma.Ra.Cash Records (MRCLP041). October 2023. Fifty years after their first self-titled album in 1973, Acqua Fragile comes out with a brand new work, a studio album with totally original songs, still with three original members of the band: Piero Canavera (drums, percussion and vocals), Franz Dondi (bass) and Bernardo Lanzetti (lead vocals, guitar and Glovox); they are joined by other musicians, all previously together on stage in live adventures, over the past two years.\n\nAcqua Fragile: Mass-media Star. Sony (88875121271). 180 gr. LP reissue. Sept. 2015\n\nAdderley, Cannonball: The Black Messiah Live in Vienna (November 04 1972). WHP (WHP1457). Street date: 10-02-23. Here is a fine example of pure electric Jazz-Funk of the era by a top flight quintet featuring - alongside the Adderley brothers - Mr. George Duke on piano (acoustic and electric), Walter Booker on bass and Roy McCurdy on drums.\n\nAdderley, Cannonball with The Bossa Rio Sextet Of Brazil: Cannonball's Bossa Nova. Doxy ACV (ACV2029). Sept. 2014. The Brazilian band was no less than Sergio Mendes' Bossa Rio group. A numbered first press of 500 copies pressed on Audiophile Clear Vinyl (ACV).\n\nAdvancement, The: S/T. Cosmic Rock (COSMRO013). Street date: 21-10-22. After collaborating with Gabor Szabo on such influential \"rare groove\" albums as \"More Sorcery\" and \"Dreams\", bassist Louis Kabok and drummer Hal Gordon further embraced jazz-rock fusion under \"The Advancement\" monicker. Their heady melting pot of jazz, hard rock and psychedelia is anyhow well described on the album's closing number.\n\nAffinity: S/T. Bonfire Records (BONF016). Street date: 11-11-22. This sole album by cultish British prog-blues combo - originally released in 1970 on the influential label Vertigo - never ceases to be reissued and here's the latest one, a limited edition of 500 copies with gatefold cover.\n\nAfter Dinner: 1982-85. Soave (SV28). Street date: 03-09-21. Founded under hand of delicious female vocalist, musician and composer Haco in 1981, broaching a very interesting collective cohesion, After Dinner embraced new wave, traditional Japanese music, free contemporary and avant-garde rock. 1982-85 includes all their first production; the complete 1st album \"Glass Tube\", 2 tracks from the 1st 7\" single and a bonus track track from a 1985's compilation on Celluloid. Comes with a 24-pages booklet.\n\nAgorà: Live in Montreux. Vinyl Magic (VM 086LP). 13/07/12. Founded in Ancona, Agorà curiously debuted with a live album instead of a studio one; music, as specified in the album notes, is clearly inspired by Weather Report, but the influence of their country fellowmen Perigeo is evident too. The artwork, made by Cesare Monti, is very peculiar too, with a front standing-up edge-cut tree. This is a faithful reproduction, in black audiophile 180gr. black vinyl.\n\nAhmad Jamal Trio: At The Blackhawk. Naked Lunch (ND033). Street date: 01-07-22. The well-known 1962 performance by the celebrated Ahmad Jamal Trio with Israel Crosby and Vernel Fournier at the Blackhawk Club in San Francisco. This formation of the group wouldn't last long, as Israel Crosby died in mid-1962.\n\nAhmad Jamal Trio: Chamber Music Of The New Jazz. Naked Lunch (ND013). Street date: 19-06-20. Recorded in 1955 and originally released on the short-lived Parrot label, this recording is a stunning example of the creative, elegant, and precious music played by Ahmad Jamal's early trio. The fruit of the magical interplay between Jamal's sophisticated pianism, Ray Crawford's highly rhythmic guitar playing, and Israel Crosby's fine double bass. Three musicians whose individual roles are fully expressed through the collective approach to a new form of \"chamber\" Jazz.\n\nAitken, Laurel: Rege Dege Ding. Dynamite (DNM14003). 180 gr. 2LP. May 2014. This collection of early singles culls together mento and ska tracks recorded between 1958 and 1962 by \"The Godfather of Ska\" for labels like Kalypso and Blue Beat.\n\nAitken, Laurel: The Fantastic Laurel Aitken. Radiation Reissues (RRS038LP). Dec. 2014.

Dec. 2014. Finally, after four decennies of waiting for its re-release, fans can finally obtain the LP, with the added incentive of 4 bonus tracks from those 69 sessions.\n\nAitken, Laurel & The Skatalites: Ska Titans. Black Butcher Classics (BBC023). Street date: 31-05-19. Over 50 minutes of classic traditional ska from the Founding Fathers of ska The Skatalites and the Godfather of ska Laurel Aitken! - This historic recording represents the reunion of these two groundbreaking artists in 1996 some 30 years after their original meeting in Jamaica! - The studio tracks feature excellent new versions of Aitkins classics \"Rudy Boy Dreams\" and \"It's Too Late\" plus Skatalites performing \"Come Down!\"\n\nAitken, Laurel & The Skatalites: The Original Cool Jamaican Ska. Honey Pie (HONEY040). Street date: 15-10-21. Intermittently recorded in 1963 at Federal Studio in Kingston, this is pure cool Jamaican sound and groove at its best.\n\nJason Ajemian, Tony Malaby, Rob Mazurek, Chad Taylor: A Way A Land Of Life. NoBusiness Records (NBLP 74). 2014. Limited edition of 400 copies\n\nAkira Ishikawa & His Count Buffalos: African Rock. Cinedelic Orient Series (CNLP63). Street date: 09-04-22. Fully licensed and remastered from the original tapes, including OBI and insert. Among the many albums made with this band, few are quite as revered and sought-after as 1971 \"African Rock\". This is certainly the most dazzling and impactful, flawlessly produced. Here is psychedelic spiritual jazz with funky veins, riding on paths traced as much by Fela Kuti as by the electric Miles Davis, with juicy, tribal and deep percussive elements - his drums are flanked by Kenji Shiraishi's marimba and Masami Kawahara's percussion - electric piano accompaniment by the great Hiromasa 'Colgen Suzuki (also on acoustic piano and composition) or the *tabbing' guitar solos of Kimio Mizutani.\n\nAkira Ishikawa & His Count Buffalos: Bakishinba: Memories Of Africa. Cinedelic Orient Series (CNLP67). Street date: 24-03-23. The band reminds of Santana in the way they embody these energies in their album.?Yet, at the same time, they give life to even more impressive musical compositions. This is also thanks to Hiromasa Suzuki's innovative electric piano. Often defined as a jazz-rock band, Count Buffalo scales new heights in the context of jazz thanks to the strong rock influences that characterize this work.\n\nAkiyoshi, Toshiko: Her Trio Her Quartet. Doxy ACV (ACV2079). Street date: 19-10-16. Recording session from July 1956. First edition of 500 numbered copies.\n\nAktuala: La Terra. Psych-Out Records (PO-33031). 2012. Originally released in 1974, the band's 2nd album saw a change in the line-up, featuring among other what must be one of the first - if not the very first - appearance of Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu. Fantastic 180 gr. blue vinyl reissue with a strong textured cardboard cover. Expensive but every penny worth! Collectors, this is a true gem! Repressed in 2019.\n\nAktuala: S/T. Psych-Out Records (PO-33030). 2012. Self-titled debut album, originally released in 1973 and here reissued as a red-coloured LP with a fantastic, beautiful textured gatefold cover! Pressed on 180 gr. vinyl. Expensive but every penny worth! Repressed in 2019.\n\nAktuala: Tappeto Volante (BBXL 10009 LP). 06/06/14. This exclusive reissue of the band's third and last album is enriched by a booklet with rare and unreleased images, plus the bonustrack \"Il Sussurro dell'Anima\", taken from the solo works of Walter Maioli, the true spiritual guide of Aktuala.

This is like an open door on a wild Nuyorican party including food, drinks and an ongoing selection of highly infectious Latin grooves to dance to.\n\nAlessandroni, Alessandro: Fischio Amore Mio.

Evolved from the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, created in 1965, Watts' spin-off project Amalgam came two years later, with drummer John Stevens and bassist Jeff Clyne (previously in The Jazz Couriers with Ronnie Scott); their debut LP Prayer For Peace is jazz improv at its most melodic, an unpredictable album of varying shades\n\nAmon Düül: Psychedelic Underground. Ichspiel (CHS1695). Street date: 01-03-18. Amon Düül's 1969 debut-LP 'Psychedelic Underground', here reissued on vinyl, is music at its most experimental and relentlessly uncommercial, using late 60's influences as a launching ground for what would become known as Krautrock.\n\nAmon Düül: Meetings with Menmachines Inglorious Heroes of the Past... Klimt Records (MJJ351LP). Nov. 2012. In its ultra rare artwork original! This LP was originally released in 1983 on the small British label, Illuminated Records with an album sleeve of original artwork that was soon inexplicably replaced by a mediocre band photo on all subsequent reissues. It was the second of four all-new studio albums made by this UK-based incarnation of Amon Düül. The new Amon Düül featured John Weinzierl on guitar, ex-Hawkwind bassist Dave Anderson (both from Amon Duul II), ex-Van Der Graaf Generator Guy Evans on drums, and Julie Waring on vocals. For this LP the band moved away from the more free-form freakout of their earlier days towards a sound that was far more structured and derivative, with definite New Wave / post-punk leanings. €16\n\nAmon Düül : Psychedelic Underground.

This is an album coming from ten musicians / souls belonging to the young Norwegian jazz scene. Joyous melodies, passionate outbursts and lots of fun are created with extended means: two basses, tablas, a string and a wind quartet, simply put: a luxurious listening experience for the adventurous!\n\nAndromeda: S/T. Black Widow Records (BWR 140). New special edition from 15/06/14. One of the hidden treasures of the English psych-progressive era of the late sixties, Andromeda was originally released by RCA in 1969.

Now available onn vinyl, an album on which the Sardinian musician changes course, openly confronting the Mediterranean sea in a navigation that takes us to the multi-ethnic atmosphere of Mare Nostrum's ports. The compositions come from utopic crossroads, dreamlike landscapes, sketched with a fountain pen, places sheltered from the storm's fury, recalling illusions and mirages.\n\nAngelo, Nelson & Joyce: Nelson Angelo & Joyce. Polysom (333851). Street date: 28-06-19. Reissue on 180 gram vinyl. Incredible early work from Joyce, working here with Nelson Angelo, a bandmate of the singer in the group A Tribo; the pair write and perform songs with a vibe that's similar to her later work, but maybe a bit darker and moodier too!\n\nÄnglagard: Prog På Svenska - Live In Japan (ANG004LP). 2LP. Street date: 20/06/14. &AumlPicture Disc;nglagård has since the success of \"Viljans Öga\" put a lot of effort in a live album from Japan, where they've shared stage with Crimson ProjeKCt.\n\nÄnglagård: Viljans Öga.

Gatefold LP reissue.\n\nApryl Fool: S/T. Survival Research (SVVRCH008). Street date: 30-08-19. The story of Japanese psychedelic band Apryl Fool and their eponymous debut album is simply extraordinary. It was the vehicle by which bassist Haroumi Hosono first came to prominence, years before he became known as the \"Godfather of Japanese electronica\" as the founding member and leader of Yellow Magic Orchestra. Drummer Takashi \"Rei\" Matsumoto was a Beatles maniac, while pioneering prog-rock keyboardist Hiroyoshi Yanagida and guitarists Chu Kosaka and Eiji Kikuchi had all been part of a group called The Floral, formed in 1967 through the Japanese wing of the official fan club of The Monkees (whom they supported during a Japanese tour enacted in October 1968).\n\nAquila: S/T. Klimt Records (MJJ370). Street date 14/04/14. Aquila was formed in 1970 by Welsh guitarist/vocalist Ralph Denyer, who had recently left the group Blonde On Blonde. Aquila's self-titled debut - and only long player - from the same year is a delicious mix of progressive rock, psych-pop sensibility, a Traffic-like funkiness, and pastoral country-rock. Produced by Nirvana's Patrick Campbell-Lyons and powered by Denyer's rugged vocal delivery, Aquila unfairly faded into obscurity rather quickly but has been sought after by collectors for over 30 years.\n\nArabs In Aspic: Victim Of Father's Agony. Black Widow (BWR185). March 2016.\n\nArabstazy: Under Frustration Vol. 1. Shouka (SHK5V3). Street date: 13-07-18. Under Frustration is a 3 volumes compilation project by Tunisian collective Arabstazy, establishing a picture of the contemporary electronic music scene in the Arab World. This musical journey stands for the diversity of this scene, and deconstructs the occidental perceptions that sees the Arab World as a culturally united and homogeneous entity. It is a manifesto for the burgeoning wave of post-revolution futurism.\n\nArachnoid: S/T. Replica (RPC03). May 2014. This 1979 record is the sole album by the French band, architects of a dark progressive and psychedelic masterpiece, with a King Crimson flavor. \"Arachnoid\" is not only one of the best classic symphonic rock albums of the second half of the 70's, but also the most complicated and intriguing. LP reissue on 180 gr. vinyl and a limited edition of 500 copies\n\nArchie Shepp-Bill Dixon Quartet, The: S/T. Jeanne Dielman (JD117). Street date: 05-12-16. The debut as a leader for both Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, two formidable members of the free-jazz and avant-garde elite, The Archie Shepp - Bill Dixon Quartet was originally released in 1962. Rounding out the quartet are bassists Reggie Workman and Don Moore, drummers Paul Cohen and Howard McRae, each on various tracks. While the album undoubtedly swings, this piano-less quartet definitely prefigures the trailblazing free-jazz work the two leaders would be involved in for the remainder of the decade, and beyond.\n\nArdley, Neil: Kaleidoscope of Rainbows. Lantern Heights (LANRH003). Street date: 22-07-22. Reissue on 180 gram vinyl in a limited edition of 500 copies. This album is unmistakably a trait d'union between the British (orchestral) jazz-rock heritage and a more confident way of writing. Heading clearly to different directions,it showcases the talent of the main composer with the singular talent of trumpet player Ian Carr (Nucleus), cello player Paul Buckmaster (otherwise known for his collaboration with David Bowie and Miles Davis) and master clarinet player Tony Coe. This is the final part of an Ardley trilogy, preceded by Greek Variations (1969) and A Symphony of Amaranths (1971). Here, Ardley uses Balinese scales - the pelog, a Gamelan scale comprising seven notes, and the slendro, an older, more commonly used Gamelan scale. They are used in a variety of note patterns, each unique combination the basis of a series of \"Rainbow\" compositions, from Rainbow 1 to Rainbow 7.\n\nArea: 1978 Gli Dei Se Ne Vanno Gli Arrabbiati Restano. Vinyl Magic (VM 142LP). 180 gr. vinyl reissue of this album from 1978. The music moves in a stronger free-jazz direction. It was the last album with Demetrio Stratos who died in 1979. Faithfully restored in the original gatefold sleeve cover! €20\n\nArea: Are(A)zione. Akarma (AK 397 LP). 28/07/11. New 180 gr. vinyl reissue. €20\n\nArea: Are(A)zione. Gatefold LP 180 gram Get Back GET5104. For their fourth album (originally released in 1975 on Cramps), Area's unique sound combined the punch of rock with the frightening chaos of experimental music. The \"International POPular Group\" was a fascinating band. This album contains one song from each of their previous records plus a 15-minute jam (the title song) and a free-jazz interpretation of \"L'Internazionale\". €16,50\n\nArea: Arbeit Macht Frei. Akarma (AK 394 LP). 28/07/11. New 180 gr. vinyl reissue. €20\n\nArea: Arbeit Macht Frei. Get Back (GET LP5101). 2007. Debut album by the massively influential Italian prog group, originally released in 1973 on the experimental Italian Cramps label. This ground-breaking album sailed Italian music into uncharted waters and right off the edge of the earth. Experimental politicized rock with overtures to prog and jazz all held together by Stratos' otherworldly vocals. Reissued with the original gatefold sleeve and the infamous \"gun\" insert, originally only included in the first 1,000 copies (because it was considered too incendiary and if they continued the album would have been banned). €16,50\n\nArea: Caution Radiation Area. Akarma (AK 395LP). 28/07/11. New 180 gr. vinyl reissue. €20\n\nArea: Caution Radiation Area. LP 180 gram. Get Back GET5102. Originally released in 1974, the band's second album added increasing levels of fringe experimentation to their already weird recipe. €16,50\n\nArea: Crac. Sony reissue. Street date: 14-04-17. Terrific digital remaster, for the first time at 192 khz and 24 bit. From the original master tapes\n\nArea: Crac. Akarma (AK 396LP). 28/07/11. New 180 gr. vinyl reissue. €20\n\nArea: Crac. Gatefold LP 180 gram. Get Back GET5103. Area's third album is an eclectic furnace of jazz-rock, ethnic folk, experimentation and an ethically conscious manifesto for the arising of the masses, which made Area an icon of the Italian music scene of the 1970s. This is perhaps the best confirmation of the band's crazy fusion: furious, mind-bending rhythms and melodies balanced with humor and the avant-garde. €16,50\n\nArea: Crac. Sony (88875135242) LP reissue. Sept. 2015\n\nArea: Event 76. €12\n\nArea: Maledetti. Akarma (AK 398LP). 28/07/11. New 180 gr. vinyl reissue. €20\n\nArea: Tic & Tac.

Any European jazz lover won't hesitate to tell you. Soul Jazz is one of the most rare French modern jazz records and a cult offering that collectors snap up for big bucks. A LP from youth, Soul Jazz has lost nothing of its spirit and shine, and serves as historical proof of French Jazz's originality. €17\n\nArzachel: S/T. Akarma (AK184). Street date: 18-03-22. This classic early Canterbury album will always pop up again and again for reissue, as Steve Hillage would soon become famous for his work in Gong, and Dave Stewart would become a legend of British prog with Egg, Hatfield and the North, National Health, up to his later work with wife Barbara Gaskin in the 80's.\n\nArzachel: S/T. Klimt (MJJ315CW). Street date: 04-08-16. Contains one bonus track from a lacquer of the same period.

Acid Nightmare (ANM012). 05/02/15. The American band Asia only recorded two albums, one in 1978 and the present in 1980. This album predates the Epic Prog Metal genre with a few years, to be followed by bands like Warlord and Dark Quarterer. Influenced by monsters like Uriah Heep, Styx, Rush and Black Sabbath, Asia cemented their name on all the want lists of prog/pomp collectors as well as more traditional metal fans. This reissue offers remastered sound and faithful cover reproduction. Limited to 500 copies\n\nAsia Minor: Points of Libration. AMSLP164. Pressed on turquoise vinyl. Street date: 29-01-21. Asia Minor is a Franco-Turkish progressive rock band led by two Turkish musicians who settled in Paris as students back in the 70's.

A melancholic and sometimes furious music, with lyrics mainly sung in English - and occasionally in Turkish.\n\nAssagai: S/T. Cosmic Rock (COSMRO014). Street date: 21-10-22. Assagai was an Afro-rock band, active in the early 1970s in London, whose relatively short career produced two albums recorded in 1971.

Replica (RPC14). Street date: 03/09/15. Largely regarded as one of musical producer and engineer Jean-Pierre Massiera's major 70's projects, rather than being highlighted as a short-lived ensemble. While their sole, self-titled album failed on the path towards popularity and promotion, it is instead significantly appreciated for the classic-sounding, obscure and rare French prog treat it mirrors.\n\nAtlas, Natacha: Ayeshteni. €16\n\nAtoll: L'Araignée-Mal. Replica (RPC09). Shipping date: 30/04/15. 180 gr. vinyl reissue of the band's second album, released in 1975.\n\nMusiciens - Magiciens.

Street date: 14-04-2016. The 3rd Atoll album recorded in 1977, used to be considered their most mature album. Still influenced by YES and early Genesis, now a Zeuhl's flavor perfumes its symphonic progressive rock.\n\nAtomic Rooster: Made in England. Akarma (AK 177). Street date: 06-11-20. Reissue on original pasted US Cardboard Gatefold Sleeve.\n\nAtomic Rooster: On Air: Live At BBC. 2LP. Oct. 2018. Pressed on 180 gram white vinyl, with gatefold cover and including a 60x90 cm poster.

Sireena Records (SIREENA4010). LP. 01/04/11. This LP reissue of the debut album from 1980 comes in gatefold cover with all lyrics and 180 gr. heav-weight vinyl.\n\nAudience: Friend's Friend's Friend. Klimt (MJJ402LP). Street date: 28-02-19. Friend's Friend's Friend was Audience's second album and the first published by the famous Charisma Records in May 1970. More than on their first album, here the band's original Art Rock formula finally takes full shape. A peculiar combination of pop, folk and jazz elements and a distinctive sound palette based on acoustic guitar, banjo, saxophone, piano and vocals on top of a rock solid bass and drums rhythm section. Pressed on color vinyl.\n\nAudience: S/T. Tiger Bay (TB6331). Street date: 06-12-18. 180 gram vinyl reissue.\n\nAudience: S/T.

LP (AK357LP). 1969 self-titled debut album penned by a British band who probably were one of the most interesting groups in the British panorama of the late 60's / early 70's. Their sound was a manifestation of their desire to experiment with and masterfully blend different musical styles, such as rock, folk, jazz, and blues. If we must make comparisons, Jethro Tull immediately leaps to mind, particularly because of the band's use of flute. €16\n\nAufklärung: De La Tempesta... L'Oscuro Piacere. Pick Up Records (PK2021). Street date: 26-03-21. First time ever on vinyl! The sole album by this Italian band was released on CD in 1995.\n\nAugustus Pablo: Live At The Greek Theater, Berkeley, 1984.

Official reissue limited to 500 copies on black vinyl. Ave Rock's second album \"Espacios\" (1977) is their most accomplished effort! A pioneer of symphonic prog in Argentina, the band's compositions are extremely ambitious, with some epic, expansive songs clocking in at 21 and 15 minutes respectively. Ave Rock arranged eclectic musical motifs with lively and expert cohesiveness, a clever management of textures and tempo shifts, robust performance skills, and a solid interplay between members. Vocal harmonies bring to mind bands like Yes, with a dramatic sensibility influenced by Genesis, Pink Floyd's early eerie melancholy, and a healthy dose of their own special ethereal magic. The powerful rhythm section combines rocking dual guitars with piano chord progressions, layers of heavy organ and synthesizer, making the album a feast for the ears. Espacios is a milestone of high quality early South American prog.\n\nAve Rock: S/T. Svart Records. Street date: 22-11-19. Ave Rock is a Latin American take on classic organ-based progressive rock, full of time changes and alternating tempos with a good splattering of psychedelia and symphonic rock in places. This is the first time this rarity is being reissued on vinyl. The pressing is limited to 500 copies and comes with liner notes by renowned psych historian Vernon Joynson.\n\nAwakening, The: Brand New Feeling. Cinedelic (CNLP69). Street date: 26-05-23. The Awakening were one of the greatest bands in early '70s jazz blending Spiritual and soul. They combined veterans of Chicago's R&B sessions and jazz players affiliated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and were the only \"group\" on the legendary Black Jazz Records roster. This album includes the most representative tunes from their only two albums released in 1972/1973.\n\nAxiom Funk: Funkcronomicon. Plain Recordings (PLAIN211DLP). Street date: 24-01-19. First time ever released on vinyl, pressed on red & cyan vinyl, with gatefold sleeve and insert. This is essentially a lost Parliament-Funkadelic album.

Honeypie (HONEY012). Street date: 25-09-20. Recorded in 1963 and still far from his latter-day funk-fusion output, \"West Coast Vibes\" is the result of a fine straight-ahead jazz studio session featuring Ayers's vibraphone, Curtis Amy's saxophone, and Jack Wilson's piano among others. A one-off chance to hear Ayers dealing with standards like Monk's \"Well You Needn't\" and Parker's \"Donna Lee\"!\n\nAlbert Ayler Quartet: The Hilversum Sessions. Our Swimmer (WELLE109). Street date: 26-08-22. A rather dubious reissue on some kind of pseudo label, probably more bootleg than legal!\n\nAlbert Ayler Quartet: The Hilversum Sessions. Modern Silence (OI021). Street date: 25-01-17. Limited edition on 180 gram vinyl. This album presents Albert Ayler in all his blowzy, testifying glory, fronting a quartet that includes trumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray.\n\nAyler, Albert: In Greenwich Village. Superior Viaduct (SV136). Street date: 09-06-23. In Greenwich Village, Ayler's first LP on Impulse!, perfectly captures the Cleveland-born saxophonist's radiant intensity. Sourced from a pair of live engagements - February '67 at the Village Theatre on New York's Lower East Side and December '66 at the Village Vanguard - these recordings show an improved clarity in production and performance.\n\nBoth sets feature two basses (including Alan Silva and Henry Grimes) which allowed the ensemble to go in different harmonic directions while maintaining an organic unity.

Sowing Records (SOW017). Shipping date: 03-12-21. The art of repackaging and rehash!

This Bacalov / Morricone 1971 experimental album is repressed here for the 1st time from the original master tapes. The compositions created by the two maestros use techniques proper to certain procedures of Musique concrète, like for example the non-traditional use of instruments for timbre research but also the manipulation of the global sound through superimpositions, variations in the speed of the tape, natural and artificial echoes, and other processes.\n\nBacharach, Burt: Hit Maker!

Mixing Baroque, free-jazz and world music, the unique album of the Baroque Jazz Trio (which is in fact 3/5 of the Bach Modern Quintet) is a difficult-to-label sound object which is far from being typical of the psychedelic sounds associated with the early 70's, breaking down all barriers with an audacity that begins with the highly original and extraordinary use of the harpsichord!\n\nBallrogg: Rolling ball. Clean Feed (CF558LP). Street date: 24-09-21.

Pick from the liner notes: liner notes: \"The astonishing fluidity is what makes the music of Ballrogg so special.

In \"Sintesi\" Alessandro has performed, recorded and produced every track, using an electronic gear with some acoustic elements such as a few drums (his main instrument), processed concrete sounds and his own voice on the song Lifetime, along with an accurate work of sound design and sound processing. The result is a melancholic and introspective album surrounded by a detailed and evocative scenario, with rhythms that sometimes flow free and sometimes stumble, as it happens in real life.\n\nBass Communion: Dronework. Tonefloat (tf201). Street date: 22-10-21.

By the time they got around to recording their sophomore album Mantle-Piece, Brown was out of the band, yet they recorded his songs and sang his parts. The album was a critical and commercial disaster. It was later rediscovered by hip hop crate diggers for its raw funky production and open grooves especially on the track \"The Crosswords And The Safety Pins\".\n\nBattiato, Franco: Clic.

Composer, conductor, arranger and musician Les Baxter is fondly remembered as one of the forefathers of the 1950s Exotica sound, alongside other luminaries such as Lyman, Denny, and Esquivel. 1959's African Jazz is one of his most renowned and sought after titles, at times moody and dark, at others light and whimsical, sometimes within the same song.\n\nBaxter, Les: Barbarians. 180 gram LP.

Here is a samba-jazz hybrid that did its best to emulate the success of Ben's debut album \"Samba Esquema Novo\", with distinctive elements such as the trumpet that graces \"Capoeira\" and the choral backing of \"Carnaval Triste\"; as with his greatest works, the lyrics are full of humour and unusual references, deciphering the riddles part of the fun.

Survival Research (SVVRCH009). Street date: 27-09-19. One of Ben's most adventurous and abstruse albums made during the 70's! It's also one of the most rated by connoisseurs, though somewhat overlooked in general, offering lushly produced samba rock with shades of MPB.\n\nBenson, George: Irreplaceable. Trading Places (TDP54102). Street date: 31-03-23. Dating from 2003, when Benson had embraced the slick grooves of urban contemporary, this gatefold sleeve reissue comes complete with three songs that appeared on certain later editions, namely \"Softly, In A Morning Sunrise\", \"Take You Out\" and \"Arizona Sunrise\".\n\nBenson, George: Shape Of Things To Come.

Street date: 20-08-19. 180 gram vinyl reissue. In 1954 Boulez began staging a series of concerts of experimental music at the Petit Marigny theatre, Paris, titled Le Domaine musical. The pieces collected on this album are all taken from performances staged for the 1957 Domaine musical season, beginning with Berio's \"Serenata I\", conducted by Boulez, which debuted in Paris in March of that year; arranged for flute and fourteen instruments, Berio said that the idea behind the piece was for the solo flute to be confronted by continuously interchanging elements, rather than mere accompaniments or oppositions. Boulez' own \"Sonatine\", composed in 1946 for flute and piano, is a 12-tone piece that evidences Messiaen's influence, with shades of Asian classical music in places; then, Stockhausen's monumental \"Zeitmasze\" or \"Time Measures\", a serial composition for five woodwinds, played in different combinations of tempos and speed, was partly inspired by Webern's principles of homogenous and harmonic textures. Finally, Messiaen's 1949 work \"Cantéyodjayâ\", delivered by pianist Yvonne Loriod, takes it shape from the classical Hindu rhythms of ancient India, as with much of the composer's oeuvre.\n\nBernstein, Elmer: The Great Escape. 2LP Doxy Cinematic (DOC105).

Superior Viaduct (SV119). Street date: 26-01-17. This is not only Dixon's defining statement as a composer, but also one of the most luminous moments in the history of avant-garde jazz.

Closing each side of the album, \"Nightfall Pieces I\" and \"Nightfall Pieces II\" are evocative duets featuring Dixon's flugelhorn accompanied by flautist George Marge.\n\nBill Evans Trio: At Shelly's Manne-Hole.

This album was released in 1973 and the debut of the pianist's jazz career! Sporting a 20 years old Jon Eberson on guitar and the already mature (both musicians in their late 20's) rhythm section of Arild Andersen (28) and Jon Christensen (30), the album already profiled the pianist as a strong composer with weight on the melodic aspects!\n\nBlack Merda: S/T. Lilith (LR111LP). Street date: 29-11-19. Hailing from late 60's Detroit, Black Merda were both aesthetically and musically way ahead of their time. When most black groups (including Parliament/ Funkadelic) were still sporting suits, singing about love and using a horn section, Black Merda had already become a tight guitar-heavy freak-funk four piece. By weaving guitar rock and psychedelia into soul and R&B, they were the gods of the underground 'black rock' movement which fell somewhere between Jimi Hendrix and Parliament and MC5. But it wasn't just about the music, the message was just as important. As with the original release, features a 30-second 11th track not mentioned in the track listing "
