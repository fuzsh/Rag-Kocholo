        "text": "Into the Aryan Homeland.\n\nLouise’s call to the Fatherland came following her blacklisting by the Hollywood moguls. By 1929 many washed-up stars were thinking of departing Hollywood for European studios. As early as 1922, Mabel Normand began flirting with the British film industry, and, in 1924, she was ready to jump ship. If she had not received a lucrative theatrical offer in the States, then she might now reside under a cedar tree in London’s Ruislip cemetery, alongside that other Griffith discovery, Bessie Love. Both Bessie, and Keystone tearaway Bebe Daniels, were parents who feared the mob takeover of L.A. and the increasing risk of child kidnap for ransom.\n\nBrook’s role as Lulu in Georg Pabst’s film ‘Pandora’s Box’ was probably her greatest triumph, although, paradoxically, it contributed to the demise of her career. Of course Lulu was a German heroine, and so Louise was not particularly liked by the German populace, who felt a member of the ‘aryan race’ should have played the part. The film’s Lulu expresses herself through dance, and it has been assumed that Pabst chose Louise because she was a professional dancer. This, however, was not the case, and Pabst got the shock of his life, when Louise did the Lulu dance scene. He’d expected something on the lines of Asta Neilsen, who’d played Lulu in a previous film, using some amateurish\n\n‘dance’ steps. Pabst congratulated Louise on her performance, but then issued a decree that his Lulu was to be taken home from the studio every night, bathed, and then put to bed early. Nightclubbing was decidedly out of the question. Louise made two further films in Europe, Diary of a Lost Girl and Miss Europe. By the end of 1929, she was beginning to resent the treatment meted out to her by the German public, and, letting go of her study of the German language, she began to associate with some American ‘Hollywood-types’ that Pabst disapproved of – he was of the Mack Sennett possessive school of thought, and warned his star that she would end up like the Lulu of Pandora’s Box. Louise later realized Pabst was correct, but for now she wanted only to get home.\n\nBack in the U.S.A.\n\nLouise arrived back in New York in 1931, and was very soon contacted by Paramount, who were dubbing her silent movie The Canary Murder Case, and wanted to use Louise’s voice in the talkie version – she refused. Unfortunately, Paramount put it around that Louise voice recorded badly, and so could not be used. Rumors also began to spread around Hollywood that Louise was a lesbian, a consequence of the lesbian scene in Pandora’s Box, and that she had syphilis. It was around this time that Hollywood, attempted to clean itself up, and distance itself from the ‘sexually deviant’ cells supposed to exist in the town. However, Louise managed to find work, and made two films. As already stated, Louise was offered the part of the century in Public Enemy, but her rejection of the role got her well and truly blacklisted. She made one more film directed by fellow ‘reject’ Roscoe Arbuckle, then went bankrupt in 1932.\n\nShifting from Hollywood star to nightclub dancer in 1935, proved of little consequence to our resilient flapper. In 1936 she had a bit part in Western Empty Saddles, then, after growing her hair long, played the lead alongside John Wayne in Overland Stage Raiders in 1938. Following this, Louise moved back to Kansas, where she started a dance school. She’d been warned that if she hung around Hollywood any longer she’d become a call girl. Louise was not accepted back into Kansan society – she was hated by some for her stardom, and by others for being a failure, so, when the school went bust in 1943, she left for New York.\n\nDown and out in the Big Apple.\n\nIn N.Y. Louise found a media job in radio soaps for six months, and it was her wounded pride, and accusing glances from her peers that forced her to leave. She then had a couple of jobs with publicity agents, from which she was fired. Louise admits to being a ‘kept’ woman between 1948 and 1953, although she’d always been ‘kept’, whether by Charlie Chaplin, George Marshall, or a host of other men. Tiring of this life she ran off to be alone, but, unlike Mabel Normand, she had not accumulated a store of male-given jewels (in fact she usually turned these down, and accepted only fur coats, or in Chaplin’s case, checks). Her remaining friends abandoned her, and, almost penniless, she had to move to a grubby hole on 1st Avenue and 59th Street, where she soon developed thoughts of jumping out of the window. However, Louise was too proud to become a call-girl, although Pabst had once called her ‘a born whore’. After a collection of ‘friends’ in Hollywood gathered an annuity for her, Louise began to drink herself senseless in her festering rat hole, and was only saved by the renewed interest in silent movies. In France, Henri Langlois had put on an exhibition called Sixty Years of Cinema and had invited Louise along, to view some of her films. In the entrance hall there was a giant blow-up of Brooksie. This put Louise back on the map, and Langlois defended ‘nobody’ Louise by openly stating “There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, there is only Louise Brooks”. On the back of this new interest came James Card, director of the Rochester Film Museum. Card tracked Brooks down to her hovel in New York, and finding her in dire straits, took her away to Rochester. Once re-housed in that town, Louise was given a private showing of some of her old films, none of which she’d seen. Droves of media students began arriving at her apartment, and sat on her bed listening to her stories – by this time she was crippled with arthritis (the lot of the professional dancer). In 1977 Kevin Brownlow of Thames TV interviewed Louise and others for a documentary on Hollywood. Louise was fluent, and honest about her years in Tinseltown. Subsequently, she was famously interviewed by Richard Leacock for the documentary Lulu in Berlin. Although she’d destroyed her memoirs after the publication of Mack Sennet’s 1954 autobiography, she released a set of essays called Lulu in Hollywood in 1974. In this she was helped by Englishman and confirmed hedonist Kenneth Tynan. Louise Brooks died in 1985 from a heart attack. She’d been an invalid for more than 20 years.\n\nFinding the real Louise Brooks.\n\nLouise Brooks was a real, breathing woman who, whilst being somewhat unusual and anomalous, was not a goddess. It is only in our minds that the Goddess Louise exists. Many people have tried to make a case for her being similar in outlook to her peer, Clara Bow. It is clear, though, that Clara was schizophrenic, and was so diagnosed in the late 1940s. If anything, Louise, like perhaps Mabel Normand, was autistic. She seems to have had immense problems communicating with people, and translating what her real thoughts into words. This put her at a distinct disadvantage in Hollywood, where she was unable to develop close allies. Louise wanted to be loved, and her numerous affairs indicate this was the case. She also sought security with men of the millionaire type, but those same men tossed her aside like an old toy, as soon as they tired of the ‘goddess’. It is easy to put her in the same category as Mabel Normand, and this is logical, as Mabel was also keen on affairs, and even more keen on love triangles.\n\nIn spite of some people at the time claiming Mabel, like Louise, was a whore, there is no evidence that she indulged in any kind of sexual activity at all (“She was unusually pure” quoth the honest Adela Rogers St. Johns). Furthermore, she never sought relationships with married men. Louise, as we know, specialized in married men, especially those with a sackful of cash. At the end of the day, all Louise wanted was to put her feet up at home, while some rich guy made the dollars to keep her there. She would have ‘hooked’ Charlie Chaplin, if a scandal over the affair, a dodgy suit, and some risque photos hadn’t put an end to their designs. Of course, we can point the finger at Mabel and say she was just as bad. However, Mabel possessed one big advantage over Louise – she had many friends. By being in on the beginnings of American film, Mabel could count on the help of those numerous Biograph and Vitagraph girls (and one producer) who just about ruled Hollywood for nearly 20 years. Not only could members of this ‘royalty’ help each other, but they had a means of ‘starving out’ actresses they disapproved of – by the simple expedient of ostracism. Even the great Mae Marsh was blackballed by the Biograph club, and she had to make a public apology to the ‘girls’, when her sparkling career began to decline. Her crime? She’d starred in a Griffith film that ‘America’s Sweetheart’ and Mabel considered lewd. In the end it was the strengthening hand of the producers that did for Brooksie. Paradoxically, the demise of the old stars, brought about by new kids on the block such as Louise, enabled the likes of Zukor and De Mille to stub out the careers of actresses at will, and after very few years.\n\nSo who did Louise Brooks think she was? In her book she says she was a hedonistic and sexual being, but one who was constrained by the guilt of the Bible Belt. Now, we may think the Bible Belt is a religious region, but to Louise it was a virtual restrictive band that prevented those mid-westerners that “prayed in the parlor, and practiced incest in the barn” from talking openly about sex. Louise’s claim was that sexual guilt prevented her from publishing her complete autobiography, but it is clear that she made admissions enough in Lulu in Hollywood. In reality, perhaps, it was the continuing power of the movie producers that prevented her, like everyone else, from dishing the dirt on Hollywood – even Mack Sennett was unable to speak out on the less savory aspects of the town of dreams.\n\nBibliography\n\nLulu in Hollywood by Louise Brooks (1974).\n\nLove, Laughter and tears: My Hollywood Story by Adela Rogers St. Johns (1978)."
