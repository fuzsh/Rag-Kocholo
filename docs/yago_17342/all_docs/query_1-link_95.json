Despite her long absence, fans continue to hold out hope for her return.\n\nLulu Spencer’s Journey in General Hospital\n\nLulu Spencer made her debut on General Hospital in 1994 and quickly became a central figure. Over the years, various actresses have brought her to life, each contributing to her dynamic storyline.
