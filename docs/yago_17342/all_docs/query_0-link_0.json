While the student is at Lulu's house, her protector arrives and gives him the keys to the apartment. Mario, who had naively believed in Lulu's good faith, leaves the house upset. When she returns after some time, he no longer finds her than she does: she has left the apartment and returned to live with her parents, people of questionable principles, who suggest that their daughter pretend to be pregnant. Mario, feeling responsible, marries Lulu against the wishes of his family and continues his studies in Milan, finding accommodation in the countryside in a house left by his grandmother. Lulu begins to find country life boring and resumes an old relationship. When Mario is warned by an anonymous letter, he rushes home and surprises Lulu with her lover. The latter, threatened by Mario, shoots him, but hits Lulu who stood between the two.\n\nValentina Cortese - Lulù\n\nJacques Sernas - Mario\n\nLuigi Pavese - Stefano\n\nMarcello Mastroianni - Soletti\n\nPaola Borboni - Virginia\n\nLuigi Cimara - Farnesi\n\nMario Ferrari - Mister Franchi\n\nFlora Mariel - Teresa\n\nAnna Maria Padoan - Giustina\n\nUmberto Onorato - Suitor\n\nPina Piovani - Mrs. Salvi\n\nLaura Gore - The Venetian maid"
