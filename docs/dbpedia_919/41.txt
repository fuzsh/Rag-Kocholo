Hi all, been a while!

I'm not saying I'm reviving the route, let's get that out of the way first, merely I've find myself with a lot of time on my hands at the moment...

Anyhow, I've been having a little tinker with the route, just to see if any desire for route building returns.

Spent the last week on a station called Whitecraigs, which is on the Neilston line. Up to V4, the total extent of the Neilston line was a few hundred yards past Cathcart junction.

When I downed tools 4 years ago, I had only fully completed the following;

Giffnock to Clarkston on the East Kilbride line (along with 1/2 mile of scenery heading out of East Kilbride)

And from Muirend to Williamwood on the Neilston line.

More details on this old link.

Whitecraigs is the next station along from Williamwood and the extent of the trackwork.

Here are a few pics.

With that done, I'm now trying to add a station on another line, just struggling with the platforms (as was always the case!).

Hope all my old friends on here are well, stay safe!

Hi Mark, Bob, glad to see you're both doing ok.

This station is, and will continue to be a nightmare, there are many reasons why I did not put it in V4.

For some reason the distant mountains look awful here, so if the route is ever finished, I'll put a note in to turn off distant mountains if starting at this location (or stay in cab until a mile up the line). Odd thing is it is fine if you are heading to this station from the Glasgow direction.

It's a hard a station to replicate, a bridge under the station was a nightmare (fixing by cloning a shape and playing about in SFM) and I'm trying to give a feel of the real-life location, even though I don't have anything that looks like the station buildings.

Have downed tools while I go off to try and source a signal box, as this is a location which actually has one!

The reason I really want to try and complete this station is because it has a working terminus bay platform, so even though the main line continues, commuter services start from here which would be good for activity writers.

Station is starting to come to life now, and looking a little more like the real thing. It is above ground level so putting in walls down to ground level.

Slow progress as experimenting with different scenery, but will be worth it.

BAURHEED

The signal box was the clue.

Alas, progressed has stopped again. My last computer that ran MSTS is broken.

Can't even get anyone to look at it right now due to the current situation.

Hi Niall,

Sorry to hear that, mate

Is it physically broken or could it be a software malfunction? If it's the latter, it could possibly be repaired. Can you please tell us the symptoms of the 'breakdown'?

Cheers,

Ged
