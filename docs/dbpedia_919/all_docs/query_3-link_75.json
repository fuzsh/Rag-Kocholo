I understand that with games tickets transport in Zones G1 - G8 is free, I was planning to drive and park near Nitsill station but not sure if this is within the G1 - G8 zoning, it seems to be on the boundary looking at the SPT maps. Could any locals advise\n\nSponsor Post - registered members do not see these adverts; click here to register, or click here to log in\n\nR\n\nRailUK Forums\n\n12 Jul 2014\n\n#2\n\nJohn @ home\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n1 Mar 2008\n\nMessages\n\n5,148\n\nThis map shows Nitshill station within Zone G3.\n\n12 Jul 2014\n\n#3\n\nScottishIain\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n5 Aug 2013\n\nMessages\n\n89\n\nLocation\n\nNewmains\n\nNitshill, where I was brought up.

Has it re opened after the fire. If my memory serves me right it was a larger version of the traditional Scottish (housing scheme) pub - square concrete building \"an' nae windaes\". It had a reputation for shady ladies too - but I was much too young for that malarky!\n\nHow about parking on Nithsdale road (?) between Dumbreck & Maxwell Park stations. This area seems much more salubrious. When I have a large PNB at Central this is my walk of choice - casing all the \"big hooses\" for my nocturnal activities just like a latter day Deacon Brodie.\n\nLast edited: 14 Jul 2014\n\n13 Jul 2014\n\n#6\n\nGaryMcEwan\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n20 Aug 2013\n\nMessages\n\n1,604\n\nLocation\n\nBridgeton, Glasgow\n\nNitshill, where I was brought up.

But to the OP, most of the Spectator Service Shuttle services are leaving from BBS...\n\nLast edited: 13 Jul 2014\n\n13 Jul 2014\n\n#7\n\nreb0118\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Jan 2010\n\nMessages\n\n3,252\n\nLocation\n\nBo'ness, West Lothian\n\nWhat's the script with the hotel that you could see from the railway line?
