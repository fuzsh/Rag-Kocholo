        "text": "Published: 8 December 2023\n\nThe programme creates infrastructure that makes it easier for people to walk, wheel and cycle for every day journeys.\n\nThe primary focus of these projects is to create concept designs and engage with the community to ensure they are fit for purpose and meet the needs of users.\n\nThe five projects which will benefit from funding are:\n\nA77 Active Corridor - to consider how to integrate pedestrian crossing improvements, separated cycleways, bus priority measures and vehicle parking/loading on Ayr Road and Fenwick Road\n\nClarkston - Muirend Active Corridor - to propose improvements for active travel on Clarkston Road alongside two new foot/cycle bridges across railway lines in the area\n\nClarkston - Thornliebank Active Corridor - to consider how to integrate improvements for active travel with vehicle parking/loading on Eaglesham Road, Busby Road, Eastwoodmains Road and Rouken Glen Road\n\nLower Whitecraigs Community Link - to develop proposals to improve the public realm on Davieland Road and surrounding streets to enhance the gateway to Rouken Glen Park\n\nWytch Wood Community Link in Patterton - to investigate how to complete a 'missing link' off-road path to improve access to Patterton railway station.\n\nThese projects represent a significant step towards, creating more sustainable and inclusive transportation options for those who live, work and visit East Renfrewshire. They aim to tackle key barriers to active travel, such as main roads and busy junctions, and complete missing links in the active travel network.\n\nAtkinsRÃ©alis has been appointed as the consultants for all five projects and in the coming weeks, we'll share more detailed information about each project, including timelines, milestones, and opportunities for community involvement.\n\nCouncillor Danny Devlin, Convener for Environment and Housing, said: 'The projects which have been identified are an opportunity to connect communities and give more people the option to travel by active and sustainable modes. Lowering our carbon footprint and promoting a healthy lifestyle with safe and comfortable infrastructure is a key priority for the Council, so these projects have the ultimate goal of enhancing and promoting access to walking, wheeling, and cycling for individuals of all ages and abilities. Your input is invaluable, so I would encourage as many people as possible to participate in shaping these initiatives when engagement begins early next year.'\n\nTim Aeberli, Grant Manager for Sustrans, added: 'Each of these five active travel projects represents an important step in improving connections across East Renfrewshire communities and ensuring people have the option to walk, wheel, and cycle safely. We look forward to engaging as closely as possible with all those living and working in the area to make each of these exciting projects a huge success.'"
