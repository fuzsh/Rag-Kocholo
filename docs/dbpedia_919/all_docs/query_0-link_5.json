It is a two platform station. The main station building on the up platform still stands. Unfortunately the down platform building and signal box, opened with the station, have not survived.\n\nBecause the station has been adopted the station is well maintained and has plants and baskets adorning the platforms.\n\nThe goods yard is now a station car park. This was on the south side, approached from the west and above the station.\n\nThe signal boxes at Patterton and Whitecraigs closed in 1961, the section taken over jointly by the boxes at Neilston High and Muirend.\n\nTags\n\nStation"
