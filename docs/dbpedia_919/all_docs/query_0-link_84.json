        "text": "CoG I don't do it as a commute but I've done the trip a few times as I live in Killie and visit friends in West End of Glasgow. I also use the moors as a good weekend route.\n\nFrom Kilmarnock Railway Station you can get to the Western Road which has a cycle lane all the way out of Killie on the Glasgow Road. Go through Fenwick village and then under M77 to join old A77 road which has a super cycle lane made up on inside lane of old road but kerbed off from road. I'd not be worried about the trip over the moors (only about 8 miles from Fenwick to Mewton Mearns and there is always a few cars on the road).\n\nAt Newton Mearns there is a cycle lane all way to Eastwood Toll. Cycle route wants you to head off left to Thrornliebank but you can to straight on to where Tinto Firs Hotel used to be, turn left to round toll and either through Pollok Park or straight on towards St Andrews Drive, Nithsdale Road and Gower Street, over M8 and onto cycle route near Castle Grayskull which takes you over the Clyde.\n\nMight be worthwhile doing it one way for a while to try it out. Coming back is gently up hill all way out of Glasgow until about Floak so a bit sore on the legs as it is also usyually into the wind.\n\nYou can PM me if you want more details\n\nI go from the city centre to Irvine about 3 times a week, but will be changing my journey in the near future so am not a potential partner.\n\nI head for Newton Mearns on the A77 then cut across to the B769 and head for Stewarton.\n\nI hardly see any other cyclists at the moment, but with the lighter nights I'm sure there will be a few more. The hills have certainly benefited my fitness.\n\nThe profile of my journey means it's uphill for half the journey and downhill for the rest (which ever direction). I've not had problems with headwinds, though I did get borderline hypothermic this winter on a couple of trips as it is a bit exposed."
