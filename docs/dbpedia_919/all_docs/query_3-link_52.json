        "text": "Published: 13 July 2023\n\nThe hourly M7 bus will take residents from Maidenhill to Mearns Cross, Westacres Road, Stewarton Road, Patterton Railway Station, Rouken Glen Park, Eastwood Toll and Whitecraigs Rail Station.\n\nThe service was contracted by SPT, on behalf of East Renfrewshire Council, and will be operated by McGill's. Funding is in place until July 2026 and has been wholly funded by the Council from a levy on housing developers via the planning process.\n\nThe new service will operate seven days a week from 7am to 8pm Monday to Saturday and from 8.30am to 6pm on a Sunday. It also provides residents with a link to main line trains to and from Glasgow Central and Neilston.\n\nCouncillor Danny Devlin, Convener for Environment and Housing said: 'This new bus route is great news for residents living in Maidenhill. It will provide improved access to Newton Mearns, Greenlaw, Giffnock and beyond for the local community with frequent stops at many of our local amenities across East Renfrewshire. This new transport option not only provides new public transport options for shopping, work or leisure but will help to also reduce our carbon emissions in the long run.'\n\nSPT Chair, Councillor Stephen Dornan, said: 'SPT is delighted to have supported the Council in developing and securing this bus service, providing Maidenhill residents with more sustainable travel choices for their everyday local journey needs.\n\n'Funding from the housing developers provided the opportunity for the introduction of the service and its success will be seen through use by the local community. We hope that the new M7 service will prove popular and encourage people to switch from using their cars and travel in a more environmentally friendly way.'\n\nAnyone under 22 will travel for free on this service as long as they have a valid NEC or Young Scot NEC."
