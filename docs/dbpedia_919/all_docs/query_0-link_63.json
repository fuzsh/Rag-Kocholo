The main station building was on the Glasgow bound platform, with a waiting room opposite.\n\nWhen opened this station was in the countryside, Clarkston was a small settlement to the west of the station. It is now in a suburb of Glasgow.\n\nThe station had a goods yard to the north which was approached by reversing from the East Kilbride bound platform. It is now a car park. The signal box (1881) was at the north end of the southbound platform. In the station courtyard was a bus garage.\n\nThe box closed in 1966.\n\nA lattice footbridge still stands between the platforms and the main station building, a 1970s structure, stands on the Glasgow Central bound platform.\n\nAlthough no original station buildings survive there is an excellent example of a Caledonian Railway style railway cottage on Busby Road.\n\nTags\n\nStation\n\nExternal links\n\nCanmore site record\n\nNLS Collection OS map of 1892-1914\n\nNLS Collection OS map of 1944-67\n\nNLS Map\n\n07/11/2019"
