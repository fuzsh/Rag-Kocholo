For most of us, learning or creating is a process of trial and errorâ€”and for artist Alberto Giacometti, it was no different. Throughout his career, he worked iteratively, creating and re-creating, working and reworking the same forms. For example, he sculpted several versions of a bust of his brother Diego and made his figures thinner and thinner until they almost disappeared.",
