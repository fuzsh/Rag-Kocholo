        "text": "Cubism is a Western art movement consisting of many artists who had a profound impact on modern art. Cubist artwork features a fragmented composition representing the subject from all angles through overlapping geometric planes. Cubist artists reimagined conventional representation by rejecting the traditions of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening favored during the Renaissance. The result of this method was a layered, geometric composition that represented the subject from all angles simultaneously and with overlapping picture planes.\n\nCubism originated in France and was active between 1907 and 1914. Cubism consisted of two major phases: Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism. Analytic Cubism is the first major phase of Cubism that occurred between 1907 and 1912. Synthetic Cubism is the later phase of Cubism between 1912 and 1914.\n\nInitially, the Cubism art movement was not divided into Analytical Cubism and Synthetic Cubism. Only later would art historians, inspired by the writings of Cubist artists, label the initial phase of Cubism as Analytical Cubism and the latter as Synthetic Cubism.\n\n1. Pablo Picasso\n\nPablo Picasso was a Spanish artist born in Málaga, Spain in 1881 and died in 1973 in Mougins, France.\n\nPicasso studied art under his father, Spanish artist José Ruiz y Blasco, and at Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Spain. Picasso created artwork in many mediums, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, and collage.\n\nPicasso was one of the pioneers of Cubism and worked in the Cubist style throughout the movement’s two major phases: Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism. Picasso’s influences include African art, Neoclassicism, Symbolism, and Surrealism. The influence of Picasso’s art reaches almost every aspect of Western social culture, including subsequent art movements, theater pieces, and even Hollywood movies.\n\nPicasso’s artwork is housed internationally, in the permanent collections of many museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, and Museu Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nInteresting Facts About Pablo Picasso\n\nPicasso has had more works of art stolen than any other artist.\n\nPicasso produced over 150,000 artworks in his lifetime.\n\nPicasso’s last words, “Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can’t drink anymore,” inspired a Paul McCartney song.\n\n2.

Braque created artwork in many mediums, including painting, sculpture, and printmaking. Braque worked in the style of Fauvism before aligning with Cubism.\n\nBraque was first influenced by Impressionism but later adopted the style of Fauvism alongside Henri Matisse and André Derain. Then, the influence of Paul Cézanne led Braque to work with Pablo Picasso to develop Cubism.\n\nBraque’s artwork can be found in collections all over the world, such as the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art Rome, Musée National Picasso Paris, Tel Aviv Museum of Art Israel, and the Museum of Modern Art New York.\n\nInteresting Facts About Georges Braque\n\nOriginally, Braque trained to be a house painter and decorator with his father and grandfather.\n\nBraque was the first living artist to have a solo exhibition at the Louvre in Paris.\n\nBraque would leave a painting unfinished for many years, returning throughout, which explains the intermingling of early and late Cubist style in many of his works.\n\n3.

In 1924, he designed ballet sets and costumes for the famous Ballets Russes.\n\nJuan Gris’ work is on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York and Tate Modern London.\n\nInteresting Facts About Juan Gris\n\nJuan Gris’ real name is José Victoriano González-Pérez.\n\nGris worked as a satirical cartoonist until 1911.\n\nGris coined the term Analytical Cubism to describe the first major phase of Cubism.\n\n4.

Between 1904 and 1907 Metzinger worked in the Divisionist and Fauvist styles with a strong Cézannian component, leading to some of the first proto-Cubist works.\n\nMetzinger’s artwork is housed in over 20 museums worldwide including Tate Gallery London, National Galleries Scotland, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and National Gallery of Victoria, Australia.\n\nInteresting Facts About Jean Metzinger\n\nJean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes’ Du Cubisme influenced Niels Bohr’s discovery of the principle of complementarity in quantum theory.\n\nMetzinger’s great-grandfather, Nicolas Metzinger, served in the French military under Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nMetzinger was able to fully support himself through painting by age 20.\n\n6.
