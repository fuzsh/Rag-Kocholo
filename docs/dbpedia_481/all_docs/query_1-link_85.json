        "text": "STAMPA\n\n“Giacometti” is the surname of of four artists: Alberto, famous the world over for some 40 years now; his brother Diego, whose reputation seems to grow daily; Giovanni, their father, a much respected painter in his time; and Augusto, second cousin to Giovanni—they had the same grandfather—and at the very least as well regarded.\n\nA second name is little known, almost secret—I am tempted to call it the Giacometti secret, the hidden, common source for bodies of work otherwise so different: Stampa. This is the name of a village of a few hundred inhabitants in the Bregaglia, a high valley in the canton of Grisons, between Switzerland and Italy, which used to be very difficult to get to, and which—a sign of its isolation, but also of its self-assurance—speaks its own Italian dialect. The four Giacomettis were born there, and neither distance, nor success, nor presence in the most cosmopolitan, most advanced artistic circles ever stopped them from returning to it again and again. The Giacometti oeuvres offer an occasion to ask questions about the double mystery of family spirit and spirit of place, and about the ways in which their effects may circulate and intervene. That occasion is now rare, for though it is not uncommon to find great artistic ability running in families between the time of Bruegel and that of Tiepolo, or perhaps of Guardi, there are hardly any striking examples in the 20th century, besides the Giacomettis and the quartet of three brothers and one sister made up of Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Villon, and Suzanne Crotti.\n\nIt almost seems that it was the mission of Augusto and Giovanni Giacometti to prefigure the two broad avenues that would be explored by experimental art in the 20th century. Augusto, moving from Art Nouveau and Symbolism to abstraction by way of spiritualism, is a perfect illustration of what might be called the “nocturnal” slope of the Modern, while Giovanni, evolving from realism to Post-Impressionism to a kind of Fauvism, stands as a perfectly acceptable incarnation of its “solar” side. However divergent their courses, they also resemble each other in a number of respects, particularly their shared optimism. This was a brand of confidence that a quarter century later would prove totally lacking in Giovanni’s son Alberto, who labored to establish the possibilities of working on the barest of foundations, of pursuing the most modest of quests—that of adhering as narrowly as possible to the limited and practically blind vision that one has of the things and beings that surround one—to such a degree as virtually to deny himself the hope of attaining the permanence of what, echoing André Malraux, he was wont to call a style. Yet thanks to Diego, this seemingly down-to-earth vision, this private scream, nonetheless proved its mettle by engendering a general language, or, at least, a language that could be generalized—in short, a style. A germane vocabulary, a germane syntax emerged, here in the anguished doubts of the artist, there in the smiling sureness of the artisan.\n\nWith the Giacomettis, the family factor works sometimes like a game of mirrors, sometimes like a prism, now reflecting, now refracting the art they made, fragmenting its elements and reuniting them, bouncing them around. The most obvious manifestation of this interaction is provided by the portraits they painted, sculpted, and drew of one another, which played an important role in their evolution, most clearly in the case of Alberto. But there are other, more subtle examples. Alberto, for instance, started off as a painter, taking up the pictorial language of his father, who for his part produced the most “Modernist” canvases of his career during his son’s years of apprenticeship. After Alberto’s conversion to sculpture, and sudden boldness in his new field, Giovanni returned to a more temperate art, as if to compensate. One could say that it was out of a similar urge to compensate that Diego became a sculptor during World War II: his brother was stuck in Switzerland, and the Paris atelier where Diego had helped him cast and patinate works, and where they had collaborated on pieces of furniture and decorative objects, had fallen silent. When Alberto returned, more active than ever, Diego once again limited his own production, but he let loose again, with even greater energy, after the death of the older brother whose attentive helper he most dearly wished to be.\n\nThe art and the person of Augusto Giacometti may seem completely untouched by the ebbs and flows that characterize the intimate, intense rapport which binds his three distant relatives. “In Zurich, when he walked into a restaurant that we were in,” recalls Bruno Giacometti, younger brother to Diego and Alberto, “he would never sit at our table.” The chromatic opulence, so daringly invertebrate, of the work of this lover of Fra Angelico lies poles away from Giovanni’s highly constructed compositions and from Alberto’s gray obsession. Yet Alberto once confided to me, “I don’t intentionally limit my range of colors. I just can’t concentrate on color and composition at the same time. I dream of light, pretty, suave colors—like Fra Angelico’s. But I can’t bring myself to put them on canvas.”\n\nAugusto’s paintings would have nothing in common with Giovanni’s, or with Alberto’s were it not for the landscapes they all made of the Bregaglia. Yet these common motifs bring out further the contrast among their individual approaches. In Stampa, in the narrowest quarters, two opposite esthetics coexisted, Augusto’s nocturnal and Giovanni’s solar. But is this divergence not exactly the peculiar characteristic of the place? In the Bregaglia, a few steps apart from one another, are the sources of different streams, some flowing toward the Rhine, others toward the Danube, just as the careers of Augusto and Giovanni are oriented respectively toward symbolism and realism. Stampa: extreme location, location of extremes. Place of the passage from North to South, and of the parting of waters, climates, and civilizations, yet at the same time inaccessible. If Giovanni’s Steinträgerinnen im Bergel (The stone-bearers of the Bregaglia, 1895–96), which he showed in 1897 at the Bündner Kunstmuseum Chur, is still there today, it is because an avalanche cut off the road that went through the Bregaglia Valley (there was no railroad in those days), and he thought it easiest simply to leave it there. Forsaken by the sun during the winter months, turned in on itself, the Bregaglia, under the thumb of a harsh nature, goes back to the conditions, the motions, the rhythms of archetype.\n\nOn one side in the Bregaglia is infinity, that unthinkable hinterland of peaks dissolving into the “great, gaping void” that Alberto speaks of in relation to Jacques Callot, and that would dig itself—the Grund (bottom) becoming Abgrund (“Bottomless bottom,” “abyss”)—into every figure he sculpted, painted, or drew. On the other is the close-to-home, the intimate, the little—“To be the right size for me,” said Alberto, “people must be small. To see small is to see true. . . . ” In Die Lampe (The lamp, 1912), Giovanni’s masterpiece, family and familiar objects, people and things gather around the dinner table as if fortifying themselves against the hovering, threatening enormity of the environment surrounding them. At Stampa, finite humanity and infinite space touch without any transition to temper the intensity of the confrontation, which haunts Alberto’s art. While one can interpret the work in metaphysical terms, then, it actually reports faithfully on a strictly physical situation: at the high altitude of the Bregaglia, everything is simplified, reduced to essentials to such a degree that the barrier between physics and metaphysics disappears. The peasant woman coming home from the fields, the shepherd walking on the mountain path—the immensity that surrounds them imbues them with a presence such that we think we recognize in them the paradigms of human destiny. The visual flows straight into the visionary. “In fact,” wrote Augusto, “I have never been content simply to ‘sit myself down before nature’ in order to do more or less well by it through colors. Something in me has always aspired to a knowledge of color itself.” This is surely not the path that Alberto would follow to get beyond the realm of appearances, though he too was for a while engaged by the idea of creating “parallels” to nature, “free”—this is Augusto again—“of any objective reality.” Evidently, a kind of familial headstrongness led these Giacomettis to do nothing by halves. “Like any loyal son of the Bregaglia,” Augusto continued, “I have always been very serious.”\n\nThe ability to live out the most radical contradictions would appear to be a specific trait of the Bregaglia, and of its inhabitants. One finds oneself bouncing back and forth, without transition, from the local to the universal. We are apt to discover these entrenched villagers as pastry chefs in Poland, Modena, Marseilles, Genoa, Rome, as professors of literature in Bologna, as college deans in Zurich, as publishers of Dante in Warsaw. These mountain folk transform themselves without struggle into Grossstädter, citizens of the world: the most famous cabaret in Paris, Le Chat Noir, was started by a native of the Bregaglia, Rodolphe Salis. Here, the archaic and the ultramodern meet. The Giacomettis didn’t have running water until 1927, but Giovanni himself had installed gas pipes in the house by 1913. Before 1920, he would read to Bruno by the light of an oil-burning lamp—the book was about Gauguin, and in the original French.\n\nThe Giacomettis could travel to Munich, Paris, Florence with no difficulty in the transition from their alpine solitude. The expressionists of Die Brücke discovered Parisian Fauvism through Giovanni Giacometti and his friend Cuno Amiet. Augusto taught Seurat’s Farbenlehre (theory of colors) to Florentine students; in 1916, he took part in the meetings of the Dadaists. In 1932, Giovanni’s colleagues thought him crazy to have come all the way from Stampa to Zurich for Picasso’s first retrospective, at the Kunsthaus there. Was there ever a more Parisian artist, an artist more aware of current trends in art, than Alberto? Cosmopolites up at Stampa, they could perversely reveal themselves as bergalliotes, as Bregaglians, in the hubbub of the lands below. Something in them resisted the general drift, avoided any group orientation. On occasion, this “seriousness” slowed them down in relation to their contemporaries: awareness of a time lag, for instance, struck Giovanni with singular force between 1896 and 1899, plunging him into a deep crisis, not unlike the one Alberto would experience some 40 years later. Routinely, they would all repair to Stampa to replenish their strength and courage. Every year, Alberto would disappear from his atelier on the rue Hippolyte-Maindron—which, incidentally, he had successfully transformed into the kind of crude environment appropriate to an outpost of Stampa.\n\nWhile it was in Munich, Paris, and Florence that the Giacomettis perfected the language that enabled them to express themselves, what they had to say was revealed to them at Stampa. There, Giovanni encountered the settings and figures that he would raise from the level of anecdotal reality to that of exemplary symbol by distilling their shapes and gestures to a state of essential nakedness—a process whose possibility he had glimpsed in theory through the work of Honoré Daumier, Francois Millet, Puvis de Chavannes, Camille Pissarro, Ferdinand Hodler, and Giovanni Segantini. The objective correlatives of the fields of pure, saturated color that Augusto painted around 1917 are the mountain pastures he saw engulfed by spring flowers. Diego enlivened his tables and consoles with a repertory of forms lifted from Memphis, Etruria, Alexandria, Rome, and the Paris flea market, but he mounted them—positioned their supports, determined their junctions and joints—with the tentative yet infallible precision of a mountaineer checking his grip during an ascent. Finally, we have seen to what extent the opposition between constrained figure and unfathomable depth—the theme and the scheme of Alberto’s entire body of work—is rooted in the bergalliote experience. That experience turns out to be eminently suited to our historical juncture, to the particular anxiety of this hour in which we live, and that is why, far though we may be from Stampa, the art of Alberto Giacometti speaks to us in a language we instantly understand: a man emerges from nothingness, drawn out, stretched out, by the narrow corridor through which he moves, a corridor whose high walls might equally be cliffs looming over a mountain gorge and the buildings that border the flow of a Paris street.\n\nALBERTO GIACOMETTI\n\nAt the end of World War II, at the very moment of the victory of abstraction, Alberto Giacometti, who had long been one of abstraction’s most remarkable practitioners, chose to dedicate himself once and for all to an endeavor that he himself deemed “completely absurd, impossible”: to copy reality.\n\nCertainly others had approached the task before, over several millennia, without it seeming unrealizable, and truth be told it was not unrealizable—as long as it wasn’t apprehended as such. It was the consciousness of the irreducible difference between the self and the world, between signs and things, that finally made the belief in the elements of shared identity between a model and its representations, the basis for all figurative art, seem like a myth without moorings. (“I am not creating a woman,” Henri Matisse used to say, “I am painting a painting.”) Since this mental trap lies at the very heart of the Modern, and since Alberto was a profoundly Modem artist, his pessimistic diagnosis should come as no surprise.\n\nOn the other hand, his stubbornness in attempting this self-avowedly impossible task can hardly be explained as a simple desire to fly in the face of his contemporaries. One can but take him at his word when he insisted that through all the many contradictory phases of his work, in plaster, on canvas, or on paper, he never wanted anything other than to capture “resemblance,” which in earlier times had been seen as proof positive of an individual’s connection to the world. For the joy of resemblance—in other words, the joy of a world before rupture—was a joy he had known:\n\nAs a child, I tended to want to illustrate stories. And then, soon enough, I started to draw from nature, and was under the impression that I had such utter control over things that I felt I was doing exactly what I wanted. The pretensions I had when I was ten. . . . I admired myself, I had the impression that I could do everything, with this wonderful tool, drawing—that I could draw anything, that I saw more clearly than anyone. And by the time I was about 14 I had started to make sculpture, a little bust. And with that too, everything worked out! I had the impression that there was no discrepancy between my vision and my ability to make. I could control my vision, it was paradise, and it lasted until I was around 18 or 19.\n\nAs Alberto’s watercolors from those days so clearly demonstrate, achieving this particular state of resemblance was for him a form of child’s play—or, more precisely, of son’s play. All in all, resemblance was for him not only a sign that art and the world functioned as half brothers, but also a sign that the artist was of a piece with his family. Alberto’s first busts were, by his own admission, of his brothers Bruno and Diego. Once he had taken his first step into abstraction, at some point after 1925, almost the only works wherein likeness survives are those representing his father and mother. And when, around 1935, he once again began to investigate reality through his sculpture, Diego became his favorite model. After two years of this kind of searching, he painted Portrait de la mère de l’artiste (Portrait of the artist’s mother, 1937), the great totemic image poised at the threshold of his ultimate return to the real, which seems to surge ex nihilo, or rather ex illo tempore, from that pre-Modern past wherein painting was a family matter, a matter of happiness. “My father,” Alberto wrote to Charles de Noailles on July 3, 1933, “was an infinitely good and kind person. He made some very beautiful paintings and met a wonderfully gentle death.” It is noteworthy as well that both Portrait de la mère de l’artiste and his other watershed painting, La Pomme (The apple, 1937), were painted at Stampa, which Augusto Giacometti had actually nicknamed—or at least had nicknamed a corner of the place, the corner he most liked to paint in—“Paradise.”\n\nThe expulsion from paradise coincides with the moment of Alberto’s arrival in Paris, in 1921:\n\nReality escaped me. Before, I had been convinced that I saw everything very clearly, I had felt a kind of intimacy with the all, with the universe. . . . Then, all of a sudden, things became foreign. You are you, and there outside is the universe, which has quite precisely become obscure. . . .\n\nHe practically stopped painting for a time, no doubt because painting was the terrain whereupon the rupture first registered. His drawings from the early ’20s seem bent on reducing the model to a play of even facets, as if to prove that a human being is like a vein of ordinary rock within which there sleeps a crystal, waiting to be woken up. This “cubism” is of double value: it is the keeper of a presence (matter) and of a truth (the idea of the body). For Giacometti had not really stopped copying reality. The difference is that it was now more imagined than observed. “I would never start a sculpture until I could visualize it clearly enough to realize it. On the day I would make it, I would build it in as little time as possible, the minimal time it takes to realize something. It was no longer so much a matter of sculptures as a matter of objects.” During this entire period, drawings and objects were a parallel means of figuring out a mental reality.\n\nThis mental reality is neither gratuitous nor arbitrary. The old family story still preoccupies Alberto; it is the mythic body that confers meaning and life on the relationship between artist and model. His sculptures from these years have titles like “man,” “woman,” “couples.” He became engrossed with African art and Oceanic art, not only because they provided him with formal solutions, but also and especially because while they do not depend on realistic representation and do not try to deny the radical difference between a work of art and its model, they nonetheless participate in the reality of the model. One can understand why Giacometti was able to call this “a fairly happy period.”\n\nIt didn’t last long. By 1930, the peaceful plenitude of works such as Femme-cuillère (Spoon-woman, 1926), Le Couple (Homme et femme) (The couple, or Man and woman, 1926), Homme (Apollo) (Man, or Apollo, 1929), or Femme couchée (Reclining woman, 1929) was gone. What happened was that the rupture between the work of art on one side and its model on the other, which until then had been limited to the domain of the gaze, reached the ground of the spirit. From that point on, Alberto would never again “construct” harmonious images, but only wrenching ones. An unbridgeable fault opened up for him between man and woman, between artist and model, both fueling desire and preventing its gratification.\n\nSurrealism came just in time to suggest to Alberto some ways in which to stage this mental theater of cruelty and frustration, which expresses, albeit in the negative, his one and only ambition: to restore unity between art object and model through resemblance. In Pointe à l’oeil (Point to the eye, 1932) his younger brother Bruno’s experience of posing for him is literally petrified. It was a terrifying affair. “Usually so gentle, so nice,” according to Bruno, the sculptor “became a tyrant the moment he was in front of his model.” Bruno, who was to become an architect, has this to add: “He had a pair of old, rusty, iron calipers with which he took measurements of my head. It used to frighten me when he moved its sharp points near my eyes.” In Circuit, 1931, a ball rolls within a groove indefinitely, unable ever to attain a hole situated outside the circuit. In Boule suspendue (Suspended ball, 1930), a hanging ball grazes a crescent shape, unable to touch it. In Fleur en danger (Endangered flower, 1933), a head lies underneath a menacing catapult. Sometimes the psychodrama unfurls within the more or less narrative context of a miniature theater stage or square. Confrontations between male and female, life and death, fertility and sterility, separation and motion (Palais à quatre heures [Palace at 4 A.M.,1932], Modèle pour une place [Model for a square, 1932]), are all symbolic projections of the relationship that unites and divides artist and model.\n\nThe visions that possessed Alberto, with the ferocity of thwarted love, made him the most convincing of the Surrealist sculptors. They forced him to come up with such plastic solutions as the “cage” (a kind of three-dimensional frame) and the horizontal extension, which have been seen ever since in a considerable wealth of sculpture. For him, the compression to horizontality of works such as On ne joue plus (The game is over, 1931) and Femme égorgée (Slaughtered woman, 1932) is nothing more or less than one of the many ways in which sculptures resist or escape the condition of the object imprisoned in its perfection. Flattening a work to the point where it’s almost a slab (Tête qui regarde [Looking head, 1927–28]), thinning it down to nearly nothing (Figurine, 1946–47), amplifying a detail (La Jambe [Leg, 1958]), elongation (Femmes de Venise [Venetian women, 1956]), the flattening of a torso and its placement, at a right angle, against a sharp prow of a face (Buste de Diego [Bust of Diego, 1954])—again and always, all of these are techniques for the impossible project of copying the real, a project that, between 1930 and 1935, gave rise to these works that lend themselves to a Modernist reading. This very impossibility is what provides them with their language—the emotionally charged language of censorship, frustration, taboo. The one thing that Alberto truly aspired to make real was the invisible object in the hands of the woman he sculpted in L’Objet invisible, 1934–35, at the end of this period.\n\nIn 1935, almost by accident, Giacometti once again took it upon himself to shape a head using a professional model. A few sittings, he thought, would do the trick: thirty years later, on the eve of his death, he would still be working on it. “A head?” exclaimed André Breton, disapproving, “but we know very well what a head is!” Precisely: we know it, but we don’t see it. Representations of a reality that we think we know are, in truth, only so many montages of conventional elements. That kind of representation is indeed of little interest compared to images engendered by the imagination. On the other hand, what we see à l’oeil nu, “with a bare eye,” is far more unheard of, more fantastic, more terrifying—as Alberto would never stop saying—than the products of dreams. His return to the practice of working after nature was not a return to realism—last of a long list of many conventional systems designed to make us take what we know for what we see—but an apprenticeship in looking, in vision. In choosing, regardless of everything, to live out “a story of the eye” (to borrow the title of a book written by Georges Bataille, one of his closest friends), he distanced himself simultaneously from his Surrealist colleagues, from those artists exploring abstraction, and from those for whom the only alternative to the nonfigurative was a traditional, realist figuration. He was alone.\n\nTo be sure, his could be a discouraging task. Alberto took an indirect approach. Working his way backward, as it were, on the old road, he first realized a few polyhedral sculptures, such as Tête cubiste (Cubist head, 1934). Its geometric form, one might say, is a protective envelope within which lives a human form, waiting to be discovered by the eye. On one of the facets of Cube, 1934, is engraved a self-portrait of the artist, as the contents of a package may be listed on its wrapping. Alberto’s extension of Cézanne’s technique of faceting, which aimed at capturing volume, is actually a refined version of his incremental adjustments between the constructed image and observed appearances. Finally, rather than tackle the figure head-on, in flesh and bone, Alberto often preferred to approach it obliquely during these years, through the bias of “copies” from preexisting works: Chaldean or Roman statues, Egyptian murals, Byzantine mosaics, Rembrandt paintings, and so on. His copies slide away from what, to our eyes, is conventional in those works, away from what seems subject to a style, and move toward what was “visual” about them for their creators and original audiences, what they had that originally resembled reality. By releasing the visual vitality of these seemingly stylized works, Alberto encouraged himself to think that the bridges between art and reality might not, in fact, all be broken.\n\nIt is significant that this demonstration took place in drawings. During the ten previous years, drawings had played at best a secondary role in Alberto’s art, while painting had practically ceased to exist. Now, drawing reappeared. Henceforth, it would play the leading role. “What must be said, what I believe, is that when it comes to sculpture or paintings, drawing is the only thing that counts.” Sculpture and even painting, because of their ability to imitate nature, allow us to make illusions for ourselves—Pygmalion was a sculptor, Zeuxis a painter. This becomes a difficult proposition with drawing, and altogether impossible when it comes to line drawing. As Delacroix and Cézanne both noted, there are no lines in nature. In giving himself up entirely to linear drawing, Alberto denied himself any possibility of believing, and of making others believe, in that unity of identity between image and model that once, before his Modernist crisis, he had experienced with such pleasure. The gulf between image and model is immense and irredeemable; drawing, far from lessening it, digs it deeper, because it both heightens the experience of seeing and underlines the difference between what is seen and what has been made. “It’s completely absurd, impossible.”\n\nConversely, what is possible is to make visible the abyss. Once, in illo tempore, to copy was to effect union, to abolish distance. In Alberto’s time, to copy was to denote distance, to activate it. In seeking to create a figure that resembles, Alberto was activating the void. “I only recognize people when they’re on the other side of the street.” In a famous text of 1946, Le rêve, le sphinx et la mort de T. (The dream, the sphinx, and the death of T.), he wrote:\n\nThis morning when I awoke, I saw my towel as if for the first time, that weightless towel in a stillness never seen before, and as if suspended in a dreadful silence. It no longer had any connection to the chair without bottom or to the table whose legs no longer quite rested on the floor, barely touched it, there was no longer any connection among objects separated by the incommensurable chasms of the void.\n\nThis description applies directly to what we see in his drawings. They do resemble, but the reality that they represent is no longer an Edenic union of signs and things, but the actual reality of separation, the painful duality wherein unity (the possibility of making art that partakes of the essence of their models) survives only in a state of necessary nostalgia—necessary, because the abyss only reveals itself to those who attempt to bridge it.\n\nThe void—the blankness of the paper—surges up through the interstices of Alberto’s drawings, eating away at objects and people, dissolving them. It flows around them in his paintings, as if come from bottomless depths, unthinkable distances, against the vertigo of which a false frame is sometimes erected within the painting, like a mock rampart. Finally, we may say of his sculptures what he used to say about the work of Henri Laurens: “We can never really get close to Laurens’ sculptures, there is always a space, of indeterminable expanse, separating us from them, a space that surrounds the sculpture and which is yet the sculpture itself. . . . ”\n\nA void is a physical quantity; the void is at once a physical quantity and a metaphysical notion. What is manifest in Alberto’s work is not a void, but, for the first time in the history of art, the void. In his drawings and paintings the figure/ground relationship is reduced to its simplest, most dramatic expression. The figure, usually isolated, is no longer encamped on a background that is rendered solid and supportive by its assigned mission of expressing some precise, mappable place. Nor has that figure been plopped into an expanse that depends, for the determination and definition of its surface, on the procedures of some schema. The figure inscribes itself, for want of better words, à fond perdu, “in a lost ground,” in an indefinable space, a space without limits, wherein it is but a shipwreck drifting in an ocean before going under.\n\nTo be honest, it wasn’t quite right to say that such a space had never before been revealed. It can be perceived in early Christian art; it had hollowed itself out in the Byzantine and Roman sculptures, paintings, and mosaics that Alberto so loved. Nevertheless, paleo-Christian space differs from the gaping space of Alberto’s work on a crucial point: because of the presence of the sacred, the void revealed between the third and sixth centuries A.D. carries its figures as water carries bodies. Far from being hopeless, that ground is redeemed—it is an emptiness that is in fact a kind of plenitude, a space filled with the amniotic fluid of the divine. The sacred does not saturate the void into which Alberto’s figures have been plunged. “God is dead,” wrote Mallarmé “and the void has set itself where once was God.” The ground revealed in Giacometti’s work is truly lost, or, more exactly, it is the cause of loss: figures sink into it. Reinhold Hohl rightly described Alberto’s portraits as “secularized icons”—icons because their frontality, their solemnity, the awareness they carry of a place where humanity is not master, are of the essence of religious imagery; secularized (rather than secular) because the sacred has left the bed that it had made for itself (and that it alone could fill). Bataille said that the absence of God is the last god: Albeno’s figures exist under the sign of this final divinity.\n\nIf it is true that major works of art express the cultural horizons of the historical moments that give rise to them, then no artist more faithfully than Alberto has taken stock of the vertiginous collapse of certainty in which we live. If one is to show the ocean in its full terror, a foaming reef, a tree trunk tossed by waves, will not suffice; a person drowning in it is required. To surge in their complete objective horror, their unbendable otherness, the depths demand that the figure be reduced to a state of pure subjectivity. That is what happens in the work of Alberto Giacometti. Whether in the sculptures, the paintings, or the drawings, he never permits us to lull ourselves with the illusion that something stable has slipped in. This was, surely, his goal.\n\nAlberto’s drawing seeks not to measure up to its models but to take their measure, in the hope that if through sheer precision it coincides with them, that act of measurement, which is a gesture of the artist, will cease to be a concern, and, transcending the gulf between itself and them, the drawing will marry itself to its models so tightly that it will become one with them. But the drawing’s traces and lines never manage exactly to coincide with the model. The model lives, moves, is already elsewhere. It is therefore necessary to triangulate again and again, to measure and remeasure ad infinitum. Thus is born, bit by bit, the slightly blurred image of a face, a chair, or a coffeepot, blurred not because the pencil hesitated but on the contrary because of its unfailing precision, so unfailing, in fact, that it knows not how to mask its own defeat. Each line, taken by itself, captures only the skin or hide of a presence, necessitating another attempt, each a little different, in a slightly different place. The quiver of life that characterizes Albeno’s drawn or painted figures is the sum total of these lines, each of which is a portrait of a cadaver. Likewise, in their multiplication of contradictory realistic observations, the sculptures of the artist’s last period undo the deathly fixity of the traditional sculptural portrait—twice deathly in that the frozen resemblance coincides with the inertness of the supporting medium. As is the case with the paintings, the sculptures too are “drawn”: the sense of blurredness, the sort of invisible fog that forms a nimbus around heads and bodies, are the results of an accumulation of sharply pointed notations. The moment one thinks one recognizes the model, it disappears again. No less than the earlier Boule suspendue and Main prise (Trapped hand, 1932), these works are mechanisms made to frustrate desire.\n\nFrustration, by distancing desire from its object, always brings us back to the one experiencing it. Unable to find definitive rest through fusion with the model, the work calls attention to the artist as he makes it. Unlike the model, it remains active and intensely and incessantly present throughout the working process. Paintbrush and pencil come and go, describe circles, shuttle back and forth. Fingers run tirelessly along slabs of clay, kneading, pinching, torturing the earth. Everywhere, at every moment, the artist’s hand declares itself, forbidding the operation of the illusion that art had so long sought: at no time may the work of art be taken for an object from nature.\n\nHowever, the hand is not free. It obeys a harsh law; this is nowhere clearer than in those rare instances where lines rebel, become hysterical, stretch out chaotically, like springs suddenly rid of the weights that compress them and keep them in place. The hand does not labor freely, without restriction. It does not seize the model: the law is that it must pursue it. Albeno’s drawing, painting, and sculpture make visible not a body, not even the placement of a body, but, rather, the process of a body. They show not objects but rather the orbits of objects.\n\nThat movement is not, or is only barely, the movement of the object or model itself. (Alberto would not tolerate the slightest change of posture in those sitting for him.) The more or less perpetual motion that animates the portraits is the motion transmitted to his hand by his eye, an eye that is forever coming, going, surveying, and measuring. For the first time, an artist gives us an image not of the model per se, but of the model looked at, a model, in other words, that lives through the precarious, hazardous life of the artist. The true model for Alberto’s late works, a model more elusive with every line, every trace of pigment, every stroke of the knife’s edge—the invisible motor of these works, so full of movement—is the gaze.\n\nWe know that Alberto was increasingly fascinated with the idea of the gaze as he neared the end of his life. “The difference between the dead and the living is the gaze.” His last portraits, according to his own account, attempt first and foremost to capture the act of looking. Perhaps this is because that act is ultimately the only one that may be shared by both the One and the Other—the artist and his model. Giacometti’s itinerary is a story of the eye because, once the Edenic link that he had known in his childhood between signs and things had been destroyed, only the gaze could restore it, though at the price of a consciousness relentlessly aware of the irreparable gulf between them. Alberto’s surrealist sculptures are dramas in which the act of looking is the frustrated hero. Later on, characters coming and going without being able to connect—often under the gaze of some bodiless head, victoriously recording this defeat—translate this oneiric theater into “realistic” scenes. Toward the end, Alberto would manage to do without these dramatic projections, for what was intended through these narrative forms could express itself totally in the substance of the work, through what I will call his “ocular” style.\n\nTo seize a face, a body, or a tree by appropriating its likeness, as Alberto always said, is to attempt the impossible, but the attempt has nothing absurd about it: that impossibility is what makes possible the revelation of the gaze. Hopelessly beyond reach, desired to the point of distraction, the model exists, so to speak, in negative form, like what is defined by the hands of the woman in L’Objet invisible. Albeno’s figures are saturated not with presence but with absence. His return to tile figure was never a renunciation of the critical consciousness that forbade Modem art to address figuration, which at the time seemed too tightly linked to an unacceptable illusionism. He practiced a figuration without illusion. Any attempt to make us believe in illusion would automatically be a denial of the divide that exists between what is and what is made. The loss of illusion is compensated for by the emergence of a new state of art, a state wherein representation and presence, the action of the eye and the gesture of the hand, become one. By following the trajectory of the gaze as it seeks to wrench some external likeness out of the void and stumbles instead against absence, the hand replaces the illusion of representation with the artist’s own presence.\n\nBut it can only achieve this on the condition that it does not try to achieve it, and, thus, that it try to achieve something else. It wants resemblance, which, if you think about it, is an expression of defeat. Things only look alike when they are apart. In the paradisiac state of unity, and under the light of the sacred—in the earliest art, or, sometimes, in religious art—the issue of resemblance among beings and things does not arise, since the spirit of consubstantiation excludes that of separation. For a long time, let us say from the Renaissance until the beginning of the Modern age, art lulled itself with the illusion that resemblance might stand in for that lost coidentity. Alberto put an end to this false lure, but gave a new meaning to the idea of resemblance, and a new goal to its quest: to effect an act of coherence, despite the disappearance of all external, binding principles of coherence. For the light of the first, Edenic time he substituted a principle for the dark of modern time (let us not call it the end of time): lucidity of vision.\n\nDIEGO GIACOMETTI\n\nAn old adage has it that happy peoples have no history; the same might go for artists. While a flood of commentary has not begun to exhaust the subject of Alberto Giacometti, I will abstain from something long on Diego, the more willingly since anything other than complete discretion would have displeased him deeply.\n\nInseparable from his older brother from the 1920s onward, this younger son at first restricted himself to the role of technical assistant. He became a full collaborator in the early ’30s, when the decorator Jean-Michel Frank began to commission lamps, ornaments, screens, and the like from the two brothers. For Alberto, this production was a passing thing. He did it out of necessity—times were lean—but also because his own sculptures of the period struck him as being in his terms little more than “objects” themselves, as having little to do with life, as having no other end but an esthetic one. “Whereas, in my mind,” he would tell an interviewer years later, “a sculpture was something altogether different from an object.” Lines that were desirable attributes in decorative objects were drawbacks in sculpture, or at least in a sculpture that aspired, as would be the case with his work after 1935, to turn the statue into a support for a vision of life, in which its matter would obliterate itself, like wood in a fire.\n\nDiego, on the other hand, never entertained any such precautions against “decoration,” and would continue to devote himself to the manufacture of furniture. There is a world of difference between the act of sitting down and the act of identifying oneself with a tribal deity; yet the chair has the same functional character as the tribal mask, and in no less degree. Diego always took great care to maintain the utilitarian purpose of his production. He refused the title of “artist” and proclaimed himself an artisan in part because he wanted to keep in the background in relation to his brother, but also because this allowed him to sustain the possibility of producing a body of work that asked itself no questions, and yet did not dissemble. Because of this, the Giacometti style—that manner of reducing forms to their bare, knotty essence—finds in Diego a happy resolution that its passage into Modernism completely denied Alberto.\n\nThis style, which must be attributed to Alberto, is displayed in Diego’s work first of all in a rare alliance between sobriety and sensibility: a geometric rigor without dryness. The hand kneading the earth continually infuses abstract structure with a sense of the organic. At any given moment that structure may become a tree, may bud, may flower. The work may ask itself no questions, but does not stop us from questioning it. It defends its happiness with a humor born of the subtle shifts, surprises, and contradictions that Diego ingeniously built into it. The noble connotations of bronze, further amplified by allusions to Etruscan, Pharaonic, and Hellenistic art, and to his brother’s sculpture, are contradicted by ordinary, popular elements. The same distinguished material is used to translate a bit of string, a cane panel, a chocolate-box ribbon. One thinks of those dignified persons who, in the midst of some solemn ceremony, thumb their nose at you, or make a face. Sometimes these pleasantries even take a metaphysical turn. When bronze assumes the shape of wooden planks, something emerges (as with Jasper Johns’ bronze ale cans) that is neither bronze nor plank but belongs to that tertium imperium which is the territory proper of art.\n\nMore curious still are some of the effects that Diego drew from yet another register. Along the height and the breadth of the otherwise impeccably geometric structures of his consoles and tables is .hidden an entire population of mischievous beasts—wolves, stags, dogs, cats, mice, owls, foxes, shrews, and elephants, acting out a comedy in a hundred different acts in the sublime shadow of bronze. It is as though La Fontaine elected to write his fables on forms drawn by Euclid. In reality, Diego’s work brings to light—but with such simulated naïveté that we don’t stop to notice—the marriage of stern geometry and organic fantasy that is one of the oldest ornamental conventions of the West. From the Pompeian grotesques up through the compositions of Jean Bérain and Claude Audran, what virtuosity has been spent on putting geometric figures into funny animal or vegetal drag, on turning them into creatures both real and imaginary. If the very heart of this tradition is ruled by the synthetic method that attempts to forge heterogeneous realms into one, it happens also that it assumes an analytic gait (for instance, in the Incipit of Roman manuscripts). A sly wink at the Modem? Diego most often went this second route, challenging disparities, underlining the dualism (the opposition of art and nature) that rips asunder the art of the 20th century—not least the art of Alberto. But what in others becomes anguish,or grinding pain, is transformed in Diego to a smile.\n\nNothing is more revealing in this respect than to compare his sculpture—by this I mean all those animals, homunculi, and trees that he made separately, then set at whim on the furniture—with that of his brother. A sculpture by Alberto is never to be confused with its model, and manifests irredeemable distance. Diego’s figurines, on the contrary, do not in the least suffer the pain of a union lost between the work of art and its model. The plaster and bronze effigies of the cat and the fox that Diego cared for tenderly in his atelier have a happiness, a kind of Franciscan gentleness, that is born of a paradisiac state—the paradise from which Alberto expelled himself around 1921.\n\nPierre Schneider is an an historian, essayist, and art critic who lives in Paris.
