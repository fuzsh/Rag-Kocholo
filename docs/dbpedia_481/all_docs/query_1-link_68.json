        "text": "Alberto Giacometti is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century. Becoming famous thanks to his sculptures, he was also a renowned painter and designer. Although he was already one of the leading figures of the surrealist movement in Paris in the 1930s, it was his post-war creations that became his major artistic legacy. The long, slender statues embody Giacometti's easily recognizable style. The representation of the human being in his vulnerability and his existential anguish constitute the main subject of his creation. For Giacometti, it was about grasping reality in all its complexity.\n\nHis father, Giovanni Giacometti, himself a painter, encouraged him to take an interest in sculpture. At the end of his compulsory schools, Alberto left to study at the Geneva School of Fine Arts before arriving in Paris on January 9, 1922. He attended Antoine Bourdelle's studio at the Grande Chaumière academy in Montparnasse. . He discovered Cubism, African art and Greek statuary.\n\nWith his brother, Diego Giacometti, he moved in April 1927 on rue Hippolyte-Maindron (14th arrondissement) into “the cave-workshop” which they never left. The same year, Alberto exhibited his first works at the Salon des Tuileries.\n\nHis first personal exhibition at the Galerie Maeght took place in 1951, it was accompanied, like those that followed, by the edition of Derrière Le Miroir, including original lithographs.\n\nGiacometti's lithographs are pure line drawings executed in black on transfer paper. We find there the familiar or insistent subjects to which his painted and sculpted work has accustomed us, the same characters, the same street, the same workshops cluttered with sculptures, stools and paintings. The rapid, nervous, repeated line does not surround or fix the forms but seems to make beings and things emerge from the very light which bathes them and from the space which they develop.\n\nIf the conditions of the process, notably the impossibility of erasing or returning to the line, give lithographs less finesse and less subtlety than graphite drawings, they on the other hand acquire a frankness and spontaneity which allows , in a way, to witness the birth, the emergence of his hallucinating drawing.\n\nAmong the iconic photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson there is this marvel, both an exceptional document and a living portrait of Alberto Giacometti. It was taken during the preparation of an exhibition at the Maeght Gallery, in 1961. \"The Walking Man\" was exhibited there before joining the courtyard of the Maeght Foundation which was under construction.\n\nThe etchings engraved in 1955 are also aids to drawing but, in this area, the imperative requirements of the process give the compositions very particular characters. Alberto Giacometti cares very little for complex techniques, for the “cooking” of etching, he willingly abandons the rest of the operations, from biting the metal to printing the proofs. He engraves with the point on the copper varnish as he would do with a feather on a sheet of paper.\n\nIn his engravings, Alberto Giacometti invites us into his workshop, sharing with us his research and the progress of his sculpted or painted work. In the clutter of Buste in the workshop, we see canvases, placed against the wall, sculptures completed or in progress.\n\nAimé Maeght, Annette Giacometti, X, Marguerite Maeght, Alberto Giacometti in the Giacometti Court at the Maeght Foundation, 1964.\n\n“I will never be able to put into a portrait all the strength that is in a head. » he writes. When Alberto Giacometti makes portraits, he lets us create the environment as in the artist's wonderful portrait Mother in which he only represents the face. Our imagination builds around this face. Conversely, for Bust of a Man, Head of a Man and Bust II, the artist highlights the facial features and places them in an environment, even going so far as to create a frame for Head of a Man. The Dog and Cat's Head seem to respond to each other across the studio under The Walking Man, tireless walker through pictorial time. Giacometti has fixed, in his engraved work, some of his sculpted or painted masterpieces in the middle of everyday objects The Workshop with two buckets, The Two stools, the stove, a harness... Alberto Giacometti says again : “There is nothing more than reality that interests me and I know that I could spend the rest of my life copying a chair. »\n\nFew color photos of Alberto Giacometti.\n\nThis one, from 1958, is by Ernst Scheidegger, it’s a pure masterpiece.\n\nWe recognize the iconic sculptures that my grandfather, Aimé Maeght, intended for the Maeght Foundation which was then under construction.\n\nBorn October 10, 1901 in Borgonovo, Switzerland.\n\nDied on January 11, 1966 in Chur, Switzerland.\n\n\"And when, at the twilight of his research, he liked to cover with color the craters of the blind plaster, was he on the threshold of an unknown color, or should we see in this little barbaric red and blue that 'an even more abrupt relief for the white of absolute mourning?'\n\nYves Bonnefoy, “The Stranger by Giacometti”.\n\n1915-1919 : Completed his secondary education at the Protestant college of Schiers, near Chur, in Switzerland. First sculpted or painted busts and first wood engravings. Interrupts his studies and enrolls at the École des Beaux-Arts, then at the École des Arts et Métiers in Geneva.

The Invisible Object , masterpiece of Giacometti's surrealist era. Is excluded from the Surrealist group. These new sculptures of almost abstract geometric rigor bring him back to reality and the model ( The Cube, Head ).\n\n1936 to 1940 : Participates in numerous group exhibitions around the world. Frequents the artists Balthus, Gruber, Tal Coat, and the group around the journal Abstraction-Création. Frequents André Derain, to whom he has real admiration. Entrusted the New York gallery owner, Pierre Matisse, with the representation of his work in the United States. Leave the model behind and return to memory work. His sculptures become tiny until they disappear.\n\n1941: Befriends Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. During the war, lived in Geneva with his brother Diego.\n\n1945: Resumes sculpture of nudes and heads, determined not to let them diminish; but he destroys them and starts them again to end up with the same stretched and filiform figures, the only ones to correspond to his vision of reality.\n\n1935 to 1947 : Does not exhibit once.\n\n1947 : Participates in the International Surrealism exhibition at the Maeght Gallery.

This work absorbed him for a year until the spring of 1960.

While the Maeght Foundation project is well advanced, Aimé Maeght offers Alberto Giacometti a space worthy of his work by offering him the opportunity to occupy the central courtyard of the Maeght Foundation. Four of these sculptures will be painted by the sculptor and placed by him in the Foundation Courtyard.\n\n1960 : Giacometti pursues an impossible resemblance, notably in the busts of Annette and the paintings of Caroline.
