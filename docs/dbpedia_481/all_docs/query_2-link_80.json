        "text": "Description of the Unit –\n\nObserving the distorted gestural figure sculptures of Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966), as well as the elongated, rhythmic figure paintings by Ernie Barnes (1938-2009) that both emphasize and exaggerate long limbs, students will create similarly distorted, gestural sculptures primarily out of wire.\n\nActivity statement –\n\nWorking with a variety of media is part of a comprehensive art education. Thin-gauge wire offers students an opportunity to think of three-dimensional expression, while its pliability gives students the opportunity to create diverse lines and shapes. This project also involves other steps, such as applying a sort of papier-Mâché to the wire, creating a base out of clay, coating the whole thing in paint, and then drawing the shadow of their figure on paper. Such a long-term project is useful for teaching perseverance and problem-solving skills.\n\nOur inspiration will be drawn from the surreal, discomfiting and bleak figure sculptures of Alberto Giacometti as well as the confident, vibrant and elongated portraits by Ernie Barnes. Both artists created artwork that spoke to the time and place within which they each lived, evoking very contrasted emotions. Each artist also tended to elongate and distort the limbs in the figures they represented, Giacometti in his bronze sculptures, and Barnes in his paintings. The results, of course are very different, and make for generative student discussion.\n\nGoals –\n\nStudents should…\n\nUnderstand:\n\nThe socio-historical contexts within which Alberto Giacometti and Ernie Barnes lived and made their art\n\nThe fundamental ways in which three-dimensional artistic expression varies from two-dimensional expression\n\nHow movement can be expressed in a figure sculpture\n\nWhat is meant by emphasis and distortion in art-making\n\nKnow:\n\nWho Alberto Giacometti and Ernie Barnes were and why their work is important\n\nBe able to:\n\nRecognize work by Giacometti and Barnes\n\nDefine emphasis and distortion in art\n\nCreate a wire sculpture that expresses the distortion of a figure\n\nObjectives –\n\nStudents will: Create a figure sculpture out of wire that evokes a sense of movement and exaggeration (emphasis and distortion).\n\nResources and materials –\n\nGiacometti and Barnes exemplars\n\nSpools of wire in a thin gauge\n\nVarious kinds of pliers and cutters for cutting and shaping wire\n\nModel magic clay (for those sculptures that need a base)\n\nScissors\n\nPaper for papier-mâché\n\nMod podge\n\nPaint or spray paint\n\nQuestions –\n\nIn what ways do Giacometti’s sculptures demonstrate distortion or exaggeration?\n\nHow do Giacometti’s sculptures evoke movement?\n\nHow do Giacometti’s sculptures make you feel?\n\nWhat do you think these sculptures are meant to represent?\n\nAre they attractive to you? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways do Barnes’ paintings express distortion or exaggeration?\n\nHow do Barnes’ paintings evoke movement?\n\nWhat do Barnes’ paintings say about the people represented? Why?\n\nWhat is the focal point of your sculpture?\n\nWhat is the most important aspect of your sculpture?\n\nWhat aspects of your figure are you distorting?\n\nWhat was the most challenging part of making your sculpture? The most fun?\n\nEvaluation –\n\nDid students:\n\nExpress ways in which sculpture differs from two-dimensional artistic representation?\n\nDiscuss their thoughts and feelings regarding the work observed by Barnes and Giacometti?\n\nTry to evoke movement in their sculptures?\n\nUse exaggeration or distortion?\n\nEngineer ways in which to connect wire pieces?\n\nDid students take risks to create a visually interesting sculpture?\n\nInformal:\n\nStudent questions\n\nGroup discussions\n\nOral responses to essential questions\n\nAt least one finished piece\n\nElaboration and risk-taking\n\n6th grade\n\nArt History\n\nmixed media\n\nSculpture"
