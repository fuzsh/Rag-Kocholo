        "text": "No artist creates in a vacuum, and I’m no different! I’ve been influenced by many artists. The trick, as a sculpture artist, is to consistently capture moments in time that are unique and special in their own right, even as they may be influenced by work I’ve studied in the past.\n\nAlberto Giacometti (1901–1966), whose sculptures are on exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City until September 12, carefully studied the human figure for much of his lifetime. He has been one of my mentors in expressing movement while still using solid materials, such as bronze or plaster.\n\nThe Guggenheim’s description of the exhibit notes it, “…Examines anew the artist’s practice and his unmistakable aesthetic vocabulary. Featuring important works in bronze and in oil, as well as plaster sculptures and drawings never before seen in this country, the exhibition aims to provide a deeper understanding of this artist, whose intensive focus on the human condition continues to provoke and inspire new generations.”\n\nOne might assume that Giacometti’s art was strongly influenced by his father, Giovanni, who was a Post-Impressionist painter. He was surrounded by artists in his life. The Guggenheim museum’s site notes that his brother was also an artist. If I could speak to Giacometti, I might ask if he purposely defined his style to differentiate himself from the artists in his family.\n\nGiacometti is well known for his idiosyncratic, consummate sculptures he created in the late 1940s. In particular, his elongated bronze sculptures were compelling to me. His work inspires the question: “Can the artist depict a figure realistically, yet in an interpretive manner?”\n\nAn example of one of my artworks influenced by this style is “Amour.” In bronze, this 42-inch bronze piece demonstrates two lovers, connected both literally and figuratively.\n\nThe museum’s website says Giacometti portrayed “humanity at its most vulnerable.” In Amour, the individuals are extremely vulnerable and clearly rely on each other for support. In this piece, I’ve attempted to replicate a mood and sense of connection. I hope it elicits this emotion in viewers of the piece."
