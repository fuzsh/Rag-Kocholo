        "text": "One of the most influential styles of 20th-century modern art, cubism rejected many of the traditional techniques of painting. Cubist painters broke away from imitating nature in their art, declining to use perspective, foreshortening, and modeling, which create illusions of depth. The cubist style instead emphasized geometric forms and the flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture. Cubist artists depicted radically fragmented objects. Often, partial views of a subject from several different vantage points would be shown simultaneously. For instance, part of the profile of a person’s face might overlap with views from the front. The style got its name from an art review that described Georges Braque’s 1908 work Houses at L’Estaque as being composed of cubes.\n\nCubism was created largely by Braque and Pablo Picasso between 1907 and 1914. In 1907 Picasso painted the famous work Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, an important forerunner of cubism. The work was inspired by African art and the paintings of Paul Cézanne. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon depicts five nude woman in flat, angular shapes; two of them have masklike faces. Unconventional and defiantly unlovely, it perplexed or shocked many of those who saw it.\n\nIn 1910–12 Picasso and Braque worked together closely on developing their new style of painting. This phase of the style is often known as analytical cubism. Paintings created during this period show the breaking down, or analysis, of form. The artists favored right angles and straight lines in their works. They presented complex, multiple views of their subjects, which are reduced to overlapping planes. In order not to distract the viewer from the artist’s primary interest—the structure of form itself—the range of colors is markedly reduced. Many of the paintings are nearly monochromatic, or composed of only one color. Musical instruments, bottles, pitchers, glasses, newspapers, and the human face and figure are recurring motifs. Words are often stenciled onto the paintings.\n\nAfter 1912 the phase known as synthetic cubism began. Works from this phase emphasize the combination, or synthesis, of forms in the picture. Color assumes a strong role in the work. Shapes, while remaining fragmented and flat, are larger and more decorative. Often materials such as newspapers or tobacco wrappers are pasted on the canvas in combination with painted areas. This technique, known as collage, emphasizes differences in texture and also poses the question of what is reality and what is illusion."
