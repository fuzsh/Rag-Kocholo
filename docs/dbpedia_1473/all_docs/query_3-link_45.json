        "text": "Hello baby. Did you miss me?\n\nYarp, the cycloptic, laser-eye blasting Aussie is back and ready to rumble in Mortal Kombat X joining returning fighters Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Raiden. It’s unsure what role he’ll play in the new story but he’ll more than likely make Sonya and Cage’s daughter, Cassie Cage, a living hell.\n\nThe video above shows off some of his new moves against insectoid kombatant, D’vorah. The big changes here are represented in rearranging Kano’s moveset via his color coded energy orb. His three stances – Cutthroat, Cybernetic, and Commando – each have strengths and weaknesses that will determine how he’ll stack up against foes.\n\nIn fact, each character will differ slightly depending on how you wish to play by incorporating 3 different styles. I’m a bit skeptical about how this will impact the final release but, if anything NetherRealm is great at making a spectacle. At least on the surface, these stances add a somewhat denser fighting mechanic that will help you tweak characters to your liking.\n\nOverall, Mortal Kombat X is shaping up to be another hard hitting entry into the long-lived series and if we can base anything on the excellent MK9‘s story mode, will hopefully be equally bonkers."
