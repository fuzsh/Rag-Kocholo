        "text": "Description\n\nLikes: Singing and dancing, doing the Usa Peace pose\n\nDislikes: Difficult books, studying and stories\n\nClass: 1-B\n\nKanon is the protagonist's younger sister. She loves to sing and dance and dreams of becoming an idol. She often poses or reenacts scenes she has seen in shoujo manga or anime. She has average grades but is athletic. She joined the tennis club since she looks up to Haruka. She is rarely seen without a smile on her face.\n\nDescription\n\nLikes: Sports, eating, having fun with everyone\n\nDislikes: Studying, boredom, BB\n\nClass: 2-A\n\nNonoka has below average grades, is extremely athletic and has an upbeat personality that allows her to have a lot of friends of both genders. She is the ace pitcher of the softball club. Love is the last thing on her mind. She has been the protagonist's friend since middle school and has frequently given him nicknames based on his interests at the time; the one she uses most frequently is \"Darts'un\" from the time the protagonist tried playing darts.\n\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nTomoe is a girl with a rather plain personality who easily blends into the background in the protagonist's class. Her grades are about average and she is not very athletic either. She always distances herself from her other classmates and would react timidly should anyone attempt to start a conversation with her. This shyness comes from having moved many times due to her father's work and not having been able to make fast friends as a result.\n\nDescription\n\nLikes: Studying, diving, swimming, being organized, reading\n\nDislikes: Disturbing others, violating the school's rules\n\nAki is a third-year student with a rather stern personality, earning her the reputation as the \"Captious Student Council President\". Her grades are outstanding, the best Kouga Academy has ever seen, and was formerly a member of the swim club, specifically as a diver.\n\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nLikes: Chatting, tennis, reading\n\nDislikes: Not being able to maintain herself\n\nHaruka is the protagonist's classmate and object of affection. She is very popular among both boys and girls, has good grades and plays tennis very well. She can handle everything with ease but is not the type to show initiative herself. She is the protagonist's childhood friend; but, because he became conscious of her developing body, her beauty, as well as the gossip regarding the two of them once they reached middle school, he has distanced himself from her, much to her disappointment.\n\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nShe is a student teacher who came to Kouga Academy in the new term as a math teacher. With the exception of university, she has never been to a school with boys (having always attended all-girls' schools). Since she has a rather upbeat personality, her students often call her informally, which she does not object to and therefore naturally results in her high popularity among the student body. Like Yuko and Ruu, Momoko is an unlockable character.\n\nDescription\n\nMai is a classmate of the protagonist's little sister, Kanon. Her personality is on the meek and shy side. She has average grades but is rather athletic. She engaged in gymnastics during middle school but switched to rhythmic gymnastics in high school.\n\nDescription\n\nLikes: Taking pictures (especially of the nature), being alone\n\nDislikes: Small talk, nosy people, taking portrait shots\n\nHikari is a member of the photo club. She chooses not to take portrait shots, specializing instead in landscape/scenery and astronomy photos. She is not the type to engage in small talk and therefore is mostly seen by herself. She rarely smiles and is prone to sarcastic comments.\n\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nRina has a very gentle demeanor and is in the same school year as the protagonist. Her grades are quite good even with the careless mistakes that she often makes. She likes cooking and is the lone member of the Cooking Research Society.\n\nDescription\n\nMisa is the protagonist's homeroom teacher. She teaches English. She considers teaching to be her calling in life and therefore she is very thorough in guiding her students. A harsh personality coupled with being somewhat untidy result in zero happenings in her love life. Momoko ÅŒtani is currently under her supervision.\n\nDescription\n\nHiromichi is the president of the Photography Club. He pursues a wide range of photos from the female students going about their daily lives to the borderline eroticism stuff. Possibly because of this that he is thoroughly hated by every girl in the school, but he seems not to mind.\n\nDescription\n\nKatsumi was the ace of the volleyball club until she injured her ankle during her freshman year, forcing her to retire. She is now the president of the Photo Club (not to be confused with the Photography Club), which takes all of the school's official photos. Katsumi created the Photo Club because she was rejected by Hiromichi for membership in the Photography Club (likely due to disagreeing with him on the issue of erotic photography). Since her injury, she has been learning about cameras, using them to record other students' dreams while cheering them on. Katsumi is loved by all of the girls involved in club activities, especially those in the sports clubs.\n\n<hidden by spoiler settings>"
