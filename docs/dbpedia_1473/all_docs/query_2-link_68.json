        "text": "March 17 (Mon)\n\nSonic X is about to air very soon. The first episode is finally almost finished, and while I was relieved, I was discovered in that moment and asked to write something if I was so bored. So, I decided to write a production log in this section… sigh.\n\nAll that said, I’m going to be writing about various staff stories and topics while Sonic is on air. Hope you enjoy!\n\nMarch 18 (Tue)\n\nToday was the production presentation. It was a ceremony to announce that this is what Sonic is all about. However, many Tokyo Movie staff members are shy and are not good at giving speeches at such events. Producer M was one of them. However, when the time came, he was able to give a concise speech that was easy to understand. The first episode was screened and was well received, which was a relief. However, the director’s comment in his greeting that he would normally refrain from doing so, but that he made requests to the staff without hesitation for this series, was a little worrisome…\n\nMarch 19 (Wed)\n\nYesterday’s anxiety had become a reality. The director suggested that we do another retake. N, who was the production assistant, had mixed feelings shown on his face because he thought it was finished. In the end, we decided to fix every detail. The total number of cuts was 20. The crew is almost done!\n\nMarch 31 (Mon)\n\nOne week to go until the broadcast. The title of the first episode is “The Supersonic Hero Takes the Stage!”\n\nThere are plenty of highlights in this episode, like a mecha battle, a car chase, and a pretty boy (?). In particular, the scenes created by the mechanical animation director, Mr. Watabe, are breathtaking. Another highlight is strange mechs appearing one after another in every episode. The robotic character named Decoe is my favorite.\n\nApril 1 (Tue)\n\nBoth the opening and ending are completed for the second episode.\n\nThe appeal of these two episodes is, after all, Tails (this is just my personal opinion). In fact, the cute Tails is the most popular among the staff. He’s also apparently easy to draw. Rouge comes in second, by the way. It seems that the appeal of this work is that it can depict flashy action. We’ll have to wait and see where Tails’s charm lies in the second episode!\n\nApril 7 (Mon)\n\nThe ratings for the first episode of Sonic X have been announced. The ratings were higher than expected and the response was positive. That was relieving. Since the highlight of the first episode was the action sequences rather than the story, we were happy to see the ratings increase over time. The entire staff will work hard using this as a springboard!\n\nApril 8 (Tue)\n\nI checked the materials for episode 3. This completes all work on the third episode.\n\nThe appeal of the third episode is Knuckles’s way of life. Knuckles is just as cool in the anime as he is in the games. He is a lone warrior who values his friends but chooses solitude for the sake of his own destiny. Hmmm. I wish I could live like Knuckles, but I’m just too easily carried away by the world these days. I’m sorry…\n\nApril 21 (Mon)\n\nI usually write this journal on Mondays, but this time it took two weeks. The reason is that a cold has been going around, and I and even the director have come down with it.\n\nWith fever and cough, I couldn’t work. Checks were delayed, meetings were not possible, and I was very weak. What was most troubling was that I could no longer taste, and even the only thing I looked forward to, the taste of food, was lost. I want to eat a steak dripping with blood…\n\nOh? What is the highlight of the fourth episode? It’s Mr. Stewart.\n\nApril 22 (Tue)\n\nContinuing from the other day, I would like to talk about episode 5. This time, Mr. Tomonaga storyboarded the episode, which is quite interesting. The highlight of the episode is Amy. Amy on the train going to the picnic is my personal favorite scene because it shows her character so well. I was surprised that she brought her hammer to the picnic too! Speaking of which, it turns out that Tails also always carries a screwdriver. “It’s just a matter of habit,” is what Tails says, but I still think the people around Sonic are a bit strange.\n\nMay 5 (Mon)\n\nThe world is in the final stages of the Golden Week. However, there is no Golden Week for TV. This means that we, the production staff, cannot take a break… So, today, we have to edit the video again. Episode 5 aired yesterday, and now we are editing episode 7. It was completed about two weeks ago. However, there are still some things I want to fix. My greed is never satisfied.\n\nMay 6 (Tue)\n\nFinally, the Golden Week is over and I am more enthusiastic about my work.\n\nThe highlight of episode 6 is the voice of the teacher robot, which I personally find appealing, because usually the voice actor’s voice is changed by a tool, but this time it is almost entirely natural. Mmm, it is wonderful and tasteful.\n\nAnother recent favorite among the staff is the messenger robot. He has a cute face and voice, but his personality is that of a kindergartener. And yet, he is still evil. After all, a character with some “bite” to them is very appealing. Expect to see more of the messenger robot in the future!\n\nMay 15 (Thu)\n\nAs I am writing this log, I hear a chime that signals 2:00 AM. The reason why I am working at this hour is because I have to check the dubbing of Sonic episode 9. Dubbing is the process of adding music and sound effects such as the sound of a booming explosion to a picture. Normally, this process takes about 2-3 hours, but for Sonic, it takes about 10 hours due to the challenge of the staff to create different music for each episode. The work usually finishes around 2:00-4:00 in the morning. Staff, please take care of your health.\n\nMay 16 (Fri)\n\nAlright, back to looking at the highlights of each episode. Episode 7 is a sitcom, a complete change from the previous episodes. The S-Team leader also makes an appearance. By the way, this leader was cool when he first appeared in the first episode, but I think he is gradually showing his true colors and becoming a rather irresponsible guy. Well, personality aside, each of these S-Team racers are modeled after someone. The model for the S-Team leader is, of course, Mr. X from S*nic Team. If you don’t know who that is, check the opening credits to find out.\n\nMay 19 (Tue)\n\nNow that we’re back to looking at the highlights for each episode, this week we have episode 8. As the subtitle (“Emergency Takeoff! X-Tornado”) suggests, it is the X-Tornado. It is a mecha original to the anime, and the director, Mr. Kamegaki, has put his heart and soul into it. By the way, this X-Tornado is supposed to be a modified version of Tails’s Tornado 2 (a blue airplane), but where are the hints of that…?\n\nMay 22 (Fri)\n\nI’m sleepy. Yesterday, the dubbing was finished at four in the morning. Before that, we had to do a retake of episode 9, which was a nerve-wracking task. For episode 9, the main star is Amy. Amy is a fun character because she’s one of Sonic’s more emotional friends. Even in episode 9, her feelings for Sonic and her anger toward the Eggman robot are expressed with her entire body, which is very cool. In a way, she is like Dokin from Anpanman. Nowadays, girls are more energetic than boys. Amy may be a textbook example of this.\n\nJune 9 (Mon)\n\nIt’s been a while since the last Sonic journal entry. Sorry about that.\n\nThe highlight of episode 10 is Cream. I didn’t know that she had mastered the art of enchantment as a child. Hmm, I wonder what she’ll be like when she grows up. She might win over Rouge’s charm. Rouge will get her time to shine in episode 11. The Phantom Thief Rouge, with her youthful and adult glamor, is popular among the animation staff. She can be depicted in an action scene, of course, but her body shape is the most attractive feature…\n\nJune 10 (Tue)\n\nEpisodes 12 and 13 are about the attack on Eggman’s base. Naturally, there is a lot to see, but I think Sonic’s action is the highlight. By the way, there is an amazing mecha in episode 13. Eggman has created a mecha that looks just like the famous Maz*nger X. I was a little impressed to see that perhaps Eggman had also seen Maz*nger X. I can’t wait to see what he does with it. (Or maybe doesn’t…)\n\nJune 13 (Fri)\n\nToday is Friday the 13th. Actually, the ending will change starting with episode 14. I can’t tell you who will sing it yet, but the theme of the song is Amy. Speaking of Amy, she is a girl who dreams of romance with Sonic. She may be the one who is the most honest about her feelings, even when things get crazy. We have finally finished the storyboard and are hard at work. How will Amy’s love story end?! Stay tuned!\n\nJuly 1 (Tue)\n\nBefore we know it, it’s July. It has already been three months since the start of the broadcast. Next week will be the new ending. As I wrote in the last entry of the production log, the image of the ending this time is Amy. Naturally, the song is also about love. We didn’t have much production time, but I think it will be enjoyable, so please look forward to it.\n\nJuly 2 (Wed)\n\nThe Sonic studio is getting too cramped… In addition, we have decided to start production of a new work in October (Sonic is not over, it will keep going), so we will move to a new studio. We had a quick preview of the new studio and found it to be quite spacious. It is big, as it used to be a gym. And above all, it is well-equipped. Man, I’m feeling more motivated to work! But it looks like it will be hard to move around.\n\nSeptember 20 (Sat)\n\nThe other day, the Sonic team moved to a new building near the head office, which surprisingly used to be a beauty salon. It has a Jacuzzi, a shower, and a shell-shaped washbasin. Hmm, I think this might be the most eccentric studio in the history of animation production companies. The fact that it is hardly an environment for work is the key.\n\nBy the way, in addition to the Sonic team, this room also houses the studio for PoP*LoCrois, which airs after Sonic at 9 AM, is also in this room. Some of the staff members are also the same (M in particular).\n\nI hope that both productions will be able to make something good, and while engaging in friendly competition, they will get along well with each other and increase their ratings…\n\nSeptember 22 (Mon)\n\nSummer ended before it got too hot (and before there was even a vacation). Even though it is the fate of production, we couldn’t go anywhere this year either… sigh.\n\nBut the Sonic team is hotly passionate! Because today we’re editing episode 26. We put all our energy into this episode, you know. I think it’s quite enjoyable because we didn’t make any compromises. The music is also very special, and they even used a song by Oda Kazumasa. Of course, the usual ending is also played. Which song will be played where? You’ll have to watch it to find out.\n\nNovember Journal Entry\n\nHello, my name is I, and I have taken over production management duties from Mr. M.\n\nNow, I would like to make this journal, feeling outrageous that I have to write it out of the blue because Mr. M (the traitor) was suddenly transferred (he bailed) to be in charge of another show.\n\nSonic X follows the storyline of the games. Therefore, the episodes, which are as exciting as a series finale, come in short cycles, so we are having a hard time making them. The episodes are enjoyable, but Mr. M disappeared at such a critical time. (Mr. M, don’t think treating me to a pizza once is gonna let you off the hook!)\n\nIn particular, “The Scream of Perfect Chaos,” which was broadcasted the other day, was the most animation-intensive episode in Sonic’s history with all our heart and soul put into it. And Mr. M suddenly disappeared in the middle of this busy schedule.\n\nUndeterred, the entire production team worked hard to make it happen. I would like to express my appreciation to all the staff members and to Mr. Tokum*ru, the production assistant, for their hard work.\n\nThere are still many more highlights (and some grumblings) to come, so don’t miss Sonic, everyone!\n\nMessage from Kanemaru Junichi (on the old X-Web bulletin board)\n\nThe biggest event that took place on the old X-Web during the Sonic X broadcast period was a post on the Sonic X BBS from Sonic’s voice actor, Mr. Kanemaru Junichi himself.\n\nThis time, we would like to publish the post from that time again with permission."
