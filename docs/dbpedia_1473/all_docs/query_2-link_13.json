        "text": "Page 41 →Two Cinematic Influences and Cultural Politics\n\nWe make movies. The only difference is that ours come in a box. Whether it’s a video-game cabinet or a home machine, we’re creating movies.\n\n—Roger Sharpe, director of marketing, Midway Games\n\nThe genre of fighting games is not typically known for its strong narrative content—unlike, say, the deep character immersion and long quests associated with more reputable genres like role-playing games (RPGs)—and fighting games are more often associated with the quick and largely disposable thrills of each matchup. Although the post-match taunt screens of the Street Fighter games might offer some small glimpse into particular characters’ personalities, for example, players are far more likely “to know our on-screen equal through the expressive range of their movements (the iconic language of animation)” during in-match gameplay and the overall investment in mastering a given character’s special moves (Surman 2007, 215). While the challenges of two-player competition depend on the respective skill of one’s human opponent, the single-player mode of most fighting games is typically arranged as a series of bouts against either a representative selection or a full roster of computer-controlled opponents, with the AI difficulty ratcheting up as one approaches a final “boss” character(s). As Chris Goto-Jones (2016b, 45) argues, then, most game genres make mastery of the control scheme an instrumental starting point for exploring a larger virtual world, but Page 42 →fighting games rehearse incrementally more difficult battles in order to make mastery of the control scheme the game’s overall goal. And as Nicholas Ware (2016, 159) adds, the “repetition of the fight-through-the-tournament structure of storytelling is a patterning that frames not only the individual narratives of the playable characters but also the experience of the player.”\n\nRachael Hutchinson (2007, 286) notes that broadly sketched characters, especially ones that embody certain cultural stereotypes, may be “much easier to write and create than complex realistic characters,” in addition to allowing players “to quickly and easily distinguish characters from one another, so players can recognize their opponent and adjust their fighting style appropriately.” The storytelling limitations of fighting games are thus largely generic in nature but also contingent on technological and design limitations. The character roster in early Mortal Kombat games was partly determined by memory constraints, for instance—hence why separate storylines for each character might be a convenient justification for including so many “palette swap” characters (e.g., Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile, Kitana/Mileena/Jade) (Begy 2012, 211). In other cases, new characters in sequels evolved from unused character designs that time or space did not allow in previous games, such as MKII’s Jax having initially been planned in place of Mortal Kombat’s Sonya, before the designers elected to replace him with MKI’s sole female character; or Baraka’s (MKII) original character design as a fighter armed with hook swords, which later became the basis of MK3’s Kabal. Moreover, an MKII subplot involving MKI characters Kano and Sonya being captured by the evil emperor Shao Kahn (and shown held in chains in one of the MKII arena backgrounds) was solely invented due to memory constraints, since there was not enough space for all MKI characters to return alongside the newly introduced character sprites, and the audit menus in MKI machines had already shown Sonya and Kano as the first game’s least-selected characters (Quan 1994c, 118).\n\nMortal Kombat’s cocreator John Tobias admitted, “It’s difficult to set up a storyline with an arcade fighting game,” because “you’re pretty much limited to the Attract Mode” (Kunkel 1994, 38). Hence, comic books, strategy guides, and other paratexts can provide extra narrative information that cannot be conveyed through in-round gameplay alone (Wolf 2001, 101). Indeed, MKI’s attract mode offers not only a brief justification for the titular tournament and short character biographies of each selectable fighter but also Midway’s mail-order offer for a Mortal Kombat Collector’s Edition comic book (Tobias 1992), which provides additional Page 43 →backstory. Even before the first game’s success was a sure thing, then, comic books were already a crucial part of the world-building process that would become all the more apparent across the sequels, especially in the increasingly baroque cosmology introduced in conjunction with Mortal Kombat 4.\n\nThe backstory established in the attract mode and comic book for MKI begins five hundred years ago, when the mysterious sorcerer Shang Tsung emerges as the unexpected winner of a Shaolin martial-arts tournament. After being bested by a Shaolin master, the Great Kung Lao, Shang enlists a secret weapon—a four-armed demigod named Goro, prince of a desolate parallel dimension called the Outworld—to defeat Kung Lao and maintain indefinite control over the tournament. Relocating the once-a-generation tournament to his island stronghold in the East China Sea, Shang uses Goro’s ensuing five centuries of victory for turning the onetime Shaolin-hosted tournament into a death match and absorbing the souls of dispatched combatants to ensure Shang’s own immortality. Among the newest challengers at the Mortal Kombat tournament are Liu Kang, a Shaolin monk intent on restoring the tournament to its former glory; Johnny Cage, a Hollywood martial-arts star joining the tournament out of egotism; Kano, a wanted member of the Black Dragon Society criminal organization; Sonya Blade, a U.S. Special Forces lieutenant in pursuit of Kano; Raiden, a thunder god guiding the human combatants in their challenge to the forces of evil; Sub-Zero, a mysterious member of a Chinese assassin group, the Lin Kuei; and the revenant Scorpion, formerly a member of a rival assassin group (the Shirai Ryu), now returned from Hell (or the “Netherrealm”) to exact revenge on Sub-Zero for the (apparent) murders of his family and himself.\n\nAccording to the MKII attract mode and Collector’s Edition comic book (Tobias 1993), Liu Kang kills Goro and defeats Shang Tsung during MKI’s tournament, while Scorpion kills Sub-Zero, and both Kano and Sonya are drawn through a dimensional portal when Shang retreats to the Outworld to beg a second chance from the evil emperor Shao Kahn. The emperor devises a plan to win ownership over the Earth (or “Earthrealm”) through a new winner-takes-all tournament held in the Outworld, headed by the newly revivified Shang and another monstrous four-armed warrior, Kintaro. Liu Kang returns home to find the Shaolin Temple destroyed by Baraka’s band of Outworld warriors at Shang’s command, but there he reunites with an eponymously named descendant of Kung Lao (a fellow member of the secretive White Lotus Society, founded by Raiden). Two factions of combatants form—the evil OutworldersPage 44 → led by Shao Kahn (Shang, Kintaro, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Reptile) and the Earthrealm warriors led by Raiden (Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Sonya’s former teammate Jax)—and we eventually learn that, by dint of the Elder Gods, the victor of ten Mortal Kombat Grand Championships in a row entitles their represented realm to gain possession of an adjacent realm. Goro had been defeated by Liu Kang short of one remaining victory, thus holding off the interdimensional takeover, but regardless of the newly announced tournament’s outcome, it is merely a distraction from the Outworld’s impending invasion of Earth.1 Although Liu Kang is again victorious in this second tournament, the invasion finally occurs in MK3, in spite of the Elder Gods’ prohibitions, via a dimensional rift opened when Shang reincarnates Shao Kahn’s long-deceased wife, Sindel (former queen of the realm of Edenia), on Earth and crosses over to retrieve her, with much of the action occurring in a postapocalyptic Chicago.\n\nYes, if this all sounds rather arcane, it still pales in comparison to the inordinately expanded story through which later sequel/prequel games and paratexts would “retcon” (i.e., establish retroactive continuity with) the original trilogy’s narrative events via a plethora of additional subplots, characters, and alternate timelines (see chapter 4). Whereas video games tend to allow the player’s imagination to fill in the gaps left by general nods toward world-building (Wolf 2012; Aranda 2016, 419), even from this simplified overview we can see that the series contains far more narrative cues than the average fighting game, thus complementing the games’ aforementioned inclusion of hidden characters and other “Easter eggs” as clues to a much larger implied diegesis than can be conveyed through gameplay itself. Although Mortal Kombat was arguably the first fighting game series to develop “lore,” fighting games are a deceptively complicated genre for maintaining a coherent series-long narrative, because each playable character likely has some (small) degree of backstory, and winning the game as a given character typically reveals a character-specific ending that bookends their competition (Hutchinson 2019, 72–73). As Ware (2016, 160) posits, the fighting between different characters thus implies a fighting of different narratives for supremacy, but it is difficult to tell which of these character endings is “canon” until a sequel game confirms who actually won the previous tournament. Consequently, a garden of forking paths is retroactively shoehorned into a serialized framing narrative whose potentially clumsy convolutions bespeak the various narrative fragments that are either confirmed or denied in each subsequent game.2\n\nPage 45 →And yet I argue that in addition to clarifying this overarching frame narrative through Midway’s authorized paratexts, a web of cinematic allusions and other cultural touchpoints also serve as important extradiegetic fabric for the Mortal Kombat series. Much as Janet Staiger (1992) notes that early tableau-based films like Uncle Tom’s Cabin (Edwin S. Porter, 1903) may look very “primitive” and narratively confusing to modern viewers because we lack the close familiarity with Harriet Beecher Stowe’s then-popular 1852 novel that period viewers would have already gained through that cultural moment’s intertextual surround, we might see a variety of films and other references as helping to flesh out the story world in Mortal Kombat’s many tableaux of hand-to-hand combat. This is not to say, of course, that all Mortal Kombat players (especially given their youth demographic) would have recognized the many films that John Tobias has cited as either direct or indirect inspiration on the series. Still, the games’ overall narrative has far more coherence when one has some familiarity with both the wuxia and kung fu strands of Hong Kong martial-arts cinema, plus the Jean-Claude Van Damme films that had initially brought that star to Midway’s attention before the failed Universal Soldier licensing deal.\n\nA number of earlier martial-arts-themed video games had at least superficial links to movies, especially when tied to particular stars: from Chuck Norris Superkicks, to Kung-Fu Master’s Japanese reissue as an unlicensed tie-in with Jackie Chan’s martial-arts comedy Meals on Wheels (Sammo Hung, 1984), to Datasoft’s (U.S.) 1984 Bruce Lee platform game. But few fighting games possess Mortal Kombat’s dense indebtedness to specific films and cultural mythologies previously transmitted through cinema. By tracing the history and influence of Hong Kong martial-arts cinema up through the popularity of Bruce Lee in the 1970s, the Americanization of such films via rising stars like Van Damme in the 1980s, and the wuxia revival in pre-reunification Hong Kong’s “New Wave” films, we will find a mélange of historical signifiers that may indeed have been cobbled together from an orientalist cultural imaginary among an all-white team of American game designers but whose very transnational circulation also complicates some of the more one-sided accusations of racism and sexism leveled at the early Mortal Kombat games.\n\nFrom Wuxia to Kung Fu Films\n\nwuxia pian (chivalric swordplay films). Wuxia films are typically set in a fantastical version of China’s premodern past, featuring sword-wielding heroes (both male and female) with superhuman abilities to fly weightlessly through the air and unleash energy bursts (dubbed “palm power”) from their hands or weapons. Over half of all Shanghai film production from 1928 to 1931 consisted of wuxia films, but government censors cracked down on their production in 1931, fearing not only that their supernatural elements might promote superstition but also that their mix of old folk culture with new cinematic special effects might slow China’s path toward modernization (Desser 2000, 31; Cheuk 2008, 86–87; Hunt 2003, 6–7; Zhen 2001, 55–57). After World War II and the 1949 Communist Revolution, much of this production shifted to Hong Kong, from which companies like Shaw Brothers could more easily distribute films across the Asia-Pacific region (Chung 2007, 671–75). Wuxia films made intermittent comebacks over subsequent decades, especially once the success of Japanese chanbara films like the Zatoichi series (1962–89) led Hong Kong studios to send aspiring filmmakers to train in Japan and come back ready to revive wuxia films as a homegrown Chinese form of swordplay cinema. But wuxia films were largely considered passé after the box-office failure of King Hu’s A Touch of Zen (1971) (Hunt 2003, 3; Teo 1997, 98; Teo 2009, 143).\n\nKung fu films, by contrast, emphasize the variety of empty-handed combat styles that, according to legend, were developed in Bodhidharma’s time at the Shaolin Temple in Henan Province during the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589 CE), though the films themselves are typically set in somewhat more contemporary settings. Shaw Brothers’ The Chinese Boxer (Jimmy Wang, 1970) is often credited as the first breakthrough kung fu film, with its success and the following year’s Bruce Lee vehicle The Big Boss (aka Fists of Fury, Lo Wei, 1971) helping displace the wuxia film’s popularity by 1972 (Teo 1997, 103). Whereas wuxia films relied heavily on montage and special effects like wirework to depict their heroes’ superhuman attributes, kung fu films increasingly highlighted the pro-filmic authenticity of martial artistry, with stars like Lee effectively “re-masculinizing” martial-arts cinema by displacing wuxia’s frequent female heroes and elevating masculine spectacles of bodily mastery (Tasker 1997, 322–38; Hunt 2003, 46, 53, 119; Bowman 2011, 64). Warner Brothers, meanwhile, helped popularize kung fu with Western audiences by first distributing the Shaw Brothers’ King Boxer (aka Five Fingers of Death, Jeong Chang-hwa, 1972), producing the television series Kung Fu (1972–75; starring David Carradine as a former Shaolin monk Page 47 →in a role originally considered for Lee), and finally coproducing Lee’s crossover vehicle Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973). With many kung fu films deliberately made for export, and distributed by exploitation film companies to inner-city grindhouse theaters on double bills with horror and blaxploitation films, kung fu became so popular that Hong Kong–made films outgrossed Hollywood films at the box office for much of 1973 (Desser 2000, 20, 22–26, 34–35).3\n\nMeanwhile, within the realm of martial arts itself, a series of governmental initiatives—first during China’s Republican era and then following the 1949 Revolution (A. Morris 2004)—formulated wushu in order to consolidate China’s many disparate fighting styles beneath the banner of a state-approved, competitive gymnastics style increasingly distanced from the practicalities of hand-to-hand combat. Although there are no hard-and-fast distinctions between regional styles (Kennedy and Guo 2005, 80–83), wushu is more indebted to the kicks and lower body strikes commonly associated with Northern Chinese martial-arts styles, as opposed to the fists and upper body strikes from the Southern styles later associated with “kung fu.”4 With acrobatic movements derived from Chinese opera traditions and the associated spectacle of long kicks, wushu became more closely aligned in the popular imagination with the realm of myth, fantasy, and pastness also seen in wuxia films, as opposed to the relatively more modern, realistic, and historically specific connotations of kung fu films. Overall, Chinese viewers discerned wushu and kung fu as very different styles during the 1960s and 1970s, with the former seen as more of a gymnastic sport than the latter’s association as a web of practical combat styles (Hunt 2003, 29–31; Teo 1997, 98; Bordwell 2000, 201).\n\nThis distinction is significant for my purposes because many of Mortal Kombat’s live actors, such as its original martial-arts consultant Daniel Pesina and his students, used their wushu training to develop the game’s moves. This fact helps explain not only the series’ emphasis on jump kicks and other long leg attacks; the popular linkage between wushu and wuxia’s fantastical elements also helps justify the series’ use of energy projectiles and other forms of “palm power” (already popularized by Ryu’s Hadōken in the Street Fighter series). The dropped frames of its pixilated sprites additionally recall the use of “undercranking” to artificially speed up the filmed movements in kung fu films—a controversial practice among purist fans of martial-arts movies, for supposedly “cheating” the authenticity of the filmed martial artist’s speed. (Many of the Mortal Kombat clones discussed in chapter 4 are marked by inferior pixilation Page 48 →techniques, recalling the campier aspects of sloppy undercranking in some low-budget kung fu movies.)\n\nThe successful double-billing of kung fu and horror movies certainly resonates with Mortal Kombat’s supernatural characters and gory fatalities. The carnivalesque, gross-out quality of the latter—which prevents players from ever taking such winkingly outlandish deaths too seriously—provides another link between the sense of lowbrow vulgarity that courses through much of Hong Kong genre cinema (e.g., grotesque forms of abjection, slapstick tomfoolery, ribald bodily functions) and also finds a home in the culturally “lower” end of the horror genre (Bordwell 2000, 7, 97). Take, for instance, Jeffrey Sconce’s (1994, 112–13) discussion of the “highly self-reflexive and comic mediation on the spectator” in Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare (Rachel Talalay, 1991), when Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) sucks a stoned teenager into a video game, toying with the teen before killing him off with a nod to the tagline for Nintendo’s 1989 Power Glove peripheral (“Now I’m playing with power!”). This moment arguably looks ahead to the Mortal Kombat games in its temporary suspension of framing narrative and character identification alike to foreground the film’s central appeal: “incredible spectacles of death” delivered by an impishly effective showman. Krueger himself would become a playable character (available as a premium download) in the rebooted Mortal Kombat (NetherRealm Studios, 2011), while Mortal Kombat X (NetherRealm Studios, 2015) would offer other downloadable horror avatars, such as Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th [Sean Cunningham, 1980]), Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre [Tobe Hooper, 1974]), and the titular monsters of Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979) and Predator (John McTiernan, 1987)—thus indicating the horror genre’s easy overlap into Mortal Kombat’s own generic territory.\n\nOf course, a major difference between kung fu movies and fighting games is that, regardless of the long-take aesthetic privileged by martial-arts purists, many kung fu films still rely on montage and other quick editing tricks to depict spectacular combat moves, whereas each round of a fighting game constitutes a single long take within which all the action unfolds, even as combos still recall the precision of Hong Kong fight choreography (Hunt 2003, 2, 36, 39, 193). Aaron Anderson (1998) observes that watching cinematic martial-arts fights feels closer to experiencing music or dance than actual real-world fights, and the combat tends to fall on a spectrum between depicting characters as rarely seriously injured (e.g., the slapstick combat of Jackie Chan) and depicting characters as sustaining graphic and painful-looking injuries. And unlike Page 49 →many martial-arts films, where the visible accumulation of fatigue and bodily damage signals the approaching end of a fight, the health meters in fighting games invisibly monitor the character’s remaining vitality. That is, the combatants in most fighting games (with notable exceptions like the “body damage system” in Bushido Blade [Lightweight [JP], 1997]) do not realistically slow down or lose their abilities to inflict damage across the course of a given round, regardless of the rather unrealistic degree of damage their bodies should have suffered throughout.\n\nMuch like exploitation movies, fighting games are also full of fast, cheap thrills and forms of readymade spectacle (e.g., special moves) that are geared for quick player turnover more appropriate to the coin-op market than long-play games designed for home consoles. And unlike the long training sequences, romantic and political subplots, and other extended backstory in martial-arts films, the gameplay of fighting games is largely confined to the actual fights themselves (Poole 2000, 56–57, 188)—more like engaging with the trailer for a martial-arts film (i.e., all the most sensationalistic “good parts”) than the film as a whole. The Mortal Kombat games, then, would seem to operate at both ends of Anderson’s (1998) spectrum, with combatants’ fighting abilities visibly unaffected, despite the many spurts of blood they may lose during each round, but with the end-of-match fatalities serving as a sudden shift toward graphic mutilation that reinforces the severity of the loss.\n\nThe overall gameplay in the early Mortal Kombat games combines the empty-handed combat of kung fu movies with the more supernatural elements of wuxia films (e.g., “palm power”), thus representing a combination of what were once considered distinctly different fighting aesthetics. Swordplay itself did not become a major factor in the series until MK4 allowed each playable character to draw and wield their own distinctive weapon during combat, while more “authentic” combat styles were added as playable options in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), albeit with the menu interface flattening these culturally localized fighting traditions into just one of many toggleable choices.\n\nAlthough some allusions to Japanese mythology were included (e.g., “Raiden” from Raijin, a mythological god of thunder), Pesina argued for including more Chinese cultural influences in the games, including not just the influence of wushu itself but also related weapon techniques like the rope dart (sheng biao), originally a medieval Chinese weapon that here became the basis for Scorpion’s spear. Pesina likewise pushed for characters such as Sub-Zero to be depicted not as Japanese “ninjas” (a trope cinematically popularized in the United States by Cannon Page 50 →Films’ Enter the Ninja [Menahem Golan, 1981]) but rather as part of the mythical Lin Kuei (“forest ghosts”), a nomadic clan of secretive Chinese warriors who supposedly date back to the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) and later crossed into Korea and Japan, becoming a formative influence on Japanese ninjutsu (McCarthy 2018).5 The Lin Kuei were actually the invention of American martial artist Randall Brown (1984), writing in the mid-1980s under the pseudonym Li Hsing (1984; 1986), who dubiously describes having been trained by the last surviving Lin Kuei master, an émigré to the United States who had since bequeathed this secret history in an effort to keep the clan alive in America.\n\nAccording to John Tobias’s original concept art, Liu Kang was initially going to be a Japanese character named “Minamoto Yoshitsune” (after Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a military commander immortalized in the twelfth-century epic Heike monogatari), before he was later made a Shaolin monk and thus more clearly tied to the mytho-historical origins of Chinese martial arts. The actual Shaolin Temple in Henan Province had been destroyed multiple times over the centuries—albeit, and contrary to legend, not by the Qing dynasty—though Qing authorities did suspect the monks of harboring anti-Qing rebels due to the temple’s past support of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Nevertheless, this legend about a late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century temple burning—which supposedly scattered fugitive priests with martial-arts expertise throughout China—spread through popular martial-arts fiction (and, later, movies) (Shahar 2008, 184–85, 190–96). Leon Hunt (2003, 48–52, 58, 69, 71) observes that the Shaolin Temple mythos was not popularized in martial-arts cinema until the television show Kung Fu and a concurrent series of films including, among many others, Shaolin Martial Arts (Chang Cheh, 1974), Five Shaolin Masters (Chang Cheh, 1974), Shaolin Temple (Chang Cheh, 1976), Executioners from Shaolin (Lau Kar-leung, 1977), and The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (Liu Chia-liang, 1978).\n\nAnother mytho-historical allusion is Liu Kang’s supposed neglect of the Shaolin Temple (as implied in the MKII comic book [Tobias 1993]) in favor of the “White Lotus Society,” which in sequels is described as an ancient sect cofounded by Raiden and Shaolin Temple elders. The actual White Lotus religion (Bailian jiao) was a loosely organized sect dating back to the Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420 CE), whose millenarian beliefs “took on violent and rebellious characteristics as it incorporated elements of Daoist magical techniques, Manichean theologies, and folk shamanism” by the time of the Ming dynasty (Wang 2014, 42). Due to its millenarian beliefs, White Lotus adherents were allegedly involved in Page 51 →many anti-dynastic uprisings, with the very name “White Lotus” becoming a catchall label for stereotyping and persecuting heterodox sects and political dissidents during the Ming and Qing dynasties (ter Haar 1992, 244–45, 249). Much as Qing authorities falsely blamed the Heaven and Earth Society (Tiandihui), a secret society rumored to date back to the same fugitive Shaolin priests, for helping foment the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901), the White Lotus Society was scapegoated for their seemingly magical beliefs and intense secrecy (ter Haar 1992, 281; Shahar 2008, 184; Murray and Baoqi 1994, 82, 152). Indeed, orientalist scholars turned to Pu Songling’s 1740 book Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, a collection of supernatural tales about ancient China, as a reference point for attempting to link the White Lotus Society’s “magic” to modern imperial struggles like the Boxer Rebellion (Goto-Jones 2016a, 163–64). Like the story of the Shaolin Temple itself, then, kung fu films such as Intruder at White Lotus Temple (Chi Lo, 1971) and Clan of the White Lotus (Lo Lieh, 1980) would mix myth and history in dubiously verifiable ways.\n\nThe Bruce Lee Influence\n\nSuch mixtures of historical facts and legends primarily descend to Mortal Kombat by way of Enter the Dragon, the 1973 Bruce Lee film upon which MKI’s narrative is most closely modeled. In this transnational coproduction between Warner Brothers and Raymond Chow (founder of Golden Harvest, the largest producer of martial-arts films aside from the Shaws), Lee plays a Shaolin monk who must restore the temple’s honor and avenge his sister’s death by fighting in an invitation-only tournament held on a private island by Han (Shih Kien), a former Shaolin student who has turned his martial-arts training toward evil. Because Han’s island occupies international waters off the coast of Hong Kong, over which the British colonial powers have no authority, a British spy agency tasks Lee with digging up dirt on Han’s criminal enterprises during the tournament, with the assistance of two American combatants, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly). As Leon Hunt (2000, 76, 78, 80–81) argues, the film was deliberately made as a transnationally traveling text. Its espionage plot and orientalist archvillain recall Dr. No (Terence Young, 1962), many of the Asian actors’ dialogue is post-dubbed into English, and Kelly’s casting as Williams was deliberately meant to appeal to the Black crossover market between blaxploitation and martial-arts films. Hence, the film leans heavily toward orientalist kitsch, evincing a tension between “Asiaphilia” and “Asiaphobia” by both “fetishiz[ing] Page 52 →the ‘Orient’ and replay[ing] ‘Yellow Peril’ archetypes” (Hunt 2003, 158; see also Frayling 2014).\n\nAlthough Enter the Dragon’s modern setting means that it does not share the mythical temple-burning story presented in so many Shaw Brothers films, Han’s name conflates the Han Chinese with the Qing (Manchu) ethnic minority who conquered them in founding the Qing dynasty. This helps justify why Han so closely resembles Sax Rohmer’s infamous archvillain, Fu Manchu, a Qing loyalist who would have opposed Shaolin rebels against the dynasty. As Hunt (2000, 81) notes, Williams’s rebuke that Han “come[s] right out of a comic book” is even a reference to Marvel Comics’ deal with the Rohmer estate to revive the Fu Manchu character in their Master of Kung Fu series (1973–83).6\n\nIn MKI, then, Enter the Dragon’s conflict between Lee and Han becomes reworked into Liu Kang’s battle against the Fu Manchu–inspired Shang Tsung, another usurper of the Shaolin Temple’s former glory. While hardly the only fighting game character to be modeled after Lee, Liu Kang’s high-pitched vocalizations—an example of the “expressive amplification” of sound effects that David Bordwell (2000, 232–33) finds so endemic to Hong Kong genre cinema—are another obvious allusion to his cinematic inspiration, as further confirmed by Liu Kang’s Dragon Transformation fatality in MKII and explicit use of Jeet Kune Do (the martial-arts system developed by Lee in 1967) in MK: Deadly Alliance. From Han’s and Shang’s private junks sailing the combatants to the island (as depicted in the MKI Collector’s Edition comic), to both Han and Shang sitting on golden dragon–decorated thrones as they watch the tournament unfold, to characters like Roper prefiguring the money-driven egotist Johnny Cage, MKI’s setting and framing narrative share many inspirations from Enter the Dragon. Yet, as Paul Bowman (2011, 78–79) observes, the supposed “Shaolin kung fu” that Lee uses in Enter the Dragon is an exaggerated fantasy of “kung fu,” not an authentic representation of actual styles—in part because Lee’s self-developed Jeet Kune Do was itself a cultural hybrid of different styles, not unlike how his character mixes the mytho-historical Shaolin monk with the Cold War–era spy.\n\nLee’s fighting style, however, would become the crux of another cinematic influence on Mortal Kombat: his unfinished original production, The Game of Death. Lee began filming Game of Death for Golden Harvest in 1972, shooting about one hundred minutes of footage before agreeing to pause production to star in Enter the Dragon, but his untimely 1973 death meant that the project was aborted. (Enter the Dragon’s director, Robert Clouse, would later cobble together eleven minutes of Lee’s 1972 Page 53 →footage into a ridiculous framing story featuring a handful of Lee lookalikes, but this 1978 Game of Death bears little resemblance to Lee’s original concept and is better considered one of the many “Brucesploitation” films released to cash in on Lee’s death.) In Lee’s original version, he would have starred as martial artist Hai Tien, whose family is being held for ransom by Korean mobsters until Hai battles his way to the top of a wooden pagoda to acquire a treasure for the mob, with each of the pagoda’s five stories guarded by a master of a different martial art. Joined by several accomplices, each step in Hai’s vertical ascent is meant to showcase Jeet Kune Do’s ability to adapt to and overcome the best of competing styles (Goto-Jones 2016b, 47).7 If this sounds familiar, recall that the 1984 beat-em-up game Kung-Fu Master was directly based on a similar ascent through five levels of a temple to rescue the avatar’s wife. For our purposes, though, we can see the vertical ascent through a series of fighters with different styles and skill sets as inherited by Mortal Kombat’s “Battle Plan” screens (renamed “Ladders” in later sequels), which visually represent the sequence of upcoming fights as, for example, climbing a mountain (MKII) or a derelict skyscraper (MK3), with the bosses positioned at the top. And much like Jeet Kune Do’s goal of becoming so adaptable to an opponent’s style that it becomes a sort of “non-style,” MKI’s “Mirror Match” requires one’s avatar to fight against their doppelganger before continuing on to the bosses, as if overcoming the weaknesses of one’s own style is a prerequisite for reaching the top. Mortal Kombat’s status as a “game of death” in its own right, then, arguably owes a major debt to several of Bruce Lee’s posthumously released works.\n\nTsui Hark and the Return to Wuxia\n\nAlthough John Tobias cites Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest kung fu films, plus the obvious influence of Enter the Dragon, as inspirations for Mortal Kombat, he recalls, “My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films—Zu Warriors [sic] & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in [Chicago’s] Chinatown” (@therealsaibot, September 1, 2011). As one of the leading lights of Hong Kong New Wave cinema (ca. 1979–90), Tsui Hark’s energetic, genre-bending films are credited with reviving the wuxia film in the 1990s, with The Swordsman (1990) and the Once Upon a Time in China trilogy (1991–94) depicting ancient Chinese mysticism confronting (and eventually adopting) Western weapons and science during the late Qing dynasty. Critics disagree whether the mythicized pasts in Tsui’s wuxia films nostalgically recall a period of national(ist) Page 54 →unity or instead signal a more postcolonial/transnational awareness of the arbitrariness of borders, but they tend to concur that his films serve as loose allegories for Hong Kong’s impending 1997 handover to China (Sarkar 2001, 163–71; Teo 2009, 148, 162; See-Kam 2010, 45, 48–49).\n\nBorn in Vietnam but relocating to Hong Kong during the war, Tsui later studied filmmaking in the United States at a time when optical special effects in big-budget films like Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) were starting to dominate the global film market. Upon returning to Hong Kong, Tsui prefigured the later wuxia revival with his early film Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain (1983), an ambitious attempt to combine Hong Kong–style wirework with Hollywood-style optical effects overseen by an imported team of U.S. special-effects artists. Aspiring to compete in the global market, this Golden Harvest production returned only HK$3 million on its $30 million budget, with its narrative about unlikely heroes striving but perhaps failing to restore national stability thus sharing an ironic resonance with the film’s own costly gamble (Schroeder 2004, 3, 10, 12, 32–33, 41–43).\n\nSet in the enchanted Zu Mountains during an ancient period of intertribal warfare, West Zu army scout Ti Ming-chi (Yuen Biao) deserts with an East Zu soldier (Sammo Hung), and they adventure to a cave where they are rescued from flying humanoid creatures by itinerant swordsman Ting Yin (Adam Cheng). They are soon united with several warrior-monks on a journey to destroy the Blood Demon, an evil entity temporarily held at bay by the magician Long Brows (Sammo Hung). Reeling from their first encounter with the Blood Demon, the team takes refuge at the Ice Countess’s (Brigitte Lin) fort. Although Ting Yin remains possessed by the Blood Demon’s magic, the rest of the team scales Heaven’s Blade Peak to retrieve the Twin Swords, the only weapon that can defeat the demon. They manage to vanquish the demon just as Long Brows’ magical hold loosens, but despite achieving victory through unlikely teamwork, the two original soldiers finally return to their respective armies to find them engaged in perpetual combat.\n\nWith its gloomy and fantastical diegesis, the mystical world of Zu bears a closer resemblance to MKII’s Outworld than anything in the first game, complete with haunted temples and dark forests and wastelands. The shadowy presence of Shao Kahn as an evil emperor was inspired by Star Wars’ Darth Vader (Mick-Lucifer 2012), but the horn-covered Blood Demon also bears a fascinating similarity to Shao Kahn: both characters attempt to overrun borders but are held off by a Raiden-like figure’s (inadequate) magical boundaries (Schroeder 2004, 34). Some of the Page 55 →“palm power” elements in Zu closely prefigure certain moves in the Mortal Kombat games: from the Ice Countess’s ability to freeze her opponents with bursts of blue ice energy (à la Sub-Zero), to the warrior-monks using their blade-rimmed hats as throwable metal discs (à la Kung Lao), to Ting Yin’s sword blade spreading out into a spinning array like Kitana’s fan. The projectile moves in Mortal Kombat—in which characters do not throw actual weapons so much as energy projections from those weapons (e.g., Kano’s knife, Mileena’s sais)—are a convention straight out of wuxia films like Zu. And we might even see Bhaskar Sarkar’s (2001, 169–70) argument about the “tropes of physical amputation” in Hong Kong New Wave films, allegorically reflecting hysteria over the prospects of Hong Kong’s post-reunification body politic, rendered into an apolitical visual trope in Mortal Kombat’s over-the-top fatalities.\n\nZu was also John Carpenter’s biggest inspiration for his martial-arts fantasy Big Trouble in Little China (1986), a secondary inspiration for Mortal Kombat (Swires 1986, 13). Much as the influence of kung fu films descended by way of Enter the Dragon, this Americanized take on Tsui’s attempted wuxia revival finds cocky Anglo-American trucker Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) teaming with San Francisco restaurant owner Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) and magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong) to infiltrate the Chinatown underworld, battling rival gangs and a Fu Manchu–esque sorcerer in order to save several kidnapped women. Throughout, magic is depicted as a dark and wondrous force transplanted from the Orient, much as Western stage magicians during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries invoked and perpetuated orientalist stereotypes in order to “conjure” entertainingly mysterious images of Asia for their patrons (Goto-Jones 2016a).\n\nAcross Carpenter’s oeuvre, “the [western genre’s] frontier mythology lingers, but its trajectory is reversed. . . . The primitive forces of wild places are not so much to be overcome as survived, and it is often those forces that seem inevitable and overwhelming, reclaiming the spaces abandoned by an American culture in retreat” (Phillips 2014, 125). In this regard, the orientalist mise-en-scène in Carpenter’s film—also shared by Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), whose main villain gave us Kano’s MKI Heart Rip fatality—takes on even more racialized “Yellow Peril” overtones by locating an “unassimilated” core of ancient Chinese magic amid an ethnic enclave within one of America’s largest cities.\n\nSylvia Shin Huey Chong (2012, 272) observes that the 1980s saw multiple films about Chinatowns as sites where “good Asian Americans” might Page 56 →be separated out from “bad Orientals,” as part of wider post-Vietnam concerns about the extent of Asian American assimilation.8 In Carpenter’s film, the sorcerer, posing as elderly and reclusive Chinatown banker David Lo Pan (James Hong), must appease the evil God of the East by sacrificing the kidnapped women to regain his youth, not unlike Shang’s reprieve from Shao Kahn in MKII. Meanwhile, three demigod figures loyal to Lo Pan—Thunder, Lightning, and Rain—provide obvious inspiration for Raiden by wearing conical bamboo hats, shooting lightning from their hands, and flying through the air (figs. 9–10), although the death of one such character, blowing up like a balloon until he pops, also prefigures Kitana’s MKII Kiss of Death fatality (figs. 11–12). There Page 57 →is even a moment at the film’s climax where Lo Pan and Egg Shen use “palm power” to conjure battling avatars, connected to their hands by long strings of energy, as if playing their avatars with home console controllers!\n\nFilms like Big Trouble in Little China illustrate how Chinatowns and other East Asian diasporic communities within the United States can serve as convenient backdrops for non-Asians’ fantasies about cultural slumming in “exotic” and “edgy” locales, even as these same locations may also be sites of more authentic transnational exchange. As Tobias recalls, venturing into Chicago’s Chinatown was necessary to acquire bootlegs of the Tsui films at a time when they were not yet officially distributed in the States, since diasporic video stores filled this gap.9 Moreover, the Mortal Kombat design team photographed examples of ornamentalPage 58 → Chinatown architecture—including the main Chinatown gate and a smaller “Welcome to Chinatown” display at the intersection of Wentworth Avenue and Cermak Road—to be mapped into the backgrounds of several MKI arenas (such as the “Courtyard” scene depicted in fig. 10). Both filmic and real Chinatowns, then, were sources of Mortal Kombat’s inspiration in multiple ways, albeit largely as a means of supplying the games with orientalist texture.\n\nThe Van Damme Connection\n\nFinally, we can return to the game’s aborted origins as a vehicle for Jean-Claude Van Damme, since his films—and, more specifically, how his films narrativize the appropriation of East Asian martial arts for American sensibilities—were a major early influence on the Mortal Kombat series. Tobias clearly went back to Van Damme’s low-budget Cannon Films releases like Bloodsport (Newt Arnold, 1988) and Kickboxer (Mark DiSalle, 1989) as inspiration once the Universal Soldier tie-in deal fell through. By Tobias’s own admission, the character of cocky movie star Johnny Cage “ended up being a spoof on the whole Van Damme situation” (Quan 1994b, 26), with Cage’s initials and splits-punch move as allusions to the real-life star. As several scholars have argued, Bruce Lee’s Vietnam-era crossover fame among American audiences led to the popularity of 1980s-era white action stars like Van Damme, who appropriated East Asian martial arts as a means of rendering them racially “closer” for American viewers to comfortably appreciate (especially when those skills were turned back against “Oriental” villains), while also fitting into wider Reagan-era attempts to redeem America’s past involvement in Vietnam. Military-colonial encounters had provided the context for such cultural appropriation even before the Vietnam War, with American servicemen bringing martial-arts knowledge back to the United States after World War II, the Occupation, and the Korean War (Desser 2000, 38–39; Hunt 2003, 9–10, 12; Chong 2012, 178–79, 186, 251).\n\nTake, for instance, the plot of Universal Soldier itself, which opens during the Vietnam War in 1969 as American soldier Deveraux (Van Damme) and his commanding officer Scott (Dolph Lundgren) kill each other when Deveraux attempts to prevent the mad Scott from executing innocent Vietnamese civilians. Frozen and later reanimated as part of a secret team of cyborg-zombie soldiers remotely controlled by the military (a premise that seems readily adaptable to a video game), Deveraux eventually regains his autonomy and goes rogue after flashing back Page 59 →to what happened in Vietnam; Scott is sent to take him out in a replay of their past conflict. The film clearly frames Deveraux’s rediscovery of his past moral fiber as a means of redeeming America’s culpability for the war; as if to cement the point, Deveraux even realizes his past identity while watching a TV interview of Richard Nixon explaining how he had accepted Gerald Ford’s pardon for the crimes committed during his presidency. Although the plot of Universal Soldier is, compared to Van Damme’s earlier movies, more of an attempt to replicate the success of RoboCop (Paul Verhoeven, 1987) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, its linkage of Van Damme’s star image with redeeming the war tells us something about his previous martial-arts films set in places like Hong Kong and Bangkok.\n\nBased on Frank Dux’s dubious account of winning the Kumite, a secretive martial-arts tournament held by the International Fighting Arts Association (Stewart 1980),10 Bloodsport’s Hollywoodized narrative of Dux (Van Damme) deserting the army to compete in the Hong Kong–based tournament in memory of his mentor Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao) adds a fictional backstory that nicely allegorizes Dux/Van Damme’s own appropriative relationship to East Asian martial arts. During a flashback, we see young Dux and his friends break into his future mentor’s home to steal a Japanese katana sword, but when caught in the act, Dux begs for the chance to earn the sword by training alongside Tanaka’s son. After Tanaka’s son unexpectedly dies, Dux convinces Tanaka to finish training him so that Dux can fulfill the father’s desire for a new familial generation of Kumite competitors. Despite Tanaka’s initial resistance (due to Dux’s non-Japanese ethnicity), the now-grown Dux completes his training and effectively becomes Tanaka’s surrogate son. In this story of a white man “redeeming” himself by earning his right to the Asian martial arts that he initially attempted to steal—and later confirmed by Dux’s climactic defeat of the murderous (Asian) champ Chong Li (Bolo Yeung)—Bloodsport presents the Euro-American appropriation of martial-arts traditions as justified, much as Van Damme’s own star image inherited Lee’s cinematic legacy. The film even draws a clear contrast between the serenely meditative Dux (depicted, like Tanaka himself, as a first-generation immigrant, though likely a convenient excuse for Van Damme’s thick Belgian accent) and the more stereotypical American represented by his friend and fellow Kumite combatant, Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb), a boorish biker who is not far off in characterization from Big Trouble’s cowboy-like Jack Burton.\n\nIn light of the fact that “Ultimate Kumite” was a working title for Mortal Page 61 →Kombat (Mick-Lucifer 2012), Dux and Jackson’s initial scene of Americans bonding abroad, with Dux defeating the boastful Jackson at several coin-op rounds of Karate Champ in their hotel lobby (figs. 13–14), is retrospectively all too appropriate:\n\nJACKSON: You like this kind of fighting, huh? You want to see some real fighting, you can see me fight at the Kumite.\n\nDUX: I’m here, too, for the Kumite.\n\nJACKSON: Aren’t you a little young for full contact?\n\nDUX: Aren’t you a little old for video games?\n\nIn this playful exchange, the conflation of the Kumite with a canonical fighting game looks ahead to Bloodsport’s influence on Mortal Kombat via its no-holds-barred tournament setting in a shadowy Hong Kong underworld, depicted not unlike the Chinatown underworld in Big Trouble in Little China. Bloodsport’s main villain, Chong Li, is even played by the hulking Bolo Yeung, who had a similar role as one of Han’s murderous enforcers in Enter the Dragon. Both Chong Li and the similar, long-queued villain Tong Po (Michel Qissi) in Van Damme’s Kickboxer provided visual inspiration for MKI’s four-armed monster Goro—a deeply problematic linkage of Asian-ness with monstrosity that, in a more feminized form, again stretches back to Fu Manchu. As Eric Lichtenfeld (2007, 111–15) notes, Van Damme’s early films for Cannon tended to follow this formula of a shadowy tournament milieu with racially marked villains, and his contract to keep making low-budget exploitation films for Cannon prevented him from achieving the same level of breakout mainstream success as another European expatriate with whom he was initially compared, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yet, whereas many of the so-called hardbody action films of the 1980s featured their stars’ passively displayed muscularity, Van Damme’s films combined images of his overdeveloped physique with the kinesthetic bodily movement that has been the primary appeal of martial-arts movies and fighting games alike (Anderson 1998).11\n\nAnother notable connection between Bloodsport and Mortal Kombat is its allusion to the Black Dragon Society (KokuryKokuryKokuryūkai’s early origins also derived in part from Uchida’s judo training alongside future members of the group (Adams 1969, 46), including Jigoro Kano, a possible namesake for the Mortal Kombat character who is described as belonging to a “Black Dragon Society” criminal organization.\n\nThe Japanese group’s infamous name was later appropriated by American ex-GIs like Count Dante (née John Keehan), a Chicago-based karate expert who founded the Black Dragon Fighting Society (BDFS) in 1969 as a fraternal organization of martial-arts specialists who held periodic Kumite tournaments. A ruthless self-promoter, Dante’s mail-order ads for the 1968 pamphlet World’s Deadliest Fighting Secrets appeared in Marvel comics like Master of Kung Fu and other pulp publications during the early-1970s kung fu craze, promising a free BDFS membership card with every order (Taylor 2018). Although Dux, another member of the BDFS, would claim that the “real-life” Senzo Tanaka (also rumored to have been one of Dux’s inventions, much like Randall Brown’s supposed Lin Kuei master) was formerly a member of the KokuryKokuryKokuryūkai. In this regard, Bloodsport’s own mytho-historical backstory helps shed light on not just more of the mélange of East Asian references thrown into Mortal Kombat’s diegesis but also the very process of cultural appropriation involved in doing so, including the one that originally made Van Damme a star.\n\nPlaying with Race and Gender\n\nUp to this point, I have described the Mortal Kombat games as drawing upon a mishmash of cultural reference points, primarily drawn from China and Hong Kong, albeit filtered through second- or third-hand Page 63 →derivations like martial-arts films. It seems quite clear from the mise-en-scène (e.g., the ubiquitous dragon symbol, yin-yangs, Buddhist statues, etc.) and music of these games that Mortal Kombat’s blender of influences is the orientalist imaginary—a generalized sense of nationless exoticism vaguely located in “the Asiatic” as “forms, spaces, and personages that many players will find similar to Asia but that are never exclusively Asian” (Patterson 2020, 58). As John Tobias himself admits, the game’s world derives from “a balance between fantasy—which in this case is represented by [E]astern influences—and reality, which is represented by [W]estern influences” (Mick-Lucifer 2012). The Outworld and its denizens are especially infused by orientalist visuals, as if the Orient itself is a sort of dark and mysterious alternate dimension that shares far more with the supernatural Outworld than the comparatively staid backgrounds seen when the Outworld invades Chicago in MK3.\n\nStill, without denying that these American game designers created a blatantly orientalist diegesis, I argue that simply castigating the series as “racist” requires overlooking some important nuance. On one hand, the transnational travel of martial-arts films means they are seldom “pure” national-cultural products to begin with, but rather products of cross-cultural influence. Recall that the 1960s popularity of wuxia films in China and Hong Kong was partly modeled after Japanese chanbara films and that many of the later 1970s kung fu films were deliberately made for export to the United States and elsewhere. Hunt (2003, 13) notes that exported kung fu films are more likely to flirt with (self-)orientalist imagery, in part because they are already the product of pan-Asian influences aiming for broader Asia-Pacific circulation. Much as “Shaolin” continues to circulate in and beyond China as more of a dubious brand name than historical fact (Burton-Rose 2017), Enter the Dragon as a U.S.–Hong Kong coproduction exemplifies this tendency toward “self-orientalism” for foreign marketability, opening the likelihood that, in Bowman’s (2011, 79) words, “many of the subjects called, hailed, or interpellated into position by ‘Asian’ martial arts did not (and do not) necessarily know about, care about, or feel any need to distinguish or discriminate between, say, (Chinese) ‘kung fu’ and (Japanese) ‘Samurai.’” At the same time, though, the immense popularity of Enter the Dragon and other East Asian martial-arts films among Black viewers during the 1970s (and beyond)—often rooted in their identification with underdog heroes fighting against cultural imperialists—demonstrates that this transnational exchange is not simply a tension between white versus nonwhite cultures and that some varieties of cultural appropriation can produce more politically ambivalent ends.\n\nPage 64 →On the other hand, American-based mini-majors like Cannon Films (itself founded and run by two Israelis) relied heavily on presales of international distribution rights (especially for home video sales) in order to finance a large production slate of low-to-medium-budget exploitation films like the early Van Damme vehicles (Wasser 2001, 121–25, 176). This meant that many of the white hardbody action stars—including Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Chuck Norris—whose 1980s popularity partly stemmed from embodying appropriated martial-arts spectacle, also became popular stars in East Asia. (Van Damme’s reputation as “the muscles from Brussels” further complicates this picture, since his heavily accented star image is nominally less “American” than most of his generic peers.) Consequently, small Hong Kong producers would begin copying the kickboxing-type films popularized by Van Damme, making their own homegrown variants in an attempt to stay competitive in the transnational market for martial-arts cinema (Yip 2018, 87).\n\nThe Mortal Kombat series coincidentally predated the late-1990s period when Hollywood itself began importing filmmaking talent from post-reunification Hong Kong, from directors (John Woo and Tsui Hark) to fight choreographers (Yuen Woo-ping), to stars (Jackie Chan and Jet Li). Meanwhile, American-made films like The Matrix (Lana and Lilly Wachowski, 1999) and Kill Bill (Quentin Tarantino, 2003–2004) were joined by successful wuxia films by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [2000]) and Zhang Yimou (Hero [2002]). As Andrew Schroeder (2004, 52, 55) observes, this flow of talent from “East” to “West” reverses the trajectory that Tsui had attempted years earlier when bringing over American special-effects expertise for Zu, with Hollywood now adapting effects like wirework and visual morphs that had been pioneered in Hong Kong. Tsui himself would direct several Hollywood films starring Van Damme during this period, including Double Team (1997) and Knock Off (1998), but neither is seen as a high point in either’s careers. Indeed, in recounting Mortal Kombat’s origins as a planned Van Damme tie-in, the Chicago Tribune ironically observed, “In the long run, MK’s pixel-ized blood sport [has] proved to have greater staying power than Van Damme’s recent celluloid offerings” (Hollingsworth 1995). What we find, then, is that martial-arts films have typically constituted a “minor” sector of the transnational film market where staying competitive means quickly exploiting a two-way flow of cross-border inspiration from one (often low-budget) variant to another (M. Morris 2004), creating a sort of international contest for one-upmanship not unlike the battling world warriors of Street Fighter II and so many other fighting games.\n\nPage 65 →Much as the opening credits of Bloodsport prefigure SFII by depicting a training montage of different fighters from around the world preparing for the Kumite, I argue that the characters in SFII are more crudely stereotypical than most characters seen in the first few Mortal Kombat games, since each SFII character is explicitly depicted as representing a different country rather than framed as a combatant within Mortal Kombat’s more escapist world of fantastical lore. That is, Mortal Kombat’s overall diegesis still evinces a problematically orientalist vibe, but because most of its characters and character-specific arenas are not blatantly framed as caricatures of real-world nations or cultures, the white American designers’ broad deployment of orientalism operates somewhat differently from Capcom’s more specifically Japanese deployment of stereotype. Nicholas Ware (2016, 161), for example, notes that SFII’s Blanka, a Brazilian beast-man, reflects Japanese racism toward “ethnically Japanese Brazilian immigrants coming to Japan during the economic boom years to work factory jobs,” whose “Japanese ethnicity gave them easy access to work visas” but whose “Brazilian culture and Portuguese language use . . . threatened the perceived homogeneity of Japanese cultural identity.” Rachael Hutchinson (2019, 77–78, 82–83) likewise explains that SFII was the product of a period when Nihonjinron, an essentialist “theory of the Japanese people,” was a cultural buzzword, helping explain the cultural caricatures posited as various “Others,” positioned against the normative Japanese male who serves as the default protagonist in most Japanese-made fighting games.\n\nSFII’s rather stereotypical characters may seem more difficult to take seriously, however, because the candy-colored sprites themselves are so cartoonish in style, perhaps encouraging us to read their “diverse” cast of reductive cultural representations as more campy than outright offensive (Patterson 2020, 54–55). By contrast, Mortal Kombat’s sprites generally rely on the indexicality of real-world actors and are thus more open to casting critiques. Indeed, the portrayal of some Asian characters, such as Sub-Zero and Scorpion, by white actors like Pesina was a questionable choice, but the sprites’ low resolution and the actors’ full body costuming at least obscures their most racially identifying features (with notable exceptions like Ho-Sung Pak’s portrayal of the semi-clothed Liu Kang). Hence, Josh Tsui, a Chinese American employee at Midway, substituted for the unmasked Sub-Zero, revealed in medium close-up in that character’s MKII ending screens. As noted above, the series’ first Black character, Jackson “Jax” Briggs, was originally planned for inclusion in MKI, but Midway decided to create Sonya as a female character with the same Page 66 →Kano-hunting storyline; Jax was instead introduced in MKII as a Special Forces major attempting to rescue Sonya from captivity by Shao Kahn. Although Sonya and Kano ironically proved the least-selected characters in MKI, Midway’s decision to include a sexualized female character (likely inspired by SFII’s Chun-Li) over a heavily muscled Black character—effectively treating femaleness and Blackness as superficially interchangeable nods to “diversity”—may have been motivated as a broader appeal to heterosexual male gamers than to the smaller contingent of nonwhite American gamers.\n\nMeanwhile, some early critics of Mortal Kombat claimed that the games reinforced stereotypes of nonwhite (and especially East Asian) ethnicities. During his U.S. Senate hearing testimony (C-SPAN 1993) over video game violence (see chapter 3), for example, psychologist Eugene Provenzo claimed that video games depict Asians as violent or evil. However, his own published research (1991, 126) cites only one anecdotal quote, from a fourth-grade boy who “wasn’t sure if the Ninja were Chinese or Japanese, but that the Chinese and the Japanese were the enemies because ‘just because they are from Japan they might want to do something different from you. And they are dangerous because they might want to fight with you.’”12 More specifically, Guy Aoki, president of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), argued that games like SFII and MKI potentially reinforced “existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts,” but he admitted that if Asian characters were simply omitted from such games, “then the [Asian] community would feel that the origins of martial arts are belittled and inaccurate.” In the same article, Asianweek writer May Lam (1994) was less concerned, noting that “players can choose to be an Asian or non-Asian character, thereby not automatically restricting Asian characters to the ‘enemy’ role,” and even Aoki concurred that a multiracial cast of characters could demonstrate that “not only Asians know kung fu.” When the first Mortal Kombat live-action film (Paul W. S. Anderson, 1995) was released the following year, Aoki (1995) criticized Japanese American actor Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa for playing the villainous Shang Tsung, arguing that it reinforced the same anti-Japanese xenophobia seen in his earlier Rising Sun (Philip Kaufman, 1993) role, but Aoki would grudgingly admit that Liu Kang’s (Robin Shou) emergence as the film’s “funny, hip-talking” hero helped balance out the film’s racial politics. Much as SFII’s Blanka reflected Japanese xenophobia against Brazilian immigrants, the resurgence of “Yellow Peril” rhetoric around the rumored Japanese corporate buyout of late-1980s America (which was rhetorically linked to Japan’s Page 67 →1980s success with exporting cars, computers, and video games to the States) was indeed a justifiable concern on Aoki’s part. The fact that so many of the Mortal Kombat imitator games of 1994–95 (see chapter 4) relied on crude, undeniably racist stereotypes implies that competing designers perceived such broad characterizations as a potentially copyable element of Midway’s success.\n\nStill, much as Bloodsport’s Frank Dux supposedly earns the right to appropriate Tanaka’s knowledge/sword through a perseverance that “transcends” race, many American gamers mistook the Mortal Kombat games for a Japanese franchise, based on its overall gameplay quality. This was due to the predominant (if reductive) association between Asians and martial-arts mastery, both on- and offscreen—to the extent that being said to have “Asian hands” is an orientalist compliment among white fighting gamers (Harper 2014, 113–14; Goto-Jones 2016b, 113–14). Indeed, the popular association between Japan and martial-arts fighting games is a notable example of a specific game genre that, unlike many other genres, retains its “cultural odor” when released outside Japan (Iwabuchi 2002, 27). Nevertheless, Mortal Kombat’s inclusion of blood and gore marked the games as American products in a different way, to the extent that they were censored (either banned outright or toned down with green “blood” sprites) in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other East Asian nations (Ng 2008, 220).13\n\nRachael Hutchinson (2007, 287) notes that fighting games that use blatant stereotypes may offend and thereby detract from a game’s enjoyment for some minority players. Meanwhile, some white male players might reinforce existing racial or gender prejudices by, say, always choosing white avatars when pitted against nonwhite characters or taking special pleasure in defeating female characters (289–91). Yet, much as I suggested in the previous chapter that players are far more likely to select characters based on respective skill sets (also see Hutchinson 2015) or the desire to see certain finishing moves, and not out of a strong investment in a character’s backstory, Hutchinson (2007, 295) compellingly argues that most players are far likelier to hone their skills across a demographically diverse variety of characters over time, with the sheer diversity of playable characters undercutting the potential for racial and gender stereotyping.\n\nWere imbalances built into gameplay through weakening the skills of nonwhite or female characters relative to other combatants, that would indicate bias on the part of game designers, but the fact that MKII’s top-tier characters (including Mileena, Jax, Kitana, Liu Kang, and Page 68 →Kung Lao) are all female or nonwhite (Cureton 1994; Char-Li, Vega, and Guzman 1994, 82) suggests that this was not the case here. Unlike a martial-arts film, where the viewer is given one or more sympathetic protagonists with which to identify, the fighting game continually returns to the Character Select screen, since one is not obliged to remain the same character after each two-player match or after suffering a defeat in one-player mode. Following Hutchinson (2007), then, this means that moral or political alignments between player and avatar are often fragmentary or tenuous at best. Still, a loud contingent of racist gamers led an online backlash against Jax’s Mortal Kombat 11 (NetherRealm Studios, 2019) character ending—wherein the victorious Black character, having gained the magical power to control time itself, travels centuries into the past to prevent transatlantic chattel slavery altogether. Whether accusing the game’s creators of injecting Black Lives Matter–era identity politics into the game or deploying the white-supremacist canard that the game promotes “white genocide” (Fahey 2019), this outsize response to a common trope of alternate-history speculative fiction supports Hutchinson’s (2007) caveat that racist attitudes brought into the game’s reception by a subgroup of angry gamers may be a stronger force than in-game representations themselves.\n\nThe social contexts for playing fighting games have never been politically neutral zones, since American coin-op arcades have long been seen as a homosocial “boyzone,” where female players were less common or located at different games than many of the adolescent male players—the latter often silently “cruising” each other to ascertain potential play partners with whom to express male homosocial intimacy via the gender-appropriate means of (the avatar’s) fists. As Carly A. Kocurek (2015a, 181, 196) observes, present-day (male) players’ memories of arcades as male-dominated spaces may be rather selective, with the recently expanding demographic of female gamers and the overall decline of the coin-op market producing a politically regressive nostalgia for the arcade as a gender-segregated space. This regressive nostalgia among a gamer subculture whose cultural reputation for “nerdiness” already compromises their (self-)perceived masculinity helps account for the politically reactionary defense of eroticized female characters, homophobic insults, and the sexual harassment of female game players and designers that is perhaps more common within the fandom of fighting and first-person-shooter games than in less violent genres (Skolnik and Conway 2017, 12–16).14 Indeed, despite the comparisons that professional e-sports gamers make between themselves and professional athletes training for more traditionalPage 69 → sports, fighting games foreground the sheer disjunction between actual and virtual performances of physical and athletic prowess.\n\nDespite the title of their oft-cited anthology From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games, Justine Cassell and Henry Jenkins (1998, 8–9) have very little to say about Mortal Kombat itself, apart from briefly citing male gamers’ gravitation toward fighting games as emblematic of gendered differences in gameplay, thus positing Mortal Kombat as a cultural “bad object.” These gendered tastes may be roughly analogous to those also seen among female fans of horror cinema, who predominantly (but not exclusively) dislike more violent and gory subgenres (Cherry 2002), but it is important to note that exceptions will always exist. Among recorded examples that would complicate selective nostalgia about arcades, for instance, consider the nine-year-old girl who wrote to a Chicago Tribune advice column asking how she could make new friends, since all of the girls at her school made fun of her for liking video games, “especially Mortal Kombat II” (Wendi 1995). Such comments suggest that, even if minimized in the discourse, female Mortal Kombat fans have always been present, especially once ports for home consoles allowed the games to travel beyond the traditional boyzones of American arcades. As a more recent example, Lisa Nakamura (2019, 135–36) cites a Black female gamer who professionally competes in Mortal Kombat tournaments but often receives both racist and sexist abuse from her online opponents under the guise of “trash talk.”\n\nFor some critics, the Mortal Kombat games became unfettered celebrations of masculinity, with female characters supposedly depicted as castrating dragon ladies (Kinder 1996, 34; Hunt 2003, 121, 132) whose challenge to phallic power aligned them with the “monstrous-feminine” (Creed 1993), not unlike the villainous female roles in some martial-arts films and Japanese “pinky violence” films. Although not as scantily clad as, say, the female combatants in the Dead or Alive series (Tecmo [JP], 1996–), I agree that Mortal Kombat’s female characters are visually framed for their sex appeal as well as their fighting prowess. Examples include their sexualized Kiss of Death fatalities, Kitana’s fan as a coquettish prop-of-femininity-turned-deadly-weapon, or Mileena’s vagina dentata–inspired MKII fatality (leaning in to kiss her defeated opponent but instead sucking them into her sharp-toothed mouth and spitting out a pile of bones). Long-running rumors about “nudalities” for these female characters were yet another product of the arcades as an adolescent male hothouse, growing from the same linkage between sexuality and death already seen in the Kiss of Death fatalities (see fig. 12). As John Tobias admits:\n\nPage 70 →Our player demographic was primarily a hardcore male audience and so the look and design of our female characters pandered to them back then just as they do today. I have no problem being apologetic for that. The only solace I can offer is that . . . those characters had very strong, atypical female archetypes . . . and at the very least could kick the hell out of their male counterparts. (Mick-Lucifer 2012)\n\nThis more optimistic take gained an unlikely echo of legitimation in Judge Richard Posner’s majority ruling in a 2001 case striking down an Indianapolis ordinance that would limit minors’ access to violent video games, in which Posner describes Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as, “surprisingly, a feminist violent video game.” Even as a female character’s “success depends on the player’s skill,” he suggests that “the game is feminist in depicting a woman as fully capable of holding her own in violent combat with heavily armed men.”15 As noted earlier, game balance is indeed one important measure of parity between characters of different races or genders, yet this hardly explains why, by the series’ third game, most of the female characters were increasingly attired like BDSM dommes, their cleavage prominently displayed in precariously low-cut vinyl outfits.\n\nThe wuxia influence on Mortal Kombat may be significant here, since unlike kung fu films, women are often as powerful as men in wuxia films, although there are plenty of more recent examples of powerful women in action cinema as well, some of whom are more blatantly sexualized than others (see Tasker 1993; Schubart 2007). Because female players are more likely to feel alienated from such hypersexualized characters (Hutchinson 2015), the use of flesh-and-blood actors to indexically depict Mortal Kombat’s increasingly sexualized female characters only raises the political stakes of such male-dominated design choices. Even Elizabeth Malecki, who played Sonya (one of the series’ more conservatively attired women) in MKI, recalls wanting her character “to be a positive influence for girls, and especially to both be fit and to be confident and strong.” But when the controversy over the game’s violence broke out in late 1993, she found that no teachers or principals would accept her offer to visit school classrooms with her positive message (McCarthy 2018). The wider implications of this politically charged moment, especially as the Mortal Kombat games migrated from the boyzone of arcades into the comparatively mixed-gender space of the family home, is the subject of the next chapter."
