In this variation, Kano gains the ability to counter high and low attacks, making this variation a favorite for those who want close-quaters kombat.\n\nCybernetic- This variation gives Kano his klassic look of having a red colored eye and cybernetic heart. Kano is able to make more use of his new cybernetic eye for long range attacks and gains access to grenade attacks, enabling him to extend kombos, juggle opponents and attack from varying distances.\n\nCut-Throat- The Cut-Throat variation gives Kano a green colored eye and cybernetic heart. With this, Kano can give himself a buff on his attacks and he is given more attacks and combos based around his traditional weapons of butterfly knives\n\nFatalities\n\nKano's fatalities include a head-searing eye laser attack that burns through an opponent's skull.\n\nMove List"
