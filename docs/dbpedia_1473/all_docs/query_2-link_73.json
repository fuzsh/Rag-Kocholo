        "text": "Following the release of Merry Little Batman on Prime Video last December, the streaming platform returns with new material featuring the Dark Knight. Titled Batman: Caped Crusader, the series was originally slated to drop on the HBO Max streaming platform. That is until the project was canceled and then taken over by Amazon MGM Studios. It is important to note that the series is unrelated to the holiday superhero film, which also has an animated series heading to Prime Video, titled Bat-Family. I watched Caped Crusader‘s premiere season twice over and am delighted to report that this is quite the heavy hitter.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader is created by Bruce Timm (Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited).\n\nSeries co-executive producer Jase Ricci (Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Merry Little Batman, Bat-Family), Timm, and executive producer Ed Brubaker write the stories for the series. Ricci, Greg Rucka, producers Adamma (Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul, Prime Video’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith) and Adanne Ebo (Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul, Prime Video’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith), consulting producer Halley Gross, and Marc Bernardin write the season’s teleplays.\n\nChristina Sotta, Matt Peters, and Christopher Berkeley are the directors for the episodes.\n\nIn this review, I will discuss Batman: Caped Crusader. As this article’s title suggests, no spoilers will be present.\n\nNOTE: Spoiler language was sent to the writer and editor of this piece beforehand by public relations representatives. The following does not touch upon explicit details regarding narrative and character development.\n\nAmazon MGM Studios’ Batman: Caped Crusader Logline\n\nAccording to Amazon MGM Studios/ Prime Video Press, here is the logline for Batman: Caped Crusader.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader is a hard-boiled animated series, that follows the fearsome vigilante in his first year. Forged in the fire of tragedy, billionaire Bruce Wayne becomes something both more and less than human—the BATMAN. Night after night, against overwhelming odds, he wages his relentless one-man war on crime.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader makes wise creative decisions in terms of crafting worthwhile narratives around main characters, supporting roles, and guest antagonists. With a full ten episodes, this first season wastes no time in transforming not just Bruce Wayne/ Batman (voiced by Hamish Linklater) as a human being but others as well. Despite being set up for a specific watch model, the screenwriters’ room does not force some huge storyline on viewers. Rather, the large arc happens behind the scenes while focusing on more individual, episodic narratives. Imagine the formulaic plots suited for the Scooby-Doo franchise with a graver tone due to Gotham as the location setting.\n\nThe first few episodes are more of a build-up to the world that fans of Batman are used to. They help recontextualize viewers with power politics and how the court of law is meant to keep Gotham in balance. Different character developments connect from one to another across the season’s episodes. In turn, this establishes a pattern that navigates each character’s decision to impact others’ future course of action. The double entendres or meanings—primarily through lines of dialogue—can define a character’s background or even foreshadow what becomes of them later in the season.\n\nNot to mention, the sound design and German music composer Frederik Wiedmann’s scores are worth watching the series. I love the jazz and classy tunes that play in the background of the episodes. From the pilot’s opening scene to the finale’s epilogue, the execution of both story and action is reminiscent of what made The Animated Series so memorable.\n\nArtwork Awesome Enough For Arkham\n\nThe animation team deserves all the praise for bringing these Scooby-Doo-esque stories to life. At a micro level, prop designers Art Lee and Ronnie Senteno create objects that look nice. I like the detail of Harvey Dent’s (voiced by Diedrich Bader) coin, goons’ Tommy guns, the broken arm of a marble statue, and Batman’s Batarang.\n\nCharacter design lead James Tucker et al animate some of the most vivid figures reminiscent of The Animated Series, notably in the antagonists. Basil Karlo (voiced by Dan Donohue), Catwoman (voiced by Christina Ricci), Harley Quinn (voiced by Jamie Chung), and Onomatopoeia (voiced by Reid Scott) have the most stunning costumes. Karlo’s bright eyes and disfiguration reflect John Carpenter’s The Thing or, staying on the topic of Scooby-Doo, Captain Cutler’s Ghost. Quinn’s jester costume is more menacing than what fans are used to in The Animated Series.\n\nCaped Crusader cannot be a Batman title without some magnificent storyboard artwork and background designs. The action sequences are thrilling to watch, e.g., Batman sword-fences a man in a trenchcoat, collects ectoplasm, and fights goons on the docks of Gotham. One character’s perception of the city as a world on fire is a neat mixture of character designs, background designs, and color. This makes the imagery as wicked on screen as it is on paper. The perforations of the rear car window via gunshots require meticulous attention, and I think that is to be appreciated. At this point in Batman history, the car chases and the rooftop chases are pretty much mandatory for the thrills. What more could we ask for?\n\nLaudable Episodic Screenwriting\n\nThe former half of Season 1 is perfect, although the episodes vary in world-building, pacing, themes, or character study. The metonymous opening scene of “Kiss of the Catwoman” alone is enough to call the entire episode a perfect narrative. As a whole, the episode examines the meaning behind a celebrity punch or slap and explains why people should never go as far as to label one a criminal. For a character study, the psychology of Wayne’s trauma as an orphan contributes to his pathos. Many comic book fans scrutinize the “Martha” aspect of Batman v Superman, yet this episode provides a wider spotlight on that correlation between pain and power.\n\nAgain, I must commend the screenwriters for their clever, witty, and brilliant work. Few may figure out what a clowder means, but now I know! A transitional period in the season feels like filler in one or two episodes. My least favorite episode gets expository during one scene, with a visually incohesive act structure. Conversely, in that same episode, someone analogizes Gotham to a beating heart, so I give it a pass for trying to go the poetic route. Here, Wayne also taps into his spiritual side, questioning whether ghosts are real. Although he ultimately chooses not to explore this any further, I cannot help but believe it insinuates that the phantasms of his late parents may haunt him.\n\nThe season picks the pace back up in its last few episodes. Here, everything transpiring behind the scenes pays off in a way that fans of Batman mythos will find uncanny. It’s nice to see corrupt cops Harvey Bullock (voiced by John DiMaggio) and Arnold Flass (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) make reckless choices and then get what’s coming to them.\n\nPolitical Themes\n\nNote: Narratives surrounding Batman and Gotham can never be apolitical. The claim to suggest otherwise requires serious discourse. It is important to note that, while this is a family show, Caped Crusader dips into mature subject matter such as classism, crime, psychology, belief systems, and more.\n\nLike the large focus of executive producer Matt Reeves’s (Cloverfield, Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, War for the Planet of the Apes) The Batman, Timm and his co-writers weigh in on crucial concepts through the world of Gotham. For one, the citizens experience a rise in inflation and unemployment, leading many to resort to crime. Poverty is a heavy issue in the Western world, and the disparity between the impoverished and the affluent can be felt. The show guides fans to The Narrows and the suburbs, juxtaposing different areas and the people who live there.\n\nBasil Karlo’s circumstances regarding landing movie roles are relatable. This is especially the case today, with job security and professional matters such as SAG-AFTRA unions. The episode dedicated to this character, “And Be A Villain”, is not to be overlooked and possesses merits that desire much care. Like the acting workplace, many characters wear a façade, including Bruce Wayne, who presents his public image as a cliché.\n\nThe women’s roles in the series should not be overlooked, too. A failure to recognize their power can go so far as to discredit original comic book characters such as Carla Viti—sister of Carmine Falcone—in, say, The Long Halloween. Many women in the series are painted as leaders, including Harley Quinn, who does not depend on a clown to be at her side. In the ongoing discourse over what the general audience accepts, the women are a major highlight of the series.\n\nThe Dark Mind of the Dark Knight\n\nFurthermore, in the discourse of Batman and his rogues gallery, it is incredibly vital to highlight the psychological elements of the storytelling. In recent years, it has often been disputed that Bruce Wayne’s role in his city is to dress up and physically harm the mentally unstable. As a critic, it would be remiss to ignore how this field of science applies to intellectual property such as this. For a character, the titular protagonist’s reserved nature is a mask that is seldom taken off. The screenwriters offer fans an uncommon scenario: What if Bruce Wayne legitimately attends therapy sessions?\n\nNow, I am not implying that the character takes the Tony Soprano route in this series. Therapy is no laughing matter, and that is coming from the fact that he has a few run-ins with Quinzel. Similarly, what humanizes the “antagonist(s)” of each episode is that they aren’t treated as villains. Essentially, these are people who need help. Take Firebug (voiced by Tom Kenny), for example, who is not right in the head. While I cannot explicate what he does or what occurs to him, it is easy for civilians to mindlessly point out the heroes and villains.\n\nWhat adds that layer of Gothicism to Caped Crusader‘s Gotham is its ability to conceal secrets and depict the macabre through tragedy. More so, the show taps into madness and obsession through its characters. Dent is one character who plays by the book. Like Barbara Gordon (voiced by Krystal Joy Brown), however, handling matters within the parameters of the law may not be enough. These sorts of conditions can be what urge people towards their breaking point. To reiterate, the series examines protagonists and antagonists, two sides of the same coin that can represent either humanity or monstrosity.\n\nThe Creators of Batman and Supporting Characters\n\nBatman is created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.\n\nArnold Flass is created by David Mazzucchelli and Frank Miller.\n\nLucius Fox is created by John Calnan and Len Wein.\n\nDr. Harleen “Harley Quinn” Quinzel is created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm.

Bonilla) are the greatest. They each want to change the city for the better with stronger optimism than Commissioner Gordon. Barbara’s dedication to upholding the law is naïve, yet her faith in others’ humanity truly counts most. Another character describes Montoya as “honest, intelligent, and incorruptible”. Her dedication to the job as a police detective is respectable, especially considering the alternative. Honestly, she is the best iteration of the figure since Rosie Perez’s version from Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey. Batman’s trust in both women keeps the city intact, and a disconnect from either can mean dropping deeper into a downward spiral. Moreover, Barbara and Montoya’s dynamic is almost like that of sisters in that the detective looks up to Barbara’s father as if he is her own.\n\nThe Antagonists\n\nBasil Karlo, Harley Quinn, and Anton Knight (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) hold some of the season’s best deliveries or voice performances. Out of the three, Quinn has the most screen time, and her encounter with Batman is as threatening as Hell. I never expected Chung’s voice to send chills down my spine, but one line does the job for me. It’s compelling, enthralling, spicy, and you will never anticipate when it happens. Quinzel’s personality uncannily mirrors Cory Michael Smith’s Edward Nygma in Fox’s Gotham. There needs to be more of her on the show.\n\nIn Gotham, I expected Nicholas A’Gosto’s Harvey Dent to eventually transform into Two-Face… Instead, that never happened. In Caped Crusader, Dent is in his own head about holding political power. This version of Dent is a blend of Tommy Lee Jones’s from Schumacher’s Batman Forever and Aaron Eckhart’s from Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Dent is portrayed as a cocky defense attorney, although he still means business. The proper designers incorporate the infamous coin into the character’s personality.\n\nHowever, the funny part is the coin isn’t utilized the way fans might expect. It’s easy to shrug that off as integral to the character. Dent is so well-written that one would never stop and think about what his coin symbolizes—not in terms of choices but of humanity. With just a tad more development than Quinn, Bader has more to do as Dent. He delivers an almost gut-wrenching monologue, excellently written on the writers’ part.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Batman: Caped Crusader Season 1\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Batman: Caped Crusader is this huge project for DC Studios. The big question is: Why isn’t it the next big thing? With all the business excuses tied to Warner Bros. Discovery and Warner Bros. Animation, whose ultimate idea was it to cancel this as a project? While it may be nowhere as phenomenal as Batman: The Animated Series, its first season alone proves otherwise. At least, it is getting there. Mind you, the Detective Comics company has many live-action and animation projects related to Batman in development. There is that to take into consideration.\n\nIf anything, the series prompts modern audiences to look to what inspired it in the first place. This includes television programs, Batman (1960s) and Batman: The Animated Series. It’s difficult to compartmentalize what makes Caped Crusader so exceptional.
