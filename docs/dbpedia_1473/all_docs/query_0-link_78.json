        "text": "[WARNING!! ELEVATED SPOILER COUNT AHEAD!!]\n\nI will start this off by saying that Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata stands as easily one of my favorite anime to date. It wasn’t always this way, however. When I first watched it, I kind of gave it the “Not Bad Obama Face” while quite enjoying the main heroine’s quirk compared to the rest of the caste. However, since there’s a second season coming next April, I was reminded that I had thoroughly enjoyed the character work and went back to rewatch it. This time, I was dying of laughter much of the time. What makes this work truly remarkable is that its most poignant characteristics are appeal directly to the jaded, cynical audience of people like me who think that the greater body of anime is going to hell in a hacksaw. It achieves this, in most excellent fashion, by stretching all of the characteristics of the harem rom-com that I and many others have come to dislike to the limits of hyperbole. This anime is satire of the highest order, in the finest 1080p.\n\nThis anime’s satire runs rampant. It takes the entire Ecchi Harem Rom-Com niche and puts every aspect of it on blast. In the series’ main character, Aki Tomoya, the show unleashes the typical otaku who bumbles his way into a harem while remaining densely ignorant to the romantic aspirations of his fellow club members toward his person. Sawamura Spencer Eriri it brings the tsundere (standoffish but inwardly caring) and childhood friend tropes, while Kasumigaoka Utaha fills the role of aloof but beautiful and accomplished upperclassman, and Hyoudou Michiru is the salute to the cousin who operates in the grey area between family and romantic interest. Each of these tropes is put on blast. Each character oozes their chosen role, and some of them are actually quite aware of the trope that they are filling. However, the finishing touch is the addition of female lead Katou Megumi, who accentuates each eccentricity by being a hyperbolically normal person. At best, her trope is the low presence character, and as heroine of the show, she provides a welcome freshness in that role that enhances her place as the control variable in this tropey science experiment.\n\nThe show also makes commentary on the very concept of an “otaku.” While Tomoya represents the typical otaku on cursory inspection, it turns out that he is a highly accomplished blogger and reviewer of anime and games with a massive following as well widespread fame within his school as the flagship nerd. His popular companions, Eriri and Utaha, are both devoted otaku in their own rights, as each is an extraordinarily popular content creator. The message at the heart of the series boils down to one main point: tropes are stupid. Anybody can be an “otaku,” and people are always deeper than their immediate archetype. To further illustrate this point, Megumi, the female lead of this show, is the centerpiece of the moment that inspires Tomoya to start putting his game together. However, she appears to be the complete opposite of a stereotypical female lead. The poor girl boasts very little natural charisma and doesn’t seem to feel much of a need to stand out in any way. She is, without a doubt, perfectly average, minted ambience character material. Her low presence and general apathy toward most of the things that the other cast members are interested in makes her gradual opening up to Tomoya and the rest of the group appear powerful, but in reality her development appears that way by virtue of her much more diffuse introduction to the audience. She is, in fact, just a fairly disinterested person, rather than an empty husk, and the strong personalities of her counterparts accentuate that in the same way that she accentuates their ridiculousness.\n\nAll in all, the series is, at its most fundamental level, a commentary on tropes. It asks so many good questions: who says that a perfectly normal, somewhat withdrawn person cannot be just as important as her more enunciated counterparts? Who says a popular girl can’t be a nerd? And most importantly, who decided that these tropes were all necessary things in anime? The last point is driven particularly hard by Tomoya’s constant referral to the tropes of previous successful galge and anime throughout the series. He shies away from the prospect of actually putting together a production that ignores previously established tropes and stereotypes and established plot gimmicks. This ridiculous adherence to the “traditions of previous success” is probably the show’s most powerful statement of all. Creators need to start actually creating again.\n\nDo you enjoy satire? Have you ever read Ionesco’s Rhinoceros? If so, hit me up on Twitter @EHyungNim! If you haven’t read Rhinoceros, you should. And if you don’t like satire, then you are a pansy and I want nothing to do with you.\n\n-Hyung\n\n[SPOILARINO PASTARINO]\n\nSo last week I got posterized for the quality of my last post because I made a lot of larger, sweeping judgments about Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, but this week I am a changed man! No longer will I pontificate about what the greater public deserves. I shall now do what I do best: center everything on me!\n\nOut of all of the elements of a story, be it an anime, drama, movie, or book, the characters of a story stand closest to the reader. Therefore, when an anime qualifies for my “Unfinished Business” writing, it is typically characters that prove to be the driving force behind that occurrence. So, without further ado, I will now lay out how to avoid ending up on being featured on Weeb Wednesday for all of the wrong reasons.\n\nWhen building characters, there are three big things that make a character a quality reflection of writing talent. The first is their orientation. The character is an extension of the world in which they exist and should reflect the influences and pressures of that world. This is often done well, although not always creatively, but when it is not done well, it will detract mightily from any narrative. The second is consistency, which refers to the character’s consistency of behavior and logic. This doesn’t necessarily mean that I desire characters who don’t change, as a character who never changes isn’t really fun to watch/read. Rather, it means that, barring a big change that would likely qualify as one of the climactic events of that character’s life, a character who makes a decision based on a certain logic or thought process continues to use those basic foundations for his decision making. A character who goes from following his faith in his god or gods wouldn’t change that process unless he had a damn good reason. The third, and final, factor is much more subjective, but it’s incredibly important to me: believability. A character’s behavior should be believable. This is about subtlety and nuance, which means that your character can’t go from hoping to build a bright future for himself and his friends to deciding that some part of the population needs to be wiped out without a really, really good reason. A character who simply oscillates between two binaries isn’t interesting, and the clumsiness of their construction is really, really, really obvious. If a character is kept grounded in who they are and progress in a believable manner, they should be able to avoid ending up in “Unfinished Business,” so keep these three factors in mind moving forward, especially if you write!\n\nOrientation\n\nAll three of these factors are important but typically manifest at varying levels of strength from character to character, so I’ll give you an example for each factor of a character that I felt exemplified a high level of quality in that particular area. For orientation, that character is Makishima Shōgo, the main antagonist in Psycho Pass.\n\nShōgo makes a good example of excellent orientation by occupying a unique space within the Psycho Pass world. In Psycho Pass, everyone’s psychological health and potential for violence and crime is judged by a color system, or hue, that is monitored by the Sibyl System. Anyone whose hue passes a certain point becomes known as a Latent Criminal and is either brought into custody for therapy or eliminated altogether in the hope of creating the perfect society. Shōgo, however, is different from everyone else. In the eyes of Sibyl, he has no hue, which means that he cannot be judged at any time. While he may be murdering people and pursuing other crimes, law enforcement, whose ability to take action is limited by Sibyl’s judgments, cannot touch him because, according to the system, he doesn’t exist.\n\n“But Hyung, how can he be an example of great orientation if he’s an anomaly?” says Reddit. Well, the key here is that Shōgo’s character’s problem itself is fundamentally rooted in the existence of the preexisting system. Shōgo the antagonist cannot exist without the world in which author Urobuchi Gen placed him. His reasons for becoming an antagonist are rooted in an existential problem. Because society does not acknowledge his existence, he does not exist. His nonexistence causes Shōgo to realize that he could do quite literally anything he pleased without penalty, which brings his mental state to a boiling point that remains invisible from the society around him. The character’s construction explores elements of Jean Baudrillard’s simulacrum, as the pressure caused by Shōgo’s discovery leads him to want to destroy the system by illustrating its flaws to the public. Thus, Shōgo is fundamentally tied to the system and the world that he opposes because he exists outside of it. Despite being an outsider, he is probably the character most closely attuned to the world that he inhabits.\n\nConsistency\n\nConsistency is a difficult thing to grasp. I know that it eludes me in many of my characters that I’ve written in my fiction work, and I know that on the most basic level, it’s a pretty easy thing to pull off. Its absence is jarring and horrifying to read or watch, but its presence largely goes unnoticed. To highlight this trait done well, I have chosen one of the most obvious, blunt instrument over the head examples possible: Kobayakawa Sena, the protagonist from my beloved Eyeshield 21.\n\nIn a cast of ridiculous characters who cross the line from caricature into the outright ridiculous, Sena experiences the largest amount of change while still maintaining a certain consistency. As a perpetual gopher for bullies throughout much of his life, Sena is extraordinarily timid and utterly lacking in self confidence at the beginning of the anime/manga. However, he grows into a character who is able to reconcile with his awakening competitive spirit and goes on to become the greatest running back that the world had ever seen, etc. etc. The key element of his character, however, is that coming out of his shell is a perpetual struggle for Sena. Despite being kind and hardworking, he is constantly battling against his own poor self esteem. While this proves to be a consistent source of frustration for readers and viewers, Sena represents a very real struggle between personality, which tends not to change very much very quickly, and the discovery of immense talent, which is, by its own nature, an explosive change. The friction between his beaten down self and his unparalleled ability to run faster than anybody else in the world is what makes his character good, and that simply wouldn’t be possible if he discovered his talent and suddenly decided that rather than develop as a person, he’d just think of himself as the second coming. Character consistency keeps Sena grounded, and while I am not necessarily his biggest fan (all hail the mighty and terrible Hiruma!), it is an incredibly well done aspect of his character and displays absolutely marvelous patience on the part of writer Inagaki Riichiro.\n\nBelievability\n\nAt the end of the day, I believe that the foundation of all good stories is the struggle of a person’s humanity versus crisis, which means that the existence of purely evil characters who are there purely for evil’s sake is just a lazy cop out. An antagonist is not necessarily an enemy of all things good and wonderful. Rather, they are the protagonist of a different story who come into contact with the work in question’s protagonist. In other words, it should appear equally viable that another work be created that follows that antagonist’s story. To illustrate this concept, I will cheat egregiously in abuse of my powers as chosen blogger by selecting two characters: Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wen Li from Tanaka Yoshiki’s Ginga Eiyū Densetsu, or Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\n\nThis selection is cheating for another reason. Not only have I chosen two characters, but I have chosen both sides of the conflict that is central to Gin’eiden’s plot. The two characters in question illustrate my earlier point about opposing stories well because the plot of the anime quite literally follows their stories in direct opposition to each other. The premise of the story is that two large galactic political entities exist on opposite ends of a galaxy and are almost always at war with one another. Each side has a genius commander who rises to command of their forces. The first, the underdog, is Yang Wen Li of the Free Planets Alliance, while his opponent is Reinhard von Lohengramm of the Galactic Empire. Both are rising stars in their respective empires, with Reinhard rising due to his combination of immense talent and political backing, while Wen Li rises despite his own government. Neither character is necessarily portrayed as an archetypical villain in the series. Rather, both of their stories receive equal time as the work follows the course of both of their lives to their respective conclusions. Each man operates according to his own unique ambitions and follows his own particular logic in his decision making process. As the events of the saga develop, each man responds to his personal problems in his own way, and they all manage to respond to external stimuli in ways that fit their particular rationale. For Reinhard, everything he does revolves around his ambition to change the corrupt politics of the Empire, whereas Wen Li constantly does everything he can to stay alive while doing his duty so that he can one day retire and live in peace, far away from all of the workings of war and government. While parts of their personalities change over time, the core of Reinhard and Wen Li remains roughly the same throughout the story, so the characters’ actions and behaviors are still recognizable as the plot progresses. For a story that banked everything on excellent portrayals of these two characters, the believability of both Reinhard and Wen Li’s characters is what made them truly memorable. They are both humans, and act as such, influenced by their personal rhetoric and the pressures of the world around them in ways that suit only them. To this day I am convinced that no other work of fiction has characterized two opposed individuals so well and so completely.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you’ve probably noticed, there are some grounds for overlap between these categories, and that’s okay. No character has each facet of their construction strictly cordoned off from the others, so it makes sense that the categories are all interconnected. In each case, these are characters whose orientation, consistency, and believability are well put together, so any of them could have been a single example that could cover all three. If something is bothering you in a show or book or movie that you are watching, take a moment and evaluate the characters. If they’re bad, they’re probably lacking in any of these qualities and you should feel free to drop that work right then and there!\n\nIf you’re a fellow writer, I hope that you agree with what I’ve written here. If you’re a reader, I hope the same. This at least will clear up exactly the types of characters that you will not likely find in the “Unfinished Business” posts, and might just give you some ideas for shows to add to your watch list.\n\nAs always, feel free to flame me on Twitter @EHyungNim!\n\n-Hyung\n\n[WEATHER FORECASTS 80% CHANCE OF SPOILERS]\n\nFriends, today we must convene for yet another discussion of an anime dropped and hours of life saved. The subject of this investigation is Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, a zombie-filled, steampunk, half-human, half-zombie protagonist toting action thriller set in a world where the huff and puff of steampunk industry meets the traditions of Edo period Japan. Sounds tantalizing, does it not? Unfortunately, despite incredible art and animation, I dropped this show, not because it failed to hold my attention, but because it pushed me away. It was, in summation, a gorgeous artistic venture with a world maxed out on the cool factor that was wasted on a feeble attempt at a story and characters.\n\nI was going to delay this Unfinished Business because I had hoped to put together something different, but alas, current events have forced my hand, so here I am. This was a show that I actually had reasonably high hopes for. I really like steampunk things, though part of that comes from the dearth of steampunk that I have had the opportunity to experience–call it the allure of the unfamiliar. The show itself was visually stunning, both in terms of art and animation. I would not be opposed to owning a Kabaneri poster, for example. However, the story suffered from issues that forced me to drop it after seven episodes.\n\nThe world building that occurred in Kabaneri, while not altogether explained, was fun. The kabane (zombies) were deadly, in the classical zombie tradition of “get bit, eat s***,” and humanity was so pressed that they had retreated to walled frontier settlements and travelled in giant steel trains. We are immediately greeted with both the deadliness of the foe and the pride of the bushi (warrior) caste in the opening moments of the show, and the gravity of the danger faced by the people who undertake the train journeys is crystal clear. This show, like so many others before it, offers an opportunity for an exploration of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Instead…we got Kabaneri.\n\nI had originally dropped the anime after the introduction of the “Black Fog,” a sort of, sentient zombie snowball. It was literally just thousands of zombies stuck together in a giant blob, controlled by a more powerful zombie at its core. To be honest, I was almost willing to suspend disbelief until I saw that the Black Fog looked like a poorly drawn gumby imitation. That ended the show for me, or so I thought until my friend Kevin told me to watch the seventh episode, which was, in an approximation of his words, “So incredibly bad that you have to watch it.” The man was more right than he knew.\n\nIn fact, Kevin was so right that he prompted a ten minute diatribe from me lamenting the fact that people were actually paid to write Biba, the main villain of the story, as a functional character. He stands, in my opinion, as the most incredibly poorly executed villain that I have had the misfortune to watch/read in years, easily. The man felt betrayed by his father, the Shogun, whose conduct during a moment of panic had caused Biba to be injured, and his immediate response can be roughly summarized as, “Dad’s weak, therefore we must cull all weak people from the human genome.” How will he do this, you ask? By destroying the walled population centers that allow humanity to survive in the first place because they shelter weak people, of course!\n\nSome would argue that this is a logical line of character progression under the stress of fear, such as Crunchyroll’s Peter Fobian, who wrote the following:\n\nBiba’s faction follows a different acts as a philosophical opponent to the Kotetsujo, working as a polished military unit despite operating under the selfish belief that the strong will survive and the weak shall perish. Although initially stronger than the Kotetsujo, their goal is later revealed to be destructive, attempting to create an ideal world reflecting Biba’s philosophy. Unsurprisingly, this requires tearing down the boundaries that protect the weakest of humanity from the kabane and creating a new predatory world with kabaneri as the top of the food chain. The plan is fundamentally flawed in that it requires the selfless sacrifice of two of his own crew who would represent survivors in his ideal world, revealing the failure of Biba’s convictions long before his downfall.\n\nThis is a logical fallacy. It is not only a bizarre and unreasoned character progression, but also represents a writing cop out. The fact that someone sat down and decided that because his dad got him hurt, Biba would decide to essentially destroy the greater part of humanity, is utterly mystifying. If Biba has displayed the resourcefulness to build an effective and efficient military unit that is highly dedicated to his cause, then he would also be conscious of the fact that without population centers, resupply would be utterly impossible. Further, his whole band seems to buy into his mad plan, which is even more ridiculous, because there’s not a zombie snowball’s chance in hell that nobody asked the question, “How do we eat when we’ve gotten everyone killed?” When I realized that the deepest that Biba’s character was going to go was “I’ll kill 90% of everyone, but I’ll have a really bad, deeply rooted reason for it,” that was it. No more Kabaneri for me, thanks.\n\nAs a bonus round, I would like to take a moment to talk about what it was that got me to write this now rather than later. Another critic, whom I more respectfully disagree with, is Digibro. Digibro, is a well-spoken man with a discerning eye for anime (his breakdown of the first episode of Stein’s Gate put that eye fully on display, by Thunder!). However, when he released his Kabaneri video last week, there were parts of his commentary that I found I could not reconcile with my own standards for the media that I consume. He took Kabaneri and focused on what it did really well, which was the mix of action, art, and animation that blended so well for the greater part of the work. The problem was that he also argued that people that were roasting Kabaneri for its poor story and characters should have seen that it was bad and would continue to be bad, making their critiques illogical. In the video, Digibro said that:\n\n“What bothers me about Kabaneri’s critical reception is not the fact that a lot of people didn’t like it, nor the fact that there’s a lot of elements to it that I think are worth celebrating. It’s mostly the fact that people are acting so surprised that they didn’t get the next FMA Brotherhood out of it. I feel like everyone has in their heads this mythical idea of the perfect anime that starts out hype and cool and then develops a huge cast of memorable, lovable characters, and a winding narrative full of epic plot twists and reveals and emotional character moments, but also badass action scenes and hype and it’s dark but not grim dark and funny but not goofy and it’s only just convoluted enough that you can kind of look past it, and I really think that we only got that show once, and we got it because it was a readaptation of a show that had already proven such a massive, worldwide success that they would’ve been crazier not to make it all over again. And as much as I appreciate Brotherhood and how well it captures the seemingly worldwide shared idea of what a perfect adventure story should be, I also think that there’s a million other kinds of stories that are maybe not so perfect but are worth telling anyway. Kabaneri was fine. It was dumb, but it wasn’t broken. It didn’t ask you to accept a plotline which was completely at ends with the rules of its own universe…it’s just a cool action show that doesn’t bore you to tears with too much rote dialogue and convoluted bulls***.”\n\nThis, to me, however, is not an effective argument for Kabaneri’s acceptance. Up to this point, I honestly had very few arguments against him. However, by taking the reception of the work, which is reflective of poor storytelling and character development, and turning that back on the audience receiving it, is fundamentally incorrect. I hesitate to put words in his mouth, but it sounds dangerously like he asks us to put aside our standards for what it is that we hope to see in an anime, in favor of whatever it is that those making them decide to give us. This, however, is similar to what I have said before about Open World Games. We should be judging these works on whether or not the overall package of qualities that they bring to the table is good, not on whether or not a package is present.\n\nWhile I do believe that Kabaneri had its redeeming qualities, I fail to understand how it is that I, who tragically have not finished FMA Brotherhood, or any other anime fan should be willing to compromise our conceptualization of what is or is not a quality show based on a set of criteria that shift depending on how stupid a show could be. While, as Digibro said, Biba existed purely to give Ikoma a girl to save and a bad guy to kill, it doesn’t mean that we have to accept that–let alone that we should.\n\nMy final point on the subject of standards, however, boils down to this: my real beef with Kabaneri would not have been as pronounced if not for the fact that the “cool” factor was so high. Digibro stated that the cool factor was clearly the studio’s focus, and that the show should therefore only really be judged by that, but I would argue that to create such a cool world and fail to give it a story worth experiencing is a massive failure. I think that at the heart of anime and other shows are aspects of the human experience, whether it be through comedy, sports, or a zombie-snowball horror action thriller. There was no human experience here, which is a true tragedy for the artists who worked so hard to bring the animated aspects of the work to fruition. It is not the show’s existence that is a tragedy, but rather that the work of talented people is going to be forever tainted by subpar written work paired with it. In fact, the coolness of Kabaneri only goes to enunciate its greater failures in writing and development. Was it dumb? Yes. But that did not necessarily mean that it needed to stay that way.\n\n-Hyung\n\nWhat did you think of Kabaneri? Think I’m a pompous fool with too much hair and not enough brain?
