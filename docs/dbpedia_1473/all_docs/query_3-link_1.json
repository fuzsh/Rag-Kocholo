        "text": "Japanese game designer and supervisor\n\nMakoto Kano (加納 誠, Kanō Makoto, born October 30, 1950), also credited as Makoto Kanoh pre-1995,[1][2] is a Japanese game designer and supervisor. He was born in Kyoto, Japan.\n\nKano began working for Nintendo in 1974. He was one of the original designers in Nintendo's creative department. Originally, he designed toys and board games before working on the Nintendo Beam Gun series. Kano eventually became one of the lead designers of the Game & Watch series. By 1984, he was heavily involved in several Nintendo R&D1 games, including Hogan's Alley, Gyromite, and more specifically the Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Famicom Wars series. Some other projects he has worked on at Nintendo include Super Metroid, the Super Scope for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Mario & Wario.\n\nKano is credited with creating several early Nintendo characters during the 1980s. Ultimately, his best known achievement may have been creating the concepts of the Metroid, Famicom Wars, and Kid Icarus universe.[3]\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Position 1975 Nintendo Beam Gun Designer 1986 Metroid Concept design, scenario Kid Icarus Concept design 1988 Famicom Wars 1989 Famicom Detective Club: The Girl Who Stands Behind Supervisor 1991 Metroid II: Return of Samus Designer 1992 Super Scope 6 Producer The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins Designer Battle Clash Director 1993 Mario & Wario Producer 1994 Super Metroid 1995 Teleroboxer Artwork 2000 Pokémon Stadium 2 Artwork\n\nInterviews\n\n[edit]\n\nIwata Asks: Game & Watch Iwata Asks: Game & Watch - Development Staff Interview"
