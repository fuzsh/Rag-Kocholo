        "text": "Westway sadly ended on World Service at the beginning of November, after eight years on air. To hear the show in its earlier days, click on the BBC7 link on Westway's Home Page, and Drama Schedule for when it's on, week by week - or Listen Again and Schedule.\n\nYOUR COMMENTS:\n\nWell, nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to the world service.There's me thinking things cant get any worse after the short-wave transmission round the Stuttgart area was axed making it really difficult for me to find any decent reception during the hours when it's possible for me to listen and now Westway is heading west. We've had to put up with some pretty brutal changes over the last couple of years and you have finally succeeded in making the world service into a radio version of CNN and I hate CNN.\n\nI never thought Id see the day when I would voluntarily tune my radio to Deutschlandfunk but there are some people who just dont want to hear wall to wall news coverage and I hope the BBC will survive to one day realise the error of its ways.Goodbye Westway. I don't even think intensive care will save you now.\n\nGreg, Germany\n\nI have been listening to westway every saturday kenyan time only to be saddened by hearing tha the programmed has to come to an end, its my sincere hope that your will instead bring something more earcatching to all listeners. Thank you you so much for your programm may God bless bbc and all its staff across the world as they\n\nbring us events as they happen around the world.\n\nJaphet, Nigeria\n\nI been a fan of westway for years. (since my secondary school days in Antigua).I just love being on the edge of my seat every Friday and Saturday. Now I hear it's being axed at the end of October and replaced with news? you guys wanna be like CNN, well trust me you'll drive me away. Come on man, please reconsider along with thousands of others from around the world. Please don't kill off this off.If this falls on deaf ears,let me just say Thank you, Thank you guys (the cast and production staff) for keeping us on the edge every week for 8 years.But please reconsider.\n\nMarvin, USA\n\nI was very sad when I heard yesterday after the Westway Programme that Westway will be closing down at the end of October. I hope the BBC finds a fitting programme to replace it.\n\nJonathan, Cote d'Ivoire\n\nPLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS SHOW OFF AIR\n\nPLEASE RECONSIDER .....................\n\nTeresa\n\nI will really miss the programme — any chance of a re-think?\n\nDavid, France\n\nPlease send me a photocard of the Westway cast. I will treasure it\n\nalways and will miss the series terribly. It allowed me to feel\n\nconnected to people all over the world, knowing that so many were\n\nlistening simultaneously. Would you possibly consider raffling off\n\nautographed copies of the photocards in the future?\n\nHelena, USA\n\nI’ve found in the past Jamshed to be a complete wimp and Gabriella a nightmare with all of the ‘muffin’ speak, but these last few episodes have struck so close to home, and seem to have been written through experience, that they have been totally unmissable. Any way to keep it running with the remaining cast?\n\nJonathan, Singapore\n\nI am like Sam, delighted that in a couple of week's time Westway will be history. For too long my sleep has been shattered by that jangling theme tune then if I don't put my hand out and turn down the volume control a torrent of mawkish Politically Correct stereotypes all out of \"Central Casting\". the plot lines are so predictable and of course have a hidden agenda.\n\nI will be delighted to hear that Jamshed has been consigned to the Garden Shed and that horrible theme tune is heard no more.\n\nSteve, UK\n\nHaving listened to the programme from its inception as a teaching tool; Fizzer and his vernacular.....etc, I have nevertheless grown to enjoy the program and will miss it. Jamshed was always the party-pooping boring character but killing him off gives me no pleasure.\n\nMaybe the mistake was to crush too many issues into two weeky episodes.\n\nI live in multi-cultural east London, even George Galloway is let in, fact is stranger than fiction; nevertheless I listen to the 'Everyday tale of Farming Folk' in Borsetshire and have done so for 35 years. A fellow Archars fan of mine once said in response to my 'what do you think about....' \"I dont like too much excitement.\"\n\nPerhaps there is a lesson to be learnt from his remark ?\n\nChris, UK\n\nTonight's ep was superb. Congratulations to the writer, director and of course the actors playing Jamshed, Janet and Gabriella. It was highly moving, without a trace of mawkishness, and so real. I was present with my brother and sisters as our mother slipped away, and it was like reliving the moment again; terrible sorrow at the parting, but deep relief that a loved one's suffering was over.\n\nI shake my head in disbelief that the programme has been axed and that there remain only a couple more episodes. What is going on? Tonight's episode proved how good the programme can be - I've enjoyed it since the start, and while there have been better times than others, it has always been informative, thought-provoking and entertaining, and very well performed. I'm going to miss the characters terribly. On a radio drama, you get much more involved than on TV, and it won't be just Jamshed whose loss I'll be mourning, but the whole cast.\n\nOn a general note about World service schedules, finally: No more light entertainment slot, no more Westway. The World Service used to be one of my favourite stations as it had such a diverse mixture of output: news, classical music, rock, pop, drama, comedy, science, arts, politics. It's just a stodgy unimaginative drone now. I still have some old London Calling mags from the past and marvel at the richness of the schedules then compared to today's repetitive blocks of programmes! I won't be listening to the World Service any more.\n\nChris\n\nDoes the BBC ask us what we would like? NO! I only hear glib talk by\n\n'planners' about how they want to concentrate more on news and no\n\nlonger offer entertainment programmes on World service.\n\nVery frankly, for those of us who listen every day to the World\n\nservice, it's already shocking that we cannot listen on short wave in\n\nEurope during the daytime, but to axe entertainment is an appalling\n\nthing to do. I used to think Westway was rubbish, but I have grown to\n\nenjoy an occasional dip into the plot when out in the car - at least\n\nhere in Holland we have medium wave.\n\nAnd where did 'Just a Minute' disappear to? There are loads of nice\n\nprogrammes that I can also get here on long wave Radio 4 that would\n\ngo down very well on World Service. But, no, everywhere these days\n\nthe BBC has to 'compete' in the 'market place' and such BS as the\n\n'marketing boys' come out with. The BBC DOES NOT NEED TO COMPETE! When will the increasingly snide, ambitious idiots who seem to run\n\nthings begin to realise that the Beeb is unique, one of a kind in the\n\nWorld, a beacon of quality that people love dearly. Please, no more\n\nCNBBC on the TV or the radio. Let them do their thing as cheaply and\n\nbadly as they do,forget all the stupid slogans, jingles and\n\ncatchphrases, and just get on with being the best, as you always were. Is anybody listening? I fear not; probably wasting my time. All the best to anyone who cares.\n\nKingsley, Netherlands\n\nThe overwhelming response to the decision to finish Westway, is NO, DON'T! When this programme gives so much pleasure, and attracts mainly positive comments, why cannot the powers that be, change their plans, and bring back the programme with a suitable gap to reconstruct the series. This obviously would need some alteration to the \"final\" script, but it would be the only honest thing to do. I do not want more music, or plays, just Westway, which enriched the lives of so many throughout the world, and for which there is no excuse for removing. It is arrogant of the BBC to ignore the comments and suggestions for keeping the programme on.\n\nGeoffrey\n\nI'm a religious listener of your drama soup opera Westway. But it's sad to hear that you will be bringing this exiting show to an end sonetimes at the end of this month. I'm a lover of drama and other plays on radio. I'm a blind person with great interest in radio drama as my kind of movie. And in this light Westway is presently playing the role of a movie going for me.\n\nJeff, Liberia\n\nMay I add my voice to the huge, world wide protest at the axing of this popular series.\n\nI listened, some time ago now to an explanation on Radio 4 Feedback from a senior executive at the World Service of the reasons for closing down the programme. The spokesman talked of increasing the quality drama output on the World Service, with Westway being unsuitable for the new schedules. He promoted an expansion of the Saturday evening play slot which, while an excellent example of top class broadcasting, is unlikelyto appeal to the worldwide following for a twice weekly 15 minute serial.\n\nWith the ending of Westway, the World Service are effectively disenfranchising a sizeable world wide audience. Are the listening figures for the World Service so good that senior BBC executives can gamble with a new schedule which does not include one of the most universally popular programmes?\n\nShame on you World Servce! Have you never heard of the maxim - if it ain't broken, don't fix it?\n\nIt is not too late for a rethink, and a climb down by the ambtious staff member who sought to make his/her mark with this radical and foolish change.\n\nBring back Westway after Christmas! This would allow script writers and actors time to gather their ideas for a sparkling continuation of an excellent series.\n\nMany thanks to the cast and production staff.\n\nGinnie\n\nI am sorry that Westway is to finish this month. Of course it has had its highs and alas right now in the dying moments, if I can use that expression, it is having a low.\n\nIt's a shame you couldn't end on a more positive note and let us listeners remember the last episodes with a smile.\n\nAnyway thanks to all involved and good luck for the future.\n\nMichael, Hong Kong\n\nAs one accepts the fact that every beginning has its ending, good or bad, we must therefore know that all good things in life must eventually come to an end. Some endings may be joyful, some are very, very painful. I am sure come October, every listener of the Westway will painfully miss the programme as it departs, our only hope is that by that time you must have found another entertaining programme that can soften the pain of departure that Westway will bring.\n\nIsyaku, Nigeria\n\nI cannot believe that you are really going to let Westway finish next month. It is far too important a programme. Where else can we find important issues discussed, like female circumcision and other culture clashes, or deep moral dilemmas like Gabreilla's abortion, and should people help her keep it a secret. All this is done, not in some pompous politically correct diatribe, but through rich and thrilling drama.\n\nWe have many soaps and drama series on television. They consider themselves daring because they deal with drugs or teenage pregnancy. These are always appearing in plays. Westway has dared to go much further, yet has never forgotten to remain exciting drama, has never patronised or \"dumbed down\".\n\nMy friends, colleagues, family and people in local shops and on trains and buses are always discussing the storylines. None of us can wait for the next episode, and all of us listen to it a second time on Sunday. How can you possibly take this wonderful, vital drama away from us?\n\nSimon, UK\n\nJamshed's dying, David's in love with Jane (again!!) and 'Westway' is on its last legs; after becoming the best series on radio? Whoever said life was fair? BBC should really consider bringing back light hearted stuff like 'Just a minute'. It would really help\n\nWill, Nigeria\n\nI have listened to West Way for only a couple of years but have become a great fan of the programme. Why is it ending? I work in Africa where I normally listen to it. I understand it is going to be replaced by news and music. This you are being fed all day anyway on masses of channels. So why take away this really interesting and involving programme which reflects so many issues in modern society? Please reconsider the decision.\n\nAnne, Uganda\n\nI would also like to voice my protests along with all the others against the imminent axing of Westway, what a non-sensical and detromental decision that leaves the audience simply asking why? why was this crazy decision made? and do the BBC pay any attention to the wealth of dissenting voices apparent on both the website and The World Service. There is not nearly enough entertainment and drama on the BBC and removing one of Westway's calibre from it's schedule just beggars believe.\n\nMichael, UK\n\nI have been an enthusiastic listener to the BBC since the Caribbean got its own frequency a year or so ago. And when I found Westway I became a keen fan, especially when I heard the name of one of the team of writers - Pat Cumper - someone I taught over 30 years ago! Now I hear that the series is to come to an end.....why? I must say I particularly look forward to Wednesdays and Fridays when the episodes are broadcast - as other(s) of your listeners have commented, it makes a change from the news! What will you be giving us as a replacement? Janet, Jamaica\n\nI wrote to you a few weeks back saying how good I think Westway is, and what a shame that drama with such worldwise relevance and skilful construction is being taken off the airwaves. All that is still true for me, but having dropped in and out of your website over the past few weeks I notice that the worldwide community of listeners who have been in touch have gone quiet, including me. This is fine, except that it means that dear old Sam has been sitting at the top of the list for weeks, no doubt giving the executives who decided to axe the programme some self satisfied comfort in their decision.\n\nWell, I do not think it should be left to Sam to have the last word. So, in the hope that those who have appreciated the writing, acting and directing of Westway will join me in saying so, again if necessary, I write to thank you for all the work and insight you have managed to convey, and to reiterate my view that it is a great shame that the programme is to end, for it is capable of doing so much good, and to wish everyone well.\n\nDavid, UK\n\nI am a listener here in Sierra Leone and I really enjoy your last episodes on the 'Bondo'. Thanks for the programme and I hope most Sierra Leonean mothers will follow the step of Salamatu.\n\nI am also sad that Westway is coming to a close. Will there be another drama series like Westway?\n\nAbdulai, Sierra Leone\n\nI once again realise this is another waste of my time, but can the 'programers' not bite the bullet and pull this rubbish of the air immeadiately.\n\nUnfortunately as an insomniac I occassionally find the\n\ncontents of this silly unreal program drifting into my headphones which are then removed within nano seconds. However as I attempt to judge time in the darkness of my bed I unfortunately pick up sad little snippets of PC scripted drivel frustratingly played out before the start of the next program. Last nights masccara running pathos followed by stoic gallows humour was abysimal. The person responsible obviously hadn't a clue on reaction. It was just so so poor. I have complained over the broadcast of this 'soap' a few times, thankfully someone somewhere has seen the logic of dropping its PC propoganda. Regratfully the BBC in its fear of the open society that it contends this soap reflects will not tell me who the luminary who took the correct decesion in dropping this farce is in order that I simply praise him for his foresight.\n\nSam\n\nI must confess to feeling self-conscious about enjoying Westway - a bit like admitting to some slightly embarrassing secret weakness. However I've been listening to it more or less regularly for about five years. I found yesterday's episode, when Jamshed is told his cancer is not responding to chemotherapy, absolutely gripping. Every day there must be people who find themselves in this appalling situation, but hearing the discussion with the doctors and Jamshed's reaction, made the whole thing far more realistic and thought-provoking than just hearing a statistic, or even a short interview, on the same topic. The programme was obviously thoroughly researched, so I felt I was listening in on a genuine consulation.\n\nTurning to your \"Have Your Say\" page, I found literally dozens of people protesting that the show is coming to an end. I would wonder how on earth the BBC can ignore all these fervent protests - except that you've already shown that you're quite capable of ignoring the even more fervent protests about the cutting of the short wave services.\n\nWhy is the BBC so determined to alienate its listeners? Are you trying to compete with CNN? You don't have to compete with CNN, for heaven's sake, you're the BBC! You've got faithful listeners all over the world who love just the way you are - or used to be, until recently. At the moment you seem to be doing your best to drive away your existing public rather than to attract new listeners.\n\nAnna, Italy\n\nI am very disappointed that Westway is to end, as I have always tried to stay awake, in the UK, to the hear the latest. And would sometimes to doze off, to be awakened by a recognisable voice from the cast, and feel cheered by the characters who were so well depicted, with humour and some depth.\n\nI would like to know why it is being axed! I do not want music on the World Service, for Radio 3 exists for that, and I fear it is another attempt by the BBC to reduce the programmes most people like. to be replaced by some popular trash.\n\nRichard\n\nJust wanted to add my voice to all the others. I was just getting ready to write to ask if you couldn't have Westway on the air three times a week instead of Wednesday & Friday, and now I see that it is cancelled. Above all others it has been my favorite program for several years. Too bad, how sad.\n\nGloria, Connecticut\n\nPlease listen to your listeners and don’t axe this wonderful programme. Like so many other people in the UK, I discovered it through a bout of insomnia when Radio 4 was off air. It was one of the reasons I why I decided to buy a digital radio, and I was delighted to find it being repeated on BBC 7 – what a great way to start Saturdays! As another person said, I don’t want endless repetitions of news on the World Service, and neither it seems do lots of other around the world. This little programme existence demonstrates all that is good about the mixing of cultures in modern day Britain. Please don’t do this – let Westway stay!\n\nSophia, UK\n\nI love westway - is there any possiblilty you might consider to put all the eight years of westway on one or two cd´s and all the fans be able to listen to it again, after buying the cd´s for some euros / pounds ... Westway is always up to date .\n\nAngelika\n\nI totally agree with the writer of the first letter on the list today. (David, UK) Don't your planners listen to comments?\n\nMaybe you are intending to kill off all the characters before October. You have already disposed of Jamshed's much wanted baby and have given Jamshed time to have the final episode as his death scene. Now I am fearing you'll destroy the Health Centre with either a terrorist bomb or a plane crashing into it.\n\nIf you have run out of ideas, why not ask listeners for new story lines.\n\nAs for story lines, the last update on the Website was a month ago. What is the reason for that?\n\nLike many who have written, I am very tired of endless news on World Service. Let's have a little light entertainment, please.\n\nAnne, Kenya\n\nAlong with so many others I feel that the WS has made a huge mistake in closing the series. I also feel huge frustration that the feedback which you are publishing on the website seems to evoke no response from planners at all. The themes you cover, the quality of the writing and the diversity of the output make this one of the finest serial formats I know.\n\nAnyway, in a dejected but hopefully purposeful way I have written today to Robert Hanks, whose reviews on radio I read with pleasure. Today I feel particularly motivated after listening last night to the fearless handling of the testicular cancer issue. Gripping, just like the work you have done on HIV and all the other themes.\n\nOn the one occasion when I heard a planner talking about this I heard that the shift in WS broadcasting was to put creative output on at the weekends, and that there just was no room for Westway. This at least should be challenged. The programme is very important in my view.\n\nDavid, UK\n\nI have started listening to Westway. I happen to come across this show when i was doing my dissertation. this programme helped me get past the whole thing.\n\nI am very sad to hear that it coming to the end. this show is better than the soaps we get on tv and very easy to follow! Why are you ending it!!!!!!!! It was good while it lasted, but...\n\nPetrina, 22, student\n\nOh, how l shall miss Westway. Since finding BBC7, it has been my constant companion, and Westway has been a real favourite.H ow I have laughed at Chidi, and how l have cried with Margaret. Mel's giggle always makes me giggle and how l love to hate pompous David. All in all, it's a wonderful mix of personalities and storylines and brings back memories of my home in Shepherds Bush. It will leave a huge gap for many people if Westway is to be taken off the air. Surely us tax payers hold a little sway somewhere along the line.........\n\nTo writers and cast members l say a huge thank-you. You have brightened many a bad day for me. Perhaps someone, somewhere is listening.\n\nSue, UK\n\nWestway abgesperrt! My friend jerry will be heartbroken. we always listen to Westway in the kitchen; last time he cut his finger\n\nwhen he found out that Gabs was pregnant. I think he probably fancies her. i always liked chidi myself. He sounds very cute, and loyal. I wondered if maybe you still have one of those Westway cards with the cast photo on it, then we could hang it up in the kitchen. Even though its coming to an end, thanks for all the storylines and great characters. It always gives us something to rag about at work!\n\nShannon (and Jerry), Berlin\n\nI was so sad to read of Westway being cut from the wonderful offerings of the BBC Worldservice. That is the one of the main reasons I purchased my XM Satellite Radio. I have faithfully recorded the show on cassette tape and have every episode from March 9, 1999. But now all my taping will be at an end when Westway ends.\n\nI know you have \"killed off\" a few characters the \"Westway way\"... The sad thing now is every character of Westgrove Park will be but a memory... How did Fizza manage that? Oh, working with the BBC Worldservice management, I suspect... What a character! Cheerio, I will miss all of you greatly... Thanks for the years, and over 200 tapes, of enjoyment. Fizza you are still my hero!\n\nBob Flood, Texas\n\nWhat can BBC decision makers be thinking of? This is one of my 'must hear' programs, every week. Please don't let them do this! How many negative letters does Westway get?? Compare that to how many positive?? Send those programmers back to the drawing board!!\n\nSaralee, Singapore\n\nI would like to support all the writers who have written expressing their dismay at the cancellation of Westway in October. The serial gives a more relevent picture of life in the U.K more than any current affair talks can and which are recycled from week to week.\n\nIt is more realistic than The Archers which is a travesty of rural life. I suppose someone in the World Service Management wishes to make his or her mark and so cancels a popular programme to achieve this.\n\nDavid\n\nI just want to add my voice to the protest. Westway is one of the reasons I tune into BBC. Although I live in Europe, I have given up watching TV and am now tuned most waking hours to BBC. I don't need endless news, but entertaining and well produced drama progams like Westway. I think BBC is making a serious mistake with it's new programming policies!!\n\nClaire, Copenhagen\n\nWhat is happening??? l have just heard that my favourite show is to stop in October - what is the World service coming too? l have\n\nlistened to Westway ever since it started now 7 years ago, are the writers bored with it or is it money at the BBC?? It is a crime to stop a well-enjoyed show (judging by the letters) so please RECONSIDER and ask the BBC to continue Westway - it is bad enough to have the World service cut during the day and now l have to listen via my computer - so please keep on the programmes that are good.\n\nV de Schoene, Switzerland\n\nI have just learned about the decision to stop broadcasting Westway on the World Service. I simply can't imagine why such a step is being taken. It is an intelligent programme with a multicultural cast that makes reference to experiences that must happen to many. I was delighted when it moved to BBC7, but, really, to remove it from the World Service! Have they gone news-mad?\n\nI hope the cast and producers are aware that so many people hold the programme in the highest regard. They can be proud of their work.\n\nMrs. Simmons\n\nI've just heard on Radio 4 that Westway is going to come to an end October. That is really sad news! I've been listening to the program for a couple of years now, and it's always been weigh better than the regular daily soap junk you find on television, often quite funny but also dealing with quite serious issues like death and disease in quite a profound way. While most of your programs on the world service are great, this is really one of my favorites. I strongly hope that many more people will write in pleading for the survival of Westway, so that the people responsible for the programming might think it over. Thanks for the great work\n\nThomas, USA\n\nI´ve been very sorry about the news that Westway will stop being broadcast from October. I was so accustomed to it, I was really hooked. It isn´t just a very interesting and entertaining programme to listen to but most importantly it improves my everyday, conversation English, as I suppose it does to all other foreign listeners. This makes it a very welcome addition to the current-affairs- like vocabulary that dominates the BBC World Service. I hope it´s going to be replaced by a progamme which contains lots of conversational English as well. Thank you for all those years of Westway.\n\nFrancesca, the Netherlands\n\nI don’t suppose this will make it onto the website, as it does not toe the ‘party line’ but what is the BBC doing axing Westway? The last thing the world needs is another 24 hour rolling news service. These disastrous institutions distort the news and, where necessary, create it when it doesn’t exist. Those of us who like to listen to the World Service have already been forced to endure the same programme time and time again by the last round of cuts. Now drama is being cut. All we get is news presented by different voices and re-worded again and again. There is no attempt to cater to a mature thoughtful listener, just pandering to an imagined ‘busy lifestyle’ where people tune in for 5 minutes and then move on. Such a listener is not the core of the World Service; it is a figment of some marketing guru’s deluded and limited imagination.\n\nFor goodness’ sake keep the variety of the World Service alive. Don’t turn it into anther boring, repetitive rolling news bore-athon.\n\nRoy\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy are you removing Westway from the airwaves???\n\nDo you know what a friend this magical programme has been to those of us who travel the lonely nights alone with the radio to keep us safe/sane?\n\nThis is akin to The Archers being removed from the schedule on Radio 4!\n\nThrough sleepless pitch black nights I have found comfort in the characters and storylines of Westway!\n\nPlease reconsider your decision!\n\nI discovered the gem that is Westway some time ago in my insomniac twilight zone, and now I find it is to be cut. Why? The story lines are realistic, the acting is estimable and the production values are high, making it streets ahead of most soaps present and past. There is a strong character development and a certain moral stance which is appealing in a rather valueless Britain. Such a good advert for GB on the World Service, and a very entertaining part of BBC 7 for those of us here.\n\nHow will I manage without Margaret, Jamshed, Sunita et al - and how does Ben cope with being gay? Will I ever find out? It's as if Trollope ended the Pallisers half-way through.\n\nPlease reconsider. The scene where the doctor of Nigerian origin was held up at customs had me in knots of anger and sympathy recently, even if she is full of herself. Eastenders can learn a lot from this hidden nugget.\n\nChris, London.\n\nDear wonderful Westway crew,\n\nI have been listening to Westway since I was quite young, and have loved the hearing the characters develop. I'm an avid radio listener and also enjoy The Archers, but I have always thought that Westway is a much more realistic and gripping drama. Westway has served as a comfort to me whilst studying early into the morning, and though I'm sure I can continue to enjoy the early episodes on BBC 7, I have to say how disappointed I am at the news that Westway is being terminated! I would really like to know why the decision has been taken to terminate this wonderful series, as it really will be something I shall miss dearly, as I'm sure many others will too.\n\nNicholas\n\nI never believe in never.\n\nSo can I add my name to the petition to keep Westway on the World Service.\n\nI have followed the show for all of the eight years both here in Singapore and under more difficult circumstances in Sydney Australia.\n\nNews and current affairs might make us switch on but Westway keeps us listening.\n\nCOME ON it is never too late to admit a mistake, keep them doctors on, they are good medicine in a world of only bad news!!\n\nAndrew, Singapore\n\nI'm a 47 year old South African teaching Vilnius, Lithuania. The BBC is a regular companion of mine, both in my classroom and in my car. Over the past few years I've 'tuned in' to Westway and really enjoy the programme. I'm a huge fan of Aunt Polin, Chidi and now Jamshed's Aunt who's just arrived to fetch Blaze(sp?) and take her back to India.\n\nIt always interests me that you manage to keep the issues in the story very topical (except perhaps for the up-coming UK elections). I can't believe theprogramme is coming to an end in October and I am VERY disappointed.\n\nJohn, Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nI am writing to ask you not to axe this show. I think it is absolutely wonderful and when I travel to Ghana, it gives me a pleasant link with England - especially as you do not have The Archers on the World Service. Please think again.\n\nAraba, Ghana\n\nI shall be sorry. No doubt this follows the principle ‘If it moves shoot it down’.\n\nIt has always been a pleasure when insomnia happened to coincide with an episode.\n\nAngela, UK\n\nI am a fan of Westway and try to listen to each episode when I can. A few years ago I use to listen to Westway on my AM Radio in my car while driving to work with a change of job it ended my routine. I am now back listening to Westway on BBC7 and BBC World Service on digital radio which is crystal clear. I cannot believe the BBC is taking this programme off air in October. With this email service you have provided I am reading emails from fellow listeners all around the world from Malawi to Mongolia, from India to Iran, all complimenting the show. I don't know what is happening to TV and Radio in the UK. There are too many reality programmes, dumbing down, too much sex and violence and any opportunity to swear. Am I the only person who thinks like this? I think it great that there are other fellow listeners around the world who love Westway. Don't get rid of something that is good.\n\nGiovanni (London)\n\nI actually live in the UK, (semi-insomniac) but have been addicted to Westway for about 4 years, I really cannot believe you are about to pull it in October. I know you have been altering the type of programmes you put out on the World Service, but I am devastated to learn that you propose to axe Westway. Why? WHY? WHY? I have a choice of dozens of radio programmes, but the World Service keeps me in touch with everything that's happening in other countries, surely there's room for Westway, or have you just run out of storylines? Please think again. I once lived in Kenya for a while, in the 70s and know how important the W.S. is to ex-patriots.\n\nNatalie, UK\n\nHello whoever writes Westway storylines,\n\nI think some characters are not credible, especially Blaze. she is unbelievably simple-minded and naive. Too much so. Even if we're talking fiction, it helps if the characters approximate real life.\n\nBlaze has also just landed from Mumbay and fit in culturally and socially into London without missing a beat. Apart from her accent, she is virtually british.\n\nSusan\n\nI really enjoy westway and its funny characters and their machingly controversial lives and\n\nthey way they go about their business i am a togolese student of computer software programming and enjoy listening to bbc in hole and westway in particular so I am very much seduced by the life of Fr Gillespie and Roy Wallis and the rogue in making Fizza so i hope you will never end this westway I can contribute more serious situations to make the story last again all the best the most powerful of the lama kingdom\n\nCharles, Nigeria\n\nPlease don't cancel Westway. I listen regularly, both in the UK and overseas and enjoy the stories very much. We deliberately live in a diverse and multicutural part of London, and I spent many years flying longhaul for BA. This programme reflects a lot of the new Britain and I guess is enjoyed worldwide. I heard about this on last nights \"Write On\".\n\nJohn, UK\n\nI just read the announcement at the top of the Westway page about the pending conclusion of the Westway series in October. This is the end of a cycle and perhaps a wakeup call for me.\n\nYou see, my mother died the same year, 1997, that Westway began. I'd be very low, depressed, and sleepless with the radio on, KCSN,in Los Angeles, listening to BBC World Service all night. I was not aware of the unusual broadcast schedule you had for it then, but in the middle of it all, on only some night, would come this happy theme and then 15 minutes of the triumphs and travails of the diverse staff and neighbors of the clinic. It became a second home for me. I care much for everyone, though more about folks like Father Gillespie (I am a teacher and the horror of the sexual abuse accusation is one we face often here), Chidi (whom I originally did not like, until he settled down to be more responsible (relatively)), and Margaret, who is just such a vulnerable leader and highly skilled professional with her heart in mostly the right place.\n\nI will miss the series and want to thank all the performers, writers, directors, BBC staff, and, especially, the technicians (who else could make me \"see\" and \"feel\" London from a studio?). Life is just like that. You wonder what the hell this cacaphony of stories is, grow to love it, and, then, it is over. Thanks for the heads up. I will listen each weekend with more appreciation to see how you all bring Westway to a worthy end. I still think the way they ended \"Northern Exposure\", a culty series from the 90s, on CBS, was fitting. Everyone just on another night, a bit closer than on others, but nothing schmaltzy like them trying to present it as the folks had all risen above their problems and life was happy-ever-after; just Kate Rusby singing Iris Dement's \"Our Town\" and that was it.\n\nGood luck to you all. Thanks for the web page, the pix of the players, the updates, and even getting back to my few e-mails. Let me know if there will ever be another series coming. If not, I still have the live stream news, documentaries, novels, and Prime Minister's Questions. There will always be an England.....even in Sunland (my district of Los Angeles).\n\nVictor,United States of America\n\nI gather that Westway is to close, because World Service is focusing on “serious” and “fact-based” programmes. Please don’t.\n\nI have had periods when World Service was my only access to English language media, and I would listen through the interference in the middle of the night, just to hear something that was not Analysis or the price of wheat in Chicago. It will be a great loss if it goes and is not replaced by a similar programme.\n\nPeter, UK\n\nWhy are you axing this programme? Or, why are you allowing it to be axed?\n\nAnd don't give me any **** about why yet another 24 hour rolling news service is going to prove so valuable. This isn't CNN, it isn't Channel 5 - it's the BBC World Service.\n\nYou don't demonstrate the BBC's (and by extension, Britain's) commitment to a genuinely multicultural society by axing the one BBC artefact in which that ideal is so obviously manifest. I appreciate that it's harder to strike over ideals than it is over job cuts, but surely there must be some leverage that you have?\n\nCan you not construct a business case that shows the cost benefits of retaining the programme - the alleged managers of our institutions like that sort of thing these days, and they're not that difficult to construct.\n\nToby, UK\n\nPlease don't take away my Westway! Just found it again after many years of not being able to listen - it's a great drama, and relates to all ages and cultures - please keep this drama available to listeners in the US - we have no great radio dramas to call our own, and have come to rely on BBC World Service for a culturally conscious modern day drama.\n\nTheresa\n\nAre we really going to be deprived of Westway? On Write On, I heard about this dismaying decision for the first time. As a most loyal listener since the very first episode, I am not happy about it at all, but not shocked I must say. Programs are being killed off with alarming frequency, the latest being \"What's the Problem?\", so I have been waiting for Westway to meet the same fate, and hoping it would not. It is an excellent drama serial, featuring true to life situations, wonderful actors and delightful touches of humour.\n\nIs the BBC about to become a radio version of CNN or Sky News? We are hearing that BBC listeners want news and information. What does this mean? No more entertainment? All the literary and music programs banished to outer darkness? If it comes to that \"Westway\" does contain information. The HIV episodes certainly contained many facts. To divert for a second, \"What's the Problem\" was very informative. It all depends on the way you look at it, and the BBC is looking at the definition of information in a most narrow fashion.\n\nI do hope that you will change your mind and not remove Westway. It would be a great loss. If you do, plse announce the date of the last episode well in advance so I can hear it, which I will with a heavy heart.\n\nR. Cummin, Israel\n\nI’m an English teacher living in Spain. I think that Westway serves the same function on World Service radio as “Eastenders” does on TV in the UK. The issues addressed are all relevant to life not only in Britain but in most of the rest of the world. It certainly is “light” listening but it serves its purpose precisely for that reason. When I heard that it is to be discontinued on “Write On” the other week I was rather disappointed as I am sure many other regular listeners will be. The gentleman from the BBC who explained the reason for this was unclear in his explanation and particularly pompous in his attitude. Is the World Service only to be aimed at intellectuals or are we to accept that its audience is worldwide regardless of age, culture and Heaven Forbid, education?\n\nIf enough of us wrote into the BBC would we have any effect on this decision?\n\nBy the way, the new Louise sounds too like Gabriela to avoid confusion and how is it that Charlie and Louise can get married in the Catholic Church if they are both divorced?\n\nCongratulations on the programme!\n\nSue, Barcelona, Spain\n\nFor many years I have enjoyed listening to Westway. The dialogue and character development is excellent. Now a rumor has reached me that the Westway production may get cancelled. Please don't let that happen! Otherwise, how will we learn how all those peoples' lives turn out? After you have spent years drawing us into their stories, you must not abandon us (and them) now.\n\nJames, USA\n\nI had the misfortune of being unable to sleep one night and tuned in to Radio 4 - which, by this time, had become the Overseas Service. Mistake number one!. How I wish I had remained tuned to Classic FM! What was being broadcast? 'Westway'! I could hardly believe the BBC could broadcast such utter drivel! \"This must be a one-off\", I thought but, on checking the 'Radio Times', I discovered, to my surprise, that it was no such thing but what can only be described as an 'everyday story of social misfits'.\n\nNot one to make rapid judgements, I decided to listen to the next few episodes. Mistake numbers two, three, four and five - I really should have remained tuned to Classic FM. I have done since....\n\nHow 'Westway' can be described as drama, I have no idea! The characters are, without exception, socially inadequate, socially maladjusted, inarticulate, unable to speak grammatically-correct English and devoid of even the basic social graces; they seem to spend the entire episodes whingeing, drinking, fighting or arguing and it seems that they are either adulterers, gays, lesbians or HIV positives (not that I discriminate against gays, lesbians or HIV positives) The medical staff can hardly be described as professional; if the doctors and staff in my local practice behaved like the 'Westway' lot, the place would be closed down as a health hazard. The story-line is complete rubbish and, frankly, the BBC should be ashamed of broadcasting such nonsense. I only hope that our overseas listeners do not think this as typical of present-day England.\n\nAnd why, oh why, is it that there is no Anglican clergyman in the neighbourhood? Or a Baptist, or Methodist Minister? Are all the doctors, the staff, the patients and the entire local population of Roman Catholic persuasion? If your scriptwriters think that, then they really do need a lesson in the social structure of this country. It's surprising, too, that in these days of multi-culture, multi-race, multi-faith and multi-anything-else-that-comes-to-mind, there's no mention of the local mosque, synagogue, temple, Masonic lodge or even witches’ coven!\n\nThank Goodness we no longer have to pay to receive radio broadcasts and I hope that none of my TV licence money finds its way into the bank accounts of the scriptwriters of 'Westway'. No, they aren't paid! Surely not!\n\nThe sooner this programme is removed from the broadcast schedule and replaced with something with even a hint of culture the better for everyone.\n\nP.S. I'm delighted to hear that 'Westway' is to be discontinued. This calls for a national celebration - even a Public Holiday\n\nJohn Bustin, UK\n\nI can hardly believe Westway will be leaving the airwaves by the end of October. It indeed will be missed.\n\nHas it been eight years now? Wow. I remember the very beginning, the very first program, and how awestruck I was by the sheer excellence it radiated. What the BBC manages to do through the radio medium is perfection. Not just a group of actors who sound like they are reading from a script as they stand before a microphone. NO WAY! The BBC's radio programs come across as being REAL, and so true to life.\n\nThe airwaves will be a bit empty when Westway signs off for the final time. What a treasure it has been!\n\nGwenne (USA)\n\nPlease don't take Westway off the air, I just love the program and all the characters. Living in America I get very homesick for London, so spending 30 minutes a week with the westway cast makes me feel at home and part of England for a while.\n\nPlease, Please don't take Westway off the air, it will be sadly missed!\n\nMarta, USA\n\nI'm an 18 and I live in Lusaka in Zambia just want to say that i absolutely love the show!!!! i try to never miss and episode but with me working its a bit hard, but the shows i have been able to catch up on are really great!!!!!! my favorite characters are Gabriella, Namita, Fizza, Kelly, Becky and Ned. I totally love their accents!!!!! They are just simply wild!!!\n\nMax, Zambia\n\nI was going to complain about Abi Eniola leaving Westway, but after logging on to the BBC, I now find out something even worse. That you want to take Westway off altogether.\n\nDON'T DO IT.\n\nI listen to Westway every week. I'm a British ex pat living here in Benghazi Libya for the last 27 years. I’ve no TV. I only listen to the BBC. & go to the net once or twice a month if I can. Westway is the only regular programme that I keep up with. PLEASE don't stop Westway. You, the BBC keep taking off programmes with out asking your listeners opinions first... it’s just too much. I will be one very angry EX BBC listener if you take Westway off the world service radio.\n\nNadine, Libya\n\nI really enjoyed the last episode of the show given that it was the first time I had actually\n\nsat through the whole half hour duration that it lasts. The suspence on whether Joy would make it to Nigeria was gripping.What a palaver! I am now a solid fan .\n\nWilliam Oyange, Kenya\n\nI read in the Independent of 1 April 2005 that Westway will be axed in October. Was this an April fool joke? I hope so. Please don't axe Westway.\n\nElisabeth\n\nAfter 4 days I am still annoyed and disgusted at the decision to scrap Westway from the World Service schedules in October. As an insomniac I manage to keep up with its twice-weekly schedule far more often then other radio and TV soaps. But Westway isn’t any old ordinary soap and although work don’t know it, my bleary eyed look at least twice a week is down to looking forward to hearing that inordinately cheerful theme tune at 2.30 am!\n\nUnlike other soaps that live in their own little implausible bubbles, Westway reflects a real UK, not only to insomniac Brits but also to the rest of the world. Its setting in the original global village of London allows it to examine tough and real world issues and their effects on peoples lives. A perfect foil to the almost exclusively news and current affairs based overnight schedule of the World Service.\n\nAs a self-confessed news junkie, I am not bemoaning the World Service’s news output. It is in fact by far the best-informed and balanced news service of all the media in the UK, reporting on many issues such as the crisis in Darfur months before all the other media. Surely half an hour a week can be left in the World Services schedule (and some funds in the budget) for this excellent drama led reflection on the world news. I hope this does not signify a degeneration of the overnight World Service schedule into a 24-hour news service of repeating bland news bites.\n\nsarah drea\n\nPlease tell me that your April 1, 2005 report stating that Westway is going off the air in October was just a very bad April Fool's Joke! I started listening to the programme about a month after it began, and it's the highpoint of my week. American tv shows aren't that interesting, and it will be a great loss to lose such a fine BBC drama. I enjoyed the multiculturalism --you even had an Albanian character! (My grandparents emigrated to the US from Albania), and the atmosphere at the Westway Health Center was portrayed in a realistic manner. I also like the fact that if I don't have a chance to catch an episode on my shortwave radio, I can hear it repeated from your website. (That was extremely helpful when the Boston Red Sox were in the Playoffs and World Series--I didn't have to miss any of the championship games .) I hope that the BBC Directors will reconsider, and keep Westway on the air. Is there a petition we can sign to show our support of you! r show? Keep up the good work!\n\nBarbara, USA\n\nI've just read in the Financial Times that Westway is ending. Is this true?\n\nIf so are there any plans to substitute it with something similar?\n\nIt may not be the high spot of World Service output but I do find it compulsive listening, as it seems do a lot of people all round the world!\n\nElizabeth Lindsay, uk\n\nDid I in my half awake state hear on BBC7 that you are axing Westway????????\n\nIf so why??????? It is enjoyed all over the world and is very important to so many people in remote areas.\n\nWrong decision I think!\n\nKirsten\n\nThough based in the UK I've been listening to Westway on the World Service for years, and now again on BBC7. I was very disappointed to hear that Westway is to be axed from October. This serial is unique it its portrayal of London's diverse community. As well as being entertaining it deals with difficult issues in a sensitive way. Feedback from around the world shows that this aspect of the programme is very welcome. The programme will leave a gap which nothing else will fill. It seems a pity that 30 mins per week could not be found to retain this series.\n\nErnest Dobson\n\nI was going through several websites and came across an item that says Westway was being axed by the World Service.\n\nPlease say this isn't true! I would be willing to subscribe to Westway for a monthly fee. Anything to keep this wonderful show alive. If it is leaving the World Service is there another BBC outlet for new shows?\n\nI love Westway and hope to keep it around for many a day!\n\nJohn, Ohio, USA\n\nI'm extremely upset and disappointed to hear that the show is being cancelled. It makes little sense, since surely, with the BBC7 airing the older episodes, Westway is steadily gaining new fans. Why couldn't the number of broadcast times simply be cut down, or the weekend omnibus discontinued? Is there any chance the show could be picked up by another station?\n\nThis is such sad news. I've listened for six years; the characters are such a part of my week that it's like visiting with dear friends, and I look forward to hearing them, particularly Margaret. It will be a great loss not to have Westway any longer.\n\nChristina, USA\n\nI have heard the distressing news on Write on that Westway will be coming to an end in October. It will be missed. I will be one of the mourners as I started listening from it's first episode about 6-7 years ago. As the show reaches it's end. I thank you very much for your help and I thank each and every actor/actress as well as the staff and the cast of Westway for their great dedication to the show. Thank you!\n\nJoe Chamma\n\nI'm so sad, because I've just heard that Westway is going to end in October. I've been a Westway addict for about five years, although at the beginning I couldn't listen to each\n\nepisode. It's really good to be able to listen to the first episodes on BBC7. I like almost all the characters, and I've learned so much English from them!!! I'm an interpreting\n\nstudent, and I'll graduate at the end of this year. At the beginning of my university studies I learned so much English from the Westway characters.\n\nAs I'm also blind, I would like to make a short remark about Zoe. I've read the message from another listener who thanked you for making Zoe such a natural person. I would like to\n\nthank you for that, too!!! Although I don't like Zoe very much as a character, I'm glad that she is portrait as a normal person with her abilities and mistakes, who just happens to be blind.\n\nCan we, the listeners, do anything to safe our favorite Worldservice program from disappearing? I've already sent a message to Writeon.\n\nBefore I go, I would like to thank everyone who has ever contributed to Westway for giving me such an extraordinary program and for teaching me so much English!!!!!\n\nAnja, Leipzig, Germany\n\nI an a long standing listener to Westway and have just read on the net that the BBC is axing Westway . I am so sorry as I really enjoy it and find the BBC’s excuse to end it pretty feeble to say the least. I do hope there is a big outcry and it is reprieved. It gives such a good insight to our British way of life and the way we have so many and varied cultures in our society. I have laughed and cried with the various characters through the years. I will miss it. Kindest regards\n\nDi. Nokes , UK\n\nI am shocked and disgusted by the news of westway being axed as it is such a well written and acted soap. So come on bbc don’t axe westway.\n\nCalvin, uk\n\nBBC7 say you're being axed in October. I'm really, really sorry - I love the show and will really miss it; it's not even as it's being replaced with another serial, from what I gather. The weekday schedules are to be No Fun zones. Well, thanks for seven years of really entertaining and informative listening. All the best - it's been brill.\n\nChris\n\nI can't begin to tell you how upset and angry I am to hear that 'Westway' is to finish. I have listened to it right from the start, first of all on a crackly, coming and going long wave frequency and recently on digital radio (I live in England). I have also been listening to the BBC7 repeats. I cannot understand why the BBC is taking this excellent programme off. I hardly feel it's worth continuing to listen from now on, as I will only miss the characters more when it does finish. How can you do it?\n\nSurely an April's Fool joke? If not, then I protest at the axing of Westway. It is maturing nicely and it is unthinkable that it should stop now. Louise has to have another baby (you'll need to bring back the midwife, please), and Jamshed's cousin must overcome her \"agent\" and become a star! Well, maybe not. But please DON'T STOP.\n\nJytte\n\nPLEASE tell me that yesterday's article was just a very terrible April Fool's Joke, and not the truth. I just read that you plan to discontinue Westway in October! Is this part of the recent budget cuts? What can we do to save the programme? Your radio serial is so much better than most of the shows on American television, and I look forward to listening to it every Wednesday and Friday. I love the cultural diversity--you even had an Albanian character! (My family is from Albania.) And Westway's portrayal of its office is a much more realistic portrayal than all those Hollywood-type shows. Please reconsider and Save Westway!\n\nBarbara, Boston, , USA\n\nI have just heard through a Westway discussion group on the net, that the BBC is ending the series this fall. What are you people thinking?!\n\nEthel, Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nDear BBC\n\nI am 40 years old and a mother to two boys 5 and 3 and I work part-time as a lecturer and I am also doing a PhD. I wanted to write and tell you how much I enjoy Westway. However I am often frustrated. I occasionally catch the current shows on the world service but this is too infrequent and I cannot keep up with the storylines. So I have 'started again' on BBC7. I much preferred the show when it was on as an omnibus on Sundays. Now it is on Saturdays, which is always a much busier day I sometimes miss the show and don't have a chance to catch up. As both omnibus editions are on one day, like last week where I went out for the day I missed all the shows. If you had one on Saturday mornings then the second on Sunday evenings I would have much more chance of listening to one or the other.\n\nI love the story lines and the one about Margaret and Lloyd was so moving. Keep up the good work.\n\nJo Hart\n\nTo Westway cast,\n\nI enjoy listening to Westway twice a week. I think all the actors do a terrific job in bringing to life their characters. Please do keep it up!\n\nRomana\n\nGreetings to all members of the cast. It's evermore refreshing listening to you even after 7 years. Thank you Mr. Producer for this very good drama serial. I hope it continues forever.\n\nERIC EKOW ABAIDOO, ACCRA,GHANA.\n\nSorry but I just can't warm to Westway. At first I hated it, heard the first few epis then didn't listen for a long time, then, about a year later, it coincided with a car journey to work and I listened in preference to silence - but often I preferred the silence.\n\nIt's corny, over-acted, laughingly inaccurate sometimes - and full of unpleasant or unendearing characters. Many of whom, for whatever reason, undergo total personality changes (this is always the mark of a very poor soap)\n\nNot since Chidi has there been anyone to really make friends with. I'm not a regular listener, only when I drive but I've never yet heard anything which might tempt me to listen on line or (heaven help us) re-listen to ancient episodes. So it never quite made it for me and I don't listen if I can help it.\n\nLynda\n\nI am a regular listener to the BBC, am 26 years old and I come from Nigeria, I’ve been listening to the BBC from the age of 12,my favourite programme which introduced to the BBC is Network Africa. I have recently become addicted to WESTWAY.\n\nCHINEDU, NIGERIA.\n\nI just love the program. I found it when, as a Study Abroud student in London last year I would listen to Radio 4 in the evening and was often still awake when it switched over to World Service, and I am so glad that I was!\n\nNow back in New York City I still keep up via online broadcasts to Westway!\n\nJulie, New York\n\nYes, I am truly addicted. The storylines are great and the actors are superb. I would love it if you would update your Who's Who page. I'd love to see Billie (she's such a downer!) and Blaze, my absolute favorite new character. Thanks for a great series!\n\nShirley, USA\n\nCongratulations to your script-writers for the recent episodes. Having some of the same experience as Louise, I found the account of her baptism most moving....and what a joy to hear the lively and informative account of Dr Margaret's return to life and hope, after the encounter with the ignorant First-Aider.\n\nAnna Mary, North Norway.\n\nAfter hearing that Just A Minute has been cancelled on World Service and now Westway, I am APPALLED.\n\nWorld Service is NOT just for news and factual programming.\n\nIt should encompass and indeed be a main source of news, but COMEDY and DRAMA are essential too!\n\nPlease forward this to the Controller of BBC World Service.\n\nRex Orr, England.\n\nI proud to say this, yes last 13 months Westway is the part of my life, nowadys I cant think servive without bbc.\n\nNow I knew a bit about of world, for that I need to pay my thanks to everyone in bbc.\n\nI would like to say more but my poor english dont co-operate to do that, any way wishes to all to do more for everyone in world.\n\nR S Kumar, Singapore\n\nDear Westway Writers:\n\nBoy am I happy that spineless boring Jamshed is having a rough time between egocentric Blaze and bossy \"Gabs\"!\n\nSusanna, Dominican Republic\n\nI am only a comparatively new listener to Westway, having stumbled upon it quite by accident with the repeats from the very beginning on BBC7. So I am way behind with what is currently going on and am stuck way back in the days of the Eclipse and Lloyd's terminal illness.\n\nHowever, I should just like to say that my husband and I listen to it every week and we think it is absolutely brilliant: the characters, the storylines, even the sound effects. I would like to start listening to the current episodes but as it is on during the night, I haven't got around to using the listen again facility on the net yet.\n\nBut I think it is absolutely fantastic! Even my 2 sons of 12 and 7 sometimes listen to the omnibus with us at the weekends.\n\nI think all the characters are believable and the programme deals sensitively with many issues.\n\nMy all time favourite character so far has to be Chidi! He is still only young in the repeats from 1999 but he cracks me up every time I hear him, I tell you! My kids love him too!\n\nMel, UK\n\nI am glad that at least one character at the ‘Westway’ clinic, ‘Margaret’ seems to have her heart in the right place, unlike most people in the real world today.\n\nRonnie Almeida, Karnataka, India\n\nAs an early riser and occasional insomniac, I pick up Westways occasionally. As a Catholic priest might I say I was struck by the very accurate presentation of the dilemma facing a character who wished to enter the Catholic Church in time for Easter. Congrats to the producer on getting all the details so accurately in the steps of the atechumenate programme - not easy even for many clergy, so it is a special tonic to get it done so well and accurately on radio - and also for the humane presentation of Fr. Gillespie. I have told some of my colleagues about your programme.\n\nHi, It is very nice to listen a pappy kind of voice of Aunt, the Aqua ballyhooed actress. Well done with the character of Anu.\n\nGaurav, Nepal\n\nMy husband and I stumbled onto this while looking for something different to listen to on our XM radio. The show is interesting, has all the elements of suspense, drama and a good story line, and makes you want to tune in for more. Definitely worth listening to.\n\nShirlene, Maryland U.S.A\n\nHi\n\nI have been listening to Westway I think from the very first edition and only miss it when I am not at home. I have found it to be very interesting and now with the arrival of Blaze what else can I say. I think it is really a very good programme.\n\nGascoynia,Sierra Leone\n\nDear all at westway,\n\nPlease send me a post card of the cast. I never miss\n\nan episode, I think I may have a crush on Jamsheet.\n\nThanks.\n\nBertha, Zambia\n\nIs the WestWay theme tune available as a ring-tone (polyphonic for a Nokia 6610)?\n\nI'd like it because it would be something of an individualistic choice and because it would produce smiles of recognition from other insomniacs who listen to the World Service in the middle of the night.\n\nJulian, London, UK\n\nYes, I am truly addicted. The storylines are great and the actors are superb. I would love it if you would update your Who's Who page. I'd love to see Billie (she's such a downer!) and Blaze, my\n\nabsolute favorite new character. Thanks for a great series!\n\nShirley, USA\n\nCongratulations to your script-writers for the recent episodes. Having some of the same experience as Louise, I found the account of her baptism most moving....and what a joy to hear the lively and informative account of Dr Margaret's return to life and hope, after the encounter with the ignorant First-Aider.\n\nAnna Mary, North Norway\n\nDear Westway,\n\nI just love the program. I found it when, as a Study Abroud student in London last year I would listen to Radio 4 in the evening and was often still awake when it switched over to World Service, and I am so glad that I was! Now back in New York City I still keep up via online broadcasts to Westway!\n\nJulie, New York, USA\n\nHi there. We listen religiously via SW\n\nout here in the bush in Zambia (we're American\n\ndevelopment workers who can't stand a second of\n\nVOA but get a lot of enjoyment from BBC, and\n\nespecially Westway).\n\nP.S. Blaze is a truly terrible creature you've created! (So please give Ms. Punjabi a much\n\nBIGGER part in the future! We can't get enough.)\n\nDavid, Zambia\n\nHello,\n\nGreetings to all members of the cast. It's evermore refreshing listening to you even after 7 years. Thank you Mr. Producer for this very good drama serial. I hope it continues forever.\n\nEric, ACCRA,GHANA.\n\nhello west way, thanks a lot for all the dreams you have kept\n\nCharles, Kano State, Nigeria\n\nHere is my annual plea to update the pages for Westway. I think Westgrove Park needs some touching up: Chidi's Chop Shop, any of the newer characters' residences (Sean, Zoe, anyone living in the vicitity). Also, new characters need to be added to the who's who page: Angus, Joy's Uncle and Aunt, etc. Perhaps the cast members do not want their pictures shown. Well, the character's background brief will suffice.\n\nThanks for all you have done. I really cannot expect more from you since your main work is radio, not the Internet. I have to imagine all this and the map has helped a bit. My two days in London on a trip 12 years ago are all I have for a reference. Well, thanks a lot.\n\nVictor, California, United States of America\n\nI have heard a rumour that there are plans to end Westway on the World Service - please tell me this isn't true!! Many thanks!\n\nRhys\n\nIf you heard a sharp intake of breath this afternoon (Wed, Feb 2nd), it was me. I wouldn't miss \"Westway\" for the world and love the fact that I can listen on the Internet because my little shortwave used always throw a wobbly just as I wanted to tune in to the show.\n\nBut today, Kwame (sp?) comes out with this \"It's the Irish in her\" when he talks about the God-awful ornament he had bought for his mother - and yes, you've guessed it, I'm Irish and I listen in Germany. \"The Irish in her......!!!!\" I am not amused.\n\nJamshed's cousin is making me grind my teeth - is she supposed to be real ??\n\nWhen are you going to update the \"Who's Who\" section ??\n\nLove the show and don't worry, I'll keep on listening - but no more of this \"Irish in her\" business....pleeeeeeeeze.\n\nRegards,\n\nGrainne Meyer\n\nHi ,\n\nI thought it was just wonderful that the BBC was\n\nsensitive enough to include a little excerpt on the\n\nChinese Lunar New Year celebrations , on the programme.\n\nI just hope that this will cary on into the other\n\ncultures that are part of the UK , namely the\n\nNorth,South ,East & West Africans,Indians...etc .\n\ntah !\n\nJosh Jones\n\nDear BBC,\n\nI enjoy most of your programmes, the best for me being The Westway. It warms up my heart soo much.\n\nSarah, Uganda\n\nI feel it would be appropriate for the Westway theme tune to be changed to a song by 'The Clash,' as they are a band that somehow symbolise West Central London. They have had many connections with the area around the real Westway (the A40), and a song such as 'Complete Control' (where the Westway is mentioned) or 'Career Opportunities' (where doctor's prescriptions are mentioned) would suit the programme's setting well.\n\nA. Howlett.\n\nreets Mr. and Mrs. Westway (writers, directors, actors, everyone),\n\nThe latest installations of Westway have been truly great. Some of the best drama happening today.\n\nBlaze is a thoroughly welcomed addition! Please, please, please keep her around. I've always liked Jamshed for the very realistic and humorous elements he adds. The interchange between Blaze, Jamshed, Gabs, and Dave is wicked. Laugh out loud material.\n\nThe character writing for Blaze is perfect - she's tauntingly transparent. We know her intentions are patently selfish but the delivery is so puppy innocent, transparent and simplistic that they're hard to resist.\n\nThe way she takes criticism, a potential for the realism of her character to break down, is so believable I have to remind myself, this is an actor not a real person.\n\nNext, I think Kwame - both character and actor have really bloomed. Please keep Kwame around as well. He embodies a subtle combination of blue-collar upbringing with a hint of his African heritage.\n\nUntil recently, I wasn't very fond of Kathlene (Kwame's mother), but this week's program revealed so much about both her character and her actor; in particular, when she tells Kwame \"Go ahead, you can go after him\" (Kofe). Also, her accent is very nice, where is it from?? Thats an Irish accent, right? Dublin?\n\nBut the bomb scene (of the past many months, IMO) was when Kofe was battling for influence over his son by degrading Kathlene. After he makes her breakdown by preying on her weaknesses, Kofe attempts to slow things down and Kwame speaks for the first time of the scene ...\n\nWithin the few words I was clapping my hands slowly as if to encourage, I dunno. But what a wonderful scene that was. I love the loyalty Kwame has for his mother, very very touching. Kofe took a lickin! Never come between a mother and son.\n\nThe closing words Kwame speaks to his father were triumphant and very very well delivered by Kwame's actor. I have recommended that scene to Pick of the World.\n\n- in all, the latest episodes of Westway have been fantastic. The realism is ... haunting. I don't remember such seamless work since the days of Sean and Patrick (which should have won awards to be sure -Patrick both in writing and acting was so well done it makes the listener wonder if the writers/actors hadn't been through the experience of having a druggie in the family).\n\nSo, 3 cheers for Westway. Your writers are as good as your actors - absolutely top notch. And of course we wouldn't be saying that if the whole thing were'nt produced to perfection as well (sound techs, producer, etc).\n\nWhere does Westway get its writers?? I've noticed a rather continual flow and change of the writers, nearly all excellent.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nEric\n\nThanks for this exquisite programme, it’s good and I love it. I need the stuff.\n\nChidi, Nigeria\n\nI haveen listening to weestway for about a decade. I wasn't enjoying it. probaly because of the cultural distance and surely because of the way you switch on the setting without warning. I have always loved the setting s where Chidi is. I started loving wetway when yoiu did that unqualifiable episodes on H.I.V in late 2003 please I'll appreciate you sending the chracters,probably some scriprs and all that there is to know.my address is .C/o prof Oladosu Institute of Education\n\nUniversity Of Ilorin Nigeria.\n\nDear Westway Staff,\n\nI hope that the New Year is currently bringing you the good news you\n\ndeserve. Any plans to transform the radio drama into a theatre movie? I am asking this question because I have just seen half a British movie broadcast on a local TV station here in Lebanon. I have noticed at the end of the movie that there are some characters also part of the cast of Westway. The names that I’ve noticed are Nina Wadia, and Archie Punjabi. Other well-known British personalities are Juliet Stevenson, Gary Lineker, John Barnes and another well-known footballer. The movie was about…. Football!\n\nAs a daily listener to the BBC World Service and an avid listener to Westway, I was also wondering if you could send me a copy of the new Westway Post card.\n\nJoe, Lebanon\n\nI became a default listener to Westway at 2am on a Monday morning. Somehow I always seemed to wake up to that horrible, but catchy tune. Now I have digital radio and can listen at a civilised time.\n\nI love it and hate it.\n\nCould you send me a photo of the cast? I know that will probably destroy a few illusions but I have to know what they really look like!\n\nElizabeth, Falkirk.\n\nFor quite some time now I have been following your programme with keen interest. There is this character, Kwame who I am very much interested in seeing, because I am a Ghanaian myself.\n\nYaw Mireku, India\n\nHi. Will there be a westway book out soon in the UK?\n\nCalvin, UK\n\nHello Everyone at Westway, I think your show is excellent. Apart from the rather jarring signature tune, I think all the actors are excellent, with beautiful emotive voices. The storylines do tend to get clumsy and sort of repetitive… For instance the signature phone ringing call answer routine by Louise. But all in all, an excellent and educative show. You guys also dole out excellent health information. Keep up the good work! You may want to do an episode on lifestyle diseases (how to avoid them), pollution reduction and healthy relationships. Regards,\n\nZubin\n\nI just love Blaze, if only because she’s driving Gabriella CRAZY!!!!!\n\nGo girl go!\n\nMarion, Tel Aviv\n\ni love west , that is why i sleep it, and eat westway.\n\nChikopela\n\nHave been in USA since 2 Feb 2003, so I am glad I did not know Mel was on board a ship. Am going back to Ghana where I usually listen to Westway. Please bring Mel back.\n\nJoseph\n\nI love westway. Me thinks that when Margaret retires, Westway clinic will fall apart. I hope not.\n\nIvan, Poland\n\nHello Westway. I just wanted to let you know how great and funny I found the episodes this week, I forgot the name of the author, but I think it was a woman. Great job!\n\nMelanie, a fan!\n\nI live in Germany, and I can only get BBC on AM radio (630)...the reception is poor so I most often listen on line. Can you show pictures of the whole cast, like Faith, Kwame, Uncle Albert, Kofi, etc?\n\nChidi has grown since I first started listening...his speech patterns and mannerisms have changed (evolved?). Is the actor who operates the Chop Shop the same moocher who nearly killed Father Gillespie while learning to drive?\n\nGermany\n\nI've been listening to Westway since the late 1990s when, if memory serves, the drama began life as an English language education project? Anyway, I much prefer radio drama to the television where it is all too easy to let the pictures hide the fact that some of the scripts and acting are not of the highest standard. This problem simply doesn't exist on the radio and I much prefer to let my imagination enhance the drama.\n\nDavid, Essex UK\n\nEpisode Dated: 26th. January ‘05\n\nWell done! Script Writer and Director, for the wonderful tension created which I am sure is quite normal within such a clinic. Thanks.\n\nRonnie Almeida, Karnataka, India\n\nHi,\n\nWill you please send me a photocard of the westway cast- my favourite program.\n\nObadiah, Nairob,i Kenya.\n\nhi i think westway is so well writen and acted and is so real to life i also enjoy silver street and the archers to keep up the good work.\n\ncalvin (22) uk\n\nHi, I'm Jubril Saliu a regular follower and an ardent listener of the westway program, on the BBC.\n\nI'd like 2 commened d whole cast 4 their wonderful performances.\n\nMrs Ajiboye, Nigeria\n\nI sincerely congratulate the BBC for their hard work which reflects on the quality of their programmes.Of all the radio programmes, the most entertaining for me is west way,but I seldom have the ever desired opportunity to follow the stories as the come however conciouse I try not to miss out.\n\nI am useing this medium to humbly request for all CDs or cassettes for all the episodes of west way, starting from day one.\n\nBASSEY,MFONOBONG\n\nHi, I’ve just discovered Westway while hopping through the channels on my Freeview Box. I listened to my first episode tonight and I think I’m hooked already! I actually live on the real Westway in W12 and can’t wait to tell my friends and neighbours that we have our own soap with loyal fans from all over the world.\n\nChris (London, UK)\n\nI am a 14 year old Jamaican girl. I listen to Westway whenever I can catch it. My favourite personalities are Louise, Kwame and David. I especially liked the April’s Fools Day edition.\n\nChristina (Jamaica)\n\nI am so much enjoying Westway…it’s made listening to BBC 7 totally compulsive!! FORGET THE T.V.!!!! I AM ADDICTED!!! It’s just as radio should be!! Well done!!\n\nSteve (Herts, UK)\n\nListening to Westway for almost 5 years is amazing. The first I listened to when Steve was around, Kelly’s stepfather put behind bars. I wish you guys would continue to have competitions. Quizzes of old characters, also compositions.\n\nThis drama really has everyday events – holidays, homosexuals, deaths in families, court cases, AIDS, having HIV+ people in work places, celebrations etc. May Westway continue for many, many years to come. I love you all!\n\nSaliya Munyama (Zambia)\n\nI am a keen listener to this programme Westway and I have been listening to this programme since from the beginning of it. I fancy the play about HIV aids. I hope the play is going on know will be for ever because it is so interesting.\n\nAchu (Ghana)\n\nGood Morning, Team of Westway; I would like to thank you for your programme. I am a Togolese but I listen to you as often as my timetable allows.\n\nBakele (Togo)\n\nAbsolutely love the show and follow it like the plague! my favourite characters are Dr Graham & Jamshed but I want u all to know that the show wouldn't be the same without all of u could I please have a postcard to match the faces with the names when I narrate the antics of the cast to my pals. I'll keep listening in, keep up the good work!!!! .....oh Jamshed and Sean I love u guys to bits!!!!!!\n\nAisha (Zambia)\n\nI just got to know about Westway recently, last night to be more specific. I really enjoyed the programme and I promise to be a complete fan of the programme, you just tell me the days and times for the programme and you've just gotten a great fan.\n\nJohn (Nigeria)\n\nI have just joined the bandwagon of the programme fanatics and no beating about the bush, it's superb. The issues being presented are down to earth and the characters, fantastic too. Keep it up, Westway!\n\nMaster Khomba (Malawai)\n\nThe manner in which the story in Westway is shaping up has had me glued to this programme. We, in India, hardly have programmes that give importance to the understanding of family ties and mutual trust . Keep up the good work\n\nPravin Poojary (India)\n\nGabriella has always been selfish and egotistial, but I am getting really tired of the constant \"Muffin\" thing. This may be a typical English term of endearment like \"honey\" or \"darling\" (both of which I find equally stupid) but how old are these people, 15?\n\nSusanna(Dominican Republic)\n\nI am absolutely hooked on Westway via the Radio 7 website! I love the listen again feature and download Westway and whatever else I fancy to listen to whilst I'm working on the computer. I have always been a spoken word addict rather than music and Westway is amazing. I am not hooked on any TV soap (the only programme I can't miss is Casualty - and I missed Saturday's episode as the video didn't work!)\n\nMandy\n\nBBC is the GREATEST EVER, Westway is VERY VERY creative & Captivating. I love it. And of course, you, are all fabulous. Am writing from Uganda. Jeff>\n\nI have been an avid fan of this program for over a year, and only wish I'd discovered it sooner! Many aspects of the storyline address very realistic elements of day-to-day life in an impressive manner; from Joy's HIV to the recently-made false allegations against Father Gillespie, it focuses on legitimate issues and situations, and this most recent angle which brings in Zoe Chan Li-fen is no different. A fantastic job well done for making Zoe a normal, typical, hard-working young professional who smokes and drinks and lives her life the way millions of blind people throughout the world do, without making her blindness a factor. Thank you, thank you for not making people go out of their way to act like care-takers, for making Claude a normal dog and not some sort of miracle-worker, and I guess for the overall illustration of the truth about blind people. Zoe can obviously listen to her environment and give her dog instructions based on\n\nwhat she hears, interact with her colleagues who simply take her blindness for granted, and function without the entire cast feeling the need to call special attention to the fact that her eyes are simply broken. Over here in the U.S., it seems like blind people still have some of their dignity sacrificed when portrayed by the media, and this sends such a strong, negative message to the public which is often untrue. I have never seen such an accurate representation of a blind character before, and I find it highly impressive! Thank you for not making Zoe and those around her who\n\ninteract with her clueless and uncomfortable; you can't know how much the unspoken actions help and what a significant impression a positive message can send to the general public. You have truly done a fantastic job!! Do archives exist anywhere of Westway since the program's inception, and is there any hope of increasing the number of episodes? Westway is wonderful, and so many of us are addicted to it. Keep up the good work!\n\nRaquel (California>\n\nHullo. I was so much impressed by the way the AIDS issue was brought up and how Joy and Chidi handled it.\n\nWestway is a reality show; I like the way Margaret and Father Gillespie's friendship is portrayed in real-life situations. People have always gone through that kind of experience where we bar friends to criticise our actions even when we are wrong.\n\nThe case of Kelly is intriguing, she has really portrayed her jealousy of other peoples' relationship with her son.instead of trying to improve her relationship with Liam, she has decided to chase them away. Wish you luck. I wish you would make it into a T.V drama.\n\nNinsiima (Uganda)\n\nHi! I just started listing to your programe and loved every minute of it. I liked that last one on Sunday with Zoe's dog. I laugh very hard!\n\nRicky (Antigua, West Indies)\n\nI listen to the World Service several hours a day, but have never been too keen on Westway. But suddenly, the Father Gillespie storyline and quality of acting has got me hooked! Well done!\n\nSean (Berlin)\n\nI have been listening to the program for 3 years and just love it. I like the international flavour and the current issues it touches on.\n\nTony Yuen (Singapore)\n\nI've always liked Westway because it had more to offer than the love affairs of a regular soap, but for the past months it's been sliding into Lala Land with the emphasis on love affairs.\n\nOh well, if that's the trend, why not at least a new sweetie for poor Denny? He's been left quite alone since Ned broke with him, and the chap deserves a break.\n\nWhat if he decided like many landlords do to have a Gay Night at the Green Man... perhaps he could hook up with someone?\n\nDorothy\n\nNow that Chidi has started his Nigerian restaurant, maybe you can post a couple of his menu recipes on your website. It's been very cold here in Boston, and my parents and I had some lima bean soup for supper, which was delicious, but then I listened to Westway, and Joy was preparing some \"Nigerian Pepper Soup\" which Chidi kept raving about! It sounded delicious, especially when Auntie Polin is ready to defy Albert, just because the soup smells so good! PLEASE!!! Can we have the recipe? It sounds like something I'd like to try at home some weekend.\n\nBarbara (Boston,USA)\n\nI am regular listener to your show. I really enjoy the program. I am so glad that Father Gillespie's name has been cleared, though the story shows how dangerous false allegations of that nature are.\n\nJohn (Harare)\n\nI'm an ardent listener of your program \"Westway\" and I must commend your organisation for airing such an educative program.Please keep up the good work.I would also like to recieve the westway photocard so that I can see what my favorite actors and actresses looklike.\n\nMoshood (Nigeria)\n\nHello! How nice to have a chance to tell you how much I love Westway. I just couldn't size it up at first. I can only report I'm pleasantly addicted. These people are interesting! I like them, or fret about them, or feel sad for them...and cheer for them! They are a lovely community! I live in remote Alaska and there are a total of four of us here...so Westway is an adopted community. I was in London a couple of years ago but it's such an immense city I cannot conjure up what this community might look like. No problem! That's the beauty of radio, my favorite medium...just listen and the whole place comes to life and sprouts vibrant and detailed in the mind's eye...profoundly engaging! I don't think there is much chance for anything to sprout watching television. ! I could easily get television via satellite as this is the only means by which I get the BBC in my remote location but I do not bother. The BBC is my constant and cherished companion. Thank you.\n\nChristine (Alaska)\n\nI would just like to say that I was touched by Joy's HIV issue and I found it especially gripping as it made me think about how I would cope with a partner if he were to be HIV+. Please keep up the good work.\n\nDavid(Ireland)\n\nI like listening to the drama. Remember the blind nurse and the sausage? Ha Ha!\n\nNicholas (Uganda)\n\nI am a man of 41 years of age and live in Iran. I am a regular listener of Westway. Thank you for such a nice play. To my knowledge, Westway has been on for some six years. I wonder how long more it will be on. Would you send the free colour photocard?\n\nShahram (Iran)\n\nWestway’s bold tackling of Joy’s HIV status so echoes the experiences of myself and other people with psychiatric health issues. Psychiatric illnesses are one of our societies taboos and aside from the real symptom of the illnesses, sufferers often then experience the fears, the prejudices and the distancing of their social groups…If Joy were a real person, I would send her a card of unstinting sympathy, empathy and friendship.\n\nFrancis(UK)\n\nI have been listening to Westway on and off for several years now and had found it pretty boring until lately. Before it ws more background noise, just a program that was on before the next program. Since the listeners,- and I believe it are listeners, who have written the story's text-, have gotten a hold of the program, I find myself actually looking foward to it and am disapointed when I miss it. The HIV / Joy storyline and her family problems with it, is good. I like the reaction of her uncle, seems more realistic than a pure supportive family reaction. The entire storyline (s) seemed to have gotten a breath of fresh air, regardless of the authors.\n\nJoyce(Germany)\n\nI have to tell you that I have been enjoying the recent turn of events for David Boyce. I am thrilled to see him get his comeuppance by the \"love 'em and leave 'em\" Lola. To imagine David sitting naked on her bed crying his eyes out was wonderful, wonderful! I have also been touched by Joy's storyline. She has gone through so much in coming to accept her HIV status and now we get to see how her family and larger community will come to terms with it as well. It's a positive message for all. Can't wait until Sean is back on the scene, but you will have to explain why Mel has rejected his advances. He seems like a great guy and she has even said so herself. So, please explain!! Is Janet ever going to come back to Westway? I would like to know that she is happy, but I miss her presence on the show. Perhaps, I am wrong to speculate on this, but does Father Gillespie have a crush on Margaret? I felt he was missing her a bit too much when Mike came on the scene.\n\nHelena(USA)\n\nNow that Chidi has started his Nigerian restaurant, maybe you can post a couple of his menu recipes on your website. I listened to Westway, and Joy was preparing some \"Nigerian Pepper Soup\" which Chidi kept raving about! It sounded delicious, especially when Auntie Pollen is ready to defy Albert, just because the soup smells so good! PLEASE!!! Can we have the recipe? It sounds like something I'd like to try at home some weekend.\n\nBarbara (USA)\n\nCongraulations on your brilliant and heart wrenching storylines when joy disclosed her HIV status to pauline and albert. By allowing her to be responsible for them knowing, and the manner with which she told them, said so much of your grasp and understaning of the fears and courage that HIV/AIDS sufferers across the world face when it comes to disclosing to loved ones. The lines were punchy, direct and done with such sensitivity. Thank you also for highliting some of the hysterical ignorance, fear and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS.\n\nThank you Westway for continue to tell these human stories in such realistic settings.\n\nRabiya (UK)\n\nJust wanted to say I love the story line about the Nigerian family opening a restaurant. I have Nigerian relatives, and your Albert sounds exactly like my uncle!\n\nEno (USA)\n\nI love westway's jingle so much that I sometime want to hear it even if it's not time to air the programme. My commitment to the programme has caused my father to love the programme, too. He never did know that a radio play could be so touchy. Just hope owners of radio stations here in Ghana would see the sense in radio dramas and minimize the airing of profane songs which is rather causing more harm\n\nthan good.\n\nRansford (Ghana)\n\nI listen out for your \"distinctive\" theme tune late at night as I go to bed and it's always a delight to be thrown into the first little scenelet. Now I've found you on the internet I can listen to episodes\n\nwhenever I like (for instance now, when I'm attempting to write an incredibly boring essay on Renaissance tragedy). Incidentally, it's lovely to read your \"Your View\" page, to see the wonderful differences in prose styles from English-speakers across the world: different\n\nturns of phrase, metaphoricity, register and so on. I hadn't really imagined that the same words could be put to so many uses.\n\nNick (UK)\n\nI have recently discovered Westway and I think it's great. I was a Londoner but moved to Austria to join my husband. I have always been an avid BBC radio listener but not of the World Service. Now you are all I have. I listen to to you all day every day until my reception decides to go. Westway is my new Eastenders - Iove it. After listening to the news all day Westway is a refreshing burst of 'real and valid entertainment'. The current story line really touches the bone. My parents come from Ghana and Nigeria and I can tell you,you have got the characters and the storyline so right and as for what happened with Louise the receptionist and that old man... well it had me in stitches. Long live Westway! Can you not consider giving us more?\n\nYasmin (Austria)\n\nI suppose JOY is WHITE and, evidently, British; that is, even in the casts and in the plays. And, by the same token, Edward is a BLACK MAN; and, perhaps, a Nigerian. The normal traditional taboo in the European countries is that such BLACK vrs WHITE antipodal cultural entities are NOT encouraged or allowed to flirt nor,, much less, MARRY! To wit, the whites or Europeans frown on it abominably. Please remember that even in drama and fiction it pays to be realistic. The same may be said of that CHIDI character and whatever racial balance he is supposed to be masquerading. Is he there just to portray the CUDENESS of the African, or this is also just to throw wool over the African listener's eyes. Please, remove these incongruities from the cast to make the drama more natural and sensible!\n\nCharlie\n\nI found Westway about one month ago, now my favourite programme.\n\nThere is one thing I would like to ask you for. Please, do the best for Joy to be better. Does not matter, it is only a play, not real life, but I think, there are many people listening all over the world and hoping for something what would help them. And when your scriptwriters would bring her to recovery, it would be the best solution to my mind. I even think that it could be very important first step and everyone in the world could follow it and does not matter the first step had only unreal basis in someone's fantasy, motivated with effort to help and protect some ill people.\n\nBarbara (Prague)\n\nI love Westway, it is my favourite drama on radio. It's interesting, it's funny, it's mysterious. I like all the characters...they make me smile.. I always enjoy the show, I am one of Westway's biggest fans in Jamaica. Keep up the good work.\n\nTanisha (Jamaica)\n\nI started listening to your program while still at university...that was some time ago and it still rocks...especially at a time I was looking for a job... u kept me busy and glad with all those episodes. Please make them longer?\n\nJames (Zambia)\n\nToday I had again to put up with that annoying show Westway. When do you finally terminate it and bring something reasonable...like weather news.\n\nHenry\n\nThanks for the interesting programme, though I think it was better some time ago!\n\nJ. McFarlane (Scotland)\n\nAkrim would like daily episodes but I think the amount is just right! Enough suspense, enough agony for one week! I very much enjoy Westway with its variety of topics and its eye on what is important in daily life at this time...for example, the predicament of an HIV-positive person: can Joy tell her family? ...good to have this fictional comment alongside the programmes being given us by the BBC as a run-up to AIDS day on 1st December. Ad Multos Annos, Westway!\n\nAnna Mary (Norway)\n\nDo please give us more weekly time of Westway! Just 30 minutes a week is too little for such an educative and exciting programme. At least 15 minute daily episodes should be planned for in the future if the BBC can afford to pay the script-writers.\n\nAkrim (Norway)\n\nI’m one of the newest listeners who just discovered how entertaining your play is. I started listening to your program about three months ago and I can tell you, I haven’t missed an episode and I always listen to the repeats too. Matthew(Kenya)\n\nI’m a listener of your radio station for many years appreciate the programmes of news and entertainment and the Westway is one of my favourites. I’m a solo-learner of English and hearing your programmes help a lot in all aspects of this long process of learning. It’s really rewarding to see how much I have done but there’s still a long way ahead to go through. Surely I’m not on my own because BBC it’s close at hand. I live on a farm and I turn to radio which is my unique means to knowing about what’s happening in the world. I like dramas, knowing about London, England, listening to music, all the education programmes the BBC really makes a difference in my life.\n\nJoao (Brazil)\n\nI am interested with the programme. Each time I listen to it, I learn one of two things. Special thanks goes to everyone who contributes to the programme.\n\nNgongang\n\nThought I'd tell you how I've listened to Westway over the years. It's my weekly treat and so I always make a routine of listening. When I lived in Hong Kong I used to cycle every Sunday morning from the Mid-levels along Bowen Road and over the hill down to Deep Water Bay. I'd have lunch at a nice little Thai restaurant (alas no longer there) while listening to the omnibus edition.\n\nNow I live in the States, where as you know there is no radio broadcast. So instead I now have a little WiFi-enabled laptop computer, which I take down to my local cafe, Murky Coffee, here on Capitol Hill, which has free wireless internet.\n\nWestway is still as good as ever and is my anchor in a fast-changing world!\n\nChris(USA)\n\nThe best thing on radio. I listen when working nights, never miss an episode, great stuff.\n\nIan (UK)\n\nThanks so much for all the hard work. Your show continues to outshine any other drama series. Keep up the good work and again thanks for being on XM Satellite radio, it made our road trip much better and the distances much shorter!\n\nDarryl (USA)\n\nI agree with another fan that, perhaps, the Sana/Gary story has begun to dominate the show; for a couple of weeks, I wondered where our regulars had gone! Nonetheless, the writers have done such an excellent job writing the character of Sana, and her reactions are very realistic for one who's grieving. Well done!\n\nWhat has become of Patrick? Remote as the possibility seems now, I had hoped to see a Patrick-Mantha pairing, or a friendship between those two troublemakers. It would make for some entertaining listening.\n\nI'm happy to see the Mike-Margaret relationship working, or at least, still intact, even if it is a challenge for Margaret. She's by far my favorite character on Westway, and it's lovely to see her happy. I really like Mike too, even with his tendency to be overbearing, but that's part of his charm. Hopefully we'll see more of him soon, and perhaps his daughters as well.?\n\nJoanie(USA)\n\nI love Westway and have been listening now for about a year. However I think the Becky/Sana/Gary storyline is becoming a bit of a drag and dominates too much of each episode. I do think they are all very good characters though. I find Janet's character very tiresome, especially her whining!\n\nChristine (N. Ireland)\n\nI do love to listen to the programme and indeed have done so since its inception. Spending 4-month spells on the oceans enables me to tune-in regularly, and I suppose I'm quite addicted now. Ever grateful for such enjoyable stories.\n\nDonald (Maldives)\n\nAs a regular World Service listener from Germany I recently realized that I became hooked by the Westway radio play and all its characters... I would like to use this chance to thank you for all the great BBC World radio and TV shows which followed me all over the world and (even though being German) made me feel home wherever I tuned in. Keep on making such a great program!\n\nRainer (Germany)\n\nI couldn't sleep because of the heatwave and Radio 4 turned into the World Service. I am a teaching assistant, so no work for 6 weeks. I'm now addicted to Westway but when school starts again I'll have to listen to it over the net.\n\nBarbara (UK)\n\n\"Always upbeat;\n\nNever Amiss\n\nThat's the Westway motto\n\nTune to the wonderful clinic set-up\n\nFull of crackling issues\n\nEverything sounds to attract;\n\njust by hearing the signature tune introducing the programme\n\nBroadcasted and rebroadcasted at good times;\n\njust for 5m and me\n\nIf you think Westway is just a waste of time;\n\nBetter be careful (BBC)\"\n\nMemory (Malawi)\n\nWay to go! It finally looks as if some fun is getting back into Jane's life! Thanks\n\nSusanna (Dominican Republic)\n\nDear BBC,\n\nyour show westway is highly boring and it suggs.\n\nI have never heard a worse play.\n\nBetter you take it out from you program.\n\nregards,\n\nRaghu\n\nI am a big fan of westway. I've been listening in to the program since 2000. Though at times i miss a couple of episodes i always manage to follow the events later. You guy's are truly great.\n\nI've always wondered what some of the characters of westway look like. Your webpage has some but there are those other intriguing ones like Gary Pengelly? Keep up the great stuff.\n\nBen (UK)\n\nTo the producers of westway without all your hardwork they would not be such talented actors/actoressess,a thumb's up all the way for U guys/gals too. I am stuck like a glue to your drama serial and cry if I SHOULD I Miss it... I guess I feel for this medical drama series because I am involved in the same line too... THANKS ALOT SINCERELY,\n\nChristina (Singapore)\n\nI listened to episodes of Westway for the first time this week and now I am utterly hooked. It's making me want to go to London!\n\nE. Jackson (USA)\n\nI'm an avid listener of our radio drama by the title Westway, and I can comment the acting is so good that you feel as if you are watching it.\n\nLinda(Zimbabwe)\n\nI have been a fan of the program for the last 4 years though nowadays it comes in some late hours for us listeners in East-Africa. I particularly like it for it shows people of different races interacting harmoniously(almost) without relying on the usual stereotypes.\n\nSamuel (Kenya)\n\nI'd like to make a complaint. Of course it is statistically proven that men get separated and start a new relationship right away. It is also proven that men have more extramarital affairs (resulting in children) than women but please, does Westway have to be a \"reality show\"?\n\nNow, that you finally managed to give Margaret some sort of life instead of having this one-sided \"Mother Theresa\" cardboard character, I'd like the same to be done for Janet.\n\nSince I started to listen to the show, Janet has not had too much fun: Jamshed having a baby with Namita while she wanted one and did not get one, then the separation and her mother's illness and death and now Jamshed with this Gabriella thing. Of course this is how real life is for most women and Jamshed is a very classical (unlikeable) male.\n\nCouldn't you write in some excitement into Janet's life instead of having one bad thing after an other happening to her? I'd really appreciate it, I have \"real life\" all week long and need some entertainment on the week-end.\n\nSusanna (DOMINICAN REPUBLIC)\n\nI'm just surfing in from the land of the unexpected (that's Papua New\n\nGuinea, in case you didn't know) and just wanted to say I enjoy your program plenty and always look forward to it every weekend. Oh and yes, I wouldn't mind one of your photocards if possible.\n\nJan (PAPUA NEW GUINEA)\n\nHi there! As a shortlisted contestant in the Westway competition, am I supposed to get a consolation prize, or were those only for the runner-ups? Well, whatever, it was great fun competing, and the series just gets better and better!\n\nEthel (ISRAEL)\n\nEd. Yes, Ethel, your consolation prize is being"
