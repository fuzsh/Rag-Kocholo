        "text": "Over the past couple of weeks, Game Developer Mamoru Kano has been engaging in a fantastic promotional campaign for his upcoming folklore-inspired UE5 exploration game Otoshi no Shima, demonstrating outstanding aquatic monsters created for the game with short behind-the-scenes demos.\n\nContinuing to delight the ever-growing community of fans with his devlog, Mamoru has recently offered a look at the refined version of the previously demonstrated giant eel rig, demonstrating the creature moving in a line via Instanced Static Mesh, with its tail fin moving independently for enhanced realism. Additionally, the developer showcased a stunning scene of three eels creating a violent whirlpool by moving in circles in a mountainside lake, resulting in a wonderful yet eerie spectacle that I hope will appear in the final game.\n\nPreviously, Mamoru also impressed us with a stunning animation of an enormous snake slithering through a swamp and coiling around itself, as well as an eerie sequence of the same snake appearing from under the water. You can learn more about the game and check out the earlier demos by visiting the developer's Twitter page."
