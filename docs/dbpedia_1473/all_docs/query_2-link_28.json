        "text": "Rating: 70/100\n\nRemember my review of Pokemon Trading Card Game GBC? I mentioned at the end of it that it got a sequel game called Pokemon Trading Card Game 2: Here Comes Team Great Rocket that wasn't brought to the US because it had come out at the tail end of the GameBoy Color's life cycle. But fans of the game enjoyed it enough that some of them got together and made their own English fan translation of it so others could play it. I got to do just that, and yeah, as much as I enjoyed the first game, the sequel improves on it in pretty much every way, even if its still held back by the limitations of the hardware its on. Taking place immediately after the first game, a mysterious organization called Team Great Rocket, or Team GR for short, has not only kidnapped and imprisoned the club masters, but stolen everyone's cards, including ours. It's up to the player to fight Team GR, free their hostages, and get everyone's cards back.\n\nBy 2020s standards, this is admittedly a cliche and even laughable premise. You partake in card games against an \"evil\" organization who doesn't do anything all that evil except steal cards and kidnap people, and even then, they treat their hostages well and are decent people outside of that. Then again, the original Pokemon TCG game had even less of a plot, so if anything, TCG2's plot is not only more substantial and has more stakes, but also gives you more to do. I really cannot stress enough just how much content TCG2 has compared to the first game. It adds a bunch of new characters, a crap ton of new cards, allowing for more diverse strategies, a whole new continent and new areas to explore, changing facial expressions for all the characters' portrait sprites, and it even gives you the option to play as a female character rather than just the male character for once. Though admittedly, the game's nature as a direct sequel results in the characters talking to the female MC as if she's always existed in this universe, resulting in some blatant continuity errors should you decide to play as her, since she never existed in the first game. The male MC doesn't have this problem since he's been around since the first game.\n\nSeriously, skilled players can breeze through the first game in a little over two hours, maybe less. With all the new additions TCG2 has, one playthrough can go a little over ten hours, which is massive on GameBoy hardware, not to mention all the different strategies you can come up with and the different cards you can get from the in-game booster packs. But TCG2 doesn't stop there. The plot involves you going to GR Island and battling the residents there, and here's the catch: Most of them want you to adhere to special rules they set up if you want to duel them. They range from stuff like wanting your deck to only have energy cards of a certain type, having a certain number of a certain Pokemon in your deck like Eevee or Magikarp, or even banning you from using trainer cards at all. This actively forces you to come up with different strategies for dueling and use your head, so don't expect to just breeze through the game with just one deck. Thankfully, I never found coming up with new decks and strategies too difficult in TCG2, so the difficulty curve here compared to the first game isn't impossible.\n\nThat said, not every decision TCG2 makes has been good, though the majority of them were. One change in particular wasn't very well received with fans. Remember how every time you'd duel Imakuni and win, he'd give your four booster packs, which made for great card farming? TCG2 nerfed it so that whenever you win against Imakuni, he only gives you one booster pack instead, and there's nobody who you can duel to get four booster packs to compensate for this. Not only that, while Team GR's specifications for each member's duels do make for fun strategizing, if you don't have the cards required to battle them, get ready to do a lot of grinding. I personally didn't mind this, as I like doing that sort of thing, but I know others aren't as patient. One of the bosses, Bernard, has a rule where fire-types have no weaknesses, and there's no way to use this to your advantage. Plus, for as much as the game improves on the first game, by modern standards its nothing special on its own, especially compared to later video games, and don't go into this expecting much in the way of character development. Though that's no reason to give it the side-eye. I still found it to be a fun, charming experience, and it's clear the makers of Pokemon Trading Card Game 2 put a lot of love and care into this.\n\nWhile not much in the grand scheme of things, Pokemon Trading Card Game 2 is the sequel that other media wish they could have in that it expands on and improves upon everything the first game established and more. Sadly, at this point, we know it'll never get an official English release in any capacity, but at least the fan translation exists for those who want to play it on an emulator."
