From owning the Atari 2600 to the NES, transitioning to the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo to siding with Nintendo during the 64 vs. Playstation years. We have had the revolutionary Wii, the disaster of the Dreamcast, Wii U and PS3 eras. If you were a millennial video games were part of your upbringing. While Video Games were a huge part of my life it was pretty damn rare to see a face like mine in most early Video games. Streets of Rage’s ‘Adam’ was the first time I remember legitimately seeing a black playable character in a video game. Nowadays Black characters in video games are more commonplace, (I’m waiting on Samurai Warriors 5 with Yasuke to arrive next week [don’t judge me]) though some characters like Virtua Fighter’s Vanessa continue to have their skin tone get lighter and lighter [that’s a conversation for another time]. Positive black images [or black images in general] in media, be they TV, Comics, Music videos and even Video games has a positive effect on the self confidence of black children [sciencedaily, tandfonline].
