        "text": "Hey everyone. While Mortal Kombat is my favorite game series (along with Command & Conquer and Killzone), I feel an honest debate with others fans should be brought up in order to settle a big question not only with MK but with many games of our time. It is that of misogyny.\n\nMany of us know Grand Theft Auto as the flagship game for violence against women, or rather, as the game that was put on the spot for it. I want to share an experience. Prior to playing MK9 for the first time and then buying it, I watched a few LiveStreams of players who got the game early. After cycling through some Tag and single player ladder matches, the player got onto the Fatality Trainer. Of course I wanted to see this, what MK fan doesn't want to see the new installments of ogreish finishers?\n\nThe first fatality was Noob, of course, and the kid picked Jade to finish. Alright, so some angst leftover from the UMK3 days I guess. But then he picked Kung Lao, and his victim was Mileena. Scorpion, with Sonya as a victim. Then, Kano and Kitana. Then, back to Mileena. It got so bad that I and a couple other viewers pointed out his misogyny and deep-seated perversion. But most viewers were like \"yeah! haha!\" or \"**** yeah, awesome\". Some were even like \"that's hot\". Am I a pansy to say that's kind of creepy and ****ed up?\n\nThen, on DeviantArt, looking for signatures and avatars, I came upon this one kid \"TheInsaneDarkOne\". I won't lie, he is talented, but his drawings (comissioned!!) are all of some big, muscular MK guy beating/killing a female character. One set of pictures, he draws Sub-Zero sexually molesting Mileena. And I looked at the comments for these pictures, and they were all like \"sweet\", \"that's sexy\", \"awesome\", etc. Really? Is it just that isolated- that DeviantArt is full of sick creeps, or is this a sign of something the gaming community ought to look at?\n\n(http://theinsanedarkone.deviantart.com/)\n\nI love MK as much as the next guy. I've been following it for years; it was the first video game I played as a child and it remained fixated on my schema of video games throughout years. But sometimes, it creeps me out how far certain people will go. You can say that MK is in fact being egalitarian. That's a valid argument- but valid doesn't mean true.\n\nYes, MK has strong feminine characters like Sonya, Jade, and Kitana who take control and get things done. And yes, MK operates on the idea that women are equal to men and thus, we have women and men ninjas of equal strength and talent kicking the crap out of each other. BUT let's look at reality-> physically, men are at least 3-4x stronger than women. The effects of a real man-woman fight are devastating and there are 1 in 4 women in the US who experience abuse at the hands of men (I think that's an old statistic). While in the MK universe, Mileena and Scorpion may be of equal strength/skill, in the real world, there are abusive fathers and husbands and boyfriends beating on their girls and there is no such equal \"strength or skill\".\n\nWhat the game experience of a man v. woman fight brings is desensitization. It desensitizes men and women to the realities of misogyny and the violence against women. And in that desensitization lies less empathy, in the long run, for victims, and such cultural plague. It's very similar to the effect Eminem's lyrics have. And it's a desensitization that we can't afford to bear, because women and girls face hardships that men will never know and the reality of misogyny is something we can't dismiss. How many of you guys/girls have noticed this about MK, or about some people playing it that seem to enjoy this aspect of it? I was legit creeped out by that dude- he was like doing five, six, seven fatalities all on women. Personal problem of his, yes. But the ability to do things like that on a mass marketed game.... what does that have to say about society?\n\nIf any of you guys want to know more about this desensitization effect, Jackson Katz has an article on Eminem on his website. Mr. Katz is a speaker on women and gender issues that tours nationally and also researches. He and Dr. Thomas Keith, PhD, contribute to each others work sometimes. There are two good videos you can catch online: \"Tough Guise\" on masculinity and violence by Jackson Katz, and \"Generation M\" by Dr. Keith on misogyny in music and pop culture.\n\nhttp://www.jacksonkatz.com/eminem2.html\n\nAnd I'm not a WGS major.\n\nYou bring up a good point. And of course, Rule 36 (or is it 34?) applies to MK and misogyny as well. I actually think there is a name for it... \"Rinona\"? or something. This isn't an attack on MK, after all MK, like all other forms of culture, is just a reflection of the state of mind our society is in.\n\nCan I ask though, what exactly is appealing about slicing Mileena in half as opposed to Sektor or Kano? Done to the latter two, it's an act of violence. Done to the former, it's supposedly more \"appealing\". What is appealing about a woman getting killed or beaten? I'm not asking to offend, I really want to know. Is it a \"damsel in distress\" thing? Or does this point to our culture's objectification of women? I will admit, I am very much a fan of the feminine figure. I'm not arguing against sex. But the thing is, when music and movies, as well as video games, turn women into sex statues that stand in the background, or even main characters that are dressed in threads exposing the derriere, what does that minimize women's status to? Even in a heroic position, the woman is not without her thong. It seems that the pass in movies, music, and games is that women have to be deified for their sexuality or displayed as receptacles for male sexual impulse. Man and woman are made for each other. But as human beings, not objects! When is the last time you saw a billboard with a big, veiny penis on it in Times' Square?\n\nWhen women are lowered to the role of sex objects, complying with restricting beauty standards, all of which cater to men's desires... then women lose the qualities we attach to human beings in general- thought, emotion, validity, will, circumstance. It becomes lose-lose. Like.... \"it's her fault, she was asking for it\"... or \"DEEEAAAAYYYUUUMMMNNN lookadatbootaaay!\". Could it be that in effect, Mileena getting cut apart is seen deep down by those who find it \"more appealing\" as an object of sex being cut apart? If so that's profoundly frightening! It's like the ultimate statement of sexual objectification- \"You're only good for sex! Now DIE!\". And you're not the only one who's said women's pain in video games is appealing- look at Rumble Roses for that matter. And when MK9's first few tidbits came out last summer, people in the videos cheered when Kung Lao mid-sectioned Mileena, moreso than they did when Sub-Zero disemboweled Scorpion. Not a criticism- let's see what part of society gives us all this message that it is okay to and even promoted for, women to get hurt.\n\nIts shocking because this sort of stuff is not that different from men actually hurting women. It flows from the same vein, and while some may say \"video games are better than it happening in reality\" why has it made it this far, into video games in the first place?\n\nofcourse i don't think women should be degraded like that. I value talking to a strong, confident woman over a dumb hot one anyday. I don't like watching women get massacred in the game. I have no secret grudge against women . i think the majority of the people just like to watch women FULL STOP. ofcourse i don't like the idea. and it is kind of sad that this is what most people in the world want. But i want to ask you something. You are on a mortal kombat forum i.e. you like mortal kombat. what do you like about mortal kombat? story? gameplay? maturity? for me it's all of that. es the maturity is a needed factor for me. be that violence or sex.\n\nOfcourse opinions and tastes will differ. But the facts society has shown us is. sex sells. violence sells. sex+violence=Epic Win. ofcourse if u think about it, it sounds pretty disturbing but i'd be a hypocrite if i said i didn't like it and i wanted it to stop. As long as it's just in Games/Movies i'm fine with it. But people being influenced by that and acting it out in the real world is something totally different.\n\nSo basically i think it's a problem with the point of view. You look at it as women being mutilated. i look at it as ppl liking to watch women. everyone get's mutilated in the game ^^ so it's kind of fair.\n\nofcourse i don't think women should be degraded like that.

I'm just trying to find out why misogyny is popular in MK. I like MK mostly because of the storyline and characters- the violence never really got to me as I've seen some in real life (accident). But MK as a franchise, I like. I've always liked.\n\nWhile violence and sex sell, and most cultural outlets geared towards men feature a medley of both, I see that only applicable in that MK has violence, and MK has scantily clad women. But not as MK giving you the ability to kill scantily clad women as appealing. That's an entirely different beast- that's what I'm trying to understand. The whole man-v-woman fighting aspect and the misogyny, (TheInsaneDarkOne)-types who enjoy watching sexualized women being subjected to male violence. I think that needs to be explored in relations to society- because storyline and all stripped away, MK is just like GTA in that it gives the player the option to subject women to intense violence at the hands of men.\n\nI dunno man, it's a thing for some people. Don't let it get to you too much; I'm sure as an Internet dweller you're aware of how \"guro\" or gore fetishism has been a thing for years with some freaks. This weirdo might be into that. On that note, I don't let it bother me all that much because in MK, it's all about equal-opportunity murder. I personally don't approve of hurting women IRL, but part of the very core of Mortal Kombat fighting will often involve girls getting beat up, since they're there as player characters.\n\nNot to say everyone gets off on seeing the girl characters smacked around. I get as much of a rush pulling off a Fatality on a Reptile as I do a Sonya; the gender of the character doesn't matter to me.\n\nBut on that note, the Internet has spawned some twisted, utterly depraved people. Morality tends to fly out the window in this anonymous world of interconnected tubes, I've seen all kinds of utterly NASTY fantasies people fap over online.\n\nBut is it any worse that Street Fighter lets you beat up Chun-Li or that you can smack around the chicks in Dead or Alive?\n\nI understand the concern of misogyny, and I don't think NRS employees have a hatred of women. The MK females are sexy, sure, but that's become a commonly accepted facet of games, that there will be females made to look as attractive as possible.\n\nOutright hatred of/spite towards women, though? Don't let it get to you, man. Most people know better than these freaks.\n\nI certainly don't mean to knock your personal view on the matter and I do agree with the above poster that this is a rather intelligent topic. However, I do think that you may be reading into things a bit more than you should be. I doubt that either the youtube poster or the artist have any type of derogatory views on women in general nor do they mean to imply as such.\n\nAs far as the artist on DeviantArt is concerned, I actually found his skills to be rather impressive as an artist. I didn't particularly care for some of his work, but theres no denying that he is definitely skilled. One thing you have to consider about that site is that alot of times those artists get requests from people that want to see something in particular. It may not even come from his own pool of ideas. Granted, that does pose quite an interesting question. What does some of his work say about those people asking to see it?\n\nNow with the Youtube fatalities, well I think that's just a matter of the persons individual tastes perhaps. Maybe he simply doesn't care for any of the women in the game. That's not to say that he's a misogynist, perhaps it's just his personal taste. I'm personally not a big fan of the female characters in MK. They're alright, but just don't fit my play style much. When it comes to showing off fatalities however, I have always enjoyed performing them on my least favorite characters, mostly against Stryker, Sonya, or Sheeva, lol.\n\nMortal Kombat has always portrayed it's female characters in a very strong, competitive, but yet sexy sort of way. I've never felt that there was ever the slightest hint of misogyny to the game. It's female characters have always been on par with their male counterparts. I suppose that there are always going to be some sick bastards out there in the world with heavy misogynistic viewpoints , but I don't feel that they represent a very large percentage of the MK fanbase.\n\nThis is a very interesting thread indeed.\n\nI certainly don't mean to knock your personal view on the matter and I do agree with the above poster that this is a rather intelligent topic.

Boobs and ass aside, as that's a requirement for videogames it seems, MK women are more confident and leader-like. I actually really liked Jade's character in MK9. Very strong-minded and badass, as well as Sonya. MK was never short in that aspect. And it's not MK per se, or Boon that's a misogynist, or Rockstar games is misogynist. It's not that at all. Simply put, the game has an avenue for such things that is comparable to GTA.\n\nThere are far worse games, like DOA and Rumble Roses, that are very straightforward in their sexism.\n\nWhile Ryu and Chun Li can fight in video games, there's no killing aspect. I personally think desensitization to violence in general can lead to disastrous things if the wrong person gets their hands on it, but even moreso, how is it not an issue for the gaming world when fans of the most popular fighting games can pop in their CD and see scantily clad women getting beat? When you see some creep on Livestream killing women only, it's easy to say it's just him and not a reflection on society. But it's twice wrong, it IS a reflection on society and what is allowed (at least to be envisioned). I don't need to explain how serious of a problem abuse and rape are, they are things men and I as a man can never understand except only in an abstract sense, but we all have an idea. When someone's on the stream doing fatalities on women and people are cheering him on, it shows what's (underneath all properness and appearance) seen as alright. Sort of like \"*****es ain't shit but hoes and tricks\" and other lyrics in music. There are defenses for each and every one of these instances, but there's nothing intercepting the implications they have on the state of women in society. A kid doing fatalities on all women on livestream is not any different from someone fantasizing rape, after all, the women characters are portrayed in a helpless fashion and the men \"have their way\" with them. At least that's what I got from it after seeing the stream. It's debatable, but there's some link between it and the urges that men are told are okay to have, through subtle means like pop culture.\n\nI may be reading too much into it as some say but come on, let's be honest here, aside from dancing around the issue, there is a link between these themes."
