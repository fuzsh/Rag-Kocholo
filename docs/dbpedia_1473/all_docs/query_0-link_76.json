        "text": "For the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear game, see Mortal Kombat (8-bit).\n\nn/a\n\nMortal Kombat (モータルコンバット), also known as Mortal Kombat Kanzen-ban (モータルコンバット完全版) on the Mega-CD in Japan, is a 1992 arcade fighting game by Midway Manufacturing. At the time, it was considered revolutionary for its use of digitized graphics, though it was also met with controversy thanks to its high levels of violence.\n\nFollowing its release in the arcades, home versions were created and released in September 1993 on a date that became known as \"Mortal Monday.\" The Sega Mega Drive version was published by Arena Entertainment simultaneously in North America and Europe, with releases in Japan and Brazil some months later. An enhanced Sega Mega-CD version followed in 1994.\n\nStory\n\nThe game takes place in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being held on Shang Tsung's Island. Shang Tsung was banished to Earthrealm 500 years previously and, with the help of the monstrous Goro, is able to seize control of the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to doom the realm. For 500 years straight, Goro has been undefeated in the tournament and won nine consecutive tournaments. If Goro wins again, Shao Kahn, Emperor of Outworld, will be allowed to take Earthrealm. In order to prevent this, a new generation of warriors must challenge Goro.\n\nGameplay\n\nMortal Kombat is a fighting game in which players battle opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter that drains the opponent's health bar first wins the round, and the first to win two rounds wins the match. Each round is timed; if both fighters still have health remaining when time runs out, the one with more health wins the round. At the end of the final round, the losing character is dazed, and the winning fighter has a short amount of time to perform a Fatality, a finishing move performed against a defeated opponent to execute them in a gruesome fashion. Two players can start a game together, or a second player can join in during a single player's game by pressing START to fight against them. If a game was in progress at the time, the winner continues it alone; if not, the winner begins a new game.\n\nIn the single-player game, the player faces each of the seven playable characters in a series of one-on-one matches against computer-controlled opponents, ending in a \"Mirror Match\" against a duplicate of the player's chosen character and then three endurance matches against two opponents. As soon as the player defeats the first opponent, the second one enters the arena and the timer resets, but the player's health meter does not regenerate. After the third endurance match, the player fights the sub-boss Goro, followed by a final match against Shang Tsung.\n\nBetween certain levels, players can compete in a mini-game called \"Test Your Might\" for bonus points, breaking blocks of various materials by filling a meter past a certain point through rapid button presses. The first material the player must break is wood, followed by stone, steel, ruby, and finally diamond, with each successive material requiring more of the meter to be filled up and thus awarding more points. Two players can compete in the mini-game at once; the last two materials are only accessible through two-player mode.\n\nCharacters move with and and crouch with . They jump with and jump back and forth with and . All characters have punches and kicks that can either be aimed high or low. Characters perform a low punch with , a high punch with , a low kick with , and a high kick with . Characters block by holding or . Blocking can be done while standing or crouching. Some attacks cannot be blocked while standing (such as sweeps). All attacks do a small amount of damage even when blocked.\n\nWhen using a standard three-button control pad, characters perform a low punch with , a high punch with + or + , a low kick with , and a high kick with , and START blocks.\n\nAll characters have a shared set of attacks performed by holding the D-Pad in various directions, such as the roundhouse kick, leg sweep, and uppercut. Uppercuts knock the enemy high into the air and cause a large amount of damage. The game introduced the concept of \"juggling,\" knocking an opponent into the air and following up with a combination of attacks while the enemy is still airborne and defenseless. Normal moves are mostly the same between characters, with variations in range and speed, but characters differ in their special moves. Most special moves are performed by moving the D-Pad in certain directions, usually ending with an attack button. Unlike most one-on-one fighting games, few moves involve semicircular directional motions. The game's blocking system also distinguished itself from other fighting games, as it uses a dedicated block button, and characters take a small amount of damage from regular moves while blocking. However, the dedicated block button allows characters to defend against attacks without retreating, so blocking characters lose very little ground when struck, making counterattacks much easier after a successful block.\n\nThere are five difficulty settings for computer-controlled opponents (Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard) and allow the player to change the number of starting credits in the options. Violent finishing moves are censored and blood is disabled by default in the Mega Drive version (but not the Mega-CD version). By entering a special code, blood is enabled and some finishing moves are more graphic.\n\nCharacters\n\nNote: Move lists assume that the character is facing right. When facing left, and should be reversed.\n\nAll characters can perform roundhouse kicks with + HK (which knock the opponent away), leg sweeps with + LK (which cause the opponent to fall down), and uppercuts with + LP or + HP (which knock the opponent high into the air). Throws are performed by pressing HK when next to the opponent.\n\nWhen using a standard three-button control pad, the LP button can generally substitute for either LP or HP when performing special moves.\n\nFatalities often require being a certain distance from the opponent in order to execute. All finishing moves can be performed while holding the BL button, which is sometimes useful to avoid accidentally moving or hitting the opponent before the button combination is fully pressed. The Pit stage has a unique stage-specific Fatality, performed by simply finishing with an uppercut. The \"blood code\" must be entered to see the Fatalities as described.\n\nPlayable\n\nJohnny Cage A famous martial artist and movie star who entered the tournament for the publicity.\n\nMove list Name Command Description Green Flame LP or HP Johnny Cage throws a fireball across the screen.

If found, Reptile is fought at the bottom of the Pit.\n\nHistory\n\nRelease\n\nSega's success with the Mega Drive version of the game prompted Nintendo to change their somewhat strict policies put forward in the late 1980s, and the Super NES version of the sequel, Mortal Kombat II, features red blood. Sega's Videogame Rating Council was also criticised for rating the Mega Drive version of the game a MA-13, implying that the game's content in its non-censored state was suitable for 13-year-olds. Mortal Kombat and other games such as Night Trap would inspire the creation of the ESRB, which would cover all game consoles in North America and remains in place to this day.\n\nThe release of the game caused big controversy in Germany. Initially, all versions of the game went on sale in Germany due to the fact that they were censored. USK detected that the Sega version of the game have a code to unlock the blood so it was decided to withdraw all copies of the game from Germany and banning the game. In 2005, the game disappeared from the list of banned games.\n\nLegacy\n\nMortal Kombat was followed by Mortal Kombat II in the following year, and continues to see sequels to this day.\n\nVersions\n\nMega Drive version\n\nThe Mega Drive version was a mini-success story for Sega. This is because the Super Nintendo version, at the time in direct competition with Sega's console, opted for strict censorship, removing blood, toning down fatalities and creating a far less \"violent\" product. The Mega Drive version was considerably more faithful to the arcade original, and was the preferred choice at the time by consumers.\n\nThe music was also rearranged by Matt Furniss, this arrangement being unique to this port.\n\nMega-CD version\n\nThe Mega-CD version was rated MA-17 in North America and was therefore subject to less criticism. It has the violence enabled by default (and in fact has a cheat code to turn it down, the inverse of the Mega Drive version).\n\nAs well as a CD audio soundtrack (which is essentially a recording of the arcade version), the game contains a grainy version of the famous \"Mortal Monday\" TV commercial. Some tracks play in the wrong stages, though there are some bonus remixes that can be heard if the game is played on a regular CD player.\n\nThe Mega-CD version is otherwise identical to the Mega Drive version, though load times can mean that Shang Tsung is open to attack while transforming. Curiously, this version uses fighting music track from Amiga port when fighting Shang Tsung.\n\nProduction credits\n\nMega Drive version\n\nMega-CD version\n\nMagazine articles\n\nMain article: Mortal Kombat/Magazine articles.\n\nPromotional material\n\nMain article: Mortal Kombat/Promotional material.\n\nPhysical scans\n\nMega Drive version\n\n83 Based on\n\n47 reviews\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nMega-CD version\n\n74 Based on\n\n24 reviews\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nTechnical information\n\nMain article: Mortal Kombat/Technical information.\n\nReferences\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nMain page | Comparisons | Hidden content | Magazine articles | Video coverage | Reception | Promotional material | Region coding | Technical information | Bootlegs"
