        "text": "The new Tier Four character for Mob Wars: La Cosa Nostra are now available! They unlock at Level 2,500 for a base cost of 250 FP (100 FP if you own the Tier Three contemporary). Check out your new Mobster options below:\n\nSlicer\n\nFaster Energy and Cash regeneration than its Level 1,000 contemporary\n\n+4% more Cash in Jobs.\n\n-1.5% on Bank deposit fees.\n\n-2% Energy required for Jobs.\n\nThe Slicer is a master of hand-to-hand combat, wielding an arsenal of wicked blades used to dice their opponents apart in a violent dance.\n\nBoomer\n\nFaster Energy and Stamina regeneration than its Level 1,000 contemporary\n\n+0.5% power boost applied when you are Attacking and Defending in Fights.\n\n-2% Energy required for Jobs.\n\nA passionate pyromaniac, the only thing left of the Boomer's enemies once they're through with them is a scorch mark on the ground.\n\nSniper\n\nFaster Stamina and Cash regeneration than its Level 1,000 contemporary\n\n+0.5% power boost applied when you are Attacking and Defending in Fights.\n\n+2% more Cash in Jobs.\n\n-1.5% on Bank deposit fees.\n\nLike an angel of death the sniper delivers annihilation from afar, their victims forever oblivious to their fate.\n\nCharacter Switching\n\nCharacter Switching is a new feature that will make selecting your characters easier, give you a discount for following an upgrade path through the tiers and will allow you to swap between owned characters at any time. Check out a walkthrough of Character Switching here: Character Switching\n\nYes, the discount only applies if it is in the same gender and lineage. That's been mentioned a few times, but there has been a lot of info about the new characters so I can understand if you missed it.\n\nBeing a level 6k I will wait until there is a new character closer to my level. I do have a suggestion. When introducing new characters, Kano should look into introducing specific crafting items associated with the characters. I know there are items associated with the characters, and I am not speaking about them. Maybe after x levels new items could be introduced. Think on itl\n\nI know this is minor, but you guys have fixed minor annoyances for me in the past so...\n\nWhen you open a pop up window on the page normally you can click outside of to make it go away. When you open the Select Character window on the page, you cannot click out of it to disappear it, you have to click on the \"Close X\" button. Can this be fixed?\n\nAlso, can you introduce a close chat button outside of the chat window box? Similar to the open chat button, but exactly the opposite?\n\nI moved your post into this thread to keep it relevant as it was originally posted in the BA changes thread.\n\nTo answer your questions there is no estimated time when the higher level characters will be completed. Development priorities have shifted since then to focus on features such as the Raid Boss, Power Heal, BA changes, new achievements and a few other things. I don't know if we'd see a new release of characters before Christmas, but I can see if we can get something queued up for early 2015 if possible."
