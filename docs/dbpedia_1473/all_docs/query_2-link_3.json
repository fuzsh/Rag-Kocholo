        "text": "NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED\n\nWelcome back to my blog! Let’s now tackle the final Mortal Kombat installment that featured digitized actors and figures. Mortal Kombat 2 surpassed the first Mortal Kombat’s success and the MK fan base intensified. As expected, the developers immediately worked on the third installment and this time, newer techniques and advanced tactics were introduced such as the run button, character-specific combos and multi-tiered stages. Aside from the staple finishers such as character fatalities, stage fatalities, babality and friendship, a new finisher was also added: Animality, where the character transforms into an animal and executes a unique finish on the defeated opponent. Additionally, the in-game story now thickens as it now involves the merging of Earthrealm and Outworld.\n\nRichard DiVizio makes a return as his original MK character, Kano. The character of Kano was dropped during the second installment because he was deemed not popular enough and the producers ensured that his comeback will be more appreciated by the fans. This time around, his costume has been upgraded; he now wears a black, modified Shaolin uniform with red linings, red forearm and leg guards, black shoes and gray utility belt bags; one on his waist and one across his chest. He also retained his trademark cybernetic right eye.\n\nFor Kano’s story, it was revealed that although he survived the first tournament, he and Sonya were captured by Shang Tsung’s armies and were presented as captives to appease the Outworld Emperor, Shao Kahn. Jax, Sonya’s senior officer, rescued Sonya and also freed Kano to arrest him. However, Kano escaped capture and instead convinces Shao Kahn to spare his soul during the Outworld invasion. Kano was then assigned by Shao Kahn to train the Outworld warriors on how to use Earth’s weapons.\n\nTo address his supposed unpopularity back in the first installment, Kano’s moves this time were more fleshed out: his knife throw animation was improved and he can now perform his cannonball roll attack diagonally upwards. He gains new moves such as the knife swipe, an air throw and chokehold throw. His new fatality finishers are composed of his eye beam and the bizarre ability to extract the opponent’s whole skeleton from the body.\n\nRich was assigned another character, a new entry to the roster, Kabal. For this character, he was provided a different set of costume: a black leather jacket and gloves, brown cargo pants, black knee guards and shin guards, white shoes and a long black wig as his hair. However, the most iconic item from his costume is his respirator mask connecting his vials of oxygen supply via a black, rubber tube. This was explained by the developers that they wanted to introduce a heavily injured character but was still able to fight.\n\nDuring the invasion of Earthrealm by Shao Kahn, extermination squads were sent out to eliminate the people of earth. Kabal was a survivor of one of the attacks initiated by the said extermination squads. His injuries and disfigurement were so severe that he can only survive by the assistance of artificial respirators. Wanting vengeance, he teams up with the Earthrealm warriors to defeat Shao Kahn. It was also revealed that Kabal was a former member of the Black Dragon criminal organization and was acquainted with Kano.\n\nDespite being a new character, Kabal immediately became a top-tier character because of his unique over-powered moves and overwhelming speed. His most iconic move is the Tornado Spin Dash, where with superhuman speed, he dashes past the opponent, causing the opponent to spin around and becomes dizzy, giving Kabal a free hit on the opponent. He is also able to perform a plasma projectile blast from his mask, which can be done either at ground or in mid-air. Kabal also has the ability to summon a ground saw from behind the opponent attacking them at their feet (the ground saw looked like a mutated spinning blades from Outworld; the developers probably didn’t have enough time to animate an actual ground saw). Kabal also uses Chinese-style hookswords especially during combo attacks. His finishers are nothing short of outrageous; in his first fatality, he inflates the opponent’s head using his respirator until they float and eventually explodes while in his second fatality, he reveals his heavily disfigured face and uses it to literally scare the opponent that the opponent’s soul escapes the body and runs away from him.\n\nAnother returning actor is Anthony “Tony” Marquez, reprising the role of Kung Lao. While retaining his trademark hat, Tony’s costume was now updated to show more of his physique by wearing a black sleeveless garb, exposing his chest and arms, modified shaolin pants that were digitally altered to appear light brown, silver forearm and shin guards, and black Kung Fu shoes. Additionally, the “Wu” Chinese character was retained on his garb.\n\nFor his story in MK3, Kung Lao was able to defeat Outworld opponents and avenges the death of his great ancestor. He then returns to Earthrealm to train a new generation of Shaolin warriors alongside Liu Kang. However, they have to put their plans on hold after Shao Kahn started his invasion. Kung Lao and the remaining Earthrealm warriors must band together to defeat Shao Kahn and stop his plans.\n\nFor MK3, Kung Lao’s moves were retained, however, his hat throw was modified where he throws his hat in a vertical motion towards the opponent. His hat throw fatality was also modified where instead of simply decapitating the opponent, his hat also slices through the limbs and waist of the unlucky opponent. He has a new outrageous fatality where he upgrades his whirlwind spin move, turning into a human tornado, sucking in the opponent to his direction, where the opponent explodes into various body parts; like food being thrown into a food processor!\n\nAlso returning is John Parrish, reprising his role as Major Jackson “Jax” Briggs. For his costume, Jax retains his utility belt, black military boots and black athletic pants where the red linings were digitally altered to appear purple. A major update was his entire arms and hands painted silver which were digitally altered to appear metallic.\n\nDuring Mortal Kombat 2, Jax was successful in rescuing Sonya. In the process, he also freed Kano to arrest him but Kano was able to escape back to Outworld. Jax and Sonya tried to warn the United States government about the impending menace from Outworld. However, because they lacked proof, their report was ignored as Shao Kahn initiated the Outworld invasion of Earth. To prepare for the impending battle, Jax fitted his arms with indestructible bionic implants.\n\nJax maintained his “big strong guy” archetype in this installment as most of his original moves were retained to boast his brute strength. For his new moves, he now has a projectile attack where he can launch missiles from his arm implants and an effective dash punch that can knock the opponent off their feet. His new fatality capitalizes on his arm implants where he converts it to long blades, slashing the opponent to pieces. He also has a new, outrageous fatality where magically becomes a giant and stomps the opponent under his foot.\n\nThe last of our returning actor is Brian Glynn, who reprises his role as Shao Kahn and retains his exact set of costume from Mortal Kombat 2. His original costume was probably very iconic to the fans so the developers decided to retain it.\n\nAfter being defeated in Mortal Kombat 2, Shao Kahn became frustrated with the continuous failed attempts to conquer Earthrealm. However, he devised a plan in order to merge Outworld with Earthrealm: Shao Kahn instructed his shadow priests, led by Shang Tsung, to resurrect his deceased queen, Sindel, in Earthrealm. Sindel’s resurrection in Earthrealm would allow Shao Kahn to pass through the borders between of the two realms. Reclaiming his queen, Shao Kahn thus forced a merger between the Outworld and Earthrealm, slowly turning Earth into a part of Outworld. With his invasion, Shao Kahn sent out his extermination squads to wipe out lives in Earthrealm.\n\nShao Kahn was again the final boss in the game and by default, was unplayable. However, by using a cheat code, he can be playable but cannot perform finishers. Like in the previous game, he still has no jump/aerial moves, his basic punch/kick attacks cause more damage than the regular characters and he retains his ground dash attack. He gains new special moves: his green projectile arrow was replaced with a green fireball from his eyes, a rising dash attack for anti-air attacks and a hammer smash attack. With all of these elements combined, he is one of the most over-powered characters in the game.\n\nWe welcome our first new actor to join the MK3 crew, the beautiful Kerri Hoskins. Kerri worked as a production assistant and model for Playboy Magazine. She has also worked for Midway as an actress for NBA JAM. Kerri became part of the MK crew after Liz Malecki, the original actress who played Sonya, separated ways with Midway; Kerri was roped in to become her replacement. With her stunning good looks and experience in boxing, wrestling stunts and gymnastics, Kerri was an amazing addition to the cast. For her costume, Kerri wore a more updated style of athletic wear consisting of black, white and green colors, black headband, gloves and arm bands, white shoes and a thin belt with metal circles. Additionally, her long blonde hair was tied in a ponytail with some side fringe in front.\n\nDuring Mortal Kombat 2, Sonya was held captive in Outworld together with her nemesis, Kano. She was soon rescued by her superior, Maj. Jackson “Jax” Briggs. Kano was freed as well but was able to escape their arrest. Returning home, Sonya and Jax warned the US Government about the impending Outworld invasion of Earth. However, their superiors ignored their warnings for lack of proof. As Shao Kahn’s invasion began, he strips the Earth of all human life and claimed every soul as his own. However, Sonya and Jax’s souls were protected as they were among the chosen few to represent Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat. Realizing that there are other Earthrealm warriors who survived, Sonya and Jax set on a mission to team up with these warriors and stop Shao Kahn’s plans.\n\nFor MK3, Sonya’s classic moves were retained but were made flashier. She gains a new move where she performs a rising bicycle kick, which provides an excellent anti-air attack. She also retains her Kiss of Death fatality and this time, has two variants: the classic one which burns the opponent alive and an updated one where she blows a pinkish energy field causing her opponent to explode. Her friendship finisher shows her performing aerobics arm exercises (this would be further updated in UMK3 and MKT where she causes blue flowers to bloom across the stage).\n\nOur second new actor to join the MK3 crew is John Turk. A professional bodybuilder with experiences in Taekwondo and competitive fighting, John previously worked in the Chicago police department and eventually shifted his career to modelling and acting. At the time, his modelling agency sent him to audition for a spot in the production of Mortal Kombat 3. With Daniel Pesina, the original actor for Sub-Zero, separating ways with Midway, John Turk was hired to take over the character of Sub-Zero. For this installment, Sub-Zero has been unmasked and a huge vertical scar was placed across his right eye. He was given an updated costume: he wore a sleeveless garb with square designs that exposes his arms and pectoral muscles, black tight pants with bold stripes across his thighs and crotch area, gray belt, shin guards and wrist guards, black strings laced across his forearms – the square designs and stripes were digitally altered to appear blue. Additionally, his hair was dyed black as a reference to Sub-Zero’s in-game White-Asian heritage. (https://infamouskarl.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/ethnic-retcons-in-video-games/)\n\nAfter the events of Mortal Kombat 2, Sub-Zero returned to the Lin Kuei clan only to discover that the clan has started converting their members into soulless cyborgs. Sub-Zero refused to take part in this directive and left the Link Kuei. Because Sub-Zero has broken the sacred codes of honor, the Lin Kuei sent out their first batch of cyber ninjas to assassinate Sub-Zero. With the start of Shao Kahn’s invasion, Sub-Zero must not only defend himself from the threat of Outworld but also from the Lin Kuei.\n\nFor MK3, Sub-Zero retained his iconic ice freeze projectile but has added a new arsenal of attacks. He gains a new move called ice shower, where he aims his ice freeze attack upwards with the actual ice raining over the opponent. With a successful hit, the opponent will freeze and would be in a vulnerable state. Additionally, the player can control where the ice shower attack will fall in reference to Sub-Zero’s location. He also gains the ice clone move where he is able to create a clone of himself made from ice as he jumps back away from the clone. If the opponent comes into contact with the clone, the opponent will freeze and be vulnerable for attacks. His new fatality finishers were also a departure from his classic ones: for this installment, he now freezes his opponent in close then shatters their body over his head. His second fatality involves him breathing out a mist of ice towards his opponent, freezing them and break into pieces once hitting the ground. To further reference his control over ice, his friendship finisher involves him making a snowman out of himself :D.\n\nJohn was then assigned another existing character, Shang Tsung. John was given Shang Tsung’s role after Philip Ahn, the original actor, separated ways with Midway. For this installment, Shang Tsung’s costume now consist of a black sleeveless garb exposes his arms and pectoral muscles, a black loincloth that is knotted to also form a belt, underneath is a pair of tight pants digitally altered to be colored dark yellow, a pair of black tight boots and gray wrist guards. John also had to wear a long black wig tied into a ponytail. Black paint was applied across his eyes and face and his eyes were digitally altered to appear pupilless to give him a menacing look. Also, a fake goatee was also applied to him as a reference to Shang Tsung’s facial hair.\n\nBeing Shao Kahn’s lead sorcerer, Shang Tsung was instrumental in Shao Kahn’s plan in conquering Earthrealm. Shang Tsung led Shao Kahn’s shadow priests to resurrect Sindel, Shao Kahn’s deceased queen, in Earthrealm. With the successful resurrection of Sindel leading to a merger between Earthrealm and Outworld, Shang Tsung was granted more powers than ever before and was assigned to eliminate the Earthrealm survivors of the invasion.\n\nUnlike previous installments where Shang Tsung was designated either as the main boss or the antepenultimate boss, he was not assigned a boss status in this installment. He retains his classic flaming skulls projectile and his ability to morph into other playable characters, being able to execute their own special moves. This time around, he gains a new move where he summons three consecutive flaming skulls rising from the ground, towards his direction. His soul steal fatality was made flashier this time around, where he would levitate the opponent in the air, extracting the soul and leave his opponent in a decomposed state.\n\nThe next new actor on our list is Eddie Wong, who portrays Liu Kang. Ho Sung Pak, the original actor who played Liu Kang in the first two games, has separated with Midway and the production team needed a replacement for him. Eddie Wong, an actor and stuntman, was roped in for the role of Liu Kang. For this installment, a few modifications were done on Liu Kang’s costume: while his MK2 pants were retained, black shin guards were added and this time, Liu Kang is now wearing white socks underneath his black Kung Fu shoes. His studded forearm guards and red headband were retained however, his hair is now much longer with a few fringes hanging in front.\n\nDuring MK2, Liu Kang again emerged as the champion of Mortal Kombat, beating Shao Kahn and his minions. After the tournament, Liu Kang went back to Earthrealm alongside Kung Lao to train a new generation of Shaolin warriors. However, with the start of Shao Kahn’s invasion of Earthrealm, Liu Kang had to put his plans on hold as he finds himself the prime target of Shao Kahn’s extermination squads.\n\nFor MK3, Liu Kang retained all his moves from the previous games and no new moves were introduced. However, he has two new fatalities: the first one in which he disappears from the screen and transforms his essence into fire within the opponent, burning his opponent to the ground. His second fatality involves him disappearing again only for a classic MK1 arcade machine dropping onto the opponent, outrageously crushing them as he reappears on screen. In MK3, a new finisher was introduced called “Animality” where fighters can transform into their spirit animal as a finisher. To reflect his classic fatality from MK2, Liu Kang transforms into a green, mythical Chinese dragon, devouring the upper half of his opponent.\n\nNext on our list is Amelia Montelongo who plays a new character, Sindel. Fondly called “Lia”, she was the youngest actor to join the crew at the age of 19. During the development for Sindel, the developers were looking for a fit actress who can perform the required movements. At the time, Lia was dating Brian Glynn, the actor who played Shao Kahn and was referred to the play the part. A fitness enthusiast, Lia has experience in taekwondo and is also a skilled dancer. After a successful audition, she was then assigned the role of Sindel, who coincidentally is Shao Kahn’s queen in the story! For Sindel’s costume, Lia had to wear a sleeveless leotard, a sleeveless vest, goth-style stockings and fingerless gloves – all of which with a white, black and digitally altered violet color theme. She wore black nails and a long, top-heavy, white wig with a black streak across the middle. She was also given a heavy eye make-up and her eyes were digitally altered to appear pupilless, giving her a strong, menacing look.\n\nFor Sindel’s in-game story, she was introduced as Shao Kahn’s long-deceased queen who died an untimely death. After he was defeated in Mortal Kombat 2, Shao Kahn devised a plan to invade Earthrealm. He had his shadow priests resurrect Sindel in Earthrealm, which will effectively cause a merger between Outworld and Earthrealm. Being reunited with Shao Kahn, Sindel was resurrected in a brainwashed state, completely loyal to the Outworld Emperor, as they began stripping the Earth will all human life. However, it was soon revealed that Sindel was actually the rightful queen of another realm called Edenia, and together with her husband, King Jerrod, are the parents of Kitana. It was revealed that 10,000 years ago, Shao Kahn attacked Edenia and merged it with Outworld, murdered King Jerrod, took Sindel as his queen and adopted the young Kitana as his daughter. These events were all too much for Sindel to bear and she decided to take her own life. However, Shao Kahn and his sorcerers were able to stop Sindel’s transition to the afterlife and was able to get hold of Sindel’s soul until it was her time to be resurrected.\n\nBeing a new character in the installment, Sindel’s fighting style provides a unique gameplay and strategy: she has a straight projectile move where she releases a blue fireball from her mouth which can also be done in mid-air but diagonally downwards. She also has a unique move where she screams towards the opponent who gets paralyzed towards her direction, enabling her to make a free hit. She is also the only character who is able to fly and can float across the screen; during this state, the only attack she can perform is her mid-air fireball move. Among all the characters, her throw move is the most unique, where her hair magically grows, grabbing the opponent and tosses them at the other side. Her fatalities are nothing short of being bizarre. In her first fatality, she lets out an inhuman scream that causes her opponents’ skin to literally fall off, leaving behind a bloodied skeleton. In her second fatality, her hair magically grows and entirely wraps the opponent and with a flip of her head, sends her opponent spinning with their body parts being scattered out of the screen.\n\nAnother new actor to join the MK3 crew is Michael O’Brien who plays a new character, Kurtis Stryker. Michael is an actor and has played minor roles in films. Stryker’s costume consists of a simple white, short sleeved-shirt with a wide pattern digitally altered to appear blue with the neckline and sleeves having thick black linings. He also wears black police pants, combat boots, fingerless gloves, a utility belt bag, a chest holster and a cap worn on his head, but turned backwards.\n\nFor his story, Kurtis Stryker was introduced as New York-based police officer, leading the riot control brigade. When Shao Kahn began his invasion on Earthrealm, an Outworld portal appeared over New York City, panic and chaos raged out of control as Shao Kahn and his minions, started taking human souls among the population. Stryker emerged as the lone survivor of this onslaught as the thunder god, Rayden, appeared before him explaining that he was among the chosen few to represent Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat. Stryker was instructed to travel west to team up with the remaining Earthrealm warriors and stop Shao Kahn’s evil plans.\n\nBeing a police officer, Stryker’s attacks are based from police combat tactics and weapons. He is armed with a police baton which he uses in his combo attacks, throw attack and special moves. In his first special move, he somehow swiftly floats feet first, towards the opponent, grabbing them with his baton and tossing them over his head. His next baton special move is actually a sweep move where he swings his baton across his opponent’s legs and knocks them off their feet. He has projectile moves where he launches grenades either at a low or high angle. In the succeeding UMK3 installment, he obtains an effective gun blast attack. He also applies his police background in his finishers: he either sets up explosives on his opponent’s body causing them to explode or fires his taser gun, electrocuting his opponent. In his friendship finisher, he acts as a traffic enforcer, allowing other fighters to run across the screen. With these unique set of attacks, Stryker is easily one of the most overpowered characters in the game. Despite that, he was low-tier character due to his very generic, realistic design as opposed to established classic characters with iconic status.\n\nThe next new actor on our list is Sal DiVita, portraying a new character, Nightwolf. During that time, Sal was already working for Midway and was already acquainted with several MK crew members and actors. He has worked both as a game developer and actor on several wrestling games produced by Midway. During the development of Mortal Kombat 3, he was tapped by the John Tobias to join the crew as he already had the required physique, and was assigned the game’s first Native American character, Nightwolf. For his costume, Sal wore a black leather vest with small circular metal studs in the chest area and huge red wolf symbol at the back. His athletic pants were digitally colored blue with the sides having black linings and square cutouts. He also wore a black belt adorned with circular metal studs, moccasin boots for his footwear, gray wrist guards, a black, shoulder-length wig, armbands and headband, both digitally altered to appear blue. Additionally, he also wears two white feathers pointed downwards attached to the right side of his headband and a red, wolf-like silhouette face paint. His eyes were also digitally rendered as pupilless.\n\nNightwolf was introduced as an American Indian historian, shaman and preserver of his Lakota people’s culture. When Shao Kahn began his invasion on earth, Nightwolf uses his shamanic knowledge to protect his tribal lands from Shao Kahn’s forces. With his tribal lands becoming a protected area from Shao Kahn, Nightwolf helps the remaining Earthrealm warriors to regroup in his area as they plan to stop Shao Kahn’s evil plans.\n\nNightwolf’s move list capitalizes on his shamanic spiritual powers combined with traditional Native American weapons. His most effective attack is the hatchet uppercut which serves both as a regular and anti-air attack. He is capable of creating a magical bow and arrow made from green energy which serves as his projectile move. He has a ground-based, elbow dash attack and his most effective move, the reflector, where he charges his body with green energy giving him the ability to reflect his opponent’s projectile attacks back to the actual opponent (this move, however does not work on Motaro, the sub-boss of MK3 who by default, is able to reflect back projectile attacks). For his fatality finisher, Nightwolf summons a pilar of light from the sky towards the opponent that causes the opponent to decompose and eventually disappear together with the light. His second fatality involves him drawing his hatchet as he summons lightning to charge it and delivers the same lightning bolt towards the opponent, electrocuting them. For his Animality, as his namesake, he transforms into a wolf, viciously attacking the opponent. He has two versions of friendship finishers: the first one where he magically morphs into MK2 Rayden as an MK2 arcade machine drops by his side, and the second one, where he juggles 3 hatchets.\n\nSal was assigned a new costume and this time, in a form of new concept – a ninja cyborg. The costume is composed of a black body suit, various robotic-style armor – robot head, breastplate, guards for the shoulders, elbow and forearms and a fauld – all of which are colored red, and additional armor – a belt, knee and shin guards – all of which are colored gray. The robot head was inspired by the designs of Star Wars’ Boba Fett and the Predator. The developers planned to have two cyborg characters – one is the default red while the second one will be digitally colored yellow – however, they couldn’t decide on finalizing names for them and for a long time, they were simply named “Ketchup” and “Mustard”. Finally, the developers settled on “Sektor” for the red one and “Cyrax” for the yellow one. The developers then added a third cyborg ninja, but this time, based from an existing human character, Smoke. For Smoke, his armor has been digitally colored grayish-blue, with puffs of smoke emitting from his body just like his original human form.\n\nSektor, Cyrax and Smoke were originally human assassins serving the Lin Kuei clan alongside Sub-Zero. However, the Lin Kuei clan soon initiated an automation technology that would convert their human assassins into soulless cyborgs. Sektor and Cyrax volunteered for this automation and became the first prototypes of cybernetic ninjas. Sub-Zero and Smoke were unwilling to submit to this process and tried to escape the Lin Kuei. While Sub-Zero was able to successfully escape, Smoke was captured and was forced to undergo conversion. Eventually, the three cybernetic ninjas were programmed to find and assassinate Sub-Zero while Shao Kahn begins his invasion of Earthrealm. Without souls, the three cyborgs went undetected by Shao Kahn and his minions, as they try to complete their mission.\n\nWith a very excellent concept of cyber ninjas, Sektor, Cyrax and Smoke became favorites among fans thanks to their unique design and effective move list: Cyrax can make his body explode into pieces only to teleport at the opponent’s opposite side, reforming his entire body. Sektor and Smoke boast an effective rocket punch where they teleport downwards and reappearing at the opponent’s opposite side from the bottom, uppercuts the opponent off their feet. The cyborgs are also able to launch various weapons from their robotic chests. Cyrax and Smoke have their own version of rendering a free hit: Cyrax launches a net of green plasma while Smoke launches a three-pronged spear; these weapons trap the opponent and with a successful hit, brings the opponent towards them for a free hit. Sektor is able to launch a basic missile projectile and a homing one that follows the opponent wherever they go. Cyrax is able to launch bombs at certain distances and explodes after some time delay where the explosion launches the opponent into the air. Among the three cyborgs, only Smoke is able to render himself invisible. It’s also noteworthy that when they are hit, black oil spurts out instead of the default red blood from other human/human-like characters (this only applies during actual fights and not during finishers). When it comes to their signature finishers, it’s also not short of being outrageous and brilliant: Sektor crushes his opponent by launching a compactor, Cyrax activates his self-destruct program which causes himself and his opponent to explode, and Smoke fills the entire world with bombs and the entire earth, and its occupants, explodes into oblivion.\n\nAfter Goro achieved an iconic status after the first game, the MK developers soon wanted to introduce a female version of him in MK3. This led to the introduction of Sheeva, the first female four-armed Shokan warrior and also, the first playable Shokan character in the series. Like Goro and Kintaro, a stop-motion figure was created for the character of Sheeva. Sheeva was sculpted with a muscular, female physique and just like her Shokan predecessors, had 4 arms each with 3 huge fingers. Her long, black hair only grows from the top of her otherwise bald head and is surrounded by small, white horns. Her costume is simply a red cloth strap fashioned like a sling bikini, a black belt with a Yin and Yang symbol and gray forearm and ankle guards. Interestingly, her name is based from the Hindu deity Shiva, who also had four arms.\n\nSheeva’s story reveals that she and her Shokan race of Outworld have been long-time allies with Shao Kahn and his minions. Noted for her fierce, fighting prowess, Sheeva was handpicked by Shao Kahn to become the personal protector of his newly resurrected queen, Sindel. As Shao Kahn started his invasion of Earthrealm, Sheeva became suspicious of Shao Kahn’s loyalty towards the Shokan when he designated Motaro, along with his Centaurian race, to lead his extermination squads. Sheeva’s suspicion arises from the fact that the Shokan race has been in a long-time conflict with the Centaurian race, with each group considering the other their natural enemy. Despite Sheeva’s suspicions, she accompanies her masters in the ongoing Earthrealm invasion.\n\nUnlike Goro and Kintaro, Sheeva is more agile and is capable of various attack patterns. However, her attack power is at range with most regular characters. Sheeva inherits the signature Shokan move, the teleport stomp. She also has another stomp move that causes a ground damage towards her opponent. Her finishers emphasize her brute strength and four arms: her first finisher involves her pounding her opponent, driving them deep into the ground while for her second finisher, she literally rips the skin and flesh of her opponent from their skeleton. Sheeva is also notable for being the first MK character spurting green-colored blood when being hit (this only applies during actual fights and not during finishers).\n\nFor MK3, the developers soon departed from the four-armed Shokan as a sub-boss and opted for a Greek mythology-inspired creature, the Centaur. We are introduced to Motaro, the sub-boss of Mortal Kombat 3. Like previous sub-bosses, a stop-motion figure was made for the character of Motaro. His human upper body part was sculpted with a very muscular built, black ram horns on his head and sharp bones protruding from his elbows. While for his lower body part, it is that of a brown-colored horse: he wears a black and gray armor strip on the horse breast part while his tail is that of a snake and is gray in color.\n\nMotaro belongs to the Centaurian race from Outworld where they are the natural enemies of the Shokan. After the defeat of the Shokan warriors, Goro and Kintaro in the previous Mortal Kombat tournaments, Shao Kahn soon began to favor the Centaurians over the Shokan, as he aided them in the subjugation of the Shokan race. As Shao Kahn started his invasion of Earthrealm, he designated Motaro and his Centaurian warriors to lead his extermination squads.\n\nDesignated as the sub-boss of MK3, Motaro is by default, unplayable. However, by using a cheat code, he can be playable but cannot perform finishers. In terms of strategy, Motaro is the most over-powered character in the game: his regular punch and kick attacks does a heavy deal of damage, projectile attacks launched against him will reflect back to the attacker by default (projectile trapping moves such as Smoke’s spear and Cyrax’s green net simply passes through him), he can launch fireballs from his tail which causes an explosion knocking the opponent off their feet, he can also use his tail as a long-range sweep attack, he is capable of teleportation and his grab special move where he grabs his opponent and delivers a huge blow sending them across the screen – all these elements make him the most brutal and difficult character to fight with.\n\nMK3 became a huge success with fans. However, both fans and critics soon pointed out that the iconic masked ninja characters are obviously missing in the game. To rectify this concern, the developers decided to update the game, leading to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (UMK3). John Turk, who originally portrayed the MK3 characters Sub-Zero and Shang Tsung, was hired to the play the masked ninja characters for UMK3. From the MK2 design of the ninja costume, while the black, hooded, body suit was retained, the colored garb was made thinner and divided into segments, on a field of black, the front loincloth flap was also made thinner, the back flap was replaced with a colored area on the body suit, the arm guards are now designed with color and the colored shin guards were retained. These ninja roles include the classic favorites: Scorpion, Reptile and Classic Sub-Zero, previously unplayable characters: Human Smoke and Noob Saibot, and new characters: Ermac, Rain and Chameleon.\n\nScorpion’s story in UMK3 began when Shao Kahn invaded Earthrealm. Aside from Earthrealm, Shao Kahn also wanted to invade the Earth’s Netherrealm, where Scorpion resided. As Shao Kahn tried stealing Netherrealm souls, Scorpion was able to escape and is able to roam Earth once again. He was then enlisted by Shao Kahn to vanquish the remaining Earthrealm warriors. Scorpion retained his signature moves, the spear and teleport punch, as well as his trademark finisher, the “toasty”. In this installment, he now uses an axe during his combo attacks and gains a new finisher where he teleports himself and his opponent into the Netherrealm (which is a playable stage) and his opponents burns to death in the fiery pit. This was further updated wherein as they are teleported to the Netherrealm, multiple clones of Scorpion appear and attack the opponent as the screen fades to black.\n\nIn UMK3, Reptile continued serving his Outworld masters, Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn. After Kitana escaped Shao Kahn’s clutches before his Earthrealm invasion, Reptile was assigned to capture Kitana and stop her renegade actions at all costs. Reptile complies with the hopes that his masters would grant his request to resurrect his now-extinct species. For his moves list, Reptile retains his signature moves – acid spit, force ball and invisibility. His original fatality was updated where aside from devouring his opponents head, he also devours his opponent into sections, leaving only the legs. He also gains a new fatality where he vomits out a huge amount of acid towards the opponent, melting their flesh.\n\nThe UMK3 appearances of the classic Sub-Zero and human Smoke are actually non-canon. The first Sub-Zero was killed by Scorpion during the first Mortal Kombat while Smoke was already converted into a cyborg form by the time of MK3. They were simply added to the roster so players are able to play their UMK3 appearance. Human Smoke’s move list is exactly the same with Scorpion’s. His unique fatality, which was introduced in MK Trilogy, involves him becoming invisible and possessing his opponents causing both of them to explode. Classic Sub-Zero retains his MK2 move list and his spine rip fatality from the first game but for some reason the actual finisher was not shown as the screen faded to black. However, he gains a new fatality where he uppercuts the opponent into the air as he conjures a giant ice spike to which the opponent falls.\n\nNoob Saibot, who was an unplayable secret character in MK2, makes his playable debut in UMK3. His unusual name is derived from the surnames of the developers, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards. His story reveals that he was the original Sub-Zero from the first game. After he was killed by Scorpion, he ended up as a wraith in the Earth’s Netherrealm. During this time, he belonged to a group called the Brotherhood of the Shadow, who served a fallen elder god. He was then assigned to secretly observe the events in MK2 and by UMK3, was tasked to side the Shao Kahn and assist in his invasion of Earthrealm. Noob Saibot is probably one of the most over-powered regular characters basing from his moves list: he can produce a shadow clone of himself that will run towards the opponent and throw them to his direction, he has a teleport slam where he teleports from above, reappearing at the opponent’s opposite side from below, grabbing them and slamming them to the ground. His most unique and effective move is the disabler, a projectile attack where he launches a dark cloud at the opponent and with a successful hit, the opponent will be unable to perform attacks or blockings for a limited time. For his fatality, he performs his teleport slam move and slams his opponent multiple times until they explode.\n\nWe are now introduced to a new ninja character, Ermac whose costume was digitally altered to red and skin was darkened. Ermac’s story reveals that he is actually a being comprised of the souls of vanquished Outworld warriors collected by Shao Kahn. This new being is now tasked to aid Shao Kahn and his forces in his invasion of Earthrealm. For his move list, he has a projectile where he launches a green fireball (similar to Shao Kahn’s), a teleport punch similar to Scorpion and his trademark move, the telekinetic slam, in which with invisible telekinetic force, he slams the opponent to the ground, to be bounced towards him. His fatality is an upgrade of his telekinetic slam move where he causes his opponent to slam to the ground multiple times until they explode.\n\nAnother new ninja character is the purple-clad Rain. Rain originally hails from Edenia, the realm which was originally ruled by King Jerrod and Queen Sindel before it was merged with Outworld by Shao Kahn. Rain eventually became a member of Shao Kahn’s minions, choosing to betray his homeland rather than to suffer at the hands of Shao Kahn. Rains attacks are basically composed of a projectile where he launches a water ball and with a successful hit, the opponent is left stunned and is being floated towards his direction, and a lighting summon attack that bounces his opponent off the ground and into mid-air. Rain is also the only regular character whose roundhouse kick will cause their opponent to actually cross the other side of the screen towards his opposite direction (this move doesn’t work on sub-bosses and Shao Kahn). For his fatality, Rain summons several lightning bolts towards the opponent causing them to explode.\n\nThe final ninja character derived from this template is Chameleon. Chameleon was a secret character and was playable in UMK3 via a cheat code. He was simply introduced as one of Shao Kahn’s deadliest warriors. What’s unique about Chameleon is that his costume color consistently changes, which will reflect the move list and finishers of the ninja he is mimicking at the moment. Using him as a character requires the general techniques learned from the regular male ninja characters.\n\nUMK3 also marks the return of the female ninja characters, Kitana and Mileena. Widely considered as huge favorites back in MK2, their return in UMK3 was greatly appreciated. However, this time around, the secret unplayable female ninja from MK2, Jade, makes her playable debut. The new actor to join the crew is Rebecca “Becky” Gable, a professional model and has experience in ballet and jazz dance. She was hired for the role after Katalin Zamiar, the original portrayer, separated with Midway. The costume used is an update of the original; the leotard is now cut in a more revealing fashion with a huge slit made in the upper portion and is closed by black strings, the upper part is the majority-colored area while the bottom part is black. This time, the leggings are now thigh-high, the gloves are shorter, with black bands placed on arms and forearms. The colored mask was retained but the hairstyle is now styled into a neat bun. This template was used for a fourth palette swap, a new character, Khameleon, who uses a grayish-green color scheme and is presented with a transparent effect.\n\nIt was revealed that after MK2, Kitana murdered Mileena and was accused of treason by the high courts of Outworld. Kitana was able to escape from Outworld to Earthrealm but Shao Kahn soon sent a group of warriors to capture her. With Shao Kahn’s ongoing invasion of Earthrealm, Kitana soon discovers that her deceased mother, Sindel, has been resurrected by Shao Kahn in a brainwashed state. Kitana must find a way to reunite with Sindel and warn her of their true past. As for Mileena, she was resurrected by Shao Kahn himself to assist him in tracking down Kitana. Apparently, Mileena has the ability to read Kitana’s thoughts which will be useful in her capture. Jade was one of the warriors appointed by Shao Kahn to track and capture Kitana. It was revealed that both Jade and Kitana were close friends, as they are both Edenian and with the task assigned to her, Jade is torn between betraying Kitana or disobeying Shao Kahn. As for Khamleon’s story, it was revealed that she belongs to Reptile’s supposedly extinct species. She chose to remain hidden in the shadows, finding the perfect opportunity to assassinate Shao Kahn as vengeance for driving her species to extinction.\n\nIn discussing their move lists, Kitana and Mileena retain all of their classic weapons and moves from MK2. For their finishers, Kitana retains her classic fan decapitation and kiss of death while for Mileena, she retains her infamous maneater fatality. Additionally, in this installment, Kitana and Mileena can use their weapons during combo attacks. As for Jade, she was given a different move set and weapons: for her projectile, she launches a purple razor boomerang, where depending on the input, can go upwards, straight, downwards or even returning back to her direction, she has the nitro kick where she turns smoking green, performing a dash kick towards the opponent, knocking them off their feet and her most effective move, invincibility, where for a second, Jade glows with blinding light, causing all projectile attacks to simply pass through her. She uses her trademark weapon, the staff, in her attack combos, throw attack and finishers. Khameleon’s gameplay is similar to Chameleon, where she will mimic the move list of Kitana, Mileena or Jade based on the random stance during the battle.\n\nAfter the success of UMK3, the developers decided to create the final update to the MK3 game which was Mortal Kombat Trilogy. This update would include all character designs presented ever since the first game. This included the previous portrayals of the actors who maintained relationship with Midway like Richard DiVizio (MK1 Kano and MK2 Baraka), Anthony Marquez (MK2 Kung Lao), John Parrish (MK2 Jax) and Carlos Pesina (MK1 and MK2 Rayden). However, the only character that has yet to be recreated was Johnny Cage. With Daniel Pesina, the original portrayer of Johnny Cage, already separated ways with Midway, the developers hired Christopher “Chris” Alexander, a professional model and a college football player, for the role. The costume used was almost the same as the previous one used in MK2 – black athletic pants, blue belt and shin guards. The shoes are now colored black while the wristbands were replaced by forearm-length gloves. Additionally, Johnny now wears his sunglasses throughout the game, even during battles.\n\nFor his storyline, it was revealed that during Shao Kahn’s invasion of Earthrealm, Johnny was one of the many victims killed by extermination squads led by Motaro. However, the merger between Earthrealm and Outword prevented Johnny’s soul to ascend to the afterlife. His soul once again takes possession of his body, becoming a chosen warrior and teams up with the other Earthrealm warriors to defeat Shao Kahn and his minions. Johnny retains his special moves from MK2, except for the infamous split punch – this move would require a different hit animation from other actors, something which was not recorded during the development of MK3 and UMK3. He gains a new fatality – the backbreaker where he lifts his opponent above his heads and crashes them onto his back, causing them to explode.\n\nDuring MK Trilogy, all playable characters had their own “versus pose” which was used during their solo introduction or during the actual versus screen. However, with the re-use of MK1 and MK2 sprites of Rayden and Baraka, a versus pose for the said characters needed to be done. To achieve this, Rich DiVizio, who originally played Baraka in MK2, had to don the Baraka costume and mask once again. While for Rayden, the original actor, Carlos Pesina, was unavailable at the time and hence, the ever-available and reliable Sal DiVita took over.\n\nHere are some additional behind the scenes/live action shots:\n\nSo that’s it! That concludes the actors who portrayed our all time favorite digitized chracters in the first 3 Mortal Kombat games. This post brought back to me a lot of 90’s nostalgia and Mortal Kombat was my favorite video game at that time.\n\nTo the producers, developers and actors involved in these games, thank you so much for making my childhood awesome!!!\n\n*NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED*\n\nWelcome back to my blog! Let’s continue on with my tribute to the actors of the Mortal Kombat game. With the massive success of the first game, the development team and the producers completed the second installment in 1993. With new improvements to the game, new default and hidden characters, deeper storylines, new finishers (an additional fatality, friendship and babality) and brand-new stages, Mortal Kombat II surely did not disappoint and further enhanced its legacy in video games.\n\n<MAJOR SPOILER ALERT BELOW>\n\nDaniel Pesina reprises his role as the Hollywood actor/martial artist, Johnny Cage. He also continued directing choreography and assistance for the other actors involved. With Johnny Cage becoming a household name among video game enthusiasts, Johnny’s costume soon departed from its original concept based from Bloodsport; his new costume now consists of black athletic pants, white rubber shoes, blue belt, leg guards and wrist guards. In his versus screen pose, he also appears with a blue and dark orange leather jacket and his most iconic item – the sunglasses – which he wears during in his victory pose.\n\nFor his in-game story, Johnny became acquainted with Liu Kang from the first tournament. After learning that Liu Kang has ventured to Outworld to seek revenge against the warriors who massacred his Shaolin brothers, Johnny followed him, seeking adventure and inspiration for a new movie.\n\nThis time around, Johnny has been given a new special move, the shadow uppercut and an additional fatality – the torso rip. To add more to his Hollywood celebrity persona, Johnny’s friendship finisher is probably the most iconic among all characters – he pulls out a photograph of him, signs his autograph and is shown towards the actual players (kinda breaking the fourth wall).\n\nDaniel Pesina also reprises the ninja-inspired roles of Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Although the costume used was virtually the same, a few modifications were made: the hood became tighter, the face mask was redesigned and knee guards were added. Additionally, Scorpion’s eyes were digitally edited to become pupilless – a nod to his undead status.\n\nFor their in-game story, Scorpion finally avenges his death by killing Sub-Zero in battle. After the second Mortal Kombat tournament has been announced, the Lin Kuei Clan became aware that Shang Tsung was still alive and that Sub-Zero was probably killed during the first tournament. Thus, they sent Sub-Zero’s younger brother (also codenamed Sub-Zero) to accomplish the mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. Scorpion learns of this new Sub-Zero and stalks him into the tournament. As for their iconic fatality finishers, Scorpion retains his “toasty” finisher while for Sub-Zero, he freezes his opponent using his deep freeze move, approaches the opponent and performs an uppercut that crashes his opponents into pieces.\n\nReptile, who was a hidden character back in the first game, becomes a playable character in this installment. This time, however, he has his own exclusive moves – acid spit, force ball and invisibility. He’s probably the first versus fighting video game character who can render himself invisible. His story reveals that he is the personal protector of Shang Tsung and while appearing to be human, Reptile actually belongs to a species of reptilian-like creatures from Outworld. This is evident during his fatality where he reveals his reptilian head, lashes out his long tongue and devours his opponent’s head.\n\nThe producers then decided to make two additional palette swap Ninja characters: Smoke, clad in gray color with puffs of smoke emitting from his body, and Noob Saibot, who is clad entirely in black that he resembles a faceless shadow. They were both introduced as secret unplayable characters, each with a different requirement in order to fight them. Additionally, in the Living Forest stage, Smoke would randomly peek out from a tree making his presence felt. When it comes to special moves, they both inherit Scorpion’s spear.\n\nAnother actor who reprises his previous role is Carlos Pesina, portraying Rayden. He retains his original costume from the first game but this time, he now wears an outer garb which was digitally edited to appear blue, black forearm guards and Chinese symbols on both arms meaning “thunder” and “lightning”.\n\nIn game, witnessing the events from the heavens, the Thunder god realizes the evil intentions of Shang Tsung and the Outworld emperor, Shao Kahn, for hosting the second Mortal Kombat tournament. Rayden once again assumes a human form and ventures to Outworld to stop both Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn.\n\nRayden maintained his favorite status among the gaming community and was given a new special move, the electric shock, where he grabs his opponent and electrocutes them; this special move was extended to become his iconic fatality where he electrocutes his opponent until they explode.\n\nAlso making a return is Ho-Sung Pak, reprising his role as Liu Kang. Liu Kang’s costume for this installment has improved a lot – his pants are now colored black and red, he gains studded forearm guards and now wears a red cloth headband. His new costume was a huge departure from being a Bruce Lee clone and in my opinion, this costume really gives Liu Kang his own identity.\n\nLiu Kang defeats Shang Tsung during the first tournament and decides to go home to his Shaolin temples and brothers. However, upon his return, the temples were in ruins and his Shaolin brothers massacred. He discovers that the perpetrators of the attack were Outworld warriors. Upon learning of the second Mortal Kombat tournament, Liu Kang travels to Outworld, seeking to avenge his fallen comrades.\n\nFor this installment, Liu Kang gains additional special moves – he can now execute his fireball in a crouching position and even in mid-air and his most infamous special move, the bicycle kick (not to be confused with the soccer move) where he launches himself in mid-air towards his opponent and repeatedly kicks them with his feet alternately, all while screaming a Kung Fu gibberish. Despite retaining his “peaceful” uppercut fatality, Liu Kang gains a new fatality finisher where he transforms into a green mythical Chinese dragon and devours the upper half of his opponent.\n\nOur last returning actor is Richard DiVizio. In the first game, he portrayed Kano, but for Mortal Kombat 2, he portrays a new character, Baraka. Baraka was designed for the game to have an outlandish, savage-looking, mutant-like fighter. To achieve this, the producers made Rich wore a tight, Nosferatu mask and attached press-on nails which were painted silver as his teeth. To further enhance his monstrous appearance, Rich was also made to wear forearm gloves where long fake blades would extend out. For his attire, he wears a white, modified sleeveless Shaolin uniform with red linings, white shoes, black pants, leg guards and a metal fauld.\n\nFor Baraka’s story, he belongs to a species of mutants called Tarkatans who reside in the wastelands of Outworld. His fighting prowess gained the attention of the Outworld emperor, Shao Kahn, and was recruited in his armies. Baraka soon led the attacks towards Liu Kang’s Shaolin Temples and upon his return to Outworld, participated in the second Mortal Kombat tournament.\n\nHis special moves and finishers have a lot to do with his blades: blade spark, where he sparks his blades to form a projectile against the opponent; blade fury, where he extends his blades and moves his arms in a shredding motion; and blade decapitation fatality where he beheads his opponent with his blade.\n\nOur first new actor to join the Mortal Kombat crew is Dr. Philip Ahn, a medical doctor and a martial artist specializing in taekwondo. Phillip is a friend of Ho-Sung Pak and was invited to work out in the same athletic club as Daniel Pesina. He eventually became friends with Danny and was introduced to Ed Boon and John Tobias. Impressing the MK crew with his martial arts skills, Phillip was soon recruited to play the youth-restored Shang Tsung. For Mortal Kombat II, the developers made Shang Tsung a playable character, thus the overall design change from a robed, elderly sorcerer to an athletic, youthful fighter. For his costume, Phillip wore black Kung Fu pants, Kung Fu shoes, black and yellow garb exposing his chest and arms, yellow forearm and leg guards and a black Mandarin hat. His eyes were digitally altered to appear pupilless. Also, since Phillip cannot naturally grow a goatee facial hair, his in-game images were digitally altered to make him appear having a goatee.\n\nFor his story, Shang Tsung lost control of the Mortal Kombat tournament after being defeated by Liu Kang. Facing his master, the Outworld emperor Shao Kahn, Shang Tsung was sentenced to execution for his failure. However, he was able to convince Shao Kahn to spare his life after proposing a plan to hold another tournament in Outworld. By this, he plans to lure Earthrealm warriors to Outworld where they would have to eventually face Shao Kahn himself. Shao Kahn restores Shang Tsung’s youth and sees their plan go into motion.\n\nShang Tsung is designated as the antepenultimate boss. For his move list, he retains his flaming skulls projectile and his ability to morph into other playable characters and execute their own special moves. He is notably the only character who has a total of 3 fatality finishers. For his most iconic fatality, Shang Tsung grabs his opponent and steals their soul, leaving the body in a decomposed state. His second fatality involves him magically zooming into the opponent’s ear and as he reverts to his original size inside the opponent’s body, causes the opponent to explode into pieces. In his third fatality, he morphs into Kintaro, the Shokan sub-boss of the MK2, and brutally punches the opponent, knocking off the opponent’s upper body.\n\nAnother new actor joining the Mortal Kombat crew is Anthony “Tony” Marquez. Anthony is a karate and Wushu expert and is childhood friends with the Pesina brothers, Ho-Sung Pak and Richard DiVizio. His other credits include performing stunts and soldier roles in the film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III. For the role of Kung Lao, the idea came up that another Shaolin fighter will be added to the Mortal Kombat character roster and thus, Daniel Pesina recruited Anthony specifically for the role. Lead designer John Tobias initially thought that Anthony was too small and skinny for the role so Anthony focused on his weight training regime for four weeks and was soon eventually cast for the role of Kung Lao. His costume consisted of a dark blue sleeveless Shaolin uniform topped with a black, sleeveless garb with a red Chinese character, “Wu” which means military/warrior/martial arts. He also wears silver forearm guards, black kung fu shoes, leg guards and his most iconic item, the black hat with a razor-brimmed effect.\n\nKung Lao’s story reveals that he was a former Shaolin monk together with Liu Kang. A member of the White Lotus Society, he is the last descendant of the Great Kung Lao, the legendary Shaolin monk and previous Mortal Kombat champion, until defeated by the Shokan prince, Goro. After the attack on their Shaoilin brothers by Outworld warriors, Kung Lao joins Liu Kang in venturing Outworld to avenge their fallen comrades.\n\nDespite being both Shaolin fighters, Kung Lao’s move list is extremely different from Liu Kang’s: he has a projectile move where he throws his hat in a horizontal motion towards the opponent (the player can control the hat’s motion, either going straight, upper or lower; his hat will magically reappear on top of his head); a whirlwind spin move where he spins arounds in a fixed position and if the opponent comes close to his spin, will get hit; and a teleport move where he jumps above the screen to reappear jumping at the opponent’s opposite side from below the screen. His fatalities are related to his hat weapon: he performs his same hat throw move to decapitate his opponent or he slashes his opponent with his hat literally cutting the opponent in half.\n\nThe next new joiner in the list is Katalin Rodriguez Zamiar. Credited as “Katalin Zamiar”, she was at the time, a graduate student and a forensic science instructor holding a degree in anthropology. For her martial arts credentials, she practices karate and Okinawan-style martial arts, specializing in Sai and is also proficient handling the war fan. She was recruited by Danny Pesina for the female ninja roles of Kitana and Mileena. Lead designer John Tobias wanted to have female counterparts of the ninjas Scorpion and Sub-Zero who would have a rivalry of their own. Katalin’s costume consisted of a dark blue, sleeveless leotard, long forearm gloves, knee-high boots and a ninja face mask that only exposes her eyes and a black sash belt. The default dark blue color was used for Kitana’s costume, while for Mileena, the color was digitally edited to purple. They are further distinguished by their weapons of choice; Kitana is armed with a pair of steel-effect war fans while Mileena utilizes a pair of Sai.\n\nFor their in-game story, both Kitana and Mileena were introduced as twin sisters serving as personal assassins for Shao Kahn, the Emperor of Outworld. This turns out to be a complete façade as it was revealed that they are not in fact, twin sisters; Kitana is actually the daughter of the rightful rulers of Outworld who were overthrown by Shao Kahn while Mileena is a misshapen Tarkatan clone of her created by Shang Tsung to monitor Kitana’s every move and ensure her loyalty to Shao Kahn. During the events of the second Mortal Kombat tournament, Kitana was caught in contact with an Earthrealm warrior and Mileena was assigned to investigate on her.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, both Kitana and Milleena would become top tier characters and favorites in the game. Kitana’s special moves revolves around her war fans, using it as a projectile towards her opponent (which can also be done while in mid-air) and additionally has a unique fan lift move, that levitates her opponent above the air in a vulnerable state. Mileena, on the other hand, has her own moves differentiating her from Kitana; she has a teleport kick where she slips out of the screen downwards only to reappear upwards near the opponent performing an airborne kick, a rolling attack that knocks the opponent off their feet and a projectile move where she launches bluish energy-charged Sai against the opponent (which can also be performed in mid-air).Their fatalities are nothing short of being outrageous: Kitana’s “kiss of death” where she removes her mask to reveal her beautiful face and kisses the opponent by the cheek and causes their body to inflate until it exploded; Mileena’s “maneater” where she reveals her disfigured Tarkatan teeth and kisses the opponent by the cheek, devouring the opponent and spitting out their bones\n\nThe producers eventually made a palette swap female ninja character: Jade, digitally clad in green and altered to appear having darker skin tone. She was introduced as secret unplayable character, with a requirement in order to fight her. Jade is also in the Living Forest stage, where she would randomly peek out from a tree. She shares the same moves as Kitana (her war fans were digitally altered to appear copper-effect) but with speed quicker than most characters and invincible against projectile attacks.\n\nOur next joiner is John Parrish, a bodybuilding and weightlifting champion. Additionally, he has trained in Northern Kung Fu and has both military and gymnastics background. At the time of the release of the first MK game, John was working as trainer in the same athletic club where Daniel Pesina and most cast members trained. John became acquainted with Danny and got to play the first MK demo and joked that there are no black characters in the game. During the development of Mortal Kombat 2, the producers made a sketch of a new character and specifically recruited John for the role of Maj. Jackson “Jax” Briggs. His original costume was a yellow, sleeveless Shaolin uniform and pants. However, during actual filming, he accidentally ripped the pants. His new design consisted of black athletic pants, with red and white designs on the sides, gray utility belt and forearms guards, and black military boots.\n\nFor his story, Jax is a leader of a top US Special Forces unit. He receives a distress signal from his team member, Lt. Sonya Blade, who went missing after a mission in apprehending the criminal, Kano. Embarking on a rescue mission to save Sonya, he is led to Outworld and found Sonya captured alongside Kano, both taken captives by the Outworld Emperor, Shao Kahn. Jax must compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament in order to save Sonya.\n\nThemed as the “big strong guy” character, Jax’s move list emphasizes his brute strength and he became a favorite among players. Unlike most characters, he has 3 throw special moves: the body slam, where he grabs the opponent and slams them repeatedly on the ground; gotcha grab where he grabs the opponent by the throat and repeatedly punches the opponent’s face; and the backbreaker, an airborne grab where Jax catches the opponent mid-air and breaks their backs by dropping their head-up body towards his head. His most iconic move is ground pound, where he strikes the ground with his fist, sending a shockwave to ground-based opponents. His fatalities also reflect his superhuman strength where he either pulls off his opponent’s arms or by clapping his fists on the opponent’s head, causing it to explode.\n\nNext on the list is Brian Glynn, a competitive bodybuilder who won several championships at that time. Brian became part of the Mortal Kombat crew after he was spotted by John Parrish in a gym and was informed that the Mortal Kombat producers were looking for a very muscular guy for the role of a new villain, Shao Kahn. Brian proceeded with the audition and was cast for the role of Shao Kahn. To emphasize his impressive physique, his costume design was the probably the most revealing and detailed among the cast members: black briefs and footwear, thick body straps crossed to hold a small breastplate, spiked spaulders, spiked gauntlets, spiked knee guards, shin guards, leather loincloth and belt – all colored reddish brown, and his iconic, kabuto-style, skull helmet. His in-game sprites had to be re-sized for him to look taller and bigger than the rest of the characters.\n\nShao Kahn’s story reveals that he became the Emperor of Outworld after seizing power from its rightful rulers, the parents of Kitana. He raised Kitana as his own child and sent his lead sorcerer, Shang Tsung, to earth to conquer it by means of the winning 10 victories in the Mortal Kombat tournament. However, Shang Tsung failed to win the 10th victory. Upon his return to Outworld, Shang Tsung convinced Shao Kahn to spare his life and planned to hold another tournament in Outworld where the Earthrealm warriors would surely face Shao Kahn.\n\nShao Kahn was the final boss in the game and was unplayable. Unlike most characters, he has no jump/aerial moves. However, his punch and kick attacks cause more damage than the regular characters. His special moves consist of a green projectile arrow and a ground dash attack. He usually performs taunts during battles, allowing the player to get a free hit at him. Overall, in both design and presentation, he definitely became a memorable villain to the gaming community.\n\nThe MK developers wanted to introduce a playable anthropomorphic tiger-themed fighter for MK2. However, because of the foreseen difficulty of a capturing a fur-lined costume in motion, the concept was revamped. This new concept led to a huge, four-armed sub-boss just like Goro from the first game and we are introduced to Kintaro. The stop-motion figure used for Kintaro was sculpted by Curt Chiarelli, who was the same artist behind the Goro figure used in the first game. Just like his predecessor, Kintaro was sculpted with a very muscular physique, 4 arms each with 3 huge fingers and wears white leg wraps, a black loincloth, with a red sash belt with a Yin and Yang symbol. He was further designed with a receding hairline, full beard, knee guards, wrist guards, spiked spaulders and body straps crossed to hold a small breastplate. To further differentiate him from Goro, the entire back of his body was designed with tiger stripes – a nod to the supposed, original concept.\n\nFor his story, Kintaro was a comrade of Goro who are both of the Shokan race. Upon hearing of Goro’s defeat at the hands of Liu Kang, Kintaro joins Shao Kahn’s armies during the second Mortal Kombat tournament to avenge Goro.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Kintaro was designated as a sub-boss before fighting Shao Kahn and was unplayable. Like Goro and Shao Kahn, Kintaro performs taunts during battles that allows the player to get a free hit at him. His moves are more powerful and flexible than Goro’s: he can jump towards opponents, his uppercut usually send the opponent flying past the screen before falling to the ground, a teleport stomp that inflicts huge damage towards the opponent and his ability to grab an opponent mid-air and throw them on the ground. His brutal moves made him notorious among gamers as one of the most difficult MK bosses.\n\nWhile not as visible than the actors who played the main characters, some supporting cast members’ appearances were contributed to development of the storylines. We know that Daniel Pesina played Sub-Zero but for Sub-Zero’s ending where he removes his mask, the MK developers used the face of Joshua Tsui. Fondly called “Josh”, he was a new employee at Midway during that time and the developers immediately needed an Asian male to be used as the face of Sub-Zero. Since he was the only Asian male at the moment, he was roped in for this sole purpose. Additionally, the images of Richard DiVizio and Elizabeth Malecki as Kano and Sonya, respectively, were re-used in both the Kahn’s Arena stage where they were held captives and in Jax’s ending where Sonya was rescued and Kano was able to escape arrest. As for the playable absence of their characters, the producers explained that Kano and Sonya were the least popular of the initial seven playable characters from the first game hence they were dropped in the second game to make way for new characters.\n\nSo there, the second batch of actors/characters in the MK games. Here are some additional behind the scenes/live action shots:"
