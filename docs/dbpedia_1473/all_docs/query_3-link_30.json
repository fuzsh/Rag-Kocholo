        "text": "In the history of Flesh and Blood, there's not been a hero more polarizing than Kano. Some players overly prepare for the match, while I've heard other players say they can concede and get a 50 minute break. You would think a hero that's been around for at least 4 years has been figured out by now, but Wizards continue to confound.\n\nAll classes play their own game. Warriors usually hits with weapons. Rangers fire arrows from arsenal. Runeblades have a delicate dance of sequencing different actions. Wizard is no exception here. The difference is the game they're playing requires a reframing of the game's mechanics.\n\nHere, we'll take a dive into what makes Kano tick, so the next time you face a Kano, you'll have just a little more information and how to get through it!\n\nLet's start with defense. For anyone new to the concept, Arcane Barrier is how we “block” arcane damage - the most common being Nullrune equipment. It acts as a replacement effect which prevents the damage you would be dealt by the source in question. Your pitch is the key to utilizing this efficiently. Each Arcane Barrier can block 1 from a single source. If you are playing against a class like Runeblade, then Arcane Barrier 1 (AB1) should be sufficient to your needs. If multiple sources are dealing one arcane damage each to you then you only need AB1. If a single source of damage would deal 2 arcane, then you need AB2. You might find it helpful to conceptualize arcane damage from a single source as having dominate. The more AB you have, the more you can block from a single source.\n\nIf you are running a deck with all reds, AB3 will likely be too much. You'll spend just short of your hand to block any source of 3 damage. In this instance, you may consider (and test) your chances at racing Kano. He may still get an amazing draw and win the game, but this is the exception and not the rule.\n\nAB2 can be plenty, but so can AB1. Prism will usually only run AB1 against Kano. This is effective for her because her angels all have Ward 4 when they are not in figment form. Boltyn will usually run mostly yellow cards, therefore anything higher than AB2 may not be healthy for him to run.\n\nIf you are running a deck full of blue cards then AB3 might be the way to go. There are reasons not to go beyond AB3. On a standard turn, Kano sends a red Aether Spindle at you for 5 damage. To prevent 4 damage, you would be getting rid of 2 cards. This will likely leave you with 2 cards left, making the Kano's math a little easier if he needs to respond on your turn. There are a few cases where AB4 can be useful. Playing Dash I/O, I want to feel comfortable breaking one of my pieces with Arcane Barrier if needed.\n\nAs a standard, I wouldn't pitch more than 1 card unless you had reason to. As for when to pitch and not to pitch? We'll cover that soon."
