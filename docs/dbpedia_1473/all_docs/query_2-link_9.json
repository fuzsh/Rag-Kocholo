        "text": "Page 122 →Page 123 →Notes\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. Wherever relevant or not immediately apparent from context, I have cited the home country of game studios upon their first mention, using the familiar abbreviations JP (Japan), U.S. (United States), and U.K. (United Kingdom). I have also used the North American names for game consoles, such as SEGA “Genesis” instead of SEGA “MegaDrive.”\n\n2. See Bogost 2015; Sharp 2015; and Parker 2018.\n\n3. My discussion here is rooted primarily in the U.S. context, given how arcades in East Asia tend to have a more socially “wholesome” image (see Ashcraft and Snow 2008), helped in part by the relative absence of gore in most Japanese games—a cultural difference that the Mortal Kombat series exploited as a means of product differentiation.\n\nChapter 1\n\n1. Note that the generic terms “fighting” and “beat-em-up” are still sometimes used interchangeably, especially in British game criticism. For the sake of clarity, however, I will distinguish between these two varieties of hand-to-hand combat games.\n\n2. Also see Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc. 862 F.2d 204, 9 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1322 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n3. To overcome such imbalances in two-player competition, the second player to select their avatar might deliberately “counter-pick” a character whose own weaknesses will help rebalance the upcoming match (Harper 2014, 61). To help with this issue, Mortal Kombat II also introduced a “Random Select” function, which allows players to defer to serendipity instead of counter-strategize—a very popular option among arcade players already skilled enough to use any character (“Special . . . Kombat II” 1994, Electronic, 114).\n\nPage 124 →4. According to programmer Ed Boon, MKI was affected by similar imbalances, with Sub-Zero’s moves considerably stronger than the other characters (LaMancha 1994, 35).\n\n5. See “Fighter’s History” 1994, 120; “Letter of the Month” 1994, 14; and Capcom U.S.A., Inc. v. Data East Corp., 1994 WL 1751482 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 1994).\n\n6. On the cognitive/embodied experience of “force transfer” in hand-to-hand combat games, also see Gregersen 2016, 53–70.\n\n7. Although not entirely identical, also see the character tier provided in Cureton 1994, 69.\n\n8. Franchise crossover games would, however, be created by each company separately (see chapter 4), using licensing deals with the major American comics firms, including X-Men vs. Street Fighter (Capcom, 1996) and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (Midway, 2008).\n\n9. Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol (1897–1962) was a Parisian theater specializing in realistic depictions of graphic violence and gore—often presented in a morbidly tongue-in-cheek tone—and has been credited as an influence on gory horror films, especially via the generic influence of Herschell Gordon Lewis.\n\n10. Capcom would later introduce Akuma, a hidden playable character in Super Street Fighter II Turbo (1994), unlockable via a combination of carefully timed button presses on the Character Select screen—as if both acknowledging the earlier Sheng Long mishap and taking inspiration from Midway’s own introduction of secret characters.\n\n11. The purple-attired character Rain would originate in a similar manner as a Prince-themed in-joke by Ed Boon, briefly seen during a flash of demo gameplay in the “attract mode” of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (Midway, 1995), and was later made a playable character in subsequent games.\n\n12. Also see the respective pages for the Mortal Kombat games on the Cutting Room Floor website (n.d.). Other major Easter eggs, such as Boon’s separate diagnostic menus for the first three coin-op games, would not be discovered until as late as 2015.\n\n13. For MKII, Tobias initially wished to digitize real-life kickboxer Kathy Long as a character, but this idea was dropped due to time constraints (Quan 1994b, 29).\n\n14. Wrestling games are already generically closer in spirit to fighting games than boxing games, since they typically rely on theatrical personas with signature moves, health meters to mark character strength, and so on. In its incorporation of foreign objects to be used as optional weapons, such as pool cues and crates, Pit-Fighter more closely resembles a wrestling game than a fighting game in many respects.\n\n15. See Ahn, et al. v. Midway Manufacturing Company, et al., 965 F. Supp 1134 (N.D. Ill. 1997); and Pesina v. Midway Manufacturing Company, et al., 948 F. Supp. 40 (N.D. Ill. 1996).\n\n16. Ahn, et al. v. Midway, et al.\n\nChapter 2\n\n1. Tobias had originally planned for Total Carnage to feature a backstory “involv[ing] the world being invaded by ghouls from a dimension called Outworld,” Page 125 →but the game’s cocreator, Mark Turmell, vetoed the inclusion of unnecessary themes and storylines (Ali 2019, 62).\n\n2. As one of the first 3D fighting games (and a Mortal Kombat competitor), Tekken (Bandai Namco [JP], 1994–) provided a fitting “extra dimension” to its gameplay by developing the increasingly complex story of the Mishima family across its many popular sequels. The Tekken series, then, is a prominent exception to the fighting game’s oft-criticized lack of narrative depth, much as it also represents an attempt to reassert Japanese dominance over the mid-1990s coin-op market.\n\n3. On the grindhouse market, see Church 2015, and for a sample of such double bills circa 1974–75, see Cope 1975. Also see Prashad 2001 and Bowman 2021 on this period.\n\n4. Note that the pinyin term gong fu roughly translates as “hard work/practice over time” and can refer to any gradually acquired skill, not specifically martial arts, whereas wushu actually translates as “martial art.” By the 1960s–70s, however, these meanings were effectively reversed once wushu was reconceived as a noncombative gymnastic sport and “kung fu” became internationally associated with empty-handed martial artistry. In this chapter, I use the latter-day associations of these two terms for the sake of consistency with common usage.\n\n5. Given the basis of the lawsuits that some of these original actors would later file against Midway, it is perhaps no surprise that today they claim a considerable amount of creative input, even if not enough to legally qualify them as joint authors. On the issue of authorship, it is also notable that Japanese character names and cultural allusions (such as the blind swordsman Kenshi as a Zatoichi trope) would significantly increase in the Mortal Kombat games made after Tobias left Midway in 1999.\n\n6. According to Daniel Pesina, additional inspiration for Johnny Cage and Jax respectively came from Marvel’s characters Iron Fist and Power Man, whose own comics series ran concurrently with Master of Kung Fu (Myers 2018).\n\n7. The documentary Bruce Lee: A Warrior’s Journey (John Little, 2000) reconstructs as much of Lee’s vision for Game of Death as possible from the extant footage.\n\n8. Konami’s controversial rail-shooter Lethal Enforcers, discussed in the following chapter, would include a level set in Chicago’s Chinatown, featuring stereotypically attired Chinese villains (see fig. 15).\n\n9. On such diasporic video stores, see Hilderbrand 2009, 27–32.\n\n10. Dux’s story was later called into question in Johnson 1988. This has led to several ensuing decades of counterarguments over the veracity of Dux’s account, though my primary interest here is in how Bloodsport dramatized the story as a Van Damme vehicle. According to Dux’s original account, for example, despite fighting until knockouts, there were no deaths at the actual Kumite, nor were betting spectators allowed.\n\n11. On hardbody films, also see Jeffords 1993; Tasker 1993; and Ayers 2008.\n\n12. Notably, Provenzo’s research does not specify the exact game being described here, but it is likely either Ninja Gaiden (Tecmo, 1988), Double Dragon, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Konami, 1989) for the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System—all of them, ironically, Japanese productions—and not one of the Mortal Kombat games.\n\n13. On the tradition of “alternative blood” to evade censorship, also see Kocurek 2015b. This form of localization could operate in the opposite direction, however, Page 126 →with the Japanese-designed Bushido Blade featuring a splash of red blood upon fatal sword strikes in the American version, in place of the yellow flash in the original Japanese version.\n\n14. This same toxic masculinity often overlaps with the aforementioned white supremacism expressed by a contingent of gamers fearing that their bubble of ludic escapism is being threatened by racial/sexual minorities (see Nakamura 2019).\n\n15. American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\nChapter 3\n\n1. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495 (1952). Film distributor Joseph Burstyn legally challenged the New York State Board of Regents’ 1951 ban of Roberto Rossellini’s film The Miracle (1948), which had been accused of sacrilege. The U.S. Supreme Court’s “Miracle decision” in Burstyn’s favor, which struck down the ban, also reversed an earlier 1915 ruling that had declared motion pictures unprotected by the First Amendment.\n\n2. Coin-op gamers of the early 1990s will recall, however, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s insertion of antidrug messages (“Winners Don’t Use Drugs”) into the attract mode for many games, apparently convinced that idle youth were as likely to reach for a crack pipe as a joystick.\n\n3. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283 (102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152) (1982).\n\n4. During the same period, Midway/Williams developed the Williams Action Video Entertainment Network (or “WaveNet”), an attempt to remotely network arcade machines for competitive play via an ISDN connection. Although installation costs for these ISDN connections might have put off some arcade owners, Williams hoped that their widespread adoption would revolutionize the coin-op industry’s business model by allowing companies like Williams to remotely disseminate new software and updates for free, in exchange for a share of each arcade’s revenue on those games. In April 1996, Williams began field-testing WaveNet on ten Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 cabinets in the Chicago area, but this early experiment with networked gaming was short-lived, and its ambitious revenue-sharing model did not come to pass (Webb 1996, 18).\n\n5. Its sequel, Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters (Konami, 1994), in fact, uses an Old West setting instead.\n\n6. The Options menu on the SNES prototype even included a selection between “Bloody” and “Bloodless” game modes, but it is unclear if this was to be a standard menu option or unlockable only with a code.\n\n7. The ESRB ratings include E (Everyone), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), and AO (Adults Only 18+).\n\n8. For example, MKI was banned and confiscated in Germany in 1994 under a Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons law against content that glorifies or trivializes violence.\n\n9. For overviews of these debates, see Sicart 2009; Egenfeldt-Nielsen, Smith, and Tosca 2013, 255–79; Schott 2016; Markey and Ferguson 2017.\n\nPage 127 →10. However, they do allow that players with preexisting dispositions toward aggression were more intrigued by violent game content for its own sake, even if that violent content still did not correlate with their overall enjoyment of the games themselves.\n\n11. Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011).\n\nChapter 4\n\n1. Time Killers was considered so bad that it inspired its own parody game, Timeslaughter (Bloodlust Software [U.S.], 1996); whereas reviews of Naughty Dog’s almost self-parodic Way of the Warrior noted how the Panasonic 3DO’s “beautiful” CD-based graphics did not compensate for horrible gameplay since, even with its “humor value,” the game “isn’t even good by accident!” (“Review . . . Warrior” 1994, 38).\n\n2. Emulated versions of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy would be further repackaged on Midway Arcade Treasures compilations (2004–2005) for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox, in addition to serving as unlockable hidden games within the later sequels, as if having acquired the historical status of the PONG and Galaga games hidden in the original trilogy.\n\n3. This compiled story information derives from several sources: Santoro et al. 2018; Mortal Kombat Wiki (n.d.); and Jasper 2017.\n\n4. A hyperdiegesis is “a vast and detailed narrative space, only a fraction of which is ever directly seen or encountered within the text” (Hills 2002, 104).\n\n5. Although the number of grandmothers who embraced MK: Armageddon is doubtful, Boon’s rhetoric is consistent with the Wii’s reputation as a game console adapted by “casual” gamers of many ages, as explained in Juul 2009.\n\n6. “Mokap,” a hidden character in MK: Deadly Alliance, wears a motion-capture suit covered with reflective balls, alluding to this now-common cinematic process.\n\n7. Also see In re MIDWAY GAMES INC., et al., Debtors. Threshold Entertainment, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Midway Games Inc., et al., Bankruptcy No. 09-10465, Adversary No. 09-51081 (446 B.R. 148 [2011]).\n\n8. An R18+ rating for video games would be introduced by the release of Mortal Kombat X four years later, allowing the uncensored sequel to be sold to adults.\n\n9. Mortal Kombat 11 (2019) replaces X-ray attacks with high-damage “Fatal Blow” attacks, enabled once a character’s health drops below the 30 percent mark, thus allowing a losing player to potentially turn the tables on their opponent. Meanwhile, MK11 splits the tripartite meter into separate offensive and defensive meters, giving players more strategic in-round options for how to use accumulated energy toward enhanced moves.\n\n10. A playable Scorpion, however, would be available to Injustice players as a premium download, much as NetherRealm’s Injustice 2 (2017) features Sub-Zero and Raiden as downloadable characters. Likewise, NetherRealm introduced a mobile game for iOS and Android devices in conjunction with MKX, based in purchasing and collecting a virtual card deck of fighters and their corresponding powers, which incentivizes in-game microtransactions by also unlocking content on the home console version.\n\n11.
