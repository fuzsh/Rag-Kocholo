        "text": "This thesis examines several aspects of narrative in video games, in order to construct a detailed image of the characteristics that separate video game narrative from other, noninteractive narrative forms. These findings are subsequently used to identify and define three basic models of video game narrative. Since it has also been argued that video games should not have narrative in the first place, the validity of this question is also examined. Overall, it is found that while the interactive nature of the video game does indeed cause some problems for the implementation of narrative, this relationship is not as problematic as has been claimed, and there seems to be no reason to argue that video games and narrative should be kept separate from each other. It is also found that the interactivity of the video game encourages the use of certain narrative tools while discouraging or disabling the author’s access to other options. Thus, video games in general allow for a much greater degree of subjectivity than is typical in non-interactive narrative forms. At the same time, the narrator’s ability to manipulate time within the story is restricted precisely because of this increased subjectivity. Another interesting trait of video game narrative is that it opens up the possibility of the game player sharing some of the author’s abilities as the narrator. Three models of video game narrative are suggested. These included the linear ‘string of pearls’ model, where the player is given a certain degree of freedom at certain times during the game, but ultimately still follows a linear storyline; the ‘branching narrative’ model, where the player helps define the course and ending of the story by selecting from narrative branches; and the ‘amusement park’ model, where the player is invited to put together a story out of a group of optional subplots. The existence of a fourth model, the ‘building blocks’ model, is also noted, but this model is not discussed in detail as it does not utilise any traditional narrative structure, instead allowing the players to define every aspect of the story.\n\nThis thesis explores the phenomenon of character autonomy, which I define as situations where character complexity is prominent in one or more categories while avatar control is limited or non-existent. Avatar control describes the levels of the player’s control of the avatar in a specific instance under study, while character complexity refers to how characterisation is communicated in that instance. I argue that both concepts can be measured on a four-point scale, ranging from high/full character complexity/avatar control to no character complexity/avatar control. Using the two models, I define various types of character autonomy; cutscenes, forced dialogue, quick-time events, idle animations, unwillingness, and (other) unmotivated actions. These six types are discussed in relation to the concepts of avatar and character to uncover how the two are often interrelated and thus difficult to assess as separate. Various theories from game studies (Lankoski et al, 2003; Vella, 2015), literary studies (Margolin, 1986; Forster, 1985), and transmedia studies (Bertetti, 2014) are used to explore the notion of character in video games and discuss how the model of character complexity can function with the inherent connection between avatar and character. Moreover, I discuss the various approaches to the notions of avatar (Linderoth, 2005; Klevjer, 2007; Bayliss, 2007), player character (Westecott, 2009; Lankoski, 2011), and playable figure (Vella, 2015) to outline how various terminologies are used to make sense of the subject matter, and to critically engage in a discussion of what I refer to as the trinity between player, avatar, and character. The concept of character autonomy is studied through various examples, uncovering how this can easily be mistaken for what I term automated avatar actions and define as actions which are automatically performed by the avatar promoting the player’s focus on game mechanics. Such actions, as for example the act of walking, can be understood as limitations to the player’s agency and hence her avatar control, but have formal functions that are very different from character autonomy. When studied in comparison, the two phenomena illustrate how characters in video games cannot be productively studied as characters in non-ergodic media, as an avatar is in many games necessary for playerinteraction. The avatar may have its own functions and attributes, unrelated to the character it can represent, constituting a paradoxical relationship between the two, where they cannot be studied either in isolation or as one and the same thing. I conclude by arguing that this illustrates how some core concepts such as avatar and character are not sufficiently established to ground a theory of games. Being an interdisciplinary field, game studies, including this very thesis, builds on concepts and theories from other disciplines, especially that of narratology, and while much of this work is productive and relevant for the study of digital games, we must constantly ensure that such concepts are revised as medium-specific. If not, we may easily overlook some of the intrinsic and fundamental elements of the digital, ergodic medium."
