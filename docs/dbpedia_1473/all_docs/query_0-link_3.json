Originally entering theMortal Kombat tournament to display his fighting skills and prove himself to skeptical movie critics and the movie-viewing public, who believed Cage was nothing more than an actor who relied too much on stunts and camera work and not a real proficient fighter. Eventually, Cage becomes one of the most important defenders of Earthrealm. Though he occasionally lapses into his former selfish and materialistic ways, he has always been a brave and loyal warrior for Earthrealm.\n\nGoro\n\nReal Name Goro Age 1995 Height 8′ 2″ (2.5 m) Weight 550 lbs.

He first became playable in the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat.\n\nAbout Goro\n\nHe appeared as a four-armed Shokan warrior who had been the champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament for nine generations, remaining undefeated for 500 years.\n\nGoro is among Shao Kahn‘s favorite warriors and is well known for his power and brutality. Goro helped the emperor grow closer to dominating Earthrealm, but he lost at the tenth while fighting against Liu Kang, who later defeated the sorcerer Shang Tsung.\n\nLiu Kang\n\nReal Name Liu Kang (劉鋼) Age 24 (as of MK) Height 5′ 10″ (1.78 m) Weight 185 lbs.

He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game. He serves as the main protagonist of the series and is the Grand Champion of Mortal Kombat in the first four tournaments.\n\nLiu Kang is also one of the most easily accesible characters in the series, and one of the most powerful warriors of Earthrealm, and has beaten many to prove his valor. Throughout the series, Liu Kang has been gradually portrayed as the main hero, becoming champion after the first Mortal Kombat tournament. The one character who could be considered the closest thing to a nemesis Liu Kang has is Shang Tsung, who has been repeatedly defeated in battle by the Shaolin monk. Because of this, Kang is often considered to be the biggest threat to the plans of Tsung and his emperor, Shao Kahn. He is a member of the White Lotus Society. Kang was killed by the Deadly Alliance of Tsung and Quan Chi.\n\nAbout Liu Kang\n\nIn the first few entries in the series, Liu Kang was shown to be non-violent, in that his finisher did not explicitly kill the opponent. Starting with Mortal Kombat II, however, all of his finishers involved killing the opponent in one way or another. Due to his zombie state in Mortal Kombat: Deception, he has been shown to kill hundreds of innocent people at a time although it’s not really him committing these crimes, but his body itself.\n\nKano\n\nReal Name Kano (加納) Age 35 (as of MK) Height 5′ 10″ (1.78 m) Weight 200 lbs.

He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game.\n\nAbout Kano\n\nA portion of Kano’s face is covered with a metal plate as a result of a disfiguring injury he sustained at the hands of Major Jackson Briggs prior to the events of the series, with the plated eye being a glowing red orb capable of emitting laser-like beams. Originally a mercenary and leader of the international crime cartel known as the Black Dragon he rises beyond the level of mere brutality and aggression by also being sly and cunning. It was through his resourcefulness that he convinced Shao Kahn to spare his life, and it was through ruthless ambition that he later ascended to position of general of Outworld‘s armies. Kano combines the features of a cowardly minion, a lone survivor, a crazed madman, and an intelligent commander. His actions have made him the enemy of Lt. Sonya Blade.\n\nNoob Saibot\n\nReal Name Bi-Han (璧漢) Age 32 (at death) Height 6′ 2″ (1.88 m) Weight 210 lbs (95 kg) Origin Earthrealm (China)\n\n(Reborn in the Netherrealm) Resides Netherrealm/Outworld Species Wraith (formerly Human/Cryomancer) Weapons Scythe (MK4, MKG)\n\nNinja Sword (MK:TE)\n\nTroll Hammer (MK:A) Alignment Evil (as Noob Saibot)Neutral (as Sub-Zero) Appearances As Sub-Zero\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nMK Mythologies: Sub-Zero\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nAs Noob Saibot\n\nMortal Kombat II (unplayable)\n\nMortal Kombat 3 (unplayable)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMortal Kombat 4\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMK: Tournament Edition\n\nMK: Deception\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Unchained\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nNoob Saibot, once known in life as Bi-Han (璧漢), was a Lin Kueiassassin turned wraith from the Mortal Kombat fighting games series. He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the original Mortal Kombat arcade game as Sub-Zero, older brother of the current, younger Sub-Zero. He first appeared as Noob Saibot as a secret character in Mortal Kombat II, first becoming playable in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and was a secret character in Mortal Kombat 4. He holds the unique distinction of appearing, in one form or another, as a fighter in all of the first seven main fighting games.\n\nAbout Noob Saibot\n\nReincarnated in the darkest of all realms, the Netherrealm, Noob Saibot is the very incarnation of evil. Before becoming a wraith, he was once Sub-Zero, an assassin among the most powerful of Lin Kuei. As Sub-Zero’s name, clothes, and powers would suggest, his character was icy and distant. In all aspects, he was a cold-blooded and violent assassin absolutely dedicated to his clan, the Lin Kuei. While essentially neutral, his soul had become dark and corrupted from years of violence and remorseless killing. Before his story is revealed to the player, the player can make an educated guess on who he was. He disappears after MK, and reappears in MKII reborn as Noob Saibot.\n\nWhen he died in the first Mortal Kombat tournament at the hands of Scorpion, his soul, corrupted by years of violence, descended to the Netherrealm’s Fifth Plane. The evil within his soul was released, stripping him of pride, compassion, and everything else “human.” He wishes not only to remain in the Netherrealm, but to conquer and rule it. Though he has been seen in the service of conquerors such as Shinnok and Shao Kahn, his ultimate allegiance is himself.\n\nRaiden\n\nReal Name Raiden (雷電) Age Eternal Height 6′ 7″ (2.01 m) Weight 260 lbs.

He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the firstMortal Kombat game.\n\nAbout Raiden\n\nRaiden is the eternal God of Thunder and former protector ofEarthrealm. After the second defeat of Shinnok, he ascended to the status of Elder God. Being a god, he possesses many supernatural abilities, such as the ability to teleport, control lightning and fly. As a god, he is used to thinking in terms of eternity rather than normal human lifespans, and as such he has a radically different outlook on life.\n\nReptile\n\nReal Name Reptile Age Unknown Height 6′ (1.83 m) Weight 189 lbs. Status Enforcer Origin Zaterra (Now part of Outworld) Resides Outworld Species Saurian Weapons Kunai (MK, MK 2011)\n\nBattle Axe (MK4, MKG)\n\nKirehashi (MK:DA, MK:A) Fighting Styles Hung Gar (MK:DA)\n\nCrab (MK:DA)\n\nPao Chui (MK:A) Alignment 1st Timeline: Neutral/Evil\n\n2nd Timeline: Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat (unplayable)\n\nMortal Kombat II\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMortal Kombat 4\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMK: Deadly Alliance\n\nMK: Tournament Edition\n\nMK: Deception (cameo)\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nReptile is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the originalMortal Kombat arcade game as a secret character. He then became playable in Mortal Kombat II.\n\nAbout Reptile\n\nReptile is a green garbed, human-like reptilian creature that embodies the archetype of the unhappy underling. Reptile is said to be physically hideous and repulsive, but he is renowned for his great stealth, impressive fighting skills and unquestioning loyalty. Unlike many other henchmen of the lords he has served, Reptile does not strive for power. Rather, he is caught in a delusional state of mind, an obsession about finding the last remaining member of his race, theSaurians, or freeing his homeworld from Outworld‘s grasp. Thus, he always remains loyal to Shao Kahn, only obeying other masters to survive and reach his goal of returning Zaterra to its former glory. While well-meaning and sincere, this obsession is so important to him that it causes him temporary fits of insanity.\n\nReptile was hidden in the original Mortal Kombat and thus holds the distinction of being the very first secret character to appear in a versus fighting game. Before battles with an opponent he would make his appearance and jump in the middle of the screen in a Sub-Zero win pose. Above his head would be clues on how to find him, such as “Look to la luna” (“the moon” in Spanish or Italian and hinting The Pit stage), “Alone is how to find me” (denoting that he is only unlockable in single player mode), “Perfection is the key” (directing towards the double Flawless victory), or “Tip eht fo mottob” (“Bottom of The Pit” spelled backward). This concept was then copied for Smoke and Jade in Mortal Kombat II.\n\nHe was a merge between the original Sub-Zero and Scorpion characters. Mortal Kombat co-creators John Tobiasand Ed Boon admitted in an interview that the “birth” of Reptile was when they took Sub-Zero and Scorpion and fused the two into one and colored him green (yellow + blue = green). They christened this character “Reptile” due to his green color and their reference to lizards. While he wasn’t given a lot of character depth at the time, he was worked on more (character wise) and later, in Mortal Kombat II, Reptile was developed into a full character with his own special moves and would be available from the outset.\n\nIt is not quite clear how old Reptile is. Estimates run in the tens of thousands of years or even millions. What is known, however, is that the Earthrealm was nearly destroyed by a battle between the gods millions of years ago. Reptile’s race of raptors or Saurians, escaped to another realm, Zaterra, where it was then invaded and annexed by Outworld’s emperor, Shao Kahn. As was the usual process for Kahn conquering another world, most of the Zaterrans were killed in the ensuing battles, only leaving a handful of people left. Among those, or among those descended from these survivors, was Reptile. Unlike the others of his kind, who were forced into slavery, Reptile was trained to be a servant of both Kahn and Shang Tsung.\n\nBecause of this, it is unclear exactly what Reptile’s place of birth is – although Earthrealm, Zaterra, or Outworld are the three likely choices.\n\nScorpion\n\nReal Name Hanzo Hasashi (藏半藏 Hasashi Hanzo) Age 32 (at death), (Now a Hellspawned spectre) Height 6′ 2″ (1.89 m) Weight 210 lbs. (95 kg) Origin Earthrealm, Japan\n\n(reborn in Netherrealm) Resides Netherrealm Species Wraith (formerly Human) Affiliations Shirai Ryu Weapons Kunai (All appearances)\n\nMugai Ryu (MK:D, MK:U, MK:A,MK 2011)\n\nAxe (UMK3, MKT)\n\nLong Sword (MK4, MKG)\n\nNinja Sword (MK:DA) Fighting Styles Hapkido (MK:DA, MK:D, MK:U,MK:A)\n\nMoi Fah (MK:D, MK:U)\n\nPi Gua (MK:DA) Alignment 1st Timeline: Neutral\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil (Formerly Neutral) Appearances Mortal Kombat\n\nMortal Kombat II\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMK Mythologies: Sub-Zero\n\nMortal Kombat 4\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMK: Deadly Alliance\n\nMK: Tournament Edition\n\nMK: Deception\n\nMK: Unchained\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMK vs DC Universe\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nScorpion is a resurrected ninja in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game. He holds the unique distinction, along with Raiden and Sub-Zero (in one form oranother), of appearing in every generation of Mortal Kombat games as a playable character.\n\nScorpion is one of the most popular characters in the Mortal Kombat series. In life, Scorpion was the codename for a human ninja assassin and one of the Shirai Ryu clan’s finest warriors:Hanzo Hasashi.\n\nAbout Scorpion\n\nIt is known that his father, a former member of the Shirai Ryu, forbade his son from joining the clan, as he did not wish for his son to live the life of an assassin. However, Hanzo joined in spite of his father’s wishes in order to provide his wife and son with a comfortable life.\n\nNow, Scorpion is a black and yellow garbed, hell-spawned spectre, inexorably seeking vengeance against those responsible for the destruction of his clan and the death of his own family. Despite the fact that Scorpion has previously allied himself with the forces of evil (when promised either means of resurrection on Earth or the chance to inflict his wrath against those who butchered his clan), he is not inherently evil. In fact, Scorpion has, at times, indirectly assisted the game’s protagonists, although his reasons for doing so ultimately serve to benefit his own motives.\n\nFans of the series often perceive Scorpion as the title’s foremost anti-hero, due to his tendency to undertake actions which serve to benefit good, albeit in his own gruesome, self-serving and vigilante manner. Scorpion’s demeanor, characteristics, persona and self-reliance have all contributed to his popularity, with Scorpion ironically appearing as the most human in nature and choice when compared to the purely virtuous, “good guys” and the diabolically evil, “bad guys”. Although Scorpion is featured alongside the forces of evil in the opening scene of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, he remains neutral, due to his fierce hatred of Quan Chi.\n\nWhen masked, Scorpion appears human, although this is merely an illusion. When revealing his true self, only Scorpion’s skull remains, which sometimes appears on fire. Scorpion’s most popular and recognized skill is his famous spear attack, which is used to draw an opponent toward him. This attack will also stun the opponent for a short amound of time. Scorpion will shout, “Get over here!” or “Come here!”, while executing this technique.\n\nSonya Blade\n\nReal Name Sonya Blade Age 26 (as of MK) Height 5′ 9″ (1.75 m) Weight 140 lbs.

Sonya Blade, (USA), is a female soldier who is a member of Earthrealm‘s Special Forces unit known as Outer World Investigation Agency (OIA) in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. She is one of the few original Mortal Kombat characters, debuting in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game.\n\nAbout Sonya\n\nA member of a top United States Special Forces unit, Sonya Blade is a beautiful, stern, tough-as-nails lieutenant. Her impulsiveness is catalyzed by her superior and good friend, Major Jackson “Jax” Briggs. Sonya represents a very emancipated and headstrong woman, but for all her stubbornness and pride, she deeply cares about the lives of her friends and comrades. She has a long-standing enmity with the thug, Kano, who had murdered a former partner of hers, and stands for everything Sonya despises.\n\nShang Tsung\n\nReal Name Shang Tsung (尚宗) Age Unknown (beyond 500) Height 5′ 11″ (1.8 m) Weight 210 lbs (95kg) Status Sorcerer Origin Earthrealm Resides Outworld Species Human/Sorcerer Weapons Straight Sword (MK:DA, MK:A) Fighting Styles Snake (MK:DA, MK:D, MK:A)\n\nCrane (MK:DA)\n\nMantis (MK:D), Mimics Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat (boss)\n\nMortal Kombat II\n\nMortal Kombat 3\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception(cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat\n\nMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nShang Tsung (尚宗)[1] is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He is one of the few original characters, debuting in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game, in which he served as the final boss.\n\nAbout Shang Tsung\n\nA powerful, deadly sorcerer and a primary villain in the Mortal Kombat series, Shang Tsung is a shapeshifter who needs to consume souls in order to sustain his health and life. In the Mortal Kombat series, he is the epitome of cunning and decadence, as symbolized by his preference for lavish parties, grand palaces, and stylish clothing. Unlike the crude Shao Kahn, this bombast is a facade, disguising Tsung’s true intellectual and mental sophistication. His nemesis is Liu Kang, but throughout his unnatural lifespan, he has earned the hatred of many others, including Kung Lao and Kenshi.\n\nShang Tsung’s early allegiance to Shao Kahn granted him the status of a free roaming sorcerer. As such, he is able to move between realms without detection by the Elder Gods or local deities, an ability which has granted him many opportunities to commit atrocities over the centuries. Only Delia, Shinnok, Shao Kahn, and Quan Chi can match Shang Tsung’s skills as a sorcerer.\n\nBaraka\n\nReal Name Baraka Age Unknown Height 6′ 5″ (1.96 m) Weight 280 lbs (127 kg) Status Enforcer Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Tarkatan Weapons Razor Cane (MKG)\n\nTarkatan Blades (All Series) Fighting Styles Silat (MK:D, MK:U, MK:A)\n\nHung Gar (MK:D, MK:U) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat II\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception\n\nMortal Kombat: Unchained\n\nMortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nBaraka is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series, who made his debut in Mortal Kombat II.\n\nAbout Baraka\n\nBaraka was introduced as a mean, unforgiving, and unpredictable warrior in service of the Outworld Emperor, Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat II. He belongs to a race of nomadic mutants, later revealed in Mortal Kombat: Deception to be called Tarkata, a crossbreed between vile Netherrealm demons and denizens ofOutworld, apparently populating the vast wastelands of Outworld. Like most members of his race, Baraka possesses long blades extending from his forearms. Although he has had numerous incursions with the Earthrealm warriors, he appears not to have any particular rivalry or hatred towards Earth or its inhabitants. As a loyal warrior, he fights for those whom he calls “master”.\n\nBlaze\n\nReal Name Blaze Age 1000 years (As of MK:U) Height Boss Form = 12′ (3.65 m)\n\nNormal Form = 6′ (1.82 m) Weight Boss Form = 2500 lbs (1134 kg)\n\nNormal Form = 210 lbs (95 kg) Status Guardian Origin Edenia Species Elemental Allies Argus\n\nDelia Fighting Styles Hapkido (MK:DA, MK:U)\n\nJeet Kune Do (MK:DA, MK:U)\n\nXing Yi (MK:DA, MK:U)\n\nFlames (MK:A) Alignment Neutral Appearances Mortal Kombat II (cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy (cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception (cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Unchained\n\nMortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks (cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon (playable boss)\n\nBlaze is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series who made his debut as a background character inMortal Kombat II. He made his playable debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance as a hidden character, and served as the boss of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.\n\nAbout Blaze\n\nFirst introduced in the series as a non-playable character seen in the background of the Pit II arena in Mortal Kombat II, Blaze was depicted as an elemental being from Outworld shrouded in flames.[1] As his name and appearance suggests, he has control over fire, lava, heat, etc.In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Blaze became a playable character and gained more background information. He would later become the final boss of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.\n\nBlaze’s first chronological appearance was supposedly inMortal Kombat II, visible only as a burning figure in the Pit II background, fighting a character fans have since named Hornbuckle does not come without controversy. Daegon is described in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon as being awoken centuries prematurely, due to Caro losing mental contact with Blaze (because of his imprisonment guarding the last dragon egg) and mistook that for the signal to awake Daegon. Also, in Blaze’s Armageddon Bio, Blaze is set free after the egg hatches during the events ofDeception, and is unaware that Daegon was awoken prematurely. It’s not until Blaze gives the signal to wake both brothers he learns that Daegon had already been freed. If the burning figure in Mortal Kombat II was truly Blaze, that means Blaze had been imprissoned to guard the egg sometime after Mortal Kombat II, which means Daegon could not have been awoken centuries earlier because Blaze would have known. With the Black Dragon dating back to before the first Mortal Kombat and the Red Dragon dating back beyond that, it seems the burning figure seen in Mortal Kombat II could not have been Blaze, since at the time he was already guarding the egg.\n\nJade\n\nReal Name Jade Age Around 10,000 Height 5′ 9″ (1.75 m) Weight 130 lb.

She first appeared as a secret, unplayable character in Mortal Kombat II, and first became playable in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nAbout Jade\n\nJade is a childhood friend of Princess Kitana. While her motives were unclear, she served Shao Kahn alongside Kitana and Mileenaas his personal assassin for most of her life. When Kitana finally turned against Shao Kahn, Jade was ordered to capture her for the Emperor. She ultimately chose to join her friend, and has since loyally assisted Kitana in her quest to free their native realm and restore its original beauty. Now residing in the freed Edenia, Jade is a General of the Edenian Army and continues to dutifully serve Kitana and her mother Sindel.\n\nJade’s confident, self-assured and sassy personality was first thoroughly portrayed in her Girls Gone Wired campaign video, but later expanded upon throughout her story in Mortal Kombat (2011). Always known for her loyalty towards Kitana, she has proven herself to be a dependable, sincere and devoted friend to the princess. She is sarcastic, patronizing and cocky towards her opponents, and incredibly ruthless and towards those she considers a personal enemy (at one point splashing Tarkatan essence on the Edenian traitor, Tanya, and allowing her to be torn to pieces by Baraka’s militia).\n\nAs a female assassin adorned in a green skin-tight outfit, Jade was initially very similar in appearance to Kitana and Mileena, the only noticeable difference being her darker skin. She appeared first as a hidden, unplayable character in Mortal Kombat II whose moveset were mostly like Kitana’s including the use of the fan blade weapon. To reach Jade, the player would fight a one-player game on the match just before the “?” on the map of the mountain. If the player won at least one round of the match using only the Low Kick button (no punches, High, or Block button presses), they would immediately be warped to Goro’s Lair to fight Jade. The player did not have to win the match — only one round — to fight Jade.\n\nJade would later become a regular character in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Her main weapon of choice is a metal staff, but she also uses razor-edged boomerangs (dubbed “razorangs”) as well.\n\nJax\n\nReal Name Jackson Briggs Age 28 (as of MKII) Height 6′ 8″ (2.03 m) Weight 350 lbs.

He made his debut in Mortal Kombat II.\n\nAbout Jax\n\nJax was the first African-American character in the Mortal Kombatseries and made his debut in Mortal Kombat II. He is portrayed as an archetypical American hero. In the chain of command of theSpecial Forces, he is Sonya Blade‘s direct superior, and clearly the catalyzing force of Sonya’s impulsiveness. Jax is clear-headed, careful and always keeping a watch on what his men are doing, but when the need arises, he is a beast on the battlefield with the attitude and ferocity of a lion. He unscrupulously makes use of the most advanced technology to improve both himself and his unit. He is responsible for the crime lord Kano‘s disfigurement, forcing him to wear a metal plate over a portion of his face.\n\nShao Kahn\n\nReal Name Shao Kahn Age Unknown (beyond 10,000) Height 7′ 2″ (2.18 m) Weight 400 lbs (181.4 kg) Status Emperor Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Outworlder Weapons Wrath Hammer (All appearances)\n\nStaff (MKII, UMK3, MKT,MK:SM)\n\nShao Kahn’s Sword (Mortal Kombat: Conquest) Fighting Styles Tai Tzu (MK:D, MK:A)\n\nLui He (MK:D) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat II (boss)\n\nMortal Kombat 3 (boss)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3(boss)\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy (boss)\n\nMortal Kombat Advance(boss)\n\nMK: Deadly Alliance (cameo)\n\nMK: Deception (GameCube\n\nexclusive)\n\nMK: Unchained\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks (boss)\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat (boss)\n\nMK vs DC Universe (boss\n\nand playable)\n\nMortal Kombat (2011) (boss)\n\nShao Kahn is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He made his debut in Mortal Kombat II as the boss, a role he also served in Mortal Kombat 3. He serves as the main antagonist of the series in many instances.\n\nAbout Shao Kahn\n\nShao Kahn the Konqueror is represented as the embodiment of evil. In many respects, he resembles a large Asian warrior, and is well known amongst the roster of Mortal Kombat Kombatants for his godlike strength which rivals that of Raiden, the God of Thunder. He is also known for his extreme callousness, brutality, ferocity in battle, and his fondness of personal executions, though he has occasionally spared the lives of his subordinates, if they prove their worth, and his victims such as Sindel and Kitana, raising the latter like his own daughter and treating the former like his own wife. However, his true power that has served him well and allowed him to rise above the image of a mere warlord is his high intelligence and profound knowledge of the black arts. Like his subordinate Shang Tsung, he has the power to consume other souls.\n\nPerhaps Shao Kahn’s greatest strength lies in his ability to work towards his goals with great tenacity and his ability to organize. However, his greatest weakness is his arrogance and overconfidence. Shao Kahn has often underestimated mankind, and therefore tried to conquer Earthrealm many times, with or without a queen (consort), to no success.\n\nKintaro\n\nReal Name Kintaro Age Unknown Height 8′ 5″ (2.57 m) Weight 650 lbs (295 kg) Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Shokan (Tigrar Lineage) Allies Shao Kahn\n\nGoro\n\nSheeva Enemies Motaro\n\nRaiden\n\nLiu Kang\n\nKung Lao Weapons Saber Teeth (MK:A) Fighting Styles Tiger Fist (MK:A) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat II\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMK: Deception (cameo)\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011) (sub-boss)\n\nKintaro is a character from the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He made his debut in Mortal Kombat II as the game’s sub-boss and became playable in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. InMortal Kombat (2011) Kintaro returns as a sub-boss for the game and carries a more important role in the game’s storyline, presenting himself as the one that burnt Kabal.\n\nKintaro replaced Goro after Goro was defeated by Liu Kang inMortal Kombat. He is the only member of his race seen thus far to have unique features. Unlike Goro and Sheeva, Kintaro has tiger striped markings all over his body as well as sharp fangs, claws and feline-like feet. According to his Mortal Kombat (2011)bio, this is indicative of the lower-class Tigrar clan of Shokan, differing from the more elite Draco class that Goro and Sheeva belong to, so there are likely more of his kind out there. It should be noted that in each new game, his feline features stand out more than the last.\n\nKitana\n\nReal Name Kitana Age 10,000 Height 5′ 9″ (175cm) Weight 128 lbs (58kg) Status Princess Origin Edenia Resides 1st Timeline: Edenia\n\n2nd Timeline: Netherrealm Species Edenian Weapons Steel Fans (MKII, UMK3, MKT,\n\nMKAdvance, MKG, MK:DA,\n\nMK:U, MK:A, MK:SM,\n\nMKvsDCU, MK 2011)\n\nFlying Blade (MKG) Fighting Styles Eagle Claw (MK:DA, MK:U)\n\nBa Gua (MK:DA, MK:U, MK:A) Alignment 1st Timeline: Good (Formerly Evil)\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil (Formerly Good) Appearances Mortal Kombat II\n\nMortal Kombat 3 (cameo)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat 4\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMK: Deadly Alliance\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Deception (Action Replay Only)\n\nMK: Unchained\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMK vs. DC Universe\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nKitana is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. She made her debut in Mortal Kombat II.\n\nAbout Kitana\n\nPrincess Kitana is 10,000 years old, but is considered young in her realm of Edenia and only appears to be in her early twenties. Throughout the years, she rose to great importance; first as the loyal stepdaughter of Shao Kahn, then as his enemy, tearing herself away from his grasp and freeing her home realm of Edenia. She also led an army into Outworld to combat any chance of Shao Kahn rising to power again.\n\nShe shared a subtle love interest with Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang, even after he was murdered by the Deadly Alliance. She has aligned herself with the good side, despite her loyalty to Shao Kahn for most of her life, until learning the truth about her past and real family.\n\nKung Lao\n\nReal Name Kung Lao (功老) Age 24 (as of MKII) Height 5′ 10″ (1.78 m) Weight 175 lbs.

He stands in the shadow of his great ancestor, the Great Kung Lao, but unlike his great ancestor he has no desire to be champion and would rather live a life of peace. As well, he has sought counsel from master Bo’ Rai Cho. Of the Earthrealm warriors, Kung Lao is the most outspoken pacifist, although he will not hesitate to severely punish those who attack him, Earthrealm, or his friends. His trademark is his Razor-Rimmed Hat, which he can employ quite powerfully and effectively in combat. Many of his fatalities involve the use of his hat to some extent.\n\nAccording to MK co-creator John Tobias in a 1995 interview with EGM, Kung Lao’s hat was inspired by the 1964 James Bond movieGoldfinger, in which a character named Oddjob threw his derby hat as a weapon.\n\nMileena\n\nReal Name Mileena Age Less than a year as of MK 2011 Height 5′ 9″ (1.75 m) Weight 128 lb (58kg) Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Half-Tarkatan Half-Edenianclone of\n\nKitana/Genetic Experiment Weapons Long Sword (MKG)\n\nSai (MKII, UMK3, MKT, MKG,MKD,\n\nMKSM, MKA, MK 2011) Fighting Styles Ying Yeung (MK:D)\n\nMian Chuan (MK:D, MK:A) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat II\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMK: Deception\n\nMK: Unchained\n\nMK: Shaolin Monks\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nMileena is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.

Vicious and evil, she despises Kitana, and feels that it is her own right to rule Edenia as Princess in her place. Her fondest wish is to kill her “sister”, and claim her existence for her own. Something of an opportunist, she will make use of any chance to seize power that comes within her hands.\n\nSmoke\n\nReal Name Tomas Vrbada Age 34 (As of MK:D) Height 6′ 1″ (1.85 m) Weight Human: 170 lbs (77 kg)\n\nCyborg: 555 lbs (252 kg) Status Assassin Origin Earthrealm (Prague, Czech Republic) Resides Netherrealm Species 1st Timeline: Cyborg (formerlyHuman)\n\n2nd Timeline: Human/Enenra Weapons Kunai (MKII, UMK3, MKT, MK 2011) Fighting Styles Mi Tzu (MK:D, MK:U, MK:A),Judo (MK:A) Alignment 1st Timeline: Good (Unwillingly Evil in MK:D)\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil (Formerly Good) Appearances MKII (unplayable)\n\nMK3\n\nUMK3\n\nMKT\n\nMKAdvance\n\nMK:D\n\nMK:U\n\nMK:SM\n\nMK:A\n\nMK 2011\n\nSmoke is a ninja assassin who was turned from a human into acyborg in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He made his debut in Mortal Kombat II as an unplayable secret character in human form, and first became playable in Mortal Kombat 3 in cyborg form. He appears in the franchise’s reboot, now retaining his human form in canon for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nAbout Smoke\n\nSmoke debuted in Mortal Kombat II as a hidden character to fight against. He was often spotted in theLiving Forest stage in which he (along with Jade) peeked out of the trees. LikeReptile when he made his first appearance, he was simply a palette-swap ofScorpion with puffs of smoke surrounding him, but would move extremely fast. He would appear randomly before matches, offering clues that would enable the player to fight him, as Reptile had in the originalMortal Kombat.\n\nSmoke would not have his own storyline until he was featured in Mortal Kombat 3, where he was once again a hidden character, but accessible to players with the use of a code. In this appearance, he would be a tortured, human soul trapped in the body of a cyborg. His most defining feature is the fact that he constantly seems to emit a smoke or vapor. This, combined with his power to teleport and turn invisible, once made him one of the Lin Kuei‘s top assassins.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat (2011), its revealed that he has long, flowing, ghostly white hair, which, while blown back in renders and artwork, covers his face in game.\n\nSub-Zero\n\nReal Name Kuai Liang (奎良) Age 32 Height 6′ 2″ (188 cm) Weight 210 lbs.

He is the younger brother of Noob Saibot, who was the original Sub-Zero in the first Mortal Kombat game. The younger Sub-Zero made his debut in Mortal Kombat II. In one form oranother, Sub-Zero has appeared in every generation of Mortal Kombat games as a playable character.\n\nAbout Sub-Zero\n\nSub-Zero is one of the most popular characters in the Mortal Kombat series. There are in fact two incarnations of Sub-Zero, and they are siblings: the older brother Bi-Han, and younger brother Kuai Liang. Both are blue garbed warriors that are members of theLin Kuei that descended from Cryomancers: an Outworld race possessing the ability to generate and control the powers of ice, although both of them were born in Earthrealm. Kuai Liang bears a scar on his right eye which he received between the events ofMKII–MK3. However – as of Deception – the scar has faded away, possibly because of the effects of his Dragon Medallion.\n\nIn their biography, both Sub-Zero brothers were sons of a Chinese Cryomancer father and a human mother. It is known that the father of both brothers was a secret operative for the Lin Kuei in the United States. He married an American woman and together they had two sons. Against the will of their mother, the father took the sons with him to move back to China, and as such both brothers were trained as Lin Kuei assassins. This was later retconned as both brothers being kidnapped by the Lin Kuei (this was revealed in Sub-Zero’s trailer in Mortal Kombat 2011).\n\nBi-Han appeared as Sub-Zero in the first Mortal Kombat, while Kuai Liang went by the codename “Tundra”. After Bi-Han was killed byScorpion during the tournament, Kuai Liang replaced him for the rest of the games – Bi-Han later became the undead Netherrealmwraith, Noob Saibot.\n\nThe younger Sub-Zero clearly shares many traits with his older brother, and was perhaps too similar to his brother upon his introduction. Like the elder, the younger Sub-Zero gives the impression of being a stern, distant and cold man who goes about his business silently, without attracting unwanted attention. However, as time progressed, Sub-Zero evolved – from what fans labeled a “carbon copy” of his brother – into a man of great integrity and self-discipline. The disparities between the brothers, who were once neutral and almost indistinct from each other, have now grown so large that one could speak of the evil twin syndrome.\n\nWhile the younger Sub-Zero was depicted as a young Lin Kuei warrior who was living in the shadow of his older brother, he has since changed and grown into a warrior who has progressed towards the more humane sides of moral issues. This change in characteristics has not only strengthened him as a man, but has also set him apart from his former Lin Kuei counterparts. This included leaving his clan in disgust and breaking the sacred codes of honor, joining the rebellion against Shao Kahn and assisting Raiden and Liu Kang (along with Earthrealm’s other chosen warriors). More recently, he defeated the cyborg assassin known as Sektor after the events of Mortal Kombat Gold to gain the leadership of the Lin Kuei and become the Grandmaster, where he has grown even stronger and more powerful. He is a dependable ally of Earthrealm who is willing to assist when needed, especially when Raiden gives the call. He is without question one of the greatest and most powerful warriors that Earthrealm has to offer.

In Mortal Kombat (2011), Kabal is once again good, although his past as a Black Dragon member is mentioned by Kano. Before his disfigurement, he was a cop partnered up with Kurtis Stryker.\n\nMotaro\n\nReal Name Motaro Age Unknown Height 8′ 6″ (2.59 m) Weight 900 lbs (408 kg) (Minotaur)\n\n1,200 lbs (544 kg) (Centaurian) Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species 1st Timeline: Centaurian(formerly), Minotaur\n\n2nd Timeline: Centaurian Allies Shao Kahn\n\nShang Tsung\n\nKano\n\nBaraka Enemies Raiden\n\nKintaro\n\nSheeva\n\nSindel\n\nJax Briggs\n\nJohnny Cage Weapons None Fighting Styles Horse (MK:A) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat 3 (sub-boss)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3(sub-boss)\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy (sub-boss)\n\nMortal Kombat Advance (sub-boss)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat (sub-boss)\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception(cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011) (cameo)\n\nMotaro is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.

He made his debut in Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nAbout Sektor\n\nThroughout the various Mortal Kombat games he was involved in, Sektor has grown into an ever more menacing mechanized warrior. He represents the closest thing to evil a cyborg can be, and combines traits of both a stealthy ninja and a ruthless killing machine fit for modern warfare. In contrast to his counterpartCyrax, Sektor never bothered to rediscover his human side, and may be unable to. As far as this could be said about a cyborg, it is likely that he suffers from a form of insanity. He is capable of independent thought and action like Cyrax and Smoke; however, unlike the other two cyborgs, the only emotion Sektor really displays is anger.\n\nSheeva\n\nReal Name Sheeva Age Unknown Height 7′ 3″ (2.21 m) Weight 210 lb.

Sheeva belongs to the ancient race of the Shokan, a race of mighty four armed halfHuman, half Dragon beings from Outworld that are the archenemies of the Centaurian race. Like all of her race, she possesses a tall, muscular build, and four arms. Notably, Sheeva served as the personal bodyguard of Queen Sindel during Shao Kahn‘s failed invasion of Earthrealm.\n\nUnlike Goro and Kintaro, Sheeva was never a sub-boss in the Mortal Kombat series and was always a playable character, therefore she was not as strong as them.\n\nSindel\n\nReal Name Sindel Age Over 10,000 Height 5′ 9″ (1.75 m) Weight 128 lbs (58 kg) Status Queen Origin Edenia Resides 1st Timeline: Edenia\n\n2nd Timeline: Netherrealm Species Edenian Allies Kitana\n\nJade\n\nRaiden\n\nLi Mei\n\nCyrax\n\nShujinko\n\nLiu Kang\n\nSonya Blade\n\nJohnny Cage\n\nNightwolf\n\nSmoke\n\nJax\n\nSub-Zero\n\nKung Lao\n\nErmac\n\nStryker Enemies Shao Kahn\n\nQuan Chi\n\nShang Tsung\n\nOnaga\n\nMotaro\n\nMileena\n\nTanya Weapons Kwan Dao (MK:D, MK:A) Fighting Styles Zha Chuan (MK:D, MK:A)\n\nFu Jow Pai (MK:D) Alignment 1st Timeline: Good (Formerly Unwillingly Evil)\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat 3\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception\n\nMortal Kombat: Unchained\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nSindel is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. She made her debut in Mortal Kombat 3 with a very important role in the storyline. She can also be seen on the side of the MK3arcade cabinet.\n\nAbout Sindel\n\nSindel is an exceptional character in theMortal Kombat series (and in fighting games in general). In spite of her gloomy, gothic appearance, Sindel is benevolent in nature. She rules the realm of Edenia alongside her daughter, Princess Kitana. Sindel’s power appears to be more one of an inner, ethereal nature and she in more than one way. She is a distinctly older and mature character, with flowing grey hair and a regal attitude befitting of her role as Queen of Edenia. She has a natural affinity with aerial magic, as evidenced by her ability to levitate and manipulate sonic waves.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat: Deception, creator Ed Boon describes Sindel as a challenging character in more ways than one. Although Sindel is not one of the main characters in the series, she was involved in a big part of the game. This had to do with the fact that her ruling over Edenia, and how it was a target to many rulers like Shao Kahn, Shinnok, and Onaga. Sindel was one of the few evil characters to turn good in the series.\n\nStryker\n\nReal Name Kurtis Stryker Age Unknown Height 6′ 1″ (1.87 m) Weight 197 lbs (89 kg) Status SWAT Member Origin Earthrealm Resides 1st Timeline: Earthrealm\n\n2nd Timeline: Netherrealm Species Human Allies Kabal\n\nLiu Kang\n\nSonya Blade\n\nJax Briggs\n\nSub-Zero\n\nKitana\n\nNightwolf\n\nRaiden\n\nKung Lao\n\nSindel\n\nJohnny Cage\n\nSmoke\n\nJade\n\nCyrax\n\nLi Mei\n\nShujinko Enemies Shao Kahn\n\nKintaro\n\nShang Tsung\n\nQuan Chi\n\nMileena\n\nKano Weapons Nightstick (MK3, UMK3, MKT,MK:A, MK2011)\n\nHand Gun (UMK3, MKT,MK2011)\n\nTaser (MK3, UMK3, MKT,MK:A, MK2011)\n\nGrenade (MK3, UMK3, MKT,MK:A\n\nMachine Gun (MK:A) Fighting Styles Hua Chuan (MK:A) Alignment 1st Timeline: Good\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil (Formerly Good) Appearances Mortal Kombat 3\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMK: Deception (cameo)\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nOfficer Kurtis Stryker is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He made his debut in Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nAbout Stryker\n\nStryker was introduced in Mortal Kombat 3as a somewhat stout-looking man sporting a very urban design with a white-blue shirt, combat boots, gunbelt, black police pants, and a backwards cap. However, his appearance changed in Armageddon into a more serious-looking and modernized policeman. Originally described as being a leader of the Special Riot Control division in the New York City Police Department,[1] he employs modern weaponry such as explosives, firearms, tasers, and nightsticks in battle, making him a force that is not to be underestimated. He is seen as the first person to run towards the pyramid in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.\n\nChameleon\n\nReal Name Chameleon Age Unknown Height Unknown Weight Unknown Origin Zaterra Resides Outworld Species Unknown (possibly Saurian) Allies Shao Kahn Enemies Unknown Weapons Ninja Sword (MK:A) Fighting Styles Crane (MK:A) Alignment Evil Appearances Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nChameleon is a ninja who utilizes camouflage during fights in theMortal Kombat fighting game series.

He also appeared as a hidden character in the PC, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn versions of Mortal Kombat Trilogyand as a playable character in MK: Armageddon.\n\nAbout Chameleon\n\nChameleon first debuted in the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC versions of Mortal Kombat Trilogy as a male ninja with partial transparency that changed color. In the Nintendo 64 version, he was replaced by Khameleon, a female counterpart who is actually an entirely separate character. There was initially little information about Chameleon as he had no storyline or game ending. All that was known about him is garnered from the hidden option to fight him (available upon beating the game), in which he is referred to as “one of Shao Kahn‘s deadliest warriors”.[1] He later returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon with a completely new design and a backstory.\n\nErmac\n\nReal Name Ermac Age Less than 1 year (as of MK 2011) Height 5′ 8″ (1.73 m) Weight 180 lbs (82 kg) Status Enforcer Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Fusion of souls Allies Kenshi\n\nLiu Kang\n\nJax Briggs\n\nSonya Blade\n\nRaiden\n\nKitana\n\nJohnny Cage\n\nSub-Zero\n\nShujinko\n\nKung Lao\n\nCyrax\n\nLi Mei\n\nKurtis Stryker\n\nTaven Enemies Rain\n\nAshrah\n\nShao Kahn\n\nOnaga\n\nTanya Weapons Axe (MK:D, MK:A) Fighting Styles Hua Chuan (MK:D)\n\nChoy Lay Fut (MK:D, MK:A) Alignment 1st Timeline: Good (formerly Unwillingly Evil)\n\n2nd Timeline: Unwillingly Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat (glitch)\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat 3\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception\n\nMortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks\n\nMortal Kombat: Unchained\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nUltimate Mortal Kombat\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nErmac is a red ninja who utilizes telekinesis during fights in theMortal Kombat fighting game series, who made his debut inUltimate Mortal Kombat 3. Before that however, he was a subject of fan speculation that began with a glitch in Mortal Kombat.\n\nAbout Ermac\n\nMaking his first debut in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Ermac has been a controversial and mysterious character in the Mortal Kombat series whose existence was rumored since its inception.\n\nErmac is a Fusion of many souls destroyed in Outworld’s wars who came to be controlled by Emperor Shao Kahnand his Shadow Priests. Because of this, he refers to himself as “we,” “us,” and “our” instead of “I,” “me,” and “my“. Due to the sheer concentration of souls within Ermac, he possesses the gift of telekinesis, and can travel to different realms. However, the depths ofNetherrealm drain his powers and souls. He is weakened dramatically while there, but a mysterious stone dubbed the Soul Stone Shujinko found for him would protect his souls.\n\nDisappearing after the events of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, he only returned in Mortal Kombat: Deception, where he was freed from Shao Kahn’s grip by the blind swordsman Kenshi, whom he repaid by teaching him the Telekinetic Slam. He decided to become a force of good partly in guilt of his past evils. To prove this, he decides to help Liu Kang free the souls of his friends from control of Onaga.\n\nRain\n\nReal Name Rain Age Beyond 10,000 Height 6′ 1″ (1.85 m) Weight 210 lbs (95 kg) Status Prince Origin Edenia Resides Outworld Species Half-Edenian, Half-God Allies Shao Kahn\n\nQuan Chi\n\nShang Tsung\n\nTanya\n\nReiko Enemies Raiden\n\nTaven\n\nJade\n\nKitana\n\nDaegon\n\nElder Gods Weapons Storm Sword (MK:A) Fighting Styles Goju Ryu (UMK3, MKT)\n\nZi Ran Men (MK:A) Alignment Evil (Once Neutral) Appearances Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3(unplayable\n\nin Arcade only)\n\nMortal Kombat Trilogy\n\nMortal Kombat Advance\n\nMortal Kombat: Deception(cameo)\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011) (DLC)\n\nRain is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. He made his debut in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nAbout Rain\n\nRain was originally meant to appear in Mortal Kombat 3, but didn’t actually appear until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Rain was originally a red herring inserted by the game developers; a character shown in the game’s attract mode who did not actually exist within the game itself. A recent interview reveals that the insert was made by Ed Boon himself to intentionally trick players. Many MK fans searched for him in vain, with the eventual realization of his status as a joke character (named after a Prince song, Purple Rain) dawning. The joke expands further when it is revealed that Rain is a “prince” himself. He would, however, soon make an actual appearance in the console versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and Mortal Kombat Trilogy as a full-fledged character with his own history (that of a traitor to his realm), and move set, to the delight of many fans, as well as the chagrin of others. His popularity is mixed within the MK fanbase. He is a DLC character for Mortal Kombat (2011), released on July 19th. His debut gameplay trailer was released on July 11th.\n\nQuan Chi\n\nReal Name Quan Chi Age Immortal Height 6′ 7″ (2.01 m) Weight 210 lbs.

He is also a major villain in the series.\n\nAbout Quan Chi\n\nQuan Chi became the most powerful sorcerer and necromancer in the Netherrealm and a primary villain in the Mortal Kombat series. Quan Chi combines both cunning and brute force in his never-ending plots to overtake not only Earthrealm, but all of reality. He is an opportunist and will ally himself with anyone who can help him further his own goals. He is notable in particular for his ruthlessness and pragmatism. His manipulative and deceptive nature has earned him many enemies, including Sub-Zero and Scorpion, the latter whose entire family and clan he destroyed. Only Shinnok, Shao Kahn, Shang Tsung and Delia can match Quan Chi’s skills as a sorcerer.\n\nReiko\n\nReal Name Reiko Age Unknown Height 6′ 3″ (1.91 m) Weight 199 lbs (90 kg) Origin Outworld [1] Resides Outworld Species Outworlder Allies Shinnok\n\nShao Kahn\n\nTanya\n\nRain\n\nShang Tsung\n\nOnaga\n\nMileena\n\nGoro Enemies Raiden\n\nKitana\n\nTaven\n\nLiu Kang\n\nQuan Chi\n\nKenshi Weapons Spiked Club (MK4)\n\nScythe (MKG)\n\nCrude Hammer (MK:A) Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat 4\n\nMortal Kombat Gold\n\nMK: Deception (cameo)\n\nMK: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat (2011) (cameo)\n\nReiko is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.

He made his debut in Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero as a boss, and first became playable in Mortal Kombat 4, in which he also served as the boss.\n\nAbout Shinnok\n\nShinnok is considered one of the most evil beings in Mortal Kombat. A vengeful and powerful fallen Elder God, Shinnok appeared in Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero, Mortal Kombat 4 and Mortal Kombat Gold as the main villain. He has also made an appearance in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. He is seen to be seemingly leading the side of evil.\n\nUnlike Shao Kahn, Shinnok relies less on brute strength and fear-mongering, but more on magical powers and ancient artifacts. He is the ruler of the Netherrealm, possessing millions of years’ worth of knowledge and power, including the ability to perfectly impersonate any other beings of his choosing, as well as to transform into an immense demon. He also possesses extreme cunning, as well as the ability to manipulate events through others. For example, he had Quan Chi convince Shao Kahn to merge Earthrealm with Outworld against the Elder Gods’ will. As a result, both realms were severely weakened and left vulnerable to invasion by the Netherrealm.\n\nShinnok demands unwavering faith and loyalty from his followers and will not hesitate to kill anyone who doubts, challenges, or even represents a potential threat to him. He is even more brutal, heartless.\n\nOnly Delia, Shao Kahn, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi can match Shinnok’s skills as a sorcerer.\n\nKratos\n\nReal Name Kratos (English translation: “strength” and “power”) Age Unknown Height 6′ (1.83 m) to 6’5″ (1.96 m) Weight Unknown Origin Sparta, Greece Resides Sparta (before being God of War) – Olympus (after) Species Demigod (or Halfgod in the MK Universe) Allies Raiden\n\nFujin Enemies Shao Kahn Weapons Blades of Exile\n\nThe Nemean Cestus\n\nBow of Apollo\n\nHead of Helios\n\nBlade of Olympus\n\nIcarus Wings\n\nHead of Medusa Fighting Styles Chained-Blades Alignment Neutral (God of War series) Appearances Mortal Kombat (2011) (PS3 exclusive)\n\nKratos is the main character in Sony Computer Entertainment’sGod of War series, which is loosely based on Greek mythology. Kratos first appeared in God of War, which was released in March of 2005, and whose success led to the development of five additional games featuring him as the protagonist. He appears as a guest character in the PlayStation 3 version of Mortal Kombat (2011) because Ed Boon and the Mortal Kombat team felt Kratos would “fit perfectly”. However, he isn’t part of the story mode.\n\nAbout Kratos\n\nEventually revealed to be a demigod, Kratos embarks on a series of often forced adventures in attempts to avert disaster or change his fate. Kratos is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else in the execution of these adventures, often engaging in morally ambiguous activities and performing acts of extreme violence. Each adventure forms part of a saga with vengeance as a central theme, and provides additional information on Kratos’ origins and relationship with his family and the gods. Kratos has received positive critical reception, being described by reviewers as a “sympathetic antihero.” The character is also associated with products including artwork, clothing, comic books, fast food, the internet, a novel, sweepstakes, toys, and cell phone skins, with Game Guru claiming that “Practically anyone, even if they hadn’t played any of the God of War games, would know about Kratos.” Kratos was featured in GameInformer’s “50 characters that defined a decade” issue, giving props for the games and the deep, well done storyline.\n\nKratos was officially confirmed to appear in the new Mortal Kombatvideo game at Spike TV’s annual Video Game Awards with a new trailer. On March 23, Gamespot posted a new video showcasing Kratos’ gameplay and stage.\n\nSkarlet\n\nReal Name Skarlet Gender Female Age Less than 1 year Height Unknown Weight Unknown Status Enforcer Origin Outworld Resides Outworld Species Genetic Experiment Allies Shao Kahn Enemies Quan Chi Weapons Ninja Sword\n\nKunai Fighting Styles Unknown Alignment Evil Appearances Mortal Kombat II (glitch)\n\nMortal Kombat (2011 video game) (DLC)\n\nSkarlet is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.
