        "text": "I remember Kano used to be black in the first MK game, as well as in the second MK game (he was tied up in one of the backgrounds).\n\nWhy did they decide to make him white in the following MK games?\n\nDoes it have anything to do with the MK movie? (In the movie he's white and he's got an Australian accent...) Since MK Deadly Alliance, he looks pretty much like the \"movie Kano\". I personally prefer the original Kano.\n\nHe wasn't so \"pumped up\" and muscular, but he really seemed to be smart with an evil criminal mind. After the 3d transition, he just seemed stupid and big...\n\nAnyone knows why this change took place? I've never heard anything on this subject so far...\n\nWell, that's a bit strange coming from you, as you've posted the pics of Kano...\n\nThe MK1 Kano is clearly dark skinned and could most likely be of arab origin, if not african. His characteristics absolutely match the arab look and so does his outfit.\n\nMK3 Kano though doesn't seem to have a distinctive nationality (maybe European/French - he looks a bit like Fabien Barthez from the side, hahaha) and has no characteristics linking him to MK1 Kano, besides the robotic eye.\n\nMKDA Kano has an American/Australian look, but clearly his appearance is very much like the movie Kano's appearance. His build and outfit is almost the same. And he doesn't look even vaguely reminiscent of the MK1 Kano, again besides the robotic eye, that is.\n\nkoups Wrote:\n\nWell, that's a bit strange coming from you, as you've posted the pics of Kano...\n\nThe MK1 Kano is clearly dark skinned and could most likely be of arab origin, if not african.

He's a bald, white actor who also played Baraka, Kabal, and Quan Chi (in MKM:SZ). His name is Richard Divizio. Kano's never been Black, Indian, etc. The 'arab' feel your getting is probably from MK I's low-quality digitized graphics."
