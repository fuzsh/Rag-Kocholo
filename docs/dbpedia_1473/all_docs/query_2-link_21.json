        "text": "New review!\n\nRating: 83/100\n\nThe Atelier series has always been a rather niche series, especially in America, where gamers tend to favor more action packed and violent games rather than more low key affairs, especially story-driven games that have more to offer than that. That doesn't necessarily apply to every video game lover in the States, as I myself love JRPGs for their rich stories and often three-dimensional characters. My love for game franchises such as Pokemon, Kirby, Harvest Moon, and even visual novels such as Phoenix Wright and Clannad, is an attestment of that. Once I decided to branch out into playing other games, the Atelier series piqued my interest, and I have wanted to check it out, but I didn't have any of the consoles needed to play them. Once I saved money via my job and got a PS Vita, the opportunity to get the games presented itself, but I was always curious about whether which Atelier game was considered the best. Opinions varied among Atelier fans, but out of all of them, I thought Atelier Escha and Logy: The Alchemists of the Dusk Sky seemed the most appealing to me (Though I did wind up playing one of the spin-offs, Mana Khemia, first, because of a friend's recommendation). So now that I've played it, what do I think of it? Well, after playing this and a couple other Atelier games, I can safely say that I really like this one a lot!\n\nA direct sequel to Atelier Ayesha, in a tiny apple orchard village called Colseit, two young, fresh-faced alchemists, Escha Malier and Logix \"Logy\" Fiscario, have been given government jobs by their local administration at the Central R&D Division. But the two alchemists have different personalities and experiences with alchemy, which both exasperate and compliment each other. Together, Escha and Logy take on various jobs, such as running errands and fighting monsters that come too close to town. But the biggest mystery their world has to offer is that there are mysterious ruins floating in the sky, and no airship has been able to penetrate the turbulent winds that surround it. After a while, the duo, with the help of their friends and families, hope to build an airship strong enough to reach the floating ruins in order to uncover its mysteries once and for all. By the way, for anyone wondering, you don't have to have played Atelier Ayesha before playing this, as I played Escha & Logy before Ayesha and was able to understand it just fine, but Ayesha provides some context for why some events in Escha & Logy happen the way they do, especially in regards to Nio's presence and some of what she does later in the game.\n\nLike all the other Atelier games, Escha & Logy's main gameplay mechanic is item crafting. You have to explore various locales to gather materials, both in the overworld and winning them as prizes if you defeat monsters. Coming off of Mana Khemia, which I happened to play first, the way the game goes about item crafting is different from how the former does it. For one, you still have to use materials to craft certain items, but instead of spinning a wheel and matching the element to the material's element to get the best results, getting the best properties involves changing around the materials you use and using various items to manipulate the properties of the item you're making. As you get better at alchemy, you're also able to use special alchemy skills that can either increase an item's elemental attributes, get rid of certain attributes you don't want, get more of an item you want, and so on, though some are only unlocked through buying experiments from Marion. While I do admit I prefer Mana Khemia's take on alchemy, Escha & Logy's take on it is pretty fun in its own right, especially once you get the hang of it.\n\nSince Escha & Logy is a game that came out on the PS3 back in 2013, it's graphics are pretty good for its time, though anyone playing modern games now might consider them to be outdated. I personally don't think so, as I think they do their job well. The backgrounds and different areas are well rendered, the in-game sprites for both the humans and monsters look great, and the game has some pretty cool dungeon designs. Some might take issue with the fact that Escha & Logy uses more muted, earthy colors compared to more colorful games that have come out before and after, though I think it makes sense considering the world the Dusk trilogy takes place in and the lore behind it. From a gameplay standpoint, Escha & Logy's battle system is slightly similar to Mana Khemia, being turn based while also allowing for all kinds of strategies to make battles more varied and fun, such as support attacks, guarding, using items in battle, and unlocking new skills. But if you're coming into Escha & Logy thinking just leveling up will help you win battles, don't count on it, because similar to other games in the Atelier series, increasing your strength, defense, and magic abilities is heavily reliant on crafting the best items with the best properties, ingredients, and attributes, making you really have to use your head in regards to how you want to construct your equipment...though I found Escha & Logy's take on it to be far less obtuse and tedious than Atelier Sophie's. I don't have as much to say on the soundtrack, as it does its job, the various songs range from okay to amazing (Sky of Twilight in particular is a great battle song), but I do think it should have toned down the high pitched woodwinds somewhat, as they hurt my ears a bit.\n\nThe Atelier series has always prided itself on being more character driven stories than heavily narrative focused, and Escha & Logy is no different. I will say that I feel Escha & Logy's cast of characters is better than that of Mana Khemia, mainly in that they have stronger, more consistent writing that fleshes them out more, and since the game has a lot of character events you can activate, you have plenty of time to get to know them and learn about their strengths, weaknesses, what motivates them, and so on. And they don't have moments where they act needlessly mean-spirited and cruel for no reason. Sure, the cast still adheres to some rote stereotypes at first, but the solid writing and the sheer number of events that you can unlock flesh them out and develop them much more. The only character I can say that I truly hated was Katla, mainly because she's an annoying brat who's constantly lying to people about the stuff in her shop, and she's pretty useless in battle, though even then she's NOWHERE near as bad as Mana Khemia's interpretation of Pamela. God, never make me think of MK1's Pamela ever again. Though...will anyone kill me if I say I prefer playing this game with the English dub rather than the Japanese audio? Because...as much as I hate to say it, Escha's Japanese voice actress can get really loud and really shrill a lot of the time, to the point where sometimes it hurt my ears just listening to it. Sorry, Rie Murakawa.\n\nAs far as the main story goes, Escha & Logy doesn't have much in the way of an overarching narrative at first, with a lot of your time being spent fulfilling assignments like fighting monsters, synthesizing items, or gathering ingredients. I say at first, because there does come a point where the game does introduce an overarching conflict later on, though it comes in bits and pieces, and doesn't come into focus until near the end, and that's only if you manage to activate certain events before the game's deadline. Like previous Atelier games, you're given a time limit of three in-game years to get everything you need done, though from what I've heard, Escha & Logy's time limit is the most lenient out of all the Atelier games, especially since Atelier Shallie would go on to nix the time limit entirely from that point onward. I do think the game's story isn't as strong as Mana Khemia's, and by 2020's standards, it can very much be considered by-the-numbers, but that's not to say its bad in any way, and it makes sense for Escha & Logy's narrative scope. I know some people might take issue with the fact that you have to play the game twice to unlock the best ending, especially since your second playthrough isn't going to be much different than your first one other than your lead character and some bits of dialogue, along with actually allowing you to fight the final boss. The New Game+ option does remedy a lot of this, as it carries over everything from your previous playthrough, like levels, armor, weapons, items, recipes you bought, quality of life features you unlocked, and so on. The game does remedy a lot of issues that Atelier Ayesha had, which others have already pointed out in their reviews, so I won't repeat myself here.\n\nHonestly, my only real complaint about Escha & Logy as a game is that while I appreciate that the game as a ton of character events and cutscenes to unlock, the sheer number of them can be really overwhelming, and many of them are just comedic filler that don't really add anything to the characters or story in question. It's not fun wanting to just go to a shop and get a new recipe book, only to get hit in the face with a long cutscene that seems to drag itself out, and there are times when several play back to back. I know Katla's events are particularly annoying to get through. But everything else about Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky more than make up for the few shortcomings it has. As of this writing, I've finished four Atelier games total: This, Atelier Ayesha, the first Mana Khemia game, and the Atelier Marie remake. I'm currently in the process of playing Ateliers Lulua and Sophie, though I'm almost finished with the latter. After all this, I still think Atelier Escha & Logy is my favorite Atelier game, but that might change since I own more of the games, especially now that many of them are on the Nintendo Switch, which for me is the easiest way to play them. Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky is a cute, relaxing game that's true to its core franchise's ethos and a pretty solid game in its own right, and I feel it was the best point of entry into the franchise for me.\n\nThis review was written on April 23rd, 2024.\n\nRating: 75/100\n\nOut of all the kinetic novels Visual Arts/Key have released, especially in the US, many Key fans consider LOOPERS to be the worst one they put out, citing the following reasons: Shallow characters who are either underdeveloped or underutilized, too much style over substance, too short to make the most of its potential, predictable storyline, awkward pacing, not like the writer's usual style, so on and so forth. Considering that Loopers was a collaboration between Key and Ryukishi07 of Higurashi fame, people probably set their expectations too high after their success with Rewrite years prior. I wound up playing Loopers out of curiosity and because I wanted to play more visual novels since I've played very few of them. I'm not familiar with Ryukishi07 or his writing, so this is my first time playing something he worked on. I have played other Key games and while I do agree with the criticisms people have with Loopers, I honestly don't feel it's a bad game at all. Yeah, it's the weakest game in Key's output, sure, but even the worst thing they made is far from being absolute garbage. I feel Loopers does have a lot to offer, even in its flawed state.\n\nThe story focuses on high school student Akira Taira, aka Tyler, whose passion is treasure hunting, especially geocaching, which is basically GPS-assisted scavenger hunts. During one of these hunts, he runs into two friends from childhood; fraidy-cat tsundere Kiriko Hiruda aka Hilda, and her mischievous bestie Reona Machimura aka Leona. They spend some time catching up on old times and even partaking in Tyler's treasure hunt. But that morning, odd things begin happening to them, and they make a startling discovery: They're repeating the same day, August 1st, over and over again. After an encounter with two mysterious strangers, Simon and his friend Mia Fujikawa, Tyler and Hilda find out that they're stuck in a time loop. Simon and Mia are also stuck in the time loop, having formed a club called the Loopers consisting of people who are in the same predicament, and even invite Tyler and Hilda to join them. Unsure of what to do to navigate their new situation, Tyler and Hilda join the Loopers, and the kids work together to try and find a way to escape the time loop and return to their normal lives.\n\nIf there's one thing Loopers has gotten near unanimous praise on across the board, its the graphics and art style. For one, the bold, vibrant colors and more stylized, cartoonish, angular look of the character designs are vastly different from Key's usual output. These characters wouldn't look out of place in a Danganronpa game, they're that different from Key's usual look, and all of this comes down to who they hired to be the art director and character designer, one Kei Mochizuki. I'm not familiar with this person's work, but damn, I really hope Mochizuki-san gets hired to do more stuff like this because their character designs are pretty awesome. The colors in this game really pop, giving it almost a graffiti-like vibe to it. The backgrounds and CGs are no slouch either. Seriously, you could pick any image in this game and frame it up on your wall, they're that good. Seriously Key, hire Mochizuki to do more visual novels! The music is also pretty good, and the songs are all well-sung, that's really all I can say about it.\n\nI do agree that the cast of characters and how they utilized do feel rather basic, and their general archetypes aren't anything you haven't seen before. With this being a 6-hour long kinetic novel, and the cast here being larger than most kinetic novels that Key put out previously, the short length and pacing might have something to do with it. It's hard to develop a large cast of characters in a small time frame, and it never feels like we really get to know most of them. Joe, Holly, Ritapon, and Simon definitely get the short end of the stick, as other than some little details sprinkled around, they don't really change or develop much, Joe and Simon especially. The latter just feels like a walking plot device to make things more convenient for the other characters. He's rich and has a photographic memory? Gee, how convenient! I wish the game had expanded on them more, or had some side scenarios showing what they were like before they got caught in the time loop. The funny thing is, this is the first kinetic novel that's told from a third-person point of view, not from the POV of any particular character, which is usually par for the course for Key VNs, so Loopers could have used the opportunity to have sequences from their POVs. The game does it with Tyler, Hilda, and Mia, so there wasn't really anything stopping Key from doing the same with the other characters. Ironically, the characters I felt had the best chemistry and development were Hilda and Leona, and the latter spends half the game in a coma! But even with all the characterization problems this cast has, I still enjoyed watching them interact and seeing them come to terms with their situations.\n\nThat being said, one character definitely has me conflicted: Tyler. On the one hand, he is a VAST departure from other Key VN protags. Tyler is energetic, enthusiastic, passionate, loud, and has a hobby that he enjoys, far from the usual disillusioned, angsty, stoic, snarky protags Key is known for, and honestly...I really appreciated this. If Tyler were in something like, say, a long shounen anime, he'd definitely be seen as boring and cliche, but since he's a Key VN, where those types of characters are usually the best friend to the MC, he's honestly really refreshing. He's consistently kind to others, doesn't give a shit about anything except his hobby, and enjoys life. After having to deal with the irredeemable asshat that was Kouhei Orihara from One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, I'll gladly settle for Tyler any day of the week. On the other hand, the game has this really bad habit of shilling Tyler every chance it gets, whether it be everybody praising him up the wazoo, having his treasure hunting hobby solve everybody's problems, and generally worshipping the ground he walks on like he's some kind of saint. Yeah, I like Tyler as a character and all, but the shilling got to be way too much, especially near the end. I don't want to call him a Gary Stu, as that term has become rather loaded these days, but considering how every single character in the game puts Tyler on a pedestal, I can absolutely see why people who played the game are tired of him. I do agree that even outside of him being different from other Key protags, Tyler is kind of bland and he could have benefited from some character flaws to make him more believable, interesting, and compelling. Also, I like Mia just fine, but...Key, I think it's time you stopped relying so much on the \"sick girl who's secretly dying\" trope. You've done it so many times that it's become boring and bordering on emotionally manipulative. There are other ways you can make the audience feel sympathy for a female character, you don't always have to rely on the trope of \"secretly dying from a soap opera disease\" over and over again.\n\nWhile I do agree with the criticisms people mentioned above, with the game feeling too short to expand on its ensemble cast and not making more use of its material, none of that really hurt my enjoyment of Loopers. For one, I actually really liked its story. Most media that use time loops as a premise tend to play them for only tragedy and drama, not much else. Loopers does treat the idea of a time loop seriously, but manages to give it just enough levity that it doesn't feel overbearing, angsty, or melodramatic and is generally a more chill, slice-of-life story at heart. Plus, there's no sexual content or skeevy fanservice in this (Other than one joke, but it makes sense in context), in case anyone was worried about that. Personally, my only real issue with the story is the weird horror elements in the prologue, and the way the game tries to explain it. There's this long, drawn out sequence involving Hilda being put through the wringer in the beginning, with it being played dead seriously like something out of an actual horror story, but not only does nothing like this ever happen again in the game, the way Loopers explains what happened flat-out contradicts its established rules. The game claims Leona put herself into a coma voluntarily, but that's not what happened: Leona briefly went berserk, fell into a coma, and her...apparition or something tries to murder Hilda, which causes Hilda to have a mental breakdown. I know Ryukishi07 is mainly a horror writer, but I feel like that piece of the prologue didn't quite mesh with the rest of the game, which is funny because from what I've read, he wanted the game to be more of a straight horror, but Key rejected a lot of his ideas because they didn't fit Key's image. Honestly, I think all the horror scenes in general should have been excised entirely.\n\nYet even taking all of these things into account...I still enjoyed the game as a whole. A contradictory statement given my rating? Sure. Loopers is pretty flawed in its current state, and people might be right in that this is the weakest VN Key has put out. But coming from the perspective of someone who hasn't played their longer VNs, and has played few VNs in general, Loopers is hardly the worst game to ever exist, and even Key's weakest game still has something to offer for those who are into this kind of thing. I enjoyed the story, music, art style, and watching the characters interact, and my gripes with the game didn't hurt my enjoyment of it. I'm probably biased since I recently came off playing the absolute dreck that was One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, which I feel is way worse than Loopers could ever be. While I do feel Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild and Stella of the End are better, I don't think Loopers should be overlooked. Is it a flawed game? Yes, and I agree that the game should have been given more time to flesh out its characters. But even with my gripes with the game, I didn't hate it. And for what it's worth, it seems like Key and Ryukishi07 have realized how incomplete the base game is because it was just announced that it's getting an enhanced version called LOOPERS PLUS due to come out in 2024, with it being specifically mentioned that this new version will have new art, music, and original scenarios both during and after the main story, with particular focus being given to two characters who were often mentioned by name in the base game but never got portraits. Hopefully LOOPERS PLUS fixes the flaws the original had, and I also hope it gets an English release in some capacity (Complete with a Switch port! That's how I played the vanilla game!). I'll definitely buy the enhanced version if it ever comes stateside, but even with its flaws, I liked the original Loopers game and feel it shouldn't be overlooked just because it's not as good as the rest of Key's output.\n\nThis review was written on November 7th, 2023.\n\nRating: 57/100\n\nSo...this exists. And apparently it's come into the limelight now because somehow, for some reason, the streaming website Mubi somehow got their hands on it, gave it English subtitles, and put it up for streaming. That's how I learned about it, along with following the Twitter account WTK, which is a good source of home video news, licensing news, streaming news, and so on. But most old school animation afficionados know something pretty interesting about the Yuki's Sun pilot: This is actually the solo directorial debut of one Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki worked with Takahata on plenty of TV shows and directing some episodes of stuff during the 70s and 80s before moving onto movies, but this was the first time where he was the only one in the director's seat. But you're probably wondering just what the hell Yuki's Sun is about. Based on the 1963 shoujo manga by Tetsuya Chiba, Yuki's Sun follows a little girl named Yuki, who lives a happy, peaceful life in an orphanage until she's adopted by the affluent Iwabuchi family. When circumstances leave the Iwabuchi family penniless, Yuki finds herself on a journey to make a new life for herself, and maybe even rediscover her real family, with the only clue she has being the wooden cross necklace she always wears around her neck.\n\nBeing made in 1972, Yuki's Sun was actually meant to be a pilot for a TV series, but unfortunately, that went nowhere. If one were to judge Yuki's Sun on its own merits, what with it being a 5-minute short film...yeah, this has 70s shoujo melodrama written all over it. But if you can believe it, that's not the pilot's biggest problem. The biggest problem holding Yuki's Sun back as a film is that the whole thing comes off like an animated summary of the series, or a literal commercial for the manga, rather than a story on its own merits. Let me put it this way: Remember all those VHS commercials for the old animated Disney films back in the 80s and 90s, the ones that would basically summarize the entire movie to the point of flat-out spoiling important plot twists? Yuki's Sun feels like one of those but without the eighties power ballads or corny nineties music in the background. And yes, I'm not kidding you when I say this short film basically blitzes through the manga's entire story, complete with dropping plot twists like candy. \"Hey, Yuki's adopted family had shady dealings with townspeople! Hey, Yuki has to save her sick adopted sister and walk through a literal blizzard! Hey, Yuki reunites with her biological father but he dies immediately afterward! Hey, Yuki hops a train and then reunites with her biological mother!\" With literally no cohesion or explanation for how any of this plays out. If a TV series had managed to get made, I bet Miyazaki probably would have given these plot developments the proper build-up and pathos they deserved, but just throwing them in a five-minute short film doesn't really work.\n\nIt doesn't help that 95% of the pilot consists of a narrator talking over it and explaining everything. All she really does is summarize the entire premise of the manga, and the only other bits of dialogue come from Yuki, who has a grand total of three lines throughout the entire short. But even with the pilot's super short length (Literally five minutes long), Yuki's Sun is basically one of the earliest shoujo melodramas, rife with tropes and cliches that would fit right in with a soap opera: Missing biological parents, blunt force drama, bad things happening to the MC at every corner, adoptive families who have shady stuff going on, so on and so forth. Yuki's Sun might as well be Candy Candy before Candy Candy came into existence. I think Yuki's Sun choosing to just be a summary/commercial for the manga may have been what did it in, because it crams so much into five minutes, making it feel really rough and half-baked, and Miyazaki's early inexperience as a storyteller does unfortunately play a part in this. Also, how the hell is Yuki able to go through a friggin' blizzard without a coat or winter clothing?! She wears nothing but overalls and a short-sleeved shirt as she's dragging her sick adopted sister through a blizzard, she should have succumbed to either frostbite or hypothermia from that! I don't know how the manga makes this story play out, as no English translation of it exists, official or fanmade, so I can't read the manga for myself, though I admit I'd certainly like to.\n\nHonestly, the pilot's only real saving grace is its animation. For a short film that came out in 1972, it's surprisingly polished, reveling in beautifully painted backgrounds and fluid movement. Animation as a medium was still fairly in its infancy, yet there's traces of his signature crispness in the way Miyazaki animates the characters, especially in one sequence where Yuki is running along a river, which was unheard of in animation at the time and wouldn't be refined until the eighties at the earliest. And keep in mind, this was six years before Future Boy Conan. Granted, Yuki's Sun wouldn't really make Miyazaki as a household name, as his later movies wound up doing that for both him and Ghibli. So yeah, while Yuki's Sun as a pilot film is an interesting piece of unearthed animation history, it's kind of an amateurish, cliche short film that is unable to stand on its own and feels more like an animated commercial. It's a shame a TV series for this didn't get made, because it probably would have been pretty good, especially since Chiba-sensei's manga is already so short (Four volumes), and Miyazaki probably would have done the story justice if he was given the opportunity to do so. I'm glad that whoever at Mubi found this put it up for streaming to make it more accessible for people, but it's not really going to interest anyone who isn't interested in learning about Miyazaki's early ouveure.\n\nOh lordy. Get ready, folks, because I'm gonna go on a rant. This review was written on April 8th, 2024.\n\nRating: 48/100\n\nMany know the company Visual Arts/Key for their visual novels: Kanon, Air, Clannad, Little Busters, Rewrite, their kinetic novels, and so on. But while Kanon is the first VN that they produced under their Key banner, the staff that formed Key were actually part of another company before this, Tactics (Which would later come to be known as Nexton), and in 1998, they released an adult rated visual novel called One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. It was initially never exported outside of Japan, but in its home country, it was quite popular, to the point of getting a ton of ports to different consoles and supposedly pioneering the concept of VNs having more low-key, emotional, character driven dramas that many Key fans endearingly refer to as \"nakige\" or \"crying game.\" One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e did get a fan translation and that was all it got as far as English exposure. So imagine my surprise when I found out that it suddenly got a complete, from the ground up remake out of nowhere that came out in December of 2023, and said remake getting an official English release, at that! I'm gonna keep referring to the game by its original title, One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, because just saying the word One would just be confusing by itself. Seeing as a piece of gaming history was being released, I thought I'd give it a try and see what it's like.\n\n...Yeah, I regret that choice. A LOT.\n\nMuch like Key's later works, you play as a young man, one Kouhei Orihara, who lives his mundane, day-to-day life, going to school and spending time with (translation: harassing) his childhood friend Mizuka Nagamori. His parents have been out of the picture since he was young, and after his younger sister dies, he begins to seclude himself in the Eternal World (Though it's not referred to by name in-game), a world within his mind, an alternate space that Kouhei seemingly created out of his want for a place in which nothing ever changes. There's no real explanation for this whole thing, and the game wants you to just go with it. He starts receding into this world about a week before disappearing, during which everyone (including the girl he loves) forgets about him, and he falls into the Eternal World completely, making it seem as if he never existed in the real world. His only hope of returning is to form a strong bond with someone prior to leaving, and to follow his guide back to the real world. You get to choose one out of six girls: The aforementioned childhood friend Mizuka, who wakes him up every morning and worries about him; Rumi Nanase, an outgoing tsundere who Kouhei is always bothering; Misaki Kawana, a polite blind girl who's something of a jokester; Mio Kouzuki, a mute girl who's part of the drama club; Akane Satomura, a quiet, sullen girl who spends her days standing in an empty lot before school, and Mayu Shiina, a girl who mourns her dead pet ferret. There's even a secret route involving a male classmate, but you have to have gone through at least one other route to unlock it.\n\nThe story by itself isn't anything special, and Key would go on to refine it a lot in their later works. I know I just mentioned the entire premise of the game, but in all honesty, the whole Eternal World stuff only takes up 10% of it at most, and 90% of the game just consists of literally going through each day individually until you get locked onto a girl's route. Not only that, it also has Jun Maeda's favorite storytelling tool where the first half consists of wacky comedy before shifting hard into drama later on. I'm not gonna lie, the comedy really doesn't work here, because a lot of it just consists of Kouhei intentionally saying and doing ridiculous things that no sane person would do, most of which just feel like needless padding dragging the scene out for longer than it needs to. Hell, there's one scene that plays out the exact same way twice in a row, complete with all of its dialogue being reused. Like...lazy much? Actually, a good chunk of the game feels like its just plodding along and dragging itself out while having nothing to really hook anyone in. My playthrough of one route was just five hours without skipping, but so much of the game's story just consists of Kouhei talking to people while nothing interesting is going on. For the first half, there's literally no conflict, and even the slice-of-life segments just feel dull. Granted, One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e was one of the first visual novels to try out more low-key, character driven stories, and that's fine, but in my opinion, Key's later works managed to do them better, especially Air, Clannad, and even their later kinetic novels. Even other visual novels from other companies that came later had more going on, like Code:Realize having the main plot revolve around Cardia and her friends looking for her missing father and a cure for her poisonous body. Jack Jeanne had both the seasonal plays and Kisa trying to hide her identity. Those are longer VNs, but playing them, I never felt like they were just dragging their feet and struggling to find stuff to do like One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e does.\n\nSince this review is about the remake and not the original PC game, there is one thing I feel the remake did improve upon, and its the graphics. Not that the original artwork from the PC game was bad, and it does have its own distinct look that would influence Key's later games down the line, but the remake not only redoes everything from the ground up, one thing I appreciate is that the sprites here are actually animated. The game does give you the option to turn off sprite animation, but I think the animated sprites add to the immersion, especially with little touches like mouth movements or the way a character's hair moves. The CGs are no slouch either, and they're all well drawn and used whenever it's appropriate. There are even some chibi scenes drawn in that weren't in the original, and those are cute, too. Nexton brought Itaru Hinoue back to re-design the characters for the remake, since she worked on the original game previously, and while some might not like that the characters look more stereotypically moe and cutesy-poo compared to her original designs, what with their large eyes and small mouths, I found them to be just fine. My only gripe with the character designs is that Kouhei and Shun Hikami look way too similar to each other, to the point where I could mistake them for being twin brothers. The music is fairly good too, though I don't like that the game doesn't let you skip the credits sequence even after completing a route.\n\nConsidering that this is a game from 1998, back when slice-of-life VNs weren't the norm, stuff like character development wasn't common for games like this, and really, it shows. A good majority of the characters are little more than one-note stereotypes: Rumi is the tsundere, Mizuka is the motherly childhood friend, Mio is the mute clumsy little sister-type girl, Mayu's the childish crybaby, so on and so forth, and even as you get into their routes, they don't really change much or become more three-dimensional as the game goes on. We don't even learn about what their lives are like outside of school, for crying out loud! Key would later learn from their experiences on One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e and manage to create better, more fleshed out characters in their later games, especially Clannad. One could argue that the characters here provided the base templates for other characters in their later games. Funnily enough, as much as I usually hate the tsundere archetype, I actually like Rumi as a character, mainly because her anger towards Kouhei is completely justified and understandable considering he harasses her on a near regular basis. If I were in her position, I'd want to deck his ass, too! So good job on One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e for making me actually like a tsundere for once! Even if I'm not a huge fan of her route. Also, fun fact: The PS2 port of One actually put in a completely original route featuring a new heroine to pursue, Natsuki Shimizu, though for some reason she was left out of other ports and remakes, this one included.\n\nYou may have noticed that I haven't mentioned much about one particular character, Kouhei. That's because I've been stalling. Well, time to stall no longer. I might as well just rip the band-aid off and go on my soapbox, because honestly, I can't hold back any longer: I FUCKING HATE KOUHEI ORIHARA!! I'm not going to mince words here, he is the absolute worst visual novel protagonist I've ever had the displeasure of playing as, and for all I know there are probably worse ones out there considering this was originally an eroge. All throughout the game, no matter which route you choose, this guy acts like an unrepentant jackass who continually does stupid things and is flat-out mean to pretty much every girl he interacts with, whether it just be bullying them to stave off boredom or disrespecting their boundaries even when they tell him to stop whatever he's doing, with him being at his absolute most reprehensible during Mizuka's route, who is the main heroine, need I remind you. He bumps into Rumi multiple times and elbows her in the stomach? Nah, its all her fault and they're gonna be late for school, along with constantly bothering her during class. Mizuka wakes him up every morning and makes sure he gets to school on time? He constantly repays her by pulling dumb pranks on her whether it be sleeping naked and having her see him by accident, doesn't leave her notes when he does manage to leave early, and treating her like shit. Akane doesn't want to talk to him? He constantly hounds her during their lunch break. Good lord, I've never wanted to punch a male self-insert MC so bad before now, and the few times he does try to be nice to someone, its immediately undercut when he does back to his usual antics yet again. I know people complain that Key's games are emotionally manipulative, but in my opinion, I think One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e fits that bill because it really wants you to sympathize with Kouhei but does nothing to actually convince you that he's worth caring about as a character. He never actually grows as a person, learns from his mistakes, or overcomes his flaws, and going back to Mizuka's route, his actions are so God-awful and reprehensible that what little remorse he does show does absolutely nothing to make up for what he did.\n\nYou're probably thinking \"But don't people like characters with flaws? If he was nice and perfect, he'd just be a boring Gary Stu!\" And you're right, if a main character in a story had no flaws or faced no adversity, we as an audience won't care what happens because we know everything will just be hunky-dory, and if my college writing classes taught me anything, flawless MCs don't make for good storytelling. But here's the thing: There's an art to giving a protagonist intentional character flaws, and if their negative traits outweigh their positive ones, or the MC doesn't actually deal with their flaws, there's no reason for the audience to bother caring about them or following them on their journey. The point of character development is to see how they change, learn, and grow, whether it be through their experiences or their actions having consequences for them or others around them. Just as it can be bad to have everything go perfectly and therefore having no conflict, the opposite spectrum can be just as problematic, where something can be so bleak and dark, or if a character we're supposed to root for doesn't change their ways at all, that you question just what the point of it is. For specific examples of flawed characters done right, here are a few: Prince Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender; starts out as a villain, but does have morals and honor in how he tries to catch the Avatar, has several boundaries that he refuses to cross even then, faces several moral dilemmas and makes several bad decisions throughout the series, has to work hard to rectify his mistakes, and eventually becomes part of the team of heroes. Even going back to Key's work: Tomoya from Clannad. Tomoya is nothing like Kouhei in that he's actually nice to the people he talks to, and even when he does tease them, it's nowhere near the downright mean-spirited levels that Kouhei does, and any flaws that Tomoya has as a character and bad decisions that he makes are not only called out in series, especially in After Story, but he actually makes a conscious effort to address them.\n\nAnd you want to know what Tomoya doesn't do? TRY TO SET UP HIS FEMALE FRIEND TO GET FUCKING RAPED BY A STRANGER FOR FUNSIES!!! Yeah, I'm not kidding, there's a segment in Mizuka's route where Kouhei, I shit you not, sets up a situation where he tricks Mizuka into accompanying him at school at night in an attempt to have a stranger rape her. This is already bad enough on its own, which already kills any sympathy I could ever have for Kouhei as a character at all, but do you want to know what makes this whole thing even worse? Accessing this scene, along with being a shitty person to Mizuka in general, is a REQUIREMENT to get the best ending in not just Mizuka's route, who again is the main heroine, but for the entire game!! Just...why? Who thought this was a good idea? Because it isn't. I don't think I need to go into just how gross, tasteless, and fucking awful this whole scenario is, especially in regards to how thoughtlessly it treats the subject of attempted rape in general, but the fact that One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e still wants the audience to sympathize with Kouhei afterward is just...I can't. Nothing this game does could ever convince me to like Kouhei as a character, and other than updating the art and removing the sex scenes, nothing else has changed from the 1998 version, Kouhei's shittiness included. Like I mentioned before, I've only seen the anime adaptations for Air and Clannad, and haven't played their VNs yet, but I can guarantee you that Yukito and Tomoya are far better, far nicer, far more compelling VN protagonists than Kouhei could ever hope to be. Basically, I don't hate Kouhei because he has flaws, I hate Kouhei because the game goes way too far in making him flawed while trying to convince the audience to continue caring about him when he continually indulges in his shitty behavior and gets away with all of it. Mizuka, you deserve so much better than to keep putting up with Kouhei. Just ditch the guy! Jun Maeda, what the fuck were you thinking when you were writing Mizuka's route? What in the world made you think this was a good idea? Outside of Mizuka's route, Mayu's route just reeks of implications of child grooming and pedophilia, especially when you take into account that Mayu is a middle schooler who acts like she's five and possibly mentally underdeveloped. Need I say more? You know what? Maybe the bad ending where he just flat-out disappears is actually the good ending, where people won't have to put up with his shittiness and just forget about him!\n\nWow, I haven't gotten this angry about a character since...probably Minko from Hanasaku Iroha. But man did it feel good to let all of that out! In conclusion, you know how some remakes are just one-to-one remakes, without changing much, while some actually go to the trouble of smoothing out some mechanics or fixing some flawed story elements, or even characterization? One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e may be the former, but I feel like it'd be so much better if its remake had been the latter. There's so much about it that not only aged like milk, but is just terrible on principle, and not even because of the time period in which it was made. I know complaining about the game is pointless since if not for this game, we wouldn't have gotten stuff like Clannad and Little Busters. Key fans owe the game that much, and I have nothing against that. But One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e is completely bogged down by questionable writing decisions, glacial pacing, underutilized characters, a weak plot, and the absolute irredeemable shithead that is Kouhei, and what little good qualities it has just aren't worth going through all the slog and tedium. I honestly wouldn't recommend it to casual visual novel fans or even Key fans. If you want to buy it, you can get it off of Steam for $20 and other websites that sell it, and it's even available on the Switch too, though for some reason the Switch version costs $70. I have no clue why, though I've heard its because the Switch version was done by a different publisher. But seriously, there are better visual novels out there. Planetarian is a good gateway to Key's body of work, since its short, sweet, and doesn't have a God-awful male protagonist. Or even stuff like Code:Realize, Jack Jeanne, Digimon Survive, Clannad, Harmonia, Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild, the Ace Attorney series, and so much more! Hell, I was more invested in Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild than I ever was in One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e! Please, play anything except this. Spare your sanity.\n\nThis review was written on April 29th, 2024.\n\nRating: 95/100\n\nMan, I really shouldn't have put this off for so long. I mentioned in my previous Natsume review that during 2016-2020, I was neck deep in anime burnout, to the point where I couldn't bring myself to watch more than an episode of anything at least once in a blue moon. During that time, seasons 5 and 6 of Natsume Yuujinchou aired in 2016 and 2017, and since it had been four years since season 4 ended, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to jump back in since the series is fairly strict with its continuity. I was able to get out of my burnout, and to my surprise, Natsume began receiving English dubs starting in 2022, which proved to be the perfect way for me to jump back into the series. I decided then and there that as soon as season 4 got a dub, I'd finally get off my ass and watch seasons 5 and 6. As you can tell by the review, I finally made good on my promise and finished both, OVAs included. It still surprises me just how amazing this series manages to be, not just in its overall quality, but the fact that since that time, the series switched production companies while maintaining its core staff. Like with my first review of Natsume, I'm going to have this review talk about seasons 5 and 6 together, as talking about them separately would be kind of redundant.\n\nThe series still focuses on Takashi Natsume's adventures helping various youkai and people with their problems, while continuing to build on everything previous seasons established. That aspect of the series hasn't changed one bit, and its all the better for it, keeping the subtle touch that made the previous seasons so good. It helps that even with the animation production company changing from Brains Base to Shuka (Why is that, I wonder?), all of the staff from previous seasons were kept on; the director, scriptwriters, music composer, and of course the voice cast. Consistency is really important when maintaining a long running series, and often times, shows that go on for a long time, especially the more prominent series, tend to either meander or become very different from how they started. Natsume Yuujinchou is one of those few series that manages to stay consistently good in both its animation, characterization, and writing quality in the years since its first airing and, other than a few minor foibles, never lost sight of what it's mean to be. That's a feat not many series can boast, and I'm so glad the change in animation companies didn't hurt the series any, as some shows that change animation companies tend to look quite different than their previous seasons, and the resulting changes can really hurt a series if done poorly. Take note, Laid-Back Camp season 3 and your weird photographic backgrounds with bad filters.\n\nRemember how I mentioned in my review for seasons 1-4 that every season focused on different themes and goals? Seasons 5 and 6 are similar in that while they continue to flesh out Natsume and the cast around him, more focus is given to the adult characters this time around, with season 6 finally taking the time to expand on one character in particular: Natori. While Natori has always been a presence in the show, seasons 1-4 never really went deep into his background. These two seasons do just that, really going into detail as to how seeing youkai affected his life, how he came to know Matoba, why he became an exorcist and how, and the affect his job has on his relationships with others. We also get some more backstory on Reiko, Touko, and Shigeru throughout both seasons. Season 6 even has one episode that fleshes out, of all people, Natsume's two male classmates Nishimura and Kitamoto. They were fun characters in seasons 1-5, sure, but I really liked the revelations it presented with them in season 6, as it really recontextualizes their friendship with Natsume. Season 6 even brings back a character introduced in season 3, Shibata, Natsume's former bully and gives him another episode that shows how he's changed since his initially awkward reunion with Natsume prior. Another theme seasons 5 and 6 have in common is showing Natsume expanding his social circle, with more people learning that he can see youkai outside of just Tanuma and Taki.\n\nLike I mentioned before, this isn't a series where you can just jump into a season and understand what's going on right off. Seasons 5 and 6, while still having a laid-back atmosphere, do expect you to have watched the previous four seasons and keep track of what previously happened, especially when it comes to characters like Matoba and what they've been up to. The finale of season 6 even drops a pretty huge revelation about Natsume's heritage, and I'm betting season 7 will probably elaborate on this, though I could be wrong. One thing that did confuse me is that both seasons 5 and 6 have eleven episodes as opposed to the usual 12-13 previous seasons had, though they did get some extra episodes in the form of OVAs. A warning for anyone planning to watch any of the OVAs for these two seasons: Don't watch the one about Nyanko-sensei being made to babysit a couple of kids. That OVA is cliche, boring, annoying, the premise relies too much on the characters being idiots, and the kid characters are so whiny and insufferable that I wanted to smack them every time they opened their mouths. Natsume normally never has bad episodes, though I think this OVA might be the first. Its only saving grace is that it's a standalone OVA that is pretty disconnected from the series itself, so you can skip it and not miss anything.\n\nI've already gone in detail my feelings about the series as a whole in my previous review, so I won't belabor the point here. It took me way too long to get around to watching seasons 5 and 6, but better late than never, right? Natsume's Book of Friends is still a great anime in my book, and the fact that we're getting another season has me hyped as hell. No way am I gonna miss out on more of one of my favorite anime of all time! Since I actually own the blu-ray for the movie Ephemeral Bond, now I have an excuse to finally get around to watching that. But yeah, seasons 5 and 6 are an excellent follow-up to the previous four and it's quite honestly a modern miracle how its continued to maintain its level of quality over several decades on every level. Fans of Natsume's Book of Friends owe it to themselves to watch these seasons. Though again, don't watch that OVA I mentioned above unless you have a tolerance for crying kids.\n\nThis review was written on April 20th, 2024.\n\nRating: 73/100\n\nOn December 19th, 2019, the anime and music production company, Aniplex, announced that they were launching a brand made for the purpose of creating and publishing visual novels with help from other developers, which they called ANIPLEX.EXE. Months later, in June of 2020, two games made under the Aniplex.exe brand were released: Adabana Odd Tales and the subject of today's review, Atri: My Dear Moments. I'd been interested in checking Atri out for a while now, but several factors prevented me from doing so: My computer doesn't have the specs required to play it on Steam, Aniplex.exe hasn't bothered to release it in a physical form on any of the platforms its on, and even though the game was released digitally on the Switch with a full English translation, it's only available on the Japanese Switch eShop, with no American release unlike the Steam version. I even considered trying to play the mobile version, and anyone who talks to me at all knows I hate mobile games and playing games on my phone, but even my phone wasn't able to play Atri because it's not compatible with it. But I was able to create a Japanese eShop account, get a Japanese eShop card, and use it to buy Atri on my Switch. So what's my verdict? Ehh...Atri: My Dear Moments is a fine game, and I enjoyed most of my time with it, but it does have several problems, and it's pretty clear this game is just a rehash of every Visual Arts/Key kinetic novel you can think of.\n\nIn the near future, a sudden rise in sea levels floods the majority of the world and ends human civilization as we know it, forcing humanity to eke a living on what little dry land remains. Natsuki Ikaruga, a boy who lost his mother and his leg in an accident some years earlier, returns disillusioned from a harsh life in the big city to find his old countryside home half-swallowed by the sea. Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts. His only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine. They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there. What they find is not riches or jewels; but a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea. The girl, Atri, is a robot, but is so expressive and human-like that she could easily pass for a real human being. As thanks for salvaging her, Atri declares that she'll serve as Natsuki's leg until the end of the summer. The time they spend together over that summer changes the both of them.\n\nYeah, anybody who has played all of Key's visual novels such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad, or even their kinetic novels like Planetarian, Harmonia and Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild will notice that Atri: My Dear Moments is trying really hard to be a nakige. Specifically a Key-style nakige. Disillusioned, snarky male protagonist? Check. Cheerful cutesy moe main girl who has a tragic past? Check. Countryside town or post-apocalypse setting? Check. Wacky comedy in the first half and sentimental drama in the second half that's engineered to try and wring as much tears out of you as possible? Check. Male lead and main girl fall in love and their romance is doomed to end in possible tragedy depending on the choices you make? Check. Main girl is secretly dying? Double check! Atri: My Dear Moments is basically just a Key game in all but name, complete with replicating their narrative structure and plot beats to the point where they're virtually identical. It wouldn't surprise me if it turned out one of the devs at Frontwing, Makura, or even Aniplex.exe went up to one of the Key devs and said \"Hey, can we copy your homework?\" Don't go into this one expecting anything original.\n\nBut straight up borrowing from Key's output isn't the only problem Atri: My Dear Moments has. Atri as a game has 13-15 hours worth of content to go through, and you're only given three choices throughout. Granted, this makes it really easy to unlock both the good and bad endings, but because the choices themselves are really spread out across the game, it really affects the pacing. The game moves at a snail's pace because a good chunk of Atri just consists of the cast just goofing around, going to school, and doing mundane things, some of which are really redundant and repetitive, no better than filler. Atri spends most of its run pretty much ignoring its main plot until the last third. Atri could have either cut out several superfluous scenes or added in more choices to break up the pacing a bit. Speaking of superfluous, did we REALLY need a dumb comedy scene involving Natsuki slipping in the pool and falling face first into Minamo's boobs? And having Atri accuse Natsuki of cheating on her (Atri) because of this? Good lord, I thought visual novels outgrew the need to throw in unnecessary crass comedy like this. Stuff like that is not funny, and it will never be funny! There's also a one-note villain whose only purpose is to be shoehorned into the last third of the game to create drama and then disappears afterward. There were other ways the game could have explored Atri's backstory, and it didn't need a throwaway villain just to do that. There are also times the game makes things way too convenient for itself just because the plot demands it. \"Hey, I'm trying to learn about my grandmother and Atri throughout the entire game! Oh, what's this? Here's a random diary that contains everything I ever need to know at just the right moment, even though I searched my tiny boat home 300 times and never saw it before now!\" See what I mean?\n\nAll that being said, Atri: My Dear Moments isn't a bad game, and it does have its flashes of brilliance every now and then. For one, I really liked all the scenes involving Natsuki and friends doing salvaging and working together to create a generator. Both were genuinely interesting, the latter especially, and Atri did a great job at getting me invested in seeing these kids trying to make life easier for themselves and make the best of a bad situation. If stuff like Girls Last Tour and Tasogare-Boshi no Sui to Neri taught me anything, it's that stories about the apocalypse don't always have to be high octane blood-pumping action or super angsty melodramas all the time. Atri understands this to an extent, and tackles its bleak setting with cautious optimism without the need for emo melodrama. Even though the characters by themselves are rather rote stereotypes, they all fill in for each other nicely, and I enjoyed the bond they all shared. It helps that the characters are a variety of different ages and personalities. I also really liked Natsuki as a main character, not just for the development he receives and his growth throughout the game, but that his disability is actually treated with the gravity and sensitivity it deserves. Disabled protagonists are rare in games like this, and I appreciate that the game treats him with respect and doesn't try to sugarcoat or downplay the problems that come with it, as Natsuki's lack of a leg makes it really hard for him to do stuff, even with a prosthetic. Granted, I'm not an amputee so I'm probably not qualified to speak on the authenticity of his portrayal here. But after playing One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e and having to deal with the absolutely repugnant asshat that was Kouhei Orihara, I'll take Natsuki any day of the week. Seriously, comparing Natsuki and Kouhei as VN protags is like choosing between eating chocolate cake and Tide Pods.\n\nNot to mention the absolutely stunning visuals and artwork. From the backgrounds and CGs to the character portraits, all of them are drawn and rendered in great detail. Seriously, you could frame every one of those CGs and backgrounds and hang them up on your wall, they're that good, even if the character designs are pretty much your standard anime designs, with Atri really leaning hard into the cutesy moe aesthetic. The music is nice too, and the opening number is a real bop. The ending theme, on the other hand, I'm less enthused about, mainly because...I'm sorry to say this, but Atri's seiyuu, Hikaru Akao, really isn't a good singer. Her acting is fine, but her using her squeaky voice to sing just really grates on my ears. Anybody who hates hearing women trying to sound like screechy little girls will want to put the ending song on mute.\n\nAtri: My Dear Moments as a visual novel isn't much to write home about, and it's pretty clear this is baby's first visual novel for Aniplex.exe as a company/brand. It's surprising how popular this is in Japan because it's getting an anime coming this summer. I do plan on watching it just to see how it'll adapt the story to actual animation, but I doubt much will change. I enjoyed my time with Atri: My Dear Moments, even if I feel parts of it could have been better. Aniplex.exe has put out more VNs since Atri, and they even announced a new one that's in development, Tanetsumi no Uta. I bought Adabana Odd Tales today, so look forward to a review of that in the future, and I really want to check out Hirahira Hihiru, but sadly it's not on the Switch, nor can my computer run it. Here's hoping they make more visual novels in the future, and fans will have Atri: My Dear Moments to thank for bringing in the money for Aniplex.exe to do so.\n\nThis review was just written today.\n\nRating: 89/100\n\nI've mentioned before that when I was younger, the only video games I played were Pokemon or Kirby games, and even those were only limited to whatever handheld console my family could afford to get me. But even without those limitations, I refused to play any game that wasn't Pokemon or Kirby, thinking all other games were too hard. While I started to branch out of this around 2009-2010, which was the Nintendo DS era, it wouldn't be until I grew up and got a job that I could actually afford to buy other consoles and other games. Now, as a 31 year old adult, I've since then played a large variety of games, more so than I ever did when I was younger. So if someone were to tell my younger self that they'd be head over heels for a game called Another Code Recollection, kid me probably would have called them an idiot. Another Code, retitled Trace Memory in the US, was a Nintendo DS game that was completely off my radar back when it first came out, and kid me wouldn't have given it a second glance. So when a complete remake called Another Code Recollection was announced in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct, I actually was genuinely interested, and I enjoyed playing the demo, so I went and bought the game. Man, I sure am glad I did, because Another Code Recollection has to be one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played in 2024, and this is coming from someone who normally isn't drawn to mystery or puzzle games.\n\nTo note, Another Code Recollection is actually a remake of two games, with the sequel, once made for the Wii, never coming to the US. Both games center on a young teenage girl named Ashley. The first half, titled Two Memories (Which Trace Memory is based on), follows Ashley the day before her fourteenth birthday as she finds herself receiving a package with a mysterious device called the DAS, and a letter saying that her father, who she once thought deceased, is actually alive and wants to reconnect with her. The DAS itself contains a message urging her to meet him at a mysterious place called Blood Edward Island. Her Aunt Jessica convinces her to take the trip and figure out what happened to her old man all those years ago, a quest that becomes all the more strange when she finds herself encountering the ghost of a young boy named D, who is trying to uncover the secrets of his own past as well. The second game, Journey Into Lost Memories, which was originally the Wii game, follows Ashley two years later as she is invited to the resort town of Lake Juliet, a scenic locale that also happens to be the location of a mysterious trip Ashley's mother Sayoko made years ago before her untimely death.\n\nThe bulk of Another Code's gameplay consists of exploration, finding stuff, and solving puzzles. You do everything from placing figurines on a box, arranging books in a particular order, pressing buttons to unlock doors, and moving a remote controlled boat, all of which are important for progressing the game's narrative. Whether it be using motion controls, cryptography, deduction, memory, Another Code is not short on methods to solve the puzzles and obstacles that hinder Ashley's journey for the truth. One thing Recollection introduces that wasn't in the original games was a hint system, where you can choose between a vague hint so you can solve it yourself or straight up having the answer be given to you, making it friendly for both newcomers and veterans alike. As somebody who both hasn't played the original games and is really bad at mystery games, I really appreciated this feature, especially as some puzzles were a little too daunting for me to figure out. I know one puzzle in the original DS game involved having you partially close the DS to reflect a photo on the bottom of the screen, which is just...really unintuitive. Who thought that was a good idea? I'm glad the developers at the now dissolved Cing nixed this when it came time to remake the game for the Switch. Honestly, the only puzzles in Another Code that I disliked were the one involving the remote controlled boat and any of the security code input puzzles that required you to press the literal joy stick. Or was it? Seriously, I could never get the hang of the latter. Recollection also threw in little easter eggs like origami cranes that, if scanned, unlock journal entries fleshing out one of the overarching characters in the game, though many of them are hard to find, and an unlockable costume upon beating the game that allows Ashley to play through the events of Two Memories in her original Trace Memory outfit.\n\nBut more than the gameplay, Another Code hooked me with both its characters and its story. I'm a sucker for story/character-driven media, video games included, and Another Code did an amazing job at fleshing out its characters across both games. Ashley is a great, refreshing, compelling protagonist who is able to carry the stories across both games perfectly while still being believably flawed like any teenage girl her age would be. It helps that while the game explores some fantastical concepts, its whole approach to it all is surprisingly down-to-earth, feeling a lot less stereotypically tropey and...well, \"anime\" than most Japanese games tend to be. This extends to the characters and their overall writing, all of whom also feel very grounded and down-to-earth even as they deal with ghosts and memory-erasing machines straight out of a sci-fi novel. The entire cast of characters all have their own motivations, backgrounds, and personal histories that make them feel like more than just NPCs and feel fresh. Hell, this game got me to care about an old guy who runs a restaurant, for God's sake! Now, I haven't played the original DS game, but I hear the English localization of Trace Memory made Ashley a lot more whiny and mean than in the original, and thankfully, her portrayal in Recollection across both halves don't give off that vibe. Another Code has excellent writers that spun a compelling narrative across the game's two halves, delivering solid build-up, excellent characterization, and conclusions that felt both intelligent and believable while pushing the characters further in terms of their development. Not only that, the writers even went as far as to add in some content that wasn't present in the original games to wrap up loose plot threads and completely rewrite parts of it to have them make more sense.\n\nOne point of praise I absolutely must give to Another Code is for how it fleshed out its setting, mainly for Journey Into Lost Memories. Two Memories already delivered very nicely on fleshing out its setting through the mystery that resulted in Blood Edward Island being what it is, but they really went all out in making Lake Juliet feel like a real place with an actual storied history, customs, traditions, and so on, and it actually felt like a living, breathing community. It does help that the graphics are pretty to look at, even if they're not on the level of AAA games. I haven't played the original DS game, but I do know that Trace Memory's art style is very different from the remake, and that Recollection pretty much redid everything from the ground up, both to get around the loss of the DS's touch screen controls and streamline the pacing by allowing Ashley to fully interact with her environment as opposed to the original's top-down point and click set-up. The graphics aren't perfect, as trees and bushes have flat boughs that really stick out if you see them from certain angles, but the overall look of Another Code is still really nice.\n\nAs much as I want to exalt Another Code as an undisputed masterpiece, and believe me, I really want to, the game does have its issues. Many of them didn't hurt my enjoyment of it in any way, but I did have some gripes with it. For one, adjusting the camera can be rather awkward, and while you can change the speed at which the camera moves, it can still be a bit of a chore. Not only that, Ashley's default running speed is surprisingly slow. She doesn't move any faster than when she does when she walks, and I wish there was a way you could make her run faster. Furthermore, I did some research on Trace Memory and I found out that while Another Code Recollection does a lot to expand on the original and fix parts of it, the remake also leaves out information about certain characters, like pieces of their backstories. One aspect about a prominent character in Two Memories got hit with this, and while the remake works just fine without it, I really have to question why they left that bit of information out, as it's a part of what informs the circumstances behind said character's death and why Blood Edward Island is deserted. I also learned that a prominent character in Journey Into Lost Memories is made into much more of a sympathetic villain in the remake as opposed to his much more openly antagonistic character in the original Wii game, with his circumstances and overall character being completely rewritten in Recollection. I don't hate this idea, but I am genuinely interested in seeing his original interpretation. Too bad the Wii game never came to the US and I don't want to either shell out the money for a European Wii or potentially brick my Wii U by downloading CFW software into it knowing my complete ineptitude with anything relating to hacking/modding consoles.\n\nHonestly, I did not expect to like Another Code Recollection as much as I do, flaws and all. Child me wouldn't have given the original DS game a second glance, but now that I'm older and expanded my tastes in video games, and media in general, I'm really glad I got to play this. I even bought the original Trace Memory game recently so expect a review of that in the future whenever I get around to playing that. But yeah, Another Code Recollection is one of the most pleasant surprises I ever got to experience in the year of our lord 2024 and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. Seriously, whether you like puzzle/mystery games or story/character driven media, I highly, HIGHLY recommend Another Code Recollection regardless of whether you're already a fan of the series or a complete newcomer. Plus, I hear other games Cing produced, Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and its sequel Last Window, is really good too. I should probably play that some time.\n\nThis review was just written today.\n\nRating: 68/100\n\nNostalgia can be a funny thing. One of the first anime I watched fansubbed was Air, and back then, I didn't know it was based on a video game. I didn't even know what visual novels were at the time. I did really enjoy the anime for what it was to the point where I bought the DVDs for it, and even though it's been years since I've last seen it, I remember it pretty vividly. But the original visual novel was never localized in English in any official capacity, but there were a few fan translations that were made over the years. As of now, I've managed to play one of them in its entirety, specificially the PSP port thanks to finally learning how to use emulators on my PC. Though in light of the fact that after almost 25 years, Key announced that Kanon is finally getting released in the US in English, I think it's only a matter of time before Air gets this treatment since most of Key's other games were released in English as well. Plus, I have been curious about how the original visual novel for Air is compared to the anime, especially since games tend to be longer than their TV adaptations, resulting in a lot of things getting cut. Now that I've finished the visual novel...well, let me put it this way: As you grow up, you can find yourself either liking something you watched/read/played just as much as you did back when you were a kid, realize it's not as good as you thought it was, or appreciate it even more than when you first encountered it. Air as a visual novel is an interesting piece of gaming history and an important game in Key's legacy but...honestly, it made me appreciate the anime adaptation much more.\n\nThe story is the same as the anime adaptation: Traveling street performer Yukito Kunisaki arrives at a small seaside town called Kami, having traversed around Japan in continuation of his late mother's search for the \"girl in the sky\" who, according to a family legend, has been cursed to spend eternity all alone. Yukito's sole way of earning money is by performing a puppet show by moving a doll that has been passed down in his family with magic, but he fails to gain anyone's attention by doing so, and as a result, he's low on money. The next day, he meets Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy high school girl who is eager to become friends with him. He accepts her offer to eat lunch at her home, and Misuzu's aunt and foster mother Haruko Kamio is later persuaded to let him stay for the time being. Later on, Yukito meets two other girls who go to Misuzu's school—sly, friendly Kano Kirishima and serene, quiet Minagi Tohno—who, like Misuzu, have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. Any one of them could be the incarnation of this \"girl in the sky,\" and if the curse isn't broken, the girl in question could die.\n\nI've already mentioned in my review of the anime that I never had a problem with Itaru Hinoue's character designs and I still don't even now. I can see why some people might find them weird and off-putting, but honestly, I've seen way worse. Ijime, anyone? Plus, if anything, Hinoue's art actually improved significantly since her work on Kanon, as while the eyes on her characters are still big, they don't feel as much like they're consuming the entirety of the characters' faces a lot of the time. The graphics themselves are fine for what they are. The character sprites are well designed and have a variety of different expressions, the CGs are well made and can be absolutely amazing when the time calls for it, and the backgrounds are nice, too. I did notice that some CGs have the characters rendered in really odd proportions, but those were pretty rare. Again, the music is great and fits the mood and atmosphere of the game, and again, Tori no Uta is a great opening song. What else is there to say about Air's soundtrack that hasn't been said already?\n\nOh boy, here's the part where I start to get critical, and don't get me wrong, I want to enjoy Air's VN more than I do, especially since I really like the anime. But if I'm being honest, I think the anime version is the better product because I won't lie, the VN is very, very flawed. First off, Air has the same problem as One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e where a lot of scenes and conversations feel like needless filler shoehorned in just to pad out the game and make it longer, often coming across as extremely repetitve like Key thinks they can't trust their audience to remember what went on a few seconds ago. Seriously, there's so much of the game that feels like you could cut out and nothing would be lost. Minagi's route in particular has this the worst, as a lot of her route consists of spamming through constant ellipses and pointless conversations that don't really go anywhere, really slowing down the pacing. It's a good thing the anime cut out a lot of the unnecessary fat from the game to make it feel more tight and streamlined.\n\nSpeaking of which, the overall story is fine, as the mystery behind the curse of the girl in the sky is interesting and compelling, and Misuzu's route, both her normal and true route, are definitely the best parts of the entire visual novel in terms of how everything comes together in the end. Actually, say what you will about Misuzu as a character, you can argue she's a moeblob all you want, but she and Haruko are the best parts of the whole game, with Haruko being the most complex, compelling, three-dimensional character out of the entire cast...though you can't see what she's really like unless you've unlocked the true route. But in order to unlock said true route, you have to go through all three of the girls' routes and get all of their good endings, which unlocks the summer route, which tells the origin of the girl in the sky and explains the overarching mystery, and completing that unlocks the true route. Now, I have no issue with playing through different routes to unlock what's considered the best one. Lots of visual novels do this, with AI: The Somnium Files and Code:Realize being two of them. However, in Air's case, the road to getting there is a real grind. Kano's route feels the most superfluous in that she has no connection to the overarching narrative, and like I mentioned in my review of the anime, she feels like she's just there to be a red herring. Many players think Minagi's route is the worst, mainly in that it feels way too long, and while I disagree on it being the worst, I agree that it really needed to be cut down by several hours.\n\nActually, this is a good segue into talking about the characters, because anyone who's not Misuzu contribute to the game's biggest flaws. First off, as someone who watched the anime first, I do NOT remember Yukito being this much of a pathetic loser. He had his moments in the anime, sure, but they were relegated to just a few scenes and that's it, and he's much more assertive and put-together in the anime. Here he spends so much of the game being either yelled at, assaulted, or dunked on by pretty much everyone around him, often for things that are either not his fault or for no reason at all, usually by Hijiri or Michiru. Speaking of which, Air as a visual novel really fails in writing comedy, mainly because its idea of humor consists of having characters jump to conclusions about Yukito, assuming the worst about him, or constantly attacking him over literally nothing. Michiru is especially guilty of this, and she is REALLY annoying in this game. She had her moments in the anime, sure, but they were never as pervasive or overly mean-spirited as they are here. Their whole first encounter literally goes like this: \"Oh noes, this random stranger just looked at me! That must mean he's a kidnapper/pervert even though there's nothing actually proving it! I'm gonna attack him for funsies and keep doing so every time I see him!\" No, game, this is not funny, it will never be funny, and please don't have it be the backbone of literally every single comedic scene in your entire game! Hell, one scene early in Kano's route has Yukito helping Kano after she gets possessed, but when Hijiri comes upon them, the first thing she does is assume Yukito sexually assaulted her, gives him no chance to explain himself, and acts so disproportionately hostile towards him that you'd think she saw him commit a whole-ass genocide and tries to gut him with scalpels. Granted, Yukito doesn't really help himself with his explanation being the most vague, easy to misinterpret thing ever, but come on. I'm just so sick of the whole playing physical violence as comedy towards a character who's done nothing to deserve any of it shtick. It's old, it's cliche, it's tasteless, and a dead horse that really should have been left alone years ago. I'm really glad the anime both toned down and excised a lot of these moments, because it makes the characters much more likeable. One other thing I'm happy the anime toned down is the girls' overall moeness. You know how in Kanon some of the girls had cutesy but annoying verbal tics or catchphrases, like Ayu's infamous \"uguu\"? Air has them too. Misuzu's \"gao\" noises make sense, but Kano's \"ununu\" and Michiru's constant \"Wapupu! Hmmmni? Mumumu! Nyo-whatever!\" all got old and annoying after the first three times, and again, the anime cuts them out, making them feel more like people than just bug-eyed overgrown kindergarteners.\n\nAdding onto this, Air as a visual novel is definitely a product of its time, but even without its overreliance on moe archetypes and cringy physical humor, it has a lot of jokes that would absolutely NOT fly in today's modern age which, again, the anime left out, and for good reason. There's quite a few homophobic jokes made at the expense of gay people (Especially gay men), there are a lot of stuff some male characters say to their female friends that would absolutely quality as sexual harassment, and it even plays sexual assault and victim blaming for comedy, which is just really tasteless and offensive. There's a scene in the summer route where Ryuuya touches Kanna's butt without her consent, and she rightfully gets mad at him, but it's not only treated as her throwing a childish tantrum, the whole thing is just brushed off with \"Oh, this random stranger touched your butt? You must not have covered yourself up properly! LOLZ!\" Good lord, do I even need to explain just how awful this is? We do not need sexual assault and victim blaming being played for juvenile anime comedy, thank you! Again, I'm so glad the anime version cut these parts out and made Ryuuya much less of a pervert. One would think Key/Visual Arts would have learned their lesson about this, but considering Summer Pockets has a minigame where one of the prizes you get is a pair of panties owned by a 12-year-old girl (Who is secretly the male MC's daughter!) and way too many scenes involving the male MC constantly walking in on one of the girls as she's changing to the point where it's a running gag...ugh, end me now. Well, to be fair, Key has learned their lesson about incest romances, what with their most recent announcements about their newest game Anemoi, so I'll give them that.\n\nMan, it sucks that I couldn't enjoy the visual novel for Air, but if anything, it makes me appreciate the anime all the more because the staff for the anime adaptation knew what to keep and what to leave out, making the anime a much better and more rewarding experience while still keeping the important qualities that make Air what it is. If you're a Key fan and are already into their stuff, Air's VN is definitely up your alley, but I wouldn't consider the visual novel to be a good one, as there are several that I like way better. If anything, visual novels have evolved since Air's conception, with many of them evolving past their sort of origins as moe waifu porn games. I personally wouldn't recommend this one, especially not for those wanting to get into the format for the first time. If anything, I recommend you just stick to the TV anime, as it remedies a lot of the game's flaws and cuts out a lot of the more questionable parts. If Air is to get an official English localization, I might buy it just for the sake of both supporting the visual novel industry and owning a piece of gaming history, but that's it. I already bought the Switch port of Kanon in preparation for the English translation patch that'll be applied to it in the near future, so expect a review of that in the coming months. But overall, Air's visual novel is an important piece of gaming history, but it's a very flawed game that really could have benefited from some extra polish and cutting of a lot of its extraneous filler.\n\nThis review was just written today.\n\nRating: 53/100\n\nRacism is a really tricky thing to write about in any capacity. There's a lot you can't afford to get wrong, whether you're writing for kids or adults. Seeing as I'm a white woman, I know that no matter how much I learn about racism in school or study up on it, it's nothing compared to actually experiencing racism firsthand, as many marginalized groups can tell you. One of America's most famous writers, Judy Blume, attempted to address the issue in one of her first books, Iggie's House. Yes, she wrote this in 1970, before she would churn out hits like Blubber and Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, and...not gonna lie, re-reading it now, it really shows. Every writer has to start somewhere, and sometimes that start isn't always perfect. Literally every creative person in the world can tell you this firsthand, me included. But even with that, Iggie's House just isn't a very good book, mainly because of just how terribly it tackles racism and tries to spout anti-racism morals when it does everything wrong in doing so.\n\nEleven-year-old Winifred Barringer aka Winnie is having a tough time. Her best friend Iggie moved to Tokyo, and now a new family is moving into her old house. Despite this, Winnie decides she'll befriend the new neighbors and give them a chance. Winnie meets the new neighbors, the Garbers, and is surprised to find that they're people of color, which makes things complicated because Winnie's hometown is primarily a white neighborhood. Winnie does her best to try to befriend them, but is completely oblivious to the fact that after the racism they've already been enduring, especially from the nosy town gossip Mrs. Landon, they're not too keen on trusting some white girl. Oh, and in case you're wondering, despite the character's name being in the literal title, Iggie herself never even appears in the book, so one has to wonder why it's even called that when Blume can't even be bothered to do anything with Iggie as a character. Considering this is one of Blume's first ever long books, it's easy to see that her prose reflects this. It's extremely simplistic, almost bordering on beige, and any attempts she makes to spice it up just make it come across as dated. One thing about it that really annoyed me was her constant usage of \"yick.\" Like...is that even a real word? Why not replace it with \"Yuck\"? That's not only an actual word, but does a much better job at expressing disgust. But I'm willing to forgive this somewhat, as this was her first time doing this, and her prose in later novels would be much better and more witty, though I admit I haven't read all of her bibliography.\n\nSimilarly, her characters aren't much better. They're all a bunch of bland, cliche stereotypes with no real depth or development whatsoever. Winnie is your naive everygirl who thinks the world revolves around her, her parents are your typical 60s/70s parents, Mrs. Landon is the neighborhood gossip who's just there to be the villain, so on and so forth. I actually wish the Garbers had been the main characters since they were actually somewhat interesting, and since the book is about racism and integration, and they're subject to both, it'd make the themes and messages all the more palpable. Honestly, Blume's decision to have Winnie, a white girl, be the main character in a story that's clearly meant to be about racism towards African-Americans, was her first mistake. But the biggest problem with Iggie's House is that its attempts at espousing an anti-racism message fall completely flat in several ways. Example one: The first time Winnie meets the Garber kids, she immediately stereotypes them, asking if they're from Africa or if they participated in the 1965 LA riots, assuming they're violent savages. For all of Winnie's claims that she wants to make a good impression, she failed. HARD. Example two: She claims she wants to be friends with them, but she never actually listens to them or makes an effort to get to know them beyond the fact that they're just a bunch of black kids and using them as props for her own self-gain, which Herbie calls her out on, so she comes off like a White Savior.\n\nBut here's the thing that really cements just how badly Iggie's House depicts racism: Iggie's House wants us to see Winnie as being in the right. That scene I mentioned earlier about Herbie calling Winnie out on her not treating them like regular people and using them as props to make herself feel good? Right afterward, Winnie gets mad and slaps Herbie, claiming that he just hates white people despite Herbie and his family having legitimate, justified reasons for not wanting to associate with white people or trust Winnie, and that they're awful people for not accepting her friendship. This whole thing reads like victim blaming. \"Oh, you've been discriminated against and treated like shit by people because of your skin color all your lives and experienced all sorts of trauma from it? Boo hoo, it's your own fault for not trying to make friends with us and not appreciating all that we're doing for you!\" Do you see what I mean? Furthermore, Winnie's views are never challenged. Her mother yells at her for trying to pursue a cause, but that's it. Winnie's own racism is never challenged, nor does she ever realize or accept that she's only hurting the Garbers more than helping them. Actually, this also begs the question: Why does nobody throw Winnie out of the house, or even yell at her after she slaps Herbie? No sibling I know would ever just stand by and watch as some girl beats up their sibling! If my big sister found out that some kid was bullying me, she'd waste no time going after them and wanting their heads on a platter! And for that matter, why would the Garbers even want to continue associating with Winnie after that? The Garbers have every right to be angry at Winnie. Seriously, Iggie's House would be so much better if the Garbers were the protagonists instead of Winnie. Winnie mainly just comes off as a whiny brat who doesn't get her way.\n\nThe ending isn't all that good either, having the Barringers and Garbers go on a picnic and act all happy happy, which magically erases racism forevers and evers! Uuuuugh. Gag me. Why did I buy this book years ago again? So yeah, even as a white woman, even I found myself cringing at the benign racism in Iggie's House, and that's really not a good thing if you're trying to write a book that speaks against racism. But even without that, Iggie's House is just a generic kids book that's trying way too hard and comes off like a half-baked after school special. I recommend skipping this one, as there are much better books out there that tackle racism and integration in a much better, far less offensive manner, many written by people of color. Go seek those out, and steer clear of Iggie's House. Seriously.\n\nThis review was just written today, and boy am I glad to finally be able to talk about this game.\n\nRating: 84/100\n\nAs of mid-2024, a good majority of the games Key/Visual Arts have put out are legally available in English, with the exceptions of Air, Kud Wafter, their Prima Doll kinetic novels, the Rewrite fan disc, and Summer Pockets: Reflection Blue. Before 2015, it was nigh impossible to procure their games outside of fan translations, but now almost their entire library is available. Hell, just a few weeks ago, their first visual novel, Kanon, FINALLY got an official English translation and release in the US, 25 years after its 1999 release. Now that I've played a good majority of their games—mainly their kinetic novels—and seen anime adaptations of the ones I haven't played, I've gotten a bit familiar with their formula. I like the anime adaptations of Air, Kanon, and Clannad, but haven't played the VNs for the latter two yet. The game version of Air, while an important piece of Key's legacy, has a lot of problematic aspects that really did not age well; Harmonia is fairly good but a big chunk of its lore doesn't make sense, Loopers suffers from not doing enough with both its large cast of characters and premise, and while I enjoyed Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild, it only started getting good in the second half, and the first half of the game is a bit of a climb. I have mixed feelings on the games of theirs that I have played, but that's not to say I hated them. There are two that I genuinely enjoyed without any reservations: Planetarian, their first kinetic novel, and the subject of today's review, Stella of the End.\n\nThe story goes as follows: The world has been almost completely decimated by gigantic automatons known as Singularity Machines, to the point where humanity is on the brink of extinction. Jude Gray is a stoic, disillusioned man who works as a courier, traversing the dangerous wilds in search of whatever items or treasures he can deliver to high paying clients. One day, he receives a job offer from an old man calling himself Duke Willem Grosvenor. Willem wants Jude to deliver some cargo for him, but it's not just any cargo. Willem claims this cargo can help him save humanity. After some convincing, Jude accepts the job offer and goes into some ruins to find the cargo Willem wants. What he finds is not what he expects: An android made to resemble a young girl, and when she awakes, the first thing she mentions is that she wishes to become human. Put off by how life-like she is considering her nature as a machine and her childish, idealistic personality, Jude gives her the name Philia. Faced with no choice but to deliver her to her intended destination, Jude and Philia must traverse the hostile wilderness together, avoiding threats both mechanical and human. What awaits Jude and Philia at the end of the road? Can humanity really be saved, or is it already too late...?\n\nI'm going to make a bold statement here, and I know not everyone is going to agree with me, and that's fine. But in my opinion, Stella of the End is Key's best kinetic novel. At least, out of the games of theirs that I've played. One of the reasons I feel this is the case is that Stella of the End really goes against Key's usual formula. Sure, you have the disillusioned, stoic male protagonist and a younger, cuter female co-star, with the game focusing on their interactions and fleshing them out as the story goes on. Key has always made it a point to have their games focus on small scale, character driven dramas, but one of the things I find that I don't like is that they have a tendency to shoehorn in really cringy, problematic, out of place humor that would either ruin the mood of a scene or just feel unnecessary, to the point where you could cut it out and nothing would be lost. I discovered this recently in the VN for Air, where there were more than a few scenes involving characters groping other girls' breasts, even among family members! Did we really need that? Or Summer Pockets' whole running gag about it's MC constantly walking in on one girl changing her clothes almost every time they see each other. Being a much smaller game with a tighter focus on its narrative and a very miniscule cast of characters, none of that is present in Stella of the End, and whatever moments of levity in the game are not only much fewer, but hit the mark much better in that its moments of comedy never goes for the lowest common denominator, and make sense for the characters.\n\nFurthermore, compared to previous kinetic novels like Planetarian and Harmonia, Stella of the End is much darker in its themes and atmosphere. The story does a great job in selling just how desolate and decimated this world is through both its lush, gorgeous artwork courtesy of artist SWAV and how the various people Jude and Philia encounter throughout their journey cope with their unique situations. If I were to make a comparsion, I'd compare Stella of the End to Girls' Last Tour, as both stories are focused on how their respective pairs of MCs navigate the world around them and make the most of the situations they're in. Granted, Stella has much higher stakes, is more violent and bleak, and has a more concrete goal compared to GLT, but they still prove that apocalypse stories don't always have to be just explosions and constant misery all the time. Speaking of artwork, I really need to talk about the backgrounds because they are just utterly gorgeous. You could frame every single one of them and hang them up on the wall, they're that amazing! Hell, the game is aware of this and has a gallery specifically for the backgrounds! The CGs and character designs are both great in their own right, and I really appreciate that Jude actually looks and acts like a rugged, ragged adult man as opposed to an adult man who just looks like a baby-faced teenager. The mech designs are also really good too, and wouldn't feel out of place in something like Planetarian or even a Gundam series.\n\nOf course, the real backbone of Stella of the End is its main pair of characters. Now, Key has used these particular archetypes multiple times throughout their games, but here, the entire game is taken up by Jude and Philia, with very few side characters. As far as their development goes, Key really knocked it out of the park, as Jude and Philia, while starting out like rote stereotypes, really grow and come into their own throughout the game, especially near the end, becoming wonderfully evolved characters with plenty of strengths and flaws to carry the game perfectly. Jude in particular is especially well developed, a man who is inured by his circumstances and haunted by the decisions he was forced to make throughout his life. That said, your enjoyment of the game will depend on how much you can stomach Philia. She's your typical cutesy moe Key girl at first; benevolent, childish, naive, and meant to endear the audience with her cutesiness, and it takes quite a while for her to really grow past her early character flaws. I personally had no problem with her, as the game does call her out whenever she causes problems for Jude, with one particular chapter being really brutal in how it does so, and I've seen far worse characters who not only don't learn from their mistakes but are worshipped like hell in the series they originate from. But I can see plenty of people not being too fond of Philia for those same reasons, especially with how long it takes for her to finally grow a spine and stop acting like a pampered princess.\n\nI will admit, there are a few things about Stella of the End that do hold it back from true greatness in my opinion, and are really more personal preference than anything. For one, I really don't like the dialogue interface in this game. It just looks weird having this ugly green filter cover the entire screen while the characters are talking. When it comes to visual novels, or whatever games utilize them in general, I prefer the usual dialogue boxes that just stay at the bottom of the screen, or the occasional stylistic choice, over having it take up the entire screen and covering the beautiful visuals. I know the original version of Harmonia had this issue in the original PC release, but at least there, they put dialogue boxes on the side of the screen as opposed to having it take up all of it, and later changed this in the Switch re-release. Granted, Stella does allow you to reduce the opacity to basically nothing, getting rid of the green filter, but unless you have the game covering your entire computer screen, it presents another problem in that the text becomes hard to read, especially against bright or white backgrounds. If Stella of the End ever comes out on the Switch, I really hope they change it so that they put dialogue boxes on the bottom of the screen. Also, while I do feel Stella of the End has the best worldbuilding and lore out of all their kinetic novels, it does have the same problem as their other games in that not a lot of said lore makes sense if you think about it and really relies on you stretching your sense of disbelief quite a bit. The actual story reveals were interesting, but I do wish more had been done with them, especially in regards to how sentient AIs work, and a few little things scattered throughout the game don't get any explanations behind them.\n\nBut Stella of the End isn't interested in exploring the ethics of AI or doing a deep dive into robots and how they work, it's all about the journey Jude and Philia go on, seeing the world's beauty and ugliness and making the most of the time they have together even as the odds seem stacked against them. Oh, and for anyone wondering, there's no romance in this game at all, so don't worry, Jude and Philia don"
