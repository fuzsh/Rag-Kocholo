        "text": "As a mercenary and leader of the international crime cartel known as the Black Dragon, Kano rises beyond mere brutality and aggression by also being sly and cunning. Originally from Australia, Kano is highly opportunistic and incredibly selfish, willing to betray his own realm and even his own allies for money or personal gain. As a result, he quickly became part of Shao Kahn's inner circle, and eventually the general of Outworld's armies (in the original timeline). One of his more notable features is his facetious and twisted sense of humor, almost always making light of dire circumstances. His vulgarity is an additional outlier among other characters, most evident by his penchant for callously spitting, drinking and urinating wherever he pleases. His assortment of dirty fighting tactics also compliments his unpleasant personality. He combines features of a cowardly minion, a lone survivor, a crazed madman, and a ruthless commander. He is despised by the majority of other characters in the series for his selfish, untrustworthy nature, complete lack of morals, and overall crudeness. However, he seems to enjoy the fact that he is hated, even viewing it as a source of pride. He is the archenemy of Sonya Blade, who is obsessed with finding and bringing Kano to justice because he brutally murdered her partner, Daniel Sanchez. Kano possesses a bionic eye, the result of a disfiguring injury he sustained at the hands of Jax prior to the Earthrealm Tournament. His eye has a glowing red orb capable of emitting laser beams and hacking technological barriers. After the death of Lieutenant Sanchez, Jax lost it. He grabbed Kano saying \"Gotcha\", punched Kano's right eye 32 times which shattered the skull and had Kano's eye hanging out of its socket. Kano set off an explosive which Jax barely escaped from, the blast blew off Kano's own eye and a chunk of his skull.\n\nBackstory:\n\nJerome Kano was born in Australia to a terrible upbringing, his parents were abusive drug addicts who traumatized young Jerome for years. He was taken off them by child services but the transport vehicle was attacked and robbed by criminals on the way to the safe location. Kano was raised on the streets from then on and learned to live the life of a thug. Kano excelled at a life crime and soon, he enjoyed causing pain and suffering to other people. Kano outgrew his teenage crime gang and left on a ship to the USA. He immediately caused a stir when he confronted a gang that was well known in the streets of New York city. Kano single handedly fought them off and impressed their leader, Rojack, so much that he disbanded the group and began following Kano's lead. Kano gathered a core group that included Kabal, Tasia, No Face, Tremor and Jarek. Kano brutally murdered Sonya Blade's partner, Lt. Daniel Sanchez with a knife in his mouth then had No Face burn his remains. Despite possessing a healthy heart, Kano requested that The Doctor improved his abilities. The Doctor implanted Kano with a stabilized, Cybernetic heart. Meaning the heart remained perfectly in place, while allowing Kano's body to roll in place around it. Giving Kano his signature move, the Kanoball.\n\nRecent Events:\n\nThe Earthrealm Tournament: Kano lures Sonya Blade to the tournament The Outworld Tournament: Kano The Earthrealm Invasion: The Revenant Excursion: Kano cuts off a piece of Sonya's hair and keeps it for his own sick pleasure.
