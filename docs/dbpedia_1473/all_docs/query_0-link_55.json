        "text": "Videogames have come a long way from Super Mario Bros and Pong. After thirthy years of technological advancements and academic criticisms, videogames have become a fertile ground for social change and virtual identity creation. Where big gam companies like Bioware, Bethesda, and Rockstar Games have begun to include more inclusive narratives, independent game companies are beginning to delve into the field of ' serious games', capitalising on the popularity and prevalence of social networking to inspire and assist non-game-related fields. While all of this is happening, a new subculture has become to dominate social media: that of the fanboy and the Let's Play YouTube video phenomenon. It is a dynamic time in videogame studies, from the perspective of player, designer and theorist. However, with the advent of virtual reality, the question remains: where will videogames, and subsequently or society, 'level up' to next ?\n\nThis study examines perceptions of sense of community as well as commitment and trust within virtual communities, specifically, a virtual community (VC) provided and facilitated by PC videogame developers releasing a free-to-play game undergoing continuous updates on the gaming platform Steam. In addition, the study examines whether a consumer will likely recommend or utilize electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) review and if there is a relationship between commitment and trust during this decision-making process. The findings will indicate if VC management affects commitment and trust, influences eWOM, and ultimately, impacts overall player base for free-to-play gaming projects. Evolve: Stage 2 will serve as the videogame variable for this study. Keywords: PC Gaming; Virtual Community; Commitment-Trust Theory; Electronic Word-Of-Mouth; Sense of Community, Relational Marketing\n\nThis study explores the ways in which certain societal anxieties regarding femininity and masculinity surface in post-apocalyptic video games BioShock (2007 2K Games) and The last of us (2013 Naughty Dog). A postfeminist perspective is employed in order to explore the privileging of so-called ‘masculine values’ in late neo-liberal societies, and the subsequent negation of the (seemingly) binary opposite of stereotypical femininity. This explorative study is situated within a broad framework of postfeminism, and focuses on providing alternative understandings of the representation of gender in video games. By considering video games as a medium that is firmly rooted in traditional masculinity, I argue that anxieties regarding the subordination of so-called ‘feminine values’ in society as a whole, manifest visually in BioShock and The last of us, in both the gameplay as well as in narrative structure. In an attempt to gain a better understanding of how these anxieties surface, I explo...\n\nThe paper offers an investigation into terms like “dudebro”, “bro shooter” and “bro gaming”, which entered regular usage on English-language gaming websites in around 2011. The author analyses a series of discourses surrounding these terms, and their role in the maintenance of a subcultural gamer identity in the face of newly emergent markets of more mainstream players. By concentrating on journalistic (and some industrial) representations of a subgroup of male players, the paper hopes to contribute to existing research on player identities by showing how social class affects not only the material dimension of access to technology, but also the values involved in being the “type of gamer” to whom much videogame journalism is addressed. Existing research on gaming and social class in Europe finds that working-class masculinity is often associated with a preference for communal play of predominantly Anglophone sports, racing and military shooting genres. This set of tastes contrasts with the games often celebrated within the enthusiast press (and sometimes overrepresented in games studies academia) namely MMOs, single-player RPGs, games from Japan, and narrative-heavy games in sci-fi or fantasy settings. However, in American journalistic accounts, the former set of preferences is more frequently associated with a middle-class (or upwardly mobile) university “frat boy” identity; a possible misassociation which only a few journalistic voices have challenged. Through an application of sociological theories of taste, I argue that the tension between subcultural “geeky” and mainstream “bro-ish” game preferences is key to understanding the social dynamics at work in the faction of “gamer culture” represented by popular games websites.\n\nVideo games are increasingly becoming an important media today, despite the light connota-tion of its initial categorization. Today they are an industry that produces billions of dollars and employs engineers and artists alike in an art form spanning interactive games, to virtual socie-ties where millions of people dwell. However, like all human products, our same fears, flaws and xenophobia show in the games, with the reflection of hatred, racism and stereotypes that are our everyday experience. Also, because of the influence of other media, like television, with misrepresentations of blacks, Latinos and other races, or the objectification of women are pre-sent in video games. The significant thing found researching for this assignment is that most of those who use these games are themselves part of minorities or races that are not exactly white Americans. Abuse of the frustrations and desires of the user, handling codes and the system an-swers of gamers to maintain the player engagement, has more resemblance to the use of illegal drugs than with art, but however, the complexity of the design, stories and global assessment, have led to other considerations by experts. Competing in the games could be considered as having more of escapism that the reality of engaging, but all human beings are expected in their tribes to compete and demonstrate their value as a member while complying with social norms or expectations. Same as satisfying or surrender to corporate or group interests. Here are some thoughts for the purpose of this study."
