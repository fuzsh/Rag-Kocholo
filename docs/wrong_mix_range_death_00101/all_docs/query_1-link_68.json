        "text": "CHAPTER 1: RED DIAPER BABY\n\nWashington, DC -- 1942\n\nBaby Joe\n\nJoe was named after Joseph Stalin in the days before everyone realized that Stalin was an insane maniac. Joe was born January 1, 1942 in Washington, D.C. to Worden and Florence McDonald. Joe's parents were both on the left side of the ideological fence, and you could probably call them American communists if you wanted to throw around labels.\n\nJoe's grandmother Bella Voronoff was a Russian-Jewish immigrant who had opposed the Czar in Russia in 1905. She and her sister Rose left Russia to seek a new life in Anerica. Bella often took Joe's mom to political meetings in D.C. Oddly enough, Bella also became one of the first female truck drivers in the D.C. area.\n\nJoe's father Worden McDonald grew up in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl and the Depression era. He was a very adventurous young man who had gone to seek his fortune in Alaska. During the 30's, however, Worden began to participate in the American Labor Movement, and his politics took a turn for the left. A few years after his ideals jelled, he met and married Florence. It seemed a perfect match.\n\nI met both Joe's parents in the late 60's after they finally moved to Berkeley from Southern California. I liked them right away and they were always very friendly to me -- Joe had introduced them to me as his Navy pal from Japan. After Joe began to work his way into the music industry, Joe's parents liked to reminisce and relive some of Joe's early musical leanings.\n\nWorden said, \"When Joe was about 10 years old, he played the harmonica, I would ask him if he could play a certain song, and he would always say no. But then he'd say 'well if you could whistle it for me I can play it.' Then he would just play it -- I always thought that was pretty amazing.\"\n\nWorden also said, \"Joe began playing the trombone in school. He liked it right away and started practicing at least three hours a day at home. He got pretty good at it as time went along. When Joe got to high school he had a good sound -- I enjoyed hearing him practice.\"\n\nBesides music, Joe was also a good horse rider in his youth. He could do figure eight's in a gallop in a small corral. The McDonald's had several horses where Joe grew up in El Monte.\n\n\"It seemed that when he wasn't busy with guinea pigs, horses, rabbits or dogs he was taking a music lesson or practicing,\" said Joe's mother, Florence.\n\nJoe grew up in the period during and right after World War II. The country and society was still in shock at the atrocities man could commit. \"Joe was always a very sensitive child his music seemed his link to sanity,\" Florence said.\n\n\"When I was very young I learned from my mother about the death camps for Jews in World War II. My mother and I had many arguments about our heritage. I couldn't not understand how we as non-believers and non-practicing Jews could have been killed for being Jewish if we had lived say in Germany or Russia during WWII.\"\n\n\"When the pogroms come they will find you,\" Joe's mother always said. Joe had nightmares about these things when he was very young. Joe had dreams about being taken away to concentration camps by boogiemen. He had a hard time with these dreams for a long time.\n\n\"Later in life, I realized that I was defined as a Jew by Jew haters not by myself. Also I came to realize that my mother was suffering from survivor guilt and post traumatic stress syndrome from her experience of being the child of Russian Jewish immigrants.\"\n\nMost people do not grow up with the reality Joe experienced as a red diaper baby. The truth was that Joe's parent's politics filled some American's with hate and anger. \"It isn't fair to place that burden on children. Like so many others, I was forced to react to the situation inherited at birth. All red diaper babies know what I am talking about,\" said Joe.\n\nJoe never cared much for the rhetoric or activities of the radical labor movement in which his parents were engrossed, according to Florence. She never seemed disappointed, and in fact, was very proud of the music bug that gripped Joe in his youth. \"The music of the men and women struggling for a better life appealed to him,\" she said.\n\nFlorence McDonald went on to be elected to the Berkeley city council and served in that office for many years. Worden remained an activist around Berkeley and wrote a book called An Old Guy Who Feels Good. Joe even though he had disagreements with his parents from time to time always remained devoted to them.\n\nJoe lived in El Monte in Southern California, from the ages of 5 to 17 in the time when no freeways went through the town. His father was a long time employee of Bell Telephone in downtown LA, but he loved to play farmer in their quarter acre homestead by having a nice garden and animals. Those days gave Joe a real love and appreciation for animals.\n\nJoe had a special horse named Rebel. They never used a bit on him because it hurt his mouth. Joe liked to ride him bareback. One day Worden rode Rebel to pick up Joe after school. Joe had his trombone with him, and he climbed up behind his father with the trombone case hanging alongside the horse. On the way home Worden decided to let Rebel experience meeting a train at a railroad crossing. The train started coming and as it got closer, its whistle grew louder and louder. Rebel started jumping around while Worden tried in vain to control the horse.\n\nJoe held on to his father as he fought the animal that got more agitated and tried to rear up. Joe slid off with his trombone when he finally got the opportunity. With Joe off the horse, Worden got the animal under control. After that though, Rebel didn't seem to mind trains at all.\n\nJoe had a number of harrowing experiences on the back of a horse while growing up. Joe was riding Rebel bareback in his small back yard one day, and he brought the horse to a brisk canter. The canter was a crazy move, as Joe's yard was such a small area with a garden, some fruit trees and a garage all crammed into a small area. Joe suddenly lost control and slipped off Rebel falling down his side, bouncing off his chest, and landing flat on his back on the ground in front of him. Joe looked up to see a hoof coming right down on his face. At that point Rebel looked Joe straight in the eyes and lifted his hoof out of the way and hopped over him. Joe always said Rebel was a good horse.\n\nJoe and I have shared ancestry when it comes to communist Russia.\n\nMy grandmother, Thelma Gorbonoff, and her family also fled Czarist Russia in 1906-07. At that time men were conscripted for 25-year hitches for the Czar's Army. They were poor peasants living in Siberia near the town of Chita, when they decided to flee and head east towards Harbin, Manchuria. They loaded up all the horse-drawn wagons they could find and drove across the Siberian plains much like the pioneer's of the old west did crossing along the Oregon Trail. If both Joe's and my family hadn't fled, we certainly would not have had as much fun in the 60's.\n\nAfter a huge ordeal they arrived in Harbin to hear of jobs in a place called Hawaii. Dole Pineapple Company had sent recruiters out to Harbin to try and hire white labor to work in the fields in Hawaii. It was a time of racism and \"yellow peril\" fears in Hawaii. They offered the Russians one ruble a day if they agreed to make the long sea voyage to Honolulu. My grandmother's family signed up.\n\nAs they were boarding a ship in Korea for the trip to Hawaii via Japan, Thelma's younger brother, a 10-year-old boy, disappeared at dockside. His disappearance was noted just as the ship had cast lines and was headed out. Screams for the Captain to stop went unheard from the distraught Russians in steerage. The boy Vasily was never found or heard from again.\n\nAfter years of working in the fields of Hawaii, Thelma met a Portuguese-American sailor named Charles Cabral who worked on the San Francisco-Honolulu run for Matson Lines. They fell in love, married and Charles took Thelma to a better life in San Francisco. They lived for years on Potrero Hill, a working class neighborhood with stunning views of the San Francisco Bay. I often visited her there when she was in her last years and heard her stories of how she came to America. She felt the Czar was a rat the way he treated the people and in her mind Joe Stalin saved Russia. She was sad when Stalin died in 1953. I watched her cry while watching Stalin's funeral on TV. Neither Russian Orthodox nor Jewish, she was connected someway to the Molokan Sect, a type of holy-roller Christian congregation that settled along the West Coast from Seattle to Baja California. There was a large contingent of Molokans who settled on Potrero Hill. Illiterate in both English and Russian she lived to age 94 and is buried in Seaside, California.\n\nMy father Ernest Cabral was born in Hawaii in 1914. He arrived in San Francisco in 1918 with Thelma and grew up on Potrero Hill. He lived there till he married my mother Flora Martinez in 1940 - I came along a year later. Flora had come to San Francisco as a 5-year old immigrant from Costa Rica in 1924 with her mother Sara and brother Claude. Ernest and Flora met during the Depression era of the 1930's while Flora was attending Mission High. My father served in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) after he graduated from Commerce High in 1933. In those days a young man had pretty much only two choices -- enlist in the Army for $21.00 per month or join the CCC for $30.00 -- there were few other jobs. Ernest was assigned to a road building crew in the remote forests of Modoc County in Northern California. He later became a career civilian employee of the U.S. Army as an overseas supply specialist at Fort Mason and the Oakland Army Terminal. My mother operated her own beauty shop for 35 years in the city.\n\nWhile Joe was attending Arroyo High School in El Monte, he became totally obsessed with music. Fourteen-year-old Joe mastered the techniques for playing the trombone. At the same time he learned the acoustic guitar, and he was developing his vocal and song writing talents. From 1955 to 1957, Joe was a member of the school concert band, which played mainly, marches, and modern pieces by composers like Aaron Copeland and Richard Rogers. Joe often fell asleep with the radio on tuned to LA stations that played Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Fats Domino, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and others. Joe also played in a Dixieland jazz band, and he had become familiar with the works of Jack Teagarden, Dave Breubeck, Turk Murphy and J.J. Johnson. Since Joe was also a member of the school marching band, he had to go to all the football games and run up and down the field at half time playing Souza marches. Sometimes after marching, he would go straight home to rehearse his own rock and roll band. Young Joe was living a very real musical life -- he was experiencing music of all types all at once.\n\nJoe got his first money gig while still in high school. A friend got him a gig, playing trombone in a dance band. The band had 15 pieces and played tunes like \"Star Dust\", \"Deep Purple\" and \"Moon Glow.\"\n\n\"My parents always had music on at home,\" said Joe. \"I heard lots of Gilbert and Sullivan with Spike Jones, Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger thrown in.\" On weekends Joe would go to the El Monte American Legion Stadium to see Fats Domino, and Johnny Otis.\n\nAs a senior in high school, Joe decided to put his first band on the road. The band was called The Nomads. The band was made up of one guitar, a snare drum, a sax and vocals. There was no bass player. The Nomads soon broke up and Joe started his second band called The Tanganyika Trio. The trio was a kind of calypso band with congas and bongos. They did a few gigs in Orange County and in Pasadena at some folksy bohemian type coffee houses of the late 50's.\n\nThe trio lasted for four months until right after Joe graduated from Arroyo at age 17. Joe's third band was a little different from The Nomads and The Tanganika Trio -- that band was The San Diego Naval Station Recruit Drum and Bugle Corps. This time Joe was a bugler and not the leader of a rock or calypso band. Joe being a highly proficient trombone player had no trouble learning to play a bugle. Joe could easily have ended up playing in a Navy band, but for some reason he assigned to Naval Aviation and soon found himself off to Navy Air Control School in Olathe, Kansas. He was somewhat disappointed as he thought he was going to be sent to Signalman School. When he arrived at Olathe he spent a month cleaning out large pots at the base mess hall.\n\nT O P\n\nCHAPTER 2: G.I. JOE IN THE NAVY\n\nAtsugi, Japan -1960\n\nWhen Joe arrived at U.S. Naval Air Station, Atsugi, Japan in May of 1960 he looked around at the place that would be his new home for the next two years. Right out of boot camp and air control school, he had never been to a foreign country, and Atsugi, 40 miles west of Yokohama near Mt. Fuji, was as foreign as it gets to a 18-year-old from California.\n\nThe base buzzed with fighter and attack planes from the big carriers that sat offshore. There was always a new carrier operating in the area. Carriers like the Ticonderoga, Bon Homme Richard (Bonnie Dick), Hornet, Ranger, Oriskany and others launched their aircraft to Atsugi, and then tied up for liberty at Yokosuka Naval Base.\n\nJoe the sailor\n\nI looked up from behind my desk in the pilot flight schedules office when I first laid eyes on the new arrival to our unit. Our office took care of pilot flight logs, issued Notice to Airmen, handed out maps, and maintained flight schedules. At the time I thought very little about Joe as I finally gave him the tidbit of information he needed before he saw the chief for check in. \"Just listen and don't say anything,\" I said, winking at him as he shuffled off down the passageway.\n\nBowman spent his days as the man in charge of the air control tower operator unit. You could tell from his age and attitude that Chief Bowman was one of those rare sailors who totally loved the Navy. The chief often said the Navy pulled him out of the gutter and gave him a home when he was a kid of 18. Bowman was also a vehement anti-communist constantly worried about the commies in Russia, China, North Korea and elsewhere that were trying to take over the world. He raved constantly about it to anyone who listened.\n\nSo, it surprised me little when he returned an hour later talking about the chief raving about \"commie whores\" in the bars in town. I looked up blankly, and he finally introduced himself as \"Joe McDonald from El Monte, California.\"\n\nWe made small talk and then the subject turned to music. Joe went on to say he mainly liked folk music and that he really enjoyed the Kingston Trio, Harry Belafonte, Little Richard and Richie Valens. Joe also mentioned that he played trombone.\n\nI had just had my trombone shipped over to me from San Francisco and it was in the flight simulator building across the street from the tower. An odd looking and distinct sounding instrument, the trombone has killed more friendships, potential dates and conversations than it ever helped. At the time I met Joe, high school band had none of the stigma of today, but that fear of trombone reprisal still weighed on each of us. So being two admitted trombone-playing Californian's was enough to guarantee we would spend much time together during our tour of duty.\n\nJoe asked me to show him around the operations building, especially the control tower. We soon went up into the tower, and I introduced him around to the air control petty officers on duty. Joe showed an immediate interest and excitement in his future job. \"I can't wait to get on the duty rotation,\" he told the duty crew. A few of the disgruntled Navy petty officers stopped their activity for a nano-second to gape at Joe.\n\nJoe said, \"I sure do love to watch those Navy and Marine planes take off and land.\" It is always easier to make excited comments when you're the new guy.\n\nThe barracks we lived in were built by the U.S. Navy Seabee's (the Navy's construction battalion) right after the U.S. Occupation of Japan began right after WW II ended in 1945 -- they had been remodeled some in the 50's. Our particular barracks was organized into partitions so that numerous men shared three high bunks and each man had a fairly good-sized personal locker. The head was a long walk away from the bunk areas with a row of 12 gleaming urinals and 12 toilets without stalls, doors or any other methods of privacy -- this changed after a few months as stalls were finally added.\n\nThe sinks were often full of multi-colored bugs each morning during the warmer weather. Beetles, worm-like creatures and various crawlies disappeared after running the water for a few minutes, but the next morning they were all back. Showers were often packed with sailors. The Navy seemed to have an unwritten zero privacy rule. In a shower filled with guys, there were usually more tattoos than people. Many sailors made the mistake of having their girl friends name put on their arm only to eventually get the \"Dear John, I found someone else\" or \"I can't wait anymore\" letter. Those letters called for a trip back to the tattoo parlor to have \"Mom\" or some other design tattooed over the name. And always there was music playing in the barracks; country music like Johnny Cash singing \"I Walk the Line\" played over and over.\n\nTwo Japanese houseboys kept the barracks spotless. The houseboys made up the bunks each morning, waxed and buffed the floors, shined shoes and took out and picked up laundry. Some of the barracks workers fought in the Japanese military during the War, it was an odd arrangement. Every month each sailor would chip in $5.00 as a tip for the workers.\n\nWe were both 18. I had been at the base a few months, so when Joe first arrived, he and I walked the base to show him some of the sights. The base was very famous because it had been a kamikaze training center during WWII. General Douglas MacArthur landed at Atsugi in 1945 on his way to take the Japanese surrender on the deck of the battleship U.S.S Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The base chapel was actually a former Buddhist temple that was used by the Kamikaze pilots during their training.\n\nIt was a common procedure to register your religious preferences with the chaplain when arriving on base. On one of our walks, Joe and I stopped off to do just that -- I can't recall what religion Joe registered. In boot camp dog tags were issued and a religion was stamped on it. Joe asked the chaplain if he knew of any orphanages or places that would like to hear some American folk music -- Joe was already looking for a gig and had somehow just aquired a guitar. The chaplain said he would let us know if he heard of anything but he had a sort of rueful look in his eye.\n\nOur conversations seemed to always come back to music or women. Joe asked, \"Do you know anybody who likes to make music around here?\" \"Do you know any girls out in town?\" What are some of the real good bars?\"\n\nA sailor named Larry Parmenter heard Joe play some guitar out on the barracks fire escape one evening and told Joe he had a small recording system put together with a good tape recorder and speakers over in the Link Trainers (flight simulator) shack. Larry invited some of us over for a jam session. It wouldn't take long before we would be there and on a regular basis.\n\nThere was much to see on the base, and many months passed for most of the new guys before they were able to see even half. A young sailor first arriving might see some U-2 aircraft flying out of Atsugi. The controversial U-2 spy plane made big news in 1960 as pilot Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union and had been captured as a U.S. spy. The day before that made the news I saw one take off -- it just went straight up like a rocket and disappeared -- the U2's had been flying out of Atsugi for a long time. After Powers was shot down (he did not fly out of Atsugi) the U.S. had to admit to the fact that it had been spying on Russia and other countries for a long time with the high altitude spy plane.\n\nOne evening we went to the EM or \"Enlisted Man's\" club . The club had a massage parlor manned by several young Japanese women and slot machines in the lobby, just like in Vegas or Reno. \"Happy Hour\" was from 7 to 8 p.m., and all drinks cost a dime. Since there was no limit on ordering, it was not uncommon for a sailor to order a dozen whiskey sours or beers at one time, and just sit there ingesting them until they were gone. After a night of drinking, the sailor would often pass out, get dragged back to the barracks by his mates and thrown into his rack. Sailors woke, vomited and passed out again throughout the night often coating the floor with puke.\n\nA few nights later we went over to the EM club to see the singing legends The Mills Brothers. A Japanese swing band, and a singer called the Japanese Nat King Cole were also appearing. The place was packed, but the Brothers were an hour late. By the time they started singing \"Glow Worm\" it was too late. Most of the sailors were blind drunk and made so much noise the legends could not be heard past the first row. The Mills Brothers got upset and left early so the Japanese Nat King Cole impersonator had to come on sooner than he expected. Right after that a Japanese 40's style dance band started playing Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller style tunes. The base clubs always put on great shows drawing both name U.S. talent and local talent from the Tokyo-Yokohama area. We just took it all for granted. Bob Hope even appeared at the base once while we were there but I recall being on duty that night so I missed seeing him.\n\nDuring a break Joe asked one of the trombone players and the bandleader if he could sit in on a song or two. They hesitated, but finally said yes. Joe walked to the section and took the trombone. The band started to play, and Joe didn't even hesitate. He put the mouthpiece to his lips, still warm from the other guy blowing on it, and joined in on \"Perfidia\" then \"Pennsylvania 6-5000.\" Joe could really blow that horn -- he had a great tone and could really project that t-bone sound.\n\nThe sailors hardly noticed. A couple of sober fellows in the audience who were close enough to hear perked up at the sound of Joe's jazzy playing, but for the most part, Joe's Japanese debut went unnoticed. After the set, Joe handed the trombone back to its owner who looked at the thing like he had never seen it before.\n\nIn 1960 any sailor regardless of age could drink all manner of alcohol every night. Some became full-blown alcoholics before reaching 20 years old. If they were not drinking on base, then they were in town drinking at the bars, which is precisely what Joe and most of us did every chance we could. Joe and some of the guys from the barracks often headed out to the nearest town Sagami-Otsuka. The town was 2 miles from the base and could best be reached by bus or cab. Rice paddies surrounded the town, and with rice paddies came the smell of human fertilizer.\n\nSmall tank trucks with suction hoses would drain out the wastes collected from each houses septic tank in the area and deliver the stuff to a processor who added chemicals to it and sprayed it directly on the rice paddies. By the heat of August the smell was at its peak. This practice of using human wastes has been going on for thousands of years in Japan, but the strangest thing was the base had a huge 18-hole golf course that buttressed right up to a wire fence separating the golf course from the rice paddies. Some times the golfers and the rice farmers would look at each other through the fence -- they would just sort of stare at each other with that god-awful stench hanging in the air.\n\nSagami-Otsuka looked like a town out of the old American west. It boasted dirt streets and over fifty bars that could pass for western movie set saloons. The town also had two or three hotels (the best being the Cherry Hotel), a few small country style houses, and a train station with service to Tokyo and Yokohama. Each bar was run by a mama-san that employed eight to ten young women who hustled drinks and their bodies after closing time.\n\nThese were the same women that Chief Bowman warned Joe and everyone else on base about. He said that many of them were not Japanese, but they where North Korean spies and they only wanted to collect secrets about base activities. I still don't know if that was true, or if it was just Bowman's paranoia.\n\nThe women would take a sailor to a hotel or nearby house for the night for less than $10.00 or about 3,600 Yen. Sometimes they would have sex for free if the sailor would promise to bring them cigarettes and other goods from the Base Exchange -- a carton of cigarettes cost $1.00 in 1960.\n\nVenereal disease was a problem at the base and the common procedure was to put the man who came down with it on restriction for two weeks and prescribe anti-biotics. Then the afflicted sailor would have to go the base security office and identify the picture of the woman he may have been with from a certain bar. The base security office had binders for each bar in town containing photos of all the bar workers. A Japanese health inspector would then go out to the bar and issue her a ticket for a required health examination. The woman with the disease would then disappear for a spell while being treated.\n\nThe different venereal diseases were a painful and difficult experience to cope with -- especially under the Navy \"no privacy\" blanket. Any pressure or constrictions of the private area proved painful. So, sometimes a sailor with a bad case of some STD often removed the mattress off a bottom rack and lay naked and face down on the springs allowing his genitals to hang through soaking it in a vial of some kind of blue fluid. In those days there were various strange treatments for sailors who had some forms of VD or non-specific urethritis (NSU) or shankers as the medics didn't really know what remedies to use or how to cure the maladies exactly. Whenever a Marine Unit in transit was passing through Atsugi the cases of VD skyrocketed. Many of these units had just come from exotic locations and they brought unknown bugs with them.\n\nOnce off restriction some sailor's celebrated by having a new sharkskin suit tailored for $50 by a shop right outside the base. It was common to see young sailors nattily dressed, some wearing cashmere overcoats for a night on the town. Along the road to town there were open sewers or benjo ditches. Occasionally a sailor with a new suit was found face down and drunk in a benjo ditch by the shore patrol. It was a sorry site to see the SP's pulling a mud-soaked sailor out of one of those ditches during a rainstorm at midnight.\n\nI met a few interesting guys from the base, and we eventually became friends. Joe, Larry, Bill Gregory, Henry Butler and I spent a lot of time together. Joe started playing the guitar he had somehow aquired more and more in the barracks and everyone enjoyed his singing and playing. Larry continued to encourage Joe and some of us to keep coming to his shop for the jam sessions which were starting to sound good. Bill, Larry and I joined in on bongos, trombone, mandolin, and on back-up vocals. Joe conducted the sessions like a real rehearsal and we all had a great time. Joe kept saying he wanted to take our little act on the road and perform for the kids in orphanages, but we never heard further from the chaplain so that never happened. Mainly we just had fun with the playing and singing. After we played music Larry would let us all fly the Link Trainers, flight simulator machines called the blue boxes, for a couple of hours. He would give us maps to practice approaches to various airports we never heard of like Saigon and to airports in Laos and Cambodia. This was the first time I had ever heard of Vietnam or Saigon.\n\nLarry, an electronic wizard type, would be the simulated ground control approach (GCA) operator and would guide us in for a landing as if we were in IFR or instrument conditions. He would say things like,\" turn left to 270 degrees and descend to 4,000 feet, steady on-glide path, on-glide path.\" While flying the Link Trainers we all began to hear about this place called Saigon and this was in the middle of 1960. Since most of us were air control people it was good training to fly the blue boxes especially under the guidance of a Link Trainer tech.\n\nWhile sitting at the Bar Rose in Sagami-Otsuka, I asked Joe why he joined the Navy. \"I once saw a recruiting poster in downtown El Monte of a sailor holding up some signal flags on a ship - that image really had an impact on me to join up,\" Joe said. \"I thought I could really sail the seven seas and maybe even get laid in every port.\" Soon two very friendly bar hostesses came and sat next to us and asked us to buy them drinks -- we gladly did. We were very cool sailors.\n\nRon with a bar-girl\n\nThe bargirls really liked the sailors who were going to be stationed at Atsugi for a long time. Those sailors became access to all kinds of benefits for the girls. Some permanently assigned sailors had several different girl friends for as long as they were stationed at Atsugi. The girls called these sailors \"Skive Honchos.\" Many Japanese women hoped to marry a local sailor and go to live in the land of the big PX -- the USA.\n\nMany sailors did try to marry a girl they met in a bar. For some it was love at first sight. Most of the young men had never been around any highly sexual women like the bar workers they met in Sagami-Otsuka.\n\nIn early 1961 news came that the runway at Atsugi was going to be closed for three months for repairs and some of us base permanent personnel were being transferred for short term duty to nearby bases. I was sent to an Army base called Camp Zama, and Joe was sent to the Mito Gunnery Range at the east-end of Tokyo Bay. Mito was used mainly by the Air Force for target practice. Every day dozens of jet fighters would shoot up the place and it was Joe's job to keep track of the hits and misses and report those scores to the flight leader-circling overhead. While he was in Mito he fell in love with a young Japanese woman about his own age named Toshie. They met in Yokohama when Joe was off-duty. They started living together briefly and he wanted to marry her.\n\nDuring this time I did not see Joe.\n\nAs it turned out Joe finally left Mito and returned to the Operations Division at Atsugi. He saw Toshie for the last time just before he ended his tour of duty in Japan. His request for marriage was flatly denied by his commanding officer on the grounds that Joe was too young, and he was not capable of supporting a wife. Joe never said anymore about this at least to me.\n\nThe Navy had a well-kept secret policy of not allowing most marriage requests made by young sailors. They really were trying to prevent \"old hookers\" from taking advantage of 17 and 18-year-old naïve sailors. There were many cases of 18-year-old sailors falling in love with the first bar girl they had sex with. For many it was the first time, and they fell deeply in love right away. Marriage seemed a logical step.\n\nOne evening two Shore Patrol men came roaring into the barracks at Atsugi looking for an 18-year-old sailor from Seattle by the name of Jim Weston. Weston had just turned in his application for marriage to the base commander. He was in love with a 45-year-old bar girl who may have met the occupation troops in 1945. The SP shined a flashlight in his face, yanked him out of the rack, ordered him get dressed and pack his sea bag. One of the SP's read Weston his transfer orders saying, \" As the Navy was looking out for your best interest you are ordered to report immediately to Sand Point, Washington for further duty.\" His designated plane was warming up as they spoke at the base airport terminal, and was going to leave in 20 minutes.\n\nWeston freaked out and began yelling and screaming every curse imaginable. He threw himself against lockers and waved his arms around like a lunatic. The two SP's grabbed him and his seabag and dragged him down the stairs to a waiting van -- Weston cried, screaming and begged all the way down the stairs. A group of startled sailors, me among them, gathered at the top of the stairs watching - I never even got a chance to say goodbye to him.\n\nIt was now mid 1961, and Joe was back at Atsugi. Joe seemed like a different guy -- he could have been down about having his marriage request rejected. He kept to himself more, appeared somewhat depressed and did not go out to town with the boys like he did before going to Mito. Joe was assigned to work in the operations office passing out flight maps to pilots, working the ship-to-shore radio called Raspberry Atsugi and he was being trained to become a flight dispatcher. We all really liked the ship-to-shore radio. We could hear propaganda messages in English coming out of Red China, Vladivostok, Russia, and North Korea saying things like, \" Imperialist warmonger Eisenhower said today, blah, blah, blah, today \" and so on. We would also get messages from ships at sea. It was very exciting to hear broadcasts from so far away. On occasion we would get to transmit a message over Raspberry and that always seemed exciting.\n\nClipping from the hometown paper\n\nFinally Joe got the call to start training for work in the control tower. He had been well trained for that duty, as he was a graduate of the Navy air control tower operator school in Olathe, Kansas. At Olathe he learned air navigation, meteorology, air traffic control procedures, radio communications, air traffic rules and FAA flight regulations. I never went to that school because I had come on active duty as a Reservist, but I was already on the tower crew as an air control striker, someone who learns on the job. I had managed to convince the tower chief to take me as a \"striker\" as I was a qualified Navy Airman and I also had taken some private flying lessons in single-engine seaplanes in Sausalito, California prior to coming on active duty. I looked forward to Joe joining us.\n\nI was always amazed about how much responsibility the Navy gives its young sailors. Soon after I started in the tower I found myself on the \"A\" stand giving landing instructions to an entire squadron of jet fighters that were inbound from one of the carriers. \"A\" stand is the lead position in the tower and the \"A\" stand operator gives permission for all planes to take off and land. Not only were the fighters coming in but other aircraft as well so that there were as many as 50 planes in the flight pattern at one time. I was able to do this without a lot of problems as I had a kind of knack for this kind of work and pressure. This training helped me years later keep my cool as a public school teacher and administrator.\n\nThe first day Joe went to the tower he was put right on \"A\" stand. Joe had some problems making quick decisions, and he even froze up at times. The watch petty officer took him off and assigned him other duties hoping Joe would observe and learn the needed techniques. After two weeks he was sent back down to the operations office and back to dispatch and the Raspberry Atsugi radio.\n\n\"I had a hard time competing with those older tower guys,\" Joe confided in me. \"I'm glad to be out of there, I made mistakes that could have killed somebody.\"\n\nLike most sailors eventually do, Joe began to sour on his Navy career. He began to look forward to his discharge date. He did flirt with re-enlisting briefly at one point as many sailors do, but quickly came to his senses that he was no lifer.\n\nSouvenir lighter -- \"sayonara\"\n\nWhen my day came for release from active duty in late 1961 I said goodbye to all my friends in the barracks, I invited them all to look me up when they got out, and I gave Joe a fan and a lighter with Atsugi engraved on it. I wondered if we would ever meet again -- I really didn't think we ever would.\n\nWhen my plane lifted off the runway at Tachikawa Air Force Base taking me home to San Francisco, I felt deeply saddened leaving my comrades, Japanese friends and the \"Land of the Rising Sun\" behind. I had no idea what was in store for me, or even the world, as we all headed full tilt into the 60's.\n\nT O P\n\nCHAPTER 3: BACK IN THE USA\n\nSan Francisco -- 1963/1964\n\nI had been out of the Navy almost two years, and I had not heard from Joe during any of that time. Then in the summer of 1963, I got a 4 a.m. phone call from Joe.\n\n\"Hey Ron,\" I had not an intelligent reply, all I could manage was a slurred \"what's up Joe.\"\n\n\"I'm on my way up to Canada maybe even Alaska, ya wanna hang out?\" Turns out, Joe was with a small black dog and two Englishmen, Nigel and Mike, a couple of hitchhikers he picked up on his way to San Francisco. Joe said he was traveling around California, and that he was headed for Portland, Vancouver and maybe even Alaska to play some clubs and any other places that featured folk music his story got more interesting as he told me that on the way to San Francisco he had worked for a while at a Central Valley tomato farm lumping tomato boxes onto trucks for $1.08 per hour. He then said he planned to make the trip to Alaska in a rusty '49 green Ford coupe. I was then a sophomore at City College of San Francisco and was living on 24th Street in Noe Valley, so I immediately invited Joe and his newfound hitchhiker friends to come on over. I had not seen Joe since we both got out of the Navy and I was sure anxious to see him even if it was the middle of the night. By 5:00 a.m. we were all sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. Joe was full of stories about the farm worker experience he had just had and life on the road. Joe was really having a Kerouac type On the Road experience. The hitchhikers told me they were just biding their time till they could raise enough money to go to Hong Kong to open up a bar.\n\nI was then living in the family five-bed room house above my mother's beauty shop called \"La Florita's House Of Beauty.\" One of the problems about living above a beauty shop is that the fumes from permanent wave solutions permeate through the walls and smell up the entire house. I can remember as a teen-ager going down stairs to the beauty shop with my some of my buddies late at night. We would turn on the huge hair dryers full blast and then sit under them, smoking cigarettes, and reading the latest movie magazines. After that we would go into the back room and play an old upright piano. These were just some of the joys of living above a beauty salon in the heart of the inner city.\n\nJoe with his parents and younger brother Billy\n\nJoe and I quickly caught up on what had been happening in our lives to that point, and somehow the conversation turned to our families. It was during this conversation that Joe told me that he was named after Joseph Stalin -- this was the first time I had heard of this. Joe's mother, he went on, was the strongest Marxist in the family and she was very articulate about her politics. \"I got my politics from my mom, but I got my dad's work ethic,\" he said. Joe's parents gave him a real understanding of the differences between communism and capitalism at a very young age.\n\nHis parents had a large impact on Joe's music choices. Folk music was always playing in Joe's home while he was growing up in Southern California. \"Folk music had a huge influence on me,\" Joe said. I was surprised at how much Joe had been influenced by his parents, because he hardily mentioned them, or much about his childhood, when we were stationed together in the Navy.\n\nJoe and the two hitchhikers stuck around my place for about a week. I took them out sight seeing all around the city. We cruised San Francisco in a blue Ford panel truck that I used for my part-time job delivering library books to merchant ships tied up at San Francisco and Oakland piers. Joe thought the San Francisco summer fog that draped around Twin Peaks and then just poured down into Noe Valley looked like Martian gas. The sight of the fog rolling down the flanks of Twin Peaks, like it does, is really something to behold. As a kid I always loved to watch the fog come in. I thought everyone had fog to watch -- I didn't know I was living in a fairyland like setting, which Noe Valley can be when the climate is just right. There is no place quite like it anywhere.\n\nJoe and I continued to catch up on each other's lives that week as we toured the city. Joe told me it was weird going back to El Monte after the Navy. He felt out of sorts, he said. His Navy time had made him a total neat freak, so he would walk around the family home inspecting it for dust and clutter. He made his bed so a quarter would bounce off it and he took lots of showers. He was acutely aware of order and structure.\n\nJoe signed up to attend the local junior college, Mount San Antonio in Pomona. Since Joe had lived abroad and served a tour in the Navy, he found most the students were younger, and less mature than he was, and what was worse, none of the people he met at the college had ever served in the military or had ever been outside of California. Most of them seemed boring to Joe.\n\nThe world was slipping into full '60's mode, so Joe wanted to expand his mind and experience what the world had to offer. He went after his education hoping to accomplish his life altering epiphany, what ever that might have been, but all he found was a bunch of poorly taught, non-inspiring classes. Joe dropped out and got a job selling vacuum cleaners door to door.\n\nHis vacuum cleaner gig did not provide the moneymaking opportunity he had hoped for and it turned out to be a total disaster. Joe decided to finally take the plunge and become a folk singer.\n\nI decided to call another Navy pal from Atsugi, Larry, who lived in Portland. \"Joe's coming your way,\" I said. \"Make sure and look out for him. He is with of a couple of wanna be Bar owners, and who knows who else he'll pick up between here and Portland.\"\n\nTurns out Joe made it to Portland, and Larry's place without much fuss. Larry was glad to see Joe, and he continued the Navy connection by calling another buddy of ours, Bill Gregory, who lived in the Seattle area. Bill came down to Portland, and the trio began looking for gigs for Joe to play.\n\nLarry and Bill found a club in Portland that featured new talent. Larry talked to the very up-tight owner who agreed, reluctantly, to let Joe on stage. Larry told the guy Joe played the guitar and harmonica at the same time and was something like Bob Dylan. After just two numbers, the owner called Joe off the stage and told him to leave. Apparently, he didn't approve of a certain civil rights song Joe was singing. \"I don't allow race music in here,\" the old red neck bellowed before kicking Joe out. Joe left Portland quite discouraged, and he and his two riders headed further north hoping to find work on a fishing boat. Joe fired up the old Ford and made it all the way to the Alaska border. Joe, Nigel and Mike soon found work in a fish packing plant in a small fishing village. Shortly after arriving in Alaska the Englishmen parted ways with Joe. Seems that the chaps did not like the work and they were soon laid off for slacking off. The boss also told Joe to take a hike. Now Joe was fast running low on gas and food money and he was tired of sleeping in the car so he just decided to make the long drive back to the San Gabriel Valley, alone.\n\nI didn't hear from Joe for another year. In early 1964, I was a senior at San Francisco State working on my BA and teaching credential. I had decided to go into teaching early in life, it was a dream or a calling I had as a kid while attending James Lick Junior High in San Francisco. I also wanted to be a pilot in the Navy in the worse way but that one just never quite worked out.\n\nThe doorbell rang -- it was Joe. He stood at the front door, along side the \"House of Beauty\", with his new bride, Kathe Werum. Joe looked really different to me. He had a huge mustache and longish hair. \"Ron, I've come to Frisco to break into show biz,\" he said, Kathe was about Joe's size and she wore round wire rimmed glasses. I was happy to see Joe and Kathe and set them up in my brother's vacant bedroom upstairs as he had just shipped out on the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. I had no idea Joe had gotten hitched and it really surprised me. I remembered that he almost got married only a few years before this in Japan in 1961.\n\nHe seemed really serious about it, the show biz thing; it made perfect sense to me, as I knew he had the required talent. I spent a few days with the newly wed's driving them around different neighborhoods of the city hoping to find an apartment. The search was very difficult as Joe said he could only afford $55 dollars a month for rent. We found nothing, but a few days later, Joe called me to say they were staying with a relative of Kathe's over in the East Bay town of Lafayette. I wished him and Kathe well and suggested that we stay in touch.\n\nThe Berkeley String Quartet\n\nI heard from Joe, off and on, over the next year. He called me again after a few months to say he had moved to Berkeley and that he was playing with some \"far out\" people he met there. Joe said he really liked Berkeley and had no desire to live in San Francisco. Joe had joined a group called the Berkeley String Quartet made up of four men who played everything from guitars, banjos, harmonica and an auto-harp to washtub bass, kazoo, washboard and even salad spoons.\n\nI was really tied up at San Francisco State and delivering books to U.S. merchant ships every day, so I never made it over to Berkeley to see Joe. Sometime in 1965 Joe invited me to North Beach where he was playing -- with The Berkekly String Quartet-- in a coffeehouse called Coffee and Confusion. The club was on Grant Ave, and it was an old-beatnik era bar from the 50's. I took my then future wife to be Rita Milani along and we were dressed up for a night on the town, I was kind of shocked to see Joe looking like half a beatnik and half a hippie -- Joe was just ahead of the fashion curve of the time so I shouldn't have been startled at all. He played the spoons, guitar, and sang that night. I was impressed that Joe was following his dream. After the gig in North Beach I tried to call him in Berkeley but the phone had been disconnected and there was no new number. I wondered if I would ever see or hear from Joe again, this time I thought for sure we were headed in totally different directions.\n\nA few years earlier when I was in high school (1957-58) my buddies Dave Pallavicini and Noel Blincoe and I sometimes drove over to North Beach and hung out in front of Eric Nord's Bagel Shop on Grant Ave (a well known Beat hangout of the times). We also gravitated around places where live jazz was being played, being too young to go in we would just linger out in front to hear the sounds. San Francisco was a great town to grow up in during those years. We liked to see Eric Nord because he was like a giant, with wild hair, and a blonde beard - sometimes he would come out in the street and talk to us. We put on sunglasses and combed our hair funny and made the scene with some of the beatnik's who read poetry and played bongo drums and congas in the coffeehouses around there. It was a cool thing to do on a Saturday night and North Beach was a happening place. One night we saw Rock Hudson come out of the Bagel Shop, we all thought that was really far out seeing Rock. We had no idea at the time that poets and writers like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Kenneth Rexroth, Kenneth Patchen, Michael McClure and Gary Snyder frequented those beatnik hangouts. I clearly remember going into City Lights bookstore for the first time then to try and buy a copy of Ginsberg's Howl, but it was sold out. I had read in the San Francisco Chronicle that Lawrence Ferlinghetti the owner of City Lights had been arrested for selling Howl so I wanted to see what the hoopla was all about. I read it years later and then realized why it caused such a commotion. In the early 70's Joe did a project with Ginsberg and wrote some music for the soundtrack of a movie Ginsberg was making called \"Tricks.\"\n\nIn 1967 the poet Kenneth Rexroth appeared as a guest poet in one of my Horace Mann Junior High English classes I was teaching as part of the poets in the schools program. That same year I would see McClure and Ginsberg at the historic Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park. San Francisco is a big city, but at the same time it is like a small town, you keep running into the same people all the time.\n\nT O P\n\nCHAPTER 4: AND THIS IS REALLY IT\n\nSan Francisco -- 1967/1968\n\nBy early 1967 I was in my second year working as a classroom teacher in a San Francisco Mission District junior high school. I had just become aware of big changes going on in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and I was starting to develop a teaching unit on the emerging counter-culture, as it was being called, to deliver to my Social Studies class. I had no idea what was going on other than a remarkable change in how people started to look. I was very familiar with the Haight because in 1956/57 I had attended Polytechnic High School that was located only a few blocks away from Haight and Stanyon Streets.\n\nA beginning teacher in San Francisco in 1967 started out at a salary around $6,000 per year, however rents were cheap and houses sold for under $20,000 in Daly City and around $30,000 out in the Sunset district. A young teacher could possibly qualify for a modest house. Things were rough trying to scrape by on that low salary especially with our first baby Denise on the way and the bills piling up fast. We rented a flat in the Sunset District on 44th avenue, just four blocks from the Pacific Ocean and a block away from Golden Gate Park.\n\nI heard on the radio that a big hippie event was going to take place on Saturday, January 10th at the Polo Fields in Golden Gate Park. Later I saw posters calling it the first annual -- \"Human Be-In and Gathering of the Tribes.\" I was really wondering about this and knew I had to be there. I called my brother Dennis Cabral, who worked as a cook and bartender in a Mission Street pool hall in Daly City, to go with me. He said that a Hell's Angel he knew named Dee had mentioned that the \"Be-In\" was really going to be a huge biker's convention.\n\nOn the way to the event, we encountered an endless procession of people heading into the park. I was not surprised to see what looked like thousands of mostly black Harley's parked along a dirt track. Hundreds of people came pouring in from every direction. There was a large raised stage surrounded by multi-colored banners and flags blowing hard in the afternoon wind. At the other end of the huge field, two uniformed rugby teams were fighting it out as if nothing else was going on. The rugby match added an element of surrealism to the strange event that was just getting started.\n\nWe strolled around for what seemed like hours and noticed that apparently every hippie and wanna be hippie in town was present. I kept hearing a song, by The Mojo Men that was popular at the time blaring from various portable radios, \"Sit Down I Think I Love You.\" Some one said, \"A guy named Owsley is supposed to arrive by parachute, who is Owsley?\" I was not sure who Owsley was at the time. The smell of marijuana was very strong and seemed to flow over the crowd. Indian sitar music was playing on the public address system. Suddenly Jerry Garcia started playing some riffs -- I think he was just tuning up - and then the Grateful Dead started to play \"The Golden Road.\" This was the first time I saw the Dead and I was working my way close to the stage to try and take some photos to show in my class. They sounded like no band I had ever heard before.\n\nSoon Timothy Leary started to speak about \"Turning on, Tuning in and Dropping out.\" I was confused as to what he was really saying as I could barely hear him. There was a special feeling to all this something like the feelings a kid might get at the Circus. A local poet, Lenore Kandel, started reading love poems, then throwing the pages into the crowd. Allen Ginsberg began a chant that brought a soothing calm over the assembly. Another Al, Alan Watts gave a kind of spiritual blessing to the excited crowd. Suddenly Jerry Rubin got up and offered a brief and rambling political speech, about the Vietnam War and LBJ. While all this was going on the Hell's Angels started to surround the stage and began behaving as security forces to help keep order. The local Hell's Angel chapter president got up on stage and waved to the gathering -- he got a big round of applause. The whole thing was sensory overload. I had the clear sense that I was part of and witness to some kind of important historical event that would only happen once.\n\nJoe and Pat Kilroy (right) of the New Age face the crowd at the Human Be-In. Photo, Gerhard E. Gesheidle.\n\nWhen I got down to the front of the stage The Dead had just stopped playing. I looked up and saw a familiar face covered in multi-colored paint. It was Joe. The last time I had seen him was in 1965 on Grant Avenue in North Beach playing in a jug band. He was just standing there on the edge of the stage, rocking back and forth holding a tambourine, staring out at the crowd. I assumed he was in the Grateful Dead -- hell, I didn't know, I yelled to him, \"Hey Mac, Hey Joe.\" I finally got his attention and he looked down at me smiled broadly and yelled back, \"Wow Ron, last time we saw each other we were going in opposite directions.\" I really didn't know what to say except to ask him if he was part of the Grateful Dead, he said no, but that he was in a band that was soon going to play at California Hall and it was called Country Joe and The Fish. That day was the first time I heard of Joe's group. It seemed that I was learning many new things all at once.\n\nJoe later told me a little story about what was going on in his head during the \"Be-In.\" He said, \"The main thought I had was that it was like a Viking tribal celebration and I was a Viking prince in the chief council. The medicine man was Ginsberg who led the chants and I remember Michael McClure reading a strange poem. He kept saying, over and over; and this is really it, and this is really it, and this is really it, and this is really it. During the McClure poem I was peaking on acid and thinking to myself --wow -- this is really it, yep this is really it all right. The whole thing was incredible and unbelievable.\"\n\n\"Big Daddy\" Tom Donahue, who once said, \"I don't trust anyone who doesn't like Country Joe.\"\n\nA few months later, as summer approached, I started hearing a Country Joe and The Fish song called \"Sweet Martha Lorraine\" on KFRC, an AM station. It was also played heavily on the new and radical rock alternative FM San Francisco Station called KMPX and later KSAN. Famed DJ \"Big Daddy\" Tom Donahue led the charge by bombarding the air with the fresh and new San Francisco Sound. Donahue broke the \"Summer of Love\" sound out on the airwaves -- Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Steve Miller, Blue Cheer, Moby Grape, Big Brother and the Holding Company and Country Joe and The Fish. The San Francisco based groups were heard non-stop along with the Beatles, Stones, Clapton, Hendrix, and all that followed, as the \"Summer of Love\" was about to take off -- radio never sounded better. Every time I heard Joe's tunes on the air I felt good and knew Joe was really starting to go places as an emerging rock star. I remembered what he told me three years earlier about coming to \"Frisco\" to break into show business. He was definitely deep into it now.\n\nIn March of '67 I saw a poster in the Haight showing Country Joe and The Fish appearing at the Avalon ballroom with the Sparrow and a group from Los Angeles called The Doors. This was to be my first visit ever to the new dance hall scene started by Chet Helms and Bill Graham. I took Rita who was 8 months pregnant, and arrived to see the line in front wrapped all the way around the block. This was the first appearance of The Doors in San Francisco and \"Light My Fire\" had yet to break out as a hit tune. We went to see Joe and caught The Fish set. I was a little startled when Joe sang \"The-Fixin'-to-Die-Rag\", it was a tune I never really listened to carefully before and it had what I thought at the time some rather chilling and sardonic lyrics -- it got a real rise out of the audience.\n\nSeeing Joe in the lobby afterwards he appeared very happy and blown away at the rocket like take off his group was experiencing. He said, \"we are going on a 50-city tour, then to Europe, and to LA to make some more records and if we stay together for 20 years we will be playing jazz by then.\" He patted Rita on the tummy and said, \"Hey let's go see The Doors.\" So we went in and Jim Morrison was singing \" Light My Fire\" -- I stood transfixed under a blazing strobe light and just couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing.\n\nI was totally hooked by the rock and roll circus taking place in my home town. By April I helped start up a Rock and Roll Production Company we called The Albatross. The company was made up of several investor teachers from my school, Ron Rumney, Aida Monares, and Paul Kameny plus my brother Dennis. We each chipped in a couple of hundred dollars, had 1000 posters made, advertised on KMPX, and rented California Hall on Polk St. The plan was to put on some good local bands, draw a big crowd and make a fortune quickly. We actually did very well considering none of us knew anything about the music business and the competition on either side of California Hall was really big -- Bill Graham at the Fillmore and Chet Helms at the Avalon.\n\nThe Albatross only put on two shows, but we managed to book and present Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin, Blue Cheer, and the Salvation Army Banned. This was not bad for a group of junior high teachers. I found out soon after this that Joe and Janis had been in love and living together briefly in the Haight and that Big Brother and Country Joe and The Fish often appeared together.\n\nDuring the first Albatross show at California Hall held on June 29, 1967, admission was $2.50. I recall being backstage and putting several hundred dollars in $1.00 bills and quarters into a paper bag held open by Big Brother's manager Julius Karpen while the band was playing. The money came right from the front door gate receipts. Karpen at first had demanded full payment before his group would even take the stage, but relaxed when he knew we could make the $350 payment -- we had given him a $350 down payment when we first booked the group a few weeks before. Big Brother and Janis had just returned to San Francisco after earning great acclaim at the Monterey Pop Festival only a week before and they were in very high spirits. In less than a year Janis Joplin would be a major rock star. None of us in Albatross knew how great Janis' performance at Monterey was, or even how important the Monterey Pop Festival was till the D.A. Pennebaker film, Monterey Pop, came out sometime later. Pennebacker really captured it all with close up shots of Mama Cass and Michelle Phillips of The Mama's and Papa's looking totally awe stuck, terrified and blown away while Janis electrified the audience.\n\nWe quickly found out after putting on one more Albatross show that there was no way for us schoolteacher types to compete with the Fillmore or Avalon so we soon abandoned the idea. It sure was fun, however, even if it was just for a New York minute.\n\nStill wanting to find a way to stay involved with the music scene I started managing a series of Bay Area based rock bands. There were many new bands emerging all over and many were seeking managers. Every neighborhood seemed to have some band blasting big notes from behind garage doors. I figured since bands mainly play at night I could still teach school during the day and work with the bands in the evening hours. I started to view it as a type of part-time job. The first band I worked with briefly was called the Judge Crater Memorial Blues Band. I did manage to get them just one rather notorious gig. Before any of us knew it we were sitting on a flatbed truck in the deepest part of Hunter's Point -- right in the middle of the projects. The man in charge said to me kind of jokingly, \"tell your guys to play like their lives depended on it\" -- and they did. Then Bobby Seale took the microphone and made a rousing speech about the Black Panther party to a small crowd made up mainly of media reporters and television crews. Bobby thanked us for coming out then got in a VW Bug and drove away.\n\nIn late '67 I took on another group for about a year called Celestial Hysteria -- this was a very young band which had some potential and regularly played clubs around the Bay Area like the Matrix and Dino and Carlo's in San Francisco. Celestial Hysteria has only two claims to fame. One is that they are listed in the back of a book written by the late famed critic Ralph Gleason in 1968 called The Jefferson Airplane and the San Francisco Sound. The other is that they played a Fillmore-West audition for Bill Graham. I decided to cease representing them right after they played at a packed teen club in San Mateo on the same bill with the emerging Santana band. Santana just a few weeks shy of releasing their first album blew them completely off the stage. I remember standing in the audience with my mouth wide open as Carlos and the boys played \"Soul Sacrifice.\" Another more compelling reason I gave up on them was because the Hysteria members would not sign a record contract offer I had arranged for them with Sire Records. Their parents refused to give permission for them to sign, as they were all under 21. The parents felt strongly that the band members would have to go on tour and would soon drop out of college resulting in all of them being drafted into the Army and sent to Vietnam -- as it turned out they may have been right as the Vietnam war was about to boil over. One member of Hysteria, John Barsotti, ended up taking a job at San Francisco State College and eventually became a professor in the Radio and TV Department.\n\nPoster for Hell's Angels party\n\nIn mid '68 I teamed up with my brother Dennis again, this time as co-manager of Gold, a hot and loud Mission District band that would soon have some interesting performing and recording encounters with Joe down the road. SF Examiner critic Phil Elwood said, \"Gold had a bluesy, Airplane-Santana mix in their sound\" -- not a bad assessment at the time. Gold went on to play on some really big Bill Graham Fillmore and Winterland shows over the next few years. They appeared as the opening act for bands like Mike Bloomfield, Hot Tuna, Ten Years After, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Cold Blood, John Lee Hooker, and Tower of Power. Gold also landed on a bill at a San Rafael Hell's Angels party in '70 with Janis Joplin as she introduced her new Full Tilt Boogie band and said goodbye forever to Big Brother and the Holding Company. In 1971 Gold opened for Big Brother yet again at a huge anti-war march and rally that drew over 150,000 people to Golden Gate Park.\n\nThe years 1967-1973 proved to be a roller coaster ride for me in Bay Area Rock and Roll. Joe was my inspirational leader and I had the good fortune to work closely with him both at my school and during the Fillmore and Winterland gigs in '71 and '72. Joe spent countless hours working with the band as they rehearsed in a Mission District basement that was located in an alley right next to a Funeral Home. Gold also recorded a tune Joe wrote that Country Joe and The Fish had recorded earlier called \"Summer Dresses.\" \"Summer Dresses\" was sung by Robin Sinclair and received lots of airplay on San Francisco radio stations.\n\nThe band also recorded part of a movie sound track for a movie Joe was in called Que Hacer. The film was made in Chile during 1971 and was directed by Saul Landau. Joe wrote all of the music for this unusual political bi-lingual film about the Chile of Salvador Allende. Gold continued to play \"Piece of Your Action\" during live performances long after recording it for the movie. Joe also appeared on a 45 record he produced for Gold under his alias Joe Borneo at Golden State Recorders. On that recording of \"Summertime\" Joe discreetly played keyboards. I found out later that Janis Joplin and Big Brother had recorded \"Summertime\" some years earlier in the same Golden State Studio.\n\nIn 1972 Joe tried an experiment and had Gold back him up on \"Piece of Your Action\" and \"Summer Dresses\" at a packed gig at Friends and Relations Hall out at the beach. That show was made up of The New Riders of the Purple Sage, Country Joe, Stoneground and Grootna. It was a gig that has never left my memory. I was extremely proud to witness my old Navy buddy Joe who had become Country Joe up there with my band playing together. It was a very sweet moment and the only time Joe ever performed \"live\" with Gold. During that period Joe also appeared at a few benefits for Opportunity High one being at Winterland with his All-Star band that included a former Gold conga player, the late Sebastian Nicholson. Sebastian went on to tour with Joe in Sweden and Denmark and he became a big hit over there and he ended up living in Sweden for over a year.\n\nJoe with members of Gold\n\nJoe did everything he could to help Gold succeed. They got massive exposure doing big live gigs for Bill Graham, got regular airplay and great press from the likes of John Wasserman, Phil Elwood and even Herb Caen. What kept them back was the lack of a hot LP or any LP for that matter and then the usual bickering and ego trips that almost all bands seem to go through that ultimately cause their demise. I recall the time that Fantasy Records president Saul Zaentz came over to see them personally with his wife while they were playing at Keystone Korner in San Francisco. We were told ahead of time that Saul really wanted to hear them and didn't want to be power blasted out of the club. Saul was looking for some bands to add to the Fantasy roster that might follow the path established by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Not taking all this very seriously the Gold bass player Chico Moncada, set his amp to 10, because he told us later that he liked to make the chairs rattle to get the ladies excited. Well, Zaentz and Mrs. Zaentz got up from their shimmering chairs and stormed out early in the set holding their ears. Gold had missed a golden opportunity and everything seemed to go downhill for them after that night.\n\nBy 1973 so much had happened to me since running into Joe at the \"Human Be-In\" five years earlier. I often remembered what Michael McClure had said it was all about \"And this is really it\" \"And this is really it\" he had said, over and over. McClure was right - this was really it all right, even five years later. I was a full-time teacher, married with a growing family and house. I was also at the same time living another life in the midst of the so-called San Francisco sound explosion. I had become part of it somehow. I probably would have never even gotten involved at all if it hadn't been for Joe as I look back on it. It was only a few years before all this that Joe and I were just two young sailors in the U.S. Navy serving our country in a far off land. We never thought then about having the full catastrophe of a full time job, marriage, family, mortgage and career. By 1967 the full catastrophe had hit us both.\n\nT O P\n\nCHAPTER 5: JOE AND JANIS\n\nSan Francisco -- 1967\n\nJoe met Janis Joplin in early 1967 as both Country Joe and The Fish and Big Brother and the Holding Company burst onto the big time music scene. Their lives were meshed together as they found themselves caught in the musical tidal wave that peaked in the Haight that summer. Janis came out to San Francisco from Texas to break into show business just as Joe had done a few years earlier from Southern California.\n\nCountry Joe and The Fish and Big Brother and the Holding Company were two happening bands along with the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Quicksilver Messenger Service. Joe and Janis often were billed together at the Fillmore and Avalon ballrooms during the early days of the San Francisco music explosion in the late 60's.\n\nJoe rarely spoke of his relationship with Janis. \"It was just a very normal love affair between two people who shared exciting times in the Haight,\" he often said.\n\nWhenever Joe could be prodded into talking about her, it became obvious that he, to this day, has very strong feelings for her. \"The first time I saw Janis was in early 1967 at a gig in San Francisco when Chet Helms introduced her on stage as a friend from Texas.\"\n\nJanis\n\nWe played a gig together right after her San Francisco gig in Berkeley at the Golden Sheaf Bakery. I was on acid. My little brother Billy was there.\"\n\nAfter the Golden Sheaf, Janis and Joe just got together. As their personal relationship developed, their bands played the same show at the Avalon. \"Soon I started spending nights with her at a flat she shared in San Francisco,\" said Joe. \"Later I moved in with her for a while when she got her own place-- actually I didn't have anyplace to live at the time.\"\n\nJoe and Janis had a brief and very normal boy friend-girl friend thing -- that's about it. They lived together for about three months and they became good friends. They experienced all the activities going on in the Haight/Ashbury. The couple seemed a good fit for each other, but like so many things in Janis' life, she burned with incredible intensity that may have proven to be too all consuming for Joe and they soon broke up.\n\nJoe maintained that the real reason for the break up was the constant interference from both of their careers. Joe said, \"I was never comfortable living in San Francisco. I considered Berkeley to be my town so I moved back-- it was as simple as that.\"\n\nJoe later ran into Janis from time to time at various concerts. At Woodstock Janis had been doing heroin, and her set with Kozmic Blues Band sounded somewhat disjointed. The set was filmed for inclusion in the Woodstock movie but never made the final cut. I am convinced if Janis had appeared with Big Brother and the Holding Company she would have been the star of both the festival and the subsequent movie. Janis brought a crowd of 10,000 to their feet two years earlier performing with Big Brother and the Holding Company at the Monterey Pop Festival and she could have done it again at Woodstock.\n\nI first met Janis on the 29th of June of 1967 after I hired Big Brother to play at California Hall for Albatross Productions. Albatross Productions was made up of myself, my brother Dennis and some teachers from my school. We thought we could make a make a buck off the hard core San Francisco music scene. One of the reasons such a rag tag group like Albatross was able to get Big Brother was because Rodney Albin, a friend and fellow San Francisco teacher, had put in a good word to his brother Peter Albin who just happened to be the bass player in Big Brother.\n\nOur gig was scheduled to go on ten days after the Monterey Pop Festival that had made a serious career breakthrough happen for both Big Brother and the Holding Company and Country Joe and The Fish. The Festival also showcased acts like Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and Otis Redding. We had no idea at the time what had just taken place in Monterey. It cost us the Albatross $750 to book Big Brother before the Monterey Pop Festival for one 45-minute set. By 1969, around the time of Woodstock, Janis was pulling down $50,000 per show and Country Joe and The Fish commanded $10,000. It was only a few years before that Joe and Janis had played in a bakery in Berkeley.\n\nED Denson (he spells his first name ED), Joe's former manager told me, \"The Fish needed to charge that much (in 1969) because we were about to go to war with China, and all American political subversives were going to be purged and put in jail.\" Denson said, \"We thought we needed to make a lot of money before that happened.\" I think Denson was putting me on as the war with China never did happen, but he made me think about it.\n\nWe expected a full house for the Big Brother show at California Hall, but only about 500 people showed up for the Tuesday night presentation -- lots of competition existed from The Fillmore and Family Dog and too bad for us it wasn't held on a Friday night. We were disappointed because we had made and distributed 1000 posters all over the Bay Area and we had advertised on radio KMPX. Milan Melvin a radio personality on KMPX was the emcee. Milan was upset, he said, \" I expected to see the line wrapped around the block -- Don't they know what just happened in Monterey?\" I shrugged my shoulders, as I had no idea what he was talking about. When Janis arrived she was by herself and dressed all in black. She did not go the dressing room, but hung out by the concession stand eating chips and drinking beer while checking out the small crowd. I experienced some weird sensations when I introduced myself to her and thanked her for appearing at the opening Albatross gig. She just looked at me, smiled and nodded her head.\n\nWe had hired a poster artist called Gut who charged us $200 to make a poster that would eventually become a collector's item. Seems Gut may have been a bit ripped when he was working and misspelled Big Brother spelling it \"Big Broter.\" Dave Pallavicini made the second Albatross poster for the 4th of July show featuring Blue Cheer and the New Salvation Army Banned. It was a red, white and blue poster with a guy looking like Uncle Sam in the middle pointing out with the typical \"I WANT YOU\" pose.\n\nAside from the lack of any profit on the show, we were all excited when Big Brother finally took the stage. The band played a series of thundering tunes right from the yet to be released LP Cheap Thrills. Just back from Monterey Pop they were primed and pumped up. Janis and the band tore the place up with \"Piece of My Heart\" then \"Down on Me\" driving our small audience crazy. When the set ended the foot stomping from the crowd brought Big Brother out again and they did an encore of \"Piece of My Heart.\"\n\nThe next time I saw Janis was three years later in 1970 at an annual Hell's Angels' party. It was held in San Rafael across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin. The place was called Pepperland (formerly the Citadel); it was basically a ballroom that was attached to a motel. It had a capacity of about 2,000 that soon filled up with wall-to-wall people.\n\nI was there as the manager of my band Gold that really lucked out getting on this huge bill. The lineup was Janis Joplin headlining with Big Brother and Full Tilt Boogie. Third bill was Gold, and Loose Gravel was the opening act.\n\nAt the time I was a 28-year-old Dean of Boy's working at Presidio Junior High in the Richmond District of San Francisco. I was excited about this event and met the band members at Pepperland after driving over there directly after work. When I arrived I stashed my tie and sport coat in the trunk of the car and put on my cowboy hat. It was surreal seeing the marquee listing Janis/Big Brother, Main Squeeze and Gold. Loose Gravel was not listed. The marquee had mistakenly listed Main Squeeze, a band she had briefly experimented with next to Big Brother when it should have said Full Tilt Boogie, but Janis wanted to surprise everyone.\n\nI went straight to the backstage dressing room. I had an incredible rush when I saw that we were in the same room with all the Big Brother members: Peter Albin, Sam Andrew, James Gurley, Dave Getz and Janis. Film star Michael J. Pollard (Bonnie and Clyde) was there and big time record producer Albert Grossman from LA was there. I also saw members of Full Tilt Boogie, a band that Janis had hand picked herself to record the yet to be released Pearl LP. The tension between the new and old bands was astounding. This gig was historic because it was to be the last time Janis would ever perform with Big Brother, and it was her first ever-public appearance with Full Tilt.\n\nSoon a huge buffalo sized Hell's Angel, the backstage manager, came in the room and blurted out, \"Hey Gold, get your asses on stage you have one minute.\" I walked out to the floor to get a handle on what was going on. Loose Gravel, a serious biker band, was finishing up their set with the heaviest riffs I had ever heard at that point in my life -- or at least it seemed that way. Loose Gravel, was led by Mike Wilhelm who I recognized as a former member of The Charlatans. They were red hot and shooting steam. I saw one Angel, with a far away look in his eyes, cracking a long black bullwhip for no apparent reason -- CRAAAAAAAAAAAK. Then another Angel appeared from across the room and he was also cracking a whip. The crowd just made space for them to crack those whips. I quickly went back to the band room again, lit a Kool and tried to look cool, calm and collected. I tried to tell Dennis about the guys with the whips but he just stared straight ahead with big eyes and said nothing. A few hours earlier I had been holding detention at the school -- I kept thinking about school.\n\nMoose, yet another massively sized Hell's Angel and the San Francisco chapter president, came back to reassure us that everything was just fine. Gold had gotten this gig because Moose often came to see the band play at Keystone Korner in North Beach, and he really liked the band. He was also a friend of my co-manager and brother Dennis. Moose had a hand in getting Gold an earlier gig with Malo and Hot Tuna at Longshoreman's Hall the year before at benefit for a clap clinic sponsored by the San Francisco Hell's Angels.\n\n\"Follow me, lets go -- it's Showtime boys\", the backstage manager yelled. Joe Bajza, the lead guitarist of Gold, chugged down what was left of his Colt 45 beer; he then strung his telecaster over his shoulder and headed for the door. Richard Coco, the lead singer, cinched up his tight fitting leather pants and left the room with bass player Chico Moncada, drummer Louis Goursau and conga player Sebastian Nicholson.\n\nShowtime took on a whole new meaning. Redheaded Ed Scott, rhythm guitar player for Gold, was determined but seemed a little shaky and pale as he pointed at with me his Gibson guitar. \"Hey man, I ain't going out there unless you come with me.\"\n\nI had no choice but to go, because my options were to stay in a room full of Hell's Angels, or to join an audience filled with hordes of Angels and some them cracking bullwhips. As we walked into the jammed packed dance floor towards the stage I noticed a large sign that said, \"Check Guns Here.\" I suddenly realized that I had to go to work at the school the next day. I was in charge of discipline. I don't know why I remembered that; it just came into my mind for no apparent reason. When we got to the stage it was packed solid with all the equipment of the four bands playing. I positioned myself on top of a speaker amplifier just slightly behind a curtain, and I had the best seat in the house for the show that unfolded during the next three hours.\n\nGold\n\nGold played like they were possessed and they were very well received. During the last Gold tune \"Season of the Witch\" Janis and Big Brother appeared back stage. Gold had played a very loud and powerful set -- they had to. Just as they were leaving the stage Janis yelled to Coco who was holding a cowbell to stay put. She shouted, \"Hey man, play some Latin on that cowbell will ya.\"\n\nWell what could Coco do? -- he played some Latin. Soon Janis and Coco were dancing all over the stage bumping asses in the process while Peter Albin started to lay down those wavery and wicked Big Brother bass riffs. During the first number a naked woman, jumped up on stage and started dancing around; then a naked man appeared out of nowhere, he jumped on top of her and all eyes shifted to them. Janis and Peter Albin went over to them and just stopped and looked. The man suddenly got up and jumped off the stage; then Janis gently told her to get off the stage. The woman quickly jumped back into the audience and started dancing by herself, seemingly oblivious to the thousands of Hell's Angels all around her. Strange things always happen at Hell's Angels parties. I observed that there were other naked people in the audience but no one seemed to notice. The smell of weed suddenly became overpowering.\n\nBig Brother then stepped up for what would be their final public set with Janis. Janis had a crew of women back stage who attended her during the set like handmaidens to a queen. After each tune or during a long James Gurley solo, Janis would skirt behind an amplifier and take big gulps from a bottle of whiskey handed to her by one of her girls while others wiped the sweat off her brow. She polished off an entire bottle of Southern Comfort and smoked several cigarettes during the set, and it didn't seem to faze her a bit. She seemed totally focused. The band concluded with Janis wailing on \"Down on Me\" to the roars of the frenzied and totally stoned Angels. Janis always put on an extremely high energy and vigorous performance that you had to see to believe.\n\nFinally, the highlight of the evening began with Janis introducing the members of her new band Full Tilt Boogie. John Till, Richard Bell, Ken Pearson, Clark Pearson, and Brad Campbell all stepped out. \"Sometimes I call them \"Pearl Bailey,\" she said. The audience went wild in Pepperland as the band played every tune from the forthcoming \"Pearl\" album note for note.\n\nAs the grand finale came, and the set ended, Janis simply passed out and fell hard over Gold's drum set knocking them all over the stage -- she appeared to be out cold. Some have said a Hell's Angel hit her over the head with a beer bottle, but I did not see that. A cymbal landed out in the crowd. Suddenly three very muscular Hell's Angels jumped up on stage and picked up her limp body high over their heads as if she were a wounded Viking. Janis' head was back and she was slack jawed. One of the Angels grabbed the microphone and bellowed, \"All right you fuckers, let's hear it for Janis Joplin.\" When Janis awoke backstage she asked some people in the room if she had done ok with the performance then she started crying because she couldn't remember what happened. She did a lot better than ok, she knocked the audience out -- tough to do at an Angel's party.\n\nThey had carried her off the stage while the huge crowd thundered applause yelling and screaming Janis, Janis, and Janis over and over. The screaming and yelling for Janis went on for a long time. She had given what may have been her greatest performance ever even surpassing her awesome performance in the Monterey Pop movie. The gig was finally over; I was completely dumfounded by the spectacle and totally speechless.\n\nJanis was found dead in a hotel room a few months after the Hell's Angels party. She was only 27 -- apparently the drugs and the booze had just killed her. Throughout her intense substance abuse, her raw talent was always obvious. Many of the musicians at that time had a serious run in with the drug scene and it led to the demise of many of them.\n\nJoe knew about drugs too but he avoided heroin and the life-style he viewed that was associated with it. He said, \"The Monterey Pop Festival in '67 was the peak of my psychedelic period. I took STP the day before we played, and I was really stoned out. Monterey Pop was the end of childhood for a lot of Bay Area bands. After Monterey, the big time record industry really hit San Francisco. The music scene made the cover of Time magazine and the whole business became commercial.\"\n\nJoe said, \"Two years after the Monterey Pop Festival, Janis performed at Woodstock. I thought she was trying too hard. She made the same mistake The Fish had made earlier when we played exhausted. I have this lingering memory of Janis at Woodstock. She looked bad, she was unhealthy looking and she was just plain angry. When Janis was together, she was really nice, but when she got junked she could be not so nice to be around. Janis could be a regular person whenever she felt like it. She was friendly but had a quick temper that got her into a lot of fights. She was ambitious, loved her career, and loved her dog George; she was a great singer and performer and I miss her.\"\n\nJoe wrote a song for her called Janis that he still performs to this day.\n\nJANIS\n\nCopyright © 1967 by Joe McDonald\n\nInto my life on waves of electrical sound\n\nand flashing light she came\n\ninto my life with the twist of a dial\n\nthe wave of her hand the warmth of her smile\n\nand even though I know that you and I\n\ncould never find the kind of love we wanted\n\ntogether alone -- I find myself missing you\n\n-- and I -- you and I.\n\nIts not very often that something special happens\n\nand you happen to be that something special for me\n\nwalking on grass where we rolled and laughed in the moonlight\n\nI find myself thinking of you\n\n-- and I -- you and I -- you and I.\n\nInto my eye come visions of patterns\n\ndesigns the image of her I see\n\ninto my mind the smell of her hair\n\nthe sound of her voice -- we once were there\n\nand even though I know that you and I\n\ncould never find the kind of love we wanted\n\ntogether alone I find myself missing you\n\n-- and I -- you and I -- you.\n\nT O P\n\nCHAPTER 6: COUNTRY JOE AND THE FISH\n\nJoe and Barry as the Frozen Jug Band\n\nCountry Joe and The Fish formed in Berkeley in 1965. Eugene \"ED\" Denson, the group's first manager, made up the name Country Joe and The Fish. Because Joe was the only member of the band named Joe, everyone started calling him Country Joe. It seemed fitting because, after all, Joe's parents named him after Stalin who was know as \"Country Joe\" during World War II. The \"Fish\" came from a Chairman Mao quote that Denson found in a book, \"The fish who swim in the sea of the people.\"\n\nThe band was started as just Joe and his friend Barry Melton who played lead guitar. The group was first known as the Instant Action Jug Band, before the name was changed. Throughout the life of the band, many members came and went, but Joe and Barry were constant. Keyboarder David Cohen, Gary \"Chicken\" Hirsh, the drummer, and Bruce Barthol on bass were all longtime members and contributors to the band. Several other musicians including Dave Getz, Peter Albin, Mark Kapner, Doug Metzner and Greg Dewey played off and on with Joe and Barry as members of The Fish.\n\nThe band with John Francis Gunning as drummer The \"classic\" Country Joe and The Fish The Woodstock band with Metzner, Kapner, and Dewey\n\nAs was true for many bands, the late 60's proved to be a golden age for Country Joe and The Fish.\n\nThe anti-war movement was really heating up as Country Joe and The Fish played their first gigs around the Bay Area.\n\nOriginal packaging of the \"talking issue\"\n\nJoe, Denson, and Mike Beardslee published Rag Baby, a little magazine out of Berkeley. On one issue Joe failed to produce enough copy, so he and Denson decided to put out a \"talking issue\" with his Anti-Vietnam protest tune on it. \" We went over to Chris Strachwitz' house and recorded it. We pressed it on a 33 & 1/3rd record, a new format at the time, and then we sold it at a teach-in against the War in Vietnam at the UC Berkeley Campus,\" said Joe. Denson said, \"We were \"uniting the folk scene\" and presenting new songs like \"Fire in the City\". Joe and I produced the two EP's. The first was sold in the magazine and the second was issued on its own. By that time the band and the record were more important than the magazine.\"\n\nIn 1967 Country Joe and The Fish had been signed by Vanguard Records and soon recorded \"Electric Music For the Mind and Body\" which was one of the first \"psychedelic\" records.\n\nDenson said, \" At the time the two big Bay Area venues were the Avalon Ballroom, run by Chet Helms, and the Fillmore with Bill Graham. The Avalon was hipper, the Fillmore paid better. Country Joe and The Fish were a bit marginal at both. We didn't quite have the commercial edge of the Jefferson Airplane, which gave Bill some qualms about hiring us often, and Helms felt that our politics were not hippie enough. Or perhaps it is better to say that having politics wasn't hippie. I do recall negotiating a record contract in the upstairs lobby of the Avalon while on acid, which seemed pretty hippie to me. The contract fell through however.\"\n\nWhen the Vanguard LP was finally ready for release Denson talked them into doing a release party at the Fillmore. The label hired the hall and booked Big Brother and the Holding Company and another band to play. They invited all the industry people, record store buyers and members of the media to come. Then they printed up invitation cards and handed them out in the Haight Ashbury. Thousands of people showed up -- way too many to get into the hall. This event was a very big success and really put the band on the map. Denson said, \" This showed that lots of people really wanted to hear the band's music.\"\n\nBy 1967 and 1968 Country Joe and The Fish was playing regularly at Fillmore West in San Francisco and Fillmore East in New York City. Thousands of Rock and Roll fans stood in long lines to get into the shows. Serious psychedelic fans timed their Saturday night acid trip to peak during The Fish set. In the early days, Country Joe and The Fish headlined over some newcomers and relative unknowns like the new group Led Zeppelin.\n\nTop billing for Country Joe and The Fish\n\nNot So Sweet Martha Lorraine\n\nShe hides in an attic concealed on a shelf\n\nBehind volumes of literature based on herself\n\nAnd runs across the pages like some tiny elf\n\nKnowing that it's hard to find\n\nStuff way back in her mind,\n\nWinds up spending all of her time\n\nTrying to memorize every line,\n\nSweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine.\n\nSweet lady of death wants me to die\n\nSo she can come sit by my bedside and sigh\n\nAnd wipe away the tears from all my friends eyes\n\nThen softly she will explain\n\nJust exactly who was to blame\n\nFor causing me to go insane\n\nAnd finally blow out my brain,\n\nSweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine.\n\nWell you know that it's a shame and a pity\n\nYou were raised up in the city\n\nAnd you never learned nothing 'bout country ways,\n\nAh, 'bout country ways.\n\nThe joy of life she dresses in black\n\nWith celestial secrets engraved in her back\n\nAnd her face keeps flashing that she's got the knack,\n\nBut you know when you look into her eyes\n\nAll she's learned she's had to memorize\n\nAnd the only way you'll ever get her high\n\nIs to let her do her thing and then watch you die,\n\nSweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine.\n\nNow she's the one who gives us all those magical things\n\nAnd reads us stories out of the I Ching,\n\nThen she passes out a whole new basket of rings\n\nThat when you put on your hand\n\nMakes you one of the Angel Band\n\nAnd gives you the power to be a man,\n\nBut what it does for her you never quite understand\n\nSweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine.\n\nWell you know that it's a shame and a pity\n\nYou were raised up in the city\n\nAnd you never learned nothing 'bout country ways,\n\nOh 'bout country ways, oh 'bout country ways,\n\nYeah, about country ways, oh, country ways ...\n\nJoe wrote the song \"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\" in the summer of 1965. He was living in a flat with his first wife Kathe. \" We had just come up to the Bay Area a few months before from Southern California. One day, a woman named Nina Serrano came to my place and asked me to write music for an anti-Vietnam War play opening at the UC Berkeley and San Francisco State campuses,\" Joe said. \"I started working right away and wrote 'Who am I' in three days.\"\n\nWho Am I ?\n\nWho am I\n\nTo stand and wonder, to wait\n\nWhile the wheels of fate\n\nSlowly grind my life away.\n\nWho am I ?\n\nThere were some things that I loved one time,\n\nBut the dreams are gone I thought were mine,\n\nAnd the hidden tears that once could fall\n\nNow burn inside at the thought of all\n\nThe years of waste, the years of crime\n\nPassions of a heart so blind;\n\nTo think that, but even still\n\nAs I stand exposed, the feelings are felt\n\nAnd I cry into the echo of my loneliness.\n\nWho am I\n\nTo stand and wonder, to wait\n\nWhile the wheels of fate\n\nSlowly grind my life away.\n\nWho am I ?\n\nWhat a nothing I've made of life\n\nThe empty words, the coward's plight\n\nTo be pushed and passed from hand to hand\n\nNever daring to speak, never daring to stand\n\nAnd the emptiness of my family's eyes\n\nReminds me over and over of lies\n\nAnd promises and deeds undone\n\nAnd now again I want to run\n\nBut now there is nowhere to run to.\n\nWho am I\n\nTo stand and wonder, to wait\n\nWhile the wheels of fate\n\nSlowly grind my life away.\n\nWho am I ?\n\nAnd now my friend we meet again\n\nWe shall see which one will bend\n\nUnder the strain of death's golden eyes\n\nWhich one of us shall win the prize\n\nTo live and which one will die\n\n'Tis I, my friend, yes 'tis I\n\nShall kill to live again and again\n\nTo clutch the throat of sweet revenge\n\nFor life is here only for the taking.\n\nWho am I\n\nTo stand and wonder, to wait\n\nWhile the wheels of fate\n\nSlowly grind my life away.\n\nWho am I ? Who am I ?\n\n\"After I finished the last verse to 'Who Am I,' I sat back in my chair relaxing and strummed some chords. \"I started writing 1-2-3 what are we fighting for? and so on, and in about 30 minutes, I finished the song -- the melody and lyrics just seemed to flow out of me.\" A Vietnam vet named Richard Hughes provides this memory he has of hearing the \"Fixin to Die Rag\" while he was in Vietnam. \"During the War the Army used to have psych-ops helo's. They would fly out at night and drop flyers and broadcast propaganda over VC positions. These things were noisy! They could be heard for miles -- loud speakers on the order of 40,000 Watts. When returning back over American positions they sometimes changed the record on more than one occassion I heard the \"Viet Nam Rag\" from those loudspeakers perhaps a mile away.\" James Sterba writing about Marines in Vietnam for the New York Times on July 14,1969 said, \"The lack of revelry here is most apparant at night. From inside the dusty tents comes quiet talk. There is no frolicking, and except for a few morbid jokes, little humor. Artillery guns boom explosives out of the camp throughout the night disturbing precious sleep. From a tape recorder in one bunker, came psychedelic sound seemingly more appropriate to Greenwich Village that to Vandegrift Combat Base: And its one , two, three, what are we fighting for? Don't ask me I don't give a damn, next stop is Vietnam... The song by the rock'n'roll group called Country Joe and The Fish is popular here. The only way to keep from blowing your mind here is to joke about death, said a member of the First Battalion. The nickname of the battalion is the Walking Dead. \"Worrying about dying is how guys get killed out here,\" said another.\n\nI-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag\n\nYeah, come on all of you, big strong men,\n\nUncle Sam needs your help again.\n\nHe's got himself in a terrible jam\n\nWay down yonder in Vietnam\n\nSo put down your books and pick up a gun,\n\nWe're gonna have a whole lotta fun.\n\nAnd it's one, two, three,\n\nWhat are we fighting for ?\n\nDon't ask me, I don't give a damn,\n\nNext stop is Vietnam;\n\nAnd it's five, six, seven,\n\nOpen up the pearly gates,\n\nWell there ain't no time to wonder why,\n\nWhoopee! we're all gonna die.\n\nWell, come on generals, let's move fast;\n\nYour big chance has come at last.\n\nGotta go out and get those reds \n\nThe only good commie is the one who's dead\n\nAnd you know that peace can only be won\n\nWhen we've blown 'em all to kingdom come.\n\nAnd it's one, two, three,\n\nWhat are we fighting for ?\n\nDon't ask me, I don't give a damn,\n\nNext stop is Vietnam;\n\nAnd it's five, six, seven,\n\nOpen up the pearly gates,\n\nWell there ain't no time to wonder why\n\nWhoopee! we're all gonna die.\n\nHuh!\n\nWell, come on Wall Street, don't move slow,\n\nWhy man, this is war au-go-go.\n\nThere's plenty good money to be made\n\nBy supplying the Army with the tools of the trade,\n\nJust hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,\n\nThey drop it on the Viet Cong.\n\nAnd it's one, two, three,\n\nWhat are we fighting for ?\n\nDon't ask me, I don't give a damn,\n\nNext stop is Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's five, six, seven,\n\nOpen up the pearly gates,\n\nWell there ain't no time to wonder why\n\nWhoopee! we're all gonna die.\n\nWell, come on mothers throughout the land,\n\nPack your boys off to Vietnam.\n\nCome on fathers, don't hesitate,\n\nSend 'em off before it's too late.\n\nBe the first one on your block\n\nTo have your boy come home in a box.\n\nAnd it's one, two, three\n\nWhat are we fighting for ?\n\nDon't ask me, I don't give a damn,\n\nNext stop is Vietnam.\n\nAnd it's five, six, seven,\n\nOpen up the pearly gates,\n\nWell there ain't no time to wonder why,\n\nWhoopee! we're all gonna die.\n\nThe late days of the 60's were the most frantic for The Fish. I went to a 1968 Bill Graham Fillmore concert in San Francisco that headlined Country Joe and The Fish, Steppenwolf and a local band called The Flamin' Groovies. The hall was packed like sardines and the smell of weed and incense was unmistakable. Giant red and black balloons were flying all over the ballroom. A paisley patterned light show was shimmering on the wall behind the stage -- a kind of pulsating purple glow appeared on and off. A topless woman in a long hippie style skirt took up a strategic position right in front of the massive public address system. Someone threw a large bouquet of flowers on to the stage. I was totally stoned from the dope smoke, and the whole scene was freaky -- surreal.\n\nSteppenwolf in a wild fury shook the house. John Kay and his group were riding high on their smash hits \"Born to be Wild\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride,\" and they kicked ass. Soon it was time for the headliner to appear. Country Joe and The Fish attacked the stage at midnight to a heavy surge of audience energy. Joe grabbed the microphone cord and swung it around like a soul singer. Chicken Hirsh laid down a steady and soul-style drum beat, then Barry Melton stepped forward and belted out in his raspy voice, \" we want to dedicate this song to L.B.J.\" The band broke out into Super bird, and the audience went crazy.\n\nSuperbird\n\nWell, look up yonder in the sky what is that I pray ?\n\nYeah, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's a man insane,\n\nIt's my president, whew, L.B.J.\n\nI said he's flyin' high way up in the sky just like Superman,\n\nBut I got a little piece of kryptonite,\n\nI'm gonna, whew, bring him back to land.\n\nI said come out Lyndon with your hands held high,\n\nDrop your guns, baby, reach for the sky.\n\nI got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance,\n\nSend you back to Texas, make you work on your ranch,\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWell, he can call Super Woman and his Super Dogs,\n\nBut it won't do him no good,\n\nYeah, I found out why from a Russian spy\n\nHe ain't nothin' but a comic book.\n\nWe're gonna pull him off the stands and clean up the land,\n\nWe're gonna start us a brand new day.\n\nAnd what is more I got the Fantastic Four\n\nAnd Spiderman to help him on his way.\n\nI said come out Lyndon with your hands held high,\n\nDrop your guns, baby, reach for the sky.\n\nI got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance,\n\nGonna send you back to Texas, make you work on your ranch,\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, we're gonna make him an agricultural worker ...\n\nPart of his own poverty program.\n\nThe next song Joe dedicated to Mr. James Brown. With \"Rock and Soul\", Joe tried to prove that rock music has soul too if you can \"dig it.\"\n\nRock and Soul Music\n\nHmm...\n\nWe'd like to take this opportunity now to play you a little thing that we learned from Mr. James Brown the King of soul music.
