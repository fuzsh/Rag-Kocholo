        "text": "I just learned reading the AFM Local 1000 newsletter of the passing of the remarkable Faith Petric at 98 seven months ago via a fine obit by Joe Jencks. Visit here for a number of moving and well composed blog posts by Faith’s daughter.\n\nBorn halfway between Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger in 1915, Faith had become a guiding spirit of the San Francisco folk singing scene half a century (or half her lifetime) ago. With a vast knowledge of folk songs and a commitment to both community and radical change, Faith inspired several generations, including such artists as Holly Near, Cathy Fink, and Marcy Marxer.\n\nI met Faith at the initial Folk Alliance gathering organized by Elaine and Clark Weissman in Malibu in 1989. A living Wobby and a living Rosie the Riveter Liberty ship builder, there representing the San Francisco Folk Club she had led since 1962 and Sing Out! as a board member and contributor. Faith’s career as a full time folk singer began in 1970 and lasted until September 11, 2010.\n\nA 2010 profile can be found here."
