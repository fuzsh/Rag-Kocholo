        "text": "North of Okemah a few blocks on Woody Guthrie Blvd (which turns into N3770 Rd) is Highland Cemetery. The cemetery contains the graves for Woody Guthrie's family: his sister, Clara Edna (who was burned to death in 1918), and Woody's parents, Nora Belle and Charley Edward Guthrie.\n\nWoody Guthrie also has a grave marker at Highland (even though he was cremated and his ashes spread at Coney Island). Guthrie's marker is engraved with the words \"Bound For Glory,\" and a self-portrait cartoon drawn by him."
