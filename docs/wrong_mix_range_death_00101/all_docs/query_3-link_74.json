        "text": "Wearing a palomino-colored cowboy hat, an L.L. Bean fleece jacket, well-broken-in jeans and a blue bandana tied loosely around his neck, 91-year-old Ramblin’ Jack Elliott arrives at our lunchtime interview with a genial grin on his still-handsome face and a lifetime of stories to tell.\n\nIt’s a sunny, windless, perfectly pleasant December afternoon as we settle into a table on an outdoor deck at Nick’s Cove, a picturesque seafood restaurant overlooking Tomales Bay in the boatyard town of Marshall.\n\nMarin’s own folk music icon, a two-time Grammy winner, Elliott, in his ranch wear regalia, looks like my idea of an old-time West Marin cowboy, but he gently disabuses me of that notion.\n\n“Normally, I never wear a cowboy hat around here because Marin cowboys don’t wear a cowboy hat in public,” he says. “They wear a ball cap. And they don’t herd cattle on a horse. They herd cattle on a four-wheeler.”\n\nAs one of the last of the original traveling troubadours and storytellers in the authentic American folk tradition, Elliott sprinkles that kind of esoterica among stories about his years as Woody Guthrie’s sidekick, his mentorship of a young Bob Dylan, becoming friends with the Grateful Dead and inspiring a couple of English schoolboys, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, to become musicians. His filmmaker daughter Aiyana, who directed an acclaimed documentary about her dad, “The Ballad of Ramblin’ Jack,” and now manages his career, describes him as “a Zelig of American beatnik, hippie and Western culture.”\n\nAmong the younger generation of folk singers in the sagebrush style, Elliott is the wellspring, a living link to a musical past they celebrate and keep alive by preserving it and making it their own.\n\n“For those of us who play old-time music, play cowboy songs and try to take on this troubadour style, Jack is the guy who showed us how that’s done,” says Andy Hedges, a 42-year-old Texan who describes himself as a songster, reciter, storyteller, guitarist and collector of cowboy songs and poems. “Jack’s someone who has this connection to all these people and this older part of America. He’s been a master of that style — one guy on a stage singing old songs and telling stories — and it’s hard to think of that tradition existing without Jack.”\n\nHedges features Elliott as the centerpiece of a new double album, “Roll on Cowboys,” set to drop next month that includes a dozen guest artists, among them Tom Russell and Michael Martin Murphey. Elliott sings three songs with Hedges on the record, including the 19th century blues ballad “Railroad Bill.” Hedges got permission to open the new version with a clip of the only surviving recording of Elliott and Guthrie performing that song with the bluesman Sonny Terry on harmonica.\n\n“It’s kind of cool to hear Jack in his 20s and then at 90 years old at the time of the recording,” says Hedges, adding that Elliott’s singing and storytelling have aged as well as he has. “Jack’s got a way of existing in the world that makes people want to be around him and spend time with time with him and listen to his stories.”\n\nAmong folkies, it’s well known how Elliott got his nickname, bestowed upon him by the mother of the late folk singer Odetta, not because of his itinerant lifestyle, but because of his meandering way of spinning yarns. When he arrived at Odetta’s house one day for a visit, her mother opened the door, saw who it was and called out, “Odetta, Ramblin’ Jack’s here.” He’s been Ramblin’ Jack ever since.\n\nUncanny memory\n\nA recent New York Times profile said Elliott’s stories “blur the line between reality and fantasy, and translate as a particular, increasingly endangered strain of American folklore.”\n\nThat sounds mostly right, except for the fantasy part. When you’ve lived a life as long and colorful and adventure-filled as Ramblin’ Jack’s, there’s no need to make anything up.\n\nBlessed with uncanny long-term memory, he recalls dates and times, places and people in minute detail — from the address in Boston where he first met Joan Baez (apartment 2-G) to the cars he drove on his Kerouac-like road trips (Model A Ford, Hudson Terraplane, 1937 Plymouth coupe, green 1948 Chevrolet four-door) to where he was and what he was doing on Oct. 3, 1967, when he heard that Guthrie, his hero, had died of Huntington’s disease, a genetic brain disorder, at 55.\n\n“I was in New Mexico, buying a horse from some people and was helping them move furniture into their new house,” he remembers. “They heard the news over the radio, sat me down in a chair and said, ‘Jack, we have some sad news for you.’ After they told me, we decided to knock off work, go to a neighboring ranch and take a nice long horseback ride.”\n\nI saw Elliott earlier this month at a sold-out show at Mill Valley’s Sweetwater Music Hall. He sat on a stool on stage, his silvery hair poking out from under his Stetson as he strummed his big acoustic guitar and sang songs like Dylan’s “I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight” and the English folk song “The Cuckoo,” accompanied on guitar by Grateful Dead co-founder Bob Weir, who told a rapt crowd about the unusual circumstances under which he and Elliott met.\n\nWeir recalls that he was a folk music-crazed teenager when he went to see country blues singer Lightnin’ Hopkins at a Bay Area club but couldn’t get in because he was underage. Undaunted, he shinnied up a drainpipe to the roof, dropped down through a skylight “ninja style” and found himself backstage, face-to-face with Ramblin’ Jack, the opening act.\n\nJack thought the future rock star was somebody named Billy who was supposed to be bringing him a motorcycle. Weir didn’t know what to think. But he sensed that he was in the presence of an old soul.\n\n“We’ve been friends ever since,” Weir says.\n\nElliott was also an admirer of the Grateful Dead’s reluctant leader, the late Jerry Garcia, sharing the same birthday: Aug. 1. They also shared the same kind of ineffable charisma.\n\n“Jerry was a wonderful guy,” he says. “He had a great spirit and a wonderful sense of humor. He was always smiling.”\n\nOn the road\n\nElliott had a busy fall, playing nine gigs in 18 days, including a John Prine tribute concert at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville and two shows at Nashville’s historic Ryman Auditorium, opening for the 56-year-old singer-songwriter and storyteller Todd Snider, another performer in the Ramblin’ Jack tradition.\n\nElliott’s still thrilled by the standing ovation Snider’s young audience gave him, showing me a cellphone photo of the crowd on its feet.\n\n“They’d heard about me from their grandpa,” he says and laughs. “I slept 12 hours a day for three weeks when I got home.”\n\nElliott has had a long and complicated relationship with Bob Dylan. They first met when Dylan was a fresh-faced 19-year-old, a budding folk singer who had just arrived in New York from the small town in Minnesota where he grew up. Like Elliott before him, he sought out the great Woody Guthrie, whose health was rapidly failing. Elliot was by then an established folk singer who had just returned from Europe. Rather than see this young wannabe as an interloper or threat, getting between himself and Guthrie, he was big hearted enough to take him under his wing, going so far as to get him into the musicians’ union.\n\n“I thought he was a really cute kid,” Elliott remembers and smiles. “He was 19 years old and couldn’t grow a beard. He told me he had all my records and which songs he liked best.”\n\nWhen Elliott moved into Manhattan’s Earle Hotel, now the Washington Square Hotel, Dylan followed him.\n\n“So we saw an awful lot of each other for about a year,” he says. “We were in each other’s rooms constantly. He was just beginning to write songs. He’d ask how Woody played and sang. Because Woody was so sick and could hardly speak, Bob was always asking me questions about him.”\n\nDylan had become a superstar by 1975 when he invited Elliott to join him on the Rolling Thunder Revue, a storied tour of intimate venues also featuring Baez, Joni Mitchell and other name performers. It was immortalized in a 2019 film by Martin Scorsese.\n\nAfter that triumph, Elliott saw less and less of his former protégé. Remembering their history together, he was hurt by the distance growing between them. The gap began to close in 2014 after a Dylan concert in Oakland. Elliott initiated a brief exchange before his old friend disappeared into his tour bus.\n\n“I said, ‘I love you, Bob,” he remembers. “He said, ‘I love you, Jack.’ Then he said, ‘912 Greens,’ which is one of only a couple of songs I ever wrote. That was about it.”\n\nAfter a recent Dylan concert at the Fox Theater in Oakland, their good feelings for each other returned in a rush. Backstage after the show, they enjoyed what Elliott describes as “a very joyous conversation.” This is how he remembers it:\n\n“He said, ‘You look good, Jack,’ and I said, ‘You look good, Bob.’ He said, ‘I’m 81. I’m catching up with you.’ He was jubilant, just like a kid. I felt great, very happy. Some of the band members were eavesdropping and I could see they were getting a kick out of it, too. I don’t think we were there more than 10 minutes, but I felt a lot better.”\n\nAfter two gig-less years during the pandemic, Elliott is enjoying the resumption of a performing career that goes back to the first wave of the 1950s folk music revival, when he was a major figure alongside the likes of Pete Seeger, Baez, Judy Collins, Peter, Paul and Mary and, above all, Guthrie, a legendary folk balladeer and leftist political activist who wrote “This Land Is Your Land” as kind of an alternative national anthem and famously played a guitar with “This machine kills fascists” written on it.\n\n“I was one of the first people to hear that song and the first person to sing it in England,” Elliott says. “I loved it. But I grew quite tired of it after about 15 years. I don’t care how great a song is, if you sing it long enough, you’ll get tired of it.”\n\nWith his then-wife, June, Elliott spent six years in Europe, touring and recording several albums. As one story goes, he was waiting at an English station for a train to London when he got his guitar out of its case and began singing cowboy songs to pass the time and entertain whoever was within earshot. A couple of English schoolboys on the opposite platform were drawn to the music, having never heard an American folk singer before, and crossed over the tracks to listen.\n\n“Mick Jagger tells me he was one of those two kids,” Elliott says. “The other was Keith Richards. Mick said he ran right out and bought a guitar. That’s how he was initially influenced by me.”\n\nNew persona\n\nBorn Elliott Charles Adnopoz in Brooklyn, New York, young Elliott recoiled at the thought of following in the footsteps of his father, a prominent Jewish physician who wanted his son to become a surgeon. Elliott had less conventional dreams. Caught up in the romance of the West, he ran away from home at 15 to join the traveling JE Ranch Rodeo and Wild West Show, getting a job as a saddle horse groom for $2 a day.\n\nThis was the beginning of the new persona he was creating for himself. This son of a Jewish doctor from Brooklyn was now calling himself Buck Elliott, reckoning he’d like to try his hand at riding broncos. After lasting less than two-tenths of a second on the back of his first bucking horse, a less dangerous future was sealed when he heard his first singing cowboy, a rodeo clown named Brahmer Rogers.\n\n“He played guitar, banjo and sang cowboy songs for us rodeo hands between shows,” Elliott recalls. “That rodeo cowboy inspired me to buy my first guitar.”\n\nFour years later, at 19, he found his way to Guthrie, who was just beginning to feel the effects of the disease that would kill him and had been in and out of hospitals with various ailments. After hitchhiking back to New York from a visit to California, Elliott phoned Guthrie, who invited him to come over and bring his guitar. Elliott still remembers the address, 120 University Place in Greenwich Village. When Elliott arrived, Guthrie was putting on a concert for a group of people in an upstairs apartment, using a closet as a green room.\n\n“He was in there so the rest of the people couldn’t see him,” Elliott recalls. “So, when the time was right, he would come out and play. They were asking for requests. He was charging a nickel a song. But if they asked for a Burl Ives song, he’d say, ‘I get five cents extra for those.’”\n\nElliott became Guthrie’s sideman when they busked together in the Village’s Washington Square Park, earning enough spare change to finance their road trips. I asked Elliott what was the most important thing he learned from his hero about music? It was advice that musicians today would be wise to take to heart.\n\n“The first thing he taught me was try not to play so fancy,” he says. “I was workin’ on my pickin’ and I was doin’ a lot of high-speed pickin’. Woody said, ‘Just give me some rhythm. Just give me a strong, clean rhythm and don’t play all those little notes. I’ll play the little notes.’”\n\nWhile Guthrie was a devoted champion of working people, Elliott wanted to be a working man, or at least live among them, enjoying the company of sailors and cowpokes, truck drivers and rodeo riders.\n\n“It’s always amazed me about Jack that he knows so many famous people and yet what he seems to most proud of and most interested in are his working-class friends,” Hedges says. “It doesn’t make a bit of difference to Jack if you’re famous or not.”\n\nWhile in San Francisco during one of his cross-country rambles, he worked for several weeks on an 1896 German pilot schooner named Wander Bird and became shipmates with Commodore Tompkins, a Sausalito sailing legend who celebrated his 90th birthday this year.\n\n“When I first met Commodore,” Elliott says, “I told him my name was Buck Elliott. Commodore isn’t very good at remembering names. So when he introduced me to his mother, he said, ‘This is Jack Elliott.’ I didn’t want to embarrass him by correcting him, so I thought that they can call me Jack for a while.” As it turned out, he was Jack from then on.\n\nMaking Marin home\n\nElliott has lived in a modest bungalow on the West Marin coast for nearly 30 years, longer than he’s ever been in one place.\n\n“Jack has said this is the first time he’d felt he’s really part of a community,” says Venta Leon, one of his closest friends. “He’s a local hero. People know him, love him, respect him.”\n\nMarried five times, Elliott’s last wife, Jan, affectionately known as Ramblin’ Jan, died in 2001. I remember how devastated he was when she died, and have admired his resiliency in her absence, his ability to remain the same upbeat, outgoing character who has enthralled fans and friends alike for his whole long career.\n\n“He’s a charming guy,” says Marin musician Tim Weed, a longtime friend. “He’s got this sparkle in his eye.”\n\nElliott has recorded dozens of albums over the years and won a pair of Grammys — for the folk collection “South Coast” in 1995 and for the underappreciated “A Stranger Here,” his last studio record, which won for best traditional blues album in 2009. Cowboy singer-songwriter Andy Hedges says, “He may be the best interpreter of songs I’ve ever heard.” But without songwriter royalties, Elliott has had to earn a living on the road.\n\n“He hasn’t been able to capitalize on music or make much money from it, but he’s certainly lived a rich life,” Aiyana Elliott says. “It’s that excitement about life and people and what’s around the next bend that has kept him going and is still keeping him going.”\n\nElliott will next perform Feb. 25 at the HopMonk Tavern in Novato. Go to ramblinjackelliott.com/new-events/2023/2/25/novato-ca-hopmonk-tavern.\n\nAnd he’ll be at the 38th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, on Feb. 1, an event he hasn’t missed in 32 years.\n\nAs our long lunch wound down and a late afternoon chill came off the bay, there was time for one last question or two.\n\nElliott has bounced back from some past health issues — triple bypass surgery years ago, a couple of minor strokes, a hip replacement. I asked him how he feels at 91.\n\n“Like I’m 123,” he says, cracking me up. I told him that I think about my own mortality as I age and wanted to know if he does, too. He answered that he doesn’t dwell on it. Over the years, he’s learned to celebrate the past, live fully in the present and not worry too much about what may or may not be next.\n\n“The future?” he says. “I don’t have any future. It will be here no matter what I do or try to do.” And then, adding with a sly grin: “I think the future’s gonna be here approximately tomorrow.”\n\nContact Paul Liberatore at p.liberatore@comcast.net"
