        "text": "Woody Guthrie has been gone for half a century, almost as long as he spent on Earth, but his presence has lost none of its totemic power. Even in his final decade, when he was suffering from Huntington’s Disease, the cruel condition that ended his life in 1967 at the age of 55, Guthrie served as the North Star for a rising generation of folk music-inspired troubadours.\n\nNext week his spirit and kin will be residing at Berkeley’s Freight & Salvage with a series of events celebrating his music and legacy. The Guthriepalooza kicks off Sunday afternoon with a free community sing-along led by Robin Flower and Libby McLaren.\n\nWoody’s son Arlo Guthrie settles into the Freight on Tuesday for a three-night engagement as part of the Re:Generation Tour (which also plays Napa’s Uptown Theatre April 14). Fresh off of celebrating the 50th anniversary of “Alice’s Restaurant,” his classic recording memorializing the world’s most famous citation for littering, Arlo arrives with family in tow. Abe Guthrie has accompanied his father on keyboards and vocals for more than two decades, while his sister, respected singer/songwriter Sarah Lee Guthrie, is also part of the band.\n\nGiven the present administration in Washington, D.C., Woody’s protest material figures prominently in the mix, “but we just have some fun too, with some good-old songs that are fun to play, like ‘Shady Grove,’” Sarah Lee says. “People forget that dad’s a great flatpicker. There’s a playful dynamic that reminds people music can be a family affair.”\n\nThe Guthrie celebration concludes on April 13-14 with the Freight & Salvage Woody Guthrie All Stars, an expanded version of Peter Glazer’s award-winning production “Woody Guthrie’s American Song.” An associate professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies, Glazer created the musical in 1988 to bring out Guthrie’s sly humor and storytelling as well as delivering well-known songs (“Bound for Glory” and “This Land Is Your Land”) alongside lesser-known tunes (“Jolly Banker” and “Ludlow Massacre”).\n\nCelebrating Guthrie’s 100th birthday in 2012, Glazer created a concert staging for the Freight, and for these performances the original cast is joined by a cavalcade of Bay Area luminaries, including Berwick Haynes, Evie Ladin, Laurie Lewis, Tony Marcus, Misner & Smith, Lucina Rodriguez and Fabiola Trujillo, Tom Rozum, Linda Tillery, and Harry Yaglijian.\n\nFor the Guthries, family transcends blood lines. The last time she performed at the Freight in 2014, as part of the duo with her husband Johnny Irion, Sarah Lee Guthrie remembers it was the week that Pete Seeger died and that there was a line down the block for the “Goodnight, Pete” tribute concert.\n\n“We talk about Pete a lot, and he’s a real presence in our show,” she says. “He and Woody had this great friendship and he was part of our bigger family. He was a master of the power of songs, and we’ve been alluding to some of his songs and stories. We go from there to some of my dad’s relevant songs and Woody’s songs that are all too relevant today, like ‘Deportee,’ which was written about 80 years ago.”\n\nMusic isn’t just a family tradition for the Guthries. It’s a binding force that has allowed an oft-itinerant clan to stay connected. Sarah Lee didn’t see her father much when she was growing up, since he was always on the road. Instead of going off to college, she started touring with him, joining in for a few songs every night.\n\nShe was hardly a polished performer, “But now we have this relationship that’s really built upon performing together,” she says. “We were talking yesterday and he said ‘I’m kind of a guy who allows people to do what they need to do and make those mistakes.’ I feel really grateful for that. He allowed me to make those mistakes on his stage, in his setting, with a faith in me that I would learn. Now, after a concert, a sacred experience, we can come down together and share the parts that were funny, and laugh at ourselves. Being able to share a scotch after the show is something I very much look forward to.”\n\nContact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com.\n\nWOODY GUTHRIE REMEMBERED\n\nBerkeley’s Freight & Salvage is hosting a few events/concerts commemorating Woody Guthrie:\n\nWoody Guthrie Sing-Along: 1 p.m. April 8, free but reservations required\n\nArlo Guthrie Re:Generation Tour: 8 p.m. April 10-12; $60-$64\n\nWoody Guthrie All Stars: 8 p.m. April 13-14; $28-$32"
