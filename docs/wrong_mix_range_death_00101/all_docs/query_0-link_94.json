        "text": "In the haunting shadows of history, where the whispers of time echo the melodies of the past, we gather to celebrate the birth of a bard whose voice resonated through the corridors of despair and hope alike—Woody Guthrie. Born on this day, July 14th, 1912, Guthrie emerged as a troubadour of the downtrodden, a harbinger of truth wrapped in the simple strums of his guitar.\n\nCole Quest and the City Pickers are a group of New York City musicians connected by friendship and a love of bluegrass. Quest, grandson of the folk icon Woody Guthrie, has brought together a collection of eclectic pickers who have gained recognition on the local scene. Performing both Quest's original tunes as well as traditional favorites, the City Pickers bring their special brand of high-spirited talent to the stage, with up-beat, knee-slapping energy and a high-lonesome sound that’ll leave you wanting more.\n\nFront Country isn’t just a cover band. I started exploring their original music which is perfectly crafted and powerful. Their talent as a group is undeniable, each musician bringing a special gift. Though I must call out Melody Walker for lead vocals, guitar and percussion. She reminds me of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. She also embodies artist like Diana Ross, Anita Baker, Nora Jones, Alicia Key and Jennifer Hudson. All spectacular company.\n\nTo coincide with the 50th Anniversary of the death of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie, two concerts dedicated to celebrating his life and work will be held in early October.\n\nWoody Guthrie: Songs of Freedom, will be performed at the Caravan Music Club on Sunday 1 October, the Spotted Mallard on Friday 6 October and the Newport Bowl Club on Saturday 2 December, all spearheaded by Strange Tenants frontman Bruce Hearn.\n\nFor the 2nd week The Del McCoury Band’s Del & Woody, a collection of lyrics left behind by Woody Guthrie and put to music by McCoury, reached #1 on the Billboard Bluegrass chart. As best we can tell (with help from the Woody Guthrie Center), a few songs of Woody’s have charted on radio before, but no project that included only his songs has ever risen to the top of the Billboard album chart. McCoury—who at 77 is no stranger to the top of the c\n\nAmerican folk and protest music legend Woody Guthrie has influenced generations of singer-songwriters. His optimistic vision of the United States was as a land of opportunity, equality, and freedom for all. Though hundreds of his treasured songs have been preserved, they still need to be continued through the vitality of living musicians. To the joy of the folk, country, bluegrass and Americana community, iconic vocalist and guitarist Del McCoury took on the bold task of upholding Guthrie’s legacy.\n\nDel McCoury is at it again. At 77 years young he is still very excited about music and creating projects that will be enjoyed by generations to come. This one might just be the most talked about as it’s rare for two artists to team up on music separated by 70+ years…some of these lyrics were written the year Del was born, but with Woody’s timeless lyrics, and Del’s timeless sound, nothing matters but the songs.\n\nWoody Guthrie may be more popular in the 21st century than he ever was in the 20th. The unexpected success of Mermaid Avenue — the 1998 and 2000 albums of Woody Guthrie lyrics set to music by Billy Bragg, Wilco and others —have sparked a resurgence of interest in Guthrie’s own recordings.\n\nZ2 Entertainment is proud to present Here Comes the Kid….Arlo Guthrie’s Solo Tribute to Woody to the Boulder Theater on Saturday, March 30th, 2013. Tickets will go on sale to the public on Friday, November 2nd, 2012 at 10:00 am for $30 general admission seated, $40 reserved & $47.50 gold circle.Arlo pays tribute to his father, Woody Guthrie, American folk artist for his 100th birthday!Throughout his own career Arlo Guthrie has honored his father in song as well as in life."
