        "text": "Traversing the United States as well as seminal periods in our history, Woody Guthrie told the story of people struggling to make a life across our country. With his beat-up guitar and harmonica, he put to music and words the plight of Dust Bowl refugees, deportees and workers unionizing for decent wages to name just a few.\n\nOne of the most significant figures in American folk music, Woody’s songs, such as “This Land is Your Land” and “This Train is Bound for Glory,” inspired several generations. Married three times and the father of eight children (including singer/songwriter Arlo Guthrie), Woody also wrote children’s songs. I used to love singing his “Ridin’ in My Car” to my children whenever we went for a drive.\n\nThanks to David M. Lutken’s musical portrait of Woody, new generations can receive a glimpse of this difficult man’s life during difficult times. “Woody Sez: The Life and Music of Woody Guthrie” features Lutken as Woody with Darcie Deaville, David Finch and Megan Loomis in supporting roles. The inspiring work follows Woody from his early childhood through the Depression, World War II and to his death from complications of Huntington’s disease. The disease also took his mother and two of his daughters. Sales from CDs at the performance will benefit research into the disease.\n\nMichael Butler, the artistic director of Walnut Creek’s Center Repertory Company, introduced the performers as “Jedi,” and I would have to agree. The Force was certainly with this multitalented quartet the night I saw the show. Moving easily from guitars to banjos to fiddles to stand-up bass, mouth harps and more (more than 20 instruments!), these consummate performers bring the best of the American spirit alive.\n\nWhile all are equally impressive, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Deaville’s fiery fiddling or Loomis’ impressive moves on the standup bass. Not to be outdone, Finch and Lutken add fun physical moves as they play and sing their hearts out, with Lutken’s melodious voice perfect as the main narrator. In keeping with the folk tradition, all the music is unamplified. Fortunately, the performers have well trained vocal instruments capable of reaching the back rows of the Margaret Lesher Theater.\n\nThis high-spirited celebration of Woody’s music and the American spirit doesn’t stop when the performance ends. Hootenannies with cast members after Sunday matinees will take place. The free event encourages audience members to bring an instrument, sing along or clap to the rhythms. Barbecue picnics from 4:40 to 7 p.m. June 8, 15 and 22 in the Lesher Center Plaza are also planned. The show runs through June 23 at Walnut Creek’s Lesher Center for the Arts, 1601 Civic Drive. For tickets, call 925-943-SHOW or go to lesherartscenter.org.\n\nBerkeley: Join 12-year-old Josh Baskin as he deals with a mom who insists on hugging him in public; disgusting chores like taking out the garbage; and a cute girl next door would doesn’t notice him. When it all becomes too much, Josh wishes he was big only to wake up the next morning in the body of a 30-year-old man. Now, this boy in a man’s body must navigate the unknown adult world of jobs, girlfriends and fancy foods. If you haven’t guessed by now, this is the stage version of Tom Hank’s hit movie “Big.”\n\nBerkeley Playhouse presents this fun musical June 21 through July 28 in the beautiful Julia Morgan Center at 2640 College Ave. in Berkeley. Directed by Ryan Weible with Rachel Robinson as music director and Staci Arriaga as choreographer, the show reminds us that anyone can be a child at heart and maturity comes in all sizes. The dynamite cast includes Adam Niemann as the “adult” Josh with Jonah Horowitz and Joe Krenn alternating as 12-year-old Josh. For tickets, call 510-845-8542, ext. 351, or go to berkeleyplayhouse.org.\n\nEl Cerrito: Also producing a show that appeals to the young and young at heart is Contra Costa Civic Theatre. Inspired by Hans Christian Anderson’s “The Little Mermaid,” the musical “Once on this Island” will end the company’s season on a sweet note.\n\nTelling the tale of a fearless peasant girl in search of her place in the world, the show features a diverse cast headed by Tanaka Dunbar Ngwara as Ti Moune, Journi Copes Harvey as Little Ti Moune and Anita Viramontes as Mama Euralie. Salim Razawi directs with Enrico Banson as music director and Amanda Boyan as choreographer. The heartwarming story runs June 14 through July 21 at 951 Pomona Ave. in El Cerrito. Call 510-524-9012 or go to ccct.org.\n\nSan Francisco: For a total change of pace, try the 10th Anniversary Legacy Revival of Luis Alfaro’s “Oedipus el Rey” at the Magic Theatre.\n\n“If plays are indeed living breathing organisms that reflect the times we are in, then my adaptation of the Greek classic continues to be an outlet for me in challenging the mystery of our obsession with youth and incarceration,” says playwright Alfaro.\n\nSet in South Central Los Angeles, “Oedipus el Rey” is a gritty take on the Greek tragedy. Here Oedipus is a young man trying to imagine a life beyond the desperation and violence of the prison walls where he’s spent most of his life. The show runs through June 23 at the Magic Theatre located in Fort Mason at 2 Marina Blvd., Building D, in San Francisco. Call 415-441-8822 or go to magictheatre.org."
