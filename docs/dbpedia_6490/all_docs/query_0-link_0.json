        "text": "Template:Infobox Defunct Company\n\nVerran Sparebank was a Norwegian savings bank, located at Venneshamn in Mosvik municipality from 1907 to 2006. It merged with Grong Sparebank in 2006, who took over its assets and local customers. The bank had assets of NOK 85 million and three employees when it ceased operation in 2006.\n\nHistory[]\n\nVerran Sparebank was founded in 1907 to serve as a local bank for the municipalities of Verran and Mosvik. Already in 1909 the bank got its first female chairman. The bank was a member of the Terra bank alliance, and was one of four savings banks in the county of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag to remain independent. The others joined the regional Sparebanken Midt-Norge. Because Grong Sparebank, Verran Sparebank's merger partner, was one of the other independent savings banks, that number of independent savings banks is currently reduced to three.\n\nAt the time of merger, Verran Sparebank was the smallest independent bank in Norway.\n\nno:Verran Sparebank"
