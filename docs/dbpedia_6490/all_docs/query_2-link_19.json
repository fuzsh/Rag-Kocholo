Here are some pages that you might find helpful:\n\nThe five pillars of Wikipedia\n\nHow to edit a page\n\nHelp pages\n\nTutorial\n\nHow to write a great article\n\nManual of Style\n\nI hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian! Please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes (~~~~); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you need help, check out Wikipedia:Questions, ask me on my talk page, or place {{helpme}} on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Again, welcome! Sjakkalle (Check!)\n\nHei! Welcome to Wikipedia. And welcome to Wikipedia:WikiProject Norway; we can use all the help we can get.\n\nJust made a very minor edit to the excellent article you contributed, Vildanden (airline). Overall an extremely nice bit of work (and especially exceptional for a new contributor). The last sentence of Vildanden puzzles me though; could you perhaps confirm it is correct as written?\n\nTusen takk - Williamborg\n\nThanks. What I meant anyway is that the aircraft has www.vildanden.no on the side and the duck logo on the tailplane. Fixed up the sentence a litte. Hope its ok now, if not, be bold. Otherwise I will be trying to go through all the norwegian airport and airline articles and upgrading them, and the odd local bit on Trøndersk stuff Arsenikk\n\nYour current edit reads very well now! Appreciate your taking the time to make it clear. I look forward to seeing more of your work. Williamborg\n\nThe Military history WikiProject coordinator election has begun. We will select seven coordinators to serve for the next six months from a pool of eleven candidates. Please vote here by August 26!\n\nThis is an automated delivery by grafikbot -\n\nThe August 2006 issue of the Military history WikiProject newsletter has been published. You may read the newsletter, change the format in which future issues will be delivered to you, or unsubscribe from this notification by following the link. Thank you.\n\nThis is an automated delivery by grafikbot --\n\nThanks for uploading Image:Alcoa logo.gif. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an image tag applied to the image description page indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.\n\nFor more information on using images, see the following pages:\n\nWikipedia:Image use policy\n\nWikipedia:Image copyright tags\n\nThis is an automated notice by OrphanBot. If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions. 20:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nNice to see another Norwegian join the Wikipedia. Good to have someone who understands Norwegian topics well.\n\nI modified your Trøndelag edit, citing what I thought the relevant Wikipolicy (see discussion page for Trøndelag). If you've got an alternate policy to cite, let's talk; we need to get it straightened out (i.e., get the policy requirements consistent). Skål - Williamborg (Bill)\n\nOn 14 September, 2006, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article Coop NKL, which you created. If you know of another interesting fact from a recently created article, then please suggest it on the \"Did you know?\" talk page.\n\nCongratulations! Keep up the good work! --Srikeit (Talk | Email)\n\nHi. I see you recently created Iran Air destinations. Did you know there was also Iran Air Destinations? (I think your spelling is better.) Do you have a view what is best to do about this? (I won't be editing either - I just noticed Qeshm was linked to by both, and thought that odd.) 195.128.251.215\n\nThe Original Barnstar For your hard work and dedication to improving Wikipedia, I, Sharkface217, hereby award you this Original Barnstar. Good job! Sharkface217\n\nI noticed you've been adding the infobox to a bunch of airlines. There are quite a few to do, so any contributions in that area are great. However, there have been a couple discussions on putting flags next to city names and the decision was to leave them out, so please just put the city (and country) name in the infobox, but not the flags. Thanks. DB (talk)\n\nHi there. First of all, thank you for improving the article. It's in much better shape. I was going over some of the citaions you've provided, and I'm concerned about their credibility. Wikipedia can only use sources as described by WP:RS. Sites like UrbanRail.net should generally be avoided because they're self published. Thanks! -- Selmo (talk)\n\nBTW, if you're interested, feel free to join WikiProject Rapid transit.\n\nOn December 7, 2006, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article History of Rapid transit, which you created. If you know of another interesting fact from a recently created article, then please suggest it on the \"Did you know?\" talk page.\n\nThankyou Arsenikk for helping to give transportation content representation on DYK! Happy editing, Blnguyen (bananabucket)\n\nGreetings! While reviewing the assessment change log for Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports, I noticed that you created the article Berlevåg Airport. You contribution to improving Wikipedia's collection of airport articles is greatly appreciated. If at all interested, I'd like to extend an invitation to join the project. You can join by simply adding your name to the list of participants. If not interested, please disregard this message. Thanks! thadius856talk|airports|neutrality\n\nOn 9 December, 2006, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article Lysaker Station, which you created. If you know of another interesting fact from a recently created article, then please suggest it on the \"Did you know?\" talk page.\n\n--GeeJo (t)⁄(c) •\n\nOn 14 December, 2006, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article Rjukanbanen, which you created. If you know of another interesting fact from a recently created article, then please suggest it on the \"Did you know?\" talk page.\n\nYomanganitalk\n\nIn case you hadn't noticed, Aeroflot Don destinations has been proposed for deletion.

You may be interested in this AFD debate, and wonder if you have anything to add about it. From what I can see, the justification for the article is dubious, but there may of course be supporting sources which I have failed to find and which would justify a Wikipedia article. I have seen that you frequently have better sources than I do on transportation issues so any contribution to that discussion would be welcome.

I think I will actually AFD Ole Tronstad. WP:AFDP says \"Municipal politicians: Municipal politicians are not inherently notable just for being in politics, but neither are they inherently non-notable just because they're in local politics — evaluate each case on its own individual merits. Mayors of major cities have usually survived AFD, although the article should say more than just \"Jane Doe is the mayor of Cityville\". Mayors of smaller towns, however, are generally deemed not notable just for being mayors, although they may be notable for other reasons in addition to their mayoralty\". I unfortunately believe Tronstad fails. The similar case could be made for the mayors of Hemnes, Hattfjelldal etc although they are more borderline. Punkmorten\n\nConcerning Ole Tronstad I would claim that he is on the right side of the border because of his length of term and involvement in other aspects of politics, but I have understanding if you disagree. Concerning the mayors of Hemnes and Hattfjelldal though, their notability is not related to their position as Mayor of their respective hamlets par cet, but for being involved in the Terra Securities scandal. Because of the massive, excessive and prolonged intensity of this case in the media, the four \"Nordland-mayors\" have all became notable through this case. Per this mid-week there were more than 7,000 media articles related to the case published, and a significant number of them refer to these mayors. Arsenikk\n\nWhich other aspects? But yeah I will probably leave the \"Terra mayors\" alone. Hope this won't be a big setback for your productivity here :) Punkmorten\n\nOn 4 December, 2007, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article Terra Securities scandal, which you created or substantially expanded.

I see you've removed my addition of \"AS\" from the opening line for the Vitusapotek article; the article title \"Vitusapotek\" is correct, and should not change, but I always understood that the full name (of \"Vitusapotek AS\" in this case) should be included in the title sentence in bold (see Wikipedia:NC-CORP, 4th paragraph). The rest of the article then reverts to the common name, Vitusapotek. Examples are Royal Bank of Scotland and Wal-Mart.\n\nWhat do you think? Carbonix (talk)\n\nHi. I agree with you on your interpretation of the rules. The reason I did this was that as I see it that while the article Norsk Medisinaldepot is about the company, the article Vitusapotek is about the chain, and not about the company. And since 2007 Norsk Medisinaldept, NMD Grossisthandel and Vitusapotek have been merged into one legal entity. As such I have also added 'AS' to Norsk Medisinaldepot's heading, but removed it from Vitusapotek. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nRight. I can see what you mean and eventually found the 'merging' you refer to; I was relying too heavily on the company's website and even their contact address, which still use AS!

Nastykermit (talk) —Preceding comment was added at\n\nThere are a number of critical errors to the comment added about Halvorsen. First, the election was in 2005, not in 2006. Second, there are used a number of wiesel words that should be avoided in Wikipedia. But the most critical part, and the reason for me reverting your edit was that the last sentence, \"and this is today seen as one of the biggest lies and broken promises made a Norwegian politician.\" cannot under any way be seed as encyclopedic. The problem lays in that the claim cannot be verifiable for the population as a whole. And even if some people feel this way, it would be incorrect to generalize about the topic as such. Further, you should be careful (even if it is difficult sometimes) when writing about living people, even if they are politicians. This whole claim should be verified through independent third-party sources. Don't be surprised if it is removed if this claim cannot be verified. Thanks for contributing to Wikipedia; remember to be bold. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nYou cant have one without the other.

You should also know that I like, and spend some time watching your contributions list. I like to read your great contributions to Norwegian related articles. Rettetast (talk)\n\nAnd your recent 19th-century bios inspired me to create a slew of notables from the Skien and Porsgrunn area. Good sources are lying around, fortunately. Most of them were related in some way, through intricate marriages. Punkmorten (talk)\n\nHaha, just like my hometown—where everyone is everyones second cousin. Good work on these ancient people, and amazing good references you have found. Personally I was just removing red links on Bergensbanen with some library books. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nHello there!\n\nOn the page Metro-Airport (VTA), you removed Category:Airport rail links and added Category:Railway stations serving airports in the United Kingdom.\n\nI've reverted this change as this light rail station is located in the United States, not the United Kingdom. If you've made similar changes to other articles, you may want to check them to ensure that those changes are acurate.\n\nTake care.\n\n--Brianvdb (talk)\n\nThanks; I was having some problems with HotCat, and went through an extra time to double check all the UK/US articles, but I guess one just slipped through. Thanks for fixing it up and letting me know :) Arsenikk (talk)\n\nI've categorized the Mountain View - Winchester (VTA) article as Category:Airport rail links and the station serving the airport in Category:Railway stations serving airports in the United States. Hope that is to your approval. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nLooks great. Thanks! --Brianvdb (talk)\n\nHello!\n\nI found your name on the list of WP:WikiProject Trains participants where I also noticed you're from Norway. I thought you'd maybe be interested in taking a look at something that I think someone like you could fix easily.\n\nŠkabo is an article about a Serbian rapper. One of the redirects to this article is Skabo which seems to be a short version of Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and I'm led to believe that this was a Norwegian manufacturer of trains. There seem to be a few articles that link to Skabo but they are then incorrectly redirected to the article about the Serbian rapper.\n\nI took an educated guess that you might be one of the better qualified people on here to write at least a stub on Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk so that train articles that contain a link to Skabo are not redirected to Škabo. I would have done it myself but a Google search on Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk brings up almost exclusively Norwegian articles so I really can't come up with any verifiable material.\n\nLet me know if this is something you might be able to do or if, maybe, I should bring it up to the WPTrains community in general.\n\nPeace! SWik78 (talk • contribs)\n\nThanks for the note. Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk is on my mental list of articles to write \"some day\"; at present it is not near the top, partially due to lack of good sources. Since I am responsible for most of these links myself, what should be done is that Skabo becomes a disambiguation page and that links to Škabo and Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, and that I try to get better at not linking directly to Skabo. I can not promise to get around to this immediately, but I can look into it soon. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nThat sounds like a workable solution. I was hoping to avoid a disambiguation page with a red-linked entry but I guess, acording to WP:MOSDAB, there's no harm in it until we gather up enough material for a stub.\n\nThanks for responding.\n\nPeace! SWik78 (talk • contribs)\n\nThere seems to be an article on the Norwegian Wikipedia (with references), so translation should be imminent. I will do some dabbing, and get around to it soon. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nI have fixed the incoming links to Skabo. Rettetast (talk)\n\nThanks Rettetast. I've written the article now; it has about as many lines with reference as content.

Manxruler (talk)\n\nThank you as well. I enjoy the fact that you use good referencing in your articles, and user boxes, those are always good to have. Keep filling in those gaps and continued good luck with the editing to you too. Manxruler (talk)\n\nHi, when you add categories to articles, as with Travel, please make sure that the article is not already in the category via a parent. In the case of Travel, that article is in Category:Travel, which is itself a member of Category:Transportation, so it is not necessary (or desirable) to add the article directly to Category:Transportation. Happy editing! --MCB (talk)\n\nThey seem to be to be more general than trucks. Trailers hooked to cars have them, for example. So please think more widely when you remove a category. I believe you are mistaken in your categorisation. Fiddle Faddle (talk)\n\nThanks for the feedback. I am attempting to clean up Category:Transportation that was a mess, and remove all topics not in the core to subcategories. I appreciate your concerns, and I will look a little harder for a good category for this; I hope you understand I do not consider it a central topic in transport, even if it is used between modes. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nOddly not central, but strangely universal. A paradox. Fiddle Faddle (talk)\n\nNot that I've looked, but is there a cat \"Transportation Equipment\"? That might suit better. I see where you're headed. A drawbar is also used in aviation, to link the tug to the nosewheel for pushing back. They get everywhere! Fiddle Faddle (talk)\n\nThanks for the review, but I'd like to counter some of your points which don't quite make sense: 1a) Infoboxes are not mandatory, and in this case, there would be very little information to add to one (making it pointless adding one...) 2a) Ref 1 is fixed, and ref 9 has no title because it is the same book as ref 4. You obviously don't understand how citing books works. See WP:CITE. 3a) There is little information in the article because the information simply doesn't exist. If you had read the article, you would have found that: \"Little is known about the company's designs.\" As you can see, I used a wide range of books for the research, but indeed found little information. — Wackymacs (talk ~ edits)\n\nOn 15 June, 2008, Did you know? was updated with a fact from the article Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, which you created or substantially expanded.

Did you realise your latest DYK, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, isn't listed at Wikipedia:Recent additions? Strange. Manxruler (talk)\n\nThanks for letting me know. I have asked the good man who administrated the DYK look into the matter. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nThanks for the heads up. Another admin left a note to say he didn't have time to do the credits but I didn't realize he hadn't updated the archive either. Problem is now fixed. Gatoclass (talk)\n\nHi. I saw that you removed Personal Rapid Transit from the Transport category, and added it to the Rail category, which wasn't quite correct. I presume this is because you are trying to rationalize the Transport category, and PRT isn't really appropriate as a top-level category? If that's the case, then I agree, but it does need to be categorized in the hierarchy somewhere. To that end, I've created a new category, Automated Guideway Transport, which includes PRT, Dual-Mode, and Automated People Movers. I'm taking my queues from the American Public Transportation Association, which classifies all of these modes under the AGT label, and in turn seems worthy of top-level inclusion in the Transport category. What do you think? Skybum (talk)\n\nGood idea. To be quite honest I know very litle about PRT, so I was a little confused as to the categorization. The general rule seems to be that if it considered a mode of transport, it can go in Category:Transportation; if it is not a separate mode it goes under the modes respective category.\n\nThere does seem to be a category called Category:Alternatives to conventional railways with the description \"The articles in this category describe transportation technologies that are like railways in that vehicles move along fixed structures that guide their movements (and typically restrict it to either backwards or forwards), but which differ from conventional railways in that the vehicles do not rest on steel wheels that roll along two parallel rails. Both existing and hypothetical technologies belong here.\" I would claim that this would be the proper category to stick PRT and similar into. Concerning rail transport as a mode, it is related to the guiding, rather than use of actual tracks. Unfortunately the mode has a somewhat misleading name for this understanding.\n\nMy final concern is the categorizationcapitalization of the category; only proper nouns are to be categorizedcapitalized using only capital letters, see WP:TITLE#Lowercase second and subsequent words in titles. The link you provided is filled with capitalization errors, in case you wondered. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nOkay, I'll definitely fix the capitalization errors, and thanks for pointing that out. It seems to me, based on what you're saying, that PRT should indeed be included in the root transportation category, as it is a distinctive mode of transit that is almost entirely unlike rail. It does use guideways that superficially resemble rails, but this is no more indicative of its functionality than the fact that cars, buses, and trains all use wheels. Unlike trains -- or any other \"alternatives to trains\" -- PRT does not do fixed-route, fixed-schedule, line-haul operations. Rather, it uses small vehicles that are available on demand, which can self-navigate through an ad-hoc mesh network -- much more like cars on roads than trains on rails. Functionally, the closest to PRT would be taxis, rather than trains. Since PRT, by definition, can never use large vehicles, human drivers, scheduled service, or line-haul configurations, I don't feel that it is appropriate to categorize it with other systems that generally have all of these features.\n\n(If you're having some difficulty picturing how PRT works, based on my description, check out this 3.5-minute promotional video from PRT vendor, which illustrates the technology fairly well.)\n\nThe only potential problem with including PRT as a top-level transit category -- and the reason I thought that you'd removed it -- is that is currently exceedingly rare, and hence potentially not notable enough for top-level categorization. Although a number of prototype systems have been built over the years, there is only one quasi-PRT system currently in public use, another full-PRT system under construction, and several more in the late planning stage. If you don't think that rarity is a disqualifier, then let's put it as a top-level category. If it is a disqualifier, then automated guideway transport definitely seems like the place to put it. Even though the network structures and service capabilities of AGT and PRT bear no similarity to each other, at least it would then be lumped in with other transit systems that are always fully-automated, and generally use much smaller vehicles than rail systems (although not as small as PRT). Skybum (talk)\n\nThanks for a good video :) From what I could see, it is structurally such as maglev: \"like railways in that vehicles move along fixed structures that guide their movements\" (note: guide, not dictate). I fear that if PRT was included in Transportation, a lot of other stuff would have to; not that I as such have anything against many top-category articles. To compare: a bus, automobile and an electric forklift all belong to the same mode, since they have wheels on a a (sort of) flat surface, and can control themselves, yet their operation can be of immense difference. My opinion is that PRT belongs in Category:Alternatives to conventional railways, not Category:Transportation. If you feel the former category should go straight into the latter, that might be a correct solution; I do not know. I also notice there is no top level article for the former (preferably with a better name). Arsenikk (talk)\n\nGlad you liked the video! I see your reasoning in regards to the top-level Transportation category, but I still have qualms about including it in Category:Alternatives to conventional railways. Possibly I'm biased; I've been studying PRT for almost a decade, and have come to believe that one of the most striking things about it is how completely unlike a train it is -- so defining it relation to trains just kind of rankles, if you don't mind me saying so. It's almost exactly midway between being an alternative to a train and an alternative to a car. On the other hand, many kind of non-PRT AGT systems absolutely do functions as train alternatives, so the AGT category definitely belongs there, even if PRT does not. So, I don't know -- the problem with category trees is that they imply singular rigid ontological hierarchies on things that actually are very multifaceted, fuzzy, and overlapping. Perhaps the best way to organize the transportation categories would be in several parallel streams: one covering the physical aspect (roads / rails and other guideways / animals / water / wings / et cetera), and another covering the usage (public transport / private transport / Industrial / et cetera)? Just a thought. Skybum (talk)\n\nHi! At the new Minister of the Navy and Postal Affairs (Norway), I made up a system to distinguish between different names of ministries without making new tables for every \"era\" (like it's done on e.g. Minister of Finance (Norway)). It certainly looks cleaner. Do you like it? Punkmorten (talk)\n\nLooks good :) Arsenikk (talk)\n\nI hope you don't mind terribly, but I just moved your article on the ferry named Hydro to SF Hydro in order to conform with English language conventions. Dampferge is after all steam ferry in English. A similar thing was done when DS Donau was moved to SS Donau. Congratulations with MF Storegut, by the way. A lead article with its image on the main page and everything. Great work indeed. :) Manxruler (talk)\n\nI have no idea as to the naming conventions to ships; I presume you are better informed and trust your decision. All I have ever written on ships is the Tinnsjø ferries. Arsenikk (talk)\n\nI presume that DF Ammonia and DF Rjukanfoss should be moved too then? Arsenikk (talk)\n\nI would recommend that, yes. For more on the naming of ships, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships), although that article deals mostly with military ships. Manxruler (talk)\n\nSorry to bother you of all the project members but i`ve a question and i liked the fact that i`ve been here only one day longer than you (And i have no barnstars. Sad)\n\nIn the Spanish wikipedia there is a template that allows long Refferences lists to be put in a text box with scrollbar, really useful, i think.\n\nHere is an example http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\n\nHow can that be added to the tools in the english wikipedia?\n\nI`ll apreciate an answer, wheter on my talk page or here. Thanks Zidane tribal (talk)\n\nHi. I am sorry, but there is no such template on the English Wikipedia. The reason is that Wikipedia:Citing sources states: \"Scrolling lists, for example of references, should never be used because of issues with readability, accessibility, printing, and site mirroring. Additionally, it cannot be guaranteed that such lists will display properly in all web browsers.\" What I recoment instead is using {{reflist|2}} to create a references list over two or three coulombs (depending on the average length of each). This usually reduces the length by a fair amount. I am sorry I gave your the answer you did not want, but I believe it is for the better.

Greatly appreciated, especially from such a redoubtable editor as yourself. Best, Gr1st (talk)\n\nDear Arsenikk,\n\nI read your poisonous message and would like to make it clear to you that I did NOT propose to merge the transport and shipping articles. What I DID propose is to merge shipping INTO transport. Before you say it’s all the same, let me point out to you that there are TWO different templates, one for each case. You may read all about it at Wikipedia:Merging_and_moving_pages.\n\nI did NOT stated any reason for the proposal, because I have more important things to do, like educating young students.\n\nYour happiness is of no concern to me whatsoever, but I already wrote a justification for the merger, as short as I could, just to humor me.\n\nI do not care to discuss my proposal with you or anyone else. Again, I have better things to do. You or anybody else can do with my proposal whatever you see fit.\n\nFear not. You are welcome to remove those two banners or anything else that you feel like, if you believe that by doing so you are providing a service to the Wikipedia readers.\n\nMy further advice to you is that you should NEVER write a message to any registered user invoking rules that do not exist and that you are unable to cite. You statement that a merger proposal has no function without an accompanying discussion is FALSE. Proof?\n\nIt made you write that message to me, wich\n\nmade me write a brief justification, and\n\ncompelled me to give you a piece of my mind, hoping that you’ll learn something from the experience (better now and here, than on the job, believe me!)\n\nFurther evidence?\n\nWhat you find in Wikipedia:Merging_and_moving_pages is After proposing the merger, place your reasons on the talk page. That is not QUITE the same thing as you wrote. Although the editor of that phrase, obviously, left out the word PLEASE, it is clearly assumed that whoever made the proposal is interested in invoking a response and proceed with the merger. Well, I’m NOT. If I was, I would have proceed with it, as explained on the same Wikipedia page. As it is also made plainly clear there, I do NOT need to discuss that with you or anybody else, much less ask for your or anybody else’s permission to do it.\n\nBeing a student of Business Administration, a native speaker of English, having studied logistics and economics, whose main areas of interest on Wikipedia are within transport (including rail transport, aviation, public transport and shipping) it baffles me that you had to ask ME for a reason to merge those two articles. You ought to know that yourself.\n\nFurthermore, you might consider changing that link on your user’s page from shipping to ship transport. Just a thought. Rest assured that my happiness does not depend on you doing it or not.\n\nGood luck in your studies. Take as much advantage of them as you can (one final, unsolicited but also free advice).\n\nBest regards,\n\nVirgilio A. P. Machado\n\nvapmachado talk.cw\n\nThanks for pointing that out, especially since that update had one of my own hooks in it as well!\n\nThe problem is that User:Bedford has not been archiving the previous hooks when he posts an update.
