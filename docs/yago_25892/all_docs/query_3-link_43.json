        "text": "Republisher’s Note: Tonight we face a tense situation in the Santos living room.\n\nOne Night Only by Samj Chapter 13\n\nAll eyes were on the unexpected visitor.\n\n“Carlos!” Bernard exclaimed, rising from the couch and walking over to him. “I didn’t even know you were in Chicago.”\n\n“It’s good to see you baby brother,” Carlos replied, pulling him into a tight embrace. “I’ve left you alone far too long,” he whispered in Bernard’s ear before releasing him and walking into the room.\n\n“Carmen,” he smiled in greeting, “you’re looking well.”\n\n“Carlos,” Carmen returned shortly, her entire body stiffening as he approached. She had never trusted Carlos Sandoval, and her dislike had only grown in the years since she had married Bernard.\n\nYou’re a complication I just don’t need right now, she thought as he kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nBernard was thinking almost identical thoughts as he watched Carlos acknowledge the others in the room. He loved his brother dearly, but Carlos had a need to control every situation, and his words a moment ago had been deliberately chosen to convey that he was looking to control this situation as well. Not this time, Bernard warned silently. I won’t let you interfere with my family.\n\n“So what are you doing in my city Carlos?” Danny asked coldly, with just the faintest hint of a threat in his tone.\n\nMichelle shuddered as she watched Danny – whom she had ceased to recognize as the charming man she had met in the bar – stare daggers at Carlos. I just hope it’s true that mobsters never kill family members, she thought. Because I know what they do to witnesses.\n\nWhile waiting for Carlos to respond, Danny noticed out of the corner of his eye that Michelle had pushed herself into the farthest corner of the couch. She must be terrified, he realized. A part of him wanted to just get her out of there as quickly as possible, yet he couldn’t bring himself to back down from Carlos.\n\n“Your city?” Carlos scoffed. “You’ve got quite a bit of swagger there, Danny.” Looking directly at Michelle he dropped his voice and finished, “You’d better be completely sure you have the power to back it up.”\n\nMichelle’s blood ran cold at the thinly veiled threat, and for the second time that night she wondered if she would live to see the morning.\n\nDanny was worried as well, especially in light of the earlier kidnapping attempt, but he knew better than to show his own fear. “Oh I do,” he assured Carlos with a cocky smile, never breaking eye contact as he rose from his chair and stood toe-to-toe with him. “I do.”\n\n“I’m sure Danny meant no disrespect,” Bernard interjected quickly, trying to maintain the tenuous peace in the room. Both men completely ignored him, knowing that he was simply repeating what was always said in these situations.\n\nNino, Teresa, and Michelle remained silent observers to the “showdown.” Carmen, however, wasn’t about to sit passively and allow Carlos to hold the room captive.\n\n“What are you doing in Chicago, Carlos?” she asked in a weary, almost bored tone. “Because we were in the middle of something and -”\n\n“I know,” he interrupted, giving Danny one last challenging glare before turning his back on him and walking across the room to Carmen. “That’s why I’m here.”\n\nWe don’t want your help, Bernard practically shouted in his own head, frustrated by his brother’s attitude. Knowing he had to be diplomatic, however, he swallowed back those words and instead informed Carlos, “The situation is complicated.” So let us handle it ourselves, he added, hoping Carlos would take the hint.\n\n“It isn’t complicated,” Carlos countered, his conversational tone barely masking a dangerous malice. “You have a problem. I’m going to solve it.”\n\n“What exactly do you think our problem is?” Danny challenged, telegraphing to everyone in the room that he didn’t believe Carlos knew anything useful about the shooting or Michelle’s kidnapping. He didn’t for a moment imagine that Carlos knew any of the details of his deal with Nino.\n\n“Rivera,” Carlos answered simply, while calmly but deliberately pulling a gun from his jacket pocket and aiming it directly at Nino’s head.\n\nA strange sort of controlled chaos reigned throughout the room – Bernard’s man who had been standing behind Nino to “guard” him stepped back and to the left to remove himself from the line of fire, while the rest of the guards in the room drew their guns and stood ready to act.\n\nTeresa, by contrast, immediately sprang from the couch and placed herself into the line of fire, shielding Nino’s body with her own and screeching “No!” repeatedly. At the same time, Nino struggled to push Teresa away, pleading with her to keep herself safe.\n\nBernard couldn’t believe that Carlos would have the audacity to carry out a hit in his home – or any home for that matter – especially in front of a witness. He and Carmen both started moving toward Carlos when they saw that Teresa could be in danger, their shouts of “Wait!” and “Stop!” mingling together.\n\nIn one fluid motion, Danny moved from his chair to the couch to shield Michelle from harm. Somewhere in Michelle’s mind a detached voice suggested that she might be in shock; another firmly declared that this couldn’t possibly be happening. Whether or not she was actually in shock, she barely noticed Danny’s presence; the gun in Carlos’ hand held her full attention.\n\nAs soon as Teresa stepped into his firing path, Carlos bent his arm so that the gun pointed safely at the ceiling. “What are you doing, Teresa?” he asked.\n\n“What are you doing, Carlos?” Bernard asked angrily, fed up with his brother’s actions. Have you completely lost your mind?\n\n“This idiot is a threat to the family,” Carlos replied, using his gun to point at Nino then aiming it at the ceiling once again. “He needs to be eliminated.”\n\n“Nino is family,” Teresa protested, reaching down and giving Nino’s hand a quick squeeze.\n\nNino returned her squeeze with one of his own, then stepped beside her, refusing to act like a coward by hiding behind a woman.\n\n“Teresa?” Carlos prompted, confident that she couldn’t produce a reason to stop him. “You were never squeamish about these things before, sweetheart. Don’t go soft on me now.”\n\n“Nino and I are married,” she declared, holding up her left hand to display a modest diamond engagement ring and a more elaborate wedding band.\n\nAnd just as suddenly as the room had been thrown into chaos, that chaos was replaced by complete silence. Carlos fumed at the idea that Teresa had managed to hide something from him, and searched his brain for a way around the problem. Bernard, meanwhile, tried to digest the shocking revelation – his little girl, married? And to Nino Rivera of all people?\n\nOnce Danny knew that Carlos would not be using his gun, he shifted positions and pulled a trembling Michelle into his arms. “It’s okay, baby,” he whispered in her ear. “Everything’s going to be okay.”\n\nMichelle pulled away and looked at Danny in disbelief. “How the hell can you say that?” she whispered back, an edge of hysteria in her voice. “That man has a gun!”\n\n“I know,” Danny soothed, pulling her close and raining light but firm kisses down the side of her face. “I won’t let anything happen to you.”\n\n“You can’t -” she began to protest.\n\n“I can,” he assured her, once again whispering directly into her ear. “I promise.”\n\nBefore Michelle could protest further, Bernard regained his powers of speech and sputtered angrily at his daughter, “When? How?”\n\n“This morning,” Teresa answered matter-of-factly. “Father Tomas married us in Springfield.”\n\n“Then Father Tomas will just have to annul the marriage,” Bernard concluded, crossing his arms across his chest to signal that the subject was now closed to discussion.\n\n“It’s too late for that,” Teresa declared confidently, staring defiantly…at a point just above her father’s head. Please, please, please don’t make me spell it out.\n\nWell that explains why I couldn’t track you two down all day, Danny smirked. Oh man, I probably oughtta call Ray and let him know that he can call off the manhunt. He couldn’t reach his cell phone without moving Michelle, however, so he chose to wait for a more convenient opportunity.\n\nCarmen saw the look of devastation on Bernard’s face and wondered how she could possibly close the gap developing between her husband and her step-daughter. “Do you love him, Teresa?” she asked seriously, although she thought she knew Teresa well enough that she could answer that already.\n\nTeresa knew that her feelings for Nino weren’t the same as those her father had had for her mother, or even for Carmen. She even knew, somewhere deep inside, that she and Nino were using each other, feeding off each other’s ambition and desire for power. But she also knew that Nino made her feel special, for the first time in her adult life, and that what they had – even though it was different – was real, and was love. “Yes, I do.” Looking her father straight in the eye she repeated, “I love him, Daddy. And isn’t that what’s really important?”\n\nBernard’s anger was so great he couldn’t form words to respond. My only daughter, my only child married to a Rivera! And not just any Rivera. No, she had to marry Nino, the idiot son that no one respects.\n\nDanny decided to take advantage of the momentary lapse to get Michelle out of room before the next set of fireworks. “I’m going to bring Michelle up to the guest room,” he announced. Not waiting for any sort of approval or acknowledgment, he stood up from the couch and helped Michelle do the same.\n\n“Sit,” Carlos barked shortly, not even bothering to disguise his anger. “Our problem hasn’t gone away here. In fact, it’s only gotten worse thanks to Teresa’s impulsiveness.”\n\nMichelle clung to Danny, pleading with him through her body language to defy Carlos and help her escape. Danny, however, knew without a doubt that Carlos was serious, and he wasn’t about to risk Michelle’s safety, or his mother’s for that matter, by taking him on. He needed to reserve his attack for the most important matter – his deal with Nino.\n\n“I’m sorry, baby,” he whispered in her ear as he pulled her back onto the couch. “It won’t be much longer,” he promised.\n\nNino wasn’t sure if he should address Bernard first or Carlos – he knew that both of them were angry enough to kill him with their bare hands without a second thought – but he knew that the best way to protect his wife from this terrible situation was to draw all of the attention to himself.\n\nWith as much respect as he could muster for the man who had quite recently pointed a gun at his head, Nino addressed Carlos. “Mr. Sandoval, I know that you don’t have very much confidence in my abilities, but that really isn’t the issue here.” Slightly unnerved by the complete lack of response, Nino faltered but then clarified, “Business isn’t the issue here. I will be a good husband to Teresa.”\n\n“See Nino, that just shows that how little you really know,” Carlos retorted, gesturing for Teresa and Nino to seat themselves on the couch. “Right now, business is the issue.”\n\nAs Nino and Teresa approached, Michelle practically crawled onto Danny’s lap to make room for them on the couch. Danny shot them both a look of extreme annoyance, while Michelle tried to reassure Teresa with a shaky smile.\n\nCarlos’ gaze, which had followed the pair to the couch, now rested on Danny. “Unless the two are connected,” he mused. “Was this marriage part of the little plan you cooked up with Nino, Danny?”\n\nBernard suddenly took great interest in the conversation. “You knew about this marriage, Daniel?” he asked sharply, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. Had Danny somehow sacrificed his Teresa to this idiot as part of a deal?\n\n“No,” Danny shot back defensively. “I didn’t even know they were seeing each other until I landed in the hospital.”\n\n“We didn’t tell anyone, Daddy,” Teresa verified. “We, um, we knew you would be upset.”\n\n“Upset?” he echoed incredulously. He could feel his pulse pounding in his head, and for a split second he actually thought he might be having a stroke. I wonder if Carmen has my pills in her purse, he thought idly.\n\n“Bernard, please,” Carmen implored, alarmed by his coloring and facial expressions, “you need to calm down. Why don’t you sit….” she suggested.\n\n“I’m fine, dear,” he assured her, kissing her lightly on the temple and leading her back to her chair. “Now, would someone like to tell me what exactly this deal is that we’re all talking about, since I seem to be the only person here who doesn’t already know?”\n\n“Yes Danny,” Carlos taunted, “I think it’s about time you told your mother why you were meeting Nino that morning.”\n\n“You obviously don’t understand how this works, Carlos,” Danny responded through clenched teeth. “I don’t have to get my mother’s approval for my business deals.” Danny waited, hoping that Carlos would back down before things became even more complicated. Don’t do this, Carlos. We have enough problems right now without Mama going ballistic.\n\n“Then why all the secrecy?” Carlos challenged, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. “If you aren’t doing anything wrong, why can’t you tell her about it?”\n\n“I’m still trying to figure out your sudden interest in my business deals,” Danny countered. “The last time I checked, you dealt exclusively in New York.”\n\n“I’m always interested in my family,” Carlos responded. “I’ve given you the opportunity to try to explain’ this to your mother; if you’re too foolish to take it, I’ll tell her myself.”\n\nCarmen, however, wasn’t thinking about whatever deal Danny might have had with Nino. Instead, she kept replaying Danny’s comment about being in the hospital. “You,” she breathed, fixing Carlos with a stony glare, “you shot my Daniel.”\n\n“Carmen,” Bernard interjected, trying once again to keep the peace. It seemed like all he ever did was play diplomat – taking abuse from Mick and Danny for Carmen’s sake, taking grief from Carmen for Carlos’ sake, and the list went on and on. He was tired of it, all of it – all of them – but this was his family, and he wasn’t about to let them destroy each other, or themselves.\n\nCarlos didn’t bother to conceal his anger at the accusation. “Now why in the world would I shoot your precious, Daniel?”\n\n“As a warning,” Carmen argued. “You obviously know what this deal is, and you obviously disapprove, so you shot my son to warn him against it.”\n\nWhat am I, invisible? Nino wondered to himself. Has everyone forgotten that I’m the one who almost died from lack of medical care? He looked over at Danny for some indication of how to proceed.\n\nDanny made it perfectly clear that Nino should keep his mouth shut and let him handle things.\n\n“Give me a break, Carlos,” Danny taunted in return, trying to bait him. “We all watched you almost take out Nino a few minutes ago; now you want us to believe that you weren’t the one who took a shot at him in that warehouse?”\n\n“Forget about Nino,” Carmen snapped, her words practically overlapping Danny’s. “What I want to know is how the hell you could shoot my son?”\n\n“Oh please, Carmen,” Carlos snapped back, “you know I don’t fool around with warnings.’ When someone gets in my way I remove them, period.”\n\n“So why is Nino still with us?” Danny asked sarcastically. “Tony Moreno doesn’t have a reputation for making mistakes.”\n\n“Tony Moreno?” Carmen repeated, her eyes blazing with fury. Tony Moreno was one of the most accomplished hitmen in organized crime, and everyone knew that he worked exclusively for Carlos Sandoval. “You sent Tony Moreno to kill my son?”\n\n“No, I didn’t,” Carlos shouted emphatically. “I would never kill family.”\n\n“But you don’t send warnings,” Danny reminded him, his calm, even tones in sharp contrast to Carlos’ raised ones. “And I had one of Moreno’s bullets lodged inside me, so that must mean you were trying to kill me.”\n\n“I don’t kill family!” Carlos blared. “That bullet was a mistake.”\n\nCarmen’s voice was deceptively quiet, but the look in her eyes made the hairs on the back of Michelle’s neck stand on end. “You’re damn right it was a mistake. No one goes after my sons.”\n\nCarlos has completely lost his mind, Bernard realized with some alarm. He thinks he’s above the Code, and that’s the quickest way to end up dead in this business.\n\nDanny sounded more amused than anything else. “Come on, Mama, I’d like to hear this one; I want Carlos to explain how I ended up in the hospital by mistake.'”\n\nNo, Danny, stop, Michelle pleaded. The more I know, the more danger I’m in.\n\n“Because you played hero, Danny-boy,” Carlos explained, knowing that Danny hated being called that. “I sent Moreno to take care of Nino; I specifically told him not to touch you. But Moreno wanted Nino to know what was about to happen, so he fired a warning.”\n\n“How considerate of him,” Nino sneered, remembering the terror that had coursed through his body when he’d heard that first shot. I will never allow myself to give into fear that way again, he resolved.\n\n“And it saved your miserable life,” Carlos pointed out, struggling to keep his anger and frustration in check. “Apparently Danny-boy’s reaction was to immediately throw you to the ground.”\n\n“Thank you, Danny,” Teresa mouthed over Michelle’s head even as she said a silent prayer of thanksgiving that God had kept Nino safe and brought him back to her.\n\n“But if those were your orders, Moreno didn’t finish the job,” Bernard objected. “And you just let him botch an order? I don’t think so.”\n\n“I already told you, little brother,” Carlos fumed, “I came here to finish that job – I want Rivera dead.”\n\n“Give me one good reason to believe you,” Carmen interjected. She was clutching the arms of the wingback chair so tightly her knuckles were completely white. “Because right now I think you deliberately sent Moreno after my son. You could’ve killed him!”\n\n“I don’t kill family!” Carlos bellowed, fed up with what he considered to be an unjust persecution. This shouldn’t even be about me – Nino’s the problem, and Teresa’s made things that much worse. “But I’m sure as hell not going to apologize for what happened.”\n\n“You’d better be extremely careful Carlos,” Bernard warned, knowing without really deliberating that he would take his wife’s side against his brother if he had to choose. “You’re on dangerous ground.”\n\n“You have no idea where the real danger lies,” Carlos shot back. “I was protecting this family. My family.” Why can’t you see that you fool?\n\n“And a fine job you did,” Danny mocked. “Moreno didn’t kill Nino, he did shoot me; hell, you should just be happy that he didn’t get himself arrested on his way out.”\n\nCarmen, meanwhile, couldn’t believe what she was hearing. He thinks I want an apology? I lost Miguel in a shooting and he thinks I want an apology for the bullet he put in Danny? “I don’t want an apology, Carlos,” she informed him. “I want revenge.” Sighing because she knew the Code made that impossible, she conceded, “But I’ll settle for reparation.”\n\nCarlos laughed at Carmen’s demands, reminding Michelle of the madmen in those old black-and-white serials she occasionally saw on American Movie Classics. “I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Including putting a bullet in Danny, if I thought he would be smart and heed the warning.”\n\n“Why?” Bernard pushed, confused by his brother’s cryptic references to the deal between Danny and Nino and galled by his attitude – he wasn’t going to be treated like an underling in his own home.\n\nWithout warning, the dam burst and Carlos roared, “Because I didn’t kill Miguel Santos just to watch his son hand over our territory to an idiot outsider like Nino Rivera!”\n\nFor the second time since Carlos arrived, the room fell absolutely silent. This time, however, the silence lasted a mere matter of seconds.\n\nBernard reacted first, without really comprehending anything he had just heard. All he knew was that the situation had turned dangerous, and that he had to take steps to control it as much as possible, and so he barked orders to the men who stood guard throughout the room.\n\nAt first, Danny couldn’t hear anything above the rush of wind in his ears, but then Carlos’ words repeated over and over, their volume increasing until he thought his head might explode.\n\nMichelle felt Danny’s entire body tense, but she didn’t have a clue how to help him. Did he just say he killed Danny’s father? she asked herself, unable to believe what was unfolding right in front of her. What the hell do I do now?\n\nDanny was asking himself the same question when a bizarre feeling of peace overtook him. You’ve been trained to deal with this situation, he realized, his mother’s lessons drowning out Carlos’ declaration. You know what you have to do.\n\nHis body seemed to move of its own accord, and he felt powerless to stop it. No, he corrected himself, I don’t want to stop.\n\nA steady stream of Spanish curses fell from Danny’s mouth as he lifted Michelle off his lap and unceremoniously dropped her down on the cushion next to Teresa. He leapt off the couch and reached into the breast pocket of his jacket, but his progress was halted when Nino grabbed him from behind and held his arms pinned to his chest.\n\n“Even you’re not this stupid, Nino,” Danny growled menacingly, struggling violently against the restraint. “I won’t think twice about hurting you to get to him.” Looking straight at Carlos he shouted, “I’m gonna rip him apart with my bare hands!”\n\n“And I’ll help you,” Nino offered, giving Carlos a look that conveyed his own desire to do him bodily harm while also tightening his grip on Danny. “But you know that it can’t be this way – not here, and not now.”\n\nTeresa held her breath, knowing that Danny was completely serious in his threats – his reputation for being “passionate” in his arguments was more than well-earned. Somehow, though, she couldn’t help but feel proud of Nino for stepping in the way he had, for taking the initiative in a way that would show her father his potential value to the family.\n\nDanny’s anger warred with the instincts that years of training and experience had created. In the end his instincts won out, and he admitted to himself that Nino was right – shooting Carlos in the middle of Bernard’s study would cause more problems than it would solve.\n\n“Now stop fighting me before you rip out your stitches,” Nino instructed, half-joking and half-serious.\n\nDanny panted like a man who had just finished a marathon, but eventually he brought his breathing back under control. When he finally stilled, Nino released him and returned to his place on the couch beside Teresa, but not before the two men shared a look of camaraderie that encouraged Teresa even more.\n\nDanny continued to stand in front of the couch, arms crossed in front of him, the coffee table the only barrier between him and Carlos.\n\nCarmen had yet to say a single word, to make a single sound. Immediately following Miguel’s death, Carmen had spent months plotting her revenge, constructing elaborate fantasies of how she would make his murderer pay. If Carlos had been presented to her then, she would’ve reacted exactly the same way that Danny was reacting. More than a decade later, however, she had learned that controlling her emotions – especially her anger – was essential to survival in “the life”; this would certainly be the greatest test of her abilities.\n\nThe nod of reassurance she gave Danny was almost regal in its simplicity, and her voice sounded no different than it had before Carlos’ arrival as she stated, “I want to hear this. I need to know.”\n\nBernard could only imagine the hell that Carmen was going through at that moment, and his admiration of his wife – the woman who had taken over an entire crime organization in the face of overwhelming opposition – only grew as she remained completely composed while confronting her husband’s murderer. “Go ahead, Carlos,” he instructed, walking behind Carmen’s chair and placing his hands on her shoulders to comfort her. “They say confession is good for the soul…and you’re going to need all the help you can get.”\n\nCarlos sounded like a newscaster, or a recording for books-on-tape, as he related the details that led up to Miguel Santos’ death in a conversational tone. “The Sandoval operations and the Santos operations needed to be joined – we had contacts in New York and Atlantic City that the other Midwest families could only dream of, and the Santoses had all the money we could possibly need to fully utilize those contacts.”\n\nDanny wanted to scream at Carlos, but he fought the impulse out of respect for his mother. Papa would’ve given you the money; hell, he would’ve handed over parts of the business if he could’ve stayed with us. He loved us!\n\nBernard recalled the dozens of intense arguments he’d had with Carlos on that very subject. At the time he’d merely been annoyed by his brother’s attempts to dictate how he should run his portion of the business; only now did he realize the extent of his brother’s obsession. It’s my fault, he lamented. I should’ve seen, I should’ve known.\n\nAfter years of experience, Carmen knew exactly what Bernard was thinking. She squeezed his hand firmly, communicating that she didn’t blame him for anything he might’ve done differently.\n\n“But Miguel and Bernard didn’t want to merge the families – they were afraid it would ruin their all-important friendship,'” Carlos mimicked.\n\nNino and Teresa could tell by his inflection that Carlos didn’t understand the very concept of “friendship.” Bernard, on the other hand, understood it all too well – he and Miguel had been there for each other through every triumph and every crisis, whether personal or “professional.” Miguel had always been more like a brother to Bernard than a friend, and that feeling was intensified a hundred fold as Bernard realized that his own brother viciously killed Miguel.\n\nCarlos’ voice dripped with contempt. “Even with the success of Sancorp, that ridiculous experiment’ in the legitimate business world, they refused to merge the other operations.”\n\nCarmen smiled softly to herself at the memory of how proud Miguel had been when he and Bernard had closed their first big deal as “legitimate” businessmen. Miguel had taken her to New York for the weekend to make up for all of his long hours at Sancorp, and they’d had a truly glorious time – from what she could remember, they didn’t leave their hotel suite once during their stay. She was almost certain that their love had created their only daughter, Pilar, on that trip. After Pilar’s birth she’d wanted at least one more child, maybe another girl, but then….\n\nBut then Carlos took Miguel away from me, Carmen finished bitterly, turning her attention back to the ongoing narration.\n\nCarlos showed absolutely no remorse. “When Natalia died, it all became clear. I knew that Bernard would do anything for his dear friend Miguel – including marrying his widow.”\n\nCarmen immediately flashed back to Miguel’s last moments, gasping for breath as she held him in her arms, his blood flowing freely from the multiple bullet wounds that had riddled his body. “So you made me a widow,” she choked out, her eyes filling with tears before turning cold and steely with resolve. “Perhaps I ought to return the gesture.”\n\n“Please, Carmen, you’re much too intelligent to make such a rash statement,” Carlos chided. “Besides, there was nothing personal in what I did – it was just business.”\n\nBernard had heard more than enough. “You arrogant SOB,” he growled indignantly. “You have a lot of nerve coming into my home and celebrating the destruction you’ve caused in my life, as well as the lives of the people I love – all the while thinking that the Code you’ve trampled all over will continue to protect you.”\n\n“Oh, but it will, baby brother,” Carlos returned smugly, smiling like the proverbial cat with the canary. “There’s one unforgivable sin in this business, and that’s taking the life of a family member.” Glancing briefly at Nino and Teresa he added, “Thanks to my niece, even Nino’s family – for the time being at least. And when we correct that little error in judgment, he’s dead anyway.”\n\nMichelle curled up into a ball, wishing that she could somehow blend into the couch and become invisible. I’m the only person here who isn’t family, she panicked, her imagination conjuring images of her parents grieving in front of her casket during her funeral.\n\nDanny thought about Nino’s reminder that he had to handle this delicately, and his offer to help with that; maybe Nino would be a useful addition to the family after all. “Every law has its loophole, Carlos,” Danny warned in an almost business-like tone. “Hasn’t that always been your motto?”\n\n“Not this law, Danny-boy,” Carlos corrected. “There isn’t a person in this room who can touch me.” His eyes moving across the couch from Teresa to Michelle he amended, “Or there won’t be as soon as . . . .”\n\nHe didn’t need to finish his sentence for everyone in the room to understand his intentions.\n\nAnd then it happened –\n\nThey moved with lightning speed, their actions simultaneous, each man a mirror image of the other as he pulled a gun from his inside jacket pocket and aimed it – Carlos at Michelle’s head, and Danny at Carlos’.\n\nUnlike the earlier confrontation between Carlos and Nino, this time there was no discussion, no protest, no last-minute reprieve. . . . There was only the sound of a single gunshot.\n\nMon., April 2, 2001 – At the Bauers: Michelle comes in and Danny asks where she had been. He is nervous. She tells him that she went to Infierno to see Tony. Danny demanded to know what Tony said. Rick walks in interrupting their conversation. Rick is exhausted from working multiple shifts and seems like he is falling asleep on his feet. Michelle commiserates with him and sends him up to bed. Once Rick heads upstairs, Danny again insists on knowing about Tony. She told him that Tony didn’t say much but that she did most of the talking. She tells Danny what she told Tony and that he was stressed out. She asks Danny what May and her boss said at the meeting and calls him out on not telling her before. Danny tells her that there is a contract out on him and Carlos, Tony and Abuela are the ones behind it. Michelle can’t believe that even with all she’s done that Abuela would actually take Danny’s life. Danny tells her about finding out Ray knew as well, but couldn’t tell him because Tony told him in confession. Danny doesn’t understand why Abuela would do this. He has always been taught blood is blood. Danny: “You know I was always told the Family first. La Famalia es sagrada. What a lie!” Danny wants to call Abuela, he doesn’t believe she can do go through with it if she has to look in his face. Tony shows up at the Bauer’s house and peeks in the window. He sees the two men in the woods with guns and then looks over to Danny and Michelle right inside the windows. He says something about the family being sacred and runs inside. He tries to get Danny out of the view of the hit men and tells Danny that someone is there to kill him. Danny tells him he knows and he is looking at that person. He grabs Tony and pushes him against the wall. Tony tells him that there are men in the woods with guns there to take him out. He tells him that he is there to warn him. He says they wanted him in on it but he couldn’t do it, he would never make Michelle a widow. Tony tells him that the men have high-powered rifles but he thinks they can get out. Danny lets Tony go and closes all the blinds and shuts off the lights. Tony tells him to leave with him now; he knows they can get away. Danny refuses to leave his wife and child. Tony tells him they won’t be hurt, Carlos said so. Danny doesn’t trust Carlos. Tony begs Danny to trust him then and get out. Just then Abuela comes in walking, without her wheelchair. Tony is confused and asks where her wheelchair is. Abuela tells him that the role of the old grandmother in the wheelchair served her well but she was in a hurry and had to do what she had to do. Danny tells her that he knows she wants him dead and wants her to say it to his face. She tells him the time for words is over and she pulls a gun on him.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93l3zJfvbA\n\nTues., April 3, 2001 – At the Bauers: Danny is still confronting Maria, who is holding him at gunpoint. He tells her she looks very much like his grandmother but she isn’t related to him. He tells her that he used to trust her but now she and her buddy Carlos have been trying to turn Tony against him. Maria tells him that she tries to reason with the other families but Danny wouldn’t listen and insisted that he was leaving so the hit was inevitable and out of her hands. She tells Danny he should trust her now. He tells her that at one time he would have done whatever she said but there is no way he is going to trust her now. Maria asks him if he wants things to end like this, wasting his life. She turns to Michelle and tells her that now that she is a mother and a wife she will appreciate the loss that much more. She tells Michelle that she has lost her sons and lost her grandson to her. Maria tells Michelle that she won and now she will feel true loss. Maria tells Danny to enjoy what little time he has left and she leaves. She looks over at the hitmen hiding in the bushes. Danny sends Michelle, Tony and Robert to the basement telling them that he will stay in the kitchen with Tony’s gun. Before they can leave the hitmen break in and a shot rings out. Danny yells out for Tony from behind the cabinets. One of the hitmen was hit. Danny runs out and grabs Tony and they try to get out. Then Danny is shot and Michelle runs to help him. She gets him on the couch just as Rick comes down. Rick tries to help him and asks Tony to call 911 but Danny tells him not to. Tony tells him the guys are still out there and they have to get Danny away. Rick puts Danny’s jacket on and starts to head out to buy them a little time. Rick tells Tony to go with him and that they should run for the car. Rick: “Tony, you’ve got to find a way to get us to the car. That’s the plan.” Rick: “What’s the plan?” Tony: “We run like hell.” Rick: “We run like hell, that’s got technical merit.” They run out and there are a lot of shots fired. Inside, Danny tells Michelle to get away from the window. Rick and Tony make it to the car but the hitmen are following them.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ngAHFRnjc\n\nMy Comments: I wish this copy was crisper, but both copies on YouTube I’ve found look about like this. It’s one of the most awesome Manny sequences anyway. This is really the worse bit of Maria Santos. That she could not only condone the assassination of her grandson, but laugh and chortle over it. This whole reveal does even more damage to the throughline of the Maria character. If they had just let it be that she was willing to sacrifice Danny to save her own skin, while having made some special effort to protect Robbie and insure the family line continued that would be one thing, but this actual enjoyment over the power play is sickening. Frankly they just should have made her another character, a great-aunt or something, or even Fredrico’s wife since she was considerably younger than the first Maria anyway. They could have played out so much better. As it is it’s just sickening. Even when she makes her excuses don’t track. This is one of the Coke machine rocking stops as Danny slowly and against his will is finally convinced that the only way out is to destroy the family he was raised with.\n\nHowever, the play out of the Tony-Danny relationship is important as they come to terms with Tony’s temptation and ultimately Tony indeed having his back. Tony’s line about the kitchen doesn’t make any sense. They are still in the kitchen and the shooters are still out there. When Danny does indeed decide to trust Tony I love how he just immediately takes care of the situation shutting the blinds and shutting down the lights. Such a Mike Bauer moment. Sigh! Why couldn’t there relationship play out on screen? It would have been fascinating. I love that Danny is smart enough not to trust Carlos, but Tony still is foolish enough to think he has everything under control.\n\nThis is also one of my all time favorite Nancy as Michelle scenes. She looks awesome! And just an aside I love how consistent they were at playing Manny as parents who actually actively took care of their kids. Note the baby monitor on the island counter.\n\nThis was a great timing choice to free Maria of the wheelchair, but they really don’t play the shot for dramatic effect. It’s too rushed. The term of affection Maria uses with Danny is one that she’s often used before referring to Danny to his face, Mijo which is a Spanish contraction for mi hijo or my son, it’s frequently used as a term of affection within Hispanic families.\n\nDanny’s power speech confronting Maria is amazing one of the best strong Danny scenes. It’s also a great couple scene although at this point Michelle lets Danny take the lead totally in dealing with his family she stands strongly with him, supporting him and touching him.\n\nI really don’t know though why nobody thinks they should maybe wake Rick up and get him out of the house as there are people attacking the house. Also as many times as men with guns have come to the Bauer House you’d think they’d have so sort of system or security set up. And the rest of the times were all pre-Santos.\n\nAlthough Danny really sells being serious with the gun, these must be the world’s worst hitmen. I love how Tony does what Rick says, but Danny continues to take charge. To be fair Rick does pick up on what’s going on very quickly and this kind of crazy plan is exactly what he’d do if put into a similar situation with Phillip. I love Rick pretending to be Danny, I can’t believe they didn’t clip more of it.\n\nFriday, August 4, 2000 – Claire tries to evade the accusation when Rick guesses that she arranged for Abigail to find them in bed last night. Rick: “I did not invite you into my bed, Claire. I couldn’t consume THAT much alcohol.” When Michelle hears them argue, she forces Claire to confess to what she did. Claire: “You and Rick and everyone I love can trust that I will do what has to be done to take care of them.” Michelle: “That is a terrifying thought.” Rick assures his sister that she doesn’t have to order Claire out of her life. Harley is there to help comfort Rick. Carlos Sandoval reveals to Danny that he has found the person who killed Carmen. Carlos: “You’re wife’s mother, that’s who you got? You think your wife’s mother killed one of the biggest crime bosses around? But I’m the enemy, what do I know, right?” Suspicious, Danny asks him to bring Xeno Martin to him so he can question the guy himself.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkVzgyFDTtM (Part 1)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YstmO6bcMQw (Part 2)\n\nManny Highlight version:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Eb_o2i2Fyo\n\nStory picks up after Parts 1 and 2 above:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6hU47VLI3I\n\nMon., August 7, 2000 – Danny met with Xeno Martin. He talked to him and told him he seemed like small potatoes. Xeno bragged about how he brought down a major player in the mob. Danny asked for more information. The guy bragged but never gave any names. The bartender called up to Danny calling out, “Santos.” Xeno got nervous and asked Danny what he said. Danny said he forgot to introduce himself. He introduced himself as Danny Santos and apologized for not telling him sooner but said that he had been having a rough time lately since someone killed his mother but told Xeno he may have already known that and asked him, “did you?” Danny plays cat and mouse with the Xeno. Danny: “I haven’t really made a decision to what course of action I’m gonna take, but when I do, you’ll be the first to know.” Xeno: “You won’t be sorry, I’ll do a good job. Believe me – I’m your man.” Danny: “I think you just might be.”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXzW1yblMJo\n\nTues., August 8, 2000 – Reva and Josh get it a horrible divorce fight at Millennium. Danny tells Carlos he didn’t expect him back so soon. Carlos reports that Xeno is staying in a luxury hotel suite paid with a stolen credit card. Carlos says that Xeno is a nobody who likes to brag and that he hit Carmen so he could have a reputation in Chicago. But he had to come back to Springfield because he is a freelancer, not a team player. Carlos says no one will be upset if Danny takes him out. Danny will close the club early and lure Xeno in with the promise of a high stakes poker game. Carlos agrees to help and tells Danny their families can work together. Pilar wants to know what happened and Danny tells her he can make things right. Bill come in and tells them he hasn’t found any info on Claire yet. Danny says he knows now who killed Carmen and it wasn’t Claire. He tells Bill to take Pilar out and do not leave her side until he calls. Pilar says he is being pulled back into that life again and she is scared. Bill tells her she needs to get off the family roller coaster; the ride could get a little rough. Bill and Pilar leave. Bill tells Pilar to trust Danny. Danny puts the closed sign up and closes the blinds.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkacSUZ9tvc\n\nWed., August 9, 2000 – At Millennium: Carlos and Xeno are sitting around a table playing cards. Danny appears and tells Xeno he will see more action than he bargained for. Danny tells the other guys to leave; their services are no longer needed. Xeno wants to know what this is about. Danny says it is about his mother. He tells Xeno that he had been looking for his mother’s killer and thinks Xeno can help him. Xeno says he doesn’t know anything and gets ready to leave. His friends in Chicago will take care of him. Danny isn’t impressed and asks him about the last time he was in Springfield. Xeno says a few months ago. Danny says that was when Carmen died. Xeno is so well connected so he should know something. Xeno says he knows nothing. Danny has his goons intimidate him and tells him not to tick him off. Danny wants to know if Xeno heard anyone brag about Carmen’s death. Xeno insists he doesn’t know anything but Danny presses him. Danny says Xeno’s pals in Chicago gave him up. Danny wants Xeno to say he killed her and Xeno finally does. She was going to rat them all out and was a traitor. Danny slaps him and knocks him down. He points a gun at Xeno. Danny tells the thugs to take Xeno in the alley; he doesn’t want blood on the floor. Carlos tells Danny to wait. He will take care of it since the police are watching him. He wants to do it for Danny and Carmen as a gesture of his respect. Danny gives the gun to Carlos and leaves. Carlos watches to make sure he is gone. He tells Xeno he did well. Carlos hands Xeno a briefcase filled with money to leave the country. Carlos tells him not to come back. Xeno really thought that Danny was going to kill him. Carlos was impressed with Danny. He gets on his cell phone to Maria. He tells her it is done and Danny bought it. Maria: “Well done Carlos, now there will be peace.” At the Police Station: Frank and David are discussing Carmen’s case. David wants to find Carmen’s killer. Frank wants the turf war to end and says he wishes Carmen had appointed a successor. David thinks Danny will take over but Frank doesn’t think Danny will risk losing Michelle. David thinks the temptation will be too much for him. Frank wants to go out for a beer and forget about it. At the Bauers: Michelle is in the kitchen when Rick comes in. She is holding a folder containing info about reapplying to med school. Rick wants to know where Danny is. He is teasing her but Michelle is worried about where he is. Rick says for a dead woman Carmen still causes a lot of trouble. Danny comes back. She asks him what is wrong. He says it is over. He found the person who killed Carmen and it wasn’t Claire. She asks if he called the police and he says he took care of it. He tries to leave the room. She asks what he has done.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqq3oqlM-U\n\nThurs., August 10, 2000 – At the Bauers: Michelle wants to know what Danny did with the info about Carmen’s killer. He says he encouraged the guy to tell the truth. Michelle wants to know how he encouraged the guy and where he is now. Danny doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. He says he is tired. Michelle tells him they made promises and he is shutting her out. He tells her she should trust him. Michelle wants to know what “dealt with” means. Danny says that it means they are free and the book on the Santos family business is closed. He can run the club and she can go to med school. They can have children. He is trying to hold her but she pushes him away. She wants to know what he has done and says, “You killed him?” Danny says he killed no one. She says he had someone else do it. They argue. Danny says it was necessary. Michelle says that violence is not an answer. He tells her he needed to insure their life. Danny: “The weak do not inherit the earth, you use force or force gets used on you.” He did it to have a free life with her and their children. Michelle says that he knew how she felt about it but didn’t consider her feelings. The man’s blood is on his hands whether he did it himself or not. Michelle says she doesn’t want to be a victim to retaliation and wants to know when it will end. She loves him but there are some places he goes that she cannot follow. He agrees and says he doesn’t want her to, but insists he will always return to her. She says she cannot be here waiting while there is blood on his hands. Danny says Carmen was his mother. Michelle wanted him to contact the police. Danny wanted to show strength and not weakness. He needed to protect the family. He wants her to accept that he did what he needed to do in order to survive. Danny: “A message was sent when Carmen was hit and he had to respond.” Michelle says she can’t be married to him. She wants him to leave the house tonight. The situation is very tense. Danny walks away and Michelle has tears in her eyes. Later, Michelle is at the table and Rick asks if there is anything he can do. Danny leaves and says Michelle will explain and he will be in touch. Michelle tells Rick not to say anything and starts to cry. It hurts so bad she may die. Rick tries to comfort her. She says that Danny tried to get away but couldn’t. She did the right thing but will never love anyone like she loved Danny. She wants to know how to go on when a part of you has been ripped out. Rick hugs her and says they will find out together. At the Santos House: Pilar and Bill are with Abuela. Pilar wants to know if she has heard from Danny. She is worried. Danny walks in. He says he found Carmen’s killer and that his marriage is over, Michelle’s final decision. Danny tells Abuela he can’t believe it’s over. She asks if he means the search for Carmen’s killer or his marriage. Danny says both. Abuela asks if he is sure and if Carlos took care of it. Danny says yes. He wants to stay there a few days and he goes to settle in. She calls Carlos and tells him he played his role well. Danny is convinced justice has been done. Danny’s wife has left him too. Carlos says that Michelle was the reason Danny didn’t stay in the business. Maria was glad that Danny stayed out of the business while Carmen was alive. Otherwise the same thing would have happened to him that happened with his father. Abuela wants Danny to choose the business on his own. Carlos tells her he will. As Maria hangs up the phone, Danny enters. She says it was Ray on the phone. She is tired and wants to go to bed. She tells Danny she is happy to have him home but sorry about Michelle’s decision. Danny turns off the lights. He looks out the window and Michelle is looking out her window. Rick is holding his wedding ring and looking sad.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3E6jxbRx9A\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R43VwM8hs3E\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkoX_AJUMSs\n\nMy Comments:\n\nHave I mentioned that I really hate this part of the Manny story?\n\nI really appreciate this moment between Danny and Rick. It really shows the slow progression of their relationship from adversarial to family, whether or not Michelle was there. Unfortunately they backslide Rick several times, but this is an important moment between them. It’s also really important because prior to this Danny felt more kinship with Abby, but once Abby leaves Rick, Danny understands his pain and felt empathy for him. Yep, Michelle I used to love Claire, but I don’t trust her, definitely not anymore.\n\nI just love watching Danny doing actual work. This whole bit with Carlos just makes me sick knowing that it was all a lie and Maria was behind it.Actually while it’s true she didn’t I 100% believe that Claire was quite capable of killing Carmen at this point without blinking. I’m actually more surprised she didn’t. It’s big of Rick to tell Michelle not to worry about Claire, but I think he’s still remember the old good Claire & supporting Claire’-Michelle’s relationship too much.\n\nMichelle (already showing some manic signs) will break if he tells her everything and that she doesn’t understand enough to give him advice. Sadly he has no one else to turn to for advice at this time (except Ray) and she was actually right in this instance. Frank might actually have broken Xeno’s story.\n\nI think this is the first mention of gambling at Millennium and Danny being involved in it. It will resurface many times over the years.\n\nI really don’t like this story about what happened to Carmen. While Claire could definitely get herself swept up in something like this, if she truly felt threatened I think she’d have been much more likely to really kill Carmen no matter what she told her she was going to do than to help her fake her death. Claire could be way cold when she had to be and she wasn’t stupid enough to buy this stuff as a good workable long term plan.\n\nEnjoy looking around the Millennium set it will disappear soon after Michelle leaves town. Danny can be very VERY scary when he wants to be.\n\nIf Michelle really believes that Danny did what he thought he had to do to save her, what’s her problem? Really this is just so much manufactured pathos to facilitate Joie leaving."
