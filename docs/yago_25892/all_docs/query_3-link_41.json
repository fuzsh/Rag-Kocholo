Cass Avenue Avenue Argonne, Argonne, IL 60439 Subject: Stop dirty oil shale shale <strong>and</strong> <strong>and</strong> tar s<strong>and</strong>s development in western westem wildl<strong>and</strong>s Dear Bureau ofL<strong>and</strong> of L<strong>and</strong> Management staff, 202-289-1060 <strong>March</strong> <strong>March</strong> <strong>13</strong>, <strong>2008</strong> <strong>2008</strong> 11 <strong>l1</strong>:<strong>25</strong> :<strong>25</strong> <strong>AM</strong> I urge you to protect our public l<strong>and</strong>s l<strong>and</strong>s from from dirty dirty fuels fuels production. Both oil shale shale <strong>and</strong> <strong>and</strong> tar s<strong>and</strong>s development could have massive impacts on on the environment environment <strong>and</strong> local communities communities -- impacts which are are not not fully frrlly assessed in your Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement <strong>and</strong> are not yet yet fully known due due to to t4e the early stage ofresearch of research on the the development ofthese of these resources. Congress Congress wasted taxpayer taxpayer dollars dollars when itset it set arbitrary deadlines for for the creation ofgovernment of govemment documents before the the relevant relevant information was even available. The draft PElS PEIS could determine the the fate ofover of over two million acres acres ofwildlife of wildlife habitat <strong>and</strong> some of of the the best hunting, fishing <strong>and</strong> outdoor recreation areas in Colorado, Wyoming <strong>and</strong> Utah. The proposed industrial development would threaten air air <strong>and</strong> water water quality, qualþ, jeopardize human health <strong>and</strong> local communities <strong>and</strong> increase global warming. We know from tar s<strong>and</strong>s production in Canada that that dirty fuels fi.rels operations destroy vast expanses of wildl<strong>and</strong>s, displace wildlife, create toxic waste waste sites that go on for miles, miles, produce more greenhouse gasses than conventional conventional fuel fuel <strong>and</strong> <strong>and</strong> use enormous enornous amounts ofclean of clean water -- a priceless resource in the arid West. Producing one million barrels ba:rels ofoil of oil shale per day day is expected expected to require the energy equivalent ofroughly of roughly ten ten giant new power power plants plants <strong>and</strong> five five giant gianrnew new coal còal mines, <strong>and</strong> enough water to supply supply up to to 365,000 families of offour four for one entire year. Yet the draft PElS PEIS does not analyze analyze potential impacts on on air <strong>and</strong> water qualþ, quality, global global warming or human health, <strong>and</strong> concluded that dirty fuels should be be the the primary primary use use of ofpublic public l<strong>and</strong> in order to benefit private private companies. Safer <strong>and</strong> more more cost-effective cost-effective solutions solutions are are already available, available, such as energy efficiency efficiency <strong>and</strong> alternative alternative energy energy technologies. technologies. The Bureau Bureau of ofL<strong>and</strong> L<strong>and</strong> Management should not be advancing a plan plan that that would would turn turn millions of ofacres acres of ofwestern westem wildl<strong>and</strong>s into dirty industrial wastel<strong>and</strong>s. Instead I urge urge you to protect protect these sensitive areas for future generations generations <strong>and</strong> shift your your efforts to promoting cleaner cleaner sources of ofenergy. energy.
