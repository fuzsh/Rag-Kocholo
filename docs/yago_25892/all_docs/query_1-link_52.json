        "text": "Recently online soap fandom has been talking a lot about the character of Peter August on General Hospital. You have A LOT of people who really hate the Peter character and want him gone. People keep saying that no redemption is possible. I think they are wrong. I don’t think any character is beyond redemption. Peter was actually on a pretty good long track to redemption story, but then they ruined it by having him yell at his half-brother Nathan’s grave, erasing all the remorse that was step 1 in his redemption story. Without that base it all went downhill from there. Anna going from protective at all costs to he’s evil GET HIM! without a pause in between at “oh my God, we need to get him psych help, he’s not well” didn’t help a jot. (See Note 1) Frankly they’ve written Peter into a corner and he needs to be rested now for awhile. I still don’t think he’s beyond an eventual redemption, but running around with a sudden parseltongue accent and defeating death without explanation left and right has really set him up for us needing him to be off canvas for awhile.\n\nRedemption\n\nRedemption is an important feature of soap operas. From the start soap operas were about relationships (romantic, familial, personal, business), about characters letting each other down, but that they have to eventually seek and hopefully find at least some sort of redemption. In short they need to find and trust in their Guiding Light – hence the name. The most boring thing is an evil character that’s never challenged is and without any humanity. Sure you can write a 100% evil character, but that is going to have to be a very restricted, short term story. It can be done and often is with a short term villain. ToMargo’s Mr. Big story springs to mind. To keep a character around long-term you need them to be tempted to the other side no matter which side they start on.\n\nExamples of Great Redemptions\n\nWhen it comes to redemption I often think of two of Lucinda Walsh’s (As the World Turns) husbands. The first was John Dixon. I loved John, but Dixon had been written very far down in the trash pile around the time I was born. He had martially raped Kim (a fact I didn’t know until I read the history books when it went off the air) and his relationship with Dee ended in a very strange place. He’d even faked his own death. It was John’s relationships with his various children and ward that helped bring him back to the path to redemption and his marriage to Lucinda (a healthy marriage of equals) capped his return.\n\nThe other was James Steinbeck. He’d married Lucinda and with James who in their right mind would think there was even a possibility that it was love? Turns out we were all wrong. How the marriage ended showed love. James and Lucinda had been in a very good place, but when Lucinda was severely injured and showing no effort towards recovery, James was very worried and decided when all his love and support and her family members’ love and support did nothing to help he came up with a plan. He lied to Lucinda and said he’d deliberately caused the incident that caused her injury. (He totally hadn’t.) But he said that he’d hurt her on purpose to keep her out of the way. So she had better stay down and out of his way or else! That made Lucinda SO furious that she fought her way back, just as James had hoped she would. So in all that evil there was a tiny piece of good. (I’m not saying, however, that James’ one true pairing wasn’t with Barbara. As sick and twisted as it was those two were made for each other. But I genuinely think James cared for and respected Lucinda and was willing to sacrifice for her – which is saying a good deal.)\n\nAnother brilliant example is from Guiding Light. Nola Reardon was the villain of the story. My first soap couple was Kelly and Morgan. (See Note 2) There was a long, well-written plot by then headwriter Douglas Marland where Nola tried to break up the couple. I especially remember her arranging for Kelly and Morgan’s presents to each other to show up at a white elephant party. (See Note 3) Her topper though was making Kelly think they’d slept together – which they hadn’t he was just THAT drunk – and getting pregnant by Floyd. So Nola told Kelly the baby was his which broke up Kelly and Morgan and positioned Nola so she thought she could marry Kelly, who was both attractive and a doctor making him potentially rich compared to Nola’s family. I hated Nola SO much during that storyline. But Nola turned it around. She gave up on Kelly, wouldn’t trap Floyd in a loveless marriage, and got a job outside the family boarding house to raise her daughter Stacy as a single mom. She didn’t even go after Floyd again when he went from guy who rented a room in a boarding house to a rock star. Nola was redeemed and moved on to become part of one of the all time great couples, Nola and Quint Chamberlain.\n\nHowever, the poster boy for redemption on a soap opera is that of Michael Baldwin on The Young and the Restless. Baldwin was in such an awful place that I couldn’t watch the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice for years because Firth looked too much like Baldwin. (Seriously, I worked in a library at the time and I’d shelve the videos and even feel a little sick looking at them long enough to do that. Thankfully Baldwin’s redemption allowed me to enjoy the best Pride and Prejudice ever.) He was off canvas for around 4 years serving time in prison and when we did run across him again he donated a kidney to then soap hero Danny Romalotti as a true sacrifice. He earned his redemption both off screen and on to the point that his once victim Cricket Blair was even engaged to him for awhile. He’s been a more or less stand up lawyer and a leading citizen of Geona City for many years. Although he’ll occasionally get dragged into something – mostly trying to cover for someone else’s problems now a days – he is such an outstanding person that his badness attempts usually fail. Michael is part of the Likey pairing, not really a supercouple, after all Lauren already is one with Paul, but a long term, stable couple now both troublemakers have reformed.\n\nManny and Redemption\n\nI had actually polished off this post when I thought – wait, what about Manny? Redemption on soap operas is a big deal with me. That’s the point of me doing this post after all. However, I never thought about Manny in terms of redemption. I never thought of them as NEEDING redemption. They needed to grow up, of course, and face down obstacles, naturally, but I don’t see either of them as doing something bad, a bit illegal – sure, dangerous – you bet, not the best choice – all the time, but not bad. Danny had been raised a gangster. I honest to God believed for one horrible commercial break that it was possible that Danny had indeed killed my Michelle (who I had loved from the time she was a baby) and I don’t even think in that terrible moment that I believed Danny needed to be redeemed. I thought of him as needing to be rescued. He rescued Michelle and she rescued him right back. That was how their dynamic worked. When Danny went wrong after Michelle left him (Joie Lenz leaving) and became the head of the crime family, I still didn’t see him as needing redeemed. He needed rescued. That perception is perhaps mistaken. After all, Danny did have agency. The situations he ended up in were often partly because of choices he’d made. But even when Danny made bad choices, he made them for good reasons. He never did something truly horrible like John, James, Nola, or Michael. (Mileage may vary if you think he did.) Danny never thought that doing something evil was right. About as close as he got was setting up a gambling parlor (which was never used illegally), telling some one it was OK with him if somebody killed the guy who “killed” his mother, giving Tony a well deserved black eye, and keeping the mob fingers in trash pickup when he got the rest of it to leave Springfield. I mean, he isn’t meaning to trap anyone, to steal something from someone, or intentionally hurting someone without a darn good reason. I think it didn’t occur to me to include Manny my first time through because Danny never really needed to be redeemed. His reputation DID need to be redeemed, but mostly because of things that had been forced on him or that he didn’t really do (kill his mother, rig the election), but that’s another story…\n\nBottom Line Redemption\n\nBut it isn’t just Peter August, John Dixon, James Steinbeck, Nola Reardon, or Michael Baldwin. Redemption is a long term important part of soap operas. Soap operas are long term, long format stories. You have to have journeys and multiple characters for each character. If they don’t sometimes fall there is no tension. If there is not tension there are no interesting stories. If characters fall, they have to have a way to work their way back. (See Note 4)\n\nRedemption is the name of the game in soap operas and also a good example for real life. Even more than on soaps real people will make mistakes and have to make up for it. Real people get on the wrong track and lose their way. Everyone needs to earn their way back. Soaps give you a constant example that it’s never too late for you to find redemption either.\n\nNOTE 1: Although personally I’m very much enjoying this version of Anna and Valentine going after Peter, I think a more gripping storyline would be having Anna trying to track down Peter to get him in a psych hospital for help instead of just being “GET HIM!” and having Peter still trying to get Anna for what he sees as her traitorous actions. I mean GH was one of the few soaps ever with a full time, on canvas shrink. USE KEVIN! They need to do better confronting mental illness whether you think Peter is just plain evil or not.\n\nNOTE 2: Read the post I linked in the article above for more, but I’ll just say here that I don’t understand now WHY I liked Kelly and Morgan so much. Was it just their storyline? Did I, as a pretty darn little kid, see myself as Morgan because she was portrayed as rather childlike before the Kelly storyline started? I’m just not sure. Every other soap couple I’ve ever liked, I can look back and totally understand why. Kelly and Morgan I still love, but I don’t get why, still they had one of the all time great storylines (and no Josh that doesn’t mean I’ve forgiven you).\n\nNOTE 3: A white elephant party is normally thrown around the Christmas holidays although you can really have it any time of year. Your ticket in the door is bringing the worst gift you got this year – or ever, you set the rules. Then there is a drawing and everyone gets one of the gifts that someone else brought. You will sometimes also see stores described as a white elephant store, but basically these are just second hand shops that normally try to have a few more out there items than usual. So thanks to Nola both Kelly and Morgan thought the other one had classed their present to each other as the worst they got and one they were willing to give away.\n\nNOTE 4: It’s out of place in this particular post, but I’ll also point out that another with soaps today is the instantaneous restoration of characters without redemption. This isn’t characters that nothing they do can be wrong just because they do it- not an interesting way to tell the story. No, this is regular characters who do something wrong and without atonement or redemption are just let off. OK, the other characters say and move on. The Bold and the Beautiful springs to mind with this one, especially Ridge Forester, Brooke Logan, and Liam Spencer. Do they ever work back into good graces? Is there much in the way of consequences for their actions? I just don’t think so.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I thought it must have been quite impactful to be around in the moment when it happened. I talked with my mom and my cousin about watching the news after JFK was shot. My cousin was watching As the World Turns live in our living room when Nancy was interrupted and the assassination news came on. I had watch the videos, the tapes, I knew the country had come to a stop, but I hadn’t experienced it. (See Note)\n\nNow, I know what they felt like when I asked. The 9/11 attack was 20 years ago. There is an entire generation of people who weren’t gathered around their TVs watching the second Tower fall. Each year that passes means a smaller percentage of the population will remember it. It will become like Gettysburg, Pearl Harbor, and JFK’s assassination. An important point on a timeline, but only a dot, only photos, only stories. For them it won’t be a memory. The cold pit in your stomach won’t be a thing they felt and so I like to revisit it every year. To at least keep the photos and stories in memory.\n\nBut there really aren’t any more new soap related stories now. Soap operas played an important role in the beginning and then proceeded to back away as quickly as they could. I wish I could tell you more soap stories about it. Maybe that they continued to write Phillip on Days of Our Lives like they remembered he lost part of his leg after signing up and serving in that war. Or maybe that Stitch on The Young and the Restless who just made a short return and played some of his experience as a field medic. But I can’t. It has fallen out of the lives of our soap opera family even quicker than it dropped away in real life. I’ve already written all about how soap operas helped pull us through that terrible time.\n\nThis year I decided instead to point to a documentary I found out about through We Love Soaps. It’s about popular culture in general, but does talk about the role soap operas played. Watch it. Remember. And appreciate how important soap operas are to American life.\n\nNOTE: There is a political tone in this example. If you like or dislike John McCain you may not want to read any further, but that’s just the set up for my example, not my point. I once told a co-worker when we were talking about John McCain about the video he made when captured and how it was the most romantic thing ever. I still can’t get over that he went from the man in that video to dumping his wife for another woman – who then acted like she’d been his wife when all that happened. Anyway the set up wasn’t important. My co-worker very snarkily said, “I wasn’t old enough to see it.” First off, did he not know videos (no matter what the format) are a thing and how did he not see that video of he even had just briefly gone over the Vietnam War in a high school history class? It’s a pretty important video having been released by the Viet Cong showing they had not only captured another American citizen, but a politically important one. It’s used most times when documentaries or news reports talk about Vietnam POWs. McCain was offered to be traded, but he refused because the prisoners of war had established a first in/first out agreement among themselves and he honored it. That is to say I hadn’t seen the video on the evening news either, but later watching documentaries about the history of the Vietnam War. (Also, just how old did this co-worker think I was? I was born after Vietnam fell.) BUT my point is that I didn’t see it live. Watching it later, knowing what is going to happen after is a completely different thing. Also, that no matter how important something is, if it didn’t happen to them there are a lot of people will either forget it or never be taught about it. Or snark that they weren’t old enough to have seen it.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

So I decided to create one and update it as I found more. I previously put together individual lists for Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless, but this is all soaps. Check my lists here of books from several soaps and please give me suggestions for updates if you know of any I’ve missed on any soap. I’d also like to give a shout out to the March 6, 2017 issue of Soap Opera Digest which published a short list of titles several I didn’t already had.\n\nAll My Children\n\nErica Kane worked to write her memoirs with ghost writer Mike Roy (who she then became involved with) in 1984. Her book was called Raising Kane.\n\nAnother World\n\nFelicia Gallant was an acclaimed romance novelist.\n\nFelicia Gallant’s assistant Julia Shearer wrote a successful romance novel called Savage Love in 1983.\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nSeth Snyder was a successful novelist. His first published novel was called Sabrina after he had helped then fiance Frannie Hughes find her thought dead half-sister/full cousin of the same name. After romances with both Sabrina and Frannie fizzled he moved to New York to pursue writing.\n\nEmma Snyder was tapped by her son’s publisher, Ned Simon, to take over the romance novel series that was ghost written under the pen name and series name Amber d’Amour.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nA profile of Rick March 25, 2015 (technically a magazine, but gets credit for effort)\n\nCover 2015:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RicksPinkShirt/status/580891348032602112/photo/1\n\nRead it here:\n\nhttp://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sldbdt\n\nDark Shadows\n\nThe Life and Death of Barnabas Collins, written by William Hollingshead Loomis. The blurb lists his other best selling novels: Pride of Lions, Gold Hatted Lover, and World Beyond the Doors. This is from their parallel time storyline.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nAccording to the January 14, 2019 issue of Soap Opera Digest, Kate Roberts was seen reading Ladies of the Lake. This isn’t a fake book but a real novel by Ken Corday the show’s executive producer.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nLove in Maine by Connie Falconeri aka Kate Howard/Molly Davis. Molly wrote the original novel, but Connie stole it and edited it to make it steamer. It was published in March 2013 and the truth of the authorship came out later that year. Expanded from a script called Maine Squeeze (which IMNHO is a much better title).\n\nLust for Death by Lucy Cole. Lucy came to town as a quiet librarian. She was involved with Kevin O’Connor who used her for an alibi in his murder case. After he dumped her, she wrote a tell all book for the money.\n\nMan Landers is an advice book based on a popular advice blog of the same name. Nathan West became the front man, but the book and blog were actually written by nurse Amy Driscoll. Amy used the money from it to pay her veteran brother’s medical bills. It was published in 2017. The title is a play on Ann Landers who wrote a long running advice column in direct competition to one written by her twin sister Abigail Van Buren aka Dear Abby.\n\nThe Severed Branch by P.K. Sinclair was published in early 2018. It’s a novel written by Faison’s son Hedrick aka Peter August. It uses one of Faison’s favorite false identies as a nom de keyboard.\n\nWhen Kristina Corinthos-Davis was in the Day of Dawn cult in early 2019 they had a book called, Every Day is a New Dawn.\n\nGuiding Light\n\nThe Pirate’s Woman – A romance novel Blake reads on her honeymoon\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/the-pirates-woman\n\nBlake Marler’s Novels One True Love and Hearts Alonehttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/blake-marler-book-update-2015\n\nThe Novels of Phillip Granville Spaulding\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/the-novels-of-phillip-spaulding\n\n“Prom Night” – A short story by Phillip Granville Spaulding\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/phillip-writes-prom-night/\n\nPhillip Spaulding’s Fake Fake books from Harley’s Fantasy\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/phillips-fake-harley-books\n\nPhillip Spaulding’s biography of Lujack\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/phillips-biography-of-lujack\n\nHenry Bradshaw “Coop” Cooper Stories From Jenna\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/stories-from-jenna\n\nBarbara Norris (Holly’s mother) wrote a syndicated cooking column according to the December 30, 1986 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nLoving\n\nStacey Donovan wrote several successful novels including 1988’s Promises to Keep.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nVicki Lord’s then husband Sloan Carpenter wrote a biography of Victor Lord called Lord of the Banner in 1993. (The Banner was the newspaper he ran.)\n\nSanta Barabara\n\nMegan Richarson was a successful romance writer when she came to town in 1989 to work on C.C. Capwell’s biography.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nA special shout out to E LeBrun who has a collection of props used on The Young and the Restless and very kindly took a photo of her fake books part of her prop collection.\n\nKatherine Moore Shepard (Kay) Chancellor’s tell all autobiography (from her own point of view of course which means a lot of distortion) was called I’m Going to Live ‘Til I Die and was co-authored with Amber Moore. Of all the fake books on Y&R this is the one I wish I could read most (except Bumpy the Camel). Jeanne Cooper, the actress who played Katherine, did do a life story for real including backstage stories about her time on the soap. It’s called Not Young, Still Restless: A Memoir.\n\nVictor Newman was the subject of not one, but two biographies that only exist in Genoa City. Victor’s often referenced unauthorized autobiography is called Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story, and was written by Leanna Love under the pen name Nora Randall. His friend Douglas Austin was working on an approved biography, parts of which Leanna lifted and Austin never finished his book after that scandal hit. After Leanna got to know Victor (before he found out she had written Ruthless) she felt she hadn’t done him justice and published an authorized and more balanced biography under her real name Victor Newman – The Man and the Myth by Leanna “Love” Randolph. Scott Granger started work on a second official biography in 2017, but the storyline was scrapped while the book was still in the research stage. Like Jeanne Cooper, Eric Braeden who plays Victor has written his real life biography named after Victor’s favorite catchphrase, I’ll Be Damned: How My Young and Restless Life Led Me to America’s #1 Daytime Drama.\n\nWhile Nina Webster worked on at least one other book and did the initial draft for a movie based on Kay’s book Live Until I Die, I have only found the title of one of her published books. A Cry in Thin Air was based on Nina’s introduction story where she was pregnant by a juvenile delinquent named Jimmy and the home for pregnant girls she ended up in Geona City actually ended up being a front for a baby stealing ring (Rose Deville, criminal extraordinaire). Nina spent years hunting for her first born son in real time and eventually he was revealed in the person of federal officer Ronan. Ronan had read the book after discovering his true identity (a nifty feat since his adoptive parents were unaware of Nina’s name and identity and it didn’t appear on the paperwork) and used the information in the book to track down his biological father who had died of the same rare disease Ronan suffered from until he was cured by a transplant from his half-brother via Nina, Chance.\n\nTraci Abbott published at least three novels. Echoes of the Past was a novelized account of her life of living in her sister Ashley Abbott’s shadow. Her second novel was called Epitaph for a Lover. Traci was working on a third novel when she moved to New York. No further progress has been reported on air and the title for the third book wasn’t included in the reference I found. Just recently I found another title. I’m not sure whether this was the third book she was working on when she moved to New York or if this was in fact a fourth novel, but thanks to E LeBrun we know there was a book by her used on a set called On the Wings of Idiots. Still waiting for a Work In Progress mention guys!\n\nLori Brooks wrote two known novels. The more well known is In My Sister’s Shadow which was a lightly veiled version of her story of her life with her famous pianist sister. The second was called Naked at Dawn.\n\nThere are also children’s books only for the children of Geona City. The children of Genoa City love the children’s series Bumpy the Camel. The author is still turning out new books in this wonderful series that has sold out on first day offerings at the local Geona City bookstore. The author does not live in Geona City.\n\nKnots Landing\n\nCapricorn Crude by Valene Ewing – based on her experiences with the Ewing family\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nNote: These are from movies not soaps, but Mental Floss also shared a list of Fake books.\n\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/65185/12-fake-books-drive-plots-your-favorite-movies\n\nAlso, a personal favorite from TV, the Honeybunnies:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/hunnybunnies\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.
