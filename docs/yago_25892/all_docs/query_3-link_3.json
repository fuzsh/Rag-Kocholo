She is an actress, known for Guiding Light (1952), A Million Happy Nows (2017) and One Life to Live (1968). She has been married to Brian Malloy since May 3, 2008. They have one child.\n\nLeccia joined the cast of Guiding Light on April 25, 2007 as Natalia Rivera, Gus Aitoro’s (Ricky Paull Goldin) long lost high school sweetheart. Leccia’s character Natalia was paired with Crystal Chappell’s character Olivia Spencer as the popular same-sex supercouple known by the portmanteau Otalia during the last several months of Guiding Light, which ended its 72-year run on 18 September 2009.\n\nLeccia is working with ex Guiding Light castmate Chappell again on Chappell’s new webseries, Venice: The Series, in which she plays Ani, a photographer and ex-girlfriend of Crystal Chappell’s character, Gina. Along with Chappell and Leccia, other ex Guiding Light stars Jordan Clarke, Tina Sloan and Gina Tognoni joined the cast of Venice. Venice aired its first episode on December 4, 2009.\n\nLeccia has also made appearances in the prime time shows Law & Order: Trial by Jury and Love Monkey."
