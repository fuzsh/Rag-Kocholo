        "text": "Volume V: Response to Comments Comment Category 25 – Research 2) While marine debris is a larger problem in shallow water because many items float rather than sink, at what depth does it cease to be of concern To our knowledge, there has never been a coordinated depth zonation study for marine debris starting from land and going down to at least 400 m at a site known for its accumulation (e.g., Pearl and Hermes) and/or a site near a monk seal colony. Monk seals, as I am sure most are aware, have been documented to frequent precious coral beds down to depths of 400 m (see Frank Parrish’s studies and his <strong>National</strong> Geographic Explorer production). We think a study of this type could and should be mentioned in the plan. How much bottomfishing debris (anchors, anchor lines, fishing leads and fishing lines) exists on popular deepwater fishing sites This might be important to document particularly following the closure of the fishery in the next 4-5 years. In the main Hawaiian Islands, alien species have been documented in deeper than typical SCUBA depths (see Sam Kahng’s various papers on Carijoa riseii). Is this species in the monument and if so, how deep does it go given that monument waters are clearer and thus likely pushing it to even deeper depths than in the MHI (C. riseii is negatively phototaxic). How big of a threat is it to the monument’s black coral beds Again, we think this should be mentioned as a potential research effort in the plan. A likely study site and one for long-term monitoring focus would be Middle Bank at the lower end of the monument. 3) Therefore, my proposal is that NO research should be conducted in or around the NWHI for the next 10 years unless it will benefit the protection and restoration of these islands. After 10 years researchers can go in and do their tests on the status of restoration efforts only when approved by the citizen based advisory council. 4) Permission should only be granted to research absolutely necessary for protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and restoration of those habitats as needed. Research having only tangential or general relevance to critical management decisions in the <strong>Monument</strong> should be revised to clearly distinguish between these two categories of research proposals. 5) In addition to the Proclamation findings and permitting criteria, the Research and Monitoring Action Plan must prioritize research and provide criteria that managers will use regularly to fund and prioritize research activities in the <strong>Monument</strong>. 6) 3.1.1 <strong>Marine</strong> Conservation Science Action Plan. Ocean Conservancy is concerned that the “Desired Outcome” stated at the beginning of this section fails to capture all of the research outcomes that are required for effective <strong>Monument</strong> management. The statement should reflect all five of the thematic areas in the Hawaiian Archipelago <strong>Marine</strong> Ecosystem Research Plan (HAMER Plan) and repeated here in this section. As currently written it fails to cover the critical need to research and understand human impacts, among other elements. Under “Strategies to Achieve the Desired Outcome”, Strategies MCS-1, 2 and 314 are not linked to the basic requirement that all research serve to improve management of the <strong>Monument</strong>. We suggest that these strategies December 2008 290"
