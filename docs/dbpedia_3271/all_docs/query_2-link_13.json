        "text": "The NFL's full regular-season schedule was announced Wednesday and it got the usual over-the-top coverage from broadcasters, including the league's network and ESPN2.

They'll host the New York Giants in their annual Thanksgiving game, too. The 49ers, who will host the Cowboys on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 8, will host the Jets to open the season on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 1. They'll also close out \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 17. The Jets are split evenly among the three networks in prime-time slots.\n\nThere are nine teams in the league with five prime-time games each this season. Four teams — the Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans, New England Patriots and Arizona Cardinals — will appear in just a single prime time game. The Cardinals' game is an ESPN+ exclusive.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are the only team in the league that didn't get a prime-time game.\n\nPanthers are odd man out\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are the only NFL team without a prime-time game this season — maybe they can paint a better picture next year.\n\nFull NFL schedule: Every single game that will be played in 2024\n\nWant to know when every single game of the 2024 season will be played?

And it's not just the traditional networks anymore.\n\nNetflix has entered the fray with a pair of Christmas games. The NFL announced that partnership, which will include Christmas games the next three years on Netflix, on Wednesday. Peacock, NBC's streaming service, had a regular season game and a playoff game last season. The playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs set a record as the largest streamed event in U.S. history. ESPN+ also got a game last season, when the Atlanta Falcons played the Jacksonville Jaguars in London during Week 4, and was given another exclusive game this season.\n\nThe NFL has many broadcast partners including its own NFL Network to satisfy with quality matchups, and a lot of subscriptions for fans if they want all the games. Here's how the NFL handled handing out matchups to the streaming services this season.\n\nChicago Bears go back to school for 2024 schedule release\n\nCowboys to host Giants on Thanksgiving, holiday games feature first-ever contests on Netflix\n\nGet out your calendars, NFL fans. It's time to make some holiday plans.\n\nIt doesn't matter that it's only May. The NFL released the full schedule of holiday games for the 2024 season on Wednesday night.\n\nOld traditions, like the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions playing on Thanksgiving, continue to endure, but the offerings have expanded in recent years to include games on Black Friday and Christmas Day.\n\nCheck out all the holiday games here.\n\nWe think you should...watch this schedule release video\n\nFan of great QB matchups?

And now we know who is playing who, and when.\n\nThe NFL released its 18-week regular-season schedule on Wednesday. There are 272 games now on the calendar. Not all of them are equal.\n\nHere are the 10 (well, actually 11) best games on the schedule for the 2024 regular season.\n\nTitans bring back an old friend to announce their schedule\n\nRams take their NFL schedule for a ride\n\nThe Sunday Night Football schedule is here\n\nChiefs, Jets, 49ers and Cowboys rule prime time\n\nThe wait is almost over..."
