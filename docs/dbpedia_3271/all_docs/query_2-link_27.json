        "text": "Pep Guardiola's Manchester City have been crowned Premier League champions for a record fourth season in a row after beating West Ham on the final day.\n\nCity clinched the victory they needed at the Etihad to pip Arsenal to the title by two points - their sixth Premier League triumph of the Guardiola era.\n\nNeeding victory to be certain of retaining their crown, Phil Foden fired City in front in the second minute and added a second soon after to ease any nerves.\n\nMohammed Kudus' overhead kick late in the first half shifted the momentum briefly but Rodri's low strike early in the second half ended any hope that Arsenal supporters may have had that City would slip up on the final day and gift them the title.\n\nCity trailed Liverpool by three points and Arsenal by one when they drew at home to the Gunners on March 31 - but they went on to win their final nine league games to surge to the top of the standings.\n\nAnd under Guardiola's stewardship, they have now surpassed Manchester United to become the only side to win the Premier League four times in a row.\n\nNeville's praise for Guardiola\n\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville, speaking on co-commentary, said: \"What an amazing achievement from Manchester City's players and coach.\n\n\"Man City come back week after week, month after month, season after season. From a sporting perspective, you can't take anything away from them. They are at such a high level.\"\n\nAhead of the trophy lift, Neville added \"Pep's designed a style of football which has been revered around Europe. He's a winning machine.\"\n\nMan City win the Premier League - reaction\n\nPremier League table | Watch free Premier League highlights\n\nStream Sky Sports with NOW | Get Sky Sports\n\nPremier League top scorers 2023/24\n\nMan City's win in stats\n\nPep Guardiola has won his sixth Premier League title - just the fourth manager to win six English top-flight titles, along with Sir Alex Ferguson (13), George Ramsay (6) and Bob Paisley (6).\n\nManchester City have now gone 35 matches unbeaten in all competitions, the longest run ever by a Premier League team.\n\nIn English top-flight history, the only team with a longer unbeaten run is Nottingham Forest in 1978 (40 in a row).\n\nPhil Foden has scored six goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season. It is the most by a player in the competition since 2018-19, when Christian Eriksen scored six.\n\nRodri has not lost a single match he's played in the Premier League this season, with only five of Arsenal's Invincibles from 2003-04 playing in more games without losing in a season.\n\nIndeed, Rodri has now gone 50 consecutive Premier League appearances without losing, only the second player to achieve that along with Sol Campbell.\n\nCity crowned again - what the players said\n\nFoden, who was player of the match in Sunday's 3-1 win over West Ham after scoring two goals, told Sky Sports: \"Not just me, all the lads have played in important games, we've played this scenario over. We were confident. It's paid off.\n\n\"It was the perfect start [scoring after two minutes]. This feeling will never get old. I want this winning feeling always.\"\n\nKevin De Bruyne, now a six-time Premier League winner, says this is one of his \"most special\" titles after bouncing back from a difficult season with injury.\n\n\"It feels as amazing as the first one,\" added De Bruyne. \"We worked so hard for it, it's been a tough battle with Arsenal and Liverpool. Doing something historic is so special.\n\n\"To come back in the way that I could and to help the team and be at a good level is a good achievement for me personally.\"\n\nGolden Boot winner Erling Haaland said the midweek victory over Spurs had felt decisive, adding: \"I think after we won at Spurs, we kinda knew we were going to do it. I was confident.\"\n\nAnalysis: How Guardiola did it again\n\nSky Sports' Adam Bate:\n\nIn a season that was notable for Jurgen Klopp announcing his departure from Liverpool because he was \"running out of energy\" to do the job, Pep Guardiola was able to push Manchester City on to the Premier League title once again.\n\nThat relentless drive remains, that appetite to coax yet more from a team that had already achieved it all in winning the treble. Victory in the FA Cup final will complete another double - back-to-back doubles for the first time in English football history.\n\nBeating West Ham on the final day of the Premier League season makes City the first team to win English football's league title four times in a row too. It is an accomplishment that Guardiola prizes, having appeared to use it to spur on himself and the group.\n\n\"There is a myth around City that they have a massive squad,\" said Jamie Carragher. \"They have never had a massive squad. They have 15 or 16 players who are top class. If they had a bit of bad luck with injuries, one of the big players were out, how would they cope with that?\"\n\nIt was a question that this City squad had to answer..\n\nRead more analysis on City's latest Premier League title win\n\nFA Cup final glory bid\n\nThere have been individual honours for FWA player of the year Foden and Golden Boot winner Erling Haaland but the City team now turn their attentions to the FA Cup final.\n\nThey will hope to complete the double by beating neighbours Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday May 25.\n\nWatch: The goals that guided City to another title\n\nPremier League winners: The previous champions and who gets a medal\n\nWho won the first Premier League title and who has the most crowns?"
