        "text": "It's hard to not have optimism looking at the 2024 Baltimore Ravens season preview and odds after what John Harbaugh's team put together last season.\n\nThe Ravens rattled off a 13-4 record and were arguably the best team in the regular season before falling short in the AFC Championship game to the Chiefs. But, can they repeat that success this season and maybe take the next step?\n\nHere's my complete preview of the Ravens' 2024 chances and all major NFL odds markets:\n\n2024 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl & AFC Odds\n\nOdds as of August 7\n\nAfter an amazing 2023, the Ravens opened the offseason at +850 (3rd) to win the Super Bowl this year. They've stayed pretty consistent in that market, dropping slightly after the summer losses of OL Kevin Zietler, LB Patrick Queen, and others.\n\nThe big key for Baltimore this year is the offensive line. The Ravens ask a lot of their OL given the run-first offense and elaborate pull schemes. So, losing Zeitler, OG John Simpson, and OT Morgan Moses will be tough. I have high expectations for second-year guard Andrew Vorhees, but it's still a lot to ask of young lineman like him.\n\nThe Ravens are probably a near-lock to make the playoffs either way, but suspect offensive line play could hold them back from winning the AFC North with strong contenders like the Bengals lurking. Even the Steelers and Browns are no joke (okay maybe the Browns are kind of a joke, but they're still decent).\n\nBeyond the Chiefs, the Ravens have as good of a shot at winning the AFC Championship or Super Bowl as basically any team in the league, and these odds reflect that.\n\n2024 Baltimore Ravens Win Total Odds\n\nOdds as of August 1\n\nI think this win total is pretty fair for Baltimore, as they're likely an 11-win team on paper.\n\nThe Ravens have the fourth-hardest schedule in football this year, which likely drags down this win total. But, if the offensive line holds up, the Ravens have the talent to win 12 or even 13 games like they did last year.\n\nIf you want to bet Baltimore game-to-game, keep an eye on the road contests. The Ravens really made their betting bread on the road last year, rocking a 5-2 ATS record away from home. They were 7-3 ATS on the road in 2022, as well.\n\n2024 Baltimore Ravens Playoff Odds\n\nOdds as of August 7\n\nI honestly love these -250 odds for Baltimore to make the playoffs. Obviously every team is susceptible to a few key injuries that derail a season, but barring that I don't see a way the Ravens don't get to the dance.\n\nWith reigning-MVP Lamar Jackson at QB and a deep and threatening defense, the Ravens' floor is probably nine wins. Even that could get them to the playoffs.\n\n2024 Baltimore Ravens NFL MVP Odds\n\nOdds as of August 7\n\nLamar Jackson won his second MVP in 2023, but it's going to be hard for him to go back-to-back. I already broke down above how Baltimore's offensive line is likely to take a step back this season, but there is more to my doubts of Jackson repeating.\n\nFor starters, Baltimore's 13-win season last year earned the Ravens an extra-hard schedule this season. And, voters just don't give out consecutive MVPs often. Aaron Rodgers (2020 and 2021) is the only player to win it twice in a row since Peyton Manning in 2008 and 2009. They're the only two guys to do it in the last 30 years, too."
