        "text": "So far, we might have heard much about famous footballers, young talents, top soccer players of all time, and so on, yet we don’t recall much about famous dead football players some of whom even experienced a tragic death. This post is dedicated to their loving memory.\n\nEveryone dies one day, but the footballers we're about to tell you about were among those who died tragically, either by suicide or by murder.\n\nNot all of them, in fact. Some of them have died on the field as a result of heart failure, lethal blows, or other causes. Covering all\n\nfamous dead soccer players\n\nin a single post may be beyond your patience, but as previously stated, this piece is dedicated to the fond memories of some of the most famous of them.\n\nFamous dead football players who are not among us anymore\n\nThat's a fact, too. They are not among us anymore, but their memory will always remain with us and with football fans, especiall older ones.\n\nAndres Escobar (Colombia)\n\nThe death of Colombian star, Andres Escobar, was shocking news to the football world in 1994. Before his death, Escobar had played for Colombia in 51 matches. Everything started from the own goal he scored in World Cup 1994: In a match against USA while trying to cut off a pass, the defender netted an own goal that led to USA’s win.\n\nUpon returning to Columbia, despite several warnings not to, Escobar visited two bars and met up with his friends. After they split up around 3 a.m. midnight, Escobar got a visit from three men and a woman in the parking lot.\n\nAn argument concerning his own goal ensued, and the 27-year-old defender insisted that the own goal had been a mistake, however, two of the men, pulled out their guns to make him one of the\n\nfootballers who died\n\nin a shooting. He was shot six times and left to bleed out in the parking lot, and the men fled away in a truck.\n\nEscobar’s funeral attended by over 120,000 people only means that he is one of the most\n\npopular dead soccer players in the world\n\n. After his murder, several players in the Colombian national team left the team for ever with some of them even quitting the whole game altogether.\n\nDavie Cooper (Scotland)\n\nA match-winner in every sense of the phrase, Davie Cooper stunned his fans by his death only at the age of 39 in 1995. Many believed he was the most gifted Scottish player of all time along with Denis Law, Jim Baxter and Kenny Dalglish. When ball was at his feet, no-one knew what to expect. He ran at defenders, showed them a glimpse of the ball, pulled it back, feinted and then went often past several players.\n\nThe former\n\nRangers\n\nand Scotland winger, who had appeared 22 times for the Scotland national team, died in a Glasgow hospital after a brain hemorrhage. Cooper was to retire at the end of the season, but he collapsed unexpectedly at Clyde's Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld while he was filming a coaching video.\n\n“Scotland has lost a national treasure,” said the\n\nCeltic\n\nmanager, Tommy Burns, in honor of his death, and the Rangers striker,\n\nAlly McCoist\n\n, also said: “We feel we have lost a brother. He will always be with this club.”\n\nMarc-Vivien Foe (Cameroon)\n\nMarc-Vivien Foe’s death in 2003 was one of the greatest tragedies seen on the soccer pitch at the time. The midfielder was playing for his country against Colombia at France’s Stade de Gerland in the Confederations Cup semi-finals when he suddenly fell on the ground in the 72nd minute.\n\nHis team’s medics tried hard for 45 minutes to save his life by giving him oxygen and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation off the field, but all in vain. Although he was still alive after arriving at Gerland’s medical center, he died shortly afterward. He's indeed among the most\n\nfamous dead footballers in history\n\n.\n\nFoe’s first autopsy could not determine the exact cause of death, but a second one revealed that he had died of natural causes. “He was suffering from a cardiomyopathy hypertrophia [abnormally enlarged] left ventricle, something that is almost untraceable without carrying out an extensive examination,” Public prosecutor Xavier Richaud said.\n\nKnown for his generosity off the field, Foe funded a soccer academy for boys and girls in Yaounde. Harry Redknapp, who brought him to West Ham in 1999, once said about him: “I don't think he ever made an enemy in his life.”\n\nGary Speed (England)\n\nGary Speed, one of the most famous and inspirational footballers of his time who was mostly known for his powerful headers throughout his career was found dead in the garage of his house in Cheshire on November 27, 2011 by his wife, Louise.\n\nThe cause of death was announced self-suspension, although the coroner said: \"the evidence does not sufficiently determine whether this was intentional or accidental.\"\n\nFootball star passed away\n\nat the age of 42, Speed captained the Wales national soccer team before becoming\n\nSheffield United\n\n’s manager in 2010/11 season. His primary role as a player was left-attacking-midfielder, but he also played as central-midfielder and left-back.\n\nHe was the most capped outfield player for Wales with 85 appearances between 1990 and 2004, and also held the record for the most appearances in the Premier League at 535, until it was surpassed by David James. He's indeed among the most\n\nfamous dead footballers of all time\n\nand among those who experienced a tragic death.\n\nWith such records he is indeed among the most famous\n\ndead football players\n\nin history. His former Wales teammate,\n\nRyan Giggs\n\n, once said about him: “He was a room-mate of mine. He was just a very intelligent man, the ultimate professional, a brilliant player and mostly a great leader.”\n\nAntonio Puerta (Spain)\n\n22 at the time of his death, Antonio Puerta is another famous\n\ndead football player\n\nwho played as a wing-back both for his club team,\n\nSevilla\n\n, and Spain national team during his life. In the 35th minute of a match against Getafe at Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, Puerta collapsed while heading back toward his own goal.\n\nHe lost consciousness, but again he could walk off the pitch after being attended to by Sevilla’s medical staff. However, he collapsed again in the changing rooms and was given cardiac resuscitation.\n\nPuerta was taken to Virgen del Rocio hospital in Seville, where he finally passed at 14:30 that day due to post-anoxic encephalopathy and a multiple failure of his organs caused by the prolonged cardiac arrest as stated by the medical staff at the hospital.\n\nPuerta will always be remembered for the brilliant goal he netted in UEFA Cup 2005/06 semi-final against\n\nSchalke 04\n\nwith his left foot in the 100th minute that led to Sevilla’s 1-0 win and qualified them for the final where they won Middlesbrough 4-0 and earned their fifth title only in fifteen months.\n\n“Today is one of the saddest days in the history of Sevilla Football Club. That diamond left foot of Antonio Puerta’s has left us, that left foot that changed our lives has left us.” said Sevilla president, Jose Maria del Nido, to reporters.\n\nPuerta's funeral was held within 48 hours from his death with people from all across Spain who had travelled to Sevilla to take part in the event. Puerta's coffin was laid in the stadium for thousands of people who had waited for hours to pay their homage. As his body was taken to its final resting place, it appeared as if the entire city lined the streets in his respect.\n\nMiklos Feher (Hungary)\n\nJanuary 25, 2004, Benfica vs Vitoria de Guimaraes, Injury time:\n\nBenfica\n\n’s Feher, who was substituted in the 60th minute, received a yellow card in the stoppage time for time wasting.\n\nThe 24-year-old striker smiled at the referee’s decision and went back to his post, but suddenly in a matter of seconds he bent over with his hands on his knees and fell backwards. His teammates rushed to his side, with one lifting him up to prevent him from swallowing his tongue.\n\nThe match was stopped for 15 minutes as Benfica’s medical staff attended Feher. Several of Benfica’s players dropped to their knees and prayed with tears in their eyes. Even some club personnel, including the coach, Jose Antonio Camacho, were crying.\n\nPartly revived, Feher was stretchered off the pitch and taken to a nearby hospital. As they were taking him to the ambulance, Benfica’s center-back, Argel, opened the ambulance door and shouted: “Don’t let him die.”\n\nBut to all’s surprise, Feher was pronounced dead about 3 hours later. Another\n\nsoccer player who died\n\ntragically during his career, leaving his club members and fans in shock. The cause of his death was announced cardiac arrhythmia caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – a heart muscles disease.\n\nBenfica’s next few matches were postponed, and the club retired the number-29 shirt in Feher’s honor. Also, in the following season, when Benfica won the league title, Feher’s parents were presented with the League Championship medal to honor the striker’s memory. Maybe as one of the most\n\npopular dead football players in the world\n\n?\n\nPhil O’Donnell (Scotland)\n\nA Scottish professional footballer who played as a midfielder for Motherwell, Celtic and\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nduring his career, Phil O’Donnel also won PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year award twice.\n\nHe was a key player in the Scottish Cup final between Motherwell and Dundee United who contributed to his team 4-3 victory by his diving header. Former Scottish professional footballer,\n\nAlly McCoist\n\n, commenting on the match, described him as being “brave as a lion”.\n\nOn December 29, 2007, again captain O’Donnel appeared in a match against Dundee United, this time not to see the end of the match: As he was about to be substituted, he collapsed on the pitch with no reason, leaving all his teammates in astonishment what had really happened.\n\nO’Donnel received medical treatment from both teams’ medical staff on the pitch before he was taken to Wishaw General Hospital. He was pronounced dead shortly after his team’s 5-3 victory against Dundee United. \"The post-mortem revealed that Phil - 35 at the time of his death - had suffered left ventricular failure of the heart,\" Dr. Robert Liddle, Motherwell's doctor, announced later.\n\nIn honor of O’Donnel’s memory, the Main Stand at Fir Park was renamed The Phil O’Donnel Stand by Motherwell. Phil’s teammates also paid their own tributes by having his signature embroidered on their strips for the remainder of the 2007-08 season.\n\nRobert Enke (Germany)\n\nOne of the\n\nfamous dead football players\n\nwith a tragic story of suicide: Hannover 96 goalkeeper, Robert Enke, took his own life in 2009 after six years of suffering from depression. Although Robert remained with the Bundesliga side, Hannover 96, for the majority of his career, he also played for topflight clubs such as Benfica and Barcelona.\n\nRobert also appeared eight times for the German national team and was part of the squad who finished as runners-up in Euro 2008. Had it not been for\n\nVictor Valdes\n\n’ brilliant appearances for\n\nBarcelona\n\n, he could have maintained his position as the team’s first-squad goalkeeper, but, it did not happen.\n\nEnke was sold to Turkey’s Fernerbahce and later to Tenerife before he made his return to his homeland to play for Hannover 96. The 32-year-old goalkeeper took his own life on November 10, 2009 by standing in front of a passing express train at a level crossing in Eilvese, Neustadt am Rübenberge. Police confirmed his suicide and found a suicide note, too, but never made its details public.\n\nEnke’s funeral was attended by more than 40,000 people, and his teammates displayed the number one in a circle on the breast of their jerseys for the rest of the 2009-10 Bundesliga season as a mark of respect to him. Perhaps among the most\n\nfamous dead soccer players\n\n, Robert Enke experienced one of the most tragic deaths in the history of football.\n\nFernando Ricksen (The Netherlands)\n\nAnother\n\nfamous dead footballer\n\nwho played as a right-back and right-midfielder, Fernando Ricksen, earned a number of trophies during his 19-year career including two Scottish Premier League titles, two Scottish cups, and three Scottish league cups with Glasgow Rangers.\n\nHe also won two Eerste Divise - the second-highest tier of football in Netherlands - titles with Fortuna Sittard and Alkmaar Zaanstreek before he joined Rangers in 2000. Ricksen was elected to Rangers' Hall of Fame in 2014 and appeared 12 times for the Netherlands national team between 2000 and 2003.\n\nFernando Ricksen died on September 18, 2019 at the age of 43, six years after he had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease – a disease where neurons send electric signals into muscles disrupting their normal function.\n\nNoteworthy to mention is that, the great physicist, Stephen Hopkins, also suffered from a type of the same disease. His funeral was held at Wellington Church in Glasgow on 25 September with officials from Glasgow Rangers and Celtic attending the ceremony, after which he was cremated in private.\n\nSocrates (Brazil)\n\nSócrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira, simply known as Socrates, but nicknamed\n\n“\n\nDr. Socrates\n\n”\n\n- for his medical degree and political awareness,\n\n“\n\nGolden Feet\n\n”\n\nand\n\n“\n\nBig Skinny\n\n”\n\nnot only was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players in March 2004 by the everlasting legend of football, Pele, but also by the World Soccer magazine in its “100 best footballers in history” list.\n\nSocrates is also in the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame. The Brazilian is one\n\nfamous dead football players\n\nwho is considered one of the greatest midfielders ever in football history. He also won the title of South American Footballer of the Year in 1983.\n\nSocrates played for Brazilian national team in two World Cups, in one of which – World Cup 1982 – he captained the Brazilian team, playing alongside other legends like Zico, Falcao, and Eder. One month before his death, Socrates had suffered gastrointestinal bleeding caused by cirrhosis of the liver – a condition that Socrates’ addiction to alcohol and cigarettes had contributed to.\n\nHe was discharged from the hospital nine days later, but again, the Brazilian legend was hospitalized on December 1, 2011 due to food poisoning which developed to septic shock and led to his death on December 4, 2011 at the age of 57.\n\nBrazilian president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, said about Socrates: “Brazil has lost one of its most cherished sons. On the field, with his talent and sophisticated touches, he was a genius. Off the field... he was active politically, concerned with his people and his country.”\n\nThe Italian legend, Paulo Rossi, paid tribute to his former opponent, saying: “It's a piece of our history that's broken off and gone away. Socrates seemed like a player from another era. You couldn't place him in any category - on the pitch and even more so off it.”\n\nMaybe Socrates, already a legend in football history, comes at the top of the list when it comes to famous\n\ndead football players\n\n.\n\nCheick Tiote (Ivory Coast)\n\nOne of the famous dead football players and a professional midfielder at his own time reputed for being determined and resilient with a keen eye for a pass, Cheik Tiote made his professional debut with the Belgian side, Anderlecht, in 2005 but he actually spent most of his club career at the Premier League club,\n\nNewcastle United\n\n, playing 156 games for the club between 2010 and 2017.\n\nSoon after his death, his teammates at Newcastle paid their tributes through social media. A statement on Newcastle official website also read: “We are devastated to have learnt of the tragic passing of Cheick Tiote at the age of just 30.”\n\nNewcastle manager at the time, Rafa Benitez, said about him: “In all the time that I have known him, he was a true professional, dedicated and above all, a great man. Our hearts go out to his family and friends at such a sad time.”\n\nTiote's memorial service was held in Beijing and attended by his Beijing Enterprises teammates and Papiss Cissé, a teammate of Tiote at Newcastle who had played with him. Two days later his body was flown back to the Ivory Coast where it was given a military funeral, attended by his national teammates and the prime minister, Amadou Gon Coulibaly.\n\nDiego Maradona (Argentina)\n\nDied on November 25, 2020, at the age of 60 in Buenos Aires due to a cardiac arrest, Diego Maradona is an Argentinian legendary footballer as big as legends like Pele and Johan Cryuff. He’s indeed the best footballer Argentina has ever had alongside the top Argentinian footballer, Lionel Messi. In fact, there is a debate if Messi is the best Argentinian footballer ever or Maradona. Some believe that’s Messi and some Maradona and yet some both. Whatever people believe, Maradona was and is, by no doubt, one of the legendary footballers Argentina has ever had.\n\nAnd what caused Maradona’s death? They say he is one of those\n\nsoccer players that died\n\nbecause of lifestyle. Unfortunately Maradona was addicted to drugs and alcohol and even quitted them once in 2007 but that didn’t change things a lot.\n\nNot only Maradona struggled with his alcohol and drug addiction but also with his weight-gain that actually had become a problem for him in the final years of his career to the extent that even he was allowed to use drugs in order to prevent weight gain. They also say that Maradona is one of the\n\ndead football players\n\nwho had a poor diet and a number of problems in his personal life that actually contributed to his poor health.\n\nPaolo Rossi (Italy)\n\nHowever what is Rossi is best known for is actually the part he played in Italy’s win against West Germany which actually earned them 1982 World Cup. He also scored a hat trick against Brazil in that tournament. The cause of Rossi’s death is not yet clearly determined, but it has been confirmed that he has died of a long illness.\n\nPele (Brazil)\n\nPelé, the Brazilian soccer legend who set a record by winning three World Cups, passed away at the age of 82 on December 29, 2022. Pelé was one of the most influential athletes of the 20th century.\n\nThe representative of \"the beautiful game\" had been receiving colon cancer therapy since 2021. According to the hospital where he had spent the previous month receiving treatment for the cancer, he passed away from multiple organ failure.\n\nEverything was changed by Pelé. Neymar, another Brazilian soccer star, commented on the transformation of sport into art and entertainment on Instagram. \"The King helped Brazil and football gain popularity! He is no longer there, but his magic lives on. Pelé is eternal!\n\nOne of soccer's all-time greats, Pelé spent nearly two decades thrilling supporters and stunning rivals as the sport's leading scorer for Brazilian club Santos and the Brazil national team. Pele and Maradona are undoubtedly the greatest\n\nsoccer legends that died\n\never.\n\nPlayers and spectators were mesmerized by his grace, athleticism, and captivating maneuvers. He orchestrated a quick, flowing style that transformed the game, personifying his nation's grace on the field with a samba-like flair.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nsource: SportMob"
