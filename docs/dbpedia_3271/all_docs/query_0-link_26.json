        "text": "This week in North Philly Notes, we debut the latest episode of the Temple University Press podcast. Host Gary Kramer interviews author William Gee Wong about his book Sons of Chinatown: A Memoir Rooted in China and America, an immigrant father-American son story that illustrates that immigration works despite systemic racism and American exceptionalism.\n\nThe Temple University Press Podcast is where you an hear about all the books you’ll want to read next.\n\nClick HERE to listen\n\nThe Temple University Press Podcast is available wherever you find your podcasts, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcast, and Overcast, among other outlets.\n\nAbout this episode\n\nWilliam Gee Wong’s Sons of Chinatown chronicles his and his father’s experiences in America. This memoir, a true labor of love, opens with a narrative of return—Bill’s first trip to China. It is full of emotional moments and palpable details of his father’s village that immerse readers not just in Bill’s experiences, but also seeks to understand his father’s.\n\n“Pop,” as Bill calls his dad, left China for America in 1912 not knowing English and with false papers. It is, perhaps, a familiar immigration tale—but Bill makes it an origin story. He has the rare vantage point of knowing his father’s experience of exclusion and embrace and he mirrors it against his own. Pop built a business in the bubble that was Oakland’s Chinatown, suffered a tragedy, and tried to find a sense of belonging. Bill did many of these things too, only differently.\n\nWhen Bill’s parents had him—he was Pop’s first son after six daughters—Bill was the favorite child. But he also felt a responsibility as the family’s only son. He describes that elegantly and eloquently in Sons of Chinatown as he recounts developing his Asian American identity over time.\n\nBill writes about becoming “American,” feeling inferior, and having no role model, but he also recounts forging his way as the only Chinese American on a newspaper’s staff in a city that had America’s first Chinatown. He writes about forming his racial, cultural, and ethnic identity as well as his political awakening. Bill talks about the racism he experienced and wonders if and how his racial identity helped or hurt his professional career.\n\nHis columns and articles about his community were well received which is gratifying. Bill had considerable success writing for The Wall Street Journal and appearing on The News Hour with Jim Lehrer.\n\nEarly on in Sons of Chinatown, Bill is told by his Chinese cousins that he had “you thlim” or “had heart.” Because Bill writes with a lot of heart. It’s what makes Sons of Chinatown so endearing."
