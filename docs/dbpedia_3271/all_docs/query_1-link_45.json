Because of a conflict with the Uruguayan FA, Peñarol had lost two points in the beginning of the championship; Nacional and Peñarol thereupon played a deciding match for the championship, won by Peñarol on penalties. That championship is here counted for Peñarol. Around the introduction of professionalism, Uruguayan football was split into two federations, the AUF and FUF, for two seasons before the two were unified. As in similar cases for Argentina (see [4]) we include all relevant championships. The total for Peñarol includes titles won by C.U.R.C.C.. For more detailed info, check the file on Uruguayan champions. [2] These totals include Czechoslovak, Czech and Slovak titles since 1925. Sparta won 19 Czechoslovak and 16 Czech titles; Slavia won 9 Czechoslovak and 11 Czech titles (they also claim an additional title for the unfinished 1948 season); Slovan won 8 Czechoslovak and 18 Slovak titles. [3] This includes Rapid's German title of 1941, along with their 32 Austrian titles. [4] Also includes titles won in the Campeonato Nacional 1967-1985. (Of those, River Plate, Boca Juniors and Independiente all won 3, Racing none, and San Lorenzo 2.) Argentine football went through several schisms. From 1912 to 1914 teams were divided in the Asociación and the Federación; from 1919 to 1926 in the Asociación Argentina and the Asociación Amateur; and from 1931 to 1934 in the Asociación and the Liga. These are all included. Alumni's total includes the title won as English High School. For more detailed info, check the file on Argentine champions. [5] Includes the 1984/85 title originally awarded to Trakija (now Botev) Plovdiv but returned to Levski in 1990. [6] Dinamo Kyiv won 13 Soviet Union championships and 16 Ukrainian ones. [7] Bangladesh totals include Dhaka League wins (prior to the existence of a national championship). [8] This includes the two titles Alianza won in 1918 and 1919 under their former name of Sport Alianza in the Liga Peruana. [9] Includes the 1951 title, which was won by virtue of the win of the inaugural Polish Cup, and in spite of the fact that Wisla Kraków won the league, in which Ruch only finished sixth. [10] Includes Prode 85 title. [11] Spora is the result of a merger between Sporting Club and Racing Club; in addition to the 11 championships of the merger club, Sporting won 2 and Racing 1. [12] Portuguese championship includes the experimental Campeonato de Liga 1934-1938 and the official Campeonato de Liga from 1938/39 onwards but not the Campeonato de Portugal 1921-1938 which as a knock-out tournament can be considered a predecessor of the current Taça de Portugal (since 1938). [13] Note that the Hongkong FA only recognises the 32 titles South China won after the reconstruction of the FA in 1945; 'our' total includes the 9 pre-war titles, including that of 1938 won by South China 'B'. [14] Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split now are in the Croatian league after Yugoslavia broke up. Dinamo Zagreb won 4 Yugoslav and 25 Croatian championships; the championships of Gradjanski Zagreb (5 in Yugoslavia before World War II and 1 in Croatia during the war) and HASK Zagreb (1 in Yugoslavia before World War II) are not added to their record as the actual connection of either club to the current one (officially formed in 1945, when both Gradjanski and HASK had already been dissolved) is debatable. Hajduk Split won 9 Yugoslav and 6 Croatian championships (not including 2 Croatian championships in 1941 and 1946, which were won in a regional league serving to qualify clubs for the Yugoslav championship, which eventually did not take place in either season). [15] Includes Clôture 2002 as apparently no play-off took place. [16] Olympic's record includes Secteur 6, Sahel's includes Secteur 7. [17] Simba's record includes Dar Sunderland; the 21 titles include 13 won in Tanzania's Union League (between Mainland and Island leagues) and 8 in the Mainland League since 2003 (as no Union League champions have been crowned after 2002). [18] Çetinkaya's record includes one title won in Cyprus before split. [19] South African records include the NPSL 1971-1984 and the NSL/PSL since the 1985 season. The 1996 league stage of the Coca Cola League Cup, won by Kaizer Chiefs, is not included, as it consisted of a single round robin only and was not considered a \"proper\" league at the time, although as its winners Kaizer Chiefs qualified for the 1997 CAF Champions Cup (only to withdraw from the tournament). [20] This includes their title shared with Bangkok Bank in 1967. [21] Tafea FC's titles were all won in the Port Vila Lik; in 2008 a 'national' competition called VFF Bred Cup Tournament was introduced to determine Vanuatu's participants in the OFC Champions Cup but most teams entering in that competition appear to be regional selections set up on an ad hoc basis rather than traditional club teams. [22] This includes their two titles won in the rebel LINFUNA league in 1995 and 1996; the LINFUNA was officially recognised by FIFA. [23] This includes titles won before the inauguration of the nationwide league in 1959; since then, Fenerbahçe won 19 of their 28 titles, Galatasaray 24 (a record) of their 25 and Besiktas 14 of their 21. [24] This includes the two titles won in the Namibia National Soccer League, played between 1985 and 1990, before independence. [25] This includes titles won in the national league (LINAFOOT) in 1990, 1991, and since 1998, and those in the knock-out tournaments organised in other years (Coupe du Zaïre; known as Coupe du Congo 1964-1971 and Challenge Papa Kalala 1982-1989); TP Mazembe won the LINAFOOT title 15 times (and 5 cup tournaments), AS Vita Club won the LINAFOOT 5 times (and 10 cup tournaments) and DC Motema Pembe the LINAFOOT 5 times (and 6 cup tournaments); the titles of 1969 (Mazembe) and 1970 (Vita Club) are included although the relevant tournaments were not completed (like that of 2019/20 won by Mazembe). [26] Championships in the Dutch East Indies refer to wins in the Java city competitions held between 1914 and 1950; the V.B.O. was known as W.J.V.B. until 1928 and was dissolved in 1951, while the S.V.B. merged into Persibaja in the summer of 1950 (with all first level clubs in the S.V.B. keeping their place under the new name); they thus might be considered a predecessor of Persebaya, winners of 4 amateur and 2 professional championships in independent Indonesia. [27] The total for Crvena zvezda includes their 18 championships of former Yugoslavia until 1991, their 16 league titles in Serbia (and Montenegro) won since the 1991/92 season, and the 1945/46 title of Serbia won in a regional qualification tournament for the Yugoslav championship and recognised by the FA of Serbia in May 2019 (!). [28] Totals for Tunisia include titles won before independence from France; Espérance won 1 of their 33 titles during the colonial era, Club Africain 2 of their 13, Etoile du Sahel 1 of their 11. [29] Totals for Morocco include titles won before independence from France; WAC Casablanca won 5 of their 22 titles during the colonial era, US Marocaine (dissolved after independence) all their 16 titles. [30] Totals for Bolivia only includes titles won since 1958 in the Torneo Nacional; Bolívar also won 2 titles in the semiprofessional league of La Paz (1950-1953) and 1 title in the Torneo Integrado (1954-1957), The Strongest 1 in the league of La Paz (1950-1953) and Jorge Wilstermann the Certamen Nacional Mixto 1957/58; these are not included in the totals here. [31] Totals for Brazil include Taça do Brasil, Taça Roberto Gomes de Pedrosa, and official CBF/CBD championships since 1971. [32] Mindelense won 13 titles since independence (1975) and 6 before; Sporting Praia won 10 titles since independence and 2 before; the federation of Cape Verde only considers the titles won since 1975 as official. [33] While the company owning Rangers FC was liquidated in 2012, it had previously sold the club to another company, thus enabling the club, which had to restart at the fourth domestic league level, to retain its old records. [34] FC Steaua were forced to changed name to FCSB in 2017 due to a number of court cases with omnisports club CSA Steaua, of which the football section had been part until 1998; the 6 titles won by the club since 2003, when it had been taken over by a private owner, are disputed by the former army omnisports club but this is not considered here as the club has played at the top level without interruption since 1947, albeit under various names.\n\nNegative Champions\n\nIn the Swedish Championship of 1998, the champions, AIK scored fewer goals than all other 13 teams: 25 in 26 matches (average 0.962).\n\nWhile this was, as far as is known, unique up to the 2009/10 season (see the story on Aduana Stars below), it is not the lowest number of goals per game for a championship winning side. In Europe, that 'honour' probably goes to Trabzonspor K, who won the 1979/80 Turkish championship by scoring a mere 25 goals in 30 matches (an average of 0.833; only 3 of the other 16 clubs did worse).\n\nWhile Trabzonspor may hold the European record, the world record was probably set by Aduana Stars, who won the 2009/10 Ghanaian league by scoring only 19 goals in 30 matches, an average of 0.633 - by far the worst scoring record of any side in the 16-team league (the next lowest scoring club were Bechem Chelsea with 26; relegated side Eleven Wise scored twice as many as the champions). Another curiosity of Aduana's title was that they were a newly promoted club, making their debut season; they were the first such club to win the championship in Ghana.\n\nTrabzonspor's record was marginally worse than that of 2000/01 Senegal champions Jeanne d'Arc, who scored 22 goals in 26 matches (an average of 0.846). However, unlike AIK, Trabzonspor and Aduana Stars, they were among the most prolific sides in the league; only ASC Ndiambour scored one more goal (and ASC Diaraf also had 22) in a league in which all clubs scored less than one goal a match and all clubs conceded less than one goal per match (the worst defence being that of relegated Casa Sport who conceded 25 goals in their 26 outings). With only 221 goals scored in 182 matches, an average of 1.214 goals per match, presumed to be a world record low for a truly national league, the 2000/01 edition of the Senegalese championship set rather unenviable standards in negative football, although the 1991/92 season (in which 301 goals were scored in 240 matches, an average of 1.254) saw a champion, ASC Ndiambour, with an even lower number of goals (20, and that in 30 matches, an average of 0.667 (presumably the world record low for a championship winning team until Aduana Stars came along) - 6 from the 15 other clubs scored more, but only Diaraf (31 goals) managed an average above one).\n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that the 1991 Calcutta League, with 107 goals in 90 matches (an average of 1.189 goals per match) did even better defensively (seventy percent of the clubs scored less than half a goal per match and the top-2 teams together conceded only 1 goal in their 36 matches); as there was no national league championship in India at the time and the Calcutta league traditionally was considered to be the strongest of the country, one might discharge the West Africans.\n\nDue to the rather irrational format of the competition, Coritiba FC won the Brazilian championship of 1985 by scoring 25 goals in 29 matches, and conceding 27 - one of only six known cases of a national champion with a negative goal difference. They did win more matches than they lost (12 wins, 7 draws, 10 losses) but the number of goals they scored per match (0.862) was worse than that of all but 5 of the 43 other participating clubs.\n\nAl-Rayyan is another known team to win its national championship with a negative goal difference: in the 1983/84 Qatar league, they managed to win 7 (and draw 2) of their 12 matches by scoring 15 goals - and conceding 18, most of those undoubtedly in their 3 defeats.\n\nWalter Ferreti won the 2000/01 Nicaraguan championship, which was played in three stages. The first was a double round robin between 10 teams, of which the top-5 qualified for the second stage. Walter Ferreti finished 5th with 7 wins, 5 draws, 6 losses and a goal record of 30 scored and 27 conceded. The top-5 then played another double round robin, in which Walter Ferreti only managed 2 wins, 2 draws and 4 losses, scoring 7 goals and conceding 17. However, that gave them 4th place (FC San Marcos doing even worse), which was enough to enter the knock-out semi-finals - in spite of their overall record (by then) of 9 wins, 7 draws, 10 losses, 37 goals scored and 44 conceded. There they eliminated second stage winners Jalapa with a 3-1 home win after drawing 0-0 away, and in the final they managed two 0-0 draws against first stage winners (and second stage runners-up) Diriangén before winning the necessary penalty shoot-out 5-3 and crowning themselves national champions - with a total record of 10 wins, 10 draws, 10 losses, 40 goals scored and 45 conceded!\n\nHowever, the worst ever national league champions must be POSCO Atoms, champions of South Korea 1986. After winning the first stage with 3 wins, 6 draws and 1 loss from 10 matches (9 goals scored, 5 conceded), they finished 5th from 6 in the second stage with 2 wins, 2 draws and 6 losses (9 goals scored, 18 conceded). They nevertheless had qualified for the championship play-off against second stage winners Lucky Goldstar Hwangso (who had been close runners-up in the first stage), won the first leg 1-0 and drew the second 1-1 to claim the league title with an overall record of 22 matches, 6 wins, 9 draws, 7 losses, 20 goals scored and 24 conceded!\n\nBut POSCO were run close by CD Plaza Amador in Panama 2005, where they won the Torneo ANAPROF with an overall season record of 13 wins, 11 draws and 14 losses, 51 goals scored and 55 conceded. Plaza Amador had won the Apertura after finishing fourth in its regular stage (8 wins, 6 draws, 4 losses, 28-19 goals) and then winning their semifinal against Tauro (1-0 on aggregate) and the final against Árabe Unido 3-1. In the Clausura they completely lost the plot, finishing 9th and last with 2 wins, 4 draws and 10 losses (17-35 goals). But Clausura champions San Francisco, who had also been the best team overall, succumbed 0-2 in the Superfinal... (To illustrate their 'negative' season, Plaza Amador received 9 yellow cards (two players receiving two and so a red) and 1 direct red card during the championship final.)\n\nFinally, Taipower won the championship of Taiwan 2007 conceding 11 goals and scoring only 9 in their six matches: they lost only once, but then heavily, 0-5 to Fubon, while all their three wins were by a single goal.\n\nTo summarise the 6 'negative' champions:\n\nOutscored Champions Country Season Champions Pd W D L F-A Pts Qatar 1983/84 Al-Rayyan 12 7 2 3 15-18 16 Brazil 1985 Coritiba 29 12 7 10 25-27 31 South Korea 1986 POSCO Atoms 22 6 9 7 20-24 21 Nicaragua 2000/01 Walter Ferreti 30 10 10 10 40-45 40 Panama 2005 Plaza Amador 38 13 11 14 51-55 50 Taiwan 2007 Taipower 6 3 2 1 9-11 11 Outmatched Champions Country Season Champions Pd W D L F-A Pts South Korea 1986 POSCO Atoms 22 6 9 7 20-24 21 Panama 2005 Plaza Amador 38 13 11 14 51-55 50\n\nAt the other end of the table, Manchester City managed something remarkably dual to AIK's and Aduana's achievement: while scoring most goals (80) of all 22 teams in the 1937/38 English Championship, they finished 21st and were relegated with a positive goal difference (80-77). What made this even more striking was that they were defending champions when relegated.\n\nSee for the best defensive performances in European leagues.\n\nNew Names on the Trophy\n\nIn many countries, the same old teams keep winning championships, often several on a string, as documented above.\n\nIt is less often that every year another team wins the title. The longest series of seasons in which no club won the title twice are listed below. Series with the seasons indicated in italics involved no two teams from the same town; series with the country in italics are running.\n\n11 Indonesia 1991/92-2003 (1991/92 Arseto, 1992/93 Arema, 1993/94 Pelita Jaya, 1994/95 Persib, 1995/96 Mastrans Bandung Raya, 1996/97 Persebaya, 1997/98 not awarded, 1998/99 PSIS, 1999/00 PSM, 2001 Persija, 2002 Petrokimia Putra, 2003 Persik) 11 Netherlands 1942/43-1953/54 (1942/43 ADO, 1943/44 De Voleweĳckers, 1944/45 not held, 1945/46 Haarlem, 1946/47 Ajax, 1947/48 BVV, 1948/49 SVV, 1949/50 Limburgia, 1950/51 PSV, 1951/52 Willem II, 1952/53 RCH, 1953/54 Eindhoven) 10 Laos 2006 -2016 (2006 Vientiane FC, 2007 Lao-American College FC, 2008 Lao Army FC, 2009 not held, 2010 Banks, 2011 Ministry of Public Works and Transport, 2012 Lao Police FC, 2013 SHB Champasak FC, 2014 Hoang Anh Attapeu FC, 2015 Lao Toyota FC. 2016 Lanexang United FC) 10 N.
