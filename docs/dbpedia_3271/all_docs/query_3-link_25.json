You will also receive an email and/or text message (if opted in for text messaging) regarding any changes to your individual game as soon as ISL is notified and able to communicate with you\n\nCoaches/Managers: For games that are affected due to weather or field conditions, every effort will be made to reschedule (move) the games on the original date to avoid cancelling the game. In the event that Indiana Soccer cancels a game, teams need to communicate with each other to come up with a rescheduled date/time and/or location and submit this change via a support ticket.

Only pay the referees who are in attendance. If one referee does not show, the teams keep that referee’s fee. If the game does not start due to weather and is not played, the referees do not get paid. If the game begins but is called because of weather, the referees keep their fees. Referees are to be paid prior to kick off."
