        "text": "State Championships\n\nAs regards the championships, the state championships were founded in a period from the 1900's to 1993. The earliest was the Paulista State in 1902 (Sao Paolo having most of the early teams), and most of the more established clubs are from states with leagues dating from, at the latest, the '20's. There was a rash of foundations during the second world war (most probably to formation of new states, but I'm not 100% on that) and a few more recent ones from the newest states carved out of the Amazon, the most recent being the Campeonato Tocantinense. These state championships were originally the pinnacle of Brazilian club football, and even now are the primary means of qualification fro the Brazilian Cup. They are organised in a variety of ways, but most have a knockout playoff to decide the winner after the league stage.\n\nThey can be annoying but if you're in a state with only a few top teams (e.g. Internacional or Gremio in the Gaucho) they are ideal in the game for developing young prospects, though you'll need a large squad as games are Saturday-Wednesday.\n\nIn real life I've read the main reason for their continued existance is the power of the state associations in the CBF and in reality the Campeonato Paulista is the only one with the financial power to make a fully compeditive (good quality) league possible. The rest are usually one or two big leagues dominating tiny teams, or a group of tiny teams. Season is January to May.\n\nCampeonato Serie A\n\nThe national league has been running since 1959, and has had many different formats since then, including not having two successive years using the same format from 1971 to 2003. There have been legal battles galore over winners and relegation and rules have been known to change mid-season to keep major clubs in the top division (I believe it happened for Fluminese back in the '80's or '90's). However that changed in 2003 when the CBF, in an unusual step of actually doing something to help the game, formalised the championship mostly along the lines of every other national championship. Despite some minor differences with placing rules the league is now virtually indistinguishable from it's European counterparts, except that it is usually far more compeditive than anywhere else. Season is May to December.\n\nNB The Serie B follows the same format, while the Serie C is broken up into 5 smaller regional groupings with a end of season play-off.\n\nCopa do Brasil\n\nThe youngest of the major Brazilian competitions (founded in 1989), the cup is a straight 64 team two-legged knockout competition. Qualification is from the 10 best teams in the CBF rankings from the last season (i.e. the top ten league teams who didn't qualify otherwise) and from 1 to 3 teams from each state league (depending on size). There is an unusual rule which means it is impossible to win the cup back to back. The cup winner qualifies for the Copa Libertadores which means they do not enter the cup and so a new team will always appear on the trophy each year. Season is January to June\n\nAnother distinguishing feature is that in the first two rounds if the away team (always the higher division one) wins by 2 goals or more in the first leg no second leg is played (partly to keep costs for some of the tiny clubs who play in it down, and partly to ease the fixture log).\n\nCopa Libertadores\n\nThe Libertadores is the equivalent of the Champions League with multiple entrants from leagues in COMNEBOL and Mexico (who were invited since 2004). 38 teams enter. The format is similar with a pre-qualification knockout stage to weed out the weakest teams, and then divided into 8 groups of four top two qualifying to the knock-out stages. It's been in the running since 1960 only five years younger than the original European Cup. While money is not as easy to come by out of this competition the prestige of winning it is at a similar level and of course it virtually guarantees your club a place in the WCC final if you win it. Season is February to June (usually).\n\nCopa Sudamericana\n\nThe equivalent of the Europa League, the format here is not as convoluted as it is a straight knockout and there are no loser qualifiers coming in at a late stage from the bigger tournament. As with the Copa do Brasil it is a new entry merging the Copa Mecursor (based around a trading block), the Copa Merconorte (the countries not in the trading bloc) and the Copa COMNEBOL into one competition in 2002. 39 teams enter so there are three rounds before you see all the competing teams play, but as it is a straight knock out the most you'll play here is 14 games. Season is from June to December (Wiki is not certain on this).\n\nSo as you can see Brazil has you playing all year around with only a 3 week break in December, and if you're from a smaller state a few weeks in April (between the state and national championships), giving a very busy season of up to 70 games.\n\nMy advice is to try for a large first team squad. In European leagues I hover between 20 and 25 players (with youth back-up), but in Brazil I often aim for closer to 30 (the worse of them dropping to the reserves for long periods). Wages will be hard to maintain early on especially if you have a big name with a contract due, mainly because of European sharks, but negotiations will often reach a good compromise. The first season will be difficult financially as all clubs are at best Secure (mostly OK) meaning about £5m to play with total. But sponsorship money and club memberships will pull in bigger amounts than most European clubs and you can always sell the crown jewels for big money.\n\nLosing the state championship can get you sacked so aim for the final at least if you're a big club and whatever the board want if you're small. The cup can be ignored unless you're a mid table team and get a favourable early draw.\n\nThere will be opportunities to bring back mid-level Brazilian players from Europe (though in early seasons you may not have the money to sign them, and definitely scout them), and there will be a large number of players at your club on loan (if they are worse than your team ship them back). There are also a suprisingly large number of good solid players, both young and old, playing for smaller clubs so get your scouts out early and often, and you might find some diamonds in the rough.\n\nTransfer windows\n\nFirst: January to Apri, domestic and foreign.\n\nSecond: December to next January, domestic and foreign.\n\nThird: January to September, domestic only.\n\nNB The Bosman rule of contract is not used in Brazil so if you are looking for players out of contract scout them beforehand as you may lose out to the computer."
