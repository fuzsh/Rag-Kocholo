        "text": "The revelation that Cristiano Ronaldo has surpassed Josef Bican to become the all-time top goalscorer according to FIFA, with 806 goals, throws up several questions.\n\nAmong these are “Which type of goals count?”, “Who on earth is Josef Bican?”, “Didn’t Pele score more than 1,000?” and “Does anyone actually care?” Here are the answers to a few of those — although you’ll have to answer the last one for yourself.\n\nLet’s start with Pele. In recent years, his goalscoring record has come to be mocked for various reasons, in part because his figure of 1,279 includes matches scored in youth matches, state competition matches and friendlies.\n\nBut there are three important points here.\n\nFirst, few of those goals were scored in youth competitions. It’s worth remembering that Pele was playing in Santos’ first team by the age of 15 and for Brazil by the age of 17.\n\nSecond, although the concept of “state competitions” in Brazil sounds somewhat minor, as if equivalent to England being broken down into counties, the reality is very different.\n\nThe state football competitions saw Brazilian football broken down into four regions — and, considering that Brazil won three of the four World Cups during Pele’s international career, and was the most populous footballing nation, it’s hardly unreasonable to think that there was enough footballing talent in the country for these to be competitive leagues.\n\nThird, the concept of “friendlies” was, in the 1960s, somewhat different from today. Pele was the world’s greatest player, Santos were often regarded as the world’s greatest side, and those tour matches of Europe and Africa were taken extremely seriously by Santos and their opponents.\n\nFor example, in Athens in 1961, Olympiakos defeated Pele’s Santos 2-1 — the Brazilian side’s first loss in a 13-game European tour. It is considered a victory of such importance that it features in the club anthem: “Everyone trembles at the very sound of your name / Pele and Santos still remember your name”, it proclaims. This is a club boasting 46 league titles and 28 Greek Cups, yet a victory in a “friendly” remains its most celebrated win.\n\nSome of the most famous matches of this era were friendlies — take Hungary’s win over England at Wembley in 1953, or Wolverhampton Wanderers’ famous 3-2 victory over Honved a year later.\n\nIt’s not unreasonable for Pele to count those goals. Equally, since club friendlies in the modern era aren’t considered so prestigious, it would seem less understandable if Ronaldo or Lionel Messi’s goals in those games counted, and therefore for consistency, none are counted in “official” records. That’s all fair enough but it’s not like Pele is attempting to claim goals scored in his back garden.\n\nIt’s also worth questioning why it is universally accepted that goals in international friendlies do count, but goals in club friendlies do not. Many of Pele’s goals in club friendlies will have been scored in much more competitive situations than, for example, Ronaldo’s friendly goals against Andorra, Luxembourg and Estonia.\n\nIt broadly seems a reasonable compromise to count goals scored against international players regardless of the nature of the fixture, but it’s an example of how formulating “the rules” is trickier than it might appear.\n\nThat brings us onto Bican, whose statistics are clearly outstanding, and who was certainly a top-class footballer. He scored 14 goals in 19 caps for Austria, including one as he helped his home country reach the semi-finals of World Cup 1934, then 12 in 14 for Czechoslavakia. Various top European clubs, including Juventus, wanted to sign him.\n\nHis overall goals total, though, is questionable. Beyond considering whether the Czechoslovak league in the 1940s was played at a particularly high level, the key factor here is that Bican’s most prolific campaigns came throughout the Second World War. Therefore he wasn’t actually playing in the usual Czechoslovak league but in the top flight of the Nazi Germany-annexed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Furthermore, many of Bican’s contemporaries stopped playing football during this period because they were at war.\n\nIt would be unfair to overlook Bican’s goalscoring achievements purely because his country of residence was invaded but it’s also fair to assess his tally of 297 in 143 games between 1939 and 1944, and question the standard of football. He also scored 97 goals in 43 games during two spells in the second tier. Bican’s goalscoring record was barely acknowledged until Pele hit 1,000 goals, when historians attempted to find someone who could rival that figure.\n\nIt seems odd to celebrate Bican’s goalscoring in such grand terms considering his relatively modest reputation in the game. When World Soccer magazine compiled its list of the 100 best players of the 20th Century, he didn’t make the list.\n\nThen again, it’s worth considering that, although Bican’s goalscoring tally was inflated because of the war, his reputation was surely diminished because of it. Had he been able to move to a major European league, or played in a World Cup in 1942 or 1946, perhaps his standing would be much greater.\n\nThe same can be said of the Hungarian Ferenc Deak, eighth on the all-time list, who also scored the majority of his goals during the Second World War. Ferenc Puskas, in sixth place, was unquestionably one of the all-time greats, although once again, his most prolific seasons came during the war.\n\nA more debatable case is the man in joint-ninth place, Tulio Maravilha. He was born in 1969, the year Pele scored his 1,000th goal, and seemed to consider it his destiny to replicate his achievement of reaching the same figure. Tulio claims he did so — although, as with Pele, his tally includes goals scored in unofficial games.\n\nStill, in an astonishing career that lasted from 1988 to 2019 and included 13 goals in 15 Brazil caps in the early 1990s, Tulio finished as his league’s top goalscorer six times: three in the top flight, once in the second tier and twice in the third tier. He is the all-time leading goalscorer for Goias and Vila Nova. And although many of his 575 official goals came outside the Brazilian top flight, records from the 1990s and 2000s are more trustworthy than those from decades ago.\n\nBut the battle to be crowned football’s greatest ever goalscorer surely comes down to Ronaldo, Romario, Messi, Pele, Puskas, Gerd Muller and Uwe Seeler — all-time greats. Few of their records are completely beyond scrutiny.\n\nMuller’s Bundesliga record is astounding, but should it include the 47 goals he hit in 28 games in one season for TSV 1861 Nordlingen, in the Bezirksliga Schwaben, which was then the fifth tier of German football?\n\nSeeler’s tally is largely legitimate, although it’s worth pointing out the Bundesliga was only formed in 1963, midway through his career. Until then, West Germany was split into northern and southern sections. Seeler scored 324 goals in nine seasons in the old system, and then only 167 goals in another nine seasons in the new system, which demonstrates how comparisons to players before and after becomes difficult.\n\nRomario, like Pele, claims to have reached 1,000 although his official tally is 772. This tally is — aside from the usual complaints about Brazil’s state system — phenomenal and largely watertight. From 1985 to 2005 Romario was playing in top divisions. Even his 19 goals for Miami FC in 2006 came in the second tier of US Soccer.\n\nAnother name might be in contention soon. Robert Lewandowski has 533 club goals level and 74 at full international level, making a total of 607, although the “official” total appears somewhat lower. It’s not quite clear where the discrepancy comes from. It’s debatable whether Lewandowski’s six from two games in the Polish seventh tier is worthy of consideration, or indeed four in the fourth tier, and 17 in the third tier.\n\nThen again, what of the current Bundesliga, which Bayern are likely to win for a 10th time in a row? It’s that lack of competitiveness that has allowed Lewandowski to record astonishing statistics like the 41 he scored last season.\n\nFor comparison, between 1988 and 2003, the top goalscorer in the Bundesliga never managed more than 23. Lewandowski is clearly an all-time great, but there’s also been a dramatic change in the inequality of leagues, which makes comparisons to 20 years ago difficult, never mind comparisons to 80 years ago.\n\nAnd, in truth, the more you delve into the specifics of goalscoring records, the more you realise that numbers are all compromised in some form, and the comparisons across eras don’t really make sense.\n\nThat said, depressingly for those who have grown tired of this particular comparison, is that it’s difficult to make a case for why you can’t compare the records of Messi and Ronaldo. They’ve played in the same era, always in top European leagues (and for nine years with clubs of similar stature in the same division) and for countries of similar standing.\n\nMost goalscoring comparisons don’t work — but there’s no getting away from that one.\n\n(Photos: Getty Images)"
