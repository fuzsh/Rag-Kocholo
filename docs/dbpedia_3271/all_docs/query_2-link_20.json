        "text": "Soccer fans around the world just enjoyed thrilling Copa América and Euro finals on FOX and the FOX Sports app, but the fun isn't stopping any time soon, as futbol never sleeps!\n\nBettors and fans already have their sights set on the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America.\n\nAfter Spain defeated England to win the UEFA Euro 2024, its odds of winning the World Cup shifted drastically, moving to +600 from +900 overnight. Spain is now tied with France and Brazil as co-favorites to win it all in 2026.\n\nAnother big winner on Sunday was Argentina, who got past Colombia to claim the Copa América trophy. The team's odds also improved slightly, moving to +800 from +900.\n\nThe World Cup final will be held at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.\n\nLet's dive into the odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\n2026 WORLD CUP ODDS: *\n\nFrance: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)\n\nSpain: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)\n\nBrazil: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)\n\nEngland: +650 (bet $10 to win $75 total)\n\nArgentina: +800 (bet $10 to win $90 total)\n\nGermany: +1000 (bet $10 to win $110 total)\n\nPortugal:+1400 (bet $10 to win $150 total)\n\nNetherlands: +1600 (bet $10 to win $170 total)\n\nItaly: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210 total)\n\nUruguay: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210 total)\n\nColombia: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)\n\nUnited States: +3000 (bet $10 to win $310 total)\n\nBelgium: +3000 (bet $10 to win $310 total)\n\nCroatia: +5000 (bet $10 to win $510 total)\n\nDenmark: +6500 (bet $10 to win $660 total)\n\nMexico: +6500 (bet $10 to win $660 total)\n\n* odds as of 7/15/24\n\nOn the USMNT side, the team's poor showing this summer has left fans wondering if the next big tournament will yield a more favorable outcome.\n\nSince the Group Stage was introduced in 1975, the United States is the first host nation to fail to reach the Copa América knockout stage.\n\nAs a result of the team's disappointing showing in Copa América, Gregg Berhalter is now out as the USMNT head coach.\n\nAdditionally, the team's current odds to win the World Cup moved to +3000 from +2500 after getting ousted at Copa and Berhalter's dismissal.\n\nIn the wake of his firing, U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker put emphasis on targeting a 'serial winning coach' to replace Berhalter.\n\n\"Winning is the yardstick, and we didn't do that,\" Crocker said.\n\n\"We are looking for a serial winning coach and a coach that can also build on the work that has already been put in place. Clearly, there's still a lot of potential in the group and we have to turn out the performance and results, so that's what I'll be looking for and that'll be my absolute No. 1 priority.\n\nIn February, FIFA released the dates and locations for the 104-match tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe US Men's National Team has group stage matches:\n\n– June 12, SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, California\n\n– June 19, Lumen Field, Seattle\n\n– June 25, SoFi Stadium\n\nThe semifinals will be at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on July 14 and at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on July 15.\n\nUnited States eliminated from Copa América: Carli Lloyd & Alexi Lalas react\n\nFrance is a co-favorite on the board at +600. Les Bleus were one of the youngest teams at the 2022 tournament and boast the best young star in the game in Kylian Mbappe. When you factor in that they had numerous key players out for injury in 2022, it's no surprise that they are now near the top of the board.\n\nBrazil is the third co-favorite to take home the Cup, on top of the oddsboard at +600 to win it all. After being derailed by injuries in 2014, 2018 and 2022, Neymar will be focused on his own Messi-like mid-30s redemption story. Or will he? Neymar himself said his national team future is cloudy. Either way, The Seleção will be loaded, but they need their younger talent to step up to get back on the podium.\n\nDefending champion Argentina is fifth on the oddsboard at +800.\n\nStar Lionel Messi, after moving to MLS to play for Inter Miami, has not committed to playing in 2026. He did suffer an injury during Argentina's win over Colombia in the Copa América final. Will that cloud his 2026 World Cup status is even further?\n\nLa Albiceleste will return young talent such as Julián Álvarez and Enzo Fernández, so with or without La Pulga, Argentina will still be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe USMNT at +3000 has long odds but a few things are working in their favor. Wales, England and Brazil were played to draws this year, and the Americans will have home-field advantage for the first time since 1994."
