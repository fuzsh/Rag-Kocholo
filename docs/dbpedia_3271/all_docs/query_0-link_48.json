In this article, we embark on a thrilling exploration of these football mavericks as they fearlessly rewrite the Guinness World Records, pushing the boundaries of what we didn't think was possible and leaving an indelible legacy that echoes through the ages.\n\n5. Neymar - 4\n\n'Neymar' is one of the best forwards in modern-day football. The Brazilian has achieved a lot of fame, played at two of the best football clubs in the world, and achieved paramount success in his career. The achievements of the 31-year-old have made people compare him with the legendary Pele.\n\nWhen PSG wanted to acquire the services of Neymar from Barcelona, they had to shell out a hefty fee of €222 million (his release clause). This transfer made him the most expensive footballer in transfer history and set the Guinness World Record. This mammoth amount was more than double the then-most expensive transfer of Paul Pogba (€105) from Juventus to Manchester United.\n\nNeymar set the record for the fastest goal in Olympic history during Brazil's semifinal match against Honduras at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The youngster snatched the ball off a Honduran defender and found the back of the net in just 14 seconds. Before Neymar's goal against Honduras, the Guinness record for the fastest goal in Olympic history was held by Mexico’s Oribe Peralta.\n\n4.

He is undoubtedly one of the best number nines of all time.

The Pole only joined proceedings at halftime against Wolfsburg but still managed to find the net five times, all in a ridiculous eight minutes and 59 seconds.\n\n2. Cristiano Ronaldo - 40\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's achievement of 200 international caps for Portugal has been recognised by Guinness World Records.

As a tribute to his accomplishment, Ronaldo was presented with a formal certificate by Guinness World Records as a new official record holder.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar recently won the award for the highest-paid athlete in a year. Cristiano earned $136 million in 2023.\n\nAli Daei’s 17-year reign as the all-time leading goalscorer in men’s international football was broken by Ronaldo when he surpassed Ali's 109-goal haul. He did so in style by saving his best for last in a World Cup qualifier against Ireland. He fired in two late headers to seal a dramatic 2-1 comeback win.\n\n134 goals in 175 Champions League games is the best record of any player in the competition’s history.

It also saw him become the first Portuguese player in history to score in four consecutive World Cups. In that same game against Spain, Ronaldo also equalled the record for the most World Cups scored in. He has scored in four different editions of the tournament for Portugal (2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018).\n\nAside from winning the Euro 2020 Golden Boot with five goals this summer, Ronaldo surpassed Michel Platini as the all-time top goal scorer of the European Championship.

However, the Argentine veteran pulled away significantly from the pack by earning the individual accolade in five separate games at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including the final.\n\nThe then-Barcelona star was 24 years old when he scored his 50th goal in the UEFA Champions League. He became the youngest player in the competition to reach the milestone. Messi is the most featured footballer on video game covers across multiple franchises, including the FIFA series from EA Sports and the PES game series from Konami.
