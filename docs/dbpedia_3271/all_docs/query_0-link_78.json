        "text": "Shreveport-Bossier used to be a sports town. At one point, we had pro teams for football, baseball, hockey...it's was pretty crazy. But, then teams started leaving or going out of business. The Texas League version of the Shreveport Captains left in 2002. They were replaced by the independent league Sports/Captains - However, they were sold and moved in 2011.\n\nWe had pro football in the form of Arena Football with the Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings - who started up in 2001 and ultimately left in 2010.\n\nThen there was the Mudbugs Hockey team, who were around in pro form from 1997 to 2011. Thankfully, the Mudbugs did came back as a junior hockey team in 2016. Since their return, they've won two championships - 2018 and 2021. And most of the season, they draw some of the biggest crowds in the NAHL, which is awesome to see.\n\nAnd these are just the recent sports teams. You could dive into the Shreveport Braves or the Shreveport Steamers or any number of other teams that used to call our city home.\n\nWith that said, it sounds like we can add another professional league to the list of teams that call Shreveport home. Because, from the sounds of it, pro football is back in Shreveport.\n\nWho are the Shreveport Rouxgaroux?\n\nThe Shreveport Mudbugs recently shared a post on Facebook stating that George's Pond would now also be home to the Shreveport Rouxgaroux. But, who and what are the Shreveport Rouxgaroux?\n\nWell, not a lot of information is known. But according to their Facebook page, they will be a professional arena football team. Here's the description on their social media page:\n\nAfter a decade absence it is with great pleasure that we present to you the Shreveport Rouxgaroux. The sport of indoor football brings a world of excitement entertainment, first-rate professional football to the Shreveport-Bossier city area.\n\nWhat League Will Shreveport Play In?\n\nAgain, details are sparse at the moment and more are expected to be announced soon.\n\nBut one of the recent posts on the Rouxgaroux Facebook page was about the NAL - National Arena League - Owner's Meeting. And that would make sense. The league was founded in 2016 and seems to be ever-expanding. In fact, on July 9th this year, they announced new teams including Columbus, Harrisburg and Corpus Christi.\n\nSo, could an official announcement be coming soon? Only time will tell. You can read more about the League's history here.\n\nRegardless, pro sports of any kind in Shreveport-Bossier is a good thing. Plus, it's an added bonus they have a cool name and logo. I know I for one want a jersey already."
