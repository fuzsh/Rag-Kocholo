        "text": "Steve Kragthorpe, who spent three seasons as head football coach at Louisville from 2007-09, has died at age 59, the school confirmed Monday.\n\nKragthorpe passed away after a yearslong battle with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe longtime college coach led Tulsa for four seasons before spending three at U of L. His went 29-22 at Tulsa and 15-21 at Louisville in his only two head coaching stops.\n\nKragthorpe led the Cardinals to records of 6-6, 5-7 and 4-8 before being fired by then-athletics director Tom Jurich after the 2009 season with two years remaining on his contract.\n\nKragthorpe lost all three of his games in U of L’s annual series against archrival Kentucky, falling 40-34 in 2007, 27-2 in 2008 and 31-27 in 2009.\n\nAfter a year away from football, Kragthorpe resurfaced as offensive coordinator at LSU ahead of the 2011 season but decided to step down before coaching a game after receiving his Parkinson’s diagnosis. Kragthorpe remained with LSU for several years in an off-the-field role.\n\nPrior to his college head coaching positions, Kragthorpe served as quarterbacks coach with the NFL’s Buffalo Bills and offensive coordinator at Texas A&M among other stops. A native of Missoula, Montana, Kragthorpe played quarterback in college for Eastern New Mexico and West Texas State.\n\nKentucky and Louisville football not in coaches’ top 25, but Cards’ lead on Cats is wide\n\nPat Kelsey is off to a fast start with Louisville basketball. What will recruiting look like?\n\n‘The end of the beginning.’ Louisville men’s basketball completes sweep in Bahamas."
