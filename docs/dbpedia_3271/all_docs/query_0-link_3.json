        "text": "The Brazilian football federation have just announced that Dorival Júnior will be the new manager of their men’s national team. The 61 year-old is originally from Araraquara in the state of São Paulo.\n\nJust days ago Brazil parted ways with interim boss Fernando Diniz and wasted very little time in naming Dorival Júnior as his successor, but who is the new man on the touchline for the Seleção?\n\nDorival Júnior is what you call a ‘journeyman’ in football terms, someone who, as a player or a coach, bounces from club to club as opposed to spending a long time in one particular place.\n\nLast week Dorival may have been the coach of São Paulo, where he won the 2023 Brazilian Cup, but now he will look forward to leading his country to the 2024 Copa America in the United States this summer.\n\nDorival Júnior has coached Brazilian club giants like Flamengo, Fluminense and Santos too. In fact he led Flamengo to continental glory by winning the 2022 Copa Libertadores. He won the 2010 Brazilian Cup and state league with Santos and the year before that he had been at Vasco da Gama, helping them to earn a Brazilian Serie B title.\n\nDespite obvious successes as a coach Dorival has not kept a job for more than two years, and in the last 20 years he has led well over a dozen different clubs in Brazil, with some spells going a lot better than others.\n\nDorival’s coaching history demonstrates an ability to adapt well to new players and teams, though he prefers a fast and relatively direct attacking style with the full-backs pushing on he works well with the tools that he has at any given time, not favouring one particular system of play.\n\nOne of Dorivals most exciting periods as a manager came with Santos, first in 2009 and 2010 and then again during a second spell from 2015 to 2017. Despite success in his first period with the club he was eventually sacked for a row with Neymar Jr.\n\nBrazil will hope that the pair are getting along better now that Dorival is the national team coach; but the reality is Neymar Jr’s current injury means he won’t be a part of the national team squad anytime soon.\n\nDorival’s second spell at Santos between 2015 and 2017 was the only single managerial spell where he led a club for over 100 games. He won another state championship with the club but was eventually sacked for a second time after a run of poor form.\n\nDorival had a career as a player in Brazil during the 1980’s and 90’s but never made it near the national team squad. Now he has the fate of the world's most successful football nation in his hands and with the Copa America coming up there is little room for failure.\n\nFernando Diniz, who was sacked from the Brazil job last week, only lasted six games in the job as interim manager. The man who has just led Fluminense to a Copa Libertadores title has a mighty reputation, but the results simply have not been there. Harsh or not, the Brazilian national team has to win games and Diniz managed just two wins from six at the helm.\n\nThe managerial move from Brazil has also come in the wake of Carlo Ancelotti’s new Real Madrid contract. The Italian was highly rumoured to be taking over the Brazil job himself, perhaps after his contract finished with Real in 2024. However it seems that his new contract extension with Madrid finally prompted Brazil’s federation to go for a different option and they have not hesitated in naming their man.\n\nAt the moment Brazil have only officially announced one game in March before they play the Copa America in June. That will be a friendly against England at Wembley stadium. Of course the five-time World Cup winners will announce some more pre-tournament friendlies in the coming months, but Dorival will have very limited time with his squad before the competitive football starts.\n\nShort stints and the odd success are what Dorival has made a managerial career out of. Perhaps this rogue move from Brazil will be seen as a stroke of genius if they get their hands on silverware in the USA this summer. If not, it will be another year of frustration for a team and nation hungry for trophies having won just one Copa America title in the last 16 years.\n\nDorival has signed a contract through to 2026. It should see him lead the Brazil national team to the next World Cup. However first they will have to qualify and secondly; if performances and results are not convincing enough in the two years inbetween the federation won’t hesitate to find a new coach for the Seleção. Dorival will need his top players in top form and a nice slice of luck along the way."
