        "text": "I know that some referees use Ibuprofen or other over the counter NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) before their matches. I have always shied away as I always thought it would be better to know if I had been injured than to have the medicine mask the pain only to find later I had aggravated a minor injury into something serious by not stopping my activities immediately.\n\nIf you take NSAIDs of any kind prior to your matches, you should really read up on the latest research on the topic.\n\nI just read a New York times article that says the latest research shows that NSAIDs AREN'T masking the pain during athletic activity and they make the recovery time longer.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nibuprofen users displayed significantly more inflammation and other markers of high immune system response afterward than the runners who hadn’t taken anti-inflammatories. The ibuprofen users also showed signs of mild kidney impairment and, both before and after the race, of low-level endotoxemia, a condition in which bacteria leak from the colon into the bloodstream.\n\n​\n\nTo bring this into the world of big soccer:\n\nA wider-ranging look at all of the legal substances prescribed to players during the 2002 and 2006 Men’s World Cup tournaments worldwide found that more than half of these elite players were taking NSAIDS at least once during the tournament, with more than 10 percent using them before every match.\n\n​\n\nFinally, the reason most athletes used for taking medication prior to athletic activity was to lessen the pain during the activity:\n\nOne of the most common reasons cited by the triathletes in Brazil was “pain prevention.” Similarly, when the Western States runners were polled, most told the researchers that “they thought ibuprofen would get them through the pain and discomfort of the race,” Nieman says, “and would prevent soreness afterward.” But the latest research into the physiological effects of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs suggests that the drugs in fact, have the opposite effect\n\n​\n\nThanks for the article. Another good reason not to pop NSAIDs regularly is heartburn (GERD - Gastroesophageal reflux disease) - especially as you creep into your 40's or 50's. Research has shown that long-term NSAID users were twice as likely to have GERD symptoms as non-NSAID users.\n\nI had a minor ham string injury a couple of seasons ago and was popping one or two Motrin before games, and it really seemed to help. I'm in my early 50's, and didn't have much problem with intestinal discomfort. I ate alot of legumes and fruits and that seemed to help, but then again there is the gas that can be embarrassing. I don't know if it was the meds or the food.\n\nI haven't been using any anti-inflammatories the past season or so.\n\nYou could try Tylenol, which isn't an NSAID. Just be careful and don't take more than the recommended dose for a day. Or you could try Aleve, an NSAID but whose dosing is twice daily versus four times a day for Ibuprofen. If you are having significant pain on a regular basis, see your physician.\n\nThe article was about taking pills before activity when you don't have pain--to prevent pain. They study found that it doesn't work and that it can lead to kidney problems.\n\nIf you are sore, the pills work and it should be safe taking them as long as you do not exceed the recommended dose.\n\nKidney problems are a known risk of overusing them. You don't want to take too many or take them too regularly, no matter what the reason. If you seem to always have a headache or always have pain, the solution is not pills, it is to see a doctor.\n\nTylenol is non steroidal and anti-inflammatory and should be lumped with other NSAIDS. It became popular as an alternative to aspirin because of lessened GI side effects. That said, the FDA is now asking the makers of narcotic pain killers to stop putting so much acetaminophen in their tablets as the acetaminophen is toxic to the liver. It also does little to alleviate pain and is not a particularly good anti-inflammatory. It does help with fever. Neither the New York Times article or the other newspaper report represent controlled studies and the supposed \"findings\" could well be meaningless. The problem with athletes taking NSAIDS during competition is their hydration status is usually low and when the kidneys aren't perfused properly, any of these drugs can potentially cause problems. Outside of the obvious GI effects, I think aspirin is still the safest and has the most analgesic activity as well as anti-inflammatory activity. When I was a marathon runner I lived on Ibuprofen but only took it after work outs or races to aid in recovery.\n\nBottom line is researchers need to do more work with controlled studies before we'll know anything useful.\n\nJKC313 - You probably did not read the entire article. It is based on a control study by David Nieman, physiologist and director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the North Carolina Research Campus.\n\nTo quote his abstract from his published study:\n\nSubjects included 29 ultramarathoners who consumed 600 and 1200 mg ibuprofen the day before and on race day, respectively, and 25 controls that competed in the race but avoided ibuprofen and all other medications.\n\n​\n\nThis was absolutely a control study.\n\nThe conclusion of the study is also quite clear - ibuprofen does not relieve pain/soreness during the activity and it does cause INCREASED inflammation and endotoxemia. Quote following is the exact concluding statement from the study:\n\nIn conclusion, ibuprofen use compared to nonuse by athletes competing in a 160-km race did not alter muscle damage or soreness, and was related to elevated indicators of endotoxemia and inflammation.\n\n​\n\nDon't mean to come off as attacking you. However, your statement that the report may be misleading or inaccurate is not correct. This issue could result in misinformed folks having serious health consequences and I felt the need to correct this inaccuracy.\n\nThe original post was about the use of Ibuprofen BEFORE matches. Most folks I know who take ibuprofen before matches, do so with the belief that the pills will prevent pain during the match.\n\nThis study proves that ibuprofen is ineffective in providing this perceived benefit and is actually damaging to the kidneys and exposes the rest of the body to increased levels of toxins. In effect, this type of use of Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs represents misuse of these drugs as the <perceived> \"benefit\" does not outweigh the risk of their use."
