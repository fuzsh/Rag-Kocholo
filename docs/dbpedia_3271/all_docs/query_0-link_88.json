Miroslav Klose doubled the Germans’ advantage, capitalizing on a rebound after his initial shot was saved.\n\nKroos then proved his brilliance with two rapid-fire goals. The first came from a missed cross by Philipp Lahm, and the second resulted from a steal from Fernandinho, followed by a quick one-two with Sami Khedira.\n\nBefore halftime, Khedira got on the scoresheet as well, exchanging passes with Mesut Özil to extend Germany’s lead to 5-0. In the second half, substitute André Schürrle continued the goals, first slotting in a goal from Lahm’s cross and then scoring via the crossbar after Müller’s cut-back.\n\nREAD: 10 Best Nintendo Switch Football Games\n\nBrazil managed a consolation goal in the 90th minute, with Oscar dribbling past defenders and finding the back of the net.
