        "text": "II.A. Loss-of-Control Model\n\nConsider a couple that each period has some risk of a conflictual interaction (i.e., a heated disagreement or argument). With some probability h ≥ 0 the interaction escalates to violence (i.e., the husband “loses control”).7 The likelihood of losing control is influenced by the emotional cues associated with the outcome y of a professional football game, where y=1 indicates a home-team victory and y=0 indicates a loss. Letting p=E[y] we assume that:\n\nh = h0 − μ(y − p),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere μ is the gain-loss utility associated with the game outcome (Koszegi and Rabin, 2006). For simplicity we assume that μ is piece-wise linear, with\n\nμ(y − p) = α(y − p), y − p < 0 = β(y − p), y − p > 0,\n\nfor positive constants α and β. Loss aversion implies that α > β, i.e., that the marginal effect of a positive cue is smaller than the marginal effect of a negative cue.\n\nRecognizing that y is binary, the implied probabilities of a loss of control are\n\nhL(p)=h0+apify=0(aloss)hW(p)=h0−β(1−p)ify=1(awin).\n\n(2)\n\nThe upper line in represents hL(p). When p=0 a home-team loss is fully anticipated and there is no emotional cue, so hL = h0. When p>0 a loss is “bad news”, with a stronger negative cue the higher is p: thus hL is increasing in p. The lower line in the figure represents hW(p). A win when p=0 is the “best possible” news, leading to the lowest probability of loss of control, h0−β. For higher values of p a win is less of positive shock, so hW is also increasing in p.\n\nAssuming that the probability of a conflictual interaction is q≥0, the probability of a violent incident, conditional on watching the game, is qh. If the husband always watches, the probability of violence is therefore (h0+αp)q in the event of a loss and (h0−β(1−p))q in the event of a win. The differential effect of a loss versus a win on the probability of violence is:\n\nΔ(risk|p) = [β + (α − β)p]q,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is positive and increasing in p, assuming that α > β.\n\nIn Card and Dahl (2009) we present a forward-looking model in which husbands decide in advance whether to watch a game or not, taking into account the pleasure of watching a win versus a loss, and the risk of exposure to the emotional cue if they watch. In this case the differential effect of a loss versus a win on the probability of violence can be written as:\n\nΔ(risk|p) = [β + (α − β)p] × E[q|watch, p] × Prob[watch|p].\n\n(4)\n\nA comparison of (4) to (3) shows that discretionary viewing behavior will reinforce the effect of an increase in p on the differential effect of a loss versus a win if more people watch a game when p is higher, and/or if the composition of the viewing audience shifts toward more conflict-prone men when p is higher.\n\nIII.A. Measuring Family Violence: NIBRS Data on Police-Reported Violence\n\nOur empirical analysis is based on police reports of family violence in the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). NIBRS includes reports of crime to individual police agencies: the reports are not necessarily associated with an arrest.10 Each report includes information on the characteristics of the victim (age, gender, etc.), the offender (gender, relationship to the victim), and the incident (date, time of day, location, injuries).\n\nNIBRS has two main advantages for our study. First, it includes all the family violence incidents recorded by a given agency. Since family violence is relatively rare, a complete count is needed to measure responses to NFL game outcomes on specific days in specific locations. Second, NIBRS includes real-time information on the date and time of day of the incident. Other sources of information on family violence (such as the National Crime Victimization Survey) are based on recall over a multiple-month period and cannot be used to measure occurrences by exact day and time.\n\nOne limitation of NIBRS is that it only includes police-reported family violence.11 A comparison of the implied rate of violence experienced by women age 18–54 in NIBRS to the rate in the 1995 National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) suggests that NIBRS captures a relatively high fraction of serious violence (i.e., episodes that would be classified as assault or intimidation). Specifically, we estimate that the annual risk of IPV is approximately 1.6% per year in the 2000 NIBRS, versus 1.3% per year in the NVAWS (1995–96).12 A second limitation is that participation by police agencies in NIBRS is voluntary, and is relatively low. The total fraction of the U.S. population covered by NIBRS was only 4% in 1995, but had risen to 25% by 2006.\n\nAs has been noted in other studies (e.g., Vazquez, Stohr and Purkiss, 2005; Gantz, Wang, and Bradley, 2006) the rate of family violence varies substantially across the days of the week, with much higher rates on weekends than weekdays. In view of these patterns, and the small number of NFL games on days other than Sunday, we have elected to simplify our analysis by limiting our sample to the 17 Sundays during the regular NFL season. We define intimate partner violence (IPV) as an incident of simple assault, aggravated assault, or intimidation by a spouse, partner, or boyfriend/girlfriend. Our primary focus is on male-on-female IPV occurring at home between noon and midnight Eastern Time.\n\nprovides summary statistics for IPV for our estimation sample (Sundays during the regular football season) for the set of NIBRS agencies used in our analysis (all reporting police agencies in the set of states that we match to NFL teams, as described in the next section).13 In our estimation sample, the overall rate of IPV is 1.28 per 100,000 individuals per day.14 Panel A shows how the rate of intimate partner violence varies by location and victim-offender relationship. Most of the victims of IPV are women (81%), and most are victimized at home (82%), leading to our focus on at-home male-on-female incidents.15 Within this class, violence by husbands against their wives and violence by men against unmarried partners account for roughly equal shares.\n\nTable I\n\nIntimate Partner ViolenceDaily Rate for the hours of\n\n12 PM to 11:59 PM\n\nPer 100,000 PopulationFraction in Category\n\nor SubcategoryA.

To crudely characterize the severity of an incident, we classified aggravated assaults and other incidents involving physical injury as “serious assaults,” and the remaining forms of IPV as “minor assaults”.16 Using this classification just over one-half of male-on-female at-home IPV incidents are serious assaults.\n\nAlcohol use is widely believed to contribute to family violence (Klostermann and Fals-Steward, 2006) and may amplify the effects of emotional cues (Exum, 2002). Unfortunately, alcohol use information in NIBRS is limited to a single variable indicating whether the offender was suspected of using alcohol (or drugs) during or shortly before the offense. Overall, about 20% of at-home male-on-female incidents of IPV list alcohol or drugs as a contributing factor.\n\nIII.C. Expected Outcomes from Betting Markets\n\nBetting on NFL game outcomes is organized through Las Vegas bookmakers, who equilibrate the market using a point spread. If the point spread is −3 for one team against another, the team must win by more than 3 points for a bet on that team to pay off. The market assessment of the outcome of a game is contained in the closing value of the point spread (the so-called “closing line”).\n\nPrevious research has suggested that the point spread is an unbiased predictor of game outcomes in the NFL (e.g., Pankoff 1968; Gandar et al., 1988). To verify this conclusion, we collected data on point spreads and final scores for all 3,725 NFL football games played during the 1995–2006 seasons. shows the relationship between the actual and predicted point spread in each game. The actual spread is “noisier” than the predicted spread, but the two are highly correlated. In fact, a regression of the actual on the predicted spread yields a coefficient of 1.01 (standard error = 0.03). Thus, there is no evidence against the null hypothesis of an efficient prediction. Moreover, the R-squared of the relationship is relatively strong (0.20) suggesting that the closing line is an informative predictor of game outcomes.\n\nThe vertical lines in divide the predicted spreads into three regions, depending on whether the home team is predicted to win by at least 4 points, predicted to lose by at least 4 points, or predicted to have a close game. About 45% of games are expected to be close: the remaining games are equally divided in the two tails. In our empirical analysis we use these three categories to classify games as “predicted wins”, “predicted close games”, and “predicted losses” for the home team.\n\nOur model is written in terms of the ex-ante probability of a home-team win, rather than the point spread. The mapping between the two is shown in . To derive this relationship we regressed the probability of a victory by the home team on a third order polynomial in the spread. The fitted relationship follows the expected “inverse S-curve” shape, and is symmetric. For spreads of ±14 points (a range that includes 98% of games) the probability of a win is very close to linear, with each onepoint increase in the spread translating into a 3% decrease in the probability of a win. For games with a spread of −4 points or less (“predicted wins”) the probability of a home team victory is 63% or greater. For “predicted losses” (spread ≥ 4) the probability of a win is 37% or less.\n\nPanel B of summarizes the predicted outcomes of the 866 regular-season Sunday games in our IPV analysis sample. Of these games, 283 (33%) were predicted wins for the home team, 206 (24%) were predicted losses, and 377 (44%) were predicted close games. The greater number of predicted wins than losses in our sample reflects the inclusion of two relatively successful teams (Denver and New England). We also report the actual outcomes of the games: the home team lost relatively few (28%) of the games they were favored to win by 4 or more points, and won relatively few (32%) of the games they were predicted to lose by 4 or more points. Among predicted close games the home team victory rate was approximately 50%.\n\nAs discussed in Section V.D, below, we present some analyses of game outcomes relative to the actual point spread at halftime (which we call the “halftime spread” – note that this is not an updated predicted spread from betting markets, but rather the observed point difference at halftime). Like the final score, the halftime spread is more variable than the pre-game spread: by the midpoint of the game only 28% of games are closer than 4 points, while 44% are within the same range using the pre-game spread. The halftime spread is also a better predictor of the final game outcome. For example, among games where the home team led by 4 points or more at halftime, the fraction of losses was 18% (versus 28% using the same classification of the pre-game spread).\n\nPanel B also shows two other important characteristics of NFL games that we explore in later analyses: the starting time, and the likely emotional salience of a game. The largest share of games (68%) in our sample had a 1:00 PM starting time. Most of the others (26%) had a 4:00 PM start time, while only 6% were night games. We consider three measures of emotional salience: whether the home team was still in playoff contention; whether the game was played against a traditional “rival” team; and whether the game involved an unusually high number of sacks, turnovers, or penalty yards.18 Most regular season games (68%) are played when the team is still in playoff contention, while about one-fifth are played against a traditional rival, and about 40% involve a high number of sacks, turnovers, or penalty yards. We define “highly salient” games as those in which the home team was still in playoff contention and either played against a traditional rival or had an unusual number of sacks, turnovers, or penalty yards. These games represent 37% of our sample.\n\nIV.B. Baseline Empirical Results\n\npresents results for our baseline Poisson regressions for at-home male-on-female intimate partner violence occurring between the hours of 12 pm and 12 am on Sundays of the NFL regular season. In these models we assume that\n\ng(Sjt, yjt, λ) = λ1 · 1(Sjt ≤ −4) + λ2 · 1(Sjt ≤ −4)1(yjt = 0) + λ3 · 1(−4 < Sjt < 4) + λ4 · 1(−4 < Sjt < 4)1(yjt = 0) + λ5 · 1(Sjt ≥ 4) + λ6 · 1(Sjt ≥ 4)1(yjt = 1),\n\ni.e., we include dummies for three ranges of the spread, and interactions of these dummies with a game outcome indicator. The main coefficients of interest are λ2, λ4, and λ6, which measure the effects of an upset loss, a close loss, and an upset win, respectively. The coefficients associated with the range of the spread (λ1, λ3, λ5) are also potentially interesting, but less easily interpreted, since variation in S may be correlated with other factors that affect the likelihood of IPV.\n\nTable IV\n\nPoisson Regression\n\nIntimate Partner Violence, Male on Female, at Home\n\nBaseline\n\nModel(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(a) Loss × Predicted Win (Upset Loss).112 (.034).099 (.032).100 (.032).096 (.031).100 (.031)Loss × Predicted Close (Close Loss).031 (.026).030 (.024).032 (.024).025 (.024).026 (.024)(b) Win × Predicted Loss (Upset Win).001 (.037).007 (.027).016 (.027).010 (.029).007 (.029)Predicted Win−.014 (.028)−.019 (.025)−.018 (.025)−.009 (.024)−.081 (.035)Predicted Close−.022 (.025)−.012 (.030)−.013 (.028)−.010 (.030)−.080 (.043)Predicted Loss−.016 (.023)−.007 (.021)−.016 (.021).006 (.021)−.071 (.039)Non-game Day---------------Nielsen Rating.003 (.001)Agency Fixed EffectsXXXXXSeason, Week of Season, & Holiday VariablesXXXXWeather VariablesXXXNielsen Data Sub-sampleXXLoss Aversion Test: p-value for row (a) = – row (b).02.01.00.01.01Number of Agencies764764764747747Observations79,38679,38679,38673,52273,522\n\nThe basic model in column (1) of includes the spread indicators and the interactions with the win or loss variables, as well as a set of agency fixed effects. Columns 2–5 add in three sets of time-varying covariates: season, week of season, and holiday dummies; local weather conditions on the day of the game; and the Nielsen Rating for the local NFL game broadcast. The Nielsen data are only available for the 90% of the game days in our sample that occur in 1997 or later. To check the sensitivity of our results to the sample, column 4 presents a specification identical to the one in column 3 (with agency fixed effects and date and weather controls) but fit to the subsample with Nielsen data.\n\nFocusing on the coefficients associated with the game outcome (in the first three rows of the table) notice that the estimates are quite stable across specifications, as would be anticipated if the game outcome is orthogonal to the other covariates, conditional on the spread.20 The estimates show that an upset loss leads to an approximately 10% increase in the rate of male-on-female at-home IPV. In contrast, the estimated effects of a loss when the game was predicted to be close are only about one-fourth to one-third as large in magnitude, and are never significant. The difference provides direct support for reference-point behavior of fans. Even more surprising, perhaps, is that upset wins appear to have little or no protective effect. Indeed, the estimated effects of an upset win are all positive, rather than negative as would be expected if the reaction to wins and losses is symmetric. Formal tests for symmetry (comparing the effect of an upset loss to the negative of the effect for an upset win) are shown in the third-last row of the table and indicate substantial evidence of loss aversion.21\n\nIn column 5 we explore the effect of controlling for the number of households tuned in to watch a local game. The Nielsen audience ratings are a significant factor in game day violence (t=2.2), with intimate partner violence rising by about 0.3% for each percentage point increase in the number of households watching the game. Importantly, however, the addition of this proxy for the number of couples at home together during a game has no effect on the estimated effects of the game outcomes. This suggests that the asymmetric reaction to upset losses and upset wins cannot be attributed to the lower number of viewers for expected losses.\n\nV.B. Emotionally Salient Games\n\nAssuming that the link between NFL game outcomes and violence arises through emotional cues, one might expect more “emotionally salient” games to have larger effects. The models in explore the relative effects of game outcomes for more salient games (upper panel) and less salient games (lower panel) using the salience classifications introduced in .23 In column 1, we define salience by whether the home team is still in playoff contention (based on having at least a 10% chance of making the playoffs). Among such games the effect of an upset loss rises to 13%, while the effect of a close loss rises to 5% and is marginally significant (t=1.8). In contrast, when the home team is no longer in playoff contention the effect of an upset loss is small and statistically insignificant. The effects of upset losses in the two types of games are statistically different from each other at the 11% level (third-last row of the table).\n\nTable VI\n\nPoisson Regression\n\nIntimate Partner Violence, Male on Female, at HomeGame Type =\n\nStill in Playoff\n\nContentionGame Type =\n\nTraditional\n\nRivalsGame Type =\n\nSacks≥4,\n\nTurnovers≥4, or\n\nPenalties>80 ydsGame Type =\n\nHighly Salient:\n\n(1) & [(2) or\n\n(3)](1)(2)(3)(4)More Salient Games (Game Type = 1)(a) Loss × Predicted Win (Upset Loss).126 (.034).197 (.046).151 (.048).172 (.045)Loss × Predicted Close (Close Loss).054 (.031).011 (.053).027 (.038).082 (.046)Win × Predicted Loss (Upset Win).027 (.048).156 (.080).083 (.040).063 (.059)Predicted Win−.021 (.028)−.042 (.036)−.055 (.035)−.042 (.029)Predicted Close−.040 (.034)−.021 (.051).019 (.038)−.068 (.044)Predicted Loss−.023 (.033)−.042 (.055)−.024 (.026).010 (.038)Less Salient Games (Game Type = 0)(b) Loss × Predicted Win (Upset Loss)−.016 (.080).080 (.034).070 (.037).028 (.041)Loss × Predicted Close (Close Loss)−.003 (.030).035 (.026).042 (.034).018 (.028)Win × Predicted Loss (Upset Win).002 (.039)−.011 (.030)−.024 (.033)−.004 (.027)Predicted Win−.013 (.055)−.014 (.027)−.009 (.028)−.010 (.030)Predicted Close.032 (.032)−.012 (.029)−.012 (.032).004 (.029)Predicted Loss−.008 (.028)−.012 (.020).006 (.027)−.023 (.021)Non-game Day------------Salience Test: p-value for row (a) = row (b).11.01.17.01Number of Agencies764764764764Observations79,38679,38679,38679,386\n\nColumn 2 looks at games against a traditional rival team. The effect of an upset loss is about twice as large for a rivalry game compared to a non-rivalry game (20% versus 8%, p-value for test of equality = 0.01). There is also a marginally significant increase in violence following an upset win against a rival (t=2.0), a pattern that is inconsistent with our simple emotional cueing model.\n\nUpset losses in games that are particularly frustrating for fans could also generate a larger emotional response. In column 3 we look at the effects of three potentially frustrating occurrences: 4 or more sacks, 4 or more turnovers, or 80 or more penalty yards. At least one of these events happens in about 40% of the games in our sample. For frustrating games defined in this manner, the estimated effect of an upset loss is 15%, compared with an estimated 7% increase in violence for upset losses in non-frustrating games.\n\nIn the final column of , we narrow the focus to the 37% of games where the home team is still in playoff contention and is either playing a traditional rival or the game involved an unusual number of sacks, turnovers, or penalties. The effect of an upset loss is now a 17% increase in IPV, compared to a 13% increase for all playoff-contention games in column 1. Moreover, the effect of an upset loss is very close to zero for games which do not fit these criteria. (In fact none of the spread or outcome interaction coefficients are large or significant for these games). These patterns suggest that the overall rise in IPV following an upset loss is driven entirely by losses in games that “matter” the most to fans.24\n\nV.D. Updating of the Reference Point for Game Outcomes\n\nSo far we have assumed that family violence is related to the gap between actual game outcomes and fans’ pre-game expectations. Over the roughly 3 hours that a game actually occurs, however, fans receive new information about the likelihood of final victory, and it is interesting to ask whether the reference point for the emotional cue of the final outcome adjusts accordingly. Some stickiness would seem to be required to generate the pattern of effects in , which shows little or no reaction while a game is in progress, but a rise in violence following an upset loss. Since many of these losses would be predictable midway through the game, if fans actually updated their reference point the final score would not be a surprise. To address the question more formally, we use information on the score at halftime to form an updated spread, and ask whether the rise in violence following a loss is better explained by pre-game expectations, or those as of halftime.\n\nTo proceed, let p0 denote the probability of a home team victory based on the pre-game spread, and let p1 denote the point spread at half-time (i.e., the actual point difference at halftime). Assume that the emotional cue generated by the game outcome (y) is based on the deviation from an updated reference point:\n\np∗ = δp1 + (1 − δ)p0.\n\nWith fully rational updating δ would be equal to the coefficient of the halftime spread in a regression of the probability of ultimate victory on the pre-game and halftime spreads (which is approximately 0.6), while with rigid expectations δ=0.25 Substituting this expression into equation (3), the predicted difference in the risk of violence after a loss versus a win becomes\n\nΔ(risk|p) = [β + (α − β)δp1 + (α − β)(1 − δ)p0]q.\n\n(3′)\n\nConsideration of this expression suggests that we extend our basic model by including a second set of indicators for upset loss, upset win, etc., based on the halftime spread.\n\nEstimation results from two alterative variants of this extended specification are presented in . Because of perfect co-linearity, we cannot simply replicate our baseline models by adding dummies for the 3 ranges of the halftime spread, and a full set of interactions with a loss or win dummy.26 One estimable specification, which drops the main effects for the range of the half-time spread, is presented in the first column of the table. In this specification the estimated interactions with the predicted outcomes based on the pre-game spread are all very similar to the estimates from our baseline model, whereas the interactions with the predicted outcomes based on the halftime spread are all small and insignificant (individually and jointly). Results from an alternative, and more parsimonious specification are presented in columns 2 and 3. Here, we include a linear control for the spread and a dummy for non-game days, rather than dummies for the range of the spread. As a check on the validity of this simpler specification, the model in column 2 excludes all the halftime variables. As in our baseline models, this simple specification shows a roughly 10% effect of upset losses, and small and insignificant effects of upset wins and close loses. Column 3 extends this model by adding dummies for upset win, upset loss, and close loss, based on predictions using the halftime spread. As in column 1, the halftime variables are jointly insignificant (p=0.50) though the point estimates are somewhat larger in magnitude. Based on the results from these two specifications, we conclude that fans’ emotional reactions to game outcomes appear to be driven by the game outcome relative to expectations at the start of the game, with little or no updating using information as of halftime.\n\nTable VII\n\nPoisson Regression\n\nate Partner Violence, Male on Female, at Home(1)(2)(3)Loss × Predicted Win (Upset Loss).116 (.033).105 (.028).142 (.033)Loss × Predicted Close (Close Loss).046 (.024).035 (.020).059 (.026)Win × Predicted Loss (Upset Win).006 (.029).007 (.025)−.015 (.030)Loss × Halftime Predicted Win (Halftime Upset Loss)−.010 (.031)−.030 (.035)Loss × Halftime Predicted Close (Halftime Close Loss)−.036 (.021)−.047 (.026)Win × Halftime Predicted Loss (Halftime Upset Win).004 (.037).023 (.042)Predicted Win−.018 (.026)Predicted Close−.014 (.028)Predicted Loss−.006 (.022)Spread.001 (.002).003 (.002)Halftime Spread−.001 (.001)Non-game Day.016 (.019).015 (.020)Joint Significance of Halftime Variables p-value.36.50Number of Agencies764764764Observations79,38679,38679,386\n\n*This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (1R01HD056206-01A1).

About one-third of female homicide victims in the U.S. were killed by their husband or partner (Fox and Zawitz, 2007).\n\n2Chwe (1990) shows that painful punishment can arise in an agency model when the agent has low outside opportunities, even if punishment is costly for the principal. Bloch and Rao (2002) propose a model in which husbands use violence to signal the quality of their marriage to their wives’ families.\n\n3See Loewenstein (2000) for a general discussion and Laibson (2001) and Bernheim and Rangel (2004) for models of the effect of external cues on decision-making.\n\n4In 2008, NFL Sunday football games were the highest-rated local programs in 88% of the market-weeks. Nationally, the top 10 television programs for 18–49 year old men in 2008 were all NFL football games (NFL and Nielsen Media Research, cited in Ground Report, January 7, 2009).\n\n5As discussed in Levitt (2004) for example, football betting uses a point spread to clear the market. See Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2007) on the information-aggregating properties of betting markets.\n\n6Rees and Schnepel (2009) show that games that involve the upset of a team ranked in the top 25 by the Associated Press (AP) poll have much higher rates of violence. Their definition of “upsets” is substantially different than ours, since a game can only be an upset if a nationally-ranked team is playing.\n\n7Strictly speaking our model focuses on the risk of violent interactions between partners: the outcome could involve injuries to both partners. In our data about 80% of the victims of intimate partner violence are women, so we assume a male perpetrator.\n\n8Tauchen et al. (1991), Farmer and Tiefenthaler (1997), Bowlus and Seitz (2006), and Aizer (2010) all assume that men value violence and their partners tolerate it in return for higher transfers. An efficient bargain with unrestricted transfers maximizes E[ U(y-cw, v, h) ] subject to E[ V(cw, v) ] ≥ V0, where y=family income, cw=consumption of wife, v=violence, h=cue, U is the male’s utility and V is the female’s. The optimal choices for v and cw equate the husband’s marginal willingness to pay for violence with his partner’s marginal supply price. Assuming that negative cues increase the willingness to pay for violence, the level of violence demanded by the husband (and supplied by the wife) will respond as in equation (3). Our reading of the extensive family violence literature outside of economics is that no one thinks a marginal condition like this is true – in other words, the cost of violence to the partner in the “high cue” condition is often far beyond the “price” that is paid by the perpetrator.\n\n9In the NIBRS data we analyze, we note it need not be the victim who reports IP violence to the police.\n\n10About half of family assaults in the NIBRS result in an arrest (Durose et al., 2005; Hirschel, 2008). Direct arrests by police officers with no intervening report of a crime are also included in NIBRS. Information on the NIBRS data set is available at the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data, http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NIBRS/.\n\n11Only about one-half of adult women in the National Crime Victimization Survey who were assaulted by their spouse or partner reported the incident to police (Durose et al., 2005).\n\n12To construct a national incidence rate from the NIBRS we assume that information on the family relationship of the perpetrator is missing at random, and inflated the incident rates for the agencies in NIBRS to the national level using relative populations as of 2000.\n\n13We include incidents reported by city and county agencies but exclude state police, college police, and special agencies. We limit the sample to agencies which report data on any crime (not just IPV) for at least 13 out of 17 Sundays in a season. Copies of the programs that we used to process the publicly available NIBRS data are available in the online appendix.\n\n14We refer to the hours between noon and midnight ET as a day; these hours account for roughly 60% of at-home male-on-female IPV. Ideally the rate of intimate partner violence would be expressed relative to the number of intimate partner couples. In 2000 there were approximately 21 intimate partnerships per 100 people in the U.S. population: thus the rate per couple is approximately 4.8 times the rate per person. Our models include agency fixed effects and therefore control flexibly for most of the variation in the size of the at-risk population.\n\n15The relative fraction of female victims of intimate partner violence is controversial because some data sources (in particular, behavioral checklists that collect incidents of slapping and pushing as well as more serious violence) find that men and women are equally likely to be victimized (e.g., Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz, 1980). Police reports and victimization surveys suggest that women are more likely to be the victims of relatively serious violence (see Hamby, 2005, ).\n\n16NIBRS uses the FBI’s definition of aggravated assault, which is an unlawful attack where the offender wields a weapon or the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated injury. Simple assault is also an unlawful attack, but does not involve a weapon or obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury. Intimidation is the act of placing a person in reasonable fear of bodily harm without a weapon or physical attack.\n\n17Kansas City is in Missouri, but we assume fans in Kansas also follow the team. NIBRS has no data for Missouri agencies until 2006, the last year of our sample period.\n\n18We classify a team as out of contention once the predicted probability of making the playoffs (based on the historical record for teams with a similar win-loss record at the same point in the season) is under 10%. We identified traditional rivalries using information from “Rivalries in the National Football League” on Wikipedia. A list of the rival team pairs we use is available on request.\n\n19Formally, for a binary random variable y with mean p, E[ y | p, Z] = E[ y | p] for any Z, so conditioning on p, y is independent of Z. Assuming the mapping p(S) from the spread to p is invertible and does not depend on Z, E[ y | S, Z] = E[ y | p, Z] = E[ y | p], so y is independent of Z conditioning on S.\n\n20Estimates of the complete set of coefficients for the baseline model in column 3 of are presented in Appendix Table 5 of the online appendix.\n\n21As a robustness check, we explored whether violence is not due to upset losses per se but to game outcomes where the home team failed to “beat the spread.” Specifically, we added a dummy equal to 1 if the actual point spread was less than the Las Vegas spread. In a model like the one in , column 3, the estimated effect is relatively small and insignificantly different from zero (estimate = −.013, s.e. = .020).\n\n22We do not try to fit separate coefficients for games starting at 8 PM, since there are very few of these games (6% of the sample), and until 2006 they were only shown on cable or satellite.\n\n23We fit the models in each column with a full set of interactions between the salience indicator and the 6 dummies representing the pre-game spread and its interaction with the game outcome.\n\n24It is also possible that conditional on the point spread, more violent men are more likely to watch pivotal games (although the amount of selection would have to be sizeable).\n\n25Appendix Table 1 presents a series of models that relate the probability of a home team win to the pregame spread and the halftime spread. Both are highly significant predictors: the relative magnitude of the halftime spread compared to the pre-game spread is approximately 0.6. We also fit models that divide the pre-game and halftime spread into 3 ranges (with cutoffs at −4 and 4 points). In these models the relative magnitudes of the halftime dummies are also about 60 percent of the combined magnitude.\n\n26Our baseline model includes dummies for three ranges of the pre-game spread (S1,S2,S3), and interactions of these with a loss dummy (L), treating non-game days as the base case. Call the additional indicators for the halftime spread (H1,H2,H3). Since S1+S2+S3=H1+H2+H3=1, the set of 12 variables (S1,S2,S3), (H1,H2,H3), (S1×L, S2×L, S3×L), (H1×L,H2×L,H3×L) has only 9 degrees of freedom.\n\n27Recall that in about 20% of incidents the reporting officer notes that alcohol or drugs were a contributing factor in the incident – these are the incidents with “alcohol involved”. Serious assaults include aggravated assaults and all other incidents in which the victim was physically injured.\n\n28These models, like our main results in , were fit using data on male-on-female at-home incidents from noon to midnight only."
