        "text": "The perfect run continues for the United States women's soccer team, as the Americans took down Germany for the second time in Olympic play to earn a spot in the gold medal game against Brazil.\n\nAccording to odds at the top sports betting sites, the USA is a significant favorite in Saturday's final.\n\nThe semifinal against the Germans was much closer than the first game between the teams, and for the second game in a row, the U.S. scored in overtime for a 1-0 win. On the other side of the bracket, Brazil pulled off an upset over Spain, 4-2.\n\nSpain and the USWNT had gone back and forth as favorites to win gold all tournament long, and many expected them to face off in the final. Brazil had different plans, and its offense couldn't be stopped. It was a dominant performance, as Brazil led by two at halftime and would never see its lead be smaller than two, despite two late goals from Spain.\n\nUnited States vs. Brazil odds at DraftKings: Moneyline, to win, spread, total for 2024 Olympic women's soccer final\n\nHere are DraftKings' odds for the USA vs. Brazil Olympic women's soccer gold medal game.\n\nAug. 10 | 11 a.m. ETTo win*MoneylineTotalSpreadUSA-230+100OVER 2.5 +145-0.5 -110Brazil+180+390UNDER 2.5 -180+0.5 -125Draw--+200----\n\n* The \"to win\" market includes extra time and penalties. The other three markets listed here settle after 90 minutes + stoppage time.\n\nAlso check: Top sports betting apps | Best sportsbook promos\n\nUnited States betting news and analysis\n\nThe U.S. women have proven they can win in multiple ways, scoring multiple goals in high-scoring contests and gritting it out in defensive battles. One word comes to mind when it comes to Team USA and that is \"clutch,\" as the squad has come up with winning plays two games in a row when faced with elimination. The offense has not finished as well as it did early in the tournament, but that is not shocking since the competition has improved.\n\nWhat has been consistent all tournament long, though, has been the defense and goalkeeping. No opponent has scored more than one goal against the United States in the Olympics, and the USWNT has not allowed a goal in the knockout rounds, including 120 minutes of extra time. If the defense and goalie Alyssa Naeher continue their back-half dominance, it will lead the USA to Olympic gold on Saturday.\n\nMore: Best soccer betting sites\n\nBrazil betting news and analysis\n\nBrazil, with its backs against the wall and playing without Marta -- its leader and one of the best women's soccer players of all time, due to suspension -- shocked the world by upsetting Spain. The Olympics have not been an easy road for Brazil, as it barely escaped group play, losing to Japan and Spain, but it has turned it on in the knockout stages. It beat the host country, France, in the quarterfinals, before eliminating Spain in the semis.\n\nGetting Marta back for the final will be a huge lift. At 38 years old, Marta has had plenty of rest and should be fresh for the final, which could spell danger for the United States. Some signs point toward Brazil being able to upset the USWNT, but the U.S. squad has been excellent all tournament long and is undefeated for a reason.\n\nBet365 prop bets for USA vs. Brazil women's soccer gold medal game\n\nHere are some of our favorite player props from Bet365 Sportsbook for the women's Olympic soccer final match between the United States and Brazil.\n\nSophia Smith anytime goalscorer +220\n\nMallory Swanson anytime goalscorer +260\n\nNunes da Silva Gabi anytime goalscorer +300\n\nda Silva Marta anytime goalscorer +375\n\nUnited States vs. Brazil prediction: USWNT prevails in 2024 Olympic women's soccer final\n\nWith Marta returning, the storybook ending stage is set for her to win gold, ending her career on a high note. The only thing that stands in her way is the USWNT, a deeper, more talented, and more consistent squad. Brazil will scare the United States in the first half and maybe even take the lead. The United States, though, will be the better team in the second half and continue to come up clutch at winning time."
