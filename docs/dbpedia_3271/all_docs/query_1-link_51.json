Fontas underwent Achilles surgery in late 2019, keeping him out for the majority of the 2020 season before returning as an MLS Defender of the Year contender in 2021.\n\nFollowing a breakout 2021 MLS season, Fontas was named Sporting Kansas City's Defensive Player of the Year.

In his first two seasons, Fontas started 70 of 71 matches as the Celticos earned consecutive top-half finishes in La Liga. The center back helped Celta Vigo reach even greater heights in 2016-17 when the team advanced to the semifinals of the UEFA Europa League for the first time and lost to eventual champion Manchester United.

He was a backline staple for the reserve team over the next three seasons, transitioning from a holding midfielder to a center back under the guidance of then head coach Luis Enrique, the current manager of the Spain Menâs National Team.\n\nFontas and Ilie became teammates ahead of the 2009-10 campaign, forging the spine of a Barcelona B side that gained promotion to the Spanish Segunda Division. Both players reprised leading roles as regular starters during the 2010-11 season, with Barcelona B sealing third place in the Segunda Division â tied for the teamâs best finish ever.\n\nIn addition to scoring twice in 72 games for Barcelona B, Fontas played 16 matches for Barcelonaâs senior team between 2009-2012.
