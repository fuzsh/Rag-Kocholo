        "text": "CHICAGO (Feb. 27, 2024) – The U.S. Men’s National Team will take on world power Brazil in the second edition of the Allstate Continental Clásico on June 12 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. The Allstate Continental Clásico is an annual event that features the USMNT hosting a top-tier opponent from North, Central or South America, and this year’s match will serve as a key part of the USA’s preparations for the prestigious 2024 Copa América. The announcement was made live during NBA on TNT Tuesday Pregame Show.\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on TNT, Telemundo, Universo, Max, and Peacock and on Fútbol de Primera radio. Coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. ET, with kickoff set for 7:07 p.m. Fans can follow the USMNT on Twitter (@USMNT), Instagram (@USMNT), Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.\n\n“Getting the opportunity to play against Brazil is special. When you talk about wanting to challenge ourselves against the best teams in the world, you can’t ask for much better than Brazil. With their extremely talented player pool and rich history of success on the world stage this will certainly be a great preparation game for Copa America,” USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter said. “The fan support in Orlando has always been outstanding, and when you play against the five-time World Cup champions at Camping World Stadium it should be even more electric.”\n\nThe second edition of the Allstate Continental Clásico tees up another premier contest as the USMNT takes on five-time World Cup champion Brazil for the first time since 2018. Currently ranked No. 5 in the FIFA World Rankings, Brazil reached the quarterfinals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup before falling in penalties to eventual bronze medalist Croatia. This summer, the Seleção is seeking its 10th Copa América title after finishing runner-up in 2021 and topping the podium in 2019. The Allstate Continental Clásico will mark the USA’s first match back at Camping World Stadium since January 1998 when it defeated Sweden 1-0 on a goal from Roy Wegerle.\n\nThe Allstate Continental Clásico kicked off last year with a renewal of the North America’s fiercest rivalry - USA-Mexico - on April 19 in Glendale, Ariz. The USMNT’s Jesús Ferreira tallied a late equalizer to draw archrival El Tri 1-1 in front of nearly 56,000 fans.\n\nThe design and branding for the Allstate Continental Clásico was led by U.S. Soccer’s Brand and Creative team. The insignia draws inspiration from traditional American sports logos, while the font is a nod to Hispanic culture. The red lines represent the USA and grey, the opponent.\n\nTICKETS\n\nTickets for the June 12 match at Camping World Stadium in Orlando go on sale to the public Friday, March 1 at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe pre-sale for this match will begin on Wednesday, Feb. 28 at 10 a.m. ET and run to Friday, March 1 at 8 a.m. ET.\n\nCircle members supporting the U.S. Soccer Development Fund can receive individual customer support and concierge services for their ticketing needs.

The USMNT is 1-18-0 against the Seleção all-time, the lone victory coming during the 1998 Concacaf Gold Cup, a 1-0 triumph as Brazil competed in the region’s continental championship as a guest nation. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller put in a legendary performance in Los Angeles, making 10 stops against Brazil’s vaunted attack while Preki netted the game-winning goal in the second half.\n\nThe nations last met in Sept. 2018, a 2-0 loss for the U.S. in East Rutherford, N.J., while the all-time series dates back to 1930. Brazil has won the Copa America nine times and was drawn into Group D alongside Colombia, Paraguay and the winner of the Costa Rica-Honduras qualifying playoff match which will be contested on March 23.\n\nTHE CITY BEAUTIFUL\n\nOrlando has served as a fortress for the USMNT in recent years, with the U.S. sporting a 7-2-0 record all-time in the city. The U.S. is a perfect 6-0-0 at Orlando City SC’s Inter&Co Stadium, with several of those victories coming in important official competitions. Most recently, the U.S. topped El Salvador 1-0 on March 27, 2023 to clinch its place in the 2022-23 Concacaf Nations League Finals, where it took home its second-straight title. The City Beautiful also played host for a key World Cup qualifying match against Panama on March 27, 2022, where a Christian Pulisic hat trick led the U.S. to a 5-1 win and the brink of clinching a berth to Qatar 2022.\n\n“We look forward to partnering with Florida Citrus Sports to make this special event come to life. Camping World Stadium is the perfect host for one of the biggest international friendlies in Orlando’s history,” U.S. Soccer Chief Commercial Officer David Wright said. “We’re also excited to work with Orange County, the City of Orlando and the Greater Orlando Sports Commission to make this event a showcase for the destination.”\n\nAbout Allstate\n\nThe Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) protects people from life’s uncertainties with a wide array of protection for autos, homes, electronic devices, and identity theft.
