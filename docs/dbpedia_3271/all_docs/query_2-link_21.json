        "text": "Brazil has some of the best football players of all time. They are Globally recognized for their national talent and are constantly pulling medals for the teams and individual players.\n\nToday we are going to narrow down these amazing sporting heroes and show you the 10 best Brazilian football players of all time.\n\nRonaldo Luís Nazário de Lima – Ronaldo\n\nOften simply known as “Ronaldo”, this legendary player is a 2 time Ballon d’Or Winner. He often gets nicknamed “The Phenomenal One”, but no matter what title you give this champion, he is the most well-known person in Brazil.\n\nThe 3 time World Player of the Year winner couldn’t be placed anywhere else but at the top of this list. And if he hadn’t sustained a knee injury, he could have shown us an extra decade of his amazing talents.\n\nEdson Arantes do Nascimento – Pelé\n\nYou don’t have to look at any of Pelé’s matches to know that he is a legend. Just the stats themselves show you everything you need to know. FIFA has confirmed that Edson Arantes do Nascimento (also known as Pelé’) is the greatest goalscorer in football history. During 1,363 games, Pelé had scored a whopping 1,281 goals!\n\nPelé was also the youngest scorer for the national team, playing at just 16 years old during the World Cup. Having played in the World Cup three times, you knew who was going to win when Pelé walked on the pitch. He was a bettor’s best friend for the soccer betting odds.\n\nRivaldo Vítor Borba Ferreira – Rivaldo\n\nAmong the greats, it can be easy to be lost in the crowd, but Rivaldo has one of the best hat-tricks of all time, which is one reason why he stands out.\n\nIt started with Rivaldo bending a free-kick. Then he scored again shooting from an unbelievable 25 yards away, the kick was so powerful that no one could have stopped it. The last score in the hat-trick came from an out-of-the-blue bicycle kick barely inside the box. It was a match Brazil will always remember.\n\nRonaldinho de Assis Moreira – Ronaldinho\n\nRonaldinho was a much-loved player for his skills and his personality. His smile alone made the crowd cheer!\n\nOne of the many reasons why people loved Ronaldinho was his street football start. His skills were amazing and drew in so much attention that a game was created in 2000 to cash in on the hype.\n\nPlaying alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo, Ronaldinho was part of the three-player rush who won the 2022 World Cup!\n\nRomário de Souza Faria – Romário\n\nRomário was another player powered by the support of the fans. He was one of the best strikers of all time! When playing for the Netherlands, Romário scored an outstanding 98 goals in 110 games. These weren’t just any games either, these were league games.\n\nHe managed the same feat in Barcelona, where Romário scored 34 goals in just 46 games. This time the games were in La Liga!\n\nMarcos Evangelista de Morais – Cafu\n\nAlso known as Cafu, Marcos Evangelista de Morais was one of the most well-known defenders on any pitch. He was respected beyond his nationality, as the only player (even to this day) to play in three World Cup finals consecutively. In the last appearance, he played the stunning game as Captain.\n\nIt is rare for defenders to get the hype that they deserve, but Cafu was never short of love.\n\nRicardo Izecson dos Santos Leite – Kaká\n\nKaká is an amazing example of how talented and prosperous Brazil’s football teams are. He is yet another outstanding attacking midfield player. Looking at his titles alone, Kaká won the World Cup in 2022, won the League Cup in the 2003-2204 season, and the Cup Double during that time too.\n\nHe then went on to win the Champions League in 2006 and the Ballon d’Or in 2007. Only 8 players have ever won the Ballon d’Or, Champions League, and World Cup, and Kaká was one of them.\n\nSócrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira – Sócrates\n\nSócrates was one of the only athletes in the whole football world who openly refused to live an athlete’s life. Where most of the team would be on strict diets, exercising every day and watching their body every minute of the day, Sócrates drank, smoked, and ate what he liked.\n\nHe did it all openly and with pride, knowing that life is for living not restricting. He was the brains of the 1980s team using strategy over pure talent.\n\nNeymar da Silva Santos Júnior – Neymar\n\nNeymar is one of the most expensive players in the game. Although money has changed dramatically since football first became an international sport, Neymar created a world record when he moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. The move cost €222 million and he was worth every euro.\n\nArthur Antunes Coimbra – Zico\n\nThe last legend on our list is Zico. Although he never won a World Cup, he was part of the amazing 1970s-1980s team which saw a rise in Brazilian talent. He was known as a deadly passer, making every kick land with accuracy.\n\nSummary\n\nBrazil is the heart of football and every season they show the world just how amazing their talent is.\n\nBy: Melanie Ocasio\n\nFeatured Image: @GabFoligno / Ben Radford / Getty Images"
