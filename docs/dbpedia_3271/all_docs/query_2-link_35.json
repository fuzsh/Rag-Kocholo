        "text": "Sophia Smith scored in extra time and the United States earned a spot in the gold medal match at the Paris Olympics with a 1-0 victory over Germany on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Smith said the win \"means absolutely everything.\"\n\nThe Americans, undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes, go on to face Brazil in hopes of scoring their fifth gold medal in their sixth appearance in the Olympic women's soccer final.\n\nThe last time Team USA made it to the Olympic finals was at the London Games in 2012.\n\n\"I'm so proud of us for finding a way in these last few games to get the win,\" Smith said of her teammates pathway to victory.\n\nGermany put up a fight all the way to the end, but goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher helped the United States keep its lead, blocking a last minute goal attempt by their opponents.\n\nThe United States will play Brazil, which beat world champion Spain 4-2 on Tuesday. The two countries will face off on Saturday, Aug. 10, in Paris. Germany will play Spain in the bronze medal match on Friday at Lyon.\n\nThe gold medal match coincidentally lines up with Smith's 24th birthday.\n\nSmith broke the scoreless stalemate five minutes into extra time, out maneuvering defender Felicitas Rauch and German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nAfter netting her third goal of the tournament, Smith fell to the ground in celebration and joined in an embrace with teammate Mallory Swanson.\n\nThe United States had defeated Germany 4-1 in the group stage earlier in the tournament."
