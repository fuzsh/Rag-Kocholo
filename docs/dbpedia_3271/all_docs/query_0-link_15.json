        "text": "The FCS season is fast approaching, so we’re going inside each conference race. With Montana and Montana State leading the way as two of six nationally ranked teams in the preseason, here’s our 2024 Big Sky football preview.\n\nMontana broke through last season with its first Big Sky championship since 2009. Will the entire conference break through with an FCS national title this season?\n\nEastern Washington (2018 season), Montana State (2021) and Montana (last season) have each been a recent national runner-up, helping the Big Sky entrench itself as the second-strongest FCS conference behind the Missouri Valley.\n\nWith the defending champion Grizzlies leading the way, the Big Sky is primed for another banner season, and it could extend to the final night of 2024 season action on Jan. 7 in Frisco, Texas.\n\n2024 Big Sky Football Preview\n\nPredicted Order of Finish\n\n*-FCS Playoff Qualifier\n\n1. *Montana (2023 Record: 13-2, 7-1; No. 2 national preseason ranking) – The confidence gained from last season’s breakthrough feels just as important as the significant returning talent on coach Bobby Hauck’s squad. A new starting quarterback – either redshirt freshman Keali’i Ah Yat or Fresno State transfer Logan Fife – will have an abundance of offensive options, led by wide receivers Junior Bergen and Keelan White and running backs Eli Gillman and Nick Ostmo. The defense is retooling up front, but linebacker Riley Wilson and cornerback Trevin Gradney are of the Griz’s six Stats Perform FCS Preseason All-Americans. Plus, a not-so-rugged schedule suggests a long string of wins ahead.\n\n2. *Montana State (8-4, 6-2; No. 4 national preseason ranking) – The Bobcats have ranked No. 2 in the FCS in rushing yards per game in each of the past two seasons. Quarterback Tommy Mellott is again at the offensive controls behind an excellent line (Marcus Wehr and Justus Perkins are All-Americans). Four returnees rushed for over 440 yards last season, although No. 1 running back Julius Davis missed the start of training camp.\n\n3. *Idaho (9-4, 6-2; No. 7 national preseason ranking) – The Vandals are vastly different in the offensive skills positions, although QB Gevani McCoy’s transfer to Oregon State is tempered by the return of Jack Layne, who passed for six touchdowns in his only start last season. Ten of the defense’s top-15 tacklers are back, with all four starters returning up front, led by Dallas Afalava inside and Keyshawn James-Newby on the edge.\n\n4. *UC Davis (7-4, 5-3; No. 18 national preseason ranking) – Tim Plough has succeeded Dan Hawkins as head coach, inheriting a ready-to-order playoff team. While QB Miles Hastings seeks to get back to his 2022 form (3,048 yards, 20 TDs), Lan Larison is one of the FCS’ top running backs. The defense boasts standouts in safety Rex Connors and defensive end Zach Kennedy.\n\n5. *Sacramento State (8-5, 4-4; No. 8 national preseason ranking) – The Hornets’ excellence continued in coach Andy Thompson’ first season. Kaiden Bennett fueled their playoff win at North Dakota, but Carson Conklin also returns as an accomplished quarterback. The heavy lifting starts up front with a veteran O-line, led by two-time All-Big Sky first-team pick Jackson Slater.\n\n6. Weber State (6-5, 4-4; No. 22 national preseason ranking) – The momentum of a three-game winning streak to end coach Mickey Mental’s first season (including against Idaho) carries into this year, but the Wildcats are under the radar. Quarterback Richie Munoz established himself during the win streak, while defensive end Brayden Wilson already was a standout.\n\n7. Eastern Washington (4-7, 3-5) – The Eagles seek to avoid a third straight losing season for the first time since having five in a row from 1987-91. But there’s another dangerous passing combo on the red turf – Kekoa Visperas (2,754 passing yards, 19 TD passes last season) to Efton Chism III, the FCS’ active receptions leader (226).\n\n8. Portland State (5-6, 4-4) – Dual-threat QB Dante Chachere has passed for 35 touchdowns and run for 17 more over the last two seasons. The schedule is gulp material: two FBS opponents plus eight of 10 FCS opponents that finished with a winning record last year.\n\n9. Northern Arizona (5-6, 5-3) –New coach Brian Wright went 33-8 at Pittsburg State from 2019-23. Safety Alex McLaughlin led the Lumberjacks in tackles (71), interceptions (four) and pass breakups (10) as a freshman last season, and linebacker Tommy Ellis posted a breakout season.\n\n10. Idaho State (3-8, 3-5) – Quarterbacks Jordan Cooke and Hunter Hays have flashed their ability the last two seasons, but the Bengals threw the most interceptions in the FCS last year (22) and over the last two seasons (38). Safeties Calvin Pitcher (87) and Mason Young (75) ranked first and second, respectively, in tackles.\n\n11. Cal Poly (3-8, 1-7) – Defensive end Elijah Ponder has racked up 31 TFLs and 19.5 sacks in his career (yeah, he scares everybody in the conference). Leading pass catcher Giancarlo Woods is back to help redshirt sophomore QB Bo Kelly continue his maturation.\n\n12. Northern Colorado (0-11, 0-8) – The Bears have the FCS’ third-worst losing percentage since 2019 (8-37, .178), but there’s optimism after the coaching hire of Ed Lamb, who guided former Big Sky member Southern Utah to the 2015 conference title. Their top player is sophomore punter/kicker Hunter Green.\n\nHow the Conference Predicted the Race\n\nFive Players to Know\n\nJunior Bergen, WR/RS, Montana (Walter Payton Award preseason nominee) – The elusive Bergen is tied for the Big Sky career record with five punt returns for touchdowns – all in the last two seasons.\n\nBrody Grebe, DE, Montana State (Buck Buchanan Award preseason nominee) – The Big Sky’s Preseason Defensive MVP seeks to build off a junior season with 13.5 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks.\n\nLan Larison, UC Davis (Walter Payton Award preseason nominee) – Despite missing three games due to injury, Larison earned Big Sky Offensive MVP with an average of 162.4 scrimmage yards per game and 15 TDs.\n\nTommy Mellott, QB, Montana State (Walter Payton Award preseason nominee) – The Bobcats have gone 32-9 over Mellott’s three seasons while he’s gained over 5,700 yards of total offense and accounted for 53 TDs.\n\nElijah Ponder, DE, Cal Poly (Buck Buchanan Award preseason nominee) – Last season, Ponder tied the program record with 17 QB hurries, and his 10 sacks were the most by a Mustang since 2015.\n\nFive Must-See Matchups\n\n1. Montana at Montana State (Nov. 23) – Last year’s rivalry matchup was the first when both teams entered with a top-five ranking, but UM’s 37-7 win marked the fourth straight lopsided result in the series (a 2-2 split in that time).\n\n2. Montana at Eastern Washington (Sept. 28)\n\n3. Idaho at UC Davis (Sept. 28)\n\n4. UC Davis at Montana (Nov. 9)\n\n5. UC Davis at Sacramento State (Nov. 23)\n\nFast Fact\n\nSix Big Sky schools have combined on seven wins over FBS opposition in the last three seasons, including Sacramento State back-to-back against Colorado State (2022) and Stanford (last season).\n\nThe Hornets open the 2024 season at San Jose State, then travel to Fresno State."
