        "text": "”Borowczyk is of major importance to the cinema. He is nigh on a genius. Simultaneously, he is both a realist and a surrealist, good with his hands and highly cultured. He is a filmmaker with a feeling for framing, but also for off-centring, combined with a sense of rhythm and light. One might think there were several Borowczyks, but his drawings and his shots as a filmmaker overlap. His work is so diverse, yet the same elements are to be found in his rapid short films and his feature productions. In addition to their technical quality and originality, his films always contain a touch of humour.\n\nI once advised Michel Simon to act in the film Blanche. Initially, Simon found the prospect rather unappealing and refused, but then he met Borowczyk and changed his mind. ’This guy is incredible. He hammers in nails, he paints, he designs costumes, and he has an unpronounceable surname. I want to do a film with him!’\n\nThat’s who Borowczyk was.”\n\n—Freddy Buache (journalist, critic, film historian, and director of La Cinémathèque suisse from 1951–1996)\n\nAccording to Stanisław Różewicz, the split in Walerian Borowczyk’s career was “a splinter that hurt him all his life.”\n\nBorowczyk was not in exile—he was an émigré. When he arrived in Paris in 1958, Borowczyk had brought with him a sensibility forged in his homeland. Still, he readily engaged with French culture throughout the 1960s: he shared a directing credit with Chris Marker on The Astronauts (1959), collaborated with the composer Bernard Parmegiani on several occasions, and adapted a short story by Guy de Maupassant, Rosalie (1966). Above all else, Borowczyk’s adopted homeland embraced him as an honorary surrealist. In his memoirs, Borowczyk recalled that André Breton had hugged him before comparing his imagination to a bolt of lightning at the opening of the “Camera Obscura” exhibition of his artwork at Théâtre le Ranelagh in 1965. Two years later, Borowczyk was awarded the Prix Max Ernst.\n\nAccording to the Czech animator Jan Švankmajer, however, Borowczyk was not a surrealist, but an existentialist. In an interview in 1984, Borowczyk was keen to dissociate himself from the surrealistic tradition in his homeland, though he did recognize the influence of an earlier movement—Polish Romanticism:\n\nAt home and at school I got to know about Mieszko and Mickiewicz. Every one of my projects is inspired by the Polish language… Since my youth, I memorised Pan Tadeusz. I memorised every note played by Jankiel, and when I close my eyes, I see Jankiel.\n\nFor fellow émigré Andrzej Żuławski, the surrealist aspect of twentieth-century Polish culture was the result of a distension of Polish Romanticism. Surrealism and Polish Romanticism collide head-on in Blanche (1971), Borowczyk’s follow-up to Goto, Isle of Love (1968), though the original script for Blanche preceded it. In 1967, Borowczyk wrote a script in Polish based on Mazepa by the Polish romantic poet Juliusz Słowacki. He sent it to Stanisław Różewicz, the filmmaker brother of Borowczyk’s friend from Kraków, Tadeusz. Różewicz had recently been involved in the establishment of a new Polish film group, Tor. Enthusiastic about the script, Różewicz set about putting what would have been Borowczyk’s feature-length debut into production. However, it was not to be:\n\nSome bad forces came into play, both from the film industry (possibly from some directors jealous of the name and position Borowczyk had already started to make for himself) and from political circles, ‘The director comes from the West, we can’t predict what he’s going to do, etc.’ So, the whole idea was stalled. Unfortunately, I was unable to counter those forces and Borowczyk’s Mazepa did not materialise.\n\nThe problem with filmmaking in Poland during the 1960s and 1970s was, for Borowczyk, the lack of freedom. Almost immediately after he left Poland in 1958, the freedoms he had enjoyed in the previous two years were curtailed. In a 1985 interview with Susan Adler for Cinema Papers, Borowczyk voiced his credo:\n\nTrue art is freedom and sincerity: an artist expressing himself by doing what he loves to do most, in total freedom, with absolutely no interference.\n\nAfter the success of Goto, Isle of Love, Borowczyk returned to Mazepa, relocating the action to medieval France. If Blanche has a theme, it is how unfulfilled sexual desire manifests itself as violence and bloodshed. With its dank castle and dungeon, virginal protagonist, and lecherous admirers, not to mention blasphemous images of weaponry disguised as religious paraphernalia, there is a Gothic, even Sadean aspect to Blanche. However, like Theatre of Mr. and Mrs. Kabal (1967), and Goto, Isle of Love, Blanche was first and foremost an excuse for Borowczyk to construct an entire world from scratch.\n\nTo make the film in total freedom, Borowczyk and Dominique Duvergé produced the film through their own company, Abel et Charton. The producer was Philippe d’Argila, who had produced Costa-Gavras’s Z (1969), starring Jacques Perrin. Not only did d’Argila recruit Perrin for one of the leading roles, he also persuaded him to be a silent partner. Compared to Goto, Isle of Love, Blanche was a much larger production. André Heinrich, Borowczyk’s friend from his days at Les Cinéastes Associés, was hired as assistant director. Two key crew members were brought in by d’Argila: production designer Jacques d’Ovidio and costumer Piet Bolscher, and they would go on to work extensively with Borowczyk throughout the 1970s. Filming took place in the Fontainebleau Forest, and exteriors were filmed at the fortifications of the Château de Vincennes and at the Château d’Anjony. Interiors were shot entirely in a studio, with sets, costumes and props which were either supervised or designed by Borowczyk. Guy Durban returned as cinematographer, and Noël Véry was promoted to first camera assistant.\n\nFor the role of Blanche, Borowczyk cast his wife, Ligia. Like Rosalie, Blanche is constructed around Ligia’s performance. Perrin, however, wanted Catherine Deneuve and the resultant dispute led to the production being suspended. Ultimately, Borowczyk got his way. As an actress Ligia’s range is narrow but focused like a bolt of lightning. The intensity of her performance stems from a suppressed hysteria, in which perpetual emotional turmoil is offset by a brittle, stoic demeanor.\n\nFreddy Buache, founder of the Cinémathèque suisse, recommended the actor Michel Simon, and Patrice Leconte, then a student at L’lnstitut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC), was hired as a second assistant director on the basis of the articles he had written on Theatre of Mr. and Mrs. Kabal and Goto, Isle of Love for Cahiers du Cinéma. Leconte was thus able to witness Borowczyk realizing a passion project, and recalled the director standing on a stepladder, painting the sets while the cast looked on nonplussed. If Borowczyk was guilty of a sin, it was his inability to delegate:\n\nI also eliminate the collaborators who dare to try and barter their own ideas with me. I know everything. And that very often drives members of my crew to tears.\n\nDuvergé and Heinrich accommodated Borowczyk’s meticulousness and diffused the tensions that arose among actors who felt upstaged by sets, costumes, and props. Borowczyk was interested in actors, he merely expected them to perform without the need for subtext, according to the director Florence Dauman. According to Borowczyk:\n\nOrators and bad actors “act” in life. Great actors live on the stage. That’s called sincerity. The unforgettable moment is when their lives are fixed onto celluloid. And it is they who are the best witnesses to their epoch.\n\nBlanche, like all Borowczyk’s films, is marked by the director’s approach to composition. He treated framing and editing as facets of montage, like Sergei Eisenstein. In essence, both framing and editing involve selection, determining what is to be included and (equally important) what is to be excluded:\n\nI look through the viewfinder and I eliminate things. That’s the secret.\n\nTo the English director Leslie Megahey, Borowczyk’s approach to filming the medieval era in Blanche was “a revelation.” The Giotto-esque fresco look of Blanche rejects the idea of the film camera as a surrogate for eyes in an imaginary, albeit realistic, space. Instead, Borowczyk calls upon a simpler, almost graphic means of conceiving cinematic space. His sense of composition is painterly, not in terms of aestheticism, but concerning the significance bestowed upon details that might otherwise be considered extraneous to the action. This is most evident in terms of the equal importance Borowczyk attributes to props and animals, as well as to actors and locations. At first glance, the world conjured up by Borowczyk appears familiar. However, his constant tugging of the viewer’s attention towards specific details is disconcerting. Consequently, the medieval world rendered in Blanche—while not as strange as the imaginary isle of Goto—is far from conventional."
