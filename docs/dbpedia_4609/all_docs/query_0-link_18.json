        "text": "If sin, like truth and beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, then \"Story of Sin,\" the Polish entry at the New York Film Festival tonight and tomorrow night, is a delight to the eye. But Walerian Borowczyk, the Polish director who previously worked in France, is enamored of a saga that is, in essence, a cross between grand and soap opera.His principals may be true to themselves. Victorian moralities and their vintage settings but, despite the dedication of the director and his cast, their \"Story of Sin\" evolves more as a quaint, visually engrossing album of a faded past than as a gripping motion picture.In fashioning his script from an old Polish novel, Mr. Borowczyk, and an English prologue and subtitles, make it plain that turn-of-the-century Czarist-dominated Warsaw was rough on the staunchly Catholic, disenfranchised Polish petit bourgeois. And our pure, religiously proper young heroine is no exception. She is quickly caught up in the throes of first love with a lodger in her parents' apartment who, it happens, is seeking a divorce. As might be guessed, this is the start of a convoluted, bitter romance indicating that sin isn't necessarily simple.As was the case in Mr. Borowczyk's \"Immoral Tales,\" seen here early this year, eroticism, costuming, settings and photography are artistically detailed. Lovers engulfed in newly found ecstacy in cramped village quarters or in a baroque Riviera suite leave little to the imagination.And lust and murder are made equally specific in rich, red damask rooms filled with bibelots and the sounds of a raucous ancient gramophone.The primal drive of love and the beastliness of sinners in our heroine's life make for a complex plot with some seemingly abrupt transitions. But Mr. Borowczyk's fascination with his subject appears to have rubbed off on his willing players. If he is precise in dealing with action in the boudoir, he is just as careful in maintaining a fast narrative pace.(In a largely unbilled cast that contributes to that momentum, Grazyna Dlugolecka is outstanding as the pretty, driven outcast. She is curvaceous, but more importantly, genuinely winning and realistic, both as the virgin introduced to love and sex amid swirling white petticoats or nude or in black corsets as the seemingly callous streetwalker.If Jerzy Zelnik's portrait of her beleaguered student dover is merely a profile, others, including Olgierd Lucaszewicz, vigorously project sincere if sometimes-postured portrayals.Mr. Borowczyk and his actors colorfully evoke the people and places of a restrictive society with the dedication of historians. There inspection of the complexities of sin, however, is as obvious and colorful as a vintage snapshot.\"Story of Sin\" is slated to start an engagement at the RKO Twin 1 Theater on East 59th Street next Thursday.\n\nSTORY OF SIN (DZIEJE GRZECHU); directed by Walerian Borowczyk; screenplay (Polish with English subtitles) by Mr. Borowczyk from is novel by Stefan Zeromski; produced by Polish Carporation for Film Production. \"TOR\" Film Unit; director of photography Zygmunt Samosiuk; art director Teresa Barsko; music, Felix Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E-minor, Johann Pachelbel Prelude in D minor; distributed by TINC Productions.
