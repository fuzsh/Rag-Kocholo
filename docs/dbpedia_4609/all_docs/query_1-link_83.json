Quite simply, there is no filmmaker quite like Boro. Borowczyk's films have an astonishing, magical quality. They reach a place very rare in contemporary cinema, and are quite unlike the films of any other auteur. Borowczyk's films create their own space, with imagery, sounds and music of a really exceptional power.\n\nThe book discusses each Walerian Borowczyk film in detail, sometimes going through scenes shot by shot.\n\nThis fourth edition includes new chapters on\n\n Borowczyks short films and animations\n\n The Theatre of Mr and Mrs Kabal\n\n The Streewalker (a.k.a. La Marge)\n\n Lulu\n\n The Strange Case of Dr Jeckyll and Miss Osbourne (a.k.a. Docteur Jekyll et les femmes)\n\n and the Softly From Paris TV series (a.k.a. Série Rose).\n\nBlanche, Immoral Tales, Behind Convent Walls, The Beast and Goto: Island of Love, can be celebrated for their painterly sense, the use of props and costumes, and the incredible attention to detail. Very stylized, mysterious, poetic. Not forgetting the acute awareness of the history of religion and literature. Walerian Borowczyk produced some of the most memorable images in European cinema, the equal of Ingmar Bergman, Sergei Paradjanov or Andrei Tarkovsky.\n\nThe great Walerian Borowczyk masterpiece i's Goto: Island of Love. That can rank alongside the great films in the history of cinema. Immoral Tales could be placed in the masterpiece class too. The other Borowczyk films are often as fascinating, often more grotesque ­ certainly more sexually explicit ­ but probably not as wholly satisfying as Goto: Island of Love, from a conventional critical standpoint. But The Beast, Blanche, Behind Convent Walls, and Love Rites would count as extraordinary films by most standards. They may not be quite up there with Persona (Ingmar Bergman) or 8 1/2 (Federico Fellini), but taken together they form a group of works that mark Borowczyk out as a maverick original. Similarly, Borowczyk isn't a filmmaker celebrated by critics or filmmakers, like Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Jean Renoir or Sergei Eisenstein, and his films don't make critics' top ten lists. For detractors, Borowczyk's films were better when they concerned ideas rather than the senses - philosophy not sex.\n\nYou probably won't know many other people who've even heard of Walerian Borowczyk, let alone seen one of his films. His reputation as a producer of European arty porny films (art-as-porn films or porn-as-art films) is probably all that many people will have heard of him (movies with sex and nudity do seem to travel well, crossing borders). Needless to say, Borowczyk's films are not shown regularly on television, even by channels which boast of their open-mindedness and international film broadcasts. Similarly, you won't see Borowczyk's films at the cinema nowadays, even rep, arthouse and independent cinemas rarely screen his films. It's mainly home video releases (and, later, home DVD releases) that's enabled Borowczyk's films to reach a contemporary audience (the porny and arty elements make them perfect for niche marketing to the cognoscenti). And you'll have to hunt to find them all. You won't find The Beast next to Back To the Future and Bad Boys on the 'B' shelf in your local video store.\n\nFully illustrated, with over 340 stills from all of Walerian Borowczyk's movies and short films (including a gallery from the history of erotica), a bibliography, complete filmography and notes.\n\nThe text has been updated throughout for this new, 4th edition, which is over twice the length of previous editions.\n\nHardcover with a colour laminated cover and a colour flyleaf.\n\nwww.crmoon.com\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAcknowledgements  8\n\nP A R T O N E  W A L E R I A N B O R O W C Z Y K\n\n1 The Cinema of Walerian Borowczyk  21\n\nP A R T T W O  T H E F I L M S\n\n2 The Short Films of Walerian Borowczyk  132\n\n3 The Theatre of Mr and Mrs Kabal  162\n\n4 Goto, Island of Love  173\n\n5 Blanche  213\n\n6 Immoral Tales  238\n\n7 The Beast  295\n\n8 The Story of Sin  343\n\n9 The Streetwalker  371\n\n10 Behind Convent Walls  393\n\n11 Three Immoral Women  417\n\n12 Lulu  451\n\n13 The Strange Case of Dr. Jeckyll and Miss Osbourne  460\n\n14 The Art of Love  145\n\n15 Emmanuelle 5  521\n\n16 Love Rites  539\n\n17 Softly From Paris  564\n\n18 Other Films  590\n\nQuotes By Walerian Borowczyk  596\n\nBrotherhood of the Wolf  597\n\nFilmography  600\n\nBibliography  620\n\nHARDBACK\n\n£34.99 / $52.99 (Trade terms: 35%).\n\nTHE BEAST\n\nWALERIAN BOROWCZYK\n\nAN EROTIC FAIRY TALE\n\nBy Jeremy Mark Robinson\n\nWalerian Borowczyk (1923-2006) is one of cinema's great talents. Quite simply, there is no filmmaker quite like Boro. Borowczyk's films have an astonishing, magical quality. They reach a place very rare in contemporary cinema, and are quite unlike the films of any other auteur. Borowczyk's films create their own space, with imagery, sounds and music of a really exceptional power.\n\nLa Bête (a.k.a. The Beast, The Beast in Heat and Deaths Ecstasy, 1975) was Walerian Borowczyks most controversial film, a mixture of French farce, surrealism, and a lot of sex (including bestiality). The story of La Bête involves an American heiress Lucy Broadhurst (Lisbeth Hummel) being brought to a French chateau with her aunt Virginia (Elisabeth Kaza) by the scheming owners (in particular the marquis, Pierre de lEsperance [played by Guy Tréjan]), who need to marry her to the earthy, degenerate (and somewhat backward) son of the family Mathurin (Pierre Benedetti) in order to circumvent a will whichll keep the family home intact.\n\nThats the framing story, about grasping aristocrats, decadent morality, degenerate priests and sexually repressed young women. This part of the films set in the 20th century, though its not the conventional modern, urban world of most movies. La Bête takes place exclusively at the French chateau and its grounds (the film is in French, but there is English dialogue - Virginia, Lucy and their chauffeur speak English).\n\nThe appendices include a note on fairy tales, and on other versions of Beauty and the Beast (including the Jean Cocteau movie, and the 1991 Walt Disney musical movie).\n\nThis 3rd edition has been expanded and revised.\n\nHardcover with a colour laminated cover.\n\nFully illustrated, with over 120 stills from The Beast, and Walerian Borowczyk's movies, plus influences, a bibliography, filmography, appendices, quotes from Borowczyk and notes. 292pp.\n\nwww.crmoon.com\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAcknowledgements  10\n\n1 The Cinema of Walerian Borowczyk  16\n\n2 The Beast  133\n\nAppendices\n\nQuotes By Walerian Borowczyk  237\n\nOther Versions of Beauty and the Beast  239\n\nA Note On Fairy Tales  255\n\nFilmography: The Beast  272\n\nFilmography: Other Movies Directed By\n\nWalerian Borowczyk  274\n\nFilmography: Other Movie Projects Directed By Walerian Borowczyk  277\n\nBibliography  278\n\nHARDBACK\n\n£19.99 / $29.99 (Trade terms: 35%).\n\n.\n\nIMMORAL TALES\n\nWALERIAN BOROWCZYK\n\nPOCKET MOVIE GUIDE\n\nBy Jeremy Mark Robinson\n\nWalerian Borowczyk (1923-2006) is one of cinema's great talents. Quite simply, there is no filmmaker quite like Boro. Borowczyk's films have an astonishing, magical quality. They reach a place very rare in contemporary cinema, and are quite unlike the films of any other auteur. Borowczyk's films create their own space, with imagery, sounds and music of a really exceptional power.\n\nImmoral Tales (Contes Immoraux, 1974) is a masterpiece. Made in French, it was a collection of four erotic stories: La Marée (The Tide), based on a story by Walerian Borowczyks friend André Pieyre de Mandiargues (from Mascarets, published by Gallimard); Thérèse Philosophe, about a young woman locked up in a room who Þnds escape in masturbation; Erzsébet Báthory, about the original Countess Dracula; and Lucrezia Borgia, a story of the decadent, Italian Renaissance dynasty of the Borgias.\n\nImmoral Tales is the Þrst of the movies helmed by Walerian Borowczyk that contain a lot of erotic scenes. After Immoral Tales, Borowczyk would be associated with arty erotica.\n\nImmoral Tales came about when producer Anatole Dauman asked Boro for some short Þlms with an erotic element to put together as an anthology (several of Daumans Þlms had a sexual ingredient ­ The Tin Drum, In the Realm of the Senses, Fruits of Passion, etc). Boro would later contribute to the anthology TV series Série Rose in the late Eighties.\n\nImmoral Tales travelled back in time: the Þrst story, La Marée (The Tide), was set in the present, the following stories moved back to the late 19th century (1890), to 1610 for Countess Dracula, and Þnally to Renaissance times with the Borgias (to 1498). The Þrst episode was set in Northern France. The second Þlm was also set in rural France. The third Þlm, about Countess Dracula, moved to Eastern Europe, and the Þnal movie to late Þfteenth century Italy.\n\nFully illustrated, with over 150 stills from Immoral Tales, and Walerian Borowczyk's other movies, plus a bibliography, filmography, appendices, quotes from Borowczyk and notes. 252pp.\n\nHardcover with a colour laminated cover.\n\nwww.crmoon.com\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAcknowledgements - 8\n\nP A R T O N E - W A L E R I A N B O R O W C Z Y K\n\n1 The Cinema of Walerian Borowczyk - 21\n\nP A R T T W O - I M M O R A L T A L E S\n\n1 Immoral Tales - 66\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nQuotes By Walerian Borowczyk - 227\n\nFilmography: Immoral Tales - 229\n\nOther Movies Directed By Walerian Borowczyk - 229\n\nBibliography - 241\n\nHARDBACK\n\n£19.99 / $29.99 (Trade terms: 35%).\n\nFORTHCOMING\n\nessays on feminism & cinema by Maggie Humm\n\nSupergroups\n\nPunk Rock\n\n100 Best Movies\n\nSteven Spielbeg\n\nStanley Kubrick\n\nFrancis Coppola\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nWalt Disney\n\nCensorship\n\nEuropean Art Cinema\n\nThe New Hollywood\n\nMENU\n\nHarry Potter: The Books, The FIlms, The Cultural Phenomenon\n\nJ.R.R.
