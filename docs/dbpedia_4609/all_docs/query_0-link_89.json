        "text": "Lovely period composition in \"First Love.\"\n\nWhat most viewers are likely to notice about the stories off the bat is that, for the most part, they are not all that \"macabre\" - not the majority of them, anyway. This is not the fault of the original productions, which were never intended to be such a thing. The title imposed on the series by Trans World was surely suggested by Lee's presiding, but THEATRE MACABRE inspires expectations that most of these stories never set out to fulfill - indeed, the very first episode (\"First Love,\" scripted by one of my Polish masters, Andrzej Wajda) is so singularly unsuited to the given theme that some viewers may be angered by it, as they are left wondering how the hell it qualifies. However, several others do accommodate the strange, the bizarre, the exotic, the unusual - and there are several real gems, including two stories adapted and directed by another of my masters, Andrzej Zuławski, at the outset of his career. I opened this review as I did to help others understand why the overall scope of these stories may have found in me a more receptive viewer than most. From the very beginning, I found myself consistently charmed and intrigued by the actors (the pretty actresses and the wonderful character players), impressed by the humble but sincere craftsmanship enriching all levels of an understated production, and pleased by all their varied approaches to storytelling. Without exception, I found myself happy to watch three episodes at a time.\n\nThe Greek peasant parents of a child who is about to learn\n\nan unpleasant life lesson in the absorbing story \"Mateo Falcone.\"\n\nSeverin Films doesn't provide an enclosure to help us identify the stories, to tell us which stories they are or who wrote them, or indeed who wrote and directed them, and at present, the IMDb isn't much more helpful. So I took the trouble of going through every episode and jotting down the pertinent information. Alas, the cast acknowledgements are usually limited to only two names and we are not told who these actors played.\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1. First Love. 10-01-71. Directed by Sylvester Checinski.

Directed and adapted by Janusz Majewski, from the story by Ambrose Bierce. Ewa Krzyzewska, Jsef Duriasz.\n\nJerzy Jogałła as the Malayan servant in \"The Song of Triumphant Love.\"\n\nIf I remember correctly, all but two of the episodes are period pieces, which lends itself quite well to a storytelling anthology. One of the rare modern episodes is Janusz Majewski's unorthodox adaptation of Poe's \"The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Feather,\" which is more creative than satisfying; another is Ewa and Czeslaw Petelsky's go at Wilde's \"The Canterville Ghost,\" which isn't as witty as the original story but makes inventive use of color in the same manner as David Lean's film of Noël Coward's BLITHE SPIRIT (1945).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the very best episodes collected here are the two by Zuławski, which he scripted with his father. Both tales involve music and love as their themes, but only the second is fantastic (even \"macabre\") in nature. \"Pavoncello\" (1967) is the story of a young violinist, impoverished and still a virgin, who is taken out of himself by the untouchable beauty of a young woman present at one of his performances. His rising ambitions are dashed when he learns that she is married to an older man of title, but she later approaches him with a whispered invitation to a night of love - a sublime encounter that leads to a bitter disclosure. On the whole, \"Pavoncello\" is minor Zuławski but there is one remarkable moment that makes it essential: at one point in the story, when the two principals entwine during a putative violin lesson, Zuławski achieves a single galvanizing visual that realizes everything the story means to impart, materially and symbolically - an extremely rare achievement. A nice companion piece to the THEATRE MACABRE version is the original broadcast version, in Polish but without subtitles, which can be found on YouTube.\n\nHowever, \"The Song of Triumphant Love\" vaults well beyond it; this one is full-strength Zuławski and, I believe, a genuine masterpiece of the short form. A full-blown Gothic, it's the story of a love triangle between a man and his wife and a long-lost friend, who arrives unexpected one night on a foam-flecked horse in the company of his mute Malayan servant. The friend has returned after his journeys have taken him to most of the countries and mysteries around the globe - an itinerary that began when his host's wife made her choice of which of the two men was to be her husband. During their dinner together, the Malayan performs a song with magical properties as their entertainment... and strange things begin to happen. As I was watching \"The Song of Triumphant Love,\" I was wondering how I might best describe the power and magic it wields without spoiling it - and it came to me: Imagine if THE REPTILE had been directed by Terence Fisher at the peak of his powers rather than John Gilling. This is not a precise analogy because it's nothing to do with reptiles or transformations, but I believe the analogy is sound. From the moment she first appeared, Beata Tyskiewicz seemed to me Poland's answer to Veronica Carlson, and then everything else gradually fell into place. For me, this one episode transcends everything else in this box set. Thankfully available for comparative purposes is the original Polish broadcast version, which can be found on Vimeo, again without subtitles - though I must say, this one loses much more soul than the other when deprived of color.\n\nWladyslaw Jarema in Jan Laskowski's \"Tell Tale Hearts.\"\n\nAlso worthy of particular praise is Jan Laskowski's adaptation of Poe's much-filmed \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" though the plurality of its given title is incomprehensible. From the very opening, Laskowski weaves a spell of eerie malignancy with the central performance of young, handsome Olgierd Lukaszewicz as his youthful narcissism is offended by the genuinely hideous eye of the elderly Wladyslaw Jarema. Unfortunately the story builds to the inevitable arrival of the suspicious police, portrayed so many times in more familiar films, and here Laskowski loses his tight grip on the story's reins and commits the artistic crime of closing with a freeze-frame instead of giving us one last macabre image worth striving for.\n\nAlso notable are two adaptations of tales by the much-overlooked Alex Tolstoy, whose \"Family of the Wurdalak\" inspired both Mario Bava's \"Wurdalak\" episode of BLACK SABBATH and Giorgio Ferroni's NIGHT OF THE DEVILS. \"The Vampire\" is the tongue-in-cheek story of a prospective groom who is approached by a stranger at a gathering honoring his engagement who is warned that his prospective mother-in-law is a literal blood-sucker. There is a streak of Gogolian humor in the story, as well as some Expressionistic touches, and it touches on some of the same slippery pleasures as Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS - definitely worth a look. As for the other A. Tolstoy adaptation, Stanislaw Lenartowicz' \"The Actress,\" it is the only story in the set that didn't work for me on any level."
