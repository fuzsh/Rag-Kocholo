        "text": "Whether as the creator of extraordinary animated films, weird wood and paper sculptures, surreal paintings and lithographs, or as director of erotic fairy tales, the oeuvre of Walerian Borowczyk, who has died aged 82, always displayed an audacious individuality, a macabre wit, vivid, often disconcerting, imagination and a highly decorative style.\n\nBorn in Poland, Borowczyk studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow, winning Poland's national prize in 1953 for his lithographic work. In 1955 he began designing posters for Polish films, and two years later became a co-animator (with Jan Lenica) on a number of short cartoons. These included Dom (Home, 1958), which depicted the fantasies of a woman waiting alone at home, composed of different techniques such as a pixilated wig roaming the kitchen, and a live-action woman making love to a male mannequin which disintegrated beneath her passion.\n\nIn 1959 Borowczyk settled in Paris, where he made most of his films and spent the rest of his life. Notable among the first animated shorts he made in France were Renaissance (1963), the reconstruction of destroyed objects using reverse motion, and the nightmarish Jeux des Anges (Game of Angels, 1965), an elegy for the victims of Auschwitz using cut-out graphics.\n\nBorowczyk's sense of cruelty and fear, conveyed through fine line drawing, was evident in his first full-length film, The Concert of Mr and Mrs Kabal (1963), which revolved around a couple; the husband a dreamer and lover of butterflies, the wife a huge matron with the head of a vulture. Given his surreal vision, it is not surprising that Borowczyk received the Max Ernst prize in 1967.\n\nIn 1968 he made his first live-action feature, Goto, Island of Love, in which he pursued the bitterly ironic surrealist vein of his animated films. Despite the director's claim that it was \"a realistic film\", it created an absurd and frightening world, full of nostalgic paraphernalia such as music boxes, phonographs and ancient instruments of torture. The film featured Borowczyk's Polish wife, Ligia Branice, as the errant wife of a cruel dictator.\n\nBranice starred again in the title role of Blanche (1972), which began Borowczyk's series of erotic and decorative period pieces, usually set in the middle ages. Borowczyk gave the film the look of tapestry or medieval painting, against which Branice, compared to a white dove throughout, flutters gently and beautifully as the heroine married off to an aged nobleman (Michel Simon), who keeps her heavily guarded - though not enough to stop three young men penetrating the castle.\n\nBorowczyk's fascination with the iconography of erotica and subconscious emotions - he himself had a small sex museum - continued with Immoral Tales (1974), four bawdy stories depicted with characteristic visual richness. The film, something of a succes de scandale, showed a girl discovering the joys of masturbation from a book of erotic engravings, Lucrezia Borgia making love to Pope Alexander VI and the Countess Bathory (played by Paloma Picasso) bathing in the blood of murdered girls.\n\nBorowczyk returned briefly to Poland to make The Story of a Sin (1975). This was a period melodrama with a fetishistic use of shoes and underwear set in turn-of-the century Poland and about a seduced and abandoned teenage girl.\n\nBack in France, The Beast (1975), in which a woman is sexually aroused by a mythological monster, half bear, half wolf, provided a host of Freudian symbols, while getting Borowczyk the reputation in some quarters as a purveyor of soft porn - something he did nothing to discourage. Despite the antecedents of Behind Convent Walls (1977), Lulu (1980), Dr Jekyll and His Women (1981) - in which Mr Hyde sports a large phallus - and The Art of Love (1983) being Stendhal, Wedekind, Robert Louis Stevenson and Ovid respectively, the boundary between art and exploitation in Borowczyk's movies was becoming more blurred. But as he once said, \"Film is a security valve for instincts that are condemned. The individual reveals himself outwardly, releases himself and hurts no one. He identifies with what he sees, kills via an intermediary and lives an experience through the cinema.\"\n\nBorowczyk, who never regained the favourable critical consensus of his earlier films, claimed to have made films that excited him - and made a profit. His wife survives him."
