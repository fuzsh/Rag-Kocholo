Here I outline a number of new trends in philosophical theorizing about time, detailing how the various contributions fit into the picture. I argue that there has been a potentially misleading tendency to separate the debate over the passage of time from the debate over the reality of tense. This has obscured a number of interesting philosophical questions. One of the aims of this volume is to bring these two issues together, where they belong. I argue that many contributions to it go in the right direction. The contributions to this volume also establish uncharted philosophical junctures between Metaphysics, Aesthetics, Morality, and the Philosophy of Mind.\n\nLa métaphysique analytique du temps a vu un grand progrès pendant les derniers cent ans, après la publication de l'article de 1908 intitulé « L'irréalité du temps 1 » de John McTaggart.

Le développement des débats nous a apporté beaucoup de concepts utiles pour analyser et articuler le problème du temps, et rendu possible de bien positionner les différents statuts philosophiques : le théoricien A contre le théoricien B, le présentiste, le futur ouvert, l'éterniste, etc.. Dans cet exposé, nous allons essayer d'appliquer à Bergson les schèmes ainsi ultérieurement familiarisés, tout en sachant que c'est un projet expressément anachronique. Et même s'il se positionne mal dans les catégories toutes faites de nos jours, ce que nous attendons, mais cela ne doit pas impliquer pour autant l'incommensurabilité futile entre les deux traditions philosophiques. Bien sûr, notre but ici n'est pas non plus de critiquer McTaggart de la part de Bergson, à cause de sa soi-disant spatialisation du temps, parce que, comme nous allons voir, la linéarisation du temps est elle-même impliquée dans le fonctionnement réel du temps, et non pas une simple illusion arbitraire. Nous voulons faire confronter les deux philosophes, justement pour ouvrir un débat virtuel, qui pourrait être fécond pour tous les deux. 0-1. Série A et série B Commençons par la fameuse distinction de la série A et la série B. Notre langue porte deux groupes de terme qui désignent le rapport temporel de manière systématiquement différente : par exemple d'un côté, on prononce hier, aujourd'hui ou demain, etc. et de l'autre côté, le jour précédent, ou le lendemain, etc. Les derniers termes indiquent un jour en relations avec d'autres jours, dans la série successive du précédent et le suivant. Cette série se nomme série B. Et le premier groupe, qui contient l'indication démonstrative, et dont le référent par conséquent dépend du contexte où le terme se prononce, s'appelle la série A. Et ces deux séries constituent le temps réel en se combinant. 0-2. Théorie B et Théorie A : le présent Les théoriciens B considèrent la série A comme une fantôme illusoire subjective. Le temps réel est 1 J. Ellis McTaggart, 'The Unreality of Time', Mind, 17 (1908): 457–74.\n\nAccording to A-theories of time, the metaphysical ground of change and dynamicity is provided by a continuous shifting in which events are past, present and future (A-determinations).

It is often claimed that these theories make better sense of our experience of dynamicity than their rival, the B-theories; according to the latter, dynamicity is grounded solely in the irreducible earlier-than relations (B-relations) which obtain between events or states of affairs. In this paper, I argue that the experience of time's dynamicity, on the contrary, cannot be accounted for solely in terms of representations of irreducible A-determinations, because any representation which is adequate to ground these experiences must itself involve representation of irreducible B-relations, while it needs not involve representation of A-determinations. Even if, as a matter of contingent fact, our experiences of dynamicity consisted of representations of successions of A-determinations, what would account for them being experiences of dynamicity would be solely the B-theoretic relations of succession, rather than the irrelevant A-theoretic nature of the relata.\n\nTime is a complex and abstract concept in metaphysics.

Despite its research to verify its essence, existence, and realness, a Cambridge Philosopher by the name of J.E. McTaggart has published his paper, and through the title of his paper, he concluded and proved the ‘The Unreality of Time.’ This metaphysical idea is supported by his claim that time can be expressed in three possible time series – the A-Series, B – Series, and C – Series. Through these time series, he proves that both B – Series and C – Series, by itself are impossible to portray time series. However, A – Series possessed incoherence through its qualities.\n\nMeanwhile, the concept of the Unreality of Time can be applied in the Filipino Concept of Time, where they have been known as persons who are unpunctual towards to time schedule that can be a factor of the nation’s struggle for progress, unlike Westerners. In this study, we can relate the proofs of McTaggarts towards the Unreality of Time, as well, like the Filipinos, which can be generalized into Oriental Philosopher, their attitude towards time; based on research of Leonardo Mercado, unlike Westerners, Oriental Philosophers, where Filipinos as Oriental race can be included, as persons who value time as cyclical, where they based their calculation on their nature. It means that instead of linear calculation, they perform calculations based on the movement of nature and gut feeling.\n\nThis research paper has proven that time is as abstract as may seem, that its real essence cannot be profoundly measured as it is, we must look at it as it is something to be mystical and affective.\n\nJonathan Lowe has an argument against McTaggart’s conclusion that time isn’t real.

For Lowe, McTaggart’s argument requires the use of the predicate “e is present” for past or future events, and that can’t be done. Therefore, McTaggart doesn’t prove neither that A-series is contradictory or that time is unreal. Lowe’s argument has a price, since it assumes that you can’t think about time from the point of view of nowhen. Lowe’s argument also has a bonus – an abduction of the reality of time from the involuntariness of when we are.\n\nJohn Philoponus produced an influential argument that time must have had a beginning.

While that argument has been widely discussed, particularly in its Kantian form, little attention has been paid to his view of the nature of time, which is contained in his exposition of Aristotle. Yet the argument seems to rest on his view of the nature of time. I produce a sketch of his dynamic and relationist account of time and explain how it can overcome various problems raised by Aristotle. I also explain how, with a little help from Damascius, he could have overcome a problem raised for dynamic theories of time by McTaggart and Smart. I argue that it might well be possible to modernise his view in the light of modern science.\n\nIn this article, we will attempt to continue the proposal of a solution to McTaggart's paradox on the basis of a return to a line of analysis traceable back to Dummett, and its complementation with certain tenets of Merleau-Pontyan... more\n\nIn this article, we will attempt to continue the proposal of a solution to McTaggart's paradox on the basis of a return to a line of analysis traceable back to Dummett, and its complementation with certain tenets of Merleau-Pontyan phenomenology. With this aim, we will have to deepen the positions of the author of Truth and other enigmas which point towards an objection against one “complete description” of reality and favour, on the contrary, a plurality of “maximal descriptions”. Our attempt must not, however, adopt a “pluralism” which can be targeted by Nicholas Smith's objections, to whom, in turn, we will reply by making appeal to the phenomenological notion of “synthesis of transition”. We will conclude that the “pluralism” of temporal descriptions that allows us to escape from McTaggart's paradox is not incompatible with the requisite of “composibility” posed by Smith.\n\nI’ve recently been interested in the question of the extent to which our contemporary predicament of exhausted futurity corresponds to this historical denial of time in science and philosophy.

In my work as part of the Posthuman Aesthetics research project at Aarhus University, I’ve explored various aspects of contemporary culture’s dispositions toward the future. One characterization that keeps coming back is the idea that contemporary culture is in a crisis of futurity. In the Anthropocene, it is now common to hear theorists lament culture’s inability to imagine a future beyond capitalism and climate catastrophe. My starting point for the ideas in this paper was the question: to what extent does this exhaustion of futurity result from civilization's progressive denial of time? Science reads as a gradual questioning of previous assumptions derived from evolutionary conditioning. From Parmenides to Einstein, this process has led us to question the existence of time. But to what extent is this relevant for understanding the current age’s exhaustion of futurity? If we don’t believe that time exists, then how should we orient ourselves toward a future? Why even try to change our predicament?"
