McTaggart argued that if time is to exist, it must exist in one of two ways. Either the A or the B-series. The A-series is crucial to the B-series. It consists of the relations of past, present, and future. Contemporary physical models of the universe suggest that every bit of carbon in this universe is a product of the big bang. Being itself is composed of tiny supersymmetric strings. Pragmatically speaking, what this suggests is a living now. If the big bang thesis is correct, there is no future out there, time is isomorphic our expanding universe. The current moment is as close as we can get. McTaggart forces us to choose which series: a tensed, static view of time, or a non-tensed dynamic one. The future does not exist, then his tripartite relation does not hold. After examining at the twin paradox, it looks as if the most viable option given a scientific perspective would be a tensed, dynamic account of time.\n\nKeywords: Philosophy of time, McTaggart, Time, Metaphysics"
