I argue that McTaggart's analysis of time requires that a subject exist within the A-series, and as such lends itself to a Heideggerian conception of time, viewed both through Being and Time and Heidegger's interpretation of Aristotle's theory, that necessitates a 'personal' temporality in order to make 'world-time' intelligible.  I also suggest that Heidegger's temporaility, formulated as a non-successive unity grounded in Dasein's existential constitution as being-in-the-world, circumvents McTaggart's preemptive charge of circularity and therefore also avoids the conclusion that time is unreal.",
