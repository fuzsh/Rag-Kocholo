        "text": "Philosophy in recent times\n\nFor the book by Roger Scruton, see Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey.\n\nModern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific doctrine or school (and thus should not be confused with Modernism), although there are certain assumptions common to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.[1]\n\nThe 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may not have ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these questions will determine the scope of one's use of the term \"modern philosophy.\"\n\nModern Western philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Early modern philosophy and Late modern philosophy\n\nHow much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed:[2] the Early Renaissance is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later High Renaissance. Later, by the 17th and 18th centuries the major figures in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups. The \"Rationalists,\" mostly in France and Germany, argued all knowledge must begin from certain \"innate ideas\" in the mind. Major rationalists were Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Nicolas Malebranche. The \"Empiricists,\" by contrast, held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience. Major figures in this line of thought are John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume (These are retrospective categories, for which Kant is largely responsible). Ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories, though all these philosophers worked in ethics, in their own distinctive styles. Other important figures in political philosophy include Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century Immanuel Kant set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system which claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism. Whether or not he was right, he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical dispute. Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century, beginning with German idealism. The characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories; it culminated in the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who among many other things said in the Preface to his Elements of the Philosophy of Right that \"The real is rational; the rational is real.\"\n\nHegel's work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics. Karl Marx appropriated both Hegel's philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain, transforming Hegel's ideas into a strictly materialist form, setting the grounds for the development of a science of society. Søren Kierkegaard, in contrast, dismissed all systematic philosophy as an inadequate guide to life and meaning. For Kierkegaard, life is meant to be lived, not a mystery to be solved. Arthur Schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires, and advocated atheism and pessimism. Schopenhauer's ideas were taken up and transformed by Nietzsche, who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim \"God is dead\" and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual. Nietzsche found in this not grounds for pessimism, but the possibility of a new kind of freedom.\n\n19th-century British philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of British Idealism, which incorporated neo-Hegelian and German Idealist thought. As a reaction against this, figures such as Bertrand Russell and George Edward Moore began moving in the direction of analytic philosophy, which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in logic of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege.\n\nRenaissance philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nRenaissance humanism emphasized the value of human beings (see Oration on the Dignity of Man) and opposed dogma and scholasticism. This new interest in human activities led to the development of political science with The Prince of Niccolò Machiavelli.[3] Humanists differed from Medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic, instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals. Renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by Leonardo da Vinci in his notebooks:\n\nAll of our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions\n\nThere is no certainty where one can neither apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those which are based upon the mathematical sciences.\n\nIn a similar way, Galileo Galilei based his scientific method on experiments but also developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. These two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of Empiricism and Rationalism respectively.[4]\n\nList of Renaissance philosophers:\n\nPico della Mirandola\n\nNicolas of Cusa\n\nGiordano Bruno\n\nGalileo Galilei\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli\n\nMichel de Montaigne\n\nFrancisco Suárez\n\nRationalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rationalism\n\nModern philosophy traditionally begins with René Descartes and his aphorism \"I think, therefore I am\". In the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism, written by theologians and drawing upon Plato, Aristotle, and early Church writings. Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false. In short, he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch. In his most important work, Meditations on First Philosophy, he attempts just this, over six brief essays. He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs, to determine what if anything he knows for certain. He finds that he can doubt nearly everything: the reality of physical objects, God, his memories, history, science, even mathematics, but he cannot doubt that he is, in fact, doubting. He knows what he is thinking about, even if it is not true, and he knows that he is there thinking about it. From this basis he builds his knowledge back up again. He finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone, but only from God; he proves that God exists. He then demonstrates that God would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything; in essence, he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning, as fallible but not false.\n\nList of rationalist philosophers:\n\nChristian Wolff\n\nRené Descartes\n\nBaruch Spinoza\n\nGottfried Leibniz\n\nEmpiricism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Empiricism\n\nEmpiricism is a theory of knowledge which opposes other theories of knowledge, such as rationalism, idealism and historicism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes (only or primarily) via sensory experience as opposed to rationalism, which asserts that knowledge comes (also) from pure thinking. Both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge, whereas historicism is a social epistemology. While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience, it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made. Empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies, and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical. Today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies. As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data \"speak for themselves\", while the competing views are opposed to this ideal. The term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy. It should also be constructed in a way which makes it possible to distinguish empiricism among other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship. In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts, which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.\n\nEmpiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge, known as epistemology. Empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or tradition[5] in contrast to, for example, rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge.\n\nList of empiricist philosophers:\n\nFrancis Bacon\n\nJohn Locke\n\nGeorge Berkeley\n\nDavid Hume\n\nPolitical philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Political philosophy\n\nPolitical philosophy is the study of such topics as politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of a legal code by authority: their nature and purpose; what (if anything) makes a government legitimate; what rights and freedoms (if any) it should protect and how and why it should do so; what duties (if any) citizens owe to a legitimate government; and when (if ever) it may be legitimately overthrown. In a vernacular sense, the term \"political philosophy\" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of philosophy.[6]\n\nList of political philosophers by country:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nJeremy Bentham\n\nThomas Carlyle\n\nThomas Hobbes\n\nJohn Locke\n\nJames Mill\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\n\nFrance\n\nMontesquieu\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nVoltaire\n\nItaly\n\nCesare Beccaria\n\nGiambattista Vico\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini\n\nGermany\n\nKarl Marx\n\nFriedrich Engels\n\nIdealism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Idealism\n\nIdealism refers to the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society.[7] As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.[8] Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. An extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of solipsism.\n\nList of idealist philosophers:\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nJohann Gottlieb Fichte\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\n\nArthur Schopenhauer\n\nT. H. Green\n\nFrancis Herbert Bradley\n\nJosiah Royce\n\nJ. M. E. McTaggart\n\nJohn Foster\n\nExistentialism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Existentialism\n\nExistentialism is generally considered to be the philosophical and cultural movement which holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. Building on that, existentialists hold that moral thinking and scientific thinking together do not suffice to understand human existence, and, therefore, a further set of categories, governed by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to understand human existence.[9][10][11]\n\nList of existentialist philosophers:\n\nSøren Kierkegaard\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nJean-Paul Sartre\n\nSimone de Beauvoir\n\nKarl Jaspers\n\nGabriel Marcel\n\nMartin Heidegger\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn\n\nPhenomenology\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Phenomenology (philosophy) and Existential phenomenology\n\nPhenomenology is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad philosophical movement founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. The philosophy then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.[12]\n\nList of phenomenologist:\n\nEdmund Husserl\n\nMartin Heidegger\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty\n\nMax Scheler\n\nPragmatism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pragmatism\n\nPragmatism is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and applied back to practice to form what is called intelligent practice.[citation needed] Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism, radical empiricism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, and fallibilism.[citation needed] There is general consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and insights of modern science into account.[13] Charles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) deserves most of the credit for pragmatism,[14] along with later twentieth century contributors William James and John Dewey.[13]\n\nList of pragmatist philosophers:\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce\n\nWilliam James\n\nJohn Dewey\n\nRichard Rorty\n\nAnalytic philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Analytic philosophy\n\nAnalytic philosophy came to dominate English-speaking countries in the 20th century. In the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand, the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as \"analytic\" departments.[15] The term generally refers to a broad philosophical tradition[16][17] characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument (often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis of language) and a respect for the natural sciences.[18][19][20]\n\nList of analytic philosophers:\n\nRudolf Carnap\n\nGottlob Frege\n\nGeorge Edward Moore\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nMoritz Schlick\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\n\nModern Asian philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nVarious philosophical movements in Asia arose in the modern period including:\n\nNew Confucianism\n\nMaoism\n\nBuddhist modernism\n\nKyoto school\n\nNeo-Vedanta\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nPhilosophy portal"
