        "text": "J.M.E. McTaggart seeks to critically expound and appraise the British philosopherâs thought with respect to three principal themes of his philosophy: substance, self, and immortality. Ramesh Kumar Sharma guides the reader through the labyrinths of McTaggartâs intricate arguments and defends many of McTaggartâs highly unorthodox doctrines and conclusions. While doing this, Sharma draws on the works of, among others, Berkeley, Hegel, and Leibniz, and at the same time attacks numerous modern-day physicalist theories that propound mind-brain identity as against the presumed reality of the self and consciousness. This work is thus recommended both for philosophers and researchers interested in: (1) such perennial metaphysical subjects as reality, existence, possibility, the basic ontological categories of substance, qualities, and relations (universals); (2) the question of the reality of the self; (3) McTaggartâs overall vision of the universe or Absolute, and his rejection of the more or less predominant view that the Absolute is God; (4) McTaggartâs unique doctrine, after Plato, of the immortality of the self combined with (the self âs) pre-existence, post-existence, and plurality of lives; and (5) his extraordinary, but important, views on perception."
