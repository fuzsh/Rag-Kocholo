        "text": "1. Western Phılosophy ın modern culture\n\n2. Western Philosophy Western philosophy encompasses the philosophical thought and work of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with the ancient Greek philosophy of the pre-Socratics. The word philosophy itself originated from the Ancient Greek philosophía (φιλοσοφία), literally, \"the love of wisdom\" Ancient Greek: φιλεῖν phileîn, \"to love\" and σοφία sophía, \"wisdom\").\n\n3. Hıstory of Western Phılosophy  The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as pure mathematics and natural sciences such as physics, astronomy, and biology (Aristotle, for example, wrote on all of these topics).\n\n4. Pre-Socratics Main article: Pre-Socratic philosophy THE PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS WERE INTERESTED IN COSMOLOGY; THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE, WHILE REJECTING MYTHICAL ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS.THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN THE ARCHE (THE CAUSE OR FIRST PRINCIPLE) OF THE WORLD. THE FIRST RECOGNIZED PHILOSOPHER, THALES OF MILETUS (BORN C. 625 BCE IN IONIA) IDENTIFIED WATER AS THE ARCHE (CLAIMING \"ALL IS WATER\"). HIS USE OF OBSERVATION AND REASON TO DERIVE THIS CONCLUSION IS THE REASON FOR DISTINGUISHING HIM AS THE FIRST PHILOSOPHER.[2] THALES' STUDENT ANAXIMANDER CLAIMED THAT THE ARCHE WAS THE APEIRON, THE INFINITE. FOLLOWING BOTH THALES AND ANAXIMANDER, ANAXIMENES OF MILETUS CLAIMED THAT AIR WAS THE MOST SUITABLE CANDIDATE. IONIA, SOURCE OF EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHY, IN WESTERN ASIA MINOR PYTHAGORAS (BORN C. 570 BCE), FROM THE ISLAND OF SAMOS OFF THE COAST OF IONIA, LATER LIVED IN CROTON IN SOUTHERN ITALY (MAGNA GRAECIA). PYTHAGOREANS HOLD THAT \"ALL IS NUMBER\", GIVING FORMAL ACCOUNTS IN CONTRAST TO THE PREVIOUS MATERIAL OF THE IONIANS. THE DISCOVERY OF CONSONANT INTERVALS IN MUSIC BY THE GROUP ENABLED THE CONCEPT OF HARMONY TO BE ESTABLISHED IN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT OPPOSITES COULD TOGETHER GIVE RISE TO NEW THINGS.[3] THEY ALSO BELIEVED IN METEMPSYCHOSIS, THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS, OR REINCARNATION.\n\n5. Hellenistic and Roman philosophy Map of Alexander the Great's empire and the route he and Pyrrho of Elis took to India Main articles: Hellenistic philosophy and Ancient Roman philosophy The Hellenistic and Roman Imperial periods saw the continuation of Aristotelianism and Cynicism, and the emergence of new philosophies, including Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Neopythagoreanism. Platonism also continued but came under new interpretations, particularly Academic skepticism in the Hellenistic period and Neoplatonism in the Imperial period. The traditions of Greek philosophy heavily influenced Roman philosophy. In Imperial times, Epicureanism and Stoicism were particularly popular\n\n6. Western philosophy Main article: Western philosophy  Statue of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), a major figure of ancient Greek philosophy, in Aristotle's Park, Stagira.  Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world, dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in 6th-century Greece (BCE), such as Thales (c. 624 – c. 545 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' (Latin: philosophia)[47] and were also termed 'students of nature' (physiologoi).  Western philosophy can be divided into three eras:  Ancient (Greco-Roman).  Medieval philosophy (referring to Christian European thought).  Modern philosophy (beginning in the 17th century).\n\n7. Modern Main article: Modern philosophy  The term \"modern philosophy\" has multiple usages. For example, Thomas Hobbes is sometimes considered the first modern philosopher because he applied a systematic method to political philosophy.[56][57] By contrast, René Descartes is often considered the first modern philosopher because he grounded his philosophy in problems of knowledge, rather than problems of metaphysics.[58]  Portrait of René Descartes, after Frans Hals, second half of 17th century  Portrait of John Locke, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1697  Modern philosophy and especially Enlightenment philosophy[59] is distinguished by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the Church, academia, and Aristotelianism;[60][61] a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system-building;[62][63] and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy.\n\n8. Early modern (17th and 18th centuries) Main articles: 17th-century philosophy, Age of Enlightenment, and Early modern philosophy  Some central topics of Western philosophy in its early modern (also classical modern period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.These trends first distinctively coalesce in Francis Bacon's call for a new, empirical program for expanding knowledge, and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of René Descartes.[68]  Descartes's epistemology was based on a method called Cartesian doubt, whereby only the most certain belief could act as the foundation for further inquiry, with each step to further ideas being as cautious and clear as possible. This led him to his famous maxim cogito ergo sum ('I think, therefore I exist'), though similar arguments had been made by earlier philosophers.[70] This became foundational for much of further Western philosophy, as the need to find a route from the private world of consciousness to the externally existing reality was widely accepted until the 20th century. A major issue for his thought remained in the mind–body problem, however.[70] One solution to the problem was presented by Baruch Spinoza, who argued that the mind and the body are one substance.This was based on his vıew that God and the universe are one and the same, encompassing the totality of existence.In the other extreme, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, argued instead that the world was composed of numerous individual substances, called monads. Together, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are considered influential early rationalists.[\n\n9. Modern era of Phılosophy  Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes (1596–1650). Following the rise of natural science, modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.  19th-century philosophy (sometimes called late modern philosophy) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed \"the Enlightenment\", and includes figures such as Hegel, a key figure in German idealism; Kierkegaard, who developed the foundations for existentialism; Thomas Carlyle, representative of the great man theory; Nietzsche, a famed anti-Christian; John Stuart Mill, who promoted utilitarianism; Karl Marx, who developed the foundations for communism; and the American William James. The 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and the linguistic turn (see Contemporary philosophy).\n\n10. German idealism Main article: German idealism See also: British idealism and American idealism  German idealism emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s.  Transcendental idealism, advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that things-in- themselves existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.\n\n11. Western Phılosophy  The most notable work of absolute idealism was G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between \"being\" and \"not being\"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (\"being\" and \"not being\" are resolved with \"becoming\"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the \"Hegelian dialectic\".  Philosophers influenced by Hegel include Ludwig Feuerbach, who coined the term \"projection\" as pertaining to humans' inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; Karl Marx; Friedrich Engels; and the British idealists, notably T. H. Green, J. M. E. McTaggart, F. H. Bradley, and R. G. Collingwood.  Few 20th-century philosophers embraced the core tenets of German idealism after the demise of British idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic, most notably Frankfurt School critical theorists, Alexandre Kojève, Jean-Paul Sartre (in his Critique of Dialectical Reason), and Slavoj Žižek. A central theme of German idealism, the legitimacy of Kant's \"Copernican revolution\", remains an important point of contention in 21st-century post-continental philosophy.\n\n12. Late modern (19th century) Main article: 19th-century philosophy See also: Late modern period  Late modern philosophy is usually considered to begin around the pivotal year of 1781, when Gotthold Ephraim Lessing died and Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason appeared.[86] The 19th century saw the beginnings of what would later grow into the divide between Continental and analytic traditions of philosophy, with the former more interested in general frameworks of metaphysics (more common in the German- speaking world), and the latter focusing on issues of epistemology, ethics, law and politics (more common in the English-speaking world).[87]  German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system.[88] German idealists, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the members of Jena Romanticism (Friedrich Hölderlin, Novalis, and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel), transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.\n\n13. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (/ˈheɪɡəl/;[1][2] German: [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈheːɡl̩];[2][3] 27 August 1770 – 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher. He is considered one of the most important figures in German idealism and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. His influence extends to the entire range of contemporary philosophical issues, from epistemology and metaphysics to aesthetics, philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, political philosophy, and the history of philosophy.  Hegel was born in 1770 in Stuttgart, during the height of the Romantic period in Germany, and lived through and was influenced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. He attended the Tübinger Stift seminary with Friedrich Hölderlin and Friedrich Schelling, both of whom exerted a strong philosophical influence on him. His fame rests chiefly upon The Phenomenology of Spirit, The Science of Logic, and his lectures at the University of Berlin on topics from his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.  Hegel's philosophical system is divided into three parts: logic, the philosophy of nature, and the philosophy of spirit. In his Phenomenology, he introduces his philosophical system and exhibits the historical process through which spirit acquires an adequate concept of itself. In his Logic, as well as the Encyclopedia, which he compiled as a textbook for his lectures, he further expands upon the different parts of his system. Many of the ideas in his system are further elaborated upon in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right and in posthumously published lecture notes on the philosophy of art, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of world history, and the history of philosophy.  Hegel's influence on such diverse philosophical movements as Marxism and American Pragmatism, among others, continues to play out to this day in a variety of philosophical styles and traditions.\n\n14. Hegel argued that history was the dialectical journey of the Geist (universal mind) towards self-fulfilment and self-realization.[91] The Geist's self-awareness is absolute knowledge, which itself brings complete freedom. [92] His philosophy was based on absolute idealism, with reality itself being mental. [92] His legacy was divided between the conservative Right Hegelians and radical Young Hegelians, with the latter including David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach.[93] Feuerbach argued for a materialist conception of Hegel's thought, inspiring Karl Marx. Friedrich Nietzsche, photograph by Friedrich Hartmann, c. 1875 Arthur Schopenhauer was inspired by Kant and Indian philosophy.[94] Accepting Kant's division of the world into the noumenal (the real) and phenomenal (the apparent) realities, he nevertheless disagreed on the accessibility of former, arguing that it could in fact be accessed.[95] The experience of will was how this reality was accessible, with the will underlying the whole of nature, with everything else being appearance.[95] Whereas he believed the frustration of this will was the cause of suffering, Friedrich Nietzsche thought that the will to power was empowering, leading to growth and expansion, and therefore forming the basis of ethics.\n\n15. Pragmatism Main article: Pragmatism  Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870.[101] It asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with reality.[102] Charles Sanders Peirce and William James were its co-founders and it was later modified by John Dewey as instrumentalism. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualized final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion.  Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. It interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Inquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.[104]  For Peirce commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitless. The interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since. Peirce's maxim of pragmatism is, \"Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\"[105]  Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulness.[106] Pragmatist thinkers include Dewey, George Santayana, and C. I. Lewis.  Pragmatism was later worked on by neopragmatists Richard Rorty who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979),[107] Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. Neopragmatism has been described as a bridge between analytic and continental philosophy.[\n\n16. Contemporary Main articles: 20th-century philosophy and Contemporary philosophy  The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatism. They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.  The 20th century deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th-century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The publication of Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900–1) and Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy.[110] The 20th century also saw the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.\n\n17. Analytic philosophy Main article: Analytic philosophy  In the English-speaking world, analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. The term \"analytic philosophy\" roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non- classical logic and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Though the movement has broadened, it was a cohesive school in the first half of the century. Analytic philosophers were shaped strongly by logical positivism, united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to logic and language.\n\n18. Philosophy of science  The logical positivists of the Vienna Circle started as a study group of Russell and Whitehead.[123] They argued that the arguments of metaphysics, ethics and theology were meaningless, as they were not logically or empirically verifiable.[124] This was based on their division of meaningful statements into either the analytic (logical and mathematical statements) and the synthetic (scientific claims).[124] Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap argued that science rested at its roots on direct observation, but Otto Neurath noted that observation already requires theory in order to have meaning.[125] Another participant in the Circle was Carnap's self-confessed disciple, Willard Van Orman Quine.[126] In 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism', Quine criticized the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements.[127] Instead, he advocated for a 'web of belief' approach, whereby all beliefs come from contact with reality (including mathematical ones), but with some being further removed from this contact than others.  Another former participant in the Circle was Karl Popper. He argued that verificationism was logically incoherent, promoting instead falsificationism as the basis for science.[129] A further advancement in the philosophy of science was made by Imre Lakatos, who argued that negative findings in individual tests did not falsify theories, but rather entire research programmes would eventually fail explain phenomena.[130] Thomas Kuhn further argued that science was composed of paradigms, which would eventually shift when evidence accumulated against them.[131] Based on the idea that different paradigms had different meanings of expressions, Paul Feyerabend went further in arguing for relativism in science.\n\n19. Philosophy of language  Wittgenstein had first brought up the idea that ordinary language could solve philosophical problems.[133] A loosely associated group of philosophers later became known as practitioners of ordinary language philosophy.It included Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, R. M. Hare, and P. F. Strawson. They believed that as philosophy was not science, it could only be advanced through careful conceptual clarification and connection instead of observation and experimentation.[134] However, they had given up the earlier analytic pursuit of using formal logic to express an ideal language, but did nevertheless share the scepticism of metaphysical grand theories.[134] Unlike Wittgenstein, they believed only some problems of philosophy to be artifacts of language.[135] This approach has been described as the linguistic turn of analytic philosophy.[135] Ryle introduced the concept of category mistake, which described the misapplication of a concept in the wrong context (which he accused Descartes of doing with the ghost in the machine).[136] One of Austin's key insights was that some language perform a perlocutionary function (creating by themselves an effect on the world), thereby being speech acts.This idea was later taken up by John Searle.\n\n20.  In the final third of the 20th century, philosophy of language emerged as its own programme.[138] The theory of meaning became central to this programme.[139] Donald Davidson argued that meaning could be understood through a theory of truth.[140] This was based on the work of Alfred Tarski.[141] Empirically, Davidson would find the meaning of words in different languages by linking them with the objective conditions of their utterance, which established their truthness.[142] Meaning therefore emerges from the consensus of interpretations of speaker behaviour.[142] Michael Dummett argued against this view on the basis of its realism.[143] This was because realism would make the truthness of many sentences beyond measurability.[144] Instead, he argued for verifiability, based on the idea that one could recognise the proof of truth when offered it.[145] Alternative to these, Paul Grice put forward a theory that meaning was based on the intention of the speaker, which over time becomes established after repeated use.\n\n21. Philosophy of mind  Early identity theories of mind in the 1950s and '60s were based on the work of Ullin Place, Herbert Feigl, and J. J. C. Smart.[150] While earlier philosophers such as the Logical Positivists, Quine, Wittgenstein, and Ryle had all used some form of behaviorism to dispense with the mental, they believed that behaviorism was insufficient in explaining many aspects of mental phenomena.[150] Feigl argued that intentional states could not be thus explained.Instead, he espoused externalism.[151] Place meanwhile argued that the mind could be reduced to physical events, while Feigl and Sense agreed they were identical.[151] Functionalism in contrast argued that the mind was defined by what it does, rather than what it is based on.[152] To argue against this, John Searle developed the Chinese room thought experiment.[153] Davidson argued for anomalous monism, which claims that while mental events cause physical ones, and the all causal relations are governed by natural laws, there are however no natural laws governing the causality between mental and physical events.This anomaly in the name was explained by supervenience.\n\n22. In 1970, Keith Campbell proposed a \"new epiphenomenalism\", according to which the body produces the mind that does not act on the body, a process which he claims is destined to remain mysterious.[154] Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland argued for eliminative materialism, which claims that understanding the brain will lead to a complete understanding of the mind.[155] This was based on developments in neuroscience.[155] However, physicalist theories of mind have had to grapple with the issue of subjective experience raised by Thomas Nagel in What Is It Like to Be a Bat? and Frank Cameron Jackson's so-called knowledge argument.[156] David Chalmers also argued against physicalism in the philosophical zombie argument.[157] He further noted that subjective experience posed the hard problem of consciousness.[157] The inability of physicalist theories to explain conscious feeling has been termed the explanatory gap.[157] In contrast, Daniel Dennett has claimed that no such gap exists as subjective experiences are a 'philosophical fiction'.\n\n23. Other branches of Western Phılosophy  Notable students of Quine include Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett. The later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a \"new metaphysics\" of possible worlds, as in the influential work of David Lewis. Recently, the experimental philosophy movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.  Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, David Lewis, John Searle, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Michael Dummett, John McDowell, Saul Kripke, Peter van Inwagen, and Patricia Churchland.  Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of A Theory of Justice by John Rawls and Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick, analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with Roger Scruton, Nelson Goodman, Arthur Danto and others developing the subject to its current shape.\n\n24. Continental philosophy Main article: Continental philosophy  Continental philosophy is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe. 20th-century movements such as German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism, modern hermeneutics (the theory and methodology of interpretation), critical theory, structuralism, post- structuralism and others are included within this loose category. While identifying any non-trivial common factor in all these schools of thought is bound to be controversial, Michael E. Rosen has hypothesized a few common continental themes: that the natural sciences cannot replace the human sciences; that the thinker is affected by the conditions of experience (one's place and time in history); that philosophy is both theoretical and practical; that metaphilosophy or reflection upon the methods and nature of philosophy itself is an important part of philosophy proper.  The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective, while Martin Heidegger drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional existential approach to ontology.\n\n25. Existentialism Main article: Existentialism  Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th- century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,[168][169] shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject— not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.[170] In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \"the existential attitude\", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.[171] Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.  Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.\n\n26. Marxism and critical theory Main articles: Marxism and critical theory  Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis, originating from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. Marxist analyses and methodologies influenced political ideologies and social movements. Marxist understandings of history and society were adopted by academics in archeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology and philosophy.  In contemporary philosophy, the term \"critical theory\" describes the Western Marxist philosophy of the Frankfurt School, which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Critical theory maintains that ideology is the principal obstacle to human emancipation.\n\n27. Phenomenology and hermeneutics Main articles: Phenomenology (philosophy) and Hermeneutics  Edmund Husserl's phenomenology was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.[178] An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called intentionality.[179] Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich (Munich phenomenology) and Göttingen (Göttingen phenomenology). Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Martin Heidegger (formerly Husserl's research assistant and a proponent of hermeneutic phenomenology, a theoretical synthesis of modern hermeneutics and phenomenology), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism.\n\n28. Process philosophy Main article: Process philosophy  Process philosophy is a tradition beginning with Alfred North Whitehead, who began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined Harvard University in 1924.This tradition identifies metaphysical reality with change.  Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to continental philosophy than analytic philosophy, because it is usually only taught in continental departments.[181] However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus continental methods in contemporary philosophy."
