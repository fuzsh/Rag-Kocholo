Some forms of eternalism give time a similar ontology to that of space, as a dimension, with different times being as real as different places, and future events are \"already there\" in the same sense other places are already there, and that there is no objective flow of time.",

        "text": "In the philosophy of space and time, eternalism[1] is an approach to the ontological nature of time, which takes the view that all existence in time is equally real, as opposed to presentism or the growing block universe theory of time, in which at least the future is not the same as any other time.[2] Some forms of eternalism give time a similar ontology to that of space, as a dimension, with different times being as real as different places, and future events are \"already there\" in the same sense other places are already there, and that there is no objective flow of time.[3]\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as the \"block time\" or \"block universe\" theory due to its description of space-time as an unchanging four-dimensional \"block\", as opposed to the view of the world as a three-dimensional space modulated by the passage of time."
