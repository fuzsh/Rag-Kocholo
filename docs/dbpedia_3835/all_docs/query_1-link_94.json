        "text": "Brosnan was born on May 16, 1953, in Navan, in Ireland's County Meath. His father deserted his wife while Brosnan Jr was just an infant. His mother moved to England to work as a nurse. Four-year-old Brosnan was left in Ireland to be raised by his grandparents. As a child he had little contact with his mother (she returned to Ireland twice a year). When his grandparents died, seven years later, there was no room for Brosnan with other relatives, so he moved into lodgings where he shared a room with three full-grown men. Education came via a Christian Brothers school. He recalls:''They were dreadful human beings . . . the cruelness of their ways toward children. I learned nothing\n\nfrom the Christian Brothers - except shame.''\n\nThe one bright spot came\n\nfrom a visit to the cinema to\n\nsee his first Technicolor\n\nfilm - Goldfinger. He dreamed of escaping his life of drudgery. And escape he did. To the circus.\n\nEventually, though, he opted for conventional entertainment and joined an experimental theatre workshop in London. By 1976 he was making his London stage debut, in Wait Until Dark, and a year later made his TV debut in Murphy's Stroke.\n\nAfter a three-year wait, he secured his first film part, in The Long Good Friday. This had given Brosnan the taste for the movies and, in 1981, he moved to America. He quickly secured a starring role in the TV series Remington Steele, which was to run for five years. But during this, one night, he suffered an attack of Bell's palsy in the dressing room before appearing on The Tonight Show, hosted by Joan Rivers.\n\nBrosnan made a good recovery, so much so that he was even considered for the role of James Bond but had to turn it down because of contractual obligations to Remington Steele. Instead, Timothy Dalton became the next 007.\n\nBut one year later, he was stepping into the shoes of the super-suave spy, in Goldeneye. Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is not Enough followed. And a fourth (rumoured to be\n\nhis last Bond film) - Beyond the Ice - is due for release next year.\n\nBrosnan has stepped out of Bond's shoes for a number of films, including The Lawnmower Man (1992), Mrs Doubtfire (1993), The Mirror has two Faces (1996), Mars Attacks! (1996), Dante's Peak (1997), and The Thomas Crown Affair (1999).\n\nIt seemed Brosnan had finally found happiness.Unfortunately, it wasn't to last.\n\nHe had met, fallen in love with, and married actress Cassandra Harris (she played Countess Lisl in For Your Eyes Only in 1981). But in 1987 she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She battled for four years before succumbing to the disease. As she lay dying, her last words to Brosnan were: ''Always an actor.'' Her death devastated Brosnan. But her dying words gave him the strength to go on.\n\nHe continued acting, appearing in films, and started piecing together his private life.\n\nThen, in 1994, environmental journalist Keely Shaye-Smith interviewed Brosnan during a visit to Mexico. Five years later they announced plans to marry, although the wedding was postponed after Brosnan's son, Sean (from his first marriage), suffered serious injuries in a car accident last year.\n\nThe couple have since married and have two children - Dylan, four, and eight-month-old Paris.\n\nIt has been a long and troubled road for Brosnan but, at last, he seems to have found happiness.\n\nPierce Brosnan is James Bond\n\nin GoldenEye on ITV at 9.00pm."
