        "text": "There's a line from the movie Grey Owl, \"A man becomes what he dreams... you have dreamed well.\"\n\nSentimental… romantic… maybe? But applicable I think to a sixteen-year-old lad who was trying to find his way in life as he walked into a theatre arts lab in South London one night. So began my career as an actor at The Oval House Theatre. Soon I was performing on stage in the West End of London in the early 1970's, but I'm afraid it wasn't enough to leave a mark. I got lucky when I came to America. I was 27 years old and landed my first audition — a series called 'Remington Steele'. Life was good. I felt I could be anything I wanted to be. And what I wanted above all was to be in the movies. For me, acting is doing. My acting teacher Yat Malgram once said, \"nothing comes from nothing.\" I've had the opportunity and the good fortune to be part of this exciting tradition. Acting allows me to explore new worlds, to develop my craft, to create characters by delving into their lives, and ultimately to become someone else entirely.\n\nPierce Brosnan is a legendary Irish-American actor, film producer, environmentalist, philanthropist, artist and two-time Golden Globe Award nominee known for his rich and extensive career in front of the camera and behind-the-scenes.
