        "text": "He's known for playing suave Secret Service agent James Bond, but Pierce Brosnan traded in his signature slicked back strands for something a little more scruffy.\n\nThe 69-year-old actor was spotted wearing a gray wig with tendrils cascading down to his shoulders while walking on set of his latest film, \"Four Letters of Love.\"\n\nBrosnan stars alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Gabriel Bryne in the romantic flick, based on the Niall Williams bestselling novel of the same name.\n\nPIERCE BROSNAN NOT SURE WHO THE NEXT BOND WILL BE BUT SAYS ‘WHOEVER HE BE, I WISH HIM WELL’\n\nPierce stayed warm underneath a dark blue knit sweater in addition to a heavy trench coat. He wrapped a scarf around his neck for added comfort.\n\nPIERCE BROSNAN WISHES WIFE KEELY A HAPPY 21ST ANNIVERSARY IN TOUCHING INSTAGRAM TRIBUTE\n\nThe \"Mamma Mia!\" star sported a pair of forest green fingerless gloves and dark slacks.\n\nSalt-and-pepper stubble on his face matched a full head of shoulder-length straight hair.\n\nBrosnan and Bonham Carter will play the parents of Nicholas Coughlan (Finn O’Shea) and Isabel Gore (Ann Skelly).\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Nicholas and Isabel were made for each other, but how will they ever know it? As ghosts, fate and the sheer power of true love pull them together, so too does life threaten to tear them apart,\" a synopsis described the movie on IMDb.\n\nThe \"Black Adam\" star was born in Ireland and studied acting in London before moving to the United States in the '80s.\n\nHe starred on several stage and screen productions before landing his first Bond film, \"GoldenEye.\"\n\nThe 1995 film grossed $350 million worldwide. He returned as the British spy in the 1997 movie, \"Tomorrow Never Dies,\" and once again in 1999 for \"The World is Not Enough.\"\n\nHis fourth and final stint portraying 007 was in \"Die Another Day\" in 2002."
