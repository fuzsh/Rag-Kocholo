        "text": "Yes, werewolves designed by Andy Serkis’ Imaginarium Studios. Hell, even if you aren’t typically a fan of werewolf movies, you’ve gotta be excited about seeing that, right?\n\nLet’s see what Sean Brosnan has to say about working with his father on a movie like this:\n\n“I’m excited to be working with Pierce on a film that aims to redefine the werewolf sub-genre. With the amazing special effects talents at Imaginarium, we’ll craft a werewolf transformation set to rival the iconic scenes from An American Werewolf in London. We’re thrilled about the potential impact of an expanding Wolfland universe.”\n\nInvoking the name of An American Werewolf in London – and saying that your film will rival the transformation sequences in that movie, which are still considered among the very best ever committed to film – is quite the bold statement. Many have tried over the years, but few werewolf joints ever reach those delirious highs. Here’s hoping that Brosnan and company are able to pull it off!\n\nThere’s nothing further to report on Wolfland at this time, but rest assured we’ll be keeping you informed as further updates roll in. Stay tuned for those and, in the meantime, make sure you’ve seen every other already-released werewolf movie mentioned in this post. There’s some great stuff out there if you know where to look for it!"
