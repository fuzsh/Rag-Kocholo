        "text": "“This Never Happened To The Other Fella”\n\nThe continuity between Bond films has never been totally clear, but following the events of No Time to Die, Bond is set for a total reboot. While I wouldn’t go as far as to call my headline clickbait, it is slightly misleading in that I am not here to talk about the next actor to play Bond. There is already enough speculation about that, most of which comes from people who know as much about it as me, absolutely nothing! The one thing I will say on the subject is look at the actors who have gone before; the part has never been given to a movie star. Most of the actors became stars after they took the part but they started out as TV actors or from smaller movies.\n\nI have spoken before about how there is a missing movie in the Daniel Craig story arc. Casino Royale gives us the young upstart becoming a 00 agent and learning some valuable lessons along the way. Quantum of Solace is a direct sequel that picks Bond up as a cynical and slightly jaded, almost broken man working through the loss and apparent betrayal of Vesper. This (along with the Timothy Dalton movies) is probably the closest the Bond has got to the character in Ian Fleming’s novels. Coming out the other side, moulded rather than healed, this is the complete and optimal James Bond, a cold, cruel, detached man, someone who appreciates life but doesn’t exactly enjoy it. But then came Skyfall; taken on its own merit, its one of the best Bond movies, but it’s the wrong movie. Skyfall depicts an older Bond past his prime, what we should have had was a more fun Bond in his prime, something like The Spy Who Loved Me or Goldeneye.\n\nThis leads to the question how old should the next actor be? Craig was 37 when he started out in Casino Royale, and 44 when past his prime in Skyfall. Younger than Moore in his first film, and older than Connery in his last (EON) film. But how old is Bond? In Mookraker, Fleming’s third novel, Bond was 37, incidentally the same age as Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. We know this as he states he is eight years away from retirement age of the 00 division, which is 45. Independent scholars John Griswold and Henry Chancellor both constructed what they call “high-level chronology of James Bond’s life”, based on their findings this would make Bond 31 at the time of Flemings first story Casino Royale, and 43 or 44 by the final novel The Man With the Golden Gun. But the character in the books was a fully formed character from the first book. That’s not to say a younger Bond hadn’t been toyed with. Timothy Dalton was considered for the part as early as 1968 when he was just 21. He turned it down when he was around 25, as he felt he was too young.\n\nThe perception has always been that Bond is late 30’s early 40’s, in truth, the youngest actor to play the part was George Lazenby at 29. The oldest was Roger Moore at 57, he was 46 in hist first appearance. Realistically the actor could be any age depending on when within his life and career they wish to tell the story. I have advocated the idea of bringing back a former Bond actor to play an older retired version of the character. I originally suggested Timothy Dalton, but Pierce Brosnan would also work. To go to the other extreme, we have Young Bond, a series of five novels and one short story by Charlie Higson and a further four by Steve Cole published between 2005 and 2017. When he started the project Higson was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore the movies and continuation novels, and just use the original Fleming novels as canon. He also used aspects of Ian Flemings childhood, and Bond’s obituary from You Only Live Twice. While neither of these will form basis for the next movie, it does help illustrate the point that Bond could be any age. There is a school of thought that suggests they shouldn’t over think it. Go with the best person for the film they want to make at the time. Afterall, every incarnation of Bond has had to deal with issues that have resulted in changes to timing and casting over and above the best laid plans. They have included contract (pay) disputes, actors who can’t act, unavailable actors, rights issues, a writer’s strike, and covid 19.\n\nIn conclusion, the actor who is chosen will go a long way to deciding what story they want to tell. It may even go the other way, the actor may be chosen as he fits the story. I like the idea of going back to the start and adapting the books in order set in the 1950’s and 60’s. This won’t happen, but one thing that has been hinted at is a younger Bond, possibly a pre 007 Bond. One of the actors linked to the part Aaron Taylor-Johnson is only 32 suggesting this is an option. The biggest decision the filmmakers need to make is, are they going to make a series of films with a set character as they did for the for the first 40 years, or is he going to develop from movie to movie? In the words of Gareth Mallory:\n\n“Good luck, 007. Don’t cock it up”.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI have read a couple of things on twitter recently suggesting certain actors are too old, or too young to play Bond. But how old is Bond? Ian Fleming made very few explicit references to Bond’s age. The clearest came in the third novel Moonraker, published in 1955. Bond states that he is “eight years shy” of mandatory retirement age for a 00, forty-five. This would make him thirty-seven. In You Only Live Twice we get to read Bond’s obituary when he is presumed dead. This tells us he was seventeen, but claimed to be nineteen when he joined the service in 1941. This however only tells us how old he was at the time of these novels as the passage of time between many of the books isn’t always clear. From reading these I have always seen the character as being late 30’s early 40’s. But what of the actors who have played the part?\n\nNote: All ages are approximate based on when the film was shot.\n\nSean Connery (1930 – 2020) – Connery was 31, in his first Bond movie Dr. No (1962), He left the role after You Only Live Twice (1967) age 36. He returned for Diamonds Are Forever (1971) age 40 (although he looked about 50!). He then returned again for the unofficial Bond movie Never Say Never Again (1983) age 52, but didn’t look that much older than in his last official Bond movie.\n\nGeorge Lazenby (1939) – Appearing in just one Bond movie, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969), the youngest to date Lazenby was just 29 during production.\n\nRoger Moore (1927 – 2017) – Moore was actually older than Connery, although considered for Bond around 1967 when he was 40, he didn’t actually get the part until, Live and Let Die (1973) at the age of 46. Having made seven Bond films he is often regarded as the longest serving Bond, but all the films came in just twelve years culminating in A View to a Kill (1985) by the time he was 57.\n\nTimothy Dalton (1946) – Considered for the part multiple times including as early as 1968 when he was just 21. He has stated, that he turned it down when he was around 25, as he felt he was too young for the part. His name came up again around 79/80 when he was around 30. He finally got the part: The Living Daylights (1987) age 40. His second and final Bond film came just two years later, Licence to Kill (1989) when he was 42.\n\nPierce Brosnan (1953) – Like the previous two Bond’s, Brosnan came close before getting the part. He was offered the role in what became The Living Daylights before Dalton when he was around 33 at the time, but had to drop out due to a conflict with the TV Remington Steele. He got the part just under a decade later, his first film GoldenEye (1995) age 42. By the final film Die Another Day (2002), he was 49.\n\nDaniel Craig (1968) – The longest serving (official) Bond based on years in the role, Craig’s first Bond was Casino Royale (2006) age 37. His final film was mainly shot last year but isn’t set for release until next year: No Time to Die (2021) he was 51 at the time of shooting.\n\nSo there you have it the youngest Bond was 29, and the oldest 57. What next, how old will the next James Bond be? A lot depends on the story they want to tell. If they go for another reboot, they could go as young as they want, pre 00 days possibly to his time as a Royal Naval Reserve, or when first recruited into the secret service. I have long suggested bringing Timothy Dalton back to play an older retired Bond, this idea could now also work with Pierce Brosnan. Or, they could do what they have done four previous times (five if you count Connery’s return), just drop a new actor into the part with saying a word, well except a joke in the cold open!\n\nBack in September it was reported that major UK bookmakers had stopped taking bets on Tom Hardy, some even suggested he already had the part. I don’t believe this to be true, and In some ways this could hamper his chances in the end as it will take a lot of air out of the big announcement when finally made. Born in 1977, he is 43 now. They are unlikely to start shooting the next film before an official announcement of the star his made, and they are not going to announce the new Bond until after the release of No Time to Die (hopefully, Covid allowing next year), as a result the next film could go into production in 2022 by which time Hardy will be 45. A year younger than Moore in Live and Let Die, so not the oldest Bond debut, but not far off. This delay could present an interesting opportunity; it has already been confirmed Nomi, the character played by Loshana Lynch (just turned 33) is the new 007, promoted to the role after Bond quit/retired. Assuming her character is any good and doesn’t get “fridged”, why not make film starring her. As a 00 agent, it would be a Bond film in all but name that should please those calling for woman to play Bond, and appease those who say a woman cannot be Bond! Most importantly it could begin pre-production now and script allowing, begin filming as soon as the lockdowns ease.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI preparation for No Time To Die I have been re-watching the Daniel Craig Bond films. It’s the first time I have watched them all back to back. A few things sprang to mind watching them.\n\nCasino Royale stands alongside From Russia with Love as the best films about Bond, rather than the best Bond Movies, in that they can be appreciated on their own merits away from the franchise and its baggage.\n\nQuantum of Solace is the misunderstood and underappreciated masterpiece that I always suspected. A direct sequel to Casino Royale, it takes virtually nothing other than its title from Ian Flemings novels, but in its tone it is probably the closes in style and tone to the source material.\n\nRoger Deakins should have won the cinematography Oscar for Skyfall, he was robbed by a CGI spectacular.\n\nSpectre is a better film than I gave it credit for, despite the Blofeld reveal that was even worse than I remember.\n\nBut, on thing stands out over all of this. There is a missing film between Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.\n\nLet me explain; Casino Royale gives us the Young upstart. Quantum of Solace is a direct sequel pick it up moments after Casino Royale’s epilogue. A slightly jaded, almost broken man working through the loss and apparent betrayal of Vesper, coming out the other side, moulded rather than healed, the complete Bond, cold, cruel, detached, but able to appreciate, if not enjoy life. Something akin to the best of Cornery, Dalton or Brosnan, but more importantly the character seen on the pages of Fleming’s books.\n\nBut then Skyfall has an older Bond past his prime, fighting for relevance, we are missing a movie. We need to look at M (Judi Dench) aka Basil Exposition for to explain this. It was M after all who on her first screen meeting with Bond (Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye) called him “a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War“. In Casino Royale (2006) just after giving Bond his 00 status, his licence to kill, she told him “I knew it was too early to promote you” but just six years later in Skyfall (2012) she said “You know the rules of the game. You’ve been playing it long enough“. Future M, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) tells Bond “It’s a young man’s game.” Craig’s Bond has always been on his way up, or past his best.\n\nThe speculation for No Time to Die is that Bond has retired and his 007 codename has passed to Nomi (Lashana Lynch). This in itself could be problematic, as I can’t see Bond being retired, by the end of the film this means they have to find a way of giving him back his 007 code. If Nomi is indeed 007, how will this pas back to Bond? Kill, demote, or incapacitate her, or even worse something akin to 006 Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean). Let’s not forget, she is potential not only the first female 00, but the first none white one. Her fate is far more significant than that of 006, 002, 004 (The Living Daylights), and 009 in (Octopussy).\n\nI’m getting off track; the Daniel Craig movies are the best Bond movies, and I don’t want to see the character turn into the Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan versions of the character, who had far more misses than hits in terms of the quality of their movies. However, I would have liked to have seen Craig have a film as an established character, not one on the way up or down, and one where he gets to have a little fun with the part, think: You Only Live Twice (1967), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), or GoldenEye (1995). Sadly this will not happen, but we may get to see the other thing I want to see, Bond coming out of retirement, sadly it won’t be an older Bond; Timothy Dalton, or Pierce Brosnan but it’s still an idea with real millage. One thing is certain,\n\nJames Bond WILL return!\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAs the promotion of next spring’s No Time To Die, the 25 James Bond movie gets underway, the merry go round of who will replace Daniel Craig as 007. The first thing I would say is that I am only talking about male actors, Bond is a man, and as M (Judi Dench) says in GoldenEye “a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War”. There have been many suggestions that Ian Fleming’s character was actually a closeted or repressed homosexual. This isn’t as outlandish as it sounds. The books were written at a time when it was illegal to be gay. A gay friend, who knows a lot more than me on the subject once told me that the secret services actively recruited gay men at this time. Putting all this aside, the character would change too much if a woman were cast. That’s not to say there isn’t room for a female 00 agent. I would love to see a different film within the same universe. That said, EON Productions are making a rare departure from Bond with The Rhythm Section due for release early next year, before No Time To Die. Based on Mark Burnell novel of the same name the film promises to be a more gritty and realistic take on the genre. Blake Lively stars as Stephanie Patrick an accidental/reluctant spy. The film has an estimated $50 million budget, as a new property, this is considered a big risk, Bond 25 however cost five times that and will be expecting to smash $1billion in ticket sales. I hope the film does well for two reasons, the second book is the best in the series, I would love it to see it adapted. Secondly it would help the idea of a female 00.\n\nBack to Bond: I understand Tom Hiddleston is still favourite, and for my money a good choice. Tom Hardy, never seems far from the conversation; great actor but I don’t see him as Bond. Sam Heughan seems to have come out of nowhere, and is the favourite of some bookies. I didn’t know who he was and had to look him up. This is often a good thing when it comes to Bond, an A list actor has never been cast in the role. This also bodes well for lesser know actors: James Norton, and Jack Lowden, as well as TV stars Aidan Turner and Richard Madden. It isn’t so great for big names: Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, and Chris Hemsworth. Of the three my pick would be Fassbender who would make a great brooding Bond in the vein of Timothy Dalton. Elba would have been a good choice, but I feel the ship has sailed. At 47, he would be in his 50’s by the time his first movie came out, and his 60’s by the third or fourth. Hemsworth, I would discount for two reasons: I personally would prefer to see a British or Irish actor in the part, and I would rather see him in more comedic roles.\n\nOther actors getting odds of 10/1 or better include Jamie Bell, Cillian Murphy, Henry Cavill, Damian Lewis. Bell, I don’t see as Bond, I can’t explain why. Cavill, I think that ship has sailed. Murphy, I would never have considered, but think he would be an interesting choice (even better if he used his Peaky Blinders accent!). I’m warming to the idea of Lewis, just as he seems to be dropping out of contention. The two others who seem to have dropped out of contention are Benedict Cumberbatch and Henry Golding. Cumberbatch probably comes with too much baggage, If you mention the name of any of the actors who have played Bond: Connery, Lazenby, Morre, Dalton, Brosnan, Craig; Bond is the first think you think of. Cumberbatch is already Doctor Strange and Sherlock Holmes. As for Golding, he has dropped out the race as quickly as he entered it. From what little I have seen of him, he seems to have the looks and the charm, but I haven’t seen anything to convince me he is a very good actor.\n\nSo who will be the seventh James Bond? Probably either nobody from this list, or one of the lesser know actors. But as strange as it sounds, it doesn’t matter that much. George Lazenby aside (50 years ago), they have never chosen a poor actor. How good or bad the films are rests with the script and direction. I have always maintained that Timothy Dalton is the best Bond, he plays the character closest to the one in Ian Fleming’s novels, but he didn’t make the best films. With GoldenEye (1995) Pierce Brosnan made one of the best Bond films, but his subsequent films ranged from poor to terrible. This was purely down to the scripts, and nothing to do with the actor.\n\nThe interesting thing will be the setup. Will Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, and Ben Whishaw return? From one point of view, I would like to see them back as they are all great, on the other hand, a clean reboot with a new whole cast would be interesting too. I like the idea of doing something different, either, going back to the books and making a 1950/60’s set period spy movie. Or a modern day version, but going back to the start, Bond Year One! A movie about a younger Bond being recruited. I have also for a long time advocated bringing back Timothy Dalton, or even Pierce Brosnan to play an older retired Bond.\n\nGiven the timescales these movies work to, I would expect to see Bond 26 in 2024/25.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nIn a recent article on the BBC website (quoting an interview in the Guardian) James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli stated her belief that James Bond will “probably” never be played by a woman. “Bond is male. He’s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he’ll probably stay as a male.” She went on to say “And that’s fine. We don’t have to turn male characters into women.” The same article went on to quote an article where Halle Berry also said that Bond should remain male, she however suggested a new Bond type female character could be created. While it may not be a popular, or politically correct opinion at the moment, I agree that Bond only works as a man. We are however, at a point in time where Bond casting can be colour-blind, while Bond needs to remain British (and male), we are a multicultural society, despite the views of a vocal minority, you don’t have to be white to be British. This leaves the door open, not just for Idris Elba, but for any other British actor regardless of race, I believe Henry Golding has joined the debate!\n\nTo change the sex of Bond would impact on all his interactions with other characters to such an extent it would distract from the story. Regardless of what I, or anyone else thinks, Broccoli is the person most directly responsible for casting the part, so will ultimately decide the direction it takes. This isn’t to say characters are locked into being one sex. The BBC article I mention, refers to the new series of Doctor Who, starting tomorrow with the first ever female Doctor. Ghostbusters (2016), wasn’t terrible because of the idea, or the casting of woman, the cast were good, the issue was with the terrible script.\n\nBack to Halle Berry and her idea: There has previously been a suggestion that her character Jinx Johnson, from Die Another Day (2002) would get her own spiff-off movie or TV show. Fortunately, this did not happen, she was a terrible character from a terrible film. The only positive thing I have ever heard about the character, is that she looks good! Truely representing all that is bad about Bond! There are far better characters in the Bondverse to get their own movie, characters with a little agency, would be: Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) from Licence to Kill (1989), Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) from Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), or Camille (Olga Kurylenko) from Quantum of Solace (2008). I’m not sure any Bond shared universe is a good idea, do we want a new Bond related film every year? The current format of a film every few years, reboot every decade or so works.\n\nIt would be better to start from a clean slate, developed a new completely different character in their own universe and having their own characteristics. Fortunately, that is exactly what Barbara Broccoli is doing. In a rare none Bond movie, EON Productions next movie will be The Rhythm Section adapted from the book of the same name by Mark Burnell. The first of four books about the character Stephanie Patrick. In the books Stephanie Patrick is a couple of turns short of rock bottom in a downward spiral following a traumatic event. She is working as a prostitute to fund her drug problem until a revelation from a journalist sends her life in a completely new direction. The books are about identity and purpose, but work on a more surface level too, with great action. There are four books in the series leaving at least three more stories to adapt, but with author Burnell onboard writing the script, there could be more than that. Blake Lively is staring, and looks like a good choice.\n\nAnd finally the elephant in the room, who will be the next Bond? The name we can’t escape is Idris Elba, I think he would make a fantastic Bond, but fear his time may have passed. At 46 he is about the right age now, he should be making his second film. As it is, he would be 50/51 before he made his debut, giving him time to make three film before he is too old. I am not going to list contendors or speculate on who will take the part, that’s for another day, but I am going to keep banding the drum for my Bond Movie idea, I know it will never happen but it doesn’t stop me modestly suggesting it’s a great idea: Bring Timothy Dalton back to play a long retired James Bond, forced back for one last mission (there are multiple story ideas to facilitate this). As he gets older, the same idea could also work for Pierce Brosnan.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI started writing a review of The Living Daylights (1987) for my Groovers Video Vault, it quickly became clear that I was not writing about the movie but about its star, Timothy Dalton. He probably isn’t the best James Bond, but he is certainly the most underrated, probably the closest to the character Ian Fleming wrote, and possibly the most influential since Sean Connery. The review of The Living Daylights will have to wait for another day.\n\nIn 1985 a 58 year old actor played James Bond, the actor Roger Moore was playing the part for the seventh and final time in his twelve year tenure. An older Bond could have made an interesting character as it did when (the younger) Sean Connery reprised the role for the unofficial Never Say Never Again (1983), but thanks to lazy writing, Moore still playing the part as if he were a much younger man. This was exacerbated by the over reliance of silly gadgets and comedy one liners. In essence the small elements that made Bond, Bond had taken over. It was a bit like watching an aging rock star putting all their effort into an extravagant stage show but forgetting to sing the songs. The final nail in the creative coffin was that they had run out of Ian Fleming novels and were writing new stories, bad stories. Bond had become a parody, the result A View to a Kill was a terrible film, the franchise was an unsustainable mess, something had to be done. There was little of merit in the Roger Moore movies after his third outing, The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), the series really needed new direction back then. I suspect that remembering the failure of George Lazenby as Sean Connery’s replacement, the producers were scared of upsetting the status quo and kept Moore in the role for an extra decade. As bad as the films got (Moonraker (1979), Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985) being the low points) they still made money.\n\nProducers, particularly Cubby Broccoli courted a young little known Irishman Pierce Brosnan who was staring in the TV show Remington Steele. Contractual obligations prevented Brosnan from taking the part so attention turned to Shakespearean actor Timothy Dalton. Dalton had been approached to replace Connery in the late 60’s but felt he was too young, and then again in the early 80’s when Moore’s contract was in dispute. Comments in various interviews have suggested Dalton was not happy with the direction the franchise was going, he also suspected that he and other actors were used force Moore’s hand. When he eventually took the part he did it on his own terms. A fan of Flemings source novels, Dalton insisted on scaling back the sci-fi/fantasy elements of the plot in favour of a grittier more plot driven story. He played Bond as a reluctant hero who like his literary counterpart drank and smoked too much. He was a man clinging to small pleasures while he tried to take away the taste and guilt of the repugnant side of the job. This can be seen early in his first movie, The Living Daylights (1987). It took its name from an Ian Fleming short story that was originally published along with Octopussy.\n\nThe story saw a jaded Bond on sniper duty, his mission to take out a KGB sniper and aid an agents escape from East Berlin. On realising the KGB sniper is a beautiful, blonde cellist he had seen on her way to and from practice earlier, he decides to shoot her weapon from her hands rather than killing her. Captain Sender his local contact, explains to Bond that he had to mention Bonds actions in his report stating “You should have killed that sniper whoever it was” Bonds response:\n\nJames Bond Said wearily “Okay with any luck it’ll cost me my Double-0 number. But tell Head of Station not to worry. That girl won’t do any more sniping. Probably lost her left hand. Certainly broke her nerve for that kind of work. Scared the living daylights out of her. In my book, that was enough. Let’s go.”\n\nIt is with this defiance that Timothy Dalton played the part. Most of the short story makes it to the screen reworked into the plot of the movie. Bond’s words became “STUFF my orders! I only kill professionals. That girl didn’t know one end of her rifle from the other. Go ahead. Tell M what you want. If he fires me, I’ll thank him for it.”\n\nBonds relationship with Saunders (based on Captain Sender from the short story) is unusual within a Bond film, in that it brings out many emotions in him. Initially the two don’t get on, but they grow to respect each other. When Saunders is killed Bond loses heart in his cover and becomes agitated and on edge. There is nuance in this performance you don’t expect from Bond. This isn’t a new Bond this is a return to the real Bond, the Fleming Bond. We can see this in his interactions with General Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. This the Bond we have seen on screen and read about on the page who has always been more interested in following his instincts than his orders. Dalton’s second and final Bond film Licence to Kill (1989) takes Bond a stage further refusing M’s orders and resigning in order to seek personal revenge. The film was both praised and criticised for darker and more violent tone of the movie taking it away from the family audience and more towards contemporary Hollywood thrillers. Interestingly it wasn’t that well received by American audiences. Receiving a 15 certificate in the UK and Rated PG-13 in America probably didn’t help.\n\nIn 1990, MGM/UA was sold, this led to various legal disputes that are too complicated to go into. The legal disputes caused delays and the next film due to go into production in the early 90’s was delayed until early 1994, this again was delayed and Dalton resigned from the role despite originally signing a three picture deal.\n\nThe interesting thing about Daltos time as Bond is what happened when he quit, Cubby Broccoli got his man, the actor he always wanted to play Bond, Pierce Brosnan. After a promising start GoldenEye (1995) the series descended into something very similar to the latter Roger Moore films, farces filled with silly gadgets and product placements. Bond as a character was conceived during World War II and was a cold war character, for that reason he lost a little of his relevance after The Living Daylights. While he was away fighting drug dealers and on a brief hiatus, the world was changing, Russia was changing. To their credit this became an underlying plot point in Brosnan’s début film but it was never expanded on or played with in future films. Then in 2006 in the wake of the Jason Bourne movies for the first time ever, Bond wasn’t recast, it was rebooted with Daniel Craig getting the part to the surprise of almost everyone. His début Casino Royale (2006) was a return to form, its sequel Quantum of Solace (2008) (a direct sequel is another Bond first) was less well received. And now the Zenith of what Dalton started, Skyfall (2012) has taken Bond further from Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan than many thought possible. He may have taken it too far to be recognisable as a Bond, but it is proving popular with fans (including me), audiences and critics. Don’t expect the ever humble Dalton to take any credit where Bond is today, but I don’t think he would have got to this point without the new direction he took the character in 1987.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nTalking about James Bond in last weeks Radio Times, film critic Barry Norman made the statement: Ask anybody: who is your favourite James bond? I guarantee the answer will be the first one they ever saw”. I’m not sure if I am more discerning or just awkward, but it isn’t true of me. To the best of my knowledge and memory the first Bond I saw was Roger Moore in Live and Let Die. Moore is far from my favourite Bond, but I have recently come to the conclusion that I don’t know who my favourite Bond is! For years I have always claimed it is Sean Connery with the caveat that Timothy Dalton is the closest to the character from Ian Fleming’s novels.\n\nI hold with the popular opinion that George Lazenby was the worst Bond, and this is a great shame as On Her Majesty’s Secret Service is one of the best Bond films despite him. He is closely followed by Roger Moore whose comic version of Bond just doesn’t work for me. He did however make some decent movies, Live and Let Die and The Spy Who Loved Me were both really good films. The Man with the Golden Gun isn’t as good but does benefit from a fantastic performance from Christopher Lee as the villian Scaramanga.\n\nSo Back to who is my favourite Bond, Sean Connery certainly had the best stories with relatively faithful adaptations of Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball. You Only Live Twice is the point where the franchise started to get silly and even became a parody of itself, it was however still a good film in its own right. Connery’s only misstep was Diamonds Are Forever that was both silly and dull.\n\nI have already said Timothy Dalton most closely resembles the character from the books in his portrayal, but there is another actor who probably looks most like Bond, Pierce Brosnan. This may be a bit of a stretch as there is little description of Bonds appearance beyond his short black hair and a resemblance to Hoagy Carmichael. Pierce Brosnan isn’t my favourite Bond either. He is perfect for the films he made and the time they were made, but sadly most of them weren’t actually very good. After a strong opening with GoldenEye the rest of his films got progressively worse culminating with the car crash of a movie, Die Another Day that was as bad as anything Moore did.\n\nThis leaves us with two contenders: Timothy Dalton who was hamstrung by only making two appearances both of them being good but not great films, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill. Had he made more films he could well have been my favourite Bond but for reasons to long winded and complicated to go into today he didn’t. And finally Daniel Craig, Casino Royale is certainly one of my favourite Bond films and Quantum of Solace is underrated and will probably age well, but is he my favourite? Not yet but he may well be in future, with three more movies including Skyfall due out next month, he will certainly have a chance before handing his Aston Martin and Walther PPK to Michael Fassbender, my choice for the next James Bond.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThere appears to be a lot of fuss over James Bond drinking Heineken in the upcoming movie Skyfall, what’s the big deal? It isn’t the first time he has drunk beer. Product placement isn’t new to movie in general and certainly isn’t new to Bond. Think of the cars he drives, Bond didn’t give up his Bentley (driven in the books) in favour of various Aston Martin, Lotus and BMW’s for the fun of it. And lets not forget Vesper Lynd’s introduction in Casino Royale where Bond makes it clear that his watch is an Omega not a Rolex (as featured in the books and worn by Sean Connery) . Pierce Brosnan used a Ericsson phone and had a Parker Jotter pen with a handy class-four grenade (I still have one that I won along with a copy of GoldenEye on VHS – mine lacks the grenade). By the time Pierce Brosnan hung up his Walther it is rumoured that as much of half the $140million budget for Die Another Day (2002) came from “marketing partners” this led to the film being nicknamed “Buy Another Day.” Then we have the whole idea of what is sponsorship, United Artists is part of MGM that by the time Daniel Craig took over were owned by Sony. Take a look at the gadgets on display, Sony Vaio laptops, Sony Ericsson mobile phones, Sony Bravia TV’s and Sony Cyber-shot cameras.\n\nLooking more specifically at what Bond drinks, this isn’t the first time this has happened. Bond actually drinks more Champagne than anything else including his signature Vodka Martini. The original character in Ian Fleming’s novels favoured Taittinger remarking in Cassino Royale “[1943 Taittinger] is probably the finest champagne in the world”. in the movies, Sean Connery’s Bond appears to have preferred Dom Perignon but some time in the 80’s and ever since thanks to a sponsorship deal Bond started drinking Bollinger. Oh and did I mention bond has had a deal with Heineken before! If you still have a problem, look at it this way, it could be far worse, he could be drinking the tasteless self proclaimed king of beers that is drunk in most Hollywood productions.\n\nIf you are still not convinced, sit back watch any Bond movie and lookout for the products, if you need some refreshment during the film why not try one of these, the recipe for “The Vesper” is:\n\nThree measures of Gordon’s Gin\n\nOne of vodka\n\nHalf a measure of Kina Lillet\n\nShake over ice until it’s ice-cold and strain into a martini glass.\n\nThen add a large thin slice of lemon peel\n\nRead Full Post »"
