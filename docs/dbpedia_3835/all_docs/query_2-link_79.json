        "text": "Pierce Brosnan may be a Hollywood heartthrob (even at age 71), but in reality, he's a devoted dad and husband.\n\nHe married Keely Shaye Brosnan (née Smith) in 2001 after the couple first met in 1994. They went on to welcome two sons: Dylan and Paris.\n\nKeely is a former model and actress, who worked in TV and film. She later became an on-air correspondent, using her platform to support environmentalism and animal rights. In 2016, Keely made her directorial debut with the film Poisoning Paradise, which shed light on toxic environmental practices in Kauai, Hawaii, where she and Pierce live for part of the year.\n\nAfter more than two decades of marriage, Keely and Pierce are still head over heels in love with each other.\n\n\"We like each other a lot. We love each other a lot,\" the Dante's Peak star told Fox News in December 2023. \"Watching someone grow up with you and grow old with you is a very spiritual journey. To watch each other change … whatever it may be, the hair, the waist. But it's the love in the heart.\"\n\nKeep reading for everything to know about Pierce Brosnan's wife, Keely Shaye Brosnan.\n\nShe started as an actress before becoming a journalist and filmmaker\n\nKeely first appeared on screen as the leading lady in the 1986 music video for \"Stuck with You\" by Huey Lewis and the News and had a few small TV and film roles in the 1980s.\n\nShe then transitioned to journalism and documentary filmmaking, with the mission to spread awareness about environmental injustice and animal rights. Her work has ranged from protecting marine life in oceans to advocating for safe environmental practices in Mexico and Hawaii.
