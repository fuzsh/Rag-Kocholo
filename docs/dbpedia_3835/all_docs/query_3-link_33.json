        "text": "The new film comes from Warrior Nun creator and showrunner Simon Barry, who is making his feature film directorial debut with In The Wind.\n\nFormerly announced with the title A Spy’s Guide To Survival, the film will centre on Brosnan's retired spy \"who is brought out of hiding by his enigmatic new neighbour, digging up both of their secrets in the process\", according to Deadline.\n\nOn the announcement of Brosnan's casting in the film, Barry said: “As a longtime Pierce Brosnan fan, I’m extremely grateful to have the opportunity to work alongside someone I admire for their craft, character and humanity.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nThe film is also based on a story from Barry's father, Derek Barry, with the film director also penning the screenplay for In The Wind.\n\nThe film comes from Uri Singer’s Passage Pictures with Singer saying: “Pierce is the perfect fit for this role, and we are so excited to see what he and Simon will do together.\"\n\nWell, if there's one thing that Brosnan knows how to do it's play a spy character very well. All you have to do is look at the likes of Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies, to name a couple of his outings as Bond.\n\nAs of now, there's plenty else for Brosnan fans to get excited about, as the Irish actor has recently been confirmed for multiple exciting projects on the horizon. Brosnan is set to star alongside The Crown's Amir El-Masry in Prince Naseem Hamed biopic, Giant.\n\nBrosnan will portray Irish-born boxing trainer Bernard Ingle, who mentored the young Prince in his ascent to world championship.\n\nRead more:\n\nPierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren cast in Richard Osman's Thursday Murder Club movie\n\nChallengers writer reveals how Serena Williams helped inspire new Zendaya film\n\nNot only will Brosnan be donning the boxing gloves, but he's also set to take on another film role that's miles away from boxing rings and tense fights as he's also recently been announced to star in the adaptation of Richard Osman's Thursday Murder Club.\n\nBrosnan will be starring alongside Helen Mirren and Sir Ben Kingsley in the key roles of the murder mystery movie, which Home Alone and Harry Potter director Chris Columbus will be at the helm of."
