        "text": "(aka, Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe’s War)\n\nWhat in the world did I just watch?\n\nI’d love to pretend that anything about this supposed Lawnmower Man sequel makes sense, but you know what?\n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nNow it has been a long time since I saw the first film (I’m not a big fan, to put it mildly), but basically it’s a fairly simple sort of thing: scientist invents some sort of virtual reality thing he can use to artificially increase intelligence. He tries it out on a sweet, loveable goof of a handyman, and he turns into a monster within the virtual world who plans to rule the world (or something roughly like that).\n\nIt ended with Jobe, the handyman, dead, and nowhere to go with the story.\n\nParticularly if you can’t afford Pierce Brosnan. Or even Jeff Fahey.\n\nBut no problem. After an intro in which we learn that somehow Jobe escaped the virtual world and his broken body survived the explosion which destroyed the entire lab in the first film, we then move into The Future.\n\nWhich is sort of Blade Runner-ish and cool in a low effort sort of way.\n\nThis is where it suddenly turns into another movie altogether: we leave the rather adult world of the first film (complete with sex and violence) and somehow end up in…\n\nThe Goonies.\n\nYep, we’ve got a gang of kids building inventions, playing pranks, and hanging out in an abandoned subway train. The leader of the gang just happens to be Jobe’s pal Peter from the first film — the only actor who carries over from the original.\n\nNow remember that. It’s going to be important.\n\nAs Ian Softley’s Hackers came out the same year, they are also teenaged versions of Crash Override, Acid Burn, Cereal Killer and the rest of the gang. The world now has a huge VR internet with a lot of game worlds and other sites they can hack into. They also are fortunate enough that one of them has a set of digital cycles he can load into the system anytime they need to get somewhere in a hurry.\n\nYou can’t quite call them “light cycles” as they are too obviously just motorcycles with shiny body shells but, trust me, we know who they are copying.\n\nThe end up in a world which is far more realistic than anything they’ve seen before, and mysterious armed men immediately pursue them. While all this is going on, Peter suddenly encounters Jobe, who tells Peter he needs his help. Jobe is dying and only Peter can save him, by finding Dr. Benjamin Trace, a brilliant electronics designer who has vanished.\n\nYou see, the usual evil industrialist saved Jobe, rebuilt his body (except for his legs) and has him hooked up to a vast virtual reality city which Jobe is building for him.\n\nIt turns out that Dr. Trace has gone back to nature and is living off the grid with no computers, but he agrees to help them because the usual big evil corporation is using the chip he designed to run everything.\n\nSo it all turns into a big MacGuffin chase, as he and kids try to find Jobe and steal the chip…\n\nOnly Jobe may have an agenda of his own…\n\nNow I need to point out that the original Lawnmower Man short story by Stephen King has nothing whatsoever to do with virtual reality, and instead has a Greek god disguised as a handyman. I don’t see why the studio optioned it, but they had another script floating around called “Cyber God” and just slapped King’s title on the film to cash in on his name.\n\nKing wasn’t amused and sued them. But by then his name was on all the posters.\n\nSo this sort of weird bait and switch approach to a sequel seems all too appropriate: after all, we have yet another movie that isn‘t about what it says it is. It’s supposed to be about virtual reality, so we have lightcycles and hackers. We even have Matt Frewer taking Jeff Fahey’s place, and doing more than a little Max Headroom in his crazier moments (did I mention that the director, Farhad Mann, also directed the pilot episode of the American Max Headroom series?). We have a (vaguely defined) world-ending threat, lots of gunfire, (virtual) motorcycle chases, and a surprisingly effective helicopter crash.\n\nAnd, of course, we have plenty of digital animation, including that huge cyber city — and, strangely enough, it actually looks reasonably good for a mid-Nineties production.\n\nIMDB claims it had an (estimated) fifteen-million-dollar budget, as compared to ten for the original film. That seems quite modest, particularly considering the action scenes and the extensive digital effects, although it is hard to miss that the original cast has been replaced by low-priced substitutes. I’ve never quite understood why Patrick Bergin (who plays Dr. Trace) was such a favorite of the SciFi Network, as he isn’t particularly memorable.\n\nBut I suppose he was cheap.\n\nAnd, I’ll admit I’m just a bit disappointed that Matt Frewer is rather subdued here and spends most of his screen time sitting in a wheelchair with a rather blank look on his face. You can get glimpses of what might have been when we see him as god Jobe inside the VR world. But that’s just one scene, and then it is back to the real world with him being blank again.\n\nWhich is rather odd when you remember that he ended up entering permanently into the VR world in the last film and leaving his body behind. It would have made more sense to keep his body in a coma and then only show him in the VR world or on a computer screen.\n\nOn the plus side, however, the film does confront the whole issue of the change of cast with a throwaway line of dialogue at the beginning of the film: Jobe was so badly hurt in the fire that they need to reconstruct his face.\n\nWell…it would be a plus if Peter didn’t recognize Jobe the moment he saw him.\n\nAnd there’s a weird, happy ending moment which just leaves me scratching my head. That happened? Really?\n\nBy now I’m sure you’ve figured it out: this was an unutterably strange sort of film, which threw bits and pieces of everything they loved into a big box and shook hard; a cheap film which cost more than the original; all wrapped up in an utterly absurd action film. It’s objectively a mess, a big, silly, convoluted grab bag of a movie, full of everything and nothing.\n\nAnd, darn it, I enjoyed the goofy thing. It’s a massive guilty pleasure, with enough going on at any moment which demands a bit of mockery, or leaves you howling in disbelief. You can’t take it seriously for a moment.\n\nBut then, that’s what makes it fun.\n\nJust make sure you make extra popcorn:\n\nYou’ll need something to throw at the screen…\n\nBUY ME A COFFEE!\n\nA TO Z REVIEWS"
