        "text": "The movie formerly known as STEPHEN KING’S THE LAWNMOWER MAN is a big perverted disaster, and I would love it if I could make that the whole of my review. It is worth explaining that King arduously sued the producers to have his name removed from the film, which has almost nothing at all in common with the author’s short story from Night Shift, about a grass-eating greenskeeper who turns out to be a Pan-worshipping satyr. New Line Cinema just happened to own the rights to this material, and so forced the story title, and King’s name, onto an unrelated sci-fi project whose sole raison d'être was to showcase dated-before-its-time “virtual reality” visual effects. For better or worse, the world at large does think of the resulting mess as a Stephen King movie, although you’d be better off with the repellant MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE for both the author and the satan ex machina theme.\n\nSince I’ve obligated myself to talk about it, I might as well tell you that this unlikable nightmare from Brett Leonard (better thought of as the director of KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE, or even of THE DEAD PIT, that one that had the embossed VHS box with the glowing zombie eyes and the annoying noises) is about a developmentally challenged handyman who makes the perfect subject for some secret psychiatric experiments rooted in VR technology. Pierce Brosnan plays the scientist who somehow accelerates dumbass Jeff Fahey’s learning to the point that he surpasses conventional genius, and mutates into a telekinetic, pyrokinetic digital god. The Yahoo Serious-lookin ass bitch quickly graduates from being a virgin who only hangs out with children, to a violently vengeful and increasingly sweaty sex freak who I guess turns himself into pure information in order to enslave the entire plugged-in world.\n\nFor a premise that sounds so painfully relevant to our modern times, THE LAWNMOWER MAN fails to deliver any real meaning amid its desperate philosophical flailing. The movie insists on a completely unnecessary eroticism, displaying its leads uncomfortably in fetishy Tron suits in and around a few moist sex scenes--and even when characters aren’t actually copulating, it feels as if they might as well be, when they are so often groaning and undulating in Pierce Brosnan’s creepily sensual synthetic universe. “Falling? Floating? Flying? What’s next, FUCKING?” Pierce’s wife Colleen Coffey rages in an especially forced piece of writing, I suppose expressing the fear that normally corporeal pleasures are being made obsolete. Fleshly feelings seem pretty external to the whole idea of transcending the mortal coil, but they are arguably preferable to the movie’s eye-rolling religious references. A reasonable metaphor almost emerges from the conflict between Jobe (yes, that really is the name of our Lawnmower Man) and the sadistic minister who ostensibly looks after him, but any positive feelings one may develop about this will be swiftly dashed by the juvenile “be your own god” nonsense that ramps up toward the end of the film. And like, ok, I get that the whole idea is that Jobe transcends both his humanity and the strictures of human culture, but the correlation with Job is seriously dysfunctional. Sure, both Job and Jobe are unfairly burdened with all sorts of personal difficulties, but if the notion is that JOBE is going to launch a satanic rebellion, then how is it helpful for me to be so forcibly reminded of JOB who maintains faith and humility in the face of total deprivation? What’s the point of this?\n\nThe point is, COMPUTER ANIMATION. And if I’m being honest, I do remember finding THE LAWNMOWER MAN impressive to behold as a child, although I am completely unable to access those feelings now. Even if the film had been of a higher general quality, it would still be inescapably damned by its then-groundbreaking, now nauseating graphics. Brett Leonard also directed VIRTUOSITY, which I have never seen though I feel sure I can picture it perfectly, and the vastly more entertaining music video for Peter Gabriel’s “Kiss That Frog”. It isn’t that the latter’s graphics look much better, but they feel much more at home in that fun, abbreviated format, than they do in this long, unfunny ripoff of EVILSPEAK.\n\nAnd speaking of long: I have a few imaginable regrets about reviewing this movie, but perversely, one of the big ones is that I did not instead watch the director’s cut--a 141-minute titan that adds 33 minutes to the theatrical releases’s already-trying 103-minute expanse. I can’t seem to get myself to read through this closely enough to extract any overarching meaning from it, but if you’re dying to know what happens in the extended version without actually having to watch it, it seems to be neatly cataloged here:\n\nhttp://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=324384"
