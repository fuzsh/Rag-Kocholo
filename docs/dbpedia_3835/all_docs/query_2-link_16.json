        "text": "Pierce Brosnan (born May 16, 1953, Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland) is an Irish American actor who is perhaps best known for playing James Bond in a series of films, including GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Die Another Day (2002).\n\nBrosnan, whose father left home shortly after his birth, was raised by relatives after his mother left to work in England. At age 15 he set out on his own in London to be an actor. He joined a theater group and later studied at the Drama Centre London. He married actress Cassandra Harris, and the two subsequently moved to the United States; he became a U.S. citizen in 2004. Brosnan was soon cast as a charming con man in the NBC television detective series Remington Steele. The show, which premiered in 1982, was a success, and in 1986 he was chosen as the successor to Roger Moore as James Bond—the suave British secret service agent 007 created by novelist Ian Fleming. His NBC contract, however, prevented him from accepting, and Timothy Dalton took the role instead. Remington Steele ended in 1987, and Brosnan continued to take on television and film roles. In 1991 he dealt with the loss of his wife, who died after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nMeanwhile, Dalton’s two Bond films were seen as relative failures, and in 1994 Brosnan was finally able to accept the role. His first film in the series, GoldenEye (1995), made more than $350 million worldwide, the most ever for a Bond film at that time. The second, Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), scored record grosses for a Bond film in the United States. Brosnan brought out the human side of the Bond character, and the series producers sought to emphasize that in The World Is Not Enough (1999). Brosnan made his final appearance as James Bond in Die Another Day (2002).\n\nBrosnan was made an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) at a special ceremony in Dublin in July 2003 for his “outstanding contribution to the British film industry.” Given that Ireland is not a member state of the Commonwealth, Brosnan was ineligible for full honors.\n\nWhile making the Bond films, Brosnan expanded his repertoire and took advantage of his popularity to choose new projects. In 1999 he produced and starred in a remake of the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair. He later appeared in the espionage-thriller The Tailor of Panama (2001), a film adaptation of John le Carré’s novel; the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction (2004); and The Matador (2005), in which he played a weary hit man. In 2007 Brosnan starred opposite Liam Neeson in the Civil War film Seraphim Falls. The following year he appeared with Meryl Streep and Colin Firth in Mamma Mia!, a musical featuring songs by the Swedish pop group ABBA. Brosnan later reprised his role in the sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018).\n\nBrosnan’s subsequent movies included the children’s fantasy Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010) and Roman Polanski’s The Ghost Writer (2010), in which he played a former British prime minister accused of war crimes. In 2011 he appeared as a flirtatious businessman in the comedy I Don’t Know How She Does It and as a widowed writer in the TV miniseries Bag of Bones, which was based on a Stephen King novel.\n\nBrosnan then took a leading role in Love Is All You Need (2012), a romantic comedy set in Europe with a mainly Danish cast. In 2014 he featured in the ensemble cast of the drama A Long Way Down, based on the novel by Nick Hornby about four suicidal people, and in the thriller The November Man, in which he portrayed a retired CIA agent who is pulled onto a high-stakes mission. The next year Brosnan appeared in No Escape as an undercover British agent who assists a family in escaping from a fictional Asian country in the midst of a coup."
