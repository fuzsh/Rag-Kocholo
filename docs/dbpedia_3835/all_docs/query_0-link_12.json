        "text": "I’m covering all three Lawnmower Man films in one piece; the two versions of the original film, and the sequel are all contained in this first UK blu-ray pressing, out this week from 101 Films’ Black Label. I’d recently reviewed the director’s cut of the 1992 version here, but had never written up my notes for the subsequent film, subtitled either Beyond Cyberspace or Jobe’s Dream depending on your bandwidth. That wasn’t because I wasn’t interested in the second film, quite the opposite, but this souped-up revival provides fresh opportunity to delve deeply into this extremely oddball franchise. Headsets on!\n\nAs a Stephen King adaptation, Brett Leonard’s original deviated so far from the text that the author successfully demanded his name be removed. It’s a 1992 costuming disaster, with Jeff Fahey in dungarees as a blonde-haired ‘half-wit’ as the script deems him, going by the Biblical name of Jobe. Dr Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), a chain-smoking scientist who dresses like Dora the Explorer in cargo pants/shorts, is frustrated by doing all his ground-breaking science-y VR experiments on poor little chimps, and starts working on Jobe, transforming him from a ‘religious imbecile’ into an all-powerful cyber-space messiah and ‘mind murderer’. ‘It may be the future to you but it’s the same old sh8t to me,’ one character says, and in the original theatrical cut, the Lawnmover Man movie is just Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein dressed up in what were ground-breaking computer graphics at the time. ‘I got God,’ Jobe says after gorging his transformed mind ‘like a clean hungry sponge’ on telephone sex lines, a warning to us all.\n\nThe big novelty that made the first Lawnmower Man was the promise of ten minutes or so showcasing dem new-fangled computer generated graphics rather than the familiar chastening story; back in 1992, I remember cycling 5 miles to spend 10 minutes in a cinema lobby with a VR helmet on my head. Three years later, I was driving across town once a week to work on an ‘internet terminal’ in a forward thinking educational establishment, a big deal for those of us looking to go beyond cyberspace and get in early on the future’s ground floor.\n\nSo here’s where the Lawnmower Man saga gets even stranger; neither Brosnan, Fahey or Leonard wanted to return for a sequel, with only Austin O’Brien returning; his Peter Parkette character goes from moppet side-kick of Jobe to ‘John Connor in a beret’ leader of a group of cyber-criminals in three years which seems a remarkable leap. With not much textual guidance to go on, writer and director Farhad Mann had to make up something new for Lawnmower Man 2, but for 1995, his version of the present is remarkably accurate. ‘The future is now’ says a recast Jobe, Matt Frewer, and it really is. Lawnmower Man 2 imagines that in 2024, we might be living in an era dominated not by physical but via our internet interaction, the ‘information superhighway’ that we were promised, where our records, our movements, everything about us can be traced via ‘online databases’. Video-phones, paid for via swipe-able card-readers, are in common use, but we’re all connected via ‘uplinks’ and virtual reality which we share via our iphones, (styled as eye-phones here, literally fitting over our eyes). Does all this technological whizz make us happy? One truly prescient line of dialogue says, ‘but the information superhighway has left people feeling isolated from their fellow man…\n\nLawnmower Man 2’s uncannily accurate vision of the potential impact of the internet on our behaviour in the future was laughed out of cinemas in 1995, but seen from 2024, got absolutely tonnes right. As with the first film, the actual story is utter gibber; Jobe finds that science has ‘amputated both his legs and reconstructed his face,’ but that ‘virtual reality can rehabilitate your mind and your body.’ With his restoration making him more powerful than ever, Jobe finds himself giving online presentations before virtual audiences detailing his plans aspires to ‘enter every system’ via the McGuffin here, the Chiron chip. Now outfitted with goggles and a motorcycle, Peter Parkette leads a Dickensian group of techno-street urchins to stop him, enlisting the help of Patrick Bergin’s terrorist/pirate Dr Benjamin Trace. Trace claims to be ‘the Einstein of VR’, which seems an unlikely boast since he point-blank refuses to enter it, saying ‘I might get lost.’ A cute dog called Harvey helps save the day and beat back the threat of technological messiahs, for the moment at least.\n\nWith no real extras on the sequel disk, I get that 101 are probably presenting the much derided Lawnmower Man 2; Jobe’s War for completist purposes only, but my hot take is that leaving the hokey plot aside, this collection offers a ridiculously prescient venture that’s really worth seeing in 2024. Bear in mind that back in the 1995 in which this film was made, there’s not even flat screen tvs and even the computer monitors have giant backsides, information is shared on mini-disks, and computers are accessed via public libraries; from such crude ingredients, it’s hard to imagine how they managed to get our future so right.\n\nStill don’t believe that Lawnmower Man nailed it in 1995? Let’s listen in to Jobe’s plan. ‘Tomorrow I go…online!” he says, ‘’…this is true spirituality,’ he says on achieving his cyber-goal. Jobe hatches a plan for an infrastructure war, taking down city water and electricity grids, the banking system. ‘If he can destroy our world, then help us rebuild it, we will hail him as a messiah,’ we’re told. Sure, LM2 has Patrick Bergin nutting security guards, eye-brow-less female henchmen, discount Rene Russo and Rip Torn figures, action shots of planes falling out of the sky and tube-trains crashing which appear to have been stolen from other films; it’s a cheap, silly film. Yet the villain’s chat about using the internet to ‘identify contributors to fundamentalist religions’ or ‘hypocritical Democrats making over 300k a year’ sound torn from the headlines of 2024. ‘La vie continue-y,’ says Jobe, and so it does; I hate to say it but the Lawnmower Man films laid it all out for us three decades ago, we just didn’t pay attention. Perhaps we’ll listen now.\n\nThe Lawnmover Man Collection is out from June 10th 2024.
