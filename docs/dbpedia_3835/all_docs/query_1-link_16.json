        "text": "Brosnan was light years ahead of Dalton. it's easy to compare him to Craig who played in the 21st quality of cinema and better directors and scripts most of the time. much better villains too.\n\nat least Brosnan isnt a proud feminist like craig is(on and off the bond role)\n\nI've been going through all of Pierce's filmography in an attempt to finally log all of them on Letterboxd, sans the miscellaneous mini special feature documentaries or overlong TV miniseries. He was in a ton of cringeworthy duds in the '80s and '90s but he's very solid in most everything I've seen thus far, either ones I haven't seen in 20 years or that I've seen for the very first time.\n\nChecked out some TV movie called Entangled last night, thought he was brilliant in the few scenes he's in but it's hands down one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.\n\nSo much of the Brosnanography still remains a tantalizing promise for me. Serious stuff, silly stuff, I don't care, I want to see it all. I even have a nineties TV recording of The Lawnmower Man sitting on my hard drive, for maximum vintage quality.\n\nSo much of the Brosnanography still remains a tantalizing promise for me. Serious stuff, silly stuff, I don't care, I want to see it all. I even have a nineties TV recording of The Lawnmower Man sitting on my hard drive, for maximum vintage quality.\n\nJust saw The Lawnmower Man for the first time a few days back and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nAn interesting time capsule, I imagine. I'll have to give it a thorough watch; I'm mostly familiar with the last 30 minutes.\n\nSo Sharon Stone isn't in the movie, but...\n\nThey really should work together.\n\nApparently MGM wanted her for Elektra King.\n\nYeah, a good idea, if you ask me. Not that I dislike Sophie Marceau in the role. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nIf Sharon Stone had been Elektra King there would have been zero surprise over her being revealed as the villain. It’s practically typecasting. If she was actually offered the role, it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s why she turned it down.\n\nI've been going through all of Pierce's filmography in an attempt to finally log all of them on Letterboxd, sans the miscellaneous mini special feature documentaries or overlong TV miniseries.\n\nI recommend you don't skip the miniseries. Around the World in 80 Days is terrific and has my favorite Brosnan performance, and Noble House, while not as strong, is still well worth your time.\n\nIs that so? Perhaps I'll add them to the list then. I have checked out and logged/reviewed a couple of miniseries on Letterboxd before (like Fassinbder's Eight Hours Don't Make A Day) so perhaps I'll make an exception here.\n\nI saw the remake of Love Affair yesterday and was also disappointed to see he only has a few short appearances in it. That's why I'm looking forward to pressing on and getting up to his more recent features, where he's way more prevalent throughout.\n\nI actually think that Brosnan did his best work on television.\n\nA warning if you plan on viewing THE DECEIVERS: It's not good!\n\nFunny, I actually didn't mind that one! A bit overacted at times but some of the chase/action sequences were intriguing enough to me. I've certainly seen worse from his filmography, though not always because of his talents, like False Positive, The Misfits, I.T., Urge, Survivor, , Entangled, The Broken Chain and Victim of Love. Those were all horrible.\n\nSo much of the Brosnanography still remains a tantalizing promise for me. Serious stuff, silly stuff, I don't care, I want to see it all. I even have a nineties TV recording of The Lawnmower Man sitting on my hard drive, for maximum vintage quality.\n\nI caught up with Lawnmower Man recently and it's really something. Have a few drinks.\n\nI'll make sure to drink every time the words \"virtual\", \"reality\" or \"cyberspace\" are mentioned. Do come visit me when I'm in my alcohol-induced coma.\n\nIf you want a truly skeevy Bros film, there's this lurking at the bottom of the barrel:\n\nI didn't know this film had another title.\n\nThe synopsis is hilarious. Especially combined with Brosnan staring at the camera. Like \"yeah, I do all those things you read. And more. Aren't you curious now?\"\n\nSo much of the Brosnanography still remains a tantalizing promise for me. Serious stuff, silly stuff, I don't care, I want to see it all.

Around the World in 80 Days is terrific and has my favorite Brosnan performance, and Noble House, while not as strong, is still well worth your time.\n\nI can vouch for the quality of Brosnan's performance in Around the World in 80 Days.\n\nWay back when Brosnan was doing movies like THE MATADOR, SERAPHIM FALLS, and THE GHOST WRITER, I assumed we were seeing the beginning of a post-Bond career renaissance for Brosnan. Perhaps becoming an award winning actor much like Connery became post-Bond.\n\nBut then he’s starring movies like SOME KIND OF BEAUTIFUL, I.T., and THE MISFITS, and that’s just movies where he’s credited as PRODUCER. He says he wished he had more creative control over his Bond films, maybe it’s a good thing he didn’t.\n\n#:-S\n\nWhich is too bad. He's earned enough clout and made enough money off of Bond to be able to pick his own projects for the rest of his life. He could easily have done what Tom Cruise did after becoming a box office star and signing onto projects with highly acclaimed directors. I'm thinking of an alternate timeline where he went onto work with Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann, Paul Thomas Anderson, etc.\n\nI think the closest he came to that was with THE GHOST WRITER with Roman Polanski. Before I had seen THE WORLD'S END I had already known Brosnan was in it and assumed that Edgar Wright had given him a fun role like he gave Timothy Dalton in HOT FUZZ, only to be kind of underwhelmed that Bronsan was essentially just a cameo in that film."
