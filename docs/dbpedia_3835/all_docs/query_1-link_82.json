        "text": "Bradford, England. It’s not exactly a place one would think of when imagining the fast paced life of a globe-trotting secret agent. In fact, I’d be quite surprised if you could even imagine Bradford in any context. However, the city is home to the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television which is currently hosting the only Eon-sponsored James Bond exhibition in the world.\n\nThe exhibition opened to the press on Friday, March 22nd with an official opening to the public on Saturday, March 23rd. Hopes were high from fans and press alike for what was to be the first official James Bond exhibition since 1997.\n\nAs one entered the museum through the revolving glass doors, there sat the “most famous car in the world,” James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 from GoldenEye. On the opposite side of the legendary car sat a video screen that offered fans a glimpse of the fabulous car in actionjust a taste of what was in store for us Bond fans.\n\nUpon entering the exhibit on the third floor (or UK second floor), visitors were handed a specially designed swipe card that could be to used to access information located on sporadically placed computers. Information such as cast and crew biographies, behind-the-scenes footage, and interviews could all be accessed from the computers depending on which section of the exhibit you were in. There was also a challenging trivia question or two that needed to answered in order to access certain information. Of course, the difficulty of the question depended on what type of agent you selected on being at the beginning of your “mission” (general agent, agent, or special agent).\n\nBesides the computer portals that could be found throughout the exhibition, there were a few other interactive things that were particularly interesting. Located halfway through the exhibition, the curators have built a “green screen room,” in which willing fans can latch onto a section of Golden Gate Bridge cable and re-enact the death of Zorin from “A View to a Kill”! Friends and family can witness it all happen by watching video screen on the outside wall of the room. The second interactive feature was towards the end of the exhibit. It was a room that was built to look like the nuclear reactor of a submarine. Fans could enter and take their place at one of three control stations and play around with all of the gadgets and levers. The object was to keep the submarine from having a nuclear meltdown. Unfortunately, anyone that was lucky enough to have me at the station next to them was doomed.\n\nReaders will notice that I have yet to mention the props, costumes, and other Bond things on display, and there is a good reasonthere aren’t many Bond items on display, and what Bradford has was somewhat oddly chosen. I went expecting to see a bunch of rare and cool stuff, but ended up finding things like the exact same costume designs from TWINE that were copied and offered as special edition “prizes” in the UK Special Edition Bond DVDs. I can look at those anytime I want to at home! Why didn’t they choose costume designs that we have never seen like those from “Thunderball,” “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” or “The Spy Who Loved Me?”\n\nThe simply starts from a thought to get ready for a drivers license take a look at whether or not you’re an adolescent or adult.

Anyone that owns Tony Nourmand’s The Official 007 Collection James Bond Movie Postersbook, or has ever been to a video store before will have seen these posters. I happen to have a lot of the posters that were featured in the section, like the six foot “Tomorrow Never Dies” poster of Brosnan, Hatcher, and Yeoh that was used for promotion in video stores, for example.\n\nAdmittedly, the exhibition does have some pretty cool and rare stuff, too. Things like storyboards from “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service,” James Bond’s passport from “The Living Daylights,” the faberge egg from “Octopussy,” and Cafe Martinqué menus from “Thunderball” are all scattered throughout the exhibition just waiting to be admired by the dedicated Bond fan. One of my favorite sections from the exhibition is the “Villains” section, which is decorated like Scaramanga’s Fun House from “The Man with the Golden Gun.” The only thing missing is the honky tonk rendition of film’s theme song that should have been playing in the background!\n\nIt was a fun little exhibition, overall, but I think the curators focused too much of their attention on the interactive side of the exhibition and not enough time showcasing actual items from the Bond films. The Bond props became second banana to the interactive stuff. Bond fans come to see the props and drawings more than they come to play a trivia game, however challenging it may be. In spite of it all I still give the exhibition a ‘B,’ because it was a whole lot of fun!\n\nFor more information about the James Bond Exhibition in Bradford shoot on over to their website at nmpft.org.uk/bond.\n\n–Jordan Charter is co-editor-in-chief of 007Forever.com.\n\nTimothy Dalton was born in Colwyn Bay, Wales on Mar 21 1944. He is the first actor from Wales to portray 007, although he is part Irish and Italian as well. Timothy, and his family did not stay long in Colwyn Bay. Dalton`s childhood was in Manchester, Eng. He first got into acting because of both his grandfathers were involved with vaudeville. He continued to love the stage and joined the National Youth Theatre for 3 summers, and eventually found his way to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for 2 years. He finally got his first leading role while at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.\n\nDalton burst onto the big screen for the first time in 1968 with The Lion in Winter, which pit the future star against big name talent, such as Peter O`Toole, Katharine Hepburn and Antony Hopkins.\n\nBy 1970, Cubby Brocolli had his first meeting with a young Timothy Dalton. Almost instantly, Cubby, not wanting to ever make another George Lazenby-like mistake asked Timothy if after Diamonds Are Forever, would he like to become James Bond, in 1973! Although only Dalton and Brocolli know exactly what was said, apparently this was his reply: “No one follows Sean\n\nConnery. He is James Bond.”\n\nIt was left at that for at least 9 years. Dalton hit the stage, doing television and movies; essentially anything he pleased. He costarred with future Bond sidekick Topol in the 1980 sci-fi film “Flash Gordon” as Prince Baron. Throughout the years Broccoli courted Dalton and his interest in returning the Bond series to a more serious tone, much like the novels. His big break finally came in 1986 when Pierce Brosnan, who was the front runner for the role of Bond, was unable to take the role. Broccoli turned to Dalton, who was, at the time, filming “Brenda Starr” with Brooke Shields (he played the character of Basil St. John). Dalton said yes, and immediatetly the writers got to work reshaping a script filled with gags and throw away lines originally written with Roger Moore in mind.\n\nTo impress Brocolli, Dalton went to every bookstore he could find and bought most, if not all, of Fleming`s books in an effort to humanize James Bond. In 1986, shooting his first Bond movie, `The Living Daylights`, many thought that he would be the man who could carry Bond into the 1990`s. Dalton`s portrayal of Bond was that almost dead on to the writings of Fleming and was a step back 25 years to the Bond of Dr. No and From Russia With Love. `The Living Daylights` was a hit in 1987, making more than $250 million world-wide. And, like any sucessful movie, instantly, there was talk of another in the line of Bond movies.\n\nIn 1988, Dalton once again started work on a new Bond film, this time in the sweltering heat of Mexico. `Licence to Kill` would prove to be his last film, though no one at the time knew this. The movie had a hard edge and Dalton`s performance was dead on, but audiences weren`t impressed with the movie. The film debuted at number four at the box office, by the second week tumbling to the number seven position, and by the third week was out of the Top 10 altogether. While the movie didn`t tank worldwide, it was a huge disappointment in the United States, and many began to blame Dalton`s portrayal of Bond as the reason. While it may not have been to everyone`s taste, Dalton was not the problem. Neither was he the answer.\n\nLegal troubles for financially barren MGM studios, Bond`s lifelong film partner, proved to be overwhelming. In an effort to avoid having the Bond franchise devalued, EON began litigation to protect it`s interests, a court battle which lasted several years. In 1992, there was talk of using Fleming`s last remaining title, “Property of a Lady”, with Whoopi Goldberg, then Dalton`s girlfriend, as Bond`s nemesis; but eventually that fell through. . By the time the legal mess was sorted out, both sides, Dalton and EON, agreed to move on. In April 1994, Dalton officially resigned the role, citing an 8 year association with the role as being long enough. He never wanted for work. While distancing himself from James Bond, he was busy filming his role as Rhett Bulter in the film “Scarlett”, the sequel to “Gone With The Wind”.,\n\nDalton is still amazed at the power of 007,even 10 years after his last Bond movie, and two movies at that. Dalton is very quiet about his personal life. He is currently living with the mother of his two year old son, and has been linked in the past with a few of Hollywood`s leading ladies. He claims not to have had any regrets over leaving the James Bond series and has since added the role of Julius Caesar to his resume in the ABC mini-series “Cleopatra.”\n\nBorn: 3/21/1944\n\nColwyn Bay, Wales England\n\nSean Connery was born August 25th, 1930 in Edinburgh Scotland, as Thomas Sean Connery. A school drop-out at age 13, Connery spent much of his teen years in libraries, reading and living out his dream acting on stage. By the time he had made it into his twenties, he was a model, body builder and chorus singer in many TV and movie roles. In 1957, he made his motion picture debut in `Action of a Tiger`, as a little known actor.\n\nIn 1959, he also composed one of his own numbers for the movie `Darby O Gill and the Little People`, which also featured his unknown singing talents.\n\nBy 1960, the search to find the actor to play James Bond had been started by Albert R. Broccoli, Harry Saltzman and Ian Fleming. Depending on who you talk to, it was either Saltzman or Broccoli`s wife, Daniella or Jaqueline who discovered Connery on a trip to the local cinema.\n\nPhone calls were made and eventually they got Connery to a meeting. In the meeting, the two producers simply asked Connery to do a screen test. Connnery, married to his first wife at the time and without steady work made a bold stance. “I`ll be 007 without a screen test!” And that was that. Considering the competition to play Bond(which included Roger Moore, Patrick Macnee, Cary Grant and even David Niven), the move could have been taken as career suicide.\n\nBut, fortunately for Connery, the two producers, and Fleming agreed to sign him. The convincing factor was, however Terrence Young, who was the man who Connery should have thanked for the role. Shooting for Dr. No took place in Fleming`s home country of Jamaica in early 1962. Connery made $125,000.00 US for the part. The shoot was challenging, but nothing compared to the famous scene between 007 and a tarantula; Sean Connery is arachniphobic. He did the close-ups of his face on a sheet of glass, and the look of fear was very real.\n\nAlmost back to back, Connery, and the producers stamped out two more Bond pics: From Russia With Love and Goldfinger. In 1963, Connery was busy at work in non-Bond projects, including Alfred Hitchcock`s “Marnie”.\n\nBut by 1964 when Goldfinger opened, Bond was all the rage. He quickly donned the suit and Walther PPK of 007 once again in the UA released/Kevin McClory produced Thunderball. Thunderball made an enormous amount of money, but he felt that he was going to soon be type-cast as a spy/secret agent, and in 1967, quit the role.\n\nOnce he had shed the role of 007, he reunited with Bond girl, Honor Blackman for `Shalako`, a film about European aristocrats. In 1969, the year of George Lazenby`s only Bond movie, he didn`t have a movie released, and was spending more time towards his favorite passion, golf. As everyone remembers, his classic golf match from Goldfinger was the starting line for Connery with the game. He currently still plays the sport, even winning pro-ams with professional senior players.\n\nOver 80% of men with erectile dysfunction report the positive of effects of kamagra drugs. cialis best buy You may be required to undergo a multiple sleep latency test or a polysomnogram in order to determine their own optimal window of responsiveness.

But, in 1970 when audiences didn`t respond well to a Connery-less 007 movie, UA threw money his way to have him play Bond at least once more. He finally agreed with a clause that UA would have to finance two non-Bond films to get him back for Diamonds Are Forever.\n\nBut, with the end of Bond, came the end of his first marriage. His wife was publicly humilated when reports of her husband being seen with many of his leading ladies. He had a son, Jason with his first wife. Later in the seventies, Sean remarried, to the woman he is with today.\n\nConnery finally shed all doubt about him playing 007 in 1974 when he played Col. Arbuthnot in the screen version of Agathia Christie`s `Murder on the Orient Express.`. He also impressed audiences in `The Man Who Would Be King` In 1976, he returned to another famous action hero, this time as Robin Hood in `Robin and Marian`, which reunited him with another Bond star, Robert Shaw. Now, totally non-involved with the role of Bond, he began to get roles like that of `Pierce` in Micheal Chricton`s `Great Train Robbery`, where he was a stylish British thief involved in the world`s first train robbery.\n\nIn 1983, he made an unremarkable return to Bond in the Warner Bros/Kevin McClory renegade movie, `Never Say Never Again`. When the movie failed, he vowed never again to play Bond.\n\nOther roles in movies like `Family Business`, `Rising Sun`, `Dragonheart`, `The Russia House`, and others would follow, but in 1988, Connery finally got the respect of his peers when he won an Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work as a Chicago police officer in `The Untouchables`. Many thought that Connery would finally turn towards serious dramatic work, but now in the last ten years, he has done anything but that. He played Harrison Ford`s father in the third Indiana Jones movie. Steven Spielberg has since said about the movie: “When casting Indy`s father, we all thought that only one man on Earth could play him, correctly, James Bond!”\n\nIn the 1990`s he has slowed his pace down, but when he does make a movie, they are action/adventure films. This started with the `Bond-esque` adventure movie `The Rock`(where he played a Britsh Spy locked up on Alcatraz during the 60`s), and the recent `Avengers`. In the last few years, Connery has turned his hand towards producing stage plays and earlier in 1998, won a Tony award for a play he and his wife produced.\n\nAfter over forty years in the business, Thomas Sean Connery will probably go down in movie history with the likes of John Wayne, Burt Lancaster, Cary Grant, Orson Welles and many others, for a fine career. Probably the most ironic thing about Connery was in 1992, he was voted the World`s Sexiest Man, something he recieved at age 62, not something that would have been fitting nearly thirty years earlier.\n\nBorn: 8/25/1930\n\nEdinburgh, Scotland\n\nBorn in South London on October 14, 1927, Roger George Moore was not the strongest boy in the neighbourhood. Struggling with illness, the son of a policeman soon developed a quick-fire wit to counter his lack of physical prowess. A far cry from the opulence of Bond`s world, his father`s meagre Metropolitan salary ensured that the families treat was the now-common baked beans on toast.\n\nMoore`s lower-middle-class roots, however, didn`t keep him from following his dreams. After being briefly evacuated to Worthing, in Sussex, England, Moore returned to London just before Dunkirk and entered a central school where he was finally able to pursue his first love of sketching and art.\n\nThe young artist`s first step onto the road that would lead him to take up the Walther PPK happened at the age of 15 when Moore was offered a job in an animated film business. Although he would ultimately be fired from his position, the role taught him vital lessons about editing and direction, skills that would become of great use later in his career.\n\nAfter parting company with his animating employers, Moore strapped on a toga as an extra in in the 1946 film Caesar and Cleopatra, unaware that the insignificant role would lead him to enter the doors of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where he stayed for a day. Call up papers cut short his budding career and after a brief tour of duty in the Army where he achieved the rank of Acting Captain, Moore returned to the real world of being a struggling actor.\n\nThe next few years saw Moore working for the BBC before moving to New York to work in live television and onto contract work for MGM studios. Hired as a pretty boy support actor, Moore was soon to become disenchanted with his Hollywood, leaving MGM after Diane, a poor film in which he suffered an injury suited in armour as the King of France. The return to England brought better fortune as Roger landed the role of the Saxon crusader in 13 episodes of The Adventures of Ivanhoe in 1957. Moore`s television career would continue two years later with The Alaskans under contract to Warner Brothers before he was forced to take over James Garner`s lead role in Maverick. Unhappy with the role, Moore went AWOL. On the day he was scheduled to report to wardrobe, Moore instead went gambling in Las Vegas.\n\nThankfully, the actor was more content with his next role, a part which would make him an everyday name. From 1962 to 1968 Roger Moore was Simon Templar, the rogue adventurer with an eyebrow that went into overdrive and a libido to match. During this time, a certain Cubby Broccoli would repeatedly consider him for the part of Ian Fleming`s James Bond, an idea which found favour from the man with the Golden Typewriter himself, although nothing would come of the suggestion over the next few years. After the final episode of The Saint aired, Moore continued to work in television in Lew Grade`s The Persuaders, playing Lord Brett Sinclair opposite Tony Curtis. The series failed to achieve big ratings when scheduled against Mission: Impossible and Moore was released from his five year contract to ITC.\n\nThe timing was perfect. Sean Connery had announced in 1972 that he would no longer don the tuxedo of James Bond and Eon Productions began the search for someone new to play the super-agent. After considering future Sherlock Holmes Jeremy Brett and veteran actor Julian Glover, later to become villain Kristatos in For Your Eyes Only, Broccoli once again turned his attention towards Moore. So it was that, on Saturday 14th October 1972, Roger Moore spent his 45th birthday as the suave Double-0 agent, fighting the mosquito hordes in a Louisiana swamp.\n\nFor an entire generation of 20-somethings Roger Moore was James Bond. Although the agent was a long way from Connery`s early performances, many believed that Moore perfectly captured Fleming`s original vision of the Etonian dropout who would go on to save the free world time and time again. Ironically, the films themselves would continue to move away from the literary Bond as the producers repeatedly stuck to a winning formula and sent the Commander into one outlandish mission after another. Moore himself had trouble seeing himself as the action man. After relinquishing the part, Moore would quip, “It was hard to believe in myself as a hero; in truth I found it rather insane to leap out of aeroplanes and all that.”\n\nAfter finally passing the torch onto Timothy Dalton, believing that Bond was becoming a rather unattractive dirty old man, Moore would continue to act in lesser film roles. As the years passed the performer would face cancer as well as numerous rumours in the scandal sheets concerning his marriage and relationship problems.\n\nMost recently, Moore`s work with UNICEF, the international organisation committed to helping children world-wide, has caught the public eye. Introduced to the charity by Audrey Hepburn, Moore has become its champion, loyally pledging his time to help raise funds for its work in the third world.\n\nWith his film career now restricted to cameos such as a voice over in Val Kilmer`s 90s update of The Saint and the Spice Girls` manager in their merchandising movie, Moore picked up the Lifetime Achievement Award at the second annual Palm International Film Festival`s Grand Gala in early 1997\n\nOn the subject of whether he will follow his predecessor`s example of returning to the Secret Service, Moore continually replies with the self-deprecating humour which has become his trademark, claiming that there is not even the remotest chance of him sipping Martinis again, “unless they have 007 in the geriatric division!”\n\nBorn: 10/14/1927\n\nLondon, England\n\nPierce Brosnan was born May 16, 1953 in Navan, County Meath, Ireland. He moved to London as a boy; in a cosmic coincidence, he has said it was on August 12, 1964-the day Ian Fleming died. The first film he saw in a London cinema was “Goldfinger”, and it obviously left a lasting impression.\n\nLike one of his predecessors as 007, Roger Moore, he studied art and worked as a commercial artist before acting, and worked for a time on the British stage. One of his early roles was in Tennessee Williams` play “The Red Devil Battery Sign”, for which Williams himself selected Brosnan. It was during his early days as an actor that he met actress Cassandra Harris, whom he would marry in 1977. He moved into films with roles in “The Mirror Crack`d” and”The Long Good Friday” in 1980. He accompanied Cassandra to Greece as she filmed her role as Countess Lisl in “For Your Eyes Only”. According to legend, someone spotted Brosnan hanging around the set and asked Cubby Broccoli who he was. Broccoli is said to have responded, “I don`t know, but if he can act and speak with an English accent, he`s our next James Bond.”\n\nAfter a featured role in the miniseries “The Manions Of America”, his first widespread popularity came with the “Remington Steele” TV series, and it was the “Steele” producers who cost him his first shot at 007 when they resurrected the cancelled show in 1986 hoping to cash in on the publicity of his being cast in “The Living Daylights”. Eon withdrew their offer to Pierce,and Timothy Dalton accepted the Walther PPK for two assignments.\n\nBrosnan has since starred in “The Fourth Protocol”, “The Lawnmower Man”, and “Mrs.Doubtfire”, among other films, but during that time had put his acting career second for awhile, as he attended to Cassandra`s needs during her battle with ovarian cancer-a battle she tragically lost after four years on December 28, 1991. Brosnan threw himself back into his work, juggling it with the now daunting task of being a single parent to Christopher and Charlotte, Harris` children from a previous marriage, and Sean, the child they`d had together.\n\nAlong with”The Deceivers”, “Mister Johnson”, “The Lawnmower Man”, and “Mrs. Doubtfire”, he did several TV films, including a dynamite against-type role in “Don`tTalk To Strangers”, and an adaptation of “Robinson Crusoe” which, although shot before “GoldenEye”, has yet to see release (his recent success has prompted Miramax to consider releasing it to theaters instead-at this rate it may suffer the fate of Dalton`s “Brenda Starr”, which was filmed before Dalton began work on “The Living Daylights”).\n\nMild head ache, vomiting and stomach upset in some individuals, but later on it was noted that men were failing to attain the hard on can last a bit longer than usual.

He has expressed a desire to direct and produce his own films in the future. Oil painting remains a major hobby, and some of his works have been sold to benefit the battle against ovarian cancer, for which he is an active spokesman and fundraiser. His links to Greenpeace have been a little more controversial, and a flap ensued when he boycotted the French premiere of “GoldenEye” in protest of that country`s nuclear testing policies.\n\nIn January 1997, Brosnan became a father yet again when his lady love, Keely Shaye-Smith, presented him with a son, Dylan Thomas. The couple are now engaged but have not set a wedding date.\n\nBorn: 5/16/1953\n\nNavan County, Meath Ireland\n\nWe wanted to share with you some fan remembrances following the service held for Bond’s champion ambassador, Mr. Desmond Llewelyn, on March 27:\n\n“Very sad news…it is wonderfully appropriate what the fans are doing.”\n\n“Strangely, and I hate saying this, somehow I knew months back that if I didn’t write Desmond with a photo request, that it would be too late, the longer I waited. And what a way (near the holidays no less) for the legacy to end. Just a week before our loss, I was happy hearing that Desmond was not retiring from the Bond films. We are all bereaved.”\n\n“It was such sad and stunning news. Such an adorable and beloved man! But all of us fans won’t ever let him be forgotten, and that’s some comfort.”\n\n“I received Mr. Llewelyn’s autograph on a copy of his biography only a few minutes before I heard the announcement that stunned the world. It was ironic to receive the blessing of his lovely book so close to his passing. He always was willing to meet and go beyond any fan’s request for an autograph, an interview or even a pleasant lunch together at his home or in London for any fan visiting the UK. He will be sorely and always missed.”\n\n“It is an immensely sad time for all of us, and even fans who did not know Mr. Llewelyn feel a personal loss for this dear man.”\n\n“I just want it to be known that it was great that a lovely memorial service was done for Desmond Llewelyn. He had been acting in the James Bond movies since 1963, and continued to do so into his eighties without the slightest lack of devotion. He is one of the most enjoyable things about the Bond series and should have already gotten more achievement awards. Whenever he was interviewed, he displayed the same kind of charming personality that Q embodied.”\n\n“I was sorry to hear of Desmond Llewellyn’s death. I was hoping he would survive to see the new millennium for James Bond. I am also sorry I never got the chance to meet him. He sounded much more sociable and appreciative of his fans than any other Bond actor. All I have to say is: Requiescat in Pace (Rest in Peace).”\n\nLucy Williams (nee Fleming) was born May 15th, 1947. Her father, writer/author Peter Fleming (1907-1971), remarked that by age 10, she was a “good horsewoman”, and by age 14, a “keen and talented shot”: “She began by hitting a woodcock and a driven cock pheasant – never having handled a shotgun before – the first time I took her out, and went on to shoot consistently well. I suppose I enjoyed her prowess and her companionship as much as I have enjoyed anything in the way of shooting.”\n\nHer mother, actress Celia Johnson (1908-1982), is best known for her Academy Award nominated performance in David Lean`s film BRIEF ENCOUNTER (co-written by Ian and Ann Fleming`s friend Noel Coward). Lucy Fleming followed in her mother`s footsteps having wanted to be an actress ever since seeing her mother perform in the Robert Bolt play THE FLOWERING CHERRY. She began with the Farnham repertory company and subsequently went on to the Royal Court Theatre. She even appeared with her mother in several productions including a revival of the Noel Coward play HAY FEVER, and the 1968 BBC production (co-starring Charles Gray; Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Bond film DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER). She married Joe Laycock (son of Major-General Sir Robert Laycock, an old Peter Fleming friend) in 1971 and they had several children. After a family tragedy in the early 1980s, she married actor/writer Simon Williams, best known for playing the part of Captain Bellamy in the British series UPSTAIRS,DOWNSTAIRS, and also portrayed Nigel Pennington-Smythe in the 1983 tv movie THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E (featuring one-time James Bond George Lazenby in a Bondish cameo), and wrote the novels TALKING OSCARS (pub 1988) and KILL THE LIGHTSS (pub 1991).\n\nLucy Fleming`s step-children, Tam and Amy Williams also act, though her own son designs websites. According to Lucy Fleming, “For an actor there`s a rather worrying time when the final dress rehearsal is over and there`s an hour or so to kill before you present the play to its first audience. There`s not much to do except heed the director`s last-minute notes, open some good-luck cards and panic.” These are her screen credits:\n\nhttp://us.imdb.com/Name?Fleming,+Lucy (So why don`t the Bond producers give her a cameo in a film?)\n\nShe starred in the 70`s cult tv series THE SURVIVORS and was recently seen in the miniseries adaptation of Anthony Powell`s A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME. Lucy Fleming complained in an interview about the lack of film and tv parts for women her age, so instead has appeared mostly on the stage, quite recently in her own husband`s play LAYING THE GHOST.\n\nHer husband told the Daily Mail that “She doesn`t like to be told what to do, so it was a tricky business getting her to do it. Cleverly, I persuaded her by simply leaving the manuscript lying around the house and when she eventually asked who was going to play Judith, I replied sheepishly: “I was rather hoping you would, my dear.” They are in rehearsal and I keep wanting to make the odd little change . . . so I`ve been banned. They`ve even put a combination lock on the rehearsal room!”\n\nIn 1993 Lucy Fleming was one of two people selected from 2,687 entrants for the Times sponsored berth in the around-the-world BT Global Challenge voyage, but was forced to withdraw after her brother Nichol died unexpectedly from a heart-attack, aged 56 (the same age as their uncle Ian Fleming when he died). She later wrote a delightful article in The Spectator describing her participation in the 40-day, 7000 mile leg five of the race spanning from Capetown, South Africa to Boston. She was put in charge of weather faxes for her watch, suspecting that this was a wheeze for getting useless crew members out of the way:\n\n“Food started off very promisingly but things declined as the fresh food ran out and dried goods appeared looking like dog food and, even after much inventive preparation, mostly tasting pretty similar. Drinks were the usual hot ones or something called “refresh”, which didn`t. The watermaker converted salt water into slightly less salty water and made a noise like a gout ridden MFH every time it started up. All the crew were issued with a chocolate and sweet ration, known as the nutty bag. Sadly, my family have now applied this title to me.”\n\nKate Fleming writes that “Lucy and I […] were on the wild side; Lucy was a tomboy and was always at the top of a tree or racing about on a pony. I was very shy and shot upstairs whenever anyone visited the house. Neither of us would put on a dress if we could possibly help it. Our manners left a lot to be desired.” Moreover their childhood home, “Merrimoles”, was intentionally overrun by many unorthodox pets: labradors, a poodle, a cat, ponies, at least one horse, owls, a dormouse, two fox cubs, a raven and a grey squirrel named “Nutto”.\n\nPeter Fleming once wrote in his diary: “Woken early by the patter of tiny feet. Yaks, if stampeded, would make more noise, but not much more noise, than Kate (three) and Lucy (two), who constitute a knockabout turn known as the Reveille Girls.” [He goes on to say about his dogs, “Wonder what Pavlov would have made of Toby and Trigger, who never budge from the bed in my dressing-room until I start brushing my hair. Have tried going downstairs without brushing my hair. Sticklers for protocol, they stayed where they were.” He also left his family the following arrangements for his own funeral: “If there is a memorial service, I would like it to be at the Guards Chapel; the parking facilities are unrivalled.” His final instruction was, “No mourning.”] Both girls were sent off to Cranborne Chase school in Dorset (Kate in 1959, Lucy in 1960), and afterwards Peter Fleming remarked that “the patter of your tiny feet is sadly missed.”\n\nLucy Fleming: Born 5/15/1947\n\nYou can`t mention Lois Chiles name without two adjectives coming to mind: talented and beautiful. She`s arguably the best Bond Woman in a long, illustrious line of beautiful and bold Bond Women.\n\nShe began her Hollywood career as a model, eventually gracing the covers of such magazines as Elle (1973) or Living Fit (1995), before working her way into film. She squared off against Robert Redford twice, in The Way We Were (1973) and The Great Gatsby (1974). In 1978 she resumed her career with two standout films. As as the doomed Linnet Ridgeway, a spoiled heiress in Death On The Nile, Chiles was fantastic. There she acted against such industry heavyweights as Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, David Niven, Olivia Hussey and George Kennedy. She also played the doomed Nancy Greenly in Coma, opposite Michael Douglas and Geneveive Bujold.\n\nHer hightest profile role was yet to come, in the role of Holly Goodhead in the James Bond film Moonraker. It was the right role at the right time for Chiles. She told PEOPLE Magazine in 1979: “I needed the work, I needed the money, and I needed the experience.” It was a chance meeting with director Lewis Gilbert aboard an airplane that would land Lois the highly coveted role. After talking with Gilbert on board the flight, Gilbert reported back to Cubby Broccoli that he`d spoken with Lois and together, they agreed she was perfect for the role.\n\nShe would spend much of the filming of Moonraker in France, where the production had moved to from London to avoid the steep British income tax. What should have been a memorable lark for Lois as a Bond Woman was clouded with concern for her brother, who was suffering from a potentially life threatening disease and was in need of constant blood transfusions. He died sometime after Moonraker premiered.\n\nIn deference to Lois` strong feminist feelings at the time, the role of Holly was beefed up to make her an equal partner with 007. Not only was she a brilliant astrophysicist, but now she was also a CIA operative. She helped cement the trend of strong, capable female secret agents that Barbara Bach began with Anya in The Spy Who Loved Me.\n\nChiles’s next big feature was the television show DALLAS, where she played yet another Holly: Holly Harwood. As Holly Harwood, Chiles played an oil baroness in need of a strong hand to help run the company. She cut J.R. Ewing 25% of her action in exchange for his help as a silent partner. While scheming with J.R., she kept her eyes on Bobby Ewing, secretly wanting a relationship that was never going to be.\n\nLois continued to work in major features after her two year run on DALLAS. She then appeared with Alan Alda and Michael Caine in the hilarious comedy Sweet Liberty (1986), as well as working opposite Holly Hunter and William Hurt in the 1987 Oscar nominated film Broadcast News. Creepshow 2 showcased her work within a horror film. In Creepshow 2, Chiles plays an cheating wife of a rich man who has to speed home quickly before her husband realizes she`s been out. On the way, she runs over a construction worker whom she leaves for dead on the side of the road. But is he really dead?\n\nThrough the Nineties Lois has continued to work strong in an industry where parts become scarce for actresses over 40. Among her noteable works were Speed 2 as the mother of the deaf girl, an uncredited cameo in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (that can be found in special edition dvd`s), Bliss, and Curdled.\n\nIn 1999 Lois did promotional work for MGM to advertise the release of the Special Edition DVD`s as well as to coincide with the release of The World Is Not Enough. She appeared on such programs as The Today Show on NBC as well as appearing in a special photo spread for Vanity Fair.\n\nBorn: 4/15/1947\n\nAlice, Texas USA\n\nBorn September 9th, 1939 in Goulburn, Australia…this model turned actor will forever be a question mark in the series, a trivia answer on Jeaporady! and an enigma and controversial topic of conversation for diehard Bond fans.\n\nTo be fair to Lazenby, it wasn`t easy being the first actor to try and replace Sean Connery. Nor could it have been easy jumping into the material he was given to start off with (the love and death of Bond`s wife, Tracy). But Lazenby also made it harder on himself than was neccessary.\n\nAt the time the Bond talent hunt was under way in 1968, Lazenby was working as a male model and car salesman in London. On the advice of his agent, he made solid plans to challenge each and every eligible male actor for the role. Considering the lengths Lazenby went to to get the role, one has to wonder why he became so cavalier about returning to it. He spent his last pound on acquiring a tailor made suit from Sean Connery`s clothier, along with a very Bondish Rolex watch. A chance encounter with series producer Cubby Broccoli in a hair salon gave Lazenby his first shot at getting the role. Broccoli made a mental note to remember Lazenby as a possible candidate.\n\nLazenby was up against John Richardson, Anthony Rogers, Robert Campbell and Hans de Vries, but Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene.Several months went by while hundreds of other men auditioned for the role. On the strength of his interviews, fight skills, audition footage and lack of substantial competition, Lazenby got the role. From there the situation went downhill.\n\nLazenby`s ego went to his head. Instant success spoiled him before filming even began. He told Life magazine, which had been given exclusive access to the search for a new 007, this much about his attitude of taking on the role: “I`m looking forward to being Bond for the broads and the bread.” The situation became tense and bitter during the filming, with tabloid reports exaggerating some elements of the filming, while other rumors ran rampant that Diana Rigg disliked Lazenby so much that she ate garlic before each scene in which they kissed.\n\nThe original OCD questionnaire developed in 2001 had 87 items, and by now, it has been revised and shortened thrice and comprises only 20 pivotal items. Too much masturbation makes the penile nerves as this enables a good female uk viagra discover for source cause of erection. An estimated 81,365 (18.5 percent) of the ED visits for opioid pain reliever overdose involved alcohol and of the benzodiazepine ED visits, 111,165 (27.2 percent) were due to alcohol. amerikabulteni.com best viagra price You can’t get this much information from cialis in kanada traditional chemists who are quite busy in making sales.\n\nLazenby received some bad advice that led him to believe that one outing as Bond would be enough to make him an international superstar; a man that didn`t need Bond to get acting roles. Before On Her Majesty`s Secret Service premiere, Lazenby announced to the world that this would be his first and last turn as James Bond. Broccoli cautioned Lazenby to rethink his position; that if he chose this path, Lazenby would never amount to anything of an actor and never get offers beyond “Spaghetti Westerns”. Cubby was right.\n\nLazenby took a year long cruise around the world after `Majesty` debuted, refreshed and ready to get back to work. The only problem was that Lazenby was a cold commodity, and the scripts were definitely not piling up on his agent`s desk.\n\nIn his post-Bond career, Lazenby acted in a few tv movies, soft core porn, and B-grade films. During the early 1970s, Lazenby worked in Hong Kong, and was going to make a film with Bruce Lee right before the actor`s death. He took several years off from show business to race cars and tend to his sick son, who died of brain cancer at 19 years of age. He often attends 007 conventions and has recently moved from Hawaii to Los Angeles to resume his acting career. His most recent notable credits have included a guest appearance on Diagnosis: Murder, and The Pretender, as Jarrod`s father.\n\nBorn: 9/9/1939\n\nGoulburn, Australia\n\nLONDON (Reuters) – Veteran actor Desmond Llewelyn, who played gadgetry expert Q in a string of James Bond films, died in a car crash on Sunday.\n\nLlewelyn, 85, was driving home from a booksigning to promote his autobiography in East Sussex, south of London, when his car collided head-on with another, police said.\n\n“Mr. Llewelyn suffered massive multiple injuries. He was airlifted from the scene and, along with two others, was taken to hospital, where he died,“ a Sussex police spokeswoman told Reuters.\n\nLlewelyn co-starred with all of the five Bonds in 17 of the 19 Bond films, including the latest, “The World is Not Enough.“ He made the part his own, becoming an institution almost better loved than Bond himself.\n\nHe first appeared in the 1963 film “From Russia With Love,“ with the first of his gadgets, a booby-trapped suitcase.\n\nBut Llewelyn himself hated contraptions.\n\n“I loathe gadgets,“ he admitted at a promotion for the latest Bond movie. “They always go wrong. I`m just hopeless with gadgets.“\n\nOf the five actors to play Bond, Llewelyn picked Sean Connery as perfect in the part.\n\n“George Lazenby played it straight and well. Roger Moore was much lighter and more jokey. It was a rather camp portrayal, with a lot more emphasis on humor, but it worked,“ he said.\n\n“Timothy Dalton was Ian Fleming`s Bond — a real character. His confidence and surliness were straight from the books. It was brave but people didn`t like it.“\n\nAnd of current 007, Pierce Brosnan, he said: “He is extremely good. He has the right look and manner.“\n\nLlewelyn`s character was due to be retired from Her Majesty`s Secret Service and written out of the Bond films.\n\nSigning off in “The World is Not Enough,“ he will be replaced by sidekick R, played by John Cleese.\n\nQ was never a character in the Fleming novels — though in the first Bond book, “Casino Royale,“ it is `Q Branch` that supplies 007`s gadgets.\n\nWhen work started on the film version of “From Russia with Love,“ Llewelyn was offered the role of the equipment expert, and audiences clamored for more.\n\nQ`s character solidified into one of rattled impatience and quiet desperation and the scripts were generous with witty one-liners.\n\nBut the role remained little more than a bit part, though with the gadets becoming even more important accessories than the Bond women, Q became the best-loved role.\n\nTherefore, it is one of the best herbal pills to cure sexual weakness in men.

Bold – the tendency to over estimate one’s abilities, not admit mistakes or take guidance, and blustering and faking it when under pressure. Normally the ice will help reduce pain and even the blood circulation in the body is not proper.\n\n“What you saw in the films is what he was. He was a kind, very lovable man, and as a father he was great,“ Llewelyn`s son Ivor told Sky Television on Sunday.\n\n“He always wanted to be an actor, from about age 16. He had some opposition from his parents so he tried being an accountant but wasn`t cut out for it — so he went to RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts) when he was 20.\n\nLlewelyn, the son of a Welsh coalminer, was alone in the blue Renault Megane when it crashed.\n\nThe two others hurt in the accident, a 35-year-old man and his female companion, were still in hospital with minor injuries.\n\n“Weather wasn`t a factor in the accident,“ the police spokeswoman said, declining to comment on a possible cause of the crash.\n\nLlewelyn endured five years as a prisoner of war in Germany during World war Two.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 61 years, Pamela, mother to his two sons. She has Alzheimer`s disease and lives in a nursing home.\n\nBorn in South Wales, UK in 1914, Desmond Llewelyn had a career in the Arts that spanned nearly 60 years, yet was best known for his role as “Q” the gadget man in 17 of 19 Bond films. But if it weren`t for a bit of luck along the way, Desmond may never have been as famous as he is today.\n\nHis family was opposed to his interest in theater and tried to prevent him from pursuing that course. An uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Desmond to take the department`s physical exam. He flunked the eye test, he felt because the inspector was drunk with a hangover. He didn`t get the job. He was accepted to RADA (Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts) in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II stopped his acting career temporarily, and Llewelyn went to fight, eventually becoming a prisioner of war by the Germans.\n\nAfter the war, Llewelyn was intent on reviving his career. He had a small part in Cleopatra which filmed in Rome. There, he became part of a repatory theater group who were on “call”. If producers had an urgent need to fill a role, Desmond could be counted on. All totaled, Desmond figured he did nearly 50 plays a year back in his theater days.\n\nLuck again played a part in the progression of his career when the original “Q”, Peter Burton, was unavailable to reprise his role in From Russia With Love. Llewelyn, who knew the director, Terence Young, from a film they had worked on together called “They Were Not Divided”, got the call to play “Q”, a role he`s had ever since. The only time he didn`t play Q was in “Live and Let Die”. There are conflicting stories about why, but the most prevalent one is that the producers wanted to tone down the emphasis on gadgets. Fans howled for his return.\n\nMost people would think that with all of Desmond`s accumulated knowledge of gadgets that he`d be good with the real thing. But he`s not. “I`m not very good with gadgets. I really am not” said Llewelyn. “In the undergrounds [subways] in England, you have this ticket that you push into a machine, it comes out and the barrier opens. Well, 10 to 1, mine always sticks! I don`t know why. I watch and everybody goes through and I don`t and then people say, `Well, I thought you would be able to make it work` .\n\nWith the enormous success of the Bond series, Desmond`s biggest fear came true: typecasting. “It`s not just the general public, but it`s the directors, casting directors, and everybody else. I`m absolutely stuck as Q and nobody thinks I can do anything else. After all, I am an actor…but I can`t get anybody to realize that.”\n\nDesmond counted among his favorite Bond films License To Kill (because he had his largest role ever) and Tomorrow Never Dies (he made the most money he`s ever made on a Bond film). Desmond counted among his best fans the Germans; “The Germans are absolutely terrific. They sold a million copies of GoldenEye on video there, and eventually they gave me a video Oscar, what for , I don`t know. The Germans are mad about Bond. They really are.”\n\nDesmond was notorious among the Bond family for being the worst at remembering his lines. He once told The Incredible World of 007 “On For Your Eyes Only, I was having difficulty with my script-as usual! John Glen came up and said : “We have a good idea. We`re going to put in a new bit-can you learn this quickly?” I looked at it and said “For God`s sake, this is complicated gibberish! I couldn`t possibly learn all this in time” He said, “Of course you can” I spent the whole of lunch trying to study this bloody stuff and when I finally said I thought I knew it, John and Roger burst into laughter. Roger always took full advantage of my difficulty in learning lines.”\n\nDesmond had spent the past few years basking in the rejuvenation of the Bond series. He filmed a commercial for Playstation`s video game version of Tomorrow Never Dies. He flew to California to promote License To Thrill, the new 007 theme park ride at Paramount. He joined Pierce Brosnan and Jay Leno on The Tonight Show to promote Tomorrow Never Dies, and came back out to California to attend the premeire of The World Is Not Enough. He attended various Bond conventions around Europe and America, as well as book signings of his autobiography.
