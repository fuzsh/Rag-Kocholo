        "text": "How old is Pierce Brosnan and where was he born?\n\nFull name Pierce Brendan Brosnan, he was born on May 16, 1953. He celebrated his 70th birthday in 2023.\n\nHe was born in Drogheda, County Louth, and was the only child of parents May (nÃ©e Smith) and carpenter Thomas Brosnan.\n\nHe has the same name as his grandfather, Pierce Brosnan, who was named after his parents' surnames: John Brosnan and Margaret Pierce.\n\nPierce's father abandoned the family when he was a young child. When he was four years old, his mother moved to London to work as a nurse. He was mostly brought up by his maternal grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith.\n\nAfter their deaths, he lived with his aunt and then his uncle, but was eventually sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen.\n\nHe later said: \"Childhood was fairly solitary. I never knew my father. He left when I was an infant. To be Irish Catholic in the 1950s, and have a marriage which was not there, a father who was not there... the mother, the wife suffered greatly.\n\n\"My mother was very courageous. She took the bold steps to go away and be a nurse in England. Basically wanting a better life for her and myself. My mother came home once a year, twice a year.\"\n\nWhen filming an episode of Remington Steele in Ireland, he met his father. He said he expected to see a \"very tall man\" but instead described his father as \"a man of medium stature, pushed-back silver hair, flinty eyes, and a twizzled jaw\" who \"had a very strong Kerry accent\".\n\nPierce spoke of his regret at meeting under such public circumstances, and wished for a more private arrangement.\n\nWho is Pierce Brosnan's wife and how many kids does he have?\n\nPierce Brosnan has been married twice, and was widowed once.\n\nHe met Australian actress Cassandra Harris through her stepson David Harris, the nephew of actor Richard Harris, shortly after leaving drama school.\n\nPierce Brosnan celebrates son Paris's 21st birthday with sweet family photo\n\n\"What a beautiful looking woman,\" he said of Cassandra. \"I never for an instant thought she was someone I'd spend 17 years of my life with. I didn't think of wooing her, or attempting to woo her; I just wanted to enjoy her beauty and who she was.\"\n\nThey married in December 1980, and had one son together, actor Sean, who was born in 1983.\n\nHe also adopted Cassandra's children Charlotte (1971â€“2013) and Chris in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, Cassandra Harris became seriously ill with ovarian cancer, and died on December 28, 1991, aged 43.\n\nPierce said of her death: \"When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way you view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death.\n\nYou're dealing with the possibility of death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look.\n\n\"Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children.\"\n\nIn 1994, Pierce met American journalist Keely Shaye Smith in Mexico.\n\nWhy Pierce Brosnan and wife Keely's 20-year marriage is so beautiful\n\nPierce Brosnan gives perfect retort to man who offered his wife weight loss surgery\n\nThey married in 2001 in Ireland, and they have two sons together named Dylan and Paris.\n\nWhen and how did Pierce Brosnan land the James Bond role?\n\nPierce Brosnan was first linked to James Bond in the mid-1980s, thanks to his impressive appearance in Remington Steele.\n\nHe first met James Bond film producer Albert R Broccoli on the sets of For Your Eyes Only, as Pierce's first wife, Cassandra Harris, had been cast in the film.\n\nBroccoli said, \"if he can act ... he's my guy\" to get the role of Bond from Roger Moore.\n\nPierce Brosnan through the years ðŸ“† #Shorts #PierceBrosnan\n\nIn 1986, US TV network NBC cancelled Remington Steele. Pierce was offered the role of James Bond, but this publicity improved Remington Steele's ratings and it was renewed, contractually keeping Pierce in the show.\n\nThis meant that Bond producers had to look elsewhere, and went to Timothy Dalton.\n\nLegal disputes between Bond producers and studio Eon over distribution rights resulted in the cancellation of a third Dalton film in 1991.\n\nAfter being on hold for years, Dalton didn't return, and in 1994 Pierce was announced as the fifth actor to play Bond."
