        "text": "Over the years here at Den Of Geek, I’ve written countless times about the nature of hero worship. It’s a subject that utterly fascinates me, especially in the context of action movies. The reason I’m telling you this now is because in the rather lengthy article that follows, there’s a distinctly personal stance on the films that I hold to be Pierce Brosnan’s best as, for me, he’s one of the greatest screen heroes of all time. It’s fair to say that it’s taken years for me to finish this list – not because of the length, but because of how important the films are to me. I’m more than aware of how strange that sounds, but hopefully by the end of the article this introduction will make more sense.\n\nIn short, Brosnan managed to embody the best of all the James Bonds, using Connery’s brutality, Moore’s charm and Dalton’s coolness to make arguably the finest rendition of the super spy to date. During his time as Bond, Brosnan had some of the most emotional and downright incredible moments, many of which are listed below, but when GoldenEye burst on the screen it was the first time I remember feeling like there was finally a modern Bond that connected on a personal and relevant level, while remaining faithful to Bond’s rich history.\n\nA love of Bond aside, the choices below reflect a diverse career that saw him take multiple chances at the height of his career, with some fine results. The most curious thing that presented itself when looking at Brosnan’s career as a whole were the themes that seem to have remained constant in most of his work.\n\nHe has a fine track record for starring in literary adaptations, with Ian Fleming, John Le Carré, Alistair MacLean, Stephen King and Frederick Forsythe all making contributions. Then there’s the drinking, smoking, spying and shagging – at one point I even considered making the screencaps just out of those shots – though it should also be noted that most of his leading ladies have all been age appropriate too, a theme especially relevant in The Thomas Crown Affair. That said, most of his onscreen relationships with women have remained difficult to say the least, with everything from good old fashioned divorce, to death by volcanic rock causing upset for his characters.\n\nThis being a DOG list, there will obviously be a sway towards his more geek oriented roles, though as with any top ten I usually refrain from putting more than one movie from a franchise on the list, although having said that…\n\n10. Tomorrow Never Dies\n\n“You made your bed.”\n\nTo hell with it, let’s make an exception for once and apply the playground rules of ‘my bat, my ball.’ I love Tomorrow Never Dies, so it would be totally remiss of me not to mention it in slightly more detail, especially as it never quite seems to have received the same level of praise as GoldenEye. For the record, Tomorrow Never Dies would rank near the top of this list, but since it shouldn’t really be here, in at number ten it goes. Plus it also knocks out After The Sunset, which means I don’t have to confess that there’s a Brett Ratner film I like.\n\nThe strengths of Tomorrow Never Dies are manifold. It marked the debut of David Arnold’s terrific run as the Bond composer, and for my money the Tomorrow Never Dies soundtrack is the most exciting, especially as it reintroduced the classic Bond theme that many had missed in Eric Serra’s experimental score for GoldenEye. The sublime mix of techno with the classically orchestral added to its individuality, with Arnold even tapping The Propellerheads for a contribution to the track Backseat Driver, as he’d been working with them for his album Shaken And Stirred, which covered and reworked the classic Bond opening songs. Frustratingly, though, Mr Arnold had also concocted a belter of an opener with k.d. lang entitled Surrender, but was overruled in favour of the more ‘populist’ choice of Sheryl Crow by the producers.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies also contains what I hold to be the best of Brosnan’s James Bond performances, as he seems to have utterly relaxed into the role after his superb, but high pressure debut in GoldenEye. There’s a sense of complete ease to his portrayal, like Bond had become a second skin, and the story allows for a much more powerful emotional core with a rare connection to a female character in Teri Hatcher’s Paris Carver – adding an element of tragic revenge gave a greater motivation to Bond’s often basic ‘For Queen, country and a good shag’ trajectory. The “You made your bed” seduction scene still holds up as one of the franchises most believably passionate too, as well as being the most bitey.\n\nIf GoldenEye had instantly launched Pierce Brosnan as a heroic icon for me, then Mars Attacks! was the film that cemented my eternal loyalty and adoration. Fresh from the extreme high profile re-launch of Bond, he could so easily have taken the safe route and rejected any risky film roles – I can’t imagine his agent being terribly thrilled at the idea of becoming a disembodied head, yet there it was for the entire world to see. Sure the supporting cast was incredible, but someone like Jack Nicholson had already worked with Burton on one of the biggest (certainly financially) films of his career with Batman and, like Glenn Close, was more established and therefore more able to take a gamble.\n\nDismemberment aside, the reverence and sleazy charm with which Pierce plays Professor Donald Kessler is pure B-movie in its tone and made for some of the films’ finest comedy moments, in fact I was so enamoured that my friend Dan actually bought me a pipe for my birthday, just so I could try and emulate the look.\n\nBack in a time before Sex And The City, Sarah Jessica Parker was also part of Burton’s gang and I adored her for it, with the scene in which her character, Nathalie, interviews and mutually flirts with Kessler being one of my favourites. That their combined fate is so twisted, it really does add to the unique charm of the film as a whole and adds a level of tragic comedy that is quite haunting.\n\nI’m still in awe that the movie was ever made in the first place and remains for me one of the greatest examples of Burton’s work, being as funny as it is disturbing. After Burton and Brosnan’s fine work together on Mars Attacks! I was almost beside myself with happiness when the Superman Lives rumours had Pierce cast as Brainiac, back when Burton and Nic Cage were both involved, as that really would’ve combined four of my favourite things in the world. More’s the pity that it never happened, as I’m still convinced it would have been amazing.\n\nAt the time of Mars Attacks! release there was talk of screening a version of the film before the CGI Martians (Burton originally wanted stop-motion, but was convinced by an effects team that CG could replicate the look he wanted) had been added, with all the actors reacting to thin air and I still live in hope it will happen. It’s a great shame that no effort has been made to make a special edition on DVD or Blu-Ray so far, as it’s a film that just doesn’t seem to get the recognition it deserves. Consider this a beg, Warner Bros.\n\n2. The Matador\n\nI immediately fell in love with GoldenEye and everything about it, claiming Brosnan and the film as the best Bond of all time. I felt connected to the material and the character like never before, with both women and alcohol being a dominant part in my life by that point, while the set pieces satiated the action movie junkie in me that had been left unfulfilled by the years that followed the end of the 80s. In fact, 1995 would prove to be quite the renaissance for action movies, as it saw the appearance of a fresh new talent in Mr Michael Bay and his Bad Boys.\n\nTo this day GoldenEye remains both one of the best James Bond films and one of my all-time favourite movies, and Pierce Brosnan my favourite Bond. I appreciate that everyone has their own preference, but certainly Sean Connery, as good as he was, was before my time and therefore too far removed for any real sense of connection. Moore was comically smarmy, a trait that my childhood self was blissfully unaware of, Lazenby I still can’t take to, while Dalton remains a close second to me for exactly the same reasons as Brosnan, with The Living Daylights holding an equally high rating.\n\nWhile there has been much made over the years about how Pierce’s contractual obligations to Remington Steele had stopped him taking over the Bond mantle earlier in his career, it seemed perfectly timed from my point of view, as his earlier work had essentially groomed him for the hopeful eventuality that his time would come. There’s such an unadulterated joy to Brosnan’s first appearance as Bond, a sense of release and reward for all his patience and it has utterly shaped his career that followed.\n\nOnatopp of the perfect direction (sorry) from Martin Campbell, who would later be trusted with the daunting task of rebooting Bond yet again with Casino Royale, there’s the perfect cast. Dame Judi Dench, Desmond Llewelyn, Samantha Bond, Robbie Coltrane, Alan “I am invincible!” Cumming, Joe Don Baker (who’d played a Bond villain in The Living Daylights and also appeared in Mars Attacks!), Tchéky Karyo, as well as two of the best Bond girls in Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen – there’s even a cameo from Minnie Driver.\n\nThere was also someone else… a villain maybe? Something I’m missing? Oh no wait, it was the legendary Sean Bean. As well as being one of my favourite actors, Bean also holds his own as one of the finest Bond villains, which was an element that was sadly lacking from the following movies. The idea of having a defective 00 agent was inspired, as it provided an intellectual equal to Bond while, more importantly from an action standpoint, a physical equal. There is such a lack of genuinely exciting punch ups in mainstream action movies, with most denouements resolved in a hail of gunfire, yet GoldenEye managed to include a great one that worked alongside the other set pieces, choosing an intimate confrontation instead of trying to top what had gone before.\n\nAs a side note: When I had the chance to interview Sean Bean the other year, it was an absolute moment of breathtaking euphoria when I asked him about GoldenEye and he pulled up his sleeve to reveal that he was still wearing his Bond watch.\n\nThere is nothing I don’t adore about GoldenEye, even down to Eric Serra’s controversial score, as it still helped to launch a new era of Bond. Just writing about it has made me want to watch it again, but nothing will compare to that fateful day in Coventry back in 1995.\n\nThe movie that started it all just had to be at the top.\n\nAlso recommended:\n\nThe World Is Not Enough\n\nQuite an underappreciated Bond movie. As far as I can tell only tarnished retrospectively by Die Another Day’s insanity and Denise “somebody’s tampered with tha’baam” Richards casting. It has one of my favourite opening scenes featuring the straightening of a tie under water, which is fuelled by David Arnold’s superlative track ‘Come in 007, your time is up’, there’s the reappearance of Robbie Coltrane, an ice cold Bond girl in Sophie Marceau, a fine turn of evil from Robert Carlyle, sadly the last appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q and of course a frightening revelation for M as she witnesses the true brutality of 007, which is one of the best Bond moments.\n\nDie Another Day\n\nSadly suffering from its plans to show the torture of Bond being softened into the opening credits, Die Another Day is all over the place. After a solid first act, things take a turn for the worse after the plastic surgery plot disaster, with Halle Berry pretending to be tough and failing. I have no problem with the invisible car and love both the sword fight and Rosamund Pike, but when the climax involves fighting a yuppie in a robot suit and tsunami surfing, you have to question what on earth happened to the script during the shoot.\n\nThe Fourth Protocol\n\nA twist on his tradition of playing a spy, as this time he’s a rotter of a KGB agent who’s pitted against a smart talking government agent, played with Bondian charm by Michael Caine. It’s another literary adaptation, with a screenplay by Frederick Forsyth and a fine Cold War spy thriller that almost made the list. It’s notable for a fine supporting cast, a score by Lalo Schifrin, Caine beating up some Nazi punks and Pierce enjoying spying on a sexy party, with a most amazing leer. The two leads spend the movie apart though, so I’m curious as to whether they actually filmed any scenes together.\n\nAlistair MacLean’s Death Train (aka Detonator)\n\nAka Pierce on a train. Also stars Patrick Stewart and Christopher Lee in their wilderness years.\n\nNight Watch (aka Detonator II)\n\nAka Pierce as a thug in a suit. The cover says it all. Amazing facial hair.\n\nAfter The Sunset\n\nUndemanding fun, with great support from Woody Harrelson, Don Cheadle and Salma Hayek. It utterly pains me to include a movie made by Brett Ratner, though.\n\nThe Ghost\n\nA cracking, brooding thriller with a great Brosnan-as-Blair performance, but not enough screen time for it to count on this list.\n\nMrs Doubtfire\n\nI have still never forgiven Robin Williams for attempting to poison poor Pierce in this documentary about the trials of divorce. Bad Robin Williams.\n\nNomads\n\nWatch Pierce beat Adam Ant to death with a steel pipe! Also marks an early movie for Die Hard and Predator director, John McTiernan.\n\nButterfly On A Wheel\n\nPierce plays a ‘wee boy from Glasgee’ for some strange reason, but manages to intimidate the shit out of man-mountain, Gerard Butler. Good, simple fun with a few twists and turns along the way, plus the lovely Maria Bello.\n\nLaws Of Attraction\n\nStandard rom-com fare, but elevated by pairing the great man with the resplendent Julianne Moore.\n\nMamma Mia\n\nThe voice of an angel. Seriously, I love the man that much that when he sings SOS I actually think it sounds great. Now I know just how Donald Sutherland feels in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.\n\nMarried Life\n\nA fine ensemble drama which I happened to catch randomly on TV while abroad, having never heard mention of it before. Chris Cooper steals the show, but a solid performance from Brosnan, which includes a noir-esque voice over and some fine hat wearing, makes it a worthy addition to his CV.\n\nEvelyn\n\nEven the trailer made me cry.\n\nEntangled\n\nI only watched this recently after tracking down a copy on eBay and it’s gloriously terrible. It easily ranks as a ‘so bad it’s good’ movie and also co-stars an unhinged Judd Nelson. Everyone seems to be acting in entirely different movies, the ending is completely mental and nonsensical, while Nelson bursts into shouting fits at random intervals. Glorious. Watch with beer and friends, not alone and sober like I did.\n\nHe also infamously cameos in The Long Good Friday and has a good supporting role in Remember Me.\n\nAvoid:\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces\n\nBrosnan and Jeff Bridges fall victim to the witchcraft of Streisand and spend the duration of the movie pretending to be attracted to her, which is actually quite nauseating, though sleazy Brosnan is always a treat. I refer to this film as ‘for the love of Pierce’, which was entirely the motivation for watching it.\n\nPercy Jackson And The Lightning Thief\n\nA movie with a stellar cast, which even re-united Brosnan with Sean Bean, yet left me feeling utterly disappointed, which is a feat as I have a large soft spot for kids’ fantasy movies.\n\nTaffin\n\nDespite having gained fame from the Adam and Joe YouTube meme, it’s the only film he’s made that I turned off halfway through even at the height of my love, as I just couldn’t get into its plodding pace. It does, however, feature a rare early appearance from Alison Doody of Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade fame.\n\nFollow our Twitter feed for faster news and bad jokes right here.
