        "text": "Naomie Harris, Pierce Brosnan and Tom Burke have joined the high-flying cast of Black Bag, the spy thriller that Steven Soderbergh is directing for Focus Features.\n\nCate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Regé Jean Page and Marisa Abela are already in Bag, whose plot details are being kept under the trench coat. David Koepp wrote the script.\n\nProduction begins in May in London, with Casey Silver and Greg Jacobs producing.\n\nHarris earned an Academy Award nomination for her work in Barry Jenkins’ 2016 drama Moonlight and is known for playing Moneypenny in the Daniel Craig James Bond movies. She recently starred with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the Netflix series The Man Who Fell to Earth. The actress is repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment and U.K.’s The Artists Partnership.\n\nBrosnan knows his way around spy movies as the actor played James Bond in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He starred in a trio of movies in 2023, including the Netflix caper comedy The Out-Laws with Adam Devine and Ellen Barkin. He is repped by CAA and Hansen Jacobson."
