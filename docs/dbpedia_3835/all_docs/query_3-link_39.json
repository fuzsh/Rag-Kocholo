        "text": "I love Pierce Brosnan as an actor In general, he is my all time favorite actor.\n\nI love the most his Bond type of roles where he plays the sexy leading man and his charm and sex is in full display\n\nExamples\n\nThe Thomas Crown affair\n\nHe was just perfect for that role and his chemistry with Rene Russo was hot.\n\nI could say this is one of the sexiest films I ever seen and Pierce was pure perfection in it, I would dare to say he was even better than Steve McQueen in the 60s version and I liked much more the ending of the remake with Pierce and Rene.\n\nAfter the sunset\n\nI loved seeing him with Salma in this film, another actress who was perfect for him.\n\nI loved the mix between a heist flick and romance.\n\nHis last scene where controls the car and Woody is lucked in there reminds so much to the scenes where Q made his demostrations to his new car.\n\nIf it was a bond movie I could have imagined woody say grow up 007\n\nI also like when he explores his darker side in films like Butterfly on a wheel and the tailor of Panama.\n\nHe was great in Both.\n\nNow I also loved him as a darker action hero in The November man in the style of the taken flicks. A more serious action.\n\nI recently had a Pierce Brosnan marathon (a Brosanathon if you will). In the most part, his career hasn't been overly stellar post-Bond. I would say my biggest takeaway was that Brosnan actually did his best work in his career as 007. What do we think?\n\nI started with The Misfits, which I saw pop up on Amazon (I was also aware of some toxic reviews). So naturally I gave it a watch. It isn't so bad - I mean, it's perfectly watchable (despite it being pretty unremarkable and easy to forget) in an outdated 90's throwback vein. At worst, it can be cringeworthy, tone deaf and offensive. I suppose the movie is aiming to be a blend of Ocean's 11 (it's not half as witty or slick) and the Fast & Furious (as dumb but not as enjoyable). Jamie Chung is the real standout, but Nick Cannon torpedoes the film. Also, I'm convinced this film must have been paid for by the Abu Dhabi tourist board (it would make a stunning 007 location). I liked Brosnan's performance - his charisma just about carries the film. Broz's arc as an old grifter having to reconnect with his daughter (Hermione Corfield, who is beautiful but sadly no actress) could have made a good movie in its own right. His supposed romantic spark is waning though and Broz is looking a little more like Jeremy Clarkson than usual. He even sneaks in a homage to Roger Moore....\n\nUp next was A Long Way Down. This is a misjudged film that never feels believable. The subject matter was perhaps not the best one for a quirky Richard Curtis-esque comedy. I recently watched Birdman again and that film's handling of suicide was far more poetic and elegiac. This film's handling of depression feels like the greeting-card alternative. Pierce Brosnan in Richard Madeley mode has its appeal. However, he recedes from the movie after the opening scene (though he has a fantastic line reading in the penultimate moments alongside Aaron Paul). Imogen Poots is kinda annoying, but eventually wins you over with her overcooked eccentricity (Queen Pixie of the Manic Dreamgirl Brigade). In the end it is actually Toni Collette who makes the deepest impression. Otherwise, the chief pleasure of this film is seeing Pierce Brosnan reteam with DAD's Rosamund Pike to play British morning show hosts.\n\nThe Love Punch probably isn't a film made for me. Its main demographic would appear to be retired, middle class couples living in the home counties. Essentially, the film is an episode of Chucklevision for the 60+ crowd. Though there are certainly some charms on display. In particular, Brosnan and Emma Thompson who have such likeable and winning chemistry. I'd watch them team up for a sequel or another project. So...is this a good film? Probably not. However, it works as a piece of good-natured lightweight entertainment. Also, Pierce looks as handsome as ever. I particularly adored his attire in an early scene which has him sipping a martini (DC didn't look this good in NTTD).\n\nNext up was Survivor. This is a clunker. The poster promised that this would be a solid B-Movie. However, the truth is quite the opposite. The storytelling is nonsensical and the characters are threadbare at best. The notion of Brosnan playing a cold assassin is exciting - but this film doesn't live up to that promise. The most interesting thing about his character is the moustache that keeps disappearing between scenes. In any case, this is a very handsomely made film. Clearly the filmmakers have watched Skyfall and have attempted to replicate that film's visual style (there's even a shot which directly rips off the Shanghai fight). Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see Rege-Jean Page cameo in the film. If he is cast as the new Bond, would this be the first occasion that two Bond actors have co-starred in a film?"
