        "text": "James Bond alum Pierce Brosnan is returning to his espionage roots. The actor is attached to star in A Spy’s Guide to Survival from director Simon Barry, the creator behind Netflix series Warrior Nun.\n\nUri Singer’s Passage Pictures is producing the project that centers around a reclusive, retired spy who is brought out of hiding by his enigmatic new neighbor, digging up both of their secrets in the process.\n\nBarry will also write the film based on a story by him and his father, Derek Barry. The project will mark Simon Barry’s feature directing debut.\n\nBarry’s Reality Distortion Field is producing alongside Singer’s Passage Pictures. Fortitude International, which will be financing, will represent international sales at the Cannes market, with Fortitude’s Nadine Barros executive producing.\n\n“As a longtime Pierce Brosnan fan, I’m extremely grateful to have the opportunity to work alongside someone I admire for their craft, character and humanity,” said Barry.\n\nSinger added: “Pierce is the perfect fit for this role, and we are so excited to see what he and Simon will do together.”\n\nBrosnan, repped by CAA and Hansen Jacobson, was recently in theaters with DC superhero movie Black Adam, drama The Last Rifleman and action thriller Fast Charlie. Brosnan debuted his first solo art exhibition, “So Many Dreams.”\n\nBarry is represented by Gersh. Singer is repped by Knol Hanly PC."
