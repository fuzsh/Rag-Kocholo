        "text": "Pierce Brosnan, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley are set to star in The Thursday Murder Club, with Chris Columbus attached to write and direct.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of British TV host and producer Richard Osman‘s novel of the same name. Osman confirmed the news on his podcast, The Rest is Entertainment, today. Steven Spielberg‘s production house, Amblin Entertainment, is making it.\n\nThe story follows a group of geriatric friends in a retirement home who gather to solve murders for fun, but find themselves caught in a real case. Mirren will play ex-spy Elizabeth, Kingsley will play ex-psychiatrist Ibrahim and Brosnan will play former union activist Ron. Negotiations for an actress to play the fourth member of the group, Joyce, are ongoing.\n\nFilming will begin in the UK at the end of June and run through to September, said Osman. Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire and Harry Potter director Columbus is directing and adapting Osman’s best-selling book for the big screen.\n\nOsman’s novel, his first as an author, has sold more than ten million copies and led to several sequel books. He sold the rights to The Thursday Murder Club to Spielberg in 2020, and work has been ongoing since then.\n\nOsman is best known as a British TV presenter on BBC game show Pointless and Richard Osman’s House of Games. He has numerous appearances on UK comedy shows such as 8 Out of Ten Cats Does Countdown. Before his on-screen career, he was a well-known entertainment television executive, working at Hat Trick Productions and Big Brother producer Endemol UK, where he was Creative Director and produced the likes of Deal or No Deal. He officially left the company in 2020, when it was known as Endemol Shine UK.\n\nJeff Sneider first had news of the casting."
