Throw in the late, great James Caan in his final role and Fast Charlie should be rocketing to the top of your must-see films list Based on the novel Gun Monkeys by Victor Gischler, Fast Charlie has added pedigree from screenwriter Richard Wenk, who has written a host of tough-guy actioners including The Equalizer movies and 16 Blocks. Without giving too much away, Noyce’s film features grit, violence, and plenty of dark humour. Brosnan shows that he still has what it takes to play a convincing badass – even at the age of 70. I’ll give a more detailed rundown of the Fast Charlie closer to release.  I spoke with Phillip Noyce just before he started shooting Fast Charlie – he was promoting The Desperate Hour  – and seemed thrilled with the prospect of working with Brosnan.

And he must prove it’s the intended target to the man who paid for the hit – New Orleans’ most prominent and most ruthless mobster, Beggar Mercado (Gbenga Akinnagbe). Charlie enlists Marcie Kramer (Morena Baccarin), the victim’s ex-wife and a woman with the backbone and skill set Charlie needs.\n\nDragging Marcie back into a past she was determined to escape sends the two of them on a wild and unpredictable odyssey that’s unexpectedly amusing, action propelled, and ultimately heartfelt. Along the way, Charlie and Marcie fight to protect the legacy of Charlie‘s best friend and mentor, Stan Mullen (James Caan in his final performance), while bringing down Beggar and his entire operation.\n\nThe trailer:\n\n<\n\np style=”text-align: center;”>"
