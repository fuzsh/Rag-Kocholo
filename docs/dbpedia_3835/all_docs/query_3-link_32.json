        "text": "Preview:\n\nPierce Brosnan, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley will lead ‘The Thursday Murder Club’.\n\nChris Columbus is adapting the novel and directing.\n\nShooting will kick off this summer.\n\nThe detective genre is an evergreen one for books, TV series and movies, but with so many out there in the world, it’s always good to find a solid new spin.\n\nAnd while the concept of older people solving murders/crimes in general is far from a novel concept, especially in the UK (if you’ve never heard of the idea, 'Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple' would like a word), it has been turned into a hugely successful novel series by British TV executive-turned-game show host and author Richard Osman.\n\nHis novel ‘The Thursday Murder Club,’ published in 2020, has become a big hit, spawning three follow-ups to date (with a fourth on the way), and now, somewhat naturally a film adaptation is gearing up with Pierce Brosnan, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley in the lead roles.\n\nWhile Jeff Sneider broke the first word of the casting via his newsletter, Osman has since confirmed it on the podcast he co-hosts, ‘The Rest is Entertainment’.\n\nRelated Article: Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren Will Lead the Cast for New ‘Yellowstone’ Prequel ‘1932’\n\nWhat’s the story of ‘The Thursday Murder Club’?\n\nThe books’ narrative follows a group of geriatric friends in a retirement home who gather to solve murders for fun but find themselves caught in a real case.\n\nMirren will play ex-spy Elizabeth, Kingsley will play ex-psychiatrist Ibrahim and Brosnan will play former union activist Ron.\n\nThere is a fourth member of the gang, Joyce, but while a choice has apparently been made, Osman couldn’t specify since negotiations are continuing on that front.\n\nWho is making ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ movie?\n\nOsman sold the rights to Steven Spielberg’s Amblin company in 2020, shortly after the first book became a hit, and development has been quietly proceeding since then.\n\nSo, who has the company chosen to adapt a popular series of novels set in the UK it hopes will spawn a successful franchise (and has form working with Spielberg)? Step forward Chris Columbus, who helped kick off the gigantic ‘Harry Potter’ film series and will be writing and directing here.\n\nWith Osman aboard as an executive producer, production is scheduled to start at the end of June and run through September.\n\nAnd though the concept might seem more niche than the adventures of a boy wizard, that casting will certainly help push the idea here and beyond.\n\nWhen will ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ be in theaters?\n\nVariety recently announced that Netflix has picked up the movie, but no release date has been set.\n\nOther Chris Columbus Movies:\n\n'Adventures in Babysitting' (1987)\n\n'Heartbreak Hotel' (1988)\n\n'Home Alone' (1990)\n\n'Only the Lonely' (1991)\n\n'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' (1992)\n\n'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993)\n\n'Nine Months' (1995)\n\n'Stepmom' (1998)\n\n'Bicentennial Man' (1999)\n\n'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' (2001)\n\n'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' (2002)\n\n'Rent' (2005)\n\n'I Love You, Beth Cooper' (2009)\n\n'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief' (2010)\n\n'Pixels' (2015)\n\n'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two' (2020)"
