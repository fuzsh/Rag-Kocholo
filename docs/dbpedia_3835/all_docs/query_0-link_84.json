        "text": "Bosnan's career is a little hit and miss, its clear that he was an actor always more interested in commercial oppurtunies then more arty fare. Having said that though he in fantastic in the indie film, The Matador. The film is undeniably the best Brosnan performance out there.\n\nThe premise of the movie: an oddball comedy about a businessman and a hitman having to team up; could have been a very tired, tested and formulaic affair. However, Richard Shepard really created something very new, exciting and most of all fun with The Matador.\n\nThe film isn't quite the straight-faced Coen brothers brand of black comedy, and nor is it the out-and-out Will Ferrell type laugher, instead the film exists between the two and what we get is a rather interesting dark-comedic character study.\n\nThe movie is really about the friendship between these two men, who on the surface are very different but actually beneath are relatively similar. Both are lost, but while one is looking for a confidant the other is looking for an escape and a bit of excitement. Kinnear does hold his own but it's Brosnan who runs away with the film. His Julian Noble is a gift of character, and not for the obvious 'shedding the Bond image' reasons, but because Julian Noble really walks into the film fully-formed and is never apologetic for who is he and never at any point feels a need to justify himself.\n\nI truly forget I was watching Pierce at times and only in occasional turns of phrase or looks to camera was I reminded 'shit, thats James Bond!' Brosnan transforms for the role, ditching his suave ladykiller persona and instead adopts the brass, sleazy persona of Julian (a perfect image to summarise this comes when Julian plays the bongos on a hooker's arse as she walks up some stairs). So lets forget all that talk of how Brosnan is deliberately stepping out of his Bond character, because at the end of the day the guy's an actor and it's his job to make you believe and invest in a host of different characters. And its this that Brosnan does so damn well with Noble.\n\nThe movie is fundamentally a character study, as we explore A hitman past his prime and slowly loosing his edge. Furthermore, the guy is having a massive existential crisis as well as having a nervous breakdowns and panic attacks everytime he's on a job. Not a good trait for a professional assassin. Brosnan plays the lightness of the role, he can handle the sleazy uncouth nature of the man (cracking a penis joke when Kinnear tells him about his dead son), but he can also brings a real pain to the guy, the moment he tells Danny that he is his only friend is genuinely affecting and Brosnan's final meltdown is rather harrowing stuff.\n\nIt's a great movie, its a rare thing to think once the end credits roll that you could have happily sat through more of this, but it's how I felt. I hope they can do something more with The Matador, if not a sequel maybe a TV series or something. Richard Shepard write a hell of script and Brosnan is show-stealing good in it.\n\nI recently watched 'Seraphim Falls' for the first time last night and I have to say I was rather impressed in the most part. If you're a Brosnan fan I really recommend it, if you're not then watch it for John Toll's fantastic cinematography. The scenery and Toll's compositions are really first rate, this final confrontation being a highlight:\n\nThe film itself is also really good and somewhat surprising. It is essentially a chase picture with Neeson spending the whole runtime hunting Brosnan's character. There have been a lot of revisionist westerns recently but this film isn't really witty or glib about it's genre and is very much a pure western in that sense. There is something rather refreshing about this approach as the film has a whole 'man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do' vibe from yesteryear.\n\nThe best part of the film is the opening half-hour which is practically wordless. This part is where the film is at it's best as it operates and runs like a great thriller. When we are introduced to the leads we dont know who to root for. It seems that we are supposed to be on Pierce's side as we see the man endure great hardships against Neeson's tough Colonel. But it's ambiguous, Brosnan does some awful things and we're constantly reminded that there is a dark horrible reason why Neeson is hunting him. This shifting idea of who is the antagonist and who is the protagonist runs throughout the film and is very good.\n\nThe real problem with the film is that it becomes rather stoggy and slow-moving after this as you have to wait 1hr 30 to find out the reason why Neeson is hunting this guy and the reason isn't particularly inventive or new. This means the film starts to really feel it's 115 minutes and can be somewhat dry and predictable. It could do with loosing 15minutes and more emphasis should have been placed on the 'thriller' aspect of the plot. I enjoyed it nonetheless as the film is essentially a very visceral purely cinematic story with little dialogue relying solely on visuals. The survival story is also charming as we see Brosnan endure the elements with the freezing forests and the scorching deserts.\n\nA few critics say the finale is a little ham-fisted and too allegorical in it's anti-war statement. I quite liked it and thought it was surprisingly impact and deep as both these men gain some kind of peace. One having been filled with rage and anger and the other with remorse and guilt. I also thought it was a nice note to end on considering the films themes of violence, repercussions of violence and revenge.\n\nThe acting is great across the board but Brosnan has the best role. If Bond showed he could be suave and charismatic and the 'The Matador' showed he was a great comic actor then 'Seraphim Falls' shows that he's a good actor period. He's very affecting and powerful in the film especially those silent opening 30mins."
