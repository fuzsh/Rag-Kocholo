        "text": "Post by eaz35173 on\n\nwww.catholicvote.org/catholic-at-heart-pierce-brosnans-imperfect-yet-saving-faith/\n\nCATHOLIC AT HEART: PIERCE BROSNAN’S IMPERFECT YET SAVING FAITH\n\nBY KATE O'HARE\n\nIt would be a beautiful world if cradle Catholics remained faithful all their lives, and if converts (because, in this scenario, there wouldn’t be any reverts, like me) came to the Faith all unspotted and pure, with no nagging personal issues mucking up the place.\n\nA beautiful world, yes, but not this world.\n\nLet’s take the case of “Remington Steele” and James Bond star Pierce Brosnan, 61, who plays a depressed, suicidal TV personality who finds an unexpected surrogate family, in the new movie “A Long Way Down.”\n\nIn his early 20s, the Irish-born Brosnan married Cassandra Harris, who died in 1991 of ovarian cancer. In 2013, he lost Cassandra’s daughter Charlotte (Brosnan adopted her and brother Christopher after the death of their father, Harris’ second husband, in 1986) to the same disease.\n\nWith Harris, he has a son, actor Sean Brosnan, who was eight when his mother died.\n\nAs widely reported, Brosnan answered the New York Daily News’ question about how he survived these tragic losses by saying, “I would say faith, being Irish, being Catholic. It’s ingrained in my DNA.”\n\nIn 2001, Brosnan married “Entertainment Tonight” correspondent Keely Shaye Smith at Ballintubber Abbey Catholic Church in Ireland, the first marriage for her. But at the time, they had two children, one apparently born before their engagement and one born after.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Brosnan has discussed the role of faith in his life. He spent his early years in in Navan, County Meath, being raised by his mother, with the help of others, after his father’s departure when he was two. Then, at the age of 10 (or 12, depending on the source you read), he joined his mother in London.\n\nIn 2011, as reported by IrishCentral,com, he told RTE.ie, “God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer … I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers, or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them, but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith.”\n\nIn a FoxNews.com story in 2013, in response to a question about how he handled being a widower with three children to raise, he said, “Grace under pressure, faith, Catholic faith, work and work and more work.”\n\nAsked to elaborate, he said, “The Church has, I suppose, kept me in good stead through life. I was brought up a Catholic in Ireland; I was brought up in the Church. Faith has kept me going.”\n\nOn the other hand, in speaking about his mother to the the U.K. Telegraph in April, Brosnan said, “It was extremely courageous of her to get out of the mangled lifestyle of Catholicism and shaming and find a life for herself and myself. I wouldn’t have had my career if she’d stayed in Ireland and been persecuted for being a single mother in the ’50s, by the Church and the gossip of the town.”\n\nBut a few paragraphs later, he surprises the reporter by crediting his faith again in helping him deal with personal and professional challenges, saying, “I have a strong faith, being Catholic Irish, that has been maintained throughout my life. I enjoy the ritual of church, prayer. I’m not consistent in it, but it’s within me.\n\n“The dark times and the troubles, they’ll come regardless. You just hope you have the strength and the courage to address them and endure. You want to live as many lives as possible in one; you want to do as much as you can.”\n\nNow, there’s plenty an orthodox Catholic might wonder about in Brosnan’s story. Was his first marriage valid, since he married a two-time divorcee? How did he get married in the Church if he was cohabiting with Smith and already had children with her out of wedlock?\n\nThese are all legitimate questions from the perspective of Church doctrine and canon law, but it was ultimately between Brosnan and his priest or priests, and frankly, it’s none of our business. Ultimately, we have a man apparently still in the Faith and happy to talk positively about its influence in public, and, even more important, possibly raising his children in it.\n\nAs we approach the October Extraordinary Meeting of the Synod of Bishops on “Pastoral Challenges to the Family in the Context of Evangelization,” it’s worth noting — even for an orthodox revert like myself — that it’s better to have people in the Church than outside it, however imperfectly they practice the Faith.\n\nIt’s better to open doors to sinners than to slam them in their faces. And once a way has been found to bring someone back into the Church, bringing up past irregularities as if they were disqualifiers for future involvement in Catholic life is not only useless but damaging and deeply uncharitable.\n\nSo let’s pray for Brosnan and his family, that everything was or will be sorted out in the proper way, according to the spirit and letter of Church law, and that the children involved will be raised in the Truth and love of the Faith.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, let’s be grateful to have voices in the entertainment industry speaking out in the mass media in favor of Catholicism. There’s no telling what fertile ground the seed of that witness may fall upon.\n\nAnd if that voice once belonged to Bond, James, Bond, even better.\n\nPost by eaz35173 on\n\nwww.joblo.com/movie-news/the-good-the-bad-the-badass-pierce-brosnan-119\n\nThe Good, The Bad & The Badass: Pierce Brosnan\n\nAug. 25, 2014by: Chris Bumbray\n\nLast week, we took a look at the career of the late Robin Williams. This week's star is another legend, who just so happened to co-star as Williams' romantic adversary in one of his biggest hits, MRS. DOUBTFIRE...\n\nPierce Brosnan\n\nPierce Brosnan is a consistently underrated actor. Maybe it's due to the fact that his James Bond outings never quite worked (and have aged quite badly) or the fact that he's so damn good looking, but he's never gotten the respect he deserves as a classic leading man. Maybe it's that Brosnan always felt cut from the same cloth as someone like Cary Grant, with him excelling in light comedy on his TV show REMINGTON STEELE, and as a romantic lead. Sadly, when he was in his prime, those types of roles were in short supply. Between his stint on REMINGTON STEEL and his first Bond movie, Brosnan had to toil in a slew of dreadful movie-of-the-week style thrillers, with only the occasional bright spot like THE LAWNMOWER MAN or MRS. DOUBTFIRE keeping him going.\n\nIt's well-known that Brosnan was the first choice to take over for Roger Moore as Bond, before losing the lead in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to Timothy Dalton when NBC decided to bring back REMINGTON STEELE for a couple of episodes, as they wanted to trade on what they assumed would be his new found fame. This idea backfired in a big way, but luckily, Brosnan finally got to play 007 in 1995's GOLDENEYE, with each of his subsequent Bond's breaking new ground at the box-office, and turning him into a global megastar in the process.\n\nBut, there was a catch. In the 95-2002 period, the Bond films were struggling to keep up with modern action trends, and while Brosnan often spoke about wanting to take some risks with the character, he was often shoehorned into formulaic films, which ranged from entertaining (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) to absolutely atrocious (DIE ANOTHER DAY). Of his run as Bond, only GOLDENEYE stands the test of time, and it's a shame Brosnan never got the tough Bond vehicle he deserved. It's worth noting that his non-Bond 1999 vehicule, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, felt more classically Bondian than his real Bonds ever did.\n\nHowever, Brosnan is not one to rest on his laurels. Since the end of his Bond-run, Brosnan's reestablished himself as a character actor, turning in arguably his best performance ever in THE MATADOR, and some fine turns in movies like THE GREATEST, SALVATION BOULEVARD and more. This week, Brosnan returns to spydom again for THE NOVEMBER MAN. While I wasn't keen on the film itself (my review), Brosnan is as charismatic as ever, and it's always good to see him back on the big screen.\n\nHis Best Performance\n\nFor me, Brosnan's work in THE MATADOR was a revelation. I always knew he could act, but I had no idea he had a performance like this in him. As Julian, the over-the-hill hitman, Brosnan takes his suave 007-image and flushes it down the toilet, playing it in the most un-Bond-like fashion imaginable, and it works brilliantly. From the scene where he walks through a hotel lobby in a speedo and cowboy boots swilling whisky while 'The Jam” plays on the soundtrack, to his drunken meltdown opposite Greg Kinnear in a Mexico City-bar, Brosnan seems to relish the part. It's my all-time favorite performance of his, and I honestly think he was Oscar-worthy that year. I guess lines like “I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town,” or “margaritas always taste better in Mexico. Margaritas and cock,' didn't sit well with the academy. Screw 'em.\n\nHis Most Overrated Film\n\nA lot of Bond fans point to THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH as Brosnan's best Bond-outing. For awhile I agreed with them. In '99 it seemed like a relatively gritty 007 yarn, but the years have not been kind. For one thing, Robert Carlyle's Renard is one of the worst Bond-villains ever. For another, Brosnan's performance as Bond feels a little listless. And then there's Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, and the line “I thought Christmas only came once a year.” If it weren't for Sophie Marceau and the opening boat chase, I'd consider it unwatchable nowadays. It's still better than DIE ANOTHER DAY though.\n\nHis Most Underrated Film\n\nThere are two really underrated Pierce Brosnan vehicles. One is LIVE WIRE. Made in-between his REMINGTON STEELE and Bond-years, LIVE WIRE is one of the dozens of cable-thrillers Brosnan made to pay the bills, but of all of them, LIVE WIRE ain't half bad. It's stylishly directed by Christian Duguay, and Brosnan makes for a dynamic hero as a bomb squad cop who discovers a group of terrorists are carrying out political assassinations with a liquid explosive they hide in water, turning their targets into walking bombs. Is it a dumb premise? Yes, but it has some really cools scenes, such as the climax when Brosnan goes all MacGuyver on the bad guys (led by Ben Cross) and starts improvising deadly weapons with regular household appliances. It's a cool little movie.\n\nThe other is John Boorman's THE TAILOR OF PANAMA, based on the novel by John LeCarré. This was an early attempt by Brosnan to subvert his Bond-image by playing a sort of “dark Bond” where he has all of the same attributes, but none of the courage or morality. He plays a spy who blackmails a Panamanian tailor (played by Geoffrey Rush) into becoming his asset, and helping him scam his employers for more cash, while screwing anyone who gets in his way. His spy character is a misogynist, a racist, and an all-around bastard, and it was a pretty brave role for Brosnan to take at the height of his fame. Too bad hardly anyone saw it.\n\nHis Most Memorable Scene\n\nWhile I was tempted to throw in the lobby scene from THE MATADOR, I have to go with Brosnan's iconic introduction to the world of James Bond in GOLDENEYE. The opening, with the iconic bungee-jump, and smooth-bathroom introduction (“beg your pardon, forgot to knock”) is classic Bond. It's too bad the rest of his Bond vehicles couldn't live up to it.\n\nHis Top-Five Films\n\n5. TOMORROW NEVER DIES\n\n4. THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR\n\n3. THE TAILOR OF PANAMA\n\n2. GOLDENEYE\n\n1. THE MATADOR\n\nUp Next\n\nBrosnan's planning on turning THE NOVEMBER MAN into a franchise. Whether or not it actually happens remains to be seen, but even if it doesn't he's got a lot of movies in the pipeline. I expect Brosnan to churn out plenty of interesting films, but I must admit, I'd love to see him tackle Bond one last time, even if it seems unlikely.\n\nPost by eaz35173 on\n\nwww.examiner.com/article/pierce-brosnan-touched-by-artistry-of-talented-quadriplegic-painter-mariam-par\n\nPierce Brosnan touched by artistry of talented quadriplegic painter Mariam Paré\n\nOctober 22, 2014\n\n8:24 AM MST\n\nIt’s fascinating how two artists can create and share a bond when they’ve never even met, but the world of entertainment connects artists across the miles and brings together messages of hope shared between sender and receiver. For actor Pierce Brosnan, his portrayal of the Ian Fleming character, James Bond, on film was the message. For the receiver, Mariam Paré, an artist from Naperville, Illinois, Brosnan’s portrayal of legendary Agent 007 in “The Golden Eye” (1995), “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), “The World is Not Enough” (1999), and “Die Another Day” (2002) sent a message received loud and clear.\n\nWith Brosnan’s work as inspiration, so moved was Paré by his acting talents that she decided to paint his portrait as Bond, James Bond. Her work was both unique and miraculous in that Mariam painted the entire canvas with only a paint brush held in her mouth, rather than her hands. Paré was an innocent victim of gun violence, which rendered her a quadriplegic with limited use of her upper extremities.\n\nWhen he saw Paré’s work, Brosnan said, “This portrait of me, as James Bond, is incredible. This is just exemplary artwork.” The exquisite detail in Brosnan’s face, with difficult facial shading, highlights in his trademark styled \"007\" hair, and his classic pose with his gun, is so perfectly achieved that it’s hard to believe that she taught herself to draw, first with a pen in her mouth, later with a paint brush.\n\nAs the accompanying video explains, Paré was unaware at first of a tremendous organization known as the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists, (MFPA), an organization founded in 1956 as an international for-profit association, run by and for the benefit of “disabled artists to help them meet their financial needs.” Paré said, “I was delighted to learn there was an organization of these professional artists.” The MFPA products available for sale to the public include reproductions of their original paintings as greeting cards, calendars, gift wrap and books.\n\nWhen Pierce saw a photo of Paré’s work, he invited her to his home in Malibu to discuss art, and the various inspirations for some of their works as he and this tremendously talented artist shared an afternoon. Mariam brought him two paintings, the “Bond” and then another lovely portrait of Pierce in a casual pose. Although it’s well known that Brosnan has had a tremendous career as an actor for over 30 years now, it’s less known how important art has been to him, virtually all his life. Pierce began his first career, after high school, as a commercial illustrator. On his web site, he explains, “I always wanted to be an artist, a painter.”\n\nIt’s not just that Pierce appreciated the thoughtful gifts and talents. Rather he felt such great connection to Paré, as he also had experienced not one but two substantive losses in his lifetime, the first being the loss of his first wife, actress Cassandra Harris, to ovarian cancer. As she was battling the disease, Pierce turned to art to work through the difficult days, and although he’s self-taught as a painter, he cites the works of Picasso, Matisse and Kandinsky as his inspiration.\n\nSadly, Cassandra died in 1991 at the age of 43. Brosnan had adopted Cassandra’s two children, Charlotte and Christopher, upon the death of their father, plus Cassandra and Pierce had a third child, son Sean, and the five had been a loving family all fighting ovarian cancer together.\n\nIn 2001, Pierce married Keely Shaye Smith, and the couple now has two more children, son, Dylan and daughter, Paris. He continued his painting, ultimately creating the Brosnan Trust, which maintains the income from sales of his Gicleé prints and distributes funds “to environmental, children’s and women’s health charities.”\n\nWhen Pierce visited with Mariam Paré, they talked about art, and how it had helped both of them through some of the darkest days of their lives. Pierce shared openly and frankly, as he spoke of how painting helped him find light among the darkness. Most recently, Brosnan lost Charlotte, Cassandra’s daughter, who also died of ovarian cancer in June 2013, the same disease that had claimed her mother and her grandmother as well.\n\nReflect for a moment, and think of how fast your life would change if you suddenly lost the use of your hands due to tragedy or later-life, unexpected medical conditions. What would your attitude be? What would your spirit guide you to do? Could you see yourself seeking to find a way to express your talents any way you could? There are many days we take the gifts of life and time shared with others for granted. We assume we will always have the use of our arms, hands, legs and feet.\n\nAnd yet, in the blink of an eye, life could change for each of us. Yet these two talented artists, Brosnan and Paré, have chosen to continue to share their talents with all of us. Brosnan continues to create film and painting art, and Paré was inspired by his talent and gave back in appreciation for his work. No more cherished gift by one artist, to another artist, could be imagined.\n\nWhen you support the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists through purchases of their products from their official web site (www.mfpausa.com), you’re also offering encouragement, support, and respect to these talented artists who have broken through every physical barrier imaginable to create a work of beauty. Viewing the beautiful art and making it a part of your collection is the best appreciation you can show for the labors of love they produce.\n\nPierce Brosnan’s visible support and affirmation of the work of fellow artist Mariam Paré is a very special sharing of his popularity to increase awareness for MFPA as an important cause most greatly deserving of support. For more on Paré’s artwork, please visit her official web site.\n\nAs you find yourself considering end-of-year and holiday gifts in the weeks ahead, please consider this most outstanding organization that provides rewarding careers for the talents of individuals who refuse to give in to sorrow, incapacity, or misfortune as they continue to create beauty, which can be shared throughout the world.\n\nPost by eaz35173 on\n\nFrom a blog called The Suits of James Bond ... thesuitsofjamesbond.com/?p=5268 (for some reason, the pictures would not post with this article - click on the link to see the suits they are referring to)\n\nClassic Style and the Suit’s Ideal Proportions\n\nPosted on 3 November 2014\n\nWhat is the standard to which we compare all suits? What makes lapels narrow or wide, a jacket long or short, or a button stance low or high? Style theorists—and I use this term loosely—talk about timeless suits that we should only be wearing, but what makes a suit timeless? Does this timeless suit even exist? Every decade of the past one hundred years has had its mark on the suit, though people will often cite the 1940s as the golden age of the suit. But most suits from the 1940s would now look outdated. James Bond was not yet around in the 1940s, so it’s not really a decade relevant to this blog.\n\nThroughout every decade there have been tailors and clothing shops that did their best make and sell clothes that are ignorant of trends. From the 1980s to the end of the last decade, the American institution Brooks Brothers hardly took fashion trends into consideration. English shops like Pakeman, Catto & Carter and Purdey haven’t bowed to current fashion trends. But even many Savile Row bespoke tailors have considered and still consider fashion trends. They made narrower lapels in the 1960s and wider lapels in the 1970s, but never went to the extremes of fashion houses. Now, many of them are making trousers with a lower rise than they ever did before, and the drape cut is practically gone. The former Conduit Street tailors like Sean Connery’s Anthony Sinclair and Roger Moore’s Cyril Castle certainly kept up with fashion trends—especially the latter—but they kept classic proportions in the back of their minds and did not let fashion make their suits unflattering to the wearers.\n\nA suit with balanced, classic proportions is generally the most flattering suit, since it considers the wearer’s body first and foremost. Pierce Brosnan’s suits in The World Is Not Enough excellently illustrate the principles of a timeless suit with balanced proportions, and I will be using the suits from that film to illustrate what makes the suits look so timeless. This timeless look is what I compare all other suits to. The suits in Die Another Day and Casino Royale have similarly timeless proportions, and the suits in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Octopussy and A View to a Kill come close.\n\nPierce Brosnan’s suits in The World Is Not Enough are all classically cut and styled in the Roman cut, which is derived from the English military cut. The charcoal suit in Bilbao and the pick-and-pick suit in Azerbaijan are the most basic of all the suits in the film, and thus they are the best to demonstrate what makes a classic suit. The suit jackets are made in the most classic of all jacket styles, the button three. They are cut for the lapel to gently roll over the top button, but they can still button at the top. The jackets have double vents at a medium length of around 10 inches. Double vents, single vents and no vents are all classic styles, though single vent is the sportiest style and no vent is the dressiest style. A vent length of 8 to 10 inches is the most classic since it is long enough to be useful but not too long as to cause unnecessary flapping about. The exception to vent length is for a longer 12-inch single vent on a hacking jacket since it splits open better on horseback. Besides the double vents, Pierce Brosnan’s charcoal and pick-and-pick suit jacket also have straight pockets with flaps and four buttons on the cuffs, which are the standards for suit jackets.\n\nWhat is the classic length of a jacket that we compare all other lengths to? The jacket length is ideally one half the distance from the base of the neck to the floor. For people with a longer torso than their legs, the jacket length should be long enough to cover the bum. For most people, the bottom of the jacket lines up with the thumb knuckle. This length keeps the body looking balanced and neither top-heavy nor bottom-heavy. A longer jacket can make a man look shorter, whilst a shorter jacket can give the man leggier, more feminine proportions.\n\nThe part of the jacket that changes most with fashion is the width of the lapels. Ideally, the lapel width should be roughly half the distance from the collar to the edge of the shoulder, which ordinarily ends up being between 3 and 3 1/2 inches. This lapel width splits up the chest evenly. Though wide lapels have the effect of making the shoulders look wider, they can make the chest look smaller. Narrow lapels do the opposite. Extremes of either lapel width throw off the balance of the body. Pocket flap depth ordinarily follows lapel width and is around three quarters of the width of the lapel. The best lapel gorge height—where the notch is—is just as important to balance as the width of the lapels. A gorge that is too low shortens the lapel lines and brings the eye away from the face, but it has the benefit of giving the chest more presence. On the other hand, a gorge that is too high makes the chest look weak, so the right placement is key.\n\nThe button stance has a big effect on the look of a jacket and a man’s perceived height and strength. The button stance is at the button that fastens, which is the middle button on a jacket with three buttons and the top button on a jacket with two buttons. A button stance that is too high makes a man look taller by extending the perceived leg length at the expense of a smaller-looking chest. A low button stance does the opposite. Pierce Brosnan’s button stance in The World Is Not Enough has the perfect balance and is about an inch lower than midway from the top of the jacket to its hem. The button stance should also correspond to the natural waist, which is typically about an inch above the navel. The body bends at the waist and placing the button stance there helps the jacket move better with the body.\n\nA jacket’s shoulder width and amount of padding should be balanced to the person and not be too wide or narrow, or too built-up. But this is one thing that can vary within the realm of classic style. Pierce Brosnan’s shoulders on his Brioni suits in The World Is Not Enough are straight, built up with a lot of padding and slightly extended past his natural shoulders. But the shoulders are not overdone and actually balance his build. Something less dramatic could work just as well and look equally classic. The fullness of the chest and amount of waist suppression have the most allowance to vary within classic style, as long as they aren’t so tight that they put stress on the jacket or so loose that the jacket looks sloppy. Brosnan’s suit jackets in The World Is Not Enough have a clean chest with a gently suppressed waist.\n\nJust as the amount of fullness or tightness in the body of the jacket can vary within the realm of classic proportions, the amount of fullness and tightness in the trouser legs can vary too. Naturally, the fullness of the trouser legs should be in proportion of the fullness of the jacket. A jacket with a full chest needs to be balanced by trousers with a full thigh. If the jacket tapers a lot at the waist, the trousers shouldn’t be baggy. Just like a jacket should not be so tight that is pulls, the same goes for trousers. Other than that, anything goes for the width of trouser legs. Pierce Brosnan’s suit trousers in The World Is Not Enough fit neatly through the thigh and taper gently to the turned-up hem, which mimics the clean but not dramatic cut of the jacket. The front of the classic suit trousers can have pleats or darts (like most of Pierce Brosnan’s suit trousers in The World Is Not Enough), or be plain.\n\nThere is, however, a proportionate standard for the trouser rise. Like the jacket’s button stance, the trouser rise needs to work with the shape and movement of the body. There is a reason why classic suit trousers rise to the natural waist, like Pierce Brosnan’s suit trousers do. The waist is the narrowest part of the body and should be emphasised. Placing the trouser waist there does just that. The trousers have nowhere to fall down when they are at the narrowest part of the body. And by wearing trousers at the waist instead of at the hips, the legs look longer. The trouser rise should also correspond to the jacket’s button stance so that the shirt and tie don’t show below that jacket’s fastened button. It makes the suit look more fluid and the whole body look taller and slimmer.\n\nThere is still plenty of room for creativity in a suit with balanced proportions. Just because a suit follows this classic formula doesn’t mean it has to be boring. The silhouette, the most defining aspect of a suit’s design, can vary considerably and still be balanced. Though Pierce Brosnan’s suits in The World Is Not Enough have straight, padded shoulders, the shoulders are just as proportionate and as classic as the natural shoulders on Roger Moore’s Douglas Hayward suits. Smaller stylistic details can also make a big difference. Sleeveheads can be roped or flat. The shape of the gorge can curve in different ways or not curve at all. The amount of belly in the lapels can vary. The quarters and pocket flaps can be more rounded or more squared for much different looks.\n\nThough fashion notoriously messes with the suit’s classic proportions, tailors may also alter these proportions to better suit people with extreme body types. For instance, a very tall man may benefit from a lower gorge (lapel notch) so he looks more grounded, and a short man can benefit from a higher gorge that lengthens the lapel lines. A man with a large head can benefit from extended shoulders so his head looks more balanced with the rest of his body. A short man can benefit from a shorter jacket length that will make his legs look longer. But any of these taken to the extreme like fashion has often done over the years is ultimately not flattering.\n\nClassic proportions aren’t just about the suit. We all know that the width of one’s tie should match the width of a jacket’s lapels. However, the shirt collar also needs to be in proportion with the lapel and tie width. The shirt collar point length can match the width of the lapels, though in practice the collar points are typically a little shorter than lapel width. It is more important that the collar match the shape and size of one’s head rather than the jacket’s lapels. Pierce Brosnan’s collar has roughly 2 3/4 inch points, but his lapels are around 3 1/2 inches wide. The size of the cuffs should correspond to the size of the collar. Brosnan’s cuffs are around the same 2 3/4 inches deep as his collar points.\n\nIt’s not just the point length of a shirt collar that can match the jacket’s lapels. The angle of a shirt collar’s spread should roughly correspond to the jacket’s gorge height and angle. A narrower point collar points to a lower notch whilst a wider spread collar points to a higher notch. Pierce Brosnan’s moderately wide spread collars in The World Is Not Enough roughly follow the angle of the lapel gorge and end at around the same height of the lapel notches. But more important than matching the gorge angle, the collar spread should inversely match the width of the face. Pierce Brosnan’s face, however, is neither wide nor narrow, so he can look good in almost any collar. The height of a collar is determined by the length of one’s neck and has no relation to the proportions of other parts of the outfit.\n\nWhen some of the suit jacket’s proportions are tailored to best suit the person wearing the suit, and the suit, shirt and tie are well-designed to be in proportion with each other like Pierce Brosnan’s are in The World Is Not Enough, the entire of the outfit will be classically proportioned and most flattering. The clothes in The World Is Not Enough escape the clutches of fashion trends and look just as great today as they did fifteen years ago.\n\nFor more about the classic proportions of a suit, read Alan Flusser’s book Dressing the Man.\n\n================\n\nI think I may have posted from this blog before, but I couldn't find it.
