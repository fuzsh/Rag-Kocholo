        "text": "The first sign of trouble in the romantic comedy “Love Is All You Need” is the clichéd and incessant use of “That’s Amore.” Ever since that early-’50s Dean Martin hit was used in “Moonstruck” in 1987, the song has been pop culture’s Pavlovian signal to wallow in the jollier side of all things Italian. Much of this movie, about a wedding that goes awry, is set in Sorrento, overlooking the Bay of Naples. But as the story progresses the tune’s insistent levity is contradicted by the awful behavior of some pigheaded characters.\n\nFor the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier (“Brothers,” “Things We Lost in the Fire,” “In a Better World”), “Love Is All You Need” is a conspicuously strained detour into froth and fun. The southern Italian scenery is picture-perfect: The camera lingers on sunsets, full moons and misty coves, and you can almost smell the fragrance from a citrus grove outside the palatial home where the wedding is to take place.\n\nBut something is rotten in Denmark, where the movie begins. Despite the gorgeous sights and rollicking sounds of sunny Italy, a Scandinavian heaviness hangs over the film, with a screenplay by Ms. Bier’s frequent collaborator Anders Thomas Jensen, based on a story they developed. Occasionally it feels as if the buoyancy signaled by “That’s Amore” and the luscious cinematography were applied like whitewash to disguise a dour family drama.\n\nIn the opening scene Ida (Trine Dyrholm), a middle-aged hairdresser being treated for breast cancer, arrives home from a hospital appointment to find her husband, Leif (Kim Bodnia), having sex with his pretty, blond accountant. Far from cowering in guilt and begging forgiveness, this insensitive, self-pitying lout excuses his behavior by whining that Ida’s illness hasn’t been easy for him, either.\n\nIda and Leif’s daughter, Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind), is about to marry Patrick (Sebastian Jessen), whom she has known for only three months. The wedding is planned for the Italian estate of Patrick’s father, Philip (Pierce Brosnan), a wealthy British importer of fruits and vegetables who is still grieving over the death of his wife years earlier in a senseless accident. Patrick resents his father for his emotional absence, and his relationship with Astrid is already disintegrating from his own lack of passion.\n\nAt an airport on the way to the wedding, Philip and Ida meet-cute in an underground parking garage where she accidentally rams into his vehicle. They realize in the middle of the incident that they are heading to the same event. By the time they arrive their relations are cordial, and things get warmer from there.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
