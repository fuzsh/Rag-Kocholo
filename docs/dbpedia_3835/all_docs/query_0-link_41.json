        "text": "Share this Article:\n\n1992’s The Lawnmower Man and 1995’s Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace are making their UK Blu-ray debuts.\n\nHere’s an intriguing pair of 1990s features, that are being bundled together for their first ever appearance on Blu-ray in the UK. 1992’s The Lawnmower Man and its sequel, 1995’s Lawnmower Man: Beyond Cyberspace are both arriving in a new double pack.\n\nThe 1992 original in particular was really rather groundbreaking. Notwithstanding the fact that it was the film Stephen King went to court to get his name taken off (when he realised how little the resultant movie had to do with the book it was supposedly based on), The Lawnmower Man was also the first big screen virtual reality movie. Not in an interactive sense, more in a strange shapes getting fruity with each other sense. It was quite a big screen experience too.\n\nBrett Leonard directed, with Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey starring. Fahey would return for the second film, which was directed by Farhad Man. Lawnmower Man: Beyond Cyberspace gets no extra features in the new set.\n\nOn the flip side, The Lawnmower Man gets loads, taking up two of the three discs in the collection. From commentaries and deleted scenes to behind the scenes concept art and a feature on making the movie, it’s a comprehensive-looking collection of material we’re getting here.\n\nThe double pack goes on sale in the UK from 10th June 2024, and you can find more information on it – and order a copy – right here.\n\nWe’ll leave you with the synopses for the movies, and a trailer for The Lawnmower Man. Hands up who else went to see this in the cinema when it came out?\n\nThe Lawnmower Man: Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant scientist obsessed with perfecting virtual reality software. When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute – Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener. Dr. Angelo’s goal is to benefit his human guinea pig and ultimately mankind itself, but evil lurks in the guise of “The Shop”, a shadow group that seeks to use the technology to create an invincible war machine. When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for control of Jobe’s mind and the future of the world.\n\nLawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace: Enter the deadly world of virtual reality, where information is the key to world domination. Picking up where the original Lawnmower Man ended, Jobe (Matt Frewer – Max Headroom) has become a hostage in futuristic hell. But when he discovers a computer chip that will give him the key to the ultimate revenge, the battle for world control begins. With stunning special effects, Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace takes you into a world where only the hardwired dare to journey."
