        "text": "With so many detective stories littering media of all types, it takes a fresh spin to break through the noise and legacy of the concept. And though older people solving murders is hardly the newest idea (Miss Marple, among many others would like a word if you believe otherwise), TV host/author Richard Osman has certainly found one that works with his The Thursday Night Murder Club book series. Having sold the rights to Steven Spielberg back in 2020 when the first book hit big, the film version is now trundling out of the development phase with Pierce Brosnan, Helen Mirren and Sir Benjamin of the mighty land of Kingsley aboard to star.\n\nThe books feature the four members of the titular society, who decide to fill their otherwise tranquil lives in a peaceful retirement village with a little more fun, meeting weekly to discuss unsolved crimes.\n\nTheir otherwise harmless hobby takes on a whole new dimension when a local property developer is discovered murderlised with a mysterious photo next to the body, and the Club finds themselves trading cold cases for a very hot one. But as the bodies start to pile up, can they catch the killer before it's too late?\n\nMirren will play ex-spy Elizabeth, Kingsley is on to be retired psychiatrist Ibrahim and Brosnan has the role of former union activist Ron. While Jeff Sneider broke the first word of the casting in his newsletter, Osman confirmed the names on this week's Tuesday edition of podcast The Rest Is Entertainment. He also mentioned that there is an offer out to another big name actor for the role of the fourth member, Joyce, but that that deal has yet to close.\n\nAnd just who is aboard to write and direct a film based on a popular British novel series (four so far, another on the way) that is hoping to spawn a giant franchise? Oh, and who has worked with Steven Spielberg before? Uwe Boll, put your hand down, because it's Chris Columbus, of course!"
