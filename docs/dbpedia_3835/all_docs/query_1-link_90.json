        "text": "I love reading this website. It feels like our own private li‚Äôl ‚ÄúMidnight Society‚Äù. But instead of sharing tall tales about Neve Campbell battling evil soup, we gather for REAL tales of cursed cultural artifacts. Today, for your approval, I present Live Wire ‚Äì a movie about Pierce Brosnan battling evil glasses of water. Water is bombs, in this movie, runtime 85 minutes.\n\nThis is cursed beyond its ‚Äúsilly movie‚Äù layer. There is actual, accursed, built-on-a-burial-ground style grimness within this flick. But we gotta start with the bomb-water. This movie depends on you getting interested in the following premise: Euro-terrorists devised a chemical. When the chemical gets added to water, and then mixed with the stomach acids of a person who drank the water, that person will combust. Humongously. Plus there‚Äôs a middle step before the explosion, where their eyes turn red and they start wiggling around. That‚Äôs the hook of this movie: a technology where one sip of evil water turns anyone into several tons of dynamite.\n\nI acknowledge that this premise almost works. Conceptually, it‚Äôs scary that anybody could blow anybody else up with innocent-looking water. But this almost-good idea gains a lot of hilarity in its path from the page to the screen. The screenwriter types ‚Äúterrorist!‚Äù The resulting movie points its quick cuts and ominous music in the general direction of‚Ä¶a limo driver re-loading drinks.\n\nOr a judge who is thirsty.\n\nOr a clown, with ‚Äúlemonade.‚Äù\n\nGoldenEye it ain‚Äôt. And I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúPierce Brosnan must have made this crummy movie one million billion years before he was famous.‚Äù That is what you are thinking, right now. I am a psychic. It‚Äôs freaky! Anyway, Live Wire was intended as a huge movie. It came out in 1992, and it was supposed to be Pierce Brosnan‚Äôs Die Hard. You can tell because it copy-pastes a lot of Die Hard. Brosnan plays a tormented Police Guy slash (Estranged) Wife Guy, forced to defeat a Euro-terrorist plot masterminded by a good actor from British dramas. Armed only with his wits, a few guns, and his Black Friend, Pierce McClane re-Wifes his life by impressing her by saving the world.\n\nLive Wire also makes a few key additions to this format:\n\nüå≠ Bomb Water (as discussed).\n\nüå≠ Brosnan‚Äôs Police Guy is a Police Bomb Defuser, specifically. (So look out, Bomb Water!)\n\nüå≠ Black Friend has his own Robot Best Friend. (Whatever robot you‚Äôre imagining, think cheaper.)\n\nüå≠ Ron Silver.\n\nHey, wow: that haircut! Ron Silver plays a United States Senator, with that haircut. That is the most fantastical element of this film ‚Äì a film where James Bond and a robot hunt terrorists doing spontaneous human combustions. That coiffure is still the most bonkers element. Live Wire claims Ron Silver could get elected to Congress while sporting the exact hairdo of Lord Farquaad (from Shrek) and Dianne Feinstein (from the United States Senate).\n\nBut enough about fictional universe-based Senators. I‚Äôm only here because of Pierce Brosnan. I‚Äôm a fan! He‚Äôs my James Bond and I don‚Äôt care who knows it. He‚Äôs the whole reason I‚Äôve watched The King‚Äôs Daughter for your benefit. Pierce‚Äôs life is the doorway to the most cursed, bizarre rabbit hole hidden within Live Wire. But the business side of this movie is cursed too. It failed! Singularly! Live Wire was a wide-release summer tentpole, back when those were things. It was such a non-hit, Pierce Brosnan‚Äôs Wikipedia page describes a different 1992 Pierce Brosnan movie (The Lawnmower Man) AND a 1992 Pierce Brosnan not-picked-up television pilot, with no mention of this multi-million dollar blockbuster released that same year. And he was famous at the time! One year later, Brosnan villain-starred in Mrs. Doubtfire. One year after that, he got announced as the new James Bond. Which thrills me! That means thousands of people heard the James Bond casting news, and muttered ‚ÄúThat guy from Die Wire?‚Äù, after spit-taking their 1994 Beverage (Fruitopia).\n\nLet‚Äôs begin the movie. As you know, it‚Äôs an action/sci-fi film. Those usually begin with thrills. Live Wire, due to Premise Problems, begins with ominous b-roll of water ‚Äì and then red water.\n\nNext they present the movie‚Äôs title. Which is also wet. Wet and steamy.\n\nAfter that Schlitterbahn of a credit sequence, the movie proceeds to show you dry text. Which I‚Äôve screencapped. Warning: this block of text I‚Äôm about to show you will feel gross and out-of-nowhere. It feels that same way in the film.\n\nReminder: this movie came out in 1992. Question: can a thrown-together Die Hard ripoff cause a real-life terrorist attack, by doing a humongous jinx? Because the World Trade Center got bombed within months of this movie‚Äôs release. And then attacked again, later, in a way I do not need to hyperlink. Remember when I said this movie is legitimately, nightmarishly cursed? Well oh no, oh god, there are more blocks of text.\n\nWhat a pile of words. Words that accurately capture America‚Äôs political stability and lack of sad bombings. Anyway the film knows it‚Äôs making you read. It‚Äôs losing precious seconds to reel you in. So its next moment is soundtracked with a badass guitar sting. However, this is not the main thing you notice. Because as your ears begin to ü§òrockü§ò, your eyes are looking at a duck.\n\nA duck! Fun! I know this shot is also a shot of the U.S. Capitol Building, reflected in water (i.e. The Bad Guy). That‚Äôs probably what they storyboarded. But you do not notice what they storyboarded. You notice a big funny white duck dominating the first shot of the whole movie, with the exact musical backing of a WWE entrance.\n\nThey probably needed a duck-free shot of this. They definitely didn‚Äôt bother spending time and money getting one. This whole movie feels thrown together in that way. With each passing minute, there‚Äôs a new jarring li‚Äôl whoopsie. Such as this phone call, between two people in the same city. One end is a sunny day and the other end is a rainy night.\n\nThere‚Äôs also this thrilling employee management situation, where the Euro-villain kills off his Science Henchman by neck-stabbing him with a pen.\n\nThis scene is written so the villain isn‚Äôt carrying a pen. Because that would be impossible? So before the murder, he asks Sci-Henchman to lend him a pen.\n\nSo if Doctor Science wasn‚Äôt carrying a pen, the villain‚Ä¶just strangles him? Or if Sci-Doc is carrying a crummy Bic, the villain‚Ä¶inks him to death? I know that‚Äôs not an important problem. Neither is the duck. Neither is another part of this movie, where Pierce and Black Friend go to a high-security carnival, and the carnival staff put Black Friend‚Äôs Robot through a metal detector.\n\nThis movie DOES NOT HAVE TIME for thinking through that stuff. This is ACTION filmmaking, focused on how HARDCORE the main character is. Pierce Brosnan‚Äôs Character is so hardcore, he attends carnivals to do two things: interrogate clowns, and whack clowns‚Äô noses off when they aren‚Äôt quick enough to answer the question ‚Äúhave you seen any suspicious water?‚Äù\n\nThis HARDCORENESS gets-a-rippin‚Äô from Pierce‚Äôs first scene. When we meet him, he‚Äôs in the middle of defusing a car bomb and ogling a vagina.\n\nDoes Pierce defeat this (non-water) bomb? He does. He defeats it so hard, he can barely keep his shirt on.\n\nBut wait ‚Äì what‚Äôs that item electrical-taped to Pierce‚Äôs ribcage?\n\nAn item he tape-rips off of his ribcage? (hardcore!) It‚Äôs a set of photos of Pierce and His Wife and His Child (family!).\n\nPierce sarcastically (hardcore!) lets us know the pictures are his lucky charm (family!) for defusing bombs (hardcore!). One millisecond later, a flip-up sunglasses man enters this active crime scene to serve Pierce a restraining order from His Wife (famcore!).\n\nPierce spends the rest of the movie battling sinister bombs while battling to get His Wife back. That is his central pair of dramas. Those two threads intersect because Pierce has to solve both problems. Those threads also intersect at His Wife‚Äôs vagina. For you see, the Euro-terrorists are targeting United States Senators. Pierce‚Äôs Wife has moved on to a new relationship with United States Haircut-Senator Ron Silver. In the end, Pierce wins His Wife back, nominally by solving the terrorism. It‚Äôs not convincing, in the movie. But it makes more sense than his other strategy for getting her back, which is to show up wherever she is and do Actually Scary Yelling at her.\n\nThe movie excuses this yelling by making Pierce a Justifiably Sad Man. He is sad about their daughter‚Äôs death. Still, Pierce spends basically the entire movie being sad about losing His Wife ‚Äì except for each time a person is mid-explosion, and one scene where he Recaptures His Wife‚Äôs Vagina. He does this in a candlelit bathtub. She loves this. She also keeps wearing an entire terry cloth bathrobe throughout this tub-lovin‚Äô, because there is no hotter pork-sperience than feeling like you‚Äôre inside a swim meet‚Äôs hamper.\n\nThis element of the movie is its most accursed element‚Ä¶if you know real life stuff about My Hero, Pierce Brosnan. This is about to get more cursed than you think it will. CURSE WARNING begins now. Because in real life, Pierce Brosnan lost his wife Cassandra Harris to a long battle with cancer. She died in 1991. Here is her photo:\n\nThe movie Live Wire came out in 1992. Pierce plays a guy pining for His Wife, who is played by this actor:\n\nAre you noticing what I am noticing about this movie that was filmed in 1991? I am confident somebody noticed. The production of this movie involved a meeting where Pierce had to say ‚Äúhey by the way, you‚Äôre making me re-experience my raw grief.‚Äù And a higher-up replied ‚Äúwe blew our emergency-switch-actresses budget on the robot.‚Äù I hate it. I hate it so much I‚Äôm a little bit obsessed with it. It‚Äôs so tragic it‚Äôs thrilling. Pierce bursts into disjointed yelling in every scene with that gal, and I watched this movie knowing why.\n\nAnyway, bomb stuff. The Euro-terrorists are assassinating Senators with water-combustion bombs, because some Senators blocked a $10 million dollar arms deal. (In 1992, $10 million could hire two good baseball players for one season.) Pierce figures this plot out quickly, yet too slowly. Then he and Ron Silver do a Die Hard in Ron Silver‚Äôs big house. Pierce‚Äôs Now-Loved-Up Wife is also there. Pierce gets shot in the chest with a gun, and he keeps acting normal for several minutes until the battle‚Äôs over. The end of the battle is Euro-villain consuming his own chemical, to blow up the heroes with his own body. He does this because Euro-villain is too suicidally angry to run away, regroup, and slip Pierce a future Bomb Evian.\n\nPierce chucks the bomb-villain out of the house, and they all leap a safe distance away‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶except for Ron Silver, who gets impaled (Pierce-d?????) by his own spiky rich-guy fence, as justice for his numerous crimes (corruption, fashion, Wife-Thefting).\n\nThe movie doesn‚Äôt quite know how to end itself from there. So they have Pierce solve another car bomb, while ogling the same lady‚Äôs same vagina from the beginning. Also in the middle of this bomb defusal situation, which takes a total of fifteen seconds, he receives a phone call telling him His Wife had Their Baby. Thrilled he‚Äôs finally solved his child‚Äôs death by making a replacement, Pierce joyously sprints away, probably to go to the hospital. This is the final shot of the movie (timecode: 1:21:05). And it‚Äôs filmed with the wobbliest Rising Helicopter Shot I‚Äôve ever experienced."
