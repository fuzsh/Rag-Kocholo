The Lawnmower Man is the latest movie getting remade as a TV series and, fittingly, it's going to be in VR too.

Cinematic virtual reality company Jaunt Inc has announced that it is working on a new scripted multi-episode VR series based upon the 1992 cult thriller, which starred Pierce Brosnan and Lost's Jeff Fahey.

"The original movie was a film of unsurpassed imagination and creativity with its ground-breaking use of VR back in 1992," commented rights holder Jim Howell.

"Together with Jaunt we look forward to a contemporary team bringing to life a whole new world of VR; a world of immersive entertainment and communication."

In case you've never seen it, The Lawnmower Man centred on ambitious scientist Dr Angelo (Brosnan) who is attempting to turn chimpanzees into super-soldiers (yes, really), using VR technology and drugs.

One of the chimps decides it has had enough and escapes, finding a mentally-disabled man called Jobe (Fahey) and, in turn, giving Dr Angelo a whole new test subject.

The Lawnmower Man follows in the footsteps of the likes of 12 Monkeys, The Exorcist and Snatch to be making the journey from the big screen to the small screen.

It is also one of five new VR series that Jaunt is developing to go into production this year.

Among the other projects is sci-fi suspense series Luna from The Divergent Series: Insurgent and Allegiant director Robert Schwentke, and political sci-fi series The Enlightened Ones, which will be produced by X-Men: Apocalypse's Tye Sheridan.
