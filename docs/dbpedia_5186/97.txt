Relocating to Maseru

About the City

Maseru is the capital city of the land-locked African Kingdom of Lesotho, an enclave of South Africa. The city is situated about 1600m above sea level, in clear mountain air, making it a paradise for outdoor enthusiastsÂ â a definite lure to move to Maseru.

The whole country of Lesotho encompasses 30,355 square kilometers (11,720 square miles), and the city and its peri-urban villages sprawl across 138 square kilometers (53 square miles), with a relatively small, sleepy center. The latest available census (2006) shows 227,880 people live in Maseru, which is about a tenth of the countryâs population.

Maseru is far from being an African economic powerhouse. It has an international airport (Moshoeshoe) and relies heavily on tourism, especially from neighboring South Africa. The city has several international standard hotels, branches of South African retail chains and banks, along with restaurants serving good food. There are some flourishing industrial enterprises such as flour mills, textile and footwear companies. These, and diplomatic posts from abroad, all provide jobs for expatriates who relocate to Maseru.
