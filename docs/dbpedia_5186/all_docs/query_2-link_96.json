        "text": "Lesotho appears to be a tiny country when you look at it on a map, but let me tell you, those mountains will make the country feel HUGE! Very few stretches of straight roads make travel distances and times between places take far longer than “as the crow flies.” For this reason, Lesotho has a bit of a divide between the north and the south. Mokhotlong and Qacha’s Nek nearly border each other with only a sliver of Thaba Tseka between them on the eastern side of the country, but the road between these two districts is, by far, a glorified donkey path. It amazes me that there are taxis that occasionally travel on it, though expect an awfully uncomfortable and bumpy ride. Because of this, PCVs are also fairly divided. A lot of conferences are even divided by the north and the south, so it was rare for Mary and I to see each other since I was living in a northern district and she was in a southern. I did manage to make it down to Quthing three times and she made it up to Mokhotlong once, but in a 2 year time span, that’s not too much! ha. It was pretty cool to get to truly explore each other’s sites and camptowns since neither of us had spent much time in each others’ districts.\n\nWhat better way to commemorate our trip to Lesotho than making a stop at a Seshoeshoe fabric store and pick out some fun designs for ourselves. I still have no idea what I am going to do with the seshoeshoe I bought, but the lady was really trying to convince me I needed to get more fabric and make a jumpsuit!! haha.\n\nSome views from the drive to the south, or as Mary would call it the “dirty Q,” referring to the 2 districts of Quthing and Qacha’s Nek.\n\nDuring our entire trip, the sky was always so gorgeous with the back drop of the mountains. I was a crazy camera sidekick in the passenger seat always snapping photos. I cannot even begin to explain the amount of time I spent just to pick out which photos to include on here so as to not upload all 1700+ pictures!!\n\nWe decided we would stay in town since Mary’s site was just around a 10km trip out of town on a fairly decent gravel road. When there is heavy rainfall, traveling in and out of her site would become difficult since there are several times the road crosses a stream or small river. There was a couple new improvements to her road including rain gutters being dug and stoned/cemented as well as one of the streams now had a cement block that the water could still run over, but would be far easier to pass than over loose rocks and mud in high water.\n\nI think if I wasn’t placed in Mokhotlong, Quthing would have been my next choice. Mary’s site is absolutely gorgeous! We had somehow timed it out perfectly to be at her site for her school’s grade 7 farewell party. Most of the students graduating would have been her students in grade 4 and 5. It was a lot fun to see some of the traditional dancing and general celebration styles of Basotho again.\n\nSome beautiful people from her site:\n\nMore gorgeous mountain photos:\n\nAfter a fun filled day in Quthing, we were headed to Qacha’s Nek. Much like the drive from Butha-Buthe to Mokhotlong, the drive from Quthing to Qacha’s involves mountain passes and winding mountain roads. We had a bit of a later start to the drive than we had intended, but it actually worked out because we ended up some really gorgeous sunset views!\n\nWhen we arrived in Qacha’s Nek, we managed to get ourselves a room in probably one of the NICEST hotels in all of Lesotho. How it wound up in Qacha’s Nek of all places, who knows! The next morning we really struggled to leave the comfy bed that we were both blanket burritos in. It was rainy and brisk in QN, so my Malawian wardrobe was barely making the cut for me!\n\nJust on the edge of QN town:\n\nTown was super foggy so we could only hope that the weather would change during our 3 hour drive out to Sehlabathebe National Park. I had gone out to the park once before and had been cursed with bad luck with fog then as well, so I was really hoping that wouldn’t be the case yet again! At the very least, a little ways into our drive, the skies seemed to clear which opened up the road for some spectacular views. The entire 3 hours of driving is on an unpaved road with some pretty awful parts of the road that we tackled with vigor in that trusty little vehicle!\n\nAnd as I have said before, no road trip is complete in Lesotho without some slow moving traffic! Also, it’s lab season so we saw a bunch of these cuties as well!\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the park, burrrrrrrrr! It was definitely chilly, and I could not have been more happy and thankful for that sweatshirt my host mother gifted me!! There was a new headquarters and housing all setup. We stopped in and the guy tending the reception put us up in the little rondavals! We were so excited that we could spend at least one of our nights under a thatch roof.\n\nWhile the drive was clear, we didn’t have quite as much inside the park. But I have to admit that it was eerily fun to do a bit of hiking through the fog and mist. At one point, we even were hailed on briefly. It was the perfect weather and temperature to do a bit of light jogging!\n\nJust outside the clouds:\n\nThis is seriously such a beautiful place! The next time I return to Lesotho and venture out the park, I want to spend at least a week here to really get to explore and not have to worry about the fog interrupting my plans! A few more views from the Sehlabathebe area:\n\nSince we were sleeping in a rondaval, it only felt appropriate that we also treat ourselves to the full Lesotho experience and have some Maluti beer as well! The fact that we needed to turn the heater on, only made it all that much more nostalgic!\n\nAll good things must come to an end, and we had to sadly venture back out of the park and back towards Maseru.\n\nBut the way back to Maseru, we weren’t taking the scenic route via Quthing. Instead there was the nicely paved road through Semonkong, a popular tourist destination, that significantly reduces the travel distance and time from QN to Maseru. Naturally we made a stop in at Semonkong to eat lunch and take in some of the beautiful scenery!\n\nNever fails to find the slow moving traffic:\n\nDrive down from Semonkong to Maseru:\n\nWe met up with some current PCVs in Lesotho, a couple from the group that had replaced most of our group and one who began her service shortly after our and has extended a couple of times. It was a stark reminder of why we were glad to be out of PC, even though I am still technically in it! Response is thankfully a bit better!\n\nLeaving Maseru took us FAR longer than we had anticipated because of this ridiculous traffic jam that occurred and then worsened when these trucks got stuck without being able to maneuver appropriately!\n\nWe made one last stop in Berea so I could visit with my training host family. My host mother is a lively 86 year old women! It was really awesome to get to see them, even if it was a brief hello. The road back to the village had also improved significantly since we were in training and there were so many new houses being built in the area! I also got to meet my 2 nieces from the family, one of which was celebrating her first birthday.\n\nWe then attempted to find the new training village to visit with our language teachers, but we were given bad directions and got lost on this terrible road that we just had to cut our losses and head back to Johannesburg!\n\nIt was such an amazing trip to Lesotho, and quite possibly the best way to do a first return trip because we left wanting more. I will definitely return here many more times because it is ultimately a place I will forever call home! Mary and I even talked about retiring in Lesotho and setting up our own little B&B, though half jokingly! It was such an incredible journey, but we were certainly exhausted from all the driving and travel!\n\nMore to come on the Botswana portion of our vacation!\n\nI know I have said this a million times or more, but home is always a funny word that takes on so many different meanings. One of the most important homes I have ever experienced in my lifetime is the home I had in Mokhotlong, Lesotho. Getting to return to it almost exactly 2 years after leaving it was a whirlwind, as well the rest of the crazy adventure that we tagged with #MosaReleboRoadTrip or #MosaReleboTakeOnLesotho.\n\nWhile living in Lesotho, I went by the name Mosa, and my wonderful friend Mary, went by Relebohile (Relebo for short) during training and Rethabile at site. I literally could not have found a better travel companion for the first return trip to Lesotho!\n\nSo the adventure begins in Lilongwe in a tiny little airport. I had to laugh a little when we exited the terminal to get on a bus that drove us to this plane. I could have walked to the plane in the time it took for everyone to load onto the bus. It was a tiny airport trying to act like a big one, and it definitely made me chuckle. There’s very few flights that go in and out of this airport on a daily basis, and the one from Lilongwe to Johannesburg makes a stop over in Blantyre (southern Malawian city).\n\nI arrived in Johannesburg airport a couple of hours before Mary’s plane would land so it gave me time to wander around the terminal to get food and a South African SIM card. It was so unreal to actually see her for the first time in 2 years, knowing that we were about to return to where we left off. We were taking Lesotho by storm, and no better way to do that than by rental car. Thankfully Mary is no longer associated with Peace Corps so she was restricted by all the same rules around travel like I am.\n\nAs we were making our way down to Clarens (approx 4 hours south of Johannesburg), a small artsy town near the border to Butha-Buthe, we were jamming to some Backstreet Boys and other fun throwbacks! If you’ve ever done public transport in Lesotho, you would know just how much we appreciated being able to be in control of the music and more importantly the volume! Then, the foothills and mountains started appearing, and I cannot even begin to explain our ridiculous excitement, yelling “LITHABA!” (Mountains!) with pure glee and laughing. We both could feel our hearts thumping with excitement and joy.\n\nWe arrived in Clarens around 7, and were definitely ready to eat. Clarens is FULL of fun cute places to eat, and we stumbled into a pub and enjoyed some lovely greasy deep-fried bar food and delightful drink to cheers the beginning of this beautiful reunion and the adventure that awaited us. After dinner, things got a little weird. We showed up to our hostel, one of the few places we had pre-booked for this trip, and there was no one around. No reception. No note. No response to a phone call or whatsapp text message. There was one bunkhouse with a light on, and we wandered in and found another traveler, from South Africa, who said he was told to just make himself at home when he arrived. We were all kind of in this same boat of feeling, this is strange, but oh well. In the morning there were some housekeeping and maintenance staff around, but still no reception. We could have easily just left without paying and hardly anyone would have even known we were there! But, it was the beginning of the trip and we wanted good karma on our side, so we found a way to pay and then ventured back into town!\n\nWe had actually wanted to make it to Clarens Brewery the night before, but since it was a Sunday it closed an hour earlier than Google had said, we couldn’t have arrived on time. After a wonderful breakfast including sourdough bread and pouched eggs with avocado and bacon, we figured, what would be better than a morning craft beer!?! Though we had some time to kill between breakfast and the brewery opening, so we had a chance to wander around the town square, check out some art galleries and shops and take in the surrounding view.\n\nKnowing we would be on the road for the next week in Lesotho with limited options for good alcohol, we each bought ourselves a 12-pack assortment of craft beers from here because they were so good! I forgot just how much I love good beer. They also had a lovely pre-mixed craft gin and tonic bottled. Our new South African friend sat with us for a good while and it was an unexpected deep conversation about racism and political problems and the comparisons that could be made between South Africa and the USA.\n\nBy the early afternoon we crossed the border. There was something so comforting about returning to Lesotho. My brain suddenly flooded with Sesotho words I hadn’t used in forever or would have ever thought I would remember. I have already since forgotten them again even! Seeing signs written in Sesotho and being able to read them as well was really fun. And then just knowing the way and no longer needing GPS was glorious. We were home and at ease.\n\nThen the drive up into the mountains began. This is one of the many gorgeous drives and mountain passes you can find in The Mountain Kingdom, but I am a bit biases towards this one since it was my route home for 2 years. These are views just as we were leaving Butha Buthe town, but right before we started to climb up the Moteng Pass.\n\nArchitecture in Lesotho is primarily built with stones as seen below. Basotho really know how to stack rocks as if they were puzzle pieces meant to go together is a specific way. The thatch and tin roofing are also very typical.\n\nI always remember thinking just how much I would never want to be a truck driver on these mountain roads! This pass in particular has some very winding switchbacks, and some of the curves have some less than great pot holes to dodge. It was also nice to see everything starting to turn green with the SNOW that had just melted from the week before. Sometimes this would be a full on waterfall.\n\nCount just how many segments of the road you can see all the way down into the valley! ALL THE CURVES!\n\nAgain, I am fascinated by the various chunks of the road you can see at various heights.\n\nA herd boy hut with a view down until lower Butha Buthe district. The town would be in the far off distance where the mountains seem to fade or disappear. Herd boys travel with the animals long distances and there are several huts like this scattered throughout the mountains to be used as temporary shelter.\n\nOur true excitement about having this gem of a car to drive ourselves around this gorgeous country. Though I will definitely admit we were super happy not to be there the week before when there was snow on these winding mountain roads!\n\nWhile I was living in Mokhotlong, it would take at least 4 hours by public transport to travel from Butha-Buthe to Mokhotlong town with a 2 hour stretch being unpaved. By the end of my service most of it was newly paved, with just a half hour remaining of the gravel pot-hole filled road. The road was smooth as butter and freshly painted. A lot of the roads you find in Lesotho have faded lines, or no lines at all.\n\nWe made a quick stop for lunch at Afri-Ski’s Sky Restaurant, “the highest restaurant in Africa.” During the winter months, there’s a ski slop on that patch of grass slanting up to the right, but nothing to get too terribly excited about sadly. The ponds of water around are used to create the snow in case there’s a lack of snowfall. The temperatures are definitely cold enough in the winter in Mokhotlong to maintain the snow once it’s created.\n\nNot far down the road from Afri-Ski, we passed by Letseng Diamond Mine. The 15th largest diamond, a 603 carat white diamond, ever found was mined here in 2006.\n\nThen on through Mapholaneng, the only other main town center in the district, about an hour by public from the Mokhotlong camptown. My site was situated almost exactly halfway between these 2 towns, which meant excellent cell reception for me!\n\nIt was all too surreal when we were finally passing by my site! My village is the cluster of house you can see on the right side down in the valley a little. I will never forget that horrendous hike between the road and my hut. It would take me 15-20 minutes to hike up and only 3-5 minutes to hike down! I only ever fell once, and it happened while carrying 5 dozen eggs naturally, though only a dozen were casualties! ha. I truly perfectly gracefully sliding! You can see my school off on the left side, also a ways down from the road, but that hike was a little less steep, though still a rough uphill climb!\n\nThe view of my village from around the bend in the road. It’s the string of huts in the middle of the photo on the right hand side. Another volunteer lived on the right hand side of the mountain in the distance on the left hand side of the photo. It was about a 4 hour hike that I never actually tried.\n\nWe had a jam-packed schedule, so there wasn’t any time to stop for a visit on the day we arrived in Mokhotlong.\n\nInstead we made our way out to Sani Pass, a popular tourist destination that I had been out to on several occasions, but Mary had only seen once when there was a thick wall of fog that kept the beautiful views hidden. The road out to Sani had also only been finished being paved near the end of my service, but it hadn’t been painted nor had all the lovely signs been posted! Road signs are few and far between, unless it’s a new road!\n\nSani Mountain Lodge claims to have the “highest Pub in Africa” though it not as high up as the Sky Restaurant! ha. You can stay there in traditional rondavals (the round huts with thatch roofs) but it’s definitely one of the more expensive places to stay.\n\nBut the real gem of going to Sani Top is to see the view of the winding dirt road pass that requires a 4×4 to drive on it! The Lesotho border gate is at the top of the pass, and the South Africa passport control is at the bottom, at least a 30 minute drive between the two in “no mans land.”\n\nWe hung around just long enough to catch the sun setting and then to drive back to town towards the rain!\n\nCovering around 326 km in a single day, we were ready to crash, no doubt! Staying in Mokhotlong town in a guest room at TTL (Touching Tiny Lives). While I was in Peace Corps, I made friends with the various fellows who worked at TTL for usually around a year and were from the US or Canada or UK/Spain. They do great work with helping malnourished children in rural areas so we were happy to be supporting the organization by lodging in their newly formed guest house started as a form on income generation for the organization.\n\nA lot can happen in two years! Not only were the roads to BB and Sani completely paved, but also, there was now a Shoprite complex in town!!!!! Shoprite is a popular grocery store chain which doesn’t sound like a big deal, but during my time living in the district, there were only a few select produce items you could guarantee to find in town: potatoes, tomatoes, onions, bananas, and apples. This is why I made myself A LOT of banana bread! Chocolate had only readily become available in Mokhotlong just prior to my arrival to site. At Shoprite, they had ice cream, a ridiculous variety of produce, cheese, and so many other items that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously!\n\nFinally, off to my site we went for the day! (day 3 of the road trip!)\n\nReturning to site was a whirlwind of emotions for sure! So unreal! I worked with such an incredible staff and it was amazing to see what they had all been up to in the meantime! When I left, I had promised to return, but no one believe I actually would.\n\nThe electric poles had been going up in the last month of my service, so my village had electricity meaning my host father got himself a grain grinder. I had been helping him research them as well as looking at egg incubators. It was cool to see what electricity can do for a village!\n\nMy host family were so beyond happy to see me, and the feeling of excitement was mutual. Naturally, in Basotho style, my M’e’ (mother) made us a delicious local meal of papa and moroho (maize meal and greens) with an extra special treat of sausage and coleslaw! She also gave me a soft gray sweatshirt and gave Mary a pair of comfy leggings. Totally unexpected gifts, but man oh man did that sweatshirt come in super handy up in the mountains during our trip!\n\nThe school had quite a lot happening as well. They had built new latrines for the girls. There was a new kitchen; the old one was just a small tin shack building after the original kitchen was blown away thanks to the strong winds. The new one was far bigger and an actual structure! The old tin shack has been turned into the wood storage area so they don’t have to worry about it getting wet outside anymore! They also moved the library into a bigger space with more light and room for a reading space. They also started a piggery in the hope of creating sustainable income from selling the piglets. They had some of the computers actually functioning and had bought black curtains for the science lab so that they could more effectively use the projector I helped get them for teaching purposes or movie nights to help improve their English.\n\nI was also super excited to hear that the GLOW club I helped the girls start was still going strong, and that even some of my girls were going to other schools to explain how they could start their own GLOW clubs! It was interesting to see my 8th grade students now as Juniors, too!! I absolutely loved having time to hang out with my teachers and learn about all the stuff happening.\n\nTime flew by and soon enough we were on our way back to town. I had arranged to meet up with my friend, M’e’ Malithebe who works at the hospital in town for dinner. Naturally, a trip to Mokhotlong would not have been complete without ordering a pizza from the Mokhotlong Hotel! haha. It is still my opinion that it was the best pizza in Lesotho, especially if you consider the price!\n\nIt is definitely weird to think about how life just continues everywhere even though I get wrapped up into whatever is immediately around me. My friend now had a baby and was engaged. It was so absolutely wonderful seeing her.\n\nThe next morning, on the 2 year anniversary date of my leaving site for COS (close of service), I left Mokhotlong yet again! We made our way back down out of the mountains to Maseru.\n\nNo road trip is complete without sheep traffic!\n\nMade a quick restroom stop at Oxbow Lodge. This was a typical stop for public transport as well, so I knew these bathrooms were open to the public! haha. There was also a pretty waterfall behind the lodge that is always beautiful to check out.\n\nMore photos of mountains on the drive down…\n\nThe mountains start to change as you pass from district to district. You can tell you are getting closer to Maseru once the mountains become foothills and there’s more randomly places plateaus that are more rocky in appearance.\n\nSoon we were passing by our old training villages: Berea, Ha Mabekanyane, and Makola.\n\nWe had to make a special stop in front of the taxi (minibus) stop for Berea and sing the song we learned when we were being taught the vocabulary for transportation in Sesotho.\n\nEventually we actually arrived in Maseru!\n\nAfter lunch, we made our way to the new Peace Corps office, which was moved several months after we had COS’d.\n\nIt was so awesome to get to visit with staff, especially our supervisor Ntate Clement who is still one of my favorite bosses I have ever worked with so far!\n\nIt happened to be the night before Thanksgiving so we were treating ourselves to a pampered night in the city which had been off limits for a lot of our service or under special surveillance that required us to have special permission to be in the city while we were PCVs there. It was nice to have some freedom and not operate under PC’s restrictions. Our restaurant of choice was Peri-Peri, a Portuguese place with good steak! We definitely treated ourselves to a meal worthy of Thanksgiving and we felt plenty stuffed. We then stayed at Kick4Life Hotel which supports a lot of cool work being done with that organization as well!\n\nThe next morning we went to quickly visit my host brother from training. He lives just outside Maseru city and had a baby girl! It was really cool to get to visit with him and meet my niece who was such a sweet cooperative baby!\n\nAfter a quick visit, we were off to Mary’s site in Quthing! To the south we go!!!
