        "text": "Thousands of Basotho attended the inauguration ceremony at the Setsoto Stadium in Maseru to witness Matekane take his oath of office as the 7th Prime Minister of the Mountain Kingdom. They were joined by His Majesty King Letsie III and regional leaders including the Presidents of South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Botswana, as well as heads of international organisations.\n\nThe inauguration follows the October 7 General Elections which saw Matekane’s Revolution for Prosperity (RFP) party win the polls but fall short of an overall majority, leading to the formation of a coalition government with two other political parties - the Alliance for Democrats and Movement for Economic Change. The Commonwealth Observer Group declared the elections calm and peaceful.\n\nIn his inauguration address, Prime Minister Matekane said:\n\n“For many days, I went around this country asking you to elect my party into government. Today I address you with a deep sense of gratitude and humility to accept the baton as the 7th Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\n\n“I promise that I will spearhead the process to write our country's historical role and make Lesotho great again.”\n\nThe new prime minister outlined six strategic goals which his government will pursue, including:\n\nEnhancing inclusive and sustainable economic growth and private-sector job creation\n\nStrengthening human capital\n\nBuilding an enabling infrastructure\n\nStrengthening national governance and accountability for improved service delivery\n\nStrengthening climate risk management, resilience, and adaptation\n\nStrengthening public financial management\n\n“Our ability to achieve these six strategic goals will likely depend on the actions which my government will take in the first 100 days of this tenure,” Prime Minister Matekane said.\n\nSpeaking after the inauguration, the Commonwealth Secretary-General said:\n\n“I am truly honoured and privileged to be here today with the Basotho and friends from the Commonwealth to witness the swearing-in of Prime Minister Samuel Matekane.\n\nOn behalf of the Commonwealth family of nations, I offer my warmest congratulations to the new Prime Minister and the Basotho on their commitment to a peaceful election and a smooth transfer of power.\n\nLesotho and the Commonwealth share a longstanding commitment to friendship, peace and values embodied in the Commonwealth Charter. It is in that spirit that I look forward to continuing working with the people and government of Lesotho to advance our shared goal of a thriving and stable democracy for generations to come.”\n\nThe Secretary-General is currently on a week-long visit to Lesotho and South Africa which will see her hold meetings with leaders in both countries and key stakeholders to discuss issues of mutual interest and address bilateral and global issues affecting the Commonwealth.\n\nIn Lesotho, the Secretary-General held an audience with His Majesty King Letsie III, and later with Prime Minister Matekane, to discuss the Commonwealth Secretariat’s continued support to the country.\n\nMedia contact"
