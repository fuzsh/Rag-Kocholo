They serve as focal point for both the government and citizens of the host country as well as German citizens residing in or visiting the country.\n\nGerman Honorary Consuls are working in an honorary capacity and – based on the longterm experience in the country have excellent contacts, are well versed in the local circumstances and can therefore render valuable assistance to the Embassy in charge as well as Germans in distress.\n\nThe tasks to be performed by the German Honorary Consul in Maseru mainly consist of securing the interests of Germany and its citizens in Lesotho as well as in fostering the relations between Lesotho and Germany.\n\nMs Lebofa supports and complements the work of the German Embassy in Pretoria in a broad way, for example in the field of bilateral political relations, consular affairs, cultural cooperation, promotion of trade and commerce as well as building a positive and modern image of Germany abroad."
