        "text": "Purpose of elections No party won an outright majority in the early elections that followed political instability and a coup attempt in August 2014. The Democratic Congress (DC), led by former Prime Minister Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, won 47 seats, one more than the All Basotho Convention (ABC), led by Prime Minister Thomas Thobane. The DC - which had ruled the country for 14 years until the 2012 elections - subsequently formed a coalition government comprising seven parties, controlling 66 seats in the 120-member National Assembly. Mr. Mothetjoa Metsing, the outgoing Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) - whose defection from the ABC-led coalition government had preceded the 2014 political crisis - became Deputy Prime Minister in Mr. Mosisili's new government. During the election campaigning, the major issues included fighting against extreme poverty and corruption and forming a stable government to unite the country.\n\nThe country had experienced political instability since March 2014. In the 2012 elections, Mr. Mosisili's Democratic Congress (DC) became the largest party but three smaller parties - the ABC, the LCD and the Basotho National Party (BNP) - formed the first ever coalition government in Lesotho. In March 2014, the LCD submitted a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Thabane. In June, the Prime Minister suspended Parliament in an apparent bid to avoid the no confidence motion. On 30 August, shortly after the Prime Minister dismissed a key ally of Deputy Prime Minister Metsing in the Lesotho Defence Force, soldiers assaulted the Prime Minister's residence The latter temporarily fled to South Africa before returning to Lesotho the following month and resuming the premiership. On 2 October, under the mediation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), all political parties signed the Maseru Facilitation Declaration. That paved the way for the reconvening of Parliament by King Letsie III on 17 October and holding of early elections in February 2015, instead of 2017.
