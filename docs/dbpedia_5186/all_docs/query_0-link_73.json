        "text": "General Information\n\nLesotho is a developing nation classified as lower middle income. Located in southern Africa (entirely within the country of South Africa), the climate is classified as humid temperate (no dry season).\n\nVaccinations\n\nDepending on your itinerary, your personal risk factors, and the length of your visit, your health care provider may offer you vaccination against COVID-19, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, or typhoid fever. Routine immunizations, such as those that prevent tetanus/diphtheria or \"childhood\" diseases, should be reviewed and updated as needed.\n\nMalaria\n\nSee also: Library article for Malaria\n\nThe following is current information as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC):\n\nWHO—International Travel and Health (current online update, Country List)\n\nNo statement given.\n\nCDC—Health Information for International Travel (current online edition)\n\nAreas with malaria: None.\n\nDrug resistance: Not applicable.\n\nOther Concerns\n\nTravelers' Diarrhea\n\nSee also: Library article for Travelers' Diarrhea\n\nModerate risk exists throughout the country, including in deluxe accommodations. Community sanitation and food safety measures may be inadequate. Some itineraries (e.g., remote destinations, austere accommodations) and activities (e.g., ecotourism, eating street or local-market food) further increase risk.\n\nTravelers should observe food and beverage precautions, which reduce the likelihood of illness.\n\nTravelers should carry loperamide for self-treatment of diarrhea and, if risk is moderate to high, an antibiotic to add if diarrhea is severe. Consult a knowledgeable health care provider regarding which antibiotic is appropriate for you and most effective for your destination.\n\nOther Food-Borne Illnesses\n\nPrecautions to prevent brucellosis may be needed.\n\nInsect- and Arthropod-Borne Diseases\n\nTick-bite fever may pose a risk. Personal protective measures are important.\n\nOther Disease and Health Risks\n\nAdditional concerns include anthrax disease, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, helminths, leptospirosis, plague, schistosomiasis, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis.\n\nConsular Advice\n\nTerrorism Risk\n\nNo intrinsic risk of attack by terrorist groups exists, but unforeseen attacks are possible.\n\nCrime\n\nHigh risk of violent crime (armed robbery, home invasion, sexual assault, and carjacking) and high risk of petty crime exist throughout the country, especially in Maseru (particularly in downtown areas) and other cities, and in restaurants and locations frequented by foreigners.\n\nCivil Unrest\n\nProtests and demonstrations may infrequently occur, especially in Maseru, and have the potential to turn violent without warning. Bystanders are at risk of harm from violence or from the response by authorities. Disruption to transportation, free movement, or the ability to carry out daily activities may occur.\n\nTransportation Safety\n\nSignificant risk of traffic-related injury or death exists. The road traffic death rate is more than 24 per 100,000 population, the highest risk category. Carefully assess the safety of transportation options before any road travel.\n\nSpeed laws are poorly enforced.\n\nDrunk driving laws are poorly enforced.\n\nThere are no restrictions on mobile phone usage while driving.\n\nStructural standards for vehicles may not meet international standards.\n\nNatural Disasters\n\nThe rainy season is from October through April. Floods, mudslides, and landslides may occur.\n\nConsular Information\n\nSelected Embassies or Consulates in Lesotho\n\nUnited States: [+266] 22-312-666; ls.usembassy.gov\n\nCanada: Canada does not have an embassy or consulate in Lesotho.\n\nUnited Kingdom: U.K. does not have an embassy or consulate in Lesotho.\n\nAustralia: Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in Lesotho.\n\nLesotho's Embassies or Consulates in Selected Countries\n\nIn the U.S.: www.lesothoemb-usa.gov.ls\n\nIn Canada: www.lesothocanada.gov.ls\n\nIn the U.K.: www.lesotholondon.org.uk\n\nIn Australia: [+61] 02-4961-5691\n\nVisa/HIV Testing\n\nHIV and hepatitis testing may be required to obtain a work or residence visa."
