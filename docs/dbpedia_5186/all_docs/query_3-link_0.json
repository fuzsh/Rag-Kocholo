        "text": "Lesotho was an independent kingdom until it came under British rule in the late 19th century. Prior to gaining independence in 1966, it was known as Basutoland. While completely encircled by South Africa, the Kingdom of Lesotho is isolated by the Drakensberg Mountains. The country experienced a series of coups until the return of multi-party democratic elections in 1993; the repeated coups, including an attempted one in 2014, are a reflection of the power of the army and the constant tussle for power between politicians and the monarchy in a context of underdevelopment. Lesotho’s politics have also been destabilised by its constitutional arrangements, which have produced chronically weak coalition governments, politicised security forces and a judiciary vulnerable to political interference. Since 2012, repeated efforts have been made to address these deficiencies through a comprehensive package of constitutional reforms but have been frustrated by the very political instability they are designed to rectify. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has repeatedly had to intervene in Lesotho to ensure democratic stability, and the reform program has been a major priority of the international community.\n\nThe most recent election revealed that development issues remain top of mind for voters, as poverty, hunger, and unemployment continue to loom large. Public health challenges remain pressing, as Lesotho has the third-highest HIV/AIDS infection rate in the world (one in five adults) and one of the lowest life expectancies (55 years). Large-scale corruption in the public sector has undermined confidence in key institutions.\n\nIn recent years, majorities have expressed support for greater gender equality, including in terms of women’s eligibility to become chiefs. The country has experimented with the use of gender quotas. Abortion, while currently illegal in Lesotho, is a subject of fiery debate, and women suffer from widespread gender-based violence. LGBTQIA+ rights also constitute a major societal cleavage, and while same-sex sexual relations were legalized in 2012, no other protections currently exist. The presence of so many competing issues and societal cleavages has further complicated the passage of the national reform agenda."
