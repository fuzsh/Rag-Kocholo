        "text": "The legal system is based on Roman-Dutch law, with elements of British and customary law also playing a role. There are local and central courts, judicial commissioners’ courts, subordinate courts, and a court of appeal, with the High Court as the superior court of record. Magistrates’ courts exist in the districts. Lesotho maintains only a small defense force and relies on South Africa for its external security.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Sam Matekane\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 2,120,000\n\nHead Of State:\n\nKing: Letsie III\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nconstitutional monarchy with two legislative houses (Senate [33 nonelected seats]; National Assembly [120])\n\nUnder customary law, women cannot inherit land. When a family does not have a son to inherit the land, it reverts back to the chief. This practice was amended by the 1979 Land Act to allow women the right to remain on the property should their husbands die before them. Because of the nature of the migratory work patterns of men, women are increasingly becoming the heads of households, but the law has been slow to acknowledge this fact. Women have been elected to the National Assembly, but they constitute only a small minority of the membership, despite effort to increase the participation of women in politics. However, in the country’s first local government elections, held in 2005, slightly more than half of the councillors elected were women.\n\nHealth and welfare\n\nLesotho has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS infection in the world. Although HIV/AIDS was first detected in Lesotho in the mid-1980s, the government was slow to address it, and the disease quickly spread: in 2001 almost one-third of the population was infected with HIV; within the next few years the rate had decreased slightly, hovering around one-fourth. Women—particularly younger women—account for more than half of all reported cases of HIV infection. Lesotho also has a high number of children orphaned by AIDS, and the number of children living with HIV/AIDS has risen, mainly the result of mother-to-child transmission. Through various national organizations—such as the Lesotho AIDS Programme Coordinating Authority and its successor, the National AIDS Commission—the government has made efforts to combat the AIDS pandemic by making treatment options more widely available, as well as promoting awareness of AIDS-prevention methods and the importance of knowing one’s HIV status.\n\nApart from AIDS, the main incidences of illness are nutrient-deficiency diseases, venereal diseases, chronic rheumatism, and infections of the respiratory tract, especially tuberculosis. In addition to these common maladies, by the early 21st century Lesotho had experienced an increase in the incidence of psychiatric illness and noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and hypertension, generally attributed to lifestyle changes in the general population.\n\nThere are several hospitals, about half of which are operated by the government, and a number of clinics, health centres, and dispensaries. However, health care delivery is uneven throughout the country, because of geographical obstacles presented by mountainous terrain, as well as some socioeconomic inequalities. The health care system in general is overwhelmed by the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS, and there is a lack of medical supplies and properly trained personnel.\n\nHousing\n\nThe capital, Maseru, consists of a modern city centre surrounded by suburbs for the large bureaucracy and for foreign aid and development personnel; shacks and informal settlements dot the perimeter. In the rural villages the walls and doors of many houses are covered with colourful painted designs. The villages themselves consist of clusters of circular or rectangular one-room houses solidly built of turf, Kimberley brick (unburned clay), or dressed stone. Traditionally, the roofs were thatched, but more-modern roofs are made of corrugated iron, as they are in many other parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe average household usually has two or three one-room houses, the largest one serving as a living and dining area and as the parents’ bedroom; the smaller ones are used for kitchen and storage purposes and as sleeping quarters for the children. The house of the chief, or headman, is usually in the centre of the village, protected by that of his principal wife and surrounded by those of his other wives. The lekhotla (open court) is in front of the chief’s house; beside it are the kraals (enclosures) for the cattle and stables for horses."
