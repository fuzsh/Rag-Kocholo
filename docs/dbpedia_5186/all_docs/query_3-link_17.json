        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in Lesotho\n\nAlthough there’s no recent history of terrorism in Lesotho, attacks cannot be ruled out.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nThere are occasional political demonstrations in Maseru. These are usually peaceful, but there is a risk of isolated incidents of violence. Move away from demonstrations or gatherings, particularly if you see the security forces are present. Lesotho successfully held elections in 2022 but has had a history which includes political-related violence in past decades.\n\nCrime\n\nMuch of the violent crime in Lesotho is gun crime between organised crime groups. However, foreigners are vulnerable to opportunistic street crime and vehicle crime.\n\nGender-based violence is very high in Lesotho. Most crimes based on gender are between people who already know each other, but violence towards women and girls happens in all areas of the country.\n\nMugging and violent vehicle crime\n\nMuggers can target foreign nationals. Do not walk alone in isolated areas or after dark.\n\nArmed carjackers or robbers may try to stop your car or get into it while you are stationary. The danger is greatest in urban areas. Do not stop your car if people try to flag you down and do not give lifts to strangers.\n\nKeep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. If you are driving across the country:\n\ntry to drive during daylight hours\n\ntake care near border crossings and at road junctions\n\nbe wary of road blocks that need you to stop or slow down\n\nIf you are caught up in an attack, do not offer any resistance.\n\nPetty theft and burglary\n\nTake precautions to safeguard your valuables and cash. Leave them in hotel safes, if possible. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport’s photo page and entry stamps, in a separate place.\n\nThere is often an increase in thefts, especially burglaries from villas, leading up to the Christmas and Easter holiday periods.\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nPersonal ID\n\nAlways carry a copy of the photo page of your passport and your entry stamp. Officials may ask to see these.\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nPossession of drugs is a serious offence and punishments can be severe, including prison sentences.\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nSexual activity between men is illegal, but FCDO is not aware of this being enforced. Showing affection in public may attract unwanted and negative attention.\n\nRead more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nYou can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Lesotho for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.\n\nDriving standards and road conditions in Lesotho are poor. You should drive with caution.\n\nAnimals roaming on the roads are a hazard, especially at night.\n\nTaxis and minibuses\n\nLocal minibus taxis (‘4+1s’) may be poorly maintained and uninsured. They often ignore road safety rules including speed limits. Avoid using them and steer clear of them when driving.\n\nIt’s safer to use transport arranged by your accommodation or by a tour operator."
