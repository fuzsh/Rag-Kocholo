        "text": "Season 2 Episode 24\n\nLesotho is a landlocked country in Southern Africa which is characterized by high altitude and highlands.\n\nWe’d be looking at some tourist sites of attractions where you can spend your holiday while you’re visiting Lesotho.\n\nEnjoy and keep in mind you’d have an amazing read\n\nTse’hlanyane National Park\n\nThis tourist attraction center is the largest National Park in Lesotho which can be found in the Northern part of Lesotho with breathtaking altitudes.\n\nThis National Park covers an area of 5600 hectares with a diversity of flora such as chichi trees, ferns, bamboos including fauna.\n\nKatse Dam\n\nThe Katse Dam in Lesotho is a highland that cuts through the Malibamat’s River as it flows down the highlands of Lesotho. It was as a result of the Lesotho Water Project where water was channeled from the highlands and transferred into the constructed dam.\n\nThe Katse is also characterized by the presence of a Botanical Garden where a variety of vegetation can be found.\n\nThe Katse Dam has the highest wall in Africa as it measures about 185 metres in height and about 2000 metres above sea level. This place serves as a center for tourists when they visit Lesotho as the tour through the walls of the dam, take a boat trip, visit the neighboring village and visit the Katse Botanical Gardens.\n\nSani Pass And The Highest Divider\n\nThe Sani Pass is characterized by a network of meander of roads which is known as an area for driving, hiking, mountain climbing, mountain biking. The Sani Pass is found at the Drakensberg Mountains and it passes across the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park as you can catch a view of it while driving.\n\nThis place was a trail for animals in the past before it became a major route for driving and other mountain activities.\n\nSemonkong Falls\n\nThis area holds the The Guinness Book of Records for the highest abseil (sliding or going down a steep or high place using a rope or mechanical friction) as tourists and adventurers get the opportunity to explore this 204 metres abseil.\n\nThe Semonkong Falls is found in Semonkong and it is also referred to as Maletsunyane Falls. Semonkong is found in the Maseru District of Lesotho which is at the heart of Lesotho. The Semonkong Falls is a natural place to visit as the water can be seen forcing its way down the mountains with a loud roar.\n\nKome Caves\n\nThe Kome caves is a dwelling place which was carved inside the rocks by the Basia and Batung tribes which were the warring tribes over 200 years ago.\n\nThe Kome caves are still inhabited by the descendants of these tribes. These caves have paintings by the San (Bushmen) tribes which indicates that the San tribes might also be early dwellers of these caves. The caves are shaped like kilns and are plastered with mud.\n\nDinosaur Footprints\n\nLesotho is home to some of the footprints of dinosaurs as many archaeologists and paleontologists have found this place worthy to explore and carry out experiments. The fossils of dinosaurs and also trees, shells from prehistoric times can be found in this Nation.\n\nSome of these footprints can be found in the archives of Morija, a place where historic and fascinating relics are kept.\n\nWouldn’t you love to see what the footprint of a dinosaur looks like?"
