        "text": "Matekane, 64, announced the new three-party coalition in the capital, Maseru. His party, the Revolution for Prosperity, will team up with two smaller parties, the Alliance of Democrats and the Movement for Economic Change parties, to secure a parliamentary majority needed to form a government.\n\nMatekane, whose party was only launched in March this year, won 56 of the legislature's 120 seats in last week's general election, five shy of the 61-seat threshold required for any party to form a government on its own.\n\nAlthough he had emphasized the importance of his party governing alone to implement a “developmental agenda,” Matekane joined forces with the other parties after he failed to secure an outright win.\n\nTogether the two smaller parties are bringing 9 seats into the new coalition, giving Matekane's government a slim majority of 65 seats.\n\nAddressing the media Tuesday, Matekane said he chose the two parties because they share the same vision of cutting government expenditures and improving the delivery of government services to Lesotho's population.\n\nMatekane said the coalition’s immediate tasks will be \"reining government expenditure, stabilizing the economy and uniting the nation.” He said he would hold a weekend retreat with coalition partners to map the way forward.\n\nHundreds of supporters lined the streets near Matekane’s offices to celebrate his announcement of a new government.\n\nCommenting on Matekane’s victory in his first election, National University of Lesotho political science lecturer Tlohang Letsie said his new party won because the electorate was fed up with the political status quo.\n\n“The votes came from a place of anger ... The election outcome is a clear message to all political parties that when people choose them to govern, they expect them to deliver,\" he said.\n\nMaseru resident Tene Mabuse voiced similar views.\n\n“I want the new government to create jobs. Previous governments failed the people, they only sought to promote and serve their own interests,\" Mabuse said. “I’m happy the Revolution for Progress has won because we need new players. We need them to create jobs.”\n\nLesotho has been plagued by chronic instability and widespread poverty."
