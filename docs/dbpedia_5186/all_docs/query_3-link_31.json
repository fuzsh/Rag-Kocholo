        "text": "Lesotho is a small, landlocked, and mountainous country. It is an enclave entirely surrounded by South Africa. The government system is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; the chief of state is the king, and the head of government is the prime minister. Lesotho has a market-based economy, but the tradition of direct government involvement in economic activity limits private sector development. Lesotho is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)."
