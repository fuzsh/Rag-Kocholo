        "text": "Visit Lesotho and you will quickly understand how this tiny country earned its title as Africa’s “Kingdom in the Sky”. Here are the best things to do and places to visit in Lesotho, the mountain kingdom.\n\nSkiing in Lesotho\n\nSkiing in Lesotho is just another reason to visit this landlocked country. June through August is the best time to make the most of Lesotho’s high altitudes and freezing winter temperatures.\n\nThe ski slopes are only 3 hours from the capital of Lesotho, Maseru, high in the Maluti mountains in the Oxbow area. One of only two resorts in Africa, Mahlesela Hill is the longest in Africa at 2km long.\n\nThis means the more difficult access areas of Lesotho’s mountain regions can be visited with ease, without having to worry about renting a car or self-driving while you are visiting Lesotho.\n\nFor overnight tours and adventures, Avani has partnered with the best lodges in each area to provide you with the best accommodation available in the mountain villages.\n\nAvani Lesotho is located on the hill with sweeping views of the city and surrounding valleys. With a swimming pool, large deluxe guest suites, numerous in-house dining options and casino, Avani Lesotho is the best hotel you will find in Maseru and Lesotho.\n\nWhile the Avani Hotel & Casino caters to a more sophisticated traveller, the smaller of the group, Avani Maseru located in the city centre caters well to families.\n\nCurrently undergoing upgrade and renovation, Avani Maseru strives to meet the high standards of her sister hotel on the hill in a bid to promote tourism in Lesotho.\n\nWe would like to thank Avani Hotel & Casino for hosting us during our stay in Lesotho. As always, all opinions are our own."
