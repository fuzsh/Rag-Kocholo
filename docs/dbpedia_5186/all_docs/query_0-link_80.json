SADCC transformed into the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in 1992. Situated in the south-eastern region of Southern Africa, Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa.\n\nLesotho’s geographical formation is characterised by high mountains and deep valleys, and it is the only country in the world to have all its entire territory located at more than 1,000 metres above sea level. More than 75% of Lesotho is mountainous, with only 25% considered lowland."
