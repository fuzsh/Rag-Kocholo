        "text": "For those who want back to basic, Lesotho is an absolute must. A trip to Lesotho brings you back to the original form. Discover the untouched ecosystems of Lesotho where animals and humans live in harmony and be amazed by the overwhelming nature. The hospitable people of Lesotho welcome you with open arms.\n\nLike a kingdom in the sky, Lesotho is like an island in the middle of South Africa. No fewer than 436,000 of the 2.1 million inhabitants live in the capital Maseru. Maseru is therefore a lively city, with African, Asian and European influences. There is a relaxed atmosphere and it is an excellent place as a base for trips to the rest of Lesotho.\n\nThe local children are excellent guides for a small fee. You can take a shuttle bus from Hyperama supermarket in Maseru to Thaba-Bosiu, a ruin mountain town. Here is the fort from 1860 by King Moshoeshoe the Great. This is considered a national monument, since it has never been in the hands of the enemy because of its strategic location. Here you will find a visitor center and also a beautiful view of the Qiloane peak, which was the model for the famous Basotho hat. At Subeng you can witness the remains of dinosaurs.\n\nHiking through the deserted mountains in Sehlabathebe National Park is popular in Lesotho. You will not come face to face with dangerous wild animals here. Be sure to visit the Meletsunyane waterfalls in Molimo Nthuse.\n\nLesotho has two official languages, Sesotho and English. Most residents speak both languages. You can therefore use English perfectly during your trip here.\n\nCulture Lesotho\n\nThe history of Lesotho goes back a long way. Petrified forests and dinosaur footprints are proof of this. The murals of the Bushmen, who are more than 50,000 years old, are a silent witness to the rich history.\n\nOld rituals, customs and superstitions play a role every day. Livestock is a status symbol and is sacrificed.\n\nPeople still lead a traditional and simple existence. Lesotho still has many old craftsmen, who produce beautiful products from, among other things, pottery, silver and mohair. The typical handmade, grass-woven, Mokorotlo hats have become the logo of this beautiful country.\n\nGeography Lesotho\n\nThe nickname of Lesotho is “Kingdom in the sky”, Kingdom in the sky. It owes this name to the height at which it is located. The whole of Lesotho is above 1000 meters. Wherever you are in Lesotho, you can always count on spectacular views. The kingdom of Lesotho is just as large as Belgium and is encircled by South Africa over the entire 909 km. On the east side form the Maluti (Drakensberg) a natural border. The highest mountain of this chain, the Thabana Ntlenyana is 3482 m high and is located in Lesotho.\n\nHandy information:\n\nThe currency is Loti (plural: Maloti) whose value is equal to the South African Rand.\n\npower supply: 220 / 240V AC 50Hz\n\nIt is forbidden to import alcohol without an import permit when traveling to Lesotho.\n\nWinter sports are also possible in Lesotho. At the Afri-Ski resort you can ski in the winter and mountain biking or hiking in the summer.\n\nAdd to my travel plans"
