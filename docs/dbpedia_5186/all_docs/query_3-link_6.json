        "text": "Lesotho has pursued a growth model that emphasizes the importance of expediting the ongoing national reforms from 2021 to 2023.\n\nThe country held its general elections on October 7, 2022. They were largely free, fair and peaceful. The new prime minister, Sam Ntsokoane Matekane, took over from Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro, who had assumed power in May 2020. This political transition brought considerable uncertainty, as government finances were in deficit. This was largely due to the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which weakened the economy. The National Coronavirus Economic Council (NACOSECC) was formed to prepare and respond to the negative effects caused by COVID-19. Its role was to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 to Lesotho. However, shortly after its formation, NACOSECC was characterized by mismanagement of funds, perpetuating more corruption by government officials who wanted to benefit as individuals by stealing money and misusing government resources. This period showed that Lesotho’s health system does not have the capacity to provide good health care that can cater to everyone in the country. COVID-19 and its prolonged lockdowns weakened the economy and led to an increase in debt and unemployment. Another devastating factor caused by COVID-19 is the loss of jobs, which has affected the livelihoods of many people.\n\nMatekane plans to transition the country from a development model that relies solely on the public sector to an export-oriented economy driven by a highly competitive private sector. The reforms aim to enhance institutions and foster transparency and accountability within the public sector. As part of these efforts, the country has been engaged in a five-year process to formulate and execute the second National Strategic Development Plan.\n\nLesotho is a mountainous country surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. It is a highly homogeneous country, with Sesotho being the dominant language. In the past, Sesotho and English were the two official languages, but recently, the Sephuthi and Xhosa languages were added to accommodate minority groups.\n\nLesotho became a British protectorate in 1886 and gained its independence from the colonial power in 1966. The country has experienced enormous challenges since then as different groups fought for control. The 1965 general elections were won by the Basotho National Party (BNP), which formed the first democratic government that ruled from 1966 to 1970. The 1970 election results were disputed, and the BNP refused to relinquish power to the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). Then followed a 16-year period of rule by the BNP, which was marred by conflict between armed forces and the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), a military wing of the BCP. The BNP government was toppled by a military coup in 1986. The Military Council ruled the country from 1986 until 1993, when a third general election was held. The BCP won all 65 constituencies and formed the second democratic government. Lesotho has held six other general elections since 1993. The BCP split in 1997, and a new parliamentary party, called Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), was formed by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, which formed the new government.\n\nIn the years that followed, Lesotho experienced several internal challenges to the legitimacy of the democratic state. In 1994, King Letsie III staged a military-backed coup and appointed an interim government after he unsuccessfully tried to persuade the ruling BCP to reinstate his father, Moshoeshoe II, who had been deposed and exiled after a fallout with the military government. Civil society groups mobilized stakeholders inside and outside Lesotho in order to put pressure on the king to revert to the constitution and reinstate a democratically elected government. A negotiated settlement resulted in the reinstatement of the BCP, and Letsie III abdicated in favor of his father. However, he returned to the throne soon after Moshoeshoe I’s subsequent death in an automobile accident. The second democratic elections since the return to democracy were held in 1998 and were won by LCD. Although international election observers described the poll as free and fair, opposition parties and their followers contested the outcome, with widespread violence and looting experienced across the country. This led to a Southern African Developed Community (SADC) military intervention, which was led by South Africa and later joined by Botswana and Zimbabwe. The government of Lesotho invited its southern African counterparts to intervene, as the state apparatus was paralyzed by the protests.\n\nLesotho’s democratic status has always been characterized by drama and double standards. On February 28, 2012, Basotho woke up to the news that the then-prime minister had formed a new political party. It was highly expected that the prime minister would cross the floor with those that followed him to the new party. The country went for the general elections in May 2012, in which no single party won a simple majority. The three former opposition parties, namely the All Basotho Convention (ABC), BNP and LCD formed a coalition government. This was the first time in the history of Lesotho that parties had been required to join forces in order to form a government. However, the coalition government collapsed due to corruption and a lack of trust among coalition partners. Eventually, the military attempted to overthrow the government in a failed coup on August 30, 2014. Lesotho headed for early elections on February 28, after the intervention of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The collapse of Lesotho’s first coalition government led the country to snap elections in February 2015. The most recent national elections were held in October 2022, in which a new party formed in just six months (RFP) won the elections, gaining 56 out of 120 parliamentary seats. It was followed by the Democratic Congress (DC), with 29 seats, and the other party which formed the outgoing coalition, the All Basotho Convention (ABC), with eight seats. The RFP was thus forced to form a coalition, combining with the Alliance for Democrats (AD), the Movement for Economic Change (MEC) and the Socialist Revolutionaries (SR).\n\nLesotho has been classified as a least developed country since the classification was introduced by the United Nations in 1971. Remittances have been the largest revenue earner for Lesotho. This followed the introduction of a household tax by the colonial regime, which forced Basotho men to go to work in the mines of the neighboring Republic of South Africa around 1900. An estimated two-thirds of the population live in rural areas, with agriculture being their main source of livelihood. Lesotho is one of the largest producers of wool and mohair in the world, but this industry has been in the media spotlight for the wrong reasons recently. A full 67% of the population is considered poor, with 43% of the population living below the poverty line. One factor that contributes to this is a high unemployment rate of about 24.6%.\n\nThere is no competition with the state’s monopoly on the use of force throughout the entire territory. This is mainly because the government of Lesotho controls the entire geographical territory, with its total surface area of 30,648 km2 and a population of 2.31 million people. Currently, there is no armed rebellion in Lesotho, and the state enjoys a full monopoly on the use of force. The armed forces include the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF), Lesotho Mounted Police Services (LMPS), the Lesotho Correctional Services (LCS), and the National Security Services (NSS), with Prime Minister Sam Ntsokoane Matekane also serving as the minister of defense, national security and environment. In addition, the government regulates the operations of private security companies that are allowed to provide services to individuals, the government and companies.\n\nTo maintain peace following periods of instability, the government of Lesotho has adopted Southern African Development Community (SADC) recommendations and has begun a process of reforming the country’s laws. The aim is to ensure peace and stability. The current prime minister has expressed his government’s readiness to expedite the implementation of ongoing national reforms in order to restore peace in the country.\n\nIndividuals interested in owning guns must apply for renewable gun licenses from the government, which includes restrictions on the caliber of guns eligible for ownership. Presently, Lesotho is considered the most dangerous country in Africa, as indicated by its murder statistics and prevalence of other violent crimes. Notably, the misuse of firearms is a prominent issue, as the country lacks the capacity to effectively combat the illegal possession and use of firearms. Consequently, this has led to incidents of daylight shootings and assassinations.\n\nThere is also rivalry among musicians (Famo music) in the Mafeteng district. The artists boast and resort to gun violence to settle their disputes, which has led to a rise in the incidence of gun violence in Lesotho. This has escalated to “gangsterism” tendencies with territorial markings using different blanket colors, where a certain color symbolizes loyalty to a specific Famo music group.\n\nThe “Wise Voter” research platform shows that low crime rates in a country are usually associated with strict gun control laws, effective law enforcement and a high standard of health care; however, Lesotho lacks in all these areas.\n\nThe administrative structures of the state provide the most basic public services throughout the country, but their operation is, to some extent, deficient due to a lack of resources.\n\nA total of 72.2% of the population has access to water, 50.3% has access to basic sanitation, and 47.4% has access to electricity. However, there is a significant disparity between rural and urban areas.\n\nThe government of Lesotho maintains the Department of Rural Water Supply, which is responsible for ensuring the development, protection and regular maintenance of water sources for people in rural areas. The Water and Sewage Company (WASCO) is a government parastatal that is responsible for providing water and sanitation services in Lesotho, covering both urban and semi-urban areas. The government is currently initiating efforts to ensure that every district has access to clean water and a reliable electricity supply.\n\nDespite numerous challenges, including those exacerbated by COVID-19, the country has made positive progress in numerous sectors. The country successfully introduced tax reforms aimed at improving domestic resource mobilization by bringing about collaboration between all institutions to enable effective compliance. The government of Lesotho adopted several initiatives. such as the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Policy, the Investment Policy and the Diaspora Strategy Engagement for Trade and Investment. It also strengthened the One-Stop Business Facilitation Center (OBFC) to enable investors to easily register companies and obtain tax registrations; industrial and trading licenses; immigration, residence and labor permits; and export and import permits and rebates. Additionally, the government embarked on the development of industrial infrastructure as a means of attracting foreign direct investment. It also developed a medium-term debt management strategy and produced development corporation reports to promote transparency and accountability in official development assistance management. Furthermore, it improved human rights conditions and addressed governance issues, enabling the country to receive further assistance from developmental partners. Moreover, the country implemented measures to improve access to technology and quality data for sustainable development. Although the prevalence of fixed broadband connections remains low in Lesotho, the government has managed to develop its telecommunications infrastructure and extend access to mobile communication services in remote areas.\n\nLesotho held general elections on October 7, 2022. 65 political parties registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) were represented in the elections, with each party having the freedom to campaign before election day. All media outlets were used without prejudice or favor toward any specific party. The voting process took place nationwide from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. nationwide. Every citizen who was 18 years old or older was eligible to vote, regardless of physical disabilities. A total of 1,387,861 voters voted at 1,649 voting stations across the country.\n\nThe elections were deemed free and fair. King Letsie III stated, “The elections were peaceful, free, transparent.” Eighty-seven international observers visited the voting sites in all 10 districts. The chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission did point out some errors in the voters’ data and on the voter roll. These errors were reported by the media prior to election day, but the IEC denied them and threatened civil action against entities spreading misinformation. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Lesotho Council of NGOs (LCN) election observers also brought attention to these errors. The executive director of LCN further added, “Names of voters were missing, and party agents had lists that were different from those held by the IEC staff. In some cases, voters’ names did not appear on the IEC-held voter roll and that of the party agents, yet their names appeared on the IEC website.”\n\nIn conclusion, the EU election mission stated that despite these errors, the election day was generally peaceful and well-managed.\n\nThe Afrobarometer survey conducted in July 2022, ahead of the elections, indicated that 49% of Basotho expressed interest in voting, while 42% stated they would not participate in the 2022 national elections.\n\nAccording to the voting station reports made by the LCN, the IEC ensured secrecy of the ballot through the security features on the ballot, as well as through the positioning of voting booths, which prevented anyone in the room from seeing an individual’s choice. All political parties had equal access to state media for their campaigns. As a result of the election outcome, political positions were filled based on the results. For example, the 11 additional Senate seats reflected the political outcome.\n\nThe constitution of Lesotho guarantees freedom of expression. Law enforcement officials in Lesotho are not allowed to use firearms to stop peaceful protest action, and the authorities are supposed to conduct comprehensive training with police officials on nonlethal and proportionate methods of crowd control.\n\nLesotho has witnessed numerous violations of human rights and freedom of expression. On June 16, 2022, a student from the National University of Lesotho (NUL) was fatally shot by the police during a protest on campus, while six other students were physically assaulted and sustained severe injuries at the hands of law enforcement officers.\n\nThe Transformation Resource Center (TRC), the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and the Southern Africa Litigation Center (SALC) have condemned this killing of a student and the physical assault on other students. The three organizations reminded the government of its legal obligations to respect and ensure the rights to life and freedom from ill-treatment, including during police operations at demonstrations. They emphasized that the government must protect, rather than violate, the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. These rights are guaranteed under the constitution of Lesotho and the international human rights treaties to which Lesotho is a party.\n\nFreedom of the press is only indirectly protected under constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. Journalists face threats and intimidation from both the authorities and private citizens. Journalists utilize available media outlets to ensure information is accessible to citizens, but unfortunately, this has led to past incidents of assaults, threats and kidnappings, instilling fear in some journalists and hindering their ability to report the news freely. Perpetrators of these acts are punished, regardless of their status or prominence in society.\n\nIn general, the judiciary enjoys independence but also suffers from several weaknesses. Although a separation of powers exists formally, judges are often perceived as corrupt and politicized. Moreover, the system is underfinanced.\n\nThe Court of Appeal and the High Court are the highest judicial institutions. The High Court can hear civil and criminal cases and review decisions taken by other subordinate courts. It also serves as the constitutional court.\n\nJudges are selected by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and then appointed by the king. Over the years, there have been cases of frustration over politicians’ interference in their roles and the lack of financial backing from various governments. Judges have been appointed based on favoritism, while some were dismissed or put on probation based on their decisions. Former Prime Minister Thomas Thabane was criticized for his interference in the judiciary, as he manipulated the appointments of judges (Kananelo Mosito) and sought to dismiss Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara without any legal basis.\n\nIn April 2020, the Constitutional Court of Lesotho declared that Prime Minister Thabane’s decision to prorogue parliament had been irrational and unlawful. It ruled that the action constituted an abuse of power and had been an attempt to avert a motion of no confidence, which was looming at the time of the declaration of a state of emergency. The court’s decision opened the door for parliament to amend the constitution, preventing the prime minister from calling snap elections in the event of losing a motion of no confidence.\n\nThabane was eventually ousted in May 2020, an event that would not have happened if the judiciary had not demonstrated its independence from the executive. The current government has promised to restore good governance by reinstating the dignity of democratic institutions.\n\nLesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world. However, the country’s economy expanded by 3.0% in 2021, following a 3.1% contraction in 2017. This growth was driven by an increase in services (1.9%) and the secondary sector (7.2%).\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19, per capita income in Lesotho initially declined by 3.9%. However, there was a slight rebound of 0.2% in 2021. The services sector experienced a boost in aggregate demand, particularly in the area of consumer spending. On the other hand, the secondary sector saw a strong recovery, particularly in the construction industry.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the central bank of Lesotho established a facility that offered loans at 0% interest against corporate debt used as collateral. This initiative aimed to mitigate the economic effects of the crisis.\n\nThe inflation rate in Lesotho increased from 5.3% in 2017 to 5.8% in 2021, mainly due to disruptions in the supply chain.\n\nGiven the country’s Human Development Index (HDI) score of 0.514 in 2021 and the Global Gender Gap Index score of 0.7 in 2022, Lesotho still has a long way to go in terms of human development. The current government has made strides in ensuring gender equality and representation in parliament. Former Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara has been appointed as deputy prime minister and minister of justice, law and parliamentary affairs. She is the first woman to have been appointed as deputy prime minister and was also the first woman to be appointed chief justice in Lesotho. This has given more Basotho women hope that their hard work will be noticed as much as that of their male counterparts.\n\nLesotho does not limit investment or disinvestment in the country. Investors are welcome to invest in the country, as there are foreign investors in the mining, textile, banking, retail and other sectors. This approach helps create jobs for Basotho by attracting foreign investments.\n\nAccording to the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC), company registration is conducted at the One-Stop Business Facilitation Center (OBFC) under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Cooperatives and Marketing. The process takes between three and five working days, in accordance with the Companies Act (2011) and the Companies Regulations (2012). There are five steps to follow, including the payment of the incorporation fee. The fee is LSL 530.00 for an internal company and LSL 1,030.00 for an external company, both of which include the LSL 30.00 fee for name reservation.\n\nThe types of companies that can be registered in Lesotho are private companies, public companies and non-profit organizations. Registration can be done either at administration offices or remotely, but since the arrival of COVID-19, more people have used the latter option. There is also an option for agents who assist their clients with the registration process at a fee charged according to their rates.\n\nFor the purpose of tax registration, the registrar shares the information provided for the incorporation of a company with the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) in order to register the company automatically as a taxpayer. The incorporation certificate also serves as confirmation of the tax registration. When the company hires employees, whether domestic or cross-border, they must be registered separately for tax purposes.\n\nPrices adopted by companies are generally market-determined. The major exceptions are petroleum products, electricity and water, whose prices are regulated by the government.\n\nLesotho’s informal economy is estimated to account for 30.9% of economic activity, representing approximately $2 billion at GDP PPP levels. However, it also serves as the largest employer, employing 80% of the population, according to informal employment statistics from the ILO.\n\nTrade liberalization is the removal or reduction of restrictions or barriers to the free exchange of goods between nations. These barriers include tariffs, such as duties and surcharges, and non-tariff barriers, such as licensing rules and quotas. Lesotho has been a beneficiary of liberalized foreign trade, especially due to its commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, Lesotho has not derived any benefits from this, as it has failed to take advantage of the liberalization due to a lack of investment and its small population size.\n\nLesotho is a member of several organizations. One of these is the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), a customs union consisting of five states: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Eswatini. SACU allows its members to engage in duty-free trade among themselves, while jointly applying a common external tariff on imports from other parts of the world. Being a member of SACU, Lesotho gains advantages from the free trade agreements that SACU has established with other countries and trade blocs.\n\nThe country’s other major agreements include the following:\n\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) – Lesotho is a member of the SADC. SADC aims to deepen regional integration and promote sustainable development through a series of four phases: a SADC Free Trade Area (FTA), a customs union, a common market and monetary union. The SADC FTA was fully implemented in 2012 across 12 SADC Member States, achieving maximum tariff liberalization. Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Seychelles are not part of the FTA.\n\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) – Lesotho benefits from AGOA, a unilateral and nonreciprocal program that provides African countries with duty-free access to the U.S. market for over 6,400 products.\n\nThe Cotonou Agreement – Lesotho is part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) – EU Partnership Agreement, which grants nonreciprocal preferential access to the EU market for some ACP products.\n\nUnder the European Union’s “Everything But Arms” (EBA) initiative, Lesotho enjoys quota- and duty-free access to the EU market for everything except arms. Additionally, Lesotho has recently entered into an interim economic partnership agreement, which will provide it with considerably enhanced access to the European Union.\n\nLesotho has ratified the declaration of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nLesotho’s banking system consists of the central bank of Lesotho (CBL) and four commercial banks. The central bank enjoys a considerable amount of independence in formulating and implementing monetary policies. The entity’s governor, who also serves as the chairman of the Board of Directors, along with the two deputy governors, is appointed by the king based on the prime minister’s advice. The minister of finance appoints the remaining board members.\n\nThe CBL is responsible for managing the country’s foreign exchange reserves, administering exchange controls and regulating financial institutions. The CBL also serves as an adviser to the government on financial and macroeconomic issues. The three commercial banks in Lesotho are Standard Lesotho Bank, Ned Bank Lesotho and First National Bank Lesotho, all of which are South African banks.\n\nAccording to the central bank, the bank capital adequacy ratio in Lesotho reached 22.2% in 2021, which is 3.20% lower than the previous year. Historically, the bank capital adequacy ratio in Lesotho reached an all-time high of 23.0% in 2020 and an all-time low of 12.0% in 2008. Lesotho is ranked 22nd among the group of 80 countries in terms of interest on capital reserves.\n\nIn 2021, the share of bank non-performing loans in total gross loans was 4.1%, compared to 4.2% in 2020. In February 2022, this rate rose to 4.3%, and in March 2022, it reached 4.4%.\n\nAccording to the CBL, the banking system in Lesotho is sound. Commercial banks in Lesotho are well capitalized, liquid and compliant with international banking standards. However, the regulatory framework is still based on the Basel I set of regulations, even though three of the four banks in the country are subsidiaries of South African banks, which are already regulated under Basel III.\n\nMonetary stability has in principle been a component of the economic policy mix, but it is in practice subordinated to other objectives. The monetary authority has not been capable of pursuing monetary stabilization independently of the government. The national currency of Lesotho is the maloti, known as the loti in its singular form. Currently, it is valued at 0.054 against the U.S. dollar (LSL 1 = $0.054). The real exchange rate at the end of the review period was $1 to LSL 18.41. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at a 1-1 ratio by the Common Monetary Area, and both currencies are accepted as legal tender in Lesotho.\n\nThe minister of finance in January 2023 provided a summary of the financial status of Lesotho. She highlighted corruption and mismanagement of state resources as the primary factors hindering Lesotho’s economy. It was anticipated that the economy would experience growth of 2.5% in 2022 and 2.8% in 2023, primarily driven by the services and construction sectors. The inflation rate was forecasted to reach 7.6% in 2022, decreasing to 5.9% in 2023, mainly due to a rise in the rate of food price inflation (which fell to 8% in December from 8.10% in November 2022). Based on an expected recovery in Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues (revenue from imports shared among SACU member states), the fiscal deficit was projected to shrink to 4.6% and 3.7% of GDP in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The current account deficit was expected to improve from 6.8% of GDP in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023 as a result of reduced imports. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the current annual real GDP growth rate stands at 1.6%.\n\nThe right to private property is protected under the law. Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP II) addresses job creation through the private sector. It has been determined that the manufacturing and agricultural sectors are the only two sectors that contribute to the economy. The largest sectors aside from these are mining and quarrying, textiles (especially before COVID-19), and financial and insurance activities.\n\nThe pandemic devastated the textile industry in Lesotho. More than 11,000 out of 50,000 workers lost their jobs due to the cancellation of billions of dollars’ worth of orders, as the global fashion industry faced hardships.\n\nPrivatization in Lesotho is guided by the Privatization Act of 1995. Privatization is viewed as a means for Lesotho to achieve economic stability, given the increasing levels of unemployment, and to address the poor management that has led to the failure of government parastatals. Presently, the education and health sectors have been privatized through public-private partnership (PPP) agreements. In Lesotho, schools are owned and operated by various entities, including the government of Lesotho, church organizations, the community and private sector companies. Church-owned schools make up 67% of the total 341 secondary schools. Government schools, community schools and private for-profit schools account for 27%, 4%, and 2% of the sector, respectively. Consequently, 27% of the schools are government/public, while 73% are privately owned, comprising both for-profit and not-for-profit institutions.\n\nThe health-sector privatization agreement between Netcare and the national government has faced challenges. Netcare had been operating the Queen ‘Mamohato Memorial Hospital (QMMH) since 2011 under a 2008 public-private partnership (PPP) agreement, but the two parties have let the agreement lapse. The partnership was in its 13th year of an 18-year contract. Netcare blamed the government for defaulting on payments, while the government accused Netcare of non-compliance.\n\nHIV/AIDS and unemployment have been the primary threats associated with an enhanced need for social protection in Lesotho, with government intervention necessary to address these issues. The fact that the elderly in Lesotho typically care for their grandchildren, who are often HIV/AIDS orphans, results in additional expenses and burdens that further contribute to their vulnerability. The end-of-2022 statistics indicate that Lesotho has the lowest life expectancy level worldwide, at 55.22 years, due to the high prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS. The Department of Social Welfare provides cash transfers to vulnerable groups, including older people who receive noncontributory universal old-age pensions. This assistance also extends to war veterans, orphans, individuals with disabilities and those who suffer from chronic illnesses. However, not everyone has equal access to these grants, as some individuals encounter difficulties in obtaining them due to conflicts with their local chief or councilors.\n\nEducation at the primary level is free, although some parents send their children to private schools because they fear that government schools offer a lower quality of education. Tertiary education is financed through the National Manpower Development Secretariat (NMDS) under the Ministry of Development and Planning. The NMDS provides part loan/part grant financing, a certain portion of which must be paid back.\n\nThe government administers the Public Assistance in Cash and Public Assistance programs for disabled individuals, orphans and vulnerable children. The government has been implementing the National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA), which was initiated in 2010 and has now reached more than 138,000 households. NISSA provides data on vulnerable households in Lesotho as a means of supporting other social safety net programs. In Lesotho, every individual with an income receives a tax credit for earnings below LSL 4,200 per month. This means that the first LSL 50,400 per year is exempt from taxation.\n\nLesotho does not have an unemployment benefit scheme, and as a result, those without jobs tend to fall into poverty.\n\nThe pension scheme is an extension of social protection programs aimed at relieving people from poverty and providing assistance to older individuals who can no longer support themselves. As of 2022, elderly individuals receive a sum of M850, which represents a slight increase compared to when this grant was initially implemented. Additionally, in 2021, following the lockdown, the government expressed gratitude to citizens over 60 years old for a three-month period.\n\nIn recent years, Lesotho’s economic performance has remained very weak, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, political instability has also contributed to the weak economy, resulting in a 9.4% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021, which was calculated at $1,094.10 million. Economic activity picked up in 2022 by 2.6%; however, it is expected to slow down in 2023 before accelerating by 2.9% in 2024, as the Lesotho Highlights Water Project Phase-II reaches its highest point. The inflation rate is projected to be 7.6% in 2022 and 5.9% in 2023, driven by an increase in food price inflation (it decreased to 8% in December from 8.10% in November 2022).\n\nIn 2022, economic performance showed some recovery, with sectors including mining, manufacturing, business services and public services showing the highest growth rates.\n\nThe Lesotho budget remained in deficit for the period under review, with a shortfall equivalent to 6.2% of GDP in 2022. Imports remain expensive, and exports have fallen due to declining global prices of diamonds. Another sector expected to initiate development is agriculture, boosted by subsidies for key resources such as seeds and fertilizers for farmers. These subsidies help farmers maximize their commercial sales, improving business and consumer confidence – especially after the challenging times of the pandemic.\n\nSome improvement is also expected from the strong development in the mining sector, coupled with an enhanced market outlook for diamonds and the present increase in commodity prices. Production has returned to full scale after the lockdowns, and it is expected that most mines that were under care and maintenance in 2021 will contribute to advancing the sector’s performance. The recovery in 2021 was very limited; therefore, poverty levels are estimated to have continued at 36% in 2022. Other factors, including increasing food prices, a high unemployment rate, a high job loss rate and high death rates, have hindered poverty reduction efforts in the country.\n\nThe government enacted the National Environment Act in 2001 and introduced the National Adaptation Program of Action in 2007. This aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 10% through 2030. The Institute of Natural Resources has undertaken a USAID-funded project to enhance the capacities of local communities to adapt to climate change impacts.\n\nThere is a significant problem of severe land degradation caused by overgrazing and soil erosion, which leads to limited access to arable land and undermines food production. These factors have huge negative effects on the food supply.\n\nThe environmental sector is said to be one of the indicators of growth in Lesotho, as huge projects are supposed to undergo impact assessments for both the private and public sectors. However, there has been a lack of coordination between the ministries of mining and the environment. According to the Environmental Act of 2008, all projects should be assessed before they begin; however, the state and private companies have not followed this protocol over the years. The ministers from the mining and environmental sectors do not work together to enhance development and collaboration between the sectors.\n\nIn 2022, Minister of Mining Serialong Qoo announced the Mines and Mineral Amendment Act of 2022, which states that small-scale mining should be legalized. He pointed out that this type of mining contributes a substantial amount of government revenue, and said he expects to collect LSL 500 billion from the mining sector annually. However, the mining sector performed well from 2021 to 2022 after becoming very strict about issuing licenses for individuals or private companies interested in mineral exploration in Lesotho. The sector requires the application to be sent to the mining council through the mining commissioner. Overall, this licensing for exploration has advanced the production of minerals in Lesotho and will sustain the economy in the long run. There are no other new regulations that exist outside the environmental and mining sector acts that regulate the environment.\n\nLesotho is a landlocked country in South Africa, with 10 districts. Factors such as the high inflation rate in South Africa have spillover effects on Lesotho’s economy. This is evidenced by economic fluctuations, such as inflation rates, that follow similar trends. One of the most significant challenges currently facing Lesotho is human trafficking and forced labor, which disproportionately affects women and children, making them the most vulnerable groups. Human trafficking is largely driven by the high unemployment rate, as many people leave Lesotho in search of better opportunities but end up becoming victims instead. Poverty also contributes significantly to this vulnerability, as around 80.52% of the population lived in rural areas in 2022. These individuals primarily rely on crop production for both subsistence and commercial farming. However, changing climatic conditions have severely reduced agricultural production in recent years. Consequently, this has become a driving force for many rural residents to migrate, often resulting in their victimization due to this form of cruelty.\n\nSome individuals find themselves without employment opportunities, leading them to become sex workers. This situation has contributed to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. According to UNAIDS (2022), Lesotho has an HIV prevalence rate of 24.6%. UNAIDS reported that there was an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100-person-year exposure; however, this rate has decreased due to increased understanding and utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which resulted in a 92% suppression of viral loads. The country actively promotes HIV/AIDS education and programs, with a particular focus on younger age groups. Additionally, an unequal distribution of resources poses a significant obstacle to Lesotho’s development. Those in power exercise control over the country’s resources and often utilize them for personal gain.\n\nThe social and economic fabric of Lesotho has been negatively affected by the effects of COVID-19. The strict lockdown measures and numerous restrictions have had a significant impact on the livelihoods of many people. Numerous small businesses were forced to close, while a large number of individuals working in the informal sector lost their jobs. The coronavirus pandemic has had far-reaching effects that have destroyed households. Many children lost their parents, resulting in more orphans and many child-headed households.\n\nSeventy-two percent of citizens support the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Lesotho, which will investigate and come up with recommendations on past political crimes and violations of human rights. While the people want reconciliation, they also would like people who committed crimes because of political motives to be held accountable. The end of the year 2022 also brought a successful 42nd summit of the SADC heads of state. The group urged the government of Lesotho to encourage its citizens to live peacefully and transition to a good nation. There was civil war after 1993, when the country started being a democratic nation, but there are key bodies that bring order to society. The soldiers always intervene where there are fights, and SADC always intervenes where the government can no longer handle the affairs on its own. In general, the leaders have failed to establish courts of law that enable victims of injustices to be at the center of reconciliation. The main goal for the government of Lesotho is always to punish perpetrators accordingly, but little or nothing at all has been done to address the victims. Many parties advocate for reconciliation when government officials and high-profile people are involved in cases that remain difficult to solve. It has become a norm for cases not to be solved or even to be withdrawn when a new leader takes office. Sometimes they just use emotions and revenge to charge people who are not their party followers.\n\nPolitical leaders seldom concentrate on reconciliation; rather, they take advantage of the divide in the community instead of building an environment that stimulates reconciliation. For example, historical injustices are used to divide the population along political lines rather than unite the people. However, the new strain of political parties is more inclined to reconcile divergent ideologies, arguing that “we were not there when the atrocities happened, and we cannot change the past; rather, we can make the future be what we want.” This is why the new political parties actually mobilize large numbers.\n\nThe government of Lesotho has been able to attract enormous support from international partners through a consultative national reform process. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has worked with all stakeholders in Lesotho to address recurring conflicts caused by weak institutions, inadequate laws and political interference within the security forces, among other things.\n\nThe international community demonstrated a willingness to support Lesotho during the period under review. Development partners have committed to supporting the implementation of the second National Strategic Development Plan. Furthermore, the U.S. government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation has also considered Lesotho to be eligible to receive funding under the second compact of the Millennium Challenge Account. The international community has demonstrated unwavering support for the government of Lesotho in addressing the security challenges by offering training to the armed forces and providing financial support for the implementation of the constitutional and institutional reform programs. The government also enjoys massive support from the Japanese government for its education programs, the European Union and United Nations for its social safety nets, and the U.S. government for HIV/AIDS programs.\n\nLesotho maintains strong diplomatic ties with several nations, including the Republic of Ireland, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany and other Western states. The Republic of Ireland serves as a major bilateral donor to Lesotho, while the United States provides aid and assists in the establishment of non-governmental organizations that create numerous employment opportunities and generate significant revenue for the country. Additionally, South Africa and Lesotho have collaborated on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), a large-scale endeavor focused on water supply and hydropower. This project has been instrumental in generating substantial royalties for Lesotho, estimated at $15 million annually, and has also created employment opportunities for many individuals within the country.\n\nLesotho has economic plans that can help it recover in the post-COVID-19 era, improving the livelihoods of many. One such plan is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project Phase (II), scheduled to begin in 2022. This project will have numerous benefits, including reducing the high unemployment rate by providing jobs for both skilled and unskilled laborers across various sectors. Additionally, the project will increase the country’s revenue and improve its gross domestic product. If sustained, this could also lead to a reduction in poverty, as it will enhance many households’ incomes and bring about significant economic transformation.\n\nThe tourism industry holds considerable promise in helping Lesotho develop its economy. The neighboring country, South Africa, agreed in January 2022 to ease the movement of people between the two countries. According to the agreement, Lesotho citizens will be allowed to stay in South Africa for up to 90 days without any penalties. This will facilitate movement and also assist travelers from South Africa who wish to tour Lesotho. This introduction aims to assist individuals who are unable to afford the Lesotho Special Permit (LSP), which was introduced to support Basotho working in the informal sectors of South Africa, such as domestic workers. Domestic tourism also plays a significant role in driving the economy, and Lesotho is currently experiencing substantial growth in this industry. The government is diligently working to advance and promote it.\n\nThe National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) also identifies the agricultural sector as a key driver of economic development in Lesotho. The goal is to assist and support small farmers in accessing a market that is free from competition from neighboring countries. The government has implemented tariffs that restrict the importation of certain products that can be domestically produced in Lesotho. This policy aims to bolster local farmers, enabling them to export their products and generate profits.\n\nOne element hindering growth is the high corruption rate in the country. For a long time, those in power have been misusing resources by channeling them in the wrong direction and using them for personal gain. This involves high levels of nepotism, where skilled and qualified candidates do not even make it to the shortlisting stage in hiring processes. The national reforms are expected to drive the economy in a positive direction."
