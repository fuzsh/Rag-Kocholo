        "text": "Politics of Lesotho takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy, whereby the Prime Minister of Lesotho is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of Parliament, the Senate and the National Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nMain office-holders Office Name Party Since King Letsie III 7 February 1996 Prime Minister Sam Matekane Revolution for Prosperity 28 October 2022\n\nThe Lesotho Government is a constitutional monarchy. The Prime Minister, Sam Matekane, is head of government and has executive authority. The King serves a largely ceremonial function; he no longer possesses any executive authority and is proscribed from actively participating in political initiatives. According to the constitution, the leader of the majority party in the assembly automatically becomes prime minister; the monarch is hereditary, but, under the terms of the constitution which came into effect after the March 1993 election, the monarch is a \"living symbol of national unity\" with no executive or legislative powers; under traditional law the college of chiefs has the power to determine who is next in the line of succession, who shall serve as regent in the event that the successor is not of mature age, and may even depose the monarch.\n\nParliament has two chambers. The National Assembly has 120 members, elected for a five-year term, 80 in single-seat constituencies and 40 by proportional representation. The Senate has 33 nominated members.\n\nFor other political parties, see List of political parties in Lesotho. An overview on elections and election results is included in Elections in Lesotho.\n\nMain article: 2022 Lesotho general election\n\nThe elections were postponed in the Stadium Area constituency following the death of the Basotholand Total Liberation Congress candidate.\n\nThe ruling All Basotho Convention lost all its constituency seats, including that of party leader Nkaku Kabi.[1] Although the Democratic Congress party ran its campaign opposing the ABC, the party's recent support for the coalition government allowed the new Revolution for Prosperity (RFP) party to seem more credible as a new start.[2]\n\n2\n\n1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n29\n\n5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n57\n\n8\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPartyVotes%SeatsFPTPListTotal+/–Revolution for Prosperity201,47838.8957057NewDemocratic Congress128,51724.81181129–1All Basotho Convention37,8097.30088–40Basotho Action Party29,2855.65066NewAlliance of Democrats20,8434.02235–4Movement for Economic Change17,2813.34134–2Lesotho Congress for Democracy12,3262.38033–8Socialist Revolutionaries10,7382.07112NewBasotho National Party7,3671.42011–4Popular Front for Democracy4,6550.90011–2Mpulule Political Summit4,4850.87011NewBasotho Covenant Movement4,1170.79011NewHOPE – Mphatlalatsane3,7170.72011NewNational Independent Party3,7040.711010Basotho Patriotic Party3,2010.62000NewUnited for Change2,9400.57000NewLesotho People's Congress2,0750.400000Alliance for Free Movement2,0020.39000NewBasutoland Congress Party1,9110.37000–1Reformed Congress of Lesotho1,8090.35000–1Marematlou Freedom Party1,7670.34000–1Basotho Liberation Movement1,5300.30000NewBasotho Democratic Congress1,1670.23000NewBasotho Democratic National Party1,1650.220000Lesotho Economic Freedom1,1530.22000NewBasotho Economic Enrichment1,0760.21000NewBasotho Total Liberation Congress8880.17000NewKhothalang Basotho8280.16000NewAfrican Unity Movement7500.140000Your Opportunity and Network Alliance7190.14000NewLekhotla la Mekhoa le Meetlo5790.110000Basotho Social Party5570.11000NewMetsi and Natural Resources Party5330.10000NewBasotho Poverty Solution Party4720.09000NewBahlabani ba Tokoloho Movement4680.09000NewDevelopment Party for All4690.09000NewBasutholand African National Congress4460.090000Revolutionary Alliance of Democracy4320.08000NewTsepo Ea Basotho4230.08000NewAfrican Ark3440.07000NewBasotho Council for Economic Freedom3020.06000NewBasotho Redevelopment Party2880.06000NewEmpowerment Movement for Basotho2820.05000NewMookoli Theological Front2640.05000NewYearn for Economic Sustainability2310.04000NewPeople's Convention2250.04000NewAllies for Patriotic Change1950.04000NewPrayer Shawl and Light1180.02000NewIndependents1230.020000Total518,054100.0080401200Valid votes518,05498.74Invalid/blank votes6,5941.26Total votes524,648100.00Registered voters/turnout1,388,11737.80Source: IEC\n\nThe constitution provides for an independent hierarchical judicial system. The judiciary is made up of the High Court of Lesotho, the Court of Appeal, magistrate's courts, and traditional (customary) courts which exist predominantly in rural areas. There is no trial by jury; rather, judges make rulings alone, or, in the case of criminal trials, with two other judges as observers. The constitution also protects basic civil liberties, including freedom of speech, association, and the press; freedom of peaceful assembly; and freedom of religion.[3]\n\nThe Court of Appeal is located in Maseru and consists of a President and 6 justices of Appeal.\n\nThe High Court has unlimited original jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters, as well as appellate jurisdiction from the lower courts and comprises a Chief Justice and other puisne judges. Parallel to the High Court is the Labour Court, which is a specialist court dealing exclusively with industrial and labour matters.\n\nMagistrates Courts are presided over by judicial officers (magistrates) employed as civil servants. They are not courts of record and as such their decisions are not binding on future cases.\n\nThe Chief Justice and Justices of the Court of Appeal are appointed by the King on the advice of the Prime Minister. Puisne judges of the High Court are appointed by the King on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. High Court judges may retire any time after attaining the age of 75 but may be removed from office by the King for malfeasance or infirmity.\n\nChief Justices\n\n1937-1948 Sir Walter Huggard (British)\n\n1950-1952 Sir Walter Harragin (British)\n\n1952-1956 Harold Curwen Willan (British)\n\n1959-1961 Cox (British)\n\n1961-1962 Elyan (British)\n\n1962-1965 Watkin Williams (British)\n\n1965-1966 Benson (British)\n\n1966-1968 Johnston\n\n1968–1973 Hendrik Rudolf Jacobs (South African)\n\n1974–1975 Joas Tseliso Mapetla\n\n1976–1986 Taufik Suliman Cotran (afterwards Chief Justice of Belize, 1986)\n\n1986–1993 Peter Brendan Cullinan\n\n<1994–2002 Joseph Lebona Kheola\n\n2002–2013 Mahapela Lehohla\n\n2004 Baptista Molai (acting)\n\n2013 Tseliso Monaphathi (acting)\n\n2014-2018 Nthomeng Majara\n\n2020-Present Sakoane Peter Sakoane\n\nFor administrative purposes, Lesotho is divided into 10 districts, each headed by a district secretary and a district military officer appointed by the central government and the RLDF, respectively.
