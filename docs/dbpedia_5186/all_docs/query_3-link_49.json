        "text": "Lesotho is a largely underdeveloped and landlocked mountainous country, enclaved within South Africa. The political and security environments have been susceptible to sporadic and sudden bouts of deterioration since the late 1990s stemming from rivalries between the main political actors and split allegiances among security forces. Stability prospects have improved in recent years, although the fractious political landscape and tensions between the army and police remain enduring flashpoints for further unrest. Lesotho is open to foreign investment and has created conducive conditions, particularly in manufacturing plants and agricultural projects, although there are concerns over the country's regulatory framework, corruption and property law. The primary threats facing foreign travelers are from criminal activity, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and road traffic collisions. Infrastructure is poor throughout the country and remains a significant obstacle to economic development and travel.\n\nThe primary threats facing foreign travelers are from criminal activity, especially in urban centers. Opportunistic crime such as pickpocketing, mugging and petty theft is relatively common in the capital Maseru, and criminals have been known to target foreign travelers. Car-jackings have also occasionally been reported, particularly on the outskirts of urban centers and near border crossings.\n\nLesotho has a history of politically-motivated unrest, and spontaneous protests occasionally occur in Maseru. However, rallies are typically small and non-violent and are unlikely to pose a direct threat to foreign interests.\n\nAviation in Lesotho conforms to international safety standards. Most flights into the country are provided by reputable South Africa-based operators.\n\nOverland travel in Lesotho can be hazardous due to the poor driving standards of some local road users and the widespread use of poorly-maintained vehicles, including busses.\n\nElectricity and communications infrastructure is generally adequate in Maseru, but service provision is unreliable outside of urban centers.\n\nAdequate essential health services are available nationwide. However, rural locations have limited access to these services. Cash payment upfront is required even with healthcare insurance. Insect- and vector-borne diseases like Crimean hemorrhagic fever are a risk year-round. Specialized treatment would require medical evacuation to South Africa. Water sources are generally unreliable, and all food needs to be cooked thoroughly.\n\nLesotho's political environment has been susceptible to sporadic and sudden bouts of deterioration since the late 1990s, stemming from rivalries between the main political actors and split allegiances among security forces. Stability prospects have improved in recent years, although the fractious political landscape and tensions between the army and police remain enduring flashpoints for further instability.\n\nCorruption remains a significant problem in Lesotho, although the government has launched efforts to tackle the issue in recent years. There have also been questions over the judicial independence in the country, with some verdicts being subject to political interference."
