        "text": "WHY, I'LL PROVE TO YOU THAT WE HAVE SHOWN OURSELVES THE BEST TROOPS IN THE WORLD. Didnt the French beat the troops of every other continental nation? Didnt you beat the French in the Peninsula? And havent we beat you just now? Thus spoke an American officer to a British officer after the Battle of New Orleans[1]. This battle on January 8, 1815, electrified the young United States, giving the new nation a dizzying surge of self-confidence, inspiring it to expand from sea to sea and to emerge as the leading world power. Ironically, the basis for this inspiration was at best a half-truth and at worst a myth.\n\nLike the American officer, the rest of the U.S. crowed in triumph after New Orleans because they thought they had defeated the finest army in Europe. For six years, the Duke of Wellingtons Peninsular Army had defeated Napoleons heretofore invincible battalions in every battle. Then they finally met the Hunters of Kentucky and were not only defeated, but utterly trounced. In a matter of minutes, the British were thrown back with a devastating 1,955 casualties, starkly contrasted with 13 American losses[2]. Glowing with pride, Congressman George Troup exalted the farmers of the country triumphantly victorious over the conquerors of the conquerors of Europe.[3] Andrew Jackson himself certainly basked in the glory, writing, I have defeated this Boasted army of Lord Wellington[4]. If simple, untrained American frontiersmen could more than match the best troops Europe had to offer, what other wonders was this new nation capable of?\n\nOr so the story went. Much of Sir Edward Pakenhams army at New Orleans had served under Wellington in Portugal, Spain, and France. Careful analysis, however, reveals that the British defeat did not stem from any inadequacy in the Peninsular veterans, but from a regiment that had not served with Wellington at all.\n\nMany historians love to write of New Orleans as the triumph of the underdog, but in actuality, Jackson enjoyed a formidable position on the East Bank of the Mississippi on January 8. His men enjoyed a sturdy line of earthworks fronted by the Rodriguez Canal and anchored with a wooded swamp on its left and the river on its right. Any approach would have to cover 2,000 yards of open ground under the fire of fourteen cannon and howitzers, many of them heavy ordinance[5]. The sloop Louisiana guarded the river itself, and on the West Bank waited an additional battery of sixteen pieces of artillery for enfilade fire[6]. The American guns also enjoyed better protection behind their earthworks than the Royal Artillerys, and they were more securely positioned. The Americans had cotton bales to situate their cannons on, while the British had to drag their guns through mud with every shot. They were low on horses and even carriages for the artillery, using naval carriages instead, which impaired accuracy on land[7].\n\nPortrait of Andrew Jackson painted in 1823 wearing his 1815 coat (New York City Collection)\n\nThe British did have a numerical advantage. By exactly how much seems debatable, but it was not overwhelming. Most historians agree that only 5,400 soldiers or so actually made the attack on January 8th. As historians generally reckon Jacksons own strength at almost 4,000 on the East Bank, this small margin could hardly cancel out the strong American defenses and heavy artillery[8].\n\nThe situation for the British, therefore, looked grim, but not for Peninsular veterans. The Peninsular Army had fought the savage Battle of Albuera on May 16, 1811. At its end, in William Napiers memorable phrase, Fifteen hundred unwounded men, the remnant of six thousand unconquerable British soldiers, stood triumphant on the fatal hill![9] This army had also stormed Badajoz, infamous for the ferocity of the French fire and the horrid ingenuity of their booby traps.\n\nPakenham knew he faced long odds, so he devised an intricate plan, perhaps too intricate. Using boats that the Royal Navy would bring into the Mississippi via a canal from the British-held bayous, a detachment of sailors, Marines, and the 85th would storm the enfilading batteries on the West Bank at bayonet-point under cover of night. Then, with dawn approaching, the British would assault the East Bank line in two columns. The left column, composed of the Light Companies of the 7th, 21st, and 43rd and the full strength of the 93rd Highlanders, would assault the Americans where Jacksons line met the Mississippi and was fronted by an advance redoubt. The main assault column on the right would strike close to the swamp, with half of the 44th leading, followed by the 21st and then the 4th. To deal with the canal and the earthwork, Pakenham tasked the other half of the 44th under Colonel Thomas Mullins with carrying fascines to fill in part of the ditch and ladders to scale the ramparts[10].\n\nPortrait of Lieutenant General Sir Edward Pakenham, 1814.\n\nThat morning, the British assault devolved into a comedy of errors played out under the rapidly firing guns of Jackson and his men. Due to delays with the boats, the West Bank detachment did not take the enfilading batteries in time. Worried for the fire on his left flank now, Pakenham diverted the 93rd Highlanders from the left column to cross the field and join the right column. As they did, they masked the British batteries and took devastating fire into their flank from Jacksons line[11].\n\nWorst of all was Mullinss criminal negligence, for which he would be court-martialed and cashiered[12]. Although specifically ordered to confirm the location of the vital ladders and fascines prior to the assault, Mullins marched his 44th Regiment past the redoubt where they were stored. He then waited for some time at the head of the column without bothering to fetch them until ordered back to do so. By the time the other troops were in position and the rocket signaled the advance, the ladders and fascines had still not reached the head of the column, and their commander had vanished.[13] When first fired upon, the half of the 44th leading the advance stopped and returned fire, rather than pressing on with their task. This proved a hopeless contest, as the Americans fired over the parapet without even showing their faces. The British column came to a confused standstill and in short order was decimated. Both halves of the 44th then broke and ran, having no doubt become unnerved by their commanders actions and the resulting disorder[14]. The 93rd, when it arrived at the right column, had nothing to cross the ditch with, and valiantly stood like statues[15] awaiting orders that could never come, as by this time the American fire had all but obliterated the British officer corps. In their march across the field and valiant but doomed stand, the 93rd sustained more than 50% casualties[16].\n\nBritish advancing with ladders towards American positions (published 1815)\n\nBritish accounts blame a number of factors for the disaster, but the three that seem to surface the most are the delay of the 85ths attack, Mullins failure to provide the ladders and fascines, and the 44ths halting to fire. The fascines and ladders never reached the works, and the pause proved futile and disastrous. As a commentator in the United Service Journal noted, One minute would have brought the assailants to the ditch; but in ten minutes halt the firing of the skulking democrats did its work murderously[17]. Staff officer Harry Smith said, Had our heaviest column rushed forward in place of halting to fire under a fire fifty times superior, our national honor would not have been tarnished[18].\n\nWhile the fault for Thorntons delay lay with the engineers in charge of the canal to convey the boats to the river, the latter two errors would probably not have happened with Peninsular regiments. Accounts of the storming of Badajoz speak of the dash and resolution with which the storming divisions drove their ladders right up to the ditch and walls[19]. In contrast, the 44ths pause so disrupted the attack that to William Surtees of the 95th, watching from the rear, the British never made it to the earthwork, even though several British accounts do relate how some men reached the position[20].\n\nPeninsular veterans like Harry Smith (95th Rifles), William Surtees (95th), and George Gleig (85th Light Infantry) comment with disgust on Mullinss sulkiness the night before the assault, how he grumbled that his regiment was being sacrificed as a forlorn hope instead of basking in the glory of the trust placed in him as the men at Badajoz had done[21]. For Peninsula men, the Forlorn Hope was a position of honor. Edward Costello of the 95th remembered a comrade named Burke who volunteered for and, miraculously, survived the Forlorn Hopes at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and San Sebastian[22]. Surtees wrote in his memoirs that, Had the commanding-officer of the 44th served in the Peninsula under our illustrious leader there, he would, I am confident, have been animated by a quite different spirit[23].\n\nRifleman firing a Baker Rifle from a lying position (1804). The 95th Rifles used this firearm at New Orleans.\n\nAs the assault dissolved into chaos, the proud Peninsular veterans mostly waited in the rear. Three companies from the famed 95th Rifles, who had been with Wellington, led the column as skirmishers and even tried cutting steps in the American works to scale them, but they were clearly not the weight of the attack. Two of the finest Peninsular regiments, the 43rd and the 7th, were specifically held in reserve and never fired until the order finally came to retreat, at which time they still looked to Smith of the 95th as ready for anything and to Cooke of the 43rd as cool as cucumbers and covered the retreat valiantly[24]. Unlike the 44th, the portions of the 43rd and the 7th that did engage the Americans, namely the Light Companies in the left assault column, actually pressed home their attack and took the advance American redoubt. Had Pakenham left the 93rd Highlanders in that column, they might have turned Jacksons flank[25]. John Cooper with the 7th thought that keeping the 43rd and his regiment in reserve was certainly a grand mistake, for the troops in front were composed of [ ] corps that had not been employed in sieges, etc., as we had in Spain[26]. John Cooke of the 43rd remembered seeing the Peninsular veterans in the 95th and the decimated remnants of the Light Companies of the 7th and 43rd reforming to cover the retreat, in the Light Companies case after enduring 75% casualties (as at Albuera)[27]. The 4th Foot, another Peninsular regiment, was at the rear of the right column instead of leading it[28]. The only British success for the day came with the belated attack of the 85th Light Infantry, a Peninsular regiment, which routed the Americans on the West Bank and captured the enfilading battery after the attack on the East Bank had already failed.\n\nMost of the blame for the disaster, it can be seen, lies with the 44th, which leads to some confusion among historians. The basic British tactical unit was the battalion rather than the regiment. British regiments would often have more than one battalion, and usually they did not serve together. The 2nd Battalion of the 44th won great glory under Wellington, seeing fierce action at Badajoz, capturing a French Eagle at Salamanca, and, after New Orleans, fighting at Waterloo. It was the 1st Battalion, however, that botched the attack at New Orleans. Despite having the battle honor of Peninsula, it was not actually one of Wellingtons regiments, being part of Lord William Bentincks army in eastern Spain at the close of the war[29]. The next regiment in the column, the 21st Fusiliers, had likewise technically served in the Peninsula, but not under Wellington either[30]. Peninsular veteran Harry Smith recounted his annoyance at men from the 44th and 21st who proved sulky when he needed them to retrieve the cannons that had been used on January 1st and who would not move them until he brought Pakenham himself to oversee them. He observed, Neither the 21st nor the 44th were distinguished for discipline-certainly not of the sort I had been accustomed to[31]. Lieutenant Leavock (21st) likewise became infuriated at them during the main assault when he reached the top of the rampart to find himself deserted by the 44th and the 21st: Conceive my indignation on looking round to find that the two leading regiments had vanished as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up[32]. Leavock also claimed that the Kentuckians were likewise retreating from the works except for the two officers who captured him, which, if true, would mean that Jackson was lucky indeed that Pakenham did not lead off with the 43rd and 7th. Gleig and Cooke showed the most generosity towards the 44th, Gleig blaming their failure almost entirely on Mullinss abysmal leadership and Cooke blaming the engineers for not directing the ladder party[33].\n\n93rd Highlanders with 7th and 43rd Regiments at the Battle of New Orleans\n\n(painting by Don Troiani - image not hosted here - external content Buy print here)\n\nOne-fourth of the British casualties were sustained by the 93rd Highlanders, who proved their bravery by standing in ranks despite the devastating fire. They were not a Peninsula regiment, however, and Cooper of the 7th remembers how the Peninsular regiments the 43rd and 7th behind them advanced to within musket shot; but the balls flew so thickly that we were ordered to lay down to avoid the shower[34]. Had the 93rd done this, as Wellington had his men do at Waterloo six months later, their casualty list might not have been so devastating.\n\nWe will never know if the British attack would have succeeded had Pakenham put his Peninsular regiments in front. All British accounts attest to the ferocity of the American fire that day. Smith had seen Badajoz but still deemed the fire at New Orleans the most murderous I ever beheld before or since[35]. That fire all but annihilated the British officer corps, and Jackson had men in reserve to plug any breakthrough[36]. On the other hand, the Peninsular Army had carried the day with even higher percentages of casualties and almost as heavy losses of officers at Albuera, and the British expressed surprise that Jackson did not pursue his broken foe, attributing it to his glimpsing the resolution of the 43rd and 7th in the rearguard, still ready for anything[37]. Certainly the battle would have been much less one-sided. The Peninsular veterans and their officers in the 43rd and 7th would almost certainly have brought the fascines and ladders and pressed the attack home and over the wall.\n\nThe British disaster at New Orleans encouraged the United States to think that, if they could defeat Wellingtons Invincibles, they could defeat anyone on earth. What a lot of historians, even careful ones, miss is that the troops that faltered, failed, and doomed the assault, the 44th and its dispirited commander, Mullins, had not served under Wellington. Indeed, Peninsular veterans said that Mullins and the 44th behaved in a most un-Peninsular manner. Most of the troops who engaged the Americans were not the proud veterans of Wellingtons well-disciplined and battle-hardened army that had stormed Badajoz and done miracles on the battlefields of Portugal, Spain, and France. If they had been, the battle might have turned out quite differently.\n\nAndrew Jackson etching (pub. 1815)\n\n[1] Quoted in William Surtees, Twenty-Five Years in the Rifle Brigade (1833, repr., Coppell, TX: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016), 186.\n\n[2] Robin Reilly, The British at the Gates: The New Orleans Campaign in The War of 1812 (New York: G.
