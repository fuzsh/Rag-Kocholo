The Submarine formerly belonged to the People's Liberation Army Navy. It was captured in immaculate condition from the coast of Washington D.C. Formerly wanted for scrap. It was President Eden who kept it with it's minimum crew. As it was nimble enough to get through many small waterways. It was sent to Chicago with survivors from Raven Rock."
