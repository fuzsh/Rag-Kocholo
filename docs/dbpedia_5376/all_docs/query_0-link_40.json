Introduction\n\nOne iconic moment in the War of 1812 is perpetually remembered in the United States. It is rekindled at the beginning of every sports game, as players and fans stand to hear the Star Spangled Banner. The words to this song were penned by Francis Scott Key, an American lawyer, on the morning of September 14, 1814. He had spent the night aboard a British ship in the Chesapeake Bay, watching the British fleet bombard Fort McHenry with “a sheet of fire and brimstone.” When the smoke cleared in the morning, he saw the huge American flag still flying above the fort, indicating that the Americans had not surrendered. Elated, he wrote his patriotic poem to the tune of an English drinking song. Within weeks, the Baltimore Patriot printed it under the title, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” More than a century later, on March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed a congressional act making “The Star Spangled Banner” the official national anthem of the United States.\n\nRemembering the War of 1812\n\nThe War of 1812 is popularly remembered in the United States as a war to defend American rights and honor on the high seas and, later in the war, to protect American cities such as Baltimore and New Orleans from British attacks. It is also known as “the second American war of independence,” in which Americans stood up to the powerful British empire and gained a new sense of national pride and international respect.\n\nIt is said that the victors write history, but in this case, it was the victorious political party, the Democratic Republicans, that wrote this heroic account of the war. This is the party that agitated for war, pursued it through the Madison administration, and promoted a “mission accomplished” history of it in its aftermath. President James Madison fashioned the message just after the peace treaty was signed, telling the world that the war had been “necessary,” its conduct had been a “success,” and the American people had supported it:\n\nThe late war, although reluctantly declared by Congress, had become a necessary resort to assert the rights and independence of the nation. It has been waged with a success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public spirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval forces of the country.”[1]\n\nMadison’s partisan account has been carried forward into popular American history, overriding the views of the opposition party (Federalists), antiwar dissidents, and other governments. Scholarly accounts, of course, offer a more complex analysis of the issues, but many American accounts nonetheless elevate the claims of the White House over other views and secure those claims in the annals of history. “As a result of the war,” writes Robert P. Watson in America’s First Crisis: The War of 1812 (2014), “a nation emerged on the world stage stronger, more confident, and more united.”[2]\n\nIn fact, American citizens were sorely divided over this war. Not one of the 42 Federalists members of Congress voted to authorize the war in June 1812. Nor did one-fourth of Democratic Republicans in the House of Representatives, who either abstained or voted against the war. According to the historian Charles DeBenedetti, “Domestic opposition to the War of 1812 was as vehement and widespread as any in American history.”[3] The dissenters argued that the war was unnecessary, dishonorable, and ruinous to the nation. It was unnecessary because the British had not attacked the United States and because compromise was still possible. It was dishonorable because the Madison administration was intent on attacking America’s peaceful neighbor to the north, British Canada, and perhaps annexing it. It was potentially ruinous because Great Britain could blockade American ports and attack vulnerable east coast cities and towns – which indeed happened as the war progressed. The U.S. began the war on the offensive and ended it on the defensive. The American historian Donald Hickey offers this sober assessment of the outcome of the war:\n\nFar from bringing the enemy to terms, the nation [United States] was lucky to escape without making extensive concessions itself. The Treaty of Ghent (which ended the conflict) said nothing about the maritime issues that had caused the war and contained nothing to suggest that America had achieved its aims. Instead, it merely provided for returning to the status quo ante bellum – the state that had existed before the war.[4]\n\nTo Canadians, the War of 1812 was clearly a war of aggression on the part of the United States, evident in the fact that the Americans invaded Canada and the British Canadians and their First Nation (Indian) allies defended it. The American assault on York, the capital of Upper Canada, on April 27, 1813, is particularly remembered, its memorabilia on display at the Fort York museum in Toronto:\n\nThe outnumbered defenders fought for six hours before retreating east to Kingston. American forces occupied Toronto for six days, took supplies, looted private property, abused townspeople, and torched Parliament Buildings and lieutenant-governor’s house. A year later, when British forces captured Washington, they burnt the Congress and White House in retaliation.[5]\n\nFrom the British point of view, the War of 1812 was an unwelcome diversion from the main event of the era, the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, which Great Britain and its allies eventually won. As the British historian Jon Latimer writes, “For Britain the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars were wars of national survival and the war in America an irritating distraction.”[6] While Americans recall British depredations on the high seas and the burning of Washington in August 1814, the British remember that Americans supplied Napoleon with $15 million through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which Napoleon used to initiate a new round of military campaigns in Europe (and threatened to invade Great Britain); and that the U.S. took advantage of British vulnerability in 1812 to launch an invasion of its North American colony – the equivalent of hitting a man when he’s down. While British historians recognize that Great Britain had its own imperial interests in securing British trade advantages and limiting American expansionism, most argue that responsibility for the war lay with the Americans.[7]\n\nNative American viewpoints are less prevalent in the historical literature on the War of 1812 but nevertheless significant. More than twenty First Nations took up arms against the United States, while a few segments of tribes fought with the U.S. The war is generally viewed as part of a larger struggle to stem the tide of U.S. “western expansionism” at a time when this seemed possible. Shawnee leader Tecumseh is regarded as a hero for his attempt to unite the diverse Indian nations and create a common Indian Territory in the Trans-Appalachian region. The Canadian government honors the First Nations for without their help Canada would most likely have fallen to the U.S. invaders.[8]\n\nThe 200th anniversary of the War of 1812 provided an opportunity for historians to discuss their different perspectives and to investigate new dimensions of the war. Between 2000 and 2015, well over one hundred scholarly books were published on the War of 1812. This commendable outpouring of scholarship nevertheless produced no consensus as to whether the war was necessary and just.\n\nWas the War of 1812 a necessary and just war?\n\nWas there reasonable and legitimate cause for the War of 1812? This question logically leads to the philosophical question of what is a just war. Is war to be regarded as a duel between nations, where an insult to one’s honor is enough to justify a shooting match to the death? Should war be accepted as a legitimate method for pursuing national economic and political goals, such as territorial and trade expansion? Or is war justifiable only in self-defense, permissible when a nation is attacked? Historians, on the whole, have tended to avoid this line of questioning, preferring to approach each war idiosyncratically, without a clear or common set of moral standards for judging the conduct of nations. Nonetheless, the narrow standard of self-defense is arguably the most appropriate, as it conforms to both domestic legal principles and modern international law, which ban aggression but allow for self-defense.[9]\n\nIn justifying the War of 1812, U.S. leaders made the case that British actions were of sufficient offense as to require war. President James Madison presented his arguments in a message to Congress on June 1, 1812. He charged that the British Royal Navy had impressed thousands of American sailors, in effect kidnapping them and forcing them to crew Royal Navy ships; that the British had repeatedly harassed American merchant ships and cut off their “legitimate markets” in Europe and the Caribbean; and that British agents were colluding with hostile Native Americans on the northwestern frontier. As negotiations had failed to end these “injuries and indignities which have been heaped on our country,” Madison insisted that the only recourse was war.[10]\n\nDo these accusations meet the criteria of self-defense? Arguably no. This was a war of choice. Great Britain did not attack or threaten to attack the United States in 1812; its economic warfare was aimed at France, not at the United States; and it undertook a number of conciliatory actions (to be discussed) in an attempt to keep war at bay. The United States had legitimate grievances against Great Britain as well as against France, but diplomatic options had not been exhausted and the suffering and death caused by the war was disproportionate to the original grievances. Moreover, what U.S. leaders defined as America’s maritime “rights” were in fact contested concepts in an uncertain international order. The idea that neutral nations such as the U.S. had the right to trade with any nation or colony anywhere at any time, irrespective of the mercantile policies of imperial nations, constituted a radical demand to establish a new international order of trade, an order that would benefit the U.S. at the expense of Great Britain, France, and Spain. As the American historian Paul Gilje notes, “The most important trading partners with the United States – France, Spain, and Great Britain – did not accept the ideal of free trade in any form.”[11] For the Democratic Republicans, however, there was great propaganda value in demanding trade “rights” instead of trade advantages.\n\nMany historians have also noted expansionist motives – the desire to acquire more territory – as a driving force for the war. This view is commonly accepted in Canada, but it is controversial in the United States as it points to the U.S. as the aggressor rather than the defender. Evidence for the expansionist interpretation lies in the ample rhetoric of U.S. leaders, the Madison administration’s diplomatic instructions, and the actual conduct of U.S. foreign policy, which includes not only U.S. efforts to conquer Canada but also military incursions into Spanish Florida and the suppression of Indian resistance to U.S. expansion. Critics of the expansionist interpretation discount “war hawk” rhetoric and deem aggressive U.S. diplomatic and military initiatives as calculated maneuvers designed to persuade Great Britain to acquiesce to U.S. maritime demands. The issues of impressment and “free trade,” they argue, were the real causes of the war, with expansionist motives playing only a minor role. Canadian historian Carl Benn argues to the contrary that “free trade and sailor’s rights” were the public rationales that hid more menacing motives:\n\n‘Free trade and sailor’s rights’ was not the simple cry of justice that popular history would have us believe. It was fraught with its own ambiguities and, perhaps more importantly, it was a cry co-opted to promote belligerency by annexationists who drove most of the government’s thinking. Combined with the native crisis on the western border, and Madison’s struggles to preserve his presidency, this led, in June 1812, to war.[12]\n\nHistorians have explored many issues and questions in regard to the War of 1812, but the question of the war’s legitimacy has not necessarily been a priority. For the American historian J. C. A. Stagg, the “central question posed by the war” is why the U.S. failed “to mount a more effective military effort than it did and in ways that would have permitted the Madison administration to hold enough Canadian territory to force concessions from Great Britain.”[13] This is undoubtedly an interesting question from a military standpoint, but it should not supersede the question of whether a war is necessary and just, lest the accolade of “success” be attributed to a wrongful war. One might ask instead:\n\nCould the War of 1812 have been avoided?\n\nThis question is hypothetical, of course, but worth exploring, as it discounts the idea of inevitability in history and draws attention to the alternatives available at the time. One indication that the War of 1812 could have been avoided is that all of the problems cited by Madison in justifying the war were long running concerns that had risen and fallen in importance over the previous two decades. The U.S. and Great Britain had managed their differences without resort to war. The British exerted no sudden demands on the U.S. in 1812, and in fact, belatedly attempted to appease the U.S. in the hope of avoiding war. The U.S. could have taken some initiative toward maintaining the peace by enacting a law that prohibited the employment of British deserters on American merchant ships, as suggested by British officials in 1806. This would have ameliorated a major reason for British searches of American ships. Great Britain, for its part, could have rigorously enforced its own regulations prohibiting ship commanders from impressing American citizens; and if mistakes were made, to promptly rectify the situation by returning the American seamen with compensation. Both governments could have negotiated an acceptable compromise on definitions of citizenship, as thousands of British-born immigrants to the U.S. were recognized by the U.S. as naturalized American citizens but were still claimed by Great Britain as British subjects (and thus were subject to conscription into the British Royal Navy). Any one of these actions would likely have opened the door to further cooperation.\n\nWar was not inevitable. Roughly forty percent of the members of Congress opposed the declaration of war. The House of Representatives passed a war resolution on June 4, 1812, by a vote of 79 yeas and 49 nays. This was followed on June 17 by a Senate vote of 19 yeas and 13 nays. The delay in the Senate vote was due to a flurry of Federalist proposals aimed at heading off war. One proposal aimed to limit military actions to naval confrontations rather than an all-out (land) war, but the measure was defeated on a 16 to 16 tie vote. One vote change would have prevented the U.S. from invading Canada.\n\nEven after the U.S. declared war on Great Britain on June 18, peace was possible. On June 23, Great Britain repealed its much despised Orders-in-Council, which had placed restrictions on U.S. maritime trade, thus removing one of the major barriers to peace. The British government fully expected the U.S. to revoke its war declaration and instructed Lieutenant General George Prevost, the governor-in-chief of Canada, to implement an armistice with General Henry Dearborn in the field. General Dearborn also expected the war to be called off and thus signed an armistice on August 9, temporarily ending hostilities. The Madison administration, however, repudiated the agreement on September 8, citing the British impressment policy as sufficient reason for continuing the war. The American invasion of Canada proceeded.\n\nIt is notable that, in the aftermath of the war, the spirit of compromise returned. Between 1815 and 1818, the United States and Great Britain signed treaties that settled outstanding boundary issues and created a largely demilitarized border between the U.S. and Canada. Americans and Canadians have since maintained a peaceful and constructive relationship, a model for neighborly relations in a still-violent world. Could this peaceful relationship have been achieved without the intercession of the War of 1812?\n\nII. Causes of the War of 1812\n\nThe most direct answer to the question of what caused the War of 1812 is that the United States declared war on Great Britain. This, of course, leads to the next question of what caused the United States to declare war. In answering the latter question, one must keep in mind that different parties had different reasons for going to war (and different reasons for opposing the war) and that the war proponents employed numerous arguments, both realistic and extreme, to garner public support and push their agenda through Congress. In sifting through these reasons and arguments, historians assign different degrees of importance, thus making for a never-ending debate as to which of the causes was more important. The schema below provides a synthesis of the main motives for war.\n\nMultiple causes of the War of 1812\n\nAs causes for the War of 1812, both maritime issues and territorial expansion cannot be understood without reference to the Napoleonic wars in Europe (1803-1815). British impressments and restrictions on American maritime trade were products of a titanic struggle between Great Britain and France, the global superpowers of the day. Both countries engaged in economic warfare, attempting to cut off trade to and from the other. Great Britain’s humiliating policy of searching U.S. merchant vessels and seizing British-born seamen and deserters was directly related to its need for seasoned sailors in the war.\n\nU.S. territorial ambitions were also stimulated by the Napoleonic wars. The occupation of Spain by Napoleon’s French forces in 1808 meant that Spain could do little to protect or control its colonies in the Americas. Revolutions broke out across South and Central America, eventually leading to independent nations. In the U.S., expansionists opportunistically eyed the acquisition of Spanish West and East Florida. In 1810, the Madison administration conspired with Americans residing in Spanish West Florida to wrest control of the colony for the U.S. This was followed in January 1811 by a secret Congressional authorization to conduct paramilitary operations against Spanish East Florida (see Section III).\n\nOpportunism was also a key factor in the U.S. invasion of Canada and the U.S. declaration of war itself. As of June 1812, British forces had been fighting on the Iberian Peninsula for five years. Americans knew that Great Britain could ill-afford to divert its troops and warships to protect its Canadian provinces – and Canada was the only realistic military target for the U.S. The miniscule U.S. Navy had no capacity to launch an attack on Great Britain or even its Caribbean colonies. The U.S. quest for Canada dated back to the outset of the War for Independence, when American forces attacked Quebec. Unable to succeed by force, American negotiators tried but failed to obtain all or part of British Canada at the end of that war. In 1812, with Great Britain under duress, another opportunity appeared to be at hand.\n\nTo maritime issues and territorial expansion one can add party politics, national honor, and a ripened war spirit as adjunct causes of the War of 1812. As has often occurred in U.S. history, the party that sought war employed the rhetoric of national honor to wrap the flag around itself and besmirch the opposing party as unpatriotic. The smear campaign began before the war began. On March 9, 1812, President Madison informed Congress that British agents were conspiring with New England Federalists “to foment disaffection and resistance to the law and prepare the way for a British invasion to destroy the Union and bring New England into a political connection with Britain.” The president claimed to have proof of the conspiracy, having paid $50,000 to a wily informer named John Henry for secret documents, but the proof turned out to be nothing of the kind. Henry had merely recorded dissident opinions in New England, none of which were threatening to the nation. Such charges of disloyalty continued throughout the war, prompting Rufus King, a Federalist senator from New York, to comment, “The charge that opposition encourages the enemy and injures the cause has at all times been made as an excuse for the failure and defeat of a weak administration.”[14]\n\nNational honor was often invoked in relation to maritime issues and more generally linked to territorial expansion – equating national honor with American dominance over the North American continent and its indigenous peoples, or what Thomas Jefferson described as an “empire of liberty.” War itself was deemed a proving ground for manly honor. In April 1812 Henry Clay warned that any let-up in the momentum toward war would bring “shame and indelible disgrace” upon the United States.[15] Once war was declared, national and personal honor were linked to winning battles (and disgrace linked to losing them), which tended to drown out reflection on the necessity and justness of the war. The war spirit also reinforced territorial ambitions. As the Boston Chronicle editorialized in 1813, “the Canadas ought in no event to be surrendered. . . . Too much valuable blood has already been shed, and too much treasure expended, to permit us to indulge for a moment the idea of resigning this country.”[16]\n\nThe following three sections look at the main causes in more depth and from the vantage points of different parties. In terms of historical assessment, President Madison’s justifications for war should be understood as accusations or claims, much like those of a plaintiff in a court case. No jury or judge would make a decision without viewing all evidence and hearing arguments from the other side.\n\nImpressments\n\nThe Royal Navy was the backbone of the British war against France as well as the protector of British trade. The navy grew from 16,000 sailors in 1792 to 145,000 in 1812. To meet its need for manpower, the British government employed naval press gangs to forcibly conscript every available young man throughout the British Isles, except those exempted from service because they worked a trade important to the empire. The Royal Navy also stopped both British and foreign merchant ships at sea and impressed any British-born sailor. Not surprisingly, many of these impressed sailors were ready to jump ship at the first opportunity – and thousands did so in the United States. Donald Hickey estimates that desertions averaged about 500 per month during the Napoleonic Wars. A sizable proportion of these deserters found employment on higher paying U.S. merchant ships. The loss of these trained seamen was intolerable to the British government. Especially galling was the fact that the U.S. government did nothing to assist the recapture of British deserters nor prevent their employment on American ships. “Had the United States created a credible and effective system for removing British subjects from American ships,” writes the American historian Troy Bickham, “Britain probably would have backed down and stopped aggressively seizing men on merchant vessels.”[17]\n\nIn 1809, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin estimated that about 9,000 British-born sailors were working on American merchant ships. “In other words,” writes the American historian Bradford Perkins, “about one-half of the able-bodied seamen serving on ships engaged in foreign trade were British. The Secretary of the Treasury calculated that the Americans recruited about 2,500 Englishmen each year.” The Royal Navy was intent on impressing these British-born sailors as well as capturing deserters. It was not interested in impressing American citizens, but many were nonetheless swept up in the navy’s search and seizure operations. Perkins calculates a “rock-bottom figure” of 3,800 American impressments between 1803 and 1812, but suggests a figure of over 6,000 may be more accurate. Bickham estimates a net total of 7,000 Americans seized over sixteen years:\n\nIdeally, Britain would have preferred that the United States prevent British subjects from working on American ships and hand over violators. Stopping and searching merchant vessels on the high seas was ineffective. Roughly 30 percent of the men impressed from American ships were later released after providing satisfactory proof of their American citizenship. As a result, the Royal Navy’s efforts to seize British subjects aboard American ships netted a paltry seven thousand sailors between 1796 and 1812.[18]\n\nThe impressment issue was complicated by the fact that U.S. and British law defined American citizenship differently. U.S. law allowed immigrants to become naturalized American citizens after five years residence. British law recognized American citizenship only for those residing in the U.S. before 1783 or those born in the U.S. since then. All others who were born in Great Britain or its colonies were deemed British subjects forever. There was no established international system defining citizenship, but England had been impressing sailors for some 400 years, giving the practice an aura of established legality.\n\nFurther muddying the waters was the easy availability of false citizenship papers, which led many British commanders to disregard such papers and simply pick out the seamen they wanted or perhaps those needed to replace deserters. The American press publicized the tragic stories of these kidnapped Americans, provoking widespread anger at the British. Federalists pressed for a diplomatic solution, while Democratic Republicans pressed for stronger measures against Great Britain.\n\nIn 1806, the British Ministry of All Talents contemplated “sharply limiting impressment in return for firm American commitments on the return of deserters,” in the words of Bradford Perkins, but British leaders were unwilling to give up the right to impress their subjects and they were skeptical that the U.S. would follow through on its end. The Jefferson administration, for its part, showed little interest in the deal after a Treasury Department report “showed the American merchant marine unable to stand the loss of men.” The reality was that the U.S. needed British-born sailors (and deserters) to crew its merchant vessels. According to the U.S. diplomatic historian Thomas A. Bailey:\n\nThe Americans, unfortunately for their case against “sailor snatching,” openly connived at desertion. Their prospering merchant marine was urgently in need of sailors, and in a position to offer alluring bounties, better working conditions, and seductively higher wages. . . . Every British warship that touched at American ports during the years of Napoleonic wars was in danger of losing some men. In 1804 twelve ships of the Royal Navy were detained at Norfolk, Virginia, because of deserters, some of whom paraded the streets cursing their officers and thumbing noses at them. Such episodes do much to explain why British press gangs made “mistakes” at the expense of the Americans on the high seas.[19]\n\nHad the issue of impressments been the sole motivation for war against Great Britain, the war would likely have begun in June 1807, when the British warship, H.M.S. Leopard, fired on the American warship, U.S.S. Chesapeake, killing three and wounding eighteen. A few weeks earlier, four sailors had deserted from a Royal Navy ship as it lay in harbor in Norfolk, Virginia. Rather than returning the deserters, as demanded by British officers, U.S. authorities allowed the four men to enlist on the Chesapeake. Fully aware of their employment, the commander of the Leonard ordered the Chesapeake to stop and allow the British to board. When the commander of the Chesapeake refused, the firing began. The British obtained their four deserters, of whom three were American-born; the fourth was British-born – and later hanged.[20]\n\nNews of the incident provoked indignation across the U.S. and prompted preparations for war; but the British government was sufficiently apologetic (normally only merchant ships were searched) and a number of U.S. leaders counseled patience. The Jefferson administration settled for issuing a proclamation on July 2, 1807, that prohibited all British warships from entering American coastal waters.\n\nOver the next four years, the issue of impressments remained a sore point for Americans but was deemed of less importance than trade restrictions. Another violent incident took place on the high seas on May 16, 1811, when the 40-gun American frigate, President, fired on the 20-gun British corvette, Little Belt, killing ten and wounding twenty-two. It was a case of mistaken identity, as the U.S. commander believed the Little Belt to be another ship that had impressed an American sailor. The U.S. offered no apology and popular opinion seemed to take pride in bloodying the British nose. As war talk gained momentum in Washington in the fall of 1811, Great Britain attempted to placate the U.S. First, it settled the Chesapeake affair by returning the remaining two American seamen (one had died in a Halifax hospital) and offering to pay reparations. Next, in the spring of 1812, “the British navy began to treat American ships and seamen with new tact,” according to Donald Hickey. “The Admiralty ordered all naval officers to take ‘especial care’ to avoid clashes with the American navy and to exercise ‘all possible forbearance’ toward American citizens. The commanding officers at both Halifax and Bermuda ordered their ships to keep clear of the American coast to avoid incidents.”[21]\n\nIn May 1812, the British made further accommodations on trade issues, then repealed its Orders-in-Council in June. These attempts at conciliation were brushed aside by the Madison administration and Democratic Republicans. President Madison painted an entirely different picture of recent developments in his war message of June 1, 1812, claiming that the U.S. had exhausted all possible avenues of diplomacy and that the British were entirely lacking of “conciliatory dispositions.” According to Hickey, “Republican leaders were so blinded by their distrust of Great Britain and so burdened by the ideological legacy of the Revolution that they saw significant British concessions as meaningless gestures.”[22]\n\nTrade restrictions\n\nThe United States and Great Britain were both competitors and partners in global trade. In the years leading up to the War of 1812, British restrictions on neutral carriers were not so onerous as to inhibit Americans from enjoying a profitable and growing maritime business. According to the historian Troy Bickham, “American merchant shipping boomed during Britain’s wars with France to become the world’s second largest carrier, not only transporting American and French products but also making sizable inroads into routes between Britain and its colonies in Asia and the Caribbean…. With ‘free trade’ as their slogan, Americans gained access to an unprecedented number of ports and routes.” As Britons struggled under a heavy burden of taxation and debt to maintain their war against France, many came to view American traders as “profiteers of the worst possible kind,” and thus supported measures to limit American trade expansion and sustain British dominance in global trade.[23]\n\nOn the cooperative side, the United States and Great Britain each profited from abundant trade with the other. Oceanic trade was the lifeblood of port cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. It was also very important to agricultural interests in the interior, which depended on foreign markets for the sale of foodstuffs, cotton, tobacco, lumber, and other goods. In Great Britain, trade provided jobs and income for British manufacturing centers such as Manchester and port cities such as Liverpool, “whose merchant community had evolved to specialize in importing American cotton, exporting British manufactures, and organizing the finances for the complicated exchanges,” notes Bickham. Most important to the British government, American wheat fed British troops on the Iberian Peninsula. “Throughout the summer and fall of 1810 and 1811,” writes John R. Grodzinski, “unprecedented quantities of American wheat and flour – over one million barrels of flour alone – were shipped to the Peninsula, the greater share destined for the British army operating there.” With American grain exports selling at high prices, “American farmers and merchants clamored to share in this wealth.”[24]\n\nTrade restrictions were nonetheless a long-standing problem for American maritime interests. When Great Britain and France went to war in 1793, both belligerents restricted the trade of neutral countries in order to deprive the adversary of economic goods and profits. The U.S. worked out many of its differences with Great Britain in the Jay Treaty of 1794, which resulted in a tripling of U.S. trade with Great Britain over the next decade. The French took offense and increased their seizures of U.S. merchant ships, leading to a Quasi-War in 1798, in which U.S. and French navies and privateers captured each other’s merchant vessels. Peace was reestablished in the Mortefontaine Treaty of 1800. The outbreak of a new war between Great Britain and France in 1803 prompted a return to the practice of confiscating neutral merchant ships. J. C. A. Stagg estimates that between 1803 and 1812, Great Britain seized more than 900 U.S. vessels and France took more than 500.[25] Although American maritime trade remained robust despite the seizures, cries of “free ships, free goods” and “free trade and sailors’ rights” grew louder, especially after France and Britain issued a new set of competing decrees in 1806 and 1807 (Napoleon’s Berlin and Milan decrees and British Orders in Council). The British decrees carried more weight as Great Britain had the means to prevent neutral trade with French-controlled Europe and French colonies.\n\nThe Jefferson administration passed up an opportunity to resolve many of the trade tensions plaguing U.S.-British relations when it dismissed a treaty signed by U.S. envoys James Monroe and William Pinckney in late 1806. According to the terms of the treaty, U.S. merchant ships would be allowed access to the British East Indies and to re-export goods; duties would be lowered at British ports; proper notice of blockades would be given to avoid unwarranted captures of U.S. vessels; compensation would be paid in the event of illegal captures; and the Royal Navy would not interfere with American vessels within five miles of the American coast. The U.S., in exchange, would deny the use of American harbors to French ships, prevent Americans from joining the armed forces of Great Britain’s enemies, and give up the doctrine of “free ships, free goods.” The agreement did not contain any provision to end impressments but the British promised to observe “the greatest caution” in impressing British seamen and to promptly address any claims that Americans had been taken. President Jefferson rejected the treaty, citing a lack of guarantees on the impressment issue and perhaps believing that he could get a better deal if the French were to gain ascendancy in the European war. Donald Hickey comments:\n\nThe rejection of the Monroe-Pinckney Treaty was a great turning point in the Age of Jefferson. Republicans would later claim that the only options the United States had in this era were submission, commercial sanctions, or war. But the Monroe-Pinckney Treaty offered another alternative, that of accommodation. By rejecting this treaty, the United States missed an opportunity to reforge the Anglo-American accord of the 1790s and to substitute peace and prosperity for commercial restrictions and war. After the loss of the Monroe-Pinckney Treaty, Anglo American relations steadily deteriorated.[26]\n\nHaving passed up a reasonable diplomatic option, the Jefferson administration and its allies in Congress passed a series of embargo laws between December 1807 and January 1809, which prohibited American ships from trading in all foreign ports. The embargo was meant to deprive Great Britain of needed goods and markets, but the larger effect was to create economic hardship and unemployment at home, especially in the Northeast. The embargo essentially halted American oceanic trade in the name of “free trade.” With smuggling rife, the Jefferson administration and Congress passed the Enforcement Act in April 1808, which allowed port authorities to seize cargoes without a warrant. This act did little more than raise popular fears of governmental authoritarianism. In March 1809, Congress replaced the Embargo Act with the Non-Intercourse Act, a watered-down version that forbade commerce only with France and Great Britain. This, too, was routinely evaded.\n\nThe embargo did have an effect on the British economy. It forced a number of textile factories dependent on American cotton to close, which in turn prompted manufacturers and laborers to petition the British government for a revocation of the Orders-in-Council. Yet the embargo also enhanced British trade profits, as “British shippers joyfully took over the carrying trade abandoned by their Yankee rivals,” writes Thomas Bailey; and it eased the Royal Navy’s perennial manpower shortage. “Unemployed American seamen were faced with the alternative of starving or finding jobs elsewhere. Hundreds of Yankee sailors, as well as British subjects or deserters, were thus driven into Britain’s merchant marine or navy – with an incidental easing of impressment.” The French surreptitiously took advantage of the situation by declaring their support for the embargo, then confiscating American vessels and cargoes in French harbors on the pretext that “they must be disguised British craft.”[27]\n\nSoon after taking the presidential oath on March 4, 1809, James Madison met with the British minister in Washington, David M. Erskine, who had an American wife and felt sympathetic toward the United States. Eager to resolve the tensions between the two countries, Erskine put forth a proposed agreement to end the British Orders-in-Council and Madison readily signed it. The president announced the agreement on June 10, 1809, which prompted celebrations around the country. Unfortunately, Erskine went beyond his instructions and London repudiated the agreement. Deeply embarrassed and publicly mocked, Madison was obliged to reinstate the Non-Intercourse Act on August 9. The experience seems to have hardened Madison toward future compromise. Still searching for a solution, in May 1810 Congress replaced the Non-Intercourse Act with Macon Bill Number Two, a fuzzy law that reopened American trade with France and Great Britain but contained a provision that if either nation repealed its restrictive policies, the U.S. would ban trade with the other. When France declared its intention to do so, without actually doing so, the Madison administration demanded that Great Britain rescind its latest Orders-in-Council. When it did not, Congress passed a new measure in March 1811 that banned imports only from Great Britain.\n\nThe British government was not inclined to rescind its Orders-in-Council, but it did make a conciliatory gesture in May 1812 by offering the U.S. an equal share of the licensed trade enjoyed by the British on the European continent. This would have opened the continent to U.S. trade again but under rules set by Great Britain. The Madison administration declined the offer, “believing that accepting it would be tantamount to surrendering American independence,” according to Hickey. Finally, on June 23, the British made the concession that the Madison administration had demanded, repealing its Orders-in-Council, but the news did not reach the U.S. until August 13. President Madison suspected that the repeal was “a trick to turn America from war,” according to Perkins, but it was not a trick. It was a sincere attempt to avoid war as well as to repair the economic damage wrought by American trade restrictions. British officials, in fact, believed that the U.S. had been tricked by Napoleon into demanding accommodations from Great Britain that France itself had not made. London expected Washington to retract its war declaration, but the Madison administration was intent on the war. The only change was in American propaganda, as “free trade” could no longer be used to justify the war. “War Hawk journals quickly shifted to impressment and indemnities for past seizures,” notes Perkins.[28] They also revived the patriotic fervor of old, portraying the war as a fight for independence, as if the British were intent on returning the U.S. to colonial status.\n\nOne problem for President Madison in terms of justifying war against Great Britain was that France never ceased preying on American merchant ships, contrary to its verbal assurances. In his war message to Congress on June 1, 1812, Madison left open the possibility that the U.S. would take action against France in the future. Yet it was hardly possible for the U.S. to undertake two wars against the world’s greatest powers. Madison’s rhetoric conveyed a sense of balance and justice in the administration of American foreign policy, but the reality was that the United States, by declaring war on Great Britain, was indirectly aiding Napoleonic France. The reverse was true as well. The success of the American war effort would at least partly depend on the military success of Napoleon, for if Napoleon’s forces were defeated, British forces would be released to fight against the United States. As it turned out, Napoleon’s invasion of Russia – which began on June 24, six days after the U.S. declared war on Great Britain – turned into a disastrous defeat, with some 400,000 French soldiers losing their lives; but it would take until April 1814 before British forces could be redeployed. Thomas Bailey writes:\n\nAmerica plunged into the conflict at such a time as to be a virtual ally of the dreaded Bonaparte. The Madison administration was counting on him to pin down British strength in Europe and thus clear the path for the invasion of Canada. During the ensuing months Napoleon’s victories were greeted in Madisonian circles with joy; his defeats with gloom. The reactions of the New England Federalists were precisely the opposite. In Federalist eyes, America was fighting against her true long-range interests. As the leading champion of constitutional government in the New World, she should have been waging war on the greatest despot of the age, Napoleon, at the side of England, the surviving champion of constitutional government in the Old World.[29]\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nIt is difficult for Americans today to conceive of the United States as anything other than a coast-to-coast land mass. Yet the present boundaries were not foreordained. Nor was it decided in 1812 that Native Americans should be removed from their homelands and confined to reservations. The U.S. was growing rapidly in population at the time and small groups were pushing beyond white-settled areas into areas already settled by Native American tribes – the First Nations. The U.S. population expanded from 5.3 million in 1800 to 7.2 million in 1810, to 9.6 million in 1820. The population in 1810 included 1.4 million African Americans of whom 1.2 million were enslaved (one out of every six Americans). The U.S. population in 1810 was smaller than that of Great Britain, about 12 million, and much smaller than that of France, about 30 million, but significantly larger than the combined indigenous population.[30]\n\nEstimates of the indigenous population are conjectural, notes the historian Walter Nugent, “but there were likely 200,000 to 250,000 east of the Mississippi in the late eighteenth century.” Most of the latter were living in Trans-Appalachian region (located between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, and between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes). Tribes included the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles in the southern part, and moving further to the north, Shawnees, Delawares, Mingoes, Ottawas, Wyandots, Miamis, Potawatomis, Kickapoos, Chippewas, and others.[31] None of these tribes were consulted when the British transferred “ownership” of their lands to the United States in 1783. As with all such treaties, however, it was understood that claims of political sovereignty by European and American states did not negate the rights of Native Americans to occupy their lands. Taking actual possession of these lands required additional imperial efforts.\n\nOne such imperial effort took place in the Old Northwest Territory in the fall of 1809. William Henry Harrison, the governor of the Indiana Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs, convinced leaders of the Miami, Potawatomi, and Delaware tribes to transfer three million acres to the United States in exchange for payments to the tribes. The Shawnee leader, Tecumseh, met with Harrison in August 1810 to protest. “Sell a country!” he told Harrison. “Why not sell the air, the clouds and the great sea, as well as the earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for the use of his children?”[32] Tecumseh warned Harrison not to allow American settlers into the area. He and his brother Tenskwatawa, known as the Prophet, had a vision of establishing a permanent pan-Indian homeland in the Old Northwest Territory and reviving Native ways of life. They traveled across the Trans-Appalachian region gathering recruits and forming a loose confederacy of tribes and factions of tribes.\n\nOn November 7, 1811, while Tecumseh was away on a recruiting drive, Harrison led a force of 1,000 men on a mission to destroy Tecumseh’s camp at Prophetstown, located in Indian territory. As Harrison and his men neared the town, Tenskwatawa led a surprise attack against the invading force. Harrison’s men suffered heavy casualties but still managed to burn the town as well as stores of food, imperiling the Indians’ survival in the coming winter. Harrison’s attack was meant to throttle Tecumseh’s confederacy in its infancy, but the effect was rather to encourage more tribes and warriors to join it and take up arms against encroaching Americans. Fighting spread to the west, with Indian raids taking place in present-day Indiana, Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa. As the region became embroiled in violence, the Madison administration commended Harrison for his attack and blamed the British for supplying arms and ammunition to the various tribes. The British indeed supplied some arms but they counseled patience and restraint, not wishing to become embroiled in an American war. As the American diplomatic historian George Herring writes, “The British in fact responded with notable caution to Indian unrest, but Americans could not concede the legitimacy of Indian grievances without admitting their own guilt. They blamed the agitation on the British.”[33] Once the U.S. declared war against Great Britain, however, Tecumseh cemented an alliance with the British and provided critical support in battles around Lake Erie. He died in the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813.\n\nThe War of 1812 pitted the U.S. against Great Britain, but it encompassed a number of Indian wars as well. In addition to the war against Tecumseh’s confederacy in the Ohio Valley, U.S. forces engaged Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi Valley led by Sauk chieftain Black Hawk, Red Stick Creeks in the Mississippi Territory (which had little to do with the British), Seminoles in Spanish East Florida, and First Nation allies of the British in Upper Canada. These associated Indian wars all played into U.S. expansionist ambitions. Although the U.S. failed to conquer Canada, it succeeded in gaining large cessions of land from Native American tribes. The Creeks were forced to cede 23 million acres to the United States in 1814. Following the War of 1812, the U.S. signed treaties of cession with eighteen different tribes between 1816 and 1823. The treaty with the Delaware, signed on October 3, 1818, was the first to completely remove a tribe to reservation lands west of the Mississippi River. In Florida, the U.S. revived its war against the Seminoles, which had begun in mid-1812, impelling the Spanish government to cede the peninsula to the United States in the Transcontinental Treaty of 1819.\n\nUnderstanding the expansionist motive in the War of 1812 requires an appreciation of both the wider geographical context and the deeper historical context. The wider context places the war in relation to the Napoleonic wars in Europe and the opportunity this provided for extending U.S. control over the North American continent. The deeper context places the war in a longer time frame of American “western expansionism” and Native American resistance. It took nearly one hundred years (1750-1850) to transform the Trans-Appalachian region from an area almost wholly populated by Indians into one almost wholly populated by white Americans and their black slaves. The process was punctuated by formidable resistance movements led by Pontiac (Ottawa) in the 1760s, Little Turtle (Miami) in the 1790s, Tecumseh (Shawnee) in the 1810s, and, in Florida, Osceola (Creek/Seminole) in the 1830s. Expansionism then shifted to the American West, which took only forty years to eradicate Native American resistance.\n\nRidding the continent of European powers was equally important in gaining control over the continent. Between 1810 and 1850, the U.S. forcefully deprived Spain and Mexico of large land holdings in North America – Florida, Texas, and the American Southwest. In 1812, U.S. expansionists focused on Spanish Florida and British Canada. “Americans fully realized the many advantages that might accrue from the acquisition of Canada,” writes Donald Hickey. “It would remove Great Britain, a powerful rival, from the nation’s northern flank; it would put an end to foreign influence over American Indians and leave Americans in control of the still lucrative fur trade; it would eliminate trade barriers on the northern frontier and secure an invaluable east-west transportation route that included the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River; and it would open vast new expanses of farmland to American settlers.”[34] The goal was not simply to gain new lands for American farmers and investors in the immediate, but also to establish American control over the continent in the future.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the War of 1812 was a contest between an emerging empire, the United States, and an established one, Great Britain. “The British knew all about aggrandizement,” writes Tony Bickham, “having added a further seventeen colonies to its empire along with tens of millions of people since going to war with France in 1793.” Although the United States had broken away from Great Britain in 1776, it was nonetheless following in the footsteps of the British empire. According to Bickman:\n\nThe United States was undeniably imperialist in 1812. Within two generations it had doubled its size, dispossessing the native inhabitants of their land and stripping the declining Spanish Empire of huge swaths of its territory. Like their colonial forefathers, Americans interchangeably employed violence, diplomacy, and commerce (sometimes simultaneously) in an impressive pace of growth. . . . Cheap and abundant land was crucial to the Republicans, who idealized the small farmer and relied heavily on his vote. Expansion was also highly controversial, as opponents, particularly in New England, worried about the necessity, cost, legality, and consequences of expansion.[35]\n\nAmerican views on expansionism\n\nAmericans in 1812 did not all agree on imperial expansion. Their views can roughly be divided into three categories: those who favored aggressive expansionism (hard-core); those who favored it under certain conditions (soft-core); and those who opposed aggressive expansionism (dissenters). The hard-core expansionists were intent on taking over Canada. They believed this would reduce Indian resistance to American expansion by depriving hostile tribes of British arms and Canadian refuges across the border. Americans would also benefit by taking over the Canadian lumber and fur trades, obtaining additional lands for settlers, and securing permanent fishing and whaling rights off Newfoundland.\n\nMany aggressive expansionists furthermore envisioned U.S. dominion over the whole of North America. “I shall never die contented,” said Representative Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, “until I see her [Great Britain’s] expulsion from North America, and her territories incorporated with the United States.” Former President Thomas Jefferson thought similarly, writing to a friend on June 28, 1812, ten days after the war began, “Upon the whole, I have known no war entered into under more favorable auspices. Our present enemy will have the sea to herself, while we shall be equally predominant at land, and shall strip her of all her possessions on this continent.” Such imperial views were voiced in all parts of the country. Rep. John A. Harper of New Hampshire proffered an early version of the Manifest Destiny doctrine, saying, “To me, sir, it appears that the Author of Nature has marked our limits in the south, by the Gulf of Mexico; and on the north, by the regions of eternal frost.” The leading “war hawk,” Representative Henry Clay of Kentucky, was likewise intent on mastery of the continent, telling his colleagues on the House floor:\n\nIt is absurd to suppose that we will not succeed in our enterprise against the enemy’s Provinces. We have the Canadas as much under our command as Great Britain has the ocean, and the way to conquer her on the ocean is to drive her from the land. I am not for stopping at Quebec or anywhere else; but I would take the whole continent from them, and ask them no favors. . . . We must take the Continent from them. I wish never to see peace till we do. God has given us the power and the means; we are to blame if we do not use them.[36]\n\nThe outbreak of war in the northwestern frontier on November 7, 1811, strengthened the hand of the hard-core expansionists. They could now claim that Great Britain was complicit in the murder of American settlers on the frontier. “We shall drive the British from our Continent,” declared Representative Felix Grundy of Tennessee on December 9; “they will no longer have an opportunity of intriguing with our Indian neighbors, and setting on the ruthless savage to tomahawk our women and children.” Like other expansionists, Grundy regarded Native American resistance to American encroachments as aggression against American “settlers,” thus requiring forceful and punitive actions by the U.S. government in response. This was a common pattern in U.S. history. Grundy viewed the United States as an expanding empire. “I feel anxious therefore,” he continued, “not only to add the Floridas to the South, but the Canadas to the North of this empire.”\n\nAs the momentum toward war gathered strength in Congress in the spring of 1812, Representative John C. Calhoun of South Carolina countered the idea that the U.S. was unprepared, telling his colleagues, “So far from being unprepared, sir, I believe that in four weeks from the time that a declaration of war is heard on our frontiers the whole of Upper and a part of Lower Canada will be in our possession.”[37]\n\nThe soft-core expansionists were more sensitive to domestic and international criticism of aggression, and thus were more hesitant in their demands for Canada. President Madison and Secretary of State James Monroe were of this mindset, waiting to see how the war progressed, whether Great Britain would give in on maritime issues, and whether public opinion would support, or demand, annexation. Both men publicly asserted that the invasion of Canada was primarily a means to an end, the end being British acquiescence to America’s maritime demands. Their diplomatic correspondence, however, tells a different story. Only one week after war was declared, Monroe wrote to Jonathan Russell, the American chargé d’affaires in London, stating that, should the U.S. invasion of Canada succeed, American public opinion could make it “difficult to relinquish Territory which had been conquered.” After American forces invaded and burned York, the capital of Upper Canada, in April 1813, Monroe instructed his commissioners in London to negotiate for the transfer of Upper Canada to the United States. At the war’s end, despite the fact that Canada had successfully fended off U.S. invasions, American negotiators were instructed to work for the cession of all of Canada, arguing that this would foreclose the possibility of future war – a veiled threat that the U.S. would try again to acquire Canada through forceful means. The British negotiators were not moved and Canada remained British.[38]\n\nOpposing all of the expansionists were the dissenters. “Opponents charged that the war was not a defense of maritime rights against British arrogance and rapacity, but an aggressive grab for territory,” according to the historian Jerald A. Combs. Lending support to this assertion, Combs asks why, if “maritime grievances were the genuine motivation for the war . . . did the opposition to the war center in the New England area, where maritime grievances were most felt, while young western war hawks like Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Felix Grundy led the congressional movement for war?”\n\nDissenters opposed the war against Great Britain in general, and the invasion of Canada in particular. The idea of attacking Canada was particularly loathsome. Why attack a peaceful neighbor because of British abuses at sea? The point was raised by Congressman Josiah Quincy, a Federalist from Massachusetts and future president of Harvard University. “If you had a field to defend in Georgia,” he said, “it would be very strange to put up a fence in Massachusetts. And yet, how does this differ from invading Canada for the purpose of defending our maritime rights?”[39]\n\nRepresentative John Randolph of Virginia was among the twenty Democratic Republicans in Congress who voted against the war resolution. Speaking on the House floor on December 16, 1811, he declared, “Agrarian cupidity, not maritime right, urges the war.” He was also one of the very few to acknowledge American responsibility for the outbreak of the Indian war in the Ohio Valley:\n\nAdvantage had been taken of the spirit of the Indians, broken by the war which ended in the Treaty of Greenville [1795]. Under the ascendancy then acquired over them, they had been pent up by subsequent treaties into nooks, straightened in their quarters by a blind cupidity, seeking to extinguish their title to immense wilderness . . . It was our own thirst for territory, our own want of moderation, that had driven these sons of nature to desperation, of which we felt the effects.[40]\n\nPresident Madison, in his war message of June 1, 1812, tried to avoid giving the dissenters more ammunition with which to attack him. He made no reference to his plans to invade Canada or to the actual invasions of Spanish Florida already underway. Instead, he kept the focus on British abuses of American maritime rights and alleged British intransigence in negotiations, making war appear to be the last resort in defense of American sovereignty and honor. Madison also made numerous references to international law, citing the “law of nations,” the “acknowledged laws of war,” the “unlawfulness” of British actions on the high seas, the British “war against the lawful commerce,” and British “lawless violence.” Such rhetoric hid a double standard of international conduct, as Madison did not subject U.S. territorial violations against Spanish Florida to the same moral scrutiny. Moreover, U.S. covert operations in Florida were more egregious than British abuses on the high seas in terms of loss of life and suffering. Madison kept American transgressions out of public view while shining a spotlight on British indiscretions.\n\nIII. Covert action against Spanish Florida\n\nSome historical accounts of the War of 1812 exclude U.S. efforts to take possession of Spanish West and East Florida, deeming them separate affairs. They are included here because they were part of the overall U.S. expansionist drive that was partly responsible for the War of 1812. Moreover, had it not been for a narrow vote (rejection) in Congress, the Madison administration would have formally added the military conquest of the Florida peninsula to its war aims. American expansionists desired Spanish Florida for a variety of reasons: economic trade would be enhanced by the full possession of the navigable rivers that opened into the Gulf of Mexico; American settlers would have access to more land; escaped slaves and hostile Indians would lose their Florida sanctuaries; and military security as well as trade would be enhanced by the acquisition of ports in Pensacola and Mobile. The Spanish government furthermore maintained a free black militia, which challenged the racist prejudices of American southerners.\n\nWhen the Jefferson administration purchased the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, the American minister, Robert Livingston, asked the French foreign minister, Charles Talleyrand, whether the purchase included West Florida. Talleyrand gave no definitive response, saying only, “You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it.”[41] The Treaty of San Ildefonso that ceded the Louisiana Territory from Spain to France in 1800 did not include the Florida colonies. What it did include was a proviso that France could not transfer or sell the Louisiana Territory to a third power. That, of course, is exactly what Napoleon did in 1803, and why Spain and Great Britain deemed the Louisiana Purchase illegal.\n\nIn 1804, the Jefferson administration commissioned James Monroe to negotiate the cession of East and West Florida to the United States, but the Spanish Crown adamantly refused. The impetus to military action came when Napoleon took over the Spanish government in May 1808. Speculation arose in the U.S. that Spain might transfer its territories to either France or Great Britain, or perhaps allow British warships to be stationed at Florida ports – since the Spanish government-in-exile was now allied with Great Britain in the war against Napoleon. In any case, Spain was in no position to protect its Florida colonies.\n\nPresident James Madison moved first against Spanish West Florida. In 1810 he instructed his agents to encourage American residents living near Baton Rouge to rebel against Spanish authority, form a provisional government, and request annexation by the United States. The resident Americans carried out the plan, capturing a small Spanish fort at Baton Rouge – and killing two soldiers and wounding three in the process – then proclaiming the independent “Republic of West Florida” and requesting annexation by the United States along with protection from any Spanish counterattack. Two days after hearing news of the insurrection, President Madison ordered the governor of Louisiana to station troops in the area. On October 27, 1810, he issued a formal proclamation taking possession of West Florida (from the Perdido River to the Mississippi River) on behalf of the United States. Spanish forces nevertheless remained at Fort Mobile until April 1813, when they evacuated to Pensacola.\n\nThe Madison administration’s plan for taking over East Florida followed along the same lines as that for taking West Florida, but the operation proved more difficult. On Jan. 15, 1811, Congress authorized the president to “take possession” of East Florida if requested by a “local authority” or in the event of occupation “by any foreign government.”[42] Federalists opposed the bill but were outvoted by Madison’s Democratic Republicans. Congress also voted to keep the authorization secret, prohibiting its publication. The president thereupon appointed General George Mathews, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and former governor of Georgia, as his secret agent to put the plan into effect. Mathews met with Secretary of State Robert Smith and Colonel John McKee to work out the details. The plan involved recruiting a mercenary army of American “Patriots” by offering each man fifty acres of land, persuading or intimidating as many East Florida residents as possible to rebel against Spanish authority, then establishing a base from which to declare allegiance to the U.S. and request annexation.\n\nIn 1812, the population of Spanish East Florida was less than 10,000, a mixture of Anglos, Spaniards, blacks (both slave and free), Greeks, and some 3,000 Seminoles living in the interior. The population of Georgia, in contrast, was about one-quarter million. The main towns on the Florida east coast were Fernandina, a prosperous trading center, and St. Augustine, the governmental and military center – protected by the sizable Spanish fort, Castillo de San Marcos. Black slaves, numbering about 2,000, were generally treated better in Spanish East Florida than their counterparts in the U.S., with some serving in the Spanish military. A number of the Anglo businessmen in the area were raising families with black women, former slaves they had bought and freed; and some were married, such as Zephaniah and Anna Kingsley. These families and their biracial children were accepted in the Spanish colony. The arming of blacks, the acceptance of multi-racial families, and the refuge provided for escaped slaves from the U.S. by the Seminoles were all intolerable to most white Georgians.[43]\n\nGen. Mathews and Col. McKee arrived at St. Marys, Georgia, just north of the Florida border, on February 25, 1811. By March 1812, Matthews had recruited about 125 men, mostly from Georgia, along with a handful of residents of Spanish East Florida. Mathews was ready to launch an attack on fortified St. Augustine, but the detachment of U.S. Army troops at St. Marys had received no orders to attack; hence, Major Jacint Laval refused to allow his troops to accompany Mathews. After a bitter argument, Mathews settled on taking possession of Fernandina, a largely defenseless town. Laval relented to some degree by allowing nine American gunboats to be used. The plan was carried out on March 16. The residents of Fernandina were sufficiently intimidated by the sight of the gunboats to surrender the town without a fight.\n\nThe ensuing American occupation of the area between Fernandina and St. Augustine proved disastrous and oppressive for area residents. The invading Americans stole their property, ate their food, and threatened them with violence if they did not join the “rebellion” against Spanish authority. For U.S. military officers, there was no glory in this secret war. As Major General John Floyd wrote to a senator on March 21, “Every Officer feels little in his own esteem in this hidden policy – all the sin of direct invasion Rests on the shoulders of the Government or its agents, and too, against a weak defenseless, unoffending Neighbor.”[44]\n\nNews of the U.S. invasion spread quickly through U.S. newspapers. Federalist-leaning papers such as the New York Evening Post decried the American seizure of Fernandina, calling it “an outrageous act of depredation, or, if countenanced by the government, an act of open war on a nation with whom we are at peace.” Two Democratic Republican-leaning papers, the National Intelligencer and the Niles Register, took the Madison administration’s public pronouncements at face value and ridiculed the idea that the administration was behind the attacks. The Georgia Argus, on the other hand, endorsed the idea of U.S. military occupation of Spanish East Florida, however it occurred. President Madison publicly disavowed his administration’s role in the invasion and placed the blame on Mathews, claiming that he had exceeded his instructions. On April 4, Madison replaced Mathews with Georgia Governor David Mitchell but nonetheless continued the clandestine U.S. occupation. The governor had previously written to Secretary of State James Monroe warning that the Spaniards “have armed every able-bodied negro within their power” and have received “nearly two companies of black [Cuban] troops!” Should these black troops be permitted to remain in Florida, he continued, “our southern country will soon be in a state of insurrection.”[45]\n\nThe American incursion into East Florida drew sharp protests from both Great Britain and the Spanish government in exile. The British instructed their consul in Washington, Augustus Foster, to “protest against any attempt to seize that Province from our Ally.” President Madison denied U.S. government complicity. The Royal Gazette in Nassau regarded the U.S. invasion as symptomatic of a greedy, expansionist nation: “This proceeding well accords with the general tenor of conduct of the American Government, which, like its Prototype, of France, readily throws aside principles of Honour and Justice, to effect its objects of ambition and aggrandisement.” The Bahama Gazette similarly editorialized that the U.S. government was engaged in “an atrocious aggression on the rights of a friendly power, at a time they are so clamourous about their own.”[46]\n\nOn June 18, 1812, the U.S. formally declared war on Great Britain. One day later, Democratic Republican “war hawks” in Congress introduced a bill to formally authorize U.S. military occupation of East and West Florida. The bill passed easily in the House, 70-48, but it was unexpectedly defeated in the Senate. According to the historian James G. Cusiak:\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the bill’s defeat. Federalists in the Senate were still bitterly resentful about the declaration of war against England, which they had strenuously opposed. Some of them thought that the war had been rammed down their throats and that their objections and calls for public debate had been ignored. Now they were being asked to acquiesce in a war with Spain. Determined to reassert themselves against their hawkish colleagues, they used the Florida bill to make known their dissent. Newspaper accounts of affairs in East Florida helped them to underscore their objections. . . . [There was] so much evidence for American threats and intimidations against the residents of Amelia Island that it was impossible to maintain a pretense that the Spaniards had been the aggressors.[47]\n\nAlthough the pretense of a “rebellion” had been exposed and legislation to permit U.S. occupation had been defeated, the Madison administration still carried on with the occupation of Spanish East Florida. U.S. military forces were not recalled. Mathews, before learning of his dismissal, increased his offer of land to new recruits from 50 to 500 acres, thereby swelling the ranks of his “Patriot” volunteers. In September, Col. Smith organized a siege of St. Augustine, but he was forced to retreat due to ambushes and a shortage of supplies. Shortages became more acute for the residents of East Florida, as the occupying Americans made a steady practice of stealing goods and property. “By some estimates,” writes Cusiak, “as many as 10,000 head of cattle were either stolen away or killed and left to decompose in East Florida during the thirteen months between April 1812 and May 1813.” Those who refused to join the rebel ranks were harassed further; and if they abandoned their homes for safer quarters, their houses were ransacked and burned down.[48]\n\nIn July 1812, the Seminoles joined the battle on the side of the Spanish, having heard that the Patriot leaders were handing out generous land grants in their territory. Seminole warriors ambushed U.S. supply wagons and Patriot raiding parties. One attack by a large number of black and Indian Seminoles on September 12 resulted in the death of a U.S. Army captain. Two weeks later, Colonel Daniel Newman led a group of Georgia volunteers in a raiding expedition into the interior. A fierce battle at Payne’s Prairie led to an anguished U.S. retreat. A second expedition of Georgia and Tennessee militia in February 1813 did more damage. Although the Seminoles evaded their opponents, they lost much of their subsistence. The Americans recorded setting fires to 386 houses, seizing 1500-2000 bushels of corn, and taking 300 horses and 400 head of cattle. Unlike the invasion of Spanish East Florida, few Americans objected to the invasion of Seminole country, as wars against Native Americans were deemed allowable under almost any circumstances.\n\nIn mid-January 1813, with the war against Great Britain well under way, the “war hawks” once again tried to move a bill through Congress authorizing formal U.S. takeover of East Florida. Federalists once again denounced the idea. Senator William Hunter, a Federalist from Rhode Island, told his colleagues, “I say this is not only war, but an offensive war; not only an offensive war, but an unjust war. It is a wicked war. It is robbery.”[49] A vote was taken in the Senate on February 2 and the bill failed, 16 ayes to 19 nays. With the defeat of this second bill, President Madison decided that he could no longer maintain the ruse of supporting a Spanish rebellion. On March 7, he ordered U.S. troops to leave East Florida.\n\nWithout the backing of U.S. troops and weapons, there was little chance that the Georgia militiamen could achieve a military victory in Spanish East Florida. They nonetheless continued their rogue operations for another year, engaging in skirmishes with the Spanish military, raiding Seminoles villages, and harassing and robbing area residents. The robbing became more abusive when a band of Georgians led by Samuel Alexander took up raiding plantations and abducting blacks, free or slave. The latter were sold in Georgia for a hefty profit. One faction of the Georgia militia led by Buckner Harris set off for the interior in the winter of 1813-1814. Arriving in what is now Alachua County, they set up an independent “Republic of East Florida” and sought recognition from the federal government. The Madison administration, however, denied their request in April 1814. The following month, a British squadron under Vice Admiral George Cockburn entered St. Mary’s River and secured Amelia Island. In January 1815, Cockburn’s fleet returned to the area and established a base camp on nearby Cumberland Island for escaping slaves. Hundreds fled to the British over the next two months, reversing for a short time American enslavement operations.\n\nThe so-called Patriot War ended in 1814, but the American quest for East Florida did not. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent, signed in December 1814, East Florida remained a Spanish dominion. Hostilities were renewed in mid-1816, when an American force attacked Negro Fort at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River (Florida Panhandle), where free blacks and runaway slaves had established themselves at the end of the War of 1812. Hot cannon fire from American gunboats hit the fort’s powder magazine, causing a massive explosion that destroyed the fort and killed 270 of the 334 defenders. The following year, General Andrew Jackson led a force of 3,000 men against the Seminoles, burning towns, destroying crops, and killing livestock. The Spanish government, convinced that it could not protect its colony, ceded Florida to the United States in the Transcontinental Treaty of 1819, which the U.S. ratified in 1821. The treaty specifically stated that the U.S. must make restitution for damages caused “by the late operations of the American Army in Florida.” This stipulation led, after much delay, to some 200 legal cases between 1836 and 1842. Residents who had suffered personal and financial losses due to the American occupation presented their testimony to the court and in many cases, won compensation from the U.S. government.[50]\n\nJ. C. A. Stagg offers a cogent evaluation of the whole East Florida affair:\n\nThe East Florida revolution of 1812 was an embarrassing and shameful moment in the history of early American foreign policy. . . . It was shameful because its motivating force was the desire to seize a territory to which the United States had only a disputable claim by the illegal subversion of the Spanish colonial regime. In gratifying that desire, the administration of James Madison made a mockery of the idealism that justified its foreign policy, while in East Florida itself the American-backed revolutionaries inflicted widespread devastation on the local population.[51]\n\nIV. Costs and conduct of the War of 1812\n\nThere are many historical accounts of the War of 1812 that focus on military and logistical aspects. A few studies, such as Alan Taylor’s 1812: The Civil War of American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, and Indian Allies (2010), concentrate on how the war affected civilians, soldiers, and communities. Taylor’s detailed study reveals the tragedy of the war for those who lived along the U.S.-Canadian border. The war created enmity and bloodshed where friendship and peace had reigned for many years.\n\nIn 1812, Upper Canada (Ontario region) was populated by 75,000 non-Indian residents, of whom three-fifths had emigrated from the United States after the War for Independence, enticed by generous land purchase terms. These “late Loyalists,” as they were called, joined American Loyalists from the American Revolutionary War, French-speaking Canadians, and other hearty souls who could brave the Canadian winters. There were many cross-border family ties as well as trade and business connections. Religious affiliations also transcended national boundaries. Some Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist congregations shared the same itinerant preachers. “Upper Canadians had no quarrel with their neighbours and, even among the Loyalists, the United States was scarcely seen as a foreign country,” writes the Canadian historian George Sheppard. “The colonists were firm in their belief that they were not responsible for the deteriorating relationship between Britain and the United States.”[52] All in all, Americans and British Canadians had no cause to fight each other.\n\nAnd yet they did, or at least some did. British Canadians had a real stake in defending themselves, their property, and their country against the invading Americans, but even here, many men wavered in their commitment, being uncertain as to whether it was possible or wise to resist the presumably stronger American forces. Some tried to avoid military service, some deserted, and a few hundred, mainly Late Loyalists, abandoned their farms and relocated in the United States. On the American side, despite saber-rattling war talk, enlistments were lackluster. “The War Department could never build up the regular army to half its authorized strength and obtained only 10,000 one-year volunteers out of 50,000 authorized,” notes the American historian Samuel Eliot Morison.53 In New England, where opposition to the war was strongest, the governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut refused to comply with the president’s requests for militia. Elsewhere, hundreds of men serving in the Ohio and New York militias refused to participate in any invasion of British Canada, believing that state militias were organized for defensive purposes only. More than a few militiamen on both sides hoped to be captured and paroled. Paroled militia were sent back to their towns and prohibited from taking part in the war unless officially exchanged for parolees from the other side. Fraternizing with the “enemy” never entirely ceased for either civilians or soldiers.\n\nThe lack of war spirit was also evident in abundant trading with the “enemy.” Americans flagrantly disregarded a U.S. law banning exports to Canada, marching large herds of cattle across the Canadian border at night. British troops in Canada survived the long winters on American beef. Royal Navy crews visiting American ports in search of fresh water and supplies also found willing sellers. Even the U.S. government hedged in its embrace of all-out war, as it continued to allow wheat shipments to be sent to British regiments in Europe, in deference to American farmers.\n\nYet savagery and the spirit of revenge, the usual products of war, were not missing from the War of 1812. Prisoners were sometimes killed – and scalped – and defenseless towns were sometimes burned. In lieu of the normal moral restraints of civilian life, military rules-of-warfare, leadership, and troop discipline were needed to curb wanton violence and plunder. Oftentimes, one or more of these restraints were absent. Both the U.S. and British governments “professed to favor humane treatment,” but operations in the field often belied this intent, especially when Native American warriors were involved. The rules of “civilized” warfare, in which soldiers were not to harm prisoners and civilians nor destroy or steal civilian property, were generally not applied to U.S.-Indian warfare. From the vantage point of Native Americans, the European and American way of war could hardly be considered more civilized given the high number of casualties caused by their advanced weaponry. In any case, the atrocities that occurred during the war served to reinforce dehumanizing stereotypes of the “enemy” and foster vicious cycles of retaliation. Donald Hickey writes:\n\nThe plunder, burning, and atrocities committed by both sides left a legacy of bitterness and hatred that persisted long after the war was over. This was especially true on the Niagara River frontier. Such was the devastation on both sides of the river that Canadians and Americans living there probably suffered more from this war than people living anywhere else.[54]\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought with primitive weapons by today’s standards: muskets that took twenty seconds to reload and would often misfire; rifles that took even longer to reload but were more accurate; swords, bayonets, and pistols for close range fighting; and cannons (called guns), mortars, and rockets for longer range assaults and warship battles. These weapons took their toll, to be sure, but the more frequent killer was disease. According to Alan Taylor, “only 3 percent of the American troops died in combat and 8 percent died of disease.” The debased conditions in the military camps at Buffalo and Black Rock (Niagara region) in the fall of 1812 prompted one soldier to quip, “everything that is sure to rid man of life is here practiced.” As Taylor writes, “Afflicted by colds, dysentery, measles, pleurisy, and pneumonia, many soldiers were finished off by a typhoid fever. They died so fast that coffin makers and grave diggers could not keep up.” The prevalence of disease, in turn, fostered desertion, as many “would rather take the chance of being shot for desertion, than to fall a certain prey to disease,” in the words of U.S. General Morgan Lewis. Donald Hickey estimates that the desertion rate for American land forces (regulars, militia, and short-term volunteers) “was probably around 20 percent,” while the rate for British land forces was “perhaps around 15 percent.”[55]\n\nProviding soldiers with food rations, clean water, adequate shelter, fuel, blankets, clothing, shoes, and medical care required an immense effort. Food was often in short supply, especially on the Canadian side. According to Jon Latimer:\n\nFood production in Upper Canada was barely above subsistence levels in the best of years, and mobilizing the militia distorted and reduced production. For example, in the summer of 1814 commissariat officers in central Upper Canada had to feed 4,949 regulars and 527 militia in eight widely scattered posts. Doing this required 75 tons of flour to provide bread for thirty days, while the Indians assembled at Burlington Heights would require about the same . . . All these people would consume almost 1,000 head of cattle, but the farmers of Burlington Heights were estimated to have only 300 between them in September 1813. . . . Every militiaman mobilized was another mouth to feed and one less to work the fields; British reinforcements only exacerbated the problem, which increased the farther west they moved.[56]\n\nOn the American side, food scarcity was more a problem of distribution than of production. “Long supply lines, seasonal swings in weather, frontier underdevelopment, and a corrupt contracting system combined to limit the food that Americans could accumulate for their northern armies,” writes Taylor. The private contracting system was repeatedly denounced as “corrupt and destructive” by American commanders. General Edmund Gaines insisted that the army “lost more men by the badness of the provisions, than by the fire of the enemy.” American armies on the march were particularly likely to suffer shortages. The common remedy was to steal from the local populace. “Each American invasion attempt on Canada trailed ruination in its path,” writes Latimer. In the fall of 1813, for example, as General James Wilkinson’s 7,000-man army moved along the St. Lawrence River, U.S. troops helped themselves to civilian stores of grain, vegetables, and meat, tore down fence rails for firewood, and also stole personal valuables. “Worse still,” writes Dianne Graves, “some of Wilkinson’s men robbed and raped the pregnant wife of the Church of England primate of Upper Canada, the Reverend John Strachan, at Cornwall in November of that year.” Such actions turned Canadian civilians against the invaders. As American troops made their way across the Canadian Niagara region, one American regular officer complained, “The whole population is against us; not a foraging party but is fired on, and not infrequently returns with missing numbers.”[57]\n\nIn addition to plundering the “enemy,” both sides preyed on their own communities when short of food and fuel. Joseph Ellicott, a resident in the Niagara River region, described the situation in the fall of 1812: “The fact is our own [American] Troops have destroyed all the farms within the vicinity of their Encampments, plundered the people of their corn and their potatoes, and many farms are laid in open common by having all their rails consumed.” In the town of Buffalo, notes Taylor, “infuriated citizens established a night watch, which shot and wounded four pilfering soldiers, further inflaming tensions between citizens and their supposed defenders.” British soldiers were similarly disposed to steal from the communities they were sworn to protect. Pigs, sheep, apples, and even honey would disappear upon their arrival.[58]\n\nWomen were not expected to fight in the war, but many participated in the support networks that surrounded every army camp. “In the United States and Canada,” writes Hickey, “women fed and nursed soldiers and civilians who participated in the war, managed businesses and farms when their men were gone . . . and in general performed a number of support services that were vital to the war effort.” Those tasks included “cooking, sewing, washing, cleaning, nursing, and hauling food and water to the front lines.” On occasion, women also took part in the fighting. Most notable among the latter was Fanny Doyle, the wife of an American artillery private who had been recently captured in battle. After obtaining permission from the commanding officer at Fort Niagara, she took part in a fierce artillery duel on November 21, 1812, working from dawn to dusk on the exposed gun deck loading six-pound cannon balls to be fired at Fort George. Her actions won her praise from officers and soldiers, and a place in history.[509\n\nCasualties\n\nThe War of 1812 lasted two years and eight months, from June 18, 1812, when President James Madison signed the declaration of war, to February 16, 1815, when Congress ratified the Treaty of Ghent. The total number of military and civilian deaths attributed to the war is estimated at over 35,000, according to the Encyclopedia of the War of 1812 (2012).[60]\n\nCASUALTIESUnited StatesBritain & CanadaNative AmericansKilled in action or died of wounds2,2602,0001,500Died of disease or accident13,0008,0008,500Wounded4,5053,500UnknownMissing6951,000Unknown\n\nAlthough the casualties of this war were small in comparison to the massive casualties of the Napoleonic Wars, they were significant in proportion to the population at the time. The death toll of some 15,000 Americans in proportion to a population of roughly eight million (circa 1813) places the War of 1812 as the third most lethal foreign war in U.S. history.[61]\n\nU.S. warsU.S. population (midway thru war)Deaths per 1,000 peopleWar for Independence3 million8.3World War II138 million2.9War of 1812 8 million1.9 World War I100 million1.2Vietnam War203 million0.3\n\nOn the Canadian side, if as many as 5,500 of the 10,000 who perished were Canadian residents, as distinct from British troops stationed in Canada, then the War of 1812 would top Canadian and American charts in terms of proportional losses, with ten out of every 1,000 Canadians dying in the War of 1812. (The approximate population of the five Canadian provinces in 1813 was 550,000, with 90,000 in Upper Canada, 325,000 in Lower Canada, and 135,000 in the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.)[62] The proportional losses for Native Americans were greatest. More than two dozen tribes and about 10,000 warriors participated in the War of 1812. According to the historian J. C. A. Stagg:\n\nIn all, as many as 3,500 warriors may have been killed on the northwestern and southwestern frontiers of the United States and possibly another 10,000 Indian men, women, and children could have died as a result of the war-related diseases and starvation that were always more regular features of Indian life than they were for Americans or Canadians. Many of the small Indian nations, such as the Shawnee, lacked the demographic depth to absorb such losses, and if the total population of all the Indian peoples involved in the war was in the region of seventy-five thousand, their casualties can be described only as disastrous.[63]\n\nThe staggering proportion of deaths for the First Nations that participated in the war – perhaps one out of every eight persons – produced a desired outcome for U.S. expansionists. Western tribes, said Secretary of War John C. Calhoun after the war, “have, in great measure, ceased to be an object of terror, and have become that of commiseration.” As Donald Hickey writes:\n\nNever again would Indians seriously threaten the United States, and never again would a foreign nation tamper with American Indians. The subjugation of the Indians, in turn, promoted manifest destiny and the westward movement. The heady nationalism and expansionism that characterized American foreign policy throughout the nineteenth century was at least partly a result of the War of 1812.[64]\n\nMilitary and naval campaigns\n\nThe Madison administration was ill-prepared to launch an invasion of Canada in June 1812. The U.S. lacked adequate funding, an efficient bureaucracy, a dependable supply network, competent military leadership, and sufficient military forces and training. The administration hoped, even expected, that Canadians would offer little resistance to a U.S. takeover. The U.S., after all, had a 15-to-one population advantage over Canada and British forces were preoccupied in Europe. The First Nations who later allied with the British remained uncommitted at the outset of the war. The conquest of Canada, the administration hoped, would be quick and easy.\n\nThe U. S. Army had about 13,000 soldiers and officers at the outset of the war, while the British maintained about 7,000 regulars in Canada, including 1,600 in Upper Canada.[65] The small size of the U.S. Army was due in large part to the reigning idea of the time, embraced especially by Democratic Republicans, that large, standing armies were undesirable. Not only were they expensive to maintain (requiring taxes), but they also tempted leaders to engage in unnecessary wars abroad and to assume undue governmental powers at home. In lieu of a standing army, Americans placed great faith in citizen-based militias. The British were similarly forced to rely on Canadian citizen militias, given the shortage of regular troops. The British conscripted Canadian men of fighting age, while the U.S. offered money and land bounties to encourage enlistment.\n\nThe U.S. Navy was in somewhat better shape than the U.S. Army, having fought naval battles in the Quasi-War with France (1798-1801) and the First Barbary War (1801-1805). It was nevertheless far inferior to the British Royal Navy in terms of the number and quality of warships. At the outset of the War of 1812, the U.S. Navy had about twenty small- to medium-sized warships along with 7,200 sailors and marines. The Royal Navy had 584 ships, including 102 heavily armed ships-of-the-line.[66] Although the great majority of Royal Navy ships were deployed elsewhere, the British had enough ships under its North American command at Halifax to blockade American seaports and prevent any amphibious assault on Quebec, the capital of Lower Canada. The British advantage on the Great Lakes was less pronounced. U.S. naval forces gained control of Lake Erie in September 1813 and maintained equality with the Royal Navy on Lake Ontario. This limited naval achievement enabled the U.S. to thwart a British counteroffensive at Plattsburgh in September 1814.\n\nThe American-Canadian front\n\nThe Madison administration devised a three-part plan for the conquest of Canada. U.S. forces under Brigadier General William Hull would cross the Detroit River and take Fort Amherstburg. A second force would cross the Niagara River and take Queenston Heights; and a third force led by Major General Henry Dearborn would move up the St. Lawrence River and take Montreal. If the third invasion were successful, the British would be denied access to Upper Canada (Great Lakes region) and the U.S. would be in a position to move against Quebec and Lower Canada.\n\nThe first invasion began less than three weeks after the U.S. declared war. General Hull, the governor of Michigan Territory, crossed the Detroit River with 2,200 regulars and militia, and set up camp at Sandwich (Windsor) just across the border. There was no immediate opposition, only a protest by 200 Ohio militiamen who refused to join the invasion. On July 12, 1812, Hull issued a proclamation to the townspeople designed to both persuade and threaten residents into accepting American rule:\n\nThe army under my Command has invaded your Country and the standard of the United States waves on the territory of Canada. . . . Separated by an immense ocean and an extensive Wilderness from Great Britain you have no participation in her counsels, no interest in her conduct. You have felt her Tyranny, you have seen her injustices . . . You will be emancipated from Tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified status of freemen. . . . If contrary to your own interest and the just expectation of my country, you should take part in the approaching contest, you will be considered and treated as enemies and the horrors, and calamities of War will stalk you. . . . No white man found fighting by the Side of an Indian will be taken prisoner. Instant destruction will be his Lot.[67]\n\nHull hoped to thwart an Indian-Canadian alliance, but events were already moving in the opposite direction. On July 17, the American fort at Michilimackinac, on the northern tip of Michigan Territory, was surrendered to a combined force of 45 British regulars, 200 Canadian militia, and 400 First Nation warriors – all without firing a shot. Unaware that war had been declared, the American commander, Lieutenant Porter Hanks, and his men had been terrorized by the sight and sounds of Indians in the distance yelling and discharging their guns. Fearing a massacre, Hanks surrendered to British Captain Charles Roberts, who paroled all of Porter’s men except for three British deserters. The fort was an important way station in the Indian fur trade and its seizure convinced a number of tribes that their future lay with the British Canadians rather than the invading Americans. The same message was promoted by Tecumseh and Canadian agents such as Robert Dickson, who had great credibility with the tribes due to his role in distributing goods to starving Indians the previous winter.[68]\n\nWith the fall of Fort Michilmackinac, hundreds of First Nation warriors – Ottawa, Ojibwa, Potawatomi, Sauk, Fox, Sioux, Menominee, and Winnebago – made their way to the Detroit area to join forces with Major General Isaac Brock’s British regulars and Canadian militia. On August 5, Tecumseh and a small group of Shawnee and Ottawa warriors ambushed and killed about twenty American soldiers on their way to Fort Detroit, suffering only one killed. With American supply lines in jeopardy, General Hull ordered a retreat to American Fort Detroit "
