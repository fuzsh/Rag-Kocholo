        "text": "The war went on for months and in November of 1804 Capt. John Rodgers (15 items) took command. Rodgers eventually forced a peace treaty with the pirates which was signed on the deck of the Constitution. This first foreign victory for the U.S. Navy is immortalized in the Marine Anthem - “From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.” Rodgers turned over command to Capt. Hugh Campbell (2 items) on May 29th, 1806. But the Constitution’s greatest victory lay ahead, during the War of 1812.\n\nOn July 12, 1812, less than a month after war was declared with Great Britain, the Constitution embarked on her most famous adventure. At the helm was Capt. Isaac Hull (who had served previously under Capt. Talbot.) Five days out Capt. Hull encountered a British squadron of ships just south of New York. They immediately gave chase and Hull was forced to flee. The HMS Guerriere, a 38-gun frigate, was closest to the Constitution and was soon gaining on it. Then the winds suddenly died down and the Constitution was becalmed. Hull ordered his crew to man the boats and tow the Constitution away from her pursuing predators. Hull was able to escape to Boston but the two ships were destined to meet again.\n\nStewart returned to Boston and the USS Constitution was heralded for her undefeated record and extraordinary accomplishments. Though she returned to the sea under three different Captains - Jacob Jones (4 items), Thomas Macdonough (2 items), and Daniel Patterson (4 items) -she saw no real action and was formally put into reserve in July 1828. Rumors spread that the Constitution was to be put to scrap but in 1830 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an inspiring poem, “Old Ironsides,” which galvanized public opinion and the Constitution was preserved. In the following years she undertook numerous diplomatic and ceremonial voyages around the world and became a training ship for the U.S. Navy. In 1940, under the orders of President Roosevelt, the USS Constitution was recommissioned once again. She is now the oldest commissioned ship in the world still afloat.\n\nA Passion for Preservation\n\nThe items described here barely scratch the surface of the vast trove of documents contained in this collection. Following a similar pathway for the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813 you can find dozens of items. There are also hundreds of documents related to the Civil War, scientific explorations, the Mexican American war and other events. Further examination might provide the basis for new or revised scholarly work about naval history.\n\nSo why did FDR spend so much time and money acquiring this enormous cache of rare naval documents? Partly to satisfy his passion for naval history and his insatiable appetite for collecting things. He also wanted to preserve these relics of the past for future generations. These precious parchments offered FDR a tactile link to America’s seafaring past – the swashbuckling privateers and the freedom fighting patriots who stood at the helm through tempests and hurricanes, who braved cannon fire and mutiny to defend our nation and explore the world.\n\nOrganizing this collection was one of the hobbies FDR hoped to return to when he finally left the White House – which is why he had them stored at his presidential library. After 75 years, this collection remains little known and deserves re-examination and further study. It is worthy of broader promotion as an important source for naval history. It is also a fascinating glimpse into FDR’s passion for collecting and preserving all aspects of American Naval History.\n\nTranscriptions of some of the documents can be found here - https://www.history.navy.mil/research/publications/publications-by-subject/naval-documents-of-the-american-revolution.html - the Naval Documents of the American Revolution. FDR's collection was just one among the many repositories used in this important multi-volume series (currently covering 1775 to 1778.)\n\nTo date essentially nothing has been digitized, and to do so would require raising significant private funds. If this article helps raise awareness perhaps it can also help find financial support.\n\nThe mission of the National Archives and the FDR Library and Museum is to “drive openness, cultivate public participation, and strengthen our nation’s democracy through public access to high-value records.” We seek to “Make Access Happen” by inviting any historian or scholar to come and explore this remarkable resource. Help us better understand what treasures FDR buried here. History awaits you.\n\nMore Information\n\nThe library’s finding aid for FDR’s naval manuscripts can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.fdrlibrary.org/ documents/356632/390886/ findingaid_roos_ navalmanuscripts.pdf\n\nAnd a pdf of the finding aid for another smaller collection of FDR’s historical manuscripts, with an overview of the collection, can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.fdrlibrary.org/ documents/356632/390886/ findingaid_roos_ histmanuscripts.pdf"
