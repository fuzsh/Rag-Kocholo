        "text": "This is a List of War of 1812 battles, organized chronologically and by the theater in which they occurred.[NB 1]\n\nMajor Theaters of the War[]\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought in four major theaters on the North American continent: the Atlantic Coast, the American-Canadian border, the Gulf Coast and the American West. In addition to these continental theaters of action, there were also numerous ship-to-ship battles at sea, almost all of them in the Atlantic.\n\nActions along the American-Canadian border occurred in three sectors (from west to east): the old Northwest Territory (plus the portion of southwestern Ontario adjacent to the Detroit River), the Niagara Frontier (including the adjacent coast lines of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in Upper Canada, New York and Pennsylvania), and the St. Lawrence River (including locations in Lower Canada and New York).\n\nBattles (chronological order within theater)[]\n\n1812[]\n\nAmerican Northwest[]\n\nCapture of the Cuyahoga Packet (July 2, 1812): The capture on the Detroit River of the American merchant schooner Cuyahoga Packet. The American vessel contained official documents with information valuable to the British belonging to Brigadier General William Hull. Hull was unaware that war had been declared when he dispatched the schooner.\n\nCapture of Michilimackinac Island (July 17, 1812): The bloodless capture of Fort Mackinac on Michilimackinac (Mackinac) Island by a British force consisting of a small number of regulars, about two hundred fur traders and four hundred Chippawa, Menominee, Ottawa, Sioux, and Winnebago warriors. The Americans surrendered without firing a shot.\n\nHull's Campaign on the Detroit River (May–August, 1812): A lackluster attempt by Brigadier General William Hull to invade Upper Canada across the Detroit River. After successfully crossing the river on July 12, the Americans never pressed the attack on the out-numbered British force at Fort Amherstburg, and withdrew back to Detroit when Hull learned of the imminent arrival of British reinforcements under the command of Major General Isaac Brock.\n\nSkirmish at Brownstown, Michigan Territory (August 5, 1812): A British victory in which a small force, including twenty-five warriors under Tecumseh, ambushed two hundred Ohio militiamen at a small Wyandot village (located near present-day Gibraltar about twenty miles south of Detroit), who were on their way to escort a supply train from Frenchtown (near present-day Monroe) headed for Detroit.\n\nSkirmish at Maguaga, Michigan Territory (August 9, 1812): The first land battle of the war in which the Americans held their own. It occurred when an American detachment sent to Maguaga (a Wyandot village near present-day Wyandotte) to reopen the supply line between Frenchtown (present-day Monroe) and Detroit was ambushed by a British force including both regulars and native warriors under Tecumseh.\n\nMassacre at Fort Dearborn, Illinois Territory (August 15, 1812): A massacre carried out by Potawatomi and Menominee warriors following the evacuation of Fort Dearborn (at the location of present-day Chicago), ordered by Brigadier General William Hull upon learning that Fort Mackinac had been captured by the British. The garrison was attempting to march to Ft. Wayne, Indiana Territory, when the attack occurred about a mile and a half south of Fort Dearborn.\n\nCapture of Detroit, Michigan Territory (August 16, 1812): A startling and humiliating defeat for the Americans. Brigadier General William Hull surrendered Detroit without a fight, despite having a larger force under his command than the force under Major General Isaac Brock, his British adversary.\n\nMassacre at Pigeon Roost, Indiana Territory (September 3, 1812): An attack by Kickapoo Warriors on a small settlement about a hundred miles south of present-day Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nInvestment of Fort Harrison, Indiana Territory (September 3–16, 1812): The first American victory in the war on land. The fort (located on the Wabash River just north of present-day Terre Haute, Indiana) defended by about sixty officers and men under the command of Captain Zacchary Taylor, was attacked by a large party of Kickapoo, Miami, Potawatomi, Shawnee and Winebago warriors from Prophetstown, Indiana Territory. When a relief part arrived from Vincennes, the Indians withdrew.\n\nInvestment of Fort Wayne, Indiana Territory (September 5–12, 1812): An unsuccessful attempt by about six hundred warriors from the Ottawa Nations to infiltrate and attack the American garrison at Fort Wayne at the confluence of the Maumee, St. Joseph and St. Mary Rivers in northeastern Indiana Territory.\n\nHarrison's Campaign in the Northwest (September 17, 1812 – October, 1813): A campaign tasked with reestablishing security in the Old Northwest and retaking Detroit following Brigadier General William Hull's disastrous performance as commander of the army on the Detroit frontier. Even before taking command of the Northwestern American army, William Henry Harrison (commissioned as a Brigadier General in August, 1812, and promoted to Major General in March, 1813) had begun the process establishing supply bases in northern Ohio and sending detachments of infantry to protect American forts that were threatened by Indians allied with the British. He oversaw the construction of Fort Meigs in early 1813, secured his supply line, and reoccupied Detroit following the American naval victory on Lake Erie.\n\nDestruction of Prophetstown, Indiana Territory (November 19, 1812): An attack ordered by Brigadier General William Henry Harrison on the Indian settlement near the junction of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers north of present-day Lafayette, Indiana, that had been the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in November, 1811. The village was not occupied at the time of the attack.\n\nBattle on the Mississinewa River, Indiana Territory (December 17–18, 1812): A battle that occurred during an expedition against Delaware and Miami villages at a location where the Mississinewa River flows into the Wabash River near present-day Marion, Indiana.\n\nNiagara Frontier[]\n\nFirst British raid at Charlotte, New York, at the mouth of the Genesee River (October 1, 1812): A raid by a British landing party from the Royal George, in which the British seized the American merchantman Lady Murray and a smaller boat, with no resistance from the small American force present.\n\nCapture of HMS Caledonia (1807) and HMS Detroit (1812) at Ft. Erie, Upper Canada (October 9, 1812): A successful raid conducted by about a hundred American troops who crossed the Niagara River from Buffalo and captured two Provincial Marine brigs that had just arrived at Fort Erie. The Caledonia was sailed safely to Black Rock on the American side of the river, whereas the Detroit ran aground at the southern tip of Squaw Island and was set on fire before the British could recapture it.\n\nBattle of Queenston Heights, Upper Canada (November 13, 1812): A major American defeat suffered when Major General Sephen Van Renssalaer attempted to capture Queenston on the west (Canadian) side of the Niagara River, seven miles from its mouth. Major General Isaac Brock, \"the hero of Upper Canada,\" was killed during the battle.\n\nSkirmish at Frenchman's Creek, Upper Canada (November 28, 1812): An American raid across intended to prepare the ground for a subsequent invasion of Upper Canada across the Niagara River. The objectives were to spike British artillery at Red House to enable the American landing to occur without being subjected to artillery fire, and to destroy a bridge over Frenchman's Creek to prevent the movement of British reinforcements. The first objective was accomplished; the second was not.\n\nSmyth's failed invasion of Upper Canada (November 28 – December 1, 1812): A debacle for the Americans, caused by poor planning and poor leadership by Brigadier General Alexander Smyth. Immediately following the action at Frenchman's Creek and again on December 1, Smyth tried and failed to get his invasion force assembled and into boats to cross the Niagara River and invade Upper Canada, following which he cancelled the entire operation.\n\nSt. Lawrence River[]\n\nOccurrence at Carleton Island (June 26, 1812): An unusual incident in which a private American citizen, two other men, and a boy captured a British sergeant and three privates of the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion on Carleton Island, an island in the upper St. Lawrence River about ten miles east of Kingston, Upper Canada, that had been ceded to the United States in 1794. These were the first prisoners taken in the war.\n\nFirst attack on Sackets Harbor, New York (July 19, 1812): An unsuccessful British naval attack on Sackets Harbor, a small port at the eastern end of Lake Ontario and the location of an American naval base.\n\nBattle of the Julia versus the Earl of Moria and the Duke of Gloucester on the St. Lawrence River (July 31, 1812): A standoff between a small American schooner, the Julia, and two larger British ships heading downriver toward Ogdensburg, New York, to attack six American schooners moored there. After a three-hour exchange of fire off Elizabethtown, New York, the British ships broke off the engagement, and the Julia retired to Ogdensburg.\n\nSkirmish at Touissant's Island in the St. Lawrence River (September 16, 1812): A failed attempt by a small force of Americans from Ogdensburg, New York, to intercept a British supply convoy of forty bateaux coming up the St. Lawrence River.\n\nRaid at Gananoque, Upper Canada (September 21, 1812): A successful raid by American troops from Sackets Harbor on the British depot at Gananoque, about twenty miles from Kingston down the St. Lawrence River.\n\nFirst attack on Ogdensburg, New York (October 4, 1812): A failed British amphibious attack on Ogdensburg, a transshipment point for supplies being moved along the St. Lawrence River, repelled by American artillery.\n\nSkirmishes at Akwesasne and French Mills (October 23 – November 23, 1812): A temporary victory by New York State Militia who captured a British post at Akwesasne, an Indian community that straddled the St. Lawrence River in a location where the present-day borders of Ontario, Quebec and New York State intersect. It, and the nearby American post at French Mills, were recaptured a month later by a small British force carrying supplies up the St. Lawrence River.\n\nSkirmish at Lacolle, Lower Canada (November 20, 1812): An indecisive skirmish at Lacolle, a small village on the Lacolle River about five miles north of the New York border. Despite the ambiguity in the outcome, the Americans retreated back to Champlain, and Maj. Gen. Henry Dearborn called off his planned invasion of Lower Canada.\n\nAmerican West[]\n\nInvestment of Fort Madison, Missouri Territory (September 5–12, 1812): An unsuccessful attempt by Sauk and Fox warriors to capture a fort on the upper Mississippi River at the location of present-day Fort Madison, Iowa.\n\nNaval Battles[]\n\nUSS Nautilus (1799) versus HMS Shannon (1806) (July 17, 1812): The first capture of an American ship by the British during the war. The American brig Nautilus was pursued and captured by the British frigate Shannon (1806), which was part of a five-ship British squadron that also included HMS Africa, Aeolis, Belvidera, and Guerrière that was cruising off the coast of New Jersey.\n\nUSS Essex (1799) versus HMS Alert (August 13, 1812): A battle off the Azores in which the British sloop Alert surrendered to the American frigate Essex after an engagement lasting only about eight minutes.\n\nUSS Constitution versus HMS Guerrière (August 19, 1812): The first capture of a British frigate by an American ship. After an engagement of less than three hours about five hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland, the British frigate Guerrière surrendered to the American frigate Constitution.\n\nUSS Wasp (1807) versus HMS Frolic (October 18, 1812): An engagement about three hundred miles north of Bermuda that caused serious damage to both ships. The British sloop surrendered only after being boarded by a party from the American sloop. Later in the day, while crews from both ships were making repair, HMS Poictiers captured the Wasp and recaptured the Frolic.\n\nUSS Wasp (1807) versus HMS Poictiers (1809) (October 18, 1812): The capture of the American sloop Wasp and the recapture of the British sloop Frolic by the British only hours after the Frolic had been captured by the Wasp.\n\nUSS United States versus HMS Macedonian (October 25, 1812): A two-hour long engagement about five hundred miles west of the Canary Islands, which ended when the British frigate Macedonian surrendered to the American frigate United States, which was on an independent cruise. The Macedonian was towed to New London, Connecticut, and purchased by the U. S. Navy.\n\nUSS Vixen (1803) versus HMS Southampton (1757) (November 22, 1812): The pursuit and eventual capture of the American brig Vixen, cruising about ninety miles east of St. Augustine, Florida, by the British frigate Southampton. Several days of bad weather prevented the conclusion of the surrender, and both vessels were wrecked on a shoal near Concepcíon Island on November 27. The crews were rescued and taken to Jamaica.\n\nUSS Constitution versus HMS Java (1811) (December 29, 1812): A two-and-a-half-hour battle off the coast of Brazil during which the British 38-gun fifth-rate Java suffered such serious damage that its captain ordered it scuttled.\n\n1813[]\n\nAtlantic Coast[]\n\nWarren's Chesapeake Bay Campaign (March–September, 1813): A major naval initiative, commanded by Admiral Sir John Warren, with the goals of blockading Chesapeake Bay, gathering intelligence concerning American strength, destroying the USN Constitution, interrupting commercial traffic within Chesapeake Bay, capturing of American vessels and supplies useful to the British and eventually extending the blockade to include Delaware Bay and Long Island. Although Warren remained the senior commander, many of operations were conducted by ships under the command of Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane was much hated by the Americans because of his aggressive actions on-shore, such as destroying the private property of civilians in villages and towns that opposed his landings.\n\nBattle of the Rappahannock River, Virginia (April 3, 1813): A British foray up the Rappahannock River, which empties into Chesapeake Bay forty miles north of Hampton, Virginia, during which they captured or destroyed fourteen American ships.\n\nRaid at Frenchtown, Maryland (April 29, 1813): A raid conducted by a British landing party during Sir John Warren's harassing operations in Chesapeake Bay (March–September, 1813) on a small settlement about fifteen miles up the Elk River on the road between Baltimore and Philadelphia.\n\nRaid on Havre de Grace and Principio Foundry, Maryland (May 3, 1813): A raid conducted by a flotilla of boats under Rear Admiral George Cockburn's command.

This defensive victory thwarted a British attempt to occupy the port city of Norfolk.\n\nCapture and occupation of Hampton, Virginia (June 25–26, 1813): The successful British occupation of Hampton, Virginia, following their humiliating failure to secure Craney Island. During the one-day occupation of the town, the British took guns, ammunition, wagons, horses, livestock and other foodstuff, and in addition were reported to have participated in looting, vandalism, raping and killing. British casualties were 5 killed/33 wounded/10 missing.[1]\n\nRaid at Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina (July 12–16, 1813): A successful British naval operation in the Ocracoke Inlet, a channel through the Outer Banks off the coast of North Carolina into Pimlico Sound, a route used by American merchantmen during the British blockade of Chesapeake Bay.

The battle came to be known as the Raison River Massacre on account of the massacre the following morning of numerous American wounded waiting to be transported to Fort Malden. This defeat caused Brigadier General William Henry Harrison to end his winter campaign to recapture Detroit.\n\nSiege of Fort Meigs, Ohio (May 1–9, 1813): An unsuccessful attempt by a British force consisting of regulars, militia and over a thousand warriors commanded by Tecumseh to capture the recently construct fort at the rapids on the Maumee River about twelve miles from its mouth (near present-day Perrysburg, Ohio).\n\nInvestment of Fort Meigs, Ohio (July 21–28, 1813): A second unsuccessful attempt by the British to capture the fort, this time by a force containing more than three thousand warriors from the Fox, Menominee, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Sac, Sioux and Winnebago Nations under the command of Tecumseh.\n\nBall's Battle, Ohio (July 30, 1813): A battle that erupted between a party of Indians loyal to the British and an American force (including Pennsylvania volunteers under the command of Maj.

The entire American force withdrew by May 8, but only after vandalizing and looting much of the town and burning the buildings of the provincial legislature. The burning of the Capitol Building during the British raid on Washington was retribution for the American actions in York.\n\nBattle of Fort George, Upper Canada (May 27, 1813): An American victory in which Fort George, the western-most British fort on Lake Ontario, located at the mouth of the Niagara River, was captured during an amphibious attack across the river by troops from Fort Niagara on the American side of the river.\n\nBattle of Stoney Creek, Upper Canada (June 6, 1813): A British victory achieved by a night attack on American troops encamped at the mouth of Stoney Creek, a creek flowing north into the western end of Lake Ontario about forty miles west of Fort George.
