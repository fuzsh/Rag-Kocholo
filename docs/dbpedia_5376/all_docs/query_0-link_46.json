        "text": "...while the main body was disembarking at the ferry, the Americans fell back, and, although pursued for several miles, escaped with the loss of a few prisoners... After taking on board all the tobacco and other stores found in the place, with a quantity of cattle, and destroying all the store-houses and buildings, the rear-admiral re-embarked; and dropping down to another point of the Nominy river, observed some movements on shore. Upon this he again landed with the marines. The Americans fired a volley, but, on the advance of the marines, fled into the woods.\n\nEvery thing in the neighbourhood was therefore destroyed or brought off; and, after visiting the country in several other directions, covering the escape of the negroes who were anxious to join him, the rear-admiral quitted the river, and returned to the ships with 135 refugee negroes, two captured schooners, a large quantity of tobacco, dry goods, and cattle, and a few prisoners.\n\nThe Nomini Creek raid occurred after the British had failed to capture Norfolk and Portsmouth, where the USS Constellation and the Gosport Navy Yard were military targets. The British attack on Norfolk and Portsmouth was repulsed at the mouth of the Elizabeth River on June 22, 1813. The Americans fortified Craney Island, and the British had to capture it in order to sail up the Elizabeth River channel.\n\nThe British had a divided command which planned and led the failed assault on the Craney Island fortifications. Colonel Sir Sidney Beckwith was responsible for the soldiers. Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren was in charge of the navy, with Rear Admiral George Cockburn as his second-in-command. They timed the attack badly.\n\nBeckwith's 800 troops included the 102md Regiment, Royal Marines, plus the 1st and 2nd Independent Companies of Foreigners. The Independent Companies had ben formed with French prisoners and deserters brought from Europe.\n\nThe British force landed near the Nansemond River and marched to the western edge of Craney Island. At the Thoroughfare, the channel separating Craney Island from the mainland, they were blocked by high water. American artillery forced a retreat, but some of the Independent Company soldiers deserted rather than return to the British ships.\n\nOn the east side of Craney Island, the two navy leaders launched an amphibious assault. 15 barges loaded with 500 troops headed to shore, rowing against an ebb tide. The boats grounded on mudflats as the water level dropped, and became easy targets for American guns. The British barges with Congreve rockets and cannon, which could have returned fire against the Craney Island fortifications, were at the back of the flotilla and could not be used. The amphibious assault, like the effort on the west side of Craney Island, was a total failure.5\n\nHoffler's Creek and Craney Island have been transformed since the Battle of Craney Island in 1814\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nThe British took out their revenge of that loss on Hampton three days later, attacking and occupying that city between June 25-27, 1813. The Independent Companies were assigned to outpost duties, and were not under the direct supervision of British officers.\n\nThe French units were undisciplined, and both enlisted men and officers deserted. An unusually uncontrolled level of looting and rape occured:6\n\n...it appears that, in the course of a 24-hour period, they killed at least one and perhaps a second American prisoner in cold blood, murdered an elderly man, wounded his wife and another older man, and sexually assaulted between five and seven American women besides robbing several civilian residences. There was never much doubt that the Independent Companies were responsible for these crimes as they spoke French and were dressed in green uniforms unlike the rest of Beckwith's troops who were clad in the more normal red or blue, and thus witnesses were able to easily identify them. Most of the crimes took place in and around isolated farmhouses outside Hampton...\n\nAn English officer wrote in his diary:7\n\nEvery horror was perpetrated with impunity - rape, murder, pillage - and not a man was punished.\n\nWhen challenged in a letter from an American officer to explain the behavior of the British forces, a different British officer defended the actions by claiming they were justified retaliation. The officer asserted that American cruelty during the battle at Craney Island justified what happened at Hampton as appropriate retaliation:8\n\n...the excesses of which you complain at Hampton were occasioned by a proceeding of so extraordinary a nature that if I had not been an eyewitness I could not have credited it. At the recent attempt on Craney Island, the troops in a barge sunk by the fire of your guns clung to the wreck of the boat. Several Americans, I assure you most solemnly, waded off from the Island and, in presence of all engaged, fired upon and shot these poor fellows. With a feeling natural to such a proceeding, the men of that corps landed at Hampton.\n\nA British officer made a claim which the Americans declared to be false:9\n\nOne boat with thirty of the foreigners stranded with a shot through her, and the Americans, wading to it, deliberately massacred the poor men!\n\nthe British raided up the Potomac River in 1814, reaching Alexandria after the burning of public buildings in Washington\n\nSource: Perry-Castaneda Library Map Collection, Campaigns of the War of 1812 (\"Historical Atlas\" by William R. Shepherd, 1923)\n\nThough war was declared in 1812, the British were stretched thin by the war in Europe and North America until Napoleon was defeated in 1814. During the 1813 Chesapeake Bay expedition, Colonel Sir Sidney Beckwith had only 2,000 soldiers in Bermuda that he could use in the American campaign.\n\nOne way to gain extra manpower was to recruit French soldiers who had been captured in Europe, and French conscripts who had deserted to the British. Those French prisoners/deserters who were willing to serve in the British Army were organized into Independent Companies of Foreigners. Two companies totaling 300 men were sent to Bermuda and then North America.\n\nAs in the American Revolution, during the war of 1812 British forces were willing to carry enslaved men, women, and children away from their white \"owners\" in Virginia. The British organized formerly enslaved men in the Corps of Colonial Marines, comparable to the Ethiopian Regiment created by Lord Dunmore in the American Revolution in November 1775. On April 2, 1814, Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation saying in part:10\n\nThis is therefore to Give Notice,\n\nThat all those who may be disposed to emigrate from the UNITED STATES will, with their Families, be received on board His Majesty's Ships or Vessels of War, or at the Military Posts that may be established, upon or near the Coast of the UNITED STATES, when they will have their choice of either entering into His Majesty's Sea or Land Forces, or of being sent as FREE settlers to the British Possessions in North America or the West Indies, where they will meet with due encouragement.\n\nOver 3,000 of the enslaved workers escaped to British lines, many to ships that intentionally recruited them. In addition to reducing the labor force of the American opponents, the recruitment forced white men in Virginia and Maryland to stay home. Instead of joining the American army or the militia, slaveowners had to patrol their local area to prevent escapes:11\n\nThe British advertised through word of mouth that they would free any slave who escaped to their ships. During the day, to announce their presence, British ships sailed up and down the coast with their bands playing. At night, they lit up their masts and yardarms, making themselvs visible to those who could steal a boat and escape. Learning that an escaped father would not leave without his wife and children, they accepted whole families.\n\nOf the 3,600 African Americans recruited into the Corps of Colonial Marines, 550-700 were deployed as fighters known as \"Blue Jackets.\" The rest of the recruits were used as laborers. The Corps of Colonial Marines were based on Tangier Island, where they built Fort Albion.\n\nThe first raid by the Corps of Colonial Marines was up Pungoteague Creek on the Eastern Shore. British officers were favorably impressed by the skills of the soldiers.12\n\nthe first raid of the Corps of Colonial Marines was up Pungoteague Creek, north of Hacks Neck on the Eastern Shore\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nThe British Navy launched a three-pronged attack from the Chesapeake Bay in August, 1814. One fleet sailed up the Potomac River, a second headed towards Washington DC via the Patuxent River on the way to Baltimore, while a third raided along the northern edge of the Chesapeake Bay.13\n\nthe primary target of the British Navy in August, 1814 was Baltimore\n\nSource: National Park Service, The fall of Fort Washington and the Battle of White House Landing\n\nAlexandria was occupied in August 28-September 3, 1814, after the British sailed up the Potomac River as another force marched through Maryland and occupied Washington, DC. During the five days of occupation, the British loaded tobacco, flour, and cotton from the warehouses onto captured American merchant ships.\n\nThe terms under which Alexandria's common council surrendered to the British were:14\n\nTerms of Capitulation. His majesty's ship Sea Horse, off Alexandria, 29th August, 1814.\n\nGentlemen -\n\nIn consequences of a deputation yesterday received from the city of Alexandria, requesting favorable terms for the safety of the city, the under mentioned are the only conditions in my power to offer. The town of Alexandria, with the exception of public works, shall not be destroyed, unless hostilities are commenced on the part of the Americans, nor shall the inhabitants be molested in any manner whatever, or their dwelling houses entered, if the following articles are complied with:\n\nAll naval and ordinance stores, public or private, must immediately be delivered up.\n\nPossession will be immediately taken of all the shipping, and their furniture must be sent on board by the owners without delay.\n\nThe vessels that have been sunk must be delivered up in the state they were, on the 19th of August, the day the squadron passing the Kettle Bottoms.\n\nMerchandise of every description must be instantly delivered up, and to prevent any irregularity, that might be committed in its embarkation, the merchants have it at their option to load the vessels generally employed for that purpose, when they shall be towed off by us.\n\nAll merchandise that has been removed from Alexandria, since the 19th inst. is to be included in the above articles.\n\nRefreshments of every description to be supplied [to] the ships, and paid for at the market price, by bills of the British government.\n\nOfficers will be appointed to see that article No. 2, 3, 4 and 5, are strictly complied with, and any deviation of non-compliance, on the part of the inhabitants of Alexandria, will render this treaty null and void.\n\nI have the honor to be, John A. Gordon, Captain of H.M. ship Sea Horse, and senior officer of H.M. ships off Alexandria. To the Common Council of the town of Alexandria.\n\nafter the British Army burned public buildings in Washington DC, Alexandria surrendered to a fleet and allowed its warehouses to be looted\n\nSource: Architect of the Capitol, British Burn the Capitol, 1814\n\nBritish forces landed at Benedict, Maryland, head of navigation on the Patauxent River, on August 19, 1814. They marched to Washington and burned the public buildings there, including the White House and the Capitol.15\n\nThe December 1814 Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812, though news did not reach North American until after the Battle of New Orleans in January, 1815. The treaty was ratified by both sides in February 1815. the USS Constellation was finally able to sail out of the Elizabeth River on March 15, 1815.\n\nSource: The History Chap, The USA - British War of 1812 - A British Perspective\n\nSince the war was over, the British removed whatever materials they could from Fort Albion and burned the rest before sailing to Bermuda. A dispute over what the British removed from Tangier Island was not settled until 11 years later.\n\nArticle 1 of the treaty included:16\n\nAll territory, places, and possessions whatsoever taken by either party from the other during the war, or which may be taken after the signing of this Treaty, excepting only the Islands hereinafter mentioned, shall be restored without delay...\n\nSource: WGTE Public Media, A Battle for the Northwest Frontier | Toledo Stories: War of 1812 in the Old Northwest\n\nThe definition of \"property\" included the enslaved Americans who had fled to the British during the war. When American commissioners arrived at Tangier Island to demand return of people who had escaped slavery, citing Article 1, the British official there reported to his superiors:17\n\nThat part of the first article of the Treaty relative to Slaves is a most melancholy Thing, as I am well Convinced that the American Government, considers that the whole of the Black Battalion, comes within it, and will be given up.\n\nRear Admiral Cockburn refused to abandon the members of the Corps of Colonial Marines or the families that had reached Tangier Island. He issued orders that \"em>on no account a single negro be left except by his request\" for those who had reached Tangier by 4:00pm on February 17, 1815, the moment when the treaty was ratified.\n\nMany enslaved people had already been transported away from Tangier Island before the American Commissioners arrived. James Monroe, the US Secretary of State, send representatives to Nova Scotia, the West Indies, and Bermuda with the intent of interviewing formerly enslaved people and asking if they wanted to return. The hope was that British treatment was so harsh that a voluntary return to enslavement was preferable, but none chose that option.\n\nThe Americans claims under Article 1 were disputed for years by the British, and in 1818 Czar Alexander I of Russia agreed to serve as arbitrator. In 1822, he determined that most of the American claims were valid. In 1826 the British finally paid $1.2 million in compensation. None of the those who escaped slavery were forced to return to the United States. In essence, the British financed freedom for over 3,000 people.18\n\nWhen Francis Scott Key wrote the third verse of \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" now the national anthem, he expressed joy that the American success at Fort McHenry was a defeat for the British effort to recruit enslaved men:19\n\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\n\nFrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\n\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nKey was comfortable with the institution of slavery, and did not view the escape of enslaved people to the British as a search for freedom. After the War of 1812, he was District Attorney in the District of Columbia. Key prosecuted abolitionists who distributed pamphlets mocking the national capital as \"land of the free, home of the oppressed\" rather than the \"the land of the free and the home of the brave.20\n\nThe Chesapeake Bay: Avenue for Attack\n\nCraney Island\n\nDid Enslaved Virginians Choose to Be Loyalists or Revolutionaries in the Revolutionary War?\n\nBritish prisoners from the HMS Saint Domingo were transported from Northumberland County to Richmond in April, 1813\n\nSource: Library of Virginia, War of 1812 Bicentennial Collection\n\nLinks\n\nAlexandria and the War of 1812\n\nA Brief Overview of the War of 1812\n\nLibrary of Virginia\n\nWar of 1812 Pay Roll\n\nNorfolk Towne Assembly\n\nWar of 1812\n\nSmithsonian National Museum of American History\n\nThe War of 1812\n\nSociety of the War of 1812 in Virginia\n\n>a href=\"https://1812va.org/significant-war-of-1812-events-in-virginia/\">Significant Events War of 1812 in Virginia\n\nin 1814, British ships launched this 194-pound bomb at an American gun battery located on what is now Fort Belvoir\n\nSource: Fairfax County Park Authority, The Bomb that Didn't Burst in Air\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"A Brief Overview of the War of 1812,\" American Battlefield Trust, https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/brief-overview-war-1812; \"The Decision at Craney Island,\" American Battlefield Trust, https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/decision-craney-island; \"1813 Chesapeake Campaign,\" National Park Service, https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/1813-chesapeake-campaign.htm; \"1814 Chesapeake Campaign,\" National Park Service, https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/1814-chesapeake-campaign.htm; Myron (Mike) E.
