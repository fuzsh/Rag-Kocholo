        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe battlefield in 2008. 32 pounder from the Carolina.\n\nThe rampart was reconstructed in 1964.\n\nOn the 23d of December, 1814, at half past 1 o'clock in the\n\nafternoon, the sentry at the door of General Jackson's headquarters\n\non Royal street in New Orleans, announced the arrival of three\n\nvisitors who had just come galloping down the street in great haste,\n\nand desired an immediate audience with the General. These visitors\n\nwere Major Gabriel, Colonel De la Ronde and Mr. Dussau de la Croix.\n\nThey brought the stirring news of the approach of the vanguard of\n\nthe British army, which was at that hour encamped on the\n\nVillere plantation, nine miles below the city. These troops included\n\nmany seasoned units of the Duke of Wellington's army, considered\n\nthe best in the world. Jackson was astounded the British could reach\n\nso far without discovery. What Jackson would do next would decide\n\nnot just the fate of New Orleans, but that of the war and quite\n\npossibly the continued existence of America.\n\nAlthough the War of 1812 ended with no territorial or political changes, it is widely considered decisive for the course of the history of North America. The United States faced one of the best armies in the world - the forces of the United Kingdom and managed to defend its territory, and took the first steps in becoming a global power. The most critical battle of this war happened after the peace treaty was signed. During the battle of New Orleans fought in 1815, the future president of US Andrew Jackson led his ragtag undisciplined ragtag force against the worldâ€™s strongest military.\n\n.\n\nThe War of 1812, with the British blockade and American embargo\n\nhad been an economic and military disaster for the Americans.\n\nGoods were rotting on the wharves and the government had\n\ndefaulted on its debt. States in New England were openly discussing\n\nsuccession and making a separate peace with the British. American\n\ninvasions of Canada had been repulsed and far from annexing Canada\n\nnow large parts of Maine were under British control. Even Washington\n\nhad been taken and burned.\n\nView of the American rampart or parapet and the Beauregard\n\nmansion, built in the 1840's. Jackson's headquarters was in the\n\nMaCarty house(where the present day Chalmette Slip is now),\n\nbehind the rampart.\n\nMiracle on the Mississippi: The Battle of New Orleans\n\nThe Possible Consequences if the British took New Orleans\n\nThe British never recognized Napoleon as a legitimate ruler and\n\ndeemed the sale of the vast Louisiana territory to the United States\n\nto be fraudulent. Louisiana must be returned to Britain's ally Spain,\n\nthe former owner, or if Spain was too weak after the European\n\nconflict to administer it, be given the Britain . After taking New\n\nOrleans, the British planned to head up the Mississippi Valley to\n\njoin troops coming down from Canada . Then, the Americans\n\nwould be surrounded and as Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign\n\nsecretary and the architect of the Louisiana invasion, put it ,\n\nwould be \"...little better than prisoners in their own country.\" This\n\nwould probably bring about the end of the fledgling 30 year old\n\nrepublic with its outlandish idea of a democratically elected\n\ngovernment, the only one of its kind in the world.\n\nLord Castlereagh (1769-1822)\n\nBritish Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\n\nLord Castlereagh, who was banqueting in Paris at the time the news\n\nof the burning of Washington was received, exultantly and openly\n\nboasted that it would not be long before Louisiana and the\n\nMississippi River would become the conquered province of Great\n\nBritain ! So certain were the British of success that a small army of\n\nadministrators were sent along with the fleet. British speculators had\n\nbrought ships to carry away the booty of New Orleans, estimated to\n\nbe worth 14 million dollars .\n\nLatour Historical memoir of the war in\n\nWest Florida and Louisiana in 1814-15 .\n\nThe British knew the New Orleans invasion was in the works when\n\nits commissioners left for Ghent to meet with the Americans for\n\npeace negotiations. A victory such as the one anticipated would\n\nallow the British to dictate peace terms. A neutral Indian state\n\nbuffer was to be created and territory in the Great Lakes were to be\n\nadded to Canada. Perhaps a new British colony could be established\n\nin Louisiana or New Orleans at least could be detached to the\n\nempire, giving the British a stranglehold on the Mississippi. The\n\nprice of peace could have been ceding the Louisiana Purchase\n\nterritory to the British, setting up a Louisiana \"India.\"\n\n\"The Battle of New Orleans\" from \"Hero Tales from American History\" by Theodore Roosevelt .\n\nThis video was shot entirely on location. The locations used were:\n\nChalmette BattlefieldNational Historic Park,\n\nChalmette Living History Park, Forts Toulouse/Jackson\n\nState Park, and on board Privateer Lynx.\n\n\"Mr. Clay, one of the Commissioners of the Treaty of Ghent,\n\nhad but little faith in the honor of the British Government,\n\nknowing that its treaty obligations were never respected whenever\n\nconflicting with its interest and policy. He is said to have\n\nexpressed the belief that, if General Jackson had been defeated at\n\nNew Orleans, with the Mississippi River in possession of the British\n\nfleet, England would no more have hesitated to nullify the Treaty of\n\nGhent than she did the Treaty of Amiens with Bonaparte. It is fair to\n\npresume, therefore, from the great effort that England made for the\n\nconquest of Louisiana, that if the British flag had ever once floated\n\nover New Orleans it would never have been hauled down without a\n\nstruggle.\"\n\nThe history of the wonderful battle of the brig-of-war\n\nGeneral Armstrong with a British squadron, at Fayal, 1814\n\nSamuel Reid, 1893\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans was the last major battle of the War of\n\n1812, which was declared on June 16, 1812. The decisive American\n\nvictory at New Orleans restored American confidence in their new\n\nrepublic after the burning of Washington and other defeats in the\n\nwar. It made Jackson a popular hero and made him the first populist\n\npresident. The battle is largely forgotten in England, a sideshow\n\novershadowed by the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPatriotic Fire : Andrew Jackson and Jean\n\nLaffite at the Battle of New Orleans\n\nWinston Groom 2006\n\nGroom is a novelist (Forrest Gump) and popular historian, with\n\na string of well-reviewed books on war . He is also a descendant of\n\nElijah Montgomery, who served in Jackson's army. He has written a stirring and\n\noften moving account of the battle and the events surrounding it, and his main focus\n\nis on the roles and personalities of Jackson and the enigmatic pirate\n\nturned patriot, Laffite .\n\n.\n\nThe British did not really accept the fact of American independence and felt if it\n\nweren't for the threat of Napoleon, would had dealt with the upstart republic already.\n\nThe British were also irritated that the Americans did not join them in the war\n\nagainst Napoleon, and viewed the Americans as cowardly and greedy wa\n\nr profiteers. Stopping and searching American ships to impress English sailors\n\n( and sometimes Americans as well ), a major cause of the war, showed the\n\ncontempt for which they held the Americans.\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson\n\nand America's First Military Victory\n\nRobert V. Remini 1999\n\nRobert Remini, a noted and prolific scholar on Andrew Jackson, has narrowed\n\nhis focus to write a colorful and informative account of the Battle of New Orleans .\n\nA share of the booty from the rich city of New Orleans could set an officer up with a\n\nnice estate and soldiers could count on a nice payday as well. This lure made the\n\nBritish put up with awful conditions: a long 36 hour, 60 mile row from the fleet,\n\ncamping out in cold, wet conditions and bravely marching into a maelstrom of\n\nwithering fire. The women of New Orleans took to carrying daggers\n\nafter hearing the tales of looting and raping that occurred after\n\nbattles in such places as Hampton, Virginia on June 26, 1813 by\n\nBritish soldiers.\n\nThe War of 1812\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans on Jan 8, 1815 was a major British\n\ndefeat in which a British army of around 10,000 with around 8,000\n\ndeployed was repulsed by an American force of around 3,000. The\n\nBattle left nearly 300 British dead and 13 Americans killed. This\n\nwas a small battle compared to those in the Napoleonic Wars, bu\n\nt large for North America at the time.\n\nThe British were making objections at the negotiations to drag\n\nthe process out, counting on a victory at New Orleans . A British\n\nvictory might even tip the New England states into succeeding,\n\nperhaps even ending the American 'experiment and bring the\n\ncolonies back into the English fold. Louisiana was sold by\n\nNapoleon to the United States in 1803 for $15 million.\n\nIn 1812, it became the 18th state admitted to the Union. Barely a\n\nmonth after admission, President James Madison declared war\n\nagainst the British. The embargo and subsequent British blockade\n\nmade smugglers such as Jean Lafitte rich, but there was little\n\naction till the British planned to invade in 1814. The war had\n\nbeen a disaster for the Americans up to this point. The embargo\n\nand blockade wrecked the economy, the invasions of Canada had\n\nfailed and Washington itself had been invaded and the\n\nWhite House burned . New England states were threatening"
