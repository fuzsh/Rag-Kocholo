        "text": "The Times-Picayune is marking the tricentennial of New Orleans with its ongoing 300 for 300 project, running through 2018 and highlighting the moments and people that connect and inspire us. Today, the series continues with the arrival in town of the SS President.\n\nTHEN: In 1941, the President came to New Orleans -- but it wasn't FDR, who was the nation's commander in chief at the time. It was better. It was the SS President, a sidewheel riverboat that over the next 47 years would become a New Orleans landmark. Built in 1924 as the Cincinnati, it was rechristened the President in 1929. More importantly, it was renovated to become what was billed as the largest excursion boat in the country, featuring a grand ballroom with a bandstand -- key features for the countless concerts and moonlight cruises the vessel would host over its four decades as one of New Orleans' most unique music venues.\n\nNOW: In 1985, the President was sold by its longtime owner, the Strekfus Co., and set sail for St. Louis, Mo., splitting its time between the Gateway City and the Crescent City for three years. By 1991, she had been converted into a riverboat casino operating out of Davenport, Iowa. Decommissioned in 2000, she was cut into pieces in 2009 and moved to St. Elmo, Ill., where her new owner hopes to reassemble her one day as a dry-docked entertainment venue.\n\nAlthough it began its permanent residency in New Orleans in 1941, the 297-foot President wasn't exactly a stranger to the city at that time. From 1933 to 1940, it wintered in the city after spending the spring and summer in St. Louis.\n\nIt's a basic fact: One of the few things that people in New Orleans enjoy more than good food and good music is the sharing of that good food and music with others. For nearly a half-century, the riverboat President facilitated that, and in a unique venue that combined locals' love for celebration with our elemental connection to the river. Although it's long gone, the President isn't forgotten. Just ask any local resident of a certain age about it, and listen as the memories come rushing back. For the record, the 2009 disassembly of the SS President was captured on tape for a Season 4 episode of the documentary series \"Monster Moves.\" It can be viewed online. Fair warning: Watching it might break your heart."
