The Havannah initially served in the Napoleonic Wars.2 By October 1814, Captain William Hamilton3 of the Royal Navy sailed the Havannah to the Chesapeake Bay. He commanded the ships in Virginia's Yeocomico River,4 which fed into the Potomac River. A graduate of the University of Dublin, Hamilton appeared in records as William Rowan Hamilton and as Gowen/Gawen William Hamilton,5 and had begun his service in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic Wars.6\n\nBy January 15, 1815, the Havannah and the flagship Orlando were both stationed in the Potomac River.7 The Havannah had also sent an auxiliary ship, a \"tender,\" up the Rapahannock River in Virginia. On January 16th, Captain John Clavell of the Orlando reported that the crews on his ship and on the Havannah were ill from lack of \"fresh beef.\"8\n\nOn February 19th, Mathias Clarke's slave, Nathaniel Johnson, escaped to the Havannah. By this time, the vessel was lying near St. George's Island by the mouth of the St. Mary's River, and was visible from Clarke's home, Trinity Manor.9 Clarke's son, Robert Clarke, who was living at Trinity Manor at the time, reported the following: \"Three boats from the Havannah were seen descending on the Potomack, shortly after they landed, and plundered the Inhabitants of Stock Poultry, &ca. On their return one of their boats, containing eight or ten men, commanded by an Officer, landed at the house of Mr. George Loker.\"10 The barge returned to the Havannah with seven of Loker's slaves, namely Leah Hantes, Lucy Hall and her daughter, and Margaret Clem and her three daughters. An eighth slave, Jerry Lynch, joined the ship later that day.\n\nOn February 27th, the slaveholders George Loker, Mathias Clarke, Robert Clarke, Captain William Smith, and Peter U. Thompson caught up with the Havannah in Lynhaven Bay at the Virginia Capes.11 Peter W. Thompson estimated about one hundred slaves on board the Havannah.12 When George Loker confronted Captain Hamilton with a copy of the Treaty of Ghent, Hamilton responded that \"he would read nothing from him or his government.\"13 Hamilton further responded that \"No Negros would be restored unless we caused the Seamen to be given up, who had recently deserted from his ship.\" However, he agreed to return the escaped slaves if they themselves consented. They refused, and Captain Hamilton transferred them to the Orlando on the same day.14\n\nThe event prompted Captain Hamilton to write to the Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, explaining that he had taken the slaves before he knew about the Treaty of Ghent. Hamilton also petitioned on the slaves' behalf: \"I hope Sir you will excuse my mentioning that should it be thought necessary that these people should be paid for, or returned, the Officers and Men of this ship would prefer making a Subscription to pay for them, to returning them to the cruel punishment they expect.\"15\n\nAt the end of the War of 1812, Captain Hamilton returned to England with the Havannah as a flag ship, carrying Admiral Sir Edward Codrington.16 He then sailed the Havannah to St. Helena to guard the exiled Napoleon Bonaparte.17\n\n1.
