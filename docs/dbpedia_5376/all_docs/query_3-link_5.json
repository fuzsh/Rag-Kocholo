        "text": "Hello.\n\nI am new to the forum so please forgive me if this has been discussed elsewhere. My question is about the figurehead(s) for the USS President. I read in \"American Figureheads and Their Carvers,\" the the original figurehead was of George Washington sitting on a rock, 'supported' by two female full-length figure representing Justice and Truth. My question is, was this always the figurehead? I know after the British captured it and rebuilt it identical in 1819, it had a figurehead of John Adams. Was this on the President prior to its capture? I'm just curious to know more about this. I attached some pictures of the Adams figurehead.\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\nThere are two contemporary drawings of the USS President - captured in 1815 in the NMM existing\n\nPresident (capture 1815)​\n\nScale: 1:48.
