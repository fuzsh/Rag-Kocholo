Let’s just say the pace is never slow.\n\nI wanted to give you a sense of what those more-than 1 million miles have looked like these past seven years. So I’ve pulled together some of my favorite shots from the road. Take a look, and I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.\n\nAnd, if you’d like to see more new photos — along with some more from the past seven years of the Vice Presidency — I just launched my official Instagram account. You can follow along here.\n\nLooking forward to sharing more photos with you.\n\n-David"
