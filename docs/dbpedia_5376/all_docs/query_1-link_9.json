        "text": "The frigate President, commanded by Stephen Decatur, encounters HMS Endymion out of New York and attempts to board her, not realizing the War of 1812 ended with the Treaty of Ghent in Dec. 1814. After British reinforcements arrive, Decatur is forced to surrender.\n\nIn a joint amphibious force with the Union army, Rear Adm. David D. Porter and Maj. Gen. Alfred H. Terry capture Fort Fisher, Wilmington, N.C., which is the last port by which supplies from Europe could reach Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lees troops at Richmond, Va."
