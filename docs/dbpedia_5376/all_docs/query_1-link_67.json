        "text": "Andrew Jackson Papers\n\nThe Andrew Jackson Papers contain more than 26,000 items dating from 1767 to 1874. Included are memoranda, journals, speeches, military records, land deeds, and miscellaneous printed matter, as well as correspondence reflecting Jackson’s personal life and career as a politician, military officer, president, slave holder and property owner. The Andrew Jackson Papers collection documents Jackson's life in its several phases, including Jackson's military career in the War of 1812.\n\nSelected Digitized Books\n\nThis is a growing collection of selected books and other materials from the Library of Congress General Collections that can be made openly available, including over 100 books that discuss the War of 1812\n\nJames Madison Papers, 1723 to 1859\n\nThe James Madison Papers consist of approximately 12,000 items captured in some 72,000 digital images. They document the life of the man who came to be known as the \"Father of the Constitution\" through correspondence, personal notes, drafts of letters and legislation, an autobiography, legal and financial documents, and miscellaneous manuscripts. Correspondence and notes trace his two terms as the fourth president of the United States, illuminating the origins and course of the War of 1812, including copies of letters written by Madison to Secretary of War John Armstrong.\n\nJames Monroe Papers\n\nThe James Monroe Papers at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress consist of approximately 5,200 items dating from 1758 to 1839. Monroe (1758–1831) was the fifth president of the United States, and one of 23 presidents whose papers are at the Library of Congress.\n\nMilitary Battles and Campaigns\n\nThis collection contains maps showing campaigns of major military conflicts including troop movements, defensive structures and groundworks, roads to and from sites of military engagements, campsites, and local buildings, topography and vegetation. Some of the maps are manuscripts drawn on the field of battle, while others are engraved including some that have manuscript annotations reflecting the history of the battle or campaign. This collection contains thirty maps related to the War of 1812.\n\nEarly American Sheet Music\n\nThe Library of Congress classification number M1.A1 includes music printed or 'copied in manuscript' in the United States or the colonies through 1820. As an early record of musical life in America and the colonies, this classification number holds many interesting popular and topical pieces, including four pieces related to the War of 1812.\n\nPatriotic Melodies\n\nPatriotic Melodies tells the stories behind many of the songs that have now become part of the American national heritage. A combination of hymns, national songs, music of the theater, radio and television, military themes, and poetry, all of this music demonstrates that while over history many things have changed, this expression of pride and hope remain a constant part of the American experience. The collection contains early printings of the \"Star Spangled Banner\", as well as an essay on its history. Francis Scott Key’s experience during the bombardment of Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814, inspired him to pen the words to “The Star-Spangled Banner.”"
