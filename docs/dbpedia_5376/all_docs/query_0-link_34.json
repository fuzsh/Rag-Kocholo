        "text": "Hi Alice-\n\nThanks for your time and efforts. As best I can tell... William Fleming was out of the Navy by 1818 but he did have a son named John to whom he gifted the book in 1828. John was born in 1793 and was a sailing man. He certainly could be the John J. Fleming who served on the Sloop Peacock in 1818. I'll do some digging there.\n\nWas able today to identify The Pomone's Sailing Master Wetherall's first name... \"Thomas\". He is the one who returned one of the two volumes of the Mackay works seized by Captain John Richard Lumley, to William Fleming. I discovered that first name after looking in the British National Archives. They reported on a United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Archive holding describing maps aboard the HMS Pomone from 1812 to 1814.\n\nThis is an interesting story... I almost get the feeling that William just took it for granted that those knowing the history/later reading his account of the seizure of his vessel and navigational items would also know the context of his service and the vessel he was on.... thus he did not write it down.\n\nI wish he had written the vessel's name and been more specific date-wise than \"the late War of 1812\". He is not listed in the very scant crew list of the the USS President on the \"Threedecks\" website, but since he gave up his commission in 1801, he may have easily been a warrant officer at that point and be lost to history amongst the 400+ crew of the President when she was seized by the HMS Pomone [Captain John Richard Lumley].\n\nA fascinating book... I thought that folks would enjoy seeing some pictures.\n\nDear Mr. Foster,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nUnfortunately, the Navy Department did not create any centralized register or service records for enlisted sailors and warrant officers during the War of 1812. We searched the National Archives Catalog and located Service Records for the War of 1812, 1919? - 1947? in the Naval Records Collection of the Office of Naval Records and Library (Record Group 45) which are the product of a 20th century attempt to compile information about sailors from various sources. The project was discontinued before it was completed. There may be a file for him in this series, but most sailors are not included in it.\n\nWe also located Muster Rolls and Payrolls for U.S. Navy Vessels, 1798 - 1860 in the Naval Records Collection of the Office of Naval Records and Library (Record Group 45) that include records relating to sailors serving on Navy ships. Because these records are arranged by ship rather than names of individuals, finding information about individual sailors is time consuming unless you already have the names of the ships on which they served.\n\nIn addition, we located the Subject Files, ca. 1924 - ca. 1946 (documenting ca. 1775 - 1927) in Record Group 45 that includes records relating to Americans taken prisoner by the British. This series is arranged according to alphabetical classification schemes developed by the Office of Naval Records and Library - “R” means Prisoners and Prisons (including Prison Ships) and ”RA” refers to Prisoners of War Rolls and Lists (U.S. Nationals). We suggest that you begin with “RA” section.\n\nNext, we located the Register of Expenses Incurred by American Prisoners of War in England, 1812 - 1814; Registers of American and French Prisoners of War Held by the British at Halifax, Barbados, and Jamaica, 1904 - 1904 (documenting 11/1805 - 3/1815); and Copy of Register of U.S. Prisoners of War Held at Quebec, 1923 - 1923 (documenting 1813 - 1815) in Record Group 45.\n\nThe National Archives has very limited records of privateers and merchant vessels from this time period. We located Logs and Journals of American Privateers and State Navy and Merchant Vessels, 1798 - 1938 in Record Group 45, however this series includes only three privateers that operated during the War of 1812.\n\nFor more information about all of the records listed above, please email the National Archives at Washington, DC - Textual Reference (RDT1) at Archives1reference@nara.gov. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to guidance received from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA has adjusted its normal operations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work while also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of NARA staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may experience a delay in receiving an initial acknowledgement as well as a substantive response to your reference request from RDT1. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\n\nFurther, we suggest that you contact the National Archives of the United Kingdom for records concerning ships and prisoners taken by the HMS Pomone.\n\nThe majority of the records of American privateer and merchant ships were either not preserved or are in the custody of various non-federal institutions and private individuals. For example, the Noah Scovell Papers In the New Bedford Whaling Museum Research Library includes records relating to several merchant and privateer vessels from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. That museum as well as other maritime museums and institutions such as the National Maritime Historical Society may be able to offer further research advice.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your research!"
