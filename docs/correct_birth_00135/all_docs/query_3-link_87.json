Orwell's inspiration ● The fables of Aesop or La Fontaine Literary sources Third and fourth books of Gulliver's Travels ● Animal Farm shows how the initial idealism of the revolution gradually decayed into O inequality, hierarchy and finally dictatorship. This decay of the revolution is always seen from the community's point of view, never from the pigs' one NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR ● 1984 is about totalitarianism ● ● ● ● ● ● ● there's some sort of war going on, who no one really understands what it's about O rockets frequently explode in the streets and blow people to bits The worst part is that the government is always watching everything ● there are posters of big brother ● O A government in which one person tries to control every aspect of life how people spend every minute of their time even in private ■ who they can associate with ■ what they're allowed to say ■ what people think and what they believe ● ■ ● George Orwell wrote 1984 in the late 1948 what he knew about totalitarianism was based on the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany O That had come into being not that long before and they weren't very well understood yet what Orwell was trying to do with 1984 was to give his readers a clear picture of what life would be like if a free country like England were under a totalitarian rule 1984 takes place in London, which is described as O a depressing place O Where there's never enough to eat O O O the food's disgusting there aren't enough clothes or shoes or anything to go around the city is pretty dilapidated ■ except for these giant pyramid shaped government buildings that rise above the landscape O attend pep rallies including this one called \"the two minutes hate\" So it's hard to even have time to think your own thoughts ● because they're constantly filling your head with propaganda the main character of 1984 is Winston Smith O he's 39, he has a job in the government, without any friends or anyone in his life at the beginning of the book he starts writing a diary to talk about how much he hates life in his society O even though writing a diary is one of those things he'd be killed for doing The diary is his place for thinking about his society O who's supposedly the leader of the government O that say BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU there are police who have hidden cameras and microphones literally everywhere the government can watch you in your home through your TV screen O and you're not allowed to turn your TV off ever there are a lot of things you're not allowed to do in this society if you do them the police might take you away and throw you into a forced labour camp you're not allowed to O have close friends O be in love O date or have sex with someone you like you're basically supposed to save all your emotional energy for the party O Which is the government then there are things you have to do O watch the government programming on TV most of its news some of its exercises O it's a place where he tries to imagine if life could possibly be different from the way it is there's no way for him to know if things were ever different before O because the government has changed all the records of the past and rewritten all the history books ■ ● ● ● ● At the beginning of the novel there are two people who matter to Winston and he doesn't even know either of them O One of them is Julia O the other person he's interested in is O'Brien ■ who's a member of the inner party that means he's a boss much higher up than Winston Winston should be afraid of this guy but he gets the sense that O'Brien is intelligent so he has this yearning to be friends with him ■ He thinks O'Brien would understand how he feels about life O ■ When Julia slips Winston a note that says \"I love you\", it completely rocks Winston's world O he can't wait to get in touch with her but it's very hard for them to say two words to each other in private with all these spies and cameras everywhere finally they do manage to get out to the country and they start this mad love affair O which makes them both very happy Though it's dangerous because they could be killed or sent to labour camps if they get caught but that makes it more exciting ■ at last Winston has someone who understand and who hates the party as much as he does O ■ ■ An attractive young woman who works in the same building as him as a mechanic Winston basically hates her because she's pretty and he can't have her but he also thinks she's the sort of person who would turn him in to the thought police ● so he's afraid of her but also sort of fascinated O but he needs to go that extra step: now he wants to be an active rebel against the government he gets his chance one day, when O'Brien invites him to his apartment to look at something work-related O Winston takes a leap of faith and guesses that O'Brien must be part of the rebellion because no one invites people over to their home so he and Julia go to O'Brien's house and confess that they want to be rebels O O'Brien says \"yes I'm a rebel too\" O they have all read this book that explains why things are the way they are Winston reads the book and he's blown away by it unfortunately right after he reads it, the thought police bust in and arrest him and Julia O and carry them off to the Ministry of Love to torture them O'Brien wasn't a rebel, he just wanted to catch Winston in the Ministry of love they torture Winston in all sorts of horrible ways O they break his bones and his teeth O they use electric shock O they starve him he tells them everything he knows, he confesses to everything they ask him, and he tells them everything he knows about Julia O after torturing him over and over, O'Brien tells Winston what it is that the government really wants: what they want is to have total power over the minds of people like Winston ■ they want people like Winston to say 2+2 equals 5 and really believe it ■ not just say it to avoid a beating for the government ■ it's purely an exercise in power ■ they're not trying to control his mind for some other purpose ■ they just want to exercise total power over people's minds ● they finally do break Winston completely in this place called room 101 O where they do whatever it is you're most afraid of ■ ■ they lock his face into a cage and let rats eat their way through his face he has a phobia of rats so he loses it and says \"do it to Julia not me\" which is a complete betrayal of what's most important to him the government has taken his last shred of integrity after he does that O they let him and Julia go ● ● ● ● ● ● ANALYSIS ● ● the thought police don't care about them anymore the two of them meet on the outside but they can't love each other anymore Winston and Julia are basically broken people after they get out Winston has changed to the point that he doesn't even want to think about anything that might be rebellious ● he just sits in a cafe listening to the news and smiling the last words of the novel are \"he loved Big Brother\" O a human being can be broken down completely O until he'll believe whatever you tell him O even if it's that two plus two equals five At the same time the book has a positive message: O ● Life in a big totalitarian system, Oceania (North ica, South Africa, Australia) Airstrip One, a future England, is an outpost of Oceania. SETTING: O London, in the mythical country of Oceania, 1984 (in the future). ■ It's a desolated city governed by terror and constant control of BIG BROTHER. Oceania is a huge country ruled by The Party. The Inner Party (1% of population) controls the country. The Outer Party (18% of population) is controlled by the Inner Party. The Proles (81% of population) are the labour power who live in poverty. O it's really hard to get inside someone's head the government has to go to incredible lengths to brainwash NEWSPEAK: O is the official language of Oceania (replacing Oldspeak, standard English). O eliminates undesirable words and invents new words - all to force Party conformity. ■ Aim: to eliminate literature, thoughts and consciousness. DOUBLETHINK: O is the manipulation of the mind by making people accept contradictions. O makes people believe that the Party is the only institution that knows right from wrong. THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH O where Winston works O changes history, facts, and memories to promote Doublethink THE NAME: ● BIG BROTHER: O ■ O \"Smith\" is the commonest English surname, so the hero is a sort of Everyman. O \"Winston\" evokes Churchill's patriotic appeals during the Second World War: ■ \"blood, sweat and tears\". ■ THEMES: he looks like a combination of Hitler and Stalin (MORPHY EFFECT) O Big Brother's God-like image is stamped on coins and projected on telescreens His gaze is unavoidable. AIM: Big Brother is the perceived ruler of Oceania O O O Importance of memory and trust. O Abolishment of individuality and reality. O Satire against hierarchical societies. STYLE AND TONE: ■ O Documentary realism O Parody and satire O Pessimistic tone To inform and reveal facts and draw conclusions from them. To give an interpretation of reality."
