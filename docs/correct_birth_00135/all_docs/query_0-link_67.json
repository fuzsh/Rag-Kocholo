        "text": "Motihari magistrate Narmadeshwar Lal told IANS over telephone that the government notification has made it clear that Orwell's birthplace has been enlisted by the art and culture department for protection.\n\n\"The district administration has begun renovation work,\" Lal said.\n\nOrwell was born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 at his ancestral home in Motihari district, near India's border with Nepal. His father, Richard Blair, worked as an agent of the opium department of the Indian Civil Service during British rule.\n\nThe single-storey house where Orwell spent his childhood has been lying neglected for decades. The crumbling building is home to stray animals and vagabonds. A small portion was taken over by the state government and a schoolteacher now lives there.\n\nLal said the state government has sanctioned a sum of Rs.29 lakh (Rs 2.9 million/35,000 pounds) for its renovation. \"More money is likely to be sanctioned in the coming days,\" he said.\n\nThe notification for its protection has been issued under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments (Protection) Act, 1976.\n\nAccording to the notification issued by the government, the district administration has been directed to start renovation work immediately with the aim of attracting tourists.\n\nDistrict officials as well as local residents say Orwell's birthplace was on the verge of ruin.\n\n\"The house is in a dilapidated condition,\" they said.\n\nIt has been reported time and again that the roofline has bowed and buckled due to years of rain, while a large grapefruit tree has undermined the southern wall.\n\nOnly the stone floor looks solid, though it cracked during an earthquake that almost levelled Motihari in 1934.\n\nAt present, there is nothing to tell visitors that this modest two-room house was where Orwell spent the first few months of his life, tended to by his mother, Ida, and an Indian maid. Orwell and his mother left for Britain soon after."
