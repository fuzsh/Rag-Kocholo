The 'Animal Farm' writer's son Richard Blair said that he is delighted that his father's old house is now under restoration and will be turned into a museum, a museum which will be the only one in the world.

The dilapidated colonial bungalow where the writer was born in 1903 in Motihari, Bihar, is already under restoration, as Bihar government recently announced plans to convert it into a museum dedicated to the author, the Guardian reported. Orwell was born on 25 June 1903 in the three-room house and the property also consists of a few tiny cottages and a large warehouse that was used to store opium. The 'Animal Farm' writer's son Richard Blair said that he is delighted that his father's old house is now under restoration and will be turned into a museum, a museum which will be the only one in the world. He added that for many decades the house was allowed to decay, so it's only to be applauded that the Bihar government now sees fit to put money into the project. Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair, was a year old when his mother, Ida Blair, moved with him to Oxfordshire and he never visited his birthplace again. The house would have turned to rubble were it not for a campaign by a Motihari businessman, Debapriya Mookherjee, to convert it to a memorial. (ANI)"
