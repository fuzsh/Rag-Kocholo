        "text": "Eric Arthur Blair, known by his pen name of George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic.\n\nBest known for his political social criticism in his writing and his outspoken nature, his novels of Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) are still as prevalent in the literary world today as they were when first written.\n\nHe was an influential figure in the rise of English political criticism and democratic socialism. In 2008, The Times ranked George Orwell as second among ‘The 50 greatest British writers since 1945’.\n\nRead more: The Nazi bombing raids which killed 53 in Ipswich\n\nDespite being born in British India in 1903, because his Father was responsible for monitoring the production and distribution of opium across India, Orwell had a strong connection to the beautiful coastal town of Southwold in Suffolk.\n\nIn 1921, his retired father, mother and sister Avril had moved from Oxfordshire to 40, Stradbroke Road, Southwold. Orwell was enrolled by his father in the local crammer school (a test-prep school) called Craighurst so that he could train to become a member of the Indian Imperial Police.\n\nOrwell never stayed in Southwold long. He spent the next several years travelling. During this time he lived in Burma with the Indian Imperial Police but resigned in 1927 to his Father's discontent, then living in Paris and London.\n\nIn December 1929, after nearly two years living in Paris, Orwell came back to the fresh air of the Suffolk coast. He returned to his parents’ home and lived in Southwold for the next five years.\n\nThe Blair family were well established in the pretty coastal town. His sister Avril owned a tea house called The Copper Kettle Tea Room on Queen Street with his father a member of the golf club and exclusive ‘Blyth Club’ to which tradesmen could not join. The town at this time was inhabited by many middle-class old Indian Imperial families.\n\nIn 1932, the family bought Montague House in High Street, which now has a plaque attached in his honour.\n\nWhile living in Southwold, his second novel, ‘A Clergyman’s Daughter’ (1935) was completed. It is believed that some of Southwold’s influence made it into his work.\n\nKnype Hill is believed to be the fictional name for Southwold in the novel and Ye Olde Tea Shoppe is based on his sister's tea house.\n\nThe character of Dorothy Hare is modelled on the gym mistress of St Felix School, whom he had proposed to several times, each time being refused.\n\nThe character of Julia in Nineteen Eighty-Four is also believed to have been inspired by a woman called Eleanor Jacques, who was a neighbour to the family when they lived on Stradbroke Road, Southwold.\n\nDespite all the years he had spent in Southwold, ‘A Clergyman’s Daughter’ criticises the upper-middle-class colonialist air of a stifling town where Orwell didn’t want to be.\n\nIn fact, he was treated with scorn by the inhabitants of Southwold. His family were disappointed by his lack of a professional job and he was known by the locals as a scruffy womaniser with little prospects.\n\nOn one occasion, he was chased through the town by a man on a motorbike for unwelcome attention to his fiancée.\n\nAfter the novel was published, he unsurprisingly took off again to London and died there in 1950 at the age of 46.\n\nTo him, Southwold reeked of families who recalled the good ol’ days of British colonialism and middle-class ideologies.\n\nOrwell was a political thinker who believed in democratic socialism. It is unsurprising that he never fit in at Southwold, though he is commemorated there today as one of the town’s greatest inhabitants."
