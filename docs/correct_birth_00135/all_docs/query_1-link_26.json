        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1903–50). English novelist, essayist, and critic George Orwell was famous for his novels Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-four (1949). Both became classics that remained popular into the 21st century.\n\nGeorge Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25, 1903, at Montihari in Bengal, India, where his father was a minor British official. His family had social status but little money. This fact influenced Orwell’s later attitude toward the English class system and the British Empire’s treatment of its subject peoples. About 1911 the family returned to England. Blair went to a boarding school in Sussex, where he was distinguished both by his poverty and his intelligence. He later wrote of his miserable school years in the essay “Such, Such Were the Joys” (1953). He attended Eton College from 1917 to 1921 but decided against pursuing a university degree. Instead, in 1922 he went to Burma (now Myanmar) as a member of the British imperial police.\n\nEarly Works\n\nBlair’s own poverty, plus his growing aversion to Britain’s imperial policies, led him to resign from the government in 1928. Blair then spent several years among the poor and outcast of Europe and among the unemployed miners in the north of England. He recounted these experiences in Down and Out in Paris and London (1933). In the book he rearranged actual incidents into something like fiction. This is the first work he published using the pen name George Orwell. (He derived the name Orwell from the River Orwell in East Anglia, a traditional region of eastern England.) The book’s publication earned him some initial literary recognition.\n\nOrwell’s first novel, Burmese Days (1934), portrays a sensitive but emotionally isolated individual at odds with an oppressive social environment. Orwell would follow this formula in his subsequent work, including A Clergyman’s Daughter (1935) and Keep the Aspidistra Flying (1936). In The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), Orwell returned to writing about the destitute and unemployed. He combined reporting with a tone of anger that was to characterize his subsequent writing.\n\nBy the time The Road to Wigan Pier was in print, Orwell was in Spain. He went as a journalist to report on the Civil War there and stayed to join the Republican militia. He was seriously wounded in battle, and damage to his throat permanently affected his voice. Orwell later fought in Barcelona against communists who were trying to suppress their political opponents. In May 1937 he was forced to flee Spain in fear of his life. He described his experiences in Spain in Homage to Catalonia (1938), which many consider one of his best books.\n\nAfter returning to England, Orwell wrote Coming Up for Air (1939). In it he explored the decency of a past England and expressed fears about a future threatened by war and fascism. When World War II began, Orwell was rejected for military service because of poor health. Instead, he headed the Indian service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He left the BBC in 1943 and became literary editor of the Tribune, a socialist newspaper. During this period Orwell was a prolific journalist, writing many newspaper articles and reviews. He also wrote serious criticism and a number of books about England.\n\nAnimal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-four\n\nIn 1944 Orwell finished Animal Farm, but he did not find a publisher for it until the next year. The novel is a political fable based on the Russian Revolution and its betrayal by Joseph Stalin. The book follows a group of barnyard animals who overthrow and chase off their exploitative human masters. They then set up a society of their own where everyone is equal. Eventually, however, the pigs desire more power. They form a dictatorship even more oppressive and heartless than that of their former human masters. The success of Animal Farm allowed Orwell to devote himself to writing.\n\nOrwell’s last book was Nineteen Eighty-four (1949). The novel is set in an imaginary future in which the world is dominated by three warring totalitarian police states. The book’s hero, the Englishman Winston Smith, holds a minor party office in one of those states. To keep its rule, the government distorts the truth and rewrites history to suit its own purposes. Smith’s longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government. Smith has a love affair with a woman who shares his views, but then they are both arrested by the Thought Police. Smith is subsequently imprisoned and tortured. The process is intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to rid him of his independence and destroy his dignity and humanity. The government’s ultimate goal is to make him love only the figure he previously hated—the apparent leader of the party, Big Brother.\n\nOrwell wrote the last pages of Nineteen Eighty-four in a remote house on Jura, one of the Hebrides islands of Scotland. At times he was hospitalized for tuberculosis. He died of the disease in a hospital in London, England, on January 21, 1950."
