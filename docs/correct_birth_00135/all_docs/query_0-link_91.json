        "text": "Patna: Millions of literature lovers settled across the globe have a new reason to cheer. A government in Bihar has decided to convert the decrepit two-room birth place of celebrated English writer George Orwell into a museum.\n\nOrwell who penned cult classics like Animal Farm and 1984 was born as Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 in Motihari town in Bihar's east Champaran district where his father Richard W Blair was posted as deputy for the opium warehouse during the British period. Orwell spent his childhood at this house before he was taken to England by his mother Ida when he was a year old. In later years, he went on to pen one of the last century's best dystopian novels which established him as a Millennium Writer.\n\nOn tour\n\nBihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who is currently touring the northern regions of the state made the announcement on Monday, apparently overwhelmed by the growing demands by his fans who had been pressing for it for long.\n\nKumar also visited the house, watching from close the room where the writer spent his early life, photographs of Orwell's parents hanging from the crumbling wall. He also took a look at some of Orwell's works during the visit.\n\nThe state government has asked the officials to prepare a detailed restoration and development plan of the seven acre campus where Orwell was born.\n\n\"Prepare the blueprint and submit the same at the earliest so that the restoration works can be started soon,\" the chief minister told the officials."
