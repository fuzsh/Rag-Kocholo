MOTIHARI: A large number of people paid floral tributes to British author George Orwell on his 63rd death anniversary here on Tuesday.

Orwell, known for his novels ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘Nineteen Eighty Four’, was born on June 25, 1903 in Motihari. His father, Richard Blair, was posted as an agent of the opium department of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) during the British rule.

Orwell’s statue was garlanded by Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, minister for water resources, and members of Motihari Lake Town Rotary Club near the house where he was born. Releasing the first documentary film at local MS College hall titled ‘Birth place of the millennium writer George Orwell’ and directed by Vishwajeet Mukherjee, Chaudhary said, “His writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy whenever he found it. The author of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four has an opium and a Champaran connection. Motihari today takes twin pride as Gandhi’s workplace and Orwell’s birth place.” Prof Shova Kant Chaudhary said that Orwell was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic and he wrote novels of ideas with comic richness and concern for social justice. Comic exaggeration in all its forms is the keynote of Orwell in particular and literature of ideas of the 20th century in general. He related every experience firmly back to his overriding concern for the poor.”

The 25-minute first documentary on George Orwell’s birth place was screened and hundreds of students and other people saw it. Mukherjee said he used material from the Delhi University library and also interviewed OS patron and adopted Orwell’s son, Richard Blair, for the documentary.
