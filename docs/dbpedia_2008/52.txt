As we head into August, many children, parents and teachers across the U.S. are preparing to begin a new school year. Some may have already started classes. This month, we want to hear from students themselves about what they need to have a successful school year. Your tips could help set the next student up for success.

If you are an elementary, middle or high school student, share your advice with us via the form below, and you could be featured in the Up First newsletter on Aug. 18. You can also share a photo and upload your answers as a voice memo. Please submit responses by Aug. 11.

See some of your responses and others — and get the news you need to start your day — by subscribing to our newsletter.

Your submission will be governed by our general Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. As the Privacy Policy says, we want you to be aware that there may be circumstances in which the exemptions provided under law for journalistic activities or freedom of expression may override privacy rights you might otherwise have.
