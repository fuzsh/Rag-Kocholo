The intention here is to give you detailed fee-waiver language, whereas other templates give cursory treatment to the topic.]\n\n(Date)\n\nAgency Head [or Freedom of Information Act Officer]\n\nName of Agency\n\nAddress of Agency\n\nCity, State, Zip Code\n\nRe: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nDear ___________________:\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552), I am requesting the following documents:\n\n[ICIJ recommendations] Reasonably describe the records and/or information you need. It helps to include names of people and places and the time period relevant to the material. If you know the name or title of the document you seek, include that. Attach any other documents describing your research and specify the form in which you would like to receive the information, such as paper or computer disk.\n\nAs a representative of the news media affiliated with (name of your organization), I am gathering information on (subject) that is of current interest to the public because (briefly state reasons).\n\n[For requesters who are not members of a traditional news organization like a newspaper or television station, consider the following language]: Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. [Freelancers should provide a copy of the publication contract, if you have one, but also note that OMB guidelines say that past publication can be used as proof you are a media representative]. [Public interest groups should consider the following language]: Please also remember that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has determined that even a nonprofit clearinghouse of information can qualify as a representative of the news media, See National Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense, 279 U.S. App. D.C. 308 (D.C. 1989).\n\nPlease note that 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a)(4)(A)(iv)(II) requires that you provide the first 100 copies to me at no charge.\n\nHowever, I am requesting a waiver of all fees under 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The information I seek is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\n\nI believe I meet the criteria for a fee waiver recognized by the U.S. Justice Department – in its policy guidance of April 1987 – and by the federal courts, See Project on Military Procurement v. Department of the Navy, 710 F. Supp. 362 363, 365 (D.C.D. 1989).\n\nMy request concerns the operations or activities of government because É [Per the Justice Department guidelines, be as specific as possible about why your request concerns a government activity as opposed to a mere interest on your part in the subject matter.]\n\nAlso, the information sought has informative value, or potential for contribution to public understanding. Please note the decision in Elizabeth Eudey v. Central Intelligence Agency, 478 F. Supp. 1175 1176 (D.C.D. 1979) (even a single document has the potential for contributing to public understanding). I plan to disseminate this information to the public at large in the following manner: [Detail how you plan to get this information to a broad audience. Public interest requesters should be aware that vague assertions about providing the information to a media outlet probably would not pass muster with the agency or the courts. It will help your cause immensely to provide evidence of past instances where the media has used some of your information]. In addition, the release of this information will have a significant impact on public understanding because É [Detail here where you think there is a lack of knowledge on the part of the public and how this information will make the public better informed about this particular government activity.]\n\nIn your deliberations, please take note of the following cases: Campbell v. U.S. Department of Justice, 334 U.S. App. D.C. (1998)(administrative and seemingly repetitious information is not exempt from fee-waiver consideration); Project on Military Procurement (agencies cannot reject a fee waiver based on the assumption that the information sought is covered by a FOIA exemption; and Landmark Legal Foundation v. Internal Revenue Service, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21722 (D.C.D. 1998)(the fact that the information will soon be turned over to a public body does not exempt the material from fee-waiver consideration).\n\nI look forward to your response within the 20 working days, as outlined by the statute.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nYour name\n\nYour address\n\nDaytime phone number\n\nFax number\n\nE-mail address\n\nback to top\n\n———-\n\nPrivacy Act Request for Access Letter\n\nPrivacy Act Officer [or System of Records Manager]\n\nName of Agency\n\nAddress of Agency\n\nCity, State, Zip Code\n\nRe: Privacy Act Request for Access\n\nDear ___________________:\n\nThis is a request under the Privacy Act of 1974.\n\nI request a copy of any records [or specifically named records] about me maintained at your agency.\n\n[Optional] To help you to locate my records, I have had the following contacts with your agency: [mention job applications, periods of employment, loans or agency programs applied for, etc.].\n\n[Optional] Please consider that this request is also made under the Freedom of Information Act.
