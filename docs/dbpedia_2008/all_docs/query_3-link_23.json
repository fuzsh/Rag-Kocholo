        "text": "Purpose\n\nThe Village of Itasca adopts this policy to govern the use of its social media accounts by the public. This policy outlines the Village's primary objective for its social media accounts, which is to communicate to the public on matters related to Village events and news.\n\nDefinitions\n\nComment: A response to a Village posting or social media content submitted by a commenter.\n\nCommenter: A member of the public who submits a comment in response to specific Village posting or social media content, including links to other websites or social media sites or profiles.\n\nPosts or a posting: Content, information, articles, pictures, videos, or any other form of communication shared on a Village social media site by the Village.\n\nSocial Media Sites: Websites and applications enabling users to share information, including, but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, blogs, forums, discussion boards, and other platforms used for communication or content sharing, encompassing text, music files, movies, photographs, and electronic files.\n\nLimited Public Forum\n\nThe Village lacks staff resources to monitor its social media accounts. Therefore, without deleting any prior posts or comments, the Village no longer operates its social media as a limited public forum. The Village current policy is to disable comments on all posts, as the Village's posts are for informational purposes only. Using social media as forum for government speech complies with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies. This decision is not content-specific but applies to all social media interactions due to limited resources. The Village reserves the right to post questions on the Villageâ€™s website for the specific purpose of soliciting public comment.\n\nComment Policy\n\nBecause social media interactions represent a limited public forum, the Village reserves the right to reject or remove (if feasible) any content in violation of this policy or any applicable law. Content and comments on Village social media accounts containing any of the following elements are prohibited from posting and may be subject to removal:\n\nComments that are off-topic or include links to off-topic material.\n\nComments that include hyperlinks of any kind or direct visitors to view or refer to content from any other source.\n\nContent or language constituting personal attacks, insults, defamation, threats, obscenity, or profanity.\n\nContent promoting discrimination based on race, creed, color, age, religion, gender, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, national origin, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation.\n\nSexual content or links to sexual content.\n\nSolicitations of commerce.\n\nInformation that may compromise safety, disclose confidential government information, sensitive data, or personal information regarding government officials, employees, or the public.\n\nCharitable solicitations or political campaigning.\n\nEncouragement or conduct related to illegal activity.\n\nSpamming or repetitive content, such as posting the same content more than twice in the same location.\n\nContent infringing upon a legal ownership interest, such as a copyright or trademark, of any party.\n\nEach specific social media platform maintains a \"Terms of Use\" agreement. All comments posted on any Village social media platform must comply with these Terms of Use agreements, and the Village reserves the right to report any user violations to the respective social media platform.\n\nContent Removal\n\nContent that violates this policy will be removed from the Village's social media accounts. Any content falling under the category of prohibited content, as outlined in the defined criteria, will be preserved by capturing a screenshot and accompanied by a memo that explains the rationale behind the content's removal.\n\nHours of Use\n\nThe Village's social media platforms are not monitored 24/7, and as a result, posts and responses should not be expected immediately. Users are advised against using the Village's social media accounts to report crimes or emergency situations. Crime reports and requests for police, fire, or emergency medical assistance should be made by dialing 9-1-1. Accounts are traditionally monitored during regular business hours, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays, excluding holidays.\n\nCompliance with Laws\n\nAll Village social media platform users must adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies. Content posted on any Village social media platform by any user may be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, record retention laws, and e-discovery rules."
