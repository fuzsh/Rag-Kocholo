        "text": "Understanding the pros and cons of being interviewed by the media, whether it be print, radio, or television, is your first step to becoming media savvy.\n\nAs a psychologist, you are in the unique position of representing not only yourself but also your profession. The news media are today a critical source of information and education for the public.\n\nParticipating in media interviews will require considerable preparation. But a good interview can reap the benefit of increased public awareness and understanding of a particular issue germane to your work.\n\nUnderstanding the media\n\nAlways remember that the media are in the business of making money. They are looking for a commodity—your knowledge. You have a job to do in an interview, and that is to articulate the information you want the audience to understand. The more complex that information, the harder you will have to work to convey it clearly.\n\nInterviews to turn down\n\nChoose wisely in accepting interviews. You do not need to grant every request.\n\nCarefully consider whether to participate in an interview that\n\nwould compromise you in any way\n\nis out of your range of expertise\n\nis in a panel format\n\nBeware: Panel discussions are often designed by producers to be unruly debates, with panelists hand-picked for extreme points of view.\n\nKnow yourself\n\nGrant a request for an interview only if you want to give the interview.\n\nWhatever your state of mind during the interview, it will show. If you are enthusiastic, you will perform better. If you are uncomfortable, your distress will show; if you are preoccupied, you will come across as uninterested.\n\nYour answers to these questions will help you determine whether you should do the interview:\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish with this interview?\n\nWhat do you want to say about this subject?\n\nWhat do you have to gain by doing it?\n\nWill there be more opportunities for you in the future?\n\nIf you decide not to accept, inform the media representative as soon as possible. All you need to say is \"No, thank you.\"\n\nDon't worry that your decision will be used against you in the future. The media will call again when they need you, and others will call, too.\n\nKnow your message\n\nBefore you start an interview, know exactly what you want to say.\n\nPrepare three to five points you want to make and integrate into answers during the interview. Write them down and practice a few comfortable ways of saying them.\n\nStories or case studies are useful to support a point, but remember to keep them very short. Also, state your conclusions first, and then use your supporting evidence.\n\nIf there are any controversial or easily misinterpreted aspects of your work, roughly frame your answers in these areas beforehand.\n\nDo your homework\n\nWatch the television programs and read the publications for which you would like to be interviewed. Familiarizing yourself with the various formats will help you to better understand the type of news in which the publication or show is interested, the target audience, and the interviewers.\n\nThe preinterview\n\nBecause reporters assigned to psychology and mental health stories do not know the subject area very well, they often will conduct a preinterview. This is an opportunity for you to educate the reporter on the subject area, and your efforts will pay off in the form of good questions based on correct premises during the actual interview.\n\nTIP: Take the preinterview as seriously as the interview. Never underestimate this step.\n\nBefore you are called by a media representative, a producer or editor has decided to do a story that involves your area of expertise. They have collected a list of names from which they will try to find an expert to interview.\n\nThe media representative will likely have limited time in which to find an expert and has one mission: to find the most articulate, knowledgeable, dependable, and media-savvy expert available.\n\nThe four types of media—print, radio, television, and videoconference—handle the preinterview differently.\n\nPrint\n\nThere is no automatic preinterview. The phone rings, and the reporter and his or her questions are there.\n\nMake this call a preinterview by asking the reporter about the area of interest and telling him or her you will have to call back.\n\nReporters are always working against deadlines, so promise to get back quickly, within the hour or later that day, and make sure you do.\n\nUse the time between the first call and your return call to think about what you want to say about the subject area.\n\nRadio\n\nA radio reporter will also telephone and most often want to do an interview right then and there. However, there will be a few minutes of preliminary talk between you and the reporter before he or she actually begins to record your comments (the reporter will let you know when the recorder will be turned on).\n\nThese preliminary few minutes are your preinterview. They are your opportunity to find out from the reporter what the questions will be and to think about your answers.\n\nIf you need more time to prepare, take it. Set up a mutually convenient time for the reporter to call you back and record the interview.\n\nTelevision\n\nWhen you receive a call from a television producer, consider this preinterview an audition. Never take this stage of the process for granted, and only agree to a preinterview once you know how you want to respond.\n\nMake arrangements to call the representative back at a mutually agreed upon time to give yourself time to consider them and your major points.\n\n\"Off the record\"\n\nDon't consider anything you say as \"off the record\" simply because you say it is. Say only what you want in print, and keep confidential information confidential.\n\nIdentifying yourself\n\nEstablish how you want to be identified.\n\nIf you want to be referred to as Dr. Smith, consistently refer to yourself as that. Most media representatives will try to accommodate you, but understand that some print publications have style rules that they follow (e.g., the Wall Street Journal will not identify a psychologist as \"Dr.\").\n\nYou may ask the reporter to identify you as a psychologist first and then subsequently as doctor.\n\nBe very organized and sure about what you want to say and how you want to be quoted. Selecting your main points in advance and sticking to them is key to any successful interview.\n\nRespect that the competent journalist also has an agenda to complete during the interview. Aggressively steering the reporter away from the main line of questioning can be counterproductive. Instead, try to interject new facts, insightful information, and a fresh perspective as you respond to the questions at hand.\n\nWill you receive questions in advance? In most cases, no, because this practice detracts from spontaneity and comes across more like a speech. However, journalists will let you know the subject areas they are after, which will help you shape the story.\n\nDrawing conclusions. Reporters often will ask you to draw conclusions from research that is inconclusive or does not exist. Explain the difference between preliminary research results and \"known\" behavioral science.\n\nRemember also that preliminary research is often more newsworthy than \"known science.\"\n\nIf a question is out of your range of expertise, the best response is \"I don't know.\"\n\nWill you get to read the story before it appears in print? Rarely, and even rarer is the opportunity to edit the story. You may offer to read a story or request to have portions or quotes read back to you as a check for accuracy, but reporters may accept your offer only in cases when your information is highly complex.\n\nTake precautions. If there are any aspects of your work that may easily be misinterpreted, emphasize to the reporter during the interview the importance of such points. Assert the fact that your information may be inaccurate if stated another way.\n\nPreliminary details\n\nA media representative will generally contact you to go over more details and/or to make travel arrangements. The representative may conduct another preinterview to confirm that you are the expert for whom the media are looking.\n\nTry to fly in the day before your interview.\n\nTelevision interviews are often pre-empted by news breaking stories. Don't take it personally; it happens often.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nWear conservative clothing.\n\nWomen: strong, solid colors\n\nMen: light gray or blue shirt, navy blue suit, red or burgundy tie\n\nAvoid:\n\nchecks, stripes, other busy patterns\n\nsunglasses or glasses that darken in reaction to light\n\nheavy makeup (although powder will help reduce shine under hot studio lights)\n\nThe interview\n\nArrive early to acquaint yourself with your surroundings and review your prepared statements.\n\nSpeak in short, succinct sentences (\"sound bites\").\n\nState your overall message and the supporting points.\n\nExample\n\nMessage: Youth violence is preventable because it is a learned behavior.\n\nPoint 1: It is important to recognize the early experiences that can lead to violence and confront them. For instance, exposure to violence in the media, effects of prejudice and hostility in the home or community, access to firearms.\n\nPoint 2: Psychologists are helping to develop school programs that reduce aggression and prevent violence.\n\nPoint 3: Examples of successful programs that have been implemented in schools and communities across the country.\n\nLet your passion for your topic show.\n\nNatural hand gestures and facial expressions help to highlight your points and show your enthusiasm, which will be reflected in your voice and serve to persuade.\n\nMaintain good eye contact with the interviewer, and avoid looking into the camera or monitors.\n\nControlling the interview\n\nKeep in mind that your knowledge and expertise are what distinguishes you from other guests and the host of the program.\n\nKnow your key points and say them throughout the course of the interview. Do not wait to be asked the right questions.\n\nHelp shape the interview in a professional, assertive manner.\n\nYou can steer the direction of the interview effectively by using transition phrases:\n\n\"That's a good question, but what is really important is...\"\n\n\"I'd like to make this point before I continue.\"\n\n\"Let me give you the latest information on...that is really interesting.\"\n\nYou can then shift the direction of the interview and make one of your points.\n\nThe value of your expertise\n\nYou are the expert who has been called to give information for a program. Your expertise and knowledge are what distinguish you from other guests and the host of the program.\n\nThe producer who calls you has limited knowledge about your field. It is therefore important that you take control by shaping the interview in a professional, nonaggressive manner.\n\nKnow your key points, and say them throughout the course of the interview.\n\nDo not wait to be asked the right questions.\n\nDo not expect to be given equal time if you are in a debate situation.\n\nDo not expect the producer or the host to have the same amount of knowledge that you have about your field.\n\nYou are the expert, and the audience wants to hear your information.\n\nBrevity and tightly constructed responses are even more important in electronic (radio and television) interviews than print interviews.\n\nIn either forum, you have less than 30 seconds to make your point. Preparation is the key to success.\n\nPanel interviews\n\nIf you are part of a discussion panel with other experts, each of you will be competing for airtime.\n\nDo not wait to speak until a question is directed to you. You were invited on the program because of your expertise, and you should participate and raise key points or clarify ones made by other panelists when appropriate.\n\nBe assertive; most interview segments last only a few minutes, so claim airtime before the interview is over.\n\nTechnology enables news organizations to connect with sources and experts quickly and without the need to travel to a studio or have a camera crew on site. With Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts and other video calling tools, news outlets can get an expert on the air in a matter of minutes, or record them anywhere there’s a high-speed internet connection.\n\nA video interview via Skype or Zoom is no different from a studio interview, even if the interview takes place in your home, so the tips in the television interview section of this handbook still apply.\n\nHere are some other things to keep in mind:\n\nDress professionally\n\nFollow the same advice for in-studio TV interviews and wear neat, professional clothing. Avoid busy patterns, blue shirts or blouses and heavy jewelry. You might want to apply a small amount of face powder if you tend to look shiny under lights or perspire when nervous.\n\nTake time to consider your overall appearance in advance\n\nDon’t wait until you’re on the air to see how you look on the video feed. Practice with a friend or coworker to make sure you and your surroundings look top-notch. Test both your lighting and background in advance—is your face clearly visible and well lit? Is the background neutral and without distraction? And practice looking at the camera, something that may not feel natural.\n\nAddress your lighting and camera angle\n\nWhen you’re being interviewed in a studio, you don’t have to worry about the lighting, but over Skype or Zoom you need to be cognizant of your surroundings. If you need to set up near a window, make sure it’s not behind you creating glare. Make sure your face is well lit and not in shadow. Adjust your computer camera so you are looking head on. Avoid looking up or down at the camera by adjusting its height. You might need to elevate the camera by placing your laptop on a book or other surface. Also, keep in mind that many laptop webcams are poor quality, so you might want to invest in a high-definition webcam.\n\nCreate a backdrop\n\nIf you’re doing an interview from your home office, be sure to clean up. If you have a poster or sign with your organization’s logo, you might try putting it behind you so it’s in the shot but not too intrusive. Many people set up in front of bookcases in their home offices so make sure any book spines that are visible are from books that won’t be a distraction because of subject matter or author.\n\nReduce background noise\n\nBe aware of background or outside sounds that could interfere with the interview. If you are in a room with a ceiling fan, make sure it’s turned off. Don’t forget to silence your cell phone and any other devices with audible notifications. Remember to inform family members or others in your home that you must not be interrupted during the interview. Producers will often call and do a sound check before broadcast to make sure the connection is solid. Feel free to ask any questions or raise any concerns you may have at that time.\n\nHeadphones\n\nIf you’re wearing headphones, choose the wired kind. Wireless headphones can create sound feedback because of their Bluetooth connection. Also, if you’re concerned about how headphones look, use ear buds.\n\nTurn off notifications\n\nTurn off email and other desktop notifications that may pop up and distract you during your interview.\n\nWhere to look during the interview\n\nLook at your computer’s camera, so it appears to viewers that you are looking at them. Consider putting a bright sticker or another marker next to it to draw your eyes to the camera. If it’s distracting to see yourself on screen, consider covering it up or turning off your monitor, or if your webcam is not built in, move the camera away from the screen so that you look at it directly and not at your image.\n\nOne of the most widely read sections of the newspaper is the Letters to the Editor page. A letter to the editor allows readers to express their opinion on a hot topic, add an additional point of view regarding a recent article, or correct or clarify an inaccurate or misleading story. But because letters are so popular, there is a lot of competition to get letters published.\n\nHere are some tips to help you write a good letter that will attract an editor’s attention:\n\nFind out your targeted publication’s guidelines. This is often found on the opinion or letters page, either in print or online. Different newspapers and magazines have different rules regarding what they will accept, what contact information they need, and the maximum length. Find the guidelines and follow them to avoid being immediately rejected. If guidelines are not available, the rule of thumb is that shorter is better. Many publications will not run letters longer than 250 words.\n\nBe timely. Your letter has the best chance of being published if it is in reaction to a story or column in the paper. Respond as quickly as you can—the day the story runs is ideal but certainly within a few days of the story’s or column’s publication. Editors are most likely to run one of the first letters they receive in response to a story.\n\nBe specific and brief. Stick to one main point. If the publication wants no more than 250 words, and you made your point in 150, it’s OK to stop writing. If you want to write something that is longer than a few paragraphs, you will probably need to write a commentary piece, or op-ed.\n\nFollow the publication’s style. Become familiar with the types of letters the paper publishes. If your letter is in response to a specific story, cite the headline and date within your letter. (“While many people admit that they are suffering from extreme stress, as reported in ‘Americans More Stressed than Ever’ (November 27), we must also recognize that…”)\n\nAll news is local. Your personal experiences and expertise are often worth adding. So are local statistics or any details to localize the issue.\n\nUse your expertise. If there is psychological science behind your main point, cite it. If your being a psychologist adds heft to your views, note it. If you are responding in a professional capacity—e.g., as a psychology professor or other official—note that, as long as you have clearance from your employer to use your affiliation.\n\nPrepare to be contacted. The publication will want to verify that you are who you say you are and that you wrote the letter. Give your name, address, email address, and phone number. Newspapers do not publish anonymous letters.\n\nRemember to proofread. While editors can and will edit your letter to correct grammar or cut down the length, make sure you catch any typos or other errors before sending it. And don’t be offended if the publication edits your letter; it’s not personal.\n\nA sample letter to the editor from APA that was published in a new outlet:\n\nResponse to Washington Post Outlook Article on Psychology and Torture\n\nAn estimated two-thirds of Americans say they get some or all of their news from social media, making social media platforms an attractive option for psychologists trying to get their messages out. As digital communication continues to evolve, the distinctions among various social media networks and communications platforms can be confusing even to digital natives. But, with a little thought, planning, and work, these platforms can be fruitful channels to communicate and engage with a variety of audiences, including the lay public, journalists, other scientists, and policymakers.\n\nUnlike traditional media where you often need to rely on a reporter, editor, or producer to interview you and develop a story that includes your work or viewpoint, social media allows you to speak directly to your audience. The trick is to take the time and effort to build a following and regularly post information that will keep them interested and engaged.\n\nBelow are some general guidelines to keep in mind when using social media:\n\nMake it interesting. We live in an age of short attention spans. Make your message stand out with catchy phrases and images or video.\n\nMake it relevant. Think about the audience you are trying to reach. Does your message affect them? Try to tailor your content to appeal to their interests and behaviors.\n\nPost often. Social media sites and feeds need to be updated regularly if you wish to build a following. Why would others visit your site or feed again if there is nothing new?\n\nReach out. Social media requires socializing, so don’t be afraid to engage with your audience, make connections, and network.\n\nBe patient. Don’t expect instantaneous results. It takes time to cultivate a network and following.\n\nBuild the audience you wish to reach. As you are establishing a social media presence, think about your ideal audience. If you are interested primarily in reaching fellow psychologists, go where they are and talk to them as colleagues. If you want a more general audience, go where they are but tailor your messaging to keep them engaged.\n\nHere are some specifics to help you use two of the most popular social media platforms: Twitter and Facebook.\n\nTwitter\n\nEssentially a public discussion forum, users communicate in “tweets,” which are posts of no more than 280 characters. Tweets can be enhanced by adding links to relevant websites, images, and videos. They can also include hashtags identifying them as part of an online campaign or social movement (like #COVID19). Your tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your personal Twitter page, as well as in the feeds of those who elect to follow you. Most journalists are on Twitter, as well as other public figures including celebrities and politicians, so Twitter is an easy way to reach out to them with your message.\n\nIf one of your goals is to get yourself or your research in the news, it’s important to follow key reporters on Twitter. Nearly all reporters of note are on Twitter, which they often use to promote the stories they write or other content they produce. Many of them also use Twitter to crowdsource ideas in hope of locating experts to help flesh out a story they’re considering. As you browse the news, if you see articles covering your research or interest areas, look up the reporters on Twitter (often a reporter’s Twitter name is at the beginning or end of the article) and follow them. You can also retweet what you consider to be especially good stories by reporters (tagging them, of course) to put yourself on their radar. Twitter has the ability to categorize the people you follow into lists, so you may wish to create a list of just reporters to make things easier. That way, if a reporter tweets about needing experts or research in your field, you’ll be there to lend them a hand.\n\nNot quite sure how to start? Twitter has a handy online tutorial.\n\nSome tips for psychologists just starting out:\n\nFind people you want to reach, such as other scientists, reporters, or public policymakers, and follow them. Read your feed every day and engage with their posts by responding or retweeting their interesting posts. Be sure to use their Twitter name in your tweet to gain their attention and increase the chances that they will follow you.\n\nPromote yourself to build your brand. If your research or your lab is highlighted in the news, in a blog post or on your institution’s website, tweet it. This is how you get your story out there.\n\nAmplify good science, not just your own. Not everyone has new research or content for sharing on social media regularly. Sharing the messages of those whose work you trust can contribute to the story and build your credibility.\n\nYou need to post at least once a day (ideally more) in order to maintain your followers. Dedicate time every day (sometimes only 5–10 minutes are necessary) to Twitter.\n\nUse hashtags to increase the likelihood that your tweets will be noticed. People often search for topics by hashtag—for example, #SciPol and #SciComm are commonly used for science policy and communication tweets. Often, you don’t need to create your own hashtags, but use ones others have created and used in similar posts.\n\nAs you attend conferences or other interesting events, live tweet about what you experience that would be interesting and illuminating to your followers. Use the hashtag(s) for that event (like #APA2020 for the APA annual convention) to reach a broader audience.\n\nStay organized. Twitter can be overwhelming but there are free or low-cost online services, like Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, and Buffer, to help you manage your feed and even schedule posts.\n\nThere are many online resources on best practices for scientists on Twitter. Here are a few:\n\nGuidance for writing a social media post\n\n8 ways to network better on Twitter\n\nTen simple rules for getting started on Twitter as a scientist\n\n10 tips for tweeting research\n\nFacebook\n\nAn estimated 70% of American adults have Facebook accounts, making it the most popular social media platform in the country. Facebook is less public than Twitter and used more for maintaining social connections with family and friends, but psychological scientists can still use it to promote their research and other messages. Facebook allows friends or groups to view, share and comment on posts. Posts often include photographs or links to news, videos or other interesting content on the web. Users can also join Facebook groups, which are communities based around a common interest, such as psychology or science in general.\n\nTips for using Facebook to communicate your research, ideas, or views:\n\nFind your audience. Search for and join groups that focus on subject areas you want to follow or might be receptive to your research and messages. If you can’t find an existing group, consider creating one of your own. You should also find and follow pages focused on your areas of research interest and comment on posts on that page you find relevant.\n\nPost at least once a day to keep people’s attention.\n\nAs with Twitter, if your research or your lab is highlighted in the news, in a blog post or on your institution’s website, share it. Also, share examples of others’ good science.\n\nComment often. The best way to get people to pay attention to you is to comment on posts made by others in your feed or posted in groups.\n\nKeep your posts short. People don’t want long reads in their newsfeeds. Links are your friend. Use short posts and link to longer blog posts, articles, or websites."
