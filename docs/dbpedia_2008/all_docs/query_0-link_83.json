        "text": "Archive\n\nCalendar Year 2024\n\nCalendar Year 2023\n\nAugust 24, 2023. OFLC Rescinds All Frequently Asked Questions Regarding COVID-19\n\nAs of the date of this announcement, OFLC is rescinding in full all COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs), which includes Round 1 (published March 20, 2020); Round 2 (published April 1, 2020); Round 3 (published April 9, 2020); and Round 4 (published June 3, 2020). The processing centers have resumed normal processing operations. All other FAQs not related to COVID-19 remain in full effect.\n\nMay 11, 2023. Office of Foreign Labor Certification Postpones Date for Submitting Revised PERM and CW-1 Forms in the Foreign Labor Application Gateway to June 1, 2023\n\nFollowing up on the announcements of April 21, April 27, May 1, and May 8, 2023, the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is postponing the date for filers to begin submitting the new, revised applications for permanent employment certification and CW-1 applications for temporary employment certification in the Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) from May 16, 2023, to June 1, 2023. Applicants should continue to use the current PERM and CW-1 forms until such time.\n\nAs a result of the transition to the revised version of the form and the transition to FLAG, OFLC will no longer accept any new applications submitted via the legacy PERM Online System after May 31, 2023, at 6:59 pm Eastern Standard Time. OFLC will no longer accept the previous version of Form ETA-9089 or Forms ETA-9141C/9142C, and their related forms, after May 31, 2023, either electronically or submitted by mail.\n\nApril 21, 2023. Office of Foreign Labor Certifications Announces Form ETA-9089 Case Creation and Case Submission in Foreign Labor Application Gateway\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) will begin accepting the revised Form ETA-9089, Applications for Permanent Employment Certification in the Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system on May 16, 2023. Filers may begin creating and staging applications in the FLAG system on April 24, 2023.\n\nAs a result of the transition to the revised version of the form and the transition to FLAG, OFLC will no longer accept any new applications submitted via the legacy PERM Online System after May 15, 2023, at 6:59 pm eastern standard time. OFLC will no longer accept the previous version of Form ETA-9089 after May 15, 2023, either electronically or submitted by mail.\n\nTo facilitate this transition, OFLC conducted two webinars on April 19 and April 20, 2023, to educate the stakeholder community on the new form and FLAG system filing process. OFLC will make recordings of these webinars available shortly.\n\nApril 14, 2023. Office of Foreign Labor Certification Issues Clarification on Question H.10-B \"Acceptable Alternate Occupation Title\" on the Form ETA-9089\n\nOFLC is posting an announcement regarding recent permanent labor certification applications that were denied where the employer did not explicitly answer the question in field H.10-B.\n\nOFLC has thoroughly reviewed past and current permanent labor certification (PERM) applications with respect to how question H.10-B on the Form ETA-9089 has been completed. As a result of this review, OFLC concluded that some employers have not consistently answered the question accurately by providing acceptable alternate job titles; rather, they include statements such as \"see H.14 - Special Skills.\" The information provided in H.14 does not identify what alternate occupations are acceptable to meet the experience requirements for the job that is the subject of the PERM application. Instead, the application only lists a series of the special skills requirements and/or other alternative combinations of education and experience that the employer is willing to accept. As a result of employers providing insufficient information in either H.10-B. or H.14, OFLC has recently denied applications for being incomplete.\n\nOFLC evaluated these denials and determined that while they are appropriate, it has not been consistent about when it denies an application for this reason, which could confuse filers. As a result, OFLC has stopped issuing denials for this issue for pending applications and will not deny for this reason for any application submitted on or before May 30, 2023, by which point OFLC expects to be accepting the updated version of Form ETA-9089 in the Foreign Labor Application Gateway system. Further, OFLC will overturn denials based solely on this issue. OFLC will identify applications that were denied for this issue and for which reconsideration has not yet been requested; employers whose applications have been denied solely for this reason and have not yet requested consideration are encouraged not to submit a request for reconsideration. Where reconsideration has been requested, OFLC will prioritize processing for any pending reconsideration requests based on denials where this is the only denial issue. In cases that have been denied for additional denial reasons, OFLC will overturn the H.10-B. denial reason but uphold the denial on the other grounds if either the employer has not submitted a request for reconsideration for the additional denial reason(s) or where the additional denial ground(s) are determined to be proper.\n\nOFLC recognizes that as it transitions to the updated version of Form ETA-9089, which will incorporate Form ETA-9141 into PERM applications, there may be questions about whether employers should alter how they complete Form ETA-9141 as a result of this announcement. OFLC is considering that issue and will issue guidance in the near future if we determine that such guidance is necessary.\n\nCalendar Year 2022\n\nApril 05, 2022. OFLC Announces a Reminder to Filers of Form ETA-9142B to Submit Their Initiated Cases Prior to April 28, 2022\n\nThe Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) will implement technical improvements to H-2B filing that will improve the Form ETA-9142B submission process. FLAG will upgrade the H-2B form fill and submit module, which is expected to reduce lag time in completing form fields, document uploads, and appendices. All other FLAG H-2B functionality will be available to filers in the upgraded fill and submit module.\n\nH-2B submissions after 6:00 p.m. EST on April 28, 2022, must be initiated and submitted in the new form module. As a result, any initiated H-2B cases submitted prior to 6:00 p.m. EST on April 28, 2022, will be deleted and a new application using the upgraded module will need to be created.\n\nCalendar Year 2021\n\nJune 29, 2021. OFLC Announces Updates to Implementation of the Final Rule Affecting Wages for H-1B and PERM Workers; District Court’s Order Vacating Final Rule\n\nOn June 23, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order in Chamber of Commerce, et al. v. DHS, et al., No. 20-cv-7331, vacating the Final Rule, Strengthening Wage Protections for the Temporary and Permanent Employment of Certain Aliens in the United States, 86 FR 3608 (Jan. 14, 2021), and remanding the matter back to the U.S. Department of Labor (the Department).\n\nThe Department published the Final Rule on January 14, 2021, following district court orders that set aside an October 8, 2020 Interim Final Rule (IFR) (85 FR 63872). The Final Rule amended the Department’s regulations governing the prevailing wages for employment opportunities that U.S. employers seek to fill with foreign workers on a permanent or temporary basis under the PERM, H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 visa programs. The Department has twice delayed the effective date of the Final Rule (86 FR 13995; 86 FR 26164). In light of these delays and now the June 23, 2021 order vacating the Final Rule, the operative version of the regulations at 20 CFR 656.40 and 20 CFR 655.731 continues to be the version in place on October 7, 2020, prior to the publication of the IFR.\n\nMarch 2, 2021. OFLC Announces Number of Issued Certifications for Employers Seeking H-2B Workers With April 1, 2021, Start Dates of Need\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is making this public service announcement to alert employers and other interested stakeholders about the number of temporary labor certifications and worker positions issued for the H-2B program.\n\nAs of March 1, 2021, OFLC has issued 3,598 H-2B Temporary Labor Certifications covering 65,832 worker positions. Filers who have received a temporary labor certification may file a petition with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). OFLC will continue to process H-2B applications, regardless of any H-2B visa cap administered by USCIS.\n\nJanuary 20, 2021. U.S. Department of Labor Withdraws Forthcoming H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program Rule for Review\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) announced and posted on the Office of Foreign Labor Certification’s website a forthcoming final rule, Temporary Agricultural Employment of H-2A Nonimmigrants in the United States (RIN 1205-AB89), pending publication in the Federal Register with a 30-day delayed effective date. On January 20, 2021, the Department withdrew this document from the Office of the Federal Register prior to its publication for the purpose of reviewing issues of law, fact, and policy raised by the rule, and therefore it will not take effect. The Department will notify the public of any further actions as appropriate once it completes its review.\n\nJanuary 20, 2021. U.S. Department of Labor Withdraws Program Bulletin Announcing Revised Interpretation and New Guidance under the H-1B Visa Program for Review\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) issued an Office of Foreign Labor Certification H-1B Program Bulletin and a Wage and Hour Division Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) revising its interpretation of its regulations concerning which employers of H-1B workers must file Labor Condition Applications. The Department simultaneously submitted a Notice for publication in the Federal Register announcing and requesting public comments on this interpretation. On January 20, 2021, the Department withdrew its Notice from the Office of the Federal Register prior to its publication, and is now withdrawing the Bulletin and FAB for the purpose of considering the process for issuing this interpretation as well as reviewing related issues of law, fact, and policy. Accordingly, the requirements of the Bulletin and FAB are no longer in effect. The Department will notify the public of any further actions as appropriate once it completes its review.\n\nCalendar Year 2020\n\nMarch 3, 2020. H-2B Processing Update\n\nOFLC has issued 3,642 H-2B Temporary Labor Certifications covering 63,797 worker positions. Filers who have received a temporary labor certification may file a petition with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). OFLC will continue to process H-2B applications, regardless of any H-2B visa cap administered by USCIS.\n\nCalendar Year 2019\n\nJuly 11, 2019. PERM System Routine Maintenance Service\n\nOn Thursday, July 11, 2019, the Department will be performing routine maintenance on the PERM System, which will require a temporary outage from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time. System users will not be able to access the PERM System during this time. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your patience.\n\nJune 27, 2019. iCERT System Routine Maintenance Service\n\nOn Friday, June 28, 2019, the Department will be performing routine maintenance on the iCERT System, which will require a temporary outage from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time. System users will not be able to access the iCERT System during this time. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your patience.\n\nJune 5, 2019. Scheduled System Maintenance\n\nThe iCERT system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, June 6, 2019 from 8:00 pm to 11:00 pm EDT.\n\nMay 28, 2019. Acceptance of H-2A and Prevailing Wage Applications Starting June 2019\n\nThe H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A and Appendix A, and the Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Form ETA-9141, are set to expire on May 31, 2019. The Department is seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to extend these application forms in one-month increments starting June 2019. Until OMB grants approval, employers are permitted to continue filing H-2A and prevailing wage applications using the current forms, including any approved one-month extensions, starting June 1, 2019.\n\nMay 2, 2019. Scheduled System Maintenance\n\nThe iCERT system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, May 2, 2019 from 8:00 pm to 11:00 pm EDT.\n\nApril 11, 2019. Scheduled System Maintenance\n\nThe iCERT and PERM systems may be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Friday, April 12, 2019 from 10:00 pm EDT to Saturday, April 13, 12:00 pm EDT.\n\nApril 11, 2019. PERM System Maintenance\n\nThe PERM system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, April 11, 2019 from 8:00 pm EDT to 11:00 pm EDT.\n\nJanuary 3, 2019. OFLC Issues Frequently Asked Question Regarding H-2A Applications Impacted by the iCERT system failure on January 1\n\nQUESTION : I am an H-2A employer impacted by the iCERT system failure that occurred in the early morning of January 1, 2019, and was not able to file my application 45 days before the start date of work. When system service is restored, will the Chicago NPC consider the recent system outage as a qualifying emergency?\n\nANSWER : Yes. The Department recognizes that some employers are not able to submit their H-2A applications at least 45 calendar days before the start date of work due to the temporary iCERT system outage. We consider this situation to qualify as good and substantial cause under 20 CFR 655.134. When the Department has restored system service, employers with start dates of need less than 45 days from the date of restored service may file their H-2A applications with the Chicago NPC using emergency procedures and should include a statement that their request for a waiver of the regulatory timeframe for filing is based on the temporary iCERT system outage.\n\nJanuary 2, 2019. Important Announcement Regarding the Availability of the iCERT System for H-2B Program Filings\n\nWithin the first five minutes of opening the semi-annual H-2B certification process on January 1, 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor iCERT system had an unprecedented demand for H-2B certifications with more than 97,800 workers requested in pending applications for the 33,000 available visas. With more than thirty-times the user demand on the iCERT system compared to last year on January 1, the iCERT system experienced a system disruption. The Employment and Training Administration, working with the Department of Labor's Office of the Chief Information Officer, is working diligently to have the system ready within a few days to accept a record number of H-2B applications. Enhancing system capacity and dealing with other factors such as the possible use of automated script programs during the application process are being addressed in iCERT to ensure certifications can be processed. As previously stated, the Department will be giving at least 24 hours' notice before the iCERT system is re-opened. A further update will be provided on Thursday, January 3, 2019.\n\nCalendar Year 2018\n\nDecember 27, 2018. H-2B Application Filing Timelines\n\nThe Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is making this announcement to remind employers and other interested stakeholders that H-2B Applications for Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142B, with April 1, 2019, start dates may be filed no earlier than January 1, 2019 at 12:00:00.000 a.m. Eastern Time. Applications with an April 1 start date that are filed before January 1, 2019 at 12:00:00.000 a.m. Eastern Time will be denied, and the employer will be required to refile its application. Filers are reminded that OFLC's technology servers are located in the Eastern Time Zone; therefore, the time an application is received is based on Eastern Time. Please reference the H-2B processing guidance that was previously published as an announcement on OFLC's website on June 1, 2018, for additional information regarding OFLC's processing of H-2B applications.\n\nDecember 21, 2018. Clarifications to Non-Substantive Application Form Changes in the H-2A and H-2B Programs\n\nThe Employment and Training Administration's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is issuing clarifications to the non-substantive changes to application forms for temporary labor certification under the H-2A and H-2B programs. The below Frequently Asked Questions are intended to provide employers with assistance in completing Section H, items H.6a, H.6b, and/or H.6c, before the application can be submitted.\n\nQUESTION : I am a small employer that does not maintain a website where U.S. workers can apply for my job opportunities. Can I comply with the collection requirements in Section H.6.c, Forms ETA-9142A and 9142B, by entering the website of the State Workforce Agency (SWA) where I placed my job opportunity for recruiting U.S. workers?\n\nANSWER : Yes. The general instructions for Section H.6.c, Forms ETA-9142A and 9142B, require the employer to provide a website address where U.S. workers can apply, or enter \"N/A\" where no website address is available. The employer is also required to use a valid format when entering the website address, and the general instructions identify a number of valid website address suffixes, including those covering government agencies. Because employers are required by regulation to place job orders with the SWA and place other advertisements directing applicants to apply for the job opportunity at the nearest SWA in the states in which their advertisements appear, and include contact information for the relevant SWA in their advertisements, the employer may enter the website address of the SWA where the job opportunity is posted in Section H.6.c. Employers are reminded to report SWA referrals of qualified and available U.S. workers on their recruitment reports.\n\nQUESTION : I am completing my application and usually do not include a phone number, email address, or website address for the State Workforce Agency (SWA) job order. Do I need to edit my job order to include the same information in Sections H.6.a, H.6.b., and H.6.c.?\n\nANSWER : No. The Department will review the application along with the SWA job order and issue a Notice of Deficiency (NOD) where the employer or their authorized agents or attorneys provide contact information (e.g., phone, email, web site) that is different from that provided on the SWA job order. For instance, if the employer or its authorized agent or attorney provides a phone number and email address as its contact information on the SWA job order where U.S. workers can apply, and the information submitted on the Forms ETA-9142A or 9142B is different, a NOD will be issued to provide the employer with an opportunity to correct the discrepancy. However, if an employer or its authorized agent or attorney provides other methods of contact information on the SWA job order, such as a fax number and physical address, the Department will not issue a NOD but will view this as additional methods for U.S. workers to apply for the job.\n\nDecember 17, 2018. Acceptance of H-2B Applications for January 2019\n\nThe H-2B Application for Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142B and all appendices, are set to expire on December 31, 2018. The Department is seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to extend these application forms in one-month increments starting January 2019. Until OMB grants approval, employers are permitted to continue filing H-2B applications using the current forms, including any approved one-month extensions, starting January 1, 2019.\n\nNovember 13, 2018. The Employment and Training Administration Announces iCERT Enhancements to Improve Customer Service in the H-2A and H-2B Programs\n\nThe Employment and Training Administration's Office of Foreign Labor Certification today implemented new enhancements to the iCERT system related to the submission of applications for temporary labor certification under the H-2A and H-2B programs. These enhancements are intended to improve customer service and increase the quality of applications submitted for processing.\n\nThese enhancements include data validation checks designed to assist employers in preparing H-2A and H-2B applications according to the required form fields and instructions approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Specifically, employers preparing applications must ensure that each required field of the Form ETA-9142A, H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification, and ETA-9142B, H-2B Application for Temporary Employment Certification, is completed before submitting to the National Processing Center for processing. As a reminder, the iCERT system helps employers prepare applications by displaying mandatory fields on the Forms ETA-9142A and 9142B with an asterisk (*), and conditional mandatory fields with a section symbol (§) where the response is conditioned on one or more previous form entries.\n\nOctober 18, 2018. iCERT System Maintenance\n\nThe iCERT system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, October 18, 2018 from 8:00 pm ET to 11:00 pm ET.\n\nSeptember 21-23, 2018. iCERT and PERM System Maintenance\n\niCERT and PERM systems will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Friday, September 21 8:00 pm ET through Sunday, September 23, 2018 until 2:00 pm ET.\n\nSeptember 20, 2018. OFLC Announces System Maintenance Outage Impacting the PERM System\n\nThe PERM system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, September 20, 2018 from 8:00 pm ET until 11:00 pm ET.\n\nJuly 2, 2018.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, OFLC uploaded the newest prevailing wage data from the Occupational Employment Survey as generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year from July 2018 - June 2019. The effective date is July 1, 2018. Prevailing wage determinations issued from the National Prevailing Wage Center will reflect the new data.\n\nMay 30, 2018. OFLC Announces System Maintenance Outage Impacting the PERM System\n\nThe PERM system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, May 31, 2018 from 8:00 pm ET until 11:00 pm ET.\n\nApril 20, 2018. iCERT and PERM System Maintenance\n\nDue to planned maintenance, service interruptions and degraded performance may be possible for both the iCERT and PERM systems from 8:00 pm EDT on Friday, April 20, 2018 until 11:00 pm EDT on Sunday, April 22, 2018.\n\nFebruary 27, 2018. OFLC Announces System Maintenance Outage Impacting the PERM System\n\nThe PERM system will be unavailable during the following time period for system maintenance: Thursday, March 1, 2018 from 8:00 pm ET until 11:00 pm ET.\n\nCalendar Year 2017\n\nDecember 28, 2017. New 2018 Herder H-2A Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) - Correction\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice announcing the new Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for the employment of temporary or seasonal nonimmigrant foreign workers (H-2A workers) who perform herding or production of livestock on the range. AEWRs are the minimum wage rates the Department has determined must be offered and paid by employers to H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment so that the wages of similarly employed U.S. workers will not be adversely affected. The Federal Register Notice presented the new AEWR as both $1,584.22/month and $1,548.22/month. The correct 2018 AEWR for herding or production of livestock on the range is $1,584.22/month, effective January 1, 2018. ETA will publish a correction notice in the Federal Register .\n\nMay 30, 2017. OFLC Announces Improvements to the PERM Sponsorship Verification Process\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is currently working to streamline the PERM sponsorship verification process. Effective May 13, 2017, OFLC updated the automated email request for sponsorship verification process, allowing the employer to respond within 30 days by directly accessing the sponsorship questionnaire online. Employers who do not respond within seven (7) calendar days will be sent a follow up email reminding them that it has 23 days left to respond to the sponsorship request.\n\nIf applicable, the employer's attorney/agent will also receive a courtesy email regarding the employer's timeframe to respond to the sponsorship request. Failure to respond to the request within the established timeframe will result in a denial for failure to comply with the request for sponsorship verification. These emails will inform both the employer and the employer's attorney/agent of the consequences of failing to comply with the request for sponsorship verification.\n\nIf the employer does not have an email address listed on its ETA Form 9089, Application for Permanent Employment Certification, OFLC will verify sponsorship via a telephone call or a mailed request for sponsorship verification.\n\nMarch 10, 2017. PERM FAQ Round 14\n\nIn light of stakeholder input, which the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is considering, OFLC has temporarily removed from its website PERM FAQ Round 14 regarding Actual Minimum Requirements, originally published on March 6, 2017. OFLC will clarify and republish PERM FAQ Round 14 to provide additional information on its applicability to PERM applications and associated prevailing wage requests and determinations.\n\nCalendar Year 2016\n\nOctober 7, 2016. OFLC Announces System Maintenance Outage Impacting the iCERT/PERM Systems\n\nThe iCERT and PERM systems will be unavailable from 10:00 pm EDT on Friday, October 7, 2016 until 6:00 am EDT on Tuesday, October 11, 2016 for system maintenance.\n\nJuly 1, 2016. OES Wage Data Update\n\nOn July 1, 2016, OFLC uploaded the newest prevailing wage data from the Occupational Employment Survey as generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year from July 2016 - June 2017. The effective date is July 1, 2016. Prevailing wages issued from the National Prevailing Wage Center will reflect the new data.\n\nMarch 23, 2016. H-2A Program Forms.\n\nThe forms for the H-2A program are currently in review for a three year extension. Notice of a second comment period, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act, is expected to be published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks.

The OFLC has been experiencing technical network problems supporting its iCERT Visa Portal System (iCERT System), resulting in delays in the processing of temporary nonimmigrant visa applications for employers. Specifically, although the iCERT System's application and database are working properly, the network infrastructure supporting the system is exhibiting performance issues that are significantly impacting our staff's ability to process case actions for our employer customers. The Department's technology staff is working diligently with the OFLC to improve system performance as soon as practically possible.\n\nJanuary 21, 2016. H-2B IFR Job Order Checklist\n\nThe Department of Labor has temporarily removed the H-2B Interim Final Rule Job Order Checklist. It will be re-posted as soon as it is updated.\n\nJanuary 11, 2016.\n\nThe Department's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) is making this public service announcement to employers who participate in the H-2B temporary nonagricultural visa program. We have received a number of inquiries and correspondence concerning recent changes and delays in processing H-2B applications at the Chicago National Processing Center (NPC). The Department takes your concerns seriously and strives to support U.S. small businesses, consumers, and communities.\n\nThe Department, along with the Department of Homeland Security, jointly published the 2015 H-2B Interim Final Rule and H-2B Wage Final Rule, which became effective on April 29, 2015. The new rules strengthened protections for U.S. workers while also ensuring that employers can access foreign workers on a temporary basis when U.S. workers are not available. Additionally, the rules were intended to bring stability and continuity to the program. However, the 2016 Department of Labor Appropriations Act (2016 DOL Appropriations Act), enacted on December 18, 2015, contains provisions significantly affecting the processing of employer H-2B applications at the Chicago NPC. Unfortunately, the time required to implement these new legislative provisions is causing delays in processing employer H-2B applications filed prior to December 18 and that were pending with the Chicago NPC. Following an intensive review of the operational impacts of the 2016 DOL Appropriations Act, OFLC posted emergency guidance and has been implementing requirements of the 2016 DOL Appropriations Act, including new procedures and forms approved on an emergency basis by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nIn addition, the current filing season has seen more than 1,700 new H-2B applications filed during the holiday season, an approximate 79% increase over the number of H-2B applications filed during the 2014 holiday season.\n\nThe simultaneous impact of the requirement to change procedures as the result of the 2016 DOL Appropriations Act, and the major increase in the number of applications being filed, has resulted in longer processing times in the H-2B program. This additional processing time may continue for the immediate future so that we can fully incorporate and operationalize the new program requirements and handle the increased workload. Our current efforts are focused on reducing the number of pending cases as quickly as possible without compromising program integrity.\n\nCalendar Year 2015\n\nDecember 14, 2015. H-2B Forms Update\n\nAll of the forms for the H-2B program, except the employer provided survey attestations (Form ETA-9165), have been extended for three years until December 31, 2018. The Form ETA-9165 is still being extended in monthly increments until receipt of a three year extension. However, if employers have already filled out and signed the forms with an expiration date of 12/31/2015 in anticipation of filing them in the first weeks of January, the Department will accept forms with the expiration date of 12/31/2015 through January 31, 2016. Also, as a reminder, the Form ETA-9155 and the registration process are not operational at this time. OFLC will announce the implementation of the registration process in the Federal Register and on this website.\n\nMay 22, 2015.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, the Department of Labor (Department) published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Temporary Agricultural Employment of H-2A Foreign Workers in the Herding or Production of Livestock on the Open Range in the United States (NPRM) (80 FR 20300). The NPRM provided for the submission of public comments through May 15, 2015. In response to public requests to extend the comment period, the Department published a subsequent notice in the Federal Register to extend the comment period by 15 days, through June 1, 2015 (80 FR 25633). After the publication of the notice announcing the extension, the Department received additional requests to extend the comment period. However, the Department is required by court order to publish a final rule no later than November 1, 2015, Mendoza v. Perez, No. 11-1790 (D.D.C Oct. 31, 2014), and any further extension of the comment period would significantly impair our ability to meet this court-ordered deadline. As a result, we have not further extended the comment period beyond June 1, 2015.\n\nApril 16, 2015: H-2B Processing Continuing\n\nOn April 15, 2015, the federal district court for the Northern District of Florida issued a further order in Perez v. Perez, No 3:14-cv-682 (N.D. Fla., March 4, 2015) that permits DOL to continue its processing of H-2B applications and requests for prevailing wages through May 15, 2015 unless otherwise lifted by the court. Therefore, DOL is continuing to process H-2B applications and requests for prevailing wage.\n\nApril 16, 2015: DOL H-2B Processing Stops Again\n\nUnder the court order issued March 18, 2015, by the federal district court in Perez v. Perez, No. 3:14-cv-682 (N.D. Florida), DOL was permitted to temporarily resume processing H-2B requests for prevailing wages and applications for labor certification under the 2008 H-2B rule through April 15, 2015. The court's order permitted only a temporary resumption, and now requires DOL once again to cease accepting or processing requests for prevailing wage determinations or applications for labor certification in the H-2B program. Effective April 16, 2015, DOL has ceased accepting or processing H-2B prevailing wage determinations and applications for H-2B temporary non-agricultural labor certification under the 2008 rule. DOL and DHS are moving as quickly as possible to issue new joint regulations that will enable DOL to resume processing H-2B applications and requests for prevailing wage determinations.\n\nMarch 18, 2015. Prohibition of DOL H-2B Processing Temporarily Lifted\n\nOn March 18, 2015, the federal district court in the Northern District of Florida issued an order effectively permitting DOL to restart its processing of H-2B applications under the 2008 rule immediately and to continue processing applications under that rule through April 15, 2015. Effective immediately, DOL will begin processing H-2B applications under the 2008 rule and will continue to do so through April 15th. Under the terms of the court's March 18th order, any application for certification or prevailing wage determination that has not completed DOL processing by the time the stay ends as of April 16, 2015 may no longer be processed under the 2008 H-2B rule.\n\nMarch 16, 2015. Joint Statement from DOL and DHS on Next Steps for the H-2B Program\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the federal district court in the Northern District of Florida vacated the Department of Labor's (DOL) 2008 H-2B regulations on the ground that DOL lacks authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to issue regulations in the H-2B program. Perez v. Perez, No. 3:14-cv-682 (N.D. Fla., Mar. 4, 2015). Because this decision vacated the rule and permanently enjoined DOL from enforcing it, DOL was forced to immediately discontinue the processing of applications for temporary labor certification in the H-2B program.\n\nTo rectify the regulatory gap that the vacatur has caused, DOL and DHS are working expeditiously to issue a joint Interim Final Rule (IFR). It is the two Departments' intention to promulgate this rule by April 30, 2015. In addition, DOL will seek to determine whether relief from the Court's decision may be obtained such that processing can continue during the period of time before an IFR is promulgated.\n\nDOL and DHS recognize the hardship that has resulted from the Court's decision. That is why the Departments are moving as quickly as possible to issue new regulations that would be consistent with the decision. In so doing, the Departments must be mindful of other court decisions that have invalidated past subregulatory actions in the H-2B and related programs, including the issuance of guidance in the absence of rulemaking.\n\nMarch 4, 2015.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the federal district court in the Northern District of Florida vacated the Department of Labor‘s (DOL) 2008 H-2B regulations on the ground that DOL lacks authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to issue regulations in the H-2B program. Perez v. Perez , No. 3:14-cv-682 (N.D. Florida, Mar. 4, 2015). Because of this decision, effective immediately, DOL can no longer accept or process requests for prevailing wage determinations or applications for labor certification in the H-2B program. DOL is considering its options in light of the court‘s decision.\n\nJanuary 27, 2015. Additional Guidance regarding CATA v. Perez and Employers' H-2B Temporary Employment Certifications That Are Based on Employer-Provided Surveys\n\nOn Dec. 23, 2014, the Department announced procedures to implement the Court's decision in Comite de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas et al v. Perez, No. 14-3557 (3rd Cir.Dec. 5, 2014), which were applicable to (1) employers with pending prevailing wage requests based on an employer-provided survey and (2) employers who had received a prevailing wage determination based on an employer-provided survey but whose H-2B application had not yet been certified. In the latter case, the Department is issuing supplemental prevailing wage determinations (SPWDs) based on the OES mean.\n\nFor employers who already received an H-2B temporary labor certification based on an employer-provided survey as of the date of the issuance of the Court's order on December 5, 2014, the Department will hold in abeyance the issuance of any SPWDs pending the conclusion of the adjudicatory proceeding initiated by the Secretary of Labor's Notice of Intent to Issue a Declaratory Order, 79 Fed. Reg. 75179 (Dec. 17, 2014).\n\nCalendar Year 2014\n\nDecember 9, 2014\n\nEffective December 8, 2014, the Department is no longer issuing prevailing wage determinations in the H-2B program based on employer provided wage surveys. This action is in response to the Court order entered December 5, 2014 in Comite de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agricolas et al v. Solis , No. 14-3557 (3rd Cir.). The Court's order vacated the portion of the H-2B wage rule (20 CFR § 655.10(f)) and 2009 Wage Guidance permitting the use of such surveys. Therefore, Prevailing Wage Determination Requests currently pending with the National Prevailing Wage Center that seek to utilize employer provided surveys will be given the appropriate Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) wage for the occupation. Employers who wish to utilize a Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act wage determination or a wage based on a Collective Bargaining Agreement may request redetermination under 20 CFR § 655.10(g). Employers whose prevailing wage determination was based an employer provided wage survey, but whose H-2B Applications for Temporary Employment Certification have not yet resulted in a final determination by the Chicago NPC, will be notified of their new wage obligation along with their certification letters.\n\nJuly 1, 2014.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, OFLC uploaded the newest prevailing wage data from the Occupational Employment Survey as generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year from July 2014 - June 2015. The effective date is July 1, 2014. Prevailing wages issued from the National Prevailing Wage Center will reflect the new data.\n\nJune 9, 2014.\n\nOFLC has become aware of an anomaly in the published LCA Disclosure dataset titled \"H1B_FY2014_Q2\". The error is with respect to the listing of the \"PW_SOURCE_1\" and \"PW_SOURCE_2\" data. The dataset erroneously listed a numeric code associated with a wage source; it has been corrected to display the actual wage source.\n\nApril 15, 2014\n\nApril 15, 2014 The iCERT System and the PERM Case Management System (CMS) will both be unavailable on Saturday, May 3, 2014, from 6:00 am until approximately 8:00 pm Eastern Time for required scheduled maintenance. While we do not at this time anticipate problems once the maintenance has been performed, filers may experience delays and/or continued unavailability immediately following the scheduled maintenance, and the Department will do everything possible to avoid or minimize any service issues. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nApril 14, 2014. Staggered Crossing of Seafood Industry (through September 30, 2014)\n\nOn January 17, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (the \"2014 Appropriations Act\"), Pub. L. 113-76, which includes a provision permitting staggered entry of H-2B workers employed by employers in the seafood industry under certain conditions. This provision expires on September 30, 2014; accordingly, no staggered entry of H-2B workers after September 30, 2014 will be permitted.\n\nIn order to use the \"staggered crossing\" provision established by the 2014 Appropriations Act, seafood industry employers must download, complete and sign the official attestation, and provide it to the H-2B nonimmigrant worker for presentation, upon request, to the Department of State's Consular Officers and/or the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection officers. The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) may be accessed here.\n\nMarch 25, 2014.\n\nLCAs Approved, But Email Notifications Not Always Getting to Submitter: Please be advised that OFLC's iCERT system is experiencing an IT glitch with respect to the issuance of confirmation emails for Labor Condition Applications (LCAs). OFLC is working to resolve this issue. We strongly recommend that submitters continue to check their iCERT accounts to confirm LCA status and to retrieve and print certified LCAs.\n\nFebruary 24, 2014.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification has replaced an incorrect link previously located on the OFLC's Performance Data Page, Disclosure Data Tab. The Fiscal Year 2012 PW_Case_Data_FY2012 link has been updated and now directs users to the correct FY 2012 Prevailing Wage Disclosure Data File.\n\nFebruary 21, 2014. New FAQ regarding notification and consideration of laid-off U.S. workers for PERM applications\n\nNew Frequently Asked Question (FAQ). This FAQ addresses how an employer is to demonstrate that it notified and considered laid-off U.S. workers for the job opportunity listed on the ETA Form 9089. To read the FAQ, please click here and scroll to the PERM / Recruitment Report subheading.\n\nCalendar Year 2013\n\nDecember 20, 2013. Island Holdings\n\nOn December 3, 2013, The Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) issued an en banc decision in The Matter of Island Holdings LLC (2013-PWD-00002). That decision vacated the supplemental prevailing wage determinations issued in light of the Department's Interim Final H-2B Wage Rule (78 Fed. Reg. 24047, April 24, 2013). A class action complaint has been filed in the district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, challenging the Island Holdings decision, CATA v. Perez , 13-CV-07213. After a full review of the Island Holdings decision and the district court complaint, the Department has decided to postpone action on the Island Holdings decision pending judicial review, as permitted by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 705. This action is in the interest of justice, given the confusion and substantial disruption that would be created if the Department implemented the decision and it was subsequently overturned by the district court. Accordingly, all OFLC actions related to the resolution of appeals in the supplemental prevailing wage decisions will be stayed, pending the resolution of the district court action. Please continue to check back on this site for additional information.\n\nNovember 20, 2013. Selected Statistics Update\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification has posted revised program factsheets containing the FY 2013 selected statistics for the Permanent Labor Certification Program, and the FY 2013 H-2A Temporary Agricultural Labor Certification Program. The revised program factsheets may be found on OFLC's Performance Data page.\n\nNovember 13, 2013.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Labor Certification has posted updated program factsheets containing the Quarter 4 FY 2013 selected statistics for the Permanent Labor Certification Program, Prevailing Wage Determination Program, H-1B Temporary Visa Program, H-2A Temporary Agricultural Visa Program, and H-2B Temporary Non-agricultural Visa Program. The updated program factsheets may also be found on OFLC's Performance Data page.\n\nOctober 28, 2013: Notice to H-2A Stakeholders: Accommodation PDFs will Continue Through November 18th\n\nOn October 21st, OFLC announced, as a temporary accommodation not to exceed 30 days, it would send an Adobe PDF of an approved certification to H-2A employers and authorized representatives. That accommodation will be continued through November 18, 2013.\n\nMarch 1, 2013. H-2A Program: 2013 Allowable Meal Charges and Travel Subsistence\n\nThe Department expects to publish within a week a notice in the Federal Register establishing the 2013 allowable meal charges and maximum travel subsistence reimbursement amounts. The new 2013 amounts will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register, which the Department will announce on this website.\n\nCalendar Year 2012"
