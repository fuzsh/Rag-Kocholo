And even better, many of these resources are free.\n\nRural RISE NC\n\nDon’t Fall for Impostors posing as the NC Department of the Secretary of State.\n\nThe NC Secretary of State’s Office has received a report of individuals misrepresenting themselves as the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State to lure loan-seekers to pay an up-front fee. Neither the Secretary of State’s Office nor any other agency will require individuals to pay taxes on a loan before the loan money can be released. Please report anyone making such offers to the NC Attorney General’s Office (https://www.ncdoj.gov/consumer.aspx) at 1-877-5-NO-SCAM."
