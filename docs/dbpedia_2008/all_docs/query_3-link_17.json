In some cases, OCR found that the district failed to determine if a hostile environment existed for those students and if they needed remedies to address the effects of that environment.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to take several steps, including: (1) reviewing specific incidents regarding students subjected to harassment based on race, color, or national origin in the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school years to determine what further action is needed to equitably resolve these incidents for students; (2) reviewing, revising, and disseminating districtwide policies and procedures for responding to reports of harassment and maintaining related records to ensure they satisfy Title VI; (3) implementing new forms for tracking reports of harassment and responsive actions; (4) conducting a districtwide assessment of school climate; (5) training for district and school administrators, faculty, and staff on new policies, procedures, and forms; (6) training for school administrators on how to conduct and document reliable and impartial investigations; (7) implementing a plan to educate students and parents about identifying and reporting harassment; and (8) reporting to OCR about the district’s responses to harassment in the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years.\n\nCarmel Unified School District – Resolution Letter PDF (299K)\n\nCarmel Unified School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (213K)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education Issues Resources to Help Schools Prepare for 2024 Title IX Regulations\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today released three new resources today to support schools that are preparing to implement the amended Title IX regulations the Department published in April 2024 (2024 Title IX Regulations).\n\nIn issuing the 2024 Title IX Regulations, the Department aims to fulfill Title IX’s promise that no person experiences sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment or sexual violence, in federally funded education.\n\nThe new Title IX resources include:\n\n2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation, which supports schools by listing key components of the 2024 Title IX regulations. PDF (197K)\n\nA Video on Drafting Nondiscrimination Policies, Notices of Nondiscrimination, & Grievance Procedures under the 2024 Title IX Regulations, to highlight a previously issued resource to help schools draft, adopt, and implement policies and procedures that are required under the 2024 Title IX regulations. Video (Length: 00:02:49)\n\nThese resources complement other previously released technical assistance documents to help implement the 2024 Title IX Regulations, including a fact sheet, a brief overview of key provisions of the final regulations, and a resource for drafting Title IX nondiscrimination policies, notices of nondiscrimination, and grievance procedures.\n\nAs of July 19, 2024, pursuant to federal court orders, the Department is currently enjoined from enforcing the 2024 Final Rule in the states of Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming; the Department is also currently enjoined from enforcing the 2024 Final Rule at the schools on the list located at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/list-of-schools-enjoined-from-2024-t9-rule.pdf. Per court order, this list of schools will be supplemented on or before July 26 and may also be supplemented at subsequent times. This resource does not currently apply in those states and schools.\n\nJuly 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Compliance Review Against Colonial School District in Delaware Examining the Access of Students with Disabilities to Advanced Placement Courses\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced that the Colonial School District in Delaware has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure the District’s compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 with regard to providing students with disabilities equal access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses. During its investigation, OCR determined that the District has not taken steps specifically designed to ensure equal access to high rigor courses for students with disabilities, although the District had notice for years that students with disabilities participate in AP courses at rates well below their enrollment rates.\n\nTo resolve this investigation, the District has committed to: complete a review and assessment of the District’s AP course offerings for the 2023-2024 school year and develop recommendations for ensuring equal access to AP courses for students with disabilities, including whether adjustments to its AP course enrollment practices would increase enrollment for students with disabilities; review its communication with students and parents, including students with disabilities and their parents, regarding the availability of AP courses and develop a protocol for ensuring that all students in 8th through 11th grade and their parents are provided with notice of the availability of AP courses, how to enroll in these courses, and the significance given to AP courses by colleges in the admissions process; complete an evaluation of its academic counseling services at the District Middle School and High School and make changes, as necessary, to ensure that students with disabilities receive counseling that informs them of available AP course options; provide training to all District Middle School and High School guidance counselors and teachers regarding the eligibility requirements for AP courses, and the importance of inclusion of students with disabilities in AP course enrollment; and develop a record-keeping system to identify the number of students with disabilities who participate in the District High School’s AP course offerings and ensure accurate reporting of data to OCR’s Civil Rights Data Collection.\n\nColonial School District – Resolution Letter PDF (300K)\n\nColonial School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (220K)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Complaint Against Brown University in Rhode Island Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Brown University in Rhode Island has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to alleged harassment of students based on national origin (including shared Jewish Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim ancestry).\n\nWhile OCR’s investigation confirmed that the University has taken notable proactive steps to support a nondiscriminatory campus environment, OCR’s investigation also identified compliance concerns regarding the effectiveness of the University’s response to notice of alleged antisemitic and other shared ancestry discrimination, including those of serious harm, that could contribute to or create a hostile environment for students. Relatedly, OCR noted marked variation among the half-dozen University entities responding to these reports, leaving University students and staff without consistent University redress.\n\nOCR commends the University for revising its practices during the pendency of this investigation and for working to fulfill key priorities it identified to ensure a non-discriminatory environment for the Brown community, including the University’s stated goal of taking the strongest possible stance against any form of discrimination and harassment including, but not limited to, antisemitism, anti-Muslim hate, or other unlawful discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics or citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity.\n\nOCR determined that monitoring the University’s fulfillment of its key priorities through the following terms of the resolution agreement announced today will effectively ensure the University’s compliance with Title VI not to discriminate based on shared ancestry: (1) further revise its Title VI policies and procedures to ensure all University offices consistently and effectively comply with Title VI, including with respect to protests and demonstrations; (2) conduct annual training on nondiscrimination and harassment for students and all employees; (3) maintain records related to complaints or reports of discrimination under Title VI; (4) conduct a review of the University’s response to complaints and reports of antisemitic and other shared ancestry discrimination during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, and take remedial actions if required; and (5) analyze the results of, and create an action plan in response to, climate survey(s) and/or other review(s) focused on shared ancestry discrimination.\n\nBrown University in Rhode Island – Resolution Letter PDF (350K)\n\nBrown University in Rhode Island – Resolution Agreement PDF (197K)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Fact Sheet on Protecting Students from Discrimination, such as Harassment Based on Race, Color, or National Origin on School Campuses\n\nToday, on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a new [Fact Sheet to share resources about federal civil rights obligations of schools and other recipients of federal financial assistance from the Department to ensure nondiscrimination based on race, color, or national origin under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and its implementing regulations. This fact sheet describes how OCR determines the existence of a hostile environment and details schools’ obligations to address and remedy a hostile environment. The fact sheet also provides hypothetical examples to help schools assess their Title VI obligations, including the requirement to promptly and effectively address alleged acts of discrimination, including harassment.\n\nFact Sheet: Harassment based on Race, Color, or National Origin on School Campuses PDF (427K)\n\nJune 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Complaint Against Lafayette College Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Lafayette College (College) has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title VI of the of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to allegations of discrimination or harassment, including based on shared Jewish ancestry. To resolve the Title VI concerns OCR identified regarding the College’s response to alleged harassing conduct based on shared ancestry, the College agreed to: review and revise its policies and procedures to ensure that the College’s response to notice of discrimination, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry, is consistent with Title VI; provide training to all employees and staff responsible for investigating complaints and other reports of discrimination, including harassment based on shared ancestry (which includes antisemitism), as well as all staff involved in responding to reports of race, color, and national origin discrimination, regarding the College’s obligations under Title VI, as well as the College’s antiharassment policies and procedures; provide training to all staff and students regarding conduct prohibited by Title VI, the College’s responsibility to respond to allegations of discrimination including harassment based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics and the College’s non-discrimination policies and procedures; and, review its response to previous reports of discrimination and/or harassment based on shared ancestry for the 2023-2024 academic year to ensure the College made a determination regarding whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment, including incidents that occurred on social media or off campus.\n\nLafayette College – Resolution Letter PDF (312K)\n\nLafayette College – Resolution Agreement PDF (194K)\n\nJune 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Releases New Resources on Students with Disabilities\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights has issued new resources for schools, stakeholders, students with disabilities, and their families. These documents remind students with disabilities and elementary and secondary schools, as well as colleges and universities, of their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding students with sickle cell disease, epilepsy, or cancer.\n\nFact Sheet: Section 504 Protections for Students with Sickle Cell Disease PDF (239K)\n\nFact Sheet: Section 504 Protections for Students with Epilepsy PDF (240K)\n\nFact Sheet: Section 504 Protections for Students with Cancer PDF (238K)\n\nJune 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Two Complaints Against the University of Michigan Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the University of Michigan (University) has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title VI of the of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to allegations of discrimination or harassment, including based on shared Jewish ancestry and shared Palestinian or Muslim ancestry. OCR’s review of University documentation of 75 reports the University received alleging shared ancestry harassment and/or discrimination from the 2022-23 school year through February 2024 do not reflect that the University has complied with its Title VI requirements to assess whether incidents individually or cumulatively created a hostile environment for students, faculty, or staff, and if so, to take steps reasonably calculated to end the hostile environment, remedy its effects, and prevent its recurrence.\n\nTo resolve the Title VI concerns OCR identified during investigation of these complaints, the University has committed to: revising as necessary University policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the Title VI prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on a student’s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics; ensuring the University coordinates compliance with Title VI through its Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX office (ECRT); training University employees, including University law enforcement, regarding the University’s obligations under Title VI to respond to alleged discrimination, the individual employee’s role in discharging these obligations, and University policies and procedures; administering a climate assessment for students and employees; reviewing case files for each report of discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of shared ancestry during the 2023-2024 school year to determine whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment and whether any further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident; and reporting to OCR on its responses to reports of discrimination, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry, during the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years.\n\nUniversity of Michigan – Resolution Letter PDF (343K)\n\nUniversity of Michigan – Resolution Agreement PDF (150K)\n\nJune 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces the Resolution of Nine Complaints against the City University of New York Alleging Antisemitic, Anti-Palestinian, Anti-Muslim, and Anti-Arab Harassment\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that it has resolved nine complaints against the City University of New York (CUNY), CUNY Central Office, and the following CUNY schools: Hunter College (Hunter), School of Law, Brooklyn College, Queens College, and Baruch College. OCR’s investigation of the earliest Hunter complaint determined that students and faculty disrupted two Zoom sessions of a Hunter course in 2021 by reading a statement calling for the decolonization of Palestine, and that several students wrote in the Zoom chat that they were scared.\n\nOCR found that Hunter concluded—without interviewing students present during the sessions—that the disruption did not deny access to education, and that Hunter did not respond to requests from Jewish students to learn Hunter’s response. In addition to the concerns OCR’s investigation to date had raised regarding Hunter, OCR identified compliance concerns that specific CUNY colleges appear not to have conducted adequate investigations in response to reports of alleged harassment based on national origin/shared ancestry, may treat students differently based on their national origin/shared ancestry with respect to implementation of policies and procedures governing student conduct and events on campus, may not have taken steps reasonably designed to redress existing hostile environments, and may in some circumstances not have considered whether the alleged conduct subjected students to possible hostile environments at all. Based on these related compliance concerns regarding several of CUNY constituent campuses, CUNY entered into a CUNY-wide agreement to ensure that CUNY and each of its 25 constituent colleges and schools fulfill their Title VI responsibilities when responding to discrimination, including harassment, based on national origin/shared ancestry.\n\nCity University of New York – Resolution Letter PDF (621K)\n\nCity University of New York – Resolution Agreement PDF (203K)\n\nMay 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Investigation of Discrimination Against Native American Students in Rapid City Area Schools, South Dakota\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that the Rapid City Area Schools District in South Dakota has entered into an agreement to ensure compliance federal civil rights obligations not to discriminate based on national origin under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nOCR’s review found evidence indicating that (1) Native American students were being disciplined more frequently and more harshly than similarly situated white students, and (2) that Native American students were discriminated against with respect to access, referral, identification, and selection for the district’s advanced learning programs and courses including honors courses and Advanced Placement courses.\n\nThe district’s commitments in the resolution agreement include the following: (1) examining the root causes of possible discrimination in the district’s discipline and advanced learning programs and implementing corresponding corrective action plans; (2) employing a discipline equity supervisor and an advanced learning coordinator; and (3) establishing a standing committee, consisting largely of Native American community members, to inform implementation of the plans.\n\nRapid City Area Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (511K)\n\nRapid City Area Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (364K)\n\nMay 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Releases Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights released our Annual Report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress for fiscal year 2023. The Annual Report summarizes the enforcement achievements and policy actions of the 2023 fiscal year. Throughout the 2023 fiscal year, OCR actively pursued our mission to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence through the vigorous enforcement of civil rights. This report highlights significant resolutions involving race-based and disability-based harassment, as well as cases involving sexual assault and other egregious conduct. This report provides a snapshot of OCR’s accomplishments during the 2023 fiscal year, including:\n\nResolving 16,448 cases and receiving a record 19,201 complaints;\n\nPublishing 11 policy guidance resource packages addressing a wide range of civil rights topics. Related to OCR’s Title VI enforcement, the topics addressed included the legal framework that applies to diversity and inclusion activities, the protection from discrimination on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, confronting racial discrimination in student discipline, and race and school programming.\n\nFiscal Year 2023 Annual Report PDF (28.2M)\n\nMay 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Dear Colleague Letter on Protecting Students from Discrimination, such as Harassment, Based on Race, Color, or National Origin, including Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics\n\nThe Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a fact sheet today, seventy years after the U.S. Supreme Court reached a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court held that legally mandated racial segregation of children in public schools is unconstitutional, explaining that “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” and “where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.”\n\nOCR’s civil rights data collection and enforcement experience reflect that student access to education and to educational resources, including high rigor courses and programs, teachers, and other school staff differs by race, color, and national origin in schools across the United States. The fact sheet summarizes applicable policy resources describing federal legal obligations to ensure that all students have equal access to education regardless of race, color, or national origin, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nOCR also released a new data report today. The report describes student access to, and enrollment in, mathematics, science, and computer science courses drawing from data collected for the 2020-21 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The report reflects stark continuing inequities in education access throughout the nation.

OCR also found that the district failed to investigate alleged sexual assaults, including after they were reported to law enforcement. OCR further found that the district failed to provide interim measures to alleged targets, to notify some parties of investigation outcomes, to adopt compliant Title IX grievance procedures, or to meet its Title IX coordinator obligations.\n\nThe agreement to resolve these violations and OCR’s concern about recordkeeping requires: coordinating responses to sexual harassment through the Title IX coordinator, taking further action if needed to respond equitably to incidents from the three-year period, reporting to OCR about these responses and future responses, ensuring compliant grievance procedures, training staff on them, improving recordkeeping, and administering a climate survey.\n\nRedlands Unified School District – Resolution Letter PDF (344K)\n\nRedlands Unified School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (220K)\n\nApril 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education Releases Final Title IX Regulations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released its Final Rule under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\nThe final regulations promote educational equity and opportunity for students across the country by restoring and strengthening vital protections for students, and provide schools with information to meet their Title IX obligations while offering appropriate discretion and flexibility to account for variations in school size, student populations, and administrative structures. The final regulations also promote accountability by requiring schools to take prompt and effective action when notified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in their education programs or activities. The final regulations also reaffirm the Department's core commitment to fundamental fairness for all parties, the rights of parents and guardians to support their minor children, and respect for complainants' autonomy.\n\nIn addition to the Final Rule, the Department has released a fact sheet, a summary of the major provisions of the final regulations, and a resource for drafting Title IX nondiscrimination policies, notices of nondiscrimination, and grievance procedures. The Final Rule will be effective on August 1, 2024, and apply to complaints of sex discrimination regarding alleged conduct that occurs on or after that date. The Department is committed to supporting schools in implementing the final regulations and will provide technical assistance and additional resources to schools to support implementation and compliance.\n\nRead the Press Release\n\nThe Federal Register official publication of the Final Rule (April 29, 2024) PDF (4.0M)\n\nUnofficial version of the Department’s 2024 Title IX Final Rule PDF (4.4M)\n\nFact Sheet PDF (197K)\n\nSummary of Major Provisions of the Department’s 2024 Title IX Final Rule PDF (327K)\n\nResource for Drafting Nondiscrimination Policies, Notices of Nondiscrimination, and Grievance Procedures PDF (322K)\n\nApril 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Pregnancy Discrimination Investigation of Hinds Community College\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved an investigation of pregnancy harassment and disability discrimination involving Hinds Community College in Mississippi. OCR determined that the College violated Title IX after investigating allegations that the College failed to provide a pregnant student with necessary academic adjustments or necessary services during and after her pregnancy and, instead, encouraged the student to drop out of her program and complete it later. The College also violated Title IX by failing to respond in compliance with Title IX to the student’s complaints of pregnancy discrimination and harassment. OCR also identified a compliance concern relating to Section 504 because the evidence did not reflect that the College considered whether the student’s pregnancy complications constituted a temporary disability. The resolution agreement will ensure the College’s compliance with Title IX, Section 504, and their implementing regulations as they apply to requests for academic adjustments and necessary services based on pregnancy, pregnancy-related absences, and complaints of pregnancy discrimination.\n\nThe College’s commitments in the resolution agreement include the following: (1) revising its nondiscrimination notice, Title IX policies and grievance procedures to comply with Title IX; (2) publishing information on its website for pregnant students about their Title IX rights and how to seek academic adjustments, special services, or excused absences; (3) training its Title IX coordinator and other school employees involved in addressing Title IX requests from pregnant students regarding Title IX’s and Section 504’s protections for pregnant students and the academic adjustments and special services available to pregnant students; (4) tracking and documenting requests by pregnant students to ensure pregnancy-related adjustments are being provided; and (5) taking other measures to directly remedy the discrimination against the student.\n\nHinds Community College – Resolution Letter PDF (332K)\n\nHinds Community College – Resolution Agreement PDF (176K)\n\nApril 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Denton Independent School District in Texas\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved a compliance review of the Denton Independent School District in Texas. OCR’s review focused on whether the district’s use of restraint and seclusion during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years denied students with disabilities a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations.\n\nOCR’s review revealed concerns regarding the district’s compliance with Section 504 and Title II with respect to its restraint practices, including: (1) failure to timely initiate evaluations of students suspected of having disabilities after numerous restraints and failure to ensure restraint incidents are reviewed when evaluating and re-evaluating the individual educational needs of students with disabilities; (2) use of School Resource Officers (SROs) to assist with student restraints without ensuring SROs are properly trained in restraint in an educational setting and the district’s obligations to ensure students with disabilities are provided a FAPE; (3) failure to consistently record restraint incidents, including documenting information which would better enable the district to re-evaluate students’ individual needs; and (4) failure to provide adequate notice of the individual(s) designated by the district to coordinate its efforts to comply with Section 504 and Title II.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to: (1) convene Section 504 and/or Admission Review and Dismissal (ARD) committees to re-evaluate the needs of students identified during the review who may have been denied a FAPE as a result of the district’s use of restraint; (2) review and revise as necessary the district’s policies and procedures governing restraint, including the involvement of SROs in restraint incidents; (3) develop a process for the creation, maintenance, and review of records documenting each incident of student restraint; (4) develop a process to ensure accurate reporting of all restraint incidents to the Department’s Civil Rights Data Collection; (5) review restraint incidents involving SROs between the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years to assess impact on individual students and to inform the district’s policies and practices regarding SRO involvement in restraints; (6) review the district’s policies regarding the involvement of SROs in restraint incidents, including revising Memoranda of Understanding and district policy as necessary to ensure all policies and agreements include clearly defined roles and areas of responsibility for SROs, including when staff may involve SROs in restraints and how such incidents should be documented; (7) establish an annual review process for SRO involvement in student restraints; (8) establish a monitoring program to monitor the use of restraint in students in all district schools to safeguard student rights under Section 504 and Title II; (9) ensure that all staff who may be involved in student restraints receive training regarding the use of restraint on students, including the district’s policies and procedures relating to the recording of all incidents of restraint; (10) ensure that all staff receive training regarding the District’s obligation to provide a FAPE to students with disabilities pursuant to Section 504 and Title II; and (11) offer training to all SROs contracted by the district to serve on district campuses regarding the district’s policies and procedures regarding restraint, including recordkeeping procedures, as well as the district’s nondiscrimination obligations pursuant to Section 504 and Title II.\n\nDenton Independent School District – Resolution Letter PDF (321K)\n\nDenton Independent School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (191K)\n\nApril 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Pregnancy Discrimination Investigation of Hinds Community College\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved an investigation of pregnancy harassment and disability discrimination involving Hinds Community College in Mississippi.

At least in specific incidents, the district’s responses to harassment of Black, Asian, and Jewish students and to harassment based on sex were insufficient. OCR also found the district had actual knowledge of alleged student-to-student sexual harassment but failed to meet the requirements in the Title IX regulations. Additionally, OCR identified compliance concerns regarding the district’s responses to harassment of students with disabilities and Hispanic students and student-to-student harassment based on race and sex at its elementary schools; handling of what could have been considered formal complaints of sexual harassment under Title IX; and recordkeeping under Title VI and Section 504.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to take several steps, including: (1) providing individual remedies, as needed, for students subjected to harassment; (2) reviewing, revising, and disseminating policies, procedures, and forms; (3) coordinating district compliance with Title IX through the Title IX Coordinator; (4) conducting a climate assessment; (5) training students, parents, and employees; and (6) reporting to OCR about the district’s responses to harassment in school years 2024-25 and 2025-26.\n\nPark City School District – Resolution Letter PDF (445K)\n\nPark City School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (342K)\n\nMarch 2024\n\nU.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights Reminds Schools of Their Legal Obligation to Address Discrimination Against Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian Students\n\nThe Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a new Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) reminding schools of their obligations to address discrimination against Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian students.

Classmates also raised their arm in a “Heil Hitler” salute apparently towards the student, and multiple drawings of swastikas appeared on the student’s desk throughout the school year. While the District responded to most harassing incidents the student experienced, these responses were often haphazard, inconsistently enforced as well as inconsistently reflected in District documentation, did not consistently include effective or timely steps to mitigate the effects of the harassment on the student or other students, and did not appear to respond to escalating and repeated incidents.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the District to take several steps, including: (1) offer to reimburse the student’s parents for past counseling, academic, or therapeutic services to address the antisemitic harassment; (2) publicize an anti-harassment statement; (3) revise its Title VI policies and procedures; (4) develop or revise its procedure for documenting the School’s investigation of reports of harassment; (5) conduct Title VI training for School staff; (6) provide an age-appropriate information program for students at the School to address discriminated based on race, color and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics; (7) conduct an audit of complaints received during the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years; and (8) conduct a climate survey with students, provide OCR with a summary of the climate survey results, and the District’s proposed corrective actions in response to the survey results.\n\nRed Clay Consolidated School District – Resolution Letter PDF (322K)\n\nRed Clay Consolidated School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (138K)\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Releases List of Open Title VI – Shared Ancestry Investigations of Institutions of Higher Education and K-12 Schools\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the San Francisco Conservatory of Music entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, when responding to allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nOCR determined that the Conservatory’s response to the Student’s complaint that another student sexually assaulted and stalked her violated Title IX. OCR found that the Conservatory failed to: provide her with reasonable supportive measures; give her and the respondent written notice of the allegations and its grievance process; adopt compliant grievance procedures; offer both parties a chance to review relevant evidence; issue a compliant investigative report; hold a live hearing; make a determination about each allegation of assault and stalking; allow the Student to appeal; and address reports that the respondent had violated a no-contact order.\n\nThe resolution agreement commits the Conservatory to: (1) revise its policies and procedures; (2) train its Title IX Coordinator and staff who respond to reports of sexual harassment; (3) report to OCR how the Conservatory responded to such reports this year and the last two years; (4) give the parties a copy of the investigative report; (5) take steps to protect the Student on campus; (6) offer to reimburse the Student for health-related costs; and (7) allow the Student to retake for free any class adversely affected by the Conservatory’s noncompliant response.\n\nSan Francisco Conservatory of Music – Resolution Letter PDF (376K)\n\nSan Francisco Conservatory of Music – Resolution Agreement PDF (228K)\n\nNovember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Releases List of Open Title VI – Shared Ancestry Investigations of Institutions of Higher Education and K-12 Schools\n\nToday, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts to take aggressive action to address the alarming rise in reports of antisemitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and other hate-based or bias-based incidents at schools and on college campuses since the October 7th Israel-Hamas conflict, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights released a list of the higher education institutions under investigation for possible violations of federal law over the handling of Title VI complaints involving shared ancestry.

When the reports of the professor’s alleged sexual harassment were first made to the University several years ago, the University failed to take any action due to the mistaken belief that the University could not investigate a tenured faculty member and the mistaken belief that the conduct alleged did not state a Title IX claim because no allegation was made of inappropriate touching. Because of the University’s inaction, the professor allegedly engaged in retaliation against the students who first reported his conduct, and the alleged sexually harassing conduct persisted for several years. When students again reported the professor’s alleged sexually harassing conduct several years later, while the University initiated an investigation, it improperly ceased all Title IX activities upon notice of the Professor’s resignation even though it had several weeks upon which a hearing could have been scheduled before his resignation became effective.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the University to take certain steps, including: (1) complete its investigation of the sexual harassment complaint against the professor, and offer appropriate remedies if the conduct is substantiated; (2) conduct several years of file reviews of sexual harassment complaints made against staff, and complaints of sexual harassment made against the professor, and offer appropriate remedies, if the conduct is substantiated; (3) provide OCR with documentation of Title IX case file reviews for a period of two years following the execution of the agreement; (4) conduct a climate survey with students, provide OCR with a summary of the climate survey results and the University’s proposed corrective actions in response to the survey results; (5) revise its Title IX Policy and Procedures, provide Title IX training to University faculty and staff, and post its Title IX training materials on its website.\n\nArcadia University – Resolution Letter PDF (302K)\n\nArcadia University – Resolution Agreement PDF (267K)\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sex-Based Harassment Investigation of Taft College in California\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Taft College in California has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure the College’s compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, when responding to allegations of employee harassment based on sex, including sex stereotyping, of its students.\n\nOCR found that the college failed to respond as required by Title IX to repeated allegations from one of its students, who is transgender, that college employees harassed the student based on sex for more than a year, including through sex stereotyping and misgendering the student. OCR found that the College did not respond to these allegations to confirm their occurrence or redress the harm the student reported experiencing. As a result, OCR determined that the college subjected the student to a hostile environment based on sex that negatively impacted the student’s education.\n\nThe District’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: (1) offering to reimburse the student for counseling to address the effects of the harassment during the student’s enrollment; (2) reviewing and revising, as necessary, its policies and procedures to clarify that harassment based on sex includes harassment based on sex stereotyping; (3) training its employees who respond to sex-based harassment about the college’s obligations under Title IX; and (4) providing documentation to OCR demonstrating that the college’s responses to complaints of sex-based harassment during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years complied with Title IX.\n\nTaft College – Resolution Letter PDF (294K)\n\nTaft College – Resolution Agreement PDF (277K)\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Title IX Athletics Investigation of Morgan Hill Unified School District in California\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Morgan Hill Unified School District in California entered into a resolution agreement to ensure compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as to the athletics program at Live Oak High School.\n\nOCR identified compliance concerns that the district failed to provide female student athletes with equivalent opportunities with respect to equipment, scheduling of game times, travel, coaching, locker room and competitive facilities, medical and training facilities, and publicity. Evidence in the investigation included, for example, that the baseball program had two fields while the softball program had only one field that lacked features such as, lighting, a scoreboard, and a PA system that the baseball field had. OCR also reviewed evidence that some boys’ programs may have enjoyed charter bus transportation to games whereas girls’ programs had to rely on their own transportation. OCR also found evidence that the girls’ programs, as compared to the boys’ programs, may not have had similar quality equipment, equal access to locker rooms, and equitable publicity from the school’s social media accounts.\n\nThe District’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: (1) creating committees to ensure that differences in fundraising will not create disparities in athletic equipment, uniforms, or supplies based on sex; (2) renovating the softball facilities so that they are equitable to the baseball facilities; (3) giving female athletes equivalent opportunities to receive coaching and equitable transportation, publicity, and medical/training resources; and (4) training employees on the district’s obligations under Title IX and its application to athletics.\n\nMorgan Hill Unified School District– Resolution Letter PDF (284K)\n\nMorgan Hill Unified School District– Resolution Agreement PDF (288K)\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Resolves Compliance Review of New London Public Schools in Connecticut\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today resolved a compliance review of New London Public Schools in Connecticut with a resolution agreement to address the district’s handling of sexual assault cases, including those involving student and staff misconduct.\n\nOCR found that the district violated Title IX by not ensuring adequate Title IX coordination and oversight during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years, failing to adopt and publish Title IX grievance procedures that complied with Title IX, and failing to respond equitably to complaints of employee-involved sexual harassment. Notably, the district did not independently investigate allegations of sexual harassment by two employees because they were being investigated by the police and the Connecticut Department of Children and Families.\n\nOCR also had concerns regarding the adequacy of district Title IX coordination and oversight during the 2019-2020 school year, recordkeeping practices and responses to complaints of student-involved sexdual harassment, including that the district may not have taken sufficient action to end harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to: revise Title IX grievance procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX and consistency across related policies and procedures; its current recordkeeping proceedures provide OCR with response to all reports and formal complaints of sexual harassment between the 2021-2022 and the 2024-2025 school years; a written description of the Title IX Cooridnators(s)'s responsibilities; annual Title IX training for all district administrators, staff, Title IX Coordinators(s), investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process; and issue a student climate survey in grades 6-12 to assess any need for aditional changes.\n\nNew London Public Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (445K)\n\nNew London Public Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (279K)\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Resolves Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Folsom Cordova Unified School District in California\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the Folsom Cordova Unified School District in California has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure that its restraint and seclusion policies and practices do not deny students with disabilities a free appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR determined that the district violated Section 504 and Title II because (1) the district did not convene a group of knowledgeable persons to evaluate whether students with identified disabilities needed a change in placement when the district had reason to suspect that the students needed an evaluation or reevaluation due to the repeated use of restraints and time away from the classroom; (2) the district staff who were making placement decisions for students with disabilities at nonpublic schools (NPS) were not knowledgeable about the emergency procedures being used at the NPS in some instances; and (3) placement decisions were made in some instances entirely outside of the process required under Section 504. OCR also identified a compliance concern that the district may have failed to implement the Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) for some students and thereby denied those students a FAPE. OCR also identified a recordkeeping concern because the IEPs and BIPs for students placed in time away did not consistently address whether and how time away should be used, and other records were not always complete or accurate.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to: (1) revise its policies, procedures, and forms for restraint and seclusion; (2) distribute the revised policies to district staff and NPS employees; (3) ensure a process to create and maintain records about its use of restraint and seclusion; (4) provide training on the revised policies and the Section 504 FAPE requirements to teachers, administrators, and other members of IEP and Section 504 teams; (5) ensure that NPS staff serving district students receive training on the revised policies; (6) provide an individual remedy for students who experienced restraint or seclusion during the review period by convening their IEP or Section 504 team to determine if compensatory services are needed, and if so, by timely providing such services; (7) conduct a review to determine whether any other district students were denied a FAPE due to the district’s or an NPS’s use of restraint or seclusion from 2019 to the present, and to implement responsive remedies based on this review; and (8) implement a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion with students in district schools and NPSs to safeguard their Section 504 and Title II rights.\n\nFolsom Cordova Unified School District – Resolution Letter PDF (469K)\n\nFolsom Cordova Unified School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (421K)\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Disability Harassment Investigation of Allegheny Valley School District in Pennsylvania\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Allegheny Valley School District in Pennsylvania entered into a resolution agreement to ensure it complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations, when responding to disability-based harassment.\n\nOCR determined that the district violated Section 504 and Title II and their regulations when students subjected a student with a disability to harassment so pervasive that it constituted a hostile environment and the district failed to take necessary steps to protect the student, end the harassment, and assess whether the harassment impeded the student’s ability to access the district’s educational program. OCR’s investigation found that over six months, classmates repeatedly directed disability slurs at the student and both physically attacked the student and threatened to attack the student in a manner directly related to his disability.\n\nThe resolution agreement commits the district to take certain steps, including: (1) distributing a memorandum to all district staff affirming the district’s obligations pursuant to Section 504 and Title II; (2) training all School staff; (3) offering individual remedies to the Student, such as counseling, academic or other therapeutic services to remedy the effects of the harassment; (4) convening the student’s IEP team, as appropriate, to determine whether he experienced a FAPE impact due to the harassment; (5) reviewing all bullying incidents for a three year period at the School to determine any needed additional remedies; and (6) a climate assessment to evaluate needed additional supports to ensure a nondiscriminatory school environment for students.\n\nAllegheny Valley School District – Resolution Letter PDF (285K)\n\nAllegheny Valley School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (231K)\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Resolves Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Alpine School District in Utah\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced today that the Alpine School District in Utah has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure the district’s compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 when responding to notice of sexual harassment of its students by other students and employees. OCR found that the district failed to appropriately investigate reports of employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual assaults, including after they were reported to law enforcement, leaving affected students without redress. OCR also found that the district failed: to provide interim measures to alleged victims of the assaults; to take effective steps to prevent recurrence of substantiated sexual assaults and to remedy the hostile environment; and to consistently notify students and parents of investigation outcomes. The district also failed to consistently notify students, parents, and employees of its Title IX coordinator, to coordinate its efforts to comply with Title IX through this coordinator, and to adopt compliant grievance procedures. OCR also identified concerns with the district’s responses to off-campus sexual harassment, its training for employees, and its record-keeping, including that it reported only one sexual assault for OCR’s 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection, but later reported 20 student-to-student sexual assaults for that same year in this case.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to: (1) coordinate its efforts to comply with Title IX through its Title IX coordinator; (2) notify students, parents, and employees of its Title IX coordinator; (3) revise its Title IX policies and procedures; (4) disseminate a compliant notice of nondiscrimination; (5) train employees and students about its Title IX procedures and how to report sexual harassment; (6) review case files for reported incidents of sexual harassment from school years 2017-18 through 2019-20 to determine if further action is needed; (7) improve its record-keeping and report accurate data to the CRDC; (8) administer school climate surveys; and (9) report to OCR on the district’s responses to reports and complaints of sexual harassment.\n\nAlpine School District – Resolution Letter PDF (389K)\n\nAlpine School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (225K)\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Title VI Discipline Compliance Review of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools in North Carolina\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools entered into a resolution agreement regarding student discipline. The school district committed to take steps to ensure that its disciplinary practices do not discriminate against students on the basis of race in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. OCR’s investigation identified concerns that African American students may have been subjected to harsher discipline than white students with similar discipline histories and conduct, and that a lack of clarity in the district’s discipline code may have contributed to this potential different treatment.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the district to build on its previous efforts to ensure fair and equitable disciplinary policies and practices by reviewing and revising as needed its current discipline code; training administrators and staff on the code; collecting and analyzing discipline data; coordinating with local law enforcement agencies on School Resource Officer data collection, training, and monitoring; assessing its alternative school programs; providing information on its discipline policies for students and families; and submitting annual reports monitoring the effectiveness of its efforts.\n\nWinston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (547K)\n\nWinston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (185K)\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sex Discrimination and Harassment Investigation of Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Today announced that Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina entered into a resolution agreement to ensure compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with respect to responding to reports of sexual harassment and enforcement of its dress code.\n\nOCR’s investigation reflects that during the first week of the 2022-2023 school year, an individual posted on social media an anonymous threat of sexual violence against freshman girls at a district high school; and that staff members at the high school were generally aware of potentially harassing social media posts, including posts of a sexual nature, as early as February 2022. Based on its investigation to date, OCR is concerned that the district did not respond as required by Title IX to notice that students at the school may have been sexually harassed in a manner that impeded their access to the school’s education program and activities and that the district selectively enforced its dress code based on sex stereotypes, inconsistent with Title IX.\n\nThe district’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: (1) reviewing and, as necessary, revising its dress code to ensure it does not discriminate based on sex and informing people that they may contact the district’s Title IX coordinator if they believe the dress code has been administered in a discriminatory manner; (2) training staff at the high school about their Title IX obligations including with respect to responding to reports of sexual harassment, enforcing the dress code, and not separating students based on sex except as permitted by Title IX; and (3) reviewing and, where necessary, investigating reports of sexual harassment at the high school in accordance with Title IX and the district’s grievance procedures.\n\nNash County Public Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (309K)\n\nNash County Public Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (131K)\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Resolves Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Spectrum Academy in Utah\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Spectrum Academy in Utah has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure that its restraint and seclusion policies and practices do not deny students with disabilities their civil rights in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations. OCR’s investigation revealed that the Academy failed to hold Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings for specific students with disabilities to evaluate the impact on the students of repeated use of restraint and seclusion and failed to consider the need for compensatory services for these students. OCR also identified four compliance concerns related to another 26 students whom OCR identified as being restrained and/or secluded multiple times in two years. First, the Academy may have failed to consider the educational impact of the repeated use of restraint and seclusion on these students. Second, the Academy may have failed to re-evaluate them to determine if the repeated use of restraint and seclusion for these students caused them to miss instruction or services, denied them a free appropriate public education (FAPE), and indicated a need for more aids and services to ensure a FAPE. Third, the Academy did not evaluate the need for or offer compensatory services to these students for missed services and instruction. Finally, OCR identified a concern that the Academy’s recordkeeping regarding restraint and seclusion may have prevented the Academy from being able to determine whether its current array of special education and related aids and services was sufficient to provide a FAPE. OCR also noted significant inaccuracy in the Academy’s report to the 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), which suggests that the Academy’s system for maintaining records regarding restraint and seclusion may be inadequate to allow the Academy to accurately report incidents of restraint to the CRDC.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the Academy to: (1) revise and distribute its policies, procedures, and forms for restraint and seclusion to its staff to comply with Title II and Section 504; (2) train all teachers, administrators, and other members of IEP and Section 504 teams on the revised policies and the Section 504 FAPE requirements; (3) provide individual remedies for students who were restrained and/or secluded during the review period, by convening their IEP teams and by timely providing compensatory services where appropriate; (4) conduct a review to determine whether any other Academy students were denied a FAPE due to restraint or seclusion from 2019 to the present, and to implement responsive remedies based on this review; (5) maintain complete records about the use of restraint and seclusion and accurately report to the CRDC; and (6) monitor the use of restraint and seclusion to safeguard the civil rights of Academy students.\n\nSpectrum Academy - Resolution Letter PDF (530K)\n\nSpectrum Academy - Resolution Agreement PDF (219K)\n\nAugust 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Resolves Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Newark Public Schools in New Jersey\n\nThe Department of Education announced that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has secured a resolution agreement with the Newark Public School District in New Jersey to ensure the district’s compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 when responding to notice of sexual harassment of its students by other students and employees.\n\nOCR determined that the district discriminated against students based on sex by failing to respond to incidents of sexual harassment and assault and that it failed to coordinate its responses through its designated Title IX Coordinator. Specifically, OCR found that the Title IX Coordinator did not, and currently does not, coordinate the district’s efforts to comply with its responsibilities under Title IX. Additionally, OCR found that the district failed to investigate confirmed Title IX concerns about employees’ sexually harassing students and deferred its Title IX obligations to respond to such sexual harassment to a state agency for several years without ensuring those obligations were met. OCR further found that the district repeatedly failed to respond to incidents of student-to-student sexual harassment, to address its effect on targeted students, to prevent its recurrence, and to notify the parties of investigation outcomes. OCR also determined that the district did not consistently notify employees, students, and their parents of its designated Title IX Coordinator and that its notice of nondiscrimination and grievance procedures did not comply with Title IX. Lastly, OCR identified concerns about the district’s recordkeeping of sexual harassment incidents.\n\nThe district’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: ensuring that the Title IX coordinator coordinates all of the district’s efforts to comply with Title IX moving forward; developing a program to assess the effectiveness of the district’s Title IX anti-discrimination efforts; revising policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations; training staff and students regarding the district’s Title IX procedures regarding sexual harassment; maintaining required records about reports of sexual harassment; reviewing case files for reported incidents of sexual harassment of district students from school years 2017-2018 through 2021-2022 to determine if further action is needed to resolve each incident equitably; disseminating a notice of nondiscrimination that complies with Title IX; and administering an annual school climate survey to district employees and students at each district school.\n\nNewark Public Schools - Resolution Letter PDF (470K)\n\nNewark Public Schools - Resolution Agreement PDF (340K)\n\nAugust 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Issues Dear Colleague Letter on Race and School Programming\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a Dear Colleague Letter on Race and School Programming to guide schools on lawful programs to promote racially inclusive school communities. This resource clarifies the circumstances under which schools can – consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and its implementing regulations – develop curricula or engage in activities that promote racially inclusive school communities. The resource includes examples to help school communities assess their Title VI legal obligations and protections.\n\nThe resource explains that Title VI generally does not restrict school districts from holding assemblies, meetings, focus groups, or listening sessions that relate to students’ experiences with race in their school or community. The resource also states that school-sponsored or recognized groups or programs with a special emphasis on race, such as a student club or mentorship opportunity, that are open to all students, do not violate Title VI simply because of a race-related theme.\n\nSchools may be in violation of Title VI when they separate students based on race even if programming for each group is identical. Schools also may violate Title VI when they create, encourage, accept, tolerate, or fail to correct a racially hostile educational environment.\n\n\"Dear Colleague\" Letter PDF (638K)\n\nAugust 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Assault and Disability Discrimination Investigation of Pflugerville Independent School District in Texas\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved an investigation of sexual assault and disability discrimination regarding the Pflugerville Independent School District in Texas. OCR determined that the district violated Title IX by failing to respond equitably to notice that a student was sexually assaulted by another student in a school restroom in the 2018-2019 school year. OCR also determined that in the above school year, the district violated Section 504 and Title II by failing to provide the student with a required disability accommodation in one of her classes as provided by her Section 504 plan. In addition, OCR identified other related Section 504 and Title II compliance concerns.\n\nThe resolution agreement provides that the district will: (1) offer the student and her family a meeting to discuss the district’s handling of the sexual assault allegation and offer reimbursement for the student’s related counseling expenses; (2) designate a Title IX Coordinator; (3) conduct Title IX and Section 504/Title II training for relevant District and school staff; (4) provide OCR with information and documentation regarding sexual harassment complaints received in the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years; (5) develop and disseminate a sexual harassment climate survey to the school’s students; and (6) develop and implement a record-keeping system and procedures to document and preserve all sexual harassment complaints and related documentation.\n\nPflugerville Independent School District – Resolution Letter PDF (387K)\n\nPflugerville Independent School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (642K)\n\nAugust 2023\n\nU.S. Departments of Education and Justice Release Resources to Assist Colleges and Universities in Complying with U.S. Supreme Court’s Decision on the Use of Race in Higher Education Admissions\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s (ED) Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division (Justice) jointly released resources to help colleges and universities understand and comply with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v.

OCR had a concern regarding the District’s lack of a centralized system for tracking and maintaining Title IX complaint files, which resulted in significant gaps in its recordkeeping. OCR also identified a concern regarding the District’s failure to provide adequate Title IX training for its Title IX Coordinator, administrators, and staff. Additionally, OCR is concerned about the Title IX Coordinator’s ability to coordinate the District’s efforts to comply with its Title IX responsibilities while holding multiple positions in the District. Lastly, OCR also found Title IX violations and had concerns related to the District’s Title IX policies and grievance procedures.\n\nThe resolution agreement provides that the District will: (1) take the necessary steps to ensure the District does not discriminate on the basis of sex by reviewing and revising its Title IX grievance procedures and its notice of nondiscrimination, to secure compliance with the Title IX regulation; (2) develop and implement a centralized record-keeping system and procedures that adequately and accurately document and preserve all complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault; (3) provide OCR with information regarding the District’s processing of each formal complaint of sexual harassment and sexual assault filed with the District during the previous and upcoming school years; (4) provide Title IX training to District staff and age-appropriate education or other resources to students; and (5) conduct a climate survey to be distributed to its students and staff regarding sexual harassment, including sexual assault.\n\nGarland Independent School District – Resolution Letter PDF (344K)\n\nGarland Independent School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (191K)\n\nJune 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Agreement with Rhinelander School District to Ensure Compliance with Title IX Concerning Harassment Based on Gender Identity\n\nToday the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced the Rhinelander School District entered into an agreement to ensure compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 when responding to harassment based on gender identity.\n\nBased on the evidence in the investigation to date, OCR is concerned that the District response to the persistent harassment limited the student’s participation in school activities. OCR is also concerned that the District records miscoded sex-based harassment, including the use of a slur for gay people, as “peer mistreatment”; did not document the multiple complaints of sex-based harassment brought by the student and their parent; and did not adequately document the District’s responses. Moreover, the District Title IX Coordinator reported that she was unaware of reports of sex-based harassment of the student until after the complainant filed with OCR and therefore had not coordinated a response consistent with Title IX.\n\nThe District’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include evaluating whether compensatory services or other services are necessary for the harassed student due to the instructional time the student missed when attending in-person classes on an only part-time basis; providing training to all District administrators and staff regarding the District’s obligation to respond to complaints of sex-based harassment; providing age-appropriate information programs for students to address sex-based harassment, including what students should do if they believe they or other students have experienced such harassment; and conducting a climate survey to assess the prevalence of sex-based harassment and obtain suggestions for effective ways to address harassment.\n\nRhinelander School District – Resolution Letter PDF (229K)\n\nRhinelander School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (221K)\n\nJune 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sexual Harassment Investigation of Montgomery College in Maryland\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Montgomery College, Takoma/Silver Spring Campus, has entered into a resolution agreement to resolve a sexual harassment complaint. OCR’s investigation established that a College professor engaged in sexual harassment of female students during a class he taught by requiring the students to remove their shirts and wear only their bras – and then commenting on their bodies – ostensibly to demonstrate a medical assessment despite the fact that the assessment did not require the clothing removal, or the bodily commentary.\n\nWithin approximately three months of the initial report of the professor’s harassment, the College’s investigation confirmed that the professor’s conduct created a hostile environment on the basis of sex. The College terminated the professor’s employment and the College provided written notice of the outcome of its investigation to the student in the class who initially reported experiencing sexual harassment, and also offered supportive services to affected students. However, the College did not notify all affected students regarding the conclusion of its investigation, raising a concern that the College may not have taken necessary steps to ensure that a hostile environment did not persist for affected students.\n\nThe resolution agreement requires the College to notify in writing all students in the professor’s class that the College completed its investigation of the sexual harassment complaint against the professor and requires the College to provide OCR with the results of its 2022 Title IX climate survey and a narrative summary of the steps it has taken in response to any concerns raised by that survey in order for OCR to determine whether the College needs to take any additional steps to ensure College students are able to access their education free from discrimination.\n\nMontgomery School District – Resolution Letter PDF (255K)\n\nMontgomery School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (149K)\n\nJune 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Issues a Fact Sheet on Ensuring Meaningful Participation in Advanced Coursework and Specialized Programs for Students Who Are English Learners\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a new fact sheet discussing access to specialized or advanced educational programs and services for students who are English Learners (ELs). These programs and services provide valuable educational opportunities, and are often designed to boost college access, increase degree attainment, and improve occupational skills. Data collected as part of OCR’s Civil Rights Data Collection show that students who are ELs have lower participation in specialized and advanced programs.\n\nThe fact sheet explains the legal requirements that schools must follow to ensure that eligibility requirements and procedures for specialized or advanced educational programs do not screen out students who are ELs because of their limited English proficiency unless a program is demonstrated to require proficiency in English for meaningful participation. It also identifies kinds of practices that could, depending on facts and circumstances, raise concerns under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits schools from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. The fact sheet reminds schools that students who are ELs remain entitled to appropriate language assistance services while participating in advanced or specialized programs.

The fact sheets highlight specific challenges some migratory children and unaccompanied children may face while accessing public education. The fact sheets also explain where families can seek help and remind public schools of their responsibilities to migratory and unaccompanied children under federal civil rights laws. Specifically, public schools must 1) be open to all students, including unaccompanied and migratory children, regardless of their or their parents’ immigration status; 2) offer language assistance services to K-12 students who have limited English proficiency, including unaccompanied and migratory children; and 3) make information about enrollment, classes, and other educational programs and activities accessible to parents and guardians who have limited English proficiency.

OCR determined that the District discriminated against students based on sex by failing to respond appropriately under Title IX to notice of sexual harassment. Specifically, OCR found that the District repeatedly failed to address the effects of the sexual harassment on targeted students, to prevent recurrence of harassment on the targeted students, did not take sufficient steps to prevent recurrence of harassment, and failed to provide adequate notice of the investigation outcomes to targeted students and their parents. In addition, OCR found a failure, persisting today, by the District to coordinate its response to sexual assault and harassment incidents across schools as required by the Title IX regulations. As a result, the District had no system in place to monitor whether schools’ responses complied with Title IX requirements or to identify emergent patterns or systemic problems by school of Districtwide. OCR also determined that the District’s implementation of its current Title IX grievance procedures does not comply with the 2020 amended Title IX regulation regarding sexual harassment, that the District’s Title IX grievance procedures in place during the time period reviewed were inequitable because they treated complainants and respondents differently, and the District had not fulfilled its Title IX duty to publish those procedures to communicate to students, parents, and employees how to use them to file Title IX complaints of sexual harassment. The District’s commitments to resolve these findings include: (1) developing a program to assess the effectiveness of the District’s Title IX anti-discrimination efforts; (2) revising its Title IX policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations; (3) training its staff and students about the District’s Title IX procedures, how to identify what constitutes sexual harassment, and how to report such harassment; (4) maintaining required records regarding reports of sexual harassment; (5) disseminating a notice of nondiscrimination that complies with Title IX; and (6) administering a biannual school climate survey to District employees and students to evaluate the climate at each District school with respect to sexual harassment.\n\nVal Verde Unified School District – Resolution Letter PDF (350K)\n\nVal Verde Unified School District – Resolution Agreement PDF (289K)\n\nJune 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Resolves Racial Harassment Investigation of Beecher Community Unit School District 200 in Illinois\n\nToday the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that the Beecher Community Unit School District 200U entered into an agreement to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when responding to notice of the racial harassment of its students by other students.\n\nDuring the investigation, OCR found concerns that the District did not conduct adequate investigations of possible racially harassing conduct; did not appear to consider the totality of the circumstances and the cumulative effects of the harassment on the student; did not follow its grievance procedures or conduct complete investigations of possible racially harassing conduct; and did not appear to take escalating steps reasonably designed to prevent the harassment from recurring and remedy the effects of the harassment on the student and other students.\n\nThe District’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include taking prompt and appropriate responsive action to investigate the allegations that the student and other Black students were harassed on the basis of race during the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years; providing all school administrators, faculty, and staff with effective annual training regarding racial discrimination and harassment; he basis of race; providing age-appropriate orientation session for all school students regarding racial discrimination and harassment; developing a school climate survey to administer to students at the school to assess the effectiveness of training and to ensure the school is free of racial harassment; and maintaining documents relating to specific complaints or other reports of racial harassment of students to ensure that its files contain all information necessary to process complaints under Title VI.\n\nBeecher Community Unit School District 200U – Resolution Letter PDF (223K)\n\nBeecher Community Unit School District 200U – Resolution Agreement PDF (291K)\n\nMay 2023\n\nOffice for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Mingo County Schools in West Virginia\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved a compliance review of the Mingo County Schools in West Virginia with a resolution agreement to address the District’s handling of sexual assault cases, including those involving student and staff misconduct. During the investigation, OCR found concerns that the district did not complete investigation of allegations of serial misconduct and may have treated male respondents less favorably than female respondents. OCR also determined that the district violated Title IX through failing to identify a Title IX coordinator in a timely manner, failing to adopt and publish grievance procedures and a notice of nondiscrimination that complied with Title IX, and failing to adopt recordkeeping practices with regard to Title IX complaints. The resolution agreement will commit the district to ensuring a school environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex through hiring a Title IX coordinator and providing training; reviewing and revising its Title IX policies and submitting to OCR case file documentation sufficient to show that the district’s revised Title IX policies are compliant and effective; publishing a compliant notice of nondiscrimination; reviewing all complaints of student and staff Title IX misconduct during the period of the investigation; and conducting a survey of students and parents to identify additional changes.\n\nMingo County Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (492K)\n\nMingo County Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (271K)\n\nMay 2023\n\nU.S. Departments of Education and Justice Release Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division jointly released a Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline. The Resource describes how the Departments resolved investigations of 14 school districts in 10 states nationwide under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its regulations, and Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Prior to OCR completing its investigation, the District expressed an interest in resolving the complaint and OCR determined that it was appropriate to resolve the complaint because OCR’s investigation identified concerns that can be addressed through a resolution agreement. OCR identified concerns that communications at District school board meetings provided the District notice that its library book screening process may have created a hostile environment for students; and the District’s responsive steps related to the library book screening process were not sufficient to ameliorate any resultant racially and sexually hostile environment. The resolution agreement ensures that the District will issue a statement to students in the District explaining the library book removal process and offer supportive measures to students who may have been impacted by that process; and administer a climate survey of the student bodies at each of the District’s middle and high schools to assess whether additional steps need to be taken.\n\nForsyth County Schools – Resolution Letter PDF (345K)\n\nForsyth County Schools – Resolution Agreement PDF (205K)\n\nMay 2023\n\nU.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice Release Joint Letter on Postsecondary Online Accessibility\n\nToday, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a new letter regarding the Departments’ ongoing efforts to address barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in online services, programs, and activities that colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions make available to students and the public.\n\nTechnology plays an increasingly important role in education at all levels.
