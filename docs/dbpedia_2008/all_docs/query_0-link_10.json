        "text": "THE TOP\n\nAbortion key in Nevada and other Senate races\n\nHappy Friday morning.\n\nNew: President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will make a joint campaign appearance next week. They’ll do a Thursday event in Maryland together, the White House announced this morning.\n\nLAS VEGAS — Ever since the Supreme Court’s stunning reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats have told voters that “reproductive rights are on the ballot” and that they should choose accordingly for every single race. It’s a strategy that has yielded success for the party.\n\nBut this November, abortion is quite literally on the ballot in some states where vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents are fighting for their political survival. And Democrats want to use these ballot initiatives to their advantage, to counteract what is a flat-out terrible Senate map for them this year.\n\n“Regardless of whether you’re talking about a ballot initiative or you’re talking about a candidate, when you frame an election around the stakes for reproductive freedom, [voters] turn out — and they vote with us on this issue,” Jessica Mackler, the president of EMILYs List, told us before campaigning here with Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.).\n\nIt hasn’t always been easy for either party to rely on a ballot initiative — regardless of the topic — to be a difference-maker in federal elections. But Democrats believe that having an issue like abortion on the ballot will drive up turnout among those inclined to vote for Democrats yet may otherwise feel unmotivated to cast a ballot. It’s far from a sure bet, though, because while abortion rights are popular, that alone doesn’t guarantee a trickle-down effect for Democrats.\n\nThe ballot initiative and the Senate race need to “go hand-in-hand” in Nevada, Mackler added.\n\n“If you’re motivated to vote on this issue and you believe that these rights need to be restored at a federal level, then you know that [if] you hand control [of the Senate] to Republicans, they are going to pursue restrictions,” Mackler said.\n\nThe goal is to translate the popularity of abortion rights into Democratic wins across the board. This could help determine the outcome in Nevada and other states where the Senate and presidential races will be close.\n\nWith Republicans favored to win back the Senate, Democrats’ focus on abortion rights and leveraging the ballot initiatives to juice turnout could ultimately be the difference between a one-seat GOP majority or a three- to four-seat majority. Abortion is also on the ballot in Florida, although that’s a long-shot Senate pickup opportunity for Democrats. Arizona is another battleground that’s likely to have an abortion ballot measure in November.\n\nRosen vs. Brown: As we wrote earlier this week, Rosen is emphasizing local issues and an affinity for bipartisanship, while at the same time framing abortion rights in the context of which party controls the Senate. The latter could play well in Nevada when grouped in with the abortion ballot measure, but that’s not necessarily the case elsewhere.\n\nThe Nevada ballot initiative would enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. While Rosen’s GOP opponent Sam Brown told us he’d break with his party and oppose a national abortion ban, Brown won’t say which way he’ll vote on the ballot initiative. Brown does support the state’s existing 24-week law.\n\nBrown told us this week that Rosen is trying to “scare up votes” through a “dishonest fear campaign.”\n\n“Sen. Rosen is the one who is out of touch with Nevada voters,” Brown added. “She supports federal laws that would supersede Nevada law.”\n\nRosen and Brown haven’t clashed on any issue more intensely than abortion. Rosen accuses Brown of covering up his past record on abortion from his time living in Texas, where he once ran for office.\n\n“No matter how hard he tries to cover up what he did, he did it, he said it, and he’s only changed since he moved to Nevada,” Rosen told us. “Because these are Texas views. He can go back to Texas. This is not Nevada.”\n\nMore from Rosen:\n\n“My family’s been here 50 years. He’s been here about 50 minutes. He moved here to run for office.”\n\nGOP messaging: There’s no doubt that the overturning of Roe has put GOP candidates and incumbents in an uncomfortable spot. Many of them have admitted as much. Top Republicans have sparred internally over how to message the issue, including when Schumer held a number of “show” votes related to abortion rights earlier this summer.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his allies orchestrated a successful push to prevent the GOP platform from endorsing its stance on abortion — a federal ban — to the chagrin of anti-abortion activists.\n\nTrump has complained about how the Dobbs decision has altered the political landscape for Republicans, even though he paved the way for it with his Supreme Court picks.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump refused to say how he’ll vote on a ballot initiative in Florida that would block the state’s six-week abortion ban and allow the procedure for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Trump added that abortion has “become much less of an issue.” Obviously, that’s just wishful thinking.\n\n— Andrew Desiderio\n\nHave you entered our Congressional Recess Giveaway yet?

Like a 10-foot pole type of distance.\n\nOf course, Hogan has to do that in order to win in a deep blue state like Maryland. But even this tactic might not be enough to push the popular former governor to victory in November.\n\nWhile the race has become more competitive than usual, Hogan is still battling major headwinds from the top of the ticket. Trump lost the state by more than 30 points in 2020, while Vice President Kamala Harris has no doubt reenergized the Democratic Party since becoming the presumptive nominee.\n\nAsked how the Democratic shakeup changes the contours of his own race, Hogan said it was still too early to know. “I’m sure it’s going to make a difference in some way, but we’re not focused on what’s going to happen,” Hogan told us after a meeting with a local ironworkers union Thursday.\n\nBut Hogan acknowledged that he’s still the underdog — especially as Democrats try to nationalize the race. Here’s more:\n\n“My opponent really wants to make it about red versus blue. Just Democrat versus Republican. Probably take all the names off of the ballots and all of our records, and just say, ‘You have to vote blue.’ And our campaign is about, ‘Hey, let’s think about the red, white and blue.’”\n\nHogan is facing off against Prince George County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, one of two Black women running for the Senate this cycle. To prevail in November, Hogan will need to capture most Republicans and independents, plus a good chunk of Democrats willing to split the ticket.\n\nWith that in mind, it’s no surprise Hogan has presented himself as an independent-minded candidate who won’t be a rubber stamp for his party. Just consider this:\n\n— Hogan condemned Trump’s racial and sexist attacks on Harris, as well as vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) dig at “childless cat ladies.”\n\n“I’m very disappointed by it. What we really need to do is focus on the issues,” Hogan told us. “I have biracial grandkids, and we should never be focusing on race or gender or making fun of people or calling them names.”\n\n— The former governor congratulated Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on being selected as Harris’ running mate. The pair worked together when Hogan was in the governor’s mansion.\n\n— Hogan, who now calls himself “pro-choice,” has promised to support legislation to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\n— Hogan has vowed not to vote for Trump or Harris in November, saying he’ll likely write in a symbolic candidate instead.\n\n— After Trump appeared to endorse him, Hogan quickly rejected the offer of support. “We didn’t ask for the endorsement, we didn’t want the endorsement,” he told us.\n\n— Following Trump’s Thursday press conference, where the former president whitewashed the events of Jan. 6, Hogan posted on X that it “was not peaceful” and “must never happen again.”\n\nInterestingly, Hogan recently cut an ad spotlighting the late former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who infamously drew Trump’s ire for sinking legislation to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn our interview, Hogan said he views himself in the mold of McCain or the now-Independent Sen. Joe Machin (W.Va.), who had massive sway over the Democratic agenda. “I really do see that kind of a role,” Hogan told us. “I can be a key vote and a key voice for trying to actually put things together and get things done.”\n\nIf Hogan does land in the Senate, it would be a major coup for Republicans that could determine the balance of power. But it’s also clear GOP leaders aren’t always going to be able to count on his vote.\n\n— Melanie Zanona\n\nPro-Israel groups make their mark in Dem primaries\n\nAt the start of 2024, pro-Israel groups armed with significant war chests identified Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.) as particularly vulnerable incumbents.\n\nAnd after the two most expensive House primaries in history, Bowman and Bush have both fallen to more mainstream Democratic primary challengers — the first two Squad members to ever lose reelection.\n\nBut that’s likely to be the end of this cycle’s anti-Squad primary funding wars. And left-wing groups are relieved that stiff challenges to other progressive, pro-Palestinian members haven’t materialized.\n\nBowman and Bush presented uniquely promising territory for anti-Squad forces in ways that other vehemently anti-Israel politicians didn’t. The individual scandals that hampered the two incumbents, combined with strong challengers who have local ties caught the attention of outside groups.\n\nFor instance, although Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) has a primary next Tuesday, there’s been no similar groundswell of outside spending to boost her Democratic opponent, Don Samuels.\n\nOn television ad spending, AIPAC’s super PAC — United Democracy Project — spent a total of $18.3 million in Bowman’s and Bush’s races. A total of $12.3 million came to boost George Latimer over Bowman, while $6 million was allocated to help Wesley Bell take down Bush.\n\nBut according to AdImpact, UDP has reserved no money for TV ads in Omar’s primary. And fellow Squad member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) won her primary without even attracting a primary opponent on the same day Bush lost.\n\nThe story here? Pro-Israel forces looking to shape the Democratic Party in their image are picking their fights carefully. The massive outlays in Bowman’s and Bush’s primaries show that once they identify which member or candidate to go after, these interest groups are ready to go all in. There’s not a similar appetite to spend in longshot fights. A lot of money in just a few races, versus a lot of money in a lot of races.\n\n“Defeating an incumbent member of Congress is statistically the hardest thing to do in politics,” Mark Mellman, the head of Democratic Majority for Israel, told us. “This doesn’t happen very often, and so we’re not going to waste the donors’ money on races that we can’t win.”\n\nDMFI PAC dedicated significant resources to knocking off Bush, who Mellman called “one of the most bellicose, vituperative anti-Israel figures in Congress.”\n\nView from the left: Justice Democrats, the left-wing group closely associated with the Squad, believes that AIPAC hasn’t succeeded this cycle despite Bowman’s and Bush’s defeat.\n\nCommunications Director Usamah Andrabi identified Rep. Summer Lee’s (D-Pa.) primary victory as a setback for the pro-Israel group.\n\n“The day Summer Lee won her primary was the day they failed at their cycle goal,” Andrabi asserted.\n\nAndrabi noted that not one of the ads that UDP ran mentioned Israel. It’s a sign, in his eyes, that pro-Israel groups know their agenda isn’t popular with Democrats.\n\nLooking forward, Andrabi didn’t rule out Justice Dems-backed challengers next cycle to Latimer and Bell.\n\n“I don’t think anything’s off the table,” Andrabi said. “Next cycle, there’s a lot of incumbents who have been betraying the interests and needs of their community that should be put on watch.”\n\n— Max Cohen"
