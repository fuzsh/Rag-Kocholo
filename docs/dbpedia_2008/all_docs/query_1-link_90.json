        "text": "During its upcoming national convention, The American Legion will conduct a special Be the One Symposium focusing on the most pressing issue facing veterans today — mental health and, more specifically, suicide.\n\nThe second annual Be the One symposium will be held at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Aug. 22. The event is free but you can review the schedule and register to reserve a spot at this link. The sessions will be recorded and made available later for those unable to attend.\n\nIn 2021, The American Legion launched its Be the One platform with the goal of destigmatizing mental-health treatment, encouraging veterans to ask for assistance, and foster conversations to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nAmy Forsythe, an American Legion member and Navy reservist, will emcee the symposium. She also is the host of the monthly American Legion Be the One podcast.\n\nThe event will convene leading subject matter experts and organizations to address solutions to the suicide epidemic in health-care delivery, mental health, tech, AI and suicide prevention. The symposium offers an impressive list of participants, including:\n\n• Dr. Kelly Posner, the founder and director of The Columbia Lighthouse Project, Columbia University. She leads the initiative that has proven to be effective in educating people to know what to say when an individual is at risk of suicide.\n\n• Kevin Hines, one of the few survivors of a suicide attempt over the Golden Gate Bridge. He is now a best-selling author, public speaker and award-winning documentary filmmaker.\n\n• Marine Corps veteran Chris Earl, who will discuss the power of combating veteran suicide through gaming. He is the founder and CEO of Regiment Gaming.\n\n• Bill Brassard, Senior Director of Communications at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and Patrick Bertagna, CEO of Gunalert, who will discuss firearms safety.\n\n• Dr. David Rudd, who is a pioneering researcher in the field of mental health and PTSD treatment for veterans. He is a former president and distinguished professor of Psychology at the University of Memphis.\n\n• Rajeev Ramchand, who is co-director of the RAND Epstein Family Veterans Policy Research Institute; Senior Behavioral Scientist; Professor of Policy Analysis, Pardee RAND Graduate School.\n\nPlease note that the schedule is subject to change."
