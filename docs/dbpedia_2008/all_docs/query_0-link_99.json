        "text": "Overview\n\nPrograms and Funding\n\nTraining and Technical Assistance\n\nContacts\n\nResources\n\nOverview\n\nThe Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program (ICAC) helps state and local law enforcement agencies develop an effective response to technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and Internet crimes against children. This help encompasses forensic and investigative components, training and technical assistance, victim services, and community education.\n\nThe program was developed in 1998, in response to an ever-increasing number of children and teenagers using the Internet, an ever-increasing number of online images depicting child sexual abuse, and an ever-increasing amount of online activity by people seeking to contact and exploit children and teens.\n\nICAC Task Forces have helped state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct approximately 184,700 investigations, which led to the arrest of more than 10,800 offenders in FY 2023. The ICAC program works with approximately 5,500 law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and in FY 2023, the ICAC task forces conducted nearly 3,050 regional law enforcement trainings on child exploitation. Approximately 72,300 law enforcement officers, prosecutors and other professionals attended these trainings to learn cutting-edge techniques to investigate and prosecute ICAC-related cases.\n\nPrograms and Funding\n\nIn FY 2023, funding for the ICAC program totaled $40.8 million to support ICAC Task Forces and training and technical assistance. ICAC Task Force Program funding is supported under the Missing and Exploited Children appropriation included in the Department of Justice fiscal year appropriation.\n\nFunding History\n\nFiscal Year 2023—$40.8 million\n\nFiscal Year 2022—$31.2 million\n\nFiscal Year 2021—$34.68 million\n\nFiscal Year 2020—$34.73 million\n\nTraining and Technical Assistance\n\nThe ICAC Training and Technical Assistance Program was established to provide ICAC Task Forces and their affiliates with the training and technical assistance they need to conduct effective investigations and prosecutions. Training providers include the following:\n\nSEARCH, the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics, provides training related to social networking sites, peer to peer file sharing, wireless networks, and cell phone technology for law enforcement, prosecutors and allied professionals.\n\nThe National White Collar Crime Center provides training for law enforcement, prosecutors, and other stakeholders in the ICAC program to improve investigative, prosecutorial, and forensic capabilities; create and distribute guidelines, best practices, and investigative methodologies; and coordinate meetings with grantees and practitioners.\n\nThe Innocent Justice Foundation provides a comprehensive mental health and wellness program for ICAC task forces to address negative effects and trauma for individuals exposed to child sexual abuse images through their work.\n\nFox Valley Technical College (FVTC) provides training focused on investigative techniques and best practices for undercover operations to combat Internet crimes against children and site-specific technical assistance to ICAC Task Forces.\n\nThe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® facilitates training to law enforcement; prosecutors; and criminal- and juvenile-justice, child-serving, and healthcare professionals on issues related to missing and exploited children.\n\nContacts\n\nVisit the ICAC Task Force Contact Information section of the ICAC Task Force Program website for state-specific contacts and websites.\n\nResources\n\nOJJDP Publications\n\nAMBER Alert Field Guide for Law Enforcement Officers\n\nMay 2019.
