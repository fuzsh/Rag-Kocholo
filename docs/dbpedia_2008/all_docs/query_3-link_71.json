        "text": "NPR's top news executive defended its journalism and its commitment to reflecting a diverse array of views on Tuesday after a senior NPR editor wrote a broad critique of how the network has covered some of the most important stories of the age.\n\n\"An open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and now, predictably, we don't have an audience that reflects America,\" writes Uri Berliner.\n\nA strategic emphasis on diversity and inclusion on the basis of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation, promoted by NPR's former CEO, John Lansing, has fed \"the absence of viewpoint diversity,\" Berliner writes.\n\nNPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday afternoon that she and the news leadership team strongly reject Berliner's assessment.\n\n\"We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories,\" she wrote. \"We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.\"\n\nShe added, \"None of our work is above scrutiny or critique. We must have vigorous discussions in the newsroom about how we serve the public as a whole.\"\n\nA spokesperson for NPR said Chapin, who also serves as the network's chief content officer, would have no further comment.\n\nPraised by NPR's critics\n\nBerliner is a senior editor on NPR's Business Desk. (Disclosure: I, too, am part of the Business Desk, and Berliner has edited many of my past stories. He did not see any version of this article or participate in its preparation before it was posted publicly.)\n\nBerliner's essay, titled \"I've Been at NPR for 25 years. Here's How We Lost America's Trust,\" was published by The Free Press, a website that has welcomed journalists who have concluded that mainstream news outlets have become reflexively liberal.\n\nBerliner writes that as a Subaru-driving, Sarah Lawrence College graduate who \"was raised by a lesbian peace activist mother,\" he fits the mold of a loyal NPR fan.\n\nYet Berliner says NPR's news coverage has fallen short on some of the most controversial stories of recent years, from the question of whether former President Donald Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, to the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19, to the significance and provenance of emails leaked from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden weeks before the 2020 election. In addition, he blasted NPR's coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nOn each of these stories, Berliner asserts, NPR has suffered from groupthink due to too little diversity of viewpoints in the newsroom.\n\nThe essay ricocheted Tuesday around conservative media, with some labeling Berliner a whistleblower. Others picked it up on social media, including Elon Musk, who has lambasted NPR for leaving his social media site, X. (Musk emailed another NPR reporter a link to Berliner's article with a gibe that the reporter was a \"quisling\" — a World War II reference to someone who collaborates with the enemy.)\n\nWhen asked for further comment late Tuesday, Berliner declined, saying the essay spoke for itself.\n\nThe arguments he raises — and counters — have percolated across U.S. newsrooms in recent years. The #MeToo sexual harassment scandals of 2016 and 2017 forced newsrooms to listen to and heed more junior colleagues. The social justice movement prompted by the killing of George Floyd in 2020 inspired a reckoning in many places. Newsroom leaders often appeared to stand on shaky ground.\n\nLeaders at many newsrooms, including top editors at The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, lost their jobs. Legendary Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron wrote in his memoir that he feared his bonds with the staff were \"frayed beyond repair,\" especially over the degree of self-expression his journalists expected to exert on social media, before he decided to step down in early 2021.\n\nSince then, Baron and others — including leaders of some of these newsrooms — have suggested that the pendulum has swung too far.\n\nNew York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger warned last year against journalists embracing a stance of what he calls \"one-side-ism\": \"where journalists are demonstrating that they're on the side of the righteous.\"\n\n\"I really think that that can create blind spots and echo chambers,\" he said.\n\nInternal arguments at The Times over the strength of its reporting on accusations that Hamas engaged in sexual assaults as part of a strategy for its Oct. 7 attack on Israel erupted publicly. The paper conducted an investigation to determine the source of a leak over a planned episode of the paper's podcast The Daily on the subject, which months later has not been released. The newsroom guild accused the paper of \"targeted interrogation\" of journalists of Middle Eastern descent.\n\nHeated pushback in NPR's newsroom\n\nGiven Berliner's account of private conversations, several NPR journalists question whether they can now trust him with unguarded assessments about stories in real time. Others express frustration that he had not sought out comment in advance of publication. Berliner acknowledged to me that for this story, he did not seek NPR's approval to publish the piece, nor did he give the network advance notice.\n\nSome of Berliner's NPR colleagues are responding heatedly. Fernando Alfonso, a senior supervising editor for digital news, wrote that he wholeheartedly rejected Berliner's critique of the coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict, for which NPR's journalists, like their peers, periodically put themselves at risk.\n\nAlfonso also took issue with Berliner's concern over the focus on diversity at NPR.\n\n\"As a person of color who has often worked in newsrooms with little to no people who look like me, the efforts NPR has made to diversify its workforce and its sources are unique and appropriate given the news industry's long-standing lack of diversity,\" Alfonso says. \"These efforts should be celebrated and not denigrated as Uri has done.\"\n\nAfter this story was first published, Berliner contested Alfonso's characterization, saying his criticism of NPR is about the lack of diversity of viewpoints, not its diversity itself.\n\n\"I never criticized NPR's priority of achieving a more diverse workforce in terms of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. I have not 'denigrated' NPR's newsroom diversity goals,\" Berliner said. \"That's wrong.\"\n\nQuestions of diversity\n\nUnder former CEO John Lansing, NPR made increasing diversity, both of its staff and its audience, its \"North Star\" mission. Berliner says in the essay that NPR failed to consider broader diversity of viewpoint, noting, \"In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans.\"\n\nBerliner cited audience estimates that suggested a concurrent falloff in listening by Republicans. (The number of people listening to NPR broadcasts and terrestrial radio broadly has declined since the start of the pandemic.)\n\nFormer NPR vice president for news and ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin tweeted, \"I know Uri. He's not wrong.\"\n\nOthers questioned Berliner's logic. \"This probably gets causality somewhat backward,\" tweeted Semafor Washington editor Jordan Weissmann. \"I'd guess that a lot of NPR listeners who voted for [Mitt] Romney have changed how they identify politically.\"\n\nSimilarly, Nieman Lab founder Joshua Benton suggested the rise of Trump alienated many NPR-appreciating Republicans from the GOP.\n\nIn recent years, NPR has greatly enhanced the percentage of people of color in its workforce and its executive ranks. Four out of 10 staffers are people of color; nearly half of NPR's leadership team identifies as Black, Asian or Latino.\n\n\"The philosophy is: Do you want to serve all of America and make sure it sounds like all of America, or not?\" Lansing, who stepped down last month, says in response to Berliner's piece. \"I'd welcome the argument against that.\"\n\n\"On radio, we were really lagging in our representation of an audience that makes us look like what America looks like today,\" Lansing says. The U.S. looks and sounds a lot different than it did in 1971, when NPR's first show was broadcast, Lansing says.\n\nA network spokesperson says new NPR CEO Katherine Maher supports Chapin and her response to Berliner's critique.\n\nThe spokesperson says that Maher \"believes that it's a healthy thing for a public service newsroom to engage in rigorous consideration of the needs of our audiences, including where we serve our mission well and where we can serve it better.\"\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing Editor Gerry Holmes. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no NPR corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly."
