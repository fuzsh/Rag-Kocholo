        "text": "We are living through a historic election cycle in America.\n\nWhile the 2024 presidential election was initially set to be a rare presidential rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Biden’s decision to end his bid for reelection just three months before the election and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic party is equally as rare. Not since 1968 — another landmark year in American politics -– has a presidential candidate withdrawn from the race.\n\nIn a race already marked by unprecedented events, the 2024 election will also have an extraordinary impact on our civil liberties and civil rights. Beyond any one issue being on the ballot this November — freedom is on the ballot in no uncertain terms\n\nWhile the ACLU does not endorse or oppose candidates for elected office, we know that a potential second Trump administration and an administration led by presumptive nominee Harris will be drastically different when it comes to our civil rights and civil liberties. A second Trump administration will be disastrous for our most fundamental rights and freedoms, while a Harris administration will bring a mix of challenges and opportunities that largely leaves these rights and freedoms intact. At the ACLU, we’re prepared for either scenario. Our legal, policy, and advocacy experts have identified the constitutional challenges that each candidate will bring, and the concrete actions the ACLU will take in response.\n\nStarting next week, we will share our findings in a series of 13 memos — eight memos on a potential second Trump administration and five on a potential Harris administration — to be released through August. The memos will address a range of issues, including immigrant’s rights, abortion access, LGBTQ justice, racial equity, police reform, and more.\n\nTo move the national discourse beyond agonizing over potential challenges to analyzing potential solutions, our memo series outlines not only the threats to our freedoms, but also includes comprehensive, substantive, and actionable solutions the ACLU will use to block the punches — egregious attempts to ignore the Constitution — or lessen the blows.\n\nI believe in the strength of our commitment because I've seen what our organization is capable of accomplishing when our freedom is on the line. In 2016, the ACLU was the only national organization to issue a comprehensive plan for the policies of a potential Clinton administration, but also those of a potential Trump administration. That plan laid the groundwork for us to file 434 legal actions against the Trump administration, including the first lawsuit to halt the Trump Muslim Ban within hours of its enactment.\n\nOur detailed analysis of Trump’s policies foreshadowed a constitutional crisis that, nearly a decade later, continues to impact our nation as a whole. Today, our analysis once again prepares us to continue that fight, over the course of the next administration and beyond, just like we did in 2016.\n\nWhile recent events have shown that much can change between now and November, we must be prepared for the possibility that Trump may return to the White House. We know that a second Trump administration will be significantly more aggressive and effective in executing its plans to fundamentally erode our democracy, take away our freedoms, and violate our constitution."
