        "text": "In today's world, brands have to generate their own buzz with press releases. Consumers aren’t waiting for the daily newspaper anymore to get their news.\n\nInstead, they're scanning the latest headlines across multiple social media channels at once.\n\nPress releases help control the narrative surrounding your brand.\n\nWhether it's sharing a new product release or changes in your organizational structure, a regular cadence of meaningful news can help a company stand out and build mindshare with journalists over time.\n\nIn this post, we'll discuss:\n\nWhat is a press release?\n\nBenefits of Press Releases\n\nTypes of Press Releases\n\nSample Press Release Format\n\nHow to Write a Press Release\n\nPress Release Template\n\nPress Release Examples\n\nTips for Publishing Press Releases\n\nWhat is a press release/news release?\n\nA press release is an official statement (written or recorded) that an organization issues to the news media and beyond. Whether we call it a “press release,” a “press statement,” a “news release,” or a “media release,” we're always talking about the same basic thing.\n\nWhile the heading should contain action verbs, the first paragraph should answer the “who,” “what,” “why,” and “where.” The press release should also contain understandable language and a quote.\n\nMost press releases are succinct at just a page long – two pages tops.\n\nUltimately, companies want to provide enough information so that news outlets have sufficient material for publishing their own stories about whatever the company is announcing in the release.\n\nOne thing to remember is that press releases live in the public domain, which means your stakeholders and customers can see them.\n\nSo, instead of thinking of a press release solely as a ticket to earning news coverage, consider it as a valuable piece of marketing content.\n\nBenefits of Press Releases\n\nAside from helping your company generate media coverage, press releases offer several benefits.\n\nBrand exposure: Press releases can help create brand awareness by sharing your company's news, updates, or achievements. This exposure can attract potential customers and increase brand recognition.\n\nSEO benefits: Press releases distributed online can improve your search engine rankings. Including relevant keywords and links in your press release can help boost your website's visibility in search results.\n\nInvestor and stakeholder communication: Press releases are an effective way to communicate with investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders, keeping them informed about significant company announcements, financial results, or strategic initiatives.\n\nCrisis management: When you’re stuck in a challenging situation, a well-crafted press release can help control the narrative, provide accurate information, and manage public perception.\n\nWhile there's no cut-and-dried formula for what a press release should include, here are a few types of occasions to help you carve out a focus for your press release and determine what content would help you broadcast your news in the best way:\n\nProduct Launches\n\nThe product launch type of press release is valuable to get the word out about the new solutions your organization is offering to consumers.\n\nIt should emphasize the product's specs, pricing, availability, and any other details that may be valuable to consumers.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nOrganizational change is noteworthy enough to warrant a press release, especially for informing current and future stakeholders about the growth and trajectory of a company.\n\nTo announce an acquisition or merger, include details about all organizations involved, information about the merger or acquisition, and quotes from the leadership teams.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nSimilar to a new product launch, product updates and expansions are also ripe for promotion. Explain what the change is, why it was made, and how it benefits the user.\n\nEvents\n\nPress releases are an important component of event marketing to attract promotion from news outlets and other media sources.\n\nYou'll want to include:\n\nWhat the event is about\n\nWho should consider attending\n\nWhen and where it will be held\n\nPricing\n\nGrand Openings\n\nWhether you opened up a new office, relocated, or are opening for the first time, announce the details with a grand opening press release.\n\nAnnounce the date and location the grand opening will be held, who is involved, how the grand opening is being celebrated, and the reason for the move (if applicable).\n\nNew Partnerships\n\nSimilar to mergers and acquisitions, a press release announcing new partnerships is a mutually beneficial marketing tactic.\n\nTo effectively execute this type of release, be sure to write a summary about each company, why the partnership was created, who benefits, and any additional important details for current and future stakeholders.\n\nRebranding\n\nRebranding is a difficult thing for any business to do, and it can occasionally result in confusion and awkwardness.\n\nOne way to make the transition smoother is by announcing the rebrand with a press release, including details on what is changing, the reason for making the change, dates the changes go into effect, and quotes from the leadership team.\n\nExecutive Team Changes\n\nExecutives often serve as faces of the company, and a press release functions to kick off this role.\n\nIt may include biographical information to establish their credibility along with a photo and other pertinent details.\n\nAwards\n\nWhen it comes to business excellence, it's OK to brag. Press releases about awards and accomplishments serve to cement your organization as an authority in your space.\n\nSuch a press release includes information about the company and why they were given the award, information about the award itself, and details about the ceremony (if applicable).\n\nWhen formatting a press release, you want to write it in a newsy, straightforward way so a journalist who might write about it can imagine it as an article on their news site.\n\nTo start, here are the basics every press release should include:\n\nYour contact information located on the top left corner\n\nThe phrase “For immediate release” located on the top right\n\nA headline that quickly explains the announcement\n\nYour business location in the first sentence of the press release\n\nA quick bio about your company at the end of your press release.\n\nYou also might want to include “###” or another signifier to show the journalist that the release has ended. In the past, this prevented busy journalists from waiting or flipping the page for more information when there was no more news.\n\nHowever, this tradition is still adopted and highly-respected today.\n\nNow, onto the body of your press release:\n\nYour first paragraph should state what the announcement while providing some context around your business and what it does.\n\nThe next two to three paragraphs should include quotes from a company spokesperson or business executive to explain the “why” behind this announcement.\n\nYour last paragraph should be an “About Us” section that explains what your company is and what it offers.\n\nIn this example, Catbrella Inc., a fictitious ad agency that just gained its 10th Twitter follower after two years of paid social media efforts, announces its achievement in a press release.\n\n*Disclaimer: HubSpot is entirely responsible for the silliness of this faux announcement.\n\nWriting a press release to break important company news can help businesses grow better, but doing it right is just as important. Here's how to write a press release, like the one above, step-by-step.\n\n1. Write a compelling headline.\n\nYou‘ve got your announcement in mind, and now it’s time to get it down in words to share with your community, industry, and followers.\n\nJust like writing the perfect blog post title, setting up your press release for success starts with your headline. You only have one line to work with, which can seem scary, but consider your words carefully to make your headline captivating.\n\nHere are some tips to make your headline stand out:\n\nUse action verbs.\n\nBe specific.\n\nKeep it short.\n\nMost importantly, make it interesting: Keep in mind that reporters get dozens, if not hundreds, of releases each day, so invest the time to write a compelling headline.\n\nConsumers, on the other hand, see news stories all over their timelines. As such, your headline needs to be interesting enough to reel them in.\n\n2. Add more context with a subheadline.\n\nWhile your headline is meant to draw readers in, your subheadline gives readers a better idea of the news you’re sharing.\n\nWhen crafting your subheadline, aim to encapsulate your press release in one sentence. Make sure it supports the headline you crafted to entice people to keep reading.\n\n3. Convey the news value to the press.\n\nIf you want your press release to be newsworthy, you have to give readers a reason to care.\n\nA good way to ensure this is by using the reverse pyramid formula when writing your press release: Going from the most important information to the least important.\n\nWhile the first paragraph of your release should explain the who, what, where, the second paragraph should cover the why.\n\nReporters don‘t have a ton of time to sift through details and fluffy background information — they just need the facts that’ll help them tell your story to someone else from a position of authority.\n\nThere shouldn't be any new, crucial information covered after these sections because the readers could potentially miss them.\n\n4. Offer a tempting quote.\n\nOnce you‘ve set the scene, it’s time to bring your details to life with a quote that reporters can use for context around your announcement and help paint a picture of how your news affects the given industry, customer base, and landscape.\n\nIdeally, quotes will be from key stakeholders in your company including your executive team, project leads, or those directly impacted by your announcement.\n\nQuoting key figures and authorities underlines the importance of your development. The chosen quote should shape your narrative and emphasize the core of the announcement.\n\nDon't ask everyone in your office for a comment or feel compelled to quote all 25 people included in the acquisition. Pick one or two critical spokespeople and focus the quotes around their unique perspective.\n\n5. Provide valuable background information on the subject.\n\nIn this last paragraph, keep in mind that the reader should already have key details they need regarding your announcement.\n\nOffer details here that strengthen your narrative, like creative or noteworthy ways your company developed the project or announcement at hand. Or, when applicable, comment on the future implications of your announcement.\n\nAnother good way to add value to your press release is by using newsjacking. A process of relating your press release to something currently going on to make it more valuable to the journalist and reader.\n\n6. Summarize the “who” and the “what” in a boilerplate.\n\nTwitter is chock-full of reporters lamenting press releases or pitches that don't clearly explain what the company does or what the announcement is actually about.\n\nDescribe what your company does in clear, plain language and include a link to your company's website early on.\n\nIf you cite data, include a reference link for the data source, and make sure every name in the release has an associated title and company as well.\n\n7. Include contact information.\n\nMake it easier for journalists to reach out to your company by providing your media contact information.\n\nThis allows them to quickly get in touch with you to get additional details, schedule an interview, or request accompanying visuals or materials.\n\nIt can also help streamline the communication process and increase the likelihood of receiving media coverage or engaging in further dialogue with journalists or relevant stakeholders.\n\nWhen giving your contact information, be sure to include:\n\nYour contact person’s name\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\n8. Proofread before publishing.\n\nAs with anything else you write, you should always proofread your press release before sending it out to the media. You want to present your company in the best light possible, and typos can distract from your message.\n\nTake the time to do one final read-through before publishing.\n\nBetter yet, have an editor or colleague look at it. This gives you the opportunity to tweak sentences, fix any confusing parts, double-check the formatting, and ensure that it’s easy to read and understand.\n\nThe last thing you want is to announce big news with a typo that takes the public's attention over the subject matter.\n\nIn addition to proofreading your press release, utilizing a tool like HubSpot's AI paragraph rewriter can further enhance the clarity and coherence of your message.\n\nTo keep yourself honest on this front, ask a colleague to read the release without context and ask them to relay the information back to you. If they can't recall the who, what, or why get back to the drawing board.\n\nPress Release Templates\n\nNow, it’s finally time to write your press release. How do you even begin?

If so, a creative angle can help carry your content and increase the likelihood of social sharing.\n\nNow, to get you thinking on the right track, take a look at some creative press release examples below, the type of news each one is reporting on, and what makes the release unique:\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nType of press release: Acquisition\n\nImage Source\n\nThe first thing that stands out in this press release is the headline. It tells a full story without being too long:\n\nIt covers who's involved (Microsoft and Activision), what's happening (an acquisition), and why it matters (to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone).\n\nThroughout the press release, you get quotes from leaders in both organizations, helping explain the benefit of this acquisition and how it will move the industry forward.\n\nWhat I like: Context is everything. Toward the bottom of the press release, you get additional context surrounding each company's market share and how this acquisition will impact the industry.\n\n2. Flourish\n\nType of press release: Team and office expansion\n\nImage Source\n\nOrganizational changes can seem relatively boring. One way to generate some interest is to include visual elements to add more dimension to the story.\n\nIn this press release announcing a team and office expansion, venture capital firm Flourish shares photos of some new hires right at the top, immediately drawing readers in.\n\nThe release dives into the reason behind the expansion and the key areas of focus moving forward. Then, we get a quick bio for each hire featured in the image, which can help build excitement surrounding the brand's future.\n\nWhat I like: This author went the extra step and added visual elements in this press release, helping to draw readers in and give prominent names to faces.\n\n3. SuperCom\n\nType of press release: Event\n\nImage Source\n\nAs the shortest press release in the bunch, SuperCom shows that less is often more.\n\nIn this release, security solutions company SuperCom announced its participation in an upcoming conference.\n\nWhen it comes to events, the most important details are date and location. As long as you have those key pieces, everything else is a bonus.\n\nPro tip: Take time to get a quote or two from leadership to help get more buzz around timely press releases or event announcements.\n\nOne thing that would've elevated this release is a quote on who can benefit from attending this event and why, as a way to reel in potential attendees.\n\n4. HubSpot\n\nType of press release: Program launch\n\nImage Source\n\nWe've also crafted this comprehensive, easy-to-follow press release template complete with a promotional plan and considerations for your next announcement.\n\nWe use these same guidelines when writing and formatting our releases here at HubSpot, and created a faux, sample release to illustrate what content goes where and why.\n\n5. JetBlue and Spirit Airlines\n\nType of press release: New Partnership (in progress)\n\nImage Source\n\nIt's big news for business partnerships to be announced, and even bigger when it's between household names.\n\nJetBlue and Spirit Airlines have been making headlines for divestiture news and have kept the public up to snuff on the current state of the agreement.\n\nWhat I like: Readers get to see multiple quotes from JetBlue's CEO, and get to know which exact airport holdings can be affected and transferred if the deal is made official.\n\n6. Southwest Airlines Press Release\n\nType of press release: Service changes and improvements\n\nImage source\n\nThis press release from Southwest Airlines gives a detailed update on new additions coming to customers. Though the release is longer than most, it's full of valuable information, such as why these changes are coming and their benefits.\n\nWhat I like: The press release includes statistics to back the company's decision. For added convenience, Southwest Airlines summarizes the most important details at the top of the long press release.\n\n7. Bank of America\n\nType of press release: Partnership Announcement\n\nImage source\n\nBank of America announces a partnership between Merrill and IMG Academy that will bring financial literacy to students using Bank of America an education resource.\n\nWhat I like: The press release includes a video message from Gregory McGauley Head of Merrill. Video can add value to your press release and make the information easier to digest.\n\n8. Rally House\n\nType of press release: New Location Opening\n\nImage source\n\nThis release is short and simple, and it announces the opening of a new location.\n\nWhat I like: The release includes a quote from Rally House's VP of Marketing Strategy. Quotes can lend legitimacy to your press release.\n\n9. Easy on Hold\n\nType of press release: New Feature Announcement\n\nImage source\n\nEasy on Hold announces a new feature, EOH AI Studio, that allows clients to create and download IVR and auto-attendant prompts.\n\nWhat I like: The press release succinctly sums up the feature with a bulleted list of its tools and uses.\n\n10. Warner Bros. World Yas Island\n\nType of press release: Partnership Announcement\n\nImage source\n\nWarner Bros. World is launching its first-ever branded aircraft and exclusive themed lounge at Zayed International Airport, according to this press release.\n\nWhat I like: The press release bullets the most important information at the top, and it includes a behind-the-scenes video of the aircraft.\n\nTips for Publishing Press Releases\n\nWriting a press release is really only half the battle. Once you‘re finished with production, it’ll be time to focus on distribution.\n\nOf course, we're all familiar with the traditional distribution levers we can pull, which include publishing the press release on our website/blog as well as sharing the press release with our followers/subscribers via social media and email.\n\nTo get the maximum amount of distribution possible, here are some tips you can follow.\n\n1. Reach out to specific journalists.\n\nInstead of blasting a press release out to every journalist you can find an email address for, focus on a few journalists who have experience covering your industry (and company, hopefully) and send them personalized messages.\n\nConnect the dots. Show why what you wrote connects to what they write.\n\nPro tip: Meltwater's press distribution service integrates with the Meltwater media database that connects these dots for you.\n\n2. Send the release to top journalists the day before.\n\nGive journalists some time to craft a story around your press release by sending it to them — under embargo — the day before it officially goes live.\n\n“Under embargo” just means they aren't allowed to share the information in the press release until the time you specify.\n\n3. To avoid competition, don't publish your release on the hour.\n\nIf you're publishing your press release on a distribution service like PR Newswire or Business Wire, avoid publishing it on the hour (e.g., 1 p.m., or 3 p.m., or 5 p.m.).\n\nThe reason? Most companies schedule their releases to go out on the hour, which means if your release goes out on the hour too, it's more likely to get lost in the shuffle.\n\nInstead, try going with a more distinct time (e.g., 1:12 p.m., or 3:18 p.m., or 5:22 p.m.).\n\n4. Share your media coverage.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, and your press release gets picked up by the media, your job still isn't finished.\n\nTo keep the buzz going, you can release a “second wave” of distribution by sharing the specific stories that news outlets write based on your press release.\n\nPro tip: You can also share the news on your digital channels, like social media and email, to bring awareness to your announcement.\n\nHow To Stand Out In The News\n\nThe key to keeping your PR strategy new school is forgetting preconceived notions of what public relations is and instead focusing on creating highly remarkable content.\n\nInstead of ditching releases as a tactic, give them a modern makeover to make them more useful for your marketing.\n\nThink about how you've used inbound methods to transform your marketing strategies to be more personalized, approachable, and build relationships.\n\nThose same principles apply to your PR strategy: Create content to craft your own story and use tactful outreach to get the media familiar with (and excited about) your brand.\n\nEditor's note: This post was originally published in November 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness."
