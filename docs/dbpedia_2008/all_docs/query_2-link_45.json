Beginning in 2023, the IRA contribution limit is increased to $6,500 ($7,500 for individuals age 50 or older) from $6,000 ($7,000 for individuals age 50 or older).\n\nIncrease in required minimum distribution age. Individuals who reach age 72 after December 31, 2022, may delay receiving their required minimum distributions until April 1 of the year following the year in which they turn age 73.\n\nModified AGI limit for traditional IRA contributions. For 2023, if you are covered by a retirement plan at work, your deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA is reduced (phased out) if your modified AGI is:\n\nMore than $116,000 but less than $136,000 for a married couple filing a joint return or a qualifying surviving spouse,\n\nMore than $73,000 but less than $83,000 for a single individual or head of household, or\n\nLess than $10,000 for a married individual filing a separate return.\n\nModified AGI limit for certain married individuals.\n\nIf you are married and your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work and you aren’t, and you live with your spouse or file a joint return, your deduction is phased out if your modified AGI is more than $218,000 (up from $204,000 for 2022) but less than $228,000 (up from $214,000 for 2022).

Beginning with distributions made after December 31, 2023, a beneficiary of a section 529 qualified tuition program is permitted to roll over a distribution from the section 529 account to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary if certain requirements are met.\n\nThe rollover must be paid through a trustee-to-trustee transfer.\n\nThe rollover amount cannot be more than the Roth IRA annual contributions limit.\n\nThe rollover must be from a section 529 account that has been open for more than 15 years.\n\nThe distribution is paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer (rollover) to a Roth IRA maintained for the benefit of the designated beneficiary. The distribution cannot exceed the aggregate amount contributed to the program (and earnings attributed to the contributed amount) before the 5-year period ending on the date of the distribution.A distribution made after December 31, 2023, and before April 15, 2024, that is rolled over to a Roth IRA by April 15, 2024, and designated for 2023 would be reported as a Roth IRA contribution for 2023.For more information, see Trustee-to-Trustee Transfer and Can You Move Amounts Into a Roth IRA.\n\nWhat’s New for 2024\n\nIRA contribution limit increased for 2024. Beginning in 2024, the IRA contribution limit is increased to $7,000 ($8,000 for individuals age 50 or older) from $6,500 ($7,500 for individuals age 50 or older).\n\nModified AGI limit for traditional IRA contributions increased. For 2024, if you are covered by a retirement plan at work, your deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA is reduced (phased out) if your modified AGI is:\n\nMore than $123,000 but less than $143,000 for a married couple filing a joint return or a qualifying surviving spouse,\n\nMore than $77,000 but less than $87,000 for a single individual or head of household, or\n\nLess than $10,000 for a married individual filing a separate return.\n\nModified AGI limit for certain married individuals increased.\n\nIf you are married and your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work and you aren’t, and you live with your spouse or file a joint return, your deduction is phased out if your modified AGI is more than $230,000 (up from $218,000 for 2023) but less than $240,000 (up from $228,000 for 2023). If your modified AGI is $240,000 or more, you can’t take a deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA.\n\nModified AGI limit for Roth IRA contributions increased. For 2024, your Roth IRA contribution limit is reduced (phased out) in the following situations.\n\nYour filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse and your modified AGI is at least $230,000.

You can’t make a Roth IRA contribution if your modified AGI is $10,000 or more.\n\nQualified disaster tax relief. The special rules that provide for tax-favored withdrawals and repayments from certain qualified plans for taxpayers who suffered an economic loss as a result of a qualified disaster were made permanent by the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022. A qualified disaster is a major disaster that occurred on or after January 26, 2021, and was declared by the President after December 27, 2020, under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Act. For more information, see Disaster-Related Relief in Pub. 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\n\nCertain corrective distributions not subject to 10% early distribution tax. Beginning on December 29, 2022, the 10% additional tax on early distributions will not apply to a corrective IRA distribution, which consists of an excessive contribution (a contribution greater than the IRA contribution limit) and any earnings allocable to the excessive contribution, as long as the corrective distribution is made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return.\n\nDivorce or separation instruments after 2018. Amounts paid as alimony or separate maintenance payments under a divorce or separation instrument executed after 2018 won't be deductible by the payer. Such amounts also won't be includible in the income of the recipient. The same is true of alimony paid under a divorce or separation instrument executed before 2019 and modified after 2018, if the modification expressly states that the alimony isn't deductible to the payer or includible in the income of the recipient. For more information, see Pub. 504.\n\nIRA interest. Although interest earned from your IRA is generally not taxed in the year earned, it isn’t tax-exempt interest. Tax on your traditional IRA is generally deferred until you take a distribution. Don’t report this interest on your return as tax-exempt interest. For more information on tax-exempt interest, see the instructions for your tax return.\n\nPhotographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis publication discusses contributions to individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). An IRA is a personal savings plan that gives you tax advantages for setting aside money for retirement. For information about distributions (including rollovers) from an IRA, see Pub. 590-B.\n\nWhat are some tax advantages of an IRA?\n\nTwo tax advantages of an IRA are that:\n\nContributions you make to an IRA may be fully or partially deductible, depending on which type of IRA you have and on your circumstances; and\n\nGenerally, amounts in your IRA (including earnings and gains) aren’t taxed until distributed. In some cases, amounts aren’t taxed at all if distributed according to the rules.\n\nWhat's in this publication?\n\nThis publication discusses contributions to traditional and Roth IRAs. It explains the rules for:\n\nSetting up an IRA,\n\nContributing to an IRA,\n\nTransferring money or property to and from an IRA, and\n\nTaking a credit for contributions to an IRA.\n\nIt also explains the penalties and additional taxes that apply when the rules aren’t followed.

See How Much Can Be Contributed? and Table 2-1 in chapter 2. Can I deduct contributions to a Yes. You may be able to deduct your contributions to a traditional IRA depending on your income, filing status, whether you are covered by a retirement plan at work, and whether you receive social security benefits. See How Much Can You Deduct? in chapter 1. No. You can never deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. See What Is a Roth IRA? in chapter 2. Do I have to file a form just because I contribute to a Not unless you make nondeductible contributions to your traditional IRA. In that case, you must file Form 8606. See Nondeductible Contributions in chapter 1. No. You don’t have to file a form if you contribute to a Roth IRA. See Contributions not reported in chapter 2.\n\n1. Traditional IRAs\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chapter discusses the original IRA. In this publication, the original IRA (sometimes called an ordinary or regular IRA) is referred to as a traditional IRA. A traditional IRA is any IRA that isn’t a Roth IRA or a SIMPLE IRA. The following are two advantages of a traditional IRA.\n\nYou may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to it, depending on your circumstances.\n\nGenerally, amounts in your IRA, including earnings and gains, aren’t taxed until they are distributed.\n\nWho Can Open a Traditional IRA?\n\nYou can open and make contributions to a traditional IRA if you (or, if you file a joint return, your spouse) received taxable compensation during the year.\n\nYou can have a traditional IRA whether or not you are covered by any other retirement plan. However, you may not be able to deduct all of your contributions if you or your spouse are covered by an employer retirement plan. See How Much Can You Deduct, later.\n\n. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2019, the rule that you are not able to make contributions to your traditional IRA for the year in which you reach age 70½ and all later years has been repealed..\n\nBoth spouses have compensation.\n\nIf both you and your spouse have compensation, each of you can open an IRA. You can’t both participate in the same IRA. If you file a joint return, only one of you needs to have compensation.\n\nWhat Is Compensation?\n\nGenerally, compensation is what you earn from working. For a summary of what compensation does and doesn’t include, see Table 1-1. Compensation includes all of the items discussed next (even if you have more than one type).\n\nWages, salaries, etc.\n\nWages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other amounts you receive for providing personal services are compensation. The IRS treats as compensation any amount properly shown in box 1 (Wages, tips, other compensation) of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11 (Nonqualified plans). A scholarship or fellowship is generally taxable compensation only if it is in box 1 of your Form W-2. However, for tax years beginning after 2019, certain non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments not reported to you on Form W-2 are treated as taxable compensation for IRA purposes. These amounts include taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments made to aid you in the pursuit of graduate or postdoctoral study and included in your gross income under the rules discussed in chapter 1 of Pub. 970, Tax Benefits for Education.\n\nCommissions.\n\nAn amount you receive that is a percentage of profits or sales price is compensation.\n\nSelf-employment income.\n\nIf you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or a partner), compensation is the net earnings from your trade or business (provided your personal services are a material income-producing factor) reduced by the total of:\n\nThe deduction for contributions made on your behalf to retirement plans, and\n\nThe deduction allowed for the deductible part of your self-employment taxes.\n\nCompensation includes earnings from self-employment even if they aren’t subject to self-employment tax because of your religious beliefs.\n\nSelf-employment loss.\n\nIf you have a net loss from self-employment, don’t subtract the loss from your salaries or wages when figuring your total compensation.\n\nAlimony and separate maintenance.\n\nFor IRA purposes, compensation includes any taxable alimony and separate maintenance payments you receive under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance but only with respect to divorce or separation instruments executed on or before December 31, 2018, that have not been modified to exclude such amounts.\n\nNontaxable combat pay.\n\nIf you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, compensation includes any nontaxable combat pay you received. This amount should be reported in box 12 of your 2023 Form W-2 with code Q.\n\nGraduate or postdoctoral study.\n\nA scholarship or fellowship is generally taxable compensation only if it is in box 1 of your Form W-2. However, for tax years beginning after 2019, certain non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments not reported to you on Form W-2 are treated as taxable compensation for IRA purposes. These amounts include taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments made to aid you in the pursuit of graduate or postdoctoral study and included in your gross income under the rules discussed in chapter 1 of Pub. 970.\n\nTable 1-1. Compensation for Purposes of an IRA\n\nIncludes... Doesn’t include... earnings and profits from\n\nproperty. wages, salaries, etc. interest and\n\ndividend income. commissions. pension or annuity\n\nincome. self-employment income. deferred compensation. taxable alimony and separate maintenance. income from certain\n\npartnerships. nontaxable combat pay. any amounts you exclude\n\nfrom income. taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.\n\nWhat Isn’t Compensation?\n\nCompensation doesn’t include any of the following items.\n\nEarnings and profits from property, such as rental income, interest income, and dividend income.\n\nPension or annuity income.\n\nDeferred compensation received (compensation payments postponed from a past year).\n\nIncome from a partnership for which you don’t provide services that are a material income-producing factor.\n\nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) payments reported on Schedule SE (Form 1040), line 1b.\n\nAny amounts (other than combat pay) you exclude from income, such as foreign earned income and housing costs.\n\nWhen Can a Traditional IRA Be Opened?\n\nYou can open a traditional IRA at any time. However, the time for making contributions for any year is limited. See When Can Contributions Be Made, later.\n\nHow Can a Traditional IRA Be Opened?\n\nYou can open different kinds of IRAs with a variety of organizations. You can open an IRA at a bank or other financial institution or with a mutual fund or life insurance company. You can also open an IRA through your stockbroker. Any IRA must meet Internal Revenue Code requirements. The requirements for the various arrangements are discussed below.\n\nKinds of traditional IRAs.\n\nYour traditional IRA can be an individual retirement account or annuity. It can be part of either a SEP or an employer or employee association trust account.\n\nIndividual Retirement Account\n\nAn individual retirement account is a trust or custodial account set up in the United States for the exclusive benefit of you or your beneficiaries. The account is created by a written document. The document must show that the account meets all of the following requirements.\n\nThe trustee or custodian must be a bank, a federally insured credit union, a savings and loan association, or an entity approved by the IRS to act as trustee or custodian.\n\nThe trustee or custodian generally can’t accept contributions of more than the deductible amount for the year. However, rollover contributions and employer contributions to a SEP can be more than this amount.\n\nContributions, except for rollover contributions, must be in cash. See Rollovers, later.\n\nYou must have a nonforfeitable right to the amount at all times.\n\nMoney in your account can’t be used to buy a life insurance policy.\n\nAssets in your account can’t be combined with other property, except in a common trust fund or common investment fund.\n\nYou must start receiving distributions by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 72 (or if you become age 72 in 2023 or later, April 1, after reaching age 73). See Pub. 590-B for more information about required minimum distributions (RMDs) and other distribution rules.\n\nIndividual Retirement Annuity\n\nYou can open an individual retirement annuity by purchasing an annuity contract or an endowment contract from a life insurance company.\n\nAn individual retirement annuity must be issued in your name as the owner, and either you or your beneficiaries who survive you are the only ones who can receive the benefits or payments.\n\nAn individual retirement annuity must meet all the following requirements.\n\nYour entire interest in the contract must be nonforfeitable.\n\nThe contract must provide that you can’t transfer any portion of it to any person other than the issuer.\n\nThere must be flexible premiums so that if your compensation changes, your payment can also change. This provision applies to contracts issued after November 6, 1978.\n\nThe contract must provide that contributions can’t be more than the deductible amount for an IRA for the year, and that you must use any refunded premiums to pay for future premiums or to buy more benefits before the end of the calendar year after the year in which you receive the refund.\n\nDistributions must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 72 (or if you become age 72 in 2023 or later, April 1, after reaching age 73). See Pub. 590-B for more information about required minimum distributions (RMDs) and other distribution rules.\n\nIndividual Retirement Bonds\n\nThe sale of individual retirement bonds issued by the federal government was suspended after April 30, 1982. The bonds have the following features.\n\nThey stop earning interest when you reach age 70½. If you die, interest will stop 5 years after your death, or on the date you would have reached age 70½, whichever is earlier.\n\nYou can’t transfer the bonds.\n\nIf you cash (redeem) the bonds before the year in which you reach age 59½, you may be subject to a 10% additional tax. See Pub. 590-B for more information about the age 59½ rule for early distributions and other distribution rules. You can roll over redemption proceeds into IRAs.\n\nSIMPLE IRAs\n\nA SIMPLE IRA plan is a tax-favored retirement plan that certain small employers (including self-employed employees) can set up for the benefit of their employees. Your participation in your employer's SIMPLE IRA plan doesn’t prevent you from making contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. See Pub. 560 for more information about SIMPLE IRAs.\n\nSimplified Employee Pension (SEP)\n\nA SEP is a written arrangement that allows your employer to make deductible contributions to a traditional IRA (a SEP IRA) set up for you to receive such contributions. Generally, distributions from SEP IRAs are subject to the withdrawal and tax rules that apply to traditional IRAs. See Pub. 560 for more information about SEPs.\n\nEmployer and Employee Association Trust Accounts\n\nYour employer or your labor union or other employee association can set up a trust to provide individual retirement accounts for employees or members. The requirements for individual retirement accounts apply to these traditional IRAs.\n\nRequired Disclosures\n\nThe trustee or issuer (sometimes called the sponsor) of your traditional IRA must generally give you a disclosure statement at least 7 days before you open your IRA. However, the sponsor doesn’t have to give you the statement until the date you open (or purchase, if earlier) your IRA, provided you are given at least 7 days from that date to revoke the IRA.\n\nThe disclosure statement must explain certain items in plain language. For example, the statement should explain when and how you can revoke the IRA, and include the name, address, and telephone number of the person to receive the notice of cancellation. This explanation must appear at the beginning of the disclosure statement.\n\nIf you revoke your IRA within the revocation period, the sponsor must return to you the entire amount you paid. The sponsor must report on the appropriate IRS forms both your contribution to the IRA (unless it was made by a trustee-to-trustee transfer) and the amount returned to you. These requirements apply to all sponsors.\n\nHow Much Can Be Contributed?\n\nThere are limits and other rules that affect the amount that can be contributed to a traditional IRA. These limits and rules are explained below.\n\nCommunity property laws.\n\nExcept as discussed later under Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit, each spouse figures their limit separately, using their own compensation. This is the rule even in states with community property laws.\n\nBrokers' commissions.\n\nBrokers' commissions paid in connection with your traditional IRA are subject to the contribution limit. For information about whether you can deduct brokers' commissions, see Brokers' commissions, later, under How Much Can You Deduct.\n\nTrustees' fees.\n\nTrustees' administrative fees aren’t subject to the contribution limit. For information about whether you can deduct trustees' fees, see Trustees' fees, later, under How Much Can You Deduct.\n\nQualified reservist repayments.\n\nIf you were a member of a reserve component and you were ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001, you may be able to contribute (repay) to an IRA amounts equal to any qualified reservist distributions (defined under Early Distributions in Pub. 590-B) you received. You can make these repayment contributions even if they would cause your total contributions to the IRA to be more than the general limit on contributions. To be eligible to make these repayment contributions, you must have received a qualified reservist distribution from an IRA or from a section 401(k) or 403(b) plan or a similar arrangement. See Early Distributions in Pub. 590-B for more information on qualified reservist distributions.\n\nLimit.\n\nYour qualified reservist repayments can’t be more than your qualified reservist distributions.\n\nWhen repayment contributions can be made.\n\nYou can’t make these repayment contributions later than the date that is 2 years after your active duty period ends.\n\nNo deduction.\n\nYou can’t deduct qualified reservist repayments.\n\nReserve component.\n\nThe term “reserve component” means the:\n\nArmy National Guard of the United States,\n\nArmy Reserve,\n\nNaval Reserve,\n\nMarine Corps Reserve,\n\nAir National Guard of the United States,\n\nAir Force Reserve,\n\nCoast Guard Reserve, or\n\nReserve Corps of the Public Health Service.\n\nFiguring your IRA deduction.\n\nThe repayment of qualified reservist distributions doesn’t affect the amount you can deduct as an IRA contribution.\n\nReporting the repayment.\n\nIf you repay a qualified reservist distribution, include the amount of the repayment with nondeductible contributions on line 1 of Form 8606.\n\nExample.\n\nIn 2023, your IRA contribution limit is $6,500. However, because of your filing status and AGI, the limit on the amount you can deduct is $3,500. You can make a nondeductible contribution of $3,000 ($6,500 – $3,500). In an earlier year, you received a $3,000 qualified reservist distribution, which you would like to repay this year.\n\nFor 2023, you can contribute a total of $9,000 to your IRA. This is made up of the maximum deductible contribution of $3,500; a nondeductible contribution of $3,000; and a $3,000 qualified reservist repayment. You contribute the maximum allowable for the year. Because you are making a nondeductible contribution ($3,000) and a qualified reservist repayment ($3,000), you must file Form 8606 with your return and include $6,000 ($3,000 + $3,000) on line 1 of Form 8606. The qualified reservist repayment isn’t deductible.\n\n. Contributions on your behalf to a traditional IRA reduce your limit for contributions to a Roth IRA. See chapter 2 for information about Roth IRAs..\n\nGeneral Limit\n\nFor 2023, the most that can be contributed to your traditional IRA is generally the smaller of the following amounts.\n\n$6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older).\n\nYour taxable compensation (defined earlier) for the year.\n\nNote.\n\nThis limit is reduced by any contributions to a section 501(c)(18) plan (generally, a pension plan created before June 25, 1959, that is funded entirely by employee contributions).\n\nThis is the most that can be contributed regardless of whether the contributions are to one or more traditional IRAs or whether all or part of the contributions are nondeductible. (See Nondeductible Contributions, later.) Qualified reservist repayments don’t affect this limit.\n\nExamples.\n\nGina, who is 34 years old and single, earns $24,000 in 2023. Her IRA contributions for 2023 are limited to $6,500.\n\nDanny, an unmarried college student working part time, earns $3,500 in 2023. His IRA contributions for 2023 are limited to $3,500, the amount of his compensation.\n\nMore than one IRA.\n\nIf you have more than one IRA, the limit applies to the total contributions made on your behalf to all your traditional IRAs for the year.\n\nAnnuity or endowment contracts.\n\nIf you invest in an annuity or endowment contract under an individual retirement annuity, no more than $6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older) can be contributed toward its cost for the tax year, including the cost of life insurance coverage. If more than this amount is contributed, the annuity or endowment contract is disqualified.\n\nKay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit\n\nFor 2023, if you file a joint return and your taxable compensation is less than that of your spouse, the most that can be contributed for the year to your IRA is the smaller of the following two amounts.\n\n$6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older).\n\nThe total compensation includible in the gross income of both you and your spouse for the year, reduced by the following two amounts.\n\nYour spouse's IRA contribution for the year to a traditional IRA.\n\nAny contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of your spouse.\n\nThis means that the total combined contributions that can be made for the year to your IRA and your spouse's IRA can be as much as $13,000 ($14,000 if only one of you is age 50 or older, or $15,000 if both of you are age 50 or older).\n\nNote.\n\nThis traditional IRA limit is reduced by any contributions to a section 501(c)(18) plan (generally, a pension plan created before June 25, 1959, that is funded entirely by employee contributions).\n\nExample.\n\nYou are a full-time student with no taxable compensation and marry during the year. Neither you nor your spouse is at least age 50 by the end of 2023. Your spouse has taxable compensation of $30,000. Your spouse plans to contribute (and deduct) $6,500 to a traditional IRA. If you and your spouse file a joint return, you and your spouse can each contribute $6,500 to a traditional IRA. Because you have no compensation, you can add your spouse’s compensation, reduced by the amount of your spouse’s IRA contribution ($30,000 - $6,500 = $23,500), to your compensation (-0-) to figure your maximum contribution to a traditional IRA. In your case, $6,500 is your contribution limit, because $6,500 is less than $23,500 (your compensation for purposes of figuring your contribution limit).\n\nFiling Status\n\nGenerally, except as discussed earlier under Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit, your filing status has no effect on the amount of allowable contributions to your traditional IRA. However, if during the year either you or your spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, your deduction may be reduced or eliminated, depending on your filing status and income. See How Much Can You Deduct, later.\n\nExample.\n\nYou and your spouse are both age 53. You both work and you both have a traditional IRA. You earned $3,800 and your spouse earned $48,000 in 2023. Because of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit rule, even though you earned less than $7,500, you can contribute up to $7,500 to your IRA for 2023 if you file a joint return. Your spouse can contribute up to $7,500 to their IRA. If you file separate returns, the amount that can be contributed to your IRA is limited by your earned income, $3,800.\n\nLess Than Maximum Contributions\n\nIf contributions to your traditional IRA for a year were less than the limit, you can’t contribute more after the due date of your return for that year to make up the difference.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are age 40 and earn $30,000 in 2023. Although you can contribute up to $6,500 for 2023, you contribute only $3,000. After April 15, 2024, you can’t make up the difference between your actual contributions for 2023 ($3,000) and your 2023 limit ($6,500). You can’t contribute $3,500 more than the limit for any later year.\n\nMore Than Maximum Contributions\n\nIf contributions to your IRA for a year were more than the limit, you can apply the excess contribution in one year to a later year if the contributions for that later year are less than the maximum allowed for that year. However, a penalty or additional tax may apply. See Excess Contributions, later, under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes.\n\nWhen Can Contributions Be Made?\n\nAs soon as you open your traditional IRA, contributions can be made to it through your chosen sponsor (trustee or other administrator). Contributions must be in the form of money (cash, check, or money order). Property can’t be contributed.\n\nAlthough property can’t be contributed, your IRA may invest in certain property. For example, your IRA may purchase shares of stock. For other restrictions on the use of funds in your IRA, see Prohibited Transactions, later in this chapter. You may be able to transfer or roll over certain property from one retirement plan to another. See the discussion of rollovers and other transfers later in this chapter under Can You Move Retirement Plan Assets.\n\n. You can make a contribution to your IRA by having your income tax refund (or a portion of your refund), if any, paid directly to your traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA. For details, see the instructions for your income tax return or Form 8888, Allocation of Refund..\n\nContributions can be made to your traditional IRA for each year that you receive compensation. For any year in which you don’t work, contributions can’t be made to your IRA unless you receive taxable alimony, nontaxable combat pay, military differential pay, or file a joint return with a spouse who has compensation. See Who Can Open a Traditional IRA, earlier. Even if contributions can’t be made for the current year, the amounts contributed for years in which you did qualify can remain in your IRA. Contributions can resume for any years that you qualify.\n\nContributions must be made by due date.\n\nContributions can be made to your traditional IRA for a year at any time during the year or by the due date for filing your return for that year, not including extensions. For most people, this means that contributions for 2023 must be made by April 15, 2024.\n\n. For tax years beginning after 2019, the rule that you are not able to make contributions to your traditional IRA for the year in which you reach age 70½ and all later years has been repealed..\n\nDesignating year for which contribution is made.\n\nIf an amount is contributed to your traditional IRA between January 1 and April 15, you should tell the sponsor which year (the current year or the previous year) the contribution is for. If you don’t tell the sponsor which year it is for, the sponsor can assume, and report to the IRS, that the contribution is for the current year (the year the sponsor received it).\n\nFiling before a contribution is made.\n\nYou can file your return claiming a traditional IRA contribution before the contribution is actually made. Generally, the contribution must be made by the due date of your return, not including extensions.\n\nContributions not required.\n\nYou don’t have to contribute to your traditional IRA for every tax year, even if you can.\n\nHow Much Can You Deduct?\n\nGenerally, you can deduct the lesser of:\n\nThe contributions to your traditional IRA for the year, or\n\nThe general limit (or the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit, if applicable) explained earlier under How Much Can Be Contributed.\n\nHowever, if you or your spouse were covered by an employer retirement plan, you may not be able to deduct this amount. See Limit if Covered by Employer Plan, later.\n\n. You may be able to claim a credit for contributions to your traditional IRA. For more information, see chapter 3..\n\nTrustees' fees.\n\nTrustees' administrative fees that are billed separately and paid in connection with your traditional IRA aren’t deductible as IRA contributions. You are also not able to deduct these fees as an itemized deduction.\n\nBrokers' commissions.\n\nThese commissions are part of your IRA contribution and, as such, are deductible subject to the limits.\n\nFull deduction.\n\nIf neither you nor your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer retirement plan, you can take a deduction for total contributions to one or more of your traditional IRAs of up to the lesser of:\n\n$6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older), or\n\n100% of your compensation.\n\nThis limit is reduced by any contributions made to a 501(c)(18) plan on your behalf.\n\nKay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA.\n\nIn the case of a married couple with unequal compensation who file a joint return, the deduction for contributions to the traditional IRA of the spouse with less compensation is limited to the lesser of:\n\n$6,500 ($7,500 if the spouse with the lower compensation is age 50 or older), or\n\nThe total compensation includible in the gross income of both spouses for the year reduced by the following three amounts.\n\nThe IRA deduction for the year of the spouse with the greater compensation.\n\nAny designated nondeductible contribution for the year made on behalf of the spouse with the greater compensation.\n\nAny contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of the spouse with the greater compensation.\n\nThis limit is reduced by any contributions to a section 501(c)(18) plan on behalf of the spouse with the lesser compensation.\n\nNote.\n\nIf you were divorced or legally separated (and didn’t remarry) before the end of the year, you can’t deduct any contributions to your spouse's IRA. After a divorce or legal separation, you can deduct only the contributions to your own IRA. Your deductions are subject to the rules for single individuals.\n\nCovered by an employer retirement plan.\n\nIf you or your spouse were covered by an employer retirement plan at any time during the year for which contributions were made, your deduction may be further limited. This is discussed later under Limit if Covered by Employer Plan. Limits on the amount you can deduct don’t affect the amount that can be contributed.\n\nAre You Covered by an Employer Plan?\n\nThe Form W-2 you receive from your employer has a box used to indicate whether you were covered for the year. The “Retirement plan” box should be checked if you were covered.\n\nReservists and volunteer firefighters should also see Situations in Which You Aren’t Covered, later.\n\nIf you aren’t certain whether you were covered by your employer's retirement plan, you should ask your employer.\n\nFederal judges.\n\nFor purposes of the IRA deduction, federal judges are covered by an employer plan.\n\nFor Which Year(s) Are You Covered?\n\nSpecial rules apply to determine the tax years for which you are covered by an employer plan. These rules differ depending on whether the plan is a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan.\n\nTax year.\n\nYour tax year is the annual accounting period you use to keep records and report income and expenses on your income tax return. For almost all people, the tax year is the calendar year.\n\nDefined contribution plan.\n\nGenerally, you are covered by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year that ends with or within that tax year. However, also see Situations in Which You Aren’t Covered, later.\n\nA defined contribution plan is a plan that provides for a separate account for each person covered by the plan. In a defined contribution plan, the amount to be contributed to each participant's account is spelled out in the plan. The level of benefits actually provided to a participant depends on the total amount contributed to that participant's account and any earnings and losses on those contributions. Types of defined contribution plans include profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, and money purchase pension plans.\n\nExample.\n\nCompany A has a money purchase pension plan. Its plan year is from July 1 to June 30. The plan provides that contributions must be allocated as of June 30. An employee leaves Company A on December 31, 2022. The contribution for the plan year ending on June 30, 2023, is made February 15, 2024. Because an amount is contributed to the employee’s account for the plan year, this employee is covered by the plan for their 2023 tax year.\n\nA special rule applies to certain plans in which it isn’t possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to your account for a given plan year. If, for a plan year, no amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable to employer contributions, employee contributions, or forfeitures, by the last day of the plan year, and contributions are discretionary for the plan year, you aren’t covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends. If, after the plan year ends, the employer makes a contribution for that plan year, you are covered for the tax year in which the contribution is made.\n\nExample.\n\nYou were covered by a profit-sharing plan and left the company on December 31, 2022. The plan year runs from July 1 to June 30. Under the terms of the plan, employer contributions don’t have to be made, but if they are made, they are contributed to the plan before the due date for filing the company's tax return. Such contributions are allocated as of the last day of the plan year, and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals who have any service during the plan year. As of June 30, 2023, no contributions were made that were allocated to the June 30, 2023, plan year, and no forfeitures had been allocated within the plan year. In addition, as of that date, the company wasn’t obligated to make a contribution for such plan year, and it was impossible to determine whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan year. On December 31, 2023, the company decided to contribute to the plan for the plan year ending June 30, 2023. That contribution was made on February 15, 2024. You are an active participant in the plan for your 2024 tax year but not for your 2023 tax year.\n\nNo vested interest.\n\nIf an amount is allocated to your account for a plan year, you are covered by that plan even if you have no vested interest in (legal right to) the account.\n\nDefined benefit plan.\n\nIf you are eligible to participate in your employer's defined benefit plan for the plan year that ends within your tax year, you are covered by the plan. This rule applies even if you:\n\nDeclined to participate in the plan,\n\nDidn’t make a required contribution, or\n\nDidn’t perform the minimum service required to accrue a benefit for the year.\n\nA defined benefit plan is any plan that isn’t a defined contribution plan. In a defined benefit plan, the level of benefits to be provided to each participant is spelled out in the plan. The plan administrator figures the amount needed to provide those benefits, and those amounts are contributed to the plan. Defined benefit plans include pension plans and annuity plans.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are an employee of Company B and are eligible to participate in Company B's defined benefit plan, which has a July 1 to June 30 plan year. You leave Company B on December 31, 2022. Because you are eligible to participate in the plan for its year ending June 30, 2023, you are covered by the plan for your 2023 tax year.\n\nNo vested interest.\n\nIf you accrue a benefit for a plan year, you are covered by that plan even if you have no vested interest in (legal right to) the accrual.\n\nSituations in Which You Aren’t Covered\n\nUnless you are covered by another employer plan, you aren’t covered by an employer plan if you are in one of the situations described below.\n\nSocial security or railroad retirement.\n\nCoverage under social security or railroad retirement isn’t coverage under an employer retirement plan.\n\nBenefits from previous employer's plan.\n\nIf you receive retirement benefits from a previous employer's plan, you aren’t covered by that plan.\n\nReservists.\n\nIf the only reason you participate in a plan is because you are a member of a reserve unit of the Armed Forces, you may not be covered by the plan. You aren’t covered by the plan if both of the following conditions are met.\n\nThe plan you participate in is established for its employees by:\n\nThe United States,\n\nA state or political subdivision of a state, or\n\nAn instrumentality of either (a) or (b) above.\n\nYou didn’t serve more than 90 days on active duty during the year (not counting duty for training).\n\nVolunteer firefighters.\n\nIf the only reason you participate in a plan is because you are a volunteer firefighter, you may not be covered by the plan. You aren’t covered by the plan if both of the following conditions are met.\n\nThe plan you participate in is established for its employees by:\n\nThe United States,\n\nA state or political subdivision of a state, or\n\nAn instrumentality of either (a) or (b) above.\n\nYour accrued retirement benefits at the beginning of the year won’t provide more than $1,800 per year at retirement.\n\nLimit if Covered by Employer Plan\n\nAs discussed earlier, the deduction you can take for contributions made to your traditional IRA depends on whether you or your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer retirement plan. Your deduction is also affected by how much income you had and by your filing status. Your deduction may also be affected by social security benefits you received.\n\nReduced or no deduction.\n\nIf either you or your spouse were covered by an employer retirement plan, you may be entitled to only a partial (reduced) deduction or no deduction at all, depending on your income and your filing status.\n\nYour deduction begins to decrease (phase out) when your income rises above a certain amount and is eliminated altogether when it reaches a higher amount. These amounts vary depending on your filing status.\n\nTo determine if your deduction is subject to the phaseout, you must determine your modified AGI and your filing status, as explained later under Deduction Phaseout. Once you have determined your modified AGI and your filing status, you can use Table 1-2 or Table 1-3 to determine if the phaseout applies.\n\nSocial Security Recipients\n\nInstead of using Table 1-2 or Table 1-3 and Worksheet 1-2, complete the worksheets in Appendix B of this publication if, for the year, all of the following apply.\n\nYou received social security benefits.\n\nYou received taxable compensation.\n\nContributions were made to your traditional IRA.\n\nYou or your spouse were covered by an employer retirement plan.\n\nUse the worksheets in Appendix B to figure your IRA deduction, your nondeductible contribution, and the taxable portion, if any, of your social security benefits. Appendix B includes an example with filled-in worksheets to assist you.\n\nTable 1-2. Effect of Modified AGI1 on Deduction if You Are Covered by a Retirement Plan at Work\n\nIf you are covered by a retirement plan at work, use this table to determine if your modified AGI affects the amount of your deduction.\n\nIF your filing status is... AND your modified AGI is... THEN you can take... single or\n\nhead of household $73,000 or less a full deduction. more than $73,000\n\nbut less than $83,000 a partial deduction. $83,000 or more no deduction. married filing jointly or\n\nqualifying surviving spouse $116,000 or less a full deduction. more than $116,000\n\nbut less than $136,000 a partial deduction. $136,000 or more no deduction. married filing separately2 less than $10,000 a partial deduction. $10,000 or more no deduction.\n\n1 Modified AGI (adjusted gross income). See Modified adjusted gross income (AGI), later.\n\n2 If you didn’t live with your spouse at any time during the year, your filing status is considered Single for this purpose (therefore, your IRA deduction is determined under the “Single” filing status).\n\nTable 1-3. Effect of Modified AGI1 on Deduction if You Aren’t Covered by a Retirement Plan at Work\n\nIf you aren’t covered by a retirement plan at work, use this table to determine if your modified AGI affects the amount of your deduction.\n\nIF your filing status is... AND your modified AGI is... THEN you can take... single,\n\nhead of household, or\n\nqualifying surviving spouse any amount a full deduction. married filing jointly or separately with a spouse who isn’t covered by a plan\n\nat work any amount a full deduction. married filing jointly with a spouse who is covered by a plan at work $218,000 or less a full deduction. more than $218,000\n\nbut less than $228,000 a partial deduction. $228,000 or more no deduction. married filing separately with a spouse who is covered by a plan at work2 less than $10,000 a partial deduction. $10,000 or more no deduction.\n\n1 Modified AGI (adjusted gross income). See Modified adjusted gross income (AGI), earlier.\n\n2 You are entitled to the full deduction if you didn’t live with your spouse at any time during the year.\n\nDeduction Phaseout\n\nThe amount of any reduction in the limit on your IRA deduction (phaseout) depends on whether you or your spouse were covered by an employer retirement plan.\n\nCovered by a retirement plan.\n\nIf you are covered by an employer retirement plan and you didn’t receive any social security retirement benefits, your IRA deduction may be reduced or eliminated depending on your filing status and modified AGI, as shown in Table 1-2.\n\nIf your spouse is covered.\n\nIf you aren’t covered by an employer retirement plan, but your spouse is, and you didn’t receive any social security benefits, your IRA deduction may be reduced or eliminated entirely depending on your filing status and modified AGI as shown in Table 1-3.\n\nFiling status.\n\nYour filing status depends primarily on your marital status. For this purpose, you need to know if your filing status is single or head of household, married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse, or married filing separately. If you need more information on filing status, see Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.\n\nLived apart from spouse.\n\nIf you didn’t live with your spouse at any time during the year and you file a separate return, your filing status, for this purpose, is single.\n\nModified adjusted gross income (AGI).\n\nYou can use Worksheet 1-1 to figure your modified AGI. If you made contributions to your IRA for 2023 and received a distribution from your IRA in 2023, see Both contributions for 2023 and distributions in 2023, later.\n\n. Don’t assume that your modified AGI is the same as your compensation. Your modified AGI may include income in addition to your compensation (discussed earlier) such as interest, dividends, and income from IRA distributions. .\n\nForm 1040 or 1040-SR.\n\nIf you file Form 1040 or 1040-SR, refigure the amount on line 11, the “adjusted gross income” line, without taking into account any of the following amounts.\n\nIRA deduction.\n\nStudent loan interest deduction.\n\nForeign earned income exclusion.\n\nForeign housing exclusion or deduction.\n\nExclusion of qualified savings bond interest shown on Form 8815.\n\nExclusion of employer-provided adoption benefits shown on Form 8839.\n\nThis is your modified AGI.\n\nForm 1040-NR.\n\nIf you file Form 1040-NR, refigure the amount on line 11, the “adjusted gross income” line, without taking into account any of the following amounts.\n\nIRA deduction.\n\nStudent loan interest deduction.\n\nExclusion of qualified savings bond interest shown on Form 8815.\n\nExclusion of employer-provided adoption benefits shown on Form 8839.\n\nThis is your modified AGI.\n\nIncome from IRA distributions.\n\nIf you received distributions in 2023 from one or more traditional IRAs and your traditional IRAs include only deductible contributions, your distributions are fully taxable and are included in your modified AGI. See Pub. 590-B for more information on distributions.\n\nBoth contributions for 2023 and distributions in 2023.\n\nIf all three of the following apply, any IRA distributions you received in 2023 may be partly tax free and partly taxable.\n\nYou received distributions in 2023 from one or more traditional IRAs.\n\nYou made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2023.\n\nSome of those contributions may be nondeductible contributions. (See Nondeductible Contributions and Worksheet 1-2, later.)\n\nIf this is your situation, you must figure the taxable part of the traditional IRA distribution before you can figure your modified AGI. To do this, you can use Worksheet 1-1 in Pub. 590-B.\n\nIf at least one of the above doesn’t apply, figure your modified AGI using Worksheet 1-1.\n\nHow To Figure Your Reduced IRA Deduction\n\nIf you or your spouse are covered by an employer retirement plan and you didn’t receive any social security benefits, you can figure your reduced IRA deduction by using Worksheet 1-2. The Instructions for Form 1040 include a similar worksheet that you can use instead of the worksheet in this publication.\n\nIf you or your spouse are covered by an employer retirement plan, and you received any social security benefits, see Social Security Recipients, earlier.\n\nNote.\n\nIf you were married and both you and your spouse contributed to an IRA, figure your deduction and your spouse's deduction separately.\n\nWorksheet 1-1. Figuring Your Modified AGI\n\nUse this worksheet to figure your modified AGI for traditional IRA purposes.\n\n1. Enter your adjusted gross income (AGI) from Form 1040, 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR, line 11, figured without taking into account the amount from Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 20 1. _____ 2. Enter any student loan interest deduction from Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 21 2. _____ 3. Enter any foreign earned income exclusion and/or housing exclusion from Form 2555, line 45 3. _____ 4. Enter any foreign housing deduction from Form 2555, line 50 4. _____ 5. Enter any excludable savings bond interest from Form 8815, line 14 5. _____ 6. Enter any excluded employer-provided adoption benefits from Form 8839, line 28 6. _____ 7. Add lines 1 through 6. This is your modified AGI for traditional IRA purposes 7. _____\n\nReporting Deductible Contributions\n\nIf you file Schedule 1 (Form 1040), enter your IRA deduction on line 20 of that form.\n\nSelf-employed.\n\nIf you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or partner) and have a SIMPLE IRA, enter your deduction for allowable plan contributions on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 16.\n\nNondeductible Contributions\n\nAlthough your deduction for IRA contributions may be reduced or eliminated, contributions can be made to your IRA of up to the general limit or, if it applies, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit. The difference between your total permitted contributions and your IRA deduction, if any, is your nondeductible contribution.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are 29 years old and single. In 2023, you were covered by a retirement plan at work. Your salary is $72,000. Your modified AGI is $90,000. You make a $6,500 IRA contribution for 2023. Because you were covered by a retirement plan and your modified AGI is above $83,000, you can’t deduct your $6,500 IRA contribution. You must designate this contribution as a nondeductible contribution by reporting it on Form 8606.\n\nRepayment of reservist distributions.\n\nNondeductible contributions may include repayments of qualified reservist distributions. For more information, see Qualified reservist repayments under How Much Can Be Contributed, earlier.\n\nDifficulty of care payments.\n\nFor contributions after December 20, 2019, you are able to elect to increase the nondeductible IRA contribution limit by some or all of the amount of difficulty of care payments, which are a type of qualified foster care payment, received. If you receive difficulty of care payments, then those amounts may increase the amount of nondeductible IRA contributions you can make but not above the $6,500 IRA deductible amount ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older). The increase to the nondeductible IRA contribution limit equals the lesser of (i) the amount of difficulty of care payments excluded from gross income, or (ii) the amount by which the deductible limit for IRA contributions exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's compensation included in gross income for the tax year.\n\nForm 8606.\n\nTo designate contributions as nondeductible, you must file Form 8606.\n\nYou don’t have to designate a contribution as nondeductible until you file your tax return. When you file, you can even designate otherwise deductible contributions as nondeductible contributions.\n\nYou must file Form 8606 to report nondeductible contributions even if you don’t have to file a tax return for the year.\n\n. A Form 8606 isn’t used for the year that you make a rollover from a qualified retirement plan to a traditional IRA and the rollover includes nontaxable amounts. In those situations, a Form 8606 is completed for the year you take a distribution from that IRA. See Form 8606 under Distributions Fully or Partly Taxable in Pub. 590-B..\n\nFailure to report nondeductible contributions.\n\nIf you don’t report nondeductible contributions, all of the contributions to your traditional IRA will be treated like deductible contributions when withdrawn. All distributions from your IRA will be taxed unless you can show, with satisfactory evidence, that nondeductible contributions were made.\n\nPenalty for overstatement.\n\nIf you overstate the amount of nondeductible contributions on your Form 8606 for any tax year, you must pay a penalty of $100 for each overstatement, unless it was due to reasonable cause.\n\nPenalty for failure to file Form 8606.\n\nYou will have to pay a $50 penalty if you don’t file a required Form 8606, unless you can prove that the failure was due to reasonable cause.\n\nTax on earnings on nondeductible contributions.\n\nAs long as contributions are within the contribution limits, none of the earnings or gains on contributions (deductible or nondeductible) will be taxed until they are distributed.\n\nCost basis.\n\nYou will have a cost basis in your traditional IRA if you made any nondeductible contributions. Your cost basis is the sum of the nondeductible contributions to your IRA minus any withdrawals or distributions of nondeductible contributions.\n\n. Commonly, distributions from your traditional IRAs will include both taxable and nontaxable (cost basis) amounts. See Pub. 590-B for more information on distributions..\n\n. Recordkeeping. There is a recordkeeping worksheet, Appendix A. Summary Record of Traditional IRA(s) for 2023, that you can use to keep a record of deductible and nondeductible IRA contributions. .\n\nExamples—Worksheet for Reduced IRA Deduction for 2023\n\nThe following examples illustrate the use of Worksheet 1-2.\n\nExample 1.\n\nFor 2023, you and your spouse file a joint return on Form 1040. You are both 39 years old. You are both employed. You are covered by your employer’s retirement plan. However, your spouse isn’t covered by their employer’s retirement plan. Your salary is $66,000, and your spouse’s salary is $41,500. You each have a traditional IRA and your combined modified AGI, which includes $9,000 interest and dividend income, is $116,500. Because your modified AGI is between $116,000 and $136,000 and you are covered by an employer plan, you are subject to the deduction phaseout discussed earlier under Limit if Covered by Employer Plan.\n\nFor 2023, you and your spouse, each, contributed $6,500 to your respective IRAs. Even though you file a joint return, you must figure their IRA deductions separately.\n\nYou can take a deduction of only $6,440. Using Worksheet 1-2, Figuring Your Reduced IRA Deduction for 2023, you figure your deductible and nondeductible amounts as shown on Worksheet 1-2. Figuring Your Reduced IRA Deduction for 2023—Example 1 Illustrated.\n\nYou can choose to treat the $6,440 as either deductible or nondeductible contributions. You can either leave the $60 ($6,500 − $6,440) of nondeductible contributions in your IRA or withdraw them by April 15, 2024. You decide to treat the $6,440 as a deductible contribution and leave the $60 of nondeductible contributions in your IRA.\n\nYour spouse can treat all or part of their $6,500 contribution as either deductible or nondeductible. This is because they aren’t covered by their employer's retirement plan, and your combined modified AGI isn’t between $218,000 and $228,000. Therefore, they aren’t subject to the deduction phaseout discussed earlier under Limit if Covered by Employer Plan, and they don’t need to use Worksheet 1-2. Your spouse decides to treat their $6,500 IRA contribution as deductible.\n\nThe IRA deductions of $6,440 and $6,500 on the joint return for you and your spouse total $12,940.\n\nExample 2.\n\nFor 2023, you and your spouse file a joint return on Form 1040. You are both 39 years old. Your salary is $45,000 and you are covered by your employer's retirement plan. Your spouse had no compensation for the year and was not covered by an employer plan. You contribute $6,500 to your traditional IRA and $6,500 to your spouse's traditional IRA (a Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA). Your combined modified AGI which includes $2,000 interest and dividend income and a large capital gain from the sale of stock is $220,500.\n\nBecause your combined modified AGI is $136,000 or more and you are covered by your employer's plan, you can’t deduct any of the contribution to your traditional IRA. You can either leave the $6,500 of nondeductible contributions in your IRA or withdraw them by April 15, 2024.\n\nYour spouse figures their IRA deduction as shown on Worksheet 1-2.

A beneficiary can be any person or entity the owner chooses to receive the benefits of the IRA after the owner dies. Beneficiaries of a traditional IRA must include in their gross income any taxable distributions they receive.\n\nInherited From Spouse\n\nIf you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you generally have the following three choices.\n\nTreat it as your own IRA by designating yourself as the account owner.\n\nTreat it as your own by rolling it over into your IRA, or to the extent it is taxable, into a:\n\nQualified employer plan,\n\nQualified employee annuity plan (section 403(a) plan),\n\nTax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), or\n\nDeferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 457 plan).\n\nTreat yourself as the beneficiary rather than treating the IRA as your own.\n\nTreating it as your own.\n\nYou will be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:\n\nContributions (including rollover contributions) are made to the inherited IRA, or\n\nYou don’t take the required minimum distribution for a year as a beneficiary of the IRA.\n\nYou will only be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:\n\nYou are the sole beneficiary of the IRA, and\n\nYou have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from it.\n\nHowever, if you receive a distribution from your deceased spouse's IRA, you can roll that distribution over into your own IRA within the 60-day time limit, as long as the distribution isn’t a required distribution, even if you aren’t the sole beneficiary of your deceased spouse's IRA. For more information, see When Must You Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) in Pub. 590-B for more information on required minimum distributions.\n\nInherited From Someone Other Than Spouse\n\nIf you inherit a traditional IRA from anyone other than your deceased spouse, you can’t treat the inherited IRA as your own. This means that you can’t make any contributions to the IRA. It also means you can’t roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited IRA. However, you can make a trustee-to-trustee transfer as long as the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set up and maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as beneficiary. See Pub. 590-B for more information.\n\nLike the original owner, you generally won’t owe tax on the assets in the IRA until you receive distributions from it. You must begin receiving distributions from the IRA under the rules for distributions that apply to beneficiaries.\n\nMore information.\n\nFor more information about rollovers, required distributions, and inherited IRAs, see:\n\nRollovers, later, under Can You Move Retirement Plan Assets;\n\nWhen Must You Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) in Pub. 590-B; and\n\nIRA Beneficiaries under When Must You Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) in Pub. 590-B.\n\nCan You Move Retirement Plan Assets?\n\nYou can transfer, tax free, assets (money or property) from other retirement programs (including traditional IRAs) to a traditional IRA. You can make the following kinds of transfers.\n\nTransfers from one trustee to another.\n\nRollovers.\n\nTransfers incident to a divorce.\n\nThis chapter discusses all three kinds of transfers.\n\nTransfers to Roth IRAs.\n\nUnder certain conditions, you can move assets from a traditional IRA or from a designated Roth account to a Roth IRA. For more information about these transfers, see Converting From Any Traditional IRA Into a Roth IRA, later in this chapter, and Can You Move Amounts Into a Roth IRA? in chapter 2.\n\nTransfers to Roth IRAs from other retirement plans.\n\nUnder certain conditions, you can move assets from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA. For more information, see Can You Move Amounts Into a Roth IRA? in chapter 2.\n\nTrustee-to-Trustee Transfer\n\nA transfer of funds in your traditional IRA from one trustee directly to another, either at your request or at the trustee's request, isn’t a rollover. This includes the situation where the current trustee issues a check to the new trustee but gives it to you to deposit. Because there is no distribution to you, the transfer is tax free. Because it isn’t a rollover, it isn’t affected by the 1-year waiting period required between rollovers. This waiting period is discussed later under Rollover From One IRA Into Another.\n\nFor information about direct transfers from retirement programs other than traditional IRAs, see Direct rollover option, later.\n\nRollovers\n\nGenerally, a rollover is a tax-free distribution to you of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that you contribute to another retirement plan within 60 days you received the payment or distribution. The contribution to the second retirement plan is called a rollover contribution.\n\nNote.\n\nAn amount rolled over tax free from one retirement plan to another is generally includible in income when it is distributed from the second plan.\n\nKinds of rollovers to a traditional IRA.\n\nYou can roll over amounts from the following plans into a traditional IRA.\n\nA traditional IRA.\n\nAn employer's qualified retirement plan for its employees.\n\nA deferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 457 plan).\n\nA tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan).\n\nAlso, see Table 1-4.\n\nTable 1-4.

For more information regarding retirement plans and rollovers, go to Tax Information for Retirement Plans.\n\nTreatment of rollovers.\n\nYou can’t deduct a rollover contribution, but you must report the rollover distribution on your tax return as discussed later under Reporting rollovers from IRAs and Reporting rollovers from employer plans.\n\nRollover notice.\n\nA written explanation of rollover treatment must be given to you by the plan (other than an IRA) making the distribution. See Written explanation to recipients, later, for more details.\n\nKinds of rollovers from a traditional IRA.\n\nYou may be able to roll over, tax free, a distribution from your traditional IRA into a qualified plan. These plans include the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (for federal employees), deferred compensation plans of state or local governments (section 457 plans), and tax-sheltered annuity plans (section 403(b) plans). The part of the distribution that you can roll over is the part that would otherwise be taxable (includible in your income). Qualified plans may, but aren’t required to, accept such rollovers.\n\nTax treatment of a rollover from a traditional IRA to an eligible retirement plan other than an IRA.\n\nOrdinarily, when you have basis in your IRAs, any distribution is considered to include both nontaxable and taxable amounts. Without a special rule, the nontaxable portion of such a distribution couldn’t be rolled over. However, a special rule treats a distribution you roll over into an eligible retirement plan as including only otherwise taxable amounts if the amount you either leave in your IRAs or don’t roll over is at least equal to your basis. The effect of this special rule is to make the amount in your traditional IRAs that you can roll over to an eligible retirement plan as large as possible.\n\nEligible retirement plans.\n\nThe following are considered eligible retirement plans.\n\nIRAs.\n\nQualified trusts.\n\nQualified employee annuity plans under section 403(a).\n\nDeferred compensation plans of state and local governments (section 457 plans).\n\nTax-sheltered annuities (section 403(b) annuities).\n\nTime Limit for Making a Rollover Contribution\n\nYou must generally make the rollover contribution by the 60th day after the day you receive the distribution from your traditional IRA or your employer's plan.\n\nExample.\n\nYou received an eligible rollover distribution from your traditional IRA on June 30, 2023, that you intend to roll over to your 403(b) plan. To postpone including the distribution in your income, you must complete the rollover by August 29, 2023, the 60th day following June 30.\n\nThe IRS may waive the 60-day requirement where the failure to do so would be against equity or good conscience, such as in the event of a casualty, disaster, or other event beyond your reasonable control. For exceptions to the 60-day period, see Ways to get a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement, later.\n\nPlan loan offset.\n\nA plan loan offset is the amount your employer plan account balance is reduced, or offset, to repay a loan from the plan. How long you have to complete the rollover of a plan loan offset depends on what kind of plan loan offset you have. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if you have a qualified plan loan offset, you will have until the due date (including extensions) for your tax return for the tax year in which the offset occurs to complete your rollover. A qualified plan loan offset occurs when a plan loan in good standing is offset because your employer plan terminates, or because you sever from employment. If your plan loan offset occurs for any other reason, then you have 60 days from the date the offset occurs to complete your rollover.\n\nRollovers completed after the 60-day period.\n\nIn the absence of a waiver, amounts not rolled over within the 60-day period don’t qualify for tax-free rollover treatment. You must treat them as a taxable distribution from either your IRA or your employer's plan. These amounts are taxable in the year distributed, even if the 60-day period expires in the next year. You may also have to pay a 10% additional tax on early distributions as discussed under Early Distributions in Pub. 590-B.\n\nUnless there is a waiver or an extension of the 60-day rollover period, any contribution you make to your IRA more than 60 days after the distribution is a regular contribution, not a rollover contribution.\n\nExample.\n\nYou received a distribution in late December 2023 from a traditional IRA that you don’t roll over into another traditional IRA within the 60-day limit. You don’t qualify for a waiver. This distribution is taxable in 2023 even though the 60-day limit wasn’t up until 2024.\n\nWays to get a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement.\n\nThere are three ways to obtain a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement.\n\nYou qualify for an automatic waiver.\n\nYou self-certify that you met the requirements of a waiver.\n\nYou request and receive a private letter ruling granting a waiver.\n\nHow do you qualify for an automatic waiver?\n\nYou qualify for an automatic waiver if all of the following apply.\n\nThe financial institution receives the funds on your behalf before the end of the 60-day rollover period.\n\nYou followed all of the procedures set by the financial institution for depositing the funds into an IRA or other eligible retirement plan within the 60-day rollover period (including giving instructions to deposit the funds into a plan or IRA).\n\nThe funds aren’t deposited into a plan or IRA within the 60-day rollover period solely because of an error on the part of the financial institution.\n\nThe funds are deposited into a plan or IRA within 1 year from the beginning of the 60-day rollover period.\n\nIt would have been a valid rollover if the financial institution had deposited the funds as instructed.\n\nIf you don’t qualify for an automatic waiver, you can use the self-certification procedure to make a late rollover contribution or you can apply to the IRS for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement.\n\nHow do you self-certify that you qualify for a waiver?\n\nPursuant to Revenue Procedure 2020-46 in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2020-45, available at IRB 2020-45, you may make a written certification to a plan administrator or an IRA trustee that you missed the 60-day rollover contribution deadline because of one or more of the reasons listed in Revenue Procedure 2020-46. A plan administrator or an IRA trustee may rely on the certification in accepting and reporting receipt of the rollover contribution. You may make the certification by using the model letter in the appendix to the revenue procedure or by using a letter that is substantially similar. There is no IRS fee for self-certification. A copy of the certification should be kept in your files and be available if requested on audit.\n\nNote.\n\nA self-certification is not a waiver by the IRS of the 60-day rollover requirement. If the IRS subsequently audits your income tax return, it may determine that you do not qualify for a waiver, in which case you may owe additional taxes and penalties.\n\nHow do you apply for a waiver and what is the fee?\n\nYou can request a ruling according to the procedures outlined in Revenue Procedure 2003-16 and Revenue Procedure 2024-4. The appropriate user fee of $12,500 must accompany every request for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement (see the user fee chart in Appendix A of Revenue Procedure 2024-4).\n\nHow does the IRS determine whether to grant a waiver in a private letter ruling?\n\nIn determining whether to issue a favorable letter ruling granting a waiver, the IRS will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including:\n\nWhether errors were made by the financial institution, that is, the plan administrator, or IRA trustee, issuer, or custodian;\n\nWhether you were unable to complete the rollover within the 60-day period due to death, disability, hospitalization, incarceration, serious illness, restrictions imposed by a foreign country, or postal error;\n\nWhether you used the amount distributed; and\n\nHow much time has passed since the date of the distribution.\n\nNote.\n\nThe IRS can waive only the 60-day rollover requirement and not the other requirements for a valid rollover contribution. For example, the IRS can’t waive the IRA one-rollover-per-year rule.\n\nFor more information on waivers of the 60-day rollover requirement, go to RetirementPlans-FAQs.\n\nAmount.\n\nThe rules regarding the amount that can be rolled over within the 60-day time period also apply to the amount that can be deposited due to a waiver. For example, if you received $6,000 from your IRA, the most that you can deposit into an eligible retirement plan due to a waiver is $6,000.\n\nExtension of rollover period.\n\nIf an amount distributed to you from a traditional IRA or a qualified employer retirement plan is a frozen deposit at any time during the 60-day period allowed for a rollover, two special rules extend the rollover period.\n\nThe period during which the amount is a frozen deposit isn’t counted in the 60-day period.\n\nThe 60-day period can’t end earlier than 10 days after the deposit is no longer frozen.\n\nFrozen deposit.\n\nThis is any deposit that can’t be withdrawn from a financial institution because of either of the following reasons.\n\nThe financial institution is bankrupt or insolvent.\n\nThe state where the institution is located restricts withdrawals because one or more financial institutions in the state are (or are about to be) bankrupt or insolvent.\n\nRollover From One IRA Into Another\n\nYou can withdraw, tax free, all or part of the assets from one traditional IRA if you reinvest them within 60 days in the same or another traditional IRA. Because this is a rollover, you can’t deduct the amount that you reinvest in an IRA.\n\n. You may be able to treat a contribution made to one type of IRA as having been made to a different type of IRA. This is called recharacterizing the contribution. See Recharacterizations in this chapter for more information. .\n\nWaiting period between rollovers.\n\nGenerally, if you make a tax-free rollover of any part of a distribution from a traditional IRA, you can’t, within a 1-year period, make a tax-free rollover of any later distribution from that same IRA. You also can’t make a tax-free rollover of any amount distributed, within the same 1-year period, from the IRA into which you made the tax-free rollover.\n\nThe 1-year period begins on the date you receive the IRA distribution, not on the date you roll it over into an IRA. Rules apply to the number of rollovers you can have with your traditional IRAs. See Application of one-rollover-per-year limitation, later.\n\nExample.\n\nYou have two traditional IRAs, IRA-1 and IRA-2. In 2023, you made a tax-free rollover of a distribution from IRA-1 into a new traditional IRA (IRA-3). You can’t, within 1 year of the distribution from IRA-1, make a tax-free rollover of any distribution from either IRA-1 or IRA-3 into another traditional IRA.\n\nFor 2023, the rollover from IRA-1 into IRA-3 prevents you from making a tax-free rollover from IRA-2 into any other traditional IRA. This is because in 2023 you are only allowed to make one rollover within a 1-year period. So when you make a rollover from IRA-1 to IRA-3, you can’t make a rollover from IRA-2 to any other traditional IRA.\n\nException.\n\nAn IRA distribution made from a failed financial institution by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver is not treated as a rollover for purposes of the one-rollover-per-year limitation, provided:\n\nNeither the failed financial institution nor the depositor initiated the distribution, and\n\nNo financial institution has assumed the IRAs of the failed financial institution.\n\nApplication of one-rollover-per-year limitation.\n\nYou can make only one rollover from an IRA to another (or the same) IRA in any 1-year period regardless of the number of IRAs you own. The limit will apply by aggregating all of an individual's IRAs, including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs as well as traditional and Roth IRAs, effectively treating them as one IRA for purposes of the limit. However, trustee-to-trustee transfers between IRAs aren’t limited and rollovers from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs (conversions) aren’t limited.\n\nExample.\n\nYou have three traditional IRAs: IRA-1, IRA-2, and IRA-3. You didn’t take any distributions from your IRAs in 2023. On January 1, 2024, you took a distribution from IRA-1 and rolled it over into IRA-2 on the same day. For 2024, you can’t roll over any other 2024 IRA distribution, including a rollover distribution involving IRA-3. This wouldn’t apply to a conversion.\n\nThe same property must be rolled over.\n\nIf property is distributed to you from an IRA and you complete the rollover by contributing property to an IRA, your rollover is tax free only if the property you contribute is the same property that was distributed to you.\n\nPartial rollovers.\n\nIf you withdraw assets from a traditional IRA, you can roll over part of the withdrawal tax free and keep the rest of it. The amount you keep will generally be taxable (except for the part that is a return of nondeductible contributions). The amount you keep may be subject to the 10% additional tax on early distributions discussed later under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes.\n\nRequired distributions.\n\nAmounts that must be distributed during a particular year under the required distribution rules (discussed in Pub. 590-B) aren’t eligible for rollover treatment.\n\nInherited IRAs.\n\nIf you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you can generally roll it over, or you can choose to make the inherited IRA your own as discussed earlier under What if You Inherit an IRA.\n\nReporting rollovers from IRAs.\n\nReport any rollover from one traditional IRA to the same or another traditional IRA on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, lines 4a and 4b.\n\nEnter the total amount of the distribution on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 4a. If the total amount on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 4a, was rolled over, enter zero on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 4b. If the total distribution wasn't rolled over, enter the taxable portion of the part that wasn't rolled over on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 4b. Enter \"Rollover\" next to line 4b. See your tax return instructions.\n\nIf you rolled over the distribution into a qualified plan (other than an IRA) or you make the rollover in 2024, attach a statement explaining what you did.\n\nFor information on how to figure the taxable portion, see Are Distributions Taxable? in Pub. 590-B.\n\nRollover From Employer's Plan Into an IRA\n\nYou can roll over into a traditional IRA all or part of an eligible rollover distribution you receive from your (or your deceased spouse's):\n\nEmployer's qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan;\n\nAnnuity plan;\n\nTax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan); or\n\nGovernmental deferred compensation plan (section 457 plan).\n\nA qualified plan is one that meets the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nEligible rollover distribution.\n\nGenerally, an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or part of the balance to your credit in a qualified retirement plan except the following.\n\nA required minimum distribution (explained under When Must You Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) in Pub. 590-B).\n\nA hardship distribution.\n\nAny of a series of substantially equal periodic distributions paid at least once a year over:\n\nYour lifetime or life expectancy,\n\nThe lifetimes or life expectancies of you and your beneficiary, or\n\nA period of 10 years or more.\n\nCorrective distributions of excess contributions or excess deferrals, and any income allocable to the excess, or of excess annual additions and any allocable gains.\n\nA loan treated as a distribution because it doesn’t satisfy certain requirements either when made or later (such as upon default), unless the participant's accrued benefits are reduced (offset) to repay the loan. See the discussion earlier of plan loan offsets (including qualified plan loan offsets) under Time Limit for Making a Rollover Contribution.\n\nDividends on employer securities.\n\nThe cost of life insurance coverage.\n\nYour rollover into a traditional IRA may include both amounts that would be taxable and amounts that wouldn’t be taxable if they were distributed to you, but not rolled over. To the extent the distribution is rolled over into a traditional IRA, it isn’t includible in your income.\n\n. Any nontaxable amounts that you roll over into your traditional IRA become part of your basis (cost) in your IRAs. To recover your basis when you take distributions from your IRA, you must complete Form 8606 for the year of the distribution. See Form 8606 under Distributions Fully or Partly Taxable in Pub. 590-B..\n\nRollover by nonspouse beneficiary.\n\nIf you are a designated beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) of a deceased employee, you can roll over all or part of an eligible rollover distribution from one of the types of plans listed above into a traditional IRA. You must make the rollover by a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer into an inherited IRA.\n\nYou will determine your required minimum distributions in years after you make the rollover based on whether the employee died before his or her required beginning date for taking distributions from the plan. For more information, see Distributions after the employee's death under Tax on Excess Accumulation in Pub. 575.\n\nWritten explanation to recipients.\n\nBefore making an eligible rollover distribution, the administrator of a qualified retirement plan must provide you with a written explanation. It must tell you about all of the following.\n\nYour right to have the distribution paid tax free directly to a traditional IRA or another eligible retirement plan.\n\nThe requirement to withhold tax from the distribution if it isn’t paid directly to a traditional IRA or another eligible retirement plan.\n\nThe tax treatment of any part of the distribution that you roll over to a traditional IRA or another eligible retirement plan within 60 days after you receive the distribution.\n\nOther qualified retirement plan rules, if they apply, including those for lump-sum distributions, alternate payees, and cash or deferred arrangements.\n\nHow the plan receiving the distribution differs from the plan making the distribution in its restrictions and tax consequences.\n\nThe plan administrator must provide you with this written explanation no earlier than 90 days and no later than 30 days before the distribution is made.\n\nHowever, you can choose to have a distribution made less than 30 days after the explanation is provided as long as both of the following requirements are met.\n\nYou are given at least 30 days after the notice is provided to consider whether you want to elect a direct rollover.\n\nYou are given information that clearly states that you have this 30-day period to make the decision.\n\nContact the plan administrator if you have any questions regarding this information.\n\nWithholding requirement.\n\nGenerally, if an eligible rollover distribution is paid directly to you, the payer must withhold 20% of it"
