        "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Hundreds of North Jackson residents say it’s time to ditch One Lake in favor of a flood control plan that solely focuses on protecting homes and businesses along the Pearl River.\n\nMore than 550 people signed a petition urging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to “focus on flood control,” rather than a lake project, which they believe is more about economic development.\n\nThe petition was drawn up by 3 Communities, 1 Common Agenda, and was submitted to the Corps in response to its Draft Environmental Impact Statement, studying several flood control options for the Pearl River Drainage Basin.\n\nThe public comment period on the DEIS ended on August 6.\n\nJuan Fernandez, a Belhaven resident who helped organize the petition, hopes signatures will urge the Corps to come up with a new plan that protects not only properties in North Jackson, but also in West Jackson, Byram, and Richland.\n\n“I don’t remember the words in the petition exactly, but that’s the message: to formulate a new plan,” he said. “I think we definitely have to take care of these high-risk neighborhoods.”\n\nThe petition comes more than two months after the Corps released its DEIS for public review.\n\nThe more than 300-page document includes findings on several flood control alternatives for the Pearl, including the One Lake Plan, and a scaled-back version of that plan now backed by the Corps and the Rankin-Hinds Flood and Drainage Control District.\n\nFernandez says he doesn’t support either lake plan, saying they’re too expensive and are designed more to promote economic development than reduce flooding.\n\n“The lake will not reduce flooding. That’s why there’s an Alternative E, which doesn’t even build a lake and it does everything One Lake does,” he said.\n\nThe DEIS looks at multiple flood control options, including One Lake, which creates a 1,700-acre lake along the river between Hinds and Rankin counties.\n\nAccording to Corps figures, it would protect 709 structures in the event of a 100-year flood. However, it could cause 83 other structures to flood and increase flooding along some Pearl River tributaries.\n\nThe other lake plan is known as “Alternative D” or the “Combination Thereof Plan,” which creates a smaller lake on the river and protects 548 structures in the 100-year floodplain.\n\nAlternative E, which is the CTO plan without the lake, would also protect 548 structures.\n\n[READ: Here’s the proposals the Corps looked at to address flooding along the Pearl River]\n\nThe alternatives were drawn up after the Corps determined that One Lake would be too costly to construct, with estimates showing it would cost between $1.1 and $2.3 billion.\n\nFernandez says if the Corps settles on either of the lake plans, its implementation would be delayed by lawsuits and the need to seek additional Congressional authorizations, largely due to the lake alternatives’ costs.\n\n“That’s not just speculation on my part or the environmental groups. Col. Klein said that in his memo about the DEIS,” he said. “This is going to have to go back to Congress in some form.”\n\nKlein is Col. Christopher Klein, the former commander of the Corps’ Vicksburg District.\n\nHe published a 17-page memo summarizing the DEIS on June 11.\n\n“To implement multiple flood management measures and a more comprehensive solution, additional authority is required - either an increase in the total authorized project cost under Section 3104 or a programmatic authority to implement small-scale flood risk measures in the Pearl River Basin similar to CAP Section 205 projects,” he wrote.\n\nSection 3104 of the 2007 Water Resources Development Act authorized the Corps to spend up to $205 million on a flood control project along the Pearl. That amount was increased to just under $409 million in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, federal law dictates that 35 percent of the project’s cost be covered by the local sponsor. It’s unclear how that local share will be covered, and officials with the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District have refused multiple requests to respond to our question on that.\n\nKlein also wrote that if the CTO was chosen, “additional analysis and design, feasibility-level decision documents, and NEPA documentation” also would be needed.\n\nNEPA is the National Environmental Policy Act. According to the EPA’s website, the statute mandates that federal agencies “assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.”\n\n[READ: Residents sound off on Corps’ flood control study]\n\nThe petition is urging the Corps to stay within the cost limits imposed by WRDA. The group also is asking the Corps to “respect the land and livelihoods of downstream communities,” and to include the general public in drawing up a new plan.\n\n“I see a number of hurdles... not just delays for the work, but review, public input,” Fernandez said. “So, [that’s] even before we get to the courts.”\n\nWe have reached out to the Corps and are awaiting comment.
