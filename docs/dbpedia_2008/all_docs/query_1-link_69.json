        "text": "The University of Oklahoma is committed to making a world-class education attainable.\n\nOU offers a variety of scholarships for admitted incoming freshmen. You must apply by December 15 to receive consideration. No additional application is required for OU’s merit-based awards. This list represents some of the general, university-centralized freshman scholarships for fall 2024, but is not all-inclusive. Applicants are encouraged to retake the ACT and/or SAT through April 30 and send their seventh semester transcript for scholarship update consideration. A student will be offered the highest tuition waiver based on their qualifications. Students cannot receive more than one merit-based award.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma uses scores from national or residual tests taken before April 30. Effective for students applying for the fall 2024 through fall 2025 semesters, OU will practice a test-optional admissions process when awarding scholarships. All applicants are automatically considered for scholarships when they apply by December 15, including students who apply as test-optional. We highly encourage students to submit their test scores to ensure the highest scholarships and the fastest notification of an award. For consideration for our highly selective academic, nomination-based awards, we encourage students to submit a test score. If extenuating circumstances with regard to access to testing exist, we will evaluate on a case by case basis.\n\nOU will also superscore ACT/SAT scores and allow students to self report scores for admission and scholarship purposes. These scores must be verified at the time of enrollment.\n\nOU's Office of Admissions and Recruitment also uses a standardized weighted GPA for scholarship awarding purposes. This is referred to as the student’s scholarship GPA. Scholarship GPA provides extra weight to AP, IB, A Level, Pre-AP, AS Level, honors, and concurrent or dual credit courses in a uniform manner across all applications. This standardized weighting process allows the admissions committee to account for the wide variety of weighting scales used at high schools, and for applicants from high schools that do not provide a weighted GPA, in an equitable manner during the scholarship awarding process.\n\nInstitutional scholarships, combined with other federal, state and/or institutional aid, should not exceed the published Cost of Attendance.\n\nThis list represents some of the general, university-centralized freshman scholarships for fall 2024, but is not all-inclusive. Admitted students will be offered the highest scholarship listed in the chart below based on their qualifications. Students cannot receive more than one of these merit-based awards. Students may also qualify for additional need-based financial resources and are encouraged to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n\nAs a test-optional school for fall 2024 through fall 2025, OU will consider applicants holistically for scholarships, but it is highly encouraged to submit a test score to ensure the highest scholarship and the fastest notification of an award. To receive the Oklahoma State Regents’ Academic Scholars Program Award or Institutional Nominee scholarship from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, a student must have a test score on file.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma offers a variety of scholarships to admitted transfer students based on criteria such as academics, leadership, community involvement, and extracurricular activities. There are two main categories of scholarships for transfer students: academic and competitive scholarships. Please note that for the purposes of these scholarships, you are only considered a transfer student if you have completed 24 college credit hours post high school graduation and haven't previously attended OU as a degree-seeking student.\n\nA student will be offered the highest tuition waiver based on their qualifications. Students cannot receive more than one merit-based award.\n\nThe list below represents centralized scholarship programs for the Norman campus and for the OU Polytechnic Institute in Tulsa. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive. You must apply for admission by March 1 for Fall and Summer entry terms or October 1 for Spring entry terms to be considered for transfer scholarships (Norman campus). Apply for admission and scholarships at apply.ou.edu. Students may also qualify for additional need-based financial resources and are encouraged to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)."
