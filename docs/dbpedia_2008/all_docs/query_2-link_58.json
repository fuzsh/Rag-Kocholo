        "text": "This story was created in paid partnership with Toronto Film School.\n\nAnn-Sophie Poulin had just graduated from law school. Akhil Khithani was studying for his Medical College Admission Test to get into med school. And Bruno S. Lyra was a partner at a law firm. They were educated, skilled and prepared for a life in medicine or the law, but each of them found themselves daydreaming about a surprisingly different career — one they had not considered before: a career in the film industry.\n\nThis is the story of three people who dared to switch careers. If you are looking for a more creative and fulfilling path, then their stories may inspire you.\n\n“I have been drawn to the arts my whole life,” Khithani says. “I always felt most alive when I was collaborating with others and expressing creativity.”\n\nYet, Khithani was worried. Doubts lingered about leaving a possible stable medical career behind. Friends and family echoed his anxieties. “What if I was making a big mistake? This was so different from the medical career I had been training for. Could I do it?”\n\nLyra felt that his excitement overshadowed his fear. “While I genuinely liked being a lawyer and all that it entailed, I didn’t want to go through life without knowing what it was like to be a filmmaker,” he says.\n\nAs for Poulin: “All my friends were eagerly looking at different internships and law firms, and I did not share the same enthusiasm. I was missing that spark, that passion that I’ve always associated with acting.”\n\nAlthough the film industry is undeniably competitive (like many others), in Toronto the screen scene is booming. The city is home to one of the largest screen-based industries in North America, employing over 35,000 people.\n\nKhithani, Lyra and Poulin realized that Toronto, with the proper training, could be the perfect launchpad for their new careers. The city’s world-class crews, soundstages and postproduction facilities have attracted the attention of not just local producers but major studios. TV shows and films that are shot in the Toronto area have included Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Suicide Squad, Shazam!, The Boys, Mayor of Kingstown, What We Do in the Shadows, The Umbrella Academy, The Handmaid’s Tale, Reacher and countless others.\n\nAccording to the Toronto Screen Industry Workforce Study, technological advancements are transforming the way screen content is being produced, and as a result new roles are emerging in the industry that require specialized skills. In addition, a large portion of existing workers (including key creatives) are nearing retirement, meaning the industry is realizing a skills gap.\n\nKnowing they needed an industry-based program, one they could complete quickly so that they could launch their new careers faster, Khithani and Lyra enrolled in the Film Production Diploma Program at Toronto Film School (TFS). Poulin made the leap too, enrolling in TFS’ Acting for Film, TV and the Theatre Diploma Program.\n\nThe trio discovered a number of advantages to attending Toronto Film School. The school provided:\n\nThe program’s brevity — graduating with a diploma, portfolio and connections in just 18 months — was a major draw and in line with Khithani, Lyra and Poulin’s wish to launch their new careers fast.\n\n“I was so nervous walking into Toronto Film School on my first day,” Khithani explains. “What scared me was that I was going all-in into a life path that was only real in my imagination. But honestly, [I realized] if not now, then probably never.”\n\nLyra’s situation was quite different from most students. Enrolling at Toronto Film School required a trek of 8,000 kilometers from his home in Rio de Janeiro. However, he found unwavering support from family and friends. “Many were surprised,” he admitted, “but those closest to me were incredibly encouraging.”\n\nPoulin’s decision to enroll in the acting program was influenced by a love of the craft that hailed back to plays she performed in sixth grade. “I just told myself that I would never know whether I had what it takes if I never tried,” she says. “I did not want to look back at my life in the future and have regrets. So, I just closed my eyes and made the big jump.”\n\nFast-forward 18 months. Poulin has recently graduated and has already starred in a commercial. She has also played a supporting role in a film directed by one of the school’s faculty, actor John Tench. Tench has 180 acting credits on IMDb, exemplifying the school’s commitment to employing instructors who are active professionals in the industry.\n\nKhithani, too, has found success since graduation, now working regularly as a third assistant director. “I love all the new places I get to visit. I love working with actors whom I’ve looked up to my whole life,” he says. His credits include Something Undone (starring Billy Campbell), Trust Me, I’m a Doctor (with Linda Hamilton)and Close to You (starring Elliot Page).\n\nAs for Lyra, he now runs his own production company. He wears many hats there, producing, writing and consulting on film, television and new media projects. He also teaches at the school and finds time to share his knowledge by giving occasional lectures.\n\nLyra notes, “The fear has completely gone away. With a deeper understanding of the business, it becomes self-evident that this is absolutely a viable career.”\n\nKhithani, Lyra and Poulin’s desire for a career change is more common than you might think. According to Statistics Canada, one in four university graduates is thinking about going back to school or changing their career.\n\n“There are definitely some days where I look at all my friends back home who have ‘traditional’ jobs and ask myself if I’m crazy for doing this,” Poulin says. “But then I think of the thrill and happiness that I feel when I get to act, and I know I’m doing the right thing.”\n\nWhile a career change might seem like starting from scratch, most people possess valuable transferable skills from previous work or school experiences. These skills can be a significant asset when venturing into a new field and will likely increase one’s chances of success. Khithani highlights how the scientific method he learned in university helps him now in his new career: “The scientific method are the steps scientists use to draw conclusions when testing hypotheses. Having that drilled into my head during university, I use the same process when making decisions on set. It has helped me tremendously.”\n\nToday, Toronto Film School is home to three downtown campuses, including a 17,000-square-foot studio campus. The school’s recent investment of $2.5 million in the purchase of new industry-grade cameras, lighting and shooting equipment is designed to give students hands-on experience with the same gear the pros use, and a significant edge in the job market.\n\nLyra has some advice for aspiring creatives: “Research the marketplace. This is a profession ignited by passion, but you need more than that to succeed. Whether you’re coming to TFS or not, take the time to familiarize yourself with the marketplace — read the trades, arrange talks with industry professionals, track social media groups — and understand where you can realistically fit in.”\n\nKhithani adds, “You may not have everyone’s support. But if you don’t take this risk, someone else will. Make it you instead.”\n\nPoulin agrees, “While life is short, it is also way too long to do something that you do not love. Go for it.”"
