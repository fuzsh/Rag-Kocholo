        "text": "Similarities:\n\nFor both COVID-19 and flu, one or more days can pass from when a person becomes infected to when they start to experience symptoms of illness. It is possible to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 without experiencing any symptoms. It is also possible to be infected with influenza viruses without having any symptoms.\n\nDifferences:\n\nIf a person has COVID-19, it could take them longer from the time of infection to experience symptoms than if they have flu.\n\nFlu\n\nTypically, a person may experience symptoms anywhere from one to four days after infection.\n\nFlu Symptoms\n\nCOVID-19\n\nTypically, a person may experience symptoms anywhere from two to five days, and up to 14 days after infection.\n\nCOVID-19 Symptoms\n\nSimilarities:\n\nBoth COVID-19 and flu can spread from person to person between people who are near or in close contact with one another. Both are spread mainly by large and small particles containing virus that are expelled when people with the illness (COVID-19 or flu) cough, sneeze, or talk. These particles can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the respiratory tract. In some circumstances, such as indoor settings with poor ventilation, small particles containing virus might be spread longer distances and cause infections.\n\nMost spread is by inhalation of large and small droplets; however, it may be possible that a person can get infected by touching another person (for example, shaking hands with someone who has the virus on their hands), or by touching a surface or object that has virus on it, and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nDifferences:\n\nWhile the virus that causes COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, the virus that causes COVID-19 is generally more contagious than flu viruses. Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu. This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can quickly and easily spread to a lot of people and result in continual spreading among people as time progresses.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to others by people before they begin showing symptoms, by people with very mild symptoms, and by people who never experience symptoms (asymptomatic people).\n\nHow Flu Spreads How COVID-19 Spreads\n\nSimilarities:\n\nBoth COVID-19 and flu can result in complications, including:\n\nPneumonia\n\nRespiratory failure\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (fluid in the lungs)\n\nSepsis (a life-threatening illness caused by the body’s extreme response to an infection)\n\nCardiac injury (for example, heart attacks and stroke)\n\nMultiple-organ failure (respiratory failure, kidney failure, shock)\n\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (involving the lungs, heart, or nervous system or diabetes)\n\nInflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle tissues\n\nSecondary infections (bacterial or fungal infections that can occur in people with flu or COVID-19)\n\nDifferences:\n\nFlu\n\nMost people who get flu will recover on their own in a few days to two weeks, but some people will experience severe complications, requiring hospitalization. Some of these complications are listed above. Secondary bacterial infections are more common with influenza than with COVID-19.\n\nDiarrhea is more common in young children with flu than in adults with flu.\n\nFlu complications\n\nCOVID-19\n\nAdditional complications associated with COVID-19 can include:\n\nBlood clots in the veins and arteries of the lungs, heart, legs or brain\n\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and in Adults (MIS-A)\n\nAnyone who has had COVID-19, even if their illness was mild, or if they had no symptoms can experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID Conditions are a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection.\n\nSimilarities:\n\nPeople at higher risk of complications or who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 or flu should receive recommended treatments and supportive medical care to help relieve symptoms and complications.\n\nDifferences:\n\nFlu\n\nPrescription influenza antiviral drugs are FDA-approved to treat flu. These antiviral drugs are only for treatment of flu and not COVID-19.\n\nPeople who are hospitalized with flu or who are at increased risk of complications and have flu symptoms are recommended to be treated with antiviral drugs as soon as possible after illness onset.\n\nFlu Treatment\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed guidance on treatment of COVID-19, which is regularly updated as new evidence on treatment options emerge. This includes antiviral treatment for non-hospitalized people at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and antiviral treatment for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19. People who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 should seek treatment within days of when their first symptoms start.\n\nWhat to Do If You Are Sick with COVID-19"
