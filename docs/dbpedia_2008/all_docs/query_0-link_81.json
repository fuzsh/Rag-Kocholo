        "text": "August 13, 2024\n\nArtificial intelligence and autonomy took center stage as Dr. Kimberly Sablon, the principal director for Trusted Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy for the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, took part in discussions on AI’s role in national defense on the last day of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies conference Aug. 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nDr. Binda Nair, director of Basic Research in the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, hosted a panel on “University Industry Partners,” where experts in academia discussed the progress and status on the Department of Defense’s science and technologies programs within academic institutions across the nation at the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies conference in Aug. 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nApril 9 2024\n\nIn a heartfelt farewell to 50 years of unwavering service, Dr. Steven G. Wax, the acting lead for science and technology within the Office of the Under Secretary of Research and Engineering, has bid goodbye to his tenure, leaving behind an indelible mark on the Defense Department’s R&D enterprise.\n\nJanuary 24, 2023\n\nThe Department of Defense released Version 4.0 of the Online Cyber Resilient Weapon Systems Body of Knowledge January 24, 2024. This free resource assists the public and private sector workforce in designing, engineering, and safeguarding CRWS.\n\nVersion 4.0 adds new features, design and usability upgrades, and security improvements to encourage and enhance user engagement. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense’s System Security Directorate launched this vital resource in May 2021 for the system security engineering and science and technology communities. Since then, SysSec has released several version updates to improve the CRWS-BoK user experience.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nSE&A Policy and Workforce completed and USD(R&E) approved DoD Instruction 5000.97, “Digital Engineering,” available from the Washington Headquarters Services website. Digital engineering supports the systems engineering process by moving the primary means of communicating systems information from documents to digital models and their underlying data. Digital engineering is a critical practice in an environment of dynamic threats, system complexity, and rapidly evolving technologies. The DoD instruction establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides procedures for implementing digital engineering in the development and sustainment of defense systems. Specifically, the issuance directs program managers to implement digital engineering practices to maximize the benefit and to support a comprehensive systems engineering program.
