        "text": "2. Who was Rajkumar Shukla Why has he been called resolute? • Poor sharecropper from Champaran • He had come all the way from Champaran district in the foothills of Himalayas to Lucknow to speak to Gandhi. • Shukla accompanied Gandhi everywhere. • For weeks he never left Gandhi’s side till Gandhi asked him to meet at Calcutta. • Succeeded in taking him to Champaran\n\n3. Why do you think the servants thought Gandhi to be another peasant? • Ans: Shukla led Gandhi to Rajendra Prasad’s house. The servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman. Gandhi was also clad in a simple dhoti. He was the companion of a peasant. Hence, the servants thought Gandhi to be another peasant.\n\n4. What was the sharecropping arrangement between the farmers and British landlords. Why did landlord want after Germany developed synthetic Indigo? • Farmers were supposed to grow indigo on 15% of their land. • The peasants paid the British landlords indigo as rent. • Now Germany had developed synthetic indigo. So, the British landlords wanted money as compensation for being released from the 15 per cent arrangement. • This was irksome for farmers / some paid/ some went to court.\n\n5. Why did Gandhi had to chide the lawyers of Muzzafarpur? • They charged high fee from the farmers • Going to court was no solution • Farmers needed to be free from fear\n\n6. How was Gandhi able to influence lawyers? Give instances. • Gandhi asked the lawyers what they would do if he was sentenced to prison. • They said that they had come to advise him. If he went to jail, they would go home. • Then Gandhi asked them about the injustice to the sharecroppers. • The lawyers concluded that it would be shameful desertion if they went home.\n\n7. “What was the attitude of the average Indian in smaller localities towards advocates of ‘home rule’? The average Indians in smaller localities were afraid to show sympathy for the advocates of home-rule. They stayed away from it. Gandhi stayed at Muzaffarpur for two days at the home of Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school. It was an extraordinary thing in those days for a government professor to give shelter to one who opposed the government.\n\n8. Why was it an extraordinary thing for Professor Malkani to welcome Gandhiji? The average Indians in smaller localities were afraid to show sympathy for the advocates of home-rule. Professor Malkani, a teacher in a government school gave shelter to Gandhiji who supported it.\n\n9. How do we know that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement? • Professor J.B. Kriplani received Gandhi at Muzaffarpur railway station at midnight. He had a large body of students with him • . Sharecroppers from Champaran came on foot and by conveyance to see Gandhi. Muzaffarpur lawyers too called on him. • A vast multitude greeted Gandhi when he reached Motihari railway station. • Thousands of people demonstrated around the court room. This shows that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement in India.\n\n10. Why do you think Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from Rajendra Prasad’s well at Patna? • The servants of Rajendra Prasad thought Gandhi to be another peasant. They did not know him. They were not certain whether he was an untouchable or not. They feared that some drops from his bucket might pollute the entire well. So, he was not permitted to draw water from the well.\n\n11. Why did Gandhi decide to go first to Muzaffarpur before going to Champaran: • Ans: Gandhi wanted to obtain more complete information about conditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. Muzaffarpur lawyers, who frequently represented peasant groups in courts, briefed Gandhi about their cases.\n\n12. How did Gandhi react to the commissioner’s advice? Where did he go and how did people react to his arrival? • Ans: Gandhiji did not leave Tirhut division. Instead, he went to Motihari, the capital of Champaran. Several lawyers accompanied him. At the railway station, a very large crowd of people greeted Gandhi.\n\n13. What according to Gandhi was the beginning of the poor peasants’‘Liberation front fear of the British’? . Ans: The next morning the town of Motihari was black with peasants. They had heard that a Mahatma who wanted to help them was in trouble with the authorities. They spontaneously demonstrated, in thousands, arround the courthouse. Gandhiji called their action of protest as their liberation from fear of the British.\n\n14. What was the “conflict of duties” in which Gandhi was involved? • Ans: First, he did not want to set a bad example as a law breaker. Second, he wanted to render the “humanitarian and national service” for which he had come. He respected the lawful authority but disregarded the order to leave to obey the voice of his conscience.\n\n15. “Civil disobedience had triumphed, the first time in modern India.” How? • Ans: A case against Gandhi was initiated for disregarding government orders. The spontaneous demonstration of thousands of peasants baffled the officials. The judge was requested to postpone the trial. Gandhi refused to furnish bail. The judge released him without bail. Several days later Gandhi received an official letter. The case against him had been dropped. Thus, civil disobedience had triumphed.\n\n16. What amount of repayment did the big planters think Gandhi would demand? What did Gandhi ask? What amount was finally settled? • Ans: They thought Gandhi would demand repayment in full of the money they had extorted from the sharecroppers. Gandhi asked only 50 per cent. The planters offered to refund up to 25 per cent. Gandhi was adamant on 50 per cent. The deadlock was broken when Gandhi agreed to a settlement of 25 per cent refund to peasants.\n\n17. How did Gandhi work for rural uplift during his stay in Champarant • Gandhi wanted to do something to remove the cultural and social backwardness in Champaran villages. • He appealed for teachers. Two young disciples of Gandhi, Mahadev Desai and Narhari Parikh and their wives volunteered themselves for work. Several others responded from distant parts of the country. • Mrs. Kasturba Gandhi and Devdas, Gandhi’s youngest son, arrived from the Ashram. Primary schools were opened in six villages. Kasturba taught the ashram rules on personal cleanliness and community cleanliness. She also talked to women about their filthy clothes. • Health conditions were miserable. Gandhi got a doctor to volunteer his services for six months. Only three medicines were available: Castor oil, quinine and sulphur ointment. • Thus, Gandhi never contented himself with large political or economic solutions. He worked for total uplift of villages and the poor sections of the society.\n\n18. Self-reliance, Indian independence and help to sharecroppers were all bound together.’Elucidate on the basis of reading ‘Indigo’by Louis Fischer.\n\n19. How was champaran movement a turning point in Gandhi’s life?. • India’s first civil disobedience movement spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi • Mahatma Gandhi’s first attempt of implementing his satyagraha mode of protest • tremendous symbolic victory for Mahatma Gandhi • new era of the nationalist movement that slowly transformed Mohandas into Mahatma. • movement showed the importance of being self-dependent and self-sufficient • Involvement of the masses\n\n20. The author says that it was typical of Gandhi to intertwine his politics with day-to-day problems of the millions. What does this mean? a) He did not alienate himself as a political leader while dealing with the masses. b) His political involvement started from the life of ordinary people. c) He gave equal importance to the problems of common people. d) Their fight against injustice was as important to him as the national freedom movement. e) It was his concern for the masses that gave him their involvement in his every struggle.\n\n21. Why is the Champaran episode considered to be the beginning of the Indian struggle for Independence? ? • Ans. The Champaran episode began as an attempt to ease the sufferings of a large number of ’ peasants. He got spontaneous support of thousands of people. Gandhi declared that the British could not order him about in his own country. Under his leadership, the peasants became aware of their rights. Raj Kumar Shukla, a farmer of Champaran helped him a lot in bringing about the change. Other peasants too fought courageously and contributed in their own way to the movement. It resulted in their winning the battle of Champaran. The effects of Gandhi’s method of non-violence and non-cooperation proved very fruitful in this movement. Hence, it can be said that the Champaran episode is the beginning of the Indian struggle for independence.Informed the general\n\n22. Freedom from fear is more important than Legal justice for the poor.” Do you think that the poor of India are free from fear after Independence? • Ans: For the poor of India means of survival are far more important than freedom or legal justice. I don’t think the poor of India are free from fear after Independence. The foreign rulers have been replaced by corrupt politicians and self-serving bureaucracy. Power- brokers and moneylenders have a field day. The situation has improved in cities and towns for the poor but the poor in the remote villages still fear the big farmers and moneylenders. The police and revenue officials are still objects of terror for them. • The poor, landless workers have to still work hard to make both ends meet. Peasants and tenant-farmers have to borrow money from rich moneylenders on exorbitant rates of interest, which usually they fail to repay due to failure of monsoon or bad crops. Cases of small farmers committing suicide are quite common. If this is not due to fear, what is the reason behind it?"
