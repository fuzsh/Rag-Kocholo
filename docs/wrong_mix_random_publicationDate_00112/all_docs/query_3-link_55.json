        "text": "Recent political developments in the US inspired a look at the first 6 months of planetary transits to the Inauguration 2017 horoscope. This resulted in slight amazement at how many transits offer frustration and delay for the White House. Perhaps you are not surprised, dear reader, since recent news reports contain only partial success for Mr. Trump's and Mr. Bannon's policies such as banning visitors to the US from Muslim countries (though not the ones that participated in the attacks of 9/11). When the outcry was more than the White House anticipated, an attempt was made to blame President Obama's previous list of nations but that ploy isn't working very well either for the amateurish crowd now mishandling the White House.\n\nBut whether or not you agree that Mr. Trump and his minions are 'mishandling' our government, the 2017 planets in their courses are objectively showing a picture of frustration and a stalling of the administration's dearest objectives with only partial success at best. So by the time of a major signpost, when the Sun opposes Inauguration 2017 Sun, aka, POTUS, will plans and aims progress for the White House and thus for the nation?\n\nHere's a bi-wheel with the Inauguration 2017 horoscope inside and transits for July 23, 2017 set for 8:08:40 am edt, the moment the Sun @00Leo49:53 opposes the POTUS Sun (00AQ49:53) in what some call an 'un-birthday'. If you enlarge the chart perhaps my scribbles will become legible for almost everything I wish to say about the matter is squished upon the chart including the primary point about an un-birthday: time to measure progress or the lack of it; unfavorable for ego-related pursuits (such as those driven by ego); reassess priorities and change course, if necessary:\n\nOutside the chart/s are penned Mr. Trump's natal planets, plus, the Solar Eclipses of September 1, 2016 (9Vir21) and February 26, 2017 (8Pis12) are added. Actually, transit Saturn in Sagittarius squaring Inauguration 2017 Mars (24Pis21) is quite enough to block, restrict, or delay initiatives and skew their plans. Calm persistence and patience (not Mr. Trump's best qualities with natal Mars rising with royal Regulus in vain Leo) are the keys to success. However, this Saturn-Square-Mars transit perfects three times in 2017--once already on January 29th, again on June 17th, and finally on October 29, 2017 so frustration is in effect the entire year. (Of course, other transits aid or deny POTUS plans as well but that's a post of a thousand words so let's not for now.)\n\nNow Mr. Trump's 'first 100 days' ends on April 29th (or the 30th at noon, the way I count it) so that has become an important presidential benchmark since the days of FDR. When I looked at transits of that day there's a Lunar Return to the New Moon in Gemini which timed Mr. Trump's announcement of a White House run in June 2015 (as he descended from on high in Trump Tower to speak before a paid audience). Shortly before 9:00 pm on April 29, 2017, Luna sails across the 00Cancer Cardinal World Point of manifestation which creates two Sun-Moon blends of cosmic weather for April 29, 2017: Sun Taurus-Moon Gemini (dusty Earth-Air) and Sun Taurus-Moon Cancer (muddy Earth-Water). For comparison's sake, here are the Images for Integration for both blends which may or may not relate to the condition of Mr. Trump's administration after its first 100 days:\n\nSun Taurus-Moon Gemini: A wealthy publisher launches another new project...A restaurateur earns a reputation for delicious souffles and meringues...A scientist brilliantly discourses on the mysteries of nature.\n\nSun Taurus-Moon Cancer: Dr. Spock teaching mothers how to bring up their children...A baker undertakes to feed an orphanage...Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.\n\nSo apparently by the end of April we'll have fluffy souffles and/or the angry swan of the Cygnus constellation. Well, I don't know about you but I'm not certain which, if any, to cheer for.\n\nRelated posts include: The Whimsical Sun (POTUS) of Inauguration 2017; and don't miss the rock 'em sock 'em natal chart of Donald Trump!\n\nRecommended as always: Sun Sign-Moon Sign, by Charles and Suzi Harvey.\n\n2017: The Year of the Rooster Brings a Call to Action!\n\nDuring my early years of astrological studies, several branches of the ancient craft were investigated but my personal link to Washington DC (twice a resident) and a long term interest in Politics (4 natal planets in governmental Capricorn) made Mundane Astrology, and specifically Political Astrology, a preferred focus of my studies. Yet Chinese Astrology speaks to many people, of course, so when I discovered the following video report by global astrologer and spiritual teacher Gahl Sasson concerning 2017 as the Year of the Rooster, it reminded me of our new president, Mr. Trump, his self-promoting, bombastic ways, and 2017 as his first year in office.\n\nFor as you've undoubtedly noticed, our new boaster-in-chief proudly crows of his own greatness at every opportunity (and then some!), and the off-and-on activation by transit Jupiter, planet of expansion and promotion, of the 23rd degree of Libra, plus, the fact that Mr. Trump is in the midst of a three-fer Jupiter Return (his @17Lib27), have all inspired me to embed this 2017 video report and add the Sabian Symbol for 23 Libra, below. First, here's Gahl:\n\nBe sure to visit Gahl Sasson at his Cosmic Navigator website.\n\nFor America, 2017's 'Call to Action' Must Work Both Ways\n\n'23 Libra': Chanticleer Salutes the Rising Sun with Exuberant Tones - Keyword: FERVOR; positive expression: a fearless self-affirmation which gains a sympathetic attention and wins immediate allegiance from the hearts and minds of everybody (what Mr. Trump desperately desires from the public and from the press - jc); negative (unconscious--jc) expression: ill-starred conceit and ineffective bombast (The Sabian Symbols in Astrology, Marc Edmund Jones).\n\nPerhaps such an unconscious expression of the crowing rooster archetype suggests that Mr. Trump has no idea how others actually see him or his actions. He seems to have quite a different view of himself--including physically--than most of the rest of us do and lives in a fantasy world all his own while his Mercury-Neptune square imagines that his policies are more supported by the majority than they are. And so for many reasons, We the People must hear and respond to 2017's call to action with actions of our own!\n\nNow each new president redecorates the White House and the gilded Mr. Trump could never be an exception to this particular tradition. However, it's all too telling that he chose to hang a portrait of Andrew Jackson in his new office as a symbol of their shared 'populism' which brings with it a (perhaps unconscious) nod to their shared preference for ethnic cleansing. That Jackson as president voraciously fought against the establishment of an American central banking system (the vipers!) is apparently and perhaps purposefully lost upon Mr. Trump as he chose his billionaire Cabinet members. So far Mr. Trump's intentions promise to injure, or perhaps paralyze, the US economy (exs: repeal the ACA/'Obamacare'; place up to 20% tariffs on Mexican imports; deport workers which the agricultural and other industries depend upon).\n\nIf such executive actions, rubber-stamped by a Republican-led Congress, cause a major downturn in the US economy and cause extreme suffering across the land, no amount of crowing will bring the rooster-esque Mr. Trump the popular approval he so hungrily craves.\n\nFebruary 2017 'Wild Card' Eclipses with Murky Karmic Conditions\n\nIn February 2017, the first eclipse of the year is a Lunar Eclipse on February 10, 2017 @22Leo followed by the February 26, 2017 Solar Eclipse @8Pisces in the 19 South Saros Series. Here are both charts set for Washington DC; please enlarge to read notes for not all chart factors will be discussed in the following text:\n\nLunar Eclipse @22Leo28 Feb 10, 2017 7:32:49 pm est:\n\nSolar Eclipse 19 South February 26, 2017 9:58:19 am est:\n\n19 South last manifested on February 16, 1999 @27Aquarius, the position of US natal Moon (We the People) for those who use a late afternoon chart (July 4, 1776). The next Solar Eclipse in 1999 was the 'King of Terror' (or 'Alarm') eclipse which had apparently been predicted by doctor, seer, and astrologer Nostradamus with its Fixed Grand Cross of planets in mid-degrees of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. And into the New Millennium, we know what the so-called 'War on Terror' brought the world, don't we?\n\nThe August 11, 1999 Solar Eclipse is aka, The Mother of All Eclipses because it's in the 1 North Saros Series. 1 North will repeat across the continental US as The Great American Eclipse on August 21, 2017 @29Leo, a critical degree that conjoins Mr. Trump's natal Ascendant and his rising star Regulus. This will 'pull in' his natal Mars @26Leo as well and gives us pause when we consider that Mr. Trump was born into the 2 Old North Saros Series which occurred on May 30, 1946 @9Gemini--conjunct America's revolutionary planet of anarchy, Uranus. His natal Uranus is prominent in his natal 10th house (the world stage) and my suspicion is that the US and global Million Woman Marches the day after his inauguration, plus, other protests against Trump's Uranian presidency are only the beginning of the disruption and chaos he and his ilk will cause. I sincerely hope not, but there it is.\n\nUnconscious Lunar vs Conscious Solar\n\nAll that aside, my purpose in this post today is to publish the February 2017 Lunar and Solar Eclipse horoscopes (set for DC) but also to mention a bit about the role of a Lunar Eclipse in relation to a Solar Eclipse. Naturally, the astrological Moon represents the unconscious and the Sun aligns with the conscious mind. Instinctive habits and childhood are in the realms of the Moon while one's adult personality and purpose are solar functions symbolically seen in horoscopes by the Sun and its condition via sign, degree, house placement, and aspects to other planets and points.\n\nWith a Lunar Eclipse, the sign relates to how we instinctively respond to karmic events and circumstances so the February 2017 Lunar Eclipse in Leo signifies pride, vanity, conceit, egoism, and drama with a potential for leadership qualities. If there is spiritual support for karmic progress to be made it is seen via the house polarity of the eclipse, a Full Moon, and in this case, the Lunar Eclipse manifests across the 6/12 victim-savior axis in Washington, as you see, and this also includes Health Matters, Jobs, Police, and Civil and Military Service. And of course, in Mundane Astrology, politics, backroom deals, large institutions such as hospitals and prisons, karma (reaping what's been sown), and self-undoing are associated with the secretive 12th house of The Unconscious.\n\nAs you see, the previously occurring Solar Eclipse @9Vir21 (Sept 1, 2016) is also in 12th house of this chart but there's a new solar influence coming on February 26th which will override the effects of the Virgo Solar Eclipse and its themes of truth-tackling and realism--which struggled because it was opposed by delusional, deceptive Neptune in Pisces. On one level, Neptune has expressed in the Collective as fake (Neptune) news or facts (Saturn). Yet realistic, authentic Saturn does not care for Kellyanne Conway's promotion and use of \"alternate facts\" as on the January 22nd Meet the Press (video)! But what else does Mrs. Conway have to offer the public? She may hear Mr. Trump's \"You're fired!\" sooner than she thinks if he no longer considers her useful.\n\nAstro-Notes for Kellyanne Conway.\n\nStill, it is a fact that the February 10th Lunar Eclipse occurs prior to the February 26th Solar Eclipse, a condition reflecting the waning or declining phase of the Moon from Full brightness to New shadiness. This suggests a passive response on our parts to what the Pisces Solar Eclipse has in store for Humanity (11th house). And since the 11th house is also the house of the US Congress (senators and reps alike) we may expect Neptunian actions of a secretive and/or undermining nature to be taken against the public with Pisces ruled by Jupiter, sub-ruled by Neptune--and Neptune as Key Planet (a 3m-22s-degree orb to the Solar Eclipse).\n\nSo instead of Neptune influencing a solar eclipse by opposition as in September 2016 into 2017, Neptune will now conjoin the February Solar Eclipse which hints at the confusion, delusion, disappointment, obfuscation, lies, and even fraud and corruption which may be expected from a Trump administration peopled by amateurs, propagandists, anarchists, bankers, and foreclosure kings (like nervous tic Mnuchin). And with Neptune as ruler of mass media, some political pundits, media personalities, and reporters are already kow-towing to Trump's way of doing things (as in, no criticism allowed). The Trump administration prefers hiding behind Neptune's mask and a solar eclipse, the dark of the Moon (publicity), in the shady sign of Pisces is an opportune time for unpopular activities.\n\nHowever, there are several planetary patterns in the charts, particularly in the Lunar Eclipse chart describing the public reaction to the Feb 26th Solar Eclipse conditions. Two Kite patterns (high-flying success) involve the Moon (We the People) and one Kite includes the Sun (leadership). A Mystic Rectangle of practical mysticism made up of positive sextiles and trines provides inspiration, and two T-Squares (though one only expresses at MC and involves corruption and improbable schemes) tell a tale of 'The Big Picture' directed by powerful Pluto at 18 Capricorn, the Uranus-Neptune New World Order degree spotlighted in 1993. This apex Pluto parallels asteroid Cupido which denotes The Family, The Underworld Syndicate, and Corporatism which are the puppet-master entities that exploit us. Jupiter-Uranus = apex Pluto suggests devices that transform the world (Munkasey) and/or sudden changes in financial conditions (Ebertin).\n\nThe Lunar Eclipse's degrees of Moon and Sun are revealing for Luna is at the 'worst foot forward' or 'foot-in-mouth' degree of Leo and the Sun's Sabian Symbol is: \"A Big Bear Sitting Down and Waving All Its Paws\" which may refer to Mr. Trump (his Leo Mars-ASC-Regulus on the Leo end of the Full Moon) and Vladimir Putin of Russia, a country known by its symbol of a Big Bear.\n\nWith Pisces There Are Karmic Implications Afoot\n\nThe karmic implications of a (secretive) Pisces Solar Eclipse imply much difficulty uncovering hidden relationships and the causes of negative conditions due to a multiplicity of veiled factors which are made even more obscure because the Virgo-Pisces axis and solar eclipse are intercepted--here, across the Self-Will axis (5/11) in Washington, DC. A karmic stalemate is in force as the eclipse manifests and affects the Collective (around the time of the Feb 10th Lunar Eclipse) although the interception will disappear as the chart and the year progress. Dream interpretation may be helpful for those who are interested in finding insights as they drift up from the personal and the Collective Unconscious--as long as taking action isn't allowed to be stymied or negated by Piscean apathy or laziness.\n\nMy suspicion is that most people could agree that the positive traits of Pisces such as compassion and creative inspiration are much preferred when dealing with societal problems and issues rather than austerity measures that cause suffering such as cutting social programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and/or Social Security. Such cuts will not only cause suffering and harm to the American people but will seriously affect the US economy, damage already in the works under the GOP 'repeal and replace' ideology meant to sabotage the ACA.\n\nThe time for apathy has long passed, dear reader! For as progressive broadcaster and author Thom Hartmann has often said, Democracy is not a spectator sport...participate!\n\nRelated: Karmic Planets Hit Natal Chart of Donald Trump including Saturn, planet of realism and accountability.\n\nThrough the years I've used my series Wedding Day Astrology to examine the relationships of quite a few famous couples, some in the Entertainment field, some in Politics, with the Sun operating as the male principle (husband) and the Moon as the feminine principle (wife). Lady Venus and lusty Mars are important in a relationship, too, of course, but I prefer to use a simpler personality model when investigating a private relationship such as a marriage.\n\nNow that the new Trump administration is underway and White House press secretary Sean Spicer has made quite a loud splash, let's take a gentle peek at the Spicer-Miller partnership. Like her husband, Mrs. Spicer has also worked in news and communications but you can look up professional credentials for them both if you're interested. Last I heard, the couple live in Alexandria, Virginia with their two children and Mr. Spicer holds the rank of Commander in the Naval Reserve.\n\nOn November 14, 2004, The New York Times published an announcement of the Rebecca Miller, Sean Spicer wedding which took place the day prior on November 13, 2004. On that day (with the hour of their ceremony unknown), we find Sun in Scorpio and the Moon entering Sagittarius shortly before 1:00 am. Therefore, it is safe to say that their wedding and marriage are signified by a steamy, volatile Water-Fire combo, a Sun Scorpio-Moon Sagittarius blend of energies, and the following description refers primarily to Mr. Spicer as the solar partner and Mrs. Spicer as the lunar partner yet it also describes the combination of their partnership expressing as one entity.\n\nSun Scorpio-Moon Sagittarius denotes passion, loyalty, and commitment. Values are important within this combo of idealism and realism though a fanatic streak may be seen via a tendency to moralize and expect the world to conform to their views. When it comes to socializing, a holier-than-thou attitude may be present and 'paranoid grumpiness' may be avoided once the need for emotional intensity vs intellectual equality are balanced.\n\nEssentially, this is a trustworthy and effective combination which works well within group dynamics though there may be a sting in its tail (provided by the scorpion) which can provoke others. Ambitious and self-dramatizing, the Sun Scorpio-Moon Sagittarius blend is good for careers in Politics, Education, Investigation, or Philosophy, to name a few.\n\nNow here is a rather interesting quote concerning this blend from the Harveys' Sun Sign-Moon Sign:\n\n\"Although you are forthright about your beliefs and your moral standards, you will hold back a trump or two when it comes to feelings, if you judge it wise.\" My guess is that a wise Mr. Spicer will be called upon to hold back many a 'trump' as he faces the media to speak on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\n~:~\n\nPrevious Wedding Day Astrology reports include: Donald and Melania Trump; Paul and Janna Ryan; Bill and Hillary Clinton; Joe and Jill Biden; Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky; and Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nAs the Trump Administration Unfolds, Sales of 1984 Rise\n\nThe year 1984 brought two solar eclipses which manifested on May 30th at 9 Gemini in the 4 North Saros Series and November 22nd at 1 Sagittarius in the 4 South series. Now, in 2017, if Mr. Trump wants to spotlight comparisons between his new administration and the dystopia of double speak and other horrors found in George Orwell's novel 1984, he could hardly have done better than the obvious falsehoods asserted in recent days by his press secretary Sean Spicer. Add to those Kellyanne Conway's recent remarks on Meet the Press where her phrase 'alternative facts' gained much public and media attention, if not favor. Mr. Trump's stupendously incredulous presidency is now officially on parade for the world to see though the widespread applause he craves is in very short supply.\n\nThe Solar Eclipses of 1946 (Trump), 1966 (Conway b. 1967), 1984, 2002 (Bush)...and 2018\n\nOne curious fact about the 4 North eclipse of 1984 is that it not only conjoined America's natal Uranus (8Gem55), planet of war, revolution, and violence, but activated a fixed star, one of the royal stars and Watcher of the East, Aldebaran (aka, the bull's eye--details below). Unfortunately for those of us who dissent from the electors of the Electoral College who selected the boasting manbaby Mr. Trump for a chaotic stint in the Oval Office, 9 Gemini is also the degree of Donald Trump's Prenatal Eclipse in the 2 Old North series which occurred May 30, 1946 conjunct US natal Uranus. Of course, all eclipses are considered 'wild cards' of the Universe due to their unpredictable Uranian disruptions and revelations and here we see them as 'time links' between 1946 (Trump), 1966/67 (Conway), 1984 (4 North and Conway's 4 South), 2017 (the year of Trump's rise to power), and to year 2018, when Mr. Trump's difficult 2 Old North series next repeats at 21 Cancer.\n\n4 North themes: restriction, restraint, inhibition, separation, and illusions; events occur that seem to block progress and those affected tend to overestimate or misjudge their strength or the situation; caution against taking action is advised until the eclipse passes. 2 Old North themes: unfortunate news concerning relationships; separation; the ending of a union (paraphrasing Predictive Astrology, Brady). Note that 4 North and 4 South also repeated in 2002 during the Bush-Cheney first term that brought the anti-constitutional actions of preemptive war, invasion, and occupation of the Middle East.\n\nSo the Trump-Pence administration's 'alternate facts' promoter Kellyanne Conway is influenced by her Prenatal Eclipse in the 4 South Saros Series which repeated as the second Solar Eclipse of 1984 when Conway was a teenager. For 4S's difficult themes, please follow the link to read a few astro-notes concerning Kellyanne Conway.\n\nWill 2020 Bring a Final US Presidential S-election?\n\nWith heavy significance, 1984's 4 North will repeat at the Summer Solstice of 2020 at 00 Cancer, one of the Cardinal World Points of Manifestation, followed by a 4 South Solar Eclipse on December 14, 2020 at 23 Sagittarius. Did prescient author George Orwell, the prophet, study eclipses?\n\nOf course, many people would discount Astrology as a lens under which to examine Politics and politicians, and that's their loss. As for those who discount the time linking ability of eclipses (by their 19-year series repetition or by degree), you can simply sit back, watch, and listen as Orwellian double speak and double dealing reach new depths under the alt-right presidency of Donald J. Trump.\n\nAnd now, this:\n\n\"...Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience. In other words, I feel that the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four is destined to modulate into the nightmare of a world having more resemblance to that which I imagined in Brave New World.\"\n\nFrom a letter to George Orwell, dated 21 October 1949; from 'Letters of Aldous Huxley', ed. Grover Smith; Harper & Row, 1969. (My italics. jc)\n\nAnd here is a copy/paste of one of my 2008 posts, with a few edits for readibility:\n\nOrwell explains mass-media deception\n\n\"The process (of mass-media deception) has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt...\"\n\n\"To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary.\"\n\n--George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty Four, published in 1949\n\n~:~\n\nThe journalist and writer whose pen name was George Orwell was born during a Balsamic Moon phase in Motihari, India on June 25, 1903; his birth time is unverified but generally taken to be 11:30 am -5:40 LMT.\n\nBalsamic types tend to be prophets of the future and few would deny him that label. His Sun and Moon in early Cancer conjoin hatal Neptune 3Can23, and it's not unusual for someone with a Sun-Neptune conjunction to change their identities in some way. Pen names are a good example and can give a loose grasp of their 'real' identities at best.\n\nEndings and partings are usual for Balsamic types for they often arrive just in time to take over for someone who's just left. Sun-Moon Cancers tend toward mother complexes as well, plus, Cancer is a sign of patriotism.\n\nThe 'Images for Integration' for the perceptive, suspicious, attached-to-the-past, highly creative and sensitive Sun Cancer-Moon Cancer blend are:\n\n\"A gosling peeks out of its shell as mother goose chases away the farm cat...A theatrical family performs 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' in their own garden.\" (Sun Sign-Moon Sign, Chas & Suzi Harvey.)\n\nThat feline must be the 'farm cat' from Orwell's other best-selling novel, Animal Farm!\n\nNote: always a best-seller, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four sales are zooming up on Amazon thanks to the Trump administration.\n\nAldebaran (alpha Tauri; the brightest star of the Hyades, the weepers, and malefic due to its opposition to Antares) is \"the great cornerstone marking the spring equinox, and in this capacity, Aldebaran was the god Mithras, or Ahura Mazda, the slayer of the cosmic bull. Mithras was a great military god who gave victories to his followers but only if they followed the strictest procedure in his worship. This procedure is also reflected in the writings and worship of the god-prophet Zarathustra, of Persian (Iranian) origin...his name means star worshiper\". Failure for his followers meant condemnation to 'an ordeal by fire'; \"Mithras was a warrior king who also bore the title 'lord of contracts'.\"(Fixed Stars, Brady). Restoring earth to its original state of perfection (as political ideologues and other Utopian zealots aim for in the form of dystopian global government--\"Make America Great Again!\") is part of such pagan teachings. Does the title \"lord of contracts\" remind you of the new White House deal-maker-in-chief?\n\nIn Western Astrology, links to warmonger Aldebaran indicate that success may be taken away if integrity and ethical standards are not upheld. But how one manages this while waging war is a mystery to yours truly. Is it possible that Mr. Trump's natal Mercury-Neptune square of fact-distortion, misguided perceptions, and indiscretion figures it out?\n\nThe Current Jupiter-Uranus Opposition Imprints Upon the Trump Presidency\n\nby Jude Cowell\n\nSince the Electoral College's selection of Donald J. Trump to play the role of US president has occurred under the auspices of a Jupiter-Uranus opposition--which usually forms a BOWL shape of planets with CEO-financier Jupiter in the lead--let's consider the trails and conditions of Jupiter and Uranus during Mr. Trump's first term with the Jupiter-Uranus opposition as the cosmic imprint upon his entire presidency.\n\nNow as you know, when planets meet by degree in conjunction, it is the beginning of a new cycle and with Jupiter and Uranus, that new cycle started in 2010 and spread into 2011 with three Great Conjunctions: June 8th @00Ari18 (a World Point of Manifestation), September 19th @28Pis43, and on January 4, 2011 @27Pis02. The Jupiter-Uranus pair represent multiple potentials, some of which are: protests, strikes, unrest, revolution, change for the sake of change, reforms inspired by religious ideals, legal methods utilized against breakdowns in order, legal or religious stifling of justice for the common people, growth following periods of reform, exaggerated disruptions, accepted contrariness, peculiarities, the need to give opinions where little skill or expertise exists, freedom and independence issues, zealous representation of one-sided views, group organizing, magnifying or exaggerating everything, philosophical and political conflicts, fortune hunting, speculation, discoveries, inventions, and/or a sudden release of tension or strain.\n\nPrudence, far-sightedness, and lucky breaks can be part of the Jupiter-Uranus picture as well and concerning events of 2010 and 2011, 'Arab Spring' uprisings in the East and, in the West, the 'Tea Party' formation and its congressmen come to mind. Under consideration now on Capitol Hill for Mr. Trump's Cabinet is Tea Partisan Representative Tom Price, a Republican from my home state of Georgia.\n\nNow here is a chronological listing of recent and current Jupiter and Uranus Stations Direct and Rx--four turning points--across the Aries-Libra axis in 2016--2017:\n\n1. Jupiter Direct Station @13Virgo15 May 9, 2016;\n\n2. Uranus Direct Station @20Ari33 December 2016 (conjunct US natal Chiron);\n\n3. Jupiter Rx Station @23Lib08 February 6, 2017;\n\n4. Uranus Rx Station @28Ari31 August 3, 2017.\n\nA Cosmic Impact on Donald Trump?\n\nOne reason I believe the current 'dance' of Jupiter and Uranus is pertinent for our nation in these uncertain days is that the newly-presidented Mr. Trump was born with natal Jupiter @17Lib27 Stationary Direct in his 2nd house of Money, Possessions, and Values (with deceptive Neptune and Chiron) and Jupiter is engaged in a 12-year cycle, a Jupiter Return, to natal position in his chart, usually a fortunate period. We may wish to credit his political 'lucky win' to Jupiter's magic wand. Yet his Jupiter Return 2016/2017 is a three-fer becoming exact on: 1. December 4, 2016; 2. April 13, 2017; and August 4, 2017.\n\nBut it's not all Jupiterian roses for the grabber-in-chief since the transiting Cardinal square between radical Uranus and wealthy gold-hoarding Pluto is involved off-and-on: tr Uranus opposes natal Jupiter (misplaced optimism, results of professional expansion are unpredictable and possibly unfavorable, circumstances and people are difficult to manipulate to advantage) and tr Pluto squares his natal Jupiter (exaggerated self-importance and taking himself too seriously can be stymied by those with more power and influence). The Million Woman March across America and the globe on January 21st (the day after Trump's inauguration and his bleak inaugural address) displayed People Power and emphasized the fact that Mr. Trump has No Mandate from We the People.\n\nLet's note that at the age of 70, he may be privileged to experience an upcoming Uranus Return to its natal sign and degree. Natal Uranus @17Gem53 (in 10th house with North Node and natal Sun--a radical reformer and tradition-breaker is he) returns on: 1. August 14, 2029; 2. November 2, 2029; and 3. May 27, 2030 when tr SN conjoins natal Uranus, a very separative condition.\n\nAs for the current BOWL pattern formed with the Jupiter-Uranus opposition as its 'lip', we've discussed the pattern in prior posts but let's review since it describes a new presidency. According to Marc Edmund Jones, a BOWL 'holds things' and in a horoscope creates a hemispheric emphasis depending on its tilt. Since this is a transiting BOWL, the tilt varies but we can say that the occupied segment shows activity and organization (from Uranus in Aries to Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagittarius, and Scorpio) and the unoccupied segment (from Jupiter in Libra to Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini, and Taurus) 'becomes a challenge to existence' and denotes where needs exist and are influenced 'constructively or vindictively' by an orientation that arises from division.\n\nYet there are available planets in the unoccupied signs which have opportunities to fulfill the mission or promote the advocacy of a cause implied by a BOWL shape for in the empty segments (signs) not contained by the BOWL we find Mr. Trump's Sun-NN-Uranus trio in Gemini (he airs dilemmas but can or will he improve them?), his Venus and Saturn in Cancer, and his natal Pluto in Leo and Mars rising at Ascendant in Leo with royal Regulus.\n\nAlso in the empty segments of the BOWL we find US natal planets: Venus-Jupiter-Sun and Mercury-Rx in Cancer and US natal Neptune in Virgo. Other planets may also aid in the mission of the Trump presidency and the Republican objectives that lurk behind the new president's populist curtain of campaign promises.\n\nIn closing, here are the dates that the ongoing Jupiter-Uranus opposition has and will become exact: 1. December 26, 2016 @20Ari/Lib33 with Uranus Rx; 2. March 2, 2017 @22Ari/Lib11 with Jupiter Rx; and 3. September 28, 2017 @27Ari/Lib22 with Uranus Rx, and Jupiter Direct and headed for the ruthless corporatist sign of Scorpio which moneybags Jupiter enters in October 2017.\n\n~:~\n\nJupiter-Uranus info based primarily on the works of R. Ebertin and M. Munkasey.\n\nNatal data: Donald J. Trump June 14, 1946 10:54 am edt Queens, NY, BC/BR; USA July 4, 1776 5:09 pm LMT Philadelphia, PA with expansive Jupiter in patriotic Cancer as chart-ruler and Cardinal Points at MC (00Libra) and IC (Aries Point).\n\n'11 Aries' = \"The President of the Country\": This is a symbol of high ego on the impersonal side, evident in the complete and naive dedication of the individual to some part he chooses to play among his fellows. Implicit here is the selection of such a role as will have a maximum breadth of recognition, so that the player may be established in a reality which he would be quite unable to sustain by himself. There is a subordination of all other considerations to one primary act of individual assurance. The keyword is IDEALIZATION.\n\nWhen positive, the degree is the self-sacrifice required of anybody who would become the creative representative of anybody who would become the creative representative of eternal value, and when negative, an often well-meaning but usually destructive assertiveness or vain pretense.\n\n- The Sabian Symbols in Astrology, Marc Edmund Jones.\n\nTo this degree, Dane Rudhyar adds in his An Astrological Mandala:\n\nKEYNOTE: The power resulting from the formal integration of the collective desire for order.\n\n...At this ego level, laws and the restrictive power of a police force are dominant features. Psychologically speaking, this means that the integrative principle is the limited, more or less narrow \"i am\" realization. It manifests itself as the personal ego exerting its will to control the reactions of the bio-psychic organism.\n\nIt indicates a CENTRALIZATION OF POWER at the level of a rigidly structured consciousness.\n\nJanuary 20, 2017 Capitol Building noon Inauguration 2017 - cosmic vibes of the day:\n\nSun Aquarius-Moon Scorpio (Air-Water = ethereal mist): charisma, keen insight, strong-willed, egoistic, dogmatic, stubborn, ambitious, self-reliant, an astute observer, a reformer, emotionally blows hot and cold, all-or-nothing, self-important, desire to improve the welfare of others, potential for ruthless behavior and manipulation.\n\nSun AQ-Moon Scorpio is the natal Sun-Moon blend of writer-historian Henry Brooke Adams who famously informed us that, \"Politics, as a practice, whatever its professions, has always been the systematic organisation of hatreds.\" - Sun Sign-Moon Sign, Charles and Suzi Harvey.\n\nWelcome to Washington, Mr. President.\n\nWith Director James Comey and the FBI under something of a congressional microscope these days it seems the still-current September 1, 2016 Solar Eclipse @9Vir21 has been very active within the Collective in more ways than one. Its 'truth tackling' theme is operative though the American people may wonder if such a noble quest is in need of cleansing since transiting Neptune @10Pisces (planet of deceit, disguise, and dissolution) opposes the eclipse and muddies issues via distraction, insinuation, and outright lies. Subterfuge, spying, sabotage, and hacking are on various agendas these days and the perpetrators are not all based in the USA. And if the undermining of yet another of America's institutions (ex: the FBI) is one of their objectives, the plan is working quite well for public scrutiny is more scathing than what congress members are fitfully dishing out.\n\nNYT Jan 13, 2017: Democrats Confront FBI Chief at Closed-Door Intelligence Briefing. Sh-h-h! Secretive Neptune at work!\n\nAnd as Hillary met with the FBI last year concerning her emails, I wondered if the 19 North Solar Eclipse would manifest early. (Tap or click and you'll find a link to a post concerning the FBI natal chart and the 19 North eclipse with its 'realism' and 'truth' themes which are background influences in force until the next Solar Eclipse on February 26, 2017--or within two weeks prior to that date; there is also a Lunar Eclipse @22Leo due on February 10th which we must soon discuss).\n\nAll this to say that the current Virgo Solar Eclipse (Virgo, sign of discrimination, purification, and criticism) in the 19 North Saros Series resonates strongly with the Comey-directed agency since 19 North is the Prenatal Eclipse of the FBI which was created on July 26, 1908. Nowhere can I locate an exact or approximate hour the agency came into force so noon on that date (Washington, DC) is used to set up a natal horoscope for our domestic spies. Formed during a Uranus-Neptune opposition, the agency formed during a period when one ideology was replacing another and I think most historians would agree that major shifts in our nation's goals and direction took place during the first years of the 20th century. Example: President Wilson campaigned on a 'peace platform' yet secretly pledged America into World War I, the 'war to end all wars' which, as we now know, was actually the war to start all wars, as planned by the racketeering big bankers of the day.\n\nNote that the 'Federal Reserve Bank' of the US was secretly created during those years in order to force its credit and usury systems upon the US government and the American people--once the Panic of 1907 was engineered to make such a change seem necessary to the public.\n\nNow there's that pesky 19 North again--helping us see things as they really are rather than what we previously thought they were! Apparently, 19 North is a handy lens of clarity through which to see through propaganda and how the American people have so often been duped into accepting banker-engineered wars and now, a presidential campaign and 'election' full of lies, fraud, innuendo, and--as it now seems--interference by foreign governments. Yes, opposing Neptune in its own sign of Pisces is at work dissolving the US election system and the government that goes with it.\n\nAnd I don't know about you but personally I'm tired of the media-fueled 'debate' of distraction from real issues over why Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. She lost because the Electoral College selected Donald Trump to play a presidential role he's ill suited for in spite of the populist campaign promises he had, and has, little if any intention of fulfilling. So thanks for nothin', Federal Bureau of Investigation, your \"cabal within\" played a large part in the current political drama with Neptunian flair and ideological zeal in the ongoing plan to take over America and rule the world. After all, 2017's transit Pluto @18Capricorn = 1993's Uranus-Neptune conjunction/s: *the big picture demands a certain course of action, very little option to do otherwise.\n\nAs previously posted, here are a few Dates and Degrees of 19 North which first manifested on July 5, 1331 (OS) @20Cancer:\n\nJuly 31, 1962 @8Leo (conjunct the natal Mercury of the Republican Party); July 20, 1944 @27Cancer (opposite US natal Pluto); July 9, 1926 @17Cancer; June 28, 1908 @7Cancer (conjunct US natal Jupiter); September 1, 2016 @9Virgo; next: September 12, 2034 @20Virgo. 19N is the Pre-Natal Eclipse Series of: America's Great Seal (1782), the Republican Party (1854), LBJ and the FBI (1908), and the death of Marilyn Monroe (1962). Was Marilyn about to 'tackle the truth' too inconveniently for certain politicians? You see, correlating the years of 19N with events and the presidents then in office can be quite informative although history doesn't repeat...but it does, as they say, often rhyme.\n\n~:~\n\n*Solar Arcs, Noel Tyl.\n\nEclipse themes: Brady's Predictive Astrology.\n\nIn this image the natal planets of VP-elect Mike Pence (R-IN) are penned around the outside of President-elect Donald Trump's natal chart which shows a few descriptive links between the men, one born in June 1946, the other in June 1959. Mr. Trump's chart and planets are highlighted in orange, Mr. Pence's planets are in blue-green with no angles shown since I don't have Mr. Pence's birth time; therefore, 'noon' positions are entered on the chart:\n\nNaturally, Mr. Pence's natal planets were transits in 1959 for the almost-13-year-old Donald Trump.\n\nDT = Donald Trump; MP = Mike Pence; MP's natal Moon ranged from 23Gemini to 6Cancer over the 24-hour period of his birth day.\n\nThe links that pop out at me (and are not dependent upon an accurate birth hour for Mr. Pence) are:\n\nDT's late Leo Mars and Ascendant are conjoined by MP's natal Pluto @1Virgo. All three conjoin royal star and 'kingmaker' Regulus (success if revenge is avoided); this creates midpoint pictures with potentials, one of which is penned, lower right: DT Mars/MP Pluto = DT ASC: daring (Ebertin); coercive measures; intimidation (Munkasey); also: DT Mars-ASC = MP Pluto: violence; a love of quarreling; desire to rule others; premature action; forcible adjustment to new circumstances and conditions (Ebertin). As always, any, all, or none may apply.\n\nTogether they concentrate Mars-Pluto force with its potentials for chaos, aggression, suppression, and/or oppression.\n\nMP Sun @16Gemini conjunct DT Uranus @17Gemini: quirky, rebellious Uranus which not only leads all of Mr. Trump's natal planets but is oriental (rising just before his Sun) has MP's natal Sun shining upon it which suggests that pride may interfere with group endeavors and cause separation or disruption, and loyalty issues may ensue. This connection shows DT inviting MP to take a leadership role and hints that MP was selected for his traits and abilities that DT lacks (obviously!). Yes, they are a team yet trouble may develop unless MP accepts DT's non-traditional ways of doing things, and/or if their egocentric personalities cause too many quarrels over authority issues--especially with DT's planet of authority and responsibility (Saturn) in Cancer opposed by MP's natal Saturn strong in its own sign of Capricorn. Plus, MP's Saturn widely opposes DT's Mercury which suggests MP's need for DT to become more sober in his communications--if not, then restriction, criticism, or resentment may occur.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Pence's Solar Return in June 2017 will reveal their Sun-Uranus link either positively or negatively, and it will be a Sun-to-natal-Uranus transit for Mr. Trump.\n\nMP Mercury @21Gemini conjoins DT Sun and North Node of public contact and future direction. This connection suggests the ideas and goals of DT which are in sync with MP's thoughts and expression of them to the public via the media or via speeches, meetings, and/or pressers. It also indicates the more aggressive and dramatic forum that MP has now thanks to DT; Mr. Pence may add his input to DT's ideas and plans but this must be done gingerly by MP or the super-sensitive DT may take offence (or perhaps MP will manage to turn DT's ideas and plans into something totally different than what DT intended. This is perhaps not a good idea.\n\nAn interesting link is formed on MP's Nodal Axis in DT's 2nd house of Money and Values which holds Trump's Jupiter-Neptune 'speculator' pair (and which rule DT's natal 8th house of Corporatism and Debt via its shady Pisces cusp). DT's Juno (a political asteroid) is there are well along with guru Chiron, the blind spot. This picture is fraught with complexity beyond the scope of this meager post but with MP's North Node conjoining DT's 2nd house trio, Mr. Pence may find himself dealing with such monetary themes in his public contacts before their first term ends. The presence of wounded/wounding Chiron between DT's Jupiter and Neptune seems to be a sign of Mr. Trump's many bankruptcies and over-extensions of credit to the point of massive debt to foreign banks. DT's chronic non-payment of workers he hires may be pictured here as well along with his over-inflated boasts of his wealth.\n\nNow there are other chart factors between them that are worth considering such as MP's Jupiter Rx conjunct DT's IC--opulent surroundings, gain via real estate?) but these are the primary ones I see. You may see others, of course, and a study of their progressions and return charts will yield more information about their association (and make for a much longer post).\n\nThere is one more thing I want to mention: Mr. Pence's natal Chiron Rx @27AQ38. As you know, Chiron is the Wounded Healer, priest, guru, mentor, and blind spot--and signifies the Christ archetype in a horoscope. Here we find that MP's natal Chiron conjoins US natal Moon (We The People) of July 4, 1776. This conjunction suggests the religious aspect of Mr. Pence but perhaps also a kind of wounding which may occur due to Theocracy being brought into the US government where it doesn't belong. I say this as a Christian myself and as a Child of the Revolution--one who demands that church and state remain as separate as possible in America for the sake of religious freedom. For it is my belief that morality cannot be legislated but must come from within each individual. Externally enforced morality is a false morality and only serves to enslave not free!\n\nDisagree if you must but there it is. And if I've missed a link between their natal planets that you consider important or you have info to add to the above assessment please let me know in a comment or at judecowell at gmail dot com.\n\nRelated posts: The Asteroids and Dreams of Mike Pence; The Oriental Planet of Donald Trump; Horoscope: Inauguration 2017; and Horoscope: The Great American Eclipse of August 2017--the 'splitting' energies of which will imprint upon the presidency of Donald J. Trump. Or should I say, the Trump-Pence presidency?\n\nAnd This Includes the American Revolution\n\nAs you know, General Smedley Butler is famous for advising us that, War is a racket.\n\nPolitical Astrology, Jupiter-Pluto, and Plutocracy\n\nFor an astrological portrait of big banker plutocrats and the politicians whose actions they control and direct, more than one planetary signature may be employed. The 'Plutocracy' pair of Jupiter-Pluto with its 13-year cycle is a prominent factor worth considering when it comes to financial, political, and militaristic topics.\n\nWhere are we now in the cycle? Jupiter Square Pluto\n\nThe current Jupiter-Pluto cycle began with their conjunction on December 11, 2007 @28Sag24 (where transit Mercury turned Direct early this morning--Jupiter-Pluto = Mercury: a propaganda campaign; the desire to influence many people - Ebertin). When I think of Jupiter-Pluto, I think of The Federal Reserve Banking System and how its insertion into the US government was secretly planned on Jekyll Island, Georgia in December 1910. Tap or click here to view a horoscope of the New Moon that perfected while the traitors sneakily hunkered down together during the dark of the Moon...Senator Aldrich, immigrant Warburg, Morgan agents, and the rest.\n\nCurrently, the off-and-on-again square between Jupiter and Pluto suggests a time when wheeler-dealers such as Mr. Trump are prominent and a tendency toward political maneuvering such as gutting ethics rules oversight is in evidence. As you know, the de-fanging of the congressional ethics office was the very first thing the new Republican-led 115th Congress attempted and they will try again as contributing to questionable endeavors, large-scale enterprises that affect many people, dubious financial schemes, and other exploitative attitudes continue through the first term of Mr. Trump. Under this plutocratic square, large gains will be expected from little effort, although with a square's blocking potential, some measure of disappoint may occur.\n\nNow Sun-Pluto fanatically craves power and Pluto-Chiron certainly signifies Plutocracy, plutocrats, and their centuries-long oppression and exploitation of the masses and this would necessarily include The US Fed and other transnational bankers coup'ing countries across the globe--one of the topics of the above video. Actually, it was the announcement of Fed Head Ben Bernanke on December 11, 2007 at 2:15 pm est (I was watching on Live TV) that perked up my ears since the last conjunction of Jupiter and Pluto began that very same day at 2:34 pm with Mr. Bernanke at the podium! I posted on the topic on December 10, 2007 if you wish to view the 2:15 pm horoscope which shows (unsurprisingly!) Plutocracy's Pluto-Chiron midpoint at MC, the Goal Point of the announcement about interest rates.\n\n2017 Jupiter Retrograde: Hold That Tiger\n\nAs for the Trump-Pence administration, their first year in office will be imprinted by a Jupiter retrograde period of delay which lasts from February 6, 2017 (@23Lib08 conjunct starry Spica and Arcturus) until June 9, 2017 when Jupiter turns Direct @13Lib13 conjunct US natal Saturn (suggesting a partial easing of responsibilities!), and less than an hour prior to a Full Moon @18Sag53. As you see, an eventful year is promised on many levels and it is directly personalized for Mr. Trump (and thus for the American people) thanks to his being born with a strong Stationary Direct Jupiter @17Lib27. In addition, February 2017's Lunar and Solar Eclipses up the anti and may reveal more inconvenient truths followed in August by two more eclipses--one of which is The Great American Eclipse and its path of visibility which 'splits' our nation from Oregon to South Carolina.\n\nToward the end of Trump's first term as president, many astrologers including yours truly are concerned about the Great Conjunctions of year 2020. Included are the next conjunction/s of Jupiter and Pluto which perfect on April 5th @24Cap53, June 30th @24Cap06, and November 12th @22Cap52. I intend to post more Political Astrology details concerning 2020 as my schedule permits.\n\nCan Washington DC's Past Inform Our Nation's Future?\n\nby Jude Cowell\n\nDid you know there's a website containing curious facts concerning our capital city and its monuments, particularly the phallic obelisk, the Washington Monument? Washington DC: Chamber of Secrets (#ad) reveals some of the past machinations of our Masonic Founding Fathers and their contemporaries who designed Egyptian, Roman, and Greek tributes and symbols that were purposefully built into the city's architecture and monuments.\n\nThis could be a fascinating topic for US History buffs who wish to see below the surface of the time-honored myths associated with America's Founders, with Washington DC's construction, and with the beginnings and continuance of the US government these 241 years. The Founders' esoteric leanings seem especially a timely study in my opinion since the continuance of the US government is more in question now than ever before for we face a questionable, nontraditional regime of a chaotic, ham-fisted Trump administration and its lack of a mandate from We the People.\n\nPredictably, Sun worship plays a major role, of course, and we've see this plainly in our 'cult of personality' presidencies through the decades, with Trump no exception (Campaign 2016 was all about his 'character' and 'temperament'). What isn't widely appreciated is how US Constitution Day, September 17th, plays into the solar idolatry with the Sun seeming to pause atop the Washington Monument at 6:43 pm each year--on September 17th. Here, as in Freemasonic rituals, there are death and rebirth themes laced underneath the surface and even the blood and sacrifice of the Civil War are part of the picture as is the assassination of President Lincoln--and the positioning of his Memorial (1914--1922). Stand at the bottom of its steps on a certain date (April 9th), look toward the Reflecting Pool, and at 7:38 am you'll see the same solar performance as the Sun 'sits' atop the Washington Monument.\n\nCoincidental? Puh!\n\nNow I'm not certain the website linked above mentions it so I will...the star that the Washington Monument points to in the heavens is Porrima, a star of fertility--and of prophecy. Yet isn't it curious that our first Masonic president, George Washington, known as the 'Father of Our Country', never generated natural children of his own? At least, as far as I know! This infertility may have been caused by an early case of smallpox, if memory serves, but still...he was, they say, a good dancer (natal Sun in creative Pisces, ruler of feet)!\n\nNow there are other curious facts concerning our nation and its purpose and you can probably think of them on your own but I do hope you'll visit the website I mention (buy the book or not! I did so it's on my shelf as I type) if you haven't, and perhaps you might ponder the facts of the mysterious case we call the United States of America and divine what our nation's ultimate destiny is meant to be--especially with such a presidency appearing on the future dance card of We The People.\n\nThursday January 5, 2017 1:50 pm est\n\nAs of today the leading opinion in the recently posted Stars Over Washington 'Trump Poll' (A Trump Presidency will be--) is: one big scam. Runner-up is a distopian nightmare, and number 3: the end of America. The 4th possibility has zero adherents, undoubtedly because that answer is a dream come true.\n\nAnd so I'm proud to say that readers of Stars Over Washington, those who go to the trouble to participate in polls (please do! sidebar, upper right), possess a clear-eyed, realistic view of the ongoing train wreck that is Washington DC Politics 2017 and have faced the haunting specter of the alt-right and theocratic ideologues who will sway Mercurial Gemini Mr. Trump on many social and political issues which will closely affect the American people, undermine the US Constitution, and ruin the US government more than it already has been. And considering Mr. Trump's conflicts of interest, past and current shady dealings, scams, frauds, billionaire buddies, possible mob ties, a basic lack of understanding of the necessary 'blind trust' requirement, and a thousand other issues and protocols that most people understand and would abide by, this freedom-loving fellow (who threatens to jail others and 'loves to fire people') sees only the ironies convenient for him to see. It appears to this astrologer that his fighting, egoistic Leo Mars rising with royal Regulus will signify much of his hot-mess presidency ruled by whim and retaliation.\n\nAnd as anti-democratic and bigoted as his Cabinet members and staff of operatives may be, astrologically we can expect Mr. Trump's natal Uranus (radical reformer, rebel, anarchist) posited at his birth in changeable, sometimes unreliable Gemini to lead his pack of planets with all the disruptive, maverick, and chaotic energies it and he can muster. For as you know, the sign of Uranus in a natal chart describes behavior and with Trump's Uranus oriental and leading a BOWL shape, chatty deal-making Gemini is one of the main archetypes that We The People are facing with Mercury the ruler of Gemini and his Sun (personality) and North Node (public contact) in the sign as well.\n\nAnd yet his Mercury in Cancer, sign of shrewd business ability and love of family and country, provides him some measure of perception, intuition, and objectivity (since Mercury is not in his Sun sign) even though his Mercury, planet of thinking processes, is ruled by the Moon (feelings, emotions) so We The People have that goin' for us. We find Mr. Trump's extreme defensiveness displayed via his tweets and remarks that punch back at all detractors (\"enemies,\" he says) since Cancer, sign of the crab, always scuttles sideways to avoid dealing with unpleasant encounters--such as blame, criticism, and other people's opinions and ideas.\n\nHowever, he relates to others (via Jupiter's sign--his moneybags planet is strong for it's Stationary Direct) as a Libra with the placement's constant \"it's not fair!\" refrain ringing in our ears, and yet his Moon-South-Node conjunction does not make for popularity and indicates mommy issues, or, at the least, a deep sense of separation from the crowd. This spot in the Zodiac (for him, 22 Sagittarius) is where the karmic planet of restriction and blockage, Saturn, now tromps and conjuncts natal Moon-South-Node and opposes his natal Sun in Gemini. This transit is quite a cosmic Ouch!\n\nAnd so...\n\nThe SO'W Trump Poll remains open until midnight January 20, 2017 (Inauguration Day) and if you haven't, please register your opinion if you have a moment. Multiple answers are acceptable which may come in handy for those who feel torn between the nightmare and the dream come true. That's a tiny little joke, in case you can't tell.\n\n~:~\n\nRelated Posts include: The Whimsical Sun (POTUS) of Inauguration 2017; Inauguration 2017: Midpoint Pictures and the Sun-Moon Blend (hint: someone's 'blind zeal' is showing); The Unaspected and Out-of-Bounds Planets of Donald Trump; After the Revolution: the Oriental Planet of Donald Trump; and Donald Trump and The Future, a message from activist Max Igan via video.\n\nAdditionally, typing the president-select's name into the SO'W sidebar Search field will present many possible reading opportunities for the daring...\n\nBelow is the Spring Equinox 2017 horoscope set for Washington DC (in its role as representative for all of America). As you see, the February 26, 2017 Solar Eclipse @8Pis12 is rising and you'll find a link to my notes concerning this eclipse and the August 21, 2017 eclipse ('The Great American Eclipse') at the end of this post:\n\nMarch 20, 2017 Washington DC: Ascendant @10Pis37; Neptune, planet of dissolution, deception, and fraud, rises which makes the speculation-wastrel-inflation pair of Jupiter-Neptune chart-ruler and co-ruler. Neptune in 1st house with the ASC bracketed by Neptune-South Node (intrigue and unfortunate circumstances, scandals, water damage) also denotes uncertain, unstable conditions that are too big to handle; following Neptune are Chiron, Sun (at Aries Point = World Events), Venus Rx, Mercury at a critical degree, and disruptive zealot Uranus, still opposing Jupiter Rx but separating. This is a full 1st house so a very busy Spring season is on tap.\n\nedit: Plus, as you see, the February 26, 2017 Solar Eclipse (Spring EQ 2017's Prenatal Eclipse, or PE) @8Pis12 also rises and suggests that its 19 South themes will be affecting the Spring season agenda. Its themes are 'a pleasant surprise; a joyful event, sudden happiness, a lucky break or win, positive changes' (Brady). That's awfully good for a South Node eclipse which tends to indicate a draining of energies but I'll patiently wait all Spring for our ship to come in on Piscean seas, won't you?\n\n19 South last occurred on February 16, 1999 (conjunct US natal Moon @27AQ) and will next manifest in 2035 @19Pisces. Original post restarts here:\n\nWe The People React\n\nThen in 10th house we find a very close conjunction of Moon (We The People) and restrictive, depressive, austere Saturn @27Sagittarius, planet of laws and lawmakers. 'Overambitious pretensions' (27Sag) may be in evidence though strategy, ambition, and a sense of direction are positive potentials of Moon-Saturn contacts. Obviously, extreme apprehension (Saturn) affects the public (Moon) concerning the experiences that are coming up as Spring 2017 unfolds.\n\nAlso of concern is testy Mars @7Tau28 in 2nd house of the National Treasury. At the Goal Point (Midheaven, aka, MC) is 19Sag13 with moneybags Jupiter ruling there as well. Plus, Jupiter again leads a Locomotive of all the planets in his role as CEO and roughshod executive in a power position ('full steam ahead') leading onward toward fulfilling objectives which have been desired in some quarters since FDR's New Deal programs were instituted. Mr. Trump is simply the latest 'face' upon the austerity monster.\n\nSocial and political stability in 2017 are lacking in this horoscope as might be imagined with enemies of our social safety net now in charge of House and Senate and with their mouthpiece-of-sorts (the tweeter-in-chief) and Mr. Pence in control of the White House helm thanks to the Electoral College who overrode the popular vote in November 2016. Here we have another president with No Mandate from The Governed yet he'll act, talk, and tweet as if he's following 'the will of the people'! Yet in this chart the themes of the rising Solar Eclipse are positive and I'd prefer to hold positive expectations for the presidency of Mr. Trump but I think we all know what sort of things to expect instead from his highly suspicious anti-government/anti-New-Deal Cabinet choices and the overly Republican Congress, the 115th.\n\nThe 7th house Syzygy Moon (last lunation), a Full Moon @22Vir13, perfects on March 12th conjunct US natal Neptune, a further example of the instability in our society and current fraudulent political conditions in the US. Of course, Neptune also rules the masses, propaganda, poisons, and the media, most of whom colluded with the political class and their shared financial backers during the 2016 Campaign in order to produce such a 'president' to mislead our nation which will be dismantled along with the social safety net the elderly, ill, and weak depend upon. Survival-of-the-fittest guru Ayn Rand didn't believe in coddling the weak, you know (though she herself applied for and received social safety net benefits in her old age, the hypocrite). Apparently, age rendered her a \"useless eater\" too but don't tell Paul Ryan and his GOP cohorts (and the duplicitous Democrats who helped enable this whole scam). So it seems that the GOP depopulation program has now been officially established.\n\nWell, today is my birthday and I'm rapidly getting a headache just looking at this horoscope and thinking about how these knaves intend to line their and Wall Street's pockets at our expense (as always but on steroids) as 2017 plods along so I'll close for now and hope to add more details to my astro-notes concerning this horoscope at a later date. As I said, social and political stability in 2017 are lacking in the Spring Equinox 2017 horoscope.\n\nAnd yet we must not falter for our only hope is ourselves.\n\nA Related Post: 2015--2017 Solar Eclipses - see numbers 5 (February 2017) and 6 (August 2017)."
