Broadly speaking it includes any novel dealing with India which is written in English. Strictly speaking it means fiction mainly describing the life of Englishmen in India. In a still narrower sense it may be taken to mean novels dealing with the life of Eurasians, who now prefer to be called Anglo-Indians. A very large number of novels surveyed in this book are Anglo-Indian in the sense that they describe the life of Englishmen and Englishwomen in India. But the survey does not exclude Indian novels written by men of nationalities other than the English. It also includes novels describing the life of Eurasians and of Indians.\n\n2. Anglo-Indian fiction covers a period of about a century and a half. It may be divided into three periods. The first period begins with the Governor-Generalship of Warren Hastings and ends with the Indian Mutiny; the second period ends with the death of Queen Victoria and the publication of Kim in 1901; the third period begins with the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and may be said to be still in progress. The present survey, however, does not extend beyond the year 1930, which saw the publication of Edward Thompson’s book, A Farewell to India. Meadows Taylor and W. D. Arnold are the chief novelists of the first period; Sir Henry Cunningham and Kipling of the second; Edmund Candler, E. M. Forster, and Edward Thompson of the third. The novels of the first period are mainly romances of Indian history, or are descriptive sketches of English society in India; those of the second period are portraits of the official life of Anglo-India, mainly satirical; those of the third period show a vaster range in the choice of subjects and are a true reflex of the varied life and problems of India in transition. The first period shows the great influence of Scott on Anglo-Indian fiction and a little of Thackeray; the second period prepares the way for and sees the rise of Kipling; the third period continues the traditions of Kipling and shows some reaction against them.\n\n3. Main Ingredients of a Novel of Anglo-Indian Life\n\nA typical novel generally begins with a voyage, bringing the hero, more often the heroine, to the shores of India. On her arrival in a Presidency town or a mofussil ‘station’ she is welcomed by a father, aunt, or some distant relation, and invariably causes a flutter in the small Anglo-Indian colony there. She becomes the belle of the season, is much sought after, and goes through the usual round of Anglo-Indian gaieties. There follow accounts of burra-khanas, shooting-parties (generally tiger-hunts), picnics, visits to places of historical interest, balls and dances with their kala-juggas, and race-meetings. There are scandals and gossips at the club regarding her ‘doings’, interlaced with love-rivalries and misunderstandings, and finally everything ends in a happy marriage. A baboo, a begum, a nawab or a rajah, or a political agitator is thrown in for local colour, or to supply the villain indispensable to a work of fiction. There are, of course, many variations of the theme, but this may be taken as a skeleton of a typical Anglo-Indian novel. The hero, a handsome, strong subaltern, or a struggling assistant in the Civil Service, is seldom a model of virtue, but has invariably one merit: he is conscientious in the discharge of his duties. He risks his life in doing this, and whatever may be the trials and temptations of his position, he always remembers that upon him depends the prestige of the British Empire. He may make a fool of himself at the club or the regimental mess, he may gamble, drink, incur debts, and fight, but the moment he is dealing with an Indian\n\nHe only knows that not through him\n\nShall England come to shame.\n\nThe heroine of an Anglo-Indian novel is spirited, beautiful, courageous, and a good rider. She can talk well, and like the hero mentioned above has a proper sense of her responsibility as an Englishwoman in India. In spite of these admirable qualities she behaves foolishly, and involves herself in awkward situations from which it is the duty of the hero to extricate her. In most cases, however, she is a mere puppet. More interesting and individualized than the regulation heroine is the scandal-mongering, bitter-tongued, gossip-loving spinster, or the frivolous married woman, the peculiar product of Anglo-Indian life. It is she who relieves the monotony of life, keeps the clubs going, and is the chief source of attraction in a hill-station. It is she who enlivens the dull and dreary pages of Anglo-Indian novels. Some novels describe the beauty of Indian mountain scenery; the loneliness, silence, and spaciousness of our jungles; the splendour of our blue skies and starry nights; the sights and sounds of the bazaars; the scenes of sweating, shouting, brown humanity on a railway platform; and the picturesqueness, variety and squalor of Indian life in towns and in villages. Occasionally we get a glimpse of the zenana; an account of a nautch, Indian marriage, or funeral; the description of a communal riot or an epidemic; and a skilful handling of the problems arising out of the contact and conflict of East and West.\n\nThe mood in which these novels are written is generally one of disgust, sorrow, or ‘melancholy’. The sense of their being ‘exiles’ in a foreign land seldom deserts the English in India. Separation from their friends and families and the varied, intellectual, and civilized life of the West; the constant journeyings; the oppressiveness of the Indian climate in summer; the monotony of official life and the feeling that doing one’s duty in India is a thankless job—all these impart to the most frivolous novel a note of sadness.\n\nA common theme of these novels is the unhappiness, misunderstandings, and complexities of married life in India. Of course unhappy married life is not a feature peculiar to Anglo-India. Marriages go wrong all over the world. But taking into consideration the comparatively small number of the English in India, it is surprising that year after year novels should be written whose only interest lies in unhappy Anglo-Indian marriages. Love and marriage constitute the main staple of fiction. But the chief motif of Anglo-Indian fiction is not so much crossed love as the misery of married life.\n\nArtistically Anglo-Indian fiction is a record of the ephemeral. Excepting Kipling, there are not more than a dozen novels which may find a place in the history of English literature. Most of the modern Anglo-Indian novels are written by women. Most of them show little sense of style, are poor in characterization and plot construction, and occasionally suffer from a propagandist tendency. They are, however, valuable as showing how India has affected our rulers. If there are few instances of imaginative creation in Anglo-Indian fiction, it is at least remarkable for one character, i.e. Anglo-India.\n\n4. Early Anglo-Indians\n\nThe earliest Anglo-Indians are known as ‘nabobs’ in English literature. But the nabob of the English comedies is frankly a caricature of an Old Indian, if not a mythical monster. He is generally described as a parchment-faced, diseased-livered, wealthy, vulgar, and effeminate being whose only function (according to English comedians) was to make the audience laugh and to make a profligate nephew or an impecunious niece happy at the end of the fifth act or the third volume. But he cannot be taken as an average Englishman in India of the eighteenth century. He represents the wealth, extravagance, luxury, and vulgarity of a very few Anglo-Indians, but not their good points. He does not represent those Anglo-Indians who could not return to England because they were not rich; he does not represent the life of loneliness and suffering, or the struggles and trials of the earlier English adventurers in India who were never heard of in England. In view of the fact that only those Englishmen who had amassed much wealth could afford to return to England, it is not surprising that the English got the idea that all early Anglo-Indians were ‘nabobs’ and that India was an El Dorado. Contemporary memoirs and histories give a more accurate idea of the actual conditions of life here: of the wretchedness and desolation of friendless exiles separated from all that was dear to them, in a country where there was no one to relieve their sorrow by one gleam of sympathy or kindness. We learn from Lord Teignmouth’s (then Mr. Shore) biography that he had to tear himself from his wife twice because he could not expose her to the horrors of the deep and to the dangers of a savage country like India, that there were not two houses in Calcutta with Venetian blinds or glass windows, and that his salary as a writer was eight rupees a month. The Oriental Memoirs. of Forbes furnish the best picture of the cheerless life of a young English adventurer on his arrival in Bombay. He describes himself as a ‘solitary deserted being’ who had to go to bed sorely against his will soon after sunset, because he could not afford the luxuries of a supper and a candle. This, too, is not typical of the life of all Englishmen in all parts of the country, but it is useful as a corrective to the caricatures of the nabobs. ‘Sydney C. Grier’ (Miss Hilda Gregg) has described the lives of her countrymen in India in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or, as she herself puts it, ‘during the earlier stages of what it is correct to call the expansion of England’, in In Furthest Ind. (1894). Although it lacks the intimate knowledge of a contemporary document, yet as a general picture of the time her account may be taken as correct. She tells us that the Company’s servants went about in palenkeens, dressed in white to avoid the heat of the sun; that ‘meats’ were served on plates of china ‘that cracks when any poison touches it’; that behind each Englishman at the dinner table ‘stood an Indian servant with a great fan of peacock feathers’, and that royal ceremony was observed in bringing in and removing the dishes.\n\nIt will therefore be useful to discard the use of the word ‘nabob’ in connexion with Anglo-Indians of the seventeenth, the eighteenth, and the first quarter of the nineteenth centuries. It is better to call them Old Indians. Most of them, however, resembled a nabob in their love of show and fondness for pleasure. They were semi-orientals in their habits and manners of life, loving ‘splendid sloth and languid debauchery’. They married Indian women or entered into liaisons with them. At the back of their compound they had their zenana, where wandered a crowd of olive-coloured children. If they married English or European girls, they lived in a separate establishment, but not in such seclusion as was preferred by their Indian wives or mistresses. Even Englishwomen succumbed to the eastern environment. They smoked hookahs, drank claret and beer, and left their children to the care of Indian servants. Expensive dinners and horse-racing involved young ‘writers’ in debts. The then prevalent style of wearing the hair required the ‘obvious aid of huge cushions and masses of tow or horse hair’. Pelleting, or making pellets of bread and flicking them across the table into the mouth of a gentleman as he opened it to speak, was considered by some ladies the finest of entertainments. The life of English officers in up-country stations is summed up by Warren Hastings (The Great Proconsul, by ‘Sydney C. Grier’). These officers were devoted to their duties and field sports; they displayed an admirable interest in Indian arts and letters, but they were ‘almost as far removed as the Gentoos themselves from the society of Europeans’. They often devoted themselves to the acquisition of a fortune,\n\n‘with no higher end in view than to return to England as a nabob, displaying the usual marks of the species—a chariot at his door, madeira on his table, gold lace on his coat, and a black behind his chair.’ (p. 23.)\n\nThe usual mode of travel of Englishmen of average means was in palanquins or chariots borrowed from wealthy baboos. Men of position rode in state coaches with musalchis, chobdar. and a dozen servants running before and behind their carriage, shouting their titles. Most of them seem to have lost the will as well as the power to return to England. Those who returned to England felt as if in a foreign land. By the second quarter of the nineteenth century they were becoming as rare as a mummy.\n\n5. ‘Qui Hai’ of the Early Nineteenth Century\n\nThe ‘Old Indian’ imperceptibly changed into the Qui Hai. of the pre-Mutiny India. The Old Indian of 1845 is a different being from his prototype of 1785. We may distinguish him from his predecessor by calling him Qui Hai, a phrase common enough in the Anglo-Indian literature of this period. Several novels published between 1825 and 1844 show how a Qui Hai. differed from or resembled an ‘Old Indian’. Unlike the Old Indian, he gave up Indian zenanas and some oriental habits. Marriages with Indian girls did not cease altogether, but became less common. Love for the hookah still continued, and so did love of luxury and dissipation. The Old Indian was an Indianized Englishman. Qui Hai. retained his English habits and mode of life. Thackeray’s sketches of James Binnie, Joseph Sedley, and Colonel Newcome are sketches of Qui Hai. who, in their turn, have now become as extinct as the nabob or the Old Indian.\n\nThe Old Indians, as seen in the romances and romance-like books of travel (allowing for a little exaggeration), are generally ‘ill-mannered, illiterate, and immoral’. These pictures of Old Indians are made up of ‘unsightly groups of unprincipled adventurers—dissolute soldiers, corrupt civilians, usurious merchants—all alike ignorant and immoral’. The Old Indians of the second quarter of the nineteenth century, whom we have called Qui Hais, are no longer isolated savages dwelling in a remote country, where ‘the sound of the church-going bell’ is never heard, and the light of European science and literature never dawns upon the benighted vision. The Old Indian was cut off from England; the Qui Hai. was only six weeks behind his brothers and cousins in England. In the earlier period, the almost complete isolation from Europe of Englishmen in India tended to foster among them the growth of certain vices, such as avarice, lust, cruelty, &c. The moral and intellectual improvement of the Anglo-Indian of the first half of the nineteenth century was due to the steamship, to the example set before their countrymen by a number of Governor-Generals after Warren Hastings, and the establishment of the College of Fort William. Still, a Qui Hai. has not shaken off all the vices of his predecessor. How he appeared to an Englishman with the highest moral ideals, like W. D. Arnold, may be seen in Oakfield. In his amusements, ‘pig-sticking’, snipe-shooting, horse-racing, cricket matches, picnics, balls, and banquets, the Qui Hai. is as deeply absorbed as the Old Indian; also in his indifference towards, or lack of sympathy for, the people in whose midst he lived, and in openly treating a ‘black fellow’ as a beast, ‘to be driven, or otherwise employed, as seems fit to the white man, his master’, he is the lineal descendant of the Old Indian.\n\nThe Baboo and Other Tales. (1834), a novel descriptive of society in Calcutta, portrays a number of characters who may be taken to represent Qui Hais. Lady Wroughton, living in royal style, holding her levees, and spending money without caring how it was earned, is a portrait of a society lady of the time. Captain Forester is described as lost to Anglo-India, being too fond of ‘black velvet’. ‘Scribbleton Papers’ in Anglo-India. (1840) gives some sketches of Madras Qui Hais. Old Jeremiah Lawson, Chief Judge of the Sudder-ud-Dawlat, to whom Miss Scribbleton was promised as a bride, is a caricature of a Qui Hai. A more interesting and human book, giving a faithful portrait of bygone manners and customs, is The Lady of the Manor. (1844), by Mrs. Sherwood. The story of Olivia’s life in her semi-orientalized uncle’s household is the sad story of the steady degeneration of a girl of eighteen during her stay in India. Mrs. B. M. Croker, writing at a time when ‘skirt-dancing was as yet in its infancy’ and a ‘lady figurante was a rare spectacle on an Indian stage’, gives us a picture of Qui Hai, a man who had lived so long here that he had become ‘fossilized’ ‘Nothing outside India appealed to him; the easy-going life had penetrated to his very bones; he had his well-trained servants, his excellent food and liquor, his cheroot or his huka, his Pioneer, his long armchair, and his pet grievance.’\n\n6. ‘Competition Wallah’\n\nAfter the Mutiny and the institution of the Bengal Civil Service, the Qui Hais began to die out. In several books we find echoes of rivalry between Qui Hais or Anglo-Indians of the ‘old school’ and what the latter contemptuously styled ‘Competition Wallahs’. The Qui Hais were trained for service in India at Haileybury. Haileybury men were proud of themselves. Sir G. O. Trevelyan, in his letters written about the beginning of 1863, published under the title The Competition Wallah, shows how the Anglo-Indians of the ‘old school’ looked down upon the new civilians, and laughed at them. Married in India. (1910), by Constance Howell (a story of Anglo-Indian life in the ’sixties), contains an interesting passage showing the attitude of the post-Mutiny Anglo-Indian towards India, as well as his characteristics.\n\n‘Forty years ago, imperialistic sentiment did not exist. The English were not proud of the immense country they had conquered: including all India in a comprehensive contempt—they detested its climate, denied its interest, belittled its artistic achievements, abhorred its dark-skinned peoples, despised its language; and this condition of feeling was much stronger in the army than in the Civil Service. Army men professed to think that their own countrywomen had deteriorated by coming to the inferior land; and “I would never marry in India,” was a phrase fashionable among them: notwithstanding which affectation, many officers’ marriages did happen in India.’ (29-30.)\n\nIn this book the author explains the difficulties of English soldiers and civilians, with inadequate salaries and no private means, when they contemplated marriage in India. We learn that the railway did not exist beyond Cawnpore and the sahibs had to travel in doolis, each carried by four kahars. Their luggage was brought in banghi. escorted by native policemen.\n\nMr. Wetherall, the subaltern, is a typical soldier of the time. To him all Indians are niggers and ‘lying rascals’, who can be brought to their senses only by means of the whip. He is immensely pleased when his fiancée tells him the interesting story of how a poor copra-wallah was knocked down because he refused to sell his wares at the price which the frivolous Miss Avice Featherstonehaugh offered for them. Mr. Alexander Allardyce gives a portrait of Qui Hai. in the person of Eversley in The City of Sunshine. (1877), while Sir Henry Cunningham gives a pen-portrait of an Anglo-Indian of the new type in the character of Desvœux, ‘a poetical dandy’, dressed with a sort of ‘effeminate finery’.\n\n‘He was far too profusely set about with pretty things, lockets and rings, and costly knick-knacks; on the other hand, his handkerchief was tied with a more than Byronic negligence.’ (vol. i, p. 81.)\n\nDesvœux is a civilian ‘of the new regime’, ‘a competition wallah’, and has his fling at the ‘old ones’.\n\n‘“But you know,” he says to Miss Vernon, “how the old ones were chosen. All the stupidest sons of the stupidest families in England for several generations, like the pedigree-wheat, you know, on the principle of selection; none but the blockheads of course would have anything to do with India.” ’ (vol. i, p. 90.)\n\nIn Boldero, Sir Henry Cunningham has drawn a sketch of a district officer of the ’seventies. He is represented as over-zealous for the improvement and regeneration of mankind, disgusted with the complex machinery of government in which he saw ‘material, money, and time wasted; . . . office coming to dead-lock with office; one blundering head knocking against another; wants to which no one attended; wrongs which no one avenger’. He drove the Municipal Committee wild with projects of reform. He offended the doctors by invading hospitals, the chaplain by objecting to the ventilation the church and the length of sermons, the Education Department by a savage tirade on the schools, and the General by a bold assault on the drainage of the barracks—‘altogether a bustling, joyous, irrepressible sort of man’. In Blunt the author has projected a Competition Wallah into a Board, the other two members of which were educated at Haileybury, to illustrate the difference between the two types of officials. Sir Henry Cunningham acknowledges that ‘the vile corruption which characterized the East India Company in its earlier days’, which fired the righteous wrath of Burke, had disappeared, but ‘Indian Governments had long remained the home of jobbery’, and\n\n‘The stringent remedy of the Competitive System had been necessary to deal with the accumulated dullness with which licensed favouritism had crowded the ranks of the service.’ (p. 224.)\n\nIn The Old Missionary. (1897), Sir W. W. Hunter puts the following words into the mouth of a Lieutenant Governor of Bengal:\n\n‘You Competition men come to Bengal with your heads full of ideas, and you expect me to find the money to carry them out. Why cannot you be content with things as you find them, as we were before you? It is only a few years since poor John Company was shovelled underground, and already his peaceful ways seem to belong to a remote antiquity.’ (p. 9.)\n\nIn the last twenty years of the nineteenth century the few Qui Hais, left behind in the onward march of British administration, finally disappeared, having been replaced by Competition Wallahs. There is no Qui Hai in the next novel of Sir Henry Cunningham published nine years later. In Philip Ambrose he has depicted the temptations of a young, charming Indian Civil Servant without much character and experience. Kipling’s Anglo-India is the India of Englishmen of the new régime. With the beginning of the twentieth century the Competition Wallahs begin to be referred to as ‘heaven-borns’ by members of other services. Present-day Anglo-India is the India of the I.C.S.; other services do not count for much. Military Anglo-India has lost much of its importance in these days of peace.\n\nIn several other modern novels there is an occasional reference to the type of Anglo-Indian who has now become extinct. In The Star of Destiny. (1920) by Mr. H. M. F. Campbell we find an account of an Anglo-Indian of the old school. These old Anglo-Indians ‘regarded the native as a being of a totally different and necessarily inferior order of creation’; they learned as little of his language as was possible and deliberately anglicized it; they thought it was impossible to understand India and there was no use in doing so. They therefore made no effort to understand the country of their adoption. They came to India to amass a fortune, and were not too particular how they did it. They enjoyed unlimited freedom, and their authority was unquestioned; and they held the life of an Indian cheap.\n\n7. Anglo-India To-day\n\n(i) Imperialistic but isolated. The Anglo-Indian of to-day has not that profound contempt for natives which distinguished his countrymen of the post-Mutiny period, nor is he so deliberately ignorant of the language, customs, and history of India and her people. But he is proud of possessing India, and looks upon himself as a great colonizer and a great administrator, whose mission in life is to rule backward eastern countries in the interest of those countries. He lives an isolated life like Anglo-Indians of the past, and is not very liberal in his views. According to Mrs. G. H. Bell, his narrow-mindedness is the result of his very isolation. Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson compared the Anglo-Indian world to an ‘Atlantic liner floating on the Indian World. It has water-tight compartments.’ The Anglo-Indian is cut off from richer minds than his own and does not mix with Indians. Hence he lacks the very breadth of mind upon the possession of which he congratulates himself. Mrs. Barbara Wingfield-Stratford similarly writes in Beryl in India:\n\n‘The whole white community in India was, as a whole, hopelessly narrow-minded, unimaginative, and lacking in dignity.’ (p. 11.)\n\nMrs. Maud Diver, who calls Anglo-India ‘this lively and apparently unthinking world of British India—a world dominated by official personalities, and abbreviations’, thus characterizes her countrymen in India in Desmond’s Daughter:\n\n‘What are they, after all, these Anglo-Indians, and what spell is put upon them by the land of their service, that even their own countrymen deem them almost a race apart? Those that best know them are least ready with a definition: and as for the verdict of the travelled observer, one of the breed dismisses them airily as “a little scattered garrison . . . mute, snobbish, not obviously clever and obviously ill-educated”, stewards of great mysteries who “don’t and won’t understand any race but their own”; while another, seeing a few inches deeper, detects under the surface of muteness and officialism the sturdy self-control, the patient and persistent driving force that have made the country what it is to-day.’ (p. 49.)\n\n(ii) Discriminately hospitable. The Anglo-Indian of today is discriminately hospitable. In times of trouble and need he is prepared to receive under his roof comparative strangers who may have little or nothing in common with him beyond the fact of their being Englishmen. In the early nineteenth century the open-door, indiscriminate hospitality of Anglo-India struck Englishmen as one of their brightest virtues. ‘One of the many lessons,’ says Mrs. Perrin, ‘that the great Mother India instils into the hearts of her white foster children is to sympathise with one another’s troubles and misfortunes, however trivial or however serious.’ However, as time passed, this hospitality began to be less indiscriminate. Mrs. Ross Church (Florence Marryat) in Gup. says that in her time it was a very general complaint in India that the country with regard to its hospitality was not what it used to be. She makes ‘old fellows, with the native cloth trousers sticking close to their legs’, say that when they were boys and utter strangers they were received by everybody with open arms. This shows that in the old days an Englishman was less common and therefore more welcome than he is now, and that under the rule of John Company the Old Indians ‘had a larger quantity of curry and rice wherewith to regale their friends’. According to Mrs. Ross Church, in the post-Mutiny India ‘unquestioning entertainment for man and beast is an impracticable virtue’. It is ‘uncalled-for kindness’ and impossible in a country ‘which is being daily reinforced by employees from every grade of society’. But she does not agree with ‘gentlemen of red and green plaid trousers, that it has entirely vanished’. Mrs. B. M. Croker in her first novel, Proper Pride. (1882), speaks of the proverbial hospitality of the Anglo-Indian. Kipling in the Phantom Rickshaw. thinks that ‘Globe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within living memory, blunted this open-heartedness, but none the less to-day, if you belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep, all houses are open to you’. There are indications that in the India of to-day, with good hotels springing up in the larger cities and dak bungalows in the remotest districts, the virtue of hospitality is not so essential as it necessarily was in the old days. In Mrs. Savi’s Sackcloth and Ashes. (written after the war) Lance Kelly on his arrival in Bengal asks with surprise, ‘Where is the vaunted hospitality of the Anglo-Indians?’\n\n(iii) Its monotony. Anglo-Indian life is monotonous, especially for women. When the novelty of India wears off, the period of disillusionment begins. Banished from all interest or discussions in the affairs of India by civilians and soldiers,\n\n‘not young enough to be content with the same round of amusements and too clever to stagnate, the monotonous routine of her daily existence begins to prey upon her soul. ... Every day was so much like every other day, a ride in the morning, and an idle empty day in the bungalow with nothing in particular to do, but read or sleep, a game of golf or a set of tennis till dark and then a long evening at the club.’ (Y. Endrikar, Gamblers in Happiness, p. 121.)\n\nIn many novels we get a glimpse of the trying monotony of the Englishwoman’s life in India, especially in the hot weather. A penance-like walk for health’s sake in the early morning, with the soul gasping for a breath of fresh air; a late breakfast and no luncheon, struggles to sleep or rest in the afternoon; tea; a drive in the stuffy, still evening, an hour passed under the fans at the club, with papers and magazines and languid conversation, followed by dinner in the garden; a short interval spent in gazing at the stars; and an early going to bed to make up for the early rising—these complete the picture of a normal day in Anglo-India. This monotony is sometimes broken by a moonlight picnic or a dance. Life in the cold weather, and in the larger cities and military cantonments, is a little more varied, but in a small station where the dozen or so of Europeans, who know every line of one another’s faces by heart, and everything about one another’s lives, have to meet at the club daily and listen to petty squabbles and malicious gossip, life is dull.\n\n(iv) Its snobbery. Several writers speak of the snobbery of Anglo-Indians. Mrs. Ross Church writes in Gup,\n\n‘Rupee is the name of the highest god they worship; then ‘rank’ for the women, ‘beauty’ for the men, after which they have no more religion.’ (p. 65.)\n\nMr. Alexander Wilson divides the people of this country into three divisions, ‘sahibs, snobs, and sinners’. This is an apt classification of Anglo-India. Sahibs may be said to represent gentlemen; sinners are gentlemen who have gone wrong; snobs are not gentlemen but pretend to be so. The worship of rank is the worst feature of Anglo-Indian society. ‘The laws of precedence’, writes Norah K. Strange, ‘which govern European society in India are almost as immutable as those of the Medes and Persians.’ Mr. Edward Thompson writes bitterly of the ‘herd ethos’ of the Indian Civil Servants and their contemptuous treatment of all other classes. Mr. Shelland Bradley and several other writers ridicule the desire of Englishmen and Englishwomen to have their names on the Government House list.\n\n(v) Its melancholy. In spite of the intoxication of power Anglo-India is not altogether happy. The English soldier pines for the sights and sounds of London, the mother for her children, the husband for his wife, the toiling official for the opportunities lost, the statesman for contact with minds more cultivated than his own, and the epicure for the joys of the English table. Mr. Oaten calls this longing for home and dissatisfaction with the country of their adoption Anglo-Indian ‘melancholy’. In earlier times, when the conditions of life in India were much harder, this note of melancholy was still more prominent in Anglo-Indian literature than at present. Increased amenities of life, better pay, greater opportunities and facilities for visiting England, have somewhat lessened the intensity of home-sickness, but not altogether removed it. In the fiction of the nineteenth century, from Hockley to Kipling we come across it again and again. Mr. W. D. Arnold it Oakfield. and Sir Charles Lyall in verse voiced it with deep and genuine feeling. Sir Henry Cunningham expresses it in The Cœruleans. Masterly, who was given to talking in a tone of persiflage, becomes at once serious when Lady Miranda refers to Anglo-Indian life as delightfully free.\n\n‘“Yes,” he said; “free as the desert, ‘the desolate freedom of the white jackass,’ freedom from the people you care about, the things you are interested in, the places you love—freedom from everything but what can be tied up in red tape, and put in a despatch box—freedom which is free in the same way that the Roman’s solitude was peace.’” (p. 129.)\n\nIn The Madness of Private Ortheris, Kipling has given expression to it in unforgettable words. Among modern novelists, Mrs. Coulson Kernahan says, in The Woman who Understood,\n\n‘Anglo-Indian life is a sacrifice. It is a series of uprootals. There either a woman separates from her children or leaves her husband. Whichever it is, it is sacrifice. I often wonder if any gain compensates for the loss.’ (p. 156.)\n\nJohn Travers’ (Mrs. G. H. Bell) is full of this note in Sahib-log. She sadly refers to ‘Indian partings and meetings’; she misses in India those ‘people who are in possession of what they love most’; she sighs for the birth of spring in England, and exclaims, ‘How one could weep for the breath and the sound and the sight of it by the waters of Babylon!’ (p. 125.) She knows that India stole much, destroyed much, but gave nothing; and her heart goes out in sympathy for those young wives and mothers whose children are in England, whose husbands are in the plains, and ‘whose homes are baked in the cantonments, dismantled and silent, save for the punkhas’ creaking, empty, but for the sweating soldier men’. According to Mr. Duff-Fyfe India is no place for a white man with slender means and no certain and heaven-born position. He loathes the country and everything connected with it. Sir Francis Younghusband, who was so anxious to ‘liven things’ for English soldiers in India, says that their life ‘without home attractions’ is dreary and depressing. But the most interesting of modern books from this point of view, marked by a deep note of sadness, accentuated by the disquieting conditions of modern political India, is Mr. Edward Thompson’s A Farewell to India. Mr. Thompson’s disappointment is great; as his love for India was great. Alden’s departure from India is the departure of a sincere Christian who had loved India, identified himself with her, was bruised and broken in her service, and yet was discarded by her without a word of gratitude or regret.\n\n(vi) Its conservatism. Among other characteristics of Anglo-Indian fiction we may notice its conservatism. While Anglo-India is very unconventional in some respects, it is strangely conservative in others. Mrs. Savi draws attention to this peculiarity of Anglo-Indian life in The Unattainable. Edwina, the heroine, finds on her arrival from England that the circle in which she moved was ‘correct to the point of weariness’, and did things which ‘their grand-parents had done for generations’; they ‘echoed their views despite the advance of time and evolution’; they worshipped ceremony as a god, treated extremes of fashion as immoral, and freedom of speech as a ‘shocking breach of decorum, amounting to impropriety’, and ‘condemned to perdition all who refused to be hide-bound by custom’. This conservatism and love of ceremony result from their being cut off from the current of ever-changing and constantly moving life at home. They would begin to stagnate like a pool of water cut off from the main stream but for the constant influx of new thought, energy, fashions, and manners brought by new arrivals. Another force that tends to make the Anglo-Indians formal and conservative is their fear that sudden changes in thought, speech, and dress might adversely affect their prestige. English society in most of the stations of Anglo-India is limited to a small number which, on account of official transfers and other changes, is generally in a state of flux. It may be supposed, therefore, that in India an Englishman is free to do what he likes, as no Mrs. Grundy controls his conduct. But considerations of prestige, arising out of his position as a member of the ruling caste, act as powerful brakes on the Anglo-Indian, young or old. The English in India lead a glass-house existence. The minutest details of their lives are known to their servants. These latter talk in the bazaars, and thence the news, magnified, distorted, or exaggerated by imagination or misunderstanding, may reach the remotest corners of India, affording amusement to the elders of a village smoking their hookahs under the pepul tree, the women at the well, and even street urchins engaged in their pastimes and frolics. The fear of losing prestige explains many curious practices of Anglo-India. In some clubs all the windows and doors are closed so that the servants may not see the sahibs dancing. Mrs. Bell does not approve of short skirts and short sleeves, because it ‘horrifies the Indian’. Norah K. Strange says, in Mistress of Ceremonies, ‘what is ordinary and quite harmless in England takes a very different complexion in Eastern eyes’.\n\n‘In England it is no body’s but your husband’s business if you choose to dress up like a harlequin and prance about like an inebriated negro; but in India it’s every decent thinking person’s business to see that his race doesn’t lose prestige in the eyes of a still subject people, who are as ready to magnify flaws as they are to forget past benefits.’ (pp. 118-19.)\n\nMr. Edward Thompson says in Night Falls on Siva’s Hill, that it is not often that Englishmen quarrel in India in the presence of native servants. Considerations of prestige are chiefly responsible for the almost complete exclusion of Indians from English clubs. Such clubs have done more to ‘breed ill-will than any other dozen institutions’. For political reasons some clubs have had to admit Indians of position, but they have done so with a bad grace. Mr. Endrikar refers to an interesting situation that arose in a club which had to admit Indians, because the Governor threatened to resign his membership otherwise. The Indian members were invited to take part in all the events, but when it came to dancing, ‘half the ladies of the station were up in arms at the mere suggestion of dancing with Indians’. In the past it was tacitly understood that none of these Indians would wish to be present at the club dances. But when Ratnaswami casually said that accompanied by a friend he intended to attend the club dance, the Mowlpure Club was taken aback. The exclusiveness of the older clubs is shown by the statement that while they welcomed all Englishmen, ‘prince and philosopher—sweeper and beggarman’, no Indian, even if he were a nawab or maharajah, was eligible for membership. Mr. Talbot Mundy writes in O. that the members of the Delhi Club were proud of the fact that ‘no Indian, not even a Maharajah, has ever set foot over its threshold’.\n\nAnglo-India has several unwritten laws and traditions which may not be violated, except at the risk of incurring its serious displeasure. Anglo-India has definite views on the marriage of its countrymen in India. It does not approve of the marriage of an official at the commencement of his career, and condemns it as ‘an unpardonable piece of stupidity’. Military Anglo-India is still more strict in this respect. Its rule is: ‘A lieutenant can’t marry. A captain mustn’t. A major may if he likes. A colonel ought.’ The tragedy of a wasted life recorded in Mr. Thompson’s Night Falls on Siva’s Hill. is the result of independence shown by one of the Mianis in matrimonial matters. Anglo-India condemns mixed marriages in no uncertain terms. An Englishman who marries an India girl is pitied, and Anglo-India does all it can to prevent such a mésalliance. A romantic English girl who commits the folly of marrying an Indian gentleman is ostracized and regarded as dead by Anglo-India.\n\n(vii) Its calling-hour. The calling-hour of Anglo-India has surprised all newcomers, and makes Anglo-Indian society resemble Cranfordians in this respect. The two hottest hours of the day are selected for paying calls. Sir Henry Cunningham considers this custom ‘idiotic’. He wonders how it arose and that no one has found courage or strength enough to break a custom ‘so detrimental to the health and comfort of mankind’.\n\n‘Like Chinese ladies’ feet, the high heels on which fashionable Europe at present does penance, suttee of Hindu widows, and infanticide among the Rajput nobles, it is merely a curious instance that there is nothing so foolish and so disagreeable that human beings will not do or endure if it only becomes the fashion.’ (Chronicles of Dustypore, p. 47.)\n\nAnother peculiar custom is that it is the new comer who calls first, without waiting to be called on; the call is returned and the new comer is asked out or not, as people see fit. If no such invitation is received the matter ends there. The method of paying calls is simple. You drive to the first house on your list. If the lady is not receiving, the servant will bring a box with the inscription ‘Not at Home’. You simply drop your card and drive on to the next house on the list. If the lady is receiving, the servant brings the lady’s salaams and you have to go in for a few minutes. No call is expected to last for more than five minutes. ‘The funniest part’, writes ‘O. Douglas’ in Olivia in England. (1913), ‘of it is that one may have hundreds of people on one’s visiting list and not know half of them by sight, because of the convenient system of the not-at-home box.’ The etiquette of Anglo-India demands that you should leave as soon as another visitor arrives.\n\n(viii) Its indifference to religion. Meadows Taylor in The Story of My Life. refers to the indifference of his contemporaries to religion. Apart from missionaries, the average Englishman in India to-day calls himself a Christian more for political than other reasons. Church attendance on Sundays is necessary more to show the solidarity of Englishmen in India than to satisfy their spiritual needs. Most of them attend church as they attend parades, that is, under orders. Here is a characteristic passage from Mr. Y. Endrikar’s Gamblers in Happiness, typical of Anglo-India’s attitude towards religion:\n\n‘I go on principle in India to show that I am not ashamed of my religion. I would like to have an order issued that every European officer should attend church every Sunday, if he is in headquarters. In England I confess I take a holiday.’ (p. 155.)\n\nSir Francis Younghusband says in But in Our Lives. that living in India with Hindus and Mohammedans had made him realize that Christianity had never sunk into the very marrow of the bone of an Englishman like Islam and Hinduism into the Indian. Some Anglo-Indians are positively hostile to Christian Churches in India. Miss Bishop says in Wine of Sorrow. that the Government viewed Christianity as a most dangerous innovation, and was loath to expose the Hindu to its contagion. He adds with sorrow that more than one Christian officer ‘bowed down to wood and stones’ to please a native people whom he feared. Mr. L. Beresford believes that if English rule in India is ever finally laid in its coffin, ‘the Church by the tactlessness of its representatives will have assisted to nail down the lid’.\n\n(ix) Its social constitution. In order to understand Anglo-Indian life, it is necessary to understand its peculiar constitution. In Anglo-India most of the women are young and married. The very young girl and the very old lady are absent from it. Young children have to sent to England to be educated there and old ladies accompany their husbands after their retirement. This leaves Anglo-India with girls and wives. Secondly, these ladies have nothing serious to do. They have no ‘domestic responsibilities and occupations’. They have so many servants that there is little they need do themselves. If any enthusiastic mistress of the house desires to do things for herself, she soon finds that it is useless. ‘Cœrulean life is long and the art of Cœrulean house-keeping is extremely short’, says Camilla. Servants are many, living is cheap, the kitchen is unattractive and unhygienic, and the only house-keeping problem of the mem-sahib in India is to keep accounts of dusters or charcoal. Just to pass time, or for the sake of a new sensation, or a little excitement, these women begin to ‘play at being in love’. A third feature of Anglo-Indian life is that its men folk are either very busy or very idle. The Assistant Magistrate, the Civil Surgeon, the Engineer, and the Superintendent of Police are examples of busy people. The young unmarried subaltern, on the other hand, has very little to do. Fourthly, the climate of India separates the toiling husband from the wife, who spends the greater part of the year at one of the hill stations and comes down to the plains only in the cold weather. When we consider in addition the influence of climate and the scarcity of English females in India; the fact that for help and protection in time of trouble and need Englishwomen have to depend upon Englishmen in general; that there is no lack of bachelors making merry away from the discipline of their regiments, and of married men whose wives are in England; and finally that life at hill stations with its round of amusements, dances, dinners, picnics, and balls is gay throughout the year, is it surprising that a society so peculiarly constituted should become a Garden of Eden where the Devil enters to tempt Eve, or that tragedies or comedies of love and marriage should be the most prominent feature of the life of Anglo-India and of Anglo-Indian fiction, whose pages are so full of flirtations and frivolities, scandals and gossip, as to exclude almost everything else? Sir Henry Cunningham in his inimitable manner traces the growth of a woman like Mrs. Vereker, ‘a type of character which Indian life brings into especial prominence, and develops into fuller perfection than is to be found in less artificial communities’. He says:\n\n‘She had come to India while still almost a child, and in a few months, long before thought or feeling had approached maturity, had found herself the belle of a station, and presently a bride. These circumstances separated her frequently from her husband, and she learnt to bear separation heroically. The sweet incense of flattery was for ever rising, and she learnt to love it better every day. Any number of men were for ever ready to throw themselves at her feet and proclaim her adorable; and she came to feel it right that they should do so. She found that she could conjure with her eyes and mouth, and exercise a little despotism by simply using them as Nature told her.’ (Chronicles of Dustypore, pp. 80-1.)\n\nSir Henry Cunningham wrote in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. To show that Anglo-Indian life has not changed in its essential elements since then, we quote the following from The Jungle Girl. by Mr. G. Casserly, whose book was published only a few years ago.\n\n‘Her husband, of course, was as blind as most husbands seem to be in the Anglo-Indian society. For in that land of the Household of Three, the Eternal Triangle, it is almost a recognised principle that every married woman who is at all attractive is entitled to have one particular bachelor always in close attendance on her, to be constantly at her beck and call, to ride with her, to drive her every afternoon to tennis or golf or watch polo, then on to the club and sit with her there. His duty, a pleasant one, no doubt, is to cheer up her otherwise solitary dinner in her bungalow, on the nights when her neglectful husband is dining out en garçon. No Cavaliere Servente of Old Italy ever had so dizzy a time as the Tame Cat of India of to-day.’ (p. 64.)\n\nMrs. Wingfield-Stratford, writing in 1921, thus describes Anglo-Indian life:\n\n‘Once or twice it struck her that the lives of most of the women she met were singularly aimless ones. She was also surprised sometimes at the matter-of-fact way in which somebody’s husband and somebody else’s wife almost invariably paired off together. Every lady in the station, except herself, seemed to have what Mrs. Tukeson knew as a “Boy”, and were surprisingly frank about it.’ (p. 87.)\n\nThe young flirt, after a life of dalliance, wit, flattery, and strife, generally develops into the scandal-mongering wicked lady of the station, presiding over the club, and finding her chief business in life in pulling neighbours to pieces or in chaperoning a young niece. She discusses over her tea-cup the sins of her friends and acquaintances, criticizes other women’s gowns, calculates how much each man earns, and estimates the allowance he makes to his wife. Judging Anglo-Indian life from its pursuits, amusements, and clubs, a new comer is likely ‘to look with horror and loathing upon an existence which appeared to sap all that was best and sweetest out of life, and transformed it into a hideous, grasping, money-making, place-seeking travesty’.\n\n(x) Religion of work. But it would be a mistake to think that the flirt or the gossip represents the whole of Anglo-India. The life depicted in most Anglo-Indian novels is of a trivial character. But the men who govern India possess many sterling virtues, or they would have lost India long ago. Devotion to duty or ‘doing one’s job’, as Mr. Thompson puts it, is the most important of their virtues. It is well illustrated in several novels, though never so clearly or prominently as the life of gaiety and amusements. In The Cœruleans, Camilla found that real India was ‘something very different from that of magazine articles’. She found Anglo-Indians hard at work. ‘The nobility of their task seemed to throw a sort of moral grandeur over their lives that might otherwise have been commonplace and even ignoble in their dullness.’ India is a hard taskmaster. She gives men plenty of opportunities of proving their worth. Novel after novel mentions (incidentally) the whole-hearted devotion of Englishmen to their work. Sylvester of The Price of Empire. and Delahey of the Shadow of Abdul. resemble Henry Lawrence and remind one of the ancient Spartans and Romans. Even Sir Henry Cunningham, who has so mercilessly exposed the faults of Anglo-Indian society, acknowledges that Hannibal’s soldiers did not have to work so hard as the English officials at Elysium. This devotion to work is ‘a new religion’ to the Englishman in India. It grips him as nothing else does. It is a remarkable and pleasing characteristic of Anglo-Indian novelists that while they delight in drawing attention to the follies and imperfections of Anglo-Indians they do not over-emphasize the praiseworthy traits of their character. In the distant outposts of the frontier, in jungles and lonely mofussil stations often far removed from men of their own race, these civilians and soldiers have done their duty for duty’s sake. Mrs. Maud Diver is untiring in her admiration for the Spartan ideals of duty and service that distinguish the lives of her countrymen in India. Another book which embodies this ideal of silent service and worship of work is But in Our Lives. by Sir Francis Younghusband. One finds a subdued echo of the same in Mr. Edward Thompson’s two books, An Indian Day. and A Farewell to India. Hamar, Findlay, and Alden are his heroes; they suffer but do their jobs.\n\n(xi) Anglo-Indian women misrepresented. Anglo-Indian novelists, both men and women, have not done justice to the women of Anglo-India. Even Mr. Thompson is hard on them, and goes so far as to suggest that much of the poisoning of the world’s thinking comes from the idleness and ease of sheltered women, especially young women. Hilda wonders if there is any country where it is so useless and ineffectual to be an Englishwoman as India. This is the feeling of many Englishwomen who are disgusted with the commonplace lives of their sisters in India. Some women writers like Mrs. Maud Diver, Mrs. Alice Perrin, and Mrs. G. H. Bell have attempted to show that the life of Englishwomen in India is not so frivolous as it appears on the surface, and that they also have played their part silently but heroically in making the British Empire what it is. However, it is not Anglo-Indian fiction that gives one the idea of the real contribution of the women of England to the greatness of England. It was left to a poet, Mr. George Essex Evans, to appraise the glorious part played by the women of the West in the expansion of England. For love they faced the wilderness, left the ‘vine-wreathed cottage’ for the ‘slab-built, zinc- roofed homestead’ or ‘huts on new selections’, leaving the ‘pleasures of the city, and the friends they cherished best’.\n\nThe red sun robs their beauty, and, in weariness and pain,\n\nThe slow years steal the nameless grace that never comes again;\n\nAnd there are hours men cannot soothe, and words men cannot say—\n\nThe nearest woman’s face may be a hundred miles away.\n\nFor them no trumpet sounds the call, no poet plies his arts—\n\nThey only hear the beating of their gallant, loving hearts.\n\nBut they have sung with silent lives the song all songs above—\n\nThe holiness of sacrifice, the dignity of love.\n\nThese women of the West, like some flower transplanted to bloom beneath alien skies, make efforts to adapt themselves to their changed environments, and it is no wonder that they wither away. The gaiety of a few seasons does not compensate for the long years of a dreary existence that lie ahead, and if to a new comer India appears a land of never-ending amusements and pleasures, the glamour soon wears off, and even the most frivolous woman is forced to realize the difficulties and responsibilities of her position. Even Mrs. Savi, whose picture of Anglo-India is not flattering, says in one of her novels:\n\n‘What a lot of women are unassuming heroines in private life. One has only to come to the East to discover the stuff there is in us.’ (A Prince of Lovers, p. 125.)\n\nMrs. Perrin writes, in The Happy Hunting-Ground:\n\n‘Generally speaking, the conditions of Indian existence may be said to foster the finest feminine qualities of the Englishwoman, though in some lamentable cases the life may develop the very worst—and then it is the individual, not India, that is to blame.’ (p. 112.)\n\nSir Francis Younghusband divides Englishwomen in India into three classes—those who, losing all womanly grace, become mere copies of men; those who ‘live a hothouse, scented life, and wither and crinkle if a breath of fresh air enters their room’; and finally those whom Sir Francis calls ‘the glory of our race’,\n\n‘have been brought up in rain and sunshine, and have been accustomed to mix with men and women of every rank in life, and to live with animals, and who yet retain every womanly charm.... They are no mere drawing-room orchids: they have the charm and fragrance of the wild rose.’\n\nAnglo-Indian novels have delineated the first two types but generally ignored the third. We should not forget also, that many English wives who are represented as going wrong in India will go wrong anywhere, and that often their foolishness is interpreted as sin by jealous husbands and scandal-mongers. There are few novels in Anglo-Indian fiction more poignant in their pathos than Mrs. Perrin’s The Woman in the Bazaar, showing how the tragedies of Anglo-Indian married life might be averted if the husbands had a little more understanding of the feelings and difficulties of their wives in India, and could learn to look upon their mistakes a little more charitably. If they remembered the prayer of Rafella,\n\nOther refuge have I none;\n\nHangs my helpless soul on Thee;\n\nLeave, ah I leave me not alone;\n\nStill support and comfort me,\n\nmany an English home in India might be happier than it is.\n\nChapter II\n\nMeadows Taylor and Other Predecessors of Kipling\n\n8. Beginnings of Anglo-Indian Fiction\n\nIndia has fascinated Europe since time immemorial. From very early times she has been looked upon as a land of gold and jewels, and of magic and marvels. For many romancers in the Middle Ages, India was a country for the exercise of riotous imagination. Before Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route to India, European knowledge of India was derived from scattered references in the classics or the wild imaginings of the fabulist. The Elizabethan travellers not only described the marvels of India but also drew attention to the ‘great profite’ that was ‘to be made with the commodities of this country’. In Tamburlaine, Marlowe gave expression to that glamour with which the tales of the travellers had invested the East. Cosroe is pained and ‘resolves’ into tears because\n\nMen from the farthest equinoctial line\n\nHave swarmed in troops into the Eastern India,\n\nLading their ships with gold and precious stones,\n\nAnd made their sports from all our provinces. — (Tamburlaine, I. i.)\n\nTamburlaine is not prepared to sell the meanest soldier in his train for ‘All the gold in India’s wealthy arms’. Shakespeare describes the Field of the Cloth of Gold in the following terms:\n\nand tomorrow they\n\nMade Britain India; every man that stood\n\nShow’d like a mine.\n\n— (Henry VIII, I. i.)\n\nIn the seventeenth century, though India was still clothed in the glory of distance and was ‘a grand poetical dream’, she began to lose some of her romance. Sir Thomas Browne speaks of the disadvantages of investment in the East India Company. Evelyn gives a glimpse of the ‘nabob’ of the next century in the pompous East India merchant of his time; so does Dryden in the character of Sir Martin Marall. But it was not till the eighteenth century—till after the victories of Clive—that England began to see something of real India, and the foundations of Anglo-Indian fiction were laid.\n\nThe magnificence and wealth of the Anglo-Indians, their eccentricities and vulgarities, first attracted the attention of the public and writers in England in 1772, the first year of Hastings’s Governor-Generalship, when Foote produced The Nabob, a play picturing the discomfiture of Sir Matthew Mite, a returned Anglo-Indian. In 1773 there appeared a satirical poem, The Nabob, or Asiatic Plunderers. In 1780 was published Intrigues of a Nabob, by N. F. Thompson. About 1785 Mackenzie satirized the nabobs in the person of Mrs. Mushroom. In the same year there appeared a book in four volumes entitled Anna, or Memoirs of a Welsh Heiress, Interspersed with Anecdotes of a Nabob.\n\nThe Disinterested Nabob, a Novel, is mentioned by Mr. R. Sencourt, and may be regarded as the first Anglo-Indian novel so far known. 1789 saw the publication of Hartly House, which, though described as a novel, is ‘the first journal written by a woman for her friends in England’ Sophia Goldborne, an empty-headed English girl, writes an account of her life of magnificence in India to Arabella, whom she pities on account of her humble duties and modest pleasures. Calcutta women are shown as spending four or five thousand pounds over their shopping in a morning. For several years thereafter we have no record of any novel dealing with India. In 1811, Miss Sydney Owenson, later Lady Morgan, published The Missionary, an Indian tale in three volumes. She is the author of English Homes in India. (1828), which depicts the life of Anglo-Indians.\n\n9. W. B. Hockley\n\nMore important than Miss Owenson is the name of W. B. Hockley of the Bombay Civil Service who had, by 1828, published three interesting books of fiction, all dealing with Hindu life: Pandurang Hari: or Memoirs of a Hindoo. (1826), Tales of the Zenana. (1827), and The English in India. (1828). Hockley’s reputation chiefly rests on Pandurang Hari. It purports to be a free translation of an Indian document placed in the author’s hand by a Hindu of the Deccan. Pandurang Hari. is the story of a young adventurer of noble birth, told in the first person. Its importance is not due to its art, which is crude, but to the fact that it served as a model for Meadows Taylor’s more famous book, The Confessions of a Thug.\n\nThe plot of Pandurang Hari is simple. Pandurang Hari (later Prince Jeoba) is found as a deserted orphan by a Mahratta of some consequence and taken care of by him. He learns his first lessons in treachery and corruption there, and narrowly misses being hanged. He next serves in the army of Juswant Rao Holkar who was fighting Scindiah. The author incidentally gives an interesting description of Mahratta forces:\n\n‘Saddles were always slipping off for want of girths; strings, fastened to any old pieces of iron by way of bits, supplied bridles; old turbans served for martingales and tent ropes for cruppers. A most villanous medley of every clumsy shift under the sun was seen on all hands. The infantry were just as wretchedly accoutred as the cavalry; everything was wanting and nothing regular.’ (p. 43.)\n\nAfter the death of his patron and the defeat of Holkar he becomes Gossein at the suggestion of an old impostor Gabbage Gousala who is no other than his treacherous uncle, and is robbed of all he possessed. He then serves as a peon in Bombay, but being implicated in a conspiracy to murder the Topee-Walla treasurer is, by way of punishment, ferried across the water to the Mahratta country. In Bombay Nusroo, a bullock-driver, befriends him. Nusroo’s conception of the East India Company is amusing:\n\n‘He said that according to some accounts he had heard the Company was an old Englishwoman, aunt to the King of the Topee-Wallas, and that she had got so much money as might buy the whole world were she not over-anxious to have our country first.’ (p. 60.)\n\nPandurang’s life, in short, is a series of unfortunate adventures. Very often his plans are upset by his uncle, who did not know that Pandurang was his nephew. More than once he loses his liberty; more than once his life is in danger, but in the end he successfully overcomes all obstacles. He manages to win the hand of Sagoonah, finds his long-lost father, and is recognized as the heir to the Musnud of Sattarah.\n\nPandurang Hari is a poor work of art. Its plot is rambling, the characters are ill-defined, and the series of dramatic coincidences irritating. Yet it is a remarkably faithful sketch of Mahratta life at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The position of the Gosseins, the enormous influence they wielded during the reign of Bajee Rao, their criminal activities, the description of the robbers’ cave, the life and administration of cities like Poona and Sattarah, the position of the English, the political condition of the Deccan, the rivalry of Scindiah and Holkar, the mode of travelling and the dangers of travel on account of Pindarees, thugs, and robbers, are all well and faithfully described.\n\nHockley’s Tales of the Zenana, or A Nawah’s Leisure Hours is in some respects a better book than Pandurang Hari. It is a collection of witty tales which the author had heard from his servants. They are worked up in the style of the Arabian Nights.\n\n10. Scott’s ‘The Surgeon’s Daughter’\n\nContemporaneous with the publication of Hockley’s Tales of the Zenana, Sir Walter Scott, one of the greatest masters of romantic fiction, published his romance The Surgeon’s Daughter. In comparison with Scott’s other well-known novels, it is no better than a cheap melodrama, rambling and ill-constructed. But The Surgeon’s Daughter still deserves close study. It shows how Scott’s imagination was fired by India, ‘the true place for a Scot to thrive in’. In the preface to the book he tells us why he was attracted by India. In India he could find ‘as much shooting and stabbing’ as ever took place in the wilds of the Highlands; there he could find rogues, ‘that gallant caste of adventurers who laid down their consciences at the Cape of Good Hope as they went to India, and forgot to take them up again when they returned’. India also was the land of great exploits where ‘the most wonderful deeds’ were done ‘by the least possible means, that perhaps the annals of the world can afford’. He had read and enjoyed Orme’s History of Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan (1763) and he regarded the European adventurers of the eighteenth century as demigods. The romance of India, ‘the various religious costumes, habits, and manners of the people of Hindostan—the patient Hindoo, the warlike Rajpoot, the haughty Moslemah, the savage and vindictive Malay’, gripped him, and though he had never been to India and knew nothing at all about Indians, he undertook to write this romance of India at the suggestion of some of his friends and relations who had seen India:\n\n‘Like the imitative operatives of Paisley,’ he says, ‘I have composed my shawl by incorporating into the woof a little Thibet wool, which my excellent friend and neighbour, Colonel MacErries, one of the best fellows who ever tried a Highland moor or dived into an Indian jungle, had the goodness to supply me with.’\n\nThe plot of this story is melodramatic. Menie Gray, the beautiful daughter of a Scotch surgeon, is decoyed to India by her treacherous lover, Richard Middlemass, who, in the hope of being made a governor, intends to sell her to Tippoo Sultan, or, in the words of the Swiss adventuress Madame Montreville, to present her to him ‘as a lily from Frangistan to plant within the recesses of the secret garden of his pleasures’. A devoted lover rescues her. The main characters are of the usual type with Scott. Richard Middlemass is all wickedness, as Adam Hartley is all faithfulness. Miss Gray belongs to the usual class of Scott’s heroines—a pink and white maiden without judgement. Haidar Ali is represented as just by perhaps political considerations, but by temperament ‘his blood is as unruly as ever beat under a black skin’. ‘Hakim,’ he says, addressing the faithful Hartley, ‘thou shalt return with the Feringi woman, and with gold to compensate her injuries—Do thou say to thy nation, Hyder Ali acts justly.’\n\nApart from plot and characterization the ‘atmosphere’ of the story deserves attention. In Hillary, Scott paints a type of Indian swaggerer whom he knew well. He was aware of the unscrupulousness of the Company and its servants. The scandals connected with recruitment of servants for the Company and ‘the blazing promises by which India had mesmerized the brains of young Britishers’ find a vivid portraiture in this novel. There are references to Englishmen smoking the hookah, to duels and to the behaviour of ‘the mets and quincepigs’ on an Indiaman who made the voyage of English girls coming to India very uncomfortable by their habit of rude staring. Scott is at his best in describing the splendour of Indian scenery, the strange terror and fascination of our jungles and the blaze of the princely procession as it passed through the bazaars of Seringapatam. The meeting of Prince Tippoo with the Begum is described with Scott’s usual vigour and eye for picturesque details.\n\n11. Dickens and India\n\nUnlike Scott, Dickens was never attracted by India. He was pre-eminently a novelist of London, and was too much of an Englishman to think of India. But even then India had become so important in the nineteenth century that it could not be altogether ignored. In making Jonas Chuzzlewit the secretary of the Anglo-Bengali Disinterested Loan Company, Dickens, like Thackeray, satirizes the formation of bogus companies by means of which many Jonas Chuzzlewits exploited the ignorant. This company was a bogus concern engineered by Tigg Montague and David Crimpie, with a paid capital of ‘a two and as many noughts after it as the printer can get in a line’. It was typical of many fraudulent companies which robbed the public before the introduction of protective legislation. In Dombey and Son there is a reference to the long distance between England and India. Little Paul asks his sister Florence:\n\n‘“Floy, where’s India, where that boy’s friends live?”\n\n“Oh, it’s a long, long distance off.”\n\n“Weeks off?” asked Paul.\n\n“Yes, dear. Many weeks’ journey, night and day.”’ (ch. viii.)\n\nHearing this Paul feels that if Florence went to India, he would die. In Little Dorrit Dickens refers to India as a place where governesses like Miss Wade hoped to have a good time. Miss Wade tells us that her mistress delighted ‘to expatiate on the style in which we were to live in India, and on the establishment we should keep, and the company we should entertain’, when the nephew of the family rose to an important position in India. In David Copperfield learn that the young husband of Betsey Trotwood went to India and there rode an elephant along with a ‘baboon’, which in the opinion of David Copperfield was a mistake for a baboo, or a begum. Jack Malden, the needy and idle cousin of Mrs. Strong, who went to India is looked upon by young David as a modern Sindbad. He is pictured as the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes a mile long.\n\n12. Thackeray and India\n\nThackeray was born in Calcutta and had Anglo-Indian blood in his veins. He remembered the land of his birth and, as is well known, introduced it in his novels. But he has not written any real novel of India, with the exception of a burlesque entitled Some passages in the Life of Major Gahagan, which is now known as The Tremendous Adventures of Major Gahagan (1838). Major Goliah Gahagan, who thinks himself a man of supernatural beauty and extraordinary bravery, relates, quite in the style of the Baron Munchausen, his celebrated Indian adventures which carried his fame even to the ears of Napoleon. Most of the Indian characters in the book are either cruel and cowardly or treacherous. Dowsunt Row Scindiah is represented as a cruel and barbarous chieftain; Zubberdas Khan is ‘a ruthless Afghan soldier’ who put out the eyes of Shah Allum; Ghorum Sang is a treacherous servant of Major Gahagan; and all Indian ladies are horribly ugly and faithless. The Major is a burlesque of those desperate adventurers who, finding England too hot for them, sought the golden sands of the East to repair their fortunes. They were often the refuse of English respectability. With the exception of a reference to Bengal Hurkaru, a newspaper, there is not much local colour. The siege of Futtyghur, where the Major performs prodigies of valour, is introduced only to illustrate the supernormal prowess of that gallant officer. The nature of a burlesque requires some amount of exaggeration, but Thackeray, who has given to English literature its greatest burlesque in Rebecca and Rowena, here shocks the reader by the very grotesqueness of his characters and situations.\n\nIn his famous English novels Vanity Fair, The Newcomes, and Pendennis, Thackeray has created a few Anglo-Indian characters who even to this day remain as models for Anglo-Indian writers to copy. Joseph Sedley, the fat and vain Collector of Boggley Wollah—‘a fine, lonely, marshy, jungly district, famous for snipe-shooting and where not unfrequently you may flush a tiger’—is a skit on Indian civil servants of the days of Barwell and Holwell. Though Sedley ran away from Brussels while the battle of Waterloo was raging, he boasts of his bravery on his return to India and is dubbed Waterloo Sedley. Colonel Jack Altamont, a man with very black hair and whiskers, with twinkling eyelashes, and a thousand wrinkles in his red-coloured face, is a representative of the unscrupulous adventurers of the early days of the East India Company. He is an escaped convict who had been sentenced to transportation for forging his father-in-law’s name. He pretends to be a Colonel in the service of the Nawab of Lucknow and lives partly on his gains at the gaming table and partly on money which he obtains by blackmail. James Binnie is a sympathetic portrait of an Indian civil servant who retires after twenty-two years’ service. He is unlike the nabob of books and tradition’ who, Thackeray tells us, is no longer to be found:\n\n‘He is neither as wealthy nor as wicked as the jaundiced monster of romances and comedies, who purchases the estates of broken-down English gentlemen, with rupees tortured out of bleeding rajahs, who smokes a hookah in public and in private carries about a guilty conscience, diamonds of untold value, and a diseased liver; who has a vulgar wife, with a retinue of black servants whom she maltreats, and a gentle son and daughter with good impulses and an imperfect education, desirous to amend their own and their parents’ lives.’ (The Newcomes, ch. viii.)\n\nThe only Indian character in Thackeray’s novels who deserves mention is Rummun Loll. He is a rich merchant of low origin and doubtful honesty. In England he passes as His Excellency Rummun Loll, otherwise his Highness Rummun Loll, the chief proprietor of the Diamond Mines at Golconda, with a claim of three millions and a half upon the East India Company. He smokes his hookah and to please him many English gentlemen make themselves sick by pulling at it. Doctor McGuffog, Thackeray humorously notes, had puffed his hookah ‘in the hope of converting His Highness’, till he was as ‘black in the face as the interesting Indian’. Rummun Loll keeps betel leaves in a silver box. He is lionized by Englishmen and Englishwomen who, crowding round him and ‘snuggling’ up to his India-rubber face, listen to him ‘as eagerly as Desdemona listened to Othello’. Colonel Newcome, the beau ideal of a gentleman, cannot conceal his contempt for the so-called prince and treats him with scant courtesy. To him, he is ‘a fellow who wouldn’t sit down in an officer’s presence’ in India, though later on the gallant Colonel is prepared to become a Director of the Bundelcund Bank, and invest therein the greater part of his fortune.\n\nThese portraits are drawn by Thackeray in the exuberance of his creative power. They are in most cases mere caricatures, but they show what he could have done for India had he, like Kipling, returned to the land of his birth in his youth. Thackeray left India as a child, and whatever he learnt later about India was from his relations or from books. His genius uses this derived knowledge for purposes of art, but second-hand information cannot take the place of real experience, particularly in dealing with an Eastern country like India.\n\nA vivid picture of India about the beginning of the eighteenth century can be formed even from scattered passages in The Newcomes and Vanity Fair. The voyage from India to England, which took eight months when Clive Newcome’s mother went to Bengal, took only ‘four months and eleven days’ when Clive Newcome returned to England. Colonel Newcome is loved by his poor relations for his generosity and his presents which comprise ‘shawls, ivory chessmen, scented sandalwood workboxes and kincob scarfs’. He is very rich and has ‘fifty servants’. But he himself lives ‘as frugally as a Hindoo’. Thackeray is familiar with an Indian Brahmin’s house and recollects ‘the punkahs and the purdahs and tattys, and the pretty brown maidens with great eyes, and great nose-rings, and painted foreheads, and slim waists cased in cashmere shawls, kincob scarfs, curly slippers, gilt trousers, precious anklets and bangles’, and reveals the mystery of Eastern existence (as understood by him) in the early part of the nineteenth century. He has not only tried to catch the magic of eastern existence, but he is fully conscious of the pathos that lies below the story of the British conquest of India. ‘Besides the splendour and conquest, the wealth and glory, the crowned ambition, the conquered danger’ that fill official history, ‘should not’, asks Thackeray, ‘one remember the tears too?’\n\n‘Besides the lives of myriads of British men, conquering on a hundred fields, from Plassy to Meeanee, and bathing them cruore nostro: think of the women, and the tribute which they perforce must pay to those victorious achievements. Scarce a soldier goes to yonder shores but leaves a home and grief in it behind him. The lords of the subject province find wives there: but their children cannot live on the soil. The parents bring their children to the shore, and part from them. The family must be broken up. Keep the flowers of your home beyond a certain time, and the sickening buds wither and die. In America it is from the breast of a poor slave that a child is taken; in India it is from the wife, and from under the palace, of a splendid proconsul.’ (The Newcomes, ch. v.)\n\nIn passages like the following Thackeray also gives us a glimpse of the humorous side of Anglo-Indian life. He knows that there is no part of the world where ladies are more fascinating than in British India.\n\n‘Perhaps the warmth of the sun kindles flames in the hearts of both sexes which would probably beat quite coolly in their native air; else why should Miss Brown be engaged ten days after landing at Calcutta? or why should Miss Smith have half a dozen proposals before she has been a week at the Station. And it is not only bachelors on whom the young ladies confer their affections; they will take widowers without any difficulty.’ (The Newcomes, ch. v.)\n\nIn Vanity Fair we are told that Glorvina had flirted all the way to Madras with the captain and chief mate of the Ramchunder East Indiaman and, undismayed by forty or fifty previous defeats, she laid siege to the heart of Major Dobbin. ‘She sang Irish melodies at him unceasingly.’ She asked him frequently and pathetically, ‘Will ye come to the bower?’ Of course Dobbin did not go to the bower, but ‘he went on riding with her and copying music and playing at chess with her submissively’. ‘For’, adds Thackeray, ‘it is with these simple amusements that some officers in India are accustomed to while away their leisure moments; while others of a less domestic turn hunt hogs, and shoot snipes, or gamble and smoke cheroots, and betake themselves to brandy-and-water.’\n\n13. Meadows Taylor\n\nThackeray is not an Anglo-Indian novelist of any outstanding merit. The most important writer of the pre-Kipling period in the history of Anglo-Indian fiction is undoubtedly Colonel Meadows Taylor. Himself a romantic figure, he had ample opportunities of coming into close contact with native life and manners at the impressionable age of fifteen. He was a diligent student of the Persian, Mahratti, and Hindustani languages. Hindustani he could speak, he says in the Story of My Life, ‘like a gentleman’. Very few Englishmen in India would understand this remark, as the Hindustani they learn to speak is often the vulgar Hindustani of illiterate servants or low-class people. Delhi, Lucknow, and Hyderabad (Deccan) are the three centres where Hindustani as gentlemen are supposed to speak it, may be learnt, and Taylor was fortunate enough to secure a commission in the army of the Nizam at Hyderabad through the agency of Sir Charles Metcalfe. Though his romances are written in English, he often reproduces in them the flavour of cultured Indian conversation by using proper forms of address and oriental modes of expression. He enjoyed his life in Hyderabad and was fond of mixing with the local gentry. ‘I was often asked’, he says in his autobiography, ‘to sit down with them, while their carpets were spread and their attendants brought hookahs.’ The result of this free intercourse with Indian gentlemen was that he got an insight into Indian life such as is shown by few other writers.\n\nMeadows Taylor visited England in 1858, just after his recovery from a severe illness in India. The whole journey through Persia, Arabia, and other countries took about nine months. This visit is important because it was in England that he published his first famous book, Confessions of a Thug (1839), which laid the foundation of his literary career and brought him into public notice. The suggestion to write the Confessions came from Sir Edward Bulwer.\n\n‘He sent me word,’ says Taylor in his autobiography, ‘that had he possessed any local knowledge of India or its people, he would write a romance on the subject; why did I not do so? I pondered over this advice, and hence my novel, “Confessions of a Thug”.’ (The Story of My Life, p. 73.)\n\nThe subject of Thuggee had always fascinated him. He had given much time to its study and speaks of it as ‘the offspring of fatalism and superstition, cherished and perfected by the wildest excitement that ever urged human beings to deeds at which humanity shudders’. He had assisted Colonel Sleeman in his investigations and the disclosures of Colonel Sleeman in 1832 had startled the whole civilized world. The Confessions appeared at an opportune moment and Meadows Taylor suddenly found himself famous.\n\nThis book stands apart from the rest of his work, not only in the nature of its subject, but also in the manner of its narration. Its art is the result of its apparent artlessness. It is a simple tale of what actually happened as told by one of the exponents of Thuggee himself, vitalized by great force of imagination and vividness of description. Ameer Ali, the central figure of the book, was a real Thug examined by Meadows Taylor. His Confessions were startling, ‘a strange and horrible page in the varied record of humanity’. Taylor lets him speak, apparently fascinated by the remarkable man, the perpetrator of hundreds of murders, who thinks of his past deeds with pleasure and satisfaction; who glories in describing the minutest particulars of his victims and his share in their destruction. Ameer Ah is a ‘Bhula Admee’, a ‘most devout man in his life and conduct’, who has said nimaz five times a day from his youth. Withal he is a murderer, one\n\n‘before whom every murderer of the known world, in times past or present, except perhaps some of his own profession—the free bands of Germany, the Lanzknechts, the Banditti, the Condottieri of Italy, the Buccaneers and Pirates, and in our own time the fraternity of Burkes and Hares (a degenerate system of Thuggee, by the by, at which Ameer Ah . . . laughed heartily, and said they were sad bunglers)—must be counted men of small account.’ (Confessions, p. 264.)\n\nAmeer Ah is essentially human. He loves fine dresses and good food, the excitement of war, and adventure. He is a passionate lover, a devoted son and a loving father, whose only regret is that having some seven hundred and nineteen murders to his credit he did not reach four figures. He admires Cheetoo, ‘a fine looking man and a gallant leader’. He is proud of having been received by him as a sirdar. He praises his justice and his horsemanship and knows how to flatter him.\n\nThe Confessions is a book by itself and has no connexion with the several novels that followed it. In the Confessions Meadows Taylor showed himself as a great realistic painter of Thuggee; in the novels that follow he is the chronicler of the romance of Indian history. His Tippoo Sultan, published in 1840, is the first of the historical romances that have made his name famous as the Scott of India. His romances show the influence of the great master. He learnt the art of re-creating the past in the school of Scott who, as we have seen, has himself described the pageantry and picturesqueness of the gorgeous East in The Surgeon’s Daughter. Tippoo Sultan may be said to be a continuation of The Surgeon’s Daughter, not only historically but artistically. The method is the same—the mingling of the real with the ideal human type against a highly romantic background. The difference is due to Scott’s unfamiliarity with India and Indians. Meadows Taylor knows his India as very few writers had known her before him. Naturally there is more of India in Tippoo Sultan than in The Surgeon’s Daughter. Scott selects that period of the history of Mysore when Haidar Ali was still living; Meadows Taylor deals with the period subsequent to Haidar Ali’s death. Scott knows the president of the council at Madras, ‘an able and active but unconscientious man’, who carried on mysterious intrigues with the natives through his Dubash, the notorious Paupiah; he also knows the beautiful adventuress, the Begum Montrevills. But he does not know any Indian except Barak-el-Hadij, who is slightly drawn. Scott’s imagination can help him to conjure up Indian scenes but not Indian characters. Scott has no character to show like Abdul Rhyman Khan, the knightly Mussulman noble who, having two wives living, marries a third, the beautiful Ameena. Nor has Scott any such scenes, peculiarly Indian, like the crossing of the Toombuddra at night or the reception of Ameena by the two wives of the Khan, Kummoobee and Hurmutbee. Scott easily surpasses Taylor in the description of scenes like the Sultan’s Durbar, or the movement of armies and the clash of arms, but the intimate knowledge of the zenankhana of a Mohammedan nobleman of the eighteenth century is obviously the result of experience gained on the spot. The old Khan is thus greeted by his two wives when they learn that he has got a third:\n\n‘“Ill-conditioned!” cried Kummoobee, “Alla, Alla, a man who has no shame—a man who is perjured—a man, who is less than a man, a poor, pitiful, unblest coward! Yes,” she exclaimed, her voice rising with her passion as she proceeded, “a namurd! a fellow who has not the spirit of a flea, to dare to come into the presence of women who, Inshalla! are daughters of men of family! to dare to approach us, and tell us that he has come, and brought with him a vile woman—an unchaste.”’ (vol. i, p. 295.)\n\nHerbert Compton and Casim Ali are idealized types of English and Indian heroes. Jaffur is the typical scoundrel of romance and has his counterpart in Paupiah.\n\nIn the imaginative representation of historical events Meadows Taylor is an imitator of Scott. His description of the attack on Travancore by Tippoo is a masterpiece. The portrait of the ‘Tiger of Mysore’ is on conventional lines. He is represented as a ‘savage and merciless’ man, who delights in spearing bulls, and in smearing the face of the Brahmins with bull’s blood.\n\n‘Sometimes he uttered the noblest and loftiest sentiments of honour—again some frivolous or ridiculous idea would get possession of his imagination and drive him into the commission of a thousand absurdities and terrible cruelties. It was no uncommon thing to see beyond the precincts of the camp a row of miserable Hindoos hanging upon trees, who had defied the Sultan’s efforts at conversion, and had preferred death rather than change the religion of their fathers.’\n\nTara is the most ambitious of Meadows Taylor’s works and the first of that group of historical novels which constitute his famous trilogy. It is his greatest book excepting the Confessions. How it was begun and planned is described by the author himself in The Story of My Life.\n\n‘The incidents and actions of the story had been planned for nearly twenty years; and I knew all the scenes and localities described, as I had the story in my mind during my visit to Beejapoor and had noted the details accurately; while my long residence in an entirely native State, and my intimate acquaintance with the people, their manners, habits, and social organization, gave me opportunities, which I think few Englishmen have ever enjoyed, of thoroughly understanding native life.’ (vol. ii, pp. 358-9.)\n\nTara was published in 1863, though planned twenty years before. The result of this careful planning is seen in the symmetry of its plot-structure. Tara, the widowed daughter of Vyas Shastri and his wife Anunda,is dedicated to the goddess Kali. She is carried off by Moro Trimmul and rescued by Fazil, the gallant son of chivalrous Afzool Khan, at the desecration of the temple at Tuljapoor. After the treacherous murder of Afzool Khan by Shivaji, Tara again falls into the clutches of Moro Trimmul. In order to save her honour she declares herself sati, but is saved in the nick of time by Fazil and his followers who carry her off, slaying Moro Trimmul. Tara is then married to Fazil.\n\nThis is the bare outline of the main plot. But the book is full of fascinating scenes, idealized men and women and romantic situations. Meadows Taylor displays a wonderful knowledge of the domestic life of Hindus and Mohammedans. Anunda is a noble type of Hindu lady, as Lurlee Khanum is a noble type of Moslem lady. Zyna, the sister of Fazil, is beautifully drawn. The variety of characters is amazing. The sleek, avaricious Tulsi Dass is an unscrupulous scribe at the Mogul court; Pahar Singh represents the independent freebooters of the time, combining in his person qualities of extreme daring and cruelty; Moro Trimmul combines the functions of a priest and spy. He is the villain of the piece. Ali Adil Shah, the chivalrous King of Bijapur, Shivaji, regarded with superstitious awe by his followers, and Afzool Khan are the chief historical figures of the novel. Both as giving the political history of the time and as a picture of the life of the period Tara will long hold a high position among Indian historical romances.\n\nRalph Darnell deals with the rise of British power in India and Clive’s famous victory of Plassey. The plot, which is partly laid in England and partly in India, is simple. A gambling, drinking nephew of an English baronet, with the suspicion of illegitimacy hanging around him and disappointed in love, is abducted to India—the happy hunting-ground of political adventurers and a dumping-ground for all undesirable relations. Ralph Darnell not only distinguishes himself in the accepted style of English heroes, but like Esmond succeeds in clearing the mystery of his birth and obtaining the certificate of his mother’s marriage. In this novel Meadows Taylor shows the influence of Thackeray to a marked degree. Ralph Darnell is a combination of the characters of Esmond, Pendennis, and Colonel Newcome. Shuja-ud-Dowla, ‘a weak, sensual youth’, is the wicked nawab of history. In the career of the Afghan orphan, Sozun, the novelist provides some elements of romance. The book throws some light on the life of Englishmen in India in the eighteenth century when ‘the sudden transmission of an obnoxious relative to His Majesty’s plantations in Virginia, or to a friend in Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay was by no means uncommon’. Ralph, who was not squeamish, found in the English society of Calcutta ‘harder drinking, coarser swearing and deeper play than he had been accustomed to, and a general tone of profligacy, which belonged to a lower grade of society as it were’.\n\nSeeta is the third novel of the famous trilogy. Behind the romantic marriage of the beautiful Hindu widow to Cyril Brandon, the Collector of Noorpoor, we listen to the distant rumblings of the Mutiny of 1857. Seeta is a creation of romance; her very faithfulness and devotion to the religion of her forefathers would make her marriage to Brandon improbable in real life. Further, Aunt Ella, a hide-bound Hindu widow, not only tolerates but actually helps in the love-intrigue. Aunts of her type would rather see their daughters or nieces dead than married to a Christian. Allowing for this fundamental error, the character of Seeta is that of an idealized Hindu wife, a copy of the character of her namesake of the Ramayana which it is the ambition of every Hindu lady to imitate. She dies saving her lord and husband, and she dies a Hindu in spite of her marriage to a Christian and the ‘good seed’ that Mrs. Pratt, the missionary, had sown in her soul. ‘There is good seed sown, my dear,’ says Mrs. Pratt to Grace one day, ‘and it must germinate and grow: and I shall be much mistaken if it does not. I am no match for her in metaphysics.’ Meadows Taylor is much too anxious to see the ‘good seed’ germinate, and he regards Seeta as only a type of thousands and thousands of her countrymen and countrywomen who feel the truth of Christianity and are afraid of taking the ‘final plunge’. The real interest of the book does not lie in characterization (though Azarael Pande is a notable character) or in the picture of the Mutiny, but in the attitude of English men and women towards this marriage and in the ‘spicy detail of male and female doings and sayings’ of this period.\n\nSeeta is inferior to Tara in breadth of canvas as well as in general consistency and vigour of conception. But it contains many passages of singular power and beauty. The first chapter describing the ‘weird conclave of dakaits with all its eerie surroundings’ is written in the author’s best style. Obviously Meadows Taylor knows his robbers and their haunts as well as he knows himself. The account of a robbery committed in the house of Haree Dass, and Seeta’s visit to the Cow’s Mouth, are good examples of his descriptive power.\n\nIn Tara Meadows Taylor is at the height of his powers. Ralph Darnell and Seeta show signs of exhaustion.\n\nA Noble Queen is the last of the historical novels of Meadows Taylor. It describes the court-life and heroic career of the noble queen, Chand Bibi, who reigned in the sixteenth century. The character of Don Diego, the Portuguese priest and adventurer, is carefully drawn, and the same idealism that characterizes Taylor’s other books finds expression in this also.\n\nMeadows Taylor is one of those few writers who have tried to depict India as she is. Before him the European conception of the East in general and of India in particular, as illustrated in literature, was extremely vague and often extravagantly ludicrous. Beckford’s Vathek, Southey’s Love of Kama, Moore’s Lalla Rookh are instances in point. ‘The orient of these writers’, as Professor Dunn has said, ‘was no more eastern, than was Horace Walpole’s residence at Strawbury Hill a Gothic structure.’ Before Meadows Taylor, as we have seen, W. B. Hockley tried to give a realistic picture of India in his two novels Pandurang Hari and Tales of the Zenana. Meadows Taylor in his preface to the Confessions acknowledges the merits of Hockley’s work. He belongs to the school of Hockley and Morier in his first book. In his later books the tendency to idealism and romance is more prominent. The realism that is such a prominent feature of the Confessions is confined to minor characters and presentation of Indian manners and customs in his historical romances.\n\nIt will always be a matter of controversy as to which of the two classes of stories—the realistic Confessions, or the idealistic romances—is better. It is often a matter of taste. Some like realism, others romance. According to Professor Oaten the fame of Meadows Taylor rests ‘not on the Confessions of a Thug, which, though it first brought him fame, stands entirely apart from the rest of his work, but upon the series of splendid historical tales which he subsequently wrote’. Mr. Sencourt, on the other hand, preferring the Confessions, says: ‘A certain conventionality of romantic style, a tendency to false effects, and an incapacity to make adventure really exciting or absorbing, prevent these works from reaching the level of the Confessions of a Thug, which is simply a record of fact filled in by imagination and description till it attains the vividness of life.’ It will be clear even to a casual student that artistically Taylor’s historical romances are inferior to the Confessions. The plot of the romances is generally loose and leisurely and characterization is idealized at the cost of truth. Such beautiful and virtuous women as Tara and Seeta have always existed in India, but they would not have behaved as they did, particularly in the age to which they belonged. Tara, who is dedicated to Kali and who offers to become sati, may wed a Mohammedan gallant who saves her. But such marriages are not common. The effect is as bad as it would be if Scott were to marry Rebecca to Ivanhoe. The marriage of Seeta to Cyril Brandon is still more improbable. Seeta is a Hindu widow and very religious. If Tara’s marriage is improbable, Seeta’s is almost impossible. Our objection to this marriage is not like that of the English reviewers who object to mixed marriages on grounds of prestige. Our objection is on the ground of improbability.\n\n14. Other Novelists, 1834-53\n\nThe novels of Anglo-Indian life written during 1834-53 generally aim at depicting not so much Indian as Anglo-Indian society. A novel published anonymously in 1834, and entitled The Baboo and Other Tales combines a satire on the baboo with a vivid description of the society and manners of Englishmen in Calcutta. A writer in the Calcutta Review, 1908, attributes it to Mr. Augustus Prinsep.
