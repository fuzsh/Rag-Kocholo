The document discusses the six poisonous snake species found in Uganda:\n\n1. The puff adder is a strong, aggressive snake found on the ground that bites hard and causes heavy bleeding and tissue destruction. \n\n2. The Gaboon viper is slow and unaggressive but produces large quantities of venom and does not release after biting, causing similar symptoms to the puff adder.  \n\n3. Jameson's mamba is a rare, shy tree snake whose bite causes neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness.\n\n4. Black mambas are very rare in Uganda and have a powerful, unpredictable bite that can reach knee height.",
