Kilkenny cats, said to have fought so furiously and fiercely that the con¬ test ended in leaving only their tails; applied to any munici¬ pal or personal combatants who are grievously injured without benefit accruing to either. CAT [Lat. catus]: name sometimes extended to the whole family of quadrupeds designated by zoologists Felidce (q.v.) genus Felis of Linnaeus; sometimes more re- strictedly applied to a section of that family, containing a number of its smallest species, the domestic cat and spe¬ cies most nearly allied to it. These are the subject of the present article. They all pursue their prey on the branch¬ es of trees, many of them there more than on the ground, and are most expert climbers. CAT. The origin of the domestic cat is not ascertained; and by some naturalists it is described as a distinct species, under the name Felis domestica , at least a convenient provisional designation, until satisfactory reasons appear for referring it to some species existing in a wild state. By many, in¬ deed, the domestic cat has been confidently pronounced to be a mere domesticated variety of the common wild cat. (Felis Catus ) of Europe and n. Asia; but to this there are many objections, the most important being that it is al¬ ways smaller, contrary to the usually-observed effect of do¬ mestication in animals; and that in cats of the domesti¬ cated race which have run wild, and in their known progeny, there is no appearance whatever of a tendency to return to the type of the true wild cat. — Another opinion as to the origin of the domestic cat has obtained the assent of a considerable number of naturalists; that it is derived from the Felis maniculata, or Gloved Cat of n. Africa, a species discovered by the celebrated traveller Riippell. But Mr. Owen has stated a perfectly conclusive reason against identifying the domestic cat with the Felis mani¬ culata, that the first deciduous molar tooth in the latter has relatively thicker crown, and is supported by three roots, while the corresponding tooth both of the domestic cat and of the wild cat of Europe has a thinner crown, and only two roots. The certainty, however, that the cat existed as a domes¬ tic animal in ancient Egypt, indicates that its original is probably to be sought on the banks of the Nile, or in some of the countries from which the ancient Egyptians might most readily have obtained it. Of its rarity in Britain in former times, when the wild cat was common in all the woods which covered so much of the island, a curious evidence is afforded by a Welsh law quoted by Pennant — a law of the reign of Howel the Good (died a.d. 938)— fixing the prices of cats according to their age and quali¬ ties, beginning with a price for a kitten before it could see, and enacting that if any one stole or killed the cat that guarded the prince’s granary, he was to forfeit a milk ewe, its fleece and lamb; or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by its tail, the head touching the floor, would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of the tail. The domestic cat has distinctive characteristics which are well-known: its purring, its mewing, and the other sounds which it makes, its aversion to wet its feet or fur, its love of heat and comfort, its stealthy manners when in quest of prey, its patient watchfulness, often fatal to mice, and other points of its natural history. The delight which a cat takes in tormenting a mouse before killing it has sometimes been mentioned as an ap¬ parent exception to the general character of goodness manifest in the instincts of animals. It is noticeable, however, and when the prey is a bird instead of a mouse, a cat immediately inflicts ° mortal wound, as if aware of its greater power of escape 1. Manx. 2. Brown Tabby. S. Smoke Persian. 4. Silver Tabby. 5. White Persian. 6. Shaded Silver. CAT. The eye of the cat is capable of much contraction and dilatation of its pupil, so that the animal can see in a very feeble light, and is thus adapted for nocturnal habits, to which it shows strong tendency. The fur of the cat is very free from any oily substance, so as to be readily injured by water, and is capable of be¬ ing rendered highly electric by friction, particularly in very dry or frosty weather. An electric spark is readily obtained from the tip of the ear. The strong statements of Buffon gave for a time cur¬ rency to the opinion that the cat is incapable of affection, and retains, even in a domesticated state, its ferocity, merely restrained by selfishness, and disguised by cun¬ ning. The belief is very prevalent that the cat forms an attachment to places only, and not to persons. There are, however, many well-authenticated instances in which the cat has shown a strong attachment to its master or mistress, though this quality is far less frequently and remarkably displayed than by the dog. The recorded instances of the cat’s attachment to places, are worthy of attention in con¬ nection with the subject of instinct in animals. Some of these instances of cats finding their way back from great distances to their former home are very wonderful, and indeed cannot be explained on any grounds or principles known. The same instinct and power, however, are dis¬ played by some other animals. The varieties of the domestic cat are neither numerous nor very different. The Tortoise-shell cat differs from the most common variety chiefly in color, though it is also particularly elegant and delicate in form. It is much more common in s. Europe than in Britain. The Angora cat is a beautiful variety, remarkable for long silky hair. — The Chinese cat has a fine glossy fur, and is remarkable for pendulous ears. The Chartreuse is of bluish color. It is supposed that the Tabby may have undergone less change by domestication than any other variety. The wild cat is still found in a few of the woods of the n. of England, in the mountains of Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, and some parts of Ireland. It has entirely disappeared from districts where it was once common. It is the only beast of prey remaining in Britain the strength and fierceness of which make it at all dangerous to man; but an encounter with a wild cat is safe only to a man well armed. Fortunately, the instances of its attacking when unmolested are rare, but such instances have occurred. The wild cat is an inhabitant of deep thickets and recesses of woods and of the rocky and bushy ravines of mountain¬ ous districts. Its fur, which is soft, long, and thick, is held in considerable estimation. The color of the face is yellowish-gray, with a band of black spots toward the muzzle; the forehead is brown; the head is gray, with two black stripes passing from the eyes, over and behind the ears; the back, sides, and limbs are gray, darker on the back, paler on the sides, with a blackish longitudinal stripe along the middle of the back, and numerous paler CAT curved ones on the sides; the tail is ringed with light-gray and black, the tip being black. The length of a medium- sized male wild cat is almost two ft., exclusive of the tail but this length is sometimes considerably exceeded. The animal often called wild cat in America is the bay lynx: see Lynx. See Mivart, The Cat (1881). Superstitions regarding cats. — Cats have been objects of superstition from the earliest ages In Egypt, they were held in highest reverence; temples were erected in their honor; sacrifices and devotions were offered to them; and it was customary for the family in whose house a cat died to shave their eyebrows. In the middle ages they were regarded as the familiars of witches The favorite shape of Satan was said to be that of a black cat, and the animal was an object of dread instead of veneration There is or was a belief among sailors, that the frolics of a cat at sea portended a storm. Many people still prophecy rainy weather from a cat washing its face; and a cat-call on the Wild Cat- house-top was formerly held to signify death. Their sup¬ posititious connection with witches, and the foolish belief that a cat had nine lives, have led to the perpetration of great cruelties upon them. CAT, on Shipboard: name for many of the ropes or lines. Cat-fall is a rope for heaving up the anchor from the water’s level to the bow; it works through cat-blocks, and is connected with the cat-head. Cat-harpings are small ropes for tightening the shrouds. Cat-heads, just named, are two strong, short timbers projecting from the bow, on each side of the bowsprit. Cat-hook is the fastening for the ring of the anchor to the cat-block. Cat- rope is a line for hauling the cat-hook about; the Cat-back- rope hauls the block to the ring of the anchor in order to hook it. Cat, v. to bring up to the cat-head. Cat-beam, or Beakhead-beam is the broadest beam in the ship, gen¬ erally made of two beams tabled and bolted together. Cat- holes in a ship are two little holes astern above the gun¬ room ports, through which the cable or hawser passes to 1. 5. 6. White Persian. Silver Persian. Short Hair Tortoise Shell. 4. Siamese. 2. Light Silver. 3. Cream Persian. ' CAT— CATACHRESIS. the capstan. Cat-rig, a rig which in smooth water sur¬ passes every other, but unsuited for sea or heavy weather. CAT, or Cat-castle, in the military engineering of the middle ages, a kind of movable tower to cover the sap¬ pers as they advanced to a besieged place. The garrison sometimes poured down burning pitch and boiling oil from the walls upon the cat; but occasionally this strat¬ agem was disastrous, for the besiegers availed themselves of the blazing tower to bum the wooden gates of the town or fortress. CATA, kfit'a [Gr.]: a prefix signifying, down; against; opposition or contrariety; completeness; intensity. CATABASION, n. kdt-d-ba' zhun [Gr. katabasion — from kata, down, and basis, a going] : a chamber or crypt under a church, where relics are kept. CATABOLISM, n. kdt-ab' o-lizm [Gr. kata, down; ballo, to throw]: the process by which living matter, within an organism, is broken down into simpler products. Cata¬ bolic, a. : pertaining to catabolism. CATABROSA, kat-a-bro'sa [Gr. catabrosis, a gnawing]: genus of grasses formerly included in Aira (see Hair- grass), but distinguished by the leathery paleos, which are ribbed, truncated, erose (as if gnawed at the points), awnless, and nearly equal. The glumes are much shorter than the spikelets, membranaceous, and very obtuse. The general appearance is different from that of the genus Aira. — Catabrosa aquatica is of wTide geographic and climatic range, being found throughout Europe, from Lapland to the Mediterranean, and in the torrid regions of South Amer¬ ica. It grows only in very moist situations, as the muddy margins of lakes and rivers, ditches, etc. and is cultivated only in irrigated meadows, or on the banks of rivers sub¬ ject to overflow by high tides, where the ground is always wet and muddy. It is one of the most valuable grasses for such situations, its foliage being peculiarly sweet, and much relished by cattle. Both its foliage and its seeds afford much food to water-fowl, and to some kinds of fish, particularly carp. Its leaves often float, and its stalks seldom rise more than a foot or fifteen inches above the surface of the water. It has a stiff branching panicle ; with whorled spreading branches, and its seeds are small. When its artificial propagation is attempted it is by dropping freshly gathered stems into still waters, or scattering them on the mud, more frequently than by sowing the seeds. It is called sometimes Whorl Grass, sometimes Sweet Water Grass. CATACAUSTICS, n. plu. kdt'd-kaws'tiks [Gr. kata, against; kaustikos, burning]: in opt., the curves formed by the reflection of the rays of light. Cat'acaus'tic, n. a particular curve formed by reflection: Adj. pertaining to. CATACHRESIS, n. kdt'a-kre'sis [Gr. katachresis, mis¬ use, abuse]: in rhet., an abuse of a trope or of words; the use of a word in a sense different from its own. Cat'- CATACLYSM— CATACOMB. achres'tic, a. -kres'tXk, or Cat'achres'tical, a. -tl-k&l, forced; far-fetched. Cat'achres'tically, ad. -IX. CATACLYSM, n. kdt'd-kUzm [Gr. kataklus'mos , inunda¬ tion — from kata , down; kluzein, to wash]: any violent inundation that sweeps over a country. Cat'aclys'mal, a. -kUz'm&l, pertaining to an inundation or to its destruc¬ tive effects. Cat'acyls'mic, a. -kllz'mXk, of or pertaining to. Cataclysmist, n. : an upholder of the theory of cata¬ clysms. CATACOMB, n. k&t'a-kdm [from Greek kata, down, and kumbe, hollow]: subterranean galleries and chambers used in early times for the most part as burial places. The most important are those around Rome, about 60 in num¬ ber, the best known being along the Appian Way. They were excavated by the Christians of the first, second and third centuries to provide a place for the burial of their dead, since their religious scruples forbade cremation, and they consist of a network of galleries, each 3-5 feet wide and about 8 feet high. In the walls of these galleries recesses called loculi were hollowed out, about 6 feet long and sometimes wide enough to receive two or even three bodies. There are several of these loculi, sometimes 6 or 7, one above another. The openings are closed with stone slabs on which inscriptions are carved. At intervals the galleries open in vaulted rooms called cubicula, which were used apparently as family burial places, and in which relig¬ ious services were sometimes held. Often the galleries run one beneath another, sometimes forming as many as five successive stories. The depth below the surface varies from 20 to 75 feet. The total length of the galleries has been variously estimated at from 500 to 700 miles, and the number of bodies here interred at from two to six million. By Roman law the Catacombs as cemeteries were inviolable, and they therefore afforded temporary sanctuary to Christians fleeing from persecution. Later however, the persecutors disregarded their sacred char¬ acter and pursued their victims into these hiding places. Hence the Christians sought to conceal the entrances to the catacombs, demolishing the chapels that marked these entrances, and opening secret approaches, often through deserted sand pits (arenaria). When in 312 Constantine granted immunity from persecution to Chris¬ tianity the catacombs were of course no longer used as places of refuge, but burials were still made in them for about a century. The catacombs were repeatedly pil¬ laged by Goths and Lombards, so that the popes, to pre¬ vent further profanation, removed many bodies, especially those of saints and martyrs, within the city walls, and by the ninth century the catacombs were neglected and soon totally forgotten. They were rediscovered in 1578, Antonio Bosio devoting many years to their exploration. |In recent times De Rossi, Marucchi and Wilpert have made exhaustive study of them. See also Northcote, Roma Sotterranea, London, 1879. Many of the oldest inscriptions in the catacombs are in Greek, showing the CATACOROLLA— CATALAN. nationality of the earliest Christians in Rome. The constantly recurring symbols are the lamb, fish, dove, anchor, cross, palm-branch (marking the graves of mar¬ tyrs), and the Good Shepherd. There are very few por¬ traits, but the soul of the departed is often symbolized as a kneeling female figure, called the Orans. Biblical scenes are numerous, all symbolic of redemption or the resurrection: Lazarus, Jonah, the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace, Daniel in the lions’ den, the Last Supper, the rite of baptism, etc. Terra-cotta lamps, glass vases, coins, etc., have been found. The catacombs are of the greatest archaeological importance, for they are the only surviving monuments of Roman Christianity of the first three centuries, not a church of that period having escaped destruction. The catacombs of Naples, cut into the Capo di Monte, resemble those at Rome, and evidently were used for the same purposes, being in many parts literally covered with Christian symbols. Catacombs are also found in the Crimea, Asia Minor and Syria, and near Alexandria, Palermo, Syracuse, Chiusi, and elsewhere. Some are much earlier than the Christian era. In Peru and other parts of South America catacombs have been discovered. The catacombs of Paris are abandoned quarries into which were cast the contents of such burying-places as were found to be pestilential, and the bodies of some of the victims of 1792. CATACOROLLA, n. kdtf d-kd-rdVld [Gr. kata, under, down, and corolla ]: in hot., a second corolla formed inside or outside the first one. CATACOUSTICS, n. plu. kdtfd-kows'tiks [Gr. kata , against, and acoustics] : the doctrine of reflected sounds or echoes. CATADIOPTRIC, a. kdt'd-di-dp'trik: relating to both reflection and refraction of light. CATAFALQUE, n. kdt'd-fdlk [F. catafalque— from It. catafalco, a funeral decoration; mid. L. cadafal'tum, a scaffold]: in funeral solemnities, a temporary wooden structure decorated with paintings, sculpture, drapery, etc., intended to represent a tomb, and show the coffin; an elaborate hearse. A magnificent catafalque was that used at the interment of Micheal Angelo, at Florence. CATALAN, kdt'd-ldn: the language spoken in Catalonia and Valencia, in Spain; a kind of wine; Adj. of or from Catalonia. CAT'ALAN : a blast furnace for reducing ores, extensive¬ ly used in the north of Spain, particularly in the province of Catalonia. It consists of a four-sided cavity or hearth, which is always placed within a building and separated from the main wall thereof by a thinner interior wall, which in part constitutes one side of the furnace. The blast-pipe comes through the wall, and enters the fire through a twyer which slants downward. The bottom is CATALANI— CATALDO. formed of a refractory stone, which is renewable. The furnace has no chimneys. The blast is produced by means of a fall of water, usually from 22 to 27 feet high, through a rectangular tube into a rectangular cistern below, to whose upper part the blast-pipe is connected, the water escaping through a pipe below. This apparatus is exter¬ ior to the building, and is said to afford a continuous blast of great regularity; the air, when it passes into the furnace, is, however, impregnated with moisture. CATALANI, M-td-l&'ne, Angelica: celebrated Italian singer: 1780 (or 84)-1849, June 13: b. Sinigaglia, in central Italy. She was educated in the convent of St. Lucien, near Rome, where, in her seventh year, she showed such wonderful vocal powers that strangers flocked from all quarters to hear her. She made her first public appearance at Venice, in her 16th year, and experienced a succession of triumphs in every country in Europe for more than 30 years, amassing immense sums of money. The Italian opera in Paris was twice under her direction; but her husband’s interference and extravagance brought her into much trouble. Her large, queenly person and fine coun¬ tenance, the immense volume, range, and flexibility of her voice, her power of sustaining her notes, in contrast with the lightness and facility of her unerring execution, everywhere took her audience by storm. Her expression, although fine, and her whole style-, surprised rather than touched the heart. In concert-singing her great triumphs were in Rhode's Air with variations, and God, save the King — in which she would say shave; and in oratorios her spe¬ cial triumph was in Luther's Hymn , her delivery of which, when her marvellous voice alternated with the trumpet’s sound, was so sublimely awful that the audience were hushed and pale, and some were borne away fainting. The throat from which these wondrous sounds proceeded was physically of such dimensions, that a physician, when called to look into it, declared he could have passed down a penny-loaf! In 1830, Madame Catalani purchased near Florence a villa, formerly belonging to the Medici family, where she gave free instructions to girls who had a talent for singing, on condition of their taking the name of Cata¬ lani. In the spring of 1849, when political disturbances broke out in Tuscany, she went with her daughters to Paris, where she died of cholera. CATALAUNIAN PLAIN, kat-a-law'ni-an ( Campi Ca- talaunid ) : anc. name of the wide plain surrounding Cha- lons-sur-Marne, in the old province of Champagne, France, celebrated as the field of battle where the West Goths and the forces under the Roman general Aetius gained a great victory over Attila, a.d. 451. A wild tradition (made the subject of a striking picture by Kaulbach, Die Hunnen- schlacht , or The Battle of the Huns ) tells that three days after the great fight the ghosts of the fallen myriads ap¬ peared on the plain and renewed the conflict. CATAL'DO, San: town of Sicily, province of Caltani- CATALEPSY— CATALONIA. setta; five m. w. of the town of Caltanisetta. There are productive sulphur mines in its vicinity. Pop. 15,000. CATALEPSY, n. k&t'ti-lep'si [Gr. katalepsis — from kata, down; lepsis, a taking or seizing]: a nervous affection in which the muscles are rigid but not inflexible, the limbs retaining any position in which they may be placed. The disease occurs in paroxysms like epilepsy (q.v.), but there are no convulsions, the patient simply becoming unconsious and the muscles being set in the position they last held before the attack began. At first the muscles are absolutely stiff, but later they become plastic, when the patient can je put in any position and will maintain it for a time. If the leg is raised from the bed it will remain elevated until gradually pulled down by the force of grav¬ ity; the patient’s power of initiating muscular movement is entirely abolished. During the attack the patient should be placed in an easy position on the bed or couch, and should be allowed to lie there undisturbed; no good is effected by attempts to arouse the patient. If the sleep which follows the seizure be long continued (it may last for weeks) it may become necessary to feed the patient artificially and to see that the bladder and bowels are regularly evacuated. The state may be directly induced by suggestion or manipulation in the hypnotic condition (see Hypnotism) and occurs spontaneously in functional disturbances, notably in hysteria. The statue-like posture is frequently maintained for long periods, and is accom¬ panied by marked insensibility. At times the rigidity assumes a form in which the limbs may be set first in one posture then in another, each being retained until altered. This vacant immobility characterizes the cata¬ leptic state and helps to distinguish it from allied trance states. Cataleptic conditions occur as the result of in¬ tense religious excitement in individuals disposed to ner¬ vous disorder. See Hysteria, Trance, Cataplexy. CATALOGUE, n. k&t'd-lfig [F. catalogue — from Gr. kdtal'ogos, a list — from kata, down ; logos, a word] : a list of names in regular order; a roll; a register: V. to make a fist of. Cataloguing, imp. Catalogued, pp. -Idgd. CATALONIA, kat-a-lo'ni-a (Spanish, Cataluna ) : old province and principality of Spain, now divided into the provinces of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida, and Gerona; total area 12,483 sq. m.; pop. (1900) 1,946,382. Cata¬ lonia occupies the n.e. corner of Spain, having France on the n., and the Mediterranean on the e. and s.e. It is watered by the Llobregat, and the Ter, and by some of the affluents of the Ebro, the last mentioned river having its embouchure m Catalonia. The coast is rugged, its boldest promontories being Capes Creus and San Se¬ bastian, and its deepest indentations the bays of Rosas and Tarragona. Near Barcelona, oranges flourish in the open air; the fields in some parts are bounded by aloe-hedges, and olives grow on Montserrat. Cork¬ trees grow on the mountains, and thickets of thorn- apple, laurel, myrtle, pomegranate, box, rosemary, Vol. 7 — 35 CATALPA. etc., extend where the cork has its limits. Northern upper C. has a more severe winter than the south; hut everywhere, vineyards and olive-gardens cover the slopes, and cornfields extend in the valle}rs. Among the products are hemp, flax, madder, barilla, and saffron. Hazel-nuts, a variety called Barcelona nuts, are extensively grown. Meadow-lands and pastures are comparatively rare, and horned cattle are, there¬ fore, found mostly in the districts bordering the Pyrenees; while few horses and mules are kept; but sheep, goats, and swine are bred in considerable numbers. Silk-wrorms and bees are reared. The coasts abound with fish, and game is plentiful. The minerals are coal, copper, manganese, zinc, lead, cobalt, salt, sulphur, and many varieties of marble. C. is the principal manufacturing province of the king¬ dom — is, in fact, ‘the Lancashire of Spain.’ The inhabit¬ ants are neither French nor Spaniards, their language, eostume, and habits being quite distinct from those of either; they have also local coins, weights, and measures. In energy, industry, and intelligence, they greatly surpass the rest of the Spaniards. C., under the name of Hispania Tarraconen&is, was one of the earliest, and remained among the last of the Roman provinces. It was invaded and captured by the Alans, who were followed by the Goths; hence its name, Gotha- lania, changed into Gothalunia or Catalonia. In the 8th c. the Arabs gained possession of the s. part. When Charlemagne, 788, subjugated Spain as far as the Ebro, C. formed the central portion of the Spanish mark, governed by French counts, having Barcelona as their residence. They soon made themselves independent of France. In 1137, Earl Raymund Berengar, by his marriage, united C. with Aragon ; and the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella (1469) united both with Castile, and so C. became a portion of the Spanish monarchy, but never a very peaceable one. In modern times it has repeatedly taken a prominent share in Carlist or other insurrections. CATALPA, ka-tal'pa: genus of trees of the order Big noniacece, with a two-parted calyx, a bell-shaped corolla and five stamens, two of which bear a cylindrical pod often one ft. long, and broadly- winged seeds. There are three species: the chief, G. syringifolia, is indigenous in the southern states, where it is often over 50 ft. high, with a trunk two ft. in diameter. It has a silver-gray bark, few branches, a wide-spreading head, and large, heart-shaped, pale green leaves; the flowers are white, dotted with pur- fle and violet; the pods remain on the tree through the winter. The C. is much cultivated in the northern states and in Europe. In New England it dwindles to a shrub, and is often killed by frost. In milder climates it will grow' to a height of 20 ft. in ten years, and then begin to blossom. One in Gray’s Inn gardens, London, is said to have been planted by Bacon. In Italy and southern France it is often planted along the roadside. The C. may be propagated by seeds, or from cuttings of the root. Its wood being light, of fine texture, and susceptible of a brill¬ iant polish, is used by cabinet-makers. CATALYSIS— CATAMARAN. CATALYSIS, n. kd-tdl'i-sis [Gr. katdV iisU- — from kata , down; luo, 1 loosen]: in cliem. physics, term used to desig¬ nate certain phenomena, in which changes in the composi¬ tion of substances are effected by the presence of another body which itself undergoes no change. Catalytic, a. kat' d-lit'ik, relating to catalysis. The force in catalysis has been ascribed to the mere ‘action of contact.’ Fer¬ mentation is an example of this force (see Beer), when one part of yeast acting upon the sugar of the ...sweet worts, without entering into combination with it, compels 100 parts of sugar to pass into alcohol and carbonic acid. Germination, or the sprouting of grain when placed in the ground, is another example where one part of diastase changes 1,000 parts of starch into Sugar. No plausible theory has been brought forward to account for these changes, or to define what the force of C. is. Liebig sug¬ gested, as an explanation, ‘ that a body in the act of com¬ bination or decomposition enables another body with which it is in contact to enter into the same state; ’ but this view does not explain C., as that force does not act in the majority of cases where changes are proceeding, and, moreover, the acting substance, while changing itself, never throws the body acted upon into th e same state of change, but causes it to assume a new series of changes different from those pursued by itself. CATALYSOTYPE, kdt-a-lis' o-tip : a name given to a modification (by Dr. Wood) of the calotype process, in photography, on the assumption that light set up a catalyt¬ ic action (see Catalysis) among the ingredients employed. The paper is first washed with very dilute hydrochloric acid, to prevent the formation of yellow patches of insen¬ sitiveness, and then treated with sirup of iodide of iron containing a trace of free iodine; it is then partially dried between folds of blotting-paper, and sensitized by brushing over it a solution of nitrate of silver of ten grains to the ounce. Immediate exposure in the camera follows; after which, though no picture be visible at first, if it be allowed to remain in the dark for a period which varies with the length of time it was exposed, and the amount of light, a negative picture of great perfection is gradually developed. It is not necessary, however, for the explanation of this phenomenon, to assume that a catalytic action is set up, inasmuch as the ordinary chemical reactions are quite sufficient to account for it. As soon as nitrate of silver comes in contact with the moist iodide of iron with which the paper is first imbued, an interchange of elements takes place, iodide of silver is precipitated in the pores of the paper, and protonitrate of iron is diffused over the surface; and this latter salt is even a more energetic developing agent than the ordinary gallic acid, hence the seemingly spontaneous appearance of the picture. This process is so uncertain in its results that it is seldom practiced. CATAMARAN, n. kdt' a-md-rdn' \\cathamaran, floating trees — native name]: raft formed of three planks or logs lashed together, the middle one serving as a keel, and the other two for the sides. The rower stands or nartlv kneels CATAMARCA-CA TAMENIA. on the middle plank, and works a paddle. These simple vessels are used by the natives of Madras, to maintain communication between ships and the shore, ordinary boats being rendered unsafe by the surf. By the adop¬ tion of a similar construction on a larger scale, some catamarans are made large and strong enough to carry goods, and even artillery. Catamarans used in Brazil con¬ sist simply of three logs of wood tapered at the end and lashed together; they carry a sail. CATAMARCA, kd-td-mar'kd: province of the Argen¬ tine republic, lat. 25°-29° s , Ion. 65°-69' w.; bounded n. by Salta, e. by Tucuman and Santiago, s. by Rioja, and w. by the Andes; 31,500 sq. m. It is largely mountain¬ ous; the highest range, Sierra de Aconquija, is nearly 17,000 ft. high. The streams are mostly , dry in summer and torrents in winter; the only river is the Santa Maria. Some of the elevated plains are sandy deserts; others are yearly inundated, and on the withdrawal of the waters covered with blocks of salt, which are carried away on llamas and sold. Gold and silver mines were formerly worked, and copper is still found in quantities. Parts of C are fertile and produce abundantly grain, vegetables, and fruit, especially apples. Cotton, though said to be the finest known, is raised on a smaller scale than formerly. The forests yield many varieties of timber. Earthenware, ponchos, and woolen and alpaca fabrics are manufactured; cattle, mules, asses, sheep, hides, leather, wine, brandy, tobacco, pepper, cochineal, anise-seed, and copper are ex¬ ported. Pop. (1895) 89 645, abt. one-half Mestizos and In¬ dians of the once powerful Calchaquio tribe. Immigra¬ tion from Europe has been active since 1875. CATAMARCA (originally San Fernando de G): capital of province of C.; lat. 28'' 20' s., long. 66° 25' w. It was built 1685 to replace the former cap. Chacca, the site of which, not far w., had been found unhealthful and exposed to inundation. C. is built with some regularity, has a large square, an obelisk commemorating national indepen¬ dence, a small town house, a fort, a Franciscan monastery, and a St. Theresa convent: another, formerly used by the Mercedarios and the Jesuits, is now a high school. C. is the commercial centre of a large and well-cultivated dist. It manufactures flour and hats, and exports dried figs, wine, brandy, and cotton. Pop. 8,000. CATAMENIA, n. kdt'd-me'ni-a [Gr. katamenibs, month- CATANDUANES— CATANIA. ly — from kata, down; men, month]: the monthly courses of females (see Menstruation). Cat'ame'nial, a. -rae'- ni-al, pertaining to. CATANDUANES, a small island in the Philippines, e. of Luzon, about 90 m. long by 50 m. wide; area 704 sq. in. It is mountainous, and is reputed to have rich gold deposits. In 1900 the island with Leyte and part of Luzon was created a military department, over which Gen. John C. Bates was placed in command. There are no large towns in Catanduanes. Pop. (1899) 35,633. CATANIA, ka-t&'ne-d, or Catanea, kd-t&'na-d: city and seaport of Sicily, cap. of the province of Catania; on the e. coast near the foot of Mt. Etna, 31 m. n.n.w. of Syracuse. The fertile and well-cultivated neighborhood of Catania along the s.e. base of Mt. Etna, is styled The granary of Sicily/ and has given to Catania the title, 'La Bella Catania.’ B}'- eruptions of the great volcano and at¬ tendant earthquakes, the city has been several times almost entirely destroyed — especially in 1693; but out of its ruins it has always risen with increased beauty, and is now the finest city in Sicily, being built throughout on a beautiful and consistent plan, from which no devia¬ tion is allowed. The harbor of Catania, formerly good, was choked by a stream of lava in 1693, and the mole was partly destroyed, so that now it has only a road¬ stead, which is guarded by a fort, and serves as a landing- place. It has several squares, the finest of which, in front of the cathedral, has a statue of an elephant sculp¬ tured in lava. Among its chief public buildings are the Benedictine convent and church of San Nicolo, with one exception the grandest structure of the kind in Europe; the town-hall, the cathedral, with its noble granite col¬ umns, and the university, founded 1445. It has besides many handsome churches and convents, and several educational and charitable institutions, and is the seat of one of the three|high courts in the island. The in¬ habitants are distinguished by their commercial spirit and industry. Catania has manufactures of silk and linen goods, and of articles in amber, lava, wood, etc. Among the remains of ancient times, that earthquakes have spared, are those of a theatre, an odeium, a temple of Ceres, Roman baths, and an aqueduct. Catania, an¬ ciently known by the name Catana, was founded by a Greek colony of Chalcidic origin in the latter part of b.c. 8th c. ; and as early as the beginning of b.c. 5th c. it was esteemed one of the most flourishing towns in Sicily. It was taken by the Athenians under Nicias and was des¬ olated by Dionysius I. ; but again rose under the Roman sway into its former importance. Augustus here founded a Roman colony. It suffered at the hands of the Goths, but once more, under the Byzantine empire, became one of the principal cities in the island. Pop., formerly much more numerous, (1881) 97,355; (1901) 149,295. CATANIA, Gulf of: inlet of the Mediterranean, on CATANZARO— CATAPLASM. the e. coast of Sicily, extending in the form of a semi¬ circle from La Trezza Bay to Cape Santa Croce, 18 m. It extends about 10 m. within the coast line, and receives the river Giaretta. CATANZARO, kd-tdn-zd'ro: city of s. Italy, province of Catanzaro, beautifully situated on the declivity of a rocky hill, near the Gulf of Squillace, and in a very fer¬ tile district. On account of its agreeable climate, many wealthy families have made it their residence. It has a cathedral, an old castle of the Norman period, a college, one of the largest, as it is one of the best conducted in the country, and is the seat of one of the four great civil courts of the kingdom. Catanzaro suffered very severely by an earthquake 1783. It has manufactures of silk- velvet and woolen fabrics, and an active trade in agri¬ cultural produce. Pop. (1881) 20,931; (1901)31,824. CATAPETALOUS, a. htit'ti-pet'd-lus [Gr. kata , under; petalon, a petal]: in hot., having the petals joined to each other and to the stamens, at the base, as in mallows. CATAPHASIA, n. ktit-a-fas'-i-a, [Gr. kata down, and phasis, speaking] : A symptom of certain forms of dis¬ orders of speech, characterized by a tendency to repeat again and again the same words or phrases. Such auto¬ matic repetition may take place spontaneously or when the patient tries to speak or to reply to a question. The symptom is commonly connected with serious disinte¬ gration of the delicate centres of the nervous system. Certain writers use the term to refer to a more general speech-disorder of similar origin and status, in which the patient’s language resembles the skeleton outline and imperfect grammatical construction of a child’s speech. See Speech and its Defects. CATAPHONIC, a. kat'd-fdn'ik [Gr. kata, against; phone , voice]: relating to the reflection of sound. CATAPHRACT, n. k&t'd-fr&kt [Gr. kataphrak'tos, en¬ cased, fortified] : defensive armor ; a horseman in complete armor. Cat'aphrac'ted, a. -frdk'ted, covered with armor or scales. CATAPHYLLARY, a. k&t'd-fil'er-i [Gr. kata, down; phullon, a leaf]: applied to the leaves of a plant when they are mere scales; having the leaves inclosed in buds by perules, or on a root-stock by scales; inclosing true leaves. CATAPLASM, n. kdt'd-pldzm [L. cataplas'ma; Gr. kata- plas'ma — from Gr. kata, down; plasso, I mold; F. cata- plasme ]: poultice or plaster; an application to diseased or painful parts, for the purpose of promoting suppuration, re¬ lieving pain, and stimulating or soothing the skin, accord¬ ing to circumstances. A cataplasm may be composed of any moist pulpy substance of sufficient consistence to retain the water without dripping or soaking through the thin muslin covering in which it is generally wrapped. The making of a poultice is a matter of some nicety, and unless the proper CATAPLEXY— CATAPULT. consistence is given to the mass, the application is apt to do more harm than good. The linseed-meal poultice is the most easily made, and most satisfactory of all soothing ap¬ plications. The meal is stirred gradually into a sufficient quantity of boiling water, placed in the bottom of a small basin or teacup, until a perfectly smooth pulp is formed of the proper consistence, and in quantity sufficient to cover completely, to the thickness of three-quarters of an inch, the whole pained part. The pulp is then folded up in muslin or thin calico, and applied as soon as the heat will permit it to be borne. The bread and milk, or even bread and water poultice, is also very good ; as is also the oatmeal-porridge poultice, to which a little butter may be added with advan¬ tage. A spoonful or two of yeast may be added, if there are foul discharges, or peat charcoal may be sprinkled on the surface of the poultice before it is applied. Carrot poul¬ tices are in great favor with the people in some places. Hemlock poultices, made of the fresh leaves, or of the dried leaves, with the aid of some powder of the leaves, form a valuable sedative application in painful diseases ; and poppy heads, or even opium, are sometimes infused in the water of which a poultice is made, for the same purpose. A stimu¬ lating cataplasm or poultice may be made by sprinkling oil of turpentine, or chloroform, or mustard in moderate quantity on the surface of any ordinary poultice. ' When considerable irritation of the skin in a short time is desira¬ ble, a mustard cataplasm or sinapism [ sinapi , mustard] is used. CATAPLEXY, kat-a-plex'-i, n. [from Gr. Jcata, down, and plesis, to strike]: a term suggested by Preyer (1878) to describe the condition of immobility and apparent paraly¬ sis induced in an animal by firmly restraining all move¬ ments. The experiment of forcibly holding a hen, which then for a brief period rigidly retains the posture when released, is described by Kircher in 1646. Similar unnat¬ ural postures have been induced in lizards, frogs, birds, guinea pigs, rabbits, and other animals. The phenomenon has been variously explained as similar to catalepsy as induced in hypnosis, as a paralysis by fear or shock, (so-called fascination of a bird by a snake), as allied to the death-feigning instincts, and as a special nervous reflex evoked by the manipulation itself. The fact that the state is most readily induced in certain animals favors an explanation like the last, which refers it to a constitutional trait of the nervous system, which in turn may be brought into play by a psychic shock. See Catalepsy. CATAPULT, n. k&t'ti-pult [L. catapulta — from Gr. kata, down ; pallo, I hurl : comp. Gael, cathtabhail, the battle¬ sling] : engine of war used by the ancients, somewhat resem¬ bling the crossbow. In the catapult a string or rope, sud¬ denly freed from great tension, gave a powerful impulse to an arrow placed in a groove. There were also great catapultas, fixed upon a scaffold with wheels, which were used for throwing great stones in sieges; and small ones. CATARACT— CATARACTS. Catapult. carried in the hand, which were employed in the field. For a description of similar engines of ancient warfare, see Ballista: Arbalest. A toy-catapult is used by boys in their amusements to throw stones. CATARACT, n. kdt'a-rakt [Gr. kattiraktes; L. catarac'ta , a waterfall — from Gr. kata , down; raktos, a precipice, or rhasso, I dash]: the rushing of a great body of water over steep rocks (see Waterfall) ; a disease in the eye by which the vision becomes impaired or destroyed, caused by an opacity of the cornea. See Eye, Diseases of the. CATARACTS: one of the names given to sudden de- • scents in streams of water, the more general English term being fall or falls. A considerable declivity in the bed of a river produces rapids. When it shoots over a preci¬ pice it forms a cataract. If it falls from steep to steep, in successive cataracts, it is often called a cascade. In rocky countries rivers abound in falls and fapids. In alluvial districts, falls, of course, are very rare. Rapids and cataracts are often a blessing to rugged countries, since they furnish the cheapest means of driving machines in manufactories, etc. In recent times waterfalls have been utilized in the furnishing of electric power in addi¬ tion to the ordinary water-power. Many cataracts are remarkable for their sublimity, the grandest known being Niagara Falls (q.v.), on the Niagara river, between lakes Erie and Ontario. Some others of note are mentioned below. The Montmorency river, which joins the St. Lawrence a few miles below Quebec, forms a magnificent cataract, 250 feet high. The Missouri, in the upper part of its course, descends 357 feet in 16£ miles. There are four cataracts, one of 87, one of 19, one of 47, and one of 26 feet high. The Yosemite river in California forms a series of magnificent falls, with a total descent of 2,600 feet. The first of them is a plunge of 1,500 feet, and is followed, after a series of beautiful cascades, by a final plunge of about 400 feet. Fully 200 miles from the mouth CATARACTS. Comparison of Victoria Falls (Africa), 400 feet high, with Niagara Falls, 168 feet high. The tower of the Singer Building (New \\ ork), 612 feet high, rises above the crest. CATARACTS. of the Hamilton river in Labrador there is a magnificent series of cataracts known as the Grand Falls, the largest having a height of over 300 feet. In Colombia, South America, a great cataract, that of Tequendama, is formed by the Bogota river. The river precipitates itself through a narrow chasm, about 36 feet broad, to the depth of over 600 feet. On the Potaro river in British Guiana, the Kaieteur Fall, 740 feet high, and about 370 broad, is a splendid spectacle, and just below it is a second fall of 88 feet. The most remarkable waterfall of Africa is one with which Dr. Livingstone’s missionary travels first made us acquainted. This is a cataract on the Zambesi, called by the natives Mosioatunya (‘smoke sounds here’), named by him Victoria Falls. The stream, about 1,860 yards broad, flowing over a bed of basaltic rock, is suddenly precipitated into a tremendous fissure, extending across the bed of the river from the right to the left bank, to the depth of about 370 feet. The breadth of this fissure or crack is only from 80 to 90 yards, and the pent-up waters, from which immense columns of vapor are continually ascending, are then hurried through a pro¬ longation of the chasm to the left with furious violence. The so-called Cataracts of the Nile are not, proper¬ ly speaking, cataracts. A more correct designation for them would be ‘rapids.’ The Stanley Falls on the Congo comprise seven cataracts. On the Tugela river in Natal there are the Tugela Falls. On the Umgeni river, in the same country, are the falls of the Great Umgeni (364 feet) and the Kar Kloof Falls (350). There seem to be no waterfalls of more note in Asia than those of the Cavery river of India. One of the grandest falls in Europe is that of the Ruikan- foss (‘smoking fall’), on the Maan river in Norway. The height of the cataract is 805 feet. In Sweden, on the Gotha river, a few miles below its outlet from Lake Wener, are the celebrated falls of Trollhatta, which have a height of over 100 feet. The cascade of Gavarnie, in the Pyrenees, is reputed the loftiest in Europe, being over 1,300 feet high. Its volume of water, however, is so small that it is converted into spray before reaching the bottom of the fall. Another waterfall in the Pyrenees is that of Seculejo, in the neighborhood of Bagneres-de-Luchon. It descends from the Lac d’Espingo, into the Lac de Seculejo, or d’Oo, a singularly romantic mountain reservoir, from a height of 820 feet, and is the most copious of the Pyrenean waterfalls. The Swiss Alps likewise contain some falls of great sublimity. At Lauterbrunnen, in addition to numer¬ ous other cascades, is the renowned fall of the Staubbach, about 870 feet high, which, however, from its small volume of water, has none of the terrific adjuncts of a cataract, and resembles, in front, a beautiful lace veil suspended from the summit of the precipice. Near Martigny is the picturesque waterfall of the Sellesche or Pissevache, the final leap of the cascade being 128 feet. The falls of the CATARHINA— CATARRH. Rhine at Schaffhausen are renowned over Europe. They are 300 feet broad, and nearly 100 feet high. In Italy the falls of Terni, or the Cascate del Marmore, on the Velino, have been immortalized by Lord Byron, and though arti¬ ficial, are justly regarded as among the finest and most picturesque in Europe. They consist of three falls, the aggregate height of which may be estimated at 550 feet. The falls of the Anio or Teverone, at Tivoli, are likewise very beautiful. They, too, are artificial, and have a fall of about 80 feet. CATARHINA, kdt'd-rl'nd [Gr. kata, down ; rhines, nostrils]: in zool., a group of the Quadrumana, character¬ ized by twisted or curved nostrils placed at the end of the snout \"(see Monkey). Catarhine, a. k&t'&r-m, of or belong¬ ing to. CATARRH, n. ka-tdr' [L. catarrhus — from Gr. kata, down; rheo, I flow]: a disease of great frequency in tem¬ perate latitudes, especially in changeable, moist climates in the winter, or in the late autumn and early spring. Ca- tar'rhal, a. -r&l, pertaining to. From the well-known connection of this disease with sudden falls of tempera^ ture, and- other epidemic or atmospheric causes (see In¬ fluenza), as also from the chill often experienced at the commencement of the disease, it is popularly called a cold — a term quite inappropriate in many cases ; while the term catarrh is in popular use restricted to a chronic inflamma¬ tion of the mucous membrane of the nose and throat attended with a profuse secretion of mucus. A ‘cold in the head’ is, in scientific language, coryza. A ‘cold’ com¬ monly begins with a feeling of chilliness, which may or may not be attributed to external causes. Sometimes this is absent, there being only a sense of languor and indispo¬ sition; not unfrequently there is no unusual sensation until a stuffing is experienced in the nostrils with fre¬ quent sneezing, or severe headache, or hoarseness with cough, or oppression of the breathing. The regular form of a cold is to attack the nostrils first — in some cases the throat, and afterward the air-passages leading to the chest. When it habitually attacks the chest, without running through its ordinary course as indicated above, there is often some special cause of delicacy in the lungs, or some constitutional tendency toward consumption (q.v.). The discharge is in the beginning watery, becom¬ ing afterward more abundant, glairy, and of yellowish color ; the early stages of the disease are attended by considerable irritation of the surfaces affected, and there is frequently a general feeling of prostration. The treatment of acute catarrh (or ‘cold’) is commonly simple, so far as the particular attack is concerned. Con¬ finement to the house, and, in severe cases, to bed, or t9 the sofa, for a day or two; a warm hip or foot bath, to re¬ move the chill; light farinaceous diet, and a dose or two of some gentle laxative, are usually sufficient to subdue the disease. Some persons gain a cure by entire absti- CATARRH. nence from food, and as much as possible from drink; others by a large opiate, or by a succession of doses of Dover’s powder ; others by spirit of mindererus and para- goric ; some even profess to carry out the popular maxim, ‘stuff a cold, and starve a fever,’ and maintain, that a good dinner, and a tumbler of whisky or brandy toddy, are the best specifics* That persons recover from colds under all these methods, needs not be denied ; but that any violently perturbative or specific practice assists the cure, or shortens the disease, has yet to be proved; and multi¬ plied experience has shown that ‘stuffing a cold’ is by no means to be commended. In the later stages, however, a more liberal diet than at first, and in some cases even a very cautious allowance of stimulants, afford considerable relief from the feeling of depression that remains for a time on the subsidence of a catarrh. The tendency to this disease, when habitual, and when not dependent on any form of constitutional disorder requiring special means for its cure, is best met by the daily use of the cold bath, with frequent exercise in the open air, and proper ventilation of the sleeping-apartment; also by friction of the skin, and by clothing which, without be¬ ing oppressive, is comfortably warm. Exposure to draughts or sudden chills, when the surface is perspiring, is to be avoided : but even without such exposure, a close confined or over-heated air habitually breathed in a workshop or bedroom, is one of the most fruitful predisposing causes of the disease. # Catarrh is not confined to the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, but may attack any of the mucous mem¬ branes of the body. In the larynx in children it consti¬ tutes what is called catarrhal croup. In the stomach it gives rise to symptoms of acute or chronic indigestion. When it invades the lining membrane of the intestines it causes an attack of acute diarrhea. Catarrh of the ear ( otitis media) and catarrh of the eye ( conjunctivitis ) are common affections. For an account of the symptoms and course of catarrh of these different regions see the articles treating of the diseases of the respective organs. Wherever catarrh is located it may be acute or chronic in character. The chronic form may follow an acute attack — usually a series of acute attacks, each one lasting longer than its predecessor, until finally the affection becomes continuous with intervals of amelioration but never of complete freedom. In the chronic form of respir¬ atory catarrh, the peculiar painful discomfort experienced during an acute attack is absent, but the discharge is profuse, tenacious in consistency, and yellowish in color due to the presence of pus in addition to mucus. There are two forms of chronic catarrh of the nose and throat, the hypertrophic and the atrophic, the latter usually fol¬ lowing the former. In hypertrophic catarrh the mucous membrane becomes thickened and the patient suffers from difficulty of breathing through the nostrils and must open the mouth in order to get sufficient air to supply his CATASETUM— CATAWBA. respiratory needs. In atrophic catarrh the mucous mem¬ brane is thinned and its function is impaired. The dis¬ charge is lessened, but crusts form which impede the pas¬ sage of air. These crusts, if retained, may decompose and give rise to a very disagreeable odor. When this condi¬ tion becomes pronounced the disease is called ozena (q.v.). Atrophic catarrh of the nasal mucous membrane, if un¬ checked, often extends through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear, causing incurable deafness. The treatment of catarrh should never be neglected, since the tendency of the disease is to progress. Cleanliness is essential. The patient should, several times a day, sniff up a solution of table salt and water held in the palm of the hand. This will wash away the secretion and crusts and keep the nostrils free. Other medication is however, essential, but this should be entrusted to the medical attendant, since there is no remedyjthat will be effective in all cases, and the treatment must be varied according to the indi¬ cations present in each individual patient. Catarrh is often caused by some abnormal formation of the nasal passages, such as hypertrophy of the turbinated bones (see Nose) or a deviation from the straight line of the septum, and for its cure a surgical operation designed to correct this malformation is necessary. CATASETUM, n. k&t'd-se'ttim [perhaps Gr. kata, down, against; L. saeta, a stiff hair, a bristle, a spiny leaf]: an extensive genus of fleshy-stemmed, terrestrial orchids of tropical America, ord. Orchidacece — probably so named from the extraordinary crests and projections on the label- lum. CATASTASIS, n. ka-t&s'tti-sis [Gr. katastasis — from kata, down; histemi, to set]: in rhet., the exordium of a speech ; that part in which the speaker sets forth the sub¬ ject-matter to be discussed, and the order and manner in which it is proposed to be treated; in med., the state or condition of a person; constitution. CATASTROPHE, n. kd-t&s'tro-fe [Gr. kat&s'trophe, an overthrow — from kata, down; strophe, a turning]: a great calamity; a violent convulsion in nature; a final event; the conclusion of a series of events. Catastrophism, ka-tds'~ tro-fxzm, theory in geol., that violent convulsions or physi¬ cal revolutions have occurred at successive periods, causing the elevation or subsidence of portions of the globe, and the destruction of large tribes of men or multitudes of animals. CATAWBA, ka-taw'ba, or Great Catawba: river of North and South Carolina. It rises in McDowell co., N. C., in the Blue Ridge, flows e. through the gold region to Iredell co., turns s. into S. C., and forms the e. boundary of York co. and Chester co.; near Rocky Mount it receives an affluent and changes its name to the Wateree, which, with the Congaree, forms the Santee. The Catawba is abt. 250 m. long; the Wateree 100 miles. CATAWBA: a light sparkling wine, of rich Muscadine flavor, produced in the neighborhood of Cincinnati. It CATAWBAS— CAT BOAT. is made from a grape called the catawba grape, ‘first found growing on the banks of the Catawba river, in Carolina.’ This wine, scarcely known in England, is now in exten¬ sive use in N. America, where it is gradually superseding the importation of the Rhenish and French sparkling wines, which, in general character, it resembles. The vineyards where the catawba is produced are on the steep and beau¬ tiful slopes with southern exposure on the banks of the Ohio river, under the shelter of high hills on the n. The first great grower of the catawba was Nicholas Longworth, an early settler and esteemed and wealthy proprietor in this region, who, embarking in the pursuit less on business considerations than as an enthusiast, succeeded, after pa¬ tient care and much expense, in producing a wine that in many parts of the United States finds a favor and a price rivalling the choice imported wines. Some of the finer kinds of catawba equal the best champagne in delicacy and purity, but there are numerous inferior American imitations. CATAWBAS, ka-taw'baz: Indian tribe in North and South Carolina, now nearly extinct. In the last c. they occupied six towns on the Catawba river, had 1,500 war¬ riors, fought with the Cherokees, Shawnees, and Iroquois, but were friendly to the whites, helped them against other tribes, and furnished S. C. with troops in the revolutionary war; afterward they leased their lands and removed to the Cherokee country, but returned to a reservation granted them. Peter Harris, a soldier of the revolution, was said to be the last Catawba of pure blood ; those now remaining are half-breeds. Gallatin grouped the Catawbas with the Cherokees, Choctaws, Muskogees, and Natchez. Their language is allied to that of the Waccoes, but not to those of Canada whence they were said to have come. 300 of their words, collected by O. M. Lieber, 1856, appeared in vol. ii. of the Collections of S. Car. Hist. Soc., 1858. CATBALOGAN, kdt-bd-lo-gdn' , or Cadvalonga, kdd-va- l&n'gd: town of the Philippines, cap. of the island of Samar, on a small bay on the w. coast. The houses are mostly constructed of nipa palm, but there are some of stone. Pop. abt. 7,000. CAT-BIRD ( Turdus felivox ) : an American thrush, of the • same group with the mocking-bird, which it resembles in vocal powers. It is a bird of passage, making its way north¬ ward in spring through Georgia and Carolina as far as Massachusetts. It feeds on fruit and berries of all kinds, worms, and insects; builds a large nest of dry twigs, weeds, etc., without any attempt at concealment, in a bush or tree, often in the immediate vicinity of human habita¬ tions, and shows extraordinary boldness in the defense of its young. It has its name from a mewing cry which it utters when annoyed by an intruder approaching too near its nest. CAT-BOAT : a boat having one mast stepped just abaft the bow and carrying a sail laced to a boom and gaff, re- CATCH— CATCH-FLY. sembling a schooner’s mainsail. In general cat-boats are very broad in the beam, averaging 1 .3. They are usually equipped with a centre-board, which, with the extreme forward position of the mast, enables them* to point high into the wind, and makes them remarkably quick in stays. They are principally employed as pleasure craft on the coasts and inland navigable waters of the United States, and are consequently of shallow draft. CATCH, v. k&ch [F. chasser ; prov. F. cacher, to hunt— from mid. L. capture, to hunt; Ger. klatsch, a slap, a clap; Gael, glac, to seize]: to seize; to seize suddenly in hunting; to lay hold on with the hands; to arrest; to snatch; to take or receive by exposure, as a cold, or a disease by infection; to take hold, as fire; to insnare; to overtake: N. anything that seizes or holds; the thing caught; a latch; the act of seizing; a sudden advantage taken; a song in parts, in which those singing catch up the strain one after the other at various intervals ; a musical composition in the canon style, which originated in England. The words, generally humor¬ ous, are intended to be sung in musical parties; and the music is generally for three voices, each voice, as in the canon, taking up the subject at a certain distance after the first has begun. Catch'ing, imp.: Adj. apt to catch; in¬ fectious. Caught, pp. pt. kawt. Catcher, n. one who. Catch-penny, something worthless; a book published for the public taste, but without value. Catch-word, the word placed under the last line of a page, and made to be¬ gin the first line of the next. Catching a tartar, being caught in the trap one has laid for another ; being decei vea in the character of the object which has been pursued. Catchment, n. kdch'ment, in engirt., a space of ground where water may be caught and retained for use. Catch- drains, or Catching-drains, open or covered drains across a declivity to intercept and lead off surface-water. Catchment basin or Area, the whole area by the drain¬ age of which a river is fed; an area or basin of water re¬ ceiving running streams, but which itself has no outlet to the sea or ocean. To catch the meaning, to understand the sense or import. To catch the eye, to arrest the at¬ tention of one who is looking. To catch up, to inter¬ rupt; to answer suddenly. — Syn. of ‘catch, v.’: to seize; snatch; grasp; gripe; fasten upon; charm; please; com¬ municate. CATCH: a short piece of music written generally in three or four parts. It is a sort of short canon, the second voice taking up the theme when the first has completed the first phrase, the third following the second in same manner. These compositions are most frequently of a humorous and bacchanalian character, and have been from Purcell’s time very popular in England. CATCH-FLY, n. kdch-fli [catch and fly]: common Eng¬ lish name of several elegant flowering plants of the nat. ord. Caryophyllacece — as Silene Armenia, S. Anglica, Lych¬ nis Viscaria, etc. — which being clammy, in consequence of CATCH-POLL— CATECHISE. a peculiar exudation on the calyx, on the joints of the stem, etc., often prove fatal to insects settling upon them: see Lychnis and Silene. The name is sometimes employed by botanists as a sort of popular equivalent to Silene.— Dioncea muscipula is sometimes called the Carolina Catch- fly : see Dioncea. CATCH-POLL, or Catch-pole, n. kdch'pol [ catch and poll, the head: OF. chacepol, an officer of taxes — from mid. L. cachepo'lus, a collector of taxes] : in England, a sheriff’s officer, or bailiff ; a sergeant ; one employed to apprehend a person ; so called, it is said, because of the custom of catch¬ ing the victim by the poll or head. CATCHUP, n. ktich'tip, or Catsup, n. kilts' tip [of E. I. origin]: a sauce made from mushrooms; ketchup. CATE, n. kat, plur. form Cates, katz, more usual ; pro¬ visions, food, especially delicacies. CATEAU, Le, leh kd-to', or Cateau-Cambresis, kd-to'- kdng-bra-ze ' or kong-bra-se' : town of France, dept, of Nord; on the Selle, 14 m. e.s.e. of Cambrai. Cateau has manu¬ factures of shawls, merinoes, calicoes, and leather; it has also breweries and distilleries. It is noted as the place where, in 1559, the treaty known as that of Cateau-Cam¬ bresis was concluded between Henri II. of France and Phil¬ ip II. of Spain, by which the former monarch ceded to the latter Savoy, Corsica, and nearly 200 forts in Italy and the Low Countries.

CATECHESIS, ktit-e-ke'sis, the science which teaches the proper method of instructing beginners in the prin¬ ciples of the Christian religion by question and answer, which is called the catechetical method. Hence catechist and catechize. The art of the catechist consists in being able to elicit and develop the ideas of the youthful mind. This part of religious science was first cultivated in modern times, and Rosenm filler, Daub, Winter, Heinrich, Muller, Schwarz, Palmer, and others, have particularly distin¬ guished themselves by their writings upon it. CATECHISE, v. kafe-kiz [id. L. catechizare, to cate¬ chise — from Gr. katechizein , to instruct ; katechesis, instruc¬ tion by wrord of mouth, instruction in the elements of a science — from kata, down ; echos, a sound, hence a resound¬ ing] : to instruct or examine by asking questions and receiv¬ ing answers; to interrogate; to try by asking questions. Cat'echising, imp. : N. the act of Instructing by question and answer; interrogation. Cat'echised, pp. -kizd. Cat'- echiser, n. one who. Cat'echism, n. -kizm, a book on any subject arranged for instruction in the form of question and answer. Cat'echist, n. one who instructs in the prin¬ ciples of religion; a catechiser. Catechis'tic, a. -kis'tik, or Cat'echis'tical, a. -ti-ktil, imparting instruction by way of question and answer. Cat'echetTc, a. ket'lk, or Cat'- echet'ical, a. after the manner of a catechism. Cat'- echet'ically, ad. -Zb Catechetical schools, schools of theological instruction in the Christian Church of the CATECHISM. early centuries, among which those at Antioch and Alex¬ andria were famous. Cat'echu'men, n . -ku' men, in the anc. church, one not yet fully instructed in the principles of Christianity, but under instruction; one being prepared for baptism. CATECHISM, kdt'e-kizm: system of teaching by ques¬ tion and answer; also a book used in such teaching. Catechisms have long formed one of the principal means employed for popular instruction in the truths and duties of the Christian religion. The composition of the first catechisms was probably suggested by the ordinary oral instruction of catechumens, and was intended for the help both of teachers and of pupils. It appears to have been in the 8th and 9th c. that the first regular catechisms were compiled, of which that by Kero, a monk of St. Gall, and that ascribed to Otfried of Weissenburg, are among the most noted. At later periods, the use of catechisms pre¬ vailed chiefly among the opponents of the hierarchy, as among the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the Wickliffites, and, above all, among the Bohemian Brethren. The term catechism appears to have been first used in its present sense among the latter. Early in the Reformation, the reformers began to avail themselves of this method of popular instruction, and their catechisms became impor¬ tant instruments in that great religious movement. In 1520, Luther published his first short catechism. In 1525, Justus Jonas and John Agricola were intrusted with the preparation of a catechism. In 1529, Luther published his Larger and Smaller Catechisms, which found a place among the symbolical books or standards of the Lutheran churches. A number of catechisms were published also by the Swiss reformers, and by those of England and other countries. The Geneva catechisms, Larger and Smaller, were the work of Calvin. They were published 1536, were speedily translated into various lan¬ guages, and became acknowledged standards of the Re¬ formed churches, not only in Switzerland but in the Low Countries, in France, and in Hungary. The Church of Geneva has set aside the authority of these catechisms. The Zurich catechism is received as a standard in the Church of Zurich. The Heidelberg or Palatinate cate¬ chism is of greater importance, however, than any other as a standard of the Swiss Reformed churches. It was compiled by the Heidelberg theologians, Caspar Olevian and Zacharias Ursinus, at the request of the elector Fred¬ eric III. of the Palatinate; it was published 1563, was approved by several synods, and was subjected to a re¬ vision by the Synod of Dort. — In the Cath. Church the Tridentine catechism is of high authority. It was prepared in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent, by Abp. Leon. Marino, Bp. ASgidius Foscorari, and the Portuguese Dominican, Francis Fureiro; revised by Cardinals Borromeo, Sirlet, and Antonian, and sanc¬ tioned by Pope Pius V.; published Rome 1566. — The cate¬ chism of the Orthodox Greek Church was prepared by ’( CATECHISM. Peter Mogilas, metropolitan in Kiew, and published 1642. It received authority as a standard or symbolical book from a synod at Jerusalem 1672. It is often called the Larger Russian catechism, to distinguish it from the Small¬ er catechism prepared by order of Peter the Great. — Be¬ sides these catechisms, which have historic interest, or are important from their symbolical character, there have appeared at all periods, since the Reformation, many others, Protestant and Rom. Cath., some doctrinal, some controversial, some devoted to particular subjects, as the sacraments, or to particular purposes, as the prepara¬ tion of candidates for admission to the Lord’s Supper, some adapted to the mental capacity of very young children, etc. The catechism of the Church of England, in its most fa¬ miliar form, is the smaller one published in the Book of Common Prayer. It is in two parts: the first contains and explains the baptismal covenant, the creed, the ten commandments, and the Lord’s prayer; the second ex-, plains the two sacraments, baptism and the Lord’s Supper. It is not known with certainty who was the author of the first part; probably Cranmer and Ridley had the prin¬ cipal hand in framing the questions and answers. It was originally put forth with 42 Articles in the reign of Edward VI., and condemned as heretical in the reign of Mary. It must not be confounded with Cranmer’s cate¬ chism, which was a larger work, differently arranged, and translated chiefly from the German catechism used in Nuremberg. This first part of the church catechism is spoken of as the Shorter Catechism. There was a larger church catechism compiled also in the reign of Edward VI., by Ponet, as is supposed, and it corresponds in some degree with the smaller work above described. It was afterward revised and enlarged by Noel, dean of St. Paul’s, and published 1570; and, though never officially promulated by the church, it has some authority from having been approved by the lower house of convocation. At the Hampton Court Conference, in the reign of James I., the Shorter catechism was consid¬ ered too short, and the larger one of Noel’s too long; and accordingly, at the king’s suggestion, an addition was made to the former of that explanation of the two sacra¬ ments which now forms the second part of the church catechism. This was drawn up by Dr. Overall. The whole is a work much esteemed by all sections of the church as remarkable for its simplicity, truth, and catholicity. It, however, states the baptismal theory in a way not acceptable to the low church party. The rubrics in the Common Prayer Book enjoin the teaching of the catechism in the church on Sundays and holidays after the second lesson at evening prayer, and the 59th canon contains a like injunction, imposing penalties on the clergy who neglect this. The custom of catechising in the church had fallen into almost universal disuse, but in many parishes it has been revived with excellent results. Vol. 7 — 36 CATECHU. The Larger and Shorter Catechisms, which, with the Westminster Confession of Faith, constitute the standards or symbolical books of the Presb. churches throughout the British empire and the United States, were compiled by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster (q.v.) — the Short¬ er Catechism ‘to be a directory for catechising such as are of weaker capacity; the Larger Tor catching such as have made some proficiency in the knowledge of the Christian religion.’ The Shorter Catechism was presented to the English house of commons, 1647, Nov. 5; the Larger, 1648, Apr. 14, and 1648, July, both received the sanction of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland — the gen¬ eral assembly, in the act approving of the Larger Catechism, declaring it to be a rich treasure for increasing knowl¬ edge among the people of God/ and that ‘they bless the Lord that so excellent a catechism has been prepared.’ The Shorter Catechism has, however, been far more gen¬ erally used for the purpose of instruction than the Larger, which has been generally felt to be too minute in its state¬ ments, and too burdensome to the memory to be employed as a catechism. Even the Shorter Catechism is regarded by many, who substantially adhere to its doctrine, as carrying the statement of dogmatic theology beyond what is proper for elementary instruction, while it has been long felt to be unsuitable for the very young and the very ignorant, and its use is now almost always preceded by that of catechisms more adapted to their capacity. Its influence, however, has been very great in forming the religious opinions, and in exercising and training the intellectual faculties, wherever Presbyterianism has prevailed; for it has been, and still is, in almost universal use among Presbyterians speaking the English language; and in for¬ mer days had extensive use among Independents or Congre- gationalists both in Britain and in America ; the Congrega- tionalists have now largely discontinued its public or offi¬ cial use. In Holland, also, a translation of it has been much used. It is generally regarded, by those whose doctrinal views are in accordance with it, as an admirable compend of Christian doctrine and duty. — The authorship of the Westminster Assembly’s catechisms has been the subject of much debate, or at least the authorship of the first drafts of them, it being admitted that they were prepared with great care by committees of the assembly. But it seems probable that their authorship is to be ascribed entirely to these committees, and that like the Westminster Confession of Faith, they are thus the result of the joint labors of many. From discoveries made by the late Dr. M’Crie it seems probable that at least the plan or scheme of the Shorter Catechism is to be ascribed to Herbert Palmer (1601-47). CATECHU, n. Mt'e-shu , or Cutch, n. kuch [said to be from Japanese cate , a tree, and chu, juice]: dry brown ex¬ tract used both as a coloring matter and medicinally as an astringent. The Catechu of commerce is obtained chiefly from East Indian trees, such as the Catechu tree ( Acacia Catechu), betel-nut, etc. It is known in India by the name CATECHUMENS— CATEGOREMATIC. Kutt. Cutch is another form, and is a common commer¬ cial name. The aqueous extract of the wood, fruit and leaves is evaporated to a syrup which solidifies on cooling. Cutch is brittle and can readily be broken into fragments ; is soluble in water, and possesses an astringent taste, but no odor. It is chiefly employed in cotton dyeing for the production of brown shades, in conjunction with potassium bichromate. It is also used in medicine, in tanning and for coloring fishing nets and sails and rendering them less liable to rot. The chief constituent of Cutch is catechin, a white crystalline powdermelting at 217° C. Kino (q.v) is sometimes confounded with catechu. Terra Japonica, or Japan Earth (see Terra) is an old name for Catechu, not quite disused, given to it on the supposition of its being an earthy substance from Japan. CATECHUMENS, Mt-e-ku'mlnz [see Catechize]: In the early Christian Church those converted Jews and heathens who had not yet received baptism, but were under preparatory training and instruction. They had a place assigned in the congregation, but were not permitted to be present at the Lord’s Supper. In the apostolic age, con¬ verts appear to have been at once admitted to the ordi¬ nances; but afterward, with the growth of sacramentarian views, a period of probation wTas required. The Catechu¬ mens were in different classes or grades, according to pro¬ ficiency ; those of the lowest grade were not permitted to be present during the prayers of the congregation; and those only of the highest, and who had been declared fit to be baptized at the next administration of the ordinance, were permitted to witness the Lord’s Supper. — The term Catechumens was afterward employed to designate young members of the Christian Church who were receiving instruction to prepare them for the Lord’s Supper, and it is still often used in this sense. CATECHUMENS, House of: an institution in Rome for the conversion of Jews, founded by the Vatican, 1548, March 21, and to whose support the Jews were obliged to contribute by certain taxes. Forcible conversions followed in large numbers, often either from fear or for the sake of profit. In later years, when conversions were less numerous, Jews were compelled to listen to sermons against Judaism — a custom that continued until more recent decades. In 1604, the chief rabbi of Rome was obliged to enter the House, called Casa dei Neofiti, with his four children, who were baptized. If voluntary con¬ versions did not follow entrance into the Casa, force was applied, ending in hanging; if baptism were accepted, the government added a sum to the amount derived from the Jewish taxes. The house survived until late in the 18th century. In 1810, the Jewish taxes were abolished: see Abraham’s Jewish Life in the Middle Ages ; Vogelstein und Rieger, Gesch. der Jud. in Rom. CATEGOREMATIC: a word used in logic to designate a term which can stand alone as the subject of a propo- CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE— CATEGORIES. sition or sentence. Such a word is any noun, any adjec¬ tive, or any proposition used substantively. Categorematic terms are to be distinguished from syncate-gorematic. The latter can stand as subjects of propositions only when used in company with other words. Prepositions, conjunctions, adjectives used adjectively are syncate- gorematic. 'Oil’ is an example of the one term, ‘oily’ i of the other. CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE: an expression em¬ ployed by the philosopher Kant in presenting what he believes to be the valid claim of conscience to recognition as a supreme and final standard of conduct. Conscience is an imperative because it is a law — a law of rational self development through freely chosen conduct. Conscience speaks as having authority. Duty refuses to stoop to mere inclination, and demands that inclination bend to it. Again, as a law, conscience asserts that its deliverances have a true claim to universality and necessity such as are accorded to scientific formulae. Yet as a moral law, conscience presents its imperative in form, different from that in which ordinary scientific laws appear. Natural law operates blindly and without regard to the worth of its object. Conscience exercises its imperative through a rational appeal to man's intelligent nature. Hence, al¬ though the moral law operates as inevitably as natural law, it applies only within the sphere of choice and by means of unveiling to the intelligence of man the basic principles of his normal self-development. Conscience is categorical or unconditioned inasmuch as it asserts that its judgments of conduct are final and supreme. Virtue, i.e. conscientiously guided volition, is always an end in itself and never a means to anything else. In other words there is nothing in the whole realm of existence that, in value, can be put above a good life or even beside it. The realization of such a life conscience lays upon every rational being as an unconditional obligation. For these reasons the dictates of conscience are best described, according to the opinion of Kant, as categorical imper¬ atives : see Kant. CATEGORIES, kdt'e-go-nz, in Logic: a designation that has come down from the time of Aristotle. One of the books of his Organon or logical system is so named. The Categories or Predicaments, as the schoolmen called them, are an attempt at a comprehensive classification of all that exists, for the purposes of logical affirmation, proof, or disproof. The entire universe may be classified in various ways — as into things celestial and terrestrial; into matter and spirit : into organized and unorganized ; into minerals, plants, animals, etc. But the classification contemplated under the Categories proceeds on the very general proper¬ ties or attributes that most extensively pervade all existing things, although in unequal degrees. A good example of such properties is quantity, which pertains to everything that we know or can think of. Below is the Aristotelian enumeration — the first column is the original Greek; the CATEGORIES. second, the Latin rendering of the schoolmen ; the third, the nearest corresponding English words: Ovtria, IIoow, notov, npos rt, notety, na<rx«iv, now, IIoTe, KettrOai, Exet*', Substantia, Quantitas, Qualitas, Kelatio, Actio, Passio, Ubi, Quando, Situs, Habitus, Substance. Quantity. Quality. Relation. Action. Passivity. Position in Space. Position in Time. Situation. Possession. John Stuart Mill has the following remarks on the above scheme: ‘The imperfections of this classification are too obvious to require, and its merits are not sufficient to re¬ ward, a minute examination. It is a mere catalogue of the distinctions rudely marked out by the language of familiar life, with little or no attempt to penetrate, by philosophical analysis, to the rationale even of these com¬ mon distinctions. Such an analysis, however superficially conducted, would have shown the enumeration to be both redundant and defective. Some objects are admitted and others repeated several times under different heads. It is like a division of animals into men, quadrupeds, horses, asses, and ponies. That, for instance, could not be a very comprehensive view of the nature of relation, which could exclude action, passivity, and local situation from the category. The same observation applies to position in time and position in space, while the distinction between the latter and situation is merely verbal.’ — Logic , book i., chap, iii., §. 1. While these remarks of Mill are essentially just, it 's none the less true that Aristotle was at work upon a vital problem and one that modern philosophy has but emphasized and deepened. For inasmuch as science in its devotion to the study of concrete facts and their laws overlooks the great general principles and fea¬ tures of its world, metaphysics has been driven to under¬ take this study for itself. Only in this manner can the background and perspectives of the masses of scientific facts be determined. These underlying principles which show themselves everywhere in the concrete natures of things are known by the name of categories when we seek to classify them, to discover their inner characteristics, and to relate them one to another into some definite system. That the earlier descriptions of them should be somewhat crude and meagre was a thing inevitable be¬ cause of the simpler character of man’s life and his knowl¬ edge of his world. As human knowledge penetrated more fully into the secrets of its environment the demand for an increasing number of categories and for a more exact and complete account of them became insistent. That a critical inquiry into first principles is not to be avoided either by science or philosophy was made quite plain by the immortal work of Kant. He too furnishes us with a list of first principles. They are the following: 1. Quantity, inducting unity, multiplicity, totality: CATEGORY— CATEL. 2. Quality, including reality, negation, limitation; 3. Relation, including substance and accident, cause and effect, action and reaction; 4. Modality, including possi¬ bility, existence, necessity. If one takes the four main categories into consideration he sees at once how impor¬ tant the problem contained in them is, and how immediate¬ ly related it is to science. For it is self-evident that our scientific forms of classifying facts lead ultimately into their division into phenomena of quantity or of quality. Again, all facts subsist in relation one to another and are interdependent or modal in a single system or whole. Kant’s categories are simply an overt recognition of four fundamental ways of describing the world which is com¬ mon to the everyday man, the scientist, and the philoso¬ pher. This fourfold view breaks up into as many different sub-categories as there are minor points of view and minor principles discriminated by experience or by science. Of these Kant designated 12 which have played an im¬ portant part each of them in modern conceptions of the world. A very elaborate inventory of the categories was made by Hegel, and a persistent endeavor also made to analyze them thoroughly. Since his day both philoso¬ phers and scientists have been working upon the same problem perhaps with more completeness of detail, inas¬ much as science has developed marvellously during the East century. They, however, have shown a considerably jss thorough grasp of the necessity for understanding the precise relationships of the categories one to another, and of obtaining by means of their organization a thor¬ oughly systematized insight into the general nature of the world. In ordinary parlance, category means any general classification of things. To understand to what category anything belongs is to know how to classify it. CATEGORY-, n. ktit'e-gor-l [Gr. kategdrlti, an accusation — from kata, against; agoreuo , I speak in an assembly]: in logic , the general head of a class, to one among a certain number of which anything whatever is referable; a class; an order of ideas (see Categories); predicament.

His earliest efforts were designs for illustrated almanacs. He then painted in oil and water colors, and took up his abode in Rome in 1812. Overbeck, Schadow, and Cornelius gave him much encouragement, and he painted historical and genre pieces and landscapes, in which last-named department of his art he was especially successful. During a residence in Sicily, about the year 1818, he painted a large number of CATENA — CATERAN. views of Mount iEtna, and other prominent places on the island. He died rich, directing his fortune to be in¬ vested for the benefit of poor artists. CATENA, n. k&t'e-na [L. catena, a chain]: a chain or series of things connected with each other; in music, a chain, or succession, of short instrumental shakes. CATENATE, v. k&tfZ-nat [L. catena, a chain]: to con¬ nect, as a series of links in a chain. Catenating, imp. Catenated, pp. Cat'ena'tion, n. -no! shun, regular connection, as the links of a chain. Cat'enary, a. -ner-i, relating to a chain; also Cat'ena'rian, a. - na'ri-dn ; Catenulate, a. kd-ten' u-lat, put together like the links of a chain. CATENARY: the curve formed by a flexible homo¬ geneous cord hanging freely between two points of sup¬ port, and acted on by no other force than gravity. If the cord is not homogeneous, and the density varies in any regular way, the cord hangs in a curve slightly differ¬ ent from the ordinary catenary. The catenary possesses several remarkable properties, one of which is that its centre of gravity (q.v.) is lower than that of any curve of equal perimeter, and with the same fixed points for its extremities. Where the cord is such that the weight of any part of it is proportioned to its horizontal pro¬ jection, the curve is a parabola (q.v.). The latter curve and the ordinary catenary are of importance chiefly in the theory of suspension bridges (q.v.). For the pro¬ perties of the catenary curve, fully analyzed, see the lead¬ ing works on mechanics.

CATENIPORA, n. plu. kdtfenAp'8-rd, or Catenipores, n. plu. kd-ten'l-pors [L. catena, a chain; pdrus, a channel, a pore]: genus of fossil lamelliferous corals peculiar to Palaeozoic strata; easily recognized. The cells are ter¬ minal and oval, arranged like a loose network of chains, hence called ‘chain coral/ or ‘chainpore coral.’ Ver¬ tical anastomosing lamellae united the cells together, and formed a hemispherical polypidom, sometimes of great size.

CATERPILLAR, n. kdtf er-ptt'ler [OE. cates, food; F. piller, to plunder. Note. — Skeat suggests OF. chate, a she-cat; and CF. pelouse ; It. peloso, hairy — from L. pilosus, hairy — thus signifying ‘a hairy she-cat;’ it may perhaps have been named from its resemblance to the catkins of a nut]: name given to the larvae of lepidopterous in¬ sects — butterflies, moths, and hawk-moths. Caterpillars exhibit as great differences as subsist among the perfect insects into which they change; and the family, genus, and species may be determined by the characters of the C. as well as of the perfect insect. Their body is gen¬ erally long, nearly cylindrical, soft, and consisting of twelve rings or segments besides the head, with nine spiracles or small openings for respiration on each side. The head is much harder than the rest of the body, of almost horny substance, and has six small shining points on each side, regarded as simple or stemmatic eyes, and is also furnished with two very short rudimentary an¬ tennae. The mouth is adapted for tearing, cutting, and masticating the substances on which the C. is destined to feed, which are very various in the different species, although in all extremely different from the food of the perfect insect; it is provided with two strong mandi¬ bles, or upper jaws; two maxillce, or lower jaws; a labium, or lower lip; and four palpi, or feelers. In the mouth also is situated the spinneret of those species which, when they change into the chrysalis or pupa state, envelop themselves in silken cocoons: see Silk-worm. The first three segments of the body are each furnished with a pair of feet, which are hard and scaly, and represent the six feet of the perfect insect; some of the remaining segments also are furnished with feet, varying in all from four to ten in number, the last pair situated at the pos¬ terior extremity of the body; but these feet are soft and membranous or fleshy, and armed at their extremity with a sort of circlet of minute hooks. All the feet or legs are very short. Those caterpillars in which the pro¬ legs, as they are sometimes called, or supplementary soft feet, are nearly equally distributed along the body, move by a sort of regular crawling motion; but those which have only four such feet, situated near the posterior extremity, move by alternately taking CATERPILLAR-CATCHER, hold by what may be called their fore-feet and their hind feet, now stretching the body out to its full length, and now bending it into an arch, while the hinder part is brought forward almost into contact with the forepart. Caterpillars which move in this way are calied geometers or loopers. Some caterpillars have the power of lixing themselves by the two hind feet to a twig, and stretching themselves out as straight as a rod, so that, being in color Caterpillars of Butterflies. a. silver- washed fritillary; 6, swallow-tailed; c, chalk-hill blue; d , purple emperor. very like a twig of the tree on the leaves of which they feed, they are not readily observed. The muscular power required for this position of rest is very great, and Lyonnet found the number of muscles in a C. to be more than 4,000. The skin of some caterpillars is naked, that of others is covered with hairs, spines, or tubercles. Some make for themselves nests or tents of silk, under which they dwell in societies, protected from the inclemency of the weather. Many construct cases or sheaths by aggluti¬ nating various substances together, as the C. of the common cloth es-moth. Some roll together leaves, and fix them by threads, so forming a dwelling for themselves; and a few buiTOW and excavate galleries in the substance of leaves. Many feed on leaves, many being limited to a particular kind of plant, or to a few nearly-allied plants. Some feed on flowers, some on seeds, some on roots, and some even on the woody portions of stems; some on wool, hides, furs, and other animal substances; a few on lard, and other kinds of fat. The admirable harmony pervading all nature is ’llustrated in the adjustment of the time of each kind of C.’s appearance to that of the leaf or flower on which it is to feed. CATERPILLAR CATCHER: a bird belonging to the Shrike family, living mainly on caterpillars; a sub-family of Ampelidce (Chatterers), found ckiefly in the warmer parts of the eastern hemisphere, though one genus is American. CATERWAUL— CATGUT. CATERWAUL, v. Mt'er-wawl' [from cat, and waul, to cry as a cat] : to make a noise, as cats at night under the influence of the sexual instinct; to make a harsh, disagree¬ able noise. Cat'erwaul'ing, imp. : N. a loud, disagreeable noise made by cats. Cat'erwauled, pp. wawld. CATES, n. plu. kats [said to be a mere abbreviation of delicates or delicacies (see Cater)]: dainties; cakes; nice food. CAT-FISH, kdtfish: of the family Siluridm, genus Pimelodus; marked by a slimy skin without scales, and eight fleshy barbules on the head. Some 50 varieties exist, and 16 or more in the inland waters of the United States. The commonest is the horned pout or bullhead, P. atra- rius, which has sharp spines adjoining the pectoral tin; these it can stiffen at will into a formidable weapon. This species is small, but much used for food. Another variety, P. pimapterus, familiar in the e. and middle states, has no ventral fins. Larger species are found in the lakes, P. nigricans and P. ccenosus; in the n. P. borealis; in Del., P. albidus; in La., P. punctulatus ; and under various names in the Oh"
