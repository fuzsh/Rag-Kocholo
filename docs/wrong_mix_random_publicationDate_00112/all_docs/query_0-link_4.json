Our country shelters every person whose life is in danger - regardless of their nationality.\n\nThe dominant group of refugees in Poland are citizens of Ukraine, but among the people checked by the Border Guard are also citizens of the USA, Nigeria, India, Georgia and other countries.\n\nAll persons admitted to Poland are verified by the Border Guard. In relation to those who are in doubt, e.g. do not have documents, Border Guard officers apply appropriate checking procedures.\n\nNo person who has received refuge in Poland will be sent back to a country torn by war.\n\nEdinburgh: November 4 (unchanged)\n\nBahrain: November 15 (from September 15); second daily service from January 1\n\nKuwait: November 15 (from September 16)\n\nMumbai: January 1 (from October 27)\n\nAhmedabad: January 1 (from October 27)\n\nColombo: January 2 (from January 1)\n\nMuscat: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nLyon: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nBologna: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nSource: Emirates\n\nTomato and walnut salad\n\nA lesson in simple, seasonal eating. Wedges of tomato, chunks of cucumber, thinly sliced red onion, coriander or parsley leaves, and perhaps some fresh dill are drizzled with a crushed walnut and garlic dressing. Do consider yourself warned: if you eat this salad in Georgia during the summer months, the tomatoes will be so ripe and flavourful that every tomato you eat from that day forth will taste lacklustre in comparison.\n\nBadrijani nigvzit\n\nA delicious vegetarian snack or starter. It consists of thinly sliced, fried then cooled aubergine smothered with a thick and creamy walnut sauce and folded or rolled. Take note, even though it seems like you should be able to pick these morsels up with your hands, they’re not as durable as they look. A knife and fork is the way to go.\n\nPkhali\n\nThis healthy little dish (a nice antidote to the khachapuri) is usually made with steamed then chopped cabbage, spinach, beetroot or green beans, combined with walnuts, garlic and herbs to make a vegetable pâté or paste. The mix is then often formed into rounds, chilled in the fridge and topped with pomegranate seeds before being served."
