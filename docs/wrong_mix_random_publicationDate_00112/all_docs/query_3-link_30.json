She knew the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest and the Ozarks – home to her grandparents – very well from an early age. In 1977, she met Raymond Carver. He was a master of the short story, and inspired her to write three short story collections of her own. For 11 years they were friends, lovers, editors, and sounding boards. Carver became her third husband, and she his second wife, just six weeks before his death from lung cancer at age 50. Gallagher manages his literary estate. Her poetry collections include Under Stars, Amplitude, Moon Crossing Bridge (poems in remembrance of Raymond Carver), Midnight Lantern, and Is, Is Not Poems.\n\nNow that I am Never Alone\n\nby Tess Gallagher\n\n.\n\nIn the bath I look up and see the brown moth\n\npressed like a pair of unpredictable lips\n\nagainst the white wall. I heat up\n\nthe water, running as much hot in as I can stand.\n\nThese handfuls over my shoulder—how once\n\nhe pulled my head against his thigh and dipped\n\na rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring\n\nwe were drinking from. Beautiful mischief\n\nthat stills a moment so I can never look\n\nback. Only now, brightest now, and the water\n\nnever hot enough to drive that shiver out.\n\n.\n\nBut I remember solitude—no other\n\npresence and each thing what it was. Not this raw\n\nfluttering I make of you as you have made of me\n\nyour watch-fire, your killing light.\n\n.\n\n“Now that I am Never Alone” from Moon Crossing Bridge, © 1992 by Tess Gallagher – Graywolf Press\n\n________________________________\n\n1945 – Wendy Cope born in the Erith area of southeast London; English poet for both adults and children, journalist, and editor. She read history at St. Hilda’s College, Oxford, then worked for several years as a primary-school teacher. Her husband Lachlan Mackinnon is also a poet.

She has also edited several poetry anthologies.\n\nDifferences of Opinion\n\nby Wendy Cope\n\n.\n\n1.\n\nHE TELLS HER\n\n.\n\nHe tells her that the earth is flat —\n\nHe knows the facts, and that is that.\n\nIn altercations fierce and long\n\nShe tries her best to prove him wrong.\n\nBut he has learned to argue well.\n\nHe calls her arguments unsound\n\nAnd often asks her not to yell.\n\nShe cannot win.

Her mother was related to Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Lazarus, privately educated by tutors, studied American and British literature, and German, French, and Italian. In the 1880s, Lazarus was an advocate for Jewish refugees fleeing from Russian pogroms. Appalled by the refugees’ miserable living conditions, she volunteered at the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and helped establish the Hebrew Technical Institute (1884-1939), a vocational high school. She wrote “The New Colossus” in 1883 for a fundraiser for the pedestal to support France’s gift of a statue for New York Harbor. She died in 1887, the year after “Liberty Enlightening the World” (the statue’s original title) was dedicated. Though her poem had been published in the New York Times, it was forgotten until 1901, when her friend Georgina Schuyler began a campaign for the poem to be memorialized. In 1903, the words were placed on the inner wall of the statue’s base, and changed forever the perception of the Lady with the Lamp.\n\nThe New Colossus\n\nby Emma Lazarus\n\n.\n\nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\n\nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\n\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n\n“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she\n\nWith silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!”\n\n________________________________\n\n1939 ― Quincy Troupe, African-American poet, editor, journalist, UC San Diego professor emeritus, and children’s book author, born in St. Louis Missouri. The son of professional baseball player Quincy Thomas Trouppe. Known for his memoir Miles and Me; The Pursuit of Happyness, co-authored with Chris Gardner; The Architecture of Language, winner of the 2007 Paterson Award for Sustained Literary Achievement; and Transcircularities, which won the 2003 Milt Kessler Poetry Award.

He worked for the British Museum as a printed book supernumerary assistant (1846-1865). Patmore wrote poetry in his spare time, and published his first book in 1844, but its success was limited, and he was upset by harsh reviews. He didn’t publish his next book until 1853. The Angel in the House, a long narrative poem for which he is best remembered, was published in four parts between 1854 and 1863. It was a sentimental portrait of the Victorian ideal of Woman as wife and mother making a happy marriage. He was devastated when his wife Emily (who wrote three books under the pen name ‘Mrs. Motherly’), after giving birth to six children, died in 1862 at age 38, after a long decline from tuberculosis. Patmore married Marianne in 1864, but she died in 1880, and then he married Harriet, his children’s former governess, in 1881. Patmore died in 1896 at age 73.\n\nMagna Est Veritas\n\n(great is truth)\n\n.\n\nby Coventry Patmore\n\n.\n\nHere, in this little Bay,\n\nFull of tumultuous life and great repose,\n\nWhere, twice a day,\n\nThe purposeless, gay ocean comes and goes,\n\nUnder high cliffs, and far from the huge town,\n\nI sit me down.\n\nFor want of me the world's course will not fail:\n\nWhen all its work is done, the lie shall rot;\n\nThe truth is great, and shall prevail,\n\nWhen none cares whether it prevail or not.\n\n________________________________\n\n1941 – Kim Jong-haeborn in Busan, South Korea; Korean poet, sailor, and publisher. In his 20s, he was a ship’s crew member, which he later wrote about in his poetry collection Sailing Days, but his literary career began in 1963, when he won the Jayu Munhak New Writer's Contest with his poem \"Jeonyeok\" (Evening). He was a founding member of the journal Sinnyeondae, and became secretary general of the Korean Poets’ Association, director of the Korean Publishing Culture Association, and co-founder with his brother of the publishing company Munhaksegyesa.

By age eight, she could play Mozart on the piano. In 1955, some of her poems were privately circulated among French writers and publishers, causing controversy over whether they were written by the 8-year old Minou or by her foster mother. A test was set up. Minou was given the subject ‘Paris Sky’ and left alone in a room with only a pen and paper. Just 25 minutes later, she had completed her poem. Her first book of poems sold 40,000 copies, and she was lionized by Maurice Chevalier, Vittorio de Sica, Pablo Casals, and Jean Cocteau. By the time she was in her early 20s, she was married and leading a bohemian life on the Left Bank. But when her grandmother fell ill, she took care of her until her death. She decided to become a nurse, and cared for the elderly, terminally ill children, and pregnant women. By her early 30s, she was divorced and caring for her foster mother, diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, back in her small home town in Brittany.

He was the son of a well-to-do French lawyer and an English mother, Elizabeth Rayner Parkes, who was a writer. The family fled to England in 1870 when news came of the French army’s collapse, returning after the war’s end to discover that their home had been looted and vandalized by Prussian soldiers. After his father died in 1872, and the family fortune was nearly wiped out in a stock-market crash, his mother brought her children back to England. Hilaire was sent to Cardinal Newman Catholic School in Hove. In 1892, he joined the French Artillery Service in France for a year. Returning to England, Belloc became a student at Baillol College, Oxford, and began writing for London newspapers and magazines. In 1896, his first book Verses and Sonnets appeared, followed by The Bad Child’s Book of Beasts, which satirized moralistic verse for children and became immensely popular. Belloc wrote in almost every form except drama, but his most enduring successes were in children’s poetry. He served as a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons while editor of the Morning Post. Later, he was editor of The Eye-Witness, a political weekly which attacked corruption and the political status quo, featuring contributions by George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Belloc’s friend, G.K. Chesterton. Chesterton and Belloc, both devout Catholics, shared the view of Europe as a near-utopia under Church authority during the Middle Ages. Shaw caricatured them in print as “the Chesterbelloc” a beast of elephant-like appearance and outmoded beliefs. Belloc also wrote novels and histories. During World War I, he worked for the War Propaganda Bureau and as a correspondent on the Western front. Just a staunchly as he had opposed the Boer War, he now staunchly supported Britain’s involvement in this war, even though he lost many friends, and his son, who was killed in combat. In the years that followed WWI, he wrote a series of historical biographies and religious texts. In 1942 he suffered a stroke, which left him debilitated for the next eleven years, until his death on July 16, 1953, nine days before his 83rd birthday.\n\nG Stands for GNU,\n\nby Hilaire Belloc\n\n.\n\nwhose weapons of Defence\n\nAre long, sharp, curling Horns, and Common-sense.\n\nTo these he adds a Name so short and strong,\n\nThat even Hardy Boers pronounce it wrong.\n\nHow often on a bright Autumnal day\n\nThe Pious people of Pretoria say,\n\n\"Come, let us hunt the—\" Then no more is heard\n\nBut Sounds of Strong Men struggling with a word.\n\nMeanwhile, the distant Gnu with grateful eyes\n\nObserves his opportunity, and flies.\n\n.\n\nMORAL:\n\nChild, if you have a rummy kind of name,\n\nRemember to be thankful for the same.\n\n“G Stands for GNU” from More Beasts (For Worse Children), by Hilaire Belloc, originally published in 1897\n\n_________________________________\n\nG’Morning/Afternoon/Evening MOTlies!\n\n_________________________________\n\n_____________________________________\n\n“My country, I will build you again.\n\nIf need be, with bricks made from my life …\n\nI will wash again the blood off your body\n\nWith torrents of my tears.\n\nOnce more, the darkness will leave this house …”\n\n— Simin Behbahani, ‘the Lioness of Iran’ –\n\nfrom “My Country, I Will Build You Again”\n\n_____________________________________\n\n“The public welfare demands that constitutional\n\ncases must be decided according to the terms of\n\nthe Constitution itself, and not according to judges’\n\nviews of fairness, reasonableness, or justice.

Her parents met because her mother, Fakhr-Ozmaa Arghoun, wrote a poem, and sent it to Nedaay-e-Islam’ the newspaper where her father, Abbas Khalili, who was also a poet, was editor-in-chief. He liked the poem, but was surprised to find the poet was a woman. This began their courtship. They married, but less than a month layer the political storm at the end of Ahmad Shah Qajar’s reign as Shah of Persia forced Khalili into exile, unaware that his new wife was already pregnant. Abbas Khalili did not see his daughter until she was 14-months-old, then didn’t see her again until she was eleven. Raised by her mother, who became known for her poetry, as a social activist, and as a founding member of the Iranian Committee of Nationalist Women. Her mother married another newspaper editor, Aadel Khalatbari, and changed her name to Fakhr Aadel. Behbahani started writing poetry at age 14, but felt too shy to show anyone her poems. Her mother found one, and not only encouraged her to write more, she also sent the poem she discovered to a literary editor she knew, who was amazed it was written by a 14-year-old. He published it in his newspaper under the name Simin Khalatbari. In 1941, Simin joined the Tudeh Party’s Youth Organization, a Communist group, which caused her trouble at school; when an anonymous report appeared in a newspaper criticizing the administration’s management of the school, she was immediately suspected, and was expelled. She married her first suitor, Hassan Behbahani, and from then on published her work as Simin Behbahani. There was conflict in the marriage almost from the beginning. She continued her studies, went to law school, then became a teacher, but her poetry brought her increasing recognition. She and her husband had two sons and a daughter during the 20 years they lived together, but they ultimately separated. In 2006, Iranian authorities shut down an opposition newspaper for printing one of her works, the same year she was hit by a policeman during an International Women’s Day rally. In 2010, about to board a plane for Paris, 82-year-old Simin Behbahani, now almost blind, was arrested andinterrogated for hours about her poems on Iran’s 2009 elections. Her passport was confiscated, and she was barred from leaving the country. No legal basis was given for the travel ban. Simin Behbahani earned her title, ‘the Lioness of Iran.’ She died of heart disease at age 87 in August 2014. Thousands came to honor her at her funeral.\n\nNecklace\n\nby Simin Behbahani\n\n.\n\nAnxious, agitated, sad,\n\nher face uncovered, her head unveiled,\n\nnot afraid of arrest or policeman,\n\noblivious to the order, “Cover!

He attended London’s prestigious St Paul’s School. Gilbert Keith (G. K.) Chesterton was a fellow student, and became his best friend. When Bentley was 16 years old, he started to write short verses about people he knew, or famous people he had read about, which became known as Clerihews. Chesterton took up the hobby too and the rhymes were often accompanied by his sketches. Clerihews have 4 lines, the subject’s name is in the first line, the rhyme scheme is AA/BB, it tells you something about the subject, and it should be amusing. In 1913, exasperated with the infallibility of Sherlock Holmes, he published Trent’s Last Case, regarded as the first “modern” detective novel. E.C. Bentley may be the only author credited with starting two literary forms, one in poetry and the other in genre fiction.

The feud led to Quevedo buying the house where Góngora was living, and then evicting him. Góngora became seriously ill, returned to Córdoba, and died there at age 65 in May 1627.

He was a Chilean diplomat, politician, author, and a poet whose poems were honored with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. He is considered the national poet of Chile. Neruda’s writing covered a wide range: historical epics, political manifestos, an autobiography, surrealist poems, and passionate love poetry. His first collection of verse, Crepusculario (Book of Twilights) was published in 1923 under his pen name, Pablo Neruda. Crepusculario was quickly followed in 1924 by Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada (Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song), which is still the best-selling book of poetry in the Spanish language. He was a member of Chilean diplomatic missions in Burma, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, and was in France when he ended his diplomatic career upon being diagnosed with cancer. He died Santiago in September 1973 at age 69. Pinochet, Chile’s military dictator who had just staged his coup d’état, refused permission for Neruda’s funeral to be public, but thousands of defiant mourners attended, surrounded by a massive police presence.\n\nCat's Dream\n\nby Pablo Neruda\n\n.\n\nHow neatly a cat sleeps,\n\nsleeps with its paws and its posture,\n\nsleeps with its wicked claws,\n\nand with its unfeeling blood,\n\nsleeps with all the rings –\n\na series of burnt circles –\n\nwhich have formed the odd geology\n\nof its sand-colored tail.\n\n.\n\nI should like to sleep like a cat,\n\nwith all the fur of time,\n\nwith a tongue rough as flint,\n\nwith the dry sex of fire;\n\nand after speaking to no one,\n\nstretch myself over the world,\n\nover roofs and landscapes,\n\nwith a passionate desire\n\nto hunt the rats in my dreams.\n\n.\n\nI have seen how the cat asleep\n\nwould undulate, how the night\n\nflowed through it like dark water;\n\nand at times,it was going to fall\n\nor possibly plunge into\n\nthe bare deserted snowdrifts.\n\nSometimes it grew so much in sleep\n\nlike a tiger's great-grandfather,\n\nand would leap in the darkness over\n\nrooftops, clouds and volcanoes.\n\n.\n\nSleep, sleep cat of the night\n\nwith episcopal ceremony\n\nand your stone-carved moustache.\n\nTake care of all our dreams\n\ncontrol the obscurity\n\nof our slumbering prowess\n\nwith your relentless heart\n\nand the great ruff of your tail.\n\n.\n\n“Cat’s Dream” from The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems, by Pablo Neruda – translated by Alastair Reid, © 2004 by City Lights Books and Fundación Pablo Neruda – City Lights Books, Bilingual Edition\n\n________________________________\n\n1969 – Briceida Cuevas Cob born in Tepakán, Kalkiní - Mayan poet who writes in Yucatecan Maya and then translates her work into Spanish.

Her father abandoned the family while she was still an infant, and they often had to stay wilt relatives. Charlotte was in and out of seven different schools, often missing days and weeks, and she left when she was 15. An avid reader, she spent much time at public libraries. She did learn painting at the Rhode Island School of Design, then supported herself painting cards, and tutoring. She is best known for her subtly terrifying short-story “The Yellow Wallpaper,” written after she suffered from post-partum depression during her first marriage, compounded by the complete forced isolation treatment which made her condition even worse. Her non-fiction works, such as Women and Economics, and The Home: Its Work and Influence, contributed much to feminist thought. From 1909-1916, Gilman single-handedly wrote and edited The Forerunner, a monthly magazine where many of her ideas first appeared. She produced 86 issues, each 28 pages long, for nearly 1,500 subscribers, from 1909 through 1916. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1932.

One of the most acclaimed and significant Russian poets of the 20th century, she remained in the USSR even after her work was condemned and censored by Stalinist authorities.
