Hammond\n\nMost biographies are ill adapted to serve as works of reference ± not surprisingly so, since the biographer is likely to regard his function as the devising of a continuous and readable narrative, with excursions into interpretation and speculation, rather than a bald recital of facts. There are times, however, when anyone reading for business or pleasure needs to check a point quickly or to obtain a rapid overview of part of an author's life or career; and at such moments turning over the pages of a biography can be a time-consuming and frustrating occupation. The present series of volumes aims at providing a means whereby the chronological facts of an author's life and career, rather than needing to be prised out of the narrative in which they are (if they appear at all) securely embedded, can be seen at a glance. Moreover, whereas biographies are often, and quite understandably, vague over matters of fact (since it makes for tediousness to be forever enumerating details of dates and places), a chronology can be precise whenever it is possible to be precise. Thanks to the survival, sometimes in very large quantities, of letters, diaries, notebooks and other documents, as well as to thoroughly researched biographies and bibliographies, this material now exists in abundance for many major authors. In the case of, for example, Dickens, we can often ascertain what he was doing in each month and week, and almost on each day, of his prodigiously active working life; and the student of, say, David Copperfield is likely to find it fascinating as well as useful to know just when Dickens was at work on each part of that novel, what other literary enterprises he was engaged in at the same time, whom he was meeting, what places he was visiting, and what were the relevant circumstances of his personal and professional life. Such a chronology is not, of course, a substitute for a biography; but its arrangement, in combination with its index, makes it a much more convenient tool for this kind of purpose; and it may be acceptable as a form of ix\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.

Since information relating to an author's early years is usually scanty and chronologically imprecise, the opening section of some volumes in this series groups together the years of childhood and adolescence. Thereafter each year, and usually each month, is dealt with separately. Information not readily assignable to a specific month or day is given as a general note under the relevant year or month. The first entry for each month carries an indication of the day of the week, so that when necessary this can be readily calculated for other dates. Each volume also contains a bibliography of the principal sources of information. In the chronology itself, the sources of many of the more specific items, including quotations, are identified, in order that the reader who wishes to do so may consult the original contexts.

As novelist, essayist, and author of a number of outstanding works of reportage, he has exercised an influence on modern thought which is increasingly being recognised. Though he died at the age of 46 he achieved world-wide fame during his lifetime and since his death his stature has grown immeasurably. Today he belongs to that select company of writers ± including Lawrence, Joyce and Kafka ± who have made a permanent contribution to modern literature. An essentially private man ± he could be aloof and taciturn in certain moods and had few really close friendships ± he requested in his will that no biography of him should be written. This request may have been prompted by a natural reticence, or possibly by a feeling that he had himself told all that was necessary of his life story in the autobiographical section of The Road to Wigan Pier. But such an odd request is entirely in keeping with his quixotic temperament. He was a man who `kept himself to himself', who attached little importance to material possessions and felt that his life was of value only in the sense that he was a writer. To him his literary work came before all else: before personal friendships, before his marriage, before his own health and happiness. `Writing a book', he observed, `is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.' He was indeed driven by a demon: a consuming passion to write which indirectly contributed to his death but which has earned for him a place alongside the great radical writers of the past. Commenting apropos Edgar Allan Poe ± another writer who died at an early age and whose life was dominated by ill health ± Philip Van Doren Stern observed: `He paid dearly for immortality, gave his whole life to attain it. But in his terms it was xi\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.

Much the same might be said of Orwell. One thinks of him struggling valiantly to finish Nineteen Eighty-Four while dying of tuberculosis, refusing to concede defeat. In common with Poe he was often miserably paid for his work yet today, ironically, his name is known and respected throughout the literary world and his books command a readership of millions. His life was a mass of contradictions. He was successively a tramp, a schoolmaster, a village-shopkeeper, a soldier, a radio producer and a sergeant in the Home Guard. He became a political writer of uncommon ability, an essayist in the tradition of Cobbett and Defoe and an outspoken commentator on the social and political issues of his time. He was also a man who was essentially English, a man who disliked twentiethcentury technology and wrote with simple feeling on gardening, wildlife and the passing of the seasons. A radical Socialist, he loved the quirkiness of such institutions as the Church of England and the monarchy. He was an old Etonian, yet wished to be accepted on equal terms by down-and-outs and the miners of Wigan. What is the significance of Blair's assumption of a nom de plume? It is important because the name itself and his adoption of it have been the subject of much critical speculation. The pseudonym was chosen with surprising casualness. In November 1932, when his first book Down and Out in Paris and London was already in proof, the name had still not been chosen. He wrote diffidently to his agent suggesting that the book should be published pseudonymously. Too much should not be read into the choice of the name itself. It is true that `George' has an Englishness about it, suggesting plain speaking and common sense, and that `Orwell' was the name of a river he was fond of, but it has to be remembered that the name was selected by Gollancz from a short list submitted by Blair; the publisher might equally well have chosen `Kenneth Miles' or `H. Lewis Allways'. What mattered to Blair was not the name as such but the second self that the name suggested and made possible; by adopting a pseudonym he symbolically turned his back on his previous existence and assumed a new persona.\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R. Hammond\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Universitetsbiblioteket i Tromso - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-25\n\nxii\n\nxiii\n\nIt is clear that he disliked his own name `Eric'. He disliked the name not only because he assumed it was Scottish in origin and he had a lifelong antipathy to Scottish names and authors, but also because it reminded him of the hero of Eric, or Little by Little by Frederic W. Farrar, a sentimental novel which he loathed. The adoption of a nom de plume enabled him to sever himself from these associations and to assume a completely different identity, that of a writer. It also enabled him to maintain a distinction between his private and his literary life. In private he was still Eric Blair; in public he was the author George Orwell. When, towards the end of his life, Anthony Powell asked him if he had ever considered legally adopting his pen-name, he replied: `Well, I have, but then, of course, I'd have to write under another name if I did.' The distinction between the two aspects of his life was important to him. (In practice it was not always possible to maintain a neat separation between the two. Friends who had known him prior to 1933 continued to call him `Eric'; many who knew him only after his fame called him `George'.) The point of real importance to any understanding of Orwell as a man and as a writer is this: that which had been adopted at first simply as a pen-name and with no deeper significance gradually became an actual second identity, a name synonymous with honesty, forthrightness and a militant radical attitude. The change did not happen quickly; for two or three years Blair eased himself into his new identity, writing, talking, and even dressing to conform to his new image. By 1936 the transformation was complete. The assumption of the name George Orwell meant that he could, symbolically and actually, sever himself from his past. St Cyprian's, Eton and Burma now belonged to a phase of his life he regarded as alien. He rejected that way of life and all that it represented. He wanted passionately to opt out of the life of a gentleman and assume instead the mantle of a writer. Despite his wish that no biography of him should be written, several full-length studies have been attempted, most notably those by Bernard Crick and Michael Shelden. Comprehensive though these are, it is arguable that no fully satisfactory\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R. Hammond\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Universitetsbiblioteket i Tromso - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-25\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nbiography of Orwell has yet appeared, simply because he was such a complex figure who never wholly resolved the competing tensions in his psychology. Embedded deep within his make-up was a profound pessimism which inhibited him from close friendships and darkened the closing years of his life. The only individual who succeeded in breaking through this defensive crust was his first wife, Eileen, who understood him fully and appreciated the complex forces which had made him what he was. She and she alone had the ability to see through his moods and penetrate to the `crystal spirit' which lay beneath. His life is reasonably well documented, partly because he was such a prolific correspondent, but inevitably the record is much fuller once he became established as a professional writer. One would like to know much more about his early life, especially his schooling at St Cyprian's. What was the truth about this? If his own testimony is to be believed (in `Such, Such were the Joys'), it was a dreadful establishment, only a little removed from Dotheboys Hall in Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby. Michael Shelden, on the other hand, has unearthed evidence suggesting that this picture may be distorted and that the school was not nearly so bad as Orwell leads us to believe. The point is of some significance as a body of criticism has arisen implying that the torture and cruelty of Nineteen EightyFour had its roots at St Cyprian's. Again, what impact did the years at Eton have upon him? And how influential was the Eton experience in determining his attitude to manual workers? One would also like to know much more about his thoughts and actions during the years 1927±32 when he was striving to embark on a literary career and writing successive versions of Down and Out and Burmese Days. And we still know tantalisingly little about his reading and writing during his years in Burma, nor why he made the crucial choice to enter the Imperial Police instead of going on to university. The period covered by his life, 1903±50, is one of exceptional interest, in that it was both an age of fundamental social and political change and also one of violent intellectual ferment. He was born before the aeroplane, when the motor car was a\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.

The years he spent at preparatory school were lived against the background of the First World War with its terrible carnage and social upheaval. In the same month in which his first book was published, January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. The years in which he was finding himself as a writer, 1933±6, were years of immense social change in Britain. It was a period of mounting unemployment, widespread poverty, and rising social unrest. In the year in which The Road to Wigan Pier was written, 1936, unemployment in Britain rose to three million. In that same year, the Spanish Civil War erupted, polarising radical opinion in Britain and Europe into diametrically opposed camps. Simultaneously, totalitarian regimes were spreading across Europe, accompanied by violence and cruelty on an unprecedented scale, and the persecution of minorities. Three years later still came the Second World War, bringing in its train immense social and political changes and the onset of the use of nuclear weapons. It was also an age of intense ideological ferment. It is difficult for us today ± living, as we do, in an age of doubt and ambiguity ± to recapture the passionate certainties of political debate in the 1930s. The decade was one of fierce argument on the pros and cons of democracy, socialism, communism, fascism, anarchism and pacifism. In such an atmosphere it was difficult if not impossible to be neutral. Whatever one's political stance, one was inevitably caught up in these ideological debates; one took sides. Orwell was no exception. The very titles of the journals to which he contributed recall the heated atmosphere of those times: Polemic, Partisan Review, Controversy, Revolt, Left Forum. In his famous essay `Why I Write' he defined his literary philosophy in these terms: `I write because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.' He was, before all else, a political writer, passionately concerned about the betterment of the human condition. If today much of his writing seems fiercely partisan, this has to be balanced against his lifelong concern for the truth: in such essays as `Politics and the English Language', `The Prevention\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R. Hammond\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Universitetsbiblioteket i Tromso - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-25\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nof Literature', and `Propaganda and Demotic Speech', he insisted on the need for the utmost clarity of expression and for striving towards honesty in written and spoken expression. His life is also of unusual interest in that it impinged on so many literary figures of his time: Arthur Koestler, Henry Miller, H. G. Wells, T. S. Eliot, Cyril Connolly, John Middleton Murry, Anthony Powell and Stephen Spender were all affected to greater or lesser degree by Orwell. As a novelist and journalist, Orwell encountered many of the editors, publishers and critics of his day and their names inevitably figure in any study of his times. He was so closely involved in the literary and political issues of his age that a chronology of his life is, in a sense, a survey of the history of radical thought in the first half of the twentieth century. I hope that this Chronology will be found useful by those readers who wish to check a point quickly without recourse to the full-scale biographies ± which in any case do not always agree with one another. With its aid, the reader will be able to find answers to such questions as: At what stage in his life did Blair adopt the pseudonym George Orwell? How much time did he actually spend in Wigan? When was Coming up for Air written? How long did it take him to write Animal Farm? When did he start writing Nineteen Eighty-Four? How long did he live on the island of Jura? A chronology of this kind cannot be a substitute for a detailed biographical study but it can serve a useful purpose by simply presenting facts without any attempt to interpret them or place them within a psychological framework. In seeking a closer understanding of his life, we inevitably come closer to understanding Orwell the man. H. G. Wells once remarked `I do not see, myself, why the particulars of an author's life need be recorded.' Surely the details of a writer's life are of intrinsic interest, simply because life so often illuminates art. To anyone studying Orwell, it is surely of interest and relevance to know that he served five years in the Indian Imperial Police, that he spent long periods living among down and outs, that he was once a bookshop assistant and that for a time he was a schoolmaster. Orwell seems to me a classic example of a writer whose life is inextricably interwoven with his work, and in practice it is difficult\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.

His novels, essays and documentaries could not have been written without a rich diversity of experience in England, Burma, France and Spain. All his experiences contributed to the man and writer he became: the Orwell who wrote Down and Out in Paris and London had his roots in the Eric Blair who went to school at Eton and could see life from the point of view of both a tramp and a gentleman. Among many unanswered questions posed by his life, the central one is perhaps the most intriguing paradox of all: which among his many selves was the real Orwell, the essential man? Was it the rather shy figure who loved the simple life and longed to be a village shopkeeper, pottering about his cottage and garden engaged in country pursuits? Or was it the radical writer, the iconoclast who delighted in exposing falsehoods and advocated revolutionary change in society? We will never know which of these was the true Orwell; perhaps in the end it does not matter. What does matter is that he left a literary inheritance which has continuing relevance for us as we enter a new millennium. His books and essays continue to speak to us. There are many questions which scholars will continue to debate. Was he on the whole an optimistic or a pessimistic writer? Was he a genuinely radical thinker or simply anxious to conserve the best of the past? To these and other questions there can be no final answers. All that can be said with confidence is that his work belongs in one of the central traditions of English letters, and that future generations will honour him for his straightforwardness and lack of pretension in an age of cynicism. Reflecting on his life and achievement, one cannot but regret that his life was cut short at the age of 46, when he was clearly at the height of his powers and had so much still to give. Had he lived, he would assuredly have produced more novels, essays and documentaries in that inimitable style and continued to write articles commenting trenchantly on the issues of the day. Yet despite the brevity of his writing career, the volume and diversity of his achievement is remarkable. When one reflects on the power of his writings, their incisive\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.

He was one of the few writers of this century to awaken his readers to a sense of the beauty of language and the corrupting effects of its misuse; to create a vision of human fraternity and of the misery caused by poverty and deprivation; to insist on tolerance, justice and decency in human relationships; to warn against the increasing artificiality of urban civilisation. Above all, he presented a devastating critique of totalitarianism, warning with eloquence and anger of erosions of liberty and helping his readers to recognise tyranny in all its forms. For this, and for the shining honesty of his prose, posterity has reason to be grateful. J. R. Ha m m o n d\n\n10.1057/9780230286801 - A George Orwell Chronology, J.R.
