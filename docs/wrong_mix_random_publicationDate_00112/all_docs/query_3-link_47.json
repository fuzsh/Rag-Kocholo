        "text": "The role of literature in history is reified by the growth, creation and unification of literary times, movements, events, authors and literary works that follow each other. On the basis of the opposition between normative tradition and experimental innovation, each new literary period, movement, trend results in and rejects the previous ones. Tradition and innovation are part of a single cycle of literary change and growth, contrary yet interrelated, arising under different names in different times and in the context of different movements, trends and literary works. Considering the major periods in the history of English literature, it can be divided mostly in three parts; Old English period, Middle English period and Modern English period. Old English literature, also known as Anglo-Saxon literature, is generally dated between 449/600 (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes invasion of Britain) and 1100/1200 (Norman rule establishment). It is speculated that the British Isles were populated by Iberians until the sixth century BC and by Celts from the sixth / seventh century BC. The year of the Roman conquest is 55 BC, and the years between 410 AD and 441 AD are the time of the Roman withdrawal. 449 is the standard date of the arrival from the land of the Germanic people. The invasion continued for a century and a half with irregular arrivals, up to about 600. During Roman rule, the Christianized Celtic people of Britain were pushed westward by the invaders to Wales and Cornwall and north into Scotland's Highlands, bringing modern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh.\n\nThis work however, is presented from a different perspective. It does not see English as only one of several languages that emerged from Germanic heritage, grew into a distinguished culture, and spread its influence by global expansion, but also as the most influential European language in the world since the time of the Romans. With demonstration of how English is similar to and different from Greek, Latin, modern European languages, Arabic, and Chinese and through the examination of the historical events that cultivated these distinctive characteristics, it explains the reason why English, rather than French, German, or Italian has become the most widely spoken and read language in the world. It traces this exceptional and lasting influence less in the terms of colonial expansion or cultural imperialism than in the diverse, adoptive and adaptive capacity of English as a literary language. In short, instead of surveying the soil that nurtured English, this work provides a panoramic glimpse from a place where the world seems remote and its long span of history has shortened and became almost immediate. From this spot, English differs from other languages, as demonstrated by the following unique features."
