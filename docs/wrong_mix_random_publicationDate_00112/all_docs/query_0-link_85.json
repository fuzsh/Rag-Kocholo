Since it was published in 2001, I have often been asked about the 100 I selected as part of the honorable mentions list, a second grouping of worthy writers more than deserving of recognition for their considerable achievement. Readers have wondered, as with the main ranking, why these and not others? Now I have the opportunity to respond, at least in part, by expanding the main ranking by an additional 25. Rather than simply promoting 25 bench players to the starting lineup and adding them to the bottom of the batting order, I have taken the opportunity in this new edition to reexamine and reformulate the entire ranking. I have indeed promoted some and proposed new names, while integrating the 25 fully into the ranking where it made the most sense to do so, based on a comparative and fresh assessment. Taking a fresh look at the entire enterprise—the selection and ranking of the greatest poets, dramatists, and fiction writers of all time—after several years is inevitable. Considerable time has passed since I made my initial selections and rankings. The list alters over time because I have changed. I often tell my students that the greatest works of literature demand to be reread every five years or so, not because they alter, but because you do. Every few years you bring a different perspective, informed by different experiences, to bear on the texts, and suddenly what was familiar seems strange, while formerly unnoticed aspects of the work assume a new prominence and urgency. Most of us begin by identifying with Hamlet but wind up with Lear! Reading Joyce’s great novel Ulysses first as a student, I sympathized with the alienated and isolated Stephen Dedalus, my undergraduate soul mate; in maturity, I, like Joyce himself, have shifted my allegiance to the middle-aged striver and survivor Leopold Bloom. Time and experience alter everything, including literary monuments; they, of course, similarly affect rankings of literary greatness. Since 2001, when The Literary 100 appeared, I have been actively teaching many of the writers on the original list, as well as others. Works that I thought I knew, I now know, if not better, differently. Other writers have forced upon xiii\n\nxiv THE literary 100\n\nme new perspectives and challenges to established views. I have also spent much of my time since 2001 completing two additional volumes prompted by the success of The Literary 100—The Novel 100, rankings of the greatest novels of all time, and The Drama 100, the greatest plays of all time. Each book took about three years to complete, an absorption into the ways and means of novelists and playwrights that I am sure has found its way into the revised Literary 100. From the vantage point of time and experience, if not wisdom, I have returned to the original questions posed by The Literary 100 in its introduction: “What makes a literary artist great? How can we measure and compare that greatness?” By inviting an additional 25 to the table, the seating arrangement had to change. Some of the alterations to the ranking seem, from my perspective on my former self, corrections in the mode of “What on Earth was I thinking?” Others have allowed me to redress some perceived imbalances in various categories of genre, gender, nationality, and historical coverage. Ultimately, I believe that The Literary 100, Revised Edition, is a much stronger book by having to accommodate 25 additional writers. The debate over questions of literary importance can only be enhanced by additional representatives. Here, then, again, is one reader’s attempt to frame a consideration of literary greatness. I look forward to seeing how it all looks in another seven years.\n\nIntroduction Compiling a ranking of the most influential literary artists of all time is not a task for the faint of heart. Although I have heeded the caution that fools rush in where scholars fear to tread, I also have been energized by an undertaking that seems a rarity nowadays, as the study of literature has been given over largely to specialists who seldom venture beyond their chosen, narrow territory into a tremendously rich and diverse field of study. The attempt to look at literature as a whole, comparatively, across cultural and historical divisions, certainly invites charges of superficiality and bias, but the effort remains a worthy one if it serves to stimulate thinking about literature from the broadest possible perspective. What makes a literary artist great? How can we measure and compare that greatness? What follows is one possible set of answers to these questions. In this ranking, I have tried to determine which novelists, playwrights, and poets have asserted the greatest influence, and which writers opened up the boundaries of the imagination in the most significant ways. If my choices invite criticism and different conclusions, so much the better, because controversy should lead to further thought and discussion of literary values. I hope that my perspective will stimulate your own. Although I have taught the works of many of the writers in this ranking for more than 25 years, I make no special claims to comprehensive expertise in the full range of world literature over the centuries. Rather, I have approached the task in the spirit of a general reader who is forced to choose, based on literary tradition, critical history, and personal preference, the best that has been written. I have tried not to let any one of these elements assert too much weight in the process. Nor have I ignored a subjective component in this ranking. I have, as best as I could, made choices that reflect some consensus beyond personal taste or a narrow cultural bias. Influence, in particular, is a tricky concept, and popularity alone is an insufficient measure for literary greatness. There are numerous examples in literary history of authors ignored by their contemporaries but revered by later generations, as well as enormously popular writers whom posterity has forgotten. Should a literary work, therefore, be evaluated for its impact on its xv\n\nxvi THE literary 100\n\nown time or on ours, and particularly in non-Western literature, on its own culture or through translation within Western culture? My ranking of the best novelists, playwrights, and poets of all time tries to balance these issues while recognizing that another writer, from a different time or culture as well as my own, determined to attempt an elusive level of objectivity, would have provided a different list. In a sense, this book is a variant on the perennially fascinating question of what one should take to a desert island, with a limit of 125 of the best possible expressions of literary imagination. I posed this problem to a number of my academic colleagues and students to test my own choices and to learn from theirs, with revealing results. Among scholars it was not surprising that the writers with whom each specialized ranked highly; in many cases, the figures on one scholar’s list were left off another’s list entirely. Many scholars also were reluctant even to state an opinion on the relative merits of authors beyond their area of study. My students were the least intimidated by the question of literary greatness and were often far more willing to challenge conventional wisdom for the pleasure principle that many scholars resisted. Perhaps the best advice I received, from one of my students in Wesleyan University’s Graduate Liberal Studies Program, was the sensible suggestion that the greatest writer of all time must surely be Anonymous—that highly eclectic and prodigious author of the Bible, the Icelandic sagas, Beowulf, The Thousand and One Arabian Nights, The Tale of Heike, and more—but I had to reject this advice in favor of known authors for the purpose of my ranking. Consensus among all whom I queried was impossible, but the majority of the authors in the final selection consistently appeared on everyone’s list. After I learned a great deal from the choices of both scholars and students, the final selection was mine alone. At various points, I would have liked to have had either a much shorter list or a much longer one in order to include more of the writers consigned here to the honorable mention list. To make the final cut, I have been guided by my sense of which authors have exerted the greatest influence over time in fundamentally establishing or altering the way we see the world through literature. The degree to which each writer shaped his or her literary tradition through the imagination and genius helped determine the ranking. As the literary critic Barbara Hardy has observed, “Good artists work within their chosen genre, great artists transform it.” Innovation seems indispensable to literary influence over the centuries, and I confess a bias in favor of authors whose daring conceptions broke with the past and radically reconceptualized the world. To a greater or lesser degree, all of the writers in this ranking helped redefine literature, establishing a standard with which succeeding generations of writers and readers have had to contend. Once the list was assembled, I considered each writer’s merits and impact relatively, in a mental exercise akin to lining up the 125 greatest literary figures of all time to receive an honorary degree. The thrill derived from the\n\nintroduction xvii\n\njuxtaposition of such diverse talents is, I hope, the appeal of this book. I have always taken a secret delight in the randomness of my book collection, in which I have resisted the practicality of alphabetization for the pleasure of accidental proximity. Hardy stands next to Shaw, Woolf next to Beckett, Fielding next to Poe, and so on. Each pairing suggests a dialogue of intentions and achievement that this ranking also attempts. In each profile I have tried to distill the essence of each writer’s career and character to help prompt the reader’s consideration of literary merit and relationships. I hope my efforts will encourage readers to greater appreciation of the achievement each writer so richly demonstrates, and to stimulate their own valuation of literary excellence—in Matthew Arnold’s phrase, “to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought in the world.”\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\n1\n\n1564–1616\n\nThe striking feature of Shakespeare’s mind was its generic quality, its power of communication with all other minds,—so that it contained a universe of thought and feeling within itself, and had no one particular bias, or exclusive excellence more than another. He was just like any other man, but that he was like all other men. He was the least of an egotist that it was possible to be. He was nothing in himself, but he was all that others were, or that they could become. —William Hazlitt, On Shakespeare and Milton\n\nIt should come as no surprise to see William Shakespeare placed at the head of a ranking of the most influential literary artists of all time. At literature’s most basic and elemental level of language, form, and vision, Shakespeare’s power is unequaled. If the mark of a writer’s greatness is the creation of the largest imaginary universe populated by believable characters and the reflection of the widest human experience, surely Shakespeare is alone in the magnitude of his achievement. Acknowledged as the greatest English writer, unrivaled in popular and critical acclaim, Shakespeare is also the recognized international master whose universality communicates across cultural divides. Shortly after Shakespeare’s death, Ben Jonson [66] wrote in tribute to Shakespeare’s greatness:\n\n1\n\n2 THE literary 100\n\nThou art a Moniment, without a tombe, An art alive still, while thy Booke doth live, And we have wits to read, and praise to give . . . Triumph, my Britaine, thou has one to showe, To whom all Scenes of Europe homage owe. He was not of an age, but for all time!\n\nJonson’s sentiment has held sway as each generation since Shakespeare’s has discovered new relevance and significance in his plays and poems. No other writer has so completely established literature’s boundaries and excellence in the creation of fully realized characters, in the genius of his dramatic storytelling, and, most magnificently, in his supreme mastery of language as an expressive, poetic medium. The little we know about Shakespeare’s life and artistic development has contributed both to the myth of the playwright as a natural, instinctual artist rather than a conscious craftsman, and also to the search for alternative sources of his creations in other authors, such as Francis Bacon or Edward de Vere, whose education and experiences seem a better fit to explain the genius of the playwright. The essence of the man who produced such a glittering array of masterpieces has eluded and confounded his critics. “Shakespeare is in the singularly fortunate position,” W. H. Auden [103] once remarked, “of being to all intents and purposes, anonymous.” Ralph Waldo Emerson rightly argued that “Shakespeare is the only biographer of Shakespeare.” What continually perplexes us is Shakespeare’s defiance of customary artistic limitations, his unmatched objectivity, and his freedom from the personal bias that confines most artists. Shakespeare’s art is one of remarkable inclusiveness that captures the full range of human experience, in which most traces of inspiration and the personality of its creator have been fully absorbed in the works themselves. What we know for sure of Shakespeare’s life comes from a few scanty records that fix his birth, marriage, the baptism of his three children, and his later theatrical successes as an actor and playwright. Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in the geographical center of England, a rural community of fewer than 2,000. His father was a prosperous and prominent tradesman, bailiff, and alderman, who suffered a decline in fortune and prestige. It is likely that Shakespeare was educated at the local grammar school, where he was exposed to the Latin classics, of which Ovid [26] was a particular favorite. At the age of 18 he married a farmer’s daughter, Anne Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna in 1583 and the twins Hamnet and Judith in 1585. What Shakespeare did or experienced in the next seven years, before records locate him in London as a successful playwright and actor, remains a mystery. By 1594 records show that he was a shareholder in London’s most celebrated stage company under the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain. Besides his early\n\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 3\n\nplays—the comedies, Comedy of Errors (1592), Two Gentlemen of Verona (1594), Love’s Labour’s Lost (1594), and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1595); historical chronicles, Henry VI (1590), Richard III (1592), and Richard II (1595); and the early tragedies, Titus Andronicus (1593) and Romeo and Juliet (1594)—Shakespeare achieved literary distinction as a poet with Venus and Adonis (1593) and The Rape of Lucrece (1594). He would continue his nondramatic writing with a masterful sonnet cycle that circulated among his friends and was published in 1609. The achievement evident in the sonnets alone would have secured Shakespeare a significant place in English literary history. By the late 1590s, Shakespeare’s prominence and success allowed him to purchase a large home, New Place, in Stratford, and to secure the rank of a gentleman with the recognition of his family’s coat of arms in 1596. He shared in the expenses for the construction of the Globe in 1598, a large playhouse on the south bank of the Thames, where his masterpieces were performed. They include the great comedies, As You Like It (1599) and Twelfth Night (1599); the historical cycle of Henry IV (1597) and Henry V (1598); the great tragedies, Hamlet (1600), Othello (1604), King Lear (1605), and Macbeth (1605); and the Roman plays, Julius Caesar (1599) and Antony and Cleopatra (1606). Around 1610 Shakespeare retired to Stratford, although he continued to write a series of romances or tragicomedies that include Cymbeline (1609), The Winter’s Tale (1610), and The Tempest (1611) before his death in 1616 at the age of 52. It is impossible to write briefly of Shakespeare’s achievement in a literary canon that includes more than 30 plays, the majority of which are crucial to an understanding of literary history and resist reduction even to the conventional categories of comedies, tragedies, and histories. It is possible here only to point to some of the central qualities that define Shakespeare’s genius. One place to start is with the dramatic tradition that Shakespeare inherited and revolutionized. As with all of literature’s greatest figures, Shakespeare’s work is derived from a complex blend of time, place, and particular genius. Shakespeare is fundamentally a great assimilator of the popular dramatic tradition, joined with the humanist energies released by the Renaissance and the expansive freedom of expression and form that the Elizabethan stage allowed. Prior to the Elizabethan dramatists, the English theater offered mainly religious and allegorical themes. Shakespeare, preeminently, instead used drama to explore secular human experience and reflect the actual life of English and world history, shaped by a remarkable grasp of the commonplace and the subtlety of behavior and psychology. He established the link with Aeschylus [27], Sophocles [13], and Euripides [22] in reviving drama as a medium for the most profound exploration of human existence. Extending the rules of classical drama, he created an expressive dramatic form that would serve as a romantic alternative to the classical norm of order and balance, and helped establish the tension between classicism and romanticism that defines modernism.\n\n4 THE literary 100\n\nShakespeare divided his efforts fairly equally among the four major categories available to him in drama—tragedies, comedies, histories, and romances—and turned the potential limitations of the Elizabethan theater, with its bare, open stage, into a great strength, as his expressive language compensated for limited stage effects. From king to clown, Shakespeare is able to capture the high heroism of a character like Hotspur in Henry IV and his opposite in Falstaff; the tortured melancholy of youth in Hamlet and the anguish of age in King Lear; and the delightful follies of love in his comedies, as well as love’s corruption in Othello and Macbeth. Expressed in his remarkable expressive language, as Thomas Carlyle observed, “woven all of sheetlightning and sunbeams,” Shakespeare exploited the widest vocabulary of any English creative writer and fashioned an unsurpassed pattern of dazzling and functional imagery. Yet Shakespeare’s greatness rests not principally on either his daunting range or virtuosity, but instead in his power to communicate, to reveal our selves in the mirror of his art.\n\n2\n\nDante Alighieri\n\n1265–1321\n\n. . . And she delivered of a son, whom by common consent with his father, they called by the name Dante [the Giver]; and rightly so, because, as will be seen in the sequel, the issue was most perfectly consonant with this name. This was that Dante of whom is the present discourse. This was that Dante granted by the special grace of God to our age. This was the Dante, who was first to open the way for the return of the Muses, banished from Italy. ’Twas he that brought under the rule of due numbers every beauty of the vernacular speech. ’Twas he who may be truly said to have brought back dead poesy to life. The which things, when duly considered, will show that he could not rightly have borne any name but Dante. —Giovanni Boccaccio, The Early Lives of Dante\n\nThe greatest artists dominate and define their age, even as they are defined by it. Dante is such an artist. He towers over the Middle Ages as its consummate literary figure, creating out of medieval beliefs poetry that has claimed our attention ever since. Even as Dante’s faith and theology may fail the modern reader, the sheer majesty of Dante’s vision and the coalescence of human thought and experience into visionary poetry continues to delight and inspire. With Dante, hyperbole is inevitable. He remains a touchstone for Western civilization, and The Divine Comedy is one of the most revered and influential literary works in history, perhaps the greatest single poem that has 5\n\n6 THE literary 100\n\never been written. According to T. S. Eliot [19], Dante’s style is “the perfection of a common language,” and after Shakespeare [1] and Dante, “there is no third.” With this ranking, I obviously contradict Eliot’s assertion with 123 candidates for consideration beyond Shakespeare and Dante, although I concur with Eliot’s placement of the initial pair. With Dante one has the sense of the literature of Homer, the epic of a culture’s values, restored in the vernacular Italian that Dante legitimized in the poetic legacy he passed along to Shakespeare and the Renaissance. No modern writer seems as central to his age as Dante is to the Middle Ages. He is the essential visionary and conscience of his era. Although Dante’s greatest poetic works concern the private life of the soul and the world of the afterlife, an understanding of his age and the forces that shaped his thoughts is essential in tracing his development and uniqueness. At the center of Dante’s public life was the political turmoil of his native city of Florence: the factional conflict between its status as an independent, republican city-state and the power of the Holy Roman Empire and the papacy. In the Inferno, Dante reports that his ancestors were among the first Romans to colonize Florence, and he was educated to play an important role in Florence’s public and cultural life. In his early biography of Dante, Boccaccio [68] states that as a young man, Dante studied poetry, painting, and music. His early poems indicate that he was influenced by French Provençal poetry, the classics known at the time, and by Italian vernacular poetry, just beginning to flourish. After military service, Dante held a series of increasingly prominent political offices, becoming one of the chief magistrates of Florence in 1300. Two years later, while he was in Rome on a diplomatic mission, he was unjustly accused of graft, fined, and banished for two years. When he refused to pay the fine, he faced a sentence of execution at the stake, and never saw Florence again. He spent his remaining years on the move, dependent on a series of patrons in various Italian cities, hoping for a political regeneration that never came. Although his poetry is intensely private, concerned with the self and the soul’s redemption, the political struggle of his time is reflected in his art and sets the basic framework for the urgency of his meditations on moral and spiritual issues. On a personal level, the defining moment of Dante’s life was his encounter at the age of nine with Beatrice Portinari, for whom he conceived a lifelong idealistic passion. Though his contacts with Beatrice were few, her death in 1290 provided him with the inspiration to write La Vita Nuova (The New Life), a psychological and spiritual autobiography that blends sonnets and odes with prose commentary to trace the development of his love for Beatrice. The work is unique in medieval literature, combining the lyrical and the philosophical into a narrative of the poet’s growth. Dante’s other important works include the philosophical Convivio (Banquet), significant for its use of Italian prose instead of Latin for serious reflection; De Vulgari Eloquentia (Eloquence\n\nDANTE ALIGHIERI 7\n\nin the Vernacular Tongue), which set forth the goals and means for achieving a vernacular literature; and De Monarchia (Monarchy), his political theories on good government, which radically suggest the separation of church and state. Dante became one of the most learned men in Europe, whose reflections about his world and scholarship were synthesized in his monumental Commedia, written between 1308 and 1321 (Divina was added to its title in the 16th century). The scope of Dante’s plan was unprecedented: to dramatize in intensely personal terms, in a single poem, the Christian cosmology and doctrines that shaped the medieval worldview. His work is called a comedy, reflecting both the process of the poem from sin to redemption and Dante’s style, which differed from the formal grandeur of the epic and tragedy. Written in direct and colloquial language, the poem is expansive enough to include all aspects of human experience—the tragic and the comic—in a manner that redefines the epic as the inward, spiritual journey toward full understanding of God and the universe. Although the Commedia can be read as both an allegorical and theological treatise, its principal power derives from the personal narrative of Dante the pilgrim lost in a dark forest in search of the straight path. His journey takes him through the three regions of the Christian afterlife—hell, purgatory, and heaven—in a story that is at once a great adventure tale and the inner journey of a soul’s struggle toward redemption. What separates the Commedia from other religious meditations is the clarity of Dante’s vision, populated by actual historical figures. Their stories, narrated sympathetically with humor as well as awe, establish the Commedia’s humanity and social themes that are joined to the inner drama of the poet’s progression toward enlightenment. In arguing that Dante should rightly be regarded as the father of all modern literature, Erich Auerbach writes: Dante was the first to configure what classical antiquity had configured very differently and the Middle Ages not at all: man, not as a remote legendary hero, not as an abstract or anecdotal representative of an ethical type, but man as we know him in his living historical reality, the concrete individual in his unity and wholeness; and in that he has been followed by all subsequent portrayers of man, regardless of whether they treated a historical or mythical or a religious subject, for after Dante myth and legend also became history. Even in portraying saints, writers have striven for truth to life, for historical concreteness, as though saints too were part of the historical process. . . . Christian legend came to be treated as an immanent historical reality; the arts have striven to represent a more perfect unity of spirit and body, spun into the fabric of man’s destiny, and despite changes of taste and differences in artistic technique, this striving has endured, through many perils and darkenings, down to our day.\n\n8 THE literary 100\n\nDespite the allegorical tendency to see Dante in the poem as an everyman, his linking of the spiritual and the divine to the recognizable world is the source of the poem’s great power. On his journey, led first by the spirit of Virgil [9] and then by Beatrice, Dante confronts the essential moral and human issues of sin and belief in a larger power that orders human destiny, beyond that of the individual. The Commedia extends itself to the limit of artistic imagination captured in poetry that is in turns clear, precise, serious, and sublime. Dante’s structural genius, his development of a flexible poetic style capable of a great range of effects, and his placement of human experience at the center of his poem while contemplating the essential questions of existence, have exerted their influence on all subsequent literature in the West. He was, as Boccaccio rightly points out, well named the Giver.\n\n3\n\nHomer\n\nfl. c. 750(?) b.c.\n\nIn grave amazement he understood. In this night too, in this night of his mortal eyes into which he was now descending, love and danger were again waiting. Ares and Aphrodite, for already he divined (already it encircled him) a murmur of glory and hexameters, a murmur of men defending a temple the gods will not save, and of black vessels searching the sea for a beloved isle, the murmur of Odysseys and Iliads it was his destiny to sing and leave echoing concavely in the memory of man. —Jorge Luis Borges, Dreamtigers\n\nMerely to assert that Homer is the first literary artist and arguably the greatest does not begin to do justice to his remarkable achievement. In a fundamental sense, literature originates with Homer. As the progenitor of epic poetry, Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey defined the monumental work of literary art that captures an entire culture, synthesizing beliefs, customs, and tradition into a serious and popular form that has been the aspiration of writers ever since. His only rivals to have a comparable impact on Western culture are the Bible, Shakespeare [1], and Dante [2], and no single author has carried such uninterrupted influence for so long. Although Homer follows Shakespeare and Dante in my ranking, strong argument could easily alter this arrangement. Only the passing of the heroic age that Homer chronicled so magnificently, more remote in its values to the modern reader than the medieval world of 9\n\n10 THE literary 100\n\nDante and the Renaissance of Shakespeare, has determined his placement below both. Homer’s achievement is clouded in scholarly controversy, beginning with the central question of whether there was a historical Homer at all. Did a single poet create the Iliad and the Odyssey, or were they the work of several individuals, the gradual accretion of collective voices out of the oral tradition from which they originated? If a single poet wrote both, how is the author of the Iliad also the creator of the very different Odyssey? Recent textual analysis points strongly to the likelihood that the Iliad is indeed the work of one poet, but on both sides of the argument there is doubt that the same poet is also the author of the Odyssey, though the evidence is insufficient to overturn the conventional belief that Homer is the creator of both poems. Adding to the mystery, we know virtually nothing about Homer, except that he was likely a bard in the eighth century b.c. whose homeland was in Ionia, south of Troy in Asia Minor (now modern Turkey). He traditionally is thought to have been blind. What is incontestable is the considerable value the Greeks placed on the Homeric poems from their inception. Aristotle considered Homer’s work to represent the ideal of heroic poetry, and knowledge of Homer’s verses was part of every Greek’s education. Homer’s prestige remained uncontested by the Romans and reasserted its influence in Europe during the Renaissance with the widespread dissemination of classical learning. In appreciating Homer’s achievement, it is crucial to recognize that the poems were oral creations, not literary ones. Homer made his poems in performance, borrowing and adapting stories, ideas, and phrases from the oral tradition of a preliterate culture. Each performance in effect produced a new poem. The texts that we now read are later transcriptions, standardized from various written versions by scholars and librarians from the fifth to the second century b.c. Composed in Greek dactylic hexameter (12 syllable lines with a meter of one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed ones) Homer’s epics were originally sung or recited to the accompaniment of a lyre, and were based on the poet’s memory and skill at improvisation. The poems’ formulaic phrases—“fleet-footed Achilles,” “rosy-fingered dawn,” “bronze-shirted Achaians”—and repetition are all evidence of oral performance, aiding the audience’s understanding and helping the poet fit his language to the metric structure. Given the traditional qualities of Homer’s epics, in which he borrowed from a storehouse of stories and phrases, what makes his work so unique are the overall excellence of his verse, his perceptiveness, and the sheer magnitude of his conception. Individual oral compositions are thought to have been between 500 and 600 lines in length, able to hold the attention of an audience on a single occasion—for example, following an evening meal—as seen in the Odyssey’s Book Eight in the performance of the bard Demodocus. This is the length of just a single book of a total of 24 in both the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n\nHOMER 11\n\nHomer is considered unique in his monumental expansion of oral poetry into a much grander dramatic unity, shaping traditional stories and methods into a whole of unprecedented range. To achieve the dramatic unity and coherence of his epics without the possibility of revision or the deliberate forethought and planning we associate with writing, is almost unthinkable and a testimony to Homer’s unmatched skill as a poet and storyteller. Homer’s greatness is evident even through a superficial look at his epics. In the Iliad, his subject is war and the various examples of heroism it represents under the threat of death. Tradition dictated that heroic poetry must deal with past events and figures of great renown and distinction, and Homer selects the 10-year Trojan War at its climax. The Iliad describes the events leading up to the fatal and decisive combat between Achilles, the Greeks’ greatest warrior, and the Trojan champion Hector in a battle that ensures Troy’s fall. Homer’s poem begins with Achilles’ withdrawal from the battlefield as a result of the slight to his honor by Agamemnon, the commander of the Greeks. This allows the Trojans a momentary triumph and results in the slaying of Achilles’ closest friend Patroclus by Hector. Only the absolute obligation of blood vengeance is sufficient to overcome the slight to Achilles’ honor, and he meets and kills Hector. The poem ends with Achilles’ change of heart from vengeance to pity and the ending of his wrath, which culminates in his agreement to return Hector’s body to his family for proper burial. The Iliad works on a number of levels, but primarily it is an exciting story that Homer narrates skillfully with godlike objectivity and focus on the telling detail. Although all of Homer’s characters are remarkable in their qualities and accomplishments, which are well beyond the reach of ordinary men and women, each acts according to his or her personality and temperament. Collectively, the characters and events describe the values of a heroic world in which honor is the highest virtue and violent death is almost certain. In the Odyssey, Homer reimagines the tragic heroism of the Iliad as heroic comedy. Following the fall of Troy, Odysseus struggles for 10 years to return home to Ithaca and restore the life he led before the conflict. The dramatic unity of the Iliad is replaced by the extended episodes of Odysseus’s journey and the multiple stories of his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope, afflicted by a collection of rapacious suitors who must be vanquished in the story’s climax. Odysseus’s heroism is also markedly different from that of Achilles. Odysseus is the consummate survivor who is shown as more human, with a more complex blend of skills and weaknesses, than the unrelenting demigod and warrior Achilles. Although there is no mistaking the heroic worldview of both Homeric poems, the Odyssey locates its values more closely in the world of Homer’s audience. It also redirects his art to essential themes of home and domestic love, and the eventual prize and goal of the hero in recapturing both, even in a story that involves a visit to the underworld and encounters with mythical\n\n12 THE literary 100\n\ncreatures. If the Iliad portrays a heroic world and values that were waning, archaic even to Homer’s first audiences, the Odyssey points heroic art in a new direction, toward ordinary life of mixed character. It is not surprising that James Joyce [7], in looking for a structuring principle for his modern epic Ulysses, should select Homer’s Odyssey. For Joyce, Odysseus was the only completely well-rounded character presented by any writer, and as he observed, “The most beautiful, all-embracing theme is that of the Odyssey. It is greater, more human, than that of Hamlet, Don Quixote, Dante, Faust . . . I find the subject of Ulysses the most human in world literature. . . . After Troy there is no further talk of Achilles, Menelaus, Agamemnon. Only one man is not done with; his heroic career has hardly begun: Ulysses.” In the Iliad and the Odyssey, Homer shows his mastery of the experience of war and peace in themes that are both serious and profoundly human. With Homer, the epic, wide-ranging enough to capture the values of an entire culture, evolves as a form and sets a standard that later writers would try to master as the highest aspiration of literary art. By succeeding, a writer can be described as the Homer of his age, a tribute to the power and possibility of art that Homer established.\n\n4\n\nLeo Tolstoy\n\n1828–1910\n\nOf course you have read Tolstoi’s War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I never had that exquisite felicity before the summer, and now I feel as if I knew the perfection in the representation of human life. Life indeed seems less real than his tale of it. Such infallible veracity! The impression haunts me as nothing literary ever haunted me before. —William James, letter to Henry James, 1872\n\nParadox and contradiction surround the gigantic figure of Tolstoy. The author of two of the greatest novels ever written, Tolstoy repudiated both, as well as the works of Shakespeare [1], as “bad art,” unworthy of the moral teaching that his later life demanded. A member of Russia’s aristocracy, Tolstoy transformed himself from an idle and dissolute creature of his class into a supreme novelist with unrivaled imaginative powers, and then became a prophetic sage who tried to conform to a comprehensive vision of primitive Christian simplicity. In a sense, Tolstoy’s determined search for meaning, which forms the core of his books, is the one constant in an otherwise tangled life. Few authors have embodied their discoveries as relentlessly as Tolstoy, but it is Tolstoy the artist, not Tolstoy the holy man, who continues to speak to us. As John Bayley, in his critical study Tolstoy and the Novel, observed, “No one who is not interested in himself can be interested in a great novel, and in Tolstoy we\n\n13\n\n14 THE literary 100\n\nexperience in greater measure than in any other novelist the recognition of ourselves that leads to increased self-knowledge.” Tolstoy was born in 1828 into a wealthy, noble family and grew up on the Tolstoy estate of Yasnaya Polyana, south of Moscow. Both his parents died while he was a child, and he was reared by relatives and educated by private tutors. After three years as a student at Kazan University, he returned home to manage the estate and to live an aimless and pleasureseeking life among upper-class circles in St. Petersburg and Moscow. At the age of 23, Tolstoy entered the army as an artillery officer and campaigned against the Caucasian hill tribes and helped defend Sevastopol during the Crimean War. While in the army, he developed an addiction to gambling as well as a determination to become a writer. His first works reflect his war experiences and his recollections of childhood. Published in Russian magazines, Tolstoy’s early fiction announced the arrival of promising literary talent, part of the extraordinary flowering of Russian fiction in the 19th century, whose masters included Turgenev and Dostoevsky [14]. Tolstoy traveled in Europe before marrying in 1862, then settled down to raise a family of 13 children. He reorganized his estate to reflect the principles of peasantry reform, including land ownership and improved education for his serfs, which interested him. Between 1863 and 1877, Tolstoy wrote his two great masterpieces, War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). The first is a grand Russian epic that depicts the events of Napoleon’s invasion through the affairs of several Russian families. War and Peace particularly concerns the search by two men, Prince Andrey Bolkonsky and Pierre Bezuhov, for significance and meaning in their lives. The second novel, one of the great love stories in world literature, traces the adulterous affair of Anna Karenina and Count Alexey Vronsky to Anna’s destruction when she refuses to conform to the hypocritical values of upper-class morality. Anna’s tragedy is paralleled by a search for an alternative to society’s values by Levin, who finds his answers domestically among the peasants on his estate. The conflict Tolstoy explored in both novels between self-fulfillment and society, as well as history’s grip on the individual, produced a personal crisis and the beginning of a quest for answers that he discovered in a unique blend of primitive Christianity, faith in simple peasant values derived from a close relationship to the land, and the renunciation of government, private property, and organized religion. He spent the rest of his life attempting to live according to his precepts and writing books that embodied his philosophy. Although Tolstoy the moralist predominates over Tolstoy the artist during this period, with his great gift for capturing the vitality and variety of life and human experience, some of his works after his conversion are among his finest, particularly “The Death of Ivan Ilych” (1886) and “The Kreutzer Sonata” (1891). Tolstoy’s mysticism and asceticism attracted devoted followers but\n\nLEO TOLSTOY 15\n\nlargely alienated him from his wife and family. He caught a chill and died in the house of a stationmaster while attempting to escape their control on a journey to a monastery. A fascination with Tolstoy’s remarkable life and philosophy has dominated the appreciation of his work. The genius that created such massive portraits of lived experience seems to dwarf and make irrelevant any consideration of his artistry and the means he used to create his novels. Gustave Flaubert [30], in offering his opinion of War and Peace, provides a typical judgment. Complaining of the weakness of the novel’s conclusion, Flaubert observed: “The first two volumes are sublime, but the third goes downhill dreadfully. He repeats himself. And he philosophizes. In a word here one sees the gentleman, the author, and the Russian, whereas hitherto one had seen only Nature and Humanity.” At his best, Tolstoy possessed an unprecedented capacity for entering the life around him to such an imaginative degree that the art that produces his effects dissolves, and the reader seems to directly perceive life itself. The standard that Tolstoy set, like that of Shakespeare, seems impossibly high. Additionally, in most instances Tolstoy’s novels defy the structural logic of other European novels with their aesthetic of tight control and authorial distancing. Henry James [38] called Tolstoy’s kind of novels “loose, baggy monsters,” and Tolstoy seems much closer stylistically to Charles Dickens [6], whom Tolstoy greatly admired, than to Flaubert and James himself. Tolstoy’s novels are expansive, pushing outward toward the panoramic; they are novels of the social group, large enough to accommodate the widest possible vision of society and human experience. We come to know Tolstoy’s characters as intimates, far more real to us than most of the people we know in life. Isaiah Berlin has written that “no author who has ever lived has shown such a power of insight into the variety of life—the differences, the contrasts, the collisions of persons and things and situations, each apprehended in its absolute uniqueness and conveyed with a degree of directness and a precision of concrete imagery to be found in no other writer.” Perhaps fellow Russian writer Isaac Babel put it best when he asserted, “If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.” If his novels contain multitudes, Tolstoy is no less adept at pushing the local and the temporal into universal relevance. With War and Peace, Tolstoy reconfigures the history of Russia’s patriotic resistance to Napoleon into a national epic that was embraced even by the Soviet regime, although Soviet leaders privately considered Tolstoy’s work to be counterrevolutionary. During World War II and the Nazi invasion, Tolstoy was the most published author in Russia, and relevant sections of War and Peace were posted on Moscow’s streets for inspiration. Although both War and Peace and Anna Karenina are firmly rooted in their time and place, neither are restricted by them, as Tolstoy pursues larger truths of history and human nature.\n\n16 THE literary 100\n\nIn the end, Tolstoy’s pursuit of truth led him beyond fiction and illusion to realize a version of his revelations about humanity and spirituality in his own life. As Vladimir Nabokov observed: What one would like to do, would be to kick the glorified soapbox from under his sandalled feet and then lock him up in a stone house on a desert island with gallons of ink and reams of paper—far away from the things, ethical and pedagogical, that diverted his attention from observing the way the dark hair curled above Anna’s white neck. But the thing cannot be done: Tolstoy is homogeneous. . . . Tolstoy was striving, in spite of all the obstacles, to get at the truth. As the author of Anna Karenina, he used one method of discovering truth; in his sermons, he used another; but somehow, no matter how subtle his art was and no matter how dull some of his other attitudes were, truth which he was ponderously groping for or magically finding just around the corner, was always the same truth— this truth was he and this he was an art.\n\nMost will agree with Nabokov that it is Tolstoy the artist rather than Tolstoy the mystic philosopher who compels our attention, and that his sublime framing of the expansive questions of life satisfy more than the narrower answers for which he eventually settled.\n\n5\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer\n\nc. 1340–1400\n\nChaucer was one of the most original men who ever lived. There had never been anything like the lively realism of the ride to Canterbury done or dreamed of in our literature before. He is not only the father of all our poets, but the grandfather of all our hundred million novelists. It is rather a responsibility for him. But anyhow, nothing can be more original than an origin. —G. K. Chesterton, Chaucer\n\nChaucer’s greatness as a poet derives not only from his pride of place as England’s first major writer and his pioneering mastery of the expressive power of the English vernacular, but also from his fundamental redefinition of the possibility of poetic expression. That the English literary tradition starts with Chaucer is not simply a matter of history—the accidental conjunction of an artistic genius and a time and place. It also stems from the more essential recognition that with Chaucer, English literature became profoundly different from what it had been before. By redefining the literary canon, Chaucer affected the course of literature in fundamental ways. Only a handful of writers exerted this kind of gravitational pull, subsuming the past and altering the future of literature. Soon after Chaucer’s death, Thomas Hoccleve appropriately observed that he was “the first findere of our faire langage.”\n\n17\n\n18 THE literary 100\n\nWe know far more about Chaucer than we do about Homer [3] or Shakespeare [1]. At the center of the English court for most of his life, Chaucer survives in 493 documentary records that trace his career as a page, soldier, squire of the royal household, and governmental and civil servant. There is far less evidence about his life as a poet. Only one of his works, The Book of the Duchess, can be dated with any degree of certainty. The disjunction between what is known about Chaucer’s public life and what is unknown about his writing life has contributed to the tradition of seeing him as a kind of rough diamond, an accidental progenitor of English literature, whose works say more about the era that produced them than the genius that defined his age. Yet Chaucer, like all great artists, is best seen in the complex relationship between the age that fashioned him and his art, which reshaped his world. Chaucer was the son of a well-to-do London wine merchant, a member of the increasingly important middle class. His father’s wealth provided him with an education and access to the world of the nobility and royalty. He served as a page in the household of Lionel of Antwerp, the second son of the monarch Edward III; later he became a member of the king’s household and formed a lifelong relationship with another of the king’s sons, John of Gaunt. From then on, Chaucer’s fortunes would be inextricably linked with those of England’s royals, including Edward’s nephew Richard II, who succeeded to the throne in 1377, and John of Gaunt’s son, Henry Bolingbroke, who seized the throne in 1399. Chaucer was a participant in and observer of the great events of the 14th century. As a child he survived the first and most lethal outbreak of the plague, from 1348 to 1349, in which 1.5 to 2 million of England’s population of 4–5 million died, most within eight months. When Chaucer was born, Edward III had reopened the war with France that would continue for the next century. The great English victories at Cricy and Poitiers occurred during Chaucer’s lifetime, and as a soldier he was captured by the French and ransomed by the king (for a lesser sum than the king was forced to pay for his favorite horse). Finally, the dynastic struggle that eventually cost Richard II his throne helped alter the absolute power of the monarch and shook the foundations of the medieval hierarchy. If there are few direct allusions to specific events in Chaucer’s poetry, the concerns of the age and Chaucer’s depiction of the life around him are at the center of his art. As a soldier, courtier, diplomat, government agent, and member of Parliament, Chaucer was well placed to convert his broad range of experience into poetry. Chaucer’s poetry also represents a unique fusion of personal genius with the historical moment. During his lifetime, English was to emerge as the national language, replacing the French of the Norman conquerors as the language of culture and commerce, and codified in the Midland dialect of the important trading center, London. Chaucer’s poetic language is the first great flowering of an English vernacular that he helped shape into an expressive\n\nGEOFFREY CHAUCER 19\n\nartistic form. That Chaucer was a layman, not a cleric, and that his poetry was performed before a court audience, are also important factors in the poetry he produced. The stages of Chaucer’s poetic development have been traditionally divided into three periods. His poetic apprenticeship during the 1360s shows him influenced by French forms. During this period, he produced a translation of the Roman de la Rose and The Book of the Duchess, an elegy for John of Gaunt’s wife, Blanche. In 1372, while on a trading mission for the crown, Chaucer visited Italy. There he encountered the works of Dante [2], Boccaccio [68], and Petrarch [51], whose influence is seen in his House of Fame, Parliament of Fowls, and Troilus and Criseide. The final stage represents the work of his full maturity, beginning in 1386 with the distinctly English voice of The Canterbury Tales. A view that posits the synthesis of Chaucer’s native English expression from the influences of French and Italian sources is somewhat misleading. A high degree of originality, along with the reworking of borrowed sources, is present at every stage of Chaucer’s career. His achievement comes not from the absence of derived forms but from his remarkable animation of traditional elements into a fresh and unique artistic vision. His greatness as a poet is demonstrated most clearly in his masterpieces Troilus and Criseide and The Canterbury Tales. Troilus and Criseide, the greatest of Chaucer’s completed works, would have secured his place as one of the giants of English literature even if he never had written The Canterbury Tales. The poem, set during the Trojan War, has been described by Chaucerian scholar George Lyman Kittredge as “the first novel, in the modern sense, that ever was written in the world.” It tells the story of the “double sorwe of Troilus,” son of King Priam, first in loving Criseide, and then in losing her when Criseide, in a prisoner exchange, is taken by the Greeks and proves unfaithful. Chaucer’s principal source is Boccaccio’s Il Filostrato (The Love-Stricken), a shorter, cynical tale of frustrated passion that Chaucer expands into a psychologically rich exploration of the nature of love and its human costs set against the background of war, the conflict between private values and communal responsibility, and the opposition of will and destiny. His great innovation is in investing his characters with a naturalism that justifies Kittredge’s assessment. The poem also displays Chaucer’s virtuosity as a storyteller and demonstrates his readiness and skill to produce the vast human comedy that would become his most popular and enduring work. Everything about The Canterbury Tales is monumental, beginning with Chaucer’s original conception of a series of tales told by a group of 30 pilgrims journeying to Canterbury. Of the 120 tales originally projected for the series (two for each pilgrim on the way to Canterbury and two more from each on the way back), Chaucer actually completed only 22. He probably began The Canterbury Tales in 1386 and devoted the last 14 years of his life to the project. Collections of stories linked by a framing device were not original; early\n\n20 THE literary 100\n\nin the 14th century Boccaccio had arranged the 100 tales of his Decameron, delivered by 10 characters. What was original was the relationship established between the tellers and their tales and the intricate byplay among the pilgrims that establishes a comic and ironic context for many of the stories, as when the Miller’s silly and cuckolded carpenter offends the Reeve, who retaliates with his own story, using a miller as his comic target. The effect is a delightful double fiction, with multiple dramatic and literary effects. Through the agency of the pilgrimage, Chaucer not only produced a masterful literary compendium of medieval story genres—romance, fabliau, saint’s tale, beast story, and sermon—but also managed to collect a cross section of medieval society. Chaucer brings his characters to life through a series of colorful portraits in the General Prologue, then has them reveal themselves in all their delightful human frailty during their journey. As John Dryden aptly pointed out, “here is God’s plenty.” Chaucer’s greatness as a poet is most completely demonstrated in his skillful details, which create a complex and ironic texture to his verbal painting. In The Canterbury Tales, the static and the stylized elements of medieval literature are replaced by dynamic, living portraits of complex individuals—such as the Prioress, the Pardoner, and especially the Wife of Bath—who command our attention not for their high rank or deeds but for their humanity. Chaucer succeeds in creating a new realistic standard in poetry that redefined the subject and treatment of literature. The human behavior of ordinary individuals claims full artistic treatment for the first time, as Chaucer expands the range of poetic expression to embrace all aspects of life and experience.\n\n6\n\nCharles Dickens\n\n1812–1870\n\nBut Dickens is significant for more than the sheer intensity with which he reflects experience. His is a penetrating vision of modern life. The unifying thread of his entire career was a critical analysis of nineteenth-century society unsurpassed by any novelist in grasp and scope. —Edgar Johnson, preface to Charles Dickens: His Tragedy and Triumph\n\nDirectly following Chaucer [5], I have selected Charles Dickens, who, like the author of The Canterbury Tales, magnificently “numbered the classes of men.” Literary critic Edmund Wilson has called Dickens “the greatest dramatic writer that the English had had since Shakespeare who created the largest and most varied world.” Dickens’s enormous stature as a writer was acknowledged by his fellow Victorians, by Tolstoy [4] and Dostoevsky [14], and by such modern writers as George Bernard Shaw [44] and George Orwell [118]. With the exception of Shakespeare [1], no writer in English literature has enjoyed a comparable degree of popular and critical acclaim. Dickens is simply England’s greatest novelist and deserves to be ranked with the top literary artists of all time. Despite such high praise, an appreciation of Dickens is not free from criticism. It is possible to charge him with sentimentality, of tugging too insistently at our heartstrings, and of reducing experience to idealized and overly 21\n\n22 THE literary 100\n\nmelodramatic patterns. His power and singularity as a novelist more than compensate for his defects, however. His range and depth are enormous, while his imaginative power, energy, and intensity as a writer earn him a comparison with Shakespeare. Through the power of his imagination and skill, Dickens offers a unique view of the world, rich in comedy, horror, and pathos, and we live in a world that still can be described as Dickensian in many important ways. The trajectory of Dickens’s career is a spectacular rise from what he considered the unspeakable degradation his family experienced in his youth. The second child and eldest son of John and Elizabeth Dickens, the novelist was born in Portsmouth, England, where his father worked as a clerk in the navy pay office. Both his parents came from lower-middle-class backgrounds of domestic service and clerical work. John Dickens, the inspiration for his son’s portrait of the tragicomic spendthrift Wilkins Micawber in David Copperfield, could barely manage a respectable household, and Dickens’s childhood was disrupted by a series of moves to increasingly less genteel addresses, first in Chatham on the east coast of England and later in London. Charles was a slight, unathletic child who was extremely sensitive and a voracious reader. His early upbringing and imaginative habits explain much about his writing, particularly his love of theatrical blood-and-thunder scenes, with their dramatic confrontations between good and evil, the weak and the powerful. His earliest memories were the tales told by his nurse about a huge black cat that hunted small children and of “Captain Murderer,” who, like Sweeney Todd, converted his victims into meat pies. Remembering these stories, Dickens stated, “I suspect we should find our nurses responsible for most of the dark corners we are forced to go back to, against our wills.” One of his favorite toys was a miniature theater in which he could act out his favorite stories. The theater, therefore, was the backdrop for his initial imaginary creations, and his lifelong dramatic interest helps explain his later statement that “every writer of fiction in effect writes for the stage.” Dickens’s developing imagination received a traumatic jolt when his father was arrested for debt and sent to debtor’s prison. Two days after his 12th birthday, separated from his family, who accompanied John Dickens to prison in the custom of the time, Charles was sent to work as a boy apprentice in a blacking factory, pasting labels on pots of dye for 12 hours a day in a rat-infested warehouse. Having been encouraged in his intellectual accomplishments and claims to gentility, Dickens felt as if he had fallen through the social hierarchy to the lowest depths of the laboring class, “utterly neglected and hopeless.” After four months he was rescued by his father and allowed to resume his education, but the humiliating stigma cast a permanent shadow on his psyche. Years later, when breaking the silence of this deep secret by preparing to reexperience it in David Copperfield, Dickens recalled, “My father said I should go back no more, and should go to school. I do not write resentfully\n\nCharles Dickens 23\n\nor angrily; for I know how all these things have worked together to make me what I am: but I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.” It is possible to view Dickens’s frantic assault on success and some of his darkest themes, particularly the victimization of children, as a response to the pain caused by this early experience. Critical estimation of Dickens’s career generally divides his novels into two groups: the early novels, from his debut with The Pickwick Papers (1836–37) to David Copperfield (1849–50), and his later novels, beginning with Bleak House (1852–53). Admirers of all that is commonly meant by the term Dickensian— the novelist’s irrepressible vitality and inexhaustible supply of eccentrics, comic situations, sentiment, and humor—locate Dickens’s greatness in this first period. Modern critics, beginning with George Bernard Shaw, generally tend to emphasize the complexity, psychological subtlety, and profound social exploration of the later novels as the primary source of Dickens’s genius. Regardless of reader preference, Dickens’s entire canon shows amazing technical and artistic development. Dickens began his career as a novelist almost by accident, when he was hired to write narrative connectives for a series of illustrations of Cockney sporting scenes that became The Pickwick Papers, but he quickly took control of the project, shifting his story to the primary interest, and Pickwick became one of the 19th century’s phenomenal best-sellers. Dickens’s early books were mostly written in the serialized installment form that The Pickwick Papers first popularized, a “detached and desultory form of publication,” as he described it in his 1837 preface, in which “no artfully interwoven or ingeniously complicated plot can with reason be expected.” Improvised and with little preplanning or attendance to a larger theme, Dickens’s early novels, such as Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, Barnaby Rudge, The Old Curiosity Shop, and Martin Chuzzlewit, show him working toward a more complex structure of characters who cause the drama rather than having it imposed on them, and much more elaborate and massive portraits of society supported by the most demanding narrative method of all, that of mystery and suspense. Dickens’s later novels—Bleak House, Hard Times, Little Dorrit, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend, and the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood—are all cut to the pattern of intrigue and detection that joins a vast network of relationships and social and psychological themes in a unified whole. Unlike most modern novelists, Dickens is a traditional storyteller who employs such theatrical techniques as secrets, surprises, and coincidences to heighten suspense and uncover universal patterns beneath the surface of things. His fictional formula, expressed in his preface to Bleak House, is to show the “romantic side of familiar things.” His novels are built on conflict, with dramatic action replacing authorial analysis and commentary. “My notion\n\n24 THE literary 100\n\nalways is,” Dickens observed, “that when I have made the people to play out the play, it is, as it were, their business to do it, and not mine.” In the arranged collision of characters, Dickens reaches his desired illumination of increasingly more complex psychological and social themes. Through the combination of realism and symbolism, evident particularly in his later novels, Dickens anticipates the central dynamic of the modern novel, linking his work with later novelists such as Thomas Hardy [43], James Joyce [7], Franz Kafka [31], and William Faulkner [15]. While working at a frenzied pace, Dickens still managed a full social and personal life. In 1836, he married Catherine Hogarth, who gave birth to 10 children. Although secure in his literary and financial success, Dickens remained restless and dissatisfied. He visited America, hoping to find an ideal democracy but discovering instead moral and political anarchy that helped confirm his own Englishness and increasing distrust of political solutions to social ills. Traveling and living abroad, busy as an editor of his own periodicals, acting in amateur theatricals and in dramatic readings from his books, Dickens channeled his restless energy into continual, often manic, activity. His later career was marked by domestic unhappiness, in which he separated from his wife and had an affair with Ellen Ternan, an actress 20 years his junior. In 1870, after a second tour of America and an exhausting series of public readings, and while at work on his last book, Dickens had a stroke and died in the grand house he had seen years before as a boy, with his father, as a symbol of material accomplishment impossibly beyond his reach. Dickens’s life is an amazing story of the power of the imagination to produce a seemingly inexhaustible supply of unforgettable characters—Pickwick, Sam and Tony Weller, Fagin, Bumble, Quilp, Scrooge, Pecksniff, Sairey Gamp, Micawber, Lady Dedlock, Mr. F’s Aunt, Miss Havisham, to name just a few—in an imaginary yet recognizable universe animated by the novelist’s great powers of visualization. Dickens remains the novelist nonpareil, capable of probing at the deepest level the light and dark elements of his mind and world.\n\n7\n\nJames Joyce\n\n1882–1941\n\nJoyce radicalized literature, so that it would never recover. He reconstructed narrative, both external and internal; he changed our conception of daytime consciousness and of nighttime unconsciousness. He made us reconsider language as the product and the prompter of unconscious imaginings. These did not come to him as experiments or as innovations; he did not regard himself as an experimenter. Rather they were solutions to the literary and intellectual problems he set himself. —Richard Ellmann, “James Joyce In and Out of Art,” from Four Dubliners\n\nJames Joyce is as essential to an understanding of modern fiction as T. S. Eliot [19] and W. B. Yeats [17] are to modern poetry and Pablo Picasso is to modern art. His achievement is nothing less than a great artistic explosion in which we are still sifting through the debris and dealing with the fallout. We are still learning how to read him, and novelists continue to show his influence, as the history of the novel can be divided with only slight exaggeration into two periods: before and after Joyce. Some writers in despair of ever surpassing him have lamented that Joyce took the novel as far as it can go, as Shakespeare [1] took drama. Others have complained that Joyce stretched the form of fiction past a breaking point, and the aftermath is a chaos of meaning that many feel was Joyce’s principal legacy.\n\n25\n\n26 THE literary 100\n\nJoyce’s collected works are few: two collections of poetry, a play, a volume of short stories, and three novels. Although hardly an innovative or preeminent poet or dramatist, his achievement in fiction was to effect a revolution at literature’s core. Dubliners sets the pattern and technique for the modern short story. With A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man, Joyce took on the solidly traditional novel of education and development and reimagined it in an absolutely new manner that has caused other treatments of this theme to seem shallow and routine. With Ulysses, Joyce created a modern epic out of the commonplace events of a single day in the life of Dublin with a modern Odysseus, Leopold Bloom, a Jew and a cuckold, as his hero. In Finnegans Wake, a novel shaped by dream logic and the destruction of the barriers of time and space, Joyce developed an entirely new literary language to write a universal history based on the life and times of a pub owner, Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Each step in Joyce’s artistic development challenged previous assumptions and perfected new techniques to capture consciousness and the complexity of experience. To my mind, among the world’s novelists, only Tolstoy [4] and Dickens [6] have fashioned a richer imaginative world. Born on February 2, 1882, Joyce was the eldest of 10 children. His parents, who came from an upper-middle-class background, declined, due to the improvidence of Joyce’s father, into shabby gentility and eventually worse during Joyce’s youth. Between 1882 and 1902, when Joyce first left Ireland, he had resided at 14 different addresses, each one step lower on the ladder of respectability. Joyce’s father is captured in Stephen Dedalus’s catalogue of his father, Simon, in Portrait: “a medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, something in a distillery, a tax-gatherer, a bankrupt, and at present a praiser of his own past.” For Joyce, the forces opposing his growth and artistic development were a succession of fathers: his own, his fatherland Ireland, and God the father, represented by the Catholic Church. In his art, Joyce would confront and attempt to master each. At the age of six and a half Joyce was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, Clongowes Wood, where he was the youngest boy at the school. His experiences there are reflected in Portrait, in which Stephen Dedalus’s glasses are broken, and he is subsequently beaten, or “pandied,” for neglecting his schoolwork. There are obvious differences between the young Joyce and his fictional reflection, however. Joyce’s nickname at school was “Sunny Jim.” He excelled at sports, and unlike the dour and isolated Stephen Dedalus, he was well liked and generally fun-loving. When his father’s financial distress led to his withdrawal from Clongowes, he eventually continued his studies at a Jesuit school in Dublin. As Joyce later remarked, “You allude to me as Catholic. Now for the sake of precision and to get the correct contour of me, you ought to allude to me as a Jesuit.” Like Stephen in Portrait, Joyce followed a similar cycle of religious devotion, followed by a decline in religious faith, and a growth of faith in art.\n\nJames Joyce 27\n\nAs a student at University College, Dublin, Joyce studied languages and began to acquire a literary reputation when, as an early proponent of Henrik Ibsen [36], he published a review of the Norwegian playwright’s work in an English magazine. In 1902, Joyce departed Ireland intent on becoming a doctor, but with the rather exotic notion of studying medicine in Paris. He returned after a few months because of the death of his mother and remained in Dublin until 1904. Joyce taught for a short time, began an autobiographical novel, Stephen Hero, and wrote short stories for an Irish farmers’ magazine. His first date with a Galway-born chambermaid, Nora Barnacle, on June 16, 1904, would be forever memorialized as “Bloomsday,” the day that encompasses the action of Ulysses. The couple left Dublin together in October 1904 to begin a life together in exile from their homeland, about which Joyce never stopped writing. They lived in Trieste, Rome, Paris, and Zurich, supported by Joyce’s occasional language teaching, infrequent earnings from his writings, and support from a variety of patrons. The couple raised two children and were finally married in 1931. Joyce began his writing career with lyrical poetry. He also collected what he called silhouettes: brief prose sketches of scenes, conversations, and incidents of observed Dublin life. From these Joyce developed his literary technique of the epiphany, the sudden “revelation of the whatness of a thing” in which the “soul of the commonest object . . . seems to be radiant.” Transformation, therefore, is the key function of the epiphany, and for Joyce the artist is “a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life.” The technique of the epiphany, the foundation of Joyce’s art, shows him working out the central problem for the novelist in the 20th century, expressed in the choice between realism and symbolism. On the one hand, the novel was opening up new territory of reality rarely examined in fiction before; on the other, writers were searching for a way of penetrating reality to express its essential truths in symbolic patterns. Joyce is at the center of these tendencies. No realist has offered a more exhaustive and unsparing depiction of the immediacies of commonplace life; no symbolist has spun a more subtle or complicated network of meanings. At their best, Joyce’s stories and novels work simultaneously on both levels, culminating in the extraordinary accomplishment of Ulysses, which attempts nothing less than a complete reconstruction of a day in the life of Dublin, underlaid with a correspondence of myth and symbol borrowed from Homer [3]. Leopold Bloom is the modern Odysseus and everyman, defined by his ordinariness, whose spiritual son is the romantic and self-absorbed Stephen Dedalus. The novel arranges a conjunction of their experience into a grand and epic totality. Experience is fragmented and elusive, captured in the flow of consciousness of Joyce’s characters, in which sensory data form patterns of meaning shaped by the invisible but controlling vision of the novelist.\n\n28 THE literary 100\n\nUlysses was published on Joyce’s 40th birthday in 1922 to a storm of controversy that surrounded virtually all of his published works. Banned in En­gland and America as obscene for more than 10 years, the book asserted its influence in smuggled copies printed in France. Joyce devoted the rest of his life to the production of his “night” book, Finnegans Wake, a dream sequence of Earwicker’s unconscious associations through the course of one night, as a complement to the “day” book, Ulysses, the story of a typical Dublin day. With its dream logic, portmanteau words, and punning from multiple languages, Finnegans Wake is even more experimental than the daring innovation of Joyce’s previous work, and to unlock its considerable riches in comedy and linguistic virtuosity, it requires far more labor than most readers are willing to devote. To the end, through two world wars, the mental breakdown of his daughter, and his own failing eyesight, as one of the greatest innovators in world literature, Joyce persisted in shaping a radical redefinition of fictional form, technique, and language to capture modern experience.\n\n8\n\nJohn Milton\n\n1608–1674\n\nThe characteristick quality of his poem is sublimity. He sometimes descends to the elegant, but his element is the great. He can occasionally invest himself with grace, but his natural port is gigantick loftiness. He can please when pleasure is required, but it is his peculiar power to astonish. —Samuel Johnson, Lives of the Poets\n\nTowering seems the term best reserved for John Milton. In English poetry, no writers except Shakespeare [1] and Chaucer [5] have exerted such a lasting and powerful influence. In Lycidas, Milton wrote what many assert is the greatest English lyrical poem; Samson Agonistes has been judged the English poetic drama closest to the tragic greatness of the ancient Greeks; and in Paradise Lost Milton created the defining English epic. In a sense, Milton is the great hinge figure, joining the Renaissance with the modern world of increasing uncertainty, which was ushered in during the political and spiritual turmoil of his lifetime. Having read and absorbed virtually everything that had been written in the past, Milton synthesized his scholarship of classical forms into a great contemporary epic, consciously rivaling the achievements of Homer [3], Virgil [9], and Dante [2], and he helped redefine the epic tradition from the heroic to the spiritual, shifting the epic’s emphasis to the questions of the nature of good and evil. Paradise Lost, 29\n\n30 THE literary 100\n\nlike the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and The Divine Comedy, is one of the touchstone documents of Western civilization. Milton’s sublime verse and the depth and grandeur of his poetic vision have few rivals. Milton’s preparation for his great achievement began with the best possible education. His father was a successful London businessman who provided his son with private tutors and schooling in London and Cambridge. At the university, Milton was nicknamed the Lady of Christ’s College for his good looks and seriousness. He received his B.A. degree in 1629 and his M.A. degree in 1632, then followed his formal schooling with five years of study on his father’s estate near Windsor. Milton was fluent in Latin, Greek, Italian, and Hebrew, and he committed the Bible to memory. Before age 30, Milton had written L’Allegro and Il Penseroso (companion poetic meditations on the active and the contemplative life), the masques Arcades and Comus, and the pastoral elegy Lycidas. In 1638 Milton left England for a 15-month tour of the continent, during which he visited Florence, Rome, and Naples, and met such important figures as Galileo and the Dutch jurist and humanist Hugo Grotius. He returned to England as the conflict over royal authority pushed the nation into civil war. For the next 20 years Milton aligned himself with the Puritan radicals and played a key role in the fortunes of the parliamentary forces opposed to Charles I. He was at the center of his age’s political debates and controversies, writing treatises that opposed the bishops’ control of the church, favored freedom of the press, and urged the sanctioning of divorce on grounds of incompatibility. (The first of his three marriages, to Mary Powell in 1642, led to an estrangement after six weeks, although she later returned to him and gave birth to three daughters.) Under Oliver Cromwell’s rule, Milton served as Latin secretary to the Council of State, with responsibility to justify the government’s actions at home and abroad. With the Restoration, Milton’s prospects and life were threatened. He was briefly imprisoned, lost the greater part of his fortune, and he retired to resume the literary aspirations that had been postponed during his years of public service. By 1651 his eyesight had deteriorated into total blindness, and he depended on his daughters to assist him in his writing and reading. Milton unfairly has been tarred as a Puritan apologist and associated with inflexible fanaticism and prejudice. He is better seen as a radical freethinker whose attempt to define Christian orthodoxy is both original and controversial. Beginning with the romantics, a revisionist view of Milton has dominated criticism, in which his artistic genius is seen at war with his intentions. In a famous pronouncement, William Blake [29] declared that “the reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels and God, and at liberty when of Devils and Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devil’s party without knowing it.” Shelley [77], recasting Milton and Paradise Lost in his own rebellious image, goes even further by asserting that Satan is the true hero of the poem. “Milton has so far violated the popular creed (if this shall be judged a violation),” Shelley\n\nJohn Milton 31\n\nargued, “as to have alleged no superiority of moral value to his God over his Devil. And this bold neglect of direct moral purpose is the most decisive proof of Milton’s genius.” That such a skewed reading of Milton is possible at all is a testament to his artistry, which expressed his intention in Paradise Lost to “justify the ways of God to men” in a fair fight between the forces of good and evil. He also explored in profound ways the eternal conflict in human nature between faith and belief, and the assertion of self against unavoidable limitation. Paradise Lost originally was conceived as a tragedy, but the theme of mankind’s fall and redemption needed an epic of a very different kind from the classical models. In Milton’s poem, the heroic values of Homer and the nationalistic ideals of Virgil are subordinated to the grander theme of the Christian myth. In Book IX Milton defines his subject and his argument: Not less but more heroic than the wrath Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespoused; Or Neptune’s ire, or Juno’s, that so long Perplexed the Greek, and Cytherea’s son: If answerable style I can obtain Of my celestial Patroness, who deigns Her nightly visitation unimplored, And dictates to me slumbering, or inspires Easy my unpremeditated verse, Since first this subject for heroic song Pleased me, long choosing and beginning late, Not sedulous by nature to indite Wars, hitherto the only argument Heroic deemed, chief mastery to dissect With long and tedious havoc fabled knights In battles feigned (the better fortitude Of patience and heroic martyrdom Unsung), or to describe races and games, Or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields, Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights At joust and tournament; then marshaled feast Served up in hall with sewers and seneschals: The skill of artifice or office mean; Not that which justly gives heroic name To person or to poem. (Book IX, 14–41)\n\n32 THE literary 100\n\nWith its staggering range of classical reference, its long, packed, and complexly subordinated sentences, Milton’s epic, though imitative of the grand style and dignity of his classical predecessors, aims at a different message: man’s fall and God’s divine plan of order and redemption. In Milton’s scheme, Satan is the model for the classical hero whose ego denies the divine and plunges humankind into evil and separation from the wholeness that God represents. In one of the greatest portraits of villainy ever created, the poem traces Satan’s battle with God for the souls of Adam and Eve. Although Satan’s evil is rendered with tempting conviction, there should be no mistaking whose side Milton is on, as the Christian myth is developed in a richly patterned mosaic of allusions, associations, and structural parallels. In his study of Milton’s life and poetry, Douglas Bush observed: “In its texture and structure, in all its imaginative variety and power, Paradise Lost is an inexhaustible source of aesthetic pleasure of a kind unique in English poetry. And, whatever theological elements some readers may choose to ignore, the essential myth, the picture of the grandeur and misery of man, remains ‘true,’ and infinitely more noble and beautiful than anything modern literature has been able to provide. The question is not how far the poem is worthy of our attention, but how far we can make ourselves worthy of it.” For 200 years following the publication of Paradise Lost, Milton’s talent and presence dominated literature, with his masterpiece regarded as the pinnacle of what could be achieved in writing. It would take the romantic movement and the modernists, led by T. S. Eliot [19], to break Milton’s control over poetic language and offer an alternative epic vision. Samuel Taylor Coleridge provides a fitting judgment of Milton’s contribution to the world’s culture: “Finding it impossible to realize his own aspirations, either in religion or politics, or society, he gave up his heart to the living spirit and light within him, and avenged himself on the world by enriching it with this record of his own transcendent ideal.”\n\n9\n\nVirgil\n\n70–19 b.c.\n\nThou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind; Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind; . . . Light among the vanish’d ages; star that gildest yet this phantom shore; Golden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to rise no more; . . . I salute thee, Mantovano, I that loved thee since my day began, Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man. —Alfred, Lord Tennyson, from “To Virgil”\n\nVirgil, the supreme Latin poet, produced in the Aeneid an epic that has been one of the most revered and influential works of art in Western cultural history. Only Homer [3], whose heroic poetry Virgil absorbed and transformed, has exerted a comparable, continual influence in Western thought and art. 33\n\n34 THE literary 100\n\nVirgil also set the prototype for the artist for whom poetry is both a way of life and a means for the deepest personal, cultural, and religious inquiry. Like Catullus [82], Publius Vergilius Maro was a native of Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy, and from a rural district not far from Mantua. His father was a landowner and farmer, prominent enough to provide Virgil with a solid education in Cremona, Milan, and finally Rome, where he arrived at the age of 17. Initially Virgil pursued a career in law, but he gave it up for the life of a professional poet and scholar. Shy and studious, Virgil took no part in public life, despite contact with prominent figures of his day, including Caesar Augustus, but the political background of his times is central to an understanding of his poetry. During his lifetime, as a result of the scramble for autocratic power between Pompey and Julius Caesar, and the civil war that followed Caesar’s assassination, the Roman Republic broke apart. Augustus was to emerge from the chaos with a political and cultural mission to restore order and the Roman values that had gained Rome its great empire. Virgil’s role as an apologist for the Augustan regime should be seen in the context of his fear of the violence and lawlessness that preceded Augustus’s reign. In his art, Virgil accepted his part in establishing a bulwark against the forces antithetical to Roman values and their principal contribution to civilization, law, and government. His poetry has, therefore, a strong didactic and nationalistic quality, though his sheer poetic brilliance and moral complexity transcend and expand these aims. Virgil’s poetic achievement is expressed in three monumental works. His earliest is the Eclogues, written 42–37 b.c., in which he set out to become the Roman Theocritus (the great Greek pastoral poet of the third century b.c.) by reviving the pastoral form. His celebration of idyllic rustic life, though in one sense escapist, is rooted in reality, with references to historical figures and current topics, and is clearly meant to contrast the present with the natural and the simple life. In the Georgics (36 to 29), considered by many his finest work, Virgil provides a Roman version of Hesiod’s Works and Days, a description of the agricultural life, in a didactic poem that is both a practical handbook on husbandry and a patriotic paean expressing his love of the land and the enduring wisdom of rural values. Virgil read the poem to Augustus on his return to Italy in 29 b.c., and it must have resonated with the new emperor, whose political and cultural goals coincided with the poem’s message. The Georgics is widely regarded as technically the most perfect of all Latin poems. Both poems show Virgil working toward the expansion of the epic, national and moral purposes of the Aeneid, which he composed during his last 10 years. The poem, one of the greatest verse narratives in world literature, follows the adventures of the Trojan Aeneas after the fall of Troy through his affair with Dido, queen of Carthage, and his descent into the underworld, to his arrival in Italy, where he defeats in combat the warrior Turnus and establishes the beginning of the Roman state. Virgil died before completing revisions and\n\nvirgil 35\n\ninstructed that the poem should be destroyed. It is believed that Augustus himself overruled Virgil’s final wish and saved the Aeneid for posterity. It was natural for Virgil to turn to Homer when looking for a model for the great poem he aspired to write. The Homeric epics represented, for the Romans as well as for the Greeks, the highest poetic achievement and the appropriate form for a serious, monumental work. Unlike Homer, Virgil was a literary artist, not an oral performer, and he transformed the epic by both his unique genius and the opportunity that written composition represented. Although his meter (dactylic hexameter), structure (the first half of the Aeneid corresponds to the Odyssey and the second to the Iliad), elements like similes, catalogues, and phrases, and entire episodes, such as the visit to the underworld, are borrowed from Homer, Virgil achieves a great deal more in the Aeneid than a convincing imitation. The Aeneid fundamentally alters the Homeric worldview and shifts the purpose of the epic into a new direction that would have important implications for later writers like Dante [2] and Milton [8], who would take up the epic form again. In looking back to the heroic world of Homer, Virgil began to trace the possibilities of a grand, nationalistic poem for his own day. To celebrate Roman greatness, he located the origin of that greatness in the legendary journey of the Trojan prince Aeneas after the fall of Troy to found Lavinium, in Latium, which would eventually become Rome. The Homeric past therefore becomes a means for Virgil to explore his own present, offering an explanation of how the present was shaped by the past and suggesting the heroic elements that define the Roman character. Aeneas, the prototype of the Roman leader, is a different kind of hero than either Achilles or Odysseus, and one of the poem’s radical concepts is a fundamental redefinition of the essential qualities of heroism and its cost in self-sacrifice. Aeneas accepts his divine mission to found the Roman state, and his adventures are lessons in suffering as well as tests in the values necessary to become a true leader. Achilles exerts his skills as a warrior for his own glory and honor; Odysseus struggles to reestablish himself in Ithaca. The adventures of Aeneas, however, point to a much larger purpose, one that goes beyond personal fulfillment. His virtues of duty and responsibility run counter to the often self-centered preoccupations of Homer’s heroes. Aeneas has been called a puppet, a “shadow of a man,” and most memorably by Charles James Fox, as “always either insipid or odious,” but such interpretations miss Virgil’s intention in the Aeneid, which was his willingness to sacrifice Aeneas’s individuality and to place him in the context of Rome’s destiny. One of the signs of the poem’s greatness is Virgil’s recognition of the cost of leadership and the degree to which a proper hero must sacrifice selffulfillment fo"
