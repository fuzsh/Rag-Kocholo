        "text": "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Minneapolis Live - 1999\n\nThere are so many positive things to write about Tom Petty and his musical career. For me three things stand out immediately with a dozen or so more, hot on their heels.\n\nFirst of all the music both solo and with The Heartbreakers, and whether studio or live, has been almost 'a' typical working mans (and women's!) rock'n'roll, and also so good to sing or dance along to.\n\nSecondly he has the respect and admiration of so many other musicians and artists, and yet his personal ego appears from a far, to be permanently under control.\n\nMy third initial thought is how he has been prepared to stand up to the music industry, and maintain his principles against the cynical ways within. He has also spoken out on the dire state of commercial radio, and so gets my immediate thumbs up on that one.\n\nThis is a really good performance (well after the above comments what else would you expect), recorded at the Target Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA, on the 3rd August 1999.\n\nThe set list is:\n\n01. Jamming Me\n\n02. Running Down A Dream\n\n03. Breakdown\n\n04. Swingin'\n\n05. Don't Do Me Like That\n\n06. Last Dance With Mary Jane\n\n07. I Won't Back Down\n\n08. Listen To Her Heart\n\n09. Diamond Head\n\n10. Don't Come Around Here No More\n\n11. Walls Fall Down\n\n12. Room At The Top\n\n13. You Got Lucky\n\n14. Free Girl Now\n\n15. You Wreck Me\n\n16. Free Fallin'\n\n17. Gloria\n\n18. American GirlReplacement link in comments or click on the picture (24th January 2010). This is a stereo soundboard recording that I understand originated from the SFX Radio Network. The audio quality is excellent.\n\nThe Beehive Candy Store has a few Tom Petty Cd's for sale, including new & used at sensible prices - click HERE for more details.\n\nThe Wikipedia main article on Tom Petty, makes interesting reading, and hopefully explains some of my opening comments more clearly.
