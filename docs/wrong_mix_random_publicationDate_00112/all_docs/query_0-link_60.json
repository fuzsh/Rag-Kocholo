Bharat Dixit Jaipur Just four days after its in- auguration by Governor Kalraj Mishra, a signifi- cant error has been dis- covered at the newly built Constitution Park in Rajasthan University, which cost 3 crores. The park features a Constitution pillar detail- ing all 22 parts of the In- dian Constitution. How- ever, the university made a major mistake regard- ing the parts of the Con- stitution. Part 17 (Arti- cles 343-351) should describe the official lan- guage of the Union of States, while Part 18 (Ar- ticles 352-360) covers emergency provisions. The university incorrect- ly mentioned emergency provisions under Part 17. Despite multiple in- spections and a dedicated committee reviewing every content of the park, this glaring error was overlooked. Nobody no- ticed the mistake during the inauguration. The in- auguration on June 19 was attended by the Gov- ernor, Higher Education Minister Dr. Prem Chand Bariwa, and RU VC Pro- fessor Alpana Kateja.

Captain Chaudhary pointed out a significant concern regarding the amendment made by the previous Congress gov- ernment to the Ex-Ser- vicemen Rehabilitation Scheme of 1988 on De- cember 7, 2022, based on caste considerations. He emphasized that this amendment has ad- versely affected morale among ex-servicemen, leading to a substantial reduction of approxi- mately 60 per cent in available positions across all categories in every re- cruitment cycle. The delegation, in- cluding Satyendra Manju and Suresh Sharma, fur- ther informed Governor Mishra that this policy change has particularly impacted the recruitment processes, such as the RAS 2023 examinations, where reserved catego- ries of ex-servicemen have faced severe limita- tions in securing posi- tions such as SDM, RPS, and Accounts Officer. First India Bureau Jaipur Congress leader Ramkesh Meena has crit- icized Education Minis- ter Madan Dilawar’s re- cent statement related to DNAtest of tribal people.

They worship nature.” He further remarked that Di- lawar’s comments reflect a narrow mindset. The Education Minis- ter’s statement has sparked opposition from the tribal community. In response to the controver- sial remarks, a protest was organized in Kota. Led by Deputy Mayor Pawan Meena, a ‘Sadbuddhi Yagna’ was held today to demand wisdom and sen- sitivity in addressing such issues.The tribal commu- nity continues to express strong objections to Dila- war’s statement.

First, India cruised to a comfortable 50-run victory against Bangla- desh on Saturday night that seemed to ensure them a spot in the semi-finals. But early on Sunday morning in India, Af- ghanistan pulled off a historic upset by defeating Australia, throwing the group wide open. Now, India faces Australia on Monday in what has become a virtual quarter-final, with the loser potentially crashing out of the tournament. Against Bangladesh, India posted an imposing total of 196, thanks to a series of quick fire contributions from most batsmen.The victory was com- prehensive but Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, usually relia- ble match-winners for India, are yet to find their best rhythm in this World Cup. Their part- nership was brief but got India a quick 39 off 21 balls. While many want a change at the top of the order, opening with these experienced stars allows India to boost their middle order with power hitters, a strategy crucial for posting big totals on tricky tracks. Bangladesh’s standout bowl- er, Tanzim Hasan, troubled most Indian batsmen with his clever variations in pace and bounce. Kohli fell to a slower ball, and Suryakumar Yadav was undone by extra bounce, showcasing Tanzim’s ability to challenge even the most skilful batsmen. Rishabh Pant played a pivotal role in shifting the momentum for India. His aggressive knock yielded five boundaries in eight balls before Pant was dismissed but he had ignited India’s in- nings when it was needed most. Coming in at 108 for 4 in the 12th over, Hardik Pandya accel- erated the innings further. After initial struggles, Pandya capital- ized on a loose delivery from Mahedi Hasan and used his strength to hit boundaries off even yorkers. His power hitting, including four crucial bounda- ries in the last two overs, pro- pelled him to a deserving fifty, reflecting Pandya’s importance in India’s batting lineup. Despite none of their top five scoring a fifty, India’s collective batting effort resulted in a for- midable score of 196. This per- formance highlighted India’s new approach in T20 cricket, where multiple batsmen adopt an aggressive stance, each spending no more than 25-30 balls at the crease but maintain- ing a strike rate of 150 or more. Bangladesh’s chase was ham- pered by their poor opening partnership with Tanzid Hasan struggling to maintain a run-a- ball pace. Litton Das fell in the power play to a clever slower ball from Hardik Pandya. Kul- deep Yadav’s variations proved too much for most Bangladeshi batsmen, and his googly yielded key wickets at crucial moments. Bangladesh’s efforts were of- ten panicky and lacked clarity but Indian bowlers too need to be commended. Kuldeep’s vari- ations left the batsmen guessing, while Jasprit Bumrah’s excep- tional spell where 15 of his 24 deliveries were dots, stifled Bangladesh who eventually lost the match by 50 runs without threatening India at any stage. The most dramatic twist, however, came later when Af- ghanistan stunnedAustralia and sent shock waves through the cricketing world. Batting first, Afghanistan set a target of 149. Australia’s chase was soon de- railed by Afghan bowlers, with Naveen-ul-Haq and Ibrahim Zadran delivering crucial early blows. Despite a valiant effort from Glenn Maxwell, who scored a quick fire 59 off 41 balls, Australia fell short, man- aging only 127 for 8 in their 20 overs. This 21-run victory high- lighted Afghanistan’s growing stature in global cricket and opened up the group standings. Afghanistan’s historic win has created a three-way contest for semifinal spots in the group. With four points and the best run rate, India currently leads the race. But if they lose badly to Australia in their final game and Afghanistan pull off a big win over Bangladesh, there is an outside chance of India still missing out on a semifinal spot! As the so-far undefeated Team India prepares to face Australia, the key will be their top-order batsmen and their ability to handle Australia’s pacers. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli need to start firing at their best, while India’s bowl- ers must contain Australia’s power-packed batting lineup. For Australia, the match is cru- cial to redeem themselves after the loss to Afghanistan. Their bowlers, particularly Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa, need to deliver strongly to restrict India’s batting. A victory for India would en- sure their semi-final entry and boost their confidence for the knockouts. For Australia, a win is essential to qualify for the next stage. Both teams have a rich history of close clashes and often bring out the best in each other. The match promises a spectacle of high-quality cricket and frayed nerves. Fans around the world will be watching closely as the outcome of this match could well determine the ultimate trajectory of this pres- tigious tournament!

The Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Jus- tice (Independent in- charge) said at a confer- ence here that the laws in India made during colo- nial times ignored the Indian ethos and societal realities of the India of the time and were based on furthering the needs of the colonial rulers. The union minister made the comments at the conference ‘India’s Progressive Path in the Administration of Crimi- nal Justice System’ at Vellore Institute of Tech- nology, Vandalur, here. The seminar is the fourth in the series after being held in Delhi, Guwahati and Kolkata which was attended by judges of high courts, ad- vocates, academics, rep- resentatives of law en- forcement agencies and students. “The Modi gov- ernment has removed the old laws having a slave mentality and made three new laws incorporating the basic spirit of Indian- ness and justice, namely Indian Judicial Code, In- dian Civil Defence Code and Indian Evidence Act, which will be implement- ed across the country from 1st July,” he said. Meghwal said the evo- lution of the legal sys- tem, particularly criminal justice under the British from the Battle of Plas- sey in 1757, introduction of laws like Doctrine of Lapse, Codification of Laws etc, were to suit and perpetuate colonial rule in the country. The Irish Penal Code was mindlessly copied and introduced in India, oblivious of the realities prevailing in then India, he said. As India is striv- ing to take its rightful place in the comity of na- tions as the ‘Viswaguru’ or the leader, it is impera- tive that all vestiges of colonial legacy are shed and a modern criminal justice system is put in place, Meghwal said. Union Minister of State, Ministry of Infor- mation and Broadcasting and ParliamentaryAffairs L Murugan said that after almost eight decades of Independence, the nation deserves a justice system of its own and the initia- tive to change the colo- nial era laws. Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal FILE U Createlargepondsinnortheast tohelptacklefloods:AmitShah First India Bureau New Delhi Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said at least 50 large ponds should be created in the northeast to divert water of the Brahmaputra to help tackle floods and develop agriculture, irri- gation and tourism. Chairing a meeting on preparedness for flood management during the monsoon, Shah also em- phasised on optimum use of satellite imagery pro- vided by the Indian Space Research Organisation for flood and water man- agement. He also took stock of the preparations to deal with Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Shah said efforts should be made to up- grade the forecast system of water level of rivers for better flood management. He said at least 50 large ponds should be created in the northeast so that the water of the Brahmaputra can be diverted and stored in these ponds, according to an official statement. This will help develop agriculture, irrigation and tourism in those areas at a low cost and also help tackle floods, eventually benefiting the local econ- omy, he added. Recurring floodingoftheBrahmapu- tra is a major issue forAs- sam and the northeastern region as it claims scores of lives inundates thou- sands of hectares of land. Shah said the natural drainage system should be an integral part of the designs of road construc- tion to deal with their in- undation in case of floods. Home Minister chairs meeting to review preparedness BJPhitsoutatOppnover silenceonhoochtragedy PTI New Delhi The BJP on Sunday at- tacked the INDIAbloc on the hooch tragedy in DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu, saying it hopes the alli- ance leaders who have not spoken on the issue will at least show repent- ance by gathering near the Mahatma Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex and observing a moment of silence for the lives lost. Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, the party’s national spokes- person Sambit Patra also slammed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Sta- lin and asked him to clar- ify if he was “complicit” in the incident which took place in the state’s Kallakurichi district. “More than 56 people have died... many are still critical. More than 40 of those who died consum- ing spurious liquor are Dalits. This is state-spon- sored murder and I am surprised that the Con- gress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Sonia Gandhi, lead- ers of the DMK and those of other constituents of the ‘INDI Alliance’ are silent on it,” Patra said.

The state played an important role in securing the third term of Prime Minister Naren- dra Modi,” he said.

You were my refuge, my home and my family. I never felt for even a moment that you doubted me,” he added.

STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS SIGNS OF CONTINUED UPTREND ARE BEING SEEN ow that the for- mation process of the new gov- ernment in the country is complete, the stock mar- ket is on a bullish trend. On a technical basis, the market is now expected to continue to rise, the big- gest basis of which is the purchases made by for- eign institutional inves- tors-FIIs and domestic institutional investors- DIIslastweek,butdespite thispurchaseofthousands of crores, there was no comparative rise in the stockmarketontheweek- lylevelandtheBSEindex and NSE index closed su- perficially higher. It is be- lieved that the current level of the Nifty index is technically predicting a boom in the market, in which the possibility of decline is considered only after 23200 points. The basis of future uptrend in the stock market is be- lievedtobethestrengthof the stock market at the international level, but the slow progress of mon- soons in India remains an obstacle to this. Similarly,ifthereisany decline in the market due to the monthly closing of the futures market on the coming Thursday, then it is being considered as a new investment opportu- nity. The biggest trigger for the stock market is the Union Budget coming next month, about which it is being speculated that to woo its middle-class voters, the government may make an announce- ment regarding the limit of income tax exemption. Apart from this, the pro- posal to bring petrol and diesel under the ambit of GST can also be the an- nouncement which has been awaited in the coun- try for the last 7 years. It is also being speculated about the Union Budget that due to the coalition government, there are less chances of tough deci- sions in the upcoming budget, which is sure to have a positive impact on the stock market. However,afterthetrad- ing session ended on Fri- day, the BSE index im- proved by only 217.13 points (0.28%) last week and closed at 77209.70 points, while the NSE Nifty index rose by 35.50 points (0.15%) and reached 23501.10 points. Despite the superficial rise in the BSE index and NSE index, the midcap and smallcap index re- mained quite strong, which is also pointing to- wards the future trend of themarket.Theincreasing confidence in the Indian stock market can also be seen as evidence of the purchases made by for- eigninstitutionalinvestors (FIIs), who had been sell- ing till now, who bought Rs 9102.87 crore last week, although the pur- chasesofdomesticinstitu- tional investors (DIIs) were much higher than FIIs with Rs 9574.93 crore. The special thing is that in the month of June so far, FIIs have sold shares worth Rs 2584.72 crore, while DIIs have bought shares worth Rs 21447.02 crore. Talking about the bullion market, this week due to new in- ternational equations, there was almost stability in the prices of gold sil- ver, and comparatively, while the price of gold fell by Rs 350 per 10 grams this week, the price of sil- ver increased by Rs 350 per kg. In Jaipur, the price of 24-carat gold fell from Rs73,850pertengramsto Rs 73,500 per ten grams silver increased from Rs 90,900 per kg to Rs 91,250 per kg.Traders are expecting stability in the prices of gold and silver thisweekaswell.Regard- ing the market trend this week, traders say that there are high chances of the market seeing a bull- ish phase, but negative international factors will have an impact on the market. According to traders, in the current cir- cumstances, listed com- panies of public sector undertakings along with companies associated with infrastructure pro- jects such as railways, defense cement, etc. are considered strong. They say that even if the index keeps fluctuating, certain stocks will defi- nitely move. THESE ARE THE PERSON- AL VIEWS OF THE AUTHOR.

Using the slower balls smartly on a difficult batting wicket, Afghan- istan defended their to- tal of 148 for six for their first-ever win over Australia in internation- al cricket. Australia were all out for 127 in 19.2 overs in the Super Eight contest and they are now staring at early elimination from the World Cup.

These asymmetrical wonders provide a fresh alternative to the conven- tional off-the-shoulder or strapless styles, allowing fashion enthusiasts to show- case their individuality with flair. Here’s how you can style these tops gracefully and add a modern touch with the right accessories. To start, pair a one- shoulder top with high- waisted trousers or a sleek pencil skirt for a s o p h i s t i c a t e d , streamlined look. Opt for neutral colors or subtle patterns to keep the focus on the unique silhouette of the top. For a casual day out, tuck a one-shoulder top into a pair of high-rise jeans, preferably in a contrasting shade, to create a balanced yet eye-catching outfit. Layering can add depth to your ensemble. A tailored blazer or a cropped jacket worn over a one-shoulder top can provide structure while still highlighting the asym- metrical design. For cooler weather, drape a lightweight scarf over the exposed shoul- der to maintain the allure while staying warm. When it comes to acces- sories, less is often more with one-shoulder tops. Statement earrings are the perfect choice; opt for a single bold earring on the exposed side to draw attention to the neck- line. Alternatively, mis- matched earrings can add a playful yet sophisticated touch. Delicate necklaces can be tricky; if you choose to wear one, a simple choker can complement the neckline without overwhelming the look. Complete your outfit with footwear that comple- ments the overall vibe. Strappy sandals or sleek heels work well for a pol- ished appearance, while an- kle boots can add a touch of edge. A minimalist clutch or a small crossbody bag en- sures that your accessories enhance, rather than distract from, your stylish one-shoul- der top.
