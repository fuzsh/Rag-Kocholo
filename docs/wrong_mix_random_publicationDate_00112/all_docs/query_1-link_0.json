That does not make him or any of us culpable,” Live Law quotes senior advocate Rebecca John appearing for Saifi.\n\n“If I and others like me, feel that CAA NRC is an unjust law. I have every right to protest. That in its own is not indicative of any conspiracy,” she added.\n\n“Constitutionally recognised right”\n\nJohn who had begun arguments in Saifi’s bail application before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, told Rawat that the “prosecution needs to be reminded that the right to protest is a constitutionally recognised right.”\n\nJohn began by placing reliance on the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in NIA v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali to submit that as compared to other special statutes including MCOCA, TADA etc. where degree of satisfaction is higher, the degree of satisfaction is lower in UAPA, Live Law reported.\n\n“My statement is that for the purpose of granting bail, they must cross the threshold of prima facie true,” John argues.\n\nShe also said that the “present case is nothing but a direct attack on the fundamental right of the Applicant to free speech.”\n\nKhalid Saifi has been falsely implicated by the police in the present case, in order to cover up and deflect attention, she alleged.\n\nRead full report on maktoobmedia.com\".",
