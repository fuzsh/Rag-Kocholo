As Elliot lay writhing on the ground, Hawkins fired a third bullet into the man’s stomach and “Mr. Elliot ceased to struggle.”2 People were affronted. In the relatively small British-Indian community the murder was front-page news and the subsequent trial was followed with interest. This was not the “done thing”; cowardly shots in the back, insubordination against a superior, a hint of insanity. Very quickly Hawkins was vilified as “a wrong-headed, fiery-tempered man, who seemed to limit his sense of duty to obstructing and insulting his superior officer in every possible way.” In contrast, Elliot was a man of “uncommon professional abilities,” “unsparing of himself,” and together with his wife a “genial and open” host.3 But when arrested, Hawkins said, “I don’t call it murder. If you only knew half of what I have had to put up with, you would say I was justified.”4 Far from being hot-headed rivals in love, these two men were supposedly level-headed engineers, working on the Bareilly-Rampur-Moradabad Railway. But what did that work entail and how were they trained and selected for it? What pressures of the job and life in India drove Hawkins to thoughts of murder? Elliot had been educated at the Royal Indian Engineering College in England expressly so he could join the engineers building the vast transportation, irrigation, and communication infrastructure of British India. As educational institutions go, the Royal Indian Engineering College (RIEC) – known informally as Coopers Hill because of its location – had a relatively brief existence.5 While it was open for just thirty-five years, between 1871 and 1906, its 1623 graduates6 contributed to the world in an increasingly wide variety of ways until the\n\n4\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nSecond World War. At the time it was a high-profile institution, governed in a rather military style but with the aspirations of an Oxbridge college. This book traces the history and impact of Coopers Hill through the lives and careers of its students, professors, and staff. Because engineering works were such a major source of British national pride during the late nineteenth century, technical education became a focus of attention. This led to an important period of transition in engineering education, marking the switch from the training of engineers by apprenticeships to university programs. In 1871 “engineering” was either civil or military – the subject matter was mostly the same with a strong emphasis on construction, but the applications were different. By 1906, however, civil and mechanical engineering were becoming distinct fields, and electrical engineering was emerging as a new discipline. Moreover, the working lives of college graduates spanned the tremendous social and political transitions of the early twentieth century in Europe and India. Royal Indian Engineering College From the outset, the college’s existence was political. It was created as a government initiative to increase the supply of high-quality civil engineers for the Indian Public Works Department (PWD). At the time, “high quality” meant “educated in England,” and the college was built at the Coopers Hill estate, near Egham on the outskirts of London. Its creation was opposed by the Government of India because they saw no need for a new college, especially one funded from their revenues. The feathers were also ruffled of the PWD establishment in India, which was then staffed largely by the military Royal Engineers. Later, the authorities transferred the training of telegraph officers to Coopers Hill and added Britain’s first school of forestry.7 The college’s eventual closure was similarly political and controversial. By 1906, British universities were offering enough engineering degrees for the needs of India to be met without Coopers Hill. The British government was also fed up with the expense and inconvenience of operating an engineering school. This time, in an ironic twist, the Government of India now opposed the closure. This political contradiction was summarized in “The History of Coopers Hill College in Two Chapters”: Chapter I, 1870 Secretary of State [for India] – “I propose to establish Coopers Hill College.” The Government of India – “We do not like the idea.” Secretary of State – “Oh! don’t you? Then consider the College established.”\n\nDastardly Murder\n\n5\n\nChapter II, 1903 Secretary of State – “I propose to disestablish Coopers Hill College.” The Government of India – “Don’t do that, the College has been a great success.” Secretary of State – “Oh! has it? Then consider it disestablished.”8\n\nBut Coopers Hill was more than a political creation, it was a vigorous intellectual and social community. To the “Coopers Hill man,”9 the three intense, formative years spent at the college embodied all the honour and traditions of an Oxbridge college. Its esprit de corps led to a social and professional network that spanned the world and supported men like Edmund Elliot in their frequently isolated and arduous workplaces. To the professors it was a prestigious institution for furthering their research or educational career. For the staff it was the source of great pride and loyalty. This community was driven by the principles, achievements, and prejudices of its members, and it is to the lives of these people we must turn in order to understand the human story behind the college’s place in the world. Coopers Hill officers were in the field for nearly seventy years, counting from the first appointee to the last retiree. It is useful at the start to reflect briefly on the huge scale of public works in India during this time. When Coopers Hill was established, revenues and expenses from India were roughly balanced, at a little over £50 million per year. Of this, the Indian Public Works Department’s budget took a sizeable £7.5 million, “more than the entire sum raised for the Government from its opium monopoly.”10 Coopers Hill engineers were particularly involved in the construction of railways and irrigation systems. During the college’s existence, an astonishing 22,980 miles of railways were built in India.11 Another 12,000 miles or more were added before the last Coopers Hill man retired.12 It is estimated that these railways were carried over 175,000 bridges13 and through numerous tunnels. At the same time, the area of Indian farmland under irrigation increased by 33 per cent, mainly as a result of canal construction. By 1902, some 44 million acres (18 million hectares) were being watered, representing nearly one-fifth of the country’s agricultural land.14 From 1878, Coopers Hill would provide training for the Indian Telegraph Department. By 1904, just before the college’s closure, there were 2127 combined postal and telegraph offices in India. They transmitted 7.3 million paid messages per year along nearly 60,000 miles of line.15 Starting in 1885, the college also offered a forestry program. Thirty years later, when Coopers Hill graduates were in senior positions in the Indian Forest Service, more than 20 per cent of the total area of British India was under the control of the Forest Department, totalling a staggering 250,000 square miles (65 million hectares), roughly the area of France.16 Taken together, these numbers reflect a truly remarkable technical achievement, one that was led by the graduates of Coopers Hill. Since their construction,\n\n6\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nthese public works have affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people and continue to underpin the infrastructure of one of the world’s most populous and significant countries. Scope This is primarily a book about an engineering college and its students. Much of the story is set in England and concerns the establishment and history of the college, life as a student, and the Coopers Hill Society that was formed after the college’s closure. Its focus is particularly on the lives and work of the graduates, and how their education at Coopers Hill prepared them to be engineer, telegraph, and forest officers in India. Information for this comes from official documents (college calendars, parliamentary papers, etc.), personal recollections and diaries of Coopers Hill students and staff, and articles in college magazines and technical publications. Although most do not appear here, this research has traced the careers of more than a thousand men from the time they joined Coopers Hill as eighteenyear-olds through their work in India until their retirements (or perhaps until early deaths). As a result of this familiarity, the perspective here is generally sympathetic to the college and its graduates. It also tends to be a view from the inside – how they regarded the technical issues, what context was important to them, how they experienced life and work in India. These men were socially and financially relatively privileged and shared the contemporary attitudes of their background. But most were ordinary people who struggled with their technical studies and fulfilled their duties in India and other countries to the best of their abilities. That said, Coopers Hill was a creature of the colonial system, and the majority of its graduates served the British Government in India. They typically saw their roles in terms of duty to the empire, and for the most part, their class and upbringing led them to support the ideologies and goals of that government. Although very few Coopers Hill graduates played significant roles in shaping government policies, by building infrastructure and administering forests in India they were an important part of the British colonial machinery. They were therefore complicit in the broader issues of colonialism, environmental impact, and imperial legacy. This book addresses these issues where they relate to the college and its graduates, but the purpose here is not to assess the broader legacy of the British Raj. The railway, irrigation, and road infrastructure built in India by the British, in many cases by Coopers Hill engineers, has often been considered one of the beneficial legacies of colonial rule. The Coopers Hill men certainly thought this way. Colonial authors such as Maud Diver in The Unsung and Col. E.W.C. Sandes in The Military Engineer in India naturally agreed. Historian Ian Hay\n\nDastardly Murder\n\n7\n\nwrote that the Public Works Department men ensured “the dams hold, the canals irrigate, the grass grows, and the British Raj endures.”17 Some more recent authors such as Kartar Lalvani in The Making of India adopt a more balanced but similarly positive view of the legacy left by British engineers. Passionate nationalists, of whom Shashi Tharoor is a prominent recent example, are opposed to this perspective. He wrote about the railways, “In its very conception and construction, the Indian railway system was a big colonial scam.” In this view, the infrastructural legacy of the Raj was an incidental by-product of the imperial objectives of maintaining military supremacy and increasing agricultural and resource revenues – a by-product, moreover, that came at great cost to the Indian people. Of Coopers Hill specifically, Tharoor stated that the entrance examination was “designed to exclude the majority of Indian candidates.”18 The nature of the entrance exam and the admission of Indians to both Coopers Hill and the Indian Public Works Department are addressed later in the present work. Between these contrasting views lies a wealth of historical enquiry into the motivations, implementations, and implications of British public works in India. Detailed references will be given in the relevant sections, but works such as Technology and the Raj (Macleod and Kumar) and Science, Technology, and Medicine in Colonial India (Arnold), explored the broad social and economic effects of the combination of technological change and imperial policies.19 In specific disciplines related to Coopers Hill, Ian Kerr has examined the construction and history of India’s railways, including an account of the Indian workforce that actually constructed them.20 The multifaceted role of the telegraph in British India has been explored by Chaudhuri in Telegraphic Imperialism. British policies concerning forest management and irrigation had lasting social and environmental consequences that have gained great modern interest and have been addressed in major works such as Nature, Culture, Imperialism (Arnold and Guha), Environment and Empire (Beinart and Hughes), The British Empire and the Natural World (Kumar, Damodaran, and D’Souza), and This Fissured Land (Gadgil and Guha).21 In part, the present work can be regarded as an engineering counterpart to David Gilmour’s The Ruling Caste and The British in India, insofar as it relates the experiences of individuals living and working in India.22 But whereas those works (and many others) concentrate on members of the army or civil service, the focus here is on the training and experiences of the British Empire’s technical services, which have received considerably less attention. By focusing on the period from 1871 to 1906, it also serves as a prequel to Aparajith Ramnath’s The Birth of an Indian Profession, which considered the emergence of the Indian engineering profession after the closure of Coopers Hill.23 In addition, it complements and extends the previous partial histories of the college. In 1960, J.G.P. Cameron, a former student, wrote A Short History of the Royal Indian\n\n8\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nEngineering College – a brief overview for circulation to Coopers Hill alumni24 – whereas a more detailed account of the governmental and institutional aspects of the college was given by Brendan Cuddy in his doctoral dissertation, “The Royal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill (1871–1906): A Case Study of State Involvement in Professional Civil Engineering Education.”25 The present volume is therefore the first complete history of the Royal Indian Engineering College, a vision originally conceived more than a century ago by its graduates.26 Goals In this context, this book has two overall goals: to understand the culture, education, and achievements of its students, and to assess the significance of Coopers Hill in the picture of the British Empire and its engineering education. The college’s brief existence and present obscurity27 belie its contemporary prominence. With its government backing, a prominent founder, outstanding professors, and the lure of a guaranteed job in India, Coopers Hill made a big impact in its early years. The entrance examinations were widely advertised, the annual prize day was attended by dignitaries and reported in national newspapers, and its sporting achievements were legendary – all of which drew attention to the fledgling college. In progressing from Cheltenham College to Coopers Hill, and to India, Edmund Elliot was following an established pathway. Studying at Coopers Hill was expensive.28 It was designed to attract relatively wealthy families by offering their sons a career in India comparable, but never quite equal, in prestige to the army or civil service.29 By combining a technical education with traditional “manly” pursuits (Elliot, for example, was captain of boats), Coopers Hill was a natural destination for young men with an English public school education. And as a college that was considered comparable with Oxbridge and Trinity College Dublin,30 it contributed to the increased respectability and wider appeal of engineering to the upper middle classes.31 Although not the only institution at the time to offer engineering training, Coopers Hill at its opening provided a systematic, comprehensive technical education that was ahead of its time in Britain, particularly in the combination of theory and practice. It brought engineering education into the spotlight and arguably stimulated other institutions to expand and enhance their own programs. Ironically, their success in this regard contributed to Coopers Hill’s eventual closure. The capital costs of Coopers Hill and any annual operating deficits were financed by the state out of revenues from India. The public universities were unhappy about the government subsidizing a competitor, particularly in the 1880s when the college was opened to students not going to India.32 It was\n\nDastardly Murder\n\n9\n\nalso a source of anxiety for successive administrators of Coopers Hill because of repeated demands to make the college self-sustaining. This experiment in state-run education effectively concluded when the government declared that Coopers Hill was not an institution of higher learning at all, but a training establishment more akin to a military academy. In 2018, another new technical university was established in England with initial support from the government. Like Coopers Hill nearly 150 years earlier, the New Model in Technology and Engineering (NMiTE) intends to offer a new engineering education designed to meet the needs of its time. Indeed, the parallels between opening an engineering school in 1871 and today are surprisingly strong. The issues of financial sustainability, start-up funding for facilities, student recruitment, and building reputation are essentially the same as those faced by Coopers Hill. So too are the challenges of including practical experience in the curriculum and meeting the expectations of external bodies (the Public Works Department or accreditation bodies). For the same reasons, student tuition fees in engineering are still relatively high. A study of Coopers Hill, one of the first engineering schools, therefore reveals the origins of dilemmas in engineering education that are still relevant. A Legacy of Monumental Works Other dilemmas result from the nature of the engineering work itself. At the last Coopers Hill Prize Day in July 1906, Sir John Ottley stated, “The RIEC may be abolished but the name of ‘Coopers Hill’ will ever live in the monumental works erected in India by her sons.”33 The Coopers Hill men viewed their legacy in the wholly positive light of their Indian accomplishments. In view of the number of their works still in use today, this belief has justification: William Johns and Charles Cole’s Mushkaf-Bolan Railway is still in use, likewise Herbert Harington’s Kalka-Shimla Line and George Rose’s Khojak Tunnel; Robert Gales’s Hardinge Bridge still stands; the descendants of Eustace Kenyon and Ernest Hudson’s telegraph system faithfully transmitted messages throughout India until 2013; the mile-long Mettur Dam constructed in part by Vincent Hart still holds back almost 100 billion cubic feet of water; and John Benton’s Swat River Canal still carries water through the lengthy tunnel constructed by William Sangster. But that is not the whole story, for even perfectly sound technical engineering can have far-reaching and unanticipated consequences. Eloquent arguments have been made that British rule left no positive legacy in India.34 In addition, much has been written specifically on the social and environmental impacts of railway construction, irrigation projects, and forestry practices in British India, implemented by engineers, with the conclusion that there were undoubtedly negative effects.35 Knowledge and policies varied with time but, broadly, social\n\n10\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nand environmental consequences were either known, but subordinate to British imperial interests, or unexpected. The first category would include such issues as agricultural policies, enabled by irrigation, that moved people away from well-understood farming practices and left them susceptible to famine;36 deforestation due in part to the vast numbers of wooden sleepers (ties) used in railway construction, as well as being used to power locomotives;37 and a transportation and communication infrastructure more suited for maintaining British authority and trade than for ­serving the Indian population.38 Into the second category would fall creation by irrigation of damp breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit malaria;39 the long-term effects of coppicing in wet climates;40 silting of waterways;41 and the increased urbanization and spread of disease facilitated by the railways.42 In many cases, the engineers of the time were aware of the issues, but solutions were either not known or not implemented because of cost.43 Engineering at the time of Coopers Hill, especially on the scales possible in India and Africa, was perhaps the first instance of a paradoxical situation that is still with us. They had the technology, wealth, organization, and determination to undertake engineering projects with massive implications. However, they frequently lacked the understanding of what those implications might be, or the motivation to develop such understanding. Facing today’s global climate change, a plastic waste crisis, and the imminent extinction of one million species, it seems we have learned little from experiences in India. Overview With the foregoing as motivation and context for this study, four broad questions guide the discussion: (1) Why was Coopers Hill established and how did it go about its fulfilling its mandate? (2) What did the college graduates do in India and how did their education equip them for this work? (3) How did increasing diversity and progress in engineering education contribute to the college’s closure? (4) What does the extraordinarily long-lived Coopers Hill Society tell us about the men who attended the college? Chapters 2 through 4 address question 1. The government’s motivation for establishing Coopers Hill is examined with reference to the education and supply of engineers for India prior to 1871. George Chesney’s brilliant leadership made Coopers Hill a reality and shaped the college’s ethos, while the Duke of Argyll’s political support was instrumental in obtaining parliamentary approval. The admission process and academic curriculum during the first decade of 1871 to 1880 were designed to build the professional and personal characteristics that Chesney believed were needed in India. Chapter 3\n\nDastardly Murder\n\n11\n\nexamines how the college survived and maintained its relevance in the face of fiscal challenges and external changes during the years from 1871 to 1896, the period of the first two presidents. College magazines, personal diaries, and later recollections are used in chapter 4 to recreate a picture of student life that shows how successfully Coopers Hill managed to educate engineers and build their esprit de corps. Chapters 5 through 7 approach the second question by using a combination of personal accounts and official sources to build a picture of the graduates’ experiences in India. Most of our personal accounts of life in British India come from government officials or military men. In contrast, first-hand accounts of the work of technical officers in the field are rare. Unlike their civil service counterparts, telegraph officers and engineers were involved in construction projects, sometimes on a very large scale. Ernest Hudson’s diaries, written between 1889 and 1908 (chapter 5), are one of the very few accounts that survive of the logistics and organization of telegraph line construction in India. His descriptions of inspecting and maintaining the lines reveal a wealth of information about how this fundamental component of India’s infrastructure worked in practice. While forest officers were not involved in construction works, their technical work underpinned the vast Indian forestry system, the results of which have been highly controversial. The improved understanding of the work and perspectives of a forest officer obtained from the 1892–1911 Osmaston diaries in chapter 6 therefore offer a valuable insight into these issues. Because engineers in the PWD constructed many types of infrastructure, chapter 7 examines the work of Coopers Hill engineers primarily through selected technical publications and secondarily from personal accounts. It highlights the natural and logistical challenges faced by the engineers and their innovative solutions, as well as some of the unforeseen issues that resulted. These chapters therefore provide a valuable addition to the understanding of the roles and practices of technical officers in the field in India. Additionally, information in these three chapters is used to analyse how their education at Coopers Hill prepared them for their duties, thereby addressing question 2. The tenures of the college’s third and fourth presidents were marked by crisis, as described in chapter 8. The thirty-five years of Coopers Hill’s existence coincide with a period of significant change in the technical, educational, and societal landscapes of British and Indian engineering. Chapter 8 therefore approaches question 3 by considering the response of Coopers Hill to emerging engineering disciplines, such as electrical engineering, and the increasing student diversity as it approached the turn of the twentieth century. During the same period, the numbers of engineering students at British colleges and universities had also grown rapidly. The influence of these factors on the decision to close Coopers Hill is studied.\n\n12\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nChapter 9 then looks at events after Coopers Hill was closed in order to address question 4. It traces the history of the Coopers Hill Society over its nearly sixty years and discusses the attitude of its members towards Indian independence, the progress of professional ethics, and issues related to retirement and pensions, including their life expectancy. Finally, the strands of the book’s narrative are drawn together into concluding remarks and reflections that gauge the long-term impact of Coopers Hill and its graduates.\n\n2 “This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\nBackdrop The Pioneer newspaper first broke the news of Edmund Elliot’s murder on the Bareilly-Rampur-Moradabad Railway two days after the crime itself – first the bare facts, and over the next few days with increasing (but not wholly consistent) detail. During the trial of Robert Fenelon Hawkins, which opened on 13 November 1893,1 more details of the tragedy came to light. Duties of the accused “included the measuring of work done by contractors and superintending the construction of a bridge over the river Kosi.”2 The trial is informative because it represents one source of contemporary information about the lives and duties of engineers in India. The events on the morning of Hawkins’s dismissal for insubordination were described as follows: Mr. Elliot was killed on the 30th. On 28th August an order was passed by Mr. ­Elliot and communicated to [Mr. Hawkins]. It was kept in a correspondence book containing official orders about the work. Orders were written on the left hand side by Mr. Elliot, and prisoner made any note he wished to make on the right hand side. This order of the 28th called on prisoner to leave and proceed to Moradabad, where he would be settled up with. [After his dismissal] Prisoner was directed to meet Mr. Elliot on the morning of the 30th at chain 190 on the railway line, where they would go over the measurements, and he was asked to have the contractors present. Chain 190 was about half way between Kosi and Mundha. About 7 o’clock on the 30th Mr. Elliot drove to the river and crossed it. A tum-tum was waiting for him and he drove towards Mundha. Several khalasis,3 whose presence was required to make measurements, met him and kept close to the tum-tum till they reached chain 190, where Mr. Elliot left the tum-tum and went towards the embankment.\n\n14\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nPrisoner was standing at the foot of the embankment, which is from five to ten feet high. Jhinguri, one of the khalasis, followed Mr. Elliot closely, the others were a little farther off, but could see and hear what followed. When Mr. Elliot went up to prisoner, something passed between them, described by the witnesses as a salutation. That was all that was said. At this time the prisoner was holding two books in his left hand. Mr. Elliot went past the prisoner to go up the mound, and as soon as he passed, prisoner took out a pistol and fired at him. He was so close to prisoner that his clothes were singed. He turned round and the prisoner fired again, and Mr. Elliot fell, and after an interval prisoner fired a third time. Prisoner then went along the side of the embankment to his hut on the river bank, and told his Madrasi clerk, Ramayar, to muster the men and to tell them all that he had shot Mr. Elliot. He then returned to the hut, and sent off a duplicate telegram to Mrs. R.F. Hawkins [his wife] and Mrs. V.E. Hawkins, Madras [his mother] – “Battle of Kosi over. I have shot Mr. Elliot. You will therefore never see me again. Good-bye.\"4\n\nElliot’s body was taken to Moradabad that same evening for burial, accompanied by Mrs. Elliot and some friends. The newspaper report commented, “Socially Mr. and Mrs. Elliot’s genial and open hospitality has been well known much beyond the small circle at Rampur.”5 It seems that the root of the conflict was the “dissatisfaction on the part of Mr. Elliot with [Hawkins’s] work, and the belief on the part of prisoner that he was unjustly accused; and that proper deference was not paid to his social position.” No doubt this refers in part to the different backgrounds of the two men; Elliot was a “British-Indian,” whereas Hawkins was an “Eurasian.” At the time of Coopers Hill, “Anglo-Indian” could refer to the children of British parents serving in India,6 but later came to be used in place of Eurasian, people of mixed heritage. The term “country born” was used at the time to describe “non-transients, who could include domiciled Europeans or Anglo-Indians.”7 Writing in 1935, James W. Best commented wryly, “During my time in India ‘Natives’ became Indians, Eurasians became Anglo-Indians, the old-time Anglo-Indians became Europeans, and I suppose that the old-time English should become Anglo-Anglians.”8 G.A. Campbell, the executive engineer in charge of the Bareilly-RampurMoradabad Railway gave evidence of his knowledge of the conflict between Elliot and Hawkins, to the effect that he had never observed Elliot treating Hawkins with anything other than “politeness and consideration.” The court also satisfied itself that the long, drawn-out nature of the disagreement precluded a defence of temporary insanity. The defence countered that the evidence of a doctor who was asked by the police to determine the matter and who “spoke with the prisoner for two or three minutes, and from that he judged that he was not insane,” was inadequate, and that the jury should take that into account during sentencing.\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n15\n\nThe defence’s appeal was in vain, and the judge, in imposing the death penalty, commented that he had “never known a more scandalously unprovoked, indefensible and inexcusable murder.”9 Hawkins was hanged in January 1894.10 It is apparent that the establishment was, consciously or not, stepping in to protect its lines of authority, with little sympathy for Hawkins’s personal demons, or the fate of his wife and young children.11 Nevertheless, we do learn something about being an engineer in India. We see the supervising engineer being responsible for his section of the railway line, with European and Indian subordinates responsible for individual tasks, and contractors doing some or all of the implementation, such as embankments and bridges. He might live in a small community near the worksite, with a boss at a distant town. Orders were communicated through a correspondence book, to allow for periods when the engineers did not often meet each other. The case offers a glimpse of the misery that a poisonous atmosphere in a small community could cause, where people and their families both worked and socialized together, contrasting ideas of “genial and open hospitality” with issues of social position. We also find that the thirty-six-year-old Elliot was in a position of some authority on local engineering projects, but that Hawkins, just two years younger, was only a temporary engineer. These matters will be discussed further in chapter 7. Public Works in India The Royal Indian Engineering College was designed to provide a direct pipeline of young men like Edmund Elliot from the relatively well-off families of Britain and Ireland to the railways, canals, and telegraphs of India. A big attraction of the college in its early days was that a position in the Indian PWD was guaranteed for successful graduates. In later years this ceased to be the case as the demand in India slowed, but this was the very reason for the formation and funding of Coopers Hill. “Public works” comprised “the construction and repairs of all state buildings, civil and military, as well as the prosecution of roads, railways, and irrigation works.” Public works was under the auspices of the Military Board until 1854, when Lord Dalhousie separated it into a standalone department. Chesney describes the typical administrative structure:12 “A Chief Engineer is placed at the head of the Public Works Department in each province, who is also secretary to the provincial government. Under him are the Superintending Engineers of Circles, while the actual execution of work is conducted by the next grade of officers, styled Executive Engineers, aided by Assistant Engineers, with a staff of subordinates. As a rule, the same engineer carries out all the works, whether of roads or buildings, within his district or division.”13\n\n16\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nAs usual, Elliot had been appointed as an assistant engineer and had been promoted to executive engineer by the time of his death. When Coopers Hill opened in 1871, the demand for railway engineers (and public works engineers) was on the increase. A particular exception to this trend occurred in the early 1890s when there was a major construction slump, coincident with Elliot’s murder.14 This may account for Hawkins’s anxiety about not getting proper credit for his work; it was a tough time to be a temporary engineer looking for railway work. Engineering Education in England In the late 1860s, during the recovery from the stagnation following the violence of 1857, the budget for Indian public works had reached £7.5 million.15 The shortage of qualified engineers available to construct these works had become pressing. The two key words here are “qualified” and “engineer,” neither of which was especially well defined in the 1860s. The idea of engineering as a profession had been taking hold in Britain since the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in 1818. Nevertheless, there remained the uncertainty – and one that unfortunately still persists – about whether the engineer drives the train or designs and builds the train. In Daily Life in Victorian England, Mitchell notes that “someone called simply an engineer was likely to be a skilled worker [metalsmiths, shipbuilders, engine drivers, maintainers of machines] rather than a professional,” while the more educated and scientific men called themselves “civil engineers.”16 Originally, the word “civil” distinguished its practitioners from “military” engineers, who were responsible for infrastructure and logistics in the army. The ICE thus claimed to represent all non-military engineers, even after the formation in 1847 of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and other organizations representing the specialized disciplines of mining engineers, electrical engineers, and naval architects. Edmund Elliot, like many of his colleagues, joined the ICE. Until the formation of Coopers Hill, there was arguably no comprehensive university-level education available for civil engineers in England. The training of engineers had traditionally been by the pupilage system, whereby a man would join the workplace of an established engineer for several years to learn the profession, essentially as an apprentice. This idea remained firmly rooted in the psyche of the profession until well into the twentieth century. Roughly speaking, only one-third of applicants to the ICE in 1885–6 had a technical education; this had increased to two-thirds by 1913–14.17 However, the first cracks started to appear in the pupilage system in around 1870. There was a growing sense that British engineering was falling behind competitor countries, a view crystallized by the dismal showing of British\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n17\n\ntechnology at the Paris Great Exhibition in 1867, and perhaps even earlier.18 “It was the Exhibition of 1867 in Paris which gave the nations, and especially England, a final lesson. By that Exhibition we were rudely awakened and thoroughly alarmed. We then learnt, not that we were equalled, but that we were beaten – not on some points, but by some nation or other on nearly all those points on which we had prided ourselves.”19 The issue was first brought to public attention by Lyon Playfair, an Indian-born Scot, professor of chemistry, and Liberal politician, who had served as juror in the great exhibitions of 1851, 1862, and 1867. In a letter to the chairman of the commission enquiring into school reform at the time, he reported the opinions of “many eminent men of different nations” and was “sorry to say that, with very few exceptions, a singular accordance of opinion prevailed that our country had shown little inventiveness and made but little progress in the peaceful arts of industry since 1862.”20 His letter appeared in the 19 July 1867 edition of the Engineer, along with support from other eminent scientists. One correspondent had “to admit that our British portion of the display was generally meagre and defective.”21 Playfair concluded with a recommendation that the government should conduct a more formal enquiry into the issue. Instead, it was the ICE itself that “felt it their duty to interest themselves in that part of the inquiry which bore on their own profession.” The Education and Status of Civil Engineers in the United Kingdom and in Foreign Countries22 consisted of a compilation of reports from groups examining different aspects of the issue. For a report that stemmed from an anxiety that British technical education was neglected, the tone of the overview of the status of engineering education is remarkably complacent. The overview is reproduced below to show succinctly the establishment view of the matter on the cusp of the Royal Indian Engineering College’s creation. To the modern eye, the deficiencies of this approach are clear: There is … in England no public provision for engineering education. Every candidate for the profession must get his technical, like his general education, as best he can.… The education of an Engineer is, in fact, effected by a process analogous to that followed generally in trades, namely, by a simple course of apprenticeship, usually with a premium,23 to a practising Engineer; during which the pupil is supposed, by taking part in the ordinary business routine, to become gradually familiar with the practical duties of the profession, so as at last to acquire competency to perform them alone, or, at least, after some further practical experience in a subordinate capacity. It is not the custom in England to consider theoretical knowledge as absolutely essential. It is true that most considerate masters recommend that such knowledge should be acquired, and prefer such pupils as have in some degree attained it, and\n\n18\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nit is also true that intelligent and earnest-minded pupils often spontaneously devote themselves, both before and during their pupilage, to theoretical studies; but these cases, though happily much more frequent now than formerly, really amount only to voluntary departures from the general rule.24\n\nQuestions of practice versus theory and work experience versus higher education have resonance to this day. The crux is that engineering requires both theory and practice, and educational systems continue to grapple with achieving the appropriate balance of the two in what is often, unlike medicine and law, a direct-entry degree. In the early days of engineering when scientific understanding of materials was primitive, “rules of thumb” and other empirical tools passed down from master to apprentice in the “shop” served the profession well. But as projects became more ambitious, diverse, complex, and expensive, it became necessary to predict with greater certainty how new designs would perform before making them.25 This demanded a knowledge of mathematics and theory. Increasingly engineering advances would come directly from making and applying scientific breakthroughs, and a “school culture” developed.26 This new reality also demanded a higher ethical standard from engineers, leading to the legal regulation of the profession and pledges such as the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer in Canada. In the 1860s, however, the main issue with the pupilage system was the complete absence of any quality control. The ICE did not conduct exams or enforce any technical expectations of those who completed their training. Many engineers received excellent training through the pupilage system, but this was far from guaranteed. Although Fleeming Jenkin was exaggerating to make his point, his inaugural address as professor of engineering at the University of Edinburgh in 1868 revealed something of the situation: “In England, the path to employment as an engineer lies through the office or workshop of a civil or mechanical engineer, and therefore we find that young Englishmen and their parents crowd the doors of the offices and workshops, offering premiums of £300 or £500 for the mere permission to pass three years unheeded inside the magic gates, which must be passed to gain an entrance into the profession.”27 A more pragmatic version noted, “The office of an Engineer is not, and probably cannot be made, an educational establishment. In the first place, he has too much personal occupation to be able to attend much to pupils; and in the next place, where work has to be got through, a pupil will inevitably be more or less kept to what is most pressing, or what he can do best.”28 In addition to specialist establishments such as the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Naval Architecture, the 1870 ICE report listed a number of institutions that offered elements of an engineering education and had been doing so since the early decades of the century. Typically, an institution offered full or part programs leading to certificates or diplomas in engineering.\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n19\n\nThis group included University College London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Trinity College Dublin, and the recently formed Owens College, Manchester (precursor to the University of Manchester). King’s College London was at the forefront of post-secondary education in engineering, offering a three-year program to thirty to fifty students, amongst the largest enrolments in the country. The total number of people taking a technical education in Britain was therefore modest, largely because the profession did not see this as an acceptable route to becoming an engineer.29 The prospectus for Owens College was typical in stating that “the course will furnish a thorough scientific groundwork for … the higher branches of the Engineering profession, but it is not intended to supersede the practical training which can only be obtained in the office of a Civil, or the workshop of a Mechanical, Engineer.” The exception was Trinity College Dublin, whose students, on completing the program, were “supposed to be at once competent, without pupilage, to undertake professional practice.” But the pattern was consistent – scientific background at the institution, practical engineering in the workplace. The curriculum at Coopers Hill would be the first to offer a combined education in theoretical and practical engineering. Subjects covered by these courses included a strong emphasis on natural sciences and math, some coverage of civil and mechanical engineering, drawing, and surveying. The three-session course at UCL was typical: pure and applied mathematics, applied mechanics, physics, physical laboratory, chemistry, chemical laboratory, civil and mechanical engineering, mechanical drawing and designing, surveying and levelling, and geology. After 1870 the number of universities offering technical education grew swiftly. Arguably the first recognizable engineering degree was offered at the University of Glasgow in 1872 as a result of the pioneering work of W.J. Macquorn Rankine. Oxford and Cambridge Universities ventured into the applied sciences with the creation of their great Clarendon and Cavendish labs in early 1870s, and the appointment of A.B.W. Kennedy to the chair of Civil Engineering at UCL in 1874 led to a revival of that institution’s programs. Universities at Newcastle, Leeds, Bristol, and Sheffield established engineering studies in the 1870s, followed by Birmingham, Nottingham, and Liverpool in the next decade.30 By 1925 half of the applicants to the ICE held a technical degree, and by the Second World War the normal route to membership was a three-year degree and two years of practical training.31 So, at the time Coopers Hill was being contemplated, the pupilage system was strongly entrenched in the profession and would remain so for some decades. University programs were seen as optional supplements to the core apprenticeship. However, there were a few champions of a more systematic approach to educating engineers who were gradually having an impact. By the early 1900s the notion of a university education in engineering had achieved\n\n20\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nmore widespread acceptance. The relatively short existence of Coopers Hill therefore precisely bridged these two worlds. The question of the extent to which Coopers Hill blazed the trail or merely reflected the changing times will be addressed later. The 1870 ICE report contained a section devoted to suggestions from eminent men for the optimal education of engineers.32 Many were modifications of the pupilage system, such as introducing two years of technical education, starting at an age of fifteen or sixteen, at a university to prepare young men for pupilage. There was also talk of introducing examinations, conducted either by the universities or by the institution, to determine technical competency to join the profession. Eventually, the ICE introduced entrance examinations in 1896. Nowadays, many countries have a legal framework requiring practising engineers to hold a licence. To become licensed the engineer must demonstrate technical competence through a series of examinations or by graduating from an accredited college or university engineering program. A Man of Unquestionable Talent While the engineering profession was working on its response to Playfair’s concerns about British competitiveness, another set of reforms was being proposed, this time in India. The remarkable General (later Sir) George Tomkyns Chesney (1830–95)33 published two works: a history of British rule in India with suggestions for its future development entitled Indian Polity (in 1870), and an exploration of the role of the Royal Engineers in Indian public works projects, the rather less catchy Memorandum on the Employment of the Corps of Royal Engineers in India (in 1868).34 Partly on the strength of this work, Chesney became the champion and first principal of the Royal Indian Engineering College. Chesney (see figure 2.1) entered the East India Company’s Addiscombe College in 1847, shortly before his seventeenth birthday.35 The curriculum there focused on mathematics and sciences with an application to military engineering. While professing military ethos and discipline, the reality under some principals seems to have been rather different – fisticuffs with the townspeople, forgery of letters of leave, and spying on the cadets by the sergeants.36 George Chesney finished the standard two-year program at Addiscombe in 1848, one of five engineering cadets. He does not appear to have partaken of the cadets’ hijinks (or was too smart to get caught), for on graduation he was awarded the prize of a sword by the directors of the East India Company “as a testimony of their approbation of your exemplary conduct at this institution.”37 Chesney proceeded to India in 1850 to join the Bengal Engineers, where he was wounded in action at Delhi during the Indian uprising. Later, he joined the Public Works Department and for two periods (1856, 1858–9) served as an assistant principal at the Thomason Civil Engineering College in Roorkee,\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n21\n\nFigure 2.1. General Sir George T. Chesney, KCB CSI CIE, in later life (Illustrated London News, 6 April 1895, 406)\n\nIndia.38 Between 1860 and 1867 Chesney was head of the new Public Works Account and Finance Department, where he devoted his energies to reorganizing public works and financial administration, advocating for reforms to increase their efficiency. Field-Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar later referred to Chesney as “a man of unquestionable talent and sound judgement.”39 Indian Polity and the Memorandum were both informed by these experiences.\n\n22\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nBattle of Dorking Strangely, Chesney would become a household name not for any of these achievements but for a work of fiction. The Battle of Dorking, originally published anonymously in Blackwood’s Magazine in May 1871, proved to be an immediate and immense success; within two months over 100,000 issues had been sold,40 Blackwood’s were printing more, and translations into other languages were underway. Speculation about the author’s identity was rampant – the Pall Mall Gazette was the first to get the correct answer in its 18 July edition. In The Battle of Dorking, an old army volunteer tells his grandchildren the story of the successful invasion of Britain fifty years previously by a Germanspeaking foreign power. As he was writing the story, Chesney summarized the plot to the publisher, John Blackwood: “We have the quarrel with America and Russia, dispersion of all our forces, followed by rising in India. Sudden appearance of Germany on the scene. Sentimental platitudes of Messrs Gladstone & Co., triming [sic] leaders in the ‘Times.’ Destruction of our ‘Field Line’ by new torpedoes. Arrival of 100,000 Sanscrit-speaking Junkers brimming over with ‘Geist’ and strategy. Hurried defence of the chalk-range by the volunteers and militia, no commissariat, line turned, total defeat, retreat on London, occupation of that place, and general smash up.”41 The story caused a furore, which further fuelled the huge surge in readers. To some it was a grave insult to the honour and expertise of the British forces. To others it was a wake-up call. For most it undermined the nation’s sense of superiority. This had already been shaken by the decisiveness of the very recent Prussian victory over the French using modern technology, and the resulting shift in the balance of European power. The story’s repercussions were felt in the country’s highest levels. In superbly dramatic fashion, Chesney had drawn attention to his concerns about the cost-cutting agenda of Prime Minister William Gladstone’s Liberal government. As Chesney put it in March 1871, “If the Government [Gladstone’s] had brought in a really good Army Bill, the words would have been taken out of my mouth, but as it turns out, they have left me with virgin soil to work upon.”42 Although it was not the first story of its kind, the timing, good storytelling, and compelling military authenticity of The Battle of Dorking have established it as “the first major example in what would become a long line of popular pre1914 invasion-scare narratives.”43 The sales and impact of Dorking are all the more remarkable for being the work of a first-time author of fiction, written in the midst of all the preparations for Coopers Hill.44 Chesney was later described as “an officer of statesman-like intelligence, untiring energy, and great administrative power,”45 but equally telling is John Blackwood’s contemporary summary: “He is a little chap, very bright and fresh-looking.”46\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n23\n\nEngineers for India Chesney’s thoughts in the Memorandum about the shortage of engineers for the Indian PWD therefore carried weight. The primary cause of the shortage was the swiftly increasing investment in Indian public works, combined with a reduced supplement of engineers from the army (because of better opportunities elsewhere). The Indian government responded with a request for more engineers, while desiring the current proportion of military and civilian personnel to remain unchanged. In 1868 the proportions were roughly equal, a big change from a decade earlier when almost all engineers were military. Because much of the recent recruitment was of civilians, “the majority of the upper ranks belong to the [military] class, and by far the greater part of their juniors to the [civil] class.”47 The equal proportion could not be maintained in the short term because it took time to train Royal Engineers, first through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and then at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham. Moreover “the authorities at the Horse Guards” refused any immediate transfer of engineers from other duties. So the effective situation was that civil engineers from a variety of sources were being recruited to fill the gap. Chesney noted first that thirty engineers “of standing and professional experience” had been sent to India in February 1867 on five-year covenants. Shortly afterwards, another fifty were sent on similar terms, although these were “on the whole younger men than the first batch.”48 Chesney observed that this recruiting of qualified engineers to India was unlikely to be sustainable on the terms the government was offering,49 especially as it necessitated convincing established engineers in Britain to move to India. Salary was a persistent source of tension between the civilian and military engineers because the latter continued to draw their military pay in addition to a salary from the PWD. The sporadic influx into the PWD of engineers inexperienced in Indian affairs also caused its difficulties: “The admission of men of standing in large numbers to [the railway] branch has been resented by those already belonging to it, and whose advancement has, of course, been retarded in consequence.”50 Second, engineers were recruited through the annual competitive examinations for civil engineer appointments held at the India Office. The idea was that young men who had completed at least three years as a pupil with an established engineer and who passed the exam would be sent to India at state expense to receive language and further technical education at one of the Indian civil engineering colleges. This scheme was started in 1859 while Lord Stanley was secretary of state for India, and these men were accordingly dubbed “Stanley Engineers.” Unfortunately, the scheme struggled from the first, with few candidates achieving the required passing grade in the examination, and then those men performing poorly at the Indian colleges. Indeed, such was the government’s desperation for engineers that the college part of the scheme\n\n24\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nwas dropped, and the probationary engineers were deployed as soon as they arrived. The PWD was also concerned about “maintaining two quite different standards of qualification for admission into the service, a high one in India, a low one in England.”51 Even as early as 1862, the PWD was “rather doubtful to what extent any mere competitive examination can be trusted in the selection of persons for this sort of occupation.”52 Writing in 1868 after some years of the Stanley Scheme, Chesney observed that the PWD was hardly likely to obtain more engineers when the scheme had rarely reached its target in the past, especially when on the most recent occasion only twenty of forty-four applicants had passed the examination. Chesney pinpointed the difficulty and foreshadowed what was to come: Even if the competition were severe, the system appears so far defective that, in a brief examination, the candidate’s acquaintance with some of the most important parts of an engineer’s education – his practical knowledge of work and surveying – cannot be tested properly, while in theoretical engineering there is not much scope for examination, since this is a subject in which, under the present system of professional training, the pupils of civil engineers receive ordinarily no methodical instruction, but are left to pick up their knowledge as best they may.… The difficulty of the case suggests the idea whether it would not be worth while to establish a regular school for the young civil engineers intended for India, where they could receive a sound professional education, and a thorough course of surveying gone through under supervision.… It would be easy to arrange also that the students should get a practical acquaintance with works. An invaluable result of such an establishment would be the esprit de corps it would tend to foster, and an identification of its alumni with the interests of Government, a thing very much wanted in the department at present.53\n\nDespite the continued addition of some military engineers into the PWD by various means, the make-up of the department was therefore inevitably moving from the military to the civil. In 1861, civil engineers made up 39 per cent of the total Public Works Department engineers (201 of 518), increasing to 59 per cent (533 of 896) by 1869.54 Chesney advocated approaching the Royal Engineers again: “Is it impossible, then, I would respectfully ask, that the authorities at the Horse Guards should be asked to reconsider their first opinion, and under the emergency of the case, to lend at least a portion of the officers now wanted for service in India?”55 To make it palatable to Horse Guards, he suggested that the mix of men lent by the Royal Engineers should be in the usual proportion of field officers, captains, and subalterns, rather than just the young men the PWD originally requested, to avoid unbalancing the composition of the force in Britain. He also proposed\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n25\n\nthat men being trained in Chatham could forgo part of that course in favour of an earlier start to practical training in India. The response to these suggestions would prove inadequate to meet India’s needs. Nevertheless, George Chesney’s impact through Indian Polity and the Memorandum would lead to his critical participation in the establishment of the Royal Indian Engineering College, which would meet that demand. Thomason Civil Engineering College, Roorkee As mentioned above, the Stanley Engineers completed their training at one of the Indian civil engineering colleges. While several universities and colleges in India offered some elements of engineering training (including the shortlived Fort William Civil Engineering College in Calcutta, where Chesney served briefly as principal),56 the only college that took Stanley Engineers was the Thomason Civil Engineering College at Roorkee.57 Established in 1847, ­Roorkee was the country’s principal engineering school58 “designed to give theoretical and practical instruction in Civil Engineering to Europeans and Natives, with a view to their employment on the public works of the country, according to their several qualifications and the requirements of the Service.”59 Unlike Coopers Hill, Thomason College thrives today as part of the Indian Institutes of Technology system, maintaining a strong reputation in a wide range of engineering and applied technology fields. As early as 1845, the progressive intent of the college’s founder, James Thomason, lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, seems to have been to bring Europeans and Indians under the same roof for an engineering education. In particular, theoretically educated students from the British-style schools and colleges in India (mostly, but not necessarily, European) and the experienced practical men supervising the actual PWD construction (wholly Indian) should learn from each other: “It is evident that, if we can bring the former and the latter of these together … the one class might impart to the other the knowledge either of theory or of practice, which when found united, go to produce really a valuable and useful officer.”60 Unfortunately, the departmental structure of the college seems to have encouraged the separation of the different groups of students. Given the political situation of the time, with Britain still expanding and consolidating its rule of India, it would have been impossible to contemplate European and Indian students participating on an equal basis. Nevertheless, Roorkee was still exceptional in that it admitted both groups of students to the same institution.61 Of the three departments, the first was the so-called Engineer Class, designed to prepare engineers from the military or with a civil background (both Europeans and Indians) directly for PWD or other employment. Eight appointments per year were guaranteed to graduates of this class.62 The second was\n\n26\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nthe Upper Subordinate Class going to serve as overseers of public works under the authority of the engineers. These were non-commissioned officers from the army or Indians. Lastly, the third department was exclusively for Indian students seeking qualifications to work on public projects under the overseers. An Engineer Class student at Roorkee would engage in a curriculum consisting of mathematics and civil engineering, together representing more than 60 per cent of the total marks, and surveying, drawing, physical sciences, and technical “Oordoo” (Urdu).63 In the major block called Civil Engineering, students were instructed in construction techniques for buildings, bridges, roads railroads, and irrigation works. They also learned building materials, mechanics, and ground tracing, and visited engineering works and constructions sites. The Civil-English category was for graduates from British schools in India or people specifically educated in England for Roorkee. Candidates had to be between eighteen and twenty-two, submit to the principal an application, testimonials to good moral character, and a medical certificate to certify perfect vision and a “sound constitution.” There was also an entrance examination comprising languages (225 points), physical science (75), history (50), mathematics (310), and drawing (50). It was also possible to complete an approved equivalent exam through the University of Calcutta or elsewhere. Notably absent was the classical education that was especially valued by the upper and middle classes in England and would be required for entry into Coopers Hill. Indian students in the Engineer Class had to meet the same entrance requirements, but there were up to six positions carrying a stipend of Rs50 per month. The actual number of Indian students in the Engineer Class was small. Reviewing the “Yearly Lists of Passed Students” in the 1871–2 Roorkee calendar, it is noticeable that more Indian names appear in Engineering Class during the early years of the college, with none appearing between 1862 and 1870.64 On graduation, each of the eight or so engineers taken on by the PWD could expect to earn Rs100 per month as an engineer apprentice, with the expectation of promotion after a year to assistant engineer third grade on a salary of Rs250 per month. The Roorkee program lasted nineteen months (from 1 January to August of the following year), for a cost of roughly Rs1900, a sum that could be earned back in fifteen months of working for the PWD. In his 1868 Memorandum, Chesney was quick to acknowledge that “there can hardly be any doubt as to the propriety, not to say obligation, of throwing open the department to the natives of the country; but for some time to come at any rate the number of those qualifying for employment is likely to be but small.”65 Indeed, in the previous two decades only in 1859 did the number of Engineer Class students at Roorkee break into double digits; more typically it hovered between four and six. This number was limited mainly by the supply of suitably qualified recruits from local schools.66 This was clearly insufficient to meet Chesney’s predicted demand for PWD engineers.\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n27\n\nMoreover the newly arrived principal, Capt. A.M. Lang RE (Royal Engineers), in 1871 did not believe that capacity could be increased without additional investment in staff and facilities, and he presented a long list of additions and repairs needed for the college buildings.67 This did not prevent him from urging the PWD to increase its quota of eight positions for graduates of Roorkee: “Unless then more appointments are guaranteed to the passed Civil Engineering Students, I cannot see with unmixed satisfaction any further expansion of this particular class; nor can I hope to see many Natives join it although I consider that they have perhaps the first claims upon the College, and should be more encouraged to enter the higher grades of the P.W. Department.”68 To achieve this, he believed that all Indian students who passed should be offered positions in the PWD. But more than the cost and difficulty of increasing the number of Engineer Class graduates in India, it is clear that the authorities had a strong desire to educate future engineers for India in England, where they could keep a close eye on the “character” of the students and the quality of their training. In the following clever paragraph from his defence to Parliament of the proposal for Coopers Hill, Chesney simultaneously praises Roorkee’s success, uses that success as evidence that the state can operate a good engineering college, draws attention to Roorkee’s remoteness from “civilization” (both technical and social), and points out the expense of supporting Roorkee, while downplaying the costs of the new college (because it would attempt to cover its costs by charging tuition). It may not be out of place to refer to the success of Roorkee as a proof of what may be done by Government in the way of affording systematic training for its own servants. Roorkee labours under the drawbacks of climate and of distance from the great centres of scientific and professional movement, and those of its pupils who have been born and educated in India necessarily start at a disadvantage compared with young men brought up under the influences of European civilization. Yet Roorkee turns out so useful a body of servants, that, although their education (which is wholly gratuitous) is given at great cost to the State, the expenditure has always been ungrudgingly bestowed, and while there is hardly any branch of the India Education Department as to the utility of which public opinion is not often strongly divided, no doubt has ever been expressed about the propriety of maintaining Roorkee, and while the annual charge for it is almost continually increasing, no item in the Estimates is more certain to pass unchallenged. If so much can be done in a remote corner of India, we may reasonably expect a high degree of success here [England], without the cost.69\n\nAs we now know, the proposal to establish the Royal Indian Engineering College was successful; however, the outcome was in significant doubt up until the last moment.\n\n28\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nA New Indian Civil Engineering College A Political Champion In 1870, it was generally agreed there was a pressing need for engineers in India because of the increasing numbers of public works being carried out there. There were, however, some powerful obstacles to the creation of a new college. In India, the Royal Engineers who had so far been responsible for the bulk of Indian public works, and whose officers still comprised the upper echelons of the PWD, wanted to maintain their position of dominance. Moreover, Roorkee saw itself and the other Indian colleges as the natural suppliers of the needed engineers. In England, the bulk of the civil engineering profession, and the establishment interests they represented, strongly favoured a continuation of the pupilage system. Some vocal members of the profession argued that engineers should receive higher education in both theoretical and practical training, but most still saw little need for engineering colleges. Within the education profession, institutions such as King’s College, University College, Glasgow, and others who already had engineering activities, understandably believed that it would be more cost-effective for the government to support an expansion of their activities rather than to create a new institution. In the face of these numerous and entrenched objections, George Chesney needed a powerful ally in government to advance the cause of a new English engineering college. He found this ally in the form of the Duke of Argyll, secretary of state for India. Fortunately, there was no more powerful player in the post-1858 world of Indian governance than the secretary of state.70 To understand why, a brief overview is necessary of the main elements of Britain’s governance of India in 1871. In India, the viceroy/governor-general served as head of the government and local representative of the British monarch. He was advised by a council of six appointees, together grandly titled the Government of India, which was responsible for all matters of civilian and military administration. Along with its substantial retinue of administrative functionaries, it was located in Calcutta during the cool season (November to April) and at the cooler mountain resort of Simla in the summer.71 While the Government of India wielded strong administrative powers that flowed down to provincial governments and then the district officials, there remained a strong reporting and approvals line back to London, where the strategic policies and finances were determined. The Government of India maintained five departments: Home, Foreign, Financial, Military, and Public Works. In London, the India Office oversaw the Government of India and was headed by the secretary of state for India. He was the constitutional advisor\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n29\n\nto the Crown on the British governance of India, as well as a member of the Cabinet, accountable to Parliament for the administration of India. In reality the oversight by Parliament was not strongly exercised because funding for the India Office came from India itself and the Treasury had no control. The Government of India Act of 1858 gave the secretary of state power to “superintend, direct and control all acts, operations, and concerns which relate to the government and revenues of India.” The Council of India, also in London, was also established in 1858 to advise and moderate the actions of the secretary of state. This group consisted nominally of fifteen members, nine of whom must have had at least ten years’ recent service in India. In 1870, membership of the council was by appointment of the secretary of state for a term of ten years. This collective authority in London was often referred to as the Secretary of State in Council. In general, the secretary of state was required to present all non-urgent, non-secret matters to the council for a vote. On many matters he could overrule the council, provided he gave his reasons for doing so. One of the matters on which he could not overrule the council concerned “the grant or appropriation of any part of the revenues of India.” Since Coopers Hill was to be paid for by the Government of India, this clause meant that the establishment of the college needed the approval of the Council of India. However, it will prove relevant that meetings of the council were called by the secretary of state, and that the attendance of only five members (including himself) was necessary for quorum. Council of India Approval George Douglas Campbell, eighth Duke of Argyll, served as secretary of state for India in the government of William Gladstone from 1868 until 1874.72 ­Argyll had imperialist leanings, supporting the governance of India from London, but was content to consolidate the achievements of his predecessors in defining the office. One modern author described him unkindly as “gouty [and] lackadaisical.”73 While the former was certainly the case, Argyll arguably did not live up to his intellectual, political, and social potential, but his interests in India and education made him a natural and influential ally for George Chesney.74 Argyll’s later recollection of events hints at Chesney’s indirect approach to Argyll, as well as his view of his own authority: I did not then know Major Chesney at all and had no communication whatever with him. The first suggestion of a plan to found a new college at home, at the cost of the Indian revenue, for the special purpose of training civil engineers, came from my late friend Mr. Thornton, then at the head of the Public Works Department in the India Office.… After much consideration I adopted the suggestion\n\n30\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nwith full conviction of its great importance.… The idea was absolutely new. It needed a large immediate outlay, and a permanent annual cost not easily to be estimated, because it would be an experiment and might fail.75\n\nArgyll went on to say, “Accordingly I found some leading members [of council] strongly opposed to the plan, whilst all were most doubtful and reluctant.” In this he is not exaggerating. When he first circulated Chesney’s draft proposal for the new college for comments in March 1869, only five of the fifteen Council of India members were in support; two were neutral and eight were opposed.76 The reasons for the opposition closely followed the obstacles described above, according to the predilections of the individual members: use Royal Engineers, or other military personnel from Woolwich and Sandhurst; revive Addiscombe; or expand existing universities and colleges. So when Chesney returned to India in May 1869, prospects for a new college did not look good. Although few council members raised the issue of cost, Argyll was concerned about the state of Indian revenues and asked for a rough budget for the college to be prepared. It estimated an operating expense of £17,000 per annum, assuming one principal and a teaching staff of eighteen, and including accommodation for the students. Offset against this was a proposed annual tuition fee of 100 guineas each for 150 students, bringing the annual cost to the Indian revenue to £1,850, or £37 per specially trained engineer.77 The secretary of state was satisfied with this estimate and took the next step towards formal approval of the scheme. This was for the Council of India in London to approve a dispatch to the Government of India informing them that he had decided there would be a new college, that entry would be by competitive examination, and that students passing the program would be offered positions in the Indian PWD. In November 1869, by a vote of eight to three, the council approved the communication to India. Predictably, the Government of India was unhappy to be informed that the decision had already been made in London to change completely how they recruited civil engineers, and at their own expense. According to a much later account of the establishment of the college, Chesney was present at the meeting in Simla where the Government of India discussed how to respond to Argyll “and marshalled the arguments in favour of the scheme at some length, but, he feared, with little effect.” The account went on to quote from Chesney’s diary: “I expected criticism, or only cold support, but not the determined opposition I encountered. It is hardly likely that the India Office will persist in the teeth of the Government of India, especially as I hear that the Council was not unanimous.”78 When it responded in March 1870, the Government of India expressed its belief that by resolving the discrepancy between military and civilian salaries, as they had just done, India could recruit enough civil engineers through existing\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n31\n\nchannels. They also drew attention to the many assumptions and uncertainties in the India Office’s calculation that the college would be self-supporting. But ultimately they had little choice but to accept the decision already made in London, even though they had “great doubts that any real necessity exists for its immediate establishment.”79 The final step in the formal process for approving the new college was for the Council of India to reply to the communication from India. Argyll noted that he did not have “the full concurrence” of the Government of India but retained his “original opinion as to the expediency, and indeed, necessity, for establishing a college.”80 He rejected the claim that equal pay would resolve the situation and reiterated that the new college would pay for itself. The council met on 19 July 1870 for the final ratification of the proposal. The motion carried by six votes to five, a majority of just one at a meeting where four known dissenters were absent.81 With understatement, Argyll summed up the process: “It was only after much discussion both in Council and out of it, that I succeeded at last in securing the consent of that body.”82 The exchanges between London and India also included the proposal that George Chesney should be relieved of his duties in India and appointed as the founding president of the new college. Again, there was little option but to agree, and Chesney was duly appointed, with his start backdated to 24 April 1870. Questions in Parliament While this marks the official approval of the new civil engineering college, enabling Chesney to return to England to seek a suitable site for the college, Argyll was not yet out of the woods. “And when [the consent of the Council of India] had been secured a new danger arose. The House of Commons as a whole has the best disposition towards our Indian Empire, and very rarely interferes with its government. But when it does, the India Office is too often at the mercy of many personal or sectional interests at home.”83 The college would be funded from Indian revenues, and although Parliament might not have to approve the creation of the college itself, it did have oversight of the India Office finances. But even before Parliament had been officially informed of the India Office’s decision, news of the proposed college had leaked out from sources in India to the journal Engineering, which wrote accurately in May 1870 that the secretary of state’s view was “either that the system of education in this country is defective, or that a competitive examination is not the best means for testing the capabilities of an engineer.”84 The first mention in Parliament of the new scheme was on 5 August 1870 during a “Statement on Indian Finance” by the undersecretary of state for India, M.E. Grant Duff. When questioned about a passing comment concerning a\n\n32\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nnew college, he responded, “The creation of an engineering College, into which young men should be drafted by competitive examination, had become a matter of paramount necessity.”85 David Plunket, MP for the University of Dublin, questioned Grant Duff again on the matter a few days later86 but the House then rose for recess, allowing plenty of time for the “strong home interests” feared by Argyll to register their objections to the new college. Henry Fawcett, MP for Brighton, nicknamed “the Member for India” on account of his active engagement in Indian affairs, immediately signalled his intention to raise the matter in the House. Argyll, perhaps belatedly, canvassed the opinions of his government colleagues and found them, including Prime Minister Gladstone, to be lukewarm to the project. Over the next four months, “memorials” of protest were received from University College London (who also took their complaint to the prestigious journal, Nature),87 King’s College London, Owens College, and several other institutions.88 Chesney was dismayed that the institution of which he was already president was running into political difficulty but reacted with a detailed justification for the college that addressed numerous anticipated criticisms. He also responded thoroughly to objections raised by the Royal Engineers. Meanwhile Grant Duff replied to University College London that, having supplied only three engineers to India, it could hardly claim that the new college would cause them significant hardship (an argument apparently suggested by Chesney),89 and coolly dismissed their concerns: “The objections which you put forward had, indeed, already suggested themselves to [the secretary of state]; and a reconsideration of them in the form in which you now express them, has not altered the conclusions at which he had previously arrived.”90 It was clear that two issues were becoming paramount: the college’s proposed monopoly on supplying civil engineers to India, and the political necessity for the college to be self-supporting. Battle was rejoined on 24 February 1871 when Sir Francis Goldsmid (MP for Reading) raised several concerns. These were largely taken from the May 1870 Engineering article91 and focused on whether the new college was in opposition to the general trend towards competitive appointments. He also raised the matter of the PWD’s low rates of pay. Argyll had anticipated the need for a revised and more detailed projection of the college’s costs, so Grant Duff was ready with his answer when Sebastian Dickinson (MP for Stroud) raised the issue on 3 March: There will be no charge on the revenues of India on account of the Engineering College; the fees will be slightly in excess of the charges, including interest on the buildings and plant, say on £90,000. There will be 11 professors and instructors on salaries varying from £700 to £300 per annum. Of these, nine will be entitled to\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n33\n\npensions under the provisions of the Superannuation Act, and two will not be entitled to pensions. If my hon. Friend would like the figures here they are – Annual sanctioned charge for College, as per regulations of Secretary of State in Council, £18,350; interest on buildings, &c, say £90,000 at 4 per cent, £3,600; total, £21,950. Fees, 150 students at £150, £22,500; difference, £550.92\n\nThese numbers would prove to be wildly optimistic, and efforts to achieve the promised self-sustainability would plague the college throughout its history. Having received no satisfactory response to his point on 24 February, Goldsmid then rose to move a resolution that no “young men qualified by character and attainments for admission into the service of the Government of India as Civil Engineers” should be excluded because they had not attended the new college. Goldsmid’s main concern was that young men, however brilliant, would under the new scheme be prevented from joining the PWD if they were unable to pay the £150 per annum tuition. Grant Duff ’s response was that paying £150 for three years with a guaranteed job was a good return compared with the expensive and ineffective pupilage system of the past. Despite this logic, and after lengthy speeches (including support for Argyll from the chancellor of the exchequer) the resolution was narrowly adopted. Finally, on 18 May 1871, Goldsmid received a commitment from Grant Duff that students who passed the entrance examination but chose to study elsewhere would be appointed to the PWD, “provided they satisfy independent examiners that they come up in all respects to the standard of qualification which will be required from the College students at their final examination.”93 This was formalized in the college calendar, which specified that candidates who “preferred to pursue their studies elsewhere” needed to provide evidence of good moral conduct in the intervening three years, be in good health, and have spent at least eight months under a civil or mechanical engineer. In the first year, one candidate, Henry W.V. Colebrook, took advantage of this option. He qualified for admission in the 1871 entrance examination but chose not to take up his place. He sat and passed his final exam in 1874 and entered the PWD.94 Taking Shape Response to the New College Reactions in India to the establishment of the Indian Civil Engineering College followed lines similar to those in England. Additional concerns were raised about the readiness of engineers fresh from England for the challenges of Indian conditions, both climatic and technical.95 The Amrita Bazar Patrika newspaper caustically observed, “This college is to be established not here as might\n\n34\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nbe supposed but in England for the benefit of India. Indistinct rumours of such a proposal now and then reached the Indian tax-payers who are to provide the necessary funds.” It further noted that the college was open only to British-born subjects, and thus not to “Natives of the country from which the fund is to be derived.… Why was not the college established here or Roorkee improved? The Natives then might have served their own country.”96 This concern was echoed by engineer Frederick Tyrrell in his essay criticizing the PWD of the 1860s. Tyrrell observed that the new college would be placed in the hands of the same people (namely the Royal Engineers) who had been responsible for the present inefficiencies and corruption in the PWD. Tyrrell continued, “An Engineering College for India – if there must be a College, – should be in India. The best Engineers for India must be, and will be at some future time, the sons of our Indian fellow-subjects.… We have excellent stuff among the Natives for Engineers, – great intelligence; a singular aptitude for figures; the patient eye and hand for drawing; above all the faculty and habit of minute attention to details that elude our observation.”97 And of course it was Roorkee that felt the sting of the new college most deeply. Captain A.M. Lang, principal of Roorkee, was cautious in his 1871 annual report, merely noting that “the future effect of the out-turn of the Coopers Hill College in no way affects the supply from this College in the current year, whatever it may have on the fortunes of this College hereafter.”98 A year later, however, he was much more forceful: That the regular annual supply from [Coopers Hill] of a large number of assistant engineers, to whom appointments on more favourable terms are guaranteed, must affect the engineer class of this college there is no doubt whatever: in fact the ­English civil engineer class … has already been affected by the uncertain prospects held out to all beyond the small “guarantee” number. While Cooper’s Hill supplies a want (long felt in England) of a first class college, devoted exclusively to educating civil engineers, Roorkee must continue to perform a similar part in regard to the European, Anglo-Indian and native communities in this country.99\n\nLang’s frustration is understandable as he saw investment and opportunities diverted away from his college towards “fostering its later rival.” To add insult to injury, his public comments in the Thomason College calendar earned him a rebuke from the Government of India, which felt he should focus on reporting the internal affairs of the college “without committing the Principal of the College to views which may not meet with the approval of higher authorities.”100 Despite the efforts of Lang and his successors, little changed while Coopers Hill existed, and the debate about the relative qualities of the men from each college was recurrent.\n\n“This College Has Been Established at Cooper’s-Hill”\n\n35\n\nCoopers Hill Lang referred to “Coopers Hill” in the last quote. Since Chesney’s appointment as president in April 1870, and in the face of the ongoing political challenges, the secretary of state had taken the major step of buying the Coopers Hill estate. Indeed, the Engineer had reported this as early as 2 December 1870.101 In his 1960 A Short History of the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cameron related how Chesney supposedly learned about the Coopers Hill estate from the publican of the “Bells of Ouseley” while taking a boating trip on the Thames.102 Whether or not this was true, Chesney was unable to visit Coopers Hill until October 1870. Earlier that summer, he and the appointed architect, Sir Digby Wyatt, had reported on five possible locations.103 The list included Coopers Hill (see figure 2.2), but they had been unable to visit and were reluctant to make an official appointment through the India Office for fear of escalating the price. Chesney and Wyatt were authorized to open discussions on two of the other possibilities, the Oatlands Park Hotel in Weybridge, just south-east of Coopers Hill, and the Imperial Hotel, Malvern. However, both negotiations fell through – the price of Oatlands Park was nearly double what the India Office was willing to pay.104 In the meantime, however, Chesney was able to visit Coopers Hill and wrote a report on 6 October strongly recommending its purchase.105 He argued that Baron Grant, the current owner, was keen to sell quickly because he could not afford the upkeep and the price would therefore be good. And even if the college did not ultimately go ahead, it would be straightforward to resell the estate without financial loss. Chesney thought that it was “impossible to speak too highly of the general suitability of the place for the proposed purpose.”106 It was near London, had plenty of space for sports fields and practising surveying (and, later, forestry), and it was within easy reach of the Thames for rowing. At this point the river runs past the meadow of Runnymede, where King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215. To the south-west the gentle, wooded Coopers Hill rises from the meadow, with the college buildings just over the brow. It is a quintessentially beautiful English country scene, “one of the prettiest parts of the country.”107 Nearby is the village of Englefield Green with its Barley Mow pub, which would feature strongly in student life. Windsor Great Park is also close by, where students would walk at weekends, compete in military drill competitions, and learn horse riding. In Chesney’s opinion it was “difficult to overrate the difference there would be in the character given to the place by locality, between a College in such a spot or one set up in a dingy suburb of London.”108 Over the years, speechmakers at the college repeatedly succumbed to the temptation of quoting poetry about Coopers Hill. Usually, it was from Alexander Pope’s “Windsor Forest,” but John Denham’s “Coopers Hill,” first published in 1642, is also appropriate. The poet is standing on Coopers Hill, reflecting on\n\n36\n\nImperial Engineers\n\nFigure 2.2.
