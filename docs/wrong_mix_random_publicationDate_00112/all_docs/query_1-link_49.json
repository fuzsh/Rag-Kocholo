        "text": "Jeff Buckley - Arlene's Grocery - 1997\n\nJeff Buckley was born in California's Orange County in 1966.\n\nHe died in a tragic drowning accident on May 29th 1997.\n\nHe left one near perfect album, several live concerts recorded and released in full or part prior to, and/or after his death, and the material that may have lead eventually to a second 'proper' album.\n\nIf you are a fan this leaves a void, that can never be filled.\n\nSadly for an artist as talented as Jeff, the 'unofficial' recordings remain sadly few and far between. In away this is a good thing, as a badly recorded concert, would be such an injustice, to someone who was capable of such incredibly moving music, and never had the chance to expand definitively beyond his debut album.\n\nThe bootlegs that I have of Jeff Buckley are few in number. I know of around fifteen, that are supposed to be of good quality, the live radio material seem to be those most widely circulated.\n\nThis is my favorite. The copy I have was called 'The Grace Of J'.\n\nAt midnight on February 9, 1997, Jeff Buckley debuted his new drummer, Parker Kindred, in a show at Arlene Grocery on New York's Lower East Side. He also played a couple of solo gigs in New York during the first months of 1997: a gig at the Daydream Cafe (featuring band members Mick Grondahl and Michael Tighe as \"special guests\") and a solo performance February 4 as part of the Knitting Factory's 10-Year Birthday Party.\n\nSet List:\n\nNightmares by the Sea\n\nWitches' Rave\n\nSo Real\n\nHaven't You Heard\n\nLover, You Should've Come Over\n\nMorning Theft\n\nVancouver\n\nSnail\n\nThe Sky Is a Landfill\n\nMojo Pin\n\nGrace\n\nLast Goodbye\n\nFind out more about Arlene's GroceryHERE.\n\nAudio quality: Suggests the soundboard was used, even if audience 'chatter' is apparent on a couple of occasions. The conversation between Jeff Buckley and the audience is in really good humour, his impersonation of Tom Waits is priceless.\n\nReloaded 21/June/2015 link in comments."
