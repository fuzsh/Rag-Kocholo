        "text": "Creedence Clearwater Revival - Woodstock Festival 1969\n\nThis is Creedence Clearwater Revival, live at Woodstock.\n\nJohn Fogerty felt the band's performance was below standard on the night, this was after all CCR at their peak of success both live and commercially.\n\nAs a result their concert did not appear on the Woodstock soundtrack or film, (several CCR tracks from the event were included in the 1990s commemorative box set.)\n\nThe band also complained that they had to take the stage at three in the morning because The Grateful Dead had jammed far past their scheduled set time, (and many of the audience had gone to sleep - no change there then - sorry Dead-Heads).\n\nAll of that said and having listened to this boot of the show, I have to say I think they were harsh on themselves, this is full on CCR, at a true moment in musical history.\n\nThis then is Creedence Clearwater Revival on August 16th 1969, live at Woodstock.\n\nSet List:\n\n01 Born on the Bayou\n\n02 Green River\n\n03 Ninity Nine and a Half\n\n04 Bootleg\n\n05 Commotion\n\n06 Bad Moon Rising\n\n07 Proud Mary\n\n08 I Put a Spell on You\n\n09 The Night Time is the Right Time\n\n10 Keep on Chooglin'\n\n11 Suzie Q\n\nThis is very good quality from the remastered stereo soundboard recordings.\n\nThere is a small amount of CCR material in the Beehive Candy Store.\n\nReloaded - 20/May/2015 - download link in comments."
