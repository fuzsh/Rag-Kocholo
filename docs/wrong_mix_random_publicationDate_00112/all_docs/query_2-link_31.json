        "text": "Researcher, Département des études, de la prospective et des statistiques (Ministère de la culture, France), associate fellow at gemass Abstract Youth and Globalization is an academic forum for discussion and exchanges, a space for intellectual creativity on all questions relating to youth in a globalizing world. Its aim is to provide an innovative understanding of youth studies in a global context based on multiscalar, multilevel, multisite, and multidisciplinary approaches. Young people both are affected by and are the actors of the globalization of everyday life. Drawing on both theoretical and empirical research, the journal explores how young people relate to globality and its outcomes. To open this discussion, the Journal starts with an issue devoted to understanding the global generation through the lenses of the cosmopolitan approach. It discusses four major criticisms and provides a counter position to. In the first case, cosmopol-itanism is too often considered as a natural consequence of globalization, while in the second as being too ethnocentric. In the third case, cosmopolitanism has been assimilated to the ideology of contemporary global capitalism and in the fourth case it is mocked as a mere utopia. The papers gathered here investigate values, norms, behaviors and practices related to esthetic, cultural, ethic and political cosmopolitanisms.\n\nThis paper seeks to address a specific aspect of the condition of youth today which results from the link between the impact of neoliberal policies and the critical reaction of young people to them. Starting from an awareness that the life experiences of young people in contemporary societies have changed significantly, we will attempt to analyze some aspects of this great transformation. The most influential changes that impact on the everyday life of young people are the transition from education to work, which forges their life experience. The paper focuses on a specific analytical approach which highlights a \" structural ecology of youth \" which is determined by the intertwining of macro (structural), meso and micro policies, that is the relationship between economics and politics, State and Market, public services and a private quasi-market, all of which define the framework of opportunities available to young people that can influence their lives and transition to adulthood. These conditions also affect both the constraints and opportunities for youth participation in politics. Neoliberal policies on the one hand, the mobilization protest and response on the other define the analytical structure of the paper. Some observations on the last global wave of social movements protest as a reaction to the global economic crisis in 2008-2011 are developed here, highlighting the involvement of youth in this mobilization and describing the main features of youth political participation.\n\nGLOBALIZATION has no easy definition. The term has been used variously and has come to mean various things to various people. Consequently, what it means in politics may differ from what it means in economics, and what it means in literature may differ from what it means in culture. Simply described, globalization is the easing of interconnectivity between communities, cultures, countries, currencies, commodities, concepts, cuisines, and civilizations. However, the process of easing is not so easy as well; because, the easing also gives rise to more walls raised by those who are afraid of losing individual identity and value under the crashing waves of globalization. Therefore, while there is internet and information explosion on one side, there is also cyber terrorism and terrorist explosions on the other side; and while there is the rise of liberalism on one side, there is also the strengthening of fundamentalism on the other. But, what kind of impact has all this on the youth?\n\nThis special issue focuses on education as a crucial factor mediating the relationship between youth and globalization. Specifically, four papers collectively explore how education can be re-envisioned from the following vantage point: the use of technology to foreground the fundamentally interconnected nature of today’s world; the help of mindfulness to deepen the awareness of such interconnectedness and cultivate a commitment to collective well-being; the role of activism to produce more critical knowledge and transformational solidarity for social justice on a global scale; at the same time, the necessity of reflexivity to examine one’s own ontological and epistemological assumptions before attempting any educational intervention. I argue that this vantage point helps re-envision the existing institutions and practices of education to encourage young people in a globalizing world to learn to live a happy life together by embracing their pluriversal coexistence.\n\nDrawing on both theoretical and empirical research, this double special issue intends to provide innovative insights into childhood and youth studies through the lenses of global risks, considering multilevel, multisite, and multidisciplinary approaches. Regarding the methodological approaches, scholars and advanced researchers are invited to make proposals that use qualitative and quantitative methods, combinations of both, or innovative and creative techniques that can shed light on how children and young people cope with different risks globalized today and/or in the future. Youth and Globalization publish peer-reviewed articles (8,000- 9,000 words), book reviews (up to 1,200 words), and interviews/conversations (not to exceed 2,500 words).
