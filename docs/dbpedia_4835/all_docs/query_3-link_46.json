We shall not forget you, For you always bring us The sweet joys of living And the spirit of play. Around the blazing campfire, The smoke gently twisting, A spell cast around us Of friendship and love. CHORUS We always follow with 1-9-9-6 at Chateaugay. Back To the Top\n\n1-9-9-6 at Chateaugay\n\n1-9-9-6 at Chateaugay, No other year the same.

Back To the Top\n\nI Love Camp Chateaugay\n\nTune: Jimmy Crack Corn To Chateaugay I happily go To live among the mosquito And drink my bug juice every day. Oh, how I love Camp Chateaugay! CHORUS: When I grow up I'll send my kid To spend the summer like I did. What else is there for me to say Except I love Camp Chateaugay!!! I swim the waters near the beach And count each every lovely leech. They slowly suck my blood away, But still I love Camp Chateaugay. CHORUS All this nature before my eyes, A thousand trees, a million flies. A summer here is sure a must, Especially if you like dust! CHORUS Back To the Top\n\nChewing Gum\n\nCHORUS: Oo, la, la, la, la chewing gum, Oo, la, la, chewing gum Oo, la, la, la, la chewing gum, Oo, la, la, chewing gum My mother gave me a dollar To buy a collar. I did not buy a collar. I bought some chewing gum. CHORUS My mother gave me a quarter To tip the porter. I did not tip the porter. I bought some chewing gum.

CHORUS My mother gave me a penny To buy some chewing gum. I did not buy some chewing gum. I'M SICK OF CHEWING GUM! Back To the Top\n\nChicken Lips and Lizard Hips\n\nWhen I was a little kid, I never liked to eat. Mom would put things on my plate, And I'd dump them on her feet. But then one day she made this soup. I ate it all in bed. I asked her what she put in it, And this is what she said: CHORUS: \"Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips and alligator eyes, Monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salamander thighs, Rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toenail pies, Stir 'em all together and it's Mama's Soup Surprise.\" I went into the bathroom And stood beside the sink. Said, \"I'm feeling slightly ill And I think I'd like a drink.\" Mama said, \"I've just the thing, I'll get it in a wink. It's full of lots of protein And vitamins, I think.\" CHORUS Back To the Top\n\nThe Circle Game\n\nYesterday, a child came out to wonder, Caught a dragonfly inside a jar. Fearful when the sky was full of thunder And tearful at the falling of a star. CHORUS: And the seasons they go round and round. And the painted ponies go up and down. We're captive on the carousel of time. We can't return we can only look, Behind from where we came, And go round and round and round in the circle game. Then the child moved ten times round the seasons. Skated over ten clear frozen streams. Words like \"when you're older\" must appease him, And promises of someday make his dreams. CHORUS Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now. Cartwheels turn to carwheels through the town. And they tell him, \"Take your time, it won't be long now, 'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down.\" CHORUS So the years spin by, and now the boy is twenty. Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true. There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty, Before the last revolving year is through. CHORUS Back To the Top\n\nComin' around the Mountain\n\nShe'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes. (2X) She'll be comin' around the mountain.

High above him there's a swallow, Winging swiftly through the sky. CHORUS: How the winds are laughing. They laugh with all their might. Laugh and laugh the whole day through, And half the summer's night. Dona, Dona, etc. Stop complaining said the farmer, Who told you a calf to be. Why don't you have wings to fly with, Like the swallow so proud and free. CHORUS Calves are easily bound and slaughtered. Never knowing the reason why.

We hammered and we nailed 'til the sun went down. CHORUS What did we do when we needed corn? We plowed and we sewed 'til the early morn. We plowed and we sewed 'til the early morn.

Had chicken pie, country ham, And homemade butter on the bread, But the best darn thing 'bout Grandma's house, Was the great big feather bed. CHORUS: It was nine feet high, six feet wide, soft as a downy chick. It was made from the feathers of forty-leven geese, And a whole bolt of cloth from the tick. It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs, And the piggy that we stole from the shed (NAMED MITCH!). But the best darn thing 'bout Grandma's house, Was the great big feather bed. After supper we'd sit around the fire, The old folks would spit and chew. Pa would talk about the farm and wars Granny'd sing a ballad or two. I'd sit and listen and watch the fire, 'Til the cobwebs filled my head. Next thing I know I'd wake up in the morning In the middle of the old feather bed. CHORUS Loved my ma, loved my pa, Loved granny and grandpa too. Went fishing with my uncle, Wrestling with my cousin, I even kissed aunt Lou, eww! If I ever had the choice, I guess it ought to be said, I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road, For that great big feather bed. Well I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road....
