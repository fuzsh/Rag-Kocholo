        "text": "This index sets out to give a brief resumé in alphabetical order, of some of the more interesting animals to have graced the turf in the 20th and 21st century. Starting with Affirmed and finishing with Zarathustra I hope that followers of the great sport of Horseracing will find the blog interesting and informative.\n\nAffirmed: Foaled in February 1975, Affirmed became the 11th winner of The United States Triple Crown (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes). He won 14 Grade1 Stakes over his stellar career, topping the champion table in all three seasons he raced. He was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37 year period which was ended by American Pharaoh in 2015. Named horse of the year in 1978 following his Triple Crown triumph, and again the following year, it was an accolade well deserved, as it was gained competing against an animal described as “the best horse in the history of thoroughbred racing never to have won The Championship”, Alydar.\n\nAs 2yo’s, Affirmed and Alydar met 6 times with the score 4-2 in the formers favour, but despite that, come the first leg of the Triple Crown, The Kentucky Derby, Alydar was sent off the 6/5 favourite. However, as so often is the case, the market got it wrong and supporters of the “Jolly” needed their mint Julips after the race, as Affirmed beat him fair and square by a decisive 1 1/2L. It was a lot closer between them in the 2nd leg, The Preakness, with Affirmed prevailing by a neck which set things up for a dramatic final leg in the Belmont Stakes. In a race described as one of the greatest of all time, the duo took each other on from over 6 furlongs out, and battled head to head all the way to the line, with Affirmed just holding a late Alydar surge.\n\nHe was by The Arlington Classic winner, Exclusive Native, who also sired the filly Genuine Risk, one of only 3 of her sex to have ever won The Kentucky Derby, and he was ridden by a teenage Steve Cauthen, who readers of a certain vintage will remember subsequently winning 3 British Champion Jockey titles when riding as first jockey for Henry Cecil and incidentally, also landed a British Triple Crown on that fabulous filly, Oh So Sharp\n\nAkiyda: A British bred filly foaled in April 1979, she was by Labus, a son of that tough customer, Busted. Trained in France by the top handler Francois Mathet, (trained some of the best French horses of the 20th century including Tantieme, Reliance, and the 2 Epsom Derby winners, Phil Drake 1955 and Relko 1963) she raced only once as a 2yo, winning a Saint-Cloud maiden in November 1981 by 5 lengths. Campaigned at the highest level as a 3yo she finished 2nd in both the Prix de Diane and Prix Vermeille before earning her place in the history books with victory in The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe. Racing prominently in 4th place on the rails throughout, she showed impressive acceleration at the 2 furlong marker going a couple of lengths clear but top French pilot, Yvette Saint-Martin must have felt that he had gone for home a little prematurely when the one sight no jockey wanted to see in his wing mirrors, Lester Pigott on Ardross, hove into view. Under a typical Pigott drive Ardross made relentless progress, but the filly found more and held on. Akiyda never raced again and was retired to stud where she only produced one foal who lived to adulthood, a filly named Arishka. Arishka never won a race but as a brood mare produced the colt Akbar who won the Group2 Henry11 Stakes in 2002.\n\nAldaniti: Trained at Findon in West Sussex by the ex champion jockey, Josh Gifford, (won the title 4 times) his victory in the 1981 Grand National at the age of 11, returning from what seemed a career ending leg injury sustained at Sandown 18 months previously, and ridden by Bob Champion recovering from cancer, was certainly the stuff of legends. Carrying 10-13 he started the 10/1 2nd favourite behind Spartan Missile, ridden by the redoubtable 54 years old Warwickshire farmer/amateur rider John Thorne, who had won the 2 previous runnings of The Fox hunters Chase over the National Fences. Aldaniti and Champion took it up at the 11th fence and maintained their advantage for the rest of the race, fighting off a late challenge from Spartan Missile on the long run in to win by 4 lengths. Needless to say there wasn’t a dry eye on the racecourse and the victory gave a huge boost to cancer charities. Great credit should be given to the sporting grandfather aboard the runner up who was conceding 6 lbs, including 3lbs overweight. The following years race was something of an anticlimax however, as Aldaniti and Champion ended up on the floor after the first fence; such is horseracing!\n\nAl Boum Photo: This years winner of The Cheltenham Gold Cup is the 9th animal to win the race more than once, and still only an 8yo and relatively lightly raced, must have a serious shot at joining that elite band who have won it 3 times or more, Golden Millar(5) Cottage Rake(3) Arkle(3) and Best Mate(3). French bred, by Bucks Boum, a son of the excellent NH stallion Cadoudal, out of a mare by the high class French hurdler, Dom Alco, the Willie Mullins trained gelding is certainly bred to be a top class staying chaser, and so it has proved.\n\nHe made an inauspicious start to his career, coming to grief at the 3rd last in a French 3yo hurdle and didn’t race again in France. He joined the Co Carlow yard of Willie Mullins in October 2016 and won 2 of his 4 starts over hurdles. He made a successful debut over fences in a Navan 2m1f beginners chase in Nov2017 but fell next time out, and again, when sent off an 8/1 shot for the 2018 RSA Chase at the Cheltenham festival. He got his career back on track with a Grade1 victory at Fairyhouse 18 days later but then was the victim of a dreadful riding error by jockey, Paul Townend. He looked to have the race at his mercy in Punchestowns Champion Novices Chase when his rider took the inexplicable decision to try and bypass the last fence and crashed into the wings. Al Boum Photo wasn’t seen again until making a successful seasonal debut at Tramore on New Years Day 2019 and 74 days later lined up for The Gold Cup as the third choice (12/1) of Willie’s 4 runners. However nobody told him that and in the lead turning in, he stayed on strongly to win by a comfortable 2 1/2L. He had to work a little harder this year where he again led after the last but was all out to hold the late challenge of the Nicky Henderson trained Santini. Whatever the future holds for Al Boum Photo he has already proved himself an outstanding chaser, and I’m sure Willie Mullins, who must have despaired of ever landing National Hunts greatest prize, will be forever grateful to him for bringing it home to Carlow not once but twice to date.\n\nAlderbrook: Not many entire horses have won The Champion Hurdle but one that did was a son of that great stayer Ardross, Alderbrook. Trained in the early part of his career by Sally Hall he didn’t see a racecourse until he was three, and it was only on his 5th attempt that he managed to get his head in front, a modest Class6 handicap, which he won off a lowly mark of 58. Transferred to Julie Cecil things took a decided turn for the better, winning his first 5 races for the Newmarket handler. Progress was maintained and he rounded off his Newmarket sojourn with a fine win in the Group2 Prix Dollar at Longchamp in October 1994 after which the 5yo was transferred to the Grand National winning trainer, Kim Bailey with a hurdling career in mind. Having only his 2nd start over timber, (had run unsuccessfully in a 3yo hurdle for Sally Hall) he won Wincantons Champion Hurdle trial, The Kingwell Hurdle on his debut for his new yard. Heavily backed at odds of 50/1 for the Champion Hurdle on the morning of The Kingwell, he proceeded to demolish a top class field, and 19 days later started an 11/2 chance for The Champion Hurdle itself. Held up, he travelled sweetly for jockey Norman Williamson, and when asked after the last, quickened impressively leaving the 2 joint favourites, Large Action and Danoli, toiling in his wake. After Cheltenham he finished runner up on the flat in a French Group1 and a German Group 2 before retiring for the season. Always difficult to keep sound he only raced 3 more times winning his Champion Hurdle prep race at Kempton in February 1996, finishing 2nd in the big race itself 16 days later, and rounding off a great career with a win in The Scottish Champion Hurdle the following month. He lost by 2 1/2L in The Champion Hurdle and many feel that jockey, Richard Dunwoody overdid the waiting tactics and gave Alderbrook too much to do, an allegation strongly rejected by one of the best riders the sport has ever produced. Alderbrook was retired to stud and had some success, siring plenty of good NH performers such as Ollie Magern and Baron Windrush.\n\nAll Along: Foaled in 1979 She was undoubtedly one of the greatest fillies of the second half of the 20th century. French bred, by Targowice, a son of the great American Horse, Round Table, her breeder Daniel Wildenstein, was himself a fascinating character, and it’s worth digressing a little for a quick cameo of one of the most successful, but rather acerbic and irascible, owner/breeders in the history of the turf. A scion of the famous art dealing family, The Wildensteins a business started by his grandfather in the 19th century, he took over the running of Wildenstein &Co’s Paris and NewYork branches in 1959 and those in London and Buenos Aires in 1963. He was a terrifically successful businessman, and Art critic, so much so that a profile of the family in the magazine, Vanity Fair in 1998 estimated his fortune at more than $5 billion, but when it came to racing he could be a very difficult character indeed. Following what many considered the unjustified criticism of Pat Eddery for his ride on Buckskin in the 1978 Ascot Gold, trainer Peter Welwyn told him to remove his horses\n\nFrom Seven Barrows, (Now Nicky Henderson’s base). Henry Cecil took over the Wildenstein horses and enjoyed plenty of success but that relationship also broke down following the art dealers criticism of Henry’s jockey, Lester Pigott. Lester responded in typical Pigott fashion by describing the Wildensteins as “inveterate bad losers”.\n\nAll Along was trained by Maurice Zilber as a 2yo and won her only start but was then moved to Patrick-Louis Biancone for the remainder of her career. She won some notable races at three including the Group1, Prix Vermeille, but it was in the second half of her 4yo career in 1983 that she demonstrated what an exceptional filly she was. Following defeats in the Grand Prix de Chantilly and The Grand Prix de Paris she was given a summer break and on her return put in a highly promising effort in the Arc trial, The Prix Foy. Held up she came with a strong late run to get within a length of Henry Candy’s super filly Time Charter, form she reversed 3 weeks later in the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe itself. Given a great ride by “The Choirboy” Walter Swinburn, she came with a great run up the rails to collar Dick Hern’s Sun Princess a hundred yards out and was a length clear at the post. She immediately headed for Toronto where she won\n\nThe Rothmans International at Woodbine and only 2 weeks later won The Turf Classic at Aquaduct in New York. From there she headed for Laurel Park where she landed\n\nThe Washington International. She was the first animal to win these 3 prestigious North American/Canadian races in a row and in the process landed a $1Million bonus for connections. It was an amazing feat for the filly to win consecutively 4 of the Worlds top horse races, but to have done it within a 41 day time frame was truly staggering.\n\nAlleged: Foaled in the US in May 1974 he was by the American stallion,\n\nHoist The Flag. He was bought as an unraced 2yo by Robert Sangster and associates and brought to Ballydoyle to be trained by the legendary Vincent O’Brien. He only ran once at two, winning a back end Curragh Maiden by 8L. He made a flying start to his 3yo campaign with a win in The Ballydoyle Stakes at The Curragh, and then surprised most people when starting at odds of 33/1 he beat his 2 stable companions,\n\nValinsky the favourite, and Meneval, the previous years Irish St Leger winner, in The Royal Whip Stakes. His unbeaten run continued with success in The Galinule Stakes at The Curragh, and The Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. His unbeaten run came to an end in his next race, The St Leger, and many good judges blamed the man on top, Lester Pigott. Dick Hern the Queens trainer was intent on giving her stoutly bred filly Dunfermline, every chance, and ran 2 pacemakers. Instead of ignoring them and conserving Alleged’s finishing speed, Lester took the 2 pacemakers on from the start leaving his mount with little left at the finish, and he could only finish second to the Royal filly. However back over a mile and a half in The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe next time out it was a different story with Alleged winning readily from Balmerino with Dunfermline back in 4th.\n\nAlleged only raced three times at four, winning all three races, and he became only the 3rd Postwar dual winner of Longchamps Blue Riband, (Tantieme 1950, 1951 and Ribot 1955, 1956). Indeed it was another 35 years before we saw another animal land the great race twice, the filly Treve in 2013, and 2014. Syndicated for $16 Million, Alleged has left his mark on the breed, siring such talented animals as Miss Alleged, Midway Lady, Shantou, Legal Case, Law Society, Leading Counsel, and Strategic Choice to name but a few.\n\nAlverton: A top class chaser who was trained in North Yorkshire by probably one of the best dual purpose trainers the country has ever produced, Peter Easterby. He is the only handler to have trained more than a thousand winners in both codes of racing, and his Cheltenham record alone which includes 2 Gold Cup winners, Alverton (1979) and Little Owl (1981), 5 Victories in The Champion Hurdle, Saucy Kit (1)\n\nNight Nurse (2) and Sea Pigeon (2) a Stayers Hurdle and 3 Arkle’s is one equalled only by N. Henderson and W. Mullins. Peter purchased Alverton’s dam for £700 from a local breeder and had her covered by the Cambridgeshire winner, Midsummer Night 11. It was a shrewd business move and an even shrewder piece of breeding as her son went on to run 22 times, (11 on the flat and 11 over jumps) winning 12 times. Mind you it took all Easterby’s skill to keep the gelding sound as he broke down badly at four and it was a great credit to Peter that he won Cheltenham’s Arkle Chase 2 years later. The following years Gold Cup started in a blizzard and Tommy Carberry aboard Tied Cottage set a furious pace in the dreadful conditions racing well clear of the pursuing field. Coming to the last fence he was still 2 lengths clear of the closing Alverton with pilot Jonjo O’Neill looking to have plenty left in the locker. However Carberry’s mount put in a tired looking jump and fell leaving Alverton to stroll home by 25L. Tommy insisted afterwards that if Tied Cottage had jumped the last he would have won, but needless to say Jonjo would have none of it. Tied Cottage was indeed a very unlucky animal as he won the following years contest by a distance from Master Smudge but was subsequently disqualified for failing a blood test, skewed apparently for having been fed a Mars Bar. 16 days after his Cheltenham victory, Alverton lined up as favourite for The Grand National and was probably going better than anything else coming to Beecher’s Brook on the 2nd circuit when inexplicably he failed to take off and fell heavily breaking his neck. Jonjo felt that the horse was full of running and the most likely explanation was that Alverton had suffered a heart attack. It was a sad end for such a brave and talented young horse and who knows what he might have achieved in the future had connections decided to sidestep that years Grand National only 16 days after his gruelling race in the mud at Cheltenham.\n\nAmbush II: In 1897 The Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, bought an unraced Irish bred 3yo for 500 Gns from the tenant of Eyrefield Lodge, on The Curragh, G.W. Lushington. It was a fortuitous purchase as the colt went on to win The Grand National 3 years later. Trained for his entire career at Eyrefield, his racecourse debut when four in 1898 was a rather inauspicious one, falling at Navan, ridden by\n\nAlgy Anthony. However compensation awaited the duo 29 days later when they won The Maiden Plate at Punchestown despite a refusal at the course’s famous double bank. He rounded off the year with a win in The St Stephens Day Plate at Leopardstown on December 26th. His best performance the following year was a 7th in the 1899 Grand National again with the intrepid Algernon in the plate. He made a very promising start to the new century winning a NH flat race on St Patrick’s day at the now defunct Baldoyle Racecourse near Dublin, with his previous owner G.W. lushington riding, and then lined up for the 1900 Grand National with plenty of confidence behind him, starting joint second choice in the market with Manifesto who had won the great race in 1897 and 1899. On the second circuit the favourite, another Irish horse, Hidden Mystery, had just taken over the lead when he was brought down by a loose horse, (ironically Ambush 11’s stable companion Covert Hack who had fallen at the first fence) leaving the rest of the contest to be fought out by Manifesto and Ambush 11. It was an epic struggle up Aintree’s long run in but in the end Manifesto’s welter burden of 12-13 proved too much and Algy Anthony drew clear. George Williamson then eased the gallant Manifesto and was just pipped for second place. Described by many as one of the most exciting Grand Nationals ever, Algy Anthony would certainly have had fond memories of the race as The Prince gave him a\n\n“Present” of £500, a serious sum of money in those days. Manifesto must surely rank as one of the greatest “Aintree horses” ever as he was 3rd again in 1902 carrying 12-8, (ridden by Lester Pigott’s grandad, Ernie Pigott) and 3rd yet again at the age of 15 with 12-3 and ridden by Ernie in 1903. Ambush 11 came to the last looking like the winner in that 1903 race, with Algy up, but there was no happy ending this time as he fell and never won again. He died 2 years later in 1905 still only 8, and his head was removed for a post mortem. Also, Lushingham had his hooves removed, thinking Edward, now King, would like them mounted, (a rather macabre practice) as souvenirs of his Grand National victory. However a quick reassembly job was required when the royal command to forward the entire skeleton for display in a museum, was received.\n\nAnglo: Foaled in 1958, he was Irish bred, by Greek Star out of Miss Alligator and had many owners. He was sold as a foal to Mr Padge Berry in November 1958 for 170 Gns and sold on the following August to a Mr Quilty for 310 Gns. 2 months after that he was acquired for 460Gns at The Newmarket Houghton Sales by Mr J.E Oxley and he raced as a 2yo named, Flag of Convenience, on the flat in the colours of General Fielden. His efforts were marked by such a conspicuous lack of success that he was sold for 110Gns to a farmer named Mr J. Nichols at Botteril’s Sales in Leicestershire who kept him on his farm for 18 months. He next appeared on a racecourse, in The Ramsey Hurdle race at Huntingdon in June 1962 where he caught the attention of Captain Ryan Price, who bought him on behalf of a partner in The Anglo Amalgated Film Studio, Mr Stuart Levy for £2,500. Perhaps seeing an opportunity to promote the company Stuart changed the 4yo’s name to Anglo, and he did well for his new connections. When Price was disqualified from training over his handling of the Hurdler, Rosyth, in 1964, Anglo moved to Fred Winters Lambourn yard. He continued to do well for Fred, (won 11 races over hurdles and fences in his career) in the 1964-1965 season, but the following year was disappointing, his only win coming in a modest Windsor Chase. Fred had won the 1965 Grand National with the American owned, and ridden, Jay Trump, but there was little confidence that Anglo, with his poor form to date in 1966, could emulate his heroic stable mate in what was the120th renewal of the great race, and he started at odds of 50/1. However, the horse didn’t know he was a 50/1 shot, and in a field of 47, ridden by Tim Norman, Anglo came home 20L clear, of the great hope of Scotland, Freddie, who had been sent off the 11/4 fav. He won for his lucky owner, record prize money of £22,334 and 5 shillings. The following year, having changed hands yet again, he was involved in the debacle at the 23rd fence which saw Foinavon romp home at odds of 100/1 and that really was his Swan-song. Interestingly, the 1968 Grand National was won by his half-brother, Red Alligator, with Red Rum’s future partner, Brian Fletcher in the plate.\n\nArdross Foaled in May 1976, and bred by the great Irish trainer, Paddy “Darkie” Prendergast, he was by Run The Gantlet out of a daughter of Levmoss, that exceptional animal who not only won the top staying races in France and Britain but also had the speed to win The Prix de I’Arc de Triomphe in 1969. Bred on such stout staying lines, Ardross was always going to need a trip, and so it proved, becoming one of the top staying racehorses of the last 40 years. Trained by “Darkie, he didn’t see a racecourse until he was three, running unplaced on his debut, but causing one of the shocks of the 1979 season when hosing up at odds of 50/1 in the Group2 Gallinule Stakes next time out. He only ran once more that season, finishing unplaced in The King Edward V11 Stakes at Royal Ascot. Sadly Paddy died in June 1980 and his son Kevin took over the training of Ardross. Finishing unplaced over 10 furlongs on his seasonal debut in 1980, Kevin stepped him up to 2 miles for Leopardstown’s Saval Beg Stakes, where he was a revelation, trotting up by 6L, establishing him as a potential top stayer. Starting at 6/1 for the Ascot Gold Cup the following month he gave the outstanding stayer, Le Moss, plenty to think about, pushing Henry Cecil’s Champion all the way to the line, and only going down by 3/4L. He had to give best to Le Moss again in both The Goodwood and Doncaster Cups, albeit reducing the losing margin on both occasions to just a neck. However he finished off the 1980 campaign on a positive note. Partnered by L. Pigott for the first time, he won Newmarket’s Jockey Club Cup, and then finished 3rd in Longchamp’s Prix Royal Oak.\n\nPurchased by that great racing enthusiast, Charles St George, he moved to the Newmarket yard of Henry Cecil for the 1981 campaign, and started the season in great style, winning The Yorkshire Cup, The Ascot Gold Cup, and The Goodwood Cup, in succession, before reverting to 13 furlongs for Newbury’s Geoffrey Freer Stakes in August. In a contest that featured the future St Leger winner, Cut Above, who went on to win that years final Classic from the legendary Shergar, Ardross showed plenty of pace, winning easily from Castle Keep with the future St Leger winner back in 3rd. From the worst possible draw, 24/24, he went on from Newbury to finish 5th to Gold River in The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe, but 3 weeks later, reversed that form in the Prix Royal Oak, winning by 4L from Proustille with Gold River, 2 1/2L back in 3rd.\n\nArdross got his 1982 campaign off to a great start, winning The Jockey Club Stakes from Glint of Gold, and followed up with a comfortable win in Sandown’s Henry 11 Stakes, before easily landing a second Ascot Gold Cup. Further success followed with another win in The Geoffrey Freer at Newbury, followed by a second Doncaster Cup. Now six, he rounded of a great career, under a great ride by Lester, running the super filly Akiyda close in his final race, The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe.\n\nSyndicated as a stallion for £2 Million, he failed to make much impression on the flat, but proved a significant NH influence, siring amongst many other stalwarts of the winter game, the Champion Hurdler, Alderbrook, and the winner of The Stayers Hurdle, Anzum.\n\nArkle: Those who braved the miserable wintry conditions to attend Navan’s National Hunt meeting on the 20th of January 1962, didn’t know it when they arrived at the Co Meath track, but that come the running of the 27 runner Bective Novice Hurdle on the card, they were going to see a slice of racing history unfold. The talented mare Kerforo, who was to win The Irish Grand National only 3 months later for her trainer Tom Dreaper, was sent off the even money favourite, and looked like justifying the odds between the last 2 obstacles, when an unconsidered outsider, (20/1) also trained by Tom, cruised past to win the modest 1st prize of £133, as he liked. The winner, a 5yo gelding by Archive, out of the mare Bright Cherry, who went on to leave an indelible mark on National Hunt racing, was the mighty Arkle, and it was the first of the legend’s 27 victories.\n\nFoaled on 19th April 1957 at Ballymacoll stud in Co Kildare, then owned by Miss Dorothy Paget, (the 5 times Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Golden Millar,1932-36 raced in her colours) and 3 years later, in August 1960, was submitted for sale at Ballsbridge by his breeder, Mrs Mary Baker. Purchased for 1150Gns by Anne Duchess of Westminster, he spent the following year at the Duchess’s, Eaton Lodge estate in Cheshire, before returning to Ireland, to be trained by Tom Dreaper at his Kilsallaghan, North Co Dublin yard, Greenogue.\n\nTom, a firm believer in giving young animals plenty of time to develop, and a quiet introduction to racing, won’t have been the slightest bit concerned, when his future champion ran 4th on his racecourse debut in a Mullingar “Bumper” on Dec 9th 1961, and 3rd in a similar contest at Leopardstown 17 days later. Ridden on both occasions by the amateur, Mark Hely-Hutchinson, who amusingly remarked, “that he is the only rider of Arkle never to have won on the great horse”\n\nArkle’s Cheltenham career got off to a flying start with victory in the 1963 Broadway Chase, (now The Arkle Chase in his honour) and the following year he won The Gold Cup itself, beating the previous years winner, Mill House, by a length. The 1965 Gold Cup saw him extend that advantage over Millhouse to 20 lengths, and in the 1966 renewal, despite a serious blunder early in the contest, strolled home by 30 lengths at odds of 1/10. Besides winning 3 consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups he put in some eye watering, weight carrying, performances, including winning 2 Hennessy Gold Cups carrying 12-7 both times, and The Irish Grand National under 12-0 in 1964. Another outstanding performance was his concession of 16lbs to Mill House in the 1965 Gallagher Gold Cup, winning in a time 17 seconds faster than the course record. One of his greatest efforts was in defeat. In the 1966 Hennessy Gold Cup, he failed by just 1/2 a length, to concede 35lbs to the talented Stalbridge Colonist, who went on to lfinish a close 2nd in the Cheltenham Gold Cup 4 months later.\n\nIn the 1966 King George V1 Chase, Arkle struck the guard rail with his hoof jumping the open ditch, and fractured a pedal bone. Despite the injury, he kept going to finish runner up, but it was to be the great horses’ swan song at the age of just nine, and he never raced again.\n\nA winner of 27 of his 35 starts at distances from 1m6f to 3m5f, his Timeform rating of 212 is the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser, with only his stablemate Flying bolt on 210, coming close. Next on their ratings are Sprinter Sacre on 192, followed by Kauto Star and Mill House on 191. His owner the duchess, continued to ride him as a hack, but his retirement was sadly curtailed when he contracted a crippling bone disease and had to be put down at the young age of 13. The concensus is that we are most unlikely to ever see his like again, but the skeleton of the great horse has been preserved, and can be seen at the Irish National Stud at Tully in Co Kildare.\n\nAyala: We get to the end of the A’s with a horse sired by the 1950 Ascot Gold Cup winner, Supertello, whose exploits on the turf, with one outstanding exception, are largely forgettable, but is pretty interesting nonetheless for the characters who were part of his story.\n\nFoaled in 1954 at the Dalham Hall stud in Newmarket, (purchased by Sheikh Mahommed in 1981) he fetched a mere 400Gns at the same years Newmarket December sales. Useless on the Flat, he changed hands for 40Gns and when resubmitted to the sales as a 3yo was bought by, Mr John Chapman, a patron of trainer, Keith Pigott, father of Lester Pigott. Mr Chapman hoped he would make a hunter, but found to be unsuitable, sold him on to Keith for 250Gns as a 6yo, who saw some potential in the hitherto equine failure as a future chaser. Pigott sold a half share to a London hairdresser named Raymond Bessone, otherwise famously known as Teazie Weazie Raymond. Coiffure to the rich and famous, Teazie Weazie was once summoned to Hollywood by the fifties blonde bombshell, Diana Dors, for a shampoo and set at a fee of £2,500, so I don’t imagine training fees would have been a problem.\n\nHowever, Keith’s intuition about Ayala proved correct, and under his tutelage won 3 chases in the 1960-61 season, but developed a ligament problem and was Pinfired. (Pinfiring or Thermocutery while widely practised back in the day, was considered by many to be a cruel and barbaric practice, and as far as I can ascertain is now forbidden by racing’s rules). Being the son of jockey, Ernie Pigott, who had ridden the winner of 3 Grand Nationals, winning Aintree’s blue riband as a trainer, was one of Keith’s overriding ambitions. So, one suspects with more hope than expectation, he aimed his recovering, but very inexperienced chaser at the 1963 renewal of the great race.\n\nDespite starting at odds of 66/1 in the 47 runner field, (which contained 3 previous winners of the contest, Mr What, Kilmore and Nicolaus Silver) Keith’s confidence in Ayala’s chances must have dramatically increased by race day since it is rumoured that he was backed to win over £1Million, a really huge sum in 1963. Given a great ride by the 19 years old Irish jockey, Pat Buckley, he only made a single mistake, at the Canal Turn on the first circuit, and came to the final fence a length behind the amateur ridden, Carrickbeg, who following a terrific struggle up the long run in, weakened near the finish, and the gallant Ayala went on to win by 3/4 of a length.\n\nThe runner up was ridden by that, Doyen of the racing press room, and excellent amateur jockey, John, later Lord Oaksey, whose greatest contribution to racing was undoubtedly founding The Injured Jockeys Fund. I’m sure that, that myriad of National hunt and Flat riders who have had the misfortune to suffer the injuries which are an inevitable part of the sport over the years, are forever grateful for his foresight. Ayala never won again. He was pulled up in the 1964 renewal and only got as far as the first in 1965, but his ebullient and very camp co-owner, Teazie Weazie, enjoyed further Aintree glory when the Fred Rimell trained, and Richard Dunwoody ridden, Rag Trade brought home the bacon in 1976.\n\nBadsworth Boy: Winner of The Queen Mother Champion Chase in 1983, 84, and 85, he remains to this day, the only horse to have recorded 3 consecutive victories, in what is effectively the deciding heat of the two miler’s championship, an outcome surely beyond the imagination of his breeder, who had a sprint bred mare, (by Falcon)\n\ncovered by a son of Bold Ruler, (best known as a sire of precocious 2-year olds) Wolf Hayes in 1974. Foaled in 1975, Badsworth Boy did indeed win 2 of his 8 starts as a juvenile, when trained by Snowy Wainwright, minor 6f events at Beverly. However, suffering from Navicular disease, a condition affecting the feet, he was difficult to train and was sold to Mr Doug Armitage who had him gelded, and sent to the Dickinson’s jumping academy near Harewood in Yorkshire, to try his hand at the Winter game, a discipline he turned out to have a rare talent for, winning 8 times over hurdles, and eighteen times over fences.\n\nIn the first of his 3 Champion Chase victories he won by 35 lengths from Artifice with the previous years winner, Rathgorman well behind. The following year he won by 10L from the Gordon Richards trained Little Bay and in 1985 beat the talented Far Bridge by a similar distance.\n\nGreat credit for Badsworth Boy’s success has to go to both the Dickinson family, for keeping such a fragile animal sound, (as well as having Navicular disease he suffered all his life from a form of equine arthritis) and his rider, Robert Earnshaw, who is credited with teaching the horse his rapid fencing technique, more akin to hurdling than jumping. Indeed, Mary Reveley, who took over the reins from Son Michael for the 1984-85 campaign was certainly fullsome in her praise of Earnshaw, (now a senior NH steward) putting him right at the pinnacle of steeplechase jockeys. Michael Dickinson, still training very successfully in The US, has no hesitation in nominating Badsworth Boy as “the best I have trained”. Retired to his owners farm at the end of his highly successful racing career, Badsworth Boy enjoyed a long retirement before departing for even greener pastures, at the age of 27 in 2002.\n\nBahram: Foaled in 1932, he became the first winner of the traditional British Triple Crown, The 2000gns at Newmarket, The Epsom Derby, and The St Leger at Doncaster, since Rock Sand in 1903, and indeed, the only animal to have completed that elusive treble to the present day, was the mighty Nijinsky in 1970. Bred at his owners Egerton stud farm in County Kildare, he was by that hugely influential stallion, Blandford, who in the seven years between 1928 and 1935 sired The Derby winner 4 times. A real equine “goodlooker” his owner, The Aga Khan, (Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan111, to give him his full title) sent Bahram to be trained at Newmarket by Frank Butters.\n\nBahram remained unbeaten in his 9 race career, winning Sandown’s, National Breeders Produce Stakes on his 2yo debut, and followed up with 4 further juvenile victories, The Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood, The Gimcrack at York, Newmarket’s Boscawen Stakes, and rounded off his 2yo career winning The Middle Park at the same venue. Having developed into a really handsome, powerful looking colt, he got his 3yo career off to a flier with victory in The 2000gns. Starting at odds of 7/2 and partnered by his usual jockey, Freddie Fox, he won by 1 1/2L from Theft. Again partnered by Freddie, he started the 5/4 fav for The Derby, and was an easy winner, coming home 2L clear of The field. Bahram then started at 1/8 to maintain his unbeaten record in Ascot’s St James’s Palace Stakes and he did so, but was less than impressive in beating Portfolio. He was then made a very hot favourite at 4/11 to land the 3rd leg of The Triple Crown, and partner, Freddie, must have been cursing his luck when he sustained a serious injury in a fall the day before the Doncaster centrepiece. However, one man’s poison is another man’s meat, and the jockey who came in for the ride was the colourful Charlie Smirke, (son of a London fruit and fish dealer who earlier in his career had been warned off for 5 years)who had ridden the previous years Derby and St Leger winner, Windsor Lad. The new partnership never looked in any danger and they won by 5L from Solar Ray. Amusingly, after the race, Charlie expressed the opinion, that twelve stone and a brace of riders on his back wouldn’t have stopped the son of Blandford winning that day. Bahram was one of those really laid back horses, who did little on the gallops, and on the racecourse was rarely impressive, doing just enough to win, but neither at home, or on the racecourse, did any opponent ever succeed in getting to the bottom of him. His talented and highly successful trainer, Frank Butters, said that he could never really find out just how good he was.\n\nBeing by that huge influence on the British thoroughbred, Blandford, Irish and British bloodstockdealers were dismayed when the Aga Khan sold him to an American syndicate for £40,000 after only 2 seasons covering mares on this side of The Atlantic. While never siring anything nearly as good as himself he was moderately successful in The US, but was subsequently sold on to Argentina for $130,000 where he died at the age of 24.\n\nHis owner, Aga Khan111 was not only hugely influential on the turf, (won The Derby 5 times) but he was the Imam of the Shi’a Isma’ili Muslims, one of the most progressive, peaceful, and prosperous branches of Islam. During his reign of over 70 years his Golden, Diamond, and Platinum anniversaries we’re celebrated by his followers with a gift of either gold, diamonds, or platinum, to the weight of the Aga. You can’t blame him for carrying a few pounds overweight, can you? But on a more serious note, these amazing gifts were used to set up many international educational and charitable institutions, which survive to this day.\n\nBallinode: In the 91 renewals of The Cheltenham Gold Cup since it’s inception in 1924 only 4 members of the fairer sex figure on the great race’s roll of honour, and the first to do so was Ballinode. Owned by Sligo man, Christopher Bentley, from the village of Ballinode, he named the mare after his birthplace, and as her reputation blossomed she became known as “The Sligo Mare”. She was by a little known stallion called Machakos, (a son of the Coventry stakes winner Desmond) out of a mare called Celia, who was a half sister to The Ascot Gold Cup winner Love Wisely.\n\nTrained on The Curragh by Frank Morgan, she won plenty of races in Ireland, gaining quite a reputation for her speedy, (but not always accurate) jumping.\n\nShe made her Cheltenham debut in the 1924 National Hunt Handicap Chase, a race then worth over £1000, (The Gold Cup was worth nearly £400 less) and finished second. A month later she finished 8th in The Grand National, and that Autumn landed her first British success, The Grand Sefton Chase over Aintree’s National fences. In 1925, she warmed up for her attempt at Cheltenham’s Blue Riband with a victory at Nottingham in February, and about 4 weeks later on March 11th, lined up at Cheltenham the 3/1 second favourite in a field of four. Ridden by Ted Leader, the race soon developed into a duel between the odds on favourite, Alcazar and Ballinode. Full of running coming to the second last fence, the “Sligo Mare” flew the obstacle and galloped up the hill to win easily by 5L, and bring the £685 first prize back to Sligo. 18 days later, she started a 10/1 chance for the rather more valuable Grand National but there was to be no happy ending this time, and she failed to finish.\n\nThe other three mares to win The Gold Cup were Kerstin in 1958, Glencarraig Lady in 1972 and the great Dawn Run in 1986, who became the first animal to win both The Champion Hurdle and The Gold Cup, but it is worth noting that the first 2 raced carrying the same weight as their male counterparts, whereas when Dawn Run was making history, she benefited from the relatively newly introduced mares 7lbs allowance. For those of you who can remember that epic finish, fought out between Dawn Run and Wayward Lad in 1986, I just wonder if she would have won her unique place in the history books with another 7lbs on her back?\n\nBallymoss :Foaled in 1954, Ballymoss became the first Irish trained winner of The St Leger. He was by Mossborough, (not a top class performer in his racing career, only won 5 of his 17 starts, but became a highly successful stallion and sire of brood mares) out of a daughter of Singapore, Indian Call. Indian Call was pretty useless on the racecourse but was a daughter of the well bred Flittermere, winner of The Yorkshire Oaks, who was sold for 3,500Gns at the end of her racing career in 1929. Flittermere proved a disappointment at stud, and both her and her daughter, Indian Call were sent to the December Sales in 1939. Mum, Flittermere, was knocked down for a derisory 10Gns and then Irish Breeder, Mr Richard Ball landed, what must be one of the of the greatest equine bargains ever, when securing her daughter, Indian Call, for 15gns. (besides Ballymoss she bred 6 other winners).\n\nSubmitted to the Doncaster yearling Sales in 1955, the chestnut colt who was to become Ballymoss, was bought for 4,500gns by the 38 year old Vincent O’Brien, (already the winner of 4 Cheltenham Gold Cups, 3 Champion Hurdles and 3 Grand Nationals) acting on behalf of the American, Mr J. McShain.\n\nBackward at two, Ballymoss only ran 4 times, his sole success coming in Leopardstown’s Laragh Maiden Plate, worth £202 to the winner. He made a stuttering start to his 3yo career, finishing unplaced in the 7 furlong Madrid Free Handicap, but stepped up to 1 1/2 miles for The Trigo Stakes next time, won comfortably, and generous odds of 100/1 for Epsom’s Blue Riband were quickly snapped up. Starting at 33/1 on Derby Day, despite his preparation having been held up by a foot injury, the son of Mossborough finished an honourable 2nd under jockey T.P. Burns, a length and a half behind the top class Crepello. After Epsom, Ballymoss comfortably won The Irish Derby, but then probably in need of the run, finished unplaced in that good St Leger trial at York, The Great Voltigeur Stakes. With testing conditions prevailing on Town Moor on the day of the St Leger, the odds on the O’Brien horse drifted from 5/1 to 8/1, but belying the lack of market confidence, he had little difficulty in seeing off the challenge of the runner up, Court Harwell. Finishing out the back in the final race of his 3yo campaign, the Champion Stakes, did nothing to enhance Ballymoss’s burgeoning reputation, but with another year on his back, greatness awaited!\n\nHe made his 4yo debut in Chester’s Ormonde Stakes in the Spring of 1958, and lost nothing in defeat, when clearly in need of the run, he finished 2nd to Doutelle. He then went on to win in succession, four of the racing worlds premier contests, The Coronation Cup, The Eclipse Stakes, The King GeorgeV1 and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and finally, Europe’s championship event, The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe. Regrettably, his final race came in The Washington International, at Laurel park, a very tight track, with a short run in, totally unsuited to the long striding chestnut colt. In a particularly rough race, where the winner was disqualified, he finished 3rd, bringing the curtain down on one of racing’s most outstanding careers.\n\nBallymoss won a record £114,150 in prize money, a sum only surpassed by the Paddy Prendergast trained Ragusa 5 years later. His career as a stallion wasn’t exceptional, but he did produce one outstanding animal, the 1967 Derby winner, Royal Palace.\n\nBattleship: Foaled in 1927, he was by that great American racehorse, Man o’War, who would have remained unbeaten in a 21 race career but for the incompetence of his rider. ( in a small field 2yo heat, jockey Loftus, managed to get himself hopelessly boxed in) As a stallion, Man o’War exerted a powerful influence on the breed, but I’m sure that few would have anticipated him siring the only animal to win both The Grand National, and the US version, The American Grand National; Battleship.\n\nCampaigned on the flat at two and three, with plenty of success, he won 10 of his 22 starts before being sold for $12,000 to Mrs Marion Du Pont Scott, a scion of the fabulously wealthy Du Pont clan, and wife to that well known hero of the silver screen, Randolph Scott. Despite Battleship standing at less than 15.2 hands, extremely small for a chaser, that was the route Marion chose for her new acquisition, and her judgement proved correct. He won 3 of his 4 starts over fences in his first season, and in 1934 won America’s most prestigious chasing event, The American Grand National.\n\nNever a very sound animal, but recovering from a bowed tendon, Ms Du Pont decided in 1936 to have a crack at the real thing, and sent her “pocket” Battleship to be trained in England by Reginald Hobbs for the 1937 Grand National. He won several races for Reg but many in the press considered Aintree a step too far for such a small animal, and he was withdrawn from the 1937 renewal. However, the son of Man o’War continued to perform on the racecourse, including winning the Welsh Grand National, and he was again entered for the 1938 renewal. Now an 11yo he was to be partnered by a rider only six years older than himself, the trainers son, Bruce, and between them they made history that day in April 1938 when they beat the Irish Horse, Royal Danieli, (ridden by Tommy Carberry’s future father in law, and trainer of the dual Gold Cup and Grand National winner L’Escargot, Dan Moore) by a short head. Bruce was, and still is the youngest jockey to have ever ridden the winner, and of course Battleship became the first to win both the American and English Grand National’s.\n\nA real rarity amongst the National Hunt brigade, Battleship was an entire animal, (the previous winning Grand National entire was Grudon in 1901) and he sired 2 steeplechase champions, plus the 1952 winner of The American Grand National, Sea Legs. Following a long retirement, he sank to his own spot in “Davy Jones’s Locker” at the age of 31 in 1958.\n\nFootnote; the American Grand National has some interesting connections to the British hurdling scene. The late Toby Balding, trained Morley Street to win it in 1990, and again in 1991, having won The Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham about three months earlier. The American horse Flatterer won the 1983 renewal of The American Grand National and 4 years later ran the three times winning Champion Hurdler See You Then to a length and a half in the 1987 renewal of Cheltenham’s hurdling Crown.\n\nBest Mate: Bred in Ireland by the Dutch businessman, Jacques Van’t Hart, the triple Gold Cup winning Best Mate was by the French stallion Un Desperado, out of the mare Katday. His dam was pretty useless on the racecourse but certainly made her mark as a broodmare, not only producing Best Mate, a winner of 14 of his 22 starts, but also bred his two full brothers, Cornish Rebel and Inca Trail, who between them won 16 races. Foaled in January 1995, he was trained by Henrietta Knight, (ably assisted by her husband, the 3 times champion Jockey from the sixties, Terry Biddlecombe).\n\nBest Mate made his racecourse debut in a NH flat race at Cheltenham in November 1999, sporting the claret and blue colours of midlands businessman Jim Lewis, (Jim was a lifetime Aston Villa supporter). He won by a hard fought 3/4 of a length, but 19 days later had a much easier time, winning his first hurdles race in a canter at Sandown. A close 2nd in The Supreme Novices Hurdle at the Cheltenham festival, and a Grade2 victory at Aintree, followed in the Spring of 2000, before he was put away for the season.\n\nBest Mate made his chasing debut a winning one, at Exeter in October 2000, (a Mr Markus Jooste had purchased a 40% share in Best Mate for £242,000 in the meantime) and the following month demonstrated his liking for Prestbury Park, easily winning the Grade2 November Novices Chase at the big Autumn meeting. Another easy victory followed in the Grade1 Scilly Isles Novices Chase at Sandown in February 2001, but alas, Cheltenham plans had to be shelved, as The Festival was cancelled due to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth.\n\nBeaten 3/4 of a length by the Willie Mullins trained Florida Pearl in the 2001 renewal of the King George VI Chase, Christmas 2001, he lined up eleven weeks later for his first attempt at Cheltenham’s Blue Riband, and won by 1 3/4Lengths and 8Lengths, at odds of 7/1, outstaying the Ruby Walsh ridden, Commanche Court, and the 1999 victor, See More Business.\n\nThe following season he went one better in the King George V1 Chase, beating the Nicky Henderson trained Marlborough by a length and a half, and then had little trouble in landing his second Gold Cup, winning by 10 Lengths from Truckers tavern. He looked better than ever when taking the 2003 renewal of The Ericsson Chase at Leopardstown in December, and 81 days later started at odds on to become the first horse since the mighty Arkle to win three Cheltenham Gold Cups. He did so, but not in the style expected, having to be driven out by Culloty to win by 3/4 of a length from the 155 rated outsider Sir Rembrandt. Put away after Cheltenham, he reappeared at Exeter in November 2004 where he struggled to beat an animal rated 19lbs his inferior, and 39 days after that was well beaten by Beef or Salmon in The Lexus Chase at Leopardstown, never looking as if a 4th Gold Cup was in prospect. Missing the 2005 Cheltenham Festival, he reappeared at Exeter 308 days after Leopardstown, and going wrong before the third last, was pulled up by Pilot, Paul Carberry, where sadly, the Cheltenham hero collapsed and died.\n\nUndoubtedly Best Mate was an outstanding chaser, but suggestions by some, including the late lamented Terry Biddlecome, that he was better than Arkle are fanciful. The only thing they had in common was winning 3 Gold Cups, and the highly respected Timeform organisation have Arkle rated on 212 and Best Mate 30lbs lower on 182.\n\nBosra Sham: An American bred filly by Woodman out of the Riverman mare, Korveya, foaled in February 1993, was sent from Kentucky to the 1994 Tattersalls Houghton yearling Sales at Newmarket, and her breeder, Mr G, Leigh, must have been hoping to see the filly realise a substantial price as she was a full sister to the colt, Hector Protector, who had been the champion French juvenile in 1990, and French 2000Gns winner in 1991. She was also a half sister, to the French 1000Gns winner Shanghai.\n\nHis hopes were certainly not in vain, as she was knocked down to the Syrian businessman, Wafic Said for 530,000gns, the highest price paid for a yearling anywhere in Europe that year. Named after the ancient Syrian town of Bosra, (Busra ash Sham) the chestnut filly was sent to be trained by the master of Warren Place, Henry Cecil. As Henry’s record graphically demonstrates, he was the consummate trainer of the thoroughbred racehorse, but having trained 8 winners of The Oaks, and 6 winners of The 1000Gns, he clearly had a particular touch with fillies, and he needed all his skill in that department to keep the new inmate of Warren Place sound for the 10 races she contested between 1995 and 1997. The apple of Henry’s Eye was a real speed machine on the Newmarket gallops, but she had a very dodgy front off fore foot, so it was to his great credit that he managed to train her to win 7 of her 10 starts, three of them at the top level.\n\nShe bolted up on her racecourse debut in a Newbury Maiden in August 1995, and 24 days later won the Group1 Fillies Mile at Ascot just as easily, before retiring for the season. She reappeared in the 1000Gns trial, The Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury the following April, winning very easily on easy ground, before lining up for The 1000Gns 16 days later as the 10/11 favourite. She duly justified the price winning by 1 1/2Lengths from the subsequent Irish 1000Gns winner, Matiya, on the good/firm ground, but entered the winners enclosure as if she was walking on hot coals, and Henry wisely gave her an extended Summer break. She reappeared in The Queen Elizabeth11 Stakes at the end of September, needing the run after 146 days on the sidelines, and on the good/firm ground, went down by 1 1/4Lengths to Mark Of Esteem, with all guns blazing. 3 weeks later she put up the best performance of her career when comfortably beating the 5yo Halling in The Champion Stakes, and finished the season with the title of, “European Champion Three Year Old Filly”.\n\nShe commenced her 4yo campaign with victories at Group3 and 2 level, but then could only finish 3rd in The Eclipse Stakes at Sandown behind Pilsudski, and was clearly past her best when trailing in last of four behind Singspiel in The International at York, bringing the curtain down on the career of one of the highest rated fillies of the last 50 years.\n\nAt stud Bosra Sham produced 5 live foals, but nothing nearly as good as herself, the best of them being the horse Rosberg, who won a Group3 at the Vancouver track, Hastings Racecourse, and he still stands as a stallion in Canada.\n\nBrigadier Gérard: when John Hislop, owner/breeder and racing journalist par excellence, was looking for a name for his newly foaled son of Queens Hussar, out of The Prince Chevalier mare, La Paiva, (foaled 5th March 1968) he was inspired to call him after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s eponymous hero, and what a prescient name it turned out to be. Doyle’s comedic character, arrogant and self confident in the extreme, was totally convinced of his own superiority in all things, and his equine counterpart, when it came to performing on the racecourse, certainly showed that he was. Trained by Dick Hern at West Ilsley, and ridden in all his races by Joe Mercer, the “Brigadier” was only beaten once in an 18 race career, and that was following an unbeaten run of 15 straight wins.\n\nThe beautifully balanced, bay colt, made an instant impression on his racecourse debut at two in Newbury’s Berkshire Stakes , winning by an eased down 5 lengths. He followed up with two further facile victories before stepping up to the top level in Newmarket’s Middlepark Stakes. He again won with his head in his chest, from that top sprinter, Mummy’s Pet, and was retired for the season with his connections eyes firmly fixed on the 1971 2000Gns.\n\nHern, trainer of 16 British Classic winners, deemed that a prep run before the Guineas was unnecessary, and Brigadier Gérard lined up at Newmarket as the market’s 3rd choice (11/2) behind the previous years two top juveniles, Mill Reef, (6/4) and My Swallow, (9/4). Despite the two market leaders running up to their best form, they were no match for the impressive “Brigadier,” who showing an amazing turn of foot, accelerated past them both and won by 3 Lengths from the brilliant Mill Reef. When you consider the runner up remained unbeaten for the rest of his career, winning The Derby, The Eclipse Stakes, The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe, The Prix Ganay and finally The Coronation Cup, that Guineas run must have been one of the greatest ever. After The Guineas “The Brigadier” continued on his unbeaten path, landing The St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, The Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, which he won by 5 Lengths from another subsequently unbeaten animal, Faraway Son, and then doubled that winning distance in The Goodwood Mile. Further success followed in The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and then, stepped up to 10 furlongs for the first time in The Champion Stakes, he brought the curtain down on a magnificent season, winning, albeit by only the minimum distance, from the Irish horse Rarity.\n\nHis sparkling form continued at four, winning his first 5 races, including, The Prince of Wales at Royal Ascot, The Eclipse Stakes at Sandown, and The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes again at Ascot, so when he lined up for the inaugural running of The Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York for his 16th undefeated start the overriding majority of the racing public thought that defeat for the 1/3 favourite was unthinkable. However, nobody told the Derby winner, Roberto, nor his Panamanian jockey, Braulio Baeza and the pair set off at a breakneck pace. The Vincent O’Brien trained Roberto maintained the furious pace right to the finish, easily breaking the course record and crossed the line 3 lengths in front of Brigadier Gérard. Pilot, Joe Mercer, in an effort to excuse his mounts defeat, tried to assert that he was a sick animal, but considering that The Brigadier also broke the course record, and finished 10 lengths (a revue of the tape recording showed it to be more like 17 Lengths) clear of the 3rd horse, the talented Gold Rod, it was in fact one of “The Brigadiers” best performances ever, a conclusion his sporting owners Mr and Mrs Hislop were more than happy to concur with. It was back to winning ways with a second win in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes next time out for the “Brigadier” and then he brought his magnificent career to an appropriate end, winning a second Champion Stakes, beating the French horse Riverman, by 1 1/2 lengths. Co-rated on 141 with Mill Reef at the end of his 3yo career by Timeform, a mark increased to 144 at four, makes The Brigadier, along with Tudor Minstrel, the two highest rated English trained horses of the 20th Century.\n\nBrigadier Gérard wasn’t a great success at stud but he did sire one Classic winner, Light Cavalry who Dick Hern trained to win The St Leger.\n\nBrown Jack: one of the most popular racehorses of the post World War I era, was foaled in County Offaly, in the midlands of Ireland in 1924. A brown colt by the stallion, Jackdaw, it didn’t require any great stretch of the imagination to find a name for the colt, who in the course of a 7 year career, caught the imagination of not only the racing public, but the nation as a whole.\n\nThoughts of the yearlings future popularity will have been far from the mind of his breeder, George Webb, when the brown colt didn’t attract a single bid at the Ballsbridge Sales in 1925, and George had to accept the offer of a paltry £110 from a Mr Marcus Thompson who spotted him in the unsold pen. The Brown Jack story might well have ended there but for the unreliability of racehorse trainer, Charlie Rogers’ motor car. It broke down outside Thompson’s Tipperary home the following year while on his way to Limerick Junction, (now Tipperary) racecourse, where he spotted the now gelded 2yo, grazing contentedly in a paddock. Liking what he saw, and impressed by the fact that he was by the 1912 winner of the Queen Alexandra Stakes, Jackdaw, Charlie managed to get Thompson to part with him for £275.\n\nWhile Charlie’s new stoutly bred acquisition , (his dam was by the stayer Kroonstad) was always going to need a trip, he decided to give him a couple of outings as a 3yo, firstly over 6 furlongs at Navan and then over five at the now defunct Phoenix Park racecourse. He finished last at Navan, and unplaced at Phoenix Park, but Charlie liked what he saw and offered the horse to Wiltshire handler, Aubrey Hastings. Hastings who was looking for a potential Hurdler on behalf of patron, Sir Harold Wernher who was keen to have a contender in the newly inaugurated Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, was happy to pay £750 for the gelding, with a further contingency £50 to be paid if Brown Jack managed to win a race, and the horse was shipped to Aubrey’s yard at Wroughton in Wiltshire.\n\nHe made his hurdling debut over 1 1/2 miles at Bournemouth in September 1927 finishing 3rd, and over the course of the following 11 weeks won his next 5 races. Laid low with a virus over Christmas, he reappeared in February 1928 needing the run, and then landed his 6th victory at the end of the month at Leicester. He had a final prep race before his attempt at The Champion Hurdle, the weekend before Cheltenham, finishing 2nd to Peace River at Lingfield, form he reversed the following week. He won the Champion Hurdle at odds of 4/1, beating Peace River by 1 1/2 Lengths, and had the 2/1 favourite, and winner of the inaugural running of The Champion Hurdle the previous year, Blaris, 6 Lengths back in 3rd.\n\nAccompanying the winning connections after the race was the Ex champion (10 times between 1914 and 1923) and hugely popular flat jockey, Steve Donoghue, and when asked if he thought the 4yo was good enough to campaign and win on the flat, his reply was emphatically in the affirmative, and added that he would ride him. So started a famous relationship that would see the duo winning an amazing 6 consecutive renewals of The Queen Alexandra Stakes at the Berkshire venue.\n\nClearly an Ascot specialist, he won his first race there in 1928, The Ascot Stakes, and when you consider the Royal event, (the biggest and most prestigious in the racing calendar) was the sole meeting held in the year at Ascot in those days, it is amazing that Brown Jack actually ran there 11 times, winning on 7 occasions. He was by no means a one track phenomenon though, as besides landing Cheltenham’s hurdling Blue Riband he also won The Goodwood and Doncaster Cups in 1930, The Chester Cup in 1931 and the same years Ebor Handicap at York carrying 9st-5lbs. A glaring omission on the CV of such an outstanding stayer is an Ascot Gold Cup victory, but in those days geldings were excluded from the contest. However, even a cursory glance at many colatteral form lines, strongly suggest that he would have comfortably won the prize on more than one occasion.\n\nIn 1934, at the age of 10, Brown Jack lined up for the Queen Alexandra Stakes for the 6th time, and partnered by the man who had ridden him to nearly all his successes, in front of an enormous crowd, the gallant brown horse didn’t let his adoring fans down, easily winning the race for the sixth time. He entered Ascot’s hallowed winners enclosure for a record 7th and final time, bringing the curtain down on his fabulous career. Retired to his wealthy owners estate he enjoyed a 14 year retirement before dying at the age of 24 in 1948.\n\nBrown Lad: When we hear “triple Grand National winner,” thoughts immediately turn to the Aintree legend that is Red Rum, but there is another largely forgotten equine hero whose CV also includes victory in three Grand Nationals, and whose racecourse achievements certainly merit comparison with Red Rums’, Brown Lad.\n\nFoaled in 1966, he was by the St Leger winner, Sayajirao, and bred by his owner, Joe Osborne of Naas, was trained by Paddy Osborne. A grandson of the great Nearco, he was certainly an extreme example of the late developer, as he was nearly eight before he faced the starter. Amusingly, when asked the reason for his late introduction, Joe quipped, “because we couldn’t catch him”. When he did get to the racecourse he won a couple of bumpers just before his 8th birthday, and then having followed up with 3 straight victories over hurdles in early 1974, was made favourite for the Royal & Sun Alliance Hurdle at The Cheltenham Festival,a race he won very easily, by 8 Lengths under Ron Barry. Following Cheltenham, Joe accepted an offer from Mrs Peter Burrell, and she transferred the horse from Paddy Osborne to Jim Dreaper, (son of Tom “Arkle” Dreaper) at Kilsallaghan in North Co Dublin.\n\nJim sent the strapping 8yo straight over fences at the start of the new season, and he made an immediate impact under his new partner, Tommy Carberry, winning a Punchestown Maiden, and then the prestigious Reynoldstown Chase at Ascot. Reverting to hurdles for the 1975 Cheltenham Festival, he won what is now The World Hurdle, completing a pretty unique double for trainer Jim Draper, jockey Tommy Carberry, and breeder Joe Osborne, all three who were also responsible for The Gold Cup winner, Ten Up, that same day. The following month Brown Lad showed what a versatile animal he was, contesting Ireland’s Premier Chase, The Irish Grand National. Still not out of the Novice class, and with Carberry doing the steering, he won the very competitive event, by an easy 8 lengths.\n\nThe following year, now ten, he won the valuable Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park before contesting The Cheltenham Gold Cup for the first time. With two fences to jump in Cheltenham’s Blue Riband, the chances of him even claiming 4th place money looked remote, but he came up that famous hill with such a flourish that he finished 2nd, and if the race had been 100yds longer, might well have caught the Fred Rimell trained winner, Royal Frolic. However, it was upwards and onwards for the tough Brown Lad, and the following month landed his second Irish Grand National, this time carrying an eye watering 12-2 by a comfortable 4 lengths.\n\nSidelined by injury for the entire 1976/77 season, he made a winning reappearance just before his 12th birthday at Down Royal, and then put up a terrific performance in the 1978 renewal of The Thyestes Chase, going down by a head to the useful Kintai, who was receiving 37 pounds. With the ground coming up heavy at Cheltenham, conditions looked ideal for the 12yo to add a Gold Cup to his impressive CV, but unfortunately the fates thought otherwise, and the race was postponed due to snow, and rescheduled for April. So It was straight to Fairyhouse for Brown Lad and his date with destiny, aiming to be the first, (and to date the only) horse to win 3 Irish Grand Nationals. With Carberry unavailable, Jim gave the ride to the inexperienced Gerry O’Dowd, who justified the trainers faith, bringing the gallant 12yo home in front with 12-2 on his back.\n\nThe rescheduled Cheltenham Gold Cup, run on good ground, very soon after after Brown Lad’s record breaking win at Fairyhouse, resulted in victory for the Fred Winter trained Midnight Court, ridden by Johnny Francome, but for connections of the Irish runner, the race must have evoked memories of the 1976 renewal. The 12yo’s chances again looked remote before the second last fence, but then in hallmark fashion, he flew up that attritional hill, passing five horses to finish second. Hindsight is a wonderful, thing, but I’ve little doubt that had the race been run on its original date in March, on ground that Brown Lad thrived on, the prize would have been destined for North Co Dublin.\n\nBula: A 3yo gelding by Raincheck out of the winning Hurdler, Pongo’s Fancy, was knocked down to Captain Bill Edwards-Heathcote for 1,350Gns at the Ballsbridge Sales in 1968 and he immediately sent him across the Irish Sea to be trained by Fred Winter, at his Uplands yard in Lambourn. Euphisms such as Carthorse, Warhorse, and even more insultingly, Lunatic, were used to describe the new arrival, but it soon became clear that the Irish bred 3yo was a Hurdler of exceptional potential.\n\nHe made his racecourse debut at Lingfield in November 1969, winning easily under Stan Mellor, and followed up in similar fashion at Worcester before winning 3 further races at Wincanton. Unbeaten, he was made favourite for the second division of The Gloucestershire Hurdle, at the 1970 Cheltenham Festival, and won with his head in his chest, making it a 6th straight win for the 5 year old.\n\nRetired for the season, he reappeared in the Autumn of 1970, and kept the winning streak going with 6 further victories the last of which was in Wincanton’s Champion Hurdle Trial, The Kingwell Hurdle, which he won easily and had the triple Champion Hurdle winner Persian War, 10 Lengths back in 3rd. Bula was then made favourite to win The Champion Hurdle itself, and he sent his supporters home on excellent terms with themselves, winning comfortably by 4 Lengths from Persian War, and in the process registering his thirteenth consecutive victory\n\nBula might easily have made it a fourteenth the following term on his seasonal debut, but for a mistake at the last, as he was only beaten a neck. However he soon resumed winning ways with a comfortable Sandown win, but unfortunately sustaining a minor injury. On the easy list for 4 months, he reappeared at Wincanton in February, and showed that he was fully recovered, winning a second Kingwell Hurdle. Made the 8/11 favourite to win his second Champion Hurdle he did so in the manner an odds on chance should. He won by 8 Lengths from The Triumph Hurdle winner, Boxer, but it could have been a very different story if his pilot, Paul Kelleway, who had been tracking Dondieu all the way, hadn’t been inspired to alter course just before the 3rd last, where the unfortunate Dondieu came down, breaking his neck, and causing all sorts of havoc around him. Bula could only manage 2nd place in The Welsh Champion Hurdle in his final race of the season, but this didn’t stop him being nominated by an overwhelming majority of the panel, “Champion NH Horse” for the second year running.\n\nHis 1972/73 campaign commenced with a walkover, followed by a facile win in a 2 runner affair, before finishing 4th to Captain Christy in The Sweeps Hurdle at Leopardstown. He then won his next 2 races including a third Kingwell Hurdle and was again made a short priced favourite to land a third Champion Hurdle, and a place in the record books alongside Hattons Grace, Sir Ken, and Persian war. It wasn’t to be however and he finished 5th behind the Fred Rimell trained, Comedy Of Errors, and was then beaten by the same animal in The Welsh Champion Hurdle in receipt of 6lbs.\n\nNow eight, and with his prospects in the hurdling field looking rather diminished, connections opted for a change of disciplines, and the son of Raincheck embarked on a career over the larger obstacles. While never reaching the heady heights he did over hurdles, Bula proved to be a natural over fences winning his first 4 chases, the first two by an aggregate of 32 Lengths, and finished the 1973/74 season with a tally of 5/6. Having won a 3 mile chase at Windsor in early 1975 connections were encouraged to enter him for The Cheltenham Gold Cup, hoping he could become the first Champion Hurdler to land Chasing’s Blue Riband. Hopes were still alive with just the one obstacle to jump, but a mistake at the final fence on the heavy ground proved his undoing and he finished 3rd, 6 lengths behind the winner Ten Up.\n\nThe 1975/76 season saw him notch up wins at Haydock and Windsor and he was made favourite for The Gold Cup but now, eleven he could only finish 6th to Royal Frolic. The 1976/77 campaign saw him win twice before Christmas, at Market Rasen and Haydock Park where he had Red Rum back in 3rd, and following a promising run in The Gainsborough Chase, was entered for The Two Mile Champion Chase at the Festival. However, the gallant Bula, now twelve years old, got no further than the 5th fence where he fell heavily, and sustained such a severe injury that he had to be put down a couple of months later. A real champion, he won an amazing 34 times and many think that if the weather gods had been kinder on that Thursday in March 1975, Dawn Run, 11 years later, would have only been the second horse to claim Cheltenham’s two top prizes.\n\nBurrough Hill Lad: local Leicestershire farmer and small businessman Stan Riley, paid £450 for a mare called Green Monkey, who proving pretty useless on the racecourse, had her covered by the less than prolific local stallion, Richboy, (won the Brittania Stakes at Ascot) and the product of this rather improbable union, born in April 1976, turned out to be one of the best chasers of the last 50 years. (His Timeform rating of 184 is the 7th highest ever awarded to a Steeplechaser) Stan named the foal for his local village, Burrough-On-The-Hill and 3 years later sent the tall unfurnished horse, to be trained by Jimmy Harris, a never say die ex NH jockey, who had to train from the confines of a wheelchair. The big, backward, brown gelding did well for Jimmy, winning twice before meeting with a near fatal accident at Kempton Park in January 1980. He lay motionless by the last hurdle, his rider trapped beneath him, and the men with the green screens hovering ominously for at least 5 minutes, before miraculously struggling back to his feet. He had sustained severe damage to his neck and it took all the skill of equine osteopath, Ronnie Longford to realign his many displaced vertebrae.\n\nFollowing a brief stint with Walter Wharton for whom the big horse won a couple of handicap hurdles, Stan, with a Chasing career in mind for the son of Richboy, decided to send him to that Doyenne of Steeplechase trainers, the Lambourn female Maestro, Jenny Pitman. In this first season with Jenny, (1981/82) he raced 9 times, 7 of them over fences where his cavalier approach to the obstacles cost him dearly, and he failed to complete on a couple of occasions. Notwithstanding his lack of care at his fences, Burrough Hill Lad, showed that his career was on a very definite upwards trajectory when landing the valuable Mildmay Chase at Aintree in April 1982. Leg trouble was a concern, (as it continued to be throughout his career) the following season and he only raced 3 times, winning twice, and in November 1982 put up an excellent performance, running the Gold Cup winner, Silver Buck to 2 1/2 Lengths at Haydock.\n\nHe started the 1983/84 campaign with a 3rd over hurdles at Nottingham in December 1983, but then ran up a fantastic sequence of 8 consecutive victories which included the 1983 Welsh Grand National, The Cheltenham Gold Cup, The Charlie Hall Chase, The Hennessy Gold Cup and The King George VI Chase at Kempton. He was an impressive winner of Cheltenham’s Blue Riband under substitute pilot, Phil Tuck, where he beat the John Francome ridden, Brown Chamberlain, by 3 Lengths, but made an even bigger impression in The Hennessy Gold Cup where he won by 4 Lengths, carrying twelve stone, from The RSA Chase winner, Canny Danny, to whom he was conceding 21Lbs, a performance evocative of the great days of Arkle 20 years earlier.\n\nHis dodgy legs in 1985 kept him on the sidelines until he made a winning reappearance in Sandown’s Gainsborough Chase in 1986. However leg problems again intervened, and attempts to train him for the 1987 Gold Cup were again frustrated. He finally broke down on the gallops in 1988 and was retired to enjoy a well earned, 16 year long retirement.\n\nCaergwrle: A filly named after the Flintshire village of Caergwrle, was bred by Gwen Murless, wife of the Legendary Noel, at their Castle Stud near Helmsley in Yorkshire.\n\nFoaled in 1965 she was by the outstanding racehorse and stallion, Crepello, winner of both The 2000 Guineas and Derby, out of Caerphilly, a brood mare by Abernant, who was probably the best sprinter of the 20th century. As husband Noel, trainer of 19 English Classics, 11 of them with fillies, (1000Guineas x6 The Oaks x5) had overseen the careers of both Crepello and Abernant, the outlook for the well made new female addition at Castle Stud looked propitious.\n\nRacing in Gwens colours, (as she did for all her career) the filly made a fairly promising debut, finishing second in the 5f Star Stakes at Sandown, and on the strength of that run started at 2/5 in a field of 4 for The Findon Stakes at Goodwood over the same trip. Much to the disgust of punters who took the skinny odds, she bolted before the start but still took part in the heat finishing 12Lengths behind the winner. In her only other race at two she got off the mark, winning The Combermere Maiden Stakes at Chester in September 1967.\n\nCaergwrle looked a vastly improved animal in Kemptons 1000 Guineas Trial on her 3yo debut the following April. She easily won the 7f heat by 4 Lengths and was made 4/1 favourite for The 1000 Guineas itself. Partnered by the 19 year old Scot, Sandy Barclay, she never looked in trouble on the Rowley Mile, and won the Classic comfortably by a length from Photo Flash, with Soverign back in 3rd, once again underlining Noel Murless’s genius with fillies. She only had one more race before retiring, finishing a disappointing 2nd in Epsom’s Ebbisham Stakes over 8 1/2F the following month. Now a Classic winner with an enviable pedigree, the decision to retire her to the paddocks must have been an easy one to make. At stud she remained in the Murless family’s ownership, and produced 11 live foals, but alas none of them approaching anything close to her own class. The best of them was probably her last, St Ninian, foaled when she was 21, and a winner of 7 races.\n\nCamelot: Foaled in March 2009, he was bred by Sheikh Abdulla Bin Isa Al-Khalifa and reared at the Highclere stud in the heart of the Hampshire Downs. He is by the outstanding stallion Montjeu, a son of Saddlers Wells, and sire of three previous Epsom Derby winners, out of the Kingmambo broodmare Tarfah, a winner of 5 of her 8 races including at Group level, so it wasn’t surprising that Coolmore’s principal buyer, Dermot “Demi” O’Byrne had to fork out north of half a million Guineas to secure the athletic looking colt at Newmarket’s Tattersalls yearling Sales in 2010.\n\nPut into training with the Ballydoyle Maestro Aidan O’Brien, Camelot made his racecourse debut in mid July 2011 in a Leopardstown Maiden, and winning the relatively minor heat so easily, encouraged the layers to install the son of Montjeu as favourite for The Derby, still 11 months away. Three months later, in the Group1 Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, he confirmed the favourable impression created at Leopardstown with another facile victory and retired for the season as the winter favourite for not only The Derby, but also The 2000 Guineas.\n\nHe made his seasonal debut in the Newmarket Classic, and starting at odds of 15/8 looked to have it all to do approaching the two furlong marker, but under strong encouragement from the plate, (Joseph O’Brien), led inside the final furlong, and staying on well, won by a neck. Four weeks later, in the smallest Derby field since 1907, starting at the cramped odds of 8/13, Joseph gave his pretty inexperienced mount plenty of time to find his feet coming down that tricky hill, but entering the straight he closed readily on the field and taking it up a furlong out went away to win impressively by an eased down 5 Lengths from the subsequent 4 times American Grade1 winner, Main Sequence. Aidan and the 19 year old Joseph made a piece of racing history on the day, becoming the first father and son combination to win Epsom’s Blue Riband, and Camelot became only the 3rd animal since Nijinsky in 1970, (Nashwan 1989 and Sea The Stars 2009 the other two) to bring off the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby Double. A subsequent 2 length victory in The Irish Derby left many convinced that Camelot must be a shoe in to go one better again, and equal the great Nijinsky’s Triple Crown achievement by winning The St Leger. Starting at a prohibitive 2/5 in the 9 runner field, Joseph again held the hot favourite up towards the back, and 3 furlongs out went for an ambitious run up the rails, but finding his way blocked had to be switched. Meanwhile the 25/1 outsider Encke, given a great ride by Mickael Barzalona, had poached a 3 length lead, and despite the unbalanced Camelot’s best efforts, he couldn’t close the gap and went down by 3/4 of a Length. (Encke the following year along with 21 other horses trained by Mahmoud Al Zarooni tested positive for Anabolic Steroids and was suspended). In his final race of 2012 Camelot could only finish 7th to the filly Solemia a 33/1 outsider ridden by Olivier Peslier in The Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe and was retired for the season. He did win a Curragh Group3 on his reappearance in 2013, and was a respectable second and fourth in two Group1s at The Curragh and Royal Ascot, but never again showed anything close to his marvellous form at Epsom, and was retired to stud at Coolmore. He is proving a success as a stallion and is the sire of plenty of quality winners amongst them, the recent Cox Plate winner Sir Dragonet in Australia, and The Irish Derby winner, Latrobe.\n\nCaptain Christy: One of the best chasers of the 1970s and indeed of any other decade, was Foaled in 1967. By Mon Capitane out of the Bowsprit mare, Christy’s Bow, he made his racecourse debut 4 years later ridden by his rather eccentric owner, Major Joe Pidcock. The gelding did manage to win one of his six starts in that 71/72 season under the sixty something Major, but proved such a difficult/dangerous ride for his ageing pilot that he sent him to that outstanding horseman, Pat (Arkle) Taffe, to continue his instruction. At the Taffe yard he caught the eye of a wealthy New Zealand couple, Mr and Mrs Samuels, who made an offer the good Major couldn’t refuse, and Captain Christie spent the rest of his career racing in the colours of Mrs Jane Samuels.\n\nIt proved to be money well spent by the New Zealand pair, as in the 72/73 campaign their purchase won 5 hurdle races, including the valuable Sweeps Hurdle at Leopardstown, a non handicap in those days, where under Bobby Beasley he beat the 1972 Champion Hurdle winner Bula by 4 Lengths. Another win at the Co Dublin track in The Scalp Hurdle followed, before finishing an excellent 3rd in The Champion Hurdle behind Comedy Of Errors and Easby Abbey, and then brought the curtain down on his hurdling career with a facile win in The Scottish Champion Hurdle.\n\nSwitched to the larger obstacles for the 1973/74 campaign it soon became clear that the son of Mon Capitaine was clearly an exceptional chaser but did have a worrying tendency to miss out the occasional fence, spectacularly illustrated when coming to grief at Ascot and Haydock with both races at his mercy. However he won all six completed starts, which included The 1974 Cheltenham Gold Cup, a fantastic feat for a novice. Mind you supporters at Prestbury Park would have had their hearts in their mouths when he made a hash of the last fence, but the 3 times Champion Jockey, Bobby Beasley didn’t panic, got the 7yo back on an even keel, and galloped up the hill to land the spoils, winning by 5 Lengths from the 1973 winner, The Dikler. Captain Christy went on to conclude his first season over fences on another high note, winning the valuable Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse.\n\nThe 74/75 campaign again featured a mixed bag of performances, which was becoming his hallmark, ranging from the abysmal to the sublime. He never looked likely to successfully defend his Gold Cup Crown on ground that was close to unraceable, and failed to feature in either The Thyestes Chase or Irish Grand National, but ran brilliantly in The Leopardstown Chase, gave the brilliant Pendil a thrashing in the 1974\n\nKing George V1 Chase at Christmas, and just failed to give the very useful April Seventh over 2 Stone in The Whitbread Gold Cup. His trainer Pat Taffe never doubted his stable stars jumping prowess, blaming very soft ground which the horse hated for his inconsistency, and there was certainly little wrong with his fencing technique on trips to France when winning over Enghien’s tricky circuit, and finishing a close 2nd when running out of petrol in The Grand Steeplechase de Paris at Auteuil over 4 miles.\n\nHe kicked off the 1975/76 season with a trip to the USA for the Colonial Cup in South Carolina where he finished 4th under Bobby Coonan, and on his return, won The Punchestown Chase from Davy Lad, which set him up nicely for the defence of his King George VI Crown at Kempton. In what was undoubtedly the finest performance of his career, Captain Christy set off in front under a young Gary Newman, and literally galloped the exhausted opposition into the ground. As the race progressed he went further and further clear, and crossed the line, looking as if he could go around again, an unbelievable 30 Lengths ahead of the 174 rated Bula, easily beating the course record.\n\nUnfortunately he developed a leg problem soon afterwards which forced the retirement of this superb chaser who was right at the peak of his powers.\n\nCaughoo: Bred by Mr P Power of Fethard-On-Sea in Co Wexford, Caughoo was Foaled in 1939. With a pedigree bereft of any National Hunt blood, I wouldn’t have thought that Vet, Herbert Mc Dowell, was entertaining thoughts of Aintree glory when paying 50 Guineas on behalf of his brother John, a Dublin jeweller, for the entry from Co Wexford, at Goff’s Ballsbridge Sales. However, as the flat bred gelding’s career developed, and particularly after he scored back to back wins in The Ulster National at Downpatrick in 1945 and 1946, the Aintree dream didn’t seem totally impossible, and the Mc Dowell brothers, (Henry, the eldest brother, trained Caughoo) entered him for the 1947 Grand National.\n\nThe Winter of 1947 was particularly harsh causing multiple cancellations of race meetings, and with gallops either frozen, snowbound, or waterlogged, keeping horses fit was especially challenging, but Henry kept their contender in excellent order, training him on nearby Sutton beach, just North of Dublin City. His 36 years old jockey, Eddie Dempsey, had ridden some decent horses in the past, Prince Regent amongst them, way back in 1941, but his career was on a very definite downward trajectory, and he was just about making ends meet as a work rider, when he got the winning ride on Caughoo in the 1946 Ulster National, cementing his association with the horse. So the duo headed for Aintree (Eddie had never been to England, let alone ridden at Aintree, and was a total unknown to British punters) hoping to belie their generous, but rather insulting odds of 100/1.\n\nThe awful weather didn’t relent, and on a cold, fogbound (visibility less than 100 yards) day, 55 runners lined up for the 1947 renewal of the great race. With nearly zero visibility, commentary was virtually impossible until Eddie and Caughoo appeared in splendid isolation over the last fence. He galloped up the long straight for a magnificent victory, with the runner up, Lough Conn, ridden by another Irishman, Daniel Mc Cann, trailing in his wake and the winning verdict of 20 Lengths looked conservative.\n\nA rather amusing sequel to the race occurred some time later when McCann ran into Eddie and accused him of pulling up Caughoo at the 12th fence on the first circuit and rejoining the race when the field came around for the second time. Well, perhaps not surprisingly, blows were exchanged, and one would have thought that was the end of the matter, but unbelievably, McCann persisted with his outrageous claim and took Eddie to law. Reassuringly, the judge gave McCanns silly accusation pretty short shrift, and quickly threw the case out. Mind you, many years later, a hard up Eddie, desperate for funds, did sell his story to a tabloid newspaper, embellishing the tale by saying that he had hidden behind a haystack on that first circuit. Alas, nobody could ever remember seeing the elusive haystack.\n\nCeltic Shot: A compact, strong, Chasing type, by the stayer Celtic Cone, (winner of The Ascot Stakes and Queen Alexandra Stakes) out of the mare, Duckdown, twice a winner over hurdles, was Foaled in January 1982, and made a winning racecourse debut at Leicester over 2miles, nearly 5 years later, in December 1986. Trained by the canny and patient Fred Winter, he was given plenty of time, and wasn’t seen again for nearly 10 months, winning a second Novices Hurdle in October 1987. The inexperienced gelding made rapid progress winning 3 of his next 4 starts and lined up for the 1988 Champion Hurdle a quietly fancied 7/1 chance. Under a great ride from Peter Scudamore, (Scu partnered him in most of his races) the son of Celtic Cone took it up at the last flight, and ran on strongly up the hill to beat the 33/1 outsider Classical Charm by 4 Lengths, and had the 5/2 Favourite, Celtic Chief, a further 3 Lengths back in third. Celtic Shot fluffed his lines 3 weeks later in Chepstow’s Welsh Champion Hurdle, coming down at the fifth flight at odds of 1/3, and connections pulled up stumps for the season.\n\nHe started the 1988/89 campaign with a win, but having lost his next 3 races was an easy to back 8/1 shot to successfully defend his Champion’s Crown. Again ridden by Scudamore, he made a mistake at the fifth, became outpaced, and despite running on strongly, had to settle for 3rd place behind the 50/1 outsider Beech Road, and the Mercy Rimell trained Celtic Chief. He gained a little compensation a few weeks later, winning a two runner Welsh Champion Hurdle at the unbackable price of 1/7.\n\nChasing was always going to be Celtic Shot’s true metier, and now in the care of Winters assistant at Uplands, Charlie Brooks, (Fred had been forced to retire through illness) he made a really promising start to his career over fences. On his first venture over the larger obstacles he ran the top class Waterloo Boy to a neck at Chepstow, and went on to win 4 of his next 7 starts, including an impressive victory in Ayr’s Future Champions Novices Chase to round off the 1989/90 campaign.\n\nHe made a terrific start to the 1990/91 season, winning in succession, three of the top pre Christmas heats in the Chasing Calendar, The Charlie Hall Chase, The Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase, and The Tommy Whittle Chase, landing the latter by 8 Lengths from the subsequent Gold Cup winner, Garrison Savannah. He finished a well beaten 4th behind Desert Orchid in The King George V1 Chase on Boxing Day but got back to winning ways next time, comfortably landing the Gold Cup Trial at Prestbury Park in January, after which he was made favourite to land Cheltenham’s Blue Riband itself. In a strongly run Gold Cup, Celtic Shot went to the front after the 16th travelling strongly, but then unfortunately got the third last wrong, injuring his pelvis in the process, and immediately weakened, to finish 7th, 22lengths behind the winner Garrison Savannah.\n\nThe 1991/92 campaign started on a positive note with a back to back win in The Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby followed by a close second to Auntie Dot in The Edward Hanmer at Haydock, but something was clearly amiss when he finished more than 73 Lengths last of six behind Carvills Hill at Chepstow.\n\nSidelined for over 2 years, he reappeared at Haydock in January 1994, but was a sad shadow of the wonderful animal he had been, finishing a distant last, 46 Lengths behind Flakey Dove, over hurdles, and only a few weeks later was pulled up in a Sandown Chase.\n\nNow 12 years old, one would have thought the Champion Hurdle Hero had earned a comfortable retirement, and the time had come to say farewell, but 355 days later, connections had him running in a humble Ludlow Hunter Chase where he finished 39L behind the winner, and 16 days later saw him ignominiously trailing around Kempton, a distance behind, before pulling up in another modest heat. A truly sad end to such a talented and genuine horse’s career!\n\nCharlottown: Meld, one of the best fillies of the 20th century, (she won the fillies Triple Crown in 1955, a feat not repeated for another 30 years when Oh So Sharp landed The 1000Guineas, The Oaks, and St Leger for Henry Cecil in 1985), produced 5 live foals at stud. The first four were a disappointment on the racecourse but in 1963 she produced a foal by the French Derby and Grand Prix de Paris winner, Charlottesville, who was to prove outstanding. Foaled at Lady Zia Wernher’s Someries Stud and named Charlottown he was sent to be trained by John “Towser”Gosden (John Gosden’s dad) at Lewes in Sussex. None of Meld’s previous offspring had been forward enough to train as two year olds but the son of Charlottesville proved an exception, and Towser had him fit and well for his racecourse debut in The Solario Stakes at Sandown, where he spread eagled a fairly mediocre field by 8 Lengths. He followed up by winning The Blackwood Hodge Stakes at Ascot, and ended the season undefeated, winning The Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury. As all three victories had been over 7 furlongs, nowhere near Charlottown’s optimum trip, and the wins at Ascot and Newbury had been more workmanlike than impressive, he finished the season rated 5lbs lower than Paddy Prendergast’s speedster, Young Emperor.\n\nFollowing Towsers premature retirement due to illness, training duties fell to Gordon Smyth, who took over Gosdens Heath House yard at Lewes. He started off Charlottown’s 3yo campaign in Lingfields’ Derby trial, where the Epsom hopeful was given a less than ideal ride by the Australian Ron Hutchinson, losing by 3 Lengths. It was a heat many felt Lady Wernher’s colt should have won, and Hutchinson was replaced by another Aussie, “Scobie” Breasley, for the colts upcoming date with destiny at Epsom. Mind you on Derby Day itself, Scobie must have been wondering what exactly that destiny might be after Charlottown trod on his own off fore, tearing off his racing plate, just as the Aussie was getting mounted before the race. The 15 minute delay that ensued, while the blacksmith replated Charlottown’s thin soled foot, wouldn’t have helped their cause, and the duos prospects weren’t looking any rosier following the first third of the race, when Scobie found himself out the back, with only 3 horses behind him. Embracing a do or die attitude, the shrewd Australian decided to take the shorter but much more precarious route down the rails to try to get into contention. This brave, but decidedly dicey decision paid off, and miraculously, having had an uninterrupted passage, the duo entered the final furlong with only the joint favourite, Pretendre in front of them. Deftly getting his courageous partner organised on the tricky camber, Breasley mounted a perfectly timed challenge and they edged past Pretendre to win by a neck.\n\nLady Wernher’s colt raced 3 more times in 1966, and each time was opposed by the sometimes brilliant, but enigmatic animal, the George Todd trained Sodium, who had finished 4th at Epsom. Sodium reversed the Derby form in the Irish Derby, beating\n\nCharlottown by a Length, but the next time they met, in The Oxfordshire Stakes at Newbury, (now The Geoffrey Freer Stakes) Charlottown got the better of the argument by\n\n13 Lengths. Their final meeting came at Doncaster in The St Leger with Sodium prevailing by a head. Charlottown only ran 3 times at 4, winning The John Porter Stakes at Newbury, and The Coronation Cup at Epsom before finishing 6th in The Grand Prix de Paris, the only poor run in his entire 10 race career. Having made little impression on the breed at stud he was exported to Australia in 1977.\n\nFootnote : Charlottown’s pedigree was certainly out of the top drawer and his owner, Lady Wernher, had one to match. Also titled, The Countess Anastasia Mikhailovna de Torby, she was Born Anastasia Mikhailovna de Torby in 1892. She was the elder daughter of His Imperial Highness, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, grandson of Tsar Nicholas1, and her mother, Countess Sophie of Merenberg, was descended from the renowned Russian Poet, Alexander Pushkin. She died in the city of London, in South Ontario in 1977.\n\nCockney Rebel: Foaled in Ireland in March 2004 he is by Val Royal, winner of The Breeders Cup Mile at Belmont Park In 2001, out of the Known Fact mare, Factice.\n\n(Beautifully bred, Factice was sold for 240,000Guineas as a yearling in 1993 but never justified her price on the racecourse. She only ran twice, her sole success coming in a modest Tipperary Maiden for trainer Dermot Weld) She hadn’t made much impression at stud either, her first 4 offspring managing just 7 wins all at a low level, between them, when the Cockney born business man, and keen greyhound aficionado, Phil Cunningham paid £30,000 for her fifth, in 1995.\n\nSent to Newmarket handler Geoff Huffer, the son of Val Royal made his racecourse debut a winning one in a 6f 2yo Maiden on The July Course. He could only manage second in a valuable Sales Race at York 5 weeks later, (2nd place prize money was over £65,000) and then rounded off his 2yo campaign finishing a very promising 3rd\n\nIn York’s Group2 Champagne Stakes, and earning a very respectable rating of 115.\n\nHaving won first time up at two, connections elected to go straight to\n\nThe 2000 Guineas, and with top French Pilot Olivier Peslier booked to do the steering, Cockney Rebel lined up on The Rowley Mile a generous looking 25/1 chance for a very open first Classic of the year. Drawn towards the middle of the 24 runner field, Peslier switched to race stand side after a furlong. Keeping a tight hold of the strongly travelling colt, the Frenchman timed his challenge to perfection inside the final furlong, and went clear to win by 1 1/2Lengths from Vital Equine, with Dutch Art 3/4Length back in third. It was a terrific performance by the relatively unsung colt, and it looked even better when the time transpired to be the fastest for 12 years, and was more than 2 seconds faster than the mighty Frankel recorded four years later.\n\nThree weeks later, again partnered by the brilliant Peslier, he started at odds of 6/4 to become only the 6th horse to bring off the English and Irish 2000 Guineas double. He did so comfortably beating the Jim Bolger trained Creachadoir and had the New Market runner up, Vital Equine 3 1/4 Lengths back in 6th.\n\nIt looked all systems go for The St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot 24 days later where he started the even money favourite, but hanging badly he could only finish 5th, and was retired to stud.\n\nComedy Of Errors (1967-1990): Whatever else a mating of a King’s Stand Stakes victor, with the winner of Scotland’s oldest race, The Lanark Silver Bell, (endowed by King William the Lion 1165-1214) was likely to produce, a dual Champion Hurdler wouldn’t have been anywhere near the top of most breeders predictions, but that indeed was the result of the covering of the Kingsway (won the 1943 2000 Guineas) mare, Comedy Actress, by the stallion Goldhill, winner of the 5 furlongs, King’s Stand Stakes (1965)\n\nBred for the flat, Comedy Of Errors had developed into a useful middle distance performer for the Shropshire handler Tom Corrie when the big (over 17 hands) gelding caught the eye of Fred Rimell who bought the 4yo for £12,000 on behalf of a new patron, Ted Wheatley, the wealthy boss of Allied Carpets. The new inmate of the Kinnersley yard made an immediate impression over timber winning on his debut under Ken Whyte, and hopes were high that the big gelding would land the first division of The Gloucestershire Hurdle, (now The Supreme Novices) at the 1972 Cheltenham Festival. Ignoring Fred’s instructions to hold onto the inexperienced Comedy Of Errors until after the last, stable jockey, Terry Biddlecombe, kicked for home far too soon, and was collared on the line, inviting the ire of the normally placid trainer, and costing Terry any future association with the horse, who went on to win 3 more races before the end of his first season.\n\nThe first time Comedy Of Errors crossed swords with the 1971 and 1972 Champion Hurdler, Bula, was the 1973 Cheltenham Trial Hurdle, (now The Bula Hurdle) where Fred Winters charge was the clear winner, the Kinnersley runner finishing a distant third. However, on their 3 subsequent meetings the younger horse finished in front. He was runner up to Captain Christy in The Sweeps Hurdle where Bula finished 4th, and then won The Champion Hurdle in fine style from Easby Abbey, with Bula back in 3rd, before again comprehensively beating Bula, conceding 6 lbs, in The Welsh Champion Hurdle at Chepstow, his last race of the season.\n\nFollowing impressive victories in The Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, The Cheltenham Trial Hurdle, and The Sweeps Hurdle at Leopardstown the apple of Fred Rimells eye, started a red hot favourite for the 1974 Champion Hurdle. In a race where the front running Lanzarote was given an easy time of it up front, Bill Smith seemed to give the favourite an awful lot to do and unable to make up the leeway was beaten by 3 Lengths. Post race, connections were furious, and the unfortunate Smith lost his plum job at Kinnersley. In fairness to Smith, who maintained that his mount wasn’t right on the day, and insisted that a Comedy Of Errors on the top of his game, would have easily got past Lanzarote, a claim borne out by a superb 6 race unbeaten campaign the following season, which included three wins over the Winter horse.\n\nThat 1974/75 campaign saw Comedy Of Errors register a third victory in The Fighting Fifth at Newcastle, land a second Cheltenham Hurdle Trial, followed by easily winning The Sweeps Hurdle, and Wolverhampton’s Champion Hurdle Trial. He then carved his own niche in the record books becoming the first horse ever to win back his Champion’s Hurdle Crown, and rounded off a fantastic season with an impressive win in Scotland’s Champion Hurdle.\n\nRising nine, and getting old for a Hurdler, the 1975/76 season sa"
