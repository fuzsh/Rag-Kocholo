        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe sport of kings, as horse racing is often called, is one of the oldest and most universal spectator sports. It is called the sport of kings because the ownership of horses was traditionally limited to the wealthiest members of society—royalty and nobility. Modern racing was established in England by King Charles II, who was an ardent patron of the sport throughout his reign.\n\nThe earliest written manual on the care, feeding, and training of horses dates from about 1500 bc in Asia Minor. There is a full description of a chariot race in Homer’s Iliad, which is dated about the 9th or 8th century bc. Both chariot and bareback (mounted) horse races were held at the Olympic Games from 740 to 700 bc. The type of race called the steeplechase dates back at least to the 5th century bc.\n\nWagering, or betting, has always played a major role in racing. Today’s wagering takes two forms: bookmaking and pari-mutuel betting. Bookmaking is a gambling practice of determining odds and receiving and paying off bets. The practice is legal in England and illegal in the United States, except for a few states. Pari-mutuel betting was introduced in France by businessman Pierre Oller about 1870. Most such betting takes place at tracks, though some places have off-track betting. Players buy tickets on the horses they back, and winners receive payoffs from a pool of all bets. Modern pari-mutuel betting uses computers or other devices called totalizers. These calculate the betting pools and the odds on each horse.\n\nToday there are four kinds of horse races. These races are Thoroughbred horse racing, quarter-horse racing, harness racing, and the steeplechase. They are distinguished by the types of horses, the equipment, the way the races are run, and the terrain on which they are run.\n\nThoroughbred Racing\n\nA Thoroughbred race is run on a flat course, either of grass, or turf, or dirt. In England races are run exclusively on grass. In the United States, oval shaped dirt tracks predominate, most commonly 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) in circumference, but in other countries tracks may be irregular in shape. England’s Ascot course is a rounded triangle. Many American tracks have a grass oval inside the outer dirt track.\n\nThoroughbred racing includes such world-famous events as the Belmont Stakes, which began in 1867, the Kentucky Derby (1875), and the Preakness Stakes (1873) in the United States (collectively called the Triple Crown); England’s Gold Cup at the Royal Ascot (1807) and the Derby at Epsom Downs (1780); and the French Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe (1920).\n\nThe race gets its name from the kind of horse used. The Thoroughbred is a breed of horse developed in England for racing and jumping. Although the origin of the breed may be traced back to stocks of Arab and Barb horses brought to England in about the 3rd century, the immediate source according to tradition (in the female line) was 43 or more mares imported early in the 17th century.\n\nIn the male line, modern Thoroughbreds trace their ancestry to only three stallions: the Byerly Turk, the Darley Arabian, and the Godolphin Barb—all of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. By coincidence, the male line of each of these three survives through single male descendants: Matchem (1748–81), King Herod (1758–80), and Eclipse (1764–89). Today the descendants of Eclipse make up the vast majority of Thoroughbreds.\n\nThoroughbreds have slim bodies, delicate heads, broad chests, and short backs. They average 64 inches (163 centimeters) in height (measured as 16 hands for horses) and weigh about 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms). Apart from racing, Thoroughbreds may be used for hunting, polo, and riding. They are registered in The General Stud Book of the English Jockey Club (organized about 1750) and in the studbooks of clubs in other countries.\n\nThe earliest races in England were match contests between two, or at most three, horses. Pressure by the public eventually produced events with larger fields of runners. The early races were 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) heats, with two heats needed for a win. A rider’s skill and judgment were not so vital in gaining a victory. But as dash, or one-heat, racing became the rule, the rider’s ability to gain a few feet became vital.\n\nThe length of a course varies, depending on the specific race and on the custom of the country in which it is run. The Royal Ascot Gold Cup race is over a 21/2-mile (4-kilometer) course, while some of the other classic races run at Ascot are only 11/2 miles (2.4 kilometers). The most common distance for American races became 3/4 mile (1.2 kilometers). Races in the United States are dominated by the commercial aspect of the sport. Hence, it is the speed of the horse that is emphasized. In England, speed and stamina are both considered significant.\n\nIn Thoroughbred racing the term handicap is used to signify the adjustment of the weight the horse carries in relation to its age and sex. A 2-year-old horse may begin racing in the spring with a greater weight allowance that may progressively drop as the season advances. Sex allowances are from 3 to 5 pounds (1.4 to 2.3 kilograms) less for female horses than for males. Weight penalties or allowances may also be adjusted on the basis of a horse’s past performance. Handicapping seeks to give all the horses racing an equal chance of winning.\n\nAlthough Thoroughbreds reach their peak racing ability at age 5, 3 years is generally considered the classic racing age. Larger purses have increased stake fees (fees charged owners who wish to race their horses). This fact plus the money to be made through breeding fees and the sale of horses have combined to diminish the number of races available for horses beyond the age of 4. There are, however, some notable exceptions to this trend. Among them are the Sydney Cup in Australia, the Queen Elizabeth Stakes in England, the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Emperor’s Cup in Japan.\n\nThe race procedure begins when the jockeys, as the riders are called, weigh in and report to the paddock for instructions from the trainers. (The paddock is the section at the track where horses are saddled.) An official is present to verify the identity of the horses. After the jockeys mount, they parade the horses past the stewards for inspection.\n\nWhen the race is to start, the horses are led to the starting gate, which is electrically operated at most tracks. As the race is being run, the stewards and patrol judges, aided by a motion-picture patrol, look for rule violations. The finish is photographed by a special camera, and if the race is very close the film must be developed before final results are announced. In North America, horses are timed to the nearest one fifth of a second, while in most countries they are timed to the nearest one hundredth of a second.\n\nThe result of the race is not official, however, until the jockeys weigh in and the horses are checked for carrying the proper weight. Rule infractions claimed by jockeys must be examined by the judges. Saliva and urine samples are taken from the horses to detect prohibited substances. Winning horses have been disqualified for having been injected with drugs.\n\nThe governance of racing varies from nation to nation. In England the Jockey Club is the regulatory agency for long-term policy. Overall control of the sport is in the hands of the Joint Racing Board, composed of members of the Jockey Club and members of the Horserace Betting Levy Board appointed by the government. In the United States the sport is regulated by state racing commissions. In a few other nations the government owns the tracks and horses.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes\n\nThe Kentucky Derby\n\nThe Preakness Stakes\n\nTriple Crown champions-U.S.\n\nThe St. Leger\n\nEpsom Derby\n\n2,000 Guineas (1900-present)\n\nTriple Crown champions-British\n\nMelbourne Cup"
