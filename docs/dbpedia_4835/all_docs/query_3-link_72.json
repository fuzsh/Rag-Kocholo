        "text": "Although polished metal mirrors have been used since antiquity, it was not until the early 1800s in Germany that mass production of silvered glass mirrors came into being.\n\nScientist Justus vol Liebig (1803-1873) experimented with a wet deposition process which left a thin layer of metallic silver on panes of glass through the chemical reduction of silver nitrate. This eliminated the use of dangerous mercury coating used in such places as the Hall of Mirrors at Louis XIV’s palace of Versailles. [Read more…] about The Irona Glass Company of Clinton County, NY\n\nOn June 18, 1812, Congress passed and President James Madison signed a declaration of war against Great Britain, marking the beginning of the War of 1812. Frustrated by Britain’s maritime practices and support of Native American resistance to western expansion, the U.S. entered the war with ambitious plans to conquer Canada, a goal that was never realized. [Read more…] about June 18, 1812: War of 1812 Begins When US Declares War On Great Britain\n\nConstructed in 1934, the Chateaugay Fish Hatchery is the northernmost New York State fish hatchery, situated in the Northern Adirondacks near the Village of Chateaugay. The hatchery originated in 1924 as a field station near Boardman Brook; however, due to an unreliable water source, it moved to its existing location along the Marble River. [Read more…] about The Chateaugay Fish Hatchery\n\nNew York State Governor Kathy Hochul recently announced what she called the largest state investment in renewable energy in United States history.\n\nThe conditional awards include three offshore wind and 22 land-based renewable energy projects totaling 6.4 gigawatts of clean energy, enough to power 2.6 million New York homes and deliver approximately 12 percent of New York’s electricity needs once completed. [Read more…] about New York State Makes Large Investment in Renewable Energy\n\nThe geology of Clinton County has shaped the county’s history in complex ways. There are five major geologic rock types in the county, each mined for its beauty and strength. You can see them in the buildings. [Read more…] about The Geology of Clinton County and History\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics have ended, and as usual, they were quite the spectacle. Folks in the Adirondacks and North Country are perhaps bigger fans of the Winter Olympics, for obvious reasons: the games have been held twice at Lake Placid, and a number of area natives have attained lifelong dreams by earning a place on the podium. But a man born in this region achieved summer Olympic glory long ago, one of many highlights in a very accomplished life.\n\nKarl Telford Frederick was born in 1881 in Chateaugay (northern Franklin County), where his father was a Presbyterian minister, which required a somewhat nomadic existence (five relocations in 14 years). Before Karl was three, the family moved to Essex on Lake Champlain, remaining there until 1888—not a long time, but sufficient to establish a lasting connection between him and the Adirondacks. [Read more…] about Chateaugay Olympian Karl Frederick: Literally A Shooting Star\n\nA recent lecture I delivered on Prohibition in the North Country allowed me a closeup look at what community activists can accomplish. Among the historic buildings in many towns of northern New York are theaters that were once the center of social life. Many of these old structures have been refurbished as part of city or village revitalization programs. Reclaiming and reviving them is costly, requiring the efforts of dedicated, thoughtful, and energetic folks, mostly volunteers. Just as important is the work that follows—utilizing the facilities as self-sustaining ventures while bringing a community together. [Read more…] about Chateaugay’s Historic Town Hall Theater"
