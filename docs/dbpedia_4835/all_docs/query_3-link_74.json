        "text": "Franklin County is named for founding father Benjamin Franklin. Malone is the county seat and located just minutes south of the Canadian Border. Much of the county is within the Adirondack Park.\n\nFamed as the childhood home of Almanzo Wilder - immortalized in his wife Laura Ingalls Wilder's celebrated children's classic - Farmer Boy.\n\nMain Industries: The earliest industry in the county was potash production. Other early industries included agriculture, especially the raising of hops (mainly used to brew beer) and potatoes, mills, and iron ore mining. The southern portion of the county benefited from the founding of sanatoriums for the treatment of tuberculosis and other ailments, based on the work of Dr. E.L. Trudeau. The Adirondacks, which were once a barrier to settlement, began to serve as a draw for tourists in the late 19th century, and now serve as one of Franklin County's defining features.\n\nEducation: Franklin County is home to North Country Community College and Paul Smith's College. North Country Community College is sponsored by and serves Franklin and Essex counties, with campuses in Malone, Saranac Lake & Ticonderoga.\n\nLand: The County is home to more than 670 bodies of water offering unparalleled year-round outdoor recreation. Paddle historic Adirondack canoe routes, part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, or New York State's only designated wilderness canoe area - the St. Regis Canoe Area."
