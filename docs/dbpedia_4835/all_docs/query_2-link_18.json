        "text": "Details\n\nPedigree\n\nScots Cavalier's sire is none other than the great Cavalier Royale, a leading sire of showjumpers and eventers. Cavalier Royale has sired numerous showjumpers competing at international level including the Olympics and World Cup Finals. He has also sired numerous International eventers making him the leading sire of eventers in the USA. His sire Cor de la Bryere is one of the all time great sires of showjumpers. Scots Cavalier is out of the Irish thoroughbred mare Lay in the Hay xx. This mare has already produced showjumpers up to Grade B level in Ireland. She is by the great Henbit xx, Derby winner in Ireland and an important sire of eventers. His sire Hawaii xx is also known as a sire of International eventers. Lay in the Hay xx's mother, Roll in the Hay xx is a half sister to Forties Field xx sire of several advanced eventers including the international eventer Nickaree.\n\nLooking at Scots Cavalier's pedigree we find duplications of famous showjumping progenitors: St Simon xx, widely acknowledged as the foundation stallion for thoroughbred jumpers appears an incredible 104 times. Bay Ronald xx a leading sire of showjumpers and eventers and foundation sire in Germany appears 24 times. Others include: Achill (17), Bay Ronald xx (24), Bull Dog xx (2), Court Martial xx (2), Dark Ronald xx (11), Fair Play xx (7), Fair Trial xx (2), Fling (2), Heidelberg (5), Hurry On xx (4), Hyperion xx (4), Lorbeer (6), Loretto (3), Nearco xx (2), Phalaris xx (7), Rock Sand xx (14), Son In Law xx (8) St. Simon xx (104), Teddy xx (6), The Tetrarch xx (10) and War Relic xx (2). In Scots Cavalier's pedigree we find the same powerful bloodline crosses that have been responsible for producing the top fifty jumping horses in the world. They demonstrate a powerful influence in the pedigrees of the top showjumpers in the world. Namely: Ladykiller xx X Cor de la Bryere X Cottage Son xx This cross produced the International showjumpers, Waterford Crystal, Montender, Collin, Constantin, Eurocommerce Monaco, Check Mate, Abrisca, Countess G and Le Patron. He also has the same cross present of the three leading Thoroughbred lines found in the top fifty jumpers in the world. Namely: Ladykiller xx X Rantzau xx X Furioso xx this cross produced the International showjumpers Russel and Goldika 559.\n\nLadykiller xx X Rantzau xx X Cottage Son xx this cross produced the International showjumpers Countess G and Eurocommerce Monaco. Other influential sires found in his pedigree include; Ramzes x, Ladykiller xx, Anblick xx, Blue Peter xx, Cottage Son xx, Eight Thirty xx, Furioso xx, Grey Sovereign xx, Man O War xx, Nasrullah xx, Pharos xx, Pilate xx, Precipation xx, Rantzau xx, Sailing Light xx and Swaps xx, all sires that have produced international showjumpers.\n\nScots Cavalier is from Thoroughbred family number one. This is the same family as the great Furioso xx, one of the most influential sires of showjumpers that the world has known. Other famous stallions from the same family who are know to produce top showjumpers are are Phalaris xx, Princequillo xx, Turn To xx and Court Martial xx.\n\nPerformance\n\nHe is one of only a few graded stallion by Cavalier Royale in the world and the first to be graded with the Scottish Sport Horse Studbook. At his grading the Dutch judges commented that he had a very good jumping technique. He is registered BSJA and will compete in showjumping classes this year. He is a stunning looker, has an outstanding temperament, is easy to ride with three very good paces and a super athletic jump.\n\nOwners recommendations\n\nScots Cavalier is is nearly three-quarters thoroughbred and will be an ideal sire for breeding a showjumper or eventer of quality. He will cross well with a wide variety of mares, but will suit mares that need some quality / blood, or thoroughbred mares lacking in bone, also mares that could improve on their jumping ability."
