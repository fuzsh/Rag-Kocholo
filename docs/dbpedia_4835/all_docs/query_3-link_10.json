        "text": "Father De Pauw sends McMaster a copy of \"Courrier de Bruxelles\" thinking it may interest him. In this copy is the translation of an article from the Cincinnati Warheits' Freund, which mentions a letter sent from the Propaganda to the Bishops of America concerning public schools. The letter is not published, but when Bishop, Edgar P. Wadhams, left for Rome, he was given the letter. For some time De Pauw has been keeping a respectable distance from the Bishop and so has not asked to see the letter, but in his opinion it will remain a dead letter. What they need, he believes, and as he told Cardinal De Luca is a Nuncio or a Papal delegate of the ability of Monsignor Conroy but the hierarchy would oppose his oppointment. Father De Pauw will try and find as many subscribers as he can for the Freeman's Journal among his poor farmer congregation. :: I-2-b A.L.S. 2pp. 12mo."
