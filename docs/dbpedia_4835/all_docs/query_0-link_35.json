The language is plain Saxon language, from which 'the men on the wall' can easily gather what it most concerns them to know.\n\n\"Again, the range of thought is not high and difficult, but level and easy for the wayfaring man to follow. It is quite evident that the author's mind was able and cultivated; yet, as a teacher to men of low estate, he makes no display of eloquence or argument.\n\n\"In the statements of Christian doctrine, the reality of Mr. Blencowe's mind is very striking. There is a strength and a warmth and a life in his mention of the great truths of the Gospel, which show that he spoke from the heart, and that, like the Apostle of old, he could say,—'I believe, and therefore have I spoken.'\n\n\"His affectionateness too is no less conspicuous; this is shown in the gentle, earnest, kind-hearted tone of every Sermon in the book. There is no scolding, no asperity of language, not irritation of manner about them. At the same time there is no over-strained tenderness, nor affectation of endearment; but there is a considerate, serious concern about the peculiar sins and temptations of the people committed to his charge, and a hearty desire and determined effort for their salvation.\"—Theologian.\n\n\"Simple, intelligible, and affectionate.\"—Church and State Gazette.\n\n\"Very stirring and practical.\"—Christian Remembrancer.\n\nSERMONS ON THE DOCTRINES and the MEANS OF GRACE, and on the SEVEN WORDS FROM THE CROSS.

I trust that its columns may be open to one more attempt to rescue from abuse the word which stands at the head of this article.\n\nIts signification, whether sought from Latin usage and etymology, or from the works of English mathematicians, is \"to turn out of doors,\" \"to oust,\" or, as we say in the midland counties, \"to get shut of.\" In French it may be rendered as well by se défaire as by éliminer. Within the last seven or eight years, however, this valuable spoil of dead Latinity has been strangely perverted, and, through the ignorance or carelessness of writers, it has bidden fair to take to itself two significations utterly distinct from its derivation, viz. to \"elicit,\" and to \"evaluate.\" The former signification, if less vicious, is more commonly used than the latter. I append examples of both from three of the most elegant writers of the day. In the third extract the word under consideration is used in the latter sense; in the other extracts it carries the former.\n\nLectures on the Philosophical Tendencies of the Age, by J. D. Morrell, London, 1848, p. 41.:\n\n\"Had the men of ancient times, when they peopled the universe with deities, a deeper perception of the religious element in the mind, than had Newton, when having eliminated the great law of the natural creation, his enraptured soul burst forth into the infinite and adored?\"\n\nI take one more illustration (among many others) from pp. 145, 146. of this work:\n\n\"It would not be strictly speaking correct to call them philosophical methods, because a philosophical method only exists when any tendency works itself clear, and gives rise to a formal, connected, and logical system of rules, by which we are to proceed in the elimination of truth.\"\n\nThe Eclipse of Faith, by Professor Rogers, London, 1852, p. 392.:\n\n\"They are now at college, and have imbibed in different degrees that curious theory which professedly recognises Christianity (as consigned to the New Testament) as a truly divine revelation, yet asserts that it is intermingled with a large amount of error and absurdity, and tells each man to eliminate the divine 'element' for himself. According to this theory, the problem of eliciting revealed truth may be said to be indeterminate, the value of the unknown varies through all degrees of magnitude; it is equal to any thing, equal to every thing, equal to nothing, equal to infinity.\"\n\nTheological Essays, by F. D. Maurice, Cambridge, 1853, p. 89.:\n\n\"Let us look, therefore, courageously at the popular dogma, that there are certain great ideas floating in the vast ocean of traditions which the old world exhibits to us, that the gospel appropriated some of these, and that we are to detect them and eliminate them from its own traditions.\"\n\nBut for the fact that such writers have given the weight of their names to so unparalleled a blunder, it would seem almost childish to occupy the columns of a literary periodical with exposing it. It is, however, somewhat singular that it should be principally men of classical attainments who perpetrate it. In my under-graduate days at Cambridge, the proneness of \"classical men\" to commit the blunder in question was proverbial.\n\nIn conclusion, then, let it be remembered that the word \"eliminate\" obtained general currency from the circumstance of its being originally admitted into mathematical works. In such works elimination signifies the process of causing a function to disappear from an equation, the solution of which would be embarrassed by its presence there. In other writings the word \"elimination\" has but one correct signification, viz. \"the extrusion of that which is superfluous or irrelevant.\" As an example of this legitimate use of the word, I will quote from Sir William Hamilton's accurate, witty, and learned article on \"Logic,\" published in the Edinburgh Review, April, 1833:\n\n\"The preparatory step of the discussion was, therefore, an elimination of these less precise and appropriate significations, which, as they could at best only afford a remote genus and difference, were wholly incompetent for the purpose of a definition.\"\n\nC. Mansfield Ingleby.\n\nBirmingham.\n\nCRANMER'S BIBLE.\n\nQueries which I have heard at various times lead me to think that a Note on this interesting volume may be acceptable to many readers who possess or have access to it; and especially to those whose copies may be (as too many are) imperfect at the beginning and end. Under this impression I send you an extract from the late Mr. Lea Wilson's catalogue of his unrivalled Collection of English Bibles. As very few copies of this curious and beautiful work were printed, and not one, I believe, has been sold, it is probable that few of your readers are aware of the criteria which that gentleman's ingenuity and industry have furnished for distinguishing between the {120}various editions which are known under the title of The Great Bible, or Cranmer's Bible. He begins his description of the edition of April, 1539, thus:\n\n\"As this volume is commonly called the First Edition of Cranmer's or the Great Bible, I class it with the Six following; although in fact the Archbishop had nothing whatever to do with either the translation or publication. It was put forth entirely by Thomas Lord Cromwell, vide Herbert's Ames, p. 1550. vol. iii., who employed Coverdale to revise the existing translations. The first wherein Cranmer took any part is the large folio of April 1540, the text of which differs from this edition materially. The pages of this volume and of the four next following begin and end alike; and the general appearance of the whole five is so very similar that at first sight, one may be mistaken for another by those ignorant of the fact that they are all separate and distinct impressions: the whole of the titles, of which there are five in each Book, and every leaf of kalendar, prologue, text, and tables being entirely recomposed, and varying throughout in orthography, &c. The desire to make perfect copies out of several imperfect, has also caused extreme confusion, by uniting portions of different editions without due regard to their identity. These remarks apply equally to the editions of Nov. 1540, and Nov. 1541, of which, in like manner, each page begins and ends with the same words. Although the distinctive marks are very numerous, yet being chiefly typographical ornaments or arrangement, it is impossible to give here sufficient guides to ensure the integrity of each volume.\"—Page 12.\n\nOn the next page but one is added:\n\n\"The following lines of the forty-first chapter of Job differ in composition in all the seven volumes, and for the purpose of distinguishing the edition I have given them to each.\"\n\nNo. 1.

All\n\nI believe the foregoing to be an exact copy of Mr. Wilson's catalogue, but, of course, I cannot be responsible for the accuracy of his transcripts. Perhaps none but those who were admitted to his library ever had an opportunity of comparing together all those editions; and nobody would have done it with more care and fidelity than himself.\n\nS. R. M.\n\nSOVEREIGNS DINING AND SUPPING IN PUBLIC.\n\nIn some observations which I made upon two or three pictures in Hampton Court Palace, in Vol. viii., p. 538., I specified two worthy of notice on the above subject, and which are the first instances of such ceremony I have met with. It has been supposed to have been a foreign custom but I do not find any traces of it upon record. {121}One can easily imagine that the fastueux Louis XIV. would have no objection to such display, and that his mistresses, as well as queen, would be of the party, when we read, that in the royal progresses two of the former were scandalously paraded in the same carriage with his queen. To this immoral exhibition, indeed, public opinion seemed to give no check, as we read, that \"les peuples accouraient 'pour voir,' disaient-ils, 'les trois reines,'\" wherever they appeared together. Of these three queens, the true one was Marie-Thérèse: the two others were La Marquise de Montespan and Mme. de la Vallière. But to return to my subject. I find by the London Gazette, No. 6091. of Sept. 4, 1722, that Geo. I., in his progress to the west of England, supped in public at the Bishop's (Dr. Richard Willis) palace at Salisbury on Wednesday, Aug. 29, 1722; and slept there that night.\n\nThe papers of the period of George II. say:\n\n\"There was such a resort to Hampton Court on Sunday, July 14, 1728, to see their Majesties dine, that the rail surrounding the table broke; and causing some to fall, made a terrible scramble for hats, &c., at which their Majesties laughed heartily.\"\n\nAnd,—\n\n\"On Thursday, the 25th of the same month, it is stated, the concourse to see their Majesties dine in public at Hampton Court was exceedingly great. A gang of robbers (the swell-mob of that day?) had mixed themselves among the nobility and gentry; several gold watches being lost, besides the ladies' gown tails and laced lappets cut off in number.\"\n\nAnd again:\n\n\"On Sunday, 15th September, 1728, their Majesties dined together in public at Windsor (as they will continue to do every Sunday and Thursday during their stay there), when all the country people, whether in or out of mourning, were permitted to see them.\"\n\nBesides those three occasions of George II. and Queen Caroline dining in public, we have another recorded attended with some peculiar circumstances, as mentioned in the London Gazette, No. 7623. of Tuesday, Aug. 2, 1737:\n\n\"The 31st ult. being Sunday, their Majesties, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Princesses Amelia and Caroline, went to chapel at Hampton Court, and heard a sermon preached by the Rev. Dr. Blomer. Their Majesties, and the rest of the royal family, dined afterwards in public as usual before a great number of spectators. About seven o'clock that evening, the Princess of Wales was taken with some slight symptoms of approaching labour, and was removed to St. James's; where, a little after eleven, she was delivered of a princess.\"\n\nThis was the Princess Augusta, who was married to the Prince of Brunswick Wolfenbüttel.\n\nΦ.\n\nRichmond.\n\nPARALLEL IDEAS FROM POETS.\n\nLongfellow and Tennyson:\n\nWordsworth and Keble:\n\nMoore and Keble:\n\nNorris Deck.\n\nCambridge.\n\nTHE GREAT ALPHABETIC PSALM, AND THE SONGS OF DEGREES.\n\nIn attempting to discover a reason for the division of Psalm cxix. into twenty-two portions of eight verses each, instead of seven or ten, the more favourite numbers of the Hebrew, I have thought that, as the whole Psalm is chiefly laudatory of the Thorah, or Law of Moses, and was written alphabetically for the instruction mainly of the younger people, to be by them committed to memory, a {122}didactic reason might exist for making up the total number of 176 verses, peculiar to this Psalm. Adverting then to the necessity, for the purposes of Jewish worship, of ascertaining the periods of the new moons, to adjust the year thereby, I find that a mean lunation, as determined by the latest authorities, is very nearly 29.5306 days (29d. 12h. 44m.) and as the Jewish months were lunar, six of these would amount to 177d. 4h. 24m., being somewhat more than one over the number of verses in this Psalm. As lunations, from observation, vary from 29d. 7h. 32m. to 29d. 18h. 50m., the above was a very close approximation to the half-year. The other half of the year would vary a whole lunation (Veadar) betwixt the ordinary and the intercalary year. This was, at least, the best possible combination of twenty-two letters for such purpose. This Psalm might then have answered some of the purposes of an almanac. It is a very important one in fixing the Hebrew metres, the initial letter being the same for every eight verses in succession.\n\nThe words at the commencement of Psalms cxx. to cxxxiv., rendered \"Song of Degrees,\" appear to me to signify rather \"song of ascents,\" in reference to the Jewish practice of ascending to the house-top to watch and pray, as well as to sleep. If it be assumed that these fifteen Psalms were appropriated for domestic use on the Jew retiring, by ascending the ladder or stairs, to the upper part or top of the house (Ps. cxxxii. 3.), the meaning of several passages will be better apprehended, I conceive, than by supposing that they were composed solely for temple use, or, as Eichhorn thinks, to be sung on a journey. Standing on the house-top, the praying Jew, like David and Solomon, would have in view heaven and earth (cxxi. 2., cxxiii 1.), the sun and moon (cxxi. 6.), the surrounding hills (cxxi. 1.) and mountains (cxxv. 2.), the gates and city of Jerusalem (cxxii. 2. 3. 7.), Mount Zion (cxxv. 1.), the watchmen on the walls (cxxvii. 1., cxxx. 6.), his wife and children at home (cxxviii. 3., cxxxi. 2.), the mover bringing in his sheaves, compared with the grass on the house-tops (cxxix. 6-8.), all subjects especially noted in these fifteen Psalms. The number eight appears to be a favourite one in these, as well as in Psalm cxix., but there is no reason to believe that such number refers to the octave in music. It may refer, however, to the number of stairs or steps of ascent. I am not aware that the above views have been previously taken, which is my reason for calling attention to this interesting and well-debated subject.\n\nT. J.

Brent.\n\nQueries.\n\nCORONATION STONE.\n\nA few years ago the following tradition was related to me by a friend, and I should be glad if any of your correspondents can inform me whether it is current in any part of Great Britain or Ireland, and whether there are any grounds for it. As it is connected with one of our most interesting national relics, the coronation stone, it may not prove beneath notice; and I here give it in full, shielding myself with the Last Minstrel's excuse:\n\nI must allow that its extreme vagueness, if not improbability, hardly warrants an inquiry; but having failed in obtaining any satisfactory proofs among my own friends, as a last resource I apply myself to the columns of your well-known and useful journal.\n\nWhen Jacob awoke after his wonderful dream, as related in Genesis (chap. xxviii.), he said, \"Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not;\" and he was afraid, and said, \"How dreadful is this place. This is none other but the house of God; and this is the gate of heaven.\" He \"took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.\"\n\nThat stone (so runs the legend) is supposed to have been taken away from Bethel by the House of Joseph, when they destroyed the city and its inhabitants (Judges i.); and a tradition, that whosoever possessed that stone would be especially blessed, and be king or chief, was current among the Jews; the stone itself being guarded by them with jealous care.\n\nOn the first destruction of Jerusalem, some of the royal family of Judah are supposed to have escaped, and to have gone in search of an asylum beyond the sea, taking this precious stone with them. Their resting-place was Ireland, where they founded a kingdom. Many centuries afterwards, a brother of the king descended from these exiles, named Fergus, went, with his brother's permission, to found a kingdom in Scotland. He said, however, he would not go without the sacred stone. This his brother refused to give him; but Fergus stole it, and established a kingdom in Scotland. His descendants became kings of all Scotland, and were crowned sitting on that stone, {124}which was taken away by Edward I., and is now in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThese are the outlines of this tradition. My object now is to ask whether any of your correspondents can inform me, first, Whether the Jews had, or have, any like superstition concerning Jacob's pillar; and whether the royal family of Judah possessed such a stone among their treasures? Secondly, Whether any Jews are supposed to have settled in Ireland at so early a period; and whether (that being the case) there are now, or were once, proofs of their having done so, either in the Irish language or in any of the ancient laws, customs, buildings, &c. of the country? Thirdly, Whether the Scotch believe that stone to have come from Ireland; and whether that belief in the owner of it being king existed in Scotland? and, lastly, Can any of your correspondents, learned in geology, inform me whether the like kind of stone is to be met with in any part of the British Isles? or whether, as the legend runs, a similar kind of stone is found in the Arabian plains? The story has interested me greatly; and if I could gain any enlightenment on the subject, I should be much obliged for it.\n\nAn Indian Subscriber.\n\nOLD MEREWORTH CASTLE, KENT.\n\nAmong your subscribers there are doubtless many collectors of topographical drawings and engravings. I shall feel specially obliged if any of them could find in their collections a view of old Mereworth Castle (as it stood prior to the comparatively modern erection of Lord Westmoreland), and furnish me with a long desiderated description of it. Local tradition represents it as having been a baronial castle rising from the middle of a small lake, like that of Leeds, though of smaller dimensions, with the parish church attached. I should rather conjecture it to have been an ancient moated manor-house, magnified, in the course of tradition, into a baronial castle and lake.\n\nWhatever the old building was, it was pulled down by John, seventh Earl of Westmoreland, during the first half of the last century. Had it been of the character of Leeds Castle, as the representative of a long line of baronial ancestry, he would hardly have levelled such a structure, with all its inspiring associations, merely for the purpose of gratifying his passion for Palladian architecture by the erection of the present mansion.\n\nThe ancient building seems to have been the residence of the knightly family of De Mereworth during the twelfth, thirteenth, and part of the fourteenth centuries, and from that time, till near the end of Elizabeth's reign, it ceased to be a family residence; for, after passing through various hands (none of whom were likely to have resided there), it descended in 1415 to Joan, wife of the Lord Burgavenny, sister and coheir to the Earl of Arundel. The Burgavennys of that day resided always at their castle of Birling, which circumstance would intimate that it was a grander and more baronial residence than Mereworth Castle (for they had come into possession of both estates very nearly at the same period); and afterwards Mereworth by settlement passed to Sir Thomas Fane of Badsell, in marriage with Mary, daughter and sole heiress of Henry Lord Burgavenny, and \"jure suo\" Baroness Despencer, in 1574. From that time till its dismantling in the last century, Mereworth Castle was again a family residence, the seat of the Earls of Westmoreland; Francis, eldest son of said Sir Thomas {125}Fane and Mary Baroness Despencer, having been advanced to that earldom. As the seat of a noble family for more than a century and a half, it is hardly likely that no view should have been taken of it; I have searched, however, in vain for it in Harris, Buck, and other published collections.\n\nIt would be a matter of special interest to many besides myself, to obtain some information respecting it.\n\nJohn, seventh earl, the builder of the present Palladian mansion, died in 1762, when the earldom passed to a distant cousin, and the barony of Despencer was called out of abeyance in favour of Sir Francis Dashwood, the son and representative of Mary, sister and eldest co-heir of John, seventh Earl of Westmoreland, and heir to his estates. On his death s.p., Sir Thomas Stapleton, sole heir to the Barony of Despencer (as lineal descendant and heir of Catherine, the younger sister and co-heir of the said John, seventh earl), succeeded to the estate; and from him it has lineally descended to Mary, Viscountess Falmouth, and \"jure suo\" Baroness Despencer, the present representative of the family. At Mereworth Castle itself, where the Viscount and Viscountess Falmouth reside, there is no view of the old building; but it is very possible that some drawing or engraving of it may exist in some of the residences of the Earls of Westmoreland subsequent to the seventh earl, or at the seat of the Dashwoods, or in the British Museum.\n\nI trouble you with this Query, in the hope that, among your numerous readers, some one may be placed in a position to give us information on the subject.

The estates were in Somersetshire. From the appearance of this name, I suspect it is not an English one; but rather an old form of spelling the name of the province of Tothmound or Thomond (South Munster), Ireland; and that this Nicholas was an O'Brien, who called himself from his family's principality, for it was not uncommon in England formerly to take names from estates. Perhaps some of your correspondents having access to the Inquisition would ascertain more on the subject, and give it to the public. The name of Nicholas O'Brien occurs in the Irish rolls of Chancery about that very period.\n\nA.

Who was the last knight? What prelate was the chaplain to the Order? Why was it dissolved? Why is it not revived again? We have several Welsh peers, noblemen, knights; four bishops, men of science and learning, Welshmen. I hope the good Queen Victoria will revive this ancient order of knighthood, and the Prince of Wales be created the first knight. The emblem of Wales is a red dragon.\n\nCan any of your readers give an account of this ancient order? Some years ago there were several letters in The Times, and other papers, respecting it and the Welsh motto. Wales should have its knight as well as Ireland, Scotland, and England.\n\nW.\n\nWarple-way.—The manor of Richmond, in Surrey, has been the property of the crown for many hundred years, I may say from time {126}immemorial: and in all the old records and plans, the green roads are called \"warple-ways.\" Some of the old plans are marked \"worple way,\" some \"warple way \" Can any of your readers tell me the derivation and meaning of the word, and refer me to an authority?\n\nWm.

C. W.\n\nReplies.\n\n\"CONSILIUM NOVEM DELECTORUM CARDINALIUM,\" ETC.\n\n(Vol. viii., p. 54.)\n\nThe Note of your correspondent Novus upon this Consilium ought to have been answered before; but as none of your contributors who can speak as \"having authority\" have undertaken to do so, I beg to offer to your readers the following statements and extracts, collected when my surprise at the assertions of Novus was quite fresh. {128}\n\nThe first point on which Novus requires correction is, the name of the pontiff to whom the Consilium purports to be addressed. Novus says Julius III., but the date of this document is unquestionably not later than the beginning of 1538, for Sleidan tells us that editions of it were printed at Rome, at Cologne, at Strasburg, and at another place, in the course of the year 1538; and in the title it is distinctly stated to have been presented to Paul III., who was pope in that year, whilst Julius III. was not elected till 1550.\n\nWhen Novus says that this Consilium \"has just been once more quoted, for the fiftieth time, perhaps, within the present generation, as a genuine document, and as proceeding from adherents of the Church of Rome,\" he falls short of the fact. For every writer of the least mark, or likelihood, whose subject has led him that way, has quoted it: thus, e.g., Ranke, who in his great work on The Popes and the Papacy, book ii. § 2., refers to it as indicative of no dishonourable design on the part of the supreme pontiff.\n\nAmongst the writers of the time when the Consilium is said to have been drawn up, who regarded it as genuine, we may mention Luther, who, soon after it found its way into Germany, published a translation, with one of his biting caricatures prefixed; and Sturm, who prefaced his translation with a letter to the cardinals to whom it was ascribed, for which reason alone his edition was put in the \"Index,\" no other edition being similarly honoured; and this sufficiently refutes a statement of Schelhorn, in his letter to Cardinal Quirinus, upon which much reliance has been placed by those whom Novus would regard as sharers of his opinion.\n\nThe appearance of the editions at Cologne and Strasburg in 1538, testifies to the speed with which the Consilium reached Germany. Sleidan asserts that, when it was published there, some fancied it to be fictitious, and intended to ridicule both the Pope and the Reformation; but others, that it was a device of the Pope to gain credit for not being hostile to the correction of certain confessed abuses. In the next year, on July 16th, Aleander wrote to Cochlæus thus:\n\n\"Multa haberem scribere de Republica, sed mali custodes estis rerum arcanarum,—Consiliis Cardinalium promulgatis, cum invectiva Sturmii, manibus hominum teritur, antequam vel auctoribus edita, vel executioni fuerit demandata.\"\n\nWhich passage might be regarded as decisive of the question of genuineness, since Aleander was one of the Cardinales delecti whose names are appended to the Consilium.\n\nThat Le Plat should insert a copy in his Monument. ad Hist. Concil. Trident. potius illustr. spect., may, perhaps, be considered an unsatisfactory argument; and the same will certainly be thought of the use of it by Sarpi. But Pallavicini is a witness not obnoxious to objections which apply to them, and he says:\n\n\"It happened by Divine Providence, that this Consilium was published, since it showed what were in fact the deepest wounds in the discipline of the Church, ascertained with great diligence, and exposed with the utmost freedom by men of incomparable zeal and knowledge. And these were neither falsity of dogmas, nor corruption of the Scriptures, nor wickedness of laws, nor politic craft beneath the garb of humility, nor impure vices, as the Lutherans asserted; but too great indulgence towards violations and abrogations of laws, which Luther far more licentiously abrogated,\" &c.—Vide book IV. ch. v., at the end.\n\nBut Ranke's note upon a casual reference to this document in book I. ch. ii. § 2. of his History of the Papacy, completely disposes of the question of its genuineness, and therefore of its \"seriousness\" (to use one of Novus' phrases), when taken in conjunction with what has gone before.\n\n\"Consilium, &c.; printed more than once even at the time, and important as pointing out the evil, so far as it lay in the administration of discipline, precisely and without reserve. Long after it had been printed, the MS. remained incorporated with the MSS. of the Curia.\"\n\nWere it not that the assertion of Novus is so roundly made, and in a form that is sure to adhere in the memories of readers sufficiently interested in the subject to notice his communication, it would have been enough to quote from one of the works he refers to, as containing copies of the Consilium, to expose the origin of his error; and this, now that I have shown it to be an error, I crave your permission to do. This, then, is what Brown says in his Appendix ad Fascicul. Rer. Expetend. et Fugiend. (commonly cited as Fascicul. vol. ii.), ed. 1690, pp. 230, 231.:\n\n\"Sæpius excusum est Consilium sequens, cum alibi, tum hic Londini, A.D. 1609, ex bibliothecâ Wilh.

D. Woodward.\n\nBungay, Suffolk.\n\nJOHN BUNYAN.\n\n(Vol. ix., p. 104.)\n\nA highly respected correspondent, Dr. S. R. Maitland, has seen an advertisement in the Mercurius Reformatus of June 11, 1690, announcing the intention of Bunyan's widow to publish ten manuscripts which her husband had left prepared for the press, together with some of his printed treatises which had become scarce. He inquires whether such a publication took place. In reply I beg leave to state that they were published in a small folio, containing \"ten [and two fragments] of his excellent manuscripts, and ten of his choice books formerly printed.\" The volume bears the title of \"The Works of that eminent Servant of Christ Mr. John Bunyan, late Minister of the Gospel and Pastor of the Congregation at Bedford. The first volume. London, by Wm. Marshall, 1692.\" It has the portrait by Sturt, and an impression from the original curious copper-plate inscribed, \"A Mapp, showing the order and causes of Salvation and Damnation.\" In addition to the Mercurius, John Dunton and others noticed, in terms of warm approval, the intended publication, which became extensively patronised, but has now become very scarce.\n\nTo the lovers of Bunyan it is peculiarly interesting, being accompanied by a tract called \"The Struggler,\" written by one of his affectionate and intimate friends, the Rev. C. Doe, containing a list of Bunyan's works, with the time when each of them was published, some personal characteristic anecdotes, and thirty reasons why all decided Christians should read and circulate these invaluable treatises. A copy presented to me by my worthy friend the late Mr. Creasy of Sleaford, which is in remarkably fine condition, has on the title to the Index a printed dedication to Sir John Hartop of Newington, the patron and friend of Dr. Watts. This volume was to have been followed by a second, to complete Bunyan's works, but difficulties arose as to the copyright of the more popular pieces, which prevented its publication. The original prospectus is preserved in the British Museum, which, with \"The Struggler\" and a new index to the whole of these truly excellent treatises, is reprinted in my edition of Bunyan's whole works for the first time collected and published, with his Life, in three volumes imperial 8vo., illustrated with fac-similes of all the old woodcuts and many elegant steel plates.\n\nGeorge Offor.\n\nHackney.\n\nTHE ASTEROIDS, ETC.\n\n(Vol. ix., p. 36.)\n\nIt is certainly an uncomfortable idea to suppose that the asteroids are the fragments of a former world, perhaps accompanied with satellites which have been scattered either by internal convulsion or external violence. By looking into the constitution and powers contained within our own earth, we know that the means are not wanting to rend us asunder under the combined effects of volcanic action, intense heat, and water, meeting deep within the substance of the earth under great pressure.\n\nHowever, there is much to be said against the theory of Olbers, notwithstanding its plausibility. The distance between the internal asteroid Flora, and the external one Hygeia, exceeds ninety millions of miles; or nearly the distance between the earth and the sun. The force which could shatter a world into fragments, and drive them asunder to such an extent, must indeed be tremendous.\n\nMr. Hind has drawn attention to the singular fact, that the asteroids \"appear to separate the planets of small mass from the greater bodies of the system, the planets which rotate on their axes in about the same time as our earth from those which are whirled round in less than half that time, though of ten times the diameter of the earth and,\" he continues, \"it may yet be found that these small bodies, so far from being portions {130}of the wreck of a planet, were created in their present state for some wise purpose, which the progress of astronomy in future ages may eventually unfold.\"\n\nOne thing I think is certain, that no disruption of a world belonging to our system could take place without producing some perceptible effect upon every other member of the system. The single centre of attraction being suddenly diffused and spread abroad into many smaller ones, at variable distances, must produce a sudden sway and alteration of position in all the other planets, and to a certain extent, derange their respective economies. From this some striking changes would necessarily arise, such as in the length of their respective periods of revolution, the amount of light and heat, and other physical conditions. Certain geological phenomena should be found to confirm such a change, if these suppositions be true.\n\nAs far as the theological part of the question is concerned, it is, I should think, opposed to Olbers' theory. Human intellect can scarcely conceive the necessity for the utter breaking up of a globe, even for the most grievous amount of sin. A more merciful dispensation was granted to our earth in the deluge; and the Power which removed all but eight lives from the earth could have equally removed the eight also, without destroying the integrity of the globe. It is as easy, and far more reasonable I think, to suppose, that the same Power which gave to Saturn a satellite nearly equal in size to Mars, should throw a cluster of minute planetoids into the space which, according to Bodes' empirical law, should have been devoted to one planet of larger dimensions.\n\nWhilst addressing you on astronomical subjects, I would beg leave to offer a few remarks upon Saturn, which I have not observed in any work on astronomy which I have yet consulted. This planet, with its satellites, appear to exhibit a close resemblance to the solar system, just as if it were a model of it.\n\nBesides his rings, Saturn is attended by eight satellites, so far as is at present known. The names of the satellites in their order from the body of the planet, are 1. Mimas, 2. Euceladus, 3. Tethys, 4. Dione, 5. Rhea, 6. Titan, 7. Hyperion, 8. Japetus. If we place them in a list in their order, and overagainst each place the names of the planets in their order from the sun, certain parallelisms will appear:\n\n1. Mimas 1. Mercury. 2. Euceladus 2. Venus. 3. Tethys 3. Earth. 4. Dione 4. Mars. 5. Rhea 5. Asteroids. 6. Titan 6. Jupiter. 7. Hyperion 7. Saturn. 8. Japetus 8. Uranus.\n\nThe relative magnitudes and relative positions of these bodies correspond in many points, I believe, so far as is at present known. Titan, like Jupiter, is the largest of his system; being but little less in size than the primary planet Mars. The next in magnitude is Japetus. Rhea is supposed to be of considerable size. The four inner ones are smaller than the others. Sir William Herschell considered that Tethys was larger than Euceladus, and Euceladus larger than Mimas. Dione and Hyperion have not yet been well estimated. These dimensions, if correct, correspond in many points with those of the planets. The first three satellites revolve in orbits of less diameter than that of our moon. The orbit of Dione, the fourth satellite, is almost precisely at the same distance from its primary as the moon is from the earth. As if to carry out the parallelism to the utmost, the zodiacal light of the sun has often been compared to the ring of Saturn.\n\nOne remark it would appear arises out of these observations, viz. that the laws of attraction and gravitation seem to require, for the proper regulation of the whole system, that where a number of bodies of various sizes revolve round one common centre, the larger body should revolve at a certain relative distance from that centre. Thus Titan, like a huge pendulum, seems to sway and maintain the regularity of the minor system, just as Jupiter may be imagined to do in the great one.\n\nI must not intrude too far on your valuable space, but there remain some interesting points for discussion in the Saturnian system.\n\nJohn William Harrris.\n\nExon.\n\nCAPS AT CAMBRIDGE.\n\n(Vol. ix., p. 27.)\n\nThe extract from an unpublished MS. given by A Regent M.A. of Cambridge refers to the year 1620, as will appear from the following passages in Anthony à Wood's Hist. and Antiq. of Univ. of Oxford.\n\n\"1614.—In the latter end of the last and beginning of this year, a spirit of sedition (as I may so call it) possessed certain of the Regent Masters against the Vicechanc. and Doctors. The chief and only matter that excited them to it was their sitting like boys, bare-headed, in the Convocation-House, at the usual assemblies there, which was not, as 'twas thought, so fit, that the Professors of the Faculty of Arts (on which the University was founded) should, all things considered, do it. The most forward person among them, named Henry Wightwicke, of Gloucester Hall, having had some intimation of a statute which enabled them to be covered with their caps, and discovering also something in the large west window of St. Mary's Church, where pictures of Regents and non-Regents were sitting covered in assemblies before the Chancellor, clapt {131}on his cap, and spared not to excite his brethren to vindicate that custom, now in a manner forgotten; and, having got over one of the Regents to be more zealous in the matter than himself, procured the hands of most, if not all, of them to be set to a petition (in order to be sent to the Chancellor of the University), for the effecting and bringing about the matter. But the Vicechancellor, Dr. Singleton, having had timely notice of the design, sends a full relation of the matter to the Chancellor; whereupon answer was returned, that he should deal therein as he should think fit. Wightwicke, therefore, being called into question for endeavouring to subvert the honour and government of the University, whereby he ran himself into perjury (he having before taken an oath to keep and maintain the rites, customs, and privileges of the University), was banished, and his party, who had proved false to him, severely checkt by the Chancellor.\n\n\"At length Wightwicke's friends, laying open to him the danger that he would run himself into, if he should not seek restauration and submit, did, after his peevish and rash humour had been much courted to it, put up a petition (subscribed in his behalf by the Bishop of London and Sir John Bennett) to the Chancellor of the University for his restauration, which being with much ado granted, but with this condition, that he make an humble recantation in the Convocation, sent to his Vicechancellor what should be done in the matter, and among other things thus:—'For the manner of his submission and recognition which he is to make, I will not take upon me to direct, but leave yt wholy unto your wisdomes, as well for manner as for the matter; only thus much generally I will intimate unto you, that the affront and offence committed by Whittwicke in the Congregation House by his late insolent carriage there was very great and notorious, and that offence afterwards seconded and redoubled by another as ill or worse than the former, in his seditious practizing and procuring a multitude of handes, thereby thinking to justifie and maintain his former errors, and his proud and insolent disobedience and contempt. I hold yt therefore very requisite that his submission and recognition, both of the one fault and of the other, should be as publique and as humble as possibly with conveniencye may bee. Which being thus openly done, as I hope yt will bee a good example to others, to deter them from committing the like offence hereafter, so I do also wishe this his punishment may be only ad correctionem et non ad destructionem.\"\n\n\"This being the effect of the Chancellor's mind, Wightwicke was summoned to appear to make his submission in the next Convocation, which being held 25 June this year, he placed himself in the middle of St. Mary's chancel, and spoke with an audible voice as followeth:\n\n\"'Ornatissime Domine Procancellarie, vosque Domini Doctores pientissimi, quotquot me vel banniendum vel bannitionem meam ratam esse voluistis ut vobis omnibus et singulis innotescat discupio: me Henricum Whitwicke pileum coram Domino Vicecancellario Thoma Singleton capiti haud ita pridem imposuisse, quod nemini Magistrorum in Congregatione vel Convocatione [in presentia Domini Vicecancellarii aut Doctoris alicujus] licere fateor. Scitote quæso prætereà, me supradictum Henricum à sententia Domini Vicecancellarii ad venerabilem Domum Congregationis provocasse, quod nec licitum nec honestum esse in causa perturbationis pacis facilè concedo. Scitote denique me solum, manus Academicorum egregiè merentium Theologia Baccalaureorum et in Artibus Magistrorum in hac corona astantium Collegiatim et Aulatim cursitando rescripto apponendas curasse, in quibus omnibus Præfectis [summe] displicuisse, in pacem almæ hujus Academiæ et in dignissimum nostrum Procancellarium deliquisse, parum nolenti animo confiteor, et sanctitates vestras humillimè imploro, ut quæ vel temerè et inconsultò, vel volenter et scienter feci, ea, ut deceat homines, condonentur.\n\n'Henricus Wightwicke.'\n\nWhich submission or recognition being ended, he was restored to his former state, and so forthwith reassumed his place. But this person, who as lately beneficed at Kingerbury in Lincolnshire, could never be convinced, when he became Master of Pembroke College, forty-six years after this time, that he made any submission at all, but carried the business on and effected it against all the University; as to his young acquaintance that came often to visit him and he them (for he delighted in boyish company), he would, after a pedantical way, boast, supposing perhaps that, having been so many years before acted, no person could remember it; but record will rise up and justify matters when names and families are quite extirpated and forgotten among men. Pray see more of this cap-business in the year 1620.\"\n\n\"1620.—In the beginning of Michaelmas Term following, the cap-business, mentioned an. 1614, was renewed again: for some disrelishment of the former transactions remaining behind, the Regent Masters met together several times for the effecting their designs. At length, after much ado, they drew up a petition subscribed by fifty-three of the senior Masters for this year, and presented it to one whom they knew would not be violent against them, as Dr. Singleton was before. The beginning of it runs thus:\n\n\"'Reverendissimo Viro Domino Doctori Prideaux ornatissimo hujus Academiæ Vicecan. digniss, &c.\n\n\"'Multa jamjudum sunt (reverendissime Vicecancellarie) quæ ab antiquis hujus Academiæ institutis salubriter profecta, mala tandem consuetudo, et in pejus potens aut abrogavit penitus aut pessime corrupit, &c.'\n\n\"Among those that subscribed to it were these following, that afterwards became persons of note, viz, Gilbert Sheldon, Alexand. Gill, jun., and Anthony Farndon, of Trinity Coll.; Pet. Heylin of Magd. Coll. [Robert Newlin of C. C. C., &c.]. The chief solicitor of the business was Rous Clopton of Corpus Ch. Coll., a restless, busy person, and one afterwards as much noted for his infamy as any of the former for their learning or place. This petition, I say, being presented to Dr. Prideaux the Vicechancellor, and he considering well their several reasons for their sitting covered (one of which was that they were Judges in Congregations and Convocations), sent it to the Chancellor to have his consent, who also, after he had considered of it, wrote a letter to the Vicechancellor, to {132}be communicated to the Convocation: the chief contents of which are these:\n\n\"'After my very harty commendations, I doe take this manner of proceeding by the Regent Masters (for their sitting covered at Congregations and Convocations) in soe good part, that although I might well take some time to advise before I give answer, especially when I consider how long that custom hath continued, how much it hath been questioned, and that upon a long debate it hath been withstood by so grave and wise a Counsellor of State as your late Chancellor, my immediate predecessor; yet, when I weigh their undoubted right, their discreet and orderly proceedings to seek it, not to take it, the chief, if not the only, cause why it was formerly denied; the good congruity this doth beare, not with Cambridge alone (though that were motive enough), but all other places, it being no where seen that those that are admitted Judges are required to sit bare-headed; I cannot choose but commend and thus farre yield to theire request as to referre it to the Convocation House. I hope no man can have cause to think that I have not the power to continew this custom as well as some others of my predecessors, if I had a mind to strive; nor that I seek after their applause in yielding them that now, which hath been so long kept from them, but the respect I have to their due, to the decency of the place, and honour of the University, which I cannot conceive to bee anyway diminished, but rather increased, by their sitting covered, are the only reasons that have moved me, and carried me to so quick a resolution, wherewith you may acquaint the Convocation House with this also, that what they shall conclude I shall willingly agree to. And soe I doe very hartely take leave, and rest\n\nYour assured loving friend,\n\nPembrooke.\n\nBaynard's Castle,\n\nthis 4 of December, 1620.'\n\nWhich letter being publickly read in a Convocation held 20 Dec., it was then agreed upon by the consent of all there present, that all Masters of what condition soever might put on their caps in Congregations and Convocations, yet with these conditions: That in the said assemblies the said Masters should use only square caps, and not sit bare, or without cap. And if any were found faulty in these matters, or that they should bring their hats in the said Assemblies, they should not only lose their suffrages for that time, but be punished as the Vicechancellor should think fit. Lastly, it was decreed, under the said conditions and no otherwise, that in the next Congregation in the beginning of Hilary Term, and so for ever after, all Masters, of what condition soever, whether Regents or not Regents, should, in Congregations and Convocations, put on and use square caps.\n\n\"All that shall be said more of this matter is, that the loss of using caps arose from the negligence of the Masters, who, to avoid the pains of bringing their caps with them, would sit bare-headed; which being used by some, was at length followed by all, and so at length became a custom.\"\n\nIt would seem, from Lord Pembroke's letter, that the right of the senate of this university to wear their caps had not been questioned.\n\nC. H. Cooper.\n\nCambridge.\n\nRUSSIA, TURKEY, AND THE BLACK SEA.\n\n(Vol. ix., p. 103.)\n\nStatements and complaints have often been made respecting the imperfect knowledge possessed by English navigators of the shores and coasts of the Black Sea, and of the great danger thence arising to ships and fleets from England, which would thus seem to be without the charts necessary for their guidance. The Guardian newspaper reiterates these complaints in its number for Jan. 11. This deficiency of charts, however, ought not to exist, and probably does not; since, no doubt, the English and French Governments would take care to supply them at the present time. As respects England, Dr. E. D. Clarke, in his well-known Travels in Russia, &c. (see vol. i. 4th edit., 8vo., London, 1816, Preface, p. x.), states that he brought—\n\n\"Certain documents with him from Odessa, at the hazard of his life, and deposited within a British Admiralty.\"\n\nThese documents, we are led naturally to infer, were charts; for he adds:\n\n\"They may serve to facilitate the navigation of the Russian coasts of the Black Sea, if ever the welfare of Great Britain should demand the presence of her fleets in that part of the world.\"\n\nHappening to meet with this passage, in consulting Dr. Clarke's Travels, at the beginning of December, when the Fleets of Great Britain and France were on the point of entering the Black Sea, and having read in many quarters fears expressed for the fleets from the want of charts, I ventured to copy out the passage relating to these remarkable documents, and sent it to Lord Aberdeen; in case, from the alleged poverty of charts in the Admiralty Catalogues (see The Guardian, Jan. 11.), Dr. Clarke's \"documents\" should have fallen out of sight, and were forgotten. No notice, however, was taken of my communication; from which I concluded that it was wholly valueless.\n\nJohn Macray.\n\nOxford.\n\nHIGH DUTCH AND LOW DUTCH.\n\n(Vol. viii., pp. 478. 601.)\n\nIf \"N. & Q.\" were the publication in which questions were cursorily settled, the answer of James Spence Harry (p. 478.) might suffice with regard to the Query of S. C. P. (p. 413.); but your correspondent E. C. H., who seems also {133}to know something about the matter, wishes for German evidence.\n\nShould your correspondents James S. Harry and E. C. H. be acquainted (and I doubt not but they are) with the song, in which a German inquires \"What is his native land?\" and having called over some of the principalities, as Prussia, Suabia, Bavaria, Pomerania, Westphalia, Switzerland, Tyrol, he cries disdainfully, \"No! no! no! my fatherland must be greater:\" at last, despairing, he asks to name him that land, and is answered, \"Wherever the German tongue is heard:\"—should James S. Harry and E. C. H. recollect these words, they will conceive that such a people must have several tribes, and each tribe their peculiar dialect, founded on prescribed rules, and to which individually equal justice is due.\n\nThe dialects of the Deutsche Sprache, the German language, are the Ober Deutsche and Nieder Deutsche, Upper German and Low German: from the former dialect has, in course of time, proceeded the Hoch Deutsche Sprache, the High German language, now used exclusively as the book language by the more educated classes throughout Germany.\n\nThe principal dialects of the Ober Deutsche are the following:\n\n1. The Allemanic, spoken in Switzerland and the Upper Rhine.\n\n2. The Suabian, spoken in the countries between the Black Forest and the River Lech.\n\n3. The Bavarian, spoken in the South of Bavaria and Austria.\n\n4. The Franconian, spoken in the North of Bavaria, Hessen, and the Middle Rhine.\n\n5. The Upper Saxon or Misnian, spoken in the plains of Saxony and Thüringia.\n\nThese dialects differ from each other, and particularly from the High German language, with regard to their elements.\n\nThe Ober Deutsche dialects differ from each other by the introduction of peculiar vowels.\n\nThe Nieder Deutsche is distinguished from the Ober Deutsche by the shifting of consonants: ex. gr.:\n\nOBER DEUTSCHE DIALECTS.

The proportions which he recommends, and his mode of operating, are, it will be seen, somewhat different from those hitherto published. In writing to me he says: \"I make a point of making a short note in the evening of the day's experiments, a plan involving very little trouble, but of great service as a reference.\" If all photographers would adopt this simple plan, how much good would result! Dr. M. complains to me of the constant variation he has found in collodion; (with your permission, I will in your pages furnish him, and all your readers with some plain directions on this point); and he has given me some excellent observations on the \"fashionable\" waxed-paper process, in which he has not met with such good results as he had anticipated; although with much experience which may some day turn to good account. Dr. Mansell concludes with an observation in which I entirely concur, viz. \"That the calotype process is by far the most useful; and I find the pictures it gives have better effect than the wax ones, which always to me appear flat, even when they are not gravelly.\"\n\nH. W. Diamond.\n\nThe Calotype on the Sea-shore.—The great quantity of blue light reflected from the sea renders calotyping in its vicinity much more difficult than in the country; the more distant the object, the greater depth has the blue veil which floats over it, and as a consequence of this disproportion, if time enough is given in the camera to bring out the foreground, the sky becomes red, and the distance obscured. After constant failures with papers iodized in the usual manner, I made a number of experiments to obtain a paper that would stand the camera long enough to satisfy the required conditions, and the result was the following method, which gives an intensity of blacks and half-tones, with a solidity and uniform depth over large portions of sky, greater than I have seen produced by any other process. Since I adopted it, in the autumn of 1852, I have scarcely had a failure, and this success induces me to recommend it to those who, like myself, work in highly actinising localities.\n\nThe object of the following plan is to impregnate the paper evenly with a strong body of iodide of silver. I prefer iodizing by the single process, and for this purpose use a strong solution of iodide of silver, as the paper when finished ought to have, as nearly as possible, the colour of pure iodide of silver.\n\nTake 100 grains of nitrate of silver, and 100 grains of iodide of potassium , dissolve each in two ounces of distilled water, pour the iodide solution into the nitrate of silver, wash the precipitate in three distilled waters, pour off the fluid, and dissolve it in a solution of iodide of potassium, about 680 grains are required, making the whole up to four ounces.\n\nHaving cut the paper somewhat larger than the picture, turn up the edges so as to form a dish, and placing it on a board, pour into it the iodide solution abundantly, guiding it equally over the surface with a camel-hair pencil; continue to wave it to and fro for five minutes, then pour off the surplus, which serves over and over again, and after dripping the paper, lay it to dry on a round surface, so that it dries equally fast all over; when almost dry it is well to give it a sight of the fire, to finish off those parts which remain wet longest, but not more than just to surface dry it.\n\nImmerse it in common rain-water, often changing it, and in about twenty minutes all the iodide of potash is removed. To ascertain this, take up some of the last water in a glass, and add to it a few drops of a strong solution of bichloride of mercury in alcohol, the least trace of hydriodate of potash is detected by a precipitate of iodide of mercury. A solution of nitrate of silver is no test whatever unless distilled water is used, as ordinary water almost invariably contains muriates. The sooner the washing is over the better. Pin up the paper to drip, and finish drying before a slow fire, turning it. If hung up to dry by a corner, the parts longest wet are always weaker than those that dry first. When dry pass a nearly cold iron over the back, to smooth it; if well made it has a fine primrose colour, and is perfectly even by transmitted light.\n\nTo excite the paper, take distilled water two drachms, drop into it four drops (not minims) of saturated solution of gallic acid, and eight drops (not minims) of the aceto-nitrate solution; mix. Always dilute the gallic acid by dropping it into the water before the aceto-nitrate; gallate of silver is less readily formed, and the paper keeps longer in hot weather. If the temperature is under sixty degrees, use five drops of gallic acid, and ten of aceto-nitrate; if above seventy degrees, use only three drops of gallic acid, and seven of aceto-nitrate. The aceto-nitrate solution consists of nitrate of silver fifty grains, glacial acetic acid two drachms, distilled water one ounce.\n\nHaving pinned the paper by two adjacent corners to a deal board, the eighth of an inch smaller on each side than it is, to prevent the solutions getting to the back, lay on the gallo-nitrate abundantly with a soft cotton brush (made by wedging a portion of fine cotton into a cork); and keep the solution from pooling, by using the brush with a very light hand. In about two minutes the paper has imbibed it evenly, and lies dead; blot it up, and allow it to dry in a box, or place it at once in the paper-holder. For fear of stains on the {135}back, it is better to place on the board a clean sheet of ordinary paper for every picture. It is very important to have the glass, in which the gallo-nitrate is made, chemically clean; every time it is used, it should be washed with strong nitric acid, and then with distilled water.\n\nTo develop:—Pin the paper on the board as before; rapidly brush over it a solution of gallo-nitrate, as used to excite. As soon as the picture appears, in about a minute, pour on a saturated solution of gallic acid abundantly, and keep it from pooling with the brush, using it with a very light hand. In about ten minutes the picture is fully developed. If very slow in coming out, a few drops of pure aceto-nitrate brushed over the surface will rapidly bring out the picture; but this is seldom required, and it will sometimes brown the whites. It is better, as soon as the gallic acid has been applied, to put the picture away from the light of the candle in a box or drawer, there to develop quietly, watching its progress every three or four minutes; the surface is to be refreshed by a few light touches of the brush, adding more gallic acid if necessary. Many good negatives are spoiled by over-fidgetting in this part of the process. When the picture is fully out, wash, &c. as usual; the iodide of silver is rapidly removed by a saturated solution of hyposulphite of soda, which acts much less on the weaker blacks than it does if diluted.\n\nIf the picture will not develop, from too short exposure in the camera, a solution of pyrogallic acid, as Dr. Diamond recommends, after the gallic acid has done its utmost, greatly increases the strength of the blacks: it slightly reddens the whites, but not in the same ratio that it deepens the blacks.\n\nAfter the first wash with gallo-nitrate, it is essential to develop these strongly iodized papers with gallic acid only: the half-and-half mixture of aceto-nitrate and gallic acid, which works well with weaker papers, turns these red.\n\nThe paper I use is Whatman's 1849. Turner's paper, Chafford Mills, if two or three years old, answers equally well.\n\nM. L. Mansell, A.B. M.D.\n\nGuernsey, Jan. 30, 1854.\n\nReplies to Minor Queries.\n\nNed o' the Todding (Vol. ix., p. 36.).—In answer to the inquiry of W. T., I beg to say that he will find the thrilling narrative of poor Ned of the Toddin in Southey's Espriella's Letters from England, vol. ii. p. 42.; but I am not aware of any lines with the above heading, by which I presume W. T. to be in search of some poetical rendering of the tale.\n\nF. C. H.\n\nHour-glasses and Inscriptions on old Pulpits (Vol. ix., pp. 31. 64.).—In St. Edmund's Church, South Burlingham, stands an elegant pulpit of the fifteenth century, painted red and blue, and relieved with gilding. On it there still remains an old hour-glass, though such appendages were not introduced till some centuries probably after the erection of this pulpit. The following legend goes round the upper part of this pulpit, in the old English character:\n\n\"Inter natos mulierum non surrexit major Johanne Baptista.\"\n\nF. C. H.\n\nTable-turning (Vol. ix., pp. 39. 88.).—I have not Ammianus Marcellinus within reach, but, if I am not mistaken, after the table had been got into motion, the oracle was actually given by means of a ring. This being held over, suspended by a thread, oscillated or leaped from one to another of the letters of the alphabet which were engraved on the edge of the table, or that which covered it. The passage would not occupy many lines, and I think that many readers of \"N. & Q.\" would be interested if some one of its learned correspondents would furnish a copy of it, with a close English translation.\n\nN. B.\n\n\"Firm was their faith\" (Vol. ix., p. 17.).—Grateful as I am to all who think well enough of my verses to discuss them in \"N. & Q.,\" yet I cannot permit them to be incorrectly quoted or wrongly revised. If, as F. R. R. alleges, I had written in the third line of the stanza quoted—\"with firm and trusting hands\"—then I should have repeated the same epithet (firm) twice in three lines. Whereas I wrote, as a reference to Echoes from Old Cornwall, p. 58., will establish, stern.\n\nR. S. Hawker.\n\nThe Wilbraham Cheshire MS. (Vol. viii., pp. 270. 303.).—With regard to this highly curious MS., I am enabled to state that it is still preserved at Delamere House, the seat of George Fortescue Wilbraham, Esq., by whom it has been continued down to the present time. Mr. Wilbraham has answered this Query himself, but from some accident his reply did not appear in the pages of \"N. & Q.\" I therefore, having recently seen the MS., take this opportunity of assuring your querist of its existence.\n\nW. J. Bernhard Smith.\n\nTemple.\n\nMousehunt (Vol. viii., pp. 516. 606.; Vol. ix., p. 65.).—This animal is well known by this name in Norfolk, where the marten is very rare, if not entirely unknown. The Norfolk mousehunt, or mousehunter, is the Mustela vulgaris. (Vide Forby's Vocab. of East Anglia, vol. ii. p. 222., who errs, however, in calling it the stoat, but says that it is the \"smallest animal of the weasel tribe, and pursues the smallest prey.\") It would be of much use, both to naturalists and others, if our zoological works would give the popular provincial names of animals and birds; collectors might then more easily procure specimens from labourers, &c. I have formed a list of Norfolk names for birds, {136}which shall appear in \"N. & Q.\" if desired. The Norfolk Mustelidæ in order of size are the \"pollcat,\" or weasel; the stoat, or cane; the mousehunt, mousehunter, or lobster. A popular notion of gamekeepers is, that pollcats add a new lobe to their livers every year of their lives; but the disgusting smell of the animal prevents examining this point by dissection.\n\nE. G. R.\n\nIf Fennell's Natural History of Quadrupeds be correctly quoted, as it is stated to be \"a very excellent and learned work,\" Mr. Fennell must have been a better naturalist than geographer, for he says of the beech marten:\n\n\"In Selkirkshire it has been observed to descend to the shore at night time to feed upon mollusks, particularly upon the large basket mussel (Mytilus modiolus).\"\n\nSelkirkshire, as you well know, is an inland county, nowhere approaching the sea by many miles: I would fain hope, for Mr. Fennell's sake, that Selkirkshire is either a misprint or a misquotation.\n\nJ. Ss.\n\nBegging the Question (Vol. viii., p. 640.).—This is a common logical fallacy, petitio principii; and the first known use of the phrase is to be found in Aristotle, τὸ ἐν ἀρχῆ ἀιτεῖσθαι (Topics, b. VIII. ch. xiii., Bohn's edition), where the five ways of \"begging the question,\" as also the contraries thereof, are set forth. In the Prior Analytics (b. II. ch. xvi.) he gives one instance from mathematicians—\n\n\"who fancy that they describe parallel lines, for they deceive themselves by assuming such things as they cannot demonstrate unless they are parallel. Hence it occurs to those who thus syllogise to say that each thing is, if it is; and thus everything will be known through itself, which is impossible.\"\n\nT. J. Buckton.\n\nBirmingham.\n\nTermination \"-by\" (Vol. viii., p. 105.).—On going over an alphabetical list of places from A to G, I obtained these results:\n\nLincoln 65 Leicester 21 York 24 Northampton 9 Cumberland 7 Norfolk 6 Westmoreland 3 Lancashire 2 Derby 2 Nottingham 2 Sussex 1 Total 142\n\nResults of a similar character were obtained in reference to -thorp, -trop, -thrup, or -drop; Lincoln again heading the list, but closely followed by Norfolk, then Leicester, Notts, &c.\n\nB. H. C.\n\nGerman Tree (Vol. viii., p. 619.; Vol. ix., p. 65.).—Eryx has mistaken my Query owing to its vagueness. When I said, \"Is this the first notice of a German tree in England?\" I meant, \"Is this the first notice of a German-tree-in-England?\" and not \"Is this the first notice-in-England of a German-tree?\" as Eryx understood it.\n\nZeus.\n\nCeltic Etymology (Vol. ix., p. 40.).—If the h must be \"exhasperated\" (as Matthews used to say) in words adopted into the English language, how does it happen that we never hear it in hour, honour, heir, honest, and humour? Will E. C. H. be so kind as to inform me on this point? With regard to the word humble, in support of the h being silent, I have seen it stated in a dictionary, but by whom I cannot call to mind, in a list of words nearly spelled alike, and whose sound is the same:\n\nHence the point of the sarcasm \"He will be made to eat humble pie;\" and it serves in this instance to show that the h is silent when the word is properly pronounced.\n\nThe two words isiol and irisiol, properly uirisiol, which E. C. H. has stated to be the original Celtic words signifying humble, have quite a different meaning: for isiol is quietly, silently, without noise; and uirisiol means, sneaking, cringing, crawling, terms which could not be applied without injustice to a really humble honest person. The Iberno-Phœnician umal bears in itself evidence that it is not borrowed from any other language, for the two syllables are intelligible apart from each other; and the word can be at once reduced to its root um, to which the Sanscrit word kshama, as given by E. C. H., bears no resemblance whatever.\n\nFras. Crossley.\n\nRecent Curiosities of Literature (Vol. ix., p. 31.).—Your correspondent Mr. Cuthbert Bede has done well in directing Mr. Thackeray's attention to the error of substituting \"candle\" for \"candlestick,\" at p. 47. of The Newcomes; but it appears that the author discovered the error, and made a clumsy effort to rectify it; for he elsewhere gives us to understand, that she died of a wound in her temple, occasioned by coming into contact with the stone stairs. See H. Newcome's letter.\n\nThe following curiosity of literature lately appeared in the London papers, in a biographical notice of the late Viscount Beresford, which is inserted in the Naval and Military Gazette of January 14, 1854:\n\n\"Of honorary badges he had, first, A cross dependent from seven clasps: this indicated his having been present in eleven battles during the Peninsular War. His name was unaccountably omitted in the {137}return of those present at Ciudad Rodrigo. When Her Majesty gracefully extended the honorary distinctions to all the survivors of the great war, Lord Beresford received the Peninsular medal, with two clasps, for Egypt and Ciudad Rodrigo.\"\n\nThe expression should have been \"the silver medal,\" not \"Peninsular;\" as, among the names of battles engraved on the clasps attached to the silver war-medals, granted in 1849, will be found the words \"Martinique,\" \"Fort Détroit,\" \"Chateauguay,\" \"Chrystler's Farm,\" and \"Egypt.\"\n\nJuverna.\n\nD. O. M. (Vol. iii, p. 173.).—I am surprised that there should be the least doubt that the above are the initials of \"Datur omnibus mori.\"\n\nR. W. D.\n\nDr. John Taylor (Vol. viii., p. 299.).—There are several errors in the communication of S. R. He states that \"Dr. John Taylor was buried at Kirkstead, Lancashire, where his tomb is distinguished by the following simple inscription.\"\n\n1. Kirkstead is in Lincolnshire.\n\n2. Dr. John Taylor lies interred in the burial-ground attached to the Presbyterian Chapel at Chowbent, near Bolton, in Lancashire.\n\n3. The inscription on the tombstone is as follows:\n\n\"Here is interred the Rev. John Taylor, D.D., of Warrington, formerly of Norwich, who died March 5, 1761, aged 66.\"\n\n4. The inscription given by S. R. is on a slab in the chapel at Chowbent. I may add that this inscription was drawn up by Dr. Enfield.\n\nThomas Baker.\n\nManchester.\n\nLines attributed to Hudibras (Vol. i., p. 211.).—\n\nIn so far as I can understand from the various articles in \"N. & Q.\" regarding the above quotation, it is to be found in the Musarum Deliciæ, 12mo., 1656. There is a copy of this volume now lying before me, the title-page of which runs thus:\n\n\"Musarum Deliciæ, or the Muses' Recreation; containing severall pieces of Poetique Wit.
