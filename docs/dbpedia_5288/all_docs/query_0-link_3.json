        "text": "At Thomas Mansfield Family Law solicitors we believe that family lawyers shouldn’t just be good at the law but should genuinely want to understand a client’s concerns and priorities in what are very often extremely upsetting and difficult times. From the very beginning, we believe in winning your trust, in sitting down to talk to you and in giving you the help and support you need through the whole process.\n\nOf course, we’re also extremely good at what we do. By specialising in divorce and family law we have the experience to handle most of the situations that arise, however complex. It also means that we keep abreast of the latest developments in family law, utilising the most cost effective ways of resolving disputes or pursuing litigation. This helps us stay ahead of the competition and ensures we achieve our clients’ goals.\n\nAs part of Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, Thomas Mansfield Family Law benefits from a well-established track record of first-class client service. This is borne out not only by our many testimonials from happy clients but also the award of the Law Society’s quality management kite-mark, Lexcel, which we’ve held since 2012. We were also winners of the Best Business award at the 2022 Times of Tunbridge Wells Business Awards. This external accreditation recognises our particularly high standards of client care and business management practices. Thomas Mansfield also ranks highly in the Legal 500, a leading independent guide to the legal profession.\n\nWe think you’ll have confidence in our combination of robust legal expertise, and discreet and sensitive approach to your personal circumstances. You are welcome to come along and meet one of our divorce and family law solicitors for a discussion about your own situation. We are also happy to meet in a place to suit you – whether London City, Canary Wharf, London West End, Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells, Dartford or Maidstone."
