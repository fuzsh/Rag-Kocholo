        "text": "Now entering its fifth year, the Mansfield Rule has become the standard by which law firms track and measure the consideration of at least 30% women, lawyers from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, lawyers with disabilities and LGBTQ+ lawyers for top leadership roles, senior-level lateral hiring, promotions into the equity partnership and participation in client pitch meetings.\n\n“Diversity and inclusion are at the pillar of the firm’s leadership,” said Stacie Yee, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer at Pillsbury. “We are excited to work alongside Diversity Lab to further increase the inclusion of underrepresented lawyers in these leadership roles and to ultimately set a new standard across the industry.”"
