        "text": "Thomas Mansfield Solicitors has been announced as the winner of the best business 26+ employees category at the Times of Tunbridge Wells Awards 2022.\n\nNeill Thomas, Emma Howlett and Anthony Kiernan represented the firm with a submission showcasing the range of initiatives which have contributed to the firm’s consistent growth and strong financial performance. Thomas Mansfield was also shortlisted as a finalist in the “resilient business” category in recognition of the firm’s response to the challenges presented by the pandemic and Brexit.\n\nThe winners were announced at an awards ceremony at Salomons Estate on 24 March 2022. The Times of Tunbridge Wells Awards seek to celebrate the success of businesses across the region and the evening was attended by over 200 people from over 100 businesses.\n\nNeill Thomas, Managing Director at Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, said “we have expanded rapidly since 2017, adding three new service lines (family, private client and dispute resolution) to the firm’s original employment law practice. We believe that at the core of our success is our people and our clients. We are exceptionally proud of who we are and ensuring the culture of the firm stays true to its roots – a friendly, flexible and productive firm is very important to us”.\n\nHe continued “we have worked hard to differentiate ourselves from the competition and our key focus is and always has been providing excellent client care and the very best outcomes for our client. Our clients tell us our accessibility and responsiveness are major factors in selecting a lawyer, so we established new client onboarding procedures and a new team to enable our lawyers to focus on providing on the needs of our clients, without getting pulled into administrative and routine tasks”."
