        "text": "At Thomas Mansfield Solicitors we understand that talking about issues relating to death and mental capacity can be very sensitive and personal and that is why we treat our clients as people, not just as a file.\n\nOur number one priority is to work in the best interests of our clients and provide them with a service that is personal to them and their situation. We don’t believe in simply handing out one-size-fits-all advice.\n\nExperience has taught us that clients require the comfort of knowing that their matter is going to be dealt with professionally and competently. To ensure that our clients receive the highest standard of service and to ensure they receive a service that is personal to them, they will be allocated to one of our private client solicitors or lawyers who will look after them throughout their matter.\n\nOur private client solicitors and lawyers are able to provide advice in the following areas:-\n\nWill Drafting\n\nInheritance Tax Planning\n\nProbate/Estate Administration\n\nPower of Attorney\n\nCourt of Protection Applications\n\nBy specialising in the above areas, we are as a firm, able to keep on top of the ever-changing legal landscape and stay ahead of the field.\n\nAt the heart of our success is the continuing belief that clients will only instruct us if we deliver a consistent, first class legal service and this is why we have picked our solicitors and lawyers for their excellent academic qualifications and experience. This ethos has resulted in our clients returning to us time and again for legal advice on a range of matters including family and employment law. Many clients come to us from word of mouth referrals and recommendations born out of excellent client feedback.\n\nThomas Mansfield Private Client Solicitors form part of Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, a leading and well-established legal practice in London and the South, with awards for delivering excellent client service and having obtained the Law Society’s quality management kite-mark, Lexcel since 2012. We have also won the Law Society’s Excellence award for innovation. External accreditation and consistently high client feedback recognises our particularly high standards of client care and business management practices. Thomas Mansfield also ranks highly in the Legal 500 and Chambers and Partners, both leading independent guides to the legal profession.\n\nCall us for an initial chat prior to instructing us formally and see for yourself the difference we can make to your particular circumstances.
