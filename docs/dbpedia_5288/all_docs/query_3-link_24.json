        "text": "As the end of 2021 approaches, we want to say thank you to our clients, contacts, colleagues, families and friends for their support over the last 12 months.\n\nIt’s been another challenging year as the pandemic continues to run its course, but we want to share some of the positive news and exciting innovations which have been taking place at Thomas Mansfield Solicitors.\n\nIt has certainly been a story of growth for all our teams, with the number of people at Thomas Mansfield increasing by more than 60% to meet client demand. What has been particularly pleasing is the huge amount of positive feedback we have received about our client care. This is only made possible with our talented lawyers and dedicated support staff, who strive to achieve the best possible outcomes for clients and provide the best possible service.\n\n2021 has also seen the firm launch a new dispute resolution service. Headed by new partner Paula Kumar, who has brought a wealth of expertise to the firm, the Dispute Resolution team advises on general commercial disputes across a wide range of industries, and is experienced in all forms of dispute resolution including litigation, arbitration and mediation. Our work covers a wide range of areas, including shareholder disputes, breach of contract claims and High Court injunctions.\n\nUnder the leadership of Susi Gillespie our Family team expanded significantly across London, Surrey and Kent and broke into The Legal 500, a leading legal directory which analyses and ranks law firms across the UK on the quality of their expertise, client service and standing in the market. Building on the success of our French office, opened in 2019 to support British expats struggling with the France’s complex divorce laws, we have grown our international family law services and now offer both family and private client services in countries with large expat communities across the world.\n\nOur Private Client team, headed by Emma Howlett, is now six people strong and has launched a fixed price ‘Simple’ range of services, which includes Wills, LPAs and Probate. Increasingly, our clients have an international connections of some sort and we regularly advise on cross-border probate matters and Wills and estate planning with an international dimension.\n\nThe employment law webinar programme we developed in March 2020 has gone from strength to strength under the direction of the joint heads of the Employment team, Angie Crush and Meredith Hurst. HR managers and directors of national and multinational companies are regularly tuning in to be updated on the latest developments and we are currently working on our new webinar schedule for 2022.\n\nRe-opening our London office at new premises on 1 November has been a highlight of 2021. Our office in the Grade 2 listed building of Token House, next to the Bank of England in the heart of the City has been instrumental in bringing the teams together to benefit from shared learning and collaboration.\n\nWe have also welcomed the arrival of two new senior managers – Claire Wood as Marketing and Business Development Manager and Bradley Shortall as Finance Manager, both bringing a huge amount of experience and stability and becoming the bedrock of the firm’s future plans.\n\nWe look forward to the challenges and opportunities 2022 will undoubtedly bring and wish you a very happy New Year."
