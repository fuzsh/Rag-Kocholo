        "text": "Green Mountain Care Board approves double-digit increase in health insurance premiums for third year in row\n\nIn 2025, annual premiums for Vermont Health Connect marketplace plans for individuals and small groups will be allowed to increase an average of at least 11.1% and as much as 22.8%, depending on the insurer and type of plan.\n\nIncumbents survive Vermont’s most closely watched state Senate primaries\n\nUnofficial results in the Chittenden Central district suggested the three incumbents had fended off a challenge from a former broadcast journalist in the Democratic primary.\n\nLeslie J. Matthews: Health care costs rise, access to affordable care diminishes and our leaders fail us\n\nThe refusal to act in the face of this crisis may seem abstract, but in fact, it amounts to policy violence that causes unnecessary suffering.\n\nKaren Horn: Our education funding system is overdue for an overhaul\n\nReports and commissions are not actions.\n\nRoger Brown: How are our public institutions being led?\n\nAre they focusing on improving the lives of those they serve, or on improving their administrators’ chances of “moving up”?\n\nBella Bennett and Paul Bierman: A solution to landslide risk in Burlington\n\nFor safety’s sake, it’s time to invest in preventing further slope failures along Riverside Avenue."
