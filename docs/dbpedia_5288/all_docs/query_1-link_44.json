        "text": "The importance of financial planning\n\nOur private client lawyers will discuss how you can pass any property you leave so the maximum goes to your family and friends and the minimum to the tax man!\n\nLooking at how your property will pass on death is also the moment to look at your financial plans more generally. Our solicitors don’t give investment advice but they can point you in the direction of an independent financial advisor (IFA). This is the help you need to keep and grow your assets to pass on to your loved ones.\n\nReferral to a financial advisor\n\nThere are two kinds of financial advisor. Some are IFAs who are required to search the whole market for products, which might be suitable for your needs as well as every different type of asset.\n\nOn the other hand there are restricted advisors who will consider a select range of investment products and providers.\n\nWe will always refer you to an IFA. However in some circumstances a restricted advisor may be the right fit. We will tell you if we are referring you to a restricted advisor.\n\nIf there is any financial interest on behalf of the firm in referring you to an advisor we must tell you: remember we are regulated to protect you as our client!\n\nHow are we regulated?\n\nThe firm is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority and not by the Financial Conduct Authority. So, we can help you put in place an investment strategy and any associated tax advice once you have received advice from an independent financial advisor (IFA).\n\nWe can:-\n\nintroduce you to an IFA who can give advice on types of investments such as shares or stock, government securities, insurance contracts, mortgages, deposit bank accounts, rights under a funeral plan contract or debenture\n\nhelp you arrange deals on the advice of an IFA as long as we are not advising you on the investment itself.\n\nmanage investments as a trustee of personal representatives. This allows us to make arrangements to look after and safeguard investments. We can charge for our time\n\nsave and sell assets in the process of managing the estate person who has died.\n\nRemember, if we receive any financial benefit from a referral to a financial adviser like an IFA we are always open about this.\n\nIn carrying out investment management for you or your trustees/personal representatives we cannot:-\n\nEngage in market making and dealing\n\nOperate a regulated collective investment scheme\n\nAdvise you to become a member of a particular Lloyds (insurance) Syndicate\n\nManage a Stakeholder Pension Scheme\n\nWe can help in obtaining insurance but with limitations.\n\nWe are subject to the Conduct of Business Rules\n\nWhere we help with investment activity there are safeguards:-\n\nWe keep records of commissions\n\nSystems to safeguard assets:-\n\nRegistering assets in the client’s name\n\nRecording the title of documents held and looking after the documents\n\nKeeping a central record of documents held\n\nChecking records against title documents at least once a year\n\nReporting to clients at least once a year on title documents held\n\nAcknowledging the receipt of property where assets are passed to a third party; if you instruct us to do this we need this to be in writing\n\nCALL US TODAY\n\nCall us now on 0808 256 2917 for a confidential and no obligation initial discussion or email [email protected].\n\nResponsibilities of IFAs\n\nWhen we refer you to an IFA we do so knowing that they are strictly regulated.\n\nThe advisor (IFA) must know their clients\n\nThis involves getting all relevant and personal financial details from the client. Then the adviser must determine the suitability of investments for your particular needs.\n\nInformation gathered is:-\n\nname, address, occupation, date of birth and retirement as well as marital status and employment status.\n\nDetails of family such as spouse, civil partner, children and grandchildren.\n\nDetails of any gifts made previously (which can have a tax impact) and whether outright or in trust.\n\nWhether there is a Will in place.\n\nUnder the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 there is a requirement to identify not only the client but beneficial owners such as under a Trust\n\nan individual who has an interest in 25% of Trust property or more\n\nthe type of person for whom the Trust is set up\n\nwho has control over the Trust.\n\nIn terms of financial details the IFA needs to know:\n\nCurrent assets and liabilities\n\nCurrent income and expenditure.\n\nIn looking at the assets held the advisor will be considering whether the assets are held in ’safe‘ forms such as bank or building society deposits. Such savings may be secure but low interest means inflation takes its toll.\n\nInvestments in high yielding income investments may provide a good income but with greater risk. You may also be bumped into a higher tax bracket, 45% in some case.\n\nThe IFA will also consider protection such as life insurance. Sometimes this is for particular needs such as repayment of a mortgage, income on retirement or to cover school fees.\n\nThe advisor will also consider if an occupational pension or personal pension scheme is in place and/or is that you are paying the necessary national insurance contributions to ensure you get a State pension. You might also have a top up state pension known as the State Earnings Related Pension.\n\nIn addition to personal pension schemes occupational schemes are now provided by employers under the Government Auto Enrolment Rules, which mean that most employees are within a pension scheme to which both they and their actual employer make a contribution.\n\nSince 2001 a number of people have also been in Stakeholder Pension Schemes, which are a low cost and flexible personal pension.\n\nThe advisor will talk about the tax benefits of being in a pension scheme.\n\nAnother issue for the advisor to discuss are assets which only one spouse holds. It is worth looking at options for joint ownership to protect a surviving spouse and tax implications.\n\nFactors for an IFA to consider in developing an investment strategy are:-\n\nAge:If you are in your 20s or 30s you may have a cash shortage and need to keep their cash aside as a cushion but saving early has the benefit of long term growth\n\nIn middle age you may need maximum capital growth for pensions but still be burdened by the cost of school and university fees.\n\nAt retirement you may have fewer commitments and might want income rather than growth. You might get a tax free capital sum from your pension and want to know how to invest it.\n\nIf you are an older client will need to take the best advantage of personal tax allowances.\n\nYou need to consider what happens if you lose mental capacity to make decisions. A Lasting Power of Attorney is advisable to cover this eventuality because otherwise decisions for your welfare will be delayed\n\nPortfolio Planning\n\nA financial advisor will look at the following needs:-\n\nCash which is easily available, typically saved in a Bank or Building Society\n\nEnsuring that proper protection is in place through life assurance\n\nPension\n\nLonger term investments with other spare cash\n\nThe risk level of different types of investment.\n\nLow risk investments are saving accounts, Government stocks and National Savings.\n\nMedium risk could be Unit Trusts, Investment Trusts, shares in public companies, loans to companies, financial institutions and local authorities.\n\nHigher risk (but possible higher return) are shares in small public companies and private companies, works of art and woodland.\n\nIs the investment for a short term or a long term goal?\n\nLong term: capital growth is important\n\nShort term: income is important\n\nDifferent savings types have different tax implications."
