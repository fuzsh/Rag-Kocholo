        "text": "I recommend TM Solicitors\n\nI was in need of a lawyer and when I contacted Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, I got a response right away. I was represented by Reshma and Ellie. Both were very diligent in my case. I was very pleased with their work, I would recommend TM Solicitors to anyone looking for a divorce lawyer/financial settlement lawyer\n\nDate of experience : April 05, 2024\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Family Law\n\nThank you very much for your positive review and recommendation.

We're delighted to hear you were so pleased with the service provided by Reshma and Ellie - they will be delighted with your feedback!\n\nRanjana Nair is thorough, efficient, supportive and trustworthy. She made the process smooth and simple!\n\nI instructed Ranjana Nair for my divorce proceedings. The initial meeting with Ranjana was so lovely, she made me feel listened to and explained all the steps as to how she could help me clearly and efficiently. She responded to every e-Mail or call promptly and constantly kept me in the loop with how the process was going. She truly gave me so much peace of mind , this has been an amazing experience. I would highly recommend TM and Ranjana specifically. Thank you so much for your dedication and work\n\nDate of experience : March 15, 2024\n\nThe customer service was reliable, and efficient\n\nThe customer service was reliable, efficient and friendly. The legal advice received was good, and reflected in court. The approach was inline with how I wished to go about things. The lead on the case was available for phone calls, and easily contactable. Support staff kept the flow of documents going, and covered when the lead person was away. The Barristers recommended acted professionally, worked hard on the day in court, and were on the ball. Although a lengthy procedure, a final fair and successful result.\n\nDate of experience : August 28, 2023\n\nHollie has been fabulous\n\nHollie has been fabulous helping me through a difficult and devastating time. Always there when I needed advice and so helpful, sensitive and understanding. She always made me feel at ease and I could not have got through it all without her. Anyone at Thomas Mansfield Family Law, who worked with, or alongside Hollie, that contacted me or dealt with my case from day 1, were all so lovely. I would highly recommend this firm.\n\nDate of experience : September 03, 2021\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Family Law\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write such a positive recommendation. Hollie will be delighted with this feedback and we are pleased to have been able to support you in this difficult period.\n\nInitial meeting\n\nFrom the minute i walked through the door i was greeted with a warm welcome and a lovely cup of tea, this helped put me at ease during a meeting that potentially was very daunting and difficult.\n\nSusi during our first meeting was super kind, listened intently and offered very professional and informative advice. For an initial free meeting I came away so much more informed than i could have expected. Thank you!\n\nDate of experience : March 27, 2023\n\nExplained clearly and in detail\n\nMartina clearly and in detail understood my situation and explained the possible options available to me. This was very reassuring and gave me confidence that every aspect had been considered and that all possible options were available.\n\nDate of experience : April 26, 2024\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Family Law\n\nThank you for your review. We're glad to hear that Martina was able to help you understand your options clearly. It's important to us that you feel confident and supported, and we're pleased to have been able to assist you.\n\nI was fortunate to retain Louise…\n\nI was fortunate to retain Louise Minifie to handle my divorce.All through the process Louise exercised patience, focus and intelligence in assessing the route to follow. She at all times attempted to proceed calmly always mindful of costs.\n\nHer judgment is excellent particularly when as is often the case emotions lead to poor outcomes. I cannot recommend her more highly. She is a credit to her colleagues and a delight to deal with.\n\nGerry Aherne\n\nDate of experience : February 03, 2022\n\nThe service I have received from Kate…\n\nThe service I have received from Kate Rayner my lawyer and Susan O’Reilly from Thomas Mansfield has been second to none! Their professional and kind approach to my matter has been such an weight off my shoulders and reassurance. Kate has kept me upto date on everything and has been a massive support when I felt that there is no hope. I would recommend their services time and time again.\n\nDate of experience : March 07, 2023\n\nDivorce solicitor.\n\nAlice was kind, understanding and patient. She listened to me and took time to find out how she could best help me. She encouraged me to find a resolution through mediation, that would limit the cost to me and result in the quickest final result. If you are looking for a solicitor who is keen to find a quick but fair and just resolution, with an open and honest approach to the costs, Alice is your lady.\n\nDate of experience : October 16, 2021\n\nAnthony Kiernan (Solicitor & Barrister)…\n\nAnthony Kiernan (Solicitor & Barrister) of Thomas Mansfield Solicitors was referred to me by a friend of mine. That friend happened to be a retired family court officer and knew all the lawyers available. I told him that I need the best lawyer possible as I was being sued by me ex., who had hired a solicitor (Big Named Firm). I thought I could handle legals on my own; boy was I wrong! Long story short, Anthony, because of his experience was able to get me the settlement I wanted for about half the price of what my ex's law fees were. Anthony ran rings around my wife's hired barrister in court. His 30+years experience and knowledge of the family court system surely worked in my favor!\n\nThank You Anthony!\n\nDate of experience : November 21, 2019\n\nTerrible service\n\nTerrible service. I was very clear on what help I needed with at initial contact. All they were interested in was getting the initial consultation fee out of you and then surprisingly after the meeting didn't want to help. Would not recommend at all!\n\nDate of experience : November 02, 2021\n\nKate Rayner and her team managed my divorce\n\nKate Rayner and her team managed my divorce. If anyone tells you that there’s such a thing as an amicable divorce, forget it, it’s a myth.\n\nKate and her team are no nonsense and understanding. They smoothly navigated me through the turmoil. Advice is what you need when under such a stressful time and Kate doesn’t disappoint.\n\nKate is empathetic, to the point and efficient, at the same time as being on your side. Which is important when you’re going through all this emotional mess.\n\nThe terms of business are clear and it’s easy to make payment.\n\nI can’t recommend Kate highly enough. When the proverbial s*** hits the fan. You need a calm, clear, efficient and experienced professional at the helm.\n\nThank you Kate you have been all of those things.\n\nRob.\n\nDate of experience : March 24, 2023\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Family Law\n\nDear Rob\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write such a positive recommendation. Kate and the team are delighted with your feedback and we are pleased to have been able to support you throughout this difficult period.\n\nKind regards\n\nClaire\n\nClient Care Manager\n\nProfessional service.\n\nI required urgent legal advice regarding very personal and private matters surrounding my young son. Abi immediately rescheduled her day and arranged an hours consultation. This ended up taking two hours but I never felt pressured or hurried. Abi was very understanding, patient and compassionate. She put me at ease throughout and explained everything as we went along with honesty and transparency. A very professional service throughout.\n\nDate of experience : January 31, 2023\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Family Law\n\nHi Rob\n\nThank you for sharing your positive feedback and for taking the time to leave us a review. Going through a divorce can be very difficult but I am pleased that your experience of Thomas Mansfield has been such a positive one.\n\nClaire - Client Care at Thomas Mansfield\n\nI thought Thomas Mansfield team were…\n\nI thought Thomas Mansfield team were very professional and understanding.\n\nAnything I was not sure of I only had to ask and whether email or phone call they were always ready to help.\n\nDate of experience : February 27, 2023\n\nCommunication was key\n\nThe initial free consultation was the draw card for me, and i was worried it would be rushed and was just a tool to get my business, however this was not the case. The consultation was very informative and i was able to get all my concerns and questions across without feeling i was on a timer. Communication was always excellent and the timezone difference was always considered. Found all the staff i had dealings were very professional and approachable. I would highly recommend Thomas Mansfield Family Law.\n\nDate of experience : April 21, 2022"
