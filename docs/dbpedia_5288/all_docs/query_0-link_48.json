It has an existing sales office and showroom on Mockingbird Lane in Dallas.\n\nCrystal has been tapped for a $3.15 million Texas Enterprise Fund grant, in addition to a $15,000 Veteran Created Job bonus.\n\n“‘Made in Texas’ is a powerful global brand, and I congratulate Crystal Window and Door Systems on this significant investment in our great state,” said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement.\n\nThe company was founded in New York City in 1990 by Thomas Chen and has since grown to five manufacturing facilities across the country.\n\n“They say, ‘When God closes a door, he opens a window,’ but I believe this partnership is a wide open door and window for Mansfield and the state of Texas,” Mansfield Mayor Michael Evans said. “This is economic development in action, and it would not be possible without the hard work of city and state staff showing why Mansfield and Texas are where businesses want to be.”\n\nThe city of Mansfield and its economic development arm previously approved an agreement with Crystal to incentivize the company’s entrance that includes tax breaks."
