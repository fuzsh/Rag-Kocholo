        "text": "MANSFIELD, OH –Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) visited the 179th Mansfield Airlift Wing before heading to Mansfield’s North Central Ohio Industrial Museum for a tour.\n\n“The 179th Airlift Wing and the North Central Ohio Industrial Museum illustrate the way the base and local industry work together and how they can both drive innovation and job growth,” said Brown.\n\nBrown has continually worked to bring jobs to the Mansfield Base and advocated for its selection for the new Cyber Warfare Mission. The Cyber Warfare Wing will create 180 new jobs and put Mansfield in the middle of the military’s cutting-edge cyber capability.\n\nThe Industrial Museum opened its doors in July and highlights Mansfield’s historic past and its role in the next generation of industry in North Central Ohio.\n\n“The selection by the Air Force for the 179th Airlift Wing to take on the Cyber Warfare Wing (CWW) is confirmation the Air Force has confidence in our wings ability to execute this new and very important capability for our Department of Defense. Since 1948, the 179th has demonstrated its ability to ‘get the job done,’ and there is no doubt that it will perform this new cyber mission with the same level of excellence. We also thank Senator Brown, our other legislators and our community for their long-standing support of the 179th,” said Rich Green, Brig. Gen. (Ret.) and Chair of Mansfield Military Affairs Council.\n\n“We are extremely proud of the 179th and their long and successful flight history. We are equally excited to see them take on this new mission as a Cyber Warfare Wing and to bring these future facing jobs to Mansfield. This exciting news is a result of a long collaborative effort from partners at the local, state and federal levels and the current base leadership. Thanks to all involved,” said Barrett Thomas of the Richland Chamber of Commerce."
