        "text": "Thomas E. Rutledge is a member of our business services group in Louisville. A graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was a law review editor, he has been with Stoll Keenon Ogden or one of its predecessor firms since graduating law school.\n\n“In 1991 I read a short article about limited liability companies, then a brand new organizational form, and thought they looked interesting and that I should spend some time getting to know them. It may fairly be said that things might have gotten out of hand.“\n\nTom brings to the task at hand, whether it is advising on how to form a particular business, drafting contracts between business organizations, or advising litigators on the substantive law of business organizations, contracts, agency, and numerous other legal disciplines, his deep understanding of their inter-relationships. He will often ask “Why do you want to know?” because the answer may depend on whether you want to know for federal tax versus state law matters or whether your question arises in the context of a corporation or a partnership.\n\nTom not only applies the law but has created it. He has written as part of a committee but more often solo numerous of Kentucky’s statutes governing business forms. At the national level he has guided the law of business organizations through the Section of Business Law of the American Bar Association, as a Uniform Law Commissioner and as an elected member of the American Law Institute. He is as well the author of numerous law review articles and of several books, most notably Ribstein and Keatinge on Limited Liability Companies (in 2018 he took the place of the late Professor Ribstein) and Keatinge and Conaway on Choice of Business Entity.\n\nWorking both with SKO’s litigators and with other firms as an expert witness he has helped guide litigation as to matters of formation, agency, fiduciary obligation and the effects of dissolution. Bringing his knowledge of the innumerable cases that have arisen, he writes agreements, especially LLC operating agreements, that address and avoid the disputes that others have (often at great expense) litigated.\n\nMost recently he has focused his energies on understanding the Corporate Transparency Act and assisting clients in complying with this (maddening) new law.\n\nBusiness Services: Tom’s practice is substantially concentrated on providing counsel on the structure of various commercial enterprises, helping clients decide whether their ventures should be organized as a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or other organizational form. Having helped clients make that decision, he prepares the organizational documents for the venture and, as it develops over time, advises and drafts with respect to document amendments.\n\nDisputes Amongst Business Owners: Tom regularly works with the Business Litigators here at SKO and with other firms on a consulting basis as to disputes between business owners and the application of both the venture’s organizational documents and the underlying law. He as well serves as an expert witness on matters involving the operation of corporations and LLCs, including the fiduciary duties that arise under those organizational forms.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions: Tom advises clients on a variety of complex transactions involving reorganization, refinancing, purchase, and sale. This experience includes working with the SKO team that regularly counsels clients with respect to ESOP transactions.\n\nGovernance: Tom regularly advises clients with respect to the negotiation of limited liability company operating agreements, shareholder buy-sell agreements, and similar documents governing the organization of various ventures. Tom has a particular skill set in this area, having served as a member of the committee that drafted the Kentucky Limited Liability Company Act, amendments to the Kentucky Business Corporation Act, and has served as the principal drafter of other acts and statutory amendments, including Kentucky’s Partnership, Limited Partnership and Limited Cooperative Association Acts."
