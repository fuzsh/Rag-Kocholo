        "text": "Since then we’ve recruited Emma Howlett who came from leading Tunbridge Wells firm Thomson Snell & Passmore and specialises in probate and applications to the Court of Protection. The depth of experience we have is now being recognised and reflects the quality and quantity of new client enquiries in Tunbridge Wells, the South East and in London.\n\nThe family law department has continued to expand, and in 2019 we opened up a family law department in London where we are meeting clients in five locations including Mayfair and Chelsea, Canary Wharf and the City. Since 06 January 2020 we are offering family law advice from our new office location in Guildford. Kate Denham, family law solicitor with more than 20 years’ experience and who was previously the head of branch for our nearest competitor is providing family law advice to local clients in Guildford and also meeting clients in Basingstoke, Farnborough, Woking, Weybridge, Esher and Leatherhead.\n\nWe have experienced a tremendous response for our services in January so far and we hope this will continue through the year as the quality and depth of experience of the family and private client teams become known in the local communities. We are a modern law firm competing with some very well established firms of solicitors but the demand for our services speaks for itself, as do the very positive client feedback we enjoy.”"
