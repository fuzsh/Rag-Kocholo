        "text": "Jenna Ide is Associate Solicitor at Thomas Mansfield. She graduated with a (BA) Jurisprudence from Merton College, Oxford University, in 2007.\n\nWhat made you decide to become a solicitor?\n\nI carried out some work experience at a local solicitors’ firm while I was at school and went on to study A-Level Law at college. I really enjoyed learning about all of the different types of law, and thought that it would be great to keep my options open in this way whilst pursuing a subject that was intellectually challenging and technical.\n\nDescribe your typical day.\n\nI start my day by reviewing my emails and drawing up a to-do list. I work out which tasks are the priorities for the day, before starting work on the most urgent. I have to juggle lots of matters at once – every day I receive many calls from clients, often when I am in the middle of working on a different matter. I also regularly attend client meetings either in person at our London office or over the telephone. Much of the work is of an urgent nature, so I have to be flexible about when my day ends!\n\nWhat is your favourite part of your job?\n\nMy favourite part of the job is having the opportunity to help clients reach their goal, whether that is a good settlement or winning a tribunal case.\n\nWhat is the most challenging part of your job?\n\nI often have to deal with vulnerable clients, such as those with severe depression. I am not a counsellor, so I have to rely on other professionals to help my clients in that respect.\n\nWhat was the turning point in your career?\n\nMy recent success in the dyslexia Starbucks case has been a real turning point. It is my first case which has generated a huge amount of publicity and has helped to raise awareness of dyslexia.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years’ time?\n\nIn 5 years’ time I hope to be a Senior Associate who is approaching partner-level. I aspire to be listed in the legal directories such as the Legal 500."
