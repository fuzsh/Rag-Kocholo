        "text": "MANSFIELD – A convergence of railroad lines made Mansfield a manufacturing hub, starting 175 years ago.\n\nThat’s what one founder of the North Central Ohio Industrial Museum told listeners during a presentation of the Mansfield-Richland County library.\n\nMansfield was on the main line of three major railroads — the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore & Ohio and the Erie — Jerry Miller, museum president, told listeners at the Mansfield/Richland County Public Library lecture series scheduled for the weeks the “Discover Tech” exhibit was installed at the library.\n\nThe Mansfield area has been a manufacturing hub for for more than 175 years, Miller said.\n\nThe new museum is a continuation of efforts begun by Bob Glaesner, who collected the last appliances taken off-line when Westinghouse shut down its Mansfield factory in the 1980s.\n\nWith help from the late Ed Meehan and Jack Pollock, organizers got together to create a museum dedicated specifically to the city’s strong manufacturing history.\n\nThe museum is making its home in space at Mansfield’s old state prison, under a partnership with the Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society.\n\n“What we’re doing at the museum is just providing a center to collect these items. If you know anybody who’s got more artifacts, don’t let them throw them in the Dumpster,” Miller told listeners.\n\nOrganizers have raised $130,000 of the $165,000 needed for the museum’s start-up, through donations from area industry, he said.\n\nRenovations are underway to remove lead paint from portions of the prison — using a dry ice system that helps dissipate the paint — and take other steps needed to build space to display manufacturing products and memorabilia, Miller said.\n\nOnce the museum is up and running, the Reformatory Society will turn over to the Industrial Museum a percentage of reformatory tour ticket sales, allowing the museum an operating budget, he said.\n\nMansfield first became an important manufacturing hub because it was criss-crossed by three major railroads, bringing a means for shipping in raw materials to factories, and shipping out finished products, Miller said. “That’s the key that brought manufacturing to our little town,” he said.\n\nOver the decades the area produced a wide range of products, including steam threshers, kitchen appliances, Chaintop Perfection Bed Spring Co., crackers and biscuits.\n\nMansfield’s first industrialist was Daniel McFarland “D.M.” Cook, who produced portable sugar evaporators to make sugar from sorghum at a time during the Civil War when the north was cut off from its usual supply of sugar produced in the South.\n\nCook, who lived on Cook Road in Mansfield, acquired several patents during the late 1800s. He announcing in 1859 that he was constructing a large flying machine, called Queen of the Air, which he intended to fly cross-country. Cook also attempted to invent a light bulb prior to Thomas Edison’s success.\n\nCigar-making was big business here, with several companies operating in Mansfield, often employing minors. Hautzenroeder was one of the larger cigar-making operations, Miller said.\n\nSteel became an important local industry in Richland County.\n\nShelby Tube, one of the large steel companies, produced tube steel — but also had a sideline manufacturing bicycles, Miller said.\n\nCompany founder Col. D.L. Cockley lived from 1843 to 1901 and won a Congressional Medal of Honor in the Civil War. Cockley bought rights to a process for making steel tubing. He was able to apply that to the new craze of bicycling, which became popular in the 1890s, Miller said.\n\nIn 1908, a major fire broke out in the Shelby steel plant. Despite fire engines being called out from around the county, the factory was destroyed. “Seven hundred people were without jobs. The whole town got together and raised money (to rebuild) because the company decided it wasn’t going to start over,” Miller said.\n\nMartin Steel, at Longview and Mulberry near the railroad tracks, made rolled steel used in World War II, he said.\n\nThe Mansfield area produced a wide array of appliances, lanterns and other items for everyday use in homes during the 20th century.\n\nTappan, originally founded in Bellaire, Ohio, “came here early on,” making stoves and eventually other kitchen appliances, Miller said. In World War I, the company produced a field kitchen for use in the war effort. “They built a galley for the Goodyear airships,” he added.\n\nDominion Electric became one of the largest small appliance manufacturers. Its products included the Electrohot Waffle Iron, Miller said.\n\nManufacturing remains an important part of the north central Ohio economy.\n\nAt least 60 manufacturers are in operation in this area “and we’re doing some amazing things,” Miller said.\n\nAmerican Auger in Ashland, for example, got involved in the fracking boom. “They can drill a mile down and hit a spot exactly, 3 miles away,” Miller said.\n\nMiller, who owns Miller Metal Manufacturing, told a series of stories about local inventors who put their creativity and technical skills to work, in the decades since World War II.\n\nThat included an uncle “who decided with another guy to build a concrete sailboat,” just to show it could be done, he said.\n\nManufacturing artifacts are an important part of local history collections, Miller said, noting the Mansfield Memorial Museum (also known as Soldiers and Sailors Museum) houses Elektro, the 75-year-old robot made by Westinghouse.\n\nThe North Central Ohio Industrial Museum has become a member of RichHistory Alliance, a coalition of museums and local history groups which hopes to work toward cooperative projects, Miller said. That could include creating a weekend to celebrate local history — which would allow area families to tour this area’s many museums, at open houses or special events, Miller said.\n\nEighteen museums or local history groups are members of the alliance, he said.\n\nlmartz@gannett.com\n\n419-521-7229"
