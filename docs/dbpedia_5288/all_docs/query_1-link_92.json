        "text": "WELLSBORO — Sentencing for the suspended state trooper found guilty in May of vehicular homicide has been continued and instead a hearing will be held on a defense motion to vacate the verdict and grant a new trial.\n\nThe April 9 evidentiary hearing in Tioga County will be on Michael Brown’s allegation of misconduct by four of the jurors including the foreperson.\n\nSpecially assigned Columbia County Senior Judge Thomas A. James denied a defense motion to subpoena the four jurors for the hearing. But he said he will allow argument on the necessity of issuing subpoenas."
