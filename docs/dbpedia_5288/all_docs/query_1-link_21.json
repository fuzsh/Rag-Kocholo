        "text": "Specialist law firm, Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, has extended its range of services with the recruitment of new partner, Paula Kumar, the former head of Dispute Resolution and Employment at Ignition Law, a leading law firm focused on start-ups, scale-ups and entrepreneurs.\n\nThomas Mansfield Solicitors has grown steadily since it was set up in 2004 and this latest expansion reflects increasing market demand for litigation and dispute resolution services, in addition to the firm’s existing corporate and private clients.\n\nPaula joins the firm as Head of Dispute Resolution. She will work alongside Consultant, Paul Thomas, who recently secured one of the most significant judgments on costs in 20 years, in an ongoing bitter private equity partnership dispute between Melford Capital Partners (Holdings) LLP and Others and Frederick John Wingfield Digby.\n\nPaula specialises in complex commercial, employment and media disputes. She advises on shareholder and director disputes, breach of contract, unfair dismissal, discrimination, enforcement of restrictive covenants, copyright and trademark infringement and breach of confidentiality. Paula advises a wide range of high profile private and corporate clients including high net worth individuals, SMEs, financial institutions, law firms, retail chains, charities, artists and galleries, song artist managers, international songwriters and producers, senior executives and media professionals and organisations."
