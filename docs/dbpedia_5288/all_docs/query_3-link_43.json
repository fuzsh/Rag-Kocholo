        "text": "For more than a century, Parker Poe has represented many of the Southeast’s largest companies and local governments in transactions, regulatory issues, and complex litigation. Our attorneys have extensive experience representing clients in the education, energy, financial services, government, health care, life sciences, manufacturing, real estate, sports and entertainment, and technology industries. Parker Poe has more than 275 attorneys serving clients from eight offices in Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Charleston, Columbia, Greenville, and Spartanburg, South Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; and Washington, DC.\n\nLawyers in each of our offices are rated among the highest quality attorneys across their respective states, recognized for effective and efficient service. The Best Lawyers in America lists over 100 of our attorneys in its rankings, and we are also well-recognized by U.S. News & World Report, Chambers USA, and other ratings publications.\n\nCompetitive Fees\n\nIndependent surveys by financial, accounting, and research organizations rate Parker Poe among the top law firms for high-value, quality service. Research by PwC reveals our rates to be in the midrange of competing firms, both regionally and nationally.\n\nQuality Service\n\nService satisfaction research by Altman Weil and BTI identify Parker Poe among the leaders in client satisfaction and loyalty. For over a decade, Parker Poe has been consistently named to the BTI Client Service A-Team, which is the gold standard used by law firms and corporate counsel to measure client service.\n\nOngoing, independent surveys of the largest clients of Parker Poe find service satisfaction scores average higher than 9.0 on a 10-point scale. These surveys of nearly 20 top clients have found that every study participant values Parker Poe's service and attorneys, would recommend Parker Poe, and would consider our firm for service in additional legal areas.\n\nCivic Engagement\n\nCommunity service is ingrained in our culture at Parker Poe. Our lawyers have served as mayors, city attorneys, state legislators, and Supreme Court justices. They have served on boards of universities and K-12 schools. They have been elected as presidents of the state bar and state and local bar associations. Members of our firm – lawyers and business professionals – have also been deeply involved in charitable and arts organizations. These commitments are part of how we seek a better future for our clients, our community, and each other.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nParker Poe recognizes that promoting diversity is not only the right thing to do – it is essential to the success of the firm, our lawyers, business professionals, and clients. Creating an environment where people from various backgrounds feel welcome and respected leads to creative ideas and new perspectives, thus enriching the practice of law."
