        "text": "In 2014 the government introduced a fee for employment tribunal claims, which had quite a negative impact on our business in 2015/16 and made us think about spreading our risk profile.\n\nI always thought family law would do well in Tunbridge Wells. Although there are many firms of solicitors not many purely specialise in family law so I saw an opportunity. In 2017, we recruited Susi Gillespie, a very experienced family lawyer to target the Kent commuter towns. Later, we employed Anthony Kiernan followed by Alice Scambler, both very experienced family lawyers.\n\nIn February 2018, we opened an office in Tunbridge Wells and the business took off. We have also hired two family solicitors for our London office. In 2017 the Supreme Court overturned the government’s decision to introduce employment tribunal fees so now both aspects of our business are thriving.\n\nThis year we are looking to open an office in Guildford and establish a new department specialising in wills and probate. Much of our success has been down to getting involved in the local business community and I’m happy to say it’s thriving in Tunbridge Wells.”"
