        "text": "CHICAGO (October 20, 2022)â€”Perkins Coie is pleased to announce it has achieved Mansfield 5.0 Certification Plus from Diversity Lab, which measures how leading law firms have affirmatively considered women, lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers, and lawyers with disabilities for recruitment, equity partner promotions, and management positions, among other significant benchmarks.\n\nTo achieve Mansfield 5.0 Certification Plus, law firms have to collaborate closely with Diversity Lab over a 12-month assessment period that includes a detailed review of their diversity and inclusion policies and practices.\n\n\"Diversity Lab's work is important in helping to improve diversity and inclusion within the legal industry, and we're honored to once again receive this recognition for our ongoing commitment and work,\" said Genhi Givings Bailey, Perkins Coie's chief diversity & inclusion officer. \"We're pleased with our continued progress to improve diversity across our firm, from our most junior lawyers to our senior management teams; however, we know there is much more work to be done to advance DEI priorities and we remain engaged in that work.\"\n\nDiverse women leaders constitute almost half of the firm's Management Committee and Executive Committee, respectively. Perkins Coie's 2022 partner class was 64% diverse and inclusive of women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people, and the incoming associate class is 83% diverse.\n\nAt Perkins Coie, the Mansfield Rule builds on the firm's \"Perkins Rule,\" which seeks to include lawyers of color, LGBTQ+ lawyers, and lawyers with disabilities in the candidate pool for lateral hiring opportunities."
