        "text": "Employment Law Specialist Sectors\n\nAs the burden of regulation and compliance grows ever more complex, you need professional advisors who don’t just understand employment and health and safety law inside out, but also have an in-depth knowledge of best practice and risk management in your specific sector. As a client of Thomas Mansfield you will get both.\n\nBecause we are a niche firm specialising in employment and health and safety you will benefit from our broad understanding of current issues and recent case law across the UK, and can be confident you are receiving the highest quality of legal advice. At the same time, however, our solicitors are assigned to specialist industry groups so that they can focus on the areas relevant to you, giving you practical solutions that reflect industry norms and keeping you up to date with trends and developments important to your sector. For more information about our dedicated sector teams and what we can do for you, please click on one of the links.\n\nAs well as a first class legal service, our clients receive regular sector specific updates, and we run regular workshops focused on particular industries and associated legal issues. These aren’t just a useful forum where our solicitors can get to know you and your concerns better, but many of our clients find attending one of our workshops extremely useful for networking with other industry players, sharing good practice and discussing common ground."
