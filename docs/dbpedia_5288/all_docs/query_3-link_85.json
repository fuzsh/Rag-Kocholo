        "text": "For the fifth consecutive year, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck achieved Mansfield Certification from the Diversity Lab, which acknowledges its commitment to leading the charge toward greater diversity and inclusion in the legal industry. The firm was further recognized with the “Plus” designation for the third year in a row.\n\nMansfield aims to increase and sustain diversity in leadership within law firms by broadening the pool of women lawyers, LGBTQ+ lawyers, lawyers with disabilities and underrepresented racial and/or ethnic lawyers who are considered for senior lateral attorney job openings, firm governance opportunities, equity partner promotions and firm leadership positions. Firms must also create and publish job descriptions and appointment/election policies for leadership roles. To achieve Mansfield 5.0 Certification Plus, Brownstein collaborated with Diversity Lab over a 12-month period with built-in measurement, transparency and accountability mechanisms.\n\n“We are proud to achieve Mansfield 5.0 Certification Plus reflecting our continued commitment to public accountability and measurement in our ongoing quest to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture at Brownstein,” said Ali Metzl, the firm’s chair of diversity, inclusion and equity and founder and co-chair of Brownstein’s Women’s Leadership Initiative.\n\nBrownstein will continue to partner with Diversity Lab and has signed on to participate in the 6.0 cohort.\n\nIn addition to the firm’s Mansfield recognition, Brownstein has recently been recognized for a variety of diversity efforts, including receiving a perfect score on the 2022 Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, ranking fourth on Law 360’s 2022 Ceiling Smashers list for firms (251‒600 attorneys) with the highest representation of women in their equity partnerships and being named as one of Seramount’s 2022 “Best Law Firms for Women.”"
