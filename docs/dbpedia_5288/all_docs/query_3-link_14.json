        "text": "MANSFIELD, La. (KSLA) - A pipe and tube manufacturer based out of India is opening its first U.S. facility in northwest Louisiana.\n\nOn Thursday, April 4, Global Seamless Tubes & Pipes, a manufacturer and exporter of carbon, alloy, and stainless steel cold drawn and hot finish seamless tubes and pipes, announced it will spend $35 million to establish its first U.S. facility in Mansfield.\n\nGlobal Seamless expects to bring 135 direct new jobs to the area. Louisiana Economic Development anticipates the project will yield 251 indirect new jobs, for a total of 386 potential new jobs in northwest Louisiana.\n\n“LED is dedicated to bringing jobs and economic opportunities to each and every corner of our state,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This investment will promote growth in our rural communities while providing support to Louisiana’s oil and gas industry. I thank Global Seamless for investing in Louisiana and our skilled manufacturing workforce, and for recognizing the competitive advantages our state offers to expanding businesses.”\n\nGlobal Seamless exports its goods in more than 10 different countries. The facility planned in Louisiana will have advanced machinery integrating hot finishing and cold drawn manufacturing processes. The company says this will position them to meet growing demand of North American customers in engineering, oil and gas, and power generation.\n\n“As a natural gas hub and a key player in the international energy supply chain, Louisiana is a natural choice for our second production facility, our first in the Western Hemisphere,” Global Seamless President A.R. Biswas said. “Global Seamless is dedicated to providing our customers with high-quality services and products, and this new plant will allow us to better serve those customers with a local supply chain.”\n\nThe company says seamless tubes and pipes are better able to withstand high pressure and highly corrosive environments, like those found in the oil and gas industry.\n\n“The DeSoto Parish Police Jury is excited that Global Seamless Tubes & Pipes will be revitalizing the former Hensley facility in DeSoto Parish to manufacture their product,” DeSoto Parish Police Jury Parish Administrator Michael Norton said. “This project will breathe new life into what was once a thriving manufacturing facility located in Mansfield, and provide our residents with more career opportunities. We look forward to this project and the possibilities it will provide for the community and the good people with Global Seamless Tubes & Pipes.”\n\nThe former Hensley Industries facility will be redesigned so Global Seamless can move in. Commercial operations are expected to begin by the end of 2024.\n\n“I am excited that Global Seamless Tubes & Pipes is establishing a manufacturing facility in Mansfield, the parish seat of DeSoto Parish,” Mansfield Mayor Thomas Jones Jr. said. “This venture will spark our local economy and bring needed quality jobs to this community. We will definitely embrace our new business owners and work with them to make this a smooth transition.”\n\nTo bring Global Seamless to Mansfield, the state offered the company an incentives package including comprehensive workforce development solutions from LED FastStart. The package also included a $1.25 million Performance-Based Matching Grant to be used for the reimbursement of utility, road, and facility improvement expenses. Global Seamless is also expected to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.\n\n“Few things in economic development are more satisfying than bringing back opportunity to an area that has lost jobs and a company,” North Louisiana Economic Partnership CEO Justyn Dixon said. “Doing that with a company like Global Seamless, which is making its first investment into the US here in north Louisiana, is even more exciting. Thanks again to LED and all the leadership in Desoto Parish and Mansfield for helping make this happen.”\n\nClick here to register to be notified about job opportunities at Global Seamless, as well as hiring events and news updates."
