        "text": "Daunted\n\nDaunted, I contacted Thomas Mansfield for advice and support and received both from all whom I encountered in the process. Angie Crush advised me on what my Redundancy situation meant for me and how best to approach it. The support I received greatly reduced my stress and filled me with confidence that I had approached and handled things appropriately. Everything was managed in swift succession and I am rewarded with a successful resolution. Thank you so much Angie and Shaida, I am extremely grateful and wholeheartedly recommend Thomas Mansfield to anyone who is facing any employment law issues. They are extremely knowledgeable and kind and will put your mind at ease.\n\nDate of experience : August 02, 2024\n\nDiscrimination on Shift Allocations\n\nI approached Thomas Mansfield Solicitors with an enquiry for advice on aspects of a few employment scenarios that were of major concern to me and other colleagues.\n\n1. Allocations of shift work that could be construed as Racially Motivated\n\n2. Collusion of other staff members with management to secure those shift allocations.\n\nThey (TMS) acted very quickly indeed and it was clear that the Company had given my enquiry a lot of professional attention. I was advised to direct my enquiry to a specialist solicitor Thomas Corcoran and his support team.\n\nIt must be noted that my enquiry was primarily about a possible course of action and remedy rather than chasing financial loss that had occurred to our group.\n\nThomas contacted me with details of how to proceed which was facilitated through his support team.\n\nI was happy to go-ahead on the terms offered and we had a telephone meeting arranged accordingly.\n\nThomas and I had a very cordial exchange and he covered all aspects of my predicament. It was a very beneficial meeting that was conducted in straightforward language with all avenues of employment law covered in simple cost-benefit analysis.\n\nIt was clear from his advice that taking the case further would be both difficult and financially restrictive.\n\nI took all the advice that Thomas suggested and was able to offer a way forward for my colleagues to reduce the levels of non-provable racial bias could be significantly reduced.\n\nI would highly recommend Thomas Corcoran and his support team to be a first point of call if you have concerns about you/your colleague’s options for remedy in complicated employment situations.\n\nNot only that, because Thomas Mansfield Solicitors have proven their merit to be a trusted source of initial employment law enquiries in that they will cut to the chase and spare you the rod of unnecessary financial expense.\n\nMany thanks to Thomas Corcoran, money well spent!\n\nDate of experience : May 30, 2024\n\nThe service was very fast and…\n\nThe service was very fast and professional. When I first called the firm to explain the issue, i got an appointment very promptly. During the call, Julie was very good at explaining everything I needed to know about the issues and the documents I was about to sign. She was patient and took her time to take me through all the clauses so I was aware of the implications.\n\nI definitely do not mind working with Julie again. I recommend her service.\n\nDate of experience : March 13, 2024\n\nHad an issue regarding employment law\n\nHad an issue regarding employment law, reached out to 5 different law firms and said I needed this to be resolved asap, got the fastest responce by far from TMS and a meeting set up on the same day. (next fastest law firm said they could meet 2 days later). Amandeep Puni explained the process very well and did his best to speed up the process. Ended up getting a much better deal than I expected and any delay was 100% not his fault but due to the other party. Overall very happy with the service I received. Aman was reachable at all times either by email or phone, which was a big relief for me.\n\nDate of experience : January 29, 2024\n\nOutstanding Service - Highly Recommend!\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Kendal on my settlement case, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with the outcome. From start to finish, she demonstrated exceptional professionalism, dedication, and expertise.\n\nKendal guided me through every step of the process, ensuring I understood all my options and making me feel confident in the decisions we made. Her attention to detail and ability to communicate complex legal concepts in a clear and concise manner was truly impressive.\n\nThanks to her hard work and perseverance, we achieved a favorable settlement. Her support and guidance during this challenging time were invaluable, and I am incredibly grateful for her efforts.\n\nI highly recommend Kendal to anyone in need of a skilled and compassionate solicitor. She truly goes above and beyond for her clients.\n\nDate of experience : May 31, 2024\n\nSo far so great\n\nSo far so great, The customer service was outstanding, and the legal representation was above what I was expecting what I was looking for. I was so pleased with the service I received from Thomas Mansfield Solicitors. They went above and beyond to help me avoid a disastrous outcome and continue to diligently work to help me archive a qualitative outcome for my mother’s estate. Special thanks to Alice, Emma, Fin and Dalia. Thank you for all you do to help us get our legal administrations on a straight and narrow.\n\nKeep up the great work🙂\n\nDate of experience : October 06, 2023\n\nI am immensely grateful to Riah Sattar\n\nI am immensely grateful to Riah for her outstanding assistance in drafting a response to a letter before action I received. Her expertise and attention to detail resulted in the other side taking no further action against me. Despite the very short response time, Riah went above and beyond by working out of hours to ensure everything was handled promptly. Throughout the process, Riah was incredibly professional, responsive, and reassuring, providing clear and comprehensive advice. Her skillful handling of my case not only resolved the issue promptly but also alleviated a significant amount of stress for me. I highly recommend Thomas Mansfield Solicitors to anyone in need of top-notch legal representation. Thank you so much for your excellent service!\n\nDate of experience : April 30, 2024\n\nA journey of hope a lesson to learn\n\nWhat I have found I should have really looked at my financial position before starting my journey.\n\nAt all times I was informed of the fee's but as I said before I was not in the position to follow up my case. In the end I had to ask the Solicitor to stop all work on my case.\n\nApart from that I was given advice listening ear I now realise that due to income and not being able to afford the cost.\n\nOut there in the real world people are suffering not being able to tap into representation regarding the law. Various establishments are closed down people in their community are suffering and not being able receive justice.\n\nDate of experience : February 09, 2023"
