        "text": "The Davey name was well established in the steel industry before a group of 8 brothers arrived in Mansfield, Ohio in 1914. Their father, John Davey, began his apprenticeship in the mills of Wales around the age of 18. When his sons came of age, the elder Davey would make them his helpers and teach them the trade. In 1888 Davey came to America and entered the mills here. A short time later his family joined him and his oldest sons, who were already skilled laborers, entered the mills as well. They were first employed at McKeesport, Pennsylvania at the Demmler Bros. Sheet Mill. After six years, they went to Niles, Ohio working for the Falcon Tin Plate Co. William H. Davey would return to McKeesport to become superintendent, with a substantial pay cut, but he felt the experience would be well worth it. William would eventually go to Canton, then Massillon, Ohio where he became associated with A. B. Clark and helped with the construction of the Massillon Rolling Mill Co., where he remained until 1914.[1] It was in Massillon where all the brothers reunited after working in different mills and talks of opening their own plant became serious.\n\nOn June 18, 1914, John Davey Sr. died after spending 47 of his 65 years in the steel business. It was his wish that his family would stay close and work together for the common goal of owning their own plant. It wasn’t long before the dream was realized and, on September 24, 1914, it was announced in the Mansfield News that W. H. Davey and brothers were to purchase the former National Rolling Mill Co. They had the support of the Chamber of Commerce, in particular secretary Edwin G. Slough, who was determined that the Davey brothers should run the Steel plant in Mansfield. The brothers mortgaged their homes and scraped together every cent they could. Their mother, though not thrilled with the idea of being located in Mansfield, risked her last cent as well. The National Rolling Mill Co. had gone bankrupt a few years prior and was currently owned by the American Steel Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The plant was originally built in 1908-09 and formally opened in June of 1909 as the National Sheet Steel Co. A few months later, the company was reorganized as the National Rolling Mill Co.[2]\n\nThe brothers were involved in every aspect of the operation. Their father said they should “know [their] trade thoroughly,” and at the dedication ceremony of the Mansfield Sheet and Tin Plate Co., the brothers took their stations at the mill and put the first heated steel bar through the rollers. The business expanded quickly and a year later it was a “rapidly growing concern that is making good far faster than even the most sanguine of its backers anticipated.”[3] In September of 1916, it was decided to expand the mill. The company sold $300,000 in stock certificates to raise money. The stocks were quickly secured by residents, with many making this their first venture into investing. Construction began the following year of a new building which was designed by one of the youngest brothers, Frank Austin Davey. At this time, William H. Davey was president and general manager of the plant, Albert I. Davey was secretary, and Samuel Davey was assistant general manager. John Davey was superintendent of the old plant and Harold Davey took charge of the new plant. Frank A. Davey was the construction engineer and James and Thomas Davey were employed in the hot mill department.[4]\n\nTragedy struck on October 17, 1918, when Thomas John Davey, the oldest brother, died of pneumonia after influenza. The firm continued to grow and, by the end of 1919, they had done $20,000,000 in business and were expected to do $10,000,000 in 1920 alone. The company wasn’t only lucrative for the brothers; they were also pouring one and half million dollars into the local economy in wages to their employees. It was said the brothers were healthy, vigorous, and proud of their skills. They never drank or smoked and demanded respect, but were still approachable. During the steel strike of 1919, the Mansfield plant continued in operation without losing a single man, while other mills closed. This speaks highly of the character of the brothers and their ability to settle grievances.[5]\n\nThe plant continued to grow and, in December or 1927, a merger was completed involving six plants in Mansfield, Ashtabula, Niles, and Cleveland. W. H. Davey remained president of the new corporation, which was named Empire Steel.[6] Davey would resign as president of Empire Steel on July 18, 1930, but remained as chairman of the board of directors in an advisory capacity. A few months later, Davey would buy the Falcon Tin Plate Co. in Canton, Ohio. The mill was renamed the Canton Tinplate Company and was headed by William with his brother Samuel as vice president. A few years later in 1933, W. H. Davey purchased the Empire Rolling Mills plant in Cleveland and renamed it the W. H. Davey Steel Company.[7] It was around this time that William and his family moved north settling in Shaker Heights, Ohio. They sold their Mansfield mansion dubbed “Gwenwilmar,” the first home built in Woodland at the intersection of Marion Avenue and Woodhill Rd. William would retire in 1937 and would die in his Shaker Heights home on March 3, 1960, after an eight-month illness.[8] William and his wife Gwendolyn are interred in Knollwood Mausoleum in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. William’s parents, five of his brothers (Samuel, John, Albert, Harold, and Thomas), and his four sisters (Elizabeth, Thurza, Agnes, and Mary) are all buried in Mansfield Cemetery. James Garfield Davey was buried in West Lawn Cemetery in Canton, Ohio, and Austin is buried in Florida.\n\nSources:"
