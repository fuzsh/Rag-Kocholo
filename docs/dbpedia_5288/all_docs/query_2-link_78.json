        "text": "Specialist law firm Thomas Mansfield Solicitors expands its family law and dispute resolution practices with two senior lateral hires. Kate Rayner, formerly head of a regional office of a highly regarded family law practice, has joined as partner. Finian Davern, who comes from Knocker & Foskett Solicitors, has been appointed as head of dispute resolution.\n\nKate (pictured) brings 25 years of experience in all aspects of family law and a specialism in financial disputes. She advises high-net-worth individuals on medium-to-high-net-worth cases involving private family run businesses, shareholdings in public companies and complex trust structures.\n\nIn addition to her formidable financial expertise, Kate is a Resolution-accredited specialist in advanced family matters and children law. She advises in disputes between parents and relatives over arrangements for children, regularly acting for clients in private law children cases. Kate is a trained collaborative lawyer and mediator.\n\nFinian specialises in commercial, civil and employment disputes, including breach of contract, and professional negligence claims. He typically represents companies, partnerships and individuals in disputes with larger, more powerful organisations, adding to the firm’s established reputation for successfully acting in cases of this type.\n\nFinian also advises executors, trustees and beneficiaries on contentious private client and probate matters, and landlords and property owners on property disputes. Since 2019, he has practiced as a notary public.\n\nKate joins a team of 16 professionals, including five partners and two associates. Finian joins a forming team, whose offering he will grow and develop.\n\nCommenting on Kate’s appointment at Thomas Mansfield Solicitors, managing partner Neill Thomas said: 'Kate is a brilliant addition to our family law team, which is much in demand in our local and wider communities. Kate’s approach is perfectly aligned with our team’s focus on the constructive resolution of family issues, and her experience in alternative dispute resolution will enable us to meet a growing societal need for better support and solutions for families.'\n\nCommenting on Finian’s appointment, Neill said: 'Demand for our advice on litigation and dispute resolution matters has been rapidly growing, particularly among companies that already engage with our employment practice. With Finian’s diverse experience we’ll be able to meet the needs specific to the various sectors in which our corporate clients operate. We look forward to him expanding the team and developing the new offering.'"
