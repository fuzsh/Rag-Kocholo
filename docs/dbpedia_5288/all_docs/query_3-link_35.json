        "text": "Thomas Orsak, PhD, focuses his practice on intellectual property matters which include domestic and foreign patent prosecution, enforcement, and strategic development of patent portfolios. Thomas's experience emphasizes biotechnology-related matters and includes the areas of genetic engineering, gene therapy, molecular biotechnology assays, drug screening and targeting, enzymology, biotechnology, plants, organic chemistry, pharmaceutical development and medical devices.\n\nThomas counsels clients regarding the development, management and commercialization of commercially valuable intellectual property portfolios on a global scale. In 2019, Thomas participated in an over four-month part-time secondment with a global wound care company. Through this secondment, he received the unique and invaluable opportunity to work closely with the company's in-house attorneys and gained in-depth exposure to many aspects of the company's business.\n\nThomas's patent prosecution practice includes all aspects of drafting and prosecuting patent applications before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), including appeals before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). He also supervises the prosecution of patent applications before many foreign patent offices. Thomas also has experience with the preparation of patentability and freedom to operate (FTO) opinions.\n\nThomas has also provided pro bono patent prosecution services to individual inventors."
