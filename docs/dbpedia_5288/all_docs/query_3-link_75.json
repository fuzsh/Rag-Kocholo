        "text": "October 3rd – PLACERVILLE, CA — The El Dorado Wine Grape Growers Association is pleased to announce that Chuck Mansfield of Goldbud Farms will be honored on October 12, for his work on behalf of El Dorado County wine grape growers and the overall agricultural community for instigating the creation of the Agricultural ReEntry Permit Process. This process allowed grape growers, farmers and ranchers to safely and legally access their property for essential operations needed to protect crops and animals during the Caldor Fire’s mandatory evacuation.\n\nAll residents and businesses are welcome to join the El Dorado Wine Grape Growers Association in honoring Chuck Mansfield at the upcoming Agricultural Commission meeting on Wednesday, October 12, at 6:30pm. The meeting will be held in the Board of Supervisors Chambers located at 330 Fair Lane, Building A, Placerville (across the street from the library). Wendy Thomas, El Dorado County District 3 Supervisor, will be presenting a Certificate of Appreciation to Mansfield for spearheading efforts during last year’s Caldor Fire emergency to create the County’s Agricultural ReEntry Permit Process.\n\nThe 2021 Caldor Fire rampaged forests and farmlands and created indescribable hardship throughout vast areas of El Dorado County during the August growing season. With a mandatory evacuation in place over a large area of El Dorado County, Chuck Mansfield doggedly worked to get the attention of, and rally officials to devise a method for owners to access property during the fire and save what they could of the 2021 harvest. The result was the Agriculture ReEntry Permit Process. This procedure allowed vineyard owners and workers to safely and legally re-enter their vineyards to perform crucial vineyard and farm operations. This ReEntry Permit also allowed horse, poultry and livestock owners re-entry to feed, water and move animals.\n\nMansfield is a hero not just because he stepped up and relentlessly pushed buttons to help solve a major industry problem; but that he did all of this as a partial evacuee himself during his own family’s wine grape and orchard harvests. He was part of a team that included: Cal Fire; the Sheriff’s Department; CHP; the El Dorado County Board of Supervisors and Department of Agriculture; the Central Sierra UCCE Farm Advisor; and, individual growers.\n\nThe El Dorado Wine Grape Growers Association is very proud to honor Chuck Mansfield for his work on behalf of El Dorado County wine grape growers and the overall agricultural community.\n\nFor more information about the Certificate of Appreciation for Chuck Mansfield, contact Supervisor Wendy Thomas’ office at 530-621-5652.
