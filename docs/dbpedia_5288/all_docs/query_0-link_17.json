        "text": "‘This was my first time engaging with a lawyer in any personal issue. All I can say is that they made the process simple, understandable, transparent, efficient, manageable and quick rather than long and drawn out. I hugely appreciated this. They also made efficient use of time, asking me to take the time to document the whole situation and then going through it with me, allowing me to collaborate on the written documents. All of this made it quicker and more collaborative. I felt that we were in this together.’\n\n‘Angie Crush was brilliant to work with. She was calm, knowledgeable, efficient, honest but also had a sense of humour in a tough time. She kept me updated at all times. As someone who had not been through a process like this before, she gave me the utmost confidence that she had my best interests at heart. I have since recommended her to two people.’"
