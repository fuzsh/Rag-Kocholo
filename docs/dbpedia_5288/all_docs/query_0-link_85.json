He was 50 years old.\n\nBill was born in Mansfield, Ohio, to Donald and Harriet (Heston) Sands on April 19, 1973. He attended Madison Schools from kindergarten through twelfth grade and graduated in 1991. At Madison High School, Bill was a member of the band and tennis team. He always loved music and was an excellent drummer. After high school, Bill attended Marietta College and continued to play tennis there. After Marietta, he moved to Truckee, California for a few years. Bill also lived in Lima and Mansfield, Ohio, and eventually settled in Columbus. No matter where he lived, he easily made friends and was well-liked. Bill had a quick sense of humor and a great laugh. He also enjoyed being involved in small bands with friends. This began when he was in high school and continued throughout most of his adult life.
