        "text": "Nearly a year after Bruce Willis’ family announced that he would step away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, his family says his “condition has progressed.”\n\nIn a statement posted Thursday, the 67-year-old actor’s family said Willis has a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” the statement read. “FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone.”\n\nLast March, Willis’ family said his aphasia had affected his cognitive abilities. The condition causes loss of the ability to understand or express speech.\n\nWillis was born in West Germany, but grew up in Carneys Point, Salem County. He found his passion for performing at Penns Grove High School before studying drama at Montclair State University.\n\nThe actor found success and Emmy nominations in the 1980s playing a private detective opposite Cybill Shepherd in the ABC dramedy “Moonlighting,” then became a bona fide action star as John McClane in the “Die Hard” movies.\n\nIn Thursday’s statement, his family said communication challenges were just one symptom of frontotemporal dementia.\n\n“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” the statement read. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”\n\nThe statement was posted on the website for The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration and signed by Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, his ex-wife Demi Moore, and his five children, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel and Evelyn."
