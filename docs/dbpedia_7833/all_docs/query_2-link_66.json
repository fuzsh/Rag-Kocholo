        "text": "links\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis\n\nWalter Bruce Willis, better known as Bruce Willis, is an American actor and producer whose career began in television in the 1980s and has continued both in television and film since, including comedic, dramatic, and action roles. Willis is well known for the role of John McClane in the Die Hard series, which were critical and financial successes. He has also appeared in over sixty films, including box office successes like Pulp Fiction, Sin City, 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, and The Sixth Sense. Motion pictures featuring Willis have grossed US$ 2.55 to 3.05 billion at North American box offices, making him the seventh highest-grossing actor in a leading role, and ninth highest including supporting roles. His next feature film Red with Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren is set for release on October 15, 2010.\n\nWillis was married to actress Demi Moore and they had three daughters, before their divorce in 2000 after thirteen years of marriage. He is a two-time Emmy Award-winning, Golden Globe Award-winning, and four-time Saturn Award-nominated actor.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nBruce Willis diagnosed with 'cruel disease' frontotemporal dementia, family announces\n\nYahoo Celebrity\n\nTARYN RYDER\n\nFebruary 16, 2023, 12:37 PM\n\nBruce Willis officially diagnosed with a form of dementia. (Photo: VCG via Getty Images)\n\nBruce Willis is suffering from a form of dementia, specifically frontotemporal dementia (FTD), his loved ones announced on Thursday. In a statement, the Willis family said the 67-year-old actor's condition has worsened since he was diagnosed with aphasia last year.\n\n\"Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,\" they shared.\n\nThe Willis family wants to shed light on FTD by coming forward with the news.\n\n\"FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know. Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead. As Bruce's condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research,\" the family added.\n\n\"Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately. We know in our hearts that — if he could today — he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families,\" the Willis's continued.\n\n\"Bruce has always found joy in life — and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us,\" the statement concluded. \"We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible."
