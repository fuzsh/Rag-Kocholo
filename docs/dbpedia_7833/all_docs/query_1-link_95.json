        "text": "Mystery swirled around this Delaware River community for months: who was the secret buyer of 12 waterfront acres in the depressed heart of town?\n\nNo one had been interested in Penns Grove real estate since the sprawling Du Pont chemical works next door in Carneys Point, once a cornerstone of the local economy, began laying off blue-collar workers decades ago. Statistically, if not emotionally, this town of 5,200 is the state's second most economically distressed municipality, after Newark.\n\nWhen papers were filed naming the corporate entity Screwball Inc. as the purchaser, a thrill of hope and expectation surged through the town. The man who controls Screwball is the area's most famous son, the actor Bruce Willis.\n\nSoon tourists, the first in memory, were taking pictures of the vacant 12 acres, a stone house and a shuttered bank building that Mr. Willis had bought for $750,000. They entered one of the few remaining businesses on Main Street, Willis Hardware, to ask if it was owned by the star, who became famous from the television series \"Moonlighting\" and his \"Die Hard\" films, and now commands more than $10 million a picture. \"No relation,\" they were told.\n\nAnd they wanted to know if Mr. Willis's equally famous (and rich) wife, the actress Demi Moore, had been spotted this summer talking to contractors hired to renovate the stone house the couple planned to occupy on visits with their three young daughters.\n\nBut mostly, everyone wanted to know what plans the couple had for the property.\n\n\"So far, all we know is he owns a house with a very large backyard,\" said H. Donald Stewart Jr., a local real estate broker whose office handled the purchase.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
