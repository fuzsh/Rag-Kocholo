        "text": "Mini Biography\n\nBruce Willis was born Walter Bruce Willison on the 19th of March, 1955 in Idar-Oberstein, a German town near the border with Luxembourg. His dad, David, being a military man, was stationed there and his wife, Marlene, was from Kassel (they'd be divorced in 1971). On his discharge in 1957, David took his family back to Carney's Point, New Jersey, finding employment as a welder and a factory worker.\n\nBruce, the oldest of four children (he has a sister, Flo, and two brothers, one of whom, David, is a movie producer), attended high school at Penn's Grove. A popular fellow, he was elected Student Council President and, strangely for a boy of such resolute blue-collar pride, threw himself into drama classes. This was perhaps because, tormented by a debilitating stutter, he discovered that he lost his impediment when onstage. He was also a talented wrestler - that scar on his shoulder now is actually the result of a serious sprain. Though a good student, he was suspended for three months in his senior year for taking part in what he later described as \"the annual riot\".\n\nBruce Willis grew up mainly in Penns Grove, New Jersey, and graduated from high school there before going to New York to become an actor. He waited tables and tended bar for a living until he began to get roles in plays. While tending bar one night he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.\n\nPlagued by the name Walter Willison and by a serious stutter, you wouldn't have held out much hope for the young Bruce Willis making it as a film star. Yet, discovering that his impediment disappeared onstage,\n\nWillis was married to actress Demi Moore from November 21, 1987 to October 18, 2000. The couple gave no public reason for their breakup. Willis and Moore had three children during their thirteen-year union: Rumer Glenn Willis (born 1988), Scout LaRue Willis (1991) and Tallulah Belle Willis (1994). Since their breakup, rumors have persisted that the couple planned to re-marry, but Moore has since married Ashton Kutcher. They are still on friendly terms, and continue to share a home and several businesses in Blaine County, Idaho.\n\nCurrently, Willis is reportedly dating Days of Our Lives actress Nadia Bjorlin.\n\nIn the late-1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of blues entitled The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single \"Respect Yourself\". Follow-up recordings were not as successful, though Willis does return to the recording studio from time to time.\n\nIn 2001, he swore blind that he'd never again appear in an all-action, explosions-a-go-go blockbuster, but Bruce Willis had a hard time escaping his reputation as that genre's most successful star. Indeed, since his first major cinematic hit, Die Hard, many of us cannot witness a fiery onscreen detonation without imagining Bruce - wide-eyed and panting in a grubby white vest - flying through the air, arms and legs flailing frantically. He's just too damn good at it. But, of course - being both a singing star, a restaurateur and an arch comedian - there's been far more to his career than that.\n\nSome reports from military officials suggest that Willis tried to enlist in the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but he was turned away because of his age. [1] He has offered $1 million to any civilian who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.[2] Bruce Willis isn't happy about how the Iraqi conflict is being portrayed, so he's going to \"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\" [3] The film will follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former special forces green beret who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their heroics.\n\nBirth name Walter Bruce Willis\n\nNickname: Bruno\n\nHeight: 6' (1.83 m)\n\nSpouse: Demi Moore (21 November 1987 - 18 October 2000) (divorced) 3 children\n\nTRADEMARK\n\nFrequently plays a man who suffered a tragedy, had lost something or had a crisis of confidence or conscience.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nWas high school student council president.

[2001]\n\nWears his watch upside down with the face on the inside of his hand. This is also visible in many movies he's done (Die Hard with a Vengeance , Mercury Rising, etc.) where they haven't requested him to flip it over.\n\nMemorial Day weekend, 1987: Was arrested after reportedly disturbing the peace and assaulting a police officer who was called to quiet a raucous party at his home. The charges were dropped after Willis agreed to apologize to his neighbors.\n\nAccording to friends, he had a terrible stammer as a child.\n\nYounger brother Robert died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 42.

Was president of a drama club at school.\n\nWorked in a chemical factory before going to college.\n\nHe filled in as a last-minute host for David Letterman on February 26, 2003, a show he was supposed to be the guest for.

Attended the Stella Adler Conservatory / Theatre program in New York City for three years.\n\nPlays the harmonica. France made him an officer in Order of Arts and Letters (April 2005). \"France pays homage to an actor who represents the force of American cinema and the power of emotions that he invites us to share on screens throughout the world\", Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres said. \"I'm nervous. Bonjour Paris,\" he replied.\n\nAfter dating Brooke Burns for ten months and finally being engaged to her they decided to split because of the difficulties with maintaining a long-distance relationship. (2 June 2004)\n\nWas chosen to play John McClane in Die Hard (1988) because the producers felt he brought warmth and humor to an otherwise cold and humorless character.\n\nHe has been special ambassador of his birth town Idar-Oberstein since his 50th birthday.\n\nWas a guest at Demi Moore's and Ashton Kutcher's wedding.\n\n8 directors cast him twice in their films: Blake Edwards, Amy Heckerling, Rob Reiner, Robert Benton, John McTiernan, Alan Rudolph, M.
