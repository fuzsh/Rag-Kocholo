        "text": "Walter Bruce Willis, a German-born American actor, producer, and musician. He Was born on a military base in Germany. His career began in television in the 1980s and has continued both in television and film since, including comedic, dramatic, and action roles. His mother Marlene was born in Kassel, Germany. Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for his film appearances as wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. As a young man his personality was very much like that of the character that he portrayed on “Moonlighting” (1985). He was always getting into trouble because of this and was bodily ejected from parties by the hosts for being obnoxious.\n\nWalter Bruce Willis, a German-born American actor, producer, and musician.
