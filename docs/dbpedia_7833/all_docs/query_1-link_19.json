        "text": "Bruce Willis doesn’t need any introduction. Most of us grew up with him playing on our TVs, in some action movie that we just couldn’t stop watching. Recently, Bruce’s close family publicly announced that he is retiring, due to a condition called aphasia — and we wanted to delve a bit deeper into the actors’ impressive career and unforgettable contributions.\n\nFrom his adrenaline-pumping portrayal of John McClane in “Die Hard” to his compelling performances spanning various genres, Willis has left an enduring mark on the world of cinema. Let’s find out some cool facts about the man behind the name — Bruce Willis.\n\nBruce Willis — from TV shows to blockbusters\n\n© Michael Ochs Archives / Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images, Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News, Invision/Invision/East News\n\nFun fact: Bruce Willis — 67 years old — American actor, singer, and film producer — an iconic figure in pop culture, was born in West Germany, in 1955.\n\nHis acting career began off-Broadway in the ’70s and Bruce first rose to fame thanks to the TV show Moonlighting, in 1985. More than 30 years later, he managed to be a part of around 100 films and has multiple awards under his belt.\n\nDuring the actor’s Moonlighting chapter, the Die Hard franchise began in 1988 and Mr. Willis starred in all 5 parts, with the last one coming out in 2013. Bruce Willis will be forever known as John McClane, the quick-witted detective that saves the day — but we won’t spoil it for you — this is the perfect time to rewatch the good old classics.\n\nInteresting facts we didn’t know about Bruce Willis\n\nCAP/RFS/Capital Pictures/East News\n\nIn his first 20 years of life, Bruce struggled with stuttering, he said: “I could hardly talk. It took me 3 minutes to complete a sentence. It was crushing for anyone who wanted to express themselves, who wanted to be heard and couldn’t. It was frightening. Yet, when I became another character, in a play, I lost the stutter. It was phenomenal.”\n\nEast News\n\nBruce Willis is also a singer, his debut album, The Return of Bruno, was released in 1987, and 2 others followed in 1989 and 2001 — the lead single — Respect Yourself, was a hit.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection / East News\n\nWillis forever changed salaries in Hollywood. In 1987, when actors like Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox were getting around $3 million for a movie, 20th Century Fox agreed to pay Willis $5 million for his first role in Die Hard. Other stars took notice and “the day after I signed the deal, every actor in Hollywood’s salary went up to $5 million,” stated Willis.\n\nPrivate life\n\nMary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/ East News, © emmahemingwillis / Instagram\n\nFrom 1987 until 2000, Bruce Willis was married to actress Demi Moore. In 2009, the actor married model Emma Heming. Today, he’s father to 5 daughters, 3 from his previous marriage with Demi — Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah as well as 2 daughters with Emma — Mabel and Evelyn.\n\nBruce with Demi Moore and their 3 daughters\n\nBruce Willis has a caring, loving family around him.\n\nBruce with Emma Heming and their 2 daughters\n\nRecently, Bruce’s ex-wife Demi Moore, his current wife, Emma, and their daughters posted a joint statement on social media, and it has been making waves:\n\n“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family, we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities. As a result of this and with much consideration, Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”\n\nAphasia — what is it?\n\nAUG/face to face/FaceToFace/REPORTER/East News, AUG/face to face/FaceToFace/REPORTER/East News\n\nAphasia, most common among older adults, is a language disorder that can make it difficult for individuals to communicate through words. People who suffer from this condition make mistakes, whether they choose the wrong words, put them together incorrectly, or can’t comprehend them.\n\n84.5% of people have never heard of aphasia, and studies show that more than 75% of people affected by this diagnosis do not return to employment.\n\nBruce Willis’ final years of work\n\nBruce Willis has been actively working over the past few years, he appeared in 8 movies just last year. While 2 movies have already been released this year, there are still 8 movies in post-production, and we can’t wait to see them. To Bruce, we wish you a happy retirement and lots of happiness in old age.\n\nWe hope his journey toward healing will be strong and without barriers, and we forever thank him for the legacy he’s left behind.\n\nWhich of Bruce Willis’ roles is the one that you’ll never forget? Do you have a message you’d like to share with everyone about Bruce? Let us know in the comments."
