        "text": "Warning: Spoilers Ahead: Kalki 2898 AD is finally in theatres and critics are calling the Nag Ashwin film a ‘must watch.’ The movie stars Prabhas, Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan in key roles among others while Tamil superstar Kamal Haasan plays the baddie of the film, Yaskin. Despite limited screen time, makers have established a strong foundation for his character in the film, which will only branch out further in the film’s sequel.\n\nWhile we wait to see what is in store for the character, Kamal’s Yaskin brought back a childhood memory. Does it not remind you of somebody we should not be naming? Yes, we are talking about its connection with Harry Potter’s Voldemort.\n\n‘One Who Must Not Be Named’\n\nTo begin with, Kamal Haasan’s look in Kalki 2898 AD is very similar to Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter. His fleshy structure will remind you of Voldemort’s appearance in the film series based on J. K. Rowling’s best-selling books. Not just this, but it is worth noting that both, Yaskin and Voldemort are not called by their respective names in their films. As we know it, Voldemort was referred to as ‘one who must not be named’. Similarly, Kamal’s character is always called ‘Supreme’ (indicating that he is the biggest power).\n\nYaskin and Voldemort’s Fight For Survival\n\nKamal Haasan is also vulnerable and half-dead like Voldemort. The Harry Potter villain needed the bones of his father, flesh from Wormtail, his servant, and blood from his enemy to regain his bodily form. Similarly, the Tamil actor’s character in Kalki also used a tonic, extracted from Deepika Padukone’s body to gain strength and for his survival.\n\nDeath Prophecy For Haasan’s Yaskin and Voldemort\n\nIn Nag Ashwin’s film, Kalki is destined to kill Haasan’s Yaskin. A prophecy has already predicted that a child will be born to Deepika Padukone’s Sumathi. The child will end evil powers in the world, including Yaskin. Similarly, Harry Potter was destined to kill Voldemort. Voldemort wants to see Harry Potter dead for his revenge and survival. Just like that, Kamal’s motive is to kill Deepika’s child before it kills him.\n\nThe Death Eaters In Nag Ashwin’s Kalki\n\nIn Kalki 2898 AD, we see Kamal’s warriors dressed in black leather attires. Even their faces are covered – a glimpse which will remind you of Voldemort’s ‘The Death Eaters’ army in Harry Potter.\n\nWell, what do you think?"
