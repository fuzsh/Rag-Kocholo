        "text": "Only a very few writers (Karunanidhi, Pannu Arunachalam, Sujatha, Crazy Mohan) are celebrated in Tamil Cinema. The status of being a writer & director overshadows the need for good writers and to celebrate writers. And also both writers and directors work is overshadowed by stars. Hence writers with distinctive voice is only recognized and celebrated by mass audience.\n\nCrazy Mohan is one such writer with a distinctive style on writing which is filled with witty wordplays. His dialogues are just like his surname – Crazy. He has written screenplay and dialogues for over 30 films. Among those his collaboration with Kamal Haasan is simple exquisite. They share a great comradeship which is hilariously represented in the screen.\n\nIn an interview, Crazy Mohan said that Kamal is half Sivaji Ganesan and half Nagesh (mimicking Kamal’s Aalavandhan dialogue- Kadavul Paathi, Mirugam Paathi) and how he always managed to get the Nagesh half of Kamal in wholesome. This is probably why their collaboration always hits gold. Kamal’s screenplay makes room for Crazy Mohan to go crazy on his dialogues and I guess the vice versa also worked.\n\nThey both have collaborated for 10 films and I am ranking them as objectively as possible (If you disapprove the ranking, comment your ranking). The rankings are based on 3 parameters- How is the Comedy, how it is as a whole film and repeat value.\n\n10. Kadhala Kadhala (1998)\n\nScreenplay: Kamal Haasan Story: Crazy Mohan\n\nI need a whole page to write about its ensemble cast. There is Kamal, Prabhu Deva, Soundarya, Rambha, MS Viswanathan (who is a Music Director), Cho, Vadivelu, Kovai Sarala, Mouli and many more. The film is perfect example for comedy of errors. There is a whole lot of confusion and fun.\n\n9. Pammal K. Sambandam (2002)\n\nStory, Dialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nThis film has great comedy, great repeat value and a regular story. Kamal plays a stuntman who hates marriages and he crosses path with Simran who is a doctor and also doesn’t believe in marriages. This a film that will leave in splits.\n\n8. Sathi Leelavathi (1995)\n\nScreenplay: Kamal Haasan, Balu Mahendra Dialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nAfter forced marriage, Ramesh Aravind is attracted by Heera and starts flirting with her. They plan to go to Bangalore together and the plan is disrupted by his childhood friend Kamal. Through the story is about Ramesh Aravind, its Kamal and Kovai Sarala who steals the show. Crazy Moahn’s dialogues spoken in Coimbatore Tamil dialect just brings the roof down.\n\n7. Thenali (2000)\n\nWritten by Crazy Mohan\n\nThe film is about a Sri Lankan Tamil (Kamal) who has many phobias after experiencing the civil war. He visits Chennai to get treatment from Jayaram, who asks him to wait until he returns from vacation. Kamal disturbs the doctor in his vacation. The Delhi Ganesh and Ramesh Khanna portions, the rat sequence in bus are extremely funny. The album by AR Rahman is an underrated gem.\n\n6. Avvai Shanmugi (1996)\n\nWritten by Crazy Mohan\n\nKamal Haasan plays a father character who is going to the extreme of dressing up as women to spend time with his daughter. The film is inspired by Mrs. Doubtfire. This a film where the supporting actors score. Be it Nasser or Manivannan or Delhi Ganesh or even SPB who does a small cameo.\n\n5. Magalir Mattum (1994)\n\nStory: Kamal Haasan Screenplay: Crazy Mohan\n\nThis is the only film where Kamal doesn’t star in it. Instead he is the story writer of this film, which is about three colleagues- Revathi, Urvashi and Rohini who together fight against their boss who sexually harasses them. They also deal with a dead body, played by Nagesh (He will make you laugh even while playing as dead man). The film also talks about the problems faced by women in the society\n\n4. Vasool Raja MBBS (2004)\n\nDialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nThe film is a remake of ‘Munnabhai MBBS’. I am refusing to watch the original because I really loved this version. Crazy Mohan’s dialogues leave you in splits and the film is equally emotional. This ranks high because I find the comedy and emotional to be in balance.\n\n3. Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989)\n\nScreenplay: Kamal Haasan Dialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nApoorva Sagotharargal is one the well-made masala films in Tamil. Kamal plays dual role, one of which is a dwarf. It’s a technical wonder how they hot the dwarf character back in 1989 when CGI wasn’t that advanced as it is now. In a revenge drama the writer managed to write good comedy without interrupting the narration.\n\n2. Panchatanthiram (2002)\n\nStory: Kamal Haasan Dialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nPanchatanthiram is about a bunch of friends who are thrown at a serious situation (a murder) and managed to make a hilarious film out of it. Because you can take the same plot and make a great thriller out of it. The film has extreme repeat value and it feels fresh every time you watch.\n\n1. Micheal Madana Kama Rajan (1990)\n\nScreenplay: Kamal Haasan Dialogues: Crazy Mohan\n\nMicheal Madana Kama Rajan is the best comedy film made in Tamil cinema. It has a combination of comedy genres (comedy of errors, slapstick & witty wordplay) with wonderful performances and wholesome filmmaking. Most of Crazy Mohan movies have this combination but this film uses it the best."
