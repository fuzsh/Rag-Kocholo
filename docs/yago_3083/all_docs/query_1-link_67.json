He started acting when he was just 5 years old in the 1960 Tamil film Kalathur Kannamma. This movie was directed by A. Bhimsingh and Kamal won the President’s Gold Medal for his performance in it.\n\nEarly life & Family:\n\nHaasan was born on November 7, 1954, into a Tamil Brahmin family. His father, D. Srinivasan, was a lawyer and freedom fighter, while his mother, Rajalakshmi, took care of the household. Initially named Parthasarathy, he was later given the name Kamal Haasan by his father.\n\nHaasan’s family had a strong creative streak. His brothers, Charuhasan and Chandrahasan, were involved in acting, and his sister, Nalini, pursued classical dance. Growing up in this environment, Haasan was exposed to various forms of art and entertainment from a young age.\n\nHe received his primary education in Paramakudi before moving to Madras (now Chennai) for his higher education. It was during this time in Madras that Haasan’s interest in films and fine arts blossomed, greatly encouraged by his father’s support and inspiration.\n\nThis early exposure and encouragement played a pivotal role in shaping Haasan’s future career path in the world of cinema and performing arts.\n\nFilm Career:\n\n1960–1963:\n\nWhen a doctor friend of his mother visited A.V. Meiyappan (AVM) to treat Meiyappan’s wife, she brought Kamal Haasan along. Impressed by Haasan’s behavior, AVM’s son, M. Saravanan, suggested him for their movie “Kalathur Kannamma.”\n\nHaasan won the Rashtrapati Award (President’s gold medal) for his acting in “Kalathur Kannamma” when he was only six years old. He acted in five more movies as a child actor.\n\nHaasan then started his career in the Malayalam film industry with “Kannum Karalum” in 1962. Encouraged by his father, Haasan joined a theater group called T. K. S. Nataka Sabha, led by T. K. Shanmugam.\n\nWhile studying at the Hindu Higher Secondary School in Triplicane, Haasan’s time with the theater group influenced his acting skills and sparked his interest in makeup.\n\n1970–1975:\n\nAfter taking a break from films for seven years, Haasan returned to the industry as a dance assistant, working under choreographer Thankappan.\n\nDuring this time, he had small roles in a few films without receiving credit. His first appearance was in the 1970 film Maanavan, where he appeared in a dance scene. He assisted Thankappan in films like Annai Velankani (1971) and Kasi Yathirai (1973), where he also had a supporting role and worked as an assistant director.\n\nHis first major role came in K. Balachander’s Tamil film Arangetram (1973), followed by being cast as the antagonist in Sollathaan Ninaikkiren (1973) by Balachander. Haasan then took on supporting roles in films such as Gumasthavin Magal (1974), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Naan Avanillai. In the same year, he played his first lead role in the Malayalam film Kanyakumari, which earned him his first Filmfare Award.\n\nIn Tamil cinema, Haasan’s breakthrough as a lead actor came in Balachander’s Apoorva Raagangal. He portrayed a rebellious young man who falls in love with an older woman. To prepare for this role, Haasan learned to play the mridangam. This role earned him his second Filmfare Award.\n\n1976–1979:\n\nIn 1976, Haasan starred in Balachander’s film Manmadha Leelai, followed by Oru Oodhappu Kan Simittugiradhu directed by S. P.

Avargal (1977) focused on the women’s movement, and for this role, Haasan learned ventriloquism. The movie was remade in Telugu as Idi Katha Kaadu (1979), with Haasan reprising his role.\n\nIn 16 Vayathinile (1977), he played a naive village youth and won his fourth consecutive Best Actor award. That same year, Haasan starred in his first Kannada film, Kokila, directed by his friend and mentor Balu Mahendra. He also appeared in a Bengali film, Kabita, a remake of the Tamil film Aval Oru Thodar Kathai.\n\nIn 1978, Haasan made his Telugu film debut in the cross-cultural romantic film Maro Charitra, directed by Balachander, which earned him his fifth consecutive Filmfare Award.

Ravikumar, became the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year and received critical acclaim.\n\nFollowing Dasavathaaram, Haasan directed and produced Unnaipol Oruvan (2009), a remake of the Bollywood film A Wednesday, which was well-received both critically and commercially in Tamil and Telugu versions.\n\n2010–Present\n\nHaasan’s career in the 2000s and beyond saw him involved in various films and off-screen contributions.

His production company, Raaj Kamal Films International, has produced many of his films, and he has directed notable projects like Chachi 420, Hey Ram, Virumaandi, and Vishwaroopam.\n\nHaasan is also known for his involvement in music and lyrics, having written songs for his films and collaborating with musicians like Anirudh Ravichander and Ghibran. He has showcased his singing talent in multiple languages.\n\nAdditionally, Haasan has shown a keen interest in literary works, being associated with projects like the musical tribute to Venmurasu, the longest novel in any language.\n\nHis journey in cinema continues with upcoming projects like Thug Life, Indian 2, and the Telugu film Kalki 2898 AD, marking his return to Telugu cinema.
