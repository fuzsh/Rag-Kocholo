        "text": "1. Kamal Hasan was born in Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram district, Madurai. His father Srinivasan was a successful advocate, who was close to the then raja of Ramanathapuram. His mother Rajalakshmi was your typical housewife, a cultured lady who was only too ready to support the young Kamal in his artistic dreams and desires. Kamal in turn was very attached to his mother, and indeed to the womenfolk in his family.\n\n2. Kamal debuted as a child star in Kalathur Kannamma when he was five years old. Gemini Ganeshan and Savitri were the lead stars in the movie.\n\n3. As a child star, Kamal acted with the two celluloid icons of the time, Sivaji Ganeshan in Paarthaal Pasi Therum and with M G Ramachandran in Ananda Jyoti.\n\n4. Even as a child, Kamal was an independent thinker. As he himself says, 'My father tried to sell religion to me, but I refused to the buy the religion of my father'.\n\n5. Kamal speaks the Madurai brand of Tamil with total ease, and has a strong affinity for people from that region -- such as Vairamuthu, Bharatiraja and Ilaiyaraja to name just three from the upper echelons of the movie industry.\n\n6. Kamal never really set out to become an actor. His dream was to direct, and he started off as assistant with dance master Thankappan. He began his stint with Thankappan in Annai Velankanni, in which he also went on to appear, in a miniscule cameo, as Jesus Christ (watch for him in the scenes where Jesus carries the cross to Calvary). It is Kamal that you see in the song Deiva Mainthan Pogindraan, which details the Stations of the Cross. At the time, Kamal was in his late teens.\n\n7. At an early age, Kamal got involved with the Malayalam industry, and in time learnt to speak all the dialects of Malayalam with ease. He in fact can speak, read and write all four South Indian languages -- Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam besides Hindi, English, and Marathi, the last named thanks to wife Sarika.\n\n8. Kamal is an ardent fan of off-beat cinema, and his favourite movie of all time is Bicycle Thief by Vittorio DeSica. He rarely misses film festivals, and his favourite Hindi films are Mughal e Azam and Sholay.\n\n9. His favourite music director, in Hindi, is Naushad. 'He is a wonder, a gem', Kamal says of the composer.\n\n10. Kamal, while still young, formally learnt Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music. A S Prakasham first introduced him as a singer, with Netaji as his lyricist. His first song was Gnayar Oli Mazhayil.\n\n11. Kamal studied at the MCT Muthiah Chetty School in Purasawakkam. However, he hated going to school, and had no academic ambitions.\n\n12. Kamal is a poet in his own right, penning free verse -- Pudhukavithai. He plans to release a compilation of his poems soon, and Vairamuthu has been asked to select from the Kamal oeuvre. Author Sujata is likely to write the foreword.\n\n13. Kamal's favourite Tamil novels are T Janakiraman's Amma Vandhaal and Marapasu.\n\n14. Kamal is into Siddha literature, and is thoroughly familiar with the biographies of 18 Siddhas, in particular that of Siva Vaakkiyar.\n\n15. Kamal and Vairamuthu are close friends. Both of them have a fetish for being 'young', and they constantly exchange jocular notes on their respective ageing process.\n\n16. Kamal knows to compose music, editing and cinematography, but believes he should not interfere with these departments, even when he himself is directing a film.\n\n17. Kamal underwent a crash course in direction, in Hollywood, and attends workshops whenever he can. He also learnt the art of make-up, while working on the Shankar movie, Indian, which won him a national award.\n\n18. Himself an accomplished dancer, Kamal names Prabhu Deva as his own special favourite. In fact, when asked to name a dancer before Prabhu Deva's era, Kamal flat out said that there is none in the annals of Indian cinema who ranks with Prabhu Deva. \"None can equal him,\" says Kamal, who has in fact shared the lead role with the loose limbed Prabhu Deva in the film, Kaadhala Kaadhala, which includes the dance sequence Kaasmela Kaas Vandhu wherein the two dance together.\n\n19. Kamal rates Charlie Chaplin a major influence, and he in fact paid tribute to the comic genius when he played the role of Chaplin Chellappa; in Punnagia Mannan. Years ago, Chaplin had in fact participated in a Chaplin lookalike contest and came seventh! Asked how he himself would have fared, had he contested, Kamal without a blink, says \"Eighth!\".\n\n20. When it comes to acting, Kamal rates Sivaji Ganeshan head and shoulders above the rest, and at every opportunity acknowledges the senior star's influence on his acting. Kamal says no Tamil actor is free of Sivaji's influence. So great is his respect and admiration for Sivaji, that once, at a function where Sivaji and his son Prabhu were both present, Kamal addressed Sivaji as 'Appa', 'father'.\n\n21. Kamal turned producer for the first time with Raja Paarvai, director for the first time with Chachi 420.\n\n22. Kamal has edited a Tamil magazine named Mayyam,, in which he has frankly aired out his sometimes revolutionary views on society and religion.\n\n23. Kamal always names Ananthu as his friend, philosopher and guide, and derives his theory of cinema from him.\n\n24. Kamal's favourite art genre is folk -- songs, stories, dances.\n\n25. Though a self-proclaimed nationalist, he has a penchant for working with foreign talent when it comes to movie-making. The latest example is special effects and computer graphics whiz, Grant Page, for the under-production Aaalvandhaan (Abhay, in Hindi).\n\n26. Kamal still hopes to revive Marudhanayagam, his magnum opus. The mega-budget historical romance remains his pet dream, it will be recalled that he had invited no less than Queen Elizabeth for its launch, before the project got stuck for lack of funds.\n\n27. Kamal is an avowed atheist, and believes in the philosophy of E V 'Periyar' Ramaswamy. Some day, he hopes to do a film on Periyar, with, of course, himself in the lead role.\n\n28. Kamal and Mouli acted together in Nizhal Nijamaagirudhu. Many years down the line, the two will get together again with Mouli directing a movie featuring Kamal in the lead role.\n\n29. In these days of shirtless heroes, it is interesting that Kamal was the first full-fledged hero to take off his shirt -- in the film Arangetram, which was in fact his first 'adult' role after his years as a child star. Some might quibble that Manavan was his first adult role, but Kamal only had a fleeting appearance in that film, and that was while he was still in his teens. In Arangetram, director K Balachander had to establish that Premila was from a Brahmin family, and to do that he had to show Kamal wearing the sacred thread -- and so, no shirt for Kamal.\n\n30. Kamal made his debut as a playback singer with Gnayar Oli Mazhaiyil in Andharangam. In Avvai Shanmughi, he sang the 'female voice' for the song Rukku Rukku.\n\n31. Kamal's lip to lip kisses are the stuff of Tamil film legend. In the otherwise 'chaste' industry, Kamal has a fetish for such deep kisses. This dates back to the French actress who plays his wife in Sattam En Kaiyil. This was during the lifetime of M G Ramachandran, and the matinee idol turned politician at the time opposed the kiss, on the grounds that it was against Tamil culture and demanded that the scene be removed. Unfazed, Kamal has kisses pretty much every actress he has starred with.\n\n32. Kamal has acted in the four main South Indian languages, plus Hindi, plus, wait for this, Bengali -- this last, in the Bengali remake of Aval Oru Thodar Kadhai.\n\nhe learnt the mridangam. For his role in"
