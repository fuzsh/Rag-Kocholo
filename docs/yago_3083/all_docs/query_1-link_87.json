        "text": "6th Nov, 2009\n\nTrivias about Kamalhassan.\n\n1. Kamal is the only Indian actor who had bagged more than 18 Filmfare Awards\n\n2. Kamal was the choreographer for MGR in the film Naan En Pirandhein, He was also choreographer for Shivaji in the film Savaale Samali and for Jayalalitha in Anbu Thangai.\n\n3. Sri Devi and Sri Priya are the actresses who had paired with Kamal in most of his films.\n\n4. Kamal was the instrument in releasing Rajni’s favorite film Mullum Malaraum.\n\n5. Though Kamal has acted with almost all notable directors, he has not actor in Director Mahendran’s films.\n\n6. Kamal has procured a land in the suburbs to build a hi tech theatre. There will be restaurant and amusement park also.\n\n7. Kamal is the only Tamil actor who had acted in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and Bengali languages.\n\n8. Aval Oru Thodarkadhai was remade in Bengali as Kabita in which Kamal portrayed the same character he did in Tamil as a mimicry artiste. But in the Telugu version, Antuleni Katha he played the character of Bengali Managing Director who likes to marry Kavitha.\n\n9. S.P.Balasubramaniam has sung more no. of songs for kamalhassan. But in one movie, K.J.Jesudass sang for kamal and SPB sang for another actor. The movie is Moondram Pirai. S.P.B sand “Vaanengum thanga vinmeengal…” for a junior artist while the other songs were sung by KJJ,\n\n10. Kamal shared screen space with his first wife Vaani Ganapathy in the movie “Mel Naattu Marumagal” in which Sivakumar played the lead role as Kamal’s elder brother\n\n11. Kamal Haasan and Vaani Ganapathy got married on the day of the 25th Filmfare Awards; they attended the award nite with their garlands still around their necks.\n\n12. Kamal shared screen space with his second wife Sarika in the thriller Tik Tik Tik. She appeared in one scene as a model and was murdered. Latha Rajnikanth has sung the song “Netru indha neram…” in the movie.\n\n13. Kamal and Sarika got married after their 2nd daughter Akshara was born.\n\n14. Kamal- Sarika is the only couple to get National Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress. (Shabana Azmi-Javed Akhtar is the only couple to get 5 National Awards each. The former as the Best Actress and the latter as the best Lyricist).\n\n15. In the movie Pattikkada Pattanama, Kamal has done the Leg movements for a Western song for Sivaji.\n\n16. Mohan (Mike Mohan) is the first actor to whom Kamal sang a song in the film “Oh Maane Maane”. Next he gave to Ajith in Ullasam.\n\n17. S.P.Balasubramaniam is Kamal’s voice in Telugu dubbed Tamil films. But when Swathy Muthyam was dubbed as Sippikkul Muthu, S.P.B was supposed to dub for him since Kamal was out of dates.\n\n18. Kalaignan was a poor remake of the 1966 Bollywood Blockbuster Teesri Manzil starring Shammi Kapoor and Asha Parekh.\n\n19. India’s official entry to the Oscars comprise most of Kamalhassan movies.\n\n20. Kamal learnt American Accent from his daughter Shruti Hassan for the role of Fletcher in Dasavatharam and learnt Telugu accented Tamil for the role of Balram Naidu by observing Gautami’s way of speaking.\n\nI’m one guy who often change my Caller tune/Hello Tune. At times the callers get confused whether they called me or someone else. Esp my mom gets baffled when she calls me and tells me she was about to cut the call since the song was different. My first preference goes to Ilayaraja, A.R.Rahman or SPB, Shreya Ghoshal in any language. Next goes to R.D.Burman, Lata or Sonu in Hindi and Harris/Yuvan in Tamil.\n\nSince Kamalhassan’s B’day is nearing, I would like to give a tribute to the legendary actor. I thought to keep a Kamalhassan song as my Hello Tune. Nothing can match Kamalhassan-SPB-Ilayaraja trio. Since the monsoon started, the first choice was “Andhi mazhai pozhigiradhu…” from Kamal’s 100th movie Rajapaarvai. I tried in Vodafone’s Music Search. It has the worst caller tune service I’ve ever used. You never get any new song immediately after the audio release. Airtel is the BEST service provider in as far as Hello Tunes are concerned. I had “Nila nee vaanam kaatru..” from Pokkisham as Hello Tune (On Apr 30th 2009) just a week after its Audio Lauch . Vodafone doesnt have much collections esp in Tamil. I didnt get Andhi Mazhai pozhigiradhu and kept on trying like Pepsi Uma says. If we dont get the song we search and keep on searching, some other song would be set automatically as our caller tune. Some faltu song was automatically set and I didnt give up and tried again and again like Ghajini. It could neither recognize Andhi mazhai nor Rajapaarvai. When I said “Andhi mazhai” it was given Anbe sivam and “Anbe Vaa” songs. When I sent sms to 55655, I got the results Andhi mazhai megam, andhi varum neram but not the evergreen Andhi mazhai. I tried 3-4 times and I was fed up. I was thinking to finalise “Yaar yaar sivam” with Kamal’s mesmerising voice but eventually I set the song “Mouname paarvaiyaai…” from Anbe Sivam. as the Caller Tune. It’s an awesome romantic melody by Vidhyasagar in the raga Dwijavanti I think. Hope many would have not heard this song.\n\nNote: This song is not present in the movie and it’s there only in the Audio Album. In a recent Live Phone-in Interview with Kamalhassan in Kalaignar TV. Most of the callers were Celebrities like Nasser, Shivakumar, Rohini, Ramesh Aravind, Kala Master, Ramkumar Ganesan, et al. S.P.Balasubramaniam called as a Kamal fan to wish him for his 50th Glorious year in Tamil Cinema. He asked Kamal why the song was not present in the movie. Kamal regretted and apologised him and convinced him that due to the length of the movie, it was dropped and he too felt sorry for rejecting such a nice melody. Hence I set this rare song as my Caller Tune just to fulfill S.P.B’s wish.\n\nP.S: “Andhi mazhai pozhigiradhu…” has one more behind it for which I have to write a separate blog.\n\nThe Music launch of Kama Hassan’s forthcoming flick Unaippol Oruvan (Remake of critically acclaimed A Wednesday) was launched on Sunday at Satyam theatres. The speciality is Kamal’s gorgeous daughter Shruti Hassan has composed Music for the film. AVM Saravanan released the CD and the one and only KB received the first copy. It would have been better if Ilayaraja had released the first copy. KB appreciated that she would become a “Ulaga Naayagi” (Konjam over KB). Kamal was overwhelmed with his daughter’s inborn talent. He’s a prophet. He might have forseen his child’s future and named her “Shruthi” (Musical term “Pitch”)\n\nShruti is a Music Student from the US. She has learnt Western and Hindustani. She’s a celebrity since she is a starlet. She became more popular as the female singer of Harris’ “Adiye Kolludhe…” in Vaaranam Aayiram. She has already sung as a child in “Potri Paadadi Penne..” in Maestro’s Music in her father’s Devar Magan; then as an adolecent in Karthik Raja’s Music “Jolly jolly life..” in Ullasam. But I didnt like her voice in Adiye Kolluthe. It’s so manly and hence suited Sameera Reddy, who’s much more manlier. I felt her voice like younger version of Kamal’s “Avvai Shanmugi” voice. She made debut as a Heroine in Bollywood this year through “LUCK”. She made debut as a singer last year, as a music director this year. Hope she would have made some good Music.\n\nP.S: Kamal annonced in the function that he is gonna direct KB in his next film before Mysskin’s Historic Movie. Really a great News for those who are fans of Kamal and his discoverer KB."
