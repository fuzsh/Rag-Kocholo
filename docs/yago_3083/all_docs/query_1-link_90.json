Much to his father’s annoyance, he brings his westernized girlfriend (Gautami) with him to meet his family. Saktivelu plans on opening a chain of restaurants in Chennai which saddens Periya thevar as he wanted his son to help the villagers with his education.\n\nPeriya Thevar is a well respected village chief. His younger brother and his nephew Maya Thevar (Nasser) holds a huge grudge against him over a family feud. Since most of the village is divided into these two brothers faction and as Maya Thevar always tries to one up Periya Thevar, it puts them at loggerheads with each other.\n\nSaktivelu spends time in the village with his girlfriend by re-visiting his childhood memories. They come across an old temple which has been closed off on Maya Thevar’s instructions. He insists on entering and his friend and servant Esaki (Vadivelu) breaks open the lock for them to look around. Maya Thevar hears of this and a brutal riot is started among the two village factions. Periya thevar, in order to quell the situation, contemplates on apologising to his opponents. Sakthivelu feels it should be him or Esaki who should apologise. When Saktivelu asks for esaki, he learns that Maya Thevar has amputated Easki’s hand for opening the temple. In order to prevent further escalation of the situation Saktivelu, with permission from his father, enlists the help of his friends in the government and opens the temple for all legally. Slighted by this, Maya Thevar, hires goons to break a dam protecting a part of the village faction that supports Periya Thevar. Although one of the villagers spots one of the goons near the dam, he doesn’t think much of it.\n\nThe dam is damaged by explosives used by the goons which results in flooding of half the village. This results in lots of death including infants which deeply saddens Saktivelu. He spots the goon who placed the explosives again in the village and gives chase. After capturing, he hands the goon over to the police but the goon doesn’t give up Maya Thevar's involvement due to fear for his family’s life.\n\nLater in order to go one up on shakthi, Maya thevar closes a portion of his land to prevent the public from reaching the mainroad easily. Sakthivelu and his father invite them for talks at village Panchayat. In the village panchayat accusations fly from both sides. With no evidence backing up the truth, Maya Thevar accuses Periya Thevar for orchestrating various attacks on his brother's family. Disrespected and broken, Periya Thevar returns to his home and passes away soon. Saktivelu takes over his father’s duties as the head of the village.\n\nAs time passes, this incident dies down. The villagers express concern to Saktivelu about going around a piece of land belonging to Maya Thevar’s side of the village everyday to work in their farm which causes a much longer travelling time. Saktivelu reasons with the owner of the land to open it up for all villagers to pass so that their long commute is shortened. Although understanding and willing, the land owner is afraid of Maya Thevar’s backlash especially since he has a daughter (Revathi). Saktivelu assures his fear by arranging marriage between a well-to-do person from his village to the land owners daughter. Everybody involved happily agrees and the land owner opens up the land for everyone.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, the groom runs away fearing Maya-thevar. The landowner and his daughter are distraught over this claiming that it is a huge disrespect for his family and even if someone marries his daughter, they have to live in constant fear. Saktivelu then gets permission from landowner and weds his daughter. At first, although Saktivelu still has feelings for his girlfriend and his new bride is very shy, they overcome their awkwardness and move on. But soon, his girlfriend comes back and learns the truth. Although sadden, she understands the situation and leaves. Saktivelu, too, closes the chapter about his girlfriend and starts his new life with his wife.\n\nMaya-thevar, again slighted by the opening of the land, plants bomb in the village festival. This results in a lot of death on both sides of the village. Both factions of the village, wanting revenge, go after Maya-thevar and his family. Saktivelu protects the innocent family including his uncle and helps them get away from the villagers. Appreciative of Saktivelu’s efforts to protect them, they give away Maya-thevar's hiding location.\n\nSaktivelu goes to meet Maya-thevar and asks him to surrender to the police before the villagers kill him. Maya-thevar’s rabid hate for Saktivelu makes his reject his offer for help. Maya-thevar blaming Saktivelu for all his problems tries to kill Saktivelu. In the struggle that follows, Saktivelu accidentally kills Maya-thevar. Although other villagers are willing to take the blame for the kill, Saktivelu gives himself up to the police.\n\nAwards\n\n1993 National Film Awards (India)\n\nWon - Silver Lotus Award - Best Regional Film (Tamil) - Kamal Hassan (as producer)\n\nWon - Silver Lotus Award - Best Supporting Actress - Revathi\n\nWon - Silver Lotus Award - Best Playback Singer (Female) - S.
