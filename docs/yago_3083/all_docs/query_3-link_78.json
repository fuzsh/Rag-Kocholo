        "text": "After 28 years of waiting, fans will finally get to watch the story of Senapathy after the events of the 1996 movie Indian. Superstar Kamal Haasan played the lead role in the film and is reprising his savage character in the upcoming Shankar-directed Indian 2. As the movie is just a few days away from its release, fans are recalling what happened to Senapathy at the end of the first movie.\n\nFor the unversed, Senapathy is an Indian freedom fighter who still tries to safeguard citizens from malpractices done by people in power. He does not spare anyone, not even his family members when it comes to fighting for the truth. By the end of the Indian movie of 1996, it was clear that Senapathy’s story was set to have a lot more adventures and fights. Ahead of Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2, here is a recap of the previous film:\n\nKamal Haasan Indian (1996) recap & spoilers\n\nIn the Indian movie, Kamal Haasan played dual roles and was the protagonist and antagonist of the plot. It begins with the introduction of a killer who is on a murder spree. CBI officer Krishnaswamy suspects that the murderer is over 70 years of age. He comes to this conclusion on the basis of a letter that he found after the murder of a government officer. It is later revealed that Senapathy, an old freedom fighter, is the one who has been killing all corrupt officials. He was a member of the INA, led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and still fights for people’s rights.\n\nOn the other hand, Chandrabose, aka Chandru, is a small-time broker who helps people bribe the right officials to get their work done. It soon turns out that Chandru is Senapathy’s son, and the two do not get along due to the latter’s excessive insistence on righteousness and honesty. When Krishnaswamy finds Senapathy’s house, he and his wife escape. Here is when the viewers learn that Senapathy knows the martial arts known as Varma Kalai and is as powerful as he could be.\n\nThings get intense when Chandru becomes a brake inspector through bribing. He approves a school bus with faulty brakes, and it kills 40 children. Senapathy gets angry at his carelessness and tries to kill his son. By this time, he has become a hero for the citizens who look up to him. When he attempts to kill Chandru, Krishnaswamy arrests him. Senapathy then flees from the prison and finally kills his son at the airport. After an explosion at the airport, it is believed that Senapathy died. However, he calls Krishnaswamy from Hong Kong and promises to return when he is needed by the people.\n\nMore details to know before Indian 2 release\n\nKamal Haasan is returning as Senapathy in the upcoming movie Indian 2. As the makers unveiled the movie’s trailer, fans began wondering about Senapathy’s age in the film. For the unversed, he is playing a 106-year-old man in the upcoming flick. Per 123telugu.com, Kamal Haasan opened up about his character’s highly discussed age. He said, “That age has to be determined by the director. I would like to act even when I am 120.”\n\nShankar further confirmed that Senapathy is a master in martial arts, which is the reason behind his ability to fight at his age. He said, “There is a martial arts master in China. His name is Lu Zijian. At the age of 120, he is performing martial arts. He is flying, kicking, and doing all the stuff. This Senapathy character is also a master. He is well-versed in the ancient martial art called Varma Kalai. Senapathy has discipline regarding his food habits. He practices yoga and meditation and eats only once a day. So, if you are a master in your craft and have discipline, age doesn’t matter. You can perform any kind of stunt.”\n\nBesides Kamal Haasan, the movie also stars Siddharth, Priya Bhavani Shankar, and others. The film is slated to hit theaters on July 12, 2024."
