        "text": "By: ASJAD NAZIR\n\nA WATCHLIST OF THE LEGENDARY STAR’S MOST MEMORABLE MOVIES AHEAD OF HIS NEW RELEASE VIKRAM\n\nLEGENDARY actor Kamal Haasan makes a welcome return with big budget film Vikram.\n\nHe stars alongside popular stars Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil in the dark Tamil action thriller, which will also have dubbed versions released in various other languages. The explosive film adds to an impressive body of work for the unstoppable 67-year-old cinema icon, who has been entertaining audiences ever since he made his debut as a six-year-old in 1960.\n\nEastern Eye got ready for blockbuster release Vikram by taking on the impossible task of preparing a watchlist of the actor’s 20 most memorable movies, listed in chronological order.\n\nApoorva Raagangal (1975): The visionary actor started taking risks very early in his career and that was perfectly illustrated by this unique cross-generational romantic drama. He plays a man who falls for a much older woman, while her daughter gets drawn to his father. The film won multiple honours, including a National and Filmfare South Best Film in Tamil. The portrayal resulted in him winning his first Filmfare Award in Tamil. Interestingly, it marked the cinematic debut of south Indian superstar Rajinikanth in a supporting part and was remade in Bollywood as Ek Nai Paheli (1984), with Haasan reprising his role.\n\nSigappu Rojakkal (1978): Another early indicator in the actor’s career as a leading man that he would do things differently was this Tamil psychological thriller, which earned him a fourth consecutive Filmfare Best Actor Award. He plays a suave serial killer in the film, which was later remade in Bollywood as Red Rose (1980) with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role.\n\nEk Duuje Ke Liye (1981): In 1978, Kamal Haasan had starred in Telugu film Maro Charithra and then reprised his role in the incredibly successful Bollywood remake, which elevated the cross-cultural romantic tragedy further. He stars opposite Rati Agnihotri in the story of two individuals from very different backgrounds, who fall in love. The film includes classic song Tere Mere Beech Main.\n\nMoondram Pirai (1982): The actor won the first of his three National Best Actor Awards for his portrayal of a schoolteacher caring for an amnesia patient.

This includes Tamil comedy Vasool Raja MBBS (2004), which was a great remake of Bollywood film Munnabhai MBBS (2003). His best remake was this clever adaptation of Bollywood thriller A Wednesday (2008). He stars opposite Mohanlal in the films, which were simultaneously shot in Tamil (Unnaipol Oruvan) and Telugu (Eenadu). They collectively managed to elevate the original movie of an anonymous caller who has planted bombs and the police officer on his trail.\n\nVishwaroopam (2013): It may have caused some controversy upon release, but that didn’t stop the spy thriller filmed simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi from being a big success.
