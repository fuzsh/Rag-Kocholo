Both of them did that. The duo goofed around in the video too. The clip also featured Deepika's iconic dialogue from the film--Kahan se khareedi aisi bakwaas dictionary (where from did you buy such useless dictionary).\n\nFans say SRK predicted Deepika will be part of Singham franchise\n\nSharing the clip, Deepika captioned it, \"How many times do you think I’ve had to repeat this dialogue!? Sahi jawaab ko milega ‘Ek Bakwaas Dictionary’ (Right answers will get a 'useless dictionary'!!! (Laughing emojis).\" After her post, many of the fans reacted, and one of them wrote, \"We need such entertainment movies back!!\" Another mentioned, \"Dialogue must have repeated 20 times.\"\n\nWhile the other wrote, \"I can't miss this movie.\" A fan said, \"He envisioned it before anyone else that she would be doing a Singham movie.\" \"Wow, SRK predicted that Deepika would be part of the Singham franchise. Brilliant.\" \"Love their chemistry, love the film, love SRK,\" read a comment.\n\nAbout Chennai Express\n\nHelmed by Rohit Shetty, Chennai Express revolves around a Tamil girl Meenamma (Deepika) who falls in love with a North Indian guy Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), who boards the Chennai Express train from Mumbai carrying the ashes of his late grandfather, supposed to be immersed in Rameshwaram, while he intends to go to Goa instead.\n\nAbout Singham franschise\n\nSingham is a 2011 action film and is the first installment of Rohit's Cop Universe.
