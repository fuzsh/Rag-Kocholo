        "text": "Legendary Indian actor Kamal Haasan is teaming up with the filmmaker Mani Ratnam once again for their much-anticipated project. Previously known as KH 234, the film has now been revealed as Thug Life. The announcement was made on November 7, 2023, marking Kamal Haasan’s birthday. Likewise, the news created a buzz among fans of the actor as well as the director.\n\nCheck the Thug Life title announcement here:\n\nKamal Haasan’s Thug Life teaser, plot, and more\n\nThe official announcement came alongside a gripping teaser that offers a glimpse into the mysterious world of Thug Life. In the teaser, Kamal Haasan introduces himself as Rangarayar Sakthivel Naiker, a character who seems to be deeply involved in the criminal underworld. He explains the meaning of yakuza (a Japanese term synonymous with gangster) before showing his unique martial arts costume.\n\nHe says, “My name is Rengaraya Sakthivel Nayakan. Kayalpattu Kaaran. The moment I was born, they decided my fate that I was a criminal… gonda… Yakuza. In Japanese, Yakuza means gangster.”\n\nThe teaser captivates fans with brilliantly choreographed action sequences, which are expertly captured by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran. What sets this teaser apart is the South Tamil Nadu dialect and incongruous dialogs. It leaves viewers questioning the setting of the film, whether it’s in the past, future, or a fantasy world. As it is, this suspense seems to be the essence of Thug Life.\n\nThug Life cast includes Dulquer Salman, Trisha, Jayam Ravi and more\n\nWhile the teaser had already piqued fan’s interest, the cast of Thug Life adds more excitement to the film. Joining Kamal Haasan and Mani Ratnam is Dulquer Salmaan, who expressed his gratitude for the opportunity and calling it a “legendary reunion of the masters.”\n\nTrisha Krishnan, another talented actress, is also part of the cast. Shared her excitement about collaborating with Kamal Hasan and Mani Ratnam, saying, “Blessed when dreams come true multiple times. Thrilled to collaborate again with the legendary powerhouses Mani sir and Kamal sir.”\n\nHowever, Thug Life doesn’t stop at these star-studded names. It boasts an ensemble cast that includes Nayanthara, Pankaj Tripathi, Jayam Ravi, and Ananditha.\n\nKamal Haasan & Mani Ratnam’s KH 234 to have A.R. Rahman music\n\nOne of the most iconic aspects of any Indian film is its music, and Thug Life lives up to this expectation. A.R. Rahman, who is renowned for his remarkable contribution to the world of music, composes the film’s music.\n\nThe project is a collaborative effort between Raaj Kamal Films and Madras Talkies, with a screenplay co-written by Jeyamohan and Mani Ratnam. The production is done by Haasan’s Raaj Kamal Films International, Mani Ratnam’s Madras Talkies, and Udhayanidhi Stalin’s Red Giant Movies.\n\nKamal Haasan & Mani Ratnam collaborate after 36 years\n\nAfter their iconic collaboration in Nayakan, Haasan, and Ratnam have reunited after 36 years to bring fans Thug Life. Additionally, the duo are coming off the biggest hits of their careers. Haasan’s Vikram grossed a whopping $60 million, while Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan: 1 also achieved the same remarkable figure.\n\nAll in all, bringing their big guns to this next venture, Thug Life is set to be the next blockbuster."
