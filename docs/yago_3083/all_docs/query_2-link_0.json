        "text": "Kamal Haasan is an Indian actor, film director, film producer, screenwriter and dance choreographer who works primarily in Tamil cinema. At the age of 5, he debuted as a child actor in the 1960 Tamil film Kalathur Kannamma, directed by A. Bhimsingh, which won him the President's Gold Medal.[1] Since then, he has acted in over 230 films in Tamil and other languages including Malayalam, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Bengali.[2] After a few projects as a child artist, he took a break to continue his education. He later concentrated on dance choreography and worked as an assistant choreographer. During this time, he made uncredited appearances in a few films which he worked on.[1]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1973, Haasan landed his first adult role as Thiagu in the film Arangetram by K. Balachander, whom the actor considers his mentor. He continued to act in minor roles in several films such as Sollathaan Ninaikkiren (1973) and Naan Avanillai (1974), most of which were directed by Balachander. His breakthrough as an independent lead actor came with the 1974 Malayalam film Kanyakumari.[1] His work in it won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam). Following that, he starred in a series of films in both languages—Tamil and Malayalam. His breakthrough in Tamil cinema came with Balachander's Apoorva Raagangal (1975) and AS.Prakasam's Pattaampoochi (1975); Apoorva Raagangal earned him a second Filmfare Award, his first in Tamil.[1] Between 1974 and 1978, he won six Filmfare Awards including four consecutive wins for the Best Actor (Tamil). Haasan turned producer for Raja Paarvai (1981), in which he played the lead role of a blind musician.[3] The film was produced under the \"Haasan Brothers\" banner which was later renamed Raaj Kamal Films International.\n\nHaasan debuted in Bollywood with Balachander's Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), which was a remake of his 1978 Telugu film Maro Charitra. His role as a school teacher who looks after an amnesic girl in Moondram Pirai (1982) won him several accolades, including the Best Actor honours at the National Film Awards and Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He then starred in the Panchu Arunachalam-written Sakalakala Vallavan, which expanded Kamal's popularity from classes to the masses. His role in Ramesh Sippy's Hindi film Saagar (1985), a triangular love story, was nominated in both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories at the 33rd Filmfare Awards.[1][4] Under Raaj Kamal Films International, he produced films such as: Vikram (1986), Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989), Thevar Magan (1992) and Hey Ram (2000). As a producer, he won a Filmfare Award and National Film Award for Apoorva Sagodharargal and Thevar Magan. Seven films featuring Kamal have been submitted by India to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the most for any actor in India.[5] His work Vishwaroopam (2013), which he also produced and directed, won two awards at the 60th National Film Awards.[6] He has starred in both blockbuster and art house films.\n\nAs actor\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Kamal Haasan film credits as actor Year Film Role Language Notes Ref. 1960 Kalathur Kannamma Selvam Tamil Child artist [7] 1962 Parthal Pasi Theerum Babu & Kumar [8] Paadha Kaanikkai Ravi [9] Kannum Karalum Babu Malayalam [10] 1963 Vanambadi Ravi Tamil [11] Anandha Jodhi Balu [12] 1970 Maanavan Student\n\nUncredited\n\n(Special appearance in the song \"Visiladichan Kunjugala\")\n\n[13] 1971 Annai Velankanni Jesus Uncredited [14] 1972 Prathikaram Punjabi singer Malayalam\n\nUncredited\n\n(Special appearance in the song \"Madhuram Madhuram\")\n\n[15] Kurathi Magan Tamil [16] 1973 Arangetram Thiagu [17] Sollathaan Ninaikkiren Kamal [18] 1974 Paruva Kaalam Chandran Gumasthavin Magal Mani [20][21] Naan Avanillai Appu Cameo [18] Kanyakumari Sankaran Malayalam [22] Anbu Thangai Buddha Tamil\n\nUncredited\n\n(Special appearance in the song \"Mannargal Vanagum\")\n\n[24] Vishnu Vijayam Vishnu Malayalam [25] Aval Oru Thodar Kathai Prasad Tamil [26] Panathukkaga Kumar 1975 Cinema Paithiyam Natarajan Pattampoochi Siva Aayirathil Oruthi Kamal Then Sindhudhe Vaanam Ravi Melnaattu Marumagal Raja Thangathile Vairam Kumar Pattikkaattu Raja Mahesh Njan Ninne Premikkunnu Suresh Malayalam Maalai Sooda Vaa Tamil Apoorva Raagangal Prasanna [28] Thiruvonam Prem Kumar Malayalam Mattoru Seetha Gopi Raasaleela Devan Andharangam Kaanthan Tamil 1976 Agni Pushpam Somu Malayalam Appooppan Babumon Samasya Manmadha Leelai Madhu Tamil Anthuleni Katha Arun Telugu Cameo [30] Swimming Pool Malayalam Aruthu Satyam Kumaran Tamil Oru Oodhappu Kan Simittugiradhu Ravi [31] Unarchigal Selvam [32] Kuttavum Shikshayum Malayalam Kumara Vijayam Kumar Tamil [33] Idhaya Malar Mohan Ponni Maran Malayalam [34] Nee Ente Lahari Moondru Mudichu Balaji Tamil [35] Mogam Muppadhu Varusham Ramesh Lalitha Balu 1977 Uyarnthavargal Aarumugam [36] Siva Thandavum Malayalam [37] Aasheervaadam Avargal Janardhan (Johnny) Tamil Madhura Swapanam Malayalam Aaina Prem Kapoor Hindi Uncredited [17] Sreedevi Venugopal Malayalam Unnai Suttrum Ulagam Raja Tamil Kabita Gopal Bengali [40] Ashtamangalyam Malayalam Nirakudam Devan Ormakal Marikkumo Chandrasekharan 16 Vayathinile Gopalakrishnan (Chappani) Tamil Aadu Puli Attam Madan Aanandham Paramaanandham Babu Malayalam Naam Pirandha Mann Ranjith Tamil [43] Kokila Vijaykumar Kannada [44] Satyavan Savithri Sathyavan Malayalam Aadhya Paadam 1978 Madanolsavam Raju Kaathirunna Nimisham Raju Anumodhanam Avalude Ravukal Un­known Guest appearance [45] Nizhal Nijamagiradhu Sanjeevi Tamil Aval Viswasthayayirunnu Anto Malayalam Guest appearance Maro Charitra Balaji S. a.k.a.
