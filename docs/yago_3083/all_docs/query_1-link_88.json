        "text": "What is the one word that comes when you think of Kamal Hassan? “Ulaganayagan(Universal hero)”, Cinema encyclopedia, Indian Al Pacino are some of the words associated with the 60-year-old man from Paramakudi. He has been such an important personality in the South Indian entertainment industry for a career that has lasted over 50 years. Kamal Hassan wanted to be a director when he entered the film industry and was relentlessly pursuing a lot of people who gave the actor a big NO to his idea. It was K.Balachander who advised Kamal to pursue a career in acting and gave him a direction that has given us such an iconic actor. No wonder he was called “Margadarisi” in “Uthama Villain (2015)”\n\nKamal has won three National awards (Kalathur Kannama (1960), he won as best child artist), Sixteen Filmfare awards- south, an international film award (Virumandi (2004)) as a director, actor, producer. He assisted Raghuram master when Raghuram was at his peak. He has worked closely with Ananthu on various scripts when he was very young. He has sung some of the most important songs in Tamil film music history. What hasn’t he done?\n\nHe is probably the only actor in the Indian film industry who is strictly against commercial cinema, even his counterparts Rajinikanth, Mohan Lal, Mammooty have not stopped their commercial work. Kamal as an actor was exciting, but as a director and a scriptwriter is, even more interesting. Raja Paarvai is certainly a very bold attempt by an actor and if the actor is producing such a script then we know that there is going to be some audacious attempt by this actor in future and that is exactly what Kamal Hassan gave us. Be it the confused man searching for his identity in “Thevar Magan(1992)” or brilliant fictional work of Saketh Ram trying to assassinated Gandhi in “Heyram(2000)” or taking a road movie to another level and pass a social commentary on communism, advertising, love, affection on “Anbe Sivam (2004)” or Kurosawa style narration of story of “Viruman” in Virumandi, Kamal has done it all. He can be as convincing as scared Eelam Tamilian in “thenali” and as the strict police officer in ” Vettaiyadu Villayadu”. The best part about Kamal is that he is an extremely spontaneous actor and could effortlessly pull off a two-page dialogue scene as well as a wry smile he gives in “Kadhala Kadhala”. But there have been a lot of accusations about Kamal copying a lot of Hollywood actors and film maker’s style. There are few people who claim that he copies Al Pacino, some say he copies Brando, Kamal himself has said in an interview that he resembles a lot like Dustin Hoffman. But is it true that the actor who has given us gems is mere an imitator?\n\nWith “Papanasam” receiving great reviews and celebrated by his fans, let’s take a look back at the five of actor’s best work which were either great imitations or brilliant adaptations( It is for you to say)\n\n5) Papanasam,2015\n\nRemade from: Drishyam, 2013\n\nStarring: Mohan Lal, Meena\n\nDirector: Jeethu Joesph\n\nWhen it was announced that Kamal would be remaking Drishyam, there was a wide speculation that actor shouldn’t do as it was the very simple film for Kamal Hassan to add to his filmography. But it was completely wrong. Just by looking at people’s facebook posts and tweets, we know Kamal Hassan has nailed it and has given a completely different dimension to the cult classic from Malayalam. Lal’s performance as Georgekutty is absolutely tremendous and will stay as one of the greatest performances in Indian film history. His controlled demeanor and very tough body language were something of a treat to all the movie buffs. Kamal’s Swayambu is completely different from Lal’s Georgekutty and in some places have even overshadowed the original’s work. Pre-Climax is one such example When Kamal utters “Chinna vayasu paathingala” and sniffs, we (Andavar fans who have seen the original) totally forgot what Lal did in that moment in the original.\n\n4) Anbe Sivam,2003\n\nInspired from: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles,1987\n\nStarring: Steve Martin, John Candy\n\nDirector: John Hughes\n\nAnbe Sivam is still considered to be (one of) the greatest performances in Tamil Film history. The core of the movie is inspired from Steve Martin starred Trains, Planes, and Automobiles which was one of the classic comedies that came in 1987 and is also featured in Roger Ebert’s great movies collection. Steve Martin’s portrayal of Neal is simply brilliant. The scene where John Candy confesses that he used Neal’s credit card and Martin’s reaction is extremely hilarious. John Candy as the salesman Del is a gem which has been one of the most underrated performances in Hollywood. Anbe Sivam as film rides on the same concept but this is certainly one of Kamal’s best screenplay adding Communism, Advertising, Wage wars and Love to the road movie is brilliant. The best part about Kamal’s acting is that you don’t find Kamal after ten minutes into the movie, it is Nalla Sivam, overly talkative, friendly, lovable communist on screen. It was one of the finest display of acting by both the lead actors. Madhavan was excellent as A(nbu)Arasu in the movie and he had an equal space in the movie to perform. Kamal films have some of the finest actors in Tamil Cinema like Nassar( Thevar Magan,1992), Pasupathy (Virumandi,2004), Delhi Ganesh and several others. Madhavan is a very important addition in that list. Arguments, Insults and Friendly chats between Madhavan and Kamal are a treat to watch. Kamal’s “Naatuku oru seithi solla” song is one of the most entertaining songs of that decade.\n\n3) Virumandi,2004\n\nInspired from Life of David Gale, Rashamon ( Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet, Laura Linney\n\nDirector: Alan Parker\n\nLife of David Gale was a very confused film. It neither dealt with the capital punishment activism nor with the murder mystery of one of the most important characters in the movie. Kevin Spacey was, as usual, was brilliant as David Gale. The breakdown scene where he calls his ex-wife and pleads her to allow him to talk to his son would be practiced by most acting schools in United states. But neither it created an impact or it stayed long enough to achieve a cult status. Again Kamal takes the core of this movie and treats it with his own approach. Of course, it was told in Rashomon style but you have to give credit for Kamal for bringing in a world class cinema in Tamil. His brilliance lies in telling the story of Virumandi who is an aggressive individual who did not have a great education where as David Gale was a scholar and a Harvard graduate. It was probably the only film where the actor gave a great screen space to a new comer like Pasupathy ( He was brilliant theater actor) and boy! Didn’t he deliver? Pasupathy effortlessly did Kothala Thevar who’s character is so gray that will make E.L.James to shame. He was a mix of Joker, Frank Costello, Henry combined. One of the greatest performances we have ever seen. Apart from memorable performances by the actors, Ilayaraja’s raw music was a backbone to this cult classic. It was like the resurrection of Bharathiraja’s Ilayaraja from the 80’s. I could still hear the background score in my ears when I am writing this. Fortunately, people accepted that it should even get the commercial status and made it a success.\n\n2) ThevarMagan,1992\n\nInspired from Godfather1\n\nStarring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nThevar Magan and Nayagan were heavily inspired from Godfather, One was actor’s best work as screenplay writer till date and the other one was the actor’s best work as an actor till date ( I would still rate Anbe Sivam as the greatest performance he has ever done). A Wedding, Horse’s head on the bed, Gun in the toilet, Oranges signifying death. Godfather is the one of the greatest movie ever made. The movie should be saved even if the whole world is being destroyed to pieces. This is such an immense contribution to the field of art, cinema in particular. There were loads of Godfather that were coming out in 80’s, 90’s and even till date. None has even been executed with the same perfection we saw in this 70’s gem. Brando as Vito Corleone is still the most feared Gangster than Abu Salem, Dawood Ibrahim, and Chhota Shakeel combined. Gripping screen presence, unadulterated Italian accent, and solid body language make it one of most pioneering work in the entertainment industry. Al Pacino as Micheal Corleone was this budding actor who has made only two films earlier had to carry half the movie on his soldier and he did much more than that. His portrayal of Micheal is unforgettable. Many actors tried their version of Micheal in different movies and none was close this. Godfather in many ways is a dictionary for film making. Kamal opened this dictionary twice in his career and gave us two unforgettable movies. Thevar Magan was Kamal’s Godfather set in Theni and is not a mob film, is more of a caste-based wars that happen frequently in Theni and Madurai districts in Tamil Nadu. Sivaji as Periya Thevar does what Brando does in Godfather. This was very similar to Godfather. The primary reason being Sivaji was this aging star who has done remarkable work in his earlier movies and had a dull period in the middle and came back with this role to prove the form is temporary, a class is permanent. Brando even had a dull period, His last best role was On the waterfront and had suffered a box office decline and it was this role which made the Actor go back in Top ten. Kamal was better equipped and had done different roles than what Pacino did but both these young actors were filling in the shoes of the legends both in a movie as well as in the Industry. The Beautiful love triangle between Revathi, Kamal, Gouthami gives us the glimpse of what the actor turned screenwriter was capable of. Nassar’s role as Mayan is still his best till date. He was the Satan which would eventually turn Kamal to take up Violence. In a way, he succeeds in the movie. Ilayaraja’s songs and the background is one of the most pioneering works in Tamil Film Industry, still he lost to A.R.Rahman’s score in Roja (1992) with the help of Raja’s dear friend Balu Mahendra. Kamal’s role is very similar to Micheal Corleone but the portrayal is completely different. Kamal becomes a controlled Thevar without any one guiding him where as Micheal had to rely on Sony, Hagen and other mobsters to take over the throne. Diane Keaton and Gouthami’s role were different. Keaton did question the violence and was against the Corleone’s principles but Gouthami’s role was restricted to only the love story. Wish they could have done it slightly better. But nonetheless, both were epics on their own ways. One is a Hollywood dictionary and the other one is a south Indian film dictionary.\n\n1) Nayakan, 1987\n\nInspired from: Godfather1\n\nStarring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nWell, Nayakan is a daring attempt in many ways. Making a thirty-year-old to play a sixty-year-old gangster with utmost perfection and combining two Godfather films and creating a different ending as GodfatherIII was released after this movie was made, coming off age movie set in Mumbai. There are lot more such attempts in the movie. It was Mani’s vision and only his vision. This was probably the last movie where Kamal proved that he could even act to his full potential in other’s script. Kamal’s Velu Nayakar had a mix of De Niro’s Vito Corleone, Al Pacino’s Micheal Corleone, and Brando’s Vito Corleone. This is something extremely hard for an actor at the age of thirty to portray and he came out with flying colors. Raja’s background and Bala Kumaran’s dialogues held the film along with Kamal’s brilliance and Mani’s vision of creating an epic. Nayakan in many ways is the start of a movement for the new wave of filmmaking. This is an Epic. We could talk a lot more about Nayakan and that would be in the upcoming series.\n\nWell, to conclude, Kamal has been more of an inspired actor than an imitator. His Nayakan days where he imitated Brando, Pacino, and De Niro was slowly deteriorating and was giving rise to an actor who many people would imitate."
