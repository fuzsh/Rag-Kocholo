        "text": "Synopsis\n\nOn borrowing MGR's legacy, Haasan acknowledged it would remind of the yesteryear veteran.\n\nCHENNAI: Borrowing the legacy of yesteryear superstar and late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MG Ramachandran, actor Kamal Haasan has named his state-wide political tour starting February 21 as 'Naalai Namathey' after the title of the film starring MGR.\n\nHaasan, who has announced his foray into politics in Tamil Nadu, today unveiled his plans to adopt a village and make it a model one, with special focus on education, transport and civic amenities.\n\nWriting in his weekly series 'Ennul Maiyam Konda Puyal,' (The Storm Centered in me) in Tamil magazine 'Ananda Vikatan,' Haasan sub-titled this week's column as \"Munmathiri Gramam... Nalai Namathey Payanam. Muzhu Arasiyal Plan,\" meaning \"Model Village...Tomorrow is ours tour. Full Political plan.\"\n\nOn borrowing the legacy of MGR to name his tour, Haasan acknowledged it would remind of the yesteryear veteran.\n\n\"If the memories are about him (MGR), so be it.. We have given this name as they are good memories,\" Haasan said.\n\nRecalling that he and his fans have been involved in public service for many years, Haasan said that they have now decided to adopt a village and provide all required amenities, with special focus on education, sanitation, drinking water supply and transport, and make it a model village.\n\n\"Laptops and mobile phones cannot be eaten. But only they have reached many (in villages). I won't accept that mere provision of laptops will ensure knowledge. You need knowledge to operate that (laptop),\" he said, apparently taking a dig at the AIADMK government's free laptop distribution scheme for students.\n\nHe said people should be taught the art of catching fish as that alone would ensure them a life of self-respect, a reference to job creation.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
