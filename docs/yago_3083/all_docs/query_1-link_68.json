The\nstar explained that this environment was part of\nhis childhood experience. He plays Shaktivelu,\nthe modern son of Peria-thevar (Ganesan),\nwho returns to his ancestral home to introduce\nhis girlfriend (Gauthami) to his family. He\nbecomes involved in the bloody feuds between\ndifferent members of the clan led by Mayathevar\n(Nasser), and when his father dies he\nassumes the godfather’s mantle. The rival\nfamily is eventually annihilated in a gory\nending. Kamalahasan’s performance, especially\nin the second half, pays tribute to the\npatriarchal figure of Ganesan, the focus of a\nneo-traditionalist discourse valorising\nfundamentalism along with the star’s screen\nimage.",
