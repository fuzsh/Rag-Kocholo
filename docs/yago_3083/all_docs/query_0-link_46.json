A 1997 release, the film continues to receive the same love from the audiences.\n\nDeewaar\n\nOne of the biggest hits of megastar and cinema icon Amitabh Bachchan’s career ‘Deewaar’ is a 1975 actioner. The film takes us through the lives of two brothers Vijay Verma (Amitabh Bachchan) and Ravi Verma (Shashi Kapoor) who eventually end up becoming an underworld figure and police inspector respectively. A blockbuster, ‘Deewaar’ is hailed as one of Amitabh Bachchan’s greatest performances of all time.\n\nNayakan\n\nA 1987 Tamil epic crime drama written and directed by Mani Ratnam, ‘Nayakan’ stars Kamal Haasan, Saranya (in her feature debut) and Karthika in the lead. A blockbuster, ‘Nayakan’ narrates the story of a young boy who ends up becoming a gangster in Mumbai after witnessing his father’s brutal murder and taking revenge for it. Produced by Muktha Srinivasan, the film was a critical and commercial success.\n\nThevar Magan\n\nA 1992 Tamil drama, ‘Thevar Magan’ is helmed by Bharathan, and written and produced by Kamal Haasan. A creative masterpiece, the film's story revolves around the life of a respected village chieftain's son who aspires to do business but is expected by his father to help the villagers. The film co-stars Sivaji Ganesan, Revathi, Gautami and Nassar and more in pivotal roles.\n\nSiva\n\nThe Telugu crime action drama starring Nagarjuna Akkineni, Amala Akkineni and Raghuvaran in the lead, ‘Siva’ takes audiences through the life of a college student-turned-gangster.
