        "text": "As the legendary actor turns 59 today November 7, we look at some of his finest films.\n\nKamal Haasan received his first National Award in his debut film, Kalathur Kannamma, when he was just six years old.\n\nSince then he has won three more National Awards and received the Padma Shri in 1990 for his exceptional contributions to Indian cinema.\n\nOn his 59th birthday, we look at some of the memorable films of this talented actor.\n\nKalathur Kannamma\n\nKamal Haasan made his debut as a child artiste in 1960 in the film, Kalathur Kannamma, produced by A V Meiyappan.\n\nThough the film had seasoned artistes Gemini Ganesan and Savitri, it was Kamal Haasan’s endearing performance that really stood out.\n\nKalathur Kannamma is a sad, romantic story of a young couple who are separated by unfortunate circumstances while their innocent son is forced to grow up in an orphanage.\n\nA melodious song, Ammaavum Neeye, Appaavum Neeye picturised on young Kamal and the inmates of the orphanage became one of the highlights of the film.\n\nHe was just six years old then and his performance won him the President's Gold Medal, in 1961.\n\nThe 1982 blockbuster Moondram Pirai, directed by Balu Mahendra, earned Kamal his second National Film Award for Best Actor. Sridevi with whom he shared a great onscreen chemistry is paired opposite him.\n\nIn Moondram Pirai, Kamal plays a school teacher who rescues and takes care of an amnesic Sridevi, who forgets all about him when she recovers her memory.\n\nThe last scene at the railway station when he tries to gain her attention by playing all her favorite pranks, while she thinks that he is mentally challenged and is begging for food, is truly heartbreaking. It is one of his most memorable scenes that can still bring tears to your eyes.\n\nKamal Haasan has always been extremely passionate about experimenting.\n\nHe can effortlessly plays two, three, four and or even ten characters in a film without breaking a sweat. These are some of his unusual portrayals.\n\nThe silent black comedy Pushpaka Vimana, written and directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao, revolves around a poor and unemployed youth, who falsely assumes the identity of a millionaire to experience the affluent lifestyle.\n\nThis film proved that Kamal did not need long fancy dialogues to prove his acting prowess.\n\nWith just his facial expressions, eyes and body language, Kamal Haasan effortlessly managed to convey more meaning and understanding than words could have.\n\nPushpaka Vimana was considered a silent masterpiece and went on to win the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.\n\nKamal Haasan’s maiden production venture, Raja Paarvai, starring himself and Madhavi, was also his 100th film.\n\nThe film did not do very well at the box office and Kamal Haasan had to reportedly work for seven to eight years to make up the losses.\n\nKamal plays a blind violinist in the film who impresses Madhavi, a rich writer, with his ability to live independently despite his impairment.\n\nIt may not have done well when it was released, but Raja Paarvai is now considered a cult classic that was much ahead of its time.\n\nDasavathaaram, directed by K S Ravikumar was a science fiction movie written by Kamal, in which he played ten different roles.\n\nSome of the avatars, especially the foreign ones, like George Bush, did not go down well with the audience.\n\nThough Kamal has done his best to bring out the essence of each of the characters, there are many who believe that unlike his earlier films, Kamal has relied more on make-up rather than talent to distinguish between the characters.\n\nThere is enough evidence to prove that Kamal Haasan is a multi-faceted personality, an amazing combination of actor, writer, director, producer, singer, lyricist, and choreographer."
