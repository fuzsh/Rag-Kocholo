        "text": "It was Kamal Haasan's dream to make Marudhanayagam, a historical drama on the lines of period-film Ambikapathy. After a few days of filming, the movie was shelved due to financial constraints. Kamal Haasan, in a recent Instagram live session, opened up about the chances of reviving Marudhanayagam.\n\nIn a chat with Vijay Sethupathi for a popular YouTube channel, the Vishwaroopam actor revealed that Marudhanayagam's script needs to undergo many changes if he plans to revive it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe said, \"I had written the lead character thinking that he would be in his 40s. I'm too old to play the character today. If at all we get the money to fund the project, the film's script needs to be re-written or a young actor should be brought on board.\"\n\nKamal Haasan also revealed that he had written a ballad of sorts titled Chinna Kansa. It is based on demon Kansa (also called as Kamsa), uncle of Lord Krishna.\n\nHe added, \"Chinna Kansa is about the happenings after his death. A story like this would be easy and quick to make, unlike Marudhanayagam.\"\n\nMarudhanayagam was launched in the presence of Queen Elizabeth in August 1997. A few years ago, Kamal Haasan released a song with the visuals he had.\n\nKamal Haasan was shooting for director Shankar's Indian 2 before the nationwide lockdown was imposed. He also has another film titled Thalaivan Irukkindran, which is reportedly a sequel to the actor's super hit film, Thevar Magan.\n\nALSO SEE | Veteran sound recordist Sampath dies at 87.
