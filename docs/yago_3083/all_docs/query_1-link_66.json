        "text": "In Cheran's debut film Bharathi Kannamma, for instance, actor Vijaykumar who plays a Thevar zamindar, delivers a speech on what it means to be a \"true\" Thevar. He says anyone who carries a sickle or sports a moustache cannot be considered a Thevar and that a real one would be able to protect the \"honour\" of a woman against hundreds of enemies. He also speaks about the \"magnanimity\" that a \"true\" Thevar exhibits towards other castes.\n\n\"The martial nature of Thevars is to the fore in Thevar Magan where signs, weapons and dialogue all speak to the caste’s dominance. The advertising for the film reinforced the association between caste and violence. In Madurai, which has a stronger visual culture than other cities in Tamil Nadu, a 40-foot cut-out was installed showing the Thevar Magan hero brandishing an extra-large sword. More significantly still—as though to reinforce the association between life and art—the cut-out was positioned so that it faced the huge statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar in the heart of the city. During the annual “guru puja” (leader worship—processions and events to mark the anniversary of his birth), when followers of Thevar shut down the city to pay respects to and garland the statue, objections were raised against the cut-out and its glorification of violence. Consequently the sword was removed and placed behind the hoarding for a while. Due to popular pressure, however, it was later restored (Srinivas and Kaali 1998:225). Thus, as early as this, we see the imbrication of cinematic themes with popular forms of action and representation.\"\n\nIn the Rajinikanth film Yejaman, the hero who comes from a dominant caste group is venerated by the people around him to the extent that one of them says nobody even dares to walk in his footprints. The man then presses the sand on which Rajinikanth's character has walked, to his forehead.\n\nSpeaking about such glorified representations in the documentary, Stalin Rajangam, writer and lecturer, American College, Madurai*, says that by the '90s, communities and caste groups that had been classified as 'backward' came to assert themselves politically and claim their identities. This, he says, was because of certain political developments like the Mandal Commission which had been set up in 1979 to bring in reservation quota on the basis of caste. This assertion of identity also led to an acceptance of caste pride among certain sections.\n\nCinema halls in Madurai, Theni, and Kovilpatti districts where Bharathi Kannamma was screened were damaged because the film shows a Thevar falling at the feet of Dalits. Kaadhal, which is about 'honour' killings and is based on a real life story, was reportedly received with enthusiasm by the Thevars in cinema halls because they saw the violence as an assertion of their power. The Dalits, on the other hand, felt intimidated by the film.\n\nHe shares that the film had to go through 16 cuts because of which the politics in it looks imbalanced. Initially, the director says, there were scenes that show how caste is everywhere - among the students, office staff, and even the police. But much of this was removed. The film has Jayam Ravi playing a tribal forest guard who is looked down upon by his students because of his caste.\n\nResponding to Jananthan is Babu Ramasamy, former regional director of the CBFC, who explains that the guideline they follow is that it is all right to \"praise' any caste but that no caste must be denigrated. This means, he says, even the word 'Dalit' cannot be used.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about the term 'Dalit' in public discourse, with several thinking that the term in itself is an 'insult' when it is not so. In fact, the word is embraced by the oppressed as an assertion of their identity.\n\nIn the documentary, director Thangabachan says in his film Azhagi, he was asked to chop out a picture of Ambedkar in a school building (he is hesitant to mention who insisted on this). The shot appears after a scene in which two children fight over a book, with one child, who comes from a marginalised group, asking if people like him cannot study.\n\nVikram, who is half-Hindu and half-Christian, is considered to be Dalit. The Thevars had objected to the use of the title at the time, stating that it insulted their leader Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar who was called by the name in their community. The Damodar and Gorringe paper as well as the documentary mention the episode.\n\nThe film industry, like the rest of society, is divided along caste lines. In the documentary, Jananthan speaks of the \"namba aalu\" culture within it. That is, people from a certain caste keep recommending and promoting the work of others who belong to their same caste group. He adds that except the Dalits, every other caste group is organised and functions like a clique. The Dalits in the industry do not openly lay claim to their identity.\n\nIn an interview to TNM, Pa Ranjith had said, \"I was very interested to see the different kinds of criticism that the film (Kabali) earned. I haven't made a film that has pleased everyone but I don't think I can. I might be able to add some elements that make the film more interesting, but more acceptable? I don't think so. The whole fight is about who will accept you and who will not, so I cannot be a good man to everyone. If it's a war, the enemy has to be fought.\""
