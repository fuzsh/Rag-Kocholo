        "text": "Kamal Haasan portrayed Vikram in Vikram and which he also co-produced alongside R. Mahendran under the production banner Raaj Kamal Films International.\n\nHe reprised the role via voice in Leo .\n\nHe also sang and wrote Pathala Pathala\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKamal Haasan previously portrayed Vikram in 1986 film Vikram.\n\nMost of the guns and tankers which used in Vikram is owned by Kamal Hassan with proper licence.\n\nA day after the first single \"Pathala Pathala\" was released, on 12 May 2022, a police complaint was filed against the track and Kamal Haasan, by social activist named Selvan, claiming that the song mocks the Central government, by referring them as \"thieves\" and depicts their management of COVID-19 and its funds in the exchequer in a negative light, concerning that the lyrics might instigate caste-related conflicts. He also claimed that, a petition will be filed at the High court to stall the film's release, if the objectionable lyrics were not removed.\n\nVikram had plenty of references to Kamal Haasan's previous movies\n\nVikram (1986): Vikram acts as a spiritual successor to this movie. It is unknown if this movie is canon to Lokesh Cinematic Universe or not.\n\nPanchathantiram (Promo Only): This part is not canon to Lokesh Cinematic Universe. The main characters from the movie are in the conference call, discussing about the Vikram Front Page advertisement, which one of them mistakes for their friend Ram (Kamal Haasan's character). It looked like a Wanted Poster for Ram with the lifetime settlement as a reward. As it was realized the newspaper wasn't fully open, it was open to be seen as Vikram (where the second half of the name is Ram).\n\nVikram (1986): After Bejoy detonates the bombs that destroys Sandhanam's stash, Vikram grins at defeated Sandhanam and says \"நான் வெற்றி பெற்றவன். இமையம் தொட்டு விட்டவன். பகையை முட்டிவிட்டவன். தீயை சுட்டு விட்டவன். என் வீரமே வாகையே சூடும் / Naan vetri petravan. Imaiyam thottu vittavan. Pagaiyai muttivittavan. Theeyai suttu vittavan. En veerame vaagaiyae soodum\" (Rough: I am the conqueror who has touched the heart. He, who has defeated the enmity. He, who has shot the fire. My valor will burn). This is the actual first stanza of the old Vikram title song.\n\nNayagan and Viswaroopam: When Prabanjan's wife is unintentionally locked inside Vikram's safe vault, she asks Vikram \"நீங்க நல்லவரா கெட்டவரா / Neenga Nallavara Kettavara?\" (English: Are you a good guy or a bad guy?\").\n\nKamal Hassan gifted a car for Lokesh Kanagaraj and a Rolex watch for Suriya because of the huge success of Vikram.\n\nKamal Haasan produced movies with R. Mahendran under the production banner Raaj Kamal Films International.\n\nKamal Haasan is a frequent collaborator of Santhana Bharathi who worked together in Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, Raja Paarvai, Kadamai Kanniyam Kattupaadu, Gunaa, Michael Madana Kama Rajan, Mahanadhi, Nammavar, Magalir Mattum, Panchathantiram, Anbe Sivam, Nala Damayanthi, Vasool Raja MBBS, Mumbai Xpress, Dasavathaaram, Unnaipol Oruvan, Thoongaa Vanam, Meen Kuzhambum Mann Paanaiyum.\n\nKamal Haasan previously worked with Kalidas Jayaram in Meen Kuzhambum Mann Paanaiyum and will work again in Indian 2.\n\nKamal Haasan worked again with Lokesh Kanagaraj, Philomin Raj in a music video Inimel.\n\nKamal Haasan will work again with Anirudh Ravinchander & Udhayanidhi Stalin in Indian 2.\n\nAccolades[]"
