        "text": "Indian 2 domestic box office\n\nAccording to the report, Indian 2 earned ₹25.6 crore [Tamil: ₹16.5 crore; Hindi: ₹1.2 crore; Telugu: ₹7.9 crore] on day one. Indian 2 earned ₹18.2 crore [Tamil: ₹13.7 crore; Hindi: ₹1.3 crore; Telugu: ₹3.2 crore] on day two. The film collected ₹15.35 crore [Tamil: ₹11.35 crore; Hindi: ₹1.4 crore; Telugu: ₹2.6 crore] on day three.\n\nOn day four, Indian 2 earned ₹3 crore [Tamil: ₹2 crore; Hindi: ₹35 lakh; Telugu: ₹65 lakh]. The film earned ₹3 crore nett in India as per early estimates on its day five for all languages. So far, the film has minted ₹65.15 crore in India.\n\nAbout Indian 2\n\nOne of the most-awaited Tamil films of the year, Indian 2 saw the reunion of two big names – Kamal Haasan and S Shankar, after 28 years. Indian 2 is the sequel to the 1996 cult film Indian, directed by Shankar. It is jointly produced by Lyca Productions and Red Giant Movies.\n\nThe film also stars Siddharth, S J Suryah, Bobby Simha, Gulshan Grover and late Nedumudi Venu. The music for the original film was by AR Rahman, while Anirudh composed the music for the sequel.\n\nKamal return as Senapathy\n\nIn the film, Kamal revives the role of Senapathy, called 'Indian Thatha' lovingly by fans. He fights corruption, armed with the ancient martial art practice of India, 'varma kalai'.\n\nThe decision to revive Senapathy's character, who would be 106 years old as per the plot, was one of the questions the Indian 2 team had to often field when they met the press during promotional tours. At a press conference in Mumbai in June, Kamal had joked that he would like to act even when he turns 120 years old.\n\nWhen Shankar spoke about Senapathy's age\n\nShankar had defended his decision by pointing out to a 120-year-old Chinese martial artist. \"There is a martial art master in China, his name is Lu Zijian. At the age of 120 he is performing martial arts, he is flying and kicking and all. This Senapathy character is also a master, master in an ancient martial art called Varma,\" Shankar had said as quoted by news agency PTI. Indian 2 hit the theatres on July 12."
