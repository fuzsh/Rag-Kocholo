        "text": "Kamal Haasan, the actor turned full time politician, is eagerly awaiting the outcome of the Lok Sabha and Tamil Nadu by-elections, even as his ardent fans were waiting for news about the shooting of his Indian 2 sequel. But the latest buzz is that the Viswaroopam star has opted to film the sequel to his cult classic Thevar Magan before taking up Indian 2, which may have been put on hold due to its high budget.\n\nA few months back, Kamal had said that a sequel to Thevar Magan, directed by ace Bharathan, was on the cards and he would wind up his acting career with these two films. Now, speculation is running high that Kamal would wield the megaphone for Thevar Magan 2. The actor has planned to shoot the film at a stretch at Pollachi (part 1 was set there) and pre-production work has already begun. The source also adds that a young and happening actor will essay a parallel lead while all other cast and crew are being finalised.\n\nAfter Kamal had evinced interest to star in the sequel to Thevar Magan, an infuriated Dr S Krishnaswamy, leader of the Puthiya Thamizhakam party, had been up in arms over the proposed film’s title — Thevar Magan 2. He demanded that the title be changed to Devendirar Magan as Thevar is the name of a caste."
