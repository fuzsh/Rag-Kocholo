        "text": "Hey Ram is a period drama written, directed, and produced by Kamal, which also starred him and Shah Rukh in the lead.\n\nIn the Tamil-Hindi movie, Kamal and Shah Rukh played friends Saket Ram and Amjad Ali Khan, respectively.\n\n\"When we work together, we are all just people. I don't see a superstar. He doesn't see a super director. We are friends. Shah Rukh sahib made that film for free... That cannot be done by a superstar. That can be done only by a fan. A connoisseur of art and a good actor. I'm ever thankful to him. Later on, you give us those titles and we very shyly accept it,\" Kamal told reporters on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I wanted to do it only with Yusuf sahib (Dilip Kumar's real name). When he said I'm not going to do any more films. Then, I sold the rights to somebody because I didn't want to, and I couldn't think of anybody else. And so that was a dream that didn't come through,\" Kamal recalled.\n\n\"I'm a great fan and a student of Yusuf saab. I don't know how many people know because it was a secret fact. I used to come here whenever I could on December 11 on his birthday and kneel before him to kiss his hand,\" he added."
