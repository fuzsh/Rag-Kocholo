        "text": "Kamal Haasan, one of Indian cinema's most celebrated actors, turns 68 today, November 7. The artist par excellence, who began his career as a child actor with Kalathur Kanamma (1960), remains a source of inspiration for many despite the emergence of younger stars. This can be attributed to the fact that he, over the years, has constantly tried to evolve as a performer and a technician by breaking barriers through his work. Here is a look at his journey from a promising newcomer to the film fraternity's undisputed Ulaganayagan.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLEARNING FROM THE BEST\n\nIt is no secret that legendary filmmaker K Balachander served as Kamal Haasan's mentor during his initial years in the Tamil film industry. The maverick filmmaker directed him in Apoorva Raagangal (1975), which is widely regarded as his breakthrough film. The drama, which also marked Rajinikanth's first appearance on the big screen, featured Kamal Haasan in the role of a rebellious youngster who falls in love with an older woman. The actor received praise for his intense yet realistic performance.\n\nKamal Haasan and K Balachander subsequently collaborated on films such as Moondru Moodichu, Avargal, and 16 Vayathinile, which were praised for their commercial yet biting narratives. These films also established Haasan, Rajinikanth, and the late Sridevi as a bankable combination.\n\nBECOMING A PAN-INDIA HERO EVEN BEFORE THE TERM BECAME FAMOUS\n\nThe 80s proved to be a memorable period for Kamal Haasan as it saw him break language barriers and emerge as the original pan-India star. He made his Hindi debut with Ek Duuje Ke Liye, which proved to be a rage among the younger audience. The K Balachander-directed romantic tragedy was a remake of the director's own Telugu film, Maro Charitra, which too starred Kamal Haasan.\n\nPost Ek Duuje Ke Liye, the actor consolidated his standing in Bollywood with films such as Sadma, Saagar, and Geraftaar. He subsequently took a break from Bollywood to concentrate on South films. This period also saw him receive critical acclaim for his work in Telugu films such as Akali Rajyam, Swathi Muthyam, and Indrudu Chandrudu. He also starred alongside Urmila Matondkar in the Malayalam thriller, Chanakyan.\n\nVERSATILITY PERSONIFIED\n\nNammavar has never shied away from experimenting with his reel image. He excelled in intense roles in films such as Oru Kaidhiyin Dairy, Sathya, and Thevar Magan. He played an older character in the iconic Mani Ratnam-directed Nayakan with effortless ease. Haasan was equally brilliant in comedies such as Michael Madana Kamarajan and Avvai Shanmugi, to name a few. The actor also surprised many when he acted in the silent film, Pushpaka Vimana.\n\nFor Kamal Haasan, action is all about realism. He has pulled off realistic fight scenes in films such as Indian, Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, and the 2022 blockbuster Vikram.\n\nKamal Haasan pushed his limits even further when he played a triple role in Apoorva Sagodharargal. While he was equally impressive in all three roles, many consider his portrayal of the vertically challenged Appu to be the hallmark of the film. It was, however, Dasavathaaram that proved to be his most ambitious attempt on this front. It saw him play 10 characters on the big screen.\n\nNOT JUST AN ACTOR, BUT A BRILLIANT TECHNICIAN\n\nKamal Haasan is more than just an actor. The veteran gave strong proof of his abilities as a director when he made his directorial debut with Chachi 420. He also directed the critically-acclaimed Hey Ram and Virumandi, among many. He also served as the director for Vishwaroopam and its sequel.\n\nKamal Haasan also lent his voice to songs like Jago Gori and Oh Ho Sanam. He penned the lyrics for two songs from the Tamil version of Hey Ram. Throughout the years, Kamal Haasan has never shied away from learning new technology and implementing it in his films. Most of his films are technically sound, thanks to his keen interest in giving his 100 per cent to every single project.\n\nadvertisement\n\nApart from his individual talent, Kamal Haasan, along with his trusted aides, floats a production company called Raaj Kamal Films International.\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD IS BRIGHT\n\nKamal Haasan, who suffered a setback when Vishwaroopam 2 failed at the box office, bounced back with Vikram. The actor is set to keep the momentum going with his upcoming films. He is working on Indian 2, a sequel to the 1996 classic of the same name. It is directed by Shankar and features the star in the role of the vigilante Senapathy. On Sunday, November 6, it was announced that he is set to team up with Mani Ratnam for his new film. This will be their first collaboration after Nayakan (1987). A sequel to Vikram, with Haasan as the protagonist and Suriya as the antagonist, too, is reportedly in the works."
