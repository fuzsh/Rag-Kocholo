While he was the lead villain, he only had a few minutes of screen time. As a result, fans are confused about the actor’s role in the upcoming sequel. Recently, Haasan himself teased details about Kalki 2898 AD Part 2 and gave an update on the sequel.\n\nKalki 2898 AD part 2 cast: What did Kamal Haasan say about Yaskin’s role?\n\nAfter playing a powerful role in Kalki 2898 AD, Kamal Haasan is gearing up for Indian 2. During the special press meet in Chennai, Haasan answered a few questions about the Nag Ashwin directorial.\n\nPer Indian Express, he said, “In Kalki, I have played a small role that makes an appearance for a few minutes only. My real part in the film has only begun, and I will have more to do in the second part. So, I watched this film as a fan, and I was astonished.”\n\nThe actor further lauded Nag Ashwin and his work. He said, “Nag Ashwin carefully handled the subject of mythology without any religious bias. Across the world, only Japan, China, and Greek civilizations can come close to the Indian heritage of storytelling. Ashwin has chosen stories from that and has executed it with a lot of patience by bringing everyone together.”\n\nAmitabh Bachchan’s portrayal of Ashwatthama has won many hearts. Lauding the actor’s work in Kalki 2898 AD, Haasan said, “I don’t know if I should call him a veteran or a fresh actor. He has done the film that well.”\n\nThe makers of Kalki 2898 AD have confirmed its sequel by the end of the movie."
