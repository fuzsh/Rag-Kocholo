        "text": "Actor Kamal Haasan and ace director Mani Ratnam have come together after 35 years, after their gangster drama ‘Nayagan’ broke all records in the 1990s. The duo have come together to work in KH 234 titled as Thug Life.\n\nThe makers of the movie have released an awe-inspiring title launch video which shows Kamal Haasan’s character as Rangaraya Sakthivel Nayakan.\n\n“It seems they had written on my forehead at birth that Sakthivel Nayakan was a criminal, a goonda, a Yakuza,” says the hero, covered in a torn and murky white robe.\n\nHe faces a group of henchmen and says, “this is not the first time I am hitting someone, and this is not the last time.”\n\nLater, he takes off his robe and reveals his martial arts attire as he fights with the henchmen who came to attack him.\n\nGiven that Kamal Haasan’s character was Sakthivel Naicker in Nayagan, it remains to be seen if Thug Life will be a sequel to Nayagan. Neither Kamal Haasan nor Mani Ratnam has revealed anything about it yet.\n\nIt remains unknown if and how Thug Life is connected to Nayakan.\n\nWith an ensemble of cast—Dulqer Salman, Trisha Krishnan, Jayam Ravi and others, Mani Ratnam had also roped in Anbariv, the duo who are the stunt sensation in Tamil cinema. Anbariv collaborated with Kamal in his latest Vikram. A.R. Rahman will score music while Sreekar Prasad has been roped in for editing.\n\nProduced by Kamal Haasan, Mani Ratnam, R. Mahendran and Siva Ananth under the banner Raaj Kamal films, Madras Talkies and Red Giant movies, the release of the title comes as a huge treat for the super star’s fans on the eve of his 69th birthday.\n\nCinematographer Ravi K Chandran who worked with Mani Ratnam in Kandathil Muthamittal and Aayutha Ezhuthu will handle the camera.\n\nConsidered to be one of Kamal Haasan’s biggest movies, the film is expected to go on the floors in a month and is now in the pre-production stage."
