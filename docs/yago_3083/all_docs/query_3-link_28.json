        "text": "Kamal Haasan is called Ulaganayagan (world's actor) for a reason. Even at the age of 69, he continues to raise everyone's eyebrows with his film choices. On June 10, the much-awaited trailer of Nag Ashwin's 'Kalki 2898 AD' was unveiled amid massive anticipation. Touted as the most expensive Indian film ever made, the film's trailer had exactly one shot of Kamal Haasan, who plays a cameo in it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd that was it!\n\n'Kalki 2898 AD' trailer introduced Kamal Haasan in a new avatar and fans went berserk. Though his fans, who have followed his filmography over the years, drew comparisons with his look in 'Dasavatharam' (where the actor played 10 roles), his appearance got everyone excited.\n\nHere's the trailer:\n\nBut, why has Kamal Haasan's appearance in 'Kalki 2898' got everyone hyped up?\n\nThe actor, who began his career at the age of five, has seen it all. It's safe to say that there may not be a role that he hasn't played. But, Kamal Haasan's hunger is far from being satisfied. Case in point: His upcoming films.\n\nKamal Haasan is gearing up for the release of director Shankar's 'Indian 2', which will hit the screens on July 12. The film is a sequel to the movie of the same name that was released in 1996. Even in the 1996 film, Kamal Haasan played two roles - young and corrupt Chandru and freedom fighter-turned-vigilante Senapathy. Almost two decades later, Kamal Haasan is back as aged vigilante Senapathy, who fights against corruption.\n\nHere's a promo:\n\n'Indian' was iconic in so many ways and Kamal Haasan's 'Senapathy' was one of them. To relive the same character 20 years later requires guts. They say, 'classics should never be touched'. It could go both ways for Kamal Haasan, but he is willing to take that risk.\n\nAfter having delivered a Rs 400 crore hit film with 'Vikram' in 2022, Kamal Haasan is yet to have a release. However, he has once again chosen to reunite with director Mani Ratnam, after almost 35 years. Together, they're working on 'Thug Life', a film on professional robbers and murderers in India.\n\nThe announcement video of 'Thug Life' was all things mesmerising. Firstly, it brought back the 'Nayakan' combo - Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan - back. Secondly, Kamal Haasan's look and his dialogue delivery took the cake. Thirdly, it was technically sound. In fact, 'Thug Life' became one of the most anticipated films in Tamil cinema, and it was able to create that impact with just an announcement video.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nThough 'Kalki 2898 AD' will feature Kamal Haasan in a cameo, it is still a role that could change the course in the film. He promises the beginning of a 'new era'.\n\nEven after six decades in cinema, Kamal Haasan continues to experiment and push the envelope, not just for himself but for cinema at large."
