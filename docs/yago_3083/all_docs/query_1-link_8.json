        "text": "The veteran Tamil, Hindi actor reveals how he wanted to make [probably Hindi remake] of his 1992 Tamil hit film with the late great Bollywood actor.\n\nBy Our Correspondent\n\nA conversation with a veteran artiste will always throw up interesting stories. Veteran actor Kamal Haasan, who has largely worked in Tamil, Telugu and a few Hindi films, had arrived in Mumbai yesterday [28 May] to promote his next Vikram: Hitlist [2022]. During the press conference, the 67-year-old was asked about his experience of working with super stars Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil, his co-stars from Vikram: Hitlist [2022].\n\nWithout going overboard, Haasan kept it simple saying that working with great actors, the experience is exactly the same and greatness is similar around the world. He did add though that Faasil is a national star who has it in him to become an international star too. Out of nowhere, Haasan revisited the past talking about his 1992 hit Tamil film Thevar Magan [1992] that starred the late great Sivaji Ganesan and him. Haasan had directed and produced that film.\n\nTalking of one actor who Haasan was very keen to work with, the actor-filmmaker revealed,” I literally held his hand and begged him, but he had decided not to act, that was Dilip Kumar saab. I wanted to make Thevar Magan [1992] with him and me. It didn’t happen and so I gave it to another friend who made it with Anil Kapoor and Amrish Puri saab”.\n\nDirector Priyadarshan remade the film in Hindi as Virasat [1997] that starred Anil Kapoor and Amrish Puri. Both films were successful.\n\nWe wonder whether the veteran was talking about remaking the film in Hindi with Dilip Kumar. During this moment, the emcee asked Haasan why is it that Thevar Magan [2022] is not there on any OTT network yet?\n\n“I don’t know whether it is our strategy [laughs]. We are holding onto it. Our CEO Mr. Narayan is here. Let them see your face so that they accuse me next time of Thevar Magan not coming [on OTT], he is also responsible. Hopefully, it will reach you soon,” replied Haasan.\n\nSpeaking of OTT, the filmmaker stressed on how it was difficult to convince producers, distributors of the value of an Over-The-Top platform without the film exhibitors getting worried.\n\n“When I was recommending that OTT should come. I didn’t know how to convince them (producers, distributors, exhibitors). They were worried when satellite TV came. I told them this [OTT] will become another branch of this head office bank called Moving Images. Don’t worry about that,” said the Vikram: Hitlist [2022] actor.\n\nThe trend has now changed especially with the pandemic forcing many producers to release their films straight onto to the digital platforms.\n\n“I couldn’t convince them then. I’m not a great believer [atheist] but I told them in their language. I said what is it in your neck?” said Haasan. He doesn’t specify the person here. Haasan continues, “He said that is Balaji. I told him just because you have a calendar with Balaji’s picture, that doesn’t mean Tirupati will lose its value. Same goes for Ajmer, Mecca, the Vatican. Similarly, cinema, congregation in a theatre will not go away.”"
