        "text": "After a long wait, Nag Ashwin's Kalki 2898 AD is finally out in the theatres. The movie stars some of the biggest stars of Indian cinema such as Amitabh Bachchan, Prabhas, Deepika Padukone and Kamal Haasan. Released on May 27, the movie has garnered a wide range of reactions from critics and audiences alike. Since the release, viewers have questioned Kamal's limited screen time in the movie.\n\nIn the movie inspired by Hindu mythology, Kamal plays the role of antagonist Yaskin. The actor's eerie appearance and prolific villanious performance have earned a lot of appraisal from the audience.\n\nKamal Haasan on His Limited Screen Time\n\nDuring a press meet in Chennai, the veteran star opened up about his role in Nag Ashwin's sci-fi movie as he went on to share the details about his role in the second part.\n\nTalking about his less screen time, Kamal said, as per Indian Express, “In Kalki, I have played a small role that makes an appearance for a few minutes only. My real part in the film has only begun and I will have more to do in the second part. So, I watched this film as a fan and I was astonished.”\n\nKalki 2898 AD Twitter Review: Netizens hail Amitabh Bachchan's age-defying performance\n\nHaasan added, “We have been seeing many signifiers that Indian cinema is moving towards global entertainment, and Kalki 2898 AD is one among them. Nag Ashwin carefully handled the subject of mythology without any religious bias. Across the world, only Japan, China, and Greek civilizations can come close to the Indian heritage of storytelling. Ashwin has chosen stories from that and has executed it with a lot of patience by bringing everyone together.”\n\nAfter the release of Kalki 2898 AD, Haasan is now busy promoting his next movie Indian 2, which will release on July 12.\n\nKamal Haasan Hails Amitabh Bachchan\n\nBachchan's age-defying performance in Kalki has become the talk of the whole internet, with netizens going gaga over his stunts and chilling performance. Praising BigB's work in the movie during the press meet, Haasan said, “I don’t know if I should call him a veteran or a fresh actor. He has done the film that well.“It looks like the film has been made for children. Now, don’t ask how a man with white hair can enjoy such films. This film reminds you of the child that’s within every adult. This is a great attempt and I am happy to be part of it. I am happy that this journey is going to continue.”\n\nKalki 2898 AD Review\n\nWION's film critic Shomini Sen wrote that ''Kalki 2898 AD borrowed plot lines and shoddy screenplay make the film borderline comical and utterly disappointing.''\n\nSen writes, ''Written by Nag Ashwin, the film has taken huge references from Dune, Star Wars, Mad Max: Fury Road, Blade Runner and even Marvel movies. It's a slow first half and an unnecessary subplot involving Disha Patani and Prabhas's forced romance and gallivanting around the complex. Kalki 2898 AD takes its time to establish the plot. The action mostly begins in the second half, when the pace picks up. However, by then the mind-numbing, long action sequences take precedence and the plot stops making sense. At one point on the screen, we see two giant Amitabh Bachchans fighting each other. Then there is a flying Prabhas with his aid, a robotic- AI-driven car/confidante who also turns into a giant robot, sports car, and spaceship at Prabhas' will.'' Read full review here."
