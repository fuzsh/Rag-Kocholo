        "text": "How the list was curated\n\nNaturally, the task of selecting just 70 films is daunting. Kamal Haasan clarifies that he is not a film scholar. âI can only choose from the films I have seen,â says the actor with four National Awards under his belt. âAnd naturally I have not seen every good film.â He says he can only include films that changed his life, as a man, as an actor. âThis is not a bucket list â 70 films you should see before you die. Iâm not trying to recommend movies, or impose my choices on other people. Films are my profession, my life. The way I react to a film will be different from the way other people would. Iâm sure I will probably notice nuances other people may not. Finally, itâs like falling in love! Why do you fall in love with someone? Who knows? Itâs the same with movies.â"
