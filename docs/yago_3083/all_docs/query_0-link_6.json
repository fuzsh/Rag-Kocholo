        "text": "The versatile star of the entertainment industry, Kamal Haasan, who is fondly called ‘Ulganayagan’ by fans, has worked with almost all the stalwarts of Indian cinema. However, his wish to work with late legend Kamal Haasan remained unfulfilled. In fact, the duo almost came together for a film.\n\nKamal Haasan wished to collaborate with Dilip Kumar for the Hindi remake of his successful movie Thevar Magan, where he wanted to reprise his role, while Kumar was requested to step in the shoes of Sivaji Ganesan. But the Madhumati star declined the offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking to Indian Express, Haasan said, âI love acting with actors. Thereâs one actor whom I miss, and I really wanted to work with, he was Dilip Kumar. I really held Dilip Saabâs hand and begged him, but he had decided not to act. I wanted to make Thevar Magan with him and me, but it didnât happen, so I gave it to another friend, and he made it with Anil Kapoor saab and Amrish Puri saab.â\n\nThe film was remade as Virasat, which also featured Tabu, Pooja Batra, Milind Gunaji, and Govind Namdeo alongside Anil Kapoor and Amrish Puri.\n\nOn the professional front, Kamal Haasan will be next seen in Indian 2 , which is the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster Indian. The film also features Kajal Aggarwal, Siddharth, S. J. Suryah, Rakul Preet Singh, Priya Bhavani Shankar, Nedumudi Venu, Vivek, Kalidas Jayaram, Gulshan Grover, Samuthirakani, Bobby Simha, Brahmanandam, Zakir Hussain, Piyush Mishra, Guru Somasundaram, Delhi Ganesh, Jayaprakash, Manobala, Vennela Kishore and Deepa Shankar in key roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBankrolled by Red Giant Movies and Lyca Productions, the music of the film is composed by Anirudh Ravichander. It is set to hit the screens in 2024.\n\nKamal Haasan also has Kalki 2898 AD, Thug Life and H Vinoth’s next under his belt."
