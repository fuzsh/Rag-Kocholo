        "text": "Kamal Haasan (born November 7, 1954 in Paramakudi, Tamil Nadu, India) is an Indian actor, film-maker who works in the Tamil film industry. Haasan has won several Indian film awards including four National Film Awards and 19 Filmfare Awards. With seven submissions, Kamal Haasan has starred in the highest number of films submitted by India for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. Haasan's production company, Rajkamal International, has produced several of his films. Kamal Haasan received the Indian civilian awards of Padma Shri in 1990 and the Padma Bhushan in 2014.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nHere are his earlier letters to me, that I've framed. I call them ‘my degrees’.\n\nThe letters of appreciation he received from K. Balachander, in His Master's voice 1 September 2010\n\n“Propaganda films I am against,” Kamal Haasan said at a presser in Abu Dhabi, adding, “It’s not enough if you just write ‘true story’ at the bottom as a logo. It has to really be true, and that (the film) is not true.”\n\nExclusive| The Kerala Story director Sudipto Sen reacts to Kamal Haasan calling it ‘propaganda’: There are very stupid… 2023 [1]\n\nI receive them only when he thinks I deserve it — I have to work for them!\n\nAbout his letters from Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nI had to read it out to my sister, who was witness to my early dark days, when my mother was afraid what would happen to me. But, I knew I couldn't read without choking up, so I asked Gautami to read it out for me.\n\nAbout the letters from Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nI use the word ‘guru' for him in the mythological sense — all other educationists ask for payment for knowledge imparted; this gentleman paid me and taught me. What a journey it has been, after I met him at the age of 17-and-a-half.\n\nAbout Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nI prepare even for a conversation with him — I never want to say too little or too much. And, I never disturb him except when I feel I've done something worthwhile. It's a rare relationship — unconditional and [professional]].\n\nAbout his relationship with Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010\n\nTo have won a place in his heart among all those he has mentored and created, itself is a distinction.\n\nAbout his relationship with Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nWith this film I have made more money than any of my other films. It was a high-wire act.\n\nOn the success of his innovative Tamil film Apoorva Sahodarakal (Unique brothers) after a series of flops,\n\nIn Comeback king (31May 1989)\n\nWho will speak like that? In our generation there have not been friends like Rajini and I are. He could have just said a few words of praise and gone away – and then there was no need to say.\n\nIn reply to the wholesome praise that Rajnikanth showered on Kamal Haasan, in Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography (15 January 2014), p. 120\n\nGlad my name came up. Thank audience, mentor, all who made my workplace enjoyable.\n\nOn getting the Padma Bhushan Award, the third highest civilian award of India for his five decades in the film industry, in Glad my name came up', Kamal Hassan on Padma Bhushan (26 January 2014)\n\nSubjugation is something which is an impedance on the ascent of man.\n\nIn an interview with Ms. Barkha Dutt #Townhall with Kamal Haasan, about atheism and rationalism.\n\nAamir's choice of films makes Kamal Haasan happy\n\n[edit]\n\nAamir's choice of films makes Kamal Haasan happy (2 January 2012)\n\nI'm proud of her [Shruti] because she isn't doing a product of our home banner Rajkamal Films. The only thing Rajkamal did for her was to give her a chance to do the background score in ‘Unnaipol Oruvan’. It wouldn't matter to me if she failed as a movie actress. But right now it looks like a winning streak.\n\nAbout his daughter Shruti Haasan\n\nWhen we talk career, we get into an argument. In Hindi films, she is facing the same problems I did. If a K. Balachander hadn't come along to do 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye' with me in Hindi, I wonder what would've happened to me! I would have suffered much worse because Shruti is far more savvy than me.\n\n...for the [[Tamil language|Tamil version of ‘Dasavatharam’, she was my coach for my American accent. She had just returned from the US and was the perfect medium to help her father's Madrasi accent to be transformed into a yankee accent. She was a bully. She made me do many retakes in the dubbing. And after dubbing, she wanted me to correct some more of my accent. Everyone thought that was taking it a little too far.\n\nAbout his second daughter Akshara\n\nI was always a reluctant actor! I continue to be that. I announce a project, the camera rolls and I'm happy. I'm fortunate to be doing leading parts even now. Except for my mentor K. Balachander, for whom I can do even a walk-on part. When he directed his 100th film, I just walked in to do a small role. I just clowned around on camera.\n\nBalachander is my inspiration. He had a heart problem 40 years back. He has been making films for another 46 years. He can never grow old. My father used to be like that until he suffered a stroke. Then I suddenly realized he was an old man.That's also true of my brothers Chandra Haasan and to an extent Charu Haasan.I can never imagine them being old.\n\nDirection is a lot of responsibility. But if you've been trained under Balachander as I have, it's a lot easier. You have everything down on paper before you start shooting. By now while directing I am experienced enough to know my moves.\n\nHe is a cool cat. I was surprised when he had a heart problem...People think my film with Mani, ‘Nayakan’, is my best work. To an extent it's true. But I'd like to think my best is yet to come.\n\nAbout Mani Ratnam, his son-in-law\n\nKamal Hassan: A universal legend\n\n[edit]\n\nDhanusha Gokulan in Kamal Hassan: A universal legend 24 November 2013\n\nI am awestruck and I am happy to see that the book fair happens. I’ve learnt everything I know on the go, like my mother tongue.\n\nI have great respect for the unconditional teachers called books. Because from a book, you can either learn, or you can’t.\n\nSomeone once asked me what my working timetable was like and when was the last time I went on a holiday. I said about 20 years back. I don’t work anymore, because I get paid to do what I like most. So it’s like a paid holiday.\n\nActors can be refined and be better. I’m an improved version of whatever you’ve seen earlier. I do not say this with arrogance, but it is my duty to be better than my predecessor and it’s my duty to see that my successor is better than me.\n\nFor two and a half years, I rigorously trained seven to eight hours a day in two disciplines of dance but moved on to the most versatile medium called cinema which encompassed every form of art.\n\nI am looking for excellence. Anyone can struggle but they cannot make a ‘perfect’ film.\n\nIt is an award for American excellence that excludes and sometimes gracefully includes some other countries. It is an institution or brand created by Hollywood to promote itself, an award decided by 15 people. How nice it would have been if Satyajit Ray, instead of all his awards, got a few more audiences?\n\nOn Oscar Awards that they are not the epitome of the cinematic world.\n\nIt is wrong to celebrate 100 years of cinema with just India. It is 100 years of cinema for Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka. All these places saw Indian cinema as it was produced in Lahore, Mumbai, Chennai — it went all the way. It is 100 years of cinema of what used to be my India, my Pakistan, my Afghanistan and my Sri Lanka. That’s how an artist looks at it and it’ll soon be my world. It is the governments and political interests that create borders.\n\nAbout celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema.\n\nPolitical Views\n\n[edit]\n\nSpeaking at the India Today Conclave 2018.\n\n\"Mediocrity is set as a standard...rubbish becomes acceptable. This has been the state of Tamil politics for nearly half a century\"\n\nOn the state of politics in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\"I am anti everything that goes wrong for the people. As for extremism, Hindu extremism exists, read the Tamil papers.\n\nAddressing the recent vandalism of Periyar's statue in Vellore.\n\n\"Many don't get the idea of centrism...we do not have to be left or right\"\n\nOn his political stance.\n\nAbout Kamal Haasan\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom babyhood to childhood, from adolescence to youth, from manhood to middle age, I have been part of this magician's life... Kamal has evolved into everything that I have dreamed he would be. Indeed, I should never be surprised by anything he achieves, yet I am constantly amazed.\n\nK Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nYes, I own Kamal. Yet, he does not belong to me — he belongs to the world of cinema. It is often argued that had he been born abroad, he would have won the Oscar many times over.\n\nK Balachander, in K Balachander praises Kamal Hassan! (2 September 2010)\n\nA few Oscars maybe. But what value are a few Oscars in front of the adulation and warmth of a billion smiles and the awe and respect of a billion salutes? I have never ceased to be amazed by the limits and standards he sets (for) himself — standards that nobody else imagines even exists!\n\nK Balachander, in “K Balachander praises Kamal Hassan! (2 September 2010)”\n\nI did not teach him everything he knows. He just absorbed everything I knew. The rest he discovered himself by asking, probing, begging, watching, observing, reading, demanding, investigating, improvising, experimenting, experiencing, learning and not being afraid of stretching himself beyond his own limits. I only gave him the platform and the opportunity to discover himself. In the process, I was blessed enough to discover myself.\n\nK Balachander, in “His Master's voice 1 September 2010”\n\nHe is a legend in every sense of the term. He is a writer, singer, director, lyricist and an actor par-excellence. We are extremely honoured to present the Lifetime Achievement Award to Kamal Haasan.\n\nShyam Benegal, after Kamala hasan was selected for the honour of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th Mumbai Film Festival for 50 years in the Indian film industry, in Kamal Haasan to be Bestowed with Lifetime Achievement Award (15 September 2013)\n\nI walk down the road and people want to kiss me. I'd never do all that to anyone. Not Bachchan or Rajinikanth. The exception is Kamal. I asked him if I could touch him when I first met him,\n\nShahrukh Khan, in A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)\n\nHe has an amazing sense of using space. When he plays an old man his gait and the way he stands is enough to convey his age. He doesn't need make-up. I find him greater than Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro put together, I know Kamal can make you cry with a look in his eyes. I know his pauses. He has an amazing sense of timing that he knows the audience likes. He's a technician par excellence. That kind of knowledge and control every actor should strive to get.\n\nShahrukh Khan, in “A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)”\n\nIt's Kamal who inspired me to do one film at a time.\n\nAamir Khan in “A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)”\n\nThere are some things he can do that others can but there are many things Kamal can do that no other actor can.\n\nAamir Khan, in “A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)”\n\nHe has famously said that he is a reluctant actor. He has an avid interest in every aspect of filmmaking and is known for his work as a choreographer, director, and writer, as well.\n\nMaiam Magazine, in Kamal Hassan Biography\n\nI'm always a Kamal Hassan fan...From day one I was very clear that I was not going to tap his immense talent. I've seen it all and he's done it all. I didn't want him to look different like he is in some of his films. I wanted to make a simple film, which will work for a change. I didn't want him to go overboard with anything. He's a good-looking guy in real life and that's the way I wanted him to look. We wanted somebody very sober and quiet so the histrionics were underplayed.\n\nGautam Menon, in “A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)” about the Kaakha Kaakha film with kamal hasan in the lead role.\n\nDefinitely from the actors I've worked with and the actors I've watched. I was amazed by the distinct way he handles a scene I've written. It was something I wouldn't have thought of. His way of looking at a scene would be different from what was on paper. He's an institution as far as acting is concerned. For example when I took a scene to him he did something that was not on paper, something you don't expect and can't write.\n\nGautam Menon, in “A dream come true for him (25 August 2006)” about the Kaakha Kaakha film with Kamal hasan in the lead role.\n\nIn every theater the collections are going up. Only Kamal can do this sort of a role and the film is a turning point for him. Saravanan also rightly advised Kamal not to sell the film - which cost Kamal Rs.80 lakhs to produce - outright, but only on a commission basis, as he felt it would be a \"perennial gold-mine\".\n\nRamesh Menon, on Kamal Hassnan’s success of the innovative Tamil film Apoorva Sahodarakal (Unique brothers) after a series of flops, in “Comeback king (31May 1989)”\n\nNobody associated with Sahodarakal is really willing to disclose what camera wizardry it was that finally transformed Kamalahasan into a fascinating midget. Some of the dwarf scenes were shot in a circus playing in Cochin by digging a pit with the actor standing knee-deep in it. The shoes were fixed to his knee and the pit was covered with a carpet.\n\nRamesh Menon, in “Comeback king (31May 1989)”\n\nI have not seen an actor who would play the most ludicrous roles without bothering about his star image.\n\nPratap Pothen, in “Comeback king (31May 1989)”\n\nWhat can we say about Kamal Haasan that has not already been said? This man was born to be an actor. Winning a national award for his first performance as a four year old, he has carved out a niche for himself in the [[w:Film industry|industry like no other actor could. Although his acting has been celebrated over the years, his style has not been given due credit. Kamal’s look not only changed as he grew as an actor but was strategically chalked out to suit each of his characters. From his haircut, to beard, mustache, his wardrobe, he was one of those pioneering actors in India to extremely to use prosthetics for different looks. One could say he was addicted to [[w:Experimenting|experimenting with his looks and characters. Go over his career and you will be amazed with exactly how much Kamal’s style has evolved over the past half century.\n\nMaya Raj, in Southscope July 2010 - Side A\n\nHe is truly a master of all the arts. But everything has a reason and I decided to find out why. There is a bit of arts in every one and the goddess of the arts of the arts endows some people with extra gifts and leads them by the hand. People like me, Mammootty, Mohan Lal, Venkatesh and Amitabh Bachchan are amongst those whom the goddess has chosen to lead by the hand. But the goddess has picked up Kamal and cradled in her arms and clasped her to her bosom. I asked her “Is this fair” You are holding Kamal close to you. But all of us are also your children, we should be equal in your eyes.” The goddess replied, “Rajini, you wanted to be an actor and struggled to become one from your last life; but Kamal has desired to be an actor for ten lifetimes. Can I put him down?” I told her, no, goddess, let him stay where he is.” Kamal is truly the favorite child of the goddess of arts. I am proud that my name will also go down in history as somebody who has acted with him.\n\nRajinikanth, in fulsome of Kamal Haasan, in Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography (15 January 2014), p. 120\n\nOnly an actor of Kamal's calibre can play a Dwarf effectively.\n\nSingetham Srinivas Rao, in “Comeback king (31May 1989)”\n\nI know Kamalahasan rather well personally, but I haven't seen his films. I think he's very talented. I like to talk to him because he's intelligent.\n\nSatyajit Ray, in 'I can hope for nothing more' (25 June 2013)\n\nThe range and versatility of Kamalahasan is unbelievable. He is one of our best actors.\n\nRamesh Sippy, in “Comeback king (31May 1989)”\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nKamal Haasan on IMDb"
