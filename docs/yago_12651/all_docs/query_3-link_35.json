        "text": "Though it has been some time since Eddie Alderson last tackled a film or television role, the actor will always be beloved for his time on One Life to Live as a child actor — but he’s not a child anymore, and there is much to celebrate.\n\nHappy Birthday, Eddie Alderson!\n\nAnd that’s because he was born on October 28, 1994, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which means that this handsome performer is turning 29 years old today! Alderson was a mere child of 7 when he began his acting career on the Manhattan-based serial OLTL.\n\nBetween May 10, 2001, and 2012, he played Matthew Buchanan, the son of supercouple Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) and Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan (Hillary B. Smith). Alderson’s time on the soap coincided with his sister’s tenure as Starr Manning. For his effort, Alderson was nominated for two Young Artist Awards (2009), as well as a Daytime Emmy (2012).\n\nAside from OLTL, Eddie Alderson’s acting credits include a guest sting on a 2009 episode of Law & Order (ex-Todd; “Pledge”). He made his film debut in the 2007 picture Reservation Road (playing the role of Lucas Arno), which starred Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo.\n\nAlderson’s resume also includes the Clint Eastwood-directed feature Changeling (2008), starring Angelina Jolie, as well as the scripted podcast Powder Burns which featured John Wesley Shipp — an alum of Guiding Light (ex-Kelly Nelson), As the World Turns (ex-Douglas Cummings) and One Life to Live (ex-Eddie Ford) — as well as Ed Asner and Robert Vaughan.\n\nIn 2016, Alderson was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, which necessitated multiple rounds of chemotherapy, causing the actor to go through way more than someone his age should have to deal with. Alderson’s progress with his illness was well documented via social media, as fans cheered him on. In 2019, amidst much fanfare, he was declared cancer-free. Soap Hub would like to wish Eddie Alderson a very happy birthday and many more!"
