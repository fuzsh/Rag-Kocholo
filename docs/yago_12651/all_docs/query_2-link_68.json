        "meta_description": "b Chapter Twelve  January 4  1948  Buchanan Ranch  b     Chet stealthily crept the well-worn path through the bushes on the west wing of the ranch house. He glanced around furtively. He knew he shouldn t be here...slinking around the house in the dark...but he had to see if she was there tonight...if she had returned. He hadn t seen her for days...nearly a week.    He didn t recall when this habit had started...this habit of creeping around the west wing in the dark...but he came fairly often now. He would crawl behind the bushes and peer through the sheer curtains at the window just to get a glimpse of her. Some nights when he came to this window to see her  he would see him too...in her room...kissing her...touching her...the way he used to touch her. It was all he could do on nights like that not to break the glass and take her...take her where no one would ever find her...where they could be happy again...they were happy once  he and Ellie     Chet s thoughts were interrupted when he heard a soft rustling sound in the bushes. Startled  he turned toward the sound. Suddenly  a firm hand grabbed his shirt front and shoved him against the wall of the ranch house.      Just what do you think you re doing?!  a voice hissed in the dark.                        b January 4 1948  Hanen Home  Chicago  b       Bo rolled over and draped his arm across Nora s side of the bed. Finding it empty  he glanced around the room. In the pale light of the moon  he could see her propped against her pillow in the window seat. He tucked his pillow under his arm and padded silently across the room.     May I join you?  he whispered.    Startled  she glanced up.  Did I wake you?  she asked quietly.     No. I reached for you and you weren t there   Bo replied.  Saw you sitting here and thought I d join you. Scootch over.      You should be sleeping   she admonished.  We have a long trip tomorrow.      And now we have two drivers   he said nudging her over.  When I get tired  I ll give you the wheel. Make room.     She obliged and Bo plumped his pillow up comfortably behind him.      Pretty  isn t it?  she asked referring to the moonlight sparkling on the snow outside the window.  Bet you ve never seen anything like that in Texas.      No  I haven t. It  i is  i  a beautiful night.     They sat quietly for awhile before he continued.      Texas boasts a lot of beauty  but Chicago has it beat for snowy nights... and beautiful women   he added leaning his head against hers.    She smiled slightly and gave him a tender kiss.  Flatterer   she whispered.     Not flattery...truth   he said looking into her eyes.    She kissed him again and snuggled her hand into his  then cast her eyes back out the window.     So...why are you awake at two-thirty in the morning?  Bo asked.  I m sure you didn t get up to admire the view.       No   she admitted in a faraway voice   I was just...thinking.      About ?  he encouraged.     When she didn t respond  he said   Come on  Red. Talk to me. I know something is on your mind...it has been for quite awhile. We always talk things over. Why aren t you sharing with me?     She looked his way.  Well...I ve just needed some time to think some  things through...but  you re right. I want to talk with you about it.   She moved to sit indian-style in front of him still holding his hand in hers.     Before I begin  I want you to know that...I love being Mrs. Bo Buchanan...and I love being Lilli s mom.     Bo looked at her quizzically wondering where this was going. He waited silently for her to continue. She held his hand between hers as she began.     Before we were married  you know I was working two jobs...and while I still lived here with my parents  I was...fairly independent. Then  when you went to the front  I worked two jobs again...took care of our home and our bills...and...I was still pretty independent  but...these past few months I ve just felt   She hesitated.     Unhappy?  he ventured.     No...not unhappy. I guess  discontent  would be the word I d use.      I thought that was because you ve been wanting another baby.      So did I  but   she shrugged.  ...I really think it s more than that  Bo. Learning to drive was a real boost for me. And I ve seen what other women are accomplishing. Look at Rita. She s mother of two now and has always helped run that business. And Lena...did you know she took secretarial courses? She isn t working now  but has the option whenever she s ready       So...are you saying you want to work again? Is that it?      Not right now  no. Right now I want to be there for Lilli. But...someday... yes.      Any idea what you would want to do?  Bo asked.     Yes   She looked into his eyes   but I want you to hear me out before you say anything  okay?     He looked at her expectantly.     I would like to study law   she said quietly.    He didn t say anything...just continued looking at her.     It fascinates me...and more women are going to law school now       When he didn t say anything  she mistook it as doubt or disapproval.      I can do this  Bo...I really want to do this!  She looked at him expectantly  wondering what he was thinking. Finally  she said quietly   So...tell me what you think.     A slow smile spread across Bo s face before he said   I  i know  i  you can do this. There s no doubt in my mind that you can do anything you set your mind to. You re as tenacious as our daughter I guess that s where she gets it...      I m  i not  i !  she interrupted.     No?  Bo raised his brows.  Who was it that pushed me to get married before the war? Who was that?      I didn t  push  you   she began.    Bo laughed.  To all of my arguments about getting married before my tour of duty  you said   Just ask me...just ask me   You were so persistent! So  I asked you.     She straddled his lap and cuddled close.  That s not the only reason you asked me   she said softly.    He went on   And who was it that said   I m going to marry Bo with or without your blessing  Daddy...?  Who was that?      Well   she began...    Bo continued on   And who was it that told me to  stop this truck and teach me to drive ? And who      Nora put a finger to his lips.  Okay  okay...I see your point! She gets her tenacity from me  but...aren t you glad that I was persistent?  she asked kissing him gently.     Yes  I am. You were right about all of those things...I m glad we got married before the war  glad you faced Daddy s wrath to marry me  glad that you always have the desire and enthusiasm to try new things. I love the woman that you are  Red.  He slowed down and pulled her closer.  I love you. You have always supported me in any choice that I have made. Now  I want to support you. If you want to go to school  I am behind you all the way.      Really?  She beamed and threw her arms around his neck.  Oh  thank you  thank you! I love you  Bo Buchanan!  she said kissing him over and over again.    He held her tight.  I love you too   Bo replied slowing her down to a lingering kiss.    Moments later  he pulled back.  Okay  okay...we still have some things to talk about       Are you sure you wanna talk?  she asked seductively  nibbling his neck.     Yes...for a little bit...I have more to say and some questions...     She sat up and looked at him.      First I want to say that I m behind you all the way in this endeavor  but I have one request. I don t really believe I need to say it  but I will anyway...just to cover all the bases.      Okay       When you pursue this goal  you re going to be very busy       I love being busy       I know you do. I just want to say that Lilli is still young and she needs you       And you don t?  she asked.     You know I do. But she s little...no matter how busy you get  Lilli comes first. I can handle it if I get pushed aside a little  but Lilli can t. Remember  I grew up in a home without my mom.  Maggie was a great substitute  but I don t want that for Lilli.      I don t either  Bo. You and Lilli...and whatever family we have...family comes first.      That leads me to my next question. Does this mean that you ve given up on our dream of another child?     Nora shook her head.  No  I haven t given up  Bo. I just have felt like that dream was occupying so much of my thoughts. I can t sit around and wait for that to happen. Rita and I talked about this very thing this past week. She knows how I feel. She and Sal tried to have babies and never could. So...she decided not to sit around waiting for that dream to happen. She jumped into the business with Sal. Then the war took Sal and left her with the business  and it seemed to her like the end of another dream. But she pressed on to keep the business running. Then Vinnie came along to help with the business and brought with him that dream of love and family again. Her advice to me was to not put my life on hold waiting for another child  but to pursue other dreams as I wait. I think that s wise advice  don t you?      Yes  I do. Rita is a wise woman.      So   Nora continued running a hand across his chest   if I do get pregnant  I will put the college dream on hold for awhile...I won t give it up  but I can always pursue it later.     Bo smiled.  Mmmm...not only are you tenacious but beautiful and smart as well       Mmmm  there s that flattery again   she murmured against his neck. She began pursuing him again  but he drew back.     Honey  I have something else to tell you about       Really  Bo...can it wait?     He took a deep breath.  No. It s too exciting. I have to share it. The timing of this is just...amazing. You won t believe it  Red.     She laughed as she sat up again.  Well...it must be good if you re turning down sex       Not turning it down...hell  no...  he said   Just...I have to tell you this one other thing first...it s big.      Okay   she said grinning at him.  What is it?      You know how Asa has been wanting me to help Clint with the business in Llanview? He s asked me several times. I m thinking maybe now is the time I should accept.      Are you serious?...     He stopped her.  Just let me finish   he said.  It s a nice city...not as large as Chicago  but growing...some beautiful houses...hospital...good schools...and...a university. Llanview University...I passed it several times. Founded in the 1870 s  so it s been established awhile...would be a great place for you to get your undergraduate studies done if we lived in Llanview. What do you think?     Nora was stunned.  But  you love the ranch   she began.     But  I love you more.     She smiled through tear-filled eyes.      So...what do you think  Red? You ready to move to Llanview with me?  he questioned.     You know I d go anywhere with you...I love you...so much   she said kissing him again.     You do  huh? You love me?     She nodded  her head against his neck.     Then I have just one other question for you      She sighed.     Who s JC?     She sat up again.  Whaaat?  she asked  confused.     JC? It s right here...etched in the window frame.  JC Loves NH . So  who s JC?  he asked  puzzled.     Oh! James Casey!  Nora said with enthusiasm.  I told you about him. He was my first love...remember?      Yeah  now I remember   Bo nodded.  So...he was your  i first  i  love and his initials live in infamy on your window frame. But  I m your  i last  i  love  and I don t see my initials etched anywhere   he said scanning the wood.     No...you won t find your initials there   she replied softly.    He looked at her as she laid a hand along his cheek.     You won t find your initials there because... i your  i  initials...are etched on my heart   she murmured tenderly.     That works for me   he whispered.     So  Mr. Buchanan  are you finished asking questions?  she asked playing with his earlobe.  Because  if so...I have other plans for you   she said enticingly.    Bo smiled.  I m all yours  Mrs. Buchanan   he replied  drawing her into his arms.",

What do you think?\n\nNora was stunned. But, you love the ranch  she began.\n\nBut, I love you more.\n\nShe smiled through tear-filled eyes.\n\nSo...what do you think, Red? You ready to move to Llanview with me? he questioned.\n\nYou know Id go anywhere with you...I love you...so much, she said kissing him again.\n\nYou do, huh? You love me?\n\nShe nodded, her head against his neck.\n\nThen I have just one other question for you \n\nShe sighed.\n\nWhos JC?\n\nShe sat up again. Whaaat? she asked, confused.\n\nJC? Its right here...etched in the window frame. JC Loves NH. So, whos JC? he asked, puzzled.\n\nOh! James Casey! Nora said with enthusiasm. I told you about him. He was my first love...remember?\n\nYeah, now I remember, Bo nodded. So...he was your first love and his initials live in infamy on your window frame. But, Im your last love, and I dont see my initials etched anywhere  he said scanning the wood.\n\nNo...you wont find your initials there, she replied softly.\n\nHe looked at her as she laid a hand along his cheek.\n\nYou wont find your initials there because...your initials...are etched on my heart, she murmured tenderly.\n\nThat works for me, he whispered.\n\nSo, Mr. Buchanan, are you finished asking questions? she asked playing with his earlobe. Because, if so...I have other plans for you, she said enticingly.\n\nBo smiled. Im all yours, Mrs. Buchanan, he replied, drawing her into his arms."
