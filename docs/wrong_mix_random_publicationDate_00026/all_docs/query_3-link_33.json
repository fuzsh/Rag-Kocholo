        "text": "What I will be remembered for are the Foundation trilogy and the Three Laws of Robotics. What I want to be remembered for is no one book, or no dozen books. Any single thing I have written can be paralleled or even surpassed by something someone else has done. However, my total corpus for quantity, quality and variety can be duplicated by no one else. That is what I want to be remembered for.\n\nâ€“Isaac Asimov\n\nAbout the Author[]\n\nOther Names: Paul French\n\nGenres: Science Fiction, Fantasy\n\nWriting Style:\n\nBooks: Isaac Asimov Books\n\nBiography[]\n\nDr. Isaac Asimov was a Russian-born American Jewish author and biochemist, a highly successful and exceptionally prolific writer best known for his works of science fiction and for his many non-fiction books, including several genres: popular science writings, guides to the bible and science, mystery novels, literature commentary (his works on Shakespeare) and history.\n\nAsimov was by general consensus a master of the science-fiction genre and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, was considered to be one of the \"Big Three\" science-fiction writers during his lifetime. His most famous novels are those based in the Foundation Universe including the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series.\n\nAsimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 9,000 letters and postcards. His works have been published in nine of the ten major categories of the Dewey Decimal System (all except the 100s, Philosophy)\n\nHe was born in Petrovichi, Russia, but his family migrated to the USA when he was three years old. He graduated from Columbia University in 1939 and took a Ph.D. in chemistry there in 1948. In between, he spent three years during World War II working at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station. After the war ended, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving for just under nine months before receiving a honorable discharge.[1]\n\nSeries[]\n\nFoundation series[]\n\nGenre: Classic Science Fiction, Hard Science Fiction\n\nTheme:\n\nRobot series[]\n\nGenre: Classic Science Fiction, Hard Science Fiction\n\nTheme:\n\nGalactic Empire series[]\n\nGenre: Classic Science Fiction, Hard Science Fiction\n\nTheme:\n\nLucky Starr series[]\n\nOriginally published as Paul French\n\nGenre: Children's Science Fiction\n\nTheme:\n\nOther Works[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nChild of Time (1993) (with Robert Silverberg) based on the short story The Ugly Little Boy\n\nShort Story Collections[]\n\nI, Robot (The Robot Series) (1950),\n\nThe Martian Way and Other Stories (1955)\n\nThe Ugly Little Boy (with Robert Silverberg) it first appeared in the September 1958 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction under the title \"Lastborn\", and was reprinted under its current title in the 1959 collection Nine Tomorrows.[2]\n\nCollections[]\n\nThe Martian Way (1955)\n\nEarth Is Room Enough (1957)\n\nNine Tomorrows (1959)\n\nThrough a Glass, Clearly (1967)\n\nAsimov's Mysteries (1968)\n\nNightfall and Other Stories (1969)\n\nThe Best New Thing (1971)\n\nNightfall Two (1971)\n\nThe Early Asimov Volume 1 (1972) aka Eleven Years of Trying\n\nThe Best of Isaac Asimov (1973)\n\nHave You Seen These?
