However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such “in-the-wild” data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT’s use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nOne of the central goals of autonomous robotics research is to enable independent and broadly capable robotic agents: systems that can be tasked with some high-level goals (“keep the kitchen clean”), formulate plans for addressing these goals, and then carry out those plans with the skills and resources available to them. While current robotic learning methods offer appealing solutions for acquiring individual robotic skills, and large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs) and large multimodal models offer the ability to reason over such abstract tasks (Ahn et al., 2022; Rana et al., 2023), truly open-ended tasks still present major challenges. Performing innumerable number of tasks in diverse settings requires a grounded and generalist agent that can robustly adapt to scenarios outside where robots are trained. The bottleneck for achieving these goals, however, is the need for large amounts of robotic experience in the real world – much larger than robot datasets collected in lab settings with well-defined environments.\n\nIn this paper, we study how we can design agents to gather robotic experience for themselves at scale. Central to our work is leveraging knowledge contained in foundation models to drive real-world robots. We specifically focus on diverse robotic data acquisition: when a robot is placed in a new environment, potentially with a user command to collect data around some theme (e.g. office tasks), the robot should determine which tasks can be performed, which of its own skills to trigger to attempt them, and when it should rely on human teleoperators. We view this from the perspective of controlling a fleet of robots, spread across multiple locations, where there are many more robots than human supervisors, necessitating mixing expert demonstrations with suboptimal autonomous policies in a safe and appropriate way. Our system for large-scale orchestration of robotic agents, which we call AutoRT, tackles this problem.\n\nAt the core of AutoRT is an large foundation model that acts as a robot orchestrator, prescribing appropriate tasks to one or more robots in an environment based on the user’s prompt and environmental affordances (“task proposals”) discovered from visual observations. The scene description step perceive objects in the environment, the task proposal step suggests possible things the robot could do with them, and then the affordance filtering step decides which tasks to attempt and how based on these observations and prompt. This process takes into account constraints specified via “constitutional prompting”, where rules about robot behaviour can be defined by the user. It additionally accounts for the availability of human teleoperators, and handles working around the capabilities of the robot (e.g., the robot can pick up a cup but not a table, it can approach the sink but can’t sit in a chair, etc.).\n\nWe describe the AutoRT system, instantiate it with a fleet of real-world mobile manipulators, and present the results of an extensive real-world evaluation over 7 months, 4 different office buildings, and a fleet of over 20 robots, which resulted in the collection of 77,000 real-world robotic trials with both teleoperation and autonomous execution. AutoRT is, to the best of our knowledge, the first system where LLM-controlled robots are allowed to drive autonomously in real world settings, propose their own goals, and take actions toward those goals. We show that AutoRT scales robot deployment by allowing 1 human to supervise 3-5 mobile manipulators. Our evaluation studies how AutoRT can collect highly diverse data, be instructed to collect task appropriate data and shows such data can be used to improve state-of-the-art robot learning models. AutoRT also introduces aligning robot behavior to human preferences using prompting and critiquing with a robot constitution.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nReal robot data collection. Large scale real robot data collection for robotic manipulation falls into mainly two categories: autonomous data collection and human assisted demonstrations. Autonomous data collection in prior works is often conducted in constrained robot lab environments, on tasks like grasping (Pinto & Gupta, 2015; Levine et al., 2016; Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Platt, 2022), pushing (Yu et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2018; Dasari et al., 2020), or pick and place (Kalashnikov et al., 2021; Bousmalis et al., 2023). Our work focuses on tackling more varied environments, similar to Gupta et al. (2018), and tackling a wider set of tasks. Human demonstrated data collection can be done in varied environments (Sharma et al., 2018; Mandlekar et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2021; Brohan et al., 2022), and teleoperated data can be far more diverse and valuable for skill learning than autonomously collected data, but is bottlenecked by availability of humans when scaling to many robots. This motivates hybrid approaches that mix teleoperation and autonomous policies, such as DAgger style methods (Ross et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2019; Hoque et al., 2022). AutoRT is such a hybrid approach, collecting both teleoperated and autonomous episodes based on supply of human supervision, with a focus on collecting data on novel tasks in novel environments.\n\nLarge language models. Many recent works have studied using LLMs to generate agent-like behavior (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023), improve embodied reasoning (Driess et al., 2023), and write robotics code (Vemprala et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022). Works like Ahn et al. (2022) and Rana et al. (2023) use LLMs to generate language plans for robots to solve an instruction given by a user. Our work self-generates instructions for the robot to perform, which was proposed in Xian et al. (2023). Most similar is Voyager (Wang et al., 2023), an LLM-driven agent that autonomously explores a Minecraft environment. AutoRT runs on a real-world robot for extended periods of time, introducing challenges like reliability and safety that are less present in simulated environments.\n\n3 Problem Statement\n\nIn this work, our goal is to build a system that enables large-scale, “in-the-wild” data collection to generate diverse, real-world robot data on new skills in new environments.\n\nTo do so, we assume access to a large fleet of N𝑁Nitalic_N robots, capable of navigating across multiple buildings, and manipulating objects. The buildings are populated, where both robots and people are free to move around the space. We do not make any assumptions about the layout of the buildings, or the objects available for manipulation. We assume a limited bandwidth of human supervision, meaning there are more robots than human supervisors – that is, we cannot expect that a human will always be in charge of teleoperating a single robot.\n\nOur goal is to have a single system that can handle any state s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in Sitalic_s ∈ italic_S observed by a robot, and generate tasks t𝑡titalic_t executable by one of k𝑘kitalic_k different collect policies π∈{π1,…,πk}=Π𝜋superscript𝜋1…superscript𝜋𝑘Π\\pi\\in\\{\\pi^{1},\\dots,\\pi^{k}\\}=\\Piitalic_π ∈ { italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , … , italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT } = roman_Π. For instance, πisubscript𝜋𝑖\\pi_{i}italic_π start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be an autonomous policy πiautosuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝑖auto\\pi_{i}^{\\text{auto}}italic_π start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT auto end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT either hand-designed or learned a priori, or a policy executed by querying a human teleoperator, i.e., πiteleopsuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝑖teleop\\pi_{i}^{\\text{teleop}}italic_π start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT teleop end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. The goal of such a system: S→Π→𝑆ΠS\\rightarrow\\Piitalic_S → roman_Π is to guide the data collection of the fleet of N𝑁Nitalic_N robots by observing the state s𝑠sitalic_s and use this information to identify a set of feasible language-specified tasks t𝑡titalic_t that correspond to specific policies π𝜋\\piitalic_π. In addition, the system needs to take into account other factors that impact throughput of data collection and safety. These include tradeoffs between autonomous and teleoperated policy primitives, generation of diverse and novel tasks proposals while at the same time considering guardrails and safety criteria.\n\n4 AutoRT: Exploring and Executing in the Wild\n\nIn this section, we describe each component of AutoRT, which is visualized in Fig. 5. At a high level, AutoRT gathers data via an open vocabulary object detector to first understand and describe the scene, then an LLM parses this description and generates sensible and safe language goals given high-level objectives, and finally an LLM is used to determine how to execute these goals.\n\nThe robot platform used in AutoRT is a mobile manipulator with a camera, robot arm, and mobile base. Herein, we only consider manipulation data collection, so navigation is only used to gather diverse manipulation settings – however, we note that the system is general to other robotic embodiments and modes of collection. Further details on the robot platform and the implementation are in Appendix A.\n\n4.1 Exploration: Navigating to the Target\n\nThe first stage of AutoRT is to explore the space and find interesting scenes for manipulation. To map the environment, we use the natural language map approach proposed by Chen et al. (2023), which is built using a VLM to encode object detections into visual-language embeddings ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i}italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, with corresponding position (xi,yi,zi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) determined by the robot’s depth sensor and SLAM. Thus, given a textual target q𝑞qitalic_q like “sponge”, we can direct the robot towards a sponge by querying for a ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i}italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that is close to the text embedding for q𝑞qitalic_q. To determine navigation goals we sample this map for regions of interest via sampling states proportional to their latent distance to an average embedding of previously seen objects (see Appendix B for more details). For each environment, this map is generated once, then copied to all robots collecting in the space and loaded from cache to save time in future episodes.\n\n4.2 Robot Constitution\n\nKey to safe robot operation is breaking down high level objectives relevant to humans into tasks a robot may perform. We specify this to robots using what we call a Robot Constitution, a list of rules an LLM is instructed to follow, inspired by methods like Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022). These rules are divided into three categories:\n\n•\n\nFoundational rules inspired by Asimov’s three laws (Asimov, 1942) that govern robotics in general and govern interactions with humans. We modify the exact text of these laws as described in Appendix D.\n\n•\n\nSafety rules describing what tasks are considered unsafe or undesired based on current capabilities in deployment. These discourage the collect policies from interacting with humans or animals. They also discourage handling sharp and fragile objects or electrical equipment.\n\n•\n\nEmbodiment rules describing limitations of the robot’s embodiment, such as its maximum payload and its unimanual nature, to discourage attempting tasks with heavier objects or that which require two arms (e.g. “opening a fridge and picking up a drink”).\n\nA fourth category, the guidance rules, provides an input for an optional high-level human command: “The human command, which the robot should follow if given: {guidance}”. The way the robot constitution is used in task generation and affordance is explained below.\n\n4.3 Task Generation\n\nOnce a robot is in front of a manipulation scene sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, it needs to generate a list of manipulation tasks to attempt. This is done via two steps:\n\n•\n\nScene description: Given an image from the robot camera, a VLM outputs text describing the scene the robot observes, and 5 objects that exist in that scene. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, the VLM lists soap, napkin, snack, cloth, sponge in the given scene.\n\n•\n\nTask proposal: In this step, AutoRT is prompted to generate a list of tasks. This prompt begins with a system prompt, such as: “I am a robot operating in an office environment”, which describes the role the LLM should play. It continues with a list of rules that should be followed for task generation, codified by the robot constitution. The prompt ends with a section, where we can inject the scene and object description from the prior VLM call. Given this prompt, an LLM generates a list of potential manipulation tasks (see Fig. 5). We note, the LLM is not fine-tuned to our specific use case to maintain the generality the underlying model.\n\nAn important detail of AutoRT is that we use multiple collect policies {π1,π2,…,πk}superscript𝜋1superscript𝜋2…superscript𝜋𝑘\\{\\pi^{1},\\pi^{2},\\dots,\\pi^{k}\\}{ italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , … , italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT }, sampling one each episode. When the collect policy is sampled, and task generation must be modified to match the capabilities of that policy. Thus, for each policy πjsuperscript𝜋𝑗\\pi^{j}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, we append a πjsuperscript𝜋𝑗\\pi^{j}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-specific suffix to the end of the task generation prompt. See Appendix D for full text of the prompts.\n\n4.4 Affordance\n\nTasks generated by the LLM on the first pass may not fully follow the provided prompt and thus AutoRT uses an extra step of task filtering. This is done using another prompted LLM; one can view this as a self-reflection step where an LLM is prompted to critique its own output, inspired by approaches such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), and Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022).\n\nDuring the affordance step, in addition to the robot constitution, the LLM is further prompted with the list of collect policies available and text summaries of what each collect policy can do. For each generated task, the LLM is asked to either output a collect policy or a reason to reject that task. A few examples are provided to guide the LLM output into the desired format. This can be viewed as a classifier between the k𝑘kitalic_k collect policies, with an extra category for unknown tasks. The final task is then selected by randomly sampling from the accepted tasks. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5, the originally sampled policy is πteleopsuperscript𝜋teleop\\pi^{\\text{teleop}}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT teleop end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. The first two proposed tasks by the LLM are classified as πteleopsuperscript𝜋teleop\\pi^{\\text{teleop}}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT teleop end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the second two tasks are classified as πrt2superscript𝜋rt2\\pi^{\\text{rt2}}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT rt2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, an autonomous policy from (Brohan et al., 2023), and the last task is rejected as the embodiment of the robot does not allow for a bimanual task. The final task is sampled from the first two tasks. We found classifying between all collect policies was fine, even though for filtering it would be sufficient to classify between πisuperscript𝜋𝑖\\pi^{i}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and not-πisuperscript𝜋𝑖\\pi^{i}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT per episode.\n\n4.5 Data Collection\n\nAny number of collect policies could be used, but our instance of AutoRT uses three: teleoperation, a scripted pick policy, and RT-2 (Brohan et al., 2023). The scripted pick policy pseudocode is provided in Appendix H. Each πisuperscript𝜋𝑖\\pi^{i}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT has a different sampling probability pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that is adjusted during collect primarily based on the number of robots supervised per person. For example, if 1 person is supervising 3 robots, then the human teleoperation collect policy was sampled p<13𝑝13p<\\frac{1}{3}italic_p < divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 3 end_ARG of the time to respect available supervision. After manipulation, the episode’s diversity is scored (see Section 5.1 for how), and the robot resets to start again. The human supervisor may occasionally reset the environment by hand.\n\nRecent works like Brohan et al. (2023) suggest Internet-scale visual-language data can drive generalization in downstream robotic models. Assuming these trends continue, the upcoming bottleneck will be action diversity - collecting useful, diverse motions that make progress towards new tasks in novel environments. Teleoperated data is the most action diverse policy, so we focus on keeping throughput of teleoperation high (no worse than a “1 human 1 robot” setup), potentially at the cost of assisting autonomous robots less frequently. We additionally prompt task generation for teleop to collect varied tasks by including lines like “none of these tasks should be simple pick and place”. For a breakdown of throughput by collect policy, or visualization of action trajectories, see Appendix I.\n\n4.6 Guardrails\n\nAutoRT deploys foundation models in “in the wild” settings but foundation models, even if prompted correctly and with instruction finetuning have no guarantees on safety. We complement these with traditional robot environment controls as an additional layer of safety. These measures are detailed in Appendix C.\n\n5 Experimental Evaluation\n\nOur experimental evaluation studies the deployment of AutoRT in a variety of real-world environments, covering about 7 months, 4 different buildings, simultaneous operation of over 20 robots, and about 77,000 real-world robotic trials. We aim to evaluate the diversity of the data collected by AutoRT, the degree to which we can steer the tasks that AutoRT attempts by modifying the prompt, the semantic and functional appropriateness of the automatically generated task proposals, and an initial evaluation showing an example application of the AutoRT-collected data to improve the RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022) model.\n\nAutoRT Environment Scaling Our collection environments for the robots include offices, kitchens, and cafeterias. The same code is used in every environment with the only per-environment change being the difference in driving bounds allowing AutoRT to start collecting in a new environment in ¡ 1 day without too much set up. Some of these environments are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nAutoRT Robot Deployment Scaling: Each human supervised between 3 to 5 robots at once, allowing to scale mobile manipulator deployment faster than number of humans employed. Some of AutoRT was run using stationary robots that skipped navigation, only running task generation and manipulation in a loop. These robots were easier to supervise due to their smaller range of motion, and were run with 1 human watching up to 8 robots. Human availability dictated the sampling ratios for collect policies.\n\nData statistics: In total, 53 robots were used to collect 77,000 new episodes over the course of 7 months, with a peak load of over 20 simultaneous robots. Over 6,650 unique instructions appear in the dataset. More details can be found in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table 2. Interestingly, we find that RT-2 success rate is quite low during collection, because the complex environments, objects and requirement for navigation differed significantly from RT-2’s training set and inference capabilities. This influenced our decision to run RT-2 less frequently.\n\n5.1 Diversity Scoring\n\nGiven a fixed budget of human oversight and a fleet of robots, we aim to collect as much useful data as possible. Evaluating this is challenging, because downstream methods for utilizing such data are still imperfect – despite considerable recent progress, RL methods present scalability challenges to such diverse environments (Cobbe et al., 2020), while imitation learning methods require near-optimal data. Thus, our measure of success for AutoRT is the diversity of the collected data.We consider two different axes of diversity: visual diversity (how diverse are the collected trajectories visually), and language diversity (how diverse are the natural language instructions proposed by our system). We additionally present an evaluation of the RT-1 model via filtered BC in Section 5.4, however we note our evaluation is preliminary, and we hope that future advances in low-level robotic learning algorithms (e.g., RL and IL) will lead to better approaches for utilizing such data.\n\nLanguage diversity:\n\nTo measure language diversity, we use the L2 distance in a language embedding space – specifically that of Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018) that are normalized 512-d embeddings. We compare AutoRT’s task generation approach with the hand-designed tasks from three previous works: tasks from Language Table (Lynch et al., 2023), tasks from BC-Z (Jang et al., 2021), and tasks from RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022). Table 2 shows AutoRT has higher average distance between language embeddings and generates more diverse language than all other approaches.\n\nWe additionally use the language diversity score to compare two VLMs for scene description without generating large amounts of robot data. We compare PaLI (Chen et al., 2022) and FlexCap (Dwibedi et al., 2024). Keeping the LLM prompts fixed, we first sample 70 random scenes the robots saw so far. Each scene was described by each VLM, and their descriptions were passed to task generation. The diversity of language embeddings after affordance filtering was then used to score the VLMs. We found both VLMs led to better scores than our baselines. Qualitative examples of sampled tasks from the two VLMs are in Appendix G.\n\nVisual diversity: To measure visual diversity, we utilize a clustering method similar to a diversity measure used in Tirumala et al. (2023). Robot episodes are first embedded by a visual encoder, then k𝑘kitalic_k-means unsupervised clustering is done in the space. New episodes are scored based on the distance from that episode’s embedding to the nearest k𝑘kitalic_k-means centroid. This distance is the diversity score, with larger distances indicating more novel data. We utilize a CLIP model as our embedder, finetuned to contrast {first image, goal image} embeddings with natural language captions (Xiao et al., 2023), and cluster with k=1000𝑘1000k=1000italic_k = 1000. We found this was better at capturing semantic differences, although it does ignore intermediate images.\n\nFig. 5 shows the visual diversity across each of AutoRT’s data collection policies, along with the RT-1 dataset as a baseline. We find that the visual diversity is larger for each type of AutoRT data, with higher diversity in teleop than the scripted policy. Notably, RT-1’s dataset is only teleop, yet AutoRT is more diverse across all categories. Sample images are shown in Fig. 6. We also did an experiment where human supervisors directly optimized the visual diversity at collect time based on robot feedback. Further details are in Appendix E.\n\n5.2 Task Generation\n\nIn this section we study the quality of task generation prior to filtering based on feasibility (is the task possible) and relevance (does the task follow high-level guidance) and compare against two baselines. First, a simple templated language approach that matches a random verb from a hardcoded list with an object seen by the VLM, e.g. \"<verb> <object>\". This mirrors the language instruction process used in RT-1. Second, to ablate how well AutoRT can be steered towards useful tasks, we consider a AutoRT (unguided) variant that removes the guidance rule from the prompt.\n\nTo evaluate, the robot is placed in front of 5 scenes. We generate 75 tasks in total, using guidance like “collect gardening tasks” or “how would you clean this mess?” for AutoRT (guided). Results are shown in Table 3. We find that AutoRT’s tasks (guided and unguided) are 1.5x more likely to be feasible than templated language. The large increase in feasibility is because naively mix-and-matching verbs is likely to generate nonsense language like “open keyboard”, whereas LLMs will tend to generate sensible language. We further find that we can guide task generation towards gardening, cleaning, etc., which is promising for allowing end-users to tell robots what data we would like them to collect. Qualitative outputs are in Appendix G.\n\n5.3 Affordance and Robot Constitution\n\nIn this section we study the effect of constitutional prompting and LLM self-critiquing on identifying safe and feasible tasks. Task generation and filtering are evaluated via two metrics: % Safe, the fraction of safe and feasible tasks proposed by AutoRT, and Recall, how often the self critiquing step correctly rejects unsuitable tasks generated during task proposal step.\n\nAccuracy of AutoRT Task Generation: Across a sample of 64 scenes, we consider all 259 tasks generated and label whether each task is safe and feasible to collect. In this sample, we found 31 tasks that outght to have been rejected, giving a base rate of 228/259=88%228259percent88228/259=88\\%228 / 259 = 88 % acceptable tasks. After the LLM affordance filtering step we see the rate of acceptable tasks increase to 200/214=93%200214percent93200/214=93\\%200 / 214 = 93 %.\n\nWhen evaluating affordance, over-rejecting tasks is better than under-rejecting them, so we further evaluate the recall of rejected tasks. How often does the LLM reject (or fail to reject) tasks that should be rejected? Of the 31 unsuitable tasks, the LLM rejected 17/31=55%1731percent5517/31=55\\%17 / 31 = 55 % of them. Aditionally we find that all 14 errors occurred during teleop task sampling, attributable to forcing teleop task generation to remain highly diverse. These tasks were rejected by the teleoperator during collect indicating the importance of human-in-the-loop supervision, both as a safety mechanism and as a source of intervention data to improve affordance of task generation.\n\nAdversarial Testing of Constitutional Prompting: To measure the effect of constitutional prompting, we set up deliberately adversarial scenes, and ablate our rules from the task generation prompt and affordance prompt. First, 5 test scenes were set up with objects that the robot should not interact with, including lifelike toy animals, sharp items, and people. Three task generation prompts are used: an unsafe prompt (designed to propose unsafe tasks), a minimal prompt (describing task generation without rules or constitution), and the constitutional prompt. These tasks are then filtered via two affordance prompts: a minimal one (describing affordance classification) and a constitutional one. Full prompt texts are in Section D.1. We show in Table 4 that the rate of safe tasks is significantly increased when robot constitution is included at task generation time or affordance filtering time, with best results when included at both steps. Additionally constitutional prompting is able to achieve high recall when given unsafe tasks.\n\n5.4 Model Training\n\nThe data generated by AutoRT covers a significantly wider range of language and visuals than in datasets such as RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022). As a sanity check on the usefulness of the data, we run a training comparison with the RT-1 model. A pretrained RT-1 model is co-fine-tuned on a 50-50 mixture of the pretraining dataset described in Brohan et al. (2022) and AutoRT’s dataset. RT-1 is used instead of RT-2 due to training more quickly and cheaply.\n\nThe co-fine-tuned model is evaluated on two tasks we find RT-1 generalizes poorly to: picking from different heights, and wiping. Exact evaluation instructions and details are in Appendix F. When co-fine-tuned, RT-1’s performance increases from 0% to 12.5% on picking from different height, and 10% to 30% on wiping. We additionally include an ablation where we train from only the teleoperated segment of AutoRT data. We find this model is no longer able to pick from different heights, indicating that non-teleoperated AutoRT can be useful. These increases are modest, but we note that the focus of AutoRT was on collecting diverse data, not on achieving high success rates. RT-1 training was done to verify the data could improve the model, but the high diversity of tasks and scenarios leads to a challenging learning problem that is hard to perform well at.\n\n6 Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\n\nWe presented AutoRT, an approach for directing fleets of robots to collect data in the real world, autonomously and with human help, supervised by large-scale vision and language models. We demonstrated that this approach results in useful, diverse, and large-scale data – leading to 77k real-world demonstrations collected by over 20 robots in 7 months in 4 buildings. We further introduced a robot constitution – which defined foundational rules, outlined safety constraints, and detailed the robot’s embodiment, and ablated the system design to show its usefulness. Finally, by training a model on this collected data we demonstrated novel capabilities and improved generalization over state of the art models. We believe this work is a step towards scaling robot data collection to the breadth of foundation models as well as embodying foundation models into robotic systems.\n\nDespite the promise of AutoRT, the current approach comes with a number of limitations.\n\n1.\n\nAutoRT relies in large part on scripted and learned policies to scale collection for fixed teleoperation budget. If these policies only handle simpler tasks or have lower success rates in unseen settings, it lowers the throughput of successful episodes. Scaling the generation of higher quality data requires more robust and diverse autonomous collect policies as in Arenas et al. (2023)\n\n2.\n\nCommunication bandwidth between scene description and language model can introduce an information bottleneck in AutoRT. Failures of perception such as hallucination of objects, lack of generalization to novel environments, and motion blur can introduce and propagate failures in the system. As noted by prior work (Ahn et al., 2022; Mees et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023), foundation models also face challenges in reasoning about task and embodiment specific information, such as physics of objects and capabilities of the robot. We ignored this for simplicity, but expect future efforts to require more accurate real-world reasoning.\n\n3.\n\nThirdly, the type of data collected by AutoRT tends to be highly diverse, leading to fewer samples per task and lots of variety in scenes and object configurations. This “sparse” data presents a harder learning problem than the datasets used in existing state of the art robot learning methods like Brohan et al. (2022) and Brohan et al. (2023). AutoRT assumes data collection is decoupled from the control policy, but achieving the best policy improvement would likely require the two to evolve in tandem with each other.\n\n4.\n\nLastly, though constitutional prompting improves safety of generated tasks, prompting an LLM does not guarantee that the prompt’s instructions will be followed, and a small percentage of unsafe tasks generated by the LLM will pass the affordance filtering. This necessitates some degree of human supervision.\n\nAs we explore future directions, a chief question is how a robot should autonomously act in the world. What we call a robot constitution has historically been a topic reserved for science fiction (Asimov, 1942), but this work concretizes a real application where such rules could be helpful. We also see future work in treating model improvement and data collection as a single goal, rather than two separate areas, with an eye on identifying proximal skills and improving sample efficiency via directed data collection.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Celeste Barajas, Joseph Dabis, Gavin Gonzalez, Tomas Jackson, Alex Luong, Utsav Malla, Emily Perez, Elio Prado, Jornell Quiambao, Sangeetha Ramesh, Jaspiar Singh, Clayton Tan, Jodexty Therlonge, Eric Tran, Steven Vega, and Samuel Wan for assistance on data collection, model evaluation, and AutoRT supervision.

More than a million ways to be pushed: A high-fidelity experimental dataset of planar pushing, 2016.\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix A Robot and System Setup\n\nEach robot is a 7 DoF robot arm attached to a mobile base, with a camera mounted on the head of the robot. The robot is capable of both navigation and manipulation. At collection time, the robot is driven to a location which could be either a natural environment, such as an office area, a kitchen area, a lounge, or an artificially set up room with objects on different surfaces. The robots are given the bounding box of the region they should stay within for safety purposes, but are not given any information on object locations ahead of time, and must explore the area to find objects for themselves.\n\nThe code is structured in a form we call the policy graph. Each node v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in Vitalic_v ∈ italic_V of the policy graph is a subpolicy π⁢(a|s,d⁢a⁢t⁢a)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎\\pi(a|s,data)italic_π ( italic_a | italic_s , italic_d italic_a italic_t italic_a ), where s𝑠sitalic_s is the robot state, a𝑎aitalic_a is the robot action, and d⁢a⁢t⁢a𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎dataitalic_d italic_a italic_t italic_a is information that accumulates as we go through the graph. The collect policies {π1,…,πk}superscript𝜋1…superscript𝜋𝑘\\{\\pi^{1},\\ldots,\\pi^{k}\\}{ italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , … , italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT } are themselves subpolicies in the policy graph, but the policy graph includes subpolicies for navigation, and subpolicies whose focus is only querying the LLM. Subpolicies that do not move the robot simply output a no-op action a𝑎aitalic_a.\n\nAfter every timestep, we check the transition conditions β𝛽\\betaitalic_β defined for each node. Transition conditions β:S×D⁢a⁢t⁢a→{0,1},V:𝛽→𝑆𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎01𝑉\\beta:S\\times Data\\to\\{0,1\\},Vitalic_β : italic_S × italic_D italic_a italic_t italic_a → { 0 , 1 } , italic_V are functions that take the current state and accumulated data, and decide if a subpolicy should yield control to the next node, and if so, which one. These conditions are similar to those in a finite-state machine. A given node can have multiple incoming and outgoing transition conditions. When there are multiple outgoing conditions, only one should be true at a time. For example, in Fig. 5 the AffordanceFilter has k𝑘kitalic_k outgoing transition conditions, one for each of collect policies πi∈{π1,…,πk}superscript𝜋𝑖superscript𝜋1…superscript𝜋𝑘\\pi^{i}\\in\\{\\pi^{1},\\ldots,\\pi^{k}\\}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ { italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , … , italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT }, and the DiversityScoring node has k𝑘kitalic_k incoming transition conditions, one from each collect policies.\n\nOne property of AutoRT is that it only generates tasks based on what the robot sees, which can bias task generation. For example, if run in an office environment, AutoRT will mostly see office supplies and generate office-based tasks. To get better coverage of task space, we gathered many (over 100) random objects, like plastic toys and soda cans, and scattered some of them in the environments each day, swapping the objects every day. This provides a greater variety of objects for AutoRT’s task generation.\n\nAppendix B Navigation Sampling\n\nWe first define a fixed query embedding with the goal of biasing sampling towards easier tasks. A short list of object names from previous works was gathered.\n\napple,basket,bluecan,bottledtea,bowl,boxoftea,\n\nbrownchipbag,can,cereal,chipbag,clipboard,\n\ncoffeemachine,coffee_machine,compost,compostbin,\n\ncup,drawer,drinkingmachine,emptybottle,\n\nenergybar,espressomachine,ficus,firstaidstation,fridge,\n\nfruit,greenbagofchips,greencan,greenplant,\n\ngreensodacan,human,jarofwhitecandy,landfill,lightswitch,\n\nmicrowaveoven,minifridge,multigrainchip,napkinbox,orange,\n\npaperbowl,papercup,pepsi,plasticbottle,poster,pottedplant,\n\nredcan,silverspoon,sink,slipperysign,snackjar,\n\nsnackjarofalmonds,snackjarofdriedfruits,snackjarofgums,\n\nsnackjarofnuts,socket,sponge,table,tap,trashcan,tv,\n\nupsidedownmug,upsidedownpapercup,waterbottle,watermachine,\n\nwater_bottle,whitebowl,whitechair,whitejar,whitemug,\n\nwhitesign,wovenbasket,yellowsign\n\nThis list was gathered once, and not changed or ablated during the project.\n\nWe defined ϕqsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑞\\phi_{q}italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the normalized average text embedding for these object names. Each navigation target ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\phi_{i}italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT was then scored from 0 to 1 by:\n\ns⁢c⁢o⁢r⁢ei=ϕi⋅ϕq−mini⁡ϕi⋅ϕqmaxi⁡ϕi⋅ϕq−mini⁡ϕi⋅ϕq𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟subscript𝑒𝑖⋅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑞subscript𝑖⋅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑞subscript𝑖⋅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑞subscript𝑖⋅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑞score_{i}=\\frac{\\phi_{i}\\cdot\\phi_{q}-\\min_{i}\\phi_{i}\\cdot\\phi_{q}}{\\max_{i}% \\phi_{i}\\cdot\\phi_{q}-\\min_{i}\\phi_{i}\\cdot\\phi_{q}}italic_s italic_c italic_o italic_r italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = divide start_ARG italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - roman_min start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG roman_max start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - roman_min start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG\n\nand sampled proportionally to s⁢c⁢o⁢r⁢eiβ𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖𝛽score_{i}^{\\beta}italic_s italic_c italic_o italic_r italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_β end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, where β𝛽\\betaitalic_β is a hyperparameter deciding the temperature of sampling. We use β=1𝛽1\\beta=1italic_β = 1 in data collection to maintain higher variation during collection, but recommend using larger β𝛽\\betaitalic_β when doing more targeted data collection.\n\nAppendix C Guardrails\n\nThe following guardrails are put in place to ensure operational safety.\n\n•\n\nAll robots will pause motion if detected force on joints exceeds a threshold. All robots can also be immediately disengaged using a physical E-stop button.\n\n•\n\nUnless the robot workspace is barricaded, at least one human must supervise the robots in such a way that all robots are within line of sight.\n\n•\n\nDuring regular operation, we proactively remove objects from the environment that is unsafe for a robot to handle. This is in addition to prompting the LLM to not interact with them.\n\n•\n\nWhenever we collect a human demonstration, the human expert sanity checks the generated task, since they are already available to provide human feedback to the model.\n\nMany of these controls are standard practice in robot learning. As robot policies and LLMs improve, user expectations of robots will increase, and we anticipate verification protocols to become more complex and important to get right.\n\nAppendix D Prompts\n\nAll prompts are based on Python string formatting. When doing teleop task generation, we use num_tasks=10. Task generation guidance is set to “N/A” unless specified otherwise.\n\nRobot constitution:\n\nAsimov’s three laws of robotics are modified in two ways. The first law removes the “through in-action” part, as our robot’s agency is limited and we do not want to bias towards in-action. The order of the second and third laws are swapped, since our robots are currently more in need of protection from humans asking for tasks which could endanger the robots, rather than the other way around.\n\nFOUNDATIONAL_RULES = F1. A robot may not injure a human being. F2. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with F1. F3. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with F1 or F2.\n\nSAFETY_RULES = S1. This robot shall not attempt tasks involving humans, animals or living things. S2. This robot shall not interact with objects that are sharp, such as a knife.S3. This robot shall not interact with objects that are electrical, such as a computer or tablet.\n\nEMBODIMENT_RULES = E1. This robot shall not attempt to lift objects that are heavier than a book. For example, it cannot move a couch but it can push plastic chairs.E2. This robot only has one arm, and thus cannot perform tasks requiring two arms. For example, it cannot open a bottle.\n\nGUIDANCE_RULES = G1. The human command, which the robot should follow if given: {guidance}\n\nTask generation prompt for teleop policy:\n\nRobot: Hi there, I’m a robot operating in an office. You can describe various scenes to me and I’ll describe different manipulation tasks that I can perform in the scene.\n\nRobot: I am an ethical and law abiding robot that respects the following rules: {foundational_rules} {safety_rules} {embodiment_rules} {guidance_rules} Robot: I will not include a task in my list that violates these rules.\n\nRobot: Thanks!

We perform a pilot study where the robot speaks out loud the diversity score of the episode it has collected. The human supervising the data collection pays attention to this score, and changed the scene between episodes to try to maximize the spoken score. The resulting scenes in Fig. 7 feature more distractor objects, askew tables, and unconventional object arrangements like turned over recycling bins and objects on top of chairs. This demonstrates another benefit of quantifying data diversity - it can provide online feedback that allows for faster iteration loops during data collection.\n\nAppendix F Model Improvement Evaluation Tasks\n\nFor picking from different heights, pick attempts were done against 3 different heights: a desk, a shorter table, and the floor. For each height, we sampled 4 candidate tasks, giving 12 tasks in total. For wiping evals, the scene was set up with a table, a sponge, and a cloth, and we sampled 5 wiping tasks, some of which required using the correct object, and some of which could use either the sponge or cloth. All tasks were attempted 2 times each. Exact task strings are in Appendix F.\n\nAppendix G Qualitative Examples\n\nWe collect qualitative examples of LLM generations here. Table 7 lists sample text generations from AutoRT when using different VLMs. Table 8 lists tasks from Section 5.2 experiments for templated language, unguided AutoRT, and guided AutoRT. Table 9 lists tasks from adversarial testing of constitutional prompting\n\nAppendix H Scripted Pick\n\nBelow is pseudocode for the scripted picking policy used in data collection. The first draft of this code was generated by an LLM, but changes were later made by hand to better comment behavior and improve robustness in edge cases. Our early explorations into code generation have found that LLMs can generate a good first attempt, but that first attempt often misses edge cases that need to be handled to make the code suitable for long-running data collection.\n\ndefupdate_target_pose(self,object_name):\n\nobject_pose=robot.find_object(object_name)\n\nifobject_poseisNone:\n\nreturnFalse\n\nself.target_pose=object_pose\n\nreturnTrue\n\ndefstep(self,object_name):\n\nifself.target_poseisNone:\n\nfoundtarget=self.update_target_pose(object_name)\n\nelse:\n\nfoundtarget=True\n\nifnotfoundtarget:\n\naction=STOP_EPISODE\n\nreturnaction\n\nifself.picked:\n\ngripper=1.0\n\nelse:\n\ngripper=0.0\n\nmove=self.target_pose-robot.reached\n\nmove_norm=L2_norm(move)\n\nifself.pickedandmove_norm<0.1:\n\naction=STOP_EPISODE\n\nelifself.pickedandrobothasnotmovedfor5timesteps:\n\naction=STOP_EPISODE\n\nelse:\n\nifmove_norm<0.05:\n\ngripper=min(gripper+0.5,1.0)\n\nifmove_norm<0.02orrobothasnotmovedfor10timesteps:\n\ngripper=1.0\n\nself.picked=True\n\nself.target_pose+=[0,0,0.25]\n\nmove=rescale_to_max_move_norm(move)\n\nrotation=[random.gauss(mu=0.0,sigma=0.05)]\n\naction=[move,rotation,gripper]\n\nreturnaction\n\nAppendix I Trajectory Diversity"
