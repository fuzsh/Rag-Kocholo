There were some doozy first sentences though.\n\n-----\n\nI'm happy to talk/write about any of the above, especially if anyone has any strong opinions about any of them.\n\n-----\n\nIn 2024, I'll soon finish two longer books (The Brothers Karamazov and Lonesome Dove) that I've been reading in 2023. It has been a great pleasure to run a book cub focused on Stephen King's Dark Tower, a crazy idea that I had that I got away with doing. That book club will continue in 2024 and so I'll finish The Dark Tower and probably read more Stephen King. I'm planning on reading Beloved for the first time this spring. Otherwise, I don't have much planned for 2024. I'll read at whim as usual.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
