        "text": "Isaac Asimov (c. January 2, 1920[a] – April 6, 1992) was a writer of science fiction.[1] He was also a biochemist with a PhD from Columbia University.\n\nAsimov was born in Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast, Russian SFSR to a Jewish family, on an unknown date between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 1920. Asimov celebrated his birthday on January 2.[a] He was taken to the United States when he was three, and learned English and Yiddish as his native languages.[2][3][4] He wrote many books. People know about Isaac Asimov because of his science fiction books and his science books for non-scientists.\n\nAsimov's most famous books were the Foundation series. He also wrote the Galactic Empire, the Robot Series, mystery, fantasy, and non-fiction books. He wrote the Norby series with his wife, Janet Asimov. He wrote or edited over 500 books and about 90,000 letters. Other subjects he wrote about were history, the Bible, literature, and sexuality.\n\nMany of Asimov's early writings were short stories published in cheap science fiction and fantasy magazines. Years later, most of them were collected and republished as collections. Well-known collections include I, Robot, The Rest of the Robots, Earth is Room Enough and The Early Asimov.\n\nAsimov made a list of 15 of his science fiction books, which he advised should be read in this order:\n\nI, Robot (1950). Alternatively, The Complete Robot (1982).\n\nCaves of Steel (1954).\n\nThe Naked Sun (1957).\n\nThe Robots of Dawn (1983).\n\nRobots and Empire (1985).\n\nThe Currents of Space (1952).\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust (1951).\n\nPebble in the Sky (1950).\n\nPrelude to Foundation (1988).\n\nForward the Foundation (1993).\n\nFoundation (1951).\n\nFoundation and Empire (1952).\n\nSecond Foundation (1953).\n\nFoundation's Edge (1982).\n\nFoundation and Earth (1986).\n\nNumbers 1–5 are 'Robot' books; 6–8 are 'Galacticos Empire' books; 9–15 are Foundation series books.[5]\n\nAsimov's novels have influenced science fiction on television and movie. Especially his 'Three Laws of Robotics' is a lasting contribution to our thinking.\n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nA robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nAlthough ethnically a Jew, Asimov was an atheist:\n\n\"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me quite a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow ... it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic\".[6]\n\nWhen he had heart surgery in 1983, he received blood infected with HIV. He developed AIDS, and died of the effects of the medical condition in 1992. His widow did not speak of this until years later.[7]"
