For instance, the July–August issue of TBT will be posted online during the first weeks of July, while the large-print and cartridge editions of TBT will be mailed out during the first weeks of August.

Selections from this newsletter that may be of interest to NLS patrons are reprinted in Talking Book Topics and Braille Book Review.\n\nFrom NLS On the Move, originally published March 22, 2018\n\nOur TV and radio campaign is off to a strong start\n\nThe first three-week “flight” of our new TV and radio commercials ended Sunday, and we couldn’t be happier with the results. On average, close to 190 calls per day were transferred to network libraries from potential patrons who saw or heard the commercials and dialed the special toll-free phone numbers—almost three times as many as we expected! We also had a big increase in visits to our outreach website, www.loc.gov/thatallmayread, and completions of the information request form.\n\nAnd the feedback has been great! We even heard from Dana Ferguson, the New York City-based actor who plays the mom, who told us her real-life father saw the spot while watching an old western movie on the Grit network. (“He’s so proud,” she said.)\n\nThe commercials will run in cycles of three weeks on, three weeks off, through the summer of 2019. The digital side of the campaign, which promotes NLS on Facebook and online search engines, also continues through the summer of 2019.\n\nFrom NLS On the Move, originally published April 26, 2018\n\nUpdates on MOCA, the outreach campaign, and more\n\nThe second three-week flight of TV and radio commercials began March 26 and ended April 15. Between February 26 (when the commercials began to air) and April 23, more than 10,000 calls came in to network libraries.\n\nBy the way, the TV and radio public service announcements (PSAs) that we launched in June 2016 continue to air in some markets, even though we stopped tracking the results after six months. In fact, our TV PSA, “Our Stories: That All May Read,” was rated in the top 10 percent of TV PSAs in 2017 as reported by Nielsen Media Research! (Unlike the TV and radio commercials, PSAs are aired for free when stations have time to fill.)\n\nThe Regional and Subregional Libraries of the Year will be honored at a luncheon in the historic Thomas Jefferson Building at the Library of Congress on May 17. The Colorado Talking Book Library (CTBL) in Denver received the Regional Library of the Year Award, while Braille and Talking Books at Taylor Community Library (BTBTCL) in Taylor, Michigan, received the Sub-regional Library/Advisory and Outreach Center of the Year Award.\n\nNewsstand\n\nThe following announcements may be of interest to readers. The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped reserves the right to publish announcements selectively, as space permits. The items mentioned, however, are not part of the NLS program, and their listings do not imply endorsement or support. Prices and details about listed items were correct at the time of compilation but are susceptible to change.\n\nNew Hadley course on guide dogs\n\nPatrons considering getting a guide dog may find a new course from Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired helpful in thinking through this significant decision. Free of charge, this course describes the benefits and challenges of guide dogs and is available in braille and large-print formats, online, or as a digital talking-book (DTB) cartridge. Call Hadley at toll-free at 1-855-830-5355 to enroll\n\nBooks for Adults\n\nBooks listed in this issue of Talking Book Topics were recently sent to cooperating libraries. The complete collection contains a wide range of fiction and nonfiction books, including biographies, classics, westerns, mysteries, romances, and others.\n\nRegistered users may also immediately download all titles and magazines from the NLS Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) service at https://nlsbard.loc.gov. The free BARD Mobile app is available from the App Store, Google Play, and Amazon’s Appstore for reading talking books on your personal smart phone or tablet. To learn more about the collection or to sign up for BARD, contact your local cooperating library. Regional library telephone numbers and email addresses are listed on the last pages of this magazine.\n\nBooks within the headings Adult Fiction and Adult Nonfiction are listed alphabetically by subject category, author last name, and title. For example the title War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy would be listed in Adult Fiction under the Classics subject category and by the last name Tolstoy.\n\nNote: A notice may appear immediately following the book description to indicate occurrences of violence, strong language, or descriptions of sex. The word “some” before any of these terms indicates an occasional or infrequent occurrence, as in “some strong language.” Commercials for which NLS does not have access to the print book may display the notice “unrated,” which means that the book may or may not contain violence, strong language, or descriptions of sex.\n\nBack to top\n\nAdult Fiction\n\nAdventure\n\nNightwalker: Batman\n\nDB89980 8 hours 41 minutes\n\nby Marie Lu\n\nread by Will Damron\n\nThe Nightwalkers are terrorizing Gotham City, and a teenage Bruce Wayne is on their hit list.
