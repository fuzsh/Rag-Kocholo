        "text": "I know I said that I was going to start writing blurbs about books so that I recall better and digest it, but to be honest, work has been insane and all I’ve been finishing lately are spicy books because my brain needs a break.\n\nThe other day I needed one of these brain breaks, but on a larger level and a treat, so I stopped by starbucks for my new treat obsession (Venti Pink Drink with Chocolate Cold Foam if you are curious) and decided to stop by Barnes and Noble for some retail therapy. Now, I know I am probably close to 100 books on my bookshelf that I haven’t even cracked open yet, but Barnes and Noble oh so helpfully emailed me that there was a new novel from Chuck Palaniuk, and I wanted to pick it up.\n\nWhile wandering and trying to locate the new Palaniuk (new releases section BTW, because of course that was the last place I looked), I passed by the John Scalzi section and “The Kaiju Preservation Society” caught my eye. I previously read, and listened to the audio books of “Lock In” and “Head On” and absolutely loved them. Couldn’t get into “Redshirts” yet, but I’ll give it another shot someday. KPS seemed interesting, and since I cannot say no to a book that seems interesting, I added it to my growing stack.\n\nWhen I got home, because I have shiny new object syndrome, I cracked open KPS to give it a shot, and boy am I happy I did. I got sucked in right away, and just a few chapters in there was a section that had me laughing out loud with tears in my eyes.\n\nThe story is a fun ride, and it has an excellent balance of uproariously funny points. If you want an enjoyable book to read, highly recommend!\n\nP.S. I also noticed that Scalzi had a new book only available in hardcover, and since I was about to take a roadtrip, I got the audiobook and thoroughly enjoyed that one as well. It helps that Wil Wheaton could read a cereal box and I’d listen to it.\n\nP.P.S. Seriously, If you haven’t listened to Wil Wheaton, check out anything he’s read, but I can personally attest to this book, Lock In by John Scalzi, Head On by John Scalzi, Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, or Ready Player Two by Ernest Cline. Ready Player One is one of my top books of all time, and makes for a great roadtrip!\n\nI must have went into Barnes and Noble for something specific, but as per usual and regardless of whether I actually found what I was looking for, I added this book to my massive pile.\n\nI came across this book in the LGBTQ+ Section. I’ve picked up a handful of books from this section lately, and have found the voices to be interesting, the content to be fresh, and the genre to run the entire gamut of my interests, from Fantasy and Science Fiction, to Romance, to Memoir and Biographical.\n\nI believe on this trip was the first time I noticed the #booktok signs, and had to look up what this was. After this, I have a tendency to pay closer attention to the #booktok signs, since I feel that the wider social media audience has a better pulse than the reviewers, a la Rotten Tomatoes critic scores vs audience scores.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nI picked up this book based on the cover, and the synopsis on the back sounded like something I would enjoy. I tucked it into my fun reads section of my “I’m not read yet!” shelf when I got back home. Since I pick up so many books at a time, and have a tendency to jump around, I completely forgot the synopsis summary, but recalled that I wanted to put it near the top of my reading list, so when I was looking for something to clear my brain from work training materials, I grabbed this and sat down.\n\nThe voice hooked me right away. Sometimes I will pick up a book and it will take me awhile to decide if it is something I’m going to binge or have to work at to finish. This is one of the books that from the first sentences, I was engaged and knew that this was going to be a binge. As a contrast, once I finished, I re-read the critic quotes on the back cover and noticed that it said “McQuiston’s writing reads like poetry. One Last Stop is meant to be savored slowly” (Helen Hoang, Author of The Kiss Quotient). I agree with most of Ms. Hoang’s assessment of the book, but savoring slowly was not in the cards.\n\nOnce I picked this book up, it was one of those that I found hard to put back down. Anytime I took a break from reading to do something as trivial as working, the book was calling to me to pick it back up and continue tearing through the pages and lose myself in this world.\n\nMcQuiston’s writing is highly accessible, striking a balance between descriptive prose and understandable dialogue. There are pop culture references that fit well into the story, without feeling like it is written for a certain generation that has to be familiar with the references. Descriptions just feel right, enough to bring the reader into the scene, the feeling, the moment, without overwhelming the reader with non-essential detail. The characters are relatable and feel real. They have rich full lives and explored backstories enough to bring them out of two dimensional territory, without overshadowing the main storyline.\n\nAs a (mostly) straight cis-gendered female raised in a generation before fluidity in gender and sexual orientation was mainstream, it was possible for me to connect with the characters easily. That is not to say that some may still be challenged to connect with characters in the book, but that would fall on the readers shoulders to be open to the fluidity of gender and sexual orientation. I would hope that we as a society would already be at the point where this would be a book that would be a best seller based on the story alone, regardless of the fact that the main character is a lesbian and other characters are every color of the LGBTQ+ rainbow. Alas, we may not be there yet, but this story certainly is a step in the right direction.\n\nAll in all, a well written and well rounded story that hit all the right beats. There’s a great primary storyline, real emotion and feeling, fantastically built tension (both story wise and sexually), tasteful and critical to story sexual encounters that feel authentic rather than dirty, and pacing that keeps the reader engaged through the entire book.\n\nI have a lot more books to get through that haven’t been read yet, but I have a feeling this will be re-read before that pile is even dented.\n\nLink to One Last Stop at Barnes and Noble\n\n68 Books.\n\nThat is the number of books I just counted on my “I’m not read yet!” shelf. That doesn’t even count the books I have scattered around my house on endtables, shelves, in boxes, or in my car. That’s depressing and exciting at the same time.\n\nThere is this whole world of things that I purchased so that I could read them. To experience a story from a new perspective. To learn something. To be become a better version of myself.\n\nAnd here the opportunity begins.\n\nI’ve always had it in the back of my mind to write a little bit down about the things I read. To maybe remember it better, to understand it better, or just remind myself later of all of the things. So here we are.\n\nMy plan is to write whatever strikes me, while I’m reading, after I’ve finished, or just to note that I did read something.\n\nIn case you are curious, I’ve tried to categorize my bookshelves and currently have the following categories:\n\nI’m not read yet!\n\nVampires\n\nDystopia\n\nLearn Something New\n\nPeople’s Stories\n\nPoetic\n\nClassic\n\nCollege\n\nI’ve only actually organized a portion, so these categories will likely grow. You will likely see me read and hopefully post a few words on some or all of the following types: futuristic, dystopian, fantasy, sci-fi, technical, business, autobiography/biography/memoir, psychology, and yes Romance…the sweet dirty smutty fun stuff.\n\nSo off we go!\n\nDisclaimer: I did this before with a technical blog and posted a few times over nine years, with days or years between posts. So no promises are made at this point, as this is just for my own enjoyment."
