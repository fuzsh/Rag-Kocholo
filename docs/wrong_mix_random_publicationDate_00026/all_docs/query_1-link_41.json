These are different from references to previous episodes or running gags which should be listed in separate sections on the episode pages and therefore not on this page. This is an aggregate page for the collection of all the Cultural References found in each episode.\n\nNOTE: If you add a cultural reference to this page please make sure you also place it on the page specific to the episode in which it occurs. This page should just be a collection of information found on the individual pages.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nEpisode 1 - Mole Hunt[]\n\nRolling Stone: The picture of Malory with her dog Duchess is a visual reference to the famous 1981 Rolling Stone cover featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono.\n\nJenga: When Crenshaw asks Archer if he thinks torture simulation is a game Archer responds, \"No, I think Jenga's a game...\"\n\nPuttin' on the Ritz: Archer says the dog Abelard's barking sounds like the famous song written by Irving Berlin.\n\nI know you like Greek: Archer tells the French Flight attendentto, \"go to the diner, I know you like Greek\" meaning anal sex. Apperently the Greeks invented anal sex. For a much more in depth understanding of the joke, check this out.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964-1968): The entrance to ISIS being through the Four-Five-Six Laundry is a reference to the popular 1960's American TV program, where the \"Agent's Entrance\" was through a dressing room in Del Flora's Tailor Shop, which was also a dry-cleaning shop.\n\nIndira Gandhi: Archer states that his shirt smells like the former prime minister of India's thong.\n\nKeebler Elves: Archer mentioning that his brain is like a tree and Lana is the little cookie elves.\n\nBrian's Song (1971): Archer suggests that he helped a guy with cancer, as in the movie about a football player stricken with terminal cancer and his friendship with his teammate.\n\nJohnny Bench: Archer makes a quip to Malory about the former catcher for the Cincinnati Reds famous for having big hands when he says \"Johnny Bench called\" after catching her masturbating during phone-sex with Nikolai Jakov.\n\nHungry Hungry Hippo: When offering Pam donuts, Archer tells her he'll dump them on the floor, and she can pretend that they're marbles and she's the classic board game.\n\nMission: Impossible (1996): The manner in which Archer lists off the security measures that guard the ISIS mainframe is reminiscent to the way Ethan Hunt describes the security system guarding the IMF Mainframe in the American spy film.\n\nWedding Crashers (2005): While Archer is at lunch with Cheryl/Carol the flashbacks include him repeatedly telling her \"just the tip\" is a possible reference to monolog on dating given by the Jeremy Grey character in the American comedy film.\n\nLuger P08: Not exactly a cultural reference, but an interesting detail: Crenshaw is wielding a Luger P08, a famous German handgun from World Wars I and II. It's odd (albeit, not implausible) that Crenshaw, a Russian spy for the KGB, would use a German weapon.\n\nEpisode 2 - Training Day[]\n\nTraining Day (2001): The name of the episode could be a reference to this movie.\n\nJames Bond: Cyril dismisses Lana's apparent attraction to Archer at first, claiming she was \"shaken up.\" Malory retorts that Lana was in fact \"stirred up in the loins.\" There is a strong possibility that part of the conversation was a reference to the famous James Bond line: \"Shaken, not stirred.\" Also, Archer is referred to being like the famous fictional Spy. Furthermore, Lana drives an Aston Martin Vantage, which featured in the 1987 Bond film The Living Daylights.\n\nOprah Winfrey: Archer calls Krieger his Oprah in reference to syndicated tabloid talk show host famous for being a good listener.\n\nKaren Carpenter: Pam refers to Cheryl as Karen Carpenter's stunt double. The American singer was partially famous for having Anorexia.\n\nKrav Maga: Mentioned as the martial arts practiced by ISIS agents, Krav Maga was specifically developed by the Israeli Intelligence Service Mossad and is regarded as one of the deadliest forms of martial arts.\n\nDane Cook: Archer states that Karate is the Dane Cook of martial arts. The American comedian is often maligned for being boring and bad.\n\nChekhov's Gun: A literary device on which the name of Archer's underwear pistol is a pun. However, the actual \"Chekhov's gun\" turns out to be the \"poison\" pen.\n\nO. Henry / Alanis Morissette: While fleeing with the \"dead\" hooker, Archer says \"this is like O. Henry and Alanis Morissette had a baby and named it this exact situation.\" O. Henry was an American author noted for his use of irony and Morissette is a Canadian-American singer who had a major hit with a song titled Ironic in the mid 1990s.\n\n1953 Iranian coup d'état: In a flashback to his childhood, Archer receives a telegram from his mother saying \"AJAX a success, Tehran is ours!\" revealing she was involved in the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh which the US codenamed Operation AJAX. Additionally, Uncle Kermit is a reference to Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. the grandson of Theodore Roosevelt and CIA coordinator for the operation.\n\nMilton Berle: Archer is incensed when Lana isn't upset at Cyril for his deception and asks, \"So he just gets a pass? Like Milton Berle?” Like Cyril, Milton Berle was known to have an extremely large penis.\n\nStasi / Shining Path: Archer references two Communist groups during his argument with Cyril. The Stasi was the former official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) colloquially known as East Germany. The Shining Path is the Communist party / insurgency movement in Peru.\n\nEpisode 3 - Diversity Hire[]\n\n\"Quadroon\" is an antiquated racial category used in racial discrimination laws. In some contexts, it may be considered a racially charged term for a person who is 1/4 black and 3/4 white. In other contexts, it is an accepted English word to describe any particular mixed-race individual known to be 3/4 of any single race and 1/4 of any other race, with no offense intended or received.\n\nWhen Malory asks Conway if he knows how to whistle, it is a reference to the film \"To Have and Have Not\"[1]\n\nWhen Archer fails to come up with a witty response to Conway's \"You see something you like\" after their nude confrontation in the locker room, Conway suggests that Archer should have insulted him with the line \"Sammy Gayvis Jr.\". Sammy Davis Jr. was a famous entertainer who (like Conway) was both Black and Jewish.\n\nMalory makes a joke about J. \"Edna\" Hoover which is a reference to J. Edgar Hoover's involvement in COINTELPRO and Hoover's rumored cross-dressing.\n\nPam remarks to Archer when he asks her to unreject a complaint on the ISIS computers \"who am I, Tron?\", a reference to the 1982 Disney film Tron in which characters have miniature alter-egos inside of a computer.\n\nAfter Conway dispatches of the henchmen around Sterling using a sniper rifle, Sterling says \"That was amazing! It was like...like\" to which Conway finishes, \"A Charles Whitman Sampler?\" a reference to the box of Whitman's Sampler chocolates as well as a reference to Charles Whitman , a former US Marine who on August 1, 1966 climbed the tower at the University of Texas in Austin and used a sniper rifle to go on a mass shooting rampage that resulted in the deaths of 17 people.\n\nEpisode 4 - Killing Utne[]\n\nThe name of Krieger's sex-bot is \"Fister Roboto\", which is a play-on-words reference to the song \"Mr. Roboto\" written by Dennis DeYoung and produced by the band Styx.\n\n\"You don't get along with your neighbors anywhere\" is a reference to Arrested Development, an American TV series on which a number of voice actors on Archer worked.\n\nWhen Archer is in the bathroom he hears Jakov speaking, he opens the compact device and sees Jakov on the screen. Jakov says, \"What is the frequency?\" to which Archer responds \"Kenneth?\" This is a reference to a 1986 incident in which CBS News anchor Dan Rather was assaulted by William Tager on Park Avenue in New York City. The assailant repeatedly asked Rather, \"Kenneth, what is the frequency?\" The phrase inspired the title of the song \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" by R.E.M..\n\nArcher makes a reference to Dr. Bellows and Jeannie from the 1960s American sitcom I Dream of Jeannie.\n\nLana uses the line \"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\" This is a direct quote from Darth Vader in the 1977 film Star Wars. When Malory orders her to relinquish her hold on Cyril's shoulder/collarbone after she catches him ogling Archer's call girl, their exchange \"Lana, release him!\" \"As you wish,\" mirrors the exchange between Governor Tarkin and Darth Vader from the same scene of the film.\n\nWhile in Trudy Beekman's bathroom, Mallory orders Archer and Cyril to drop the bodies next to \"that awful Louis Quinze repro.' This is a reference to a style of furniture that appeared during the reign of Louis XV of France.\n\nAlso, while in Trudy's bathroom, Malory orders everyone to take Sterling's gun and shoot the bodies. This is reminiscent of the scene in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express where the train passengers take turns stabbing a kidnapper's body to exact revenge as they were all connected to the victims by family and friendship.\n\nUtne calls Lana \"Truckasaurus\" when she twists his wrist after he fondles her gun a little too long. Archer does a robotic Truckasaurus imitation when Malory tells him she thinks Lana just broke his hand. Truckasaurus[2] was a car crushing robot from an episode of The Simpsons.\n\nEpisode 5 - Honeypot[]\n\nThe top of the Chinese Restaurant menu in the second scene has the words \"干煸东岸白狗便便.\" This roughly translates as \"stir-fried eastern shore white dog poo-poo.\" And according to Bing Translator, It translates as: \"Dry-fried white dog poo on the East Coast.\"\n\nArcher's \"Got Dick?\" tee shirt is a reference to the \"Got Milk?\" ads.\n\nA vastly incomplete Kill Bang Marry result section.\n\nWoodhouse says that Reggie Thistleton died in Flanders during the Great War .\n\nThe Nazi uniforms were produced in the plant owned by Hugo Boss .\n\nLimestone is a very hard rock type. (It actually is not)\n\nArcher asks how to say \"Hulk\" in Spanish. Hulk is a Marvel superhero.\n\nEpisode 6 - Skorpio[]\n\nWhen listing the amenities available on the Argo, after Lana mentions the \"hot Filipina masseuses\" Archer cuts in with the question \"Skeet?\" to which Lana replies \"Probably!\" \"Skeet\" is a slang term for \"to ejaculate,\" which could be a reference to a \"happy ending,\" a practice famous in shady massage parlors (often staffed almost exclusively with Asian women) where the masseuse ends the session by giving the client a hand job. It also of course refers to skeet or clay pigeon shooting, an activity which many yacht owners actually participate in on their boats. Archer is likely referring to the former meaning, and Lana referring to the latter.\n\nAfter listening to Skorpio's speech, Lana and Archer exchange a glance and brush the tip of their noses. This is a reference to the movie The Sting in which the main characters used this gesture to communicate a mutual understanding.\n\nBartleby, the Scrivener is a reference to the short story by Herman Melville, in which the title character started each sentence with \"I would prefer not to,\" seeking existential isolation.\n\nWhen Archer pulls out the grenade, Lana asks where it came from. Archer responds, \"hanging from the lampshade\". \"Lampshade hanging\" is a term which means \"pointing out an implausible element of a story\".\n\nWhile on the boat with Nikolai Jakov, Malory recalls their meeting under \"the Bridge of Spies\". This is a reference to the Glienicke Bridge outside the city of Potsdam, near Berlin, Germany. After the Second World War, allied forces used the bridge as an artery between their territory in West Berlin and other diplomatic posts in Potsdam. During the 1960's and 80's, the bridge was used for several high profile prisoner exchanges. This continues the theme of Malory as a field operative during and immediately after WW II; other references are made to her intra- and post-war activities while working for the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA.\n\nEpisode 7 - Skytanic[]\n\nArcher refers to the Hindenburg airship disaster when he mimics someone saying \"Oh the humanity!\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgWHbpMVQ1U\n\nWhen Lana says to Malory \"Let me stay with you, we'll do the whole Oprah and Gayle thing.\" This is a reference to the social rumors of Oprah Winfrey and her best friend, Gayle King, being a lesbian couple.\n\nMalory makes a play on the ship's captain by cozying up to him quoting the opening phrase to verse 193 \"O Captain! My Captain!\" of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, which laments the death of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. This is probably in reference to the use of the phrase in the movie Dead Poets Society, in which English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) tells his students to refer to him thus if they feel daring.\n\nWhen Archer and Lana walk in on Captain Lammers, Lana shouts the Captain's name and Archer responds \"Nice read Velma...\" This is a reference to Scooby-Doo. When Scooby and the gang discover the identity of the villain toward the end of the episode, they often shout the name of the culprit. (Also, due to the suddenly hushed nature of the line \"Nice read, Velma...\", H. Jon Benjamin may actually have said this aside to Aisha Tyler during recording due to her corny tone of voice, and then the writers decided not to edit it out. (Unless they've changed set up, they don't record at the same time (sadly).\n\nWhen Malory and Lana complain about the absent bartender, Malory says, \"Guy sees an empty glass and all of a sudden he's Judge Crater.\" Joseph Crater, a New York City judge, got into a taxi on August 6, 1930 and was never seen again.\n\nArcher keeps referring to the Von Zeppelin Suite as the Led Zeppelin Suite, in reference to the English hard rock band of the 1970s. Led Zeppelin got their name by playing on the prediction (possibly by Keith Moon and/or John Entwistle) that the band would \"...go over like a lead balloon\". A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship most famous for the tragic explosion of the Hindenburg in 1937, depicted in a famed news photograph artistically stylized for the cover of the first Led Zeppelin album (the eponymous Led Zeppelin).\n\nThe name of the episode, Skytanic, is a reference to the famous RMS Titanic\n\nThe scene with Ray and the drones in the crisis room is an allusion to the movie, Apollo 13. In particular, Ray's vest is a reference to the special vests that Gene Kranz would get from his wife every mission.\n\nEpisode 8 - The Rock[]\n\nWhen preparing for their video call to Captain Regent Claudio, Archer mentions other \"Captains.\" One mentioned was Captain Kangaroo, a children's television show that was on CBS (1955-1984), which was created by and starred Bob Keeshan (1927-2004) as the Captain. He was so named due to the large pockets on his suit coat. Archer also references Captain Beefheart, the stage name of Don Glen Vilet, (1941-2010), the genre-breaking American musician and artist, as well as Cap'n Crunch, a cartoon mascot, of a late 18th century naval captain, used in the marketing of a Quaker Oats breakfast cereal of the same name.\n\nCyril calls Pam, \"Jesus H. Jones\", after noticing Pam is holding a camera, filming Cyril as he talks about being better than his father. This refers to Jesse Holman Jones who, in 1926, became the owner of the Houston Chronicle, and was also a publisher for the newspaper. The nickname \"Jesus H. Jones\" was given to him by Roosevelt when he was the Chairman of the RFC (Reconstruction Finance Committee), circa 1933. Or, possibly, it is a simple combination of the common profanity \"Jesus H. Christ\" with Jesus Jones, the British pop group best known for the song, \"Right Here, Right Now.\"\n\nArcher refers to Lana as \"Hey Eugene Debs\" when she is shocked that the strike is still going on. Eugene V. Debs was a union organizer and Socialist politician.\n\nWhile the workers of ISIS are discussing the pros and cons of unionizing, Cheryl states, in dissent, that she can remember what Malory did to the cleaning ladies when they similarly tried to organize. In the Flashback Cut that follows, Malory declines to get on the elevator with the cleaning ladies, which subsequently plummets down the shaft, presumably killing them all. Malory quips \"How's that for bread and roses?\" The slogan \"Bread and Roses\" originated in a speech given by US labor union leader and suffragette Rose Schneiderman. In an appeal for fair wages and better working environments she said, \"The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too.\" It inspired a poem by James Oppenheim and became the slogan for many unions, magazines, feminist organizations and various other pro-worker or pro-women endeavors.\n\nEpisode 9 - Job Offer[]\n\nArcher's fascination for the business card of Odin agent Barry Dillon, mentioning it being embossed, is most likely a reference to American Psycho and Patrick Bateman's obsession with the cards of his co-workers.\n\nAfter Woodhouse refuses to let Archer back into his ISIS financed apartment, he asks to Reggie the Lemur to \"Be a lad... Put on some Mingus?\" while he is preparing heroin for them. This is referring to Charles Mingus who was an American jazz musician and bandleader that was known as \"The Angry Man of Jazz\".\n\nFramboise is French for raspberry.\n\nFramboise is referred to by Archer as \"the Pelé of anal\", in a comparison to the Brazilian soccer player\n\nWhen Lana says to Cyril \"Baby, I am putting you in the corner,\" it's a reference to Dirty Dancing.\n\nPam says \"it looks like Jonestown in here\" upon seeing Malory, Cheryl, and Ray lying on the floor of the office passed out. This is a reference to the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project formed by the Peoples Temple cult. The site gained infamy when cult leader Jim Jones ordered the mass suicide/murder of the cult members, with disturbing images of 100s of people lying dead on the floor from drinking cyanide-laced 'Flavor-Aid'.\n\nEpisode 10 - Dial M for Mother[]\n\nThe episode title is a play on the 1954 Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder.\n\nWhen discussing his cheating history, Lana calls Cyril \"Rambone\"\n\nThe book that Malory is reading in bed, Greenmantle by John Buchan, is a spy novel which was one of the bases for Archer. Also, the first chapter of Greenmantle was chosen by Graham Greene for his 1957 anthology The Spy's Bedside Book making it all the more appropriate that Malory had read it before going to bed.\n\nThe fake funeral scene where a young Archer is saluting the memory of his fictitious father resembles a famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. (and his mother Jacqueline Kennedy) at the funeral of his father.\n\nWhen Cheryl returns Doctor Krieger's Creedence Clearwater Revival albums to him, Krieger says that \"Now a sad moon is on the rise\" referencing the hit song Bad Moon Rising.\n\nWhen Pam exclaims that she \"has so much love to give\" it is a reference to the 1999 film Magnolia.\n\nWhile Cyril is being interrogated by Lana about other women he has been with, it flashes back to a shot of Cyril seen through Ms. Archer's curled leg. This shot and the line \"Ms. Archer, you're trying seduce me, aren't you?\" subsequently delivered, reference a similar iconic shot and line from the 1967 film \"The Graduate.\"\n\nWhen Lana tells all the ISIS men that they can pay her to say they had sex with her, this could be a reference to the movie \"Easy A\", which came out the same year the episode did, 2010. In \"Easy A\", the main character exchanged the right for men to claim they had sex with her for their cash and gifts.\n\nWhen Cyril is shown in the bathroom, sitting in the stall, with only a white shirt and white boxers with a rifle next to him, he is shown loading a magazine of bullets while saying, \"7, 6, 2, Millimeter. Full, Metal, Jacket.\" which is a direct reference from Stanley Kubrik's 1987 film, titled \"Full Metal Jacket\", which is based on Gustav Hasford's novel \"The Short-Timers\". In Kubrik's film, the character Pvt. Pyle goes crazy near the end of his training on Parris Island and kills himself. He is seen in the bathroom wearing a white t-shirt and white boxers, with his rifle beside him. He loads the last round into his magazine while stating what he is loading, 7.62 Full Metal Jacket. The scene ends with Pyle killing his drill sergeant and then himself.\n\nWhen Archer is breaking into his mother's room with the cleaver while saying disturbing and insane things, it's a reference to \"The Shining\", another film by Stanley Kubrick. In Kubrick's horror film, the character Jack Torrance uses an ax to break down a door in a very similar way, sticks his face through, and then turns the knob, all while saying very disturbing things, in an attempt to kill his wife inside.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nEpisode 1 - Swiss Miss[]\n\nThe title itself is a reference to the hot cocoa brand of the same name.\n\nAfter requesting that her Gray Fox coat be sent over, Malory says if the economy worsens, she'll be forced to wear Nutria. Nutria are large, semi-aquatic rodents originally from South America. Introduced in the southern U.S. by fur ranchers in the 1930's, escaped animals have become established in many areas. Due to their destructive burrowing habits along streams and rivers, they are considered an invasive species.\n\nAnke and her constant seduction attempts may be a reference to the character Bibi Dahl in the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.\n\nWhen watching the shootout chase on the slopes, Ray believes it at first to be a Pink Floyd laser show.\n\nWhen in the room where Malory is talking about the kidnapping, a bank robbery is shown on screen, it looks eerily similar to the Hibernia bank robbery.\n\nWhen trying to identify one of the twin kidnappers, Archer says to Lana that the man was \"running around like Johnny Storm, a.k.a. The Human Torch\" after Archer set him on fire. Human Torch is superhero in one of the Marvel Comics\n\nDuring shooting in the woods on the snow scooters Archer says \"totally McQueen\" after destroying one of them. This is a reference to the actor Steve McQueen who was known for roles involving high-speed car chases while doing his own car stunts due to his background as a professional race car driver.\n\nThe recurring nickname gag used in the show pops up when Archer angrily refers to Ray and Lana as \"Bitch and Sundance\" which is a nod to \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" a Western film staring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The film is loosely based off of the famous outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid and their exploits.\n\nEpisode 2 - A Going Concern[]\n\nThe episode's title itself is ironic in relation to the story line, where \"a going concern\" is a business that functions without threat of liquidation or major restructuring for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhen Archer is telling Malory about finding Nikolai Jakov's mind-control chip in his brain, he uses the phrase \"drill, baby, drill,\" popularized by Alaska governor and one-time Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin as a response to questions about running mate John McCain's support for increased domestic extraction of fossil fuels over the expansion of renewable energy sources\n\nMalory's loss of her fortune probably referred to the Bernard Madoff Investment scandal. Madoff, who operated a wall street hedgefund, was convicted of operating an elaborate Ponzi scheme. Many of New York City's cultural elites and charitable foundations were adversely impacted as a result of investing with him. He was sentenced on June 29, 2009 to 150 years in federal prison and to pay restitution in the amount of $170 billion.\n\nAfter Archer says, \"my plan was to crowdsource a plan,\" Cheryl says with sarcasm, \"thanks Noam Chomsky,\" a reference to the man sometimes described as the \"father of modern linguistics.\" Here, it is a reference to Chomsky's espousal of libertarian socialism, a political philosophy which advocates aspects of crowdsourcing in government.\n\nWhen Archer slams the drawer to his mother's desk and Ray says, \"That's not a bumblebee, is it?\" - The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra had a vibrator made of a gourd with bees inside.\n\nRabbert Klein is a reference to Robert Klein, a comedian noted for a joke which involved his leg moving without his control.\n\nIn addition, the scene where Archer asks Cyril if Len Trexler can have Rabbert Klein, he says, \"Can we give Lennie the rabbit?\" This is a reference to the character Lennie from John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, a mentally challenged man who enjoys soft things, specifically rabbits. A similar reference is made in the following episode where Ray tells Lana to hand Seamus to Trinette, saying, \"Give her the rabbit, Lennie.\" This references the running gag of Lana's man-like hands and the fact that the Lennie in the book is prone to killing animals accidentally by crushing them with his powerful hands while trying to cuddle with them.\n\nThe Modified Ludovico treatment is a reference to A Clockwork Orange, where the British government experiments with reforming criminals using a similar form of aversion therapy called the Ludovico Technique.\n\nPopeye's line, \"Get the f*** out of my cleaners\", is a reference to a store owner in Adam Reed's previous show, 'Frisky Dingo'.\n\nWhen discussing the use of Krieger's \"magic breath strips\" to neutralize the ODIN troops Cyril states to Cheryl that she has a problem with LSD and Pam defends her by stating \"you're one to talk Pillbo Baggins\". This is a reference to Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit.\n\nEpisode 3 - Blood Test[]\n\nArcher is confronted by Trinette, Malory and wee baby Seamus and is asked \"Where are your manners?\" Archer replies, \"I'm sorry. I guess I skipped the Emily Post chapter on how to introduce your mother to a hooker.\" Emily Post (October 27, 1872 – September 25, 1960) was an American author famous for writing on etiquette.\n\nWhen Lana's holding wee baby Seamus, Gillette tells her to \"Give her the rabbit, Lennie\" a reference to Lennie from \"Of Mice and Men\" when Lennie, a mentally disabled, but physically strong character, loves touching soft animals like rabbits, but always accidentally kills them, while unaware of his own strength.\n\nGillette describes Lana holding wee baby Seamus as Tyson and dove, referring to a photo of Mike Tyson with a white dove .\n\nWhen Woodhouse says, \"Let's liven things up, Burroughs. Five grams of junk says I can shoot a piña colada off your wife's head,\" it is in reference to the famous author William S. Burroughs. In 1951, Burroughs shot and killed his common law wife Joan Vollmer in a drunken game of \"William Tell\" at a party above an American-owned Bounty Bar in Mexico City. The reference suggests that not only was Woodhouse responsible for Joan's death, but is one of many nods to his supposed homosexuality, being that Burroughs was also a homosexual. (According to Burroughs, he was not using Heroin at the time, but rather was drinking alcohol constantly.) (Note that the piña colada was not invented until 1954.)\n\nWoodhouse, upon realizing that he has injected all of his heroin into Cyril, and has none left to keep him from withdrawal, remarks \"it's going to be an itchy weekend,\" which is in reference to one of heroin's withdrawal side effects. During early stages of opiate withdrawal, patients often experience formication, also known as paresthesias. Formication is best described as ants crawling on the skin. This process is different than the itchiness frequently experienced during initial opiate use, which is caused by the release of histamines.\n\nWhen Gillette yells at Woodhouse to help him find the nutmeg so he can make Woodhouse some \"Malcolm X tea\", he is referring to a \"tea\" that, in his autobiography, Malcom X made using nutmeg and water. He claimed that the effect was equivalent to smoking three or four joints of \"reefer\". It was sometimes considered a means of substitution for \"real drugs\".\n\nMalory and Archer make an extended reference to various screen adaptations of Frankenstein; Malory tells Archer to replace his blood sample with someone else's blood, and Archer sarcastically replies that he'll \"just have Igor bring a villager up to [his] castle.\" When he then calls for \"Igor,\" his apartment door opens with a creak and Woodhouse answers with an extended \"Yeees?\", parodying Dr. Frankenstein's stereotypical b-movie hunchbacked assistant. Upon discovering the ISIS staff in Archer's apartment, Malory tells him to \"pick a villager.\"\n\nEpisode 4 - Pipeline Fever[]\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, Archer drinks Hurricanes while on the plane. This cocktail is very popular in their destination city, New Orleans.\n\nThe eco-terrorist targeting the pipeline is named Joshua Gray and uses the alias Gandalf. A central character in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien is a wizard named Gandalf, also known as \"Gandalf the Grey.\" When Archer and Lana meet Gray later in the episode, Archer calls him both \"Treebeard\" and \"Samwise.\" These are also the names of Tolkien characters.\n\nRight after taking the airboat, the man discovers that his dog, Annie (reference to Little Ann), is dead. He then mentions another dead dog and they cut to a scene of the tombstone which reads \"Old Dan\" and has a red fern growing beside it. This shot is a reference to the book Where The Red Fern Grows.\n\nUpon discovering Pam's effect on the new low-flow toilets in the men's room, Cyril asks, \"Have you no sense of decency?\", once famously asked by attorney Jospeh Welch to US Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy Hearings.\n\nAfter blowing up the motor on their airboat, towing Archer refers to Lana as African Queen , referring to a movie from 1951.\n\nMocking Lana's environmentalist sentiments, Archer refers to \"one lousy Lorax\", the protagonist in a 1971 allegorical book about environmental destruction by Dr. Suess (AKA Theodore Gisele).\n\nWhen aiming a revolver at Lana's head in a flashback to Lana's days as a radical activist Malory says \"dear, this is a .44 magnum\", alluding to Clint Eastwood's famous line from the 1971 film Dirty Harry in which he tells a suspect he is holding at gunpoint \"this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off\".\n\nWhen Lana faces down Malory at gunpoint in the flashback, Malory is impressed enough to offer her a job. Lana ends the story by saying \"Three weeks later I was in Tunisia, killing a different man\". This is a reference to Malory's beginning in espionage, revealed in Movie Star, in which a chance encounter with Bill Donovan, head of the OSS, leads her to a job three weeks later in Tunisia killing a man. Interestingly it appears that the reference is chronologically out of order within the series as Lana says \"killing a different man\", an apparent play off of Malory's story, given that she isn't killing anyone in the flashback\". It's more likely the comment is referring to \"the man\" that she was metaphorically killing, as she was protesting against established norms, and after meeting Malory she was killing a \"different man\" as in an actual person.\n\nIn a flashback, Lana appears with afro hair, which Archer describes as Lana being a baby of political activist Angela Davis and basketball player Sweet Lou Dunbar, known for their afro hairstyles.\n\nEpisode 5 - The Double Deuce[]\n\nAs Woodhouse reminisces, it shows Reggie playing piano while talking to a young Woodhouse.

It's later revealed he took scalps. Unable to cope with his grief, Woodhouse goes on a drug-fueled haze through the Orient on a merchant schooner, similarly to what Brad Pitt's Tristan does after his brother is killed in Legends of the Fall.\n\nWhen Cheryl is in the office spraying air freshener, Pam tells her to knock it off referring to her as 'Union Carbide'. This is a reference to the December 2nd, 1984 Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India where a methyl isocyanate gas leak killed thousands of local residents.\n\nBefore Reggie is shot, Woodhouse uses three matches to light Reggie's cigarette. This is a reference to the \"Three on a match\" superstition supposed by soldiers during WWI. The superstition (with some logic) goes that if three soldiers lit their cigarettes from the same match, it would give an enemy sniper enough time to target the group and the man who was third on the match would be shot. Since then, it has been considered bad luck for three people to share a light from the same match.\n\nWhen Woodhouse meets Malory in Tangiers, he is running a tavern called \"Reggie's Bar.\" The location, era, and name of the bar are an allusion to \"Rick's American Cafe\" from the film Casablanca. The North African location, presence of Nazi agents, and goal of getting to Lisbon, all mirror the plot of Casablanca.\n\nBefore Woodhouse tells the story of how he became a war hero, he picks up an orange and says: \"Alas, poor Reggie\". This is a reference to the play Hamlet (by William Shakespeare) where the titular character pics up a skull and says: \"Alas, poor Yorick\".\n\nEpisode 6 - Tragical History[]\n\nWhen Archer mockingly congratulates Cyril after losing the dart game, he refers to him as 'Chokely Carmichael'.

Always dropping calls.\" Archer's reply is \"Yeah, you were probably holding it wrong.\" is a reference to the iPhone 4 antenna problem and the reply given by Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, to an angry customer: \"Just avoid holding it in that way!\"\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to the play \"The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus\" by Christopher Marlowe.\n\nEpisode 7 - Movie Star[]\n\nWhile reading over the paper containing the plot of a movie that Malory was working on Cyril stops in mid-sentence asking, \"[A] spy comedy?... Because that has been done.\" A tongue in cheek reference to the show itself.\n\nThere is a reference to the children's television show Wishbone when Pam says, \"What's the story, neck bones?\" - In the Wishbone television series the theme song stated \"What's the story, Wishbone?\"\n\nWhen Malory says she will play the sexy spy who's 40, Cyril responds by asking if she does realize that there is a \"finite amount of Vaseline in the world\". This is a reference to the technique called \"vaselensing\". That is when Vaseline is smeared on the lens to give the appearance of vintage movies and often to make the actor look younger.\n\nThe mention of Joe Frazier drowning was a reference to the 1973 Superstars Swimming Heats, which also featured Johnny Bench in the next race. Video here.\n\nAfter reading Malory's script, Cyril says, \"Why not just make it a shot-for-shot remake of Mandingo?\" In addition, after asking a director about her script, he says he'll make the changes if they can call it \"Mandingo 2\". Mandingo is an offensive movie about slavery.\n\nWhen the actress says she wont be famous anymore while holding the sniper rifle, the temporarily paralyzed Archer replies, \"I 'unno Oswald was famous,\" referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy by the sniper Lee Harvey Oswald\n\nEpisode 8 - Stage Two[]\n\nCheryl tells Malory that she had cornhole league on Friday night.\n\nKrieger's line, \"That'll do, Pigley, that'll do,\" is a reference to the line at the end of Babe.\n\nWhen Archer faints, Malory says, \"You'd think he was half fainting goat.\" This is a reference to myotonic (or fainting) goats.\n\nThe nurse with whom Archer has slept goes by Rita, but Archer thinks her name is Peggy - both are nicknames for the name Margaret.\n\nArcher gave Rita the alias Chet Manley, which a reference to the boy who owned the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles before they were mutated.\n\nArcher wants Woodhouse to cook macrobiotic food which is claimed to be beneficial for people with cancer.\n\nThe flashback of Archer hitting Pam with a dolphin puppet is a reference to a flashback in the pilot episode.\n\nEpisode 9 - Placebo Effect[]\n\nArcher's cyclophosphimate turns out to be Zima. Zima is a carbonated alcoholic beverage that was discontinued in the US in 2008.\n\n\"Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war\" was a phrase spoken by Marc Antony in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Though technically spoken by Antony, when the line is said, Antony is imagining what Caesar would be saying if he were still alive. In a literal reading, \"dogs\" are the familiar animals, trained for warfare; \"havoc\" is a military order permitting the seizure of spoil after a victory and \"let slip\" is to release from the leash.\n\nAs Archer gears up to interrogate the Pharmacist, he equips a wrist mounted Sleeve Gun, professionally made, but still reminiscent of the iconic weapon of Travis Bickle in the film Taxi Driver.\n\nThe interrogation of the warehouse workers contains several references to Family Feud.\n\nArcher shooting the kneecaps of the Irish warehouse workers was a common practice used by the Irish Republican Army.\n\nArcher says his toenails are popping off like Pogs, a game that was popular in the early 1990s.\n\nIn English, Cyril and Krieger's lines translate to \"Why did you have to move to Brazil?!\" and \"To continue the fight of my leader! (pause) Shit!\" The leader in question was Adolph Hitler, and the implication is that Kreiger was a Nazi that relocated to Brazil after WWII and started a new life in hiding.\n\nArcher calls Lana Woodsy, the drug owl, referring probably to Woodsy Owl. Woodsy owl however serves as a mascot forUnited States Forest Service, promoting protection of environment, which leads to Archer making a mistake, which should not be much of a surprise, as he is high on weed. It is also likely that it is a reference to Owsley Stanley, a notable counter-culture figure who produced such tremendous quantities of high-purity LSD in San Francisco during the 1960s that his name is literally synonymous with the substance in the OED.\n\nThe store where the mob is playing cards is a reference to The Sopranos. Not only that, Steve Van Zandt, who was on The Sopranos, was also the member of the E-Street Band who wore a bandana.\n\nWhen Krieger and Cyril are arguing in the toilet, he is burning notes which say, \"Streng geheim,\" which means \"top secret/highly confidential.\"\n\nWhen Cyril goes to Malory with his concerns about Krieger, she tells him that after the war, Nazi scientists were being snatched up like hotcakes. This is a reference to the real life Operation Paperclip program created by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which recruited over 1,500 scientists, engineers and technicians of the German rocket program, among other scientific fields. Since some of the scientists had involvement with the Nazi party, a then newly created agency, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, sanitized the backgrounds with false employment histories and biographies.\n\nKrieger refers to the day his pet dobermans ate his father, a reference to the book \"The Boys from Brazil,\" where one of several clones of Adolf Hitler witnesses his father being eaten alive by the family dobermans.\n\nThe scene with Franny at the end is a Magnum, P.I. reference. Original. Cyril references this by suggesting Archer's film be called \"Magnum Pee-Yew.\"\n\nWhile watching the scene in \"Terms of En-Rampagement\" where Archer shoots Franny Delaney, Archer exclaims \"Booyakasha!\". This is the same exclamation that Sacha Baron Cohen's character Ali G is known for.\n\nPam's comment \"OK 'Clone Wars'\" to shut down Krieger after watching \"Terms of En-Rampagement\" is a multi-reference; on the surface layer, she's referring to the \"Clone Wars\" of the Star Wars universe, in which the soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic are all clones of Jango Fett, Boba Fett's father. Underneath, she's referring to the ongoing theme in this episode that Krieger is one of the \"Boys from Brazil ,\" that is, a clone of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe title \"Terms of En-Rampagement\" is itself a riff on the film title \"Terms of Endearment,\" though the two films bear no obvious resemblance.\n\nArcher's reference to \"Team Live-Badass\" is a play on Lance Armstrong's \"Livestrong\"\n\nEpisode 10 - El Secuestro[]\n\nArcher's reply is \"Tome (or tum) again?\" playing off the fact that \"Tunt\" rhymes with cunt and is only differentiated by the first letter.\n\nCheryl's ocelot is named Babou, which is the same name as Salvador Dalí's ocelot.\n\nArcher describes Babou's living conditions as Meowchwitz referring to Auschwitz German Nazi concentration camp.\n\nWhen Cyril accidentally shoots Bret at ISIS, Lana calls him \"Barney\". This is a likely a reference to Barney Fife from the Andy Griffith Show as he is generally clumsy with his pistol.\n\nWhile in the vault, Cheryl can be seen wearing a helmet with a black peace sign button a reference to the movie poster of Stanley Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket.\n\nMalory calls Bret, \"Mr. Bloodmobile.\" This is a song by band, They Might Be Giants.\n\nWhen Archer tells Cheryl \"Now you know how Babou feels\", she responds with \"crepuscular.\" This is a term for animals that are active at twilight, like ocelots.\n\nCheryl gets the acronym for the Irish Republican Army confused with the acronyms for an Individual Retirement Account and the Internal Revenue Service\n\nKneecapping, a punishment or torture in which the knee was injured or destroyed, was used by terrorist groups in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhen negotiating with the terrorists Archer believes them to be cyborgs. When they threaten him, he says they'd be violating the \"first law of robotics.\" A reference to the Robot-based stories by Isaac Asimov, including \"I, Robot,\" where the first law of Robotics is \"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\"\n\nAt the end of the episode, when Pam removes her shirt, a tattoo is revealed on her back. The text is the third verse of Lord Byron's \"The Destruction of Sennacherib.\"\n\nEpisode 11 - Jeu Monegasque[]\n\nThe whole episode is a semi-reference to the James Bond novel and films Casino Royale.\n\nThe names Bell, Bivens, and Devoe are used for the first, second, and third place racers at the Grand Prix at the beginning of the episode.

Lana Kane?\"\n\nLana (after Benoit says \"no\" to her question): \"And why 'no?!'\"\n\nBeniot (in response): \"It's the Grand Prix.\"\n\nLana (to the dealer at the casino): \"This imbecile (meaning Archer), he was playing?!\"\n\nThe dealer (in response): \"Until he lost three million dollars.\"\n\nLaChouffe (after finding what looks to be a blueberry muffin in the case instead of four million dollars, to his bodyguards): \"Perfidy! Kill them!\" then after the guards are all incapacitated: \"That's enough!\"\n\nLana (to one of the bound guards): \"Who robbed the safe?!\" (Benoit) \"When?!\" (Ten minutes?

Rudy walks into frame, turns, looks directly into the camera and then smiles before walking away.\n\nArcher says \"Thanks, Radar\" to the casino employee who brings him chips.

The actual line is \"40 oz. in my lap and it's freezin' my balls.\"\n\nWhen Malory finds out that Pam told everyone about the \"whipped cream incident\" she tells Pam she should have her \"flensed\". This is a technique that was used to remove the blubber of whales.\n\nThe scene where Archer is being interrogated by the KGB is a reference to the opening scene of the first episode Mole Hunt. The KGB agent interrogating Archer also looks like Krenshaw.\n\nThe quote from the KGB interrogator: \"I go drop kids off at pool\" is a euphemism for pooping.\n\nThe scene in which Archer and Barry jump from one fire escape to another is similar to a scene from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where the titular characters jump off a cliff into a river.

You can try to find it on the Internet, but remember what has been seen cannot be unseen.\n\nIn Krieger's lab, he has buckets on the shelf of 3/4 copper, rivets, and burrs which are likely a phallic reference.\n\nBilbo replies to Archer, \"Does one ring rule them all?\" which is a reference to Lord of the Rings. Archer solidifies the reference by saying not to engage him or it will be \"all orcs and Gollums and Balrogs.\"\n\nBarry's lines in the video feed in the KGB base are the lines said by the bionic man at the start of The Six Million Dollar Man.\n\nBarry opening his chest to reveal he has become a cyborg is similar to how Dr. Quinn from Sealab 2021 revealed the same information to his colleagues in the pilot episode.\n\nBarry from this point forward exclusively wears a track suit reminiscent of The Six Million Dollar Man.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nEpisode 1 - Heart of Archness: Part I[]\n\nThe last words of the Pirate Captain, \"What the hell damn guy!\" is a frequently used phrase in Frisky Dingo, Adam Reed's show prior to Archer.\n\nArcher's stating that his tinnitus is so bad that he has to sleep with a fan on is also a reference to Frisky Dingo.\n\nThe title of the three-part series \"Heart of Archness\" is a reference to the novel by Joseph Conrad, \"Heart of Darkness\" upon which the movie \"Apocalypse Now\" was based.\n\nNot really a reference, but when the Pirate Captain is talking to Archer about his ''Wealth'' the sign with the IFPs (International Flags and Pennants) over his shoulder say ''Katie Sucks''.\n\nEpisode 2 - Heart of Archness: Part II[]\n\nArcher's line \"King, exactly, and unless you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions\"... is a reference to the movie Scorpion King.\n\n\"King, exactly, and unless you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions...\" could also be a reference to the Boo Box in the movie Hook.

She is referencing the theme park \"Six Flags Over Texas\" (the start of the Six Flags theme park chain) and the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant where the Chernobyl disaster occurred.\n\nA holler is an Appalachian term for a type of valley.\n\nCheryl asks, \"What's my dowry? Tetanus?\" A dowry is the money, goods, or estate that a woman brings to a marriage. Since she asks what she will be given, she is actually referring to the bride price.\n\nAfter killing the rooster, Cheryl and Ray reference Kenny Rogers Roasters, a chicken restaurant that was founded by country musician Kenny Rogers and former Kentucky governor John Y. Brown, Jr.\n\nRandy and Janelle Gillette have an open marriage, meaning they engage in extramarital sexual relationships, without this being regarded as infidelity.\n\nGenesis 38:8 reads \"Then Judah said to Onan, 'Sleep with your brother’s wife [i.e. widow] and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother'\", which with some extreme rules lawyering can be viewed as a directive to sleep with your siblings' spouses. Onan, in defiance of this command, chooses to spill his seed upon the earth before sleeping with his brother's wife. It is thus taken as a Biblical prohibition against masturbation.\n\nRay had a diary with Miss Piggy, a character from The Muppet Show, on it.\n\nRay wore Capezio dancewear, a manufacturer of dance shoes, apparel and accessories, in high school.\n\nRandy mentions making money by \"digging sang\". This refers to the lucrative poaching of a variety of wild ginseng that grows in the Appalachian region.[1][2]\n\nArcher calls the dead rooster \"Dan Lather,\" a play on the name of the American journalist and the former news anchor for the CBS Evening News Dan Rather.\n\nThe gunfight scene is reminiscent of the last gunfight scene in the 1976 Western film The Outlaw Josey Wales, which starred Clint Eastwood. In particular, Randy's instruction to Cheryl -- that if anyone is shot she should take a red-hot fireplace poker and \"slap iron to it\" -- is a direct quote from Clint Eastwood's character.\n\nThe title of the episode is a nod to the fellow FX series Justified season 2 finale \"Bloody Harlan,\" which also had marijuana farmers in a shoot out with police, as well as the Harlan County War, colloquially Bloody Harlan, a series of coal mining-related skirmishes, executions, bombings, and strikes (both attempted and realized) that took place in Harlan County, Kentucky during the 1930s.\n\nEpisode 10 - Crossing Over[]\n\nThe dead person lying on the pool table and the Wake at a bar is a reference to the HBO show \"The Wire.\"\n\nPam makes a reference to Adam \"Pacman\" Jones, a football player suspended for improper conduct in a strip club.\n\nPam says she is bound up \"tighter than Dick's Hatband\", a reference to Oliver Cromwell's son Richard Cromwell.\n\nJakov makes a reference to Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\" with the quote \"Et tu, Brute?\"\n\nMalory says there's a funny Marmaduke comic on the fridge at the safehouse.\n\nChupacabra is a South American mythical creature which is basically a goat vampire.\n\nCheryl mentions Richie Havens as the bearded man you meet after you die.\n\nArcher's line about being a \"sinner in the hands of an angry God\" references a sermon by Jonathan Edwards, a prominent Puritan minister of the 18th century. The prayer that follows is a parody of the Ave Maria, a traditional Catholic prayer for intercession first written in this format in 1495 in Girolamo Savonarola's \"Esposizione sopra l’Ave Maria.\"\n\nPam says Archer was \"just pushing rope\". This refers to having sexual intercourse with a limp/exhausted penis.\n\nEpisode 11 - Skin Game[]\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to the play The Skin Game or the 1971 film Skin Game.\n\nKrieger says that he lives in a \"transitional neighborhood\". This is the term used in the Concentric zone model (AKA the Burgess model) for an area of a city that experiences high population turnover, has few homeowners, dilapidated infrastructure, is \"mixed use\", and experiences generally high rates of crime, regardless of the racial makeup of the population. This theory refuted the previous claims that criminal behavior was genetic, biological, or generationally transmitted.\n\nArcher says he likes the \"non-Midnight Cowboy\" kind of surprise fellatio, referring to the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy, which included an instance of man-on-man fellatio.\n\nArcher says he cannot look at a \"Doctor Moreau pig-baby,\" referring to Doctor Moreau of the H. G. Wells novel The Island of Doctor Moreau. Doctor Moreau created human-like beings out of animals.\n\nArcher's mention of \"sangria\" is not (or not only) in reference to the drink of the same name; it is Portuguese for \"bloodletting\".\n\nArcher says Krieger can play \"YYZ,\" an instrumental rock piece by the Canadian rock band Rush.\n\nKatya says that Archer woke her like the prince of the fairy tale \"Snow White.\"\n\nPam mentions YYZ again and Krieger replies that \"Neil Peart stands alone,\" referring the drummer for the aforementioned band Rush. As with Archer, Krieger corrects Pam's pronunciation of the \"Z\" as \"zee\" (the American pronunciation), and insists on it being pronounced as \"zed\", the Canadian pronunciation.\n\nWhen Katya tries to evade questions about being a cyborg, Pam says, \"Way to bury the lede!\" This means to begin a story with details of secondary importance, thus delaying the most important part of the story. \"Lede\" is a journalism term for introductory part of a news story.\n\nArcher mentions Horace Greeley, the founder of the New York Tribune.\n\nCheryl says that Lana wants to \"screw affirmative action\" by hiring Katya.\n\nPam asks Katya if she thinks RoboCop is a pro or a con.\n\nConfusing the two computer hardware acronyms, Archer tells Katya not to waste the ROM or RAM thinking about Malory.\n\nKatia then says \"Because I did not ask to be this way.\" about her being turned into a cyborg, which is an allusion to the game \"Deus Ex\"\n\nArcher's ping-pong paddle is seen on his bed next to his and Katya's clothing.\n\nWhen Archer is having difficulty in bed, Katya tells him that he's pushing rope; Pam told him the same thing at the end of the previous episode.\n\nArcher said he spent hours doing Yogic breathing.\n\nWhile talking about his testicles, Archer and Katya reference cranbaisins and Craisins.\n\nWoodhouse mentions Sopwith Camels, a World War I fighter plane.\n\nWoodhouse offers to clean Katya's detachable vagina and says he'll have it \"looking Bristol\"; this is a reference to the old British naval phrase of having things looking \"shipshape and Bristol fashion\", meaning tidy and neat.\n\nLana says to understand Archer you would need to have a threesome with Oedipus and Sigmund Freud, referring to the psychoanalytic theory of an Oedipus complex.\n\nFrank Sinatra gave Cyril's grandfather a bottle of Glengoolie Blue, an in-universe high-end scotch. Glengoolie Blue may be a reference to the Glenfiddich brand.\n\nArcher asks if Cyril's tie was Peter Lawford's. Cyril later says that his mug was in fact Peter Lawford's.\n\nCheryl repeats the misconception that the Chinese word for \"crisis\" and \"opportunity\" are the same word.\n\nCheryl mentions they make her fold paper cranes in the hospital.\n\nRay mentioned The Snug, a bar in New York City.\n\nArcher calls Krieger \"Ira Flatow from Newton's Apple.\" Ira Flatow was the first host of the PBS education television program Newton's Apple and is currently the host of NPR's Science Friday.\n\nCheryl repeatedly says \"Polo\" when the lights are out. This is the reply given in the game Marco Polo.\n\nMalory mentions \"that Electrolux,\" referring to the time Archer got his penis stuck in a vacuum cleaner.\n\nThe end of the episode, when Barry and Katya ride off on the bus, is a reference to the end of the film The Graduate, when Elaine and Benjamin ride off on a bus.\n\nEpisode 12 - Space Race: Part I[]\n\nAt the end of his mayday transmission, Commander Kellogg yells, \"Croatoan\" - a word which was carved into a fence post of the abandoned Roanoke Colony, and one of the few clues left behind when the colonists disappeared in the 1580s.\n\nAs Archer is being briefed he makes an attempt to have the major say \"danger zone\".\n\nAfter crashing the training machine Archer yells \"Happy, Cyril? You just destroyed Alderaan!\" Alderaan is a planet from Star Wars which was destroyed by the Death Star.\n\nArcher asks Commander Drake if he's trying to get his mother into the \"Million Mile High Club\"; people who have had sex in commercial airplanes are said to be a part of the Mile High Club.\n\nArcher says that the a bar aboard the Horizon could also be called a Cantina, a reference to the famous \"Cantina Scene\" In Star Wars Episode Four, in which Luke and Obi-Wan meet Han Solo in a seedy bar.\n\nArcher asks if the mutineers will be armed with slide-rules and Tang (a drink associated with NASA and space flight).\n\nThe M-41 Mark Two plasma rifle used by the ISA bears a striking resemblance in both name and appearance to the M41A Pulse Rifle from the film Aliens, albeit with the magazine placed in a bullpup configuration.\n\nArcher's armor features a skull and crossbones design on the chest almost identical to that on the armor worn by Private Hudson in Aliens. It also has a love-knot over the heart, again like Hudson in the film.\n\nJettisoning Pam and Cheryl into space due to them overweighing the shuttle may be a reference to the short story \"The Cold Equations\" by Tom Godwin. It may also be a reference to the series Lost In Space where Dr. Smith stows aboard the Jupiter II and his extra weight throws the ship off course. [5]\n\nWhen Archer is locked in the cargo hold, the baseball and glove is a reference to Steve McQueen's role in The Great Escape. In the movie, whenever McQueen's character, Hilts, was sent to \"the cooler\" or solitary, he would ricochet a baseball off the floor and wall over and over again. This also takes place in the final scene of the movie.\n\nDrake tells Lana to use Dramamine, the brand name of the motion sickness relief drug Dimenhydrinate.\n\nWhen the gang first encounters the mutineers, Ray yelling \"get some!\" is a reference to the first helicopter ride in Full Metal Jacket where the gunner is shooting women and children.\n\nCheryl mentions sixteenth-century female Irish pirate Gráinne O'Malley\n\nArcher calls the new cyborg version of Katya \"R2-Double-D2\", a portmanteau of the droid R2D2 from Star Wars and double-D bra size.\n\nWhile fighting their way onto the ship, Ray says Lana is \"like a dog in a station wagon\". This may be a reference to the debate over the safety of Mitt Romney's dog being transported in a crate on top of their station wagon on a family vacation. [6]\n\nArcher's ping-pong paddle can once again be seen after sex with Pam, this time floating around with their clothes.\n\n\"Archer Was Here\" is carved into the wall of the holding cell, as is \"So Was Pam\". This may be a reference to the halfway house at the end of The Shawshank Redemption, where \"Brooks Was Here\" and later \"So Was Red\" is carved.\n\nAfter they have sex, Pam mentions MOAB (Mouth On Ass and Balls) and Archer doesn't want to hear what it stand for out loud.\n\nWhen Commander Kellogg says \"Tony?\" when he is surprised to see Commander Drake, Archer mockingly repeats \"Tony\" in a high-pitched voice. It's possible that he is purposely conflating their names in reference to Tony the Tiger , the mascot for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes.\n\nCharles Benedict Davenport (June 1, 1866 – February 18, 1944) was a prominent American eugenicist and biologist. He was one of the leaders of the American eugenics movement.\n\nEpisode 13 - Space Race: Part II[]\n\nA brood sow is a female pig used for mating.\n\nCommander Drake compliments Lana's morphology.\n\n\"Caress of Krieger\" artwork on Krieger's van is a reference to the 3rd album of the band Rush \"Caress of Steel.\"\n\nCheryl's \"dress\" is a tribute to the infamous Swan Dress worn by Bjork at the Academy Awards in 2001.\n\nWhen Drake says he plans to make Archer, Cyril, and Ray \"involuntary laborers\" (slaves), Archer tells him to \"kiss three fifths of my ass\", a reference to the fact that during slavery in the US, slaves were only considered three fifths of a person for the purposes of the population count in the census. A similar reference is also made in Heart of Archness: Part III.\n\nArcher's request for beers during their labor may be a reference to the famous \"Beers on the Roof\" scene from the 1994 film \"The Shawshank Redemption\".\n\nPam's line \"Boring conversation anyway\", followed by her smashing of the radio is a direct reference to Han Solo's radio conversation in the cell block of Death Star 1 during Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.\n\nGeorge Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" is referenced numerous times throughout the episode, including by the ISIS agents and by the crew of the Space Station, referring to the state of affairs there.\n\nA joke is made that the pressure door is made of an alloy of adamantium and mithril; adamantium is a fictional indestructible metal alloy of which Wolverine's skeleton and bone claws are constructed, and mithril is the dwarven metal in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.\n\nWhen Ms. Archer tells Cheryl to \"name a place\", Cheryl responds with \"Lidsville\". Lidsville is Sid and Marty Krofft's third television show following H.R. Pufnstuf (1969) and The Bugaloos (1970). However, the correlation between the show (Archer) and Lidsville has yet to be deduced.\n\nBarry calls Archer over the intercom saying “Archer, come out to play-ay” while clinking three bottles, a reference to The Warriors (1979) character Luther and the same line.\n\nBarry's offer that Archer may fight him using a robotic exoskeleton is a reference to the final fight scene of the movie Aliens, and the robotic exoskeleton looks a lot like the one in Aliens.\n\nDrake's henchman calling the airlock door \"Dwarven technology\" is a reference to the Dwarven race in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth, as evidenced by the other comment that the door is made of [an alloy of adamantium and] mithril, a fictional metal that is \"as light as a feather, but hard as dragon scales\".\n\nBarry tapping the beer bottles together and saying \"Archer, come out and play\" is a reference to The Warriors.\n\nAs Barry is flying to the space station he sings \"Going to outer space, to shoot that dick-bag in his face,\" to the tune of \"Fly Me to the Moon\", a song famously sung by Frank Sinatra.\n\nBarry also sings modified lyrics from the song \"Mr. Roboto\" by the band Styx.\n\nStar Wars is referenced numerous times throughout the episode. Cyril repeats \"almost there\" as the space shuttle comes in for a landing, similar to the line from Star Wars: A New Hope spoken by Garven Dreis as he attempted and failed his attack on the Death Star. Archer says that he left his \"lightsaber in [his] other space pants.\" Pam blows up the com on the shuttle, saying that \"It was a boring conversation anyway,\" a reference to Han Solo's similar line. Lana blasts open a hatch in the side of the corridor into what is presumably a garbage compartment, as Princess Leia does in the detention center of the Death Star. The helmet Barry wears in his space ship is similar to those worn by X-Wing pilots. Archer asks if Cyril can die after he disables the tractor beam, referencing the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Lastly, a \"wipe\" style transition is used just before the crash landing near the end, a type of transition famously used in Star Wars films.\n\nThe scene where the ISIS crew escapes from the holding cell uses three prominent Sealab 2021 lines: \"Ah, my eye\", \"Ah, my other eye\", and \"Security breach, Pod 6\".\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nEpisode 1 - Fugue and Riffs[]\n\nThe episode title is a reference to two things: (1) the jazz composition \"Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs\" by Leonard Bernstein and (2) a fugue state, alluding to Archer's amnesia.\n\nThe beginning of this episode contains a very close reference to a scene in the movie A History of Violence when the protagonist in the film saves his diner from a robbery\n\nThe episode contains a crossover with Fox's animated series, Bob's Burgers, the protagonist of which is voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.\n\nBob's wife, Linda, and three children (Gene, Tina, and Louise) all appear in the opening sequence, but only Linda (voiced by John Roberts) speaks. Interestingly, Eugene Mirman (the voice of Gene Belcher) and Kristen Schaal (Louise) guest-star in the season's two-part finale.\n\nIn \"Bob's Burgers,\" new \"burgers of the week\" are devised with little puns for their names and those of their ingredients. The \"Burger of the Week\" at the beginning of this episode was the \"Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger with Manning Coleslaw.\" This was a reference to Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon of the Foreign Office, the protagonist of a series of spy novels written by the British authors \"Manning Coles\". The plot of one such novel involves Hambledon losing his memory and assuming a different identity.\n\nArcher is referred to as \"Ike Turner\" by Linda, referring to the accusations of spousal abuse leveled at Ike by his former wife Tina Turner.\n\nWhen discussing how to cure Archer's amnesia, Krieger says \"This isn't the Flintstones, you can't just hit him over the head with a frying pan!\" in reference to an episode of The Flintstones where this happens to Fred Flinstone, who wakes up believing himself to be a wealthy socialite.\n\nArcher repeatedly references The Shazam/Isis Hour, its star Michael Gray, and Billy Batson; The first half hour was about Shazam and Captain Marvel. Shazam the wizard granted powers to the child Billy Batson, enabling him to yell SHAZAM! (Archer also yells this while throwing a molotov cocktail) to turn into the superhero Captain Marvel. Isis was an ancient Egyptian superheroine resurrected in the body of a schoolteacher.\n\nArcher, who still believes himself to be Bob, describes his hand-to-hand combat skills as Chuck Norris-esque.\n\nYet another reference to Lana's large hands: Archer calls them Hulk-hands, and then She-Hulk hands, and then calls Lana Jennifer Walters, the alter-ego of She-Hulk.\n\nArcher yells \"Jesus Mary and Joseph Stalin!\" at the KGB agents, which is a portmanteau of the exclamation Jesus Mary and Joseph and Joseph Stalin.\n\nAs proof that Archer has regained his memory, he fashions a lacrosse stick (his favourite sport) out of a mop handle and an ice scoop, using it lob Molotov cocktails at the KGB agents.\n\nMalory calls Ray Ironside, which was a show about a wheelbound Chief of Detectives named Robert T. Ironside.\n\nThe Hamilton Beach DrinkMaster series is considered classic equipment with a long heritage. Apparently Archer can discern the model (in this case a 727) simply by hearing the motor.\n\nDuring their fight with the KGB, there is a callback to the events in Space Race: Part II, as once again Archer renders Lana topless, destroys her clothes, and uses stickers from the Old Buncombe Bourbon bottles as pasties when she complains. She corrects him when he says he is experiencing déjà vu because he is in reality recovering a memory of this past event.\n\nArcher (as Bob) later devises an \"Émile Gorgonzola burger with J'accusecumbers.\" Émile Zola was a famous French writer who was prosecuted for having published a letter entitled \"J'accuse\" accusing the French government of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe beginning sequence of the episode is almost directly from the film, \"A History of Violence\", but is debatable.\n\nWhen Malory hits Archer with her purse, he asks her \"what's in there, spa buckles?\" which is a callback to a similar line in the first episode of the series.\n\nEpisode 2 - The Wind Cries Mary[]\n\nThe title of this episode comes from the Jimi Hendrix song of the same name, said to be inspired by the potential loss of his then girlfriend. Mary, like Nancy, is also archaic slang for \"homosexual.\"\n\nMalory lists six famous New York City restaurants:\n\nLe Cirque\n\nLutèce\n\nElaine's (which is now closed)\n\n21\n\nRussian Tea Room\n\nThe Palm\n\nLana references the duck test.\n\nWhen asked how Lucas could have disappeared, Archer said \"Paging Dr. Cooper! Dr. D. B. Cooper!\" D. B. Cooper is a man who famously mysteriously disappeared with a case full of money after parachuting from a hijacked plane.\n\nJustified, an FX series that stars Timothy Olyphant (voice actor of Lucas), had just recently introduced an ongoing \"D.B. Cooper-esque\" mystery as one of the foundations of its fourth season in its season premiere, which originally aired just a couple of weeks prior to this episode of Archer.\n\nMalory saying \"gay as a tangerine\" is a reference to the animated series Frisky Dingo,[3] a show co-created by Adam Reed.\n\nPam calls ISIS a \"chickenshit outfit\"; this is a possible nod to the movie Aliens (which was also referenced in the two Space Race episodes) when the character Hudson asks \"How do I get outta this chickenshit outfit?\"\n\nRay tracks Archer's cell phone to a house north of Bennington, Vermont, which he correctly assumes to be a bed and breakfast. Vermont is famous for them, and they are often made from converted houses. Malory retorts \"You should know,\" which, in addition to the plot, is a reference to a stereotype about homosexuals and these types of establishments.\n\nLana says Lucas would used his credit card at \"roughtrade.net\", referring to the term \"rough trade,\" a slang term for a masculine working class man who has sex with men (sometimes as a male prostitute).\n\nArcher responds by saying he'll bring in Kenny Loggins to play an acoustic set while he slaps some sense into Lana. Kenny Loggins recorded and released the frequently referenced song \"Danger Zone\".\n\nArcher drops a microphone to gloat about being right about Lucas' sexual orientation. The act of dropping a microphone for special emphasis or triumph originated in the 1980s and has become popular since 2007.[4]\n\nPam drops the microphone as well, but out of anger, not triumph.\n\nLucas says they used to call Lana \"Shirley Temper,\" a play on the name of the famous child actress Shirley Temple.\n\nUpon finding Cyril's discarded clothing, Archer reassures himself that Predator (from the science fiction franchise Predator) only hunts in tropical jungles.\n\nLana uses her combat knife to cut Cyril's tank top and orders him to remove his briefs, saying \"Get naked. Panties, too.\" This is a reference to the famous rape scene in the film \"Deliverance\".\n\nCyril complains about Lana calling his briefs \"panties,\" saying \"They're called briefs.\" Her reply, \"Yeah. You're a grown man.\" is a reference to a stereotype that young boys wear briefs and grown men wear boxers.\n\nArcher says he hopes Lana was not firing at an Ent, a race of beings in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world Middle-earth who closely resemble trees.\n\nArcher continues that the last thing we need is an Entmoot. Lucas uses the same reference saying Lana ditched Cyril for an Entmoot.\n\nArcher then wonders if he is gay for Tolkien.\n\nLucas says he played music by Al Green as he raped Archer.\n\nWhen Archer realizes he has been drugged by Lucas, he asks why Lucas was not affected by the wine. Lucas replies, \"Coated the inside of the glass.\" This is likely a nod to the guest-starring Olyphant's other show, Justified, in which two characters were fatally poisoned in the same way.\n\nEpisode 3 - Legs[]\n\nCheryl says a cyborg would need to be \"pretty smart to fool the ol' Voight-Kampff machine.\" This references the Voight-Kampff machine from the film Blade Runner which is used to determine if someone is a replicant (genetically engineered organic robot).\n\nCheryl refers to Rodney as \"Magnum P.U.\", a reference to the television series Magnum, P.I..\n\nArcher mentions \"Space Bot\" a few times, referring to the robotic exoskeleton from Space Race.\n\nArcher tells Cyril that \"Grover Cleveland wants his watch back. He left two non-consecutive messages,\" referring to the former U.S. president Grover Cleveland who had two non-consecutive terms as president.\n\nOne of the headlines in the newspaper Ron is reading (simply called \"The Paper\") is \"Tragedy Feared On Space Station\". Two episodes later in Viscous Coupling, We see that Barry has murdered all the personnel aboard the station.\n\nAnother headline reads \"Biker Gangs Terrorize Upstate New York\", referring to the biker gangs that will attack Ron and Archer in the next episode Midnight Ron.\n\nConway's replacement hand is apparently a visual reference to Luke Skywalker's similar artificial hand.\n\nArcher says finding Brett is like being the Warren Commission, which was established to find facts on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy.\n\nArcher references one of the theories the commission set forth is the single bullet theory (AKA the magic bullet theory) which says that a single bullet hit both JFK and John Connally by ricocheting.\n\nArcher says Krieger is making a \"gay Terminator,\" referencing the film The Terminator.\n\nKrieger says his lab door was taken from the Graf Spee, a German WWII cruiser.\n\nMalory laments getting blood on her Delman shoes.\n\nAfter the explosion, Cheryl rants at Archer about \"smashing the defense grid so Skynet...\". This is a reference to the film The Terminator where the main antagonist Skynet is destroyed by smashing the defense grid.\n\nBefore using the grappling hook, Archer refers to the third film in the Terminator series, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\n\nWhile in the air ducts, Archer makes a reference to the film Maximum Overdrive.\n\nWhen Archer falls out of the air ducts, he quotes Arnold Schwarzenegger's character's line from the film The Terminator.\n\nEpisode 4 - Midnight Ron[]\n\nThe episode title is a play on the title of the 1988 film Midnight Run.\n\nRon Cadillac is a reference to Martin “Kaz” Kazinsky from the series Kaz.[5]\n\nMalory reminds Ron that they have plans to see Carmen at the Met.\n\nThe Infinite Regress problem is referenced when Malory says of the ISIS staff, \"it is just idiots all the way down.\" The usual formulation reads, \"it's turtles all the way down.\"\n\nCheryl is making paper dolls in this episode in the shape of a Human Centipede, albeit with all females.\n\nWhile in Montreal, some people use the Quebec French curse word tabernak.\n\nArcher tells a person waiting for the phone to shut his \"poutine hole\", referring to the Quebec dish poutine.\n\nArcher references the cult classic horror movie \"C.H.U.D.\" in this episode. The C.H.U.D.s in the film live in the New York City sewers.\n\nThe same reference was made in Frisky Dingo when the two protagonists find themselves in a sewer.\n\nRon counters this with the urban legend of alligators in the New York City sewers, which gives Archer horrifying visions of said alligators breaking through the toilet while he is using it and attacking him.\n\nArcher makes reference to the butterfly effect, during of which he describes a talking rhino, which is likely a wink to the Lying Rhino from the 2007 film The Ten, who H. Jon Benjamin, the voice of Archer, voices.\n\nStranded on the highway, Archer suggests that no one will trust him and Ron enough to pick them up because they look like \"The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man,\" a story of an older con man and his younger partner traveling together.\n\nIn the back of the truck when Archer start stealing beer, Ron monologue about the average salt of the earth American. It a tribute to Russ Meyer 70s sexploitation director.\n\nThe scene is also a visual reference to Trains, Planes, and Automobiles, when Steve Martin and John Candy's characters find themselves in the back of a milk truck. In the movie the next form of transportation is also a train.\n\nAfter hearing of Ron's theft of the Sherman tank, Archer calls Ron \"Master P\". This is a reference to the logo of Master P's record company No Limit Records, which features a tank.\n\nThe cross-dressing trucker is modeled after celebrity chef Kevin Gillespie.[5]\n\nThe trucker has a tattoo on his right arm that says \"Offshore Drilling\". Possibly a reference to a former gay bar in Myrtle Beach.\n\nArcher's exclamation \"Aw, Fat Mike, too?\" upon hearing Fat Mike had been arrested, is a line uttered by Xander Crews on hearing he had just killed Fat Mike, an Xtacle in the show \"Frisky Dingo.\". The character of Xander Crews was likewise in many ways a prototype for Archer.\n\nArcher says the one old guy with a club is \"kicking it Bedrock style\", referring to Bedrock from the cartoon The Flintstones.\n\nRon calls one of the bikers who attack them \"C. W. McCall-girl.\" C. W. McCall is an outlaw country singer.\n\nArcher says his gun is not a phaser, referring to the Star Trek weapon.\n\nThe gypsy woman described the encounter as \"an alternate universe where John Waters directed \"The Road Warrior.\" Waters is known for his odd films featuring freaky, often transgendered or gay, characters. \"The Road Warrior\" was a post-apocalyptic film in which gangs with crazy outfits and improvised weapons, not unlike the bikers in this episode, are the main antagonists.\n\nIn the flashback, Cheryl tells Archer he needs to \"make it rain\". Pam yells \"Pac-Man Jones,\" in reference to the practice of \"making it rain\" by throwing money in the air.\n\nArcher makes a comparison between Ron and Master P, exhorting him to \"make it rain.\"\n\nWhen Ron says Archer hates him because he wants Malory to himself, he says \"Paging Dr. Bates, Dr. Norman Bates\". This is a reference to the novel Psycho, in which a man named Norman Bates falls in love with his mother. Bates kills his mother, her lover, and keeps his mother's corpse in his house.\n\nArcher mentions the parachute fall when he throws the men out of the train car.\n\nArcher mentioned a hobo term \"bulls\", which means railroad security guard.[6]\n\nThe opera Malory and Ron attend is Carmen. The aria playing is Habanera.\n\nEpisode 5 - Viscous Coupling[]\n\nThe episode title references viscous coupling units, alluding to the cyborgs.\n\nArcher running around back and forth between ISIS and Katya's apartment, especially the way he slides past the door, is a reference to the scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off in which the titular character races home before his parents arrive.\n\nWhen Archer mistakenly believes Lana hears him from an incredible distance to her office, he says \"Who are you, Jaime Sommers?\" Jaime Sommers is the Bionic Woman.\n\nWhen referring to his plans for the night, Krieger makes a reference to The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, arguably the most famous shunga. The reference is repeated with the magazines Cyril and Ray begin to read in the bathroom and later when they both wake up to find an octopus in the toilet.\n\nWhen questioning Archer's reasoning behind helping Barry, Pam compares Barry being trapped in space to General Zod from the Superman series.\n\nArcher calls Krieger Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and prominent public figure.\n\nEpisode 6 - Once Bitten[]\n\nThe episode title alludes to the English idiom \"once bitten, twice shy.\"\n\nArcher's exclamation \"The lambs are screaming!\" is a reference to the same line in film The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nRay admits that his \"go-to\" for sexual fantasies is Canadian actor Lorne Greene, specifically in his role as the widowed rancher Ben \"Pa\" Cartwright in the 1960s Western serial, Bonanza. Greene's older, paternal character was voted \"Television's #2 Favorite Dad\" in a 2007 TV Guide survey, which, together with Ray's story earlier in the same episode about his father forcing him to kill a bear and then slapping him repeatedly until he stopped crying enough to eat part of its heart, adds a typically Archer Oedipal note to the attraction.\n\nLana's clomping is compared to that of an AT-AT from The Empire Strikes Back by Pam and Cheryl.\n\nArcher's hallucination in which he sees alligators all over the road and Ray and Cyril as alligator people is a reference to similar hallucinations in the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen Ray tells the story of killing a bear while bowhunting and eating its heart at the age of ten, Archer calls him \"Gay-vy Crockett.\" This is a reference to the legend (and subsequent line in songs) of Davy Crockett killing a bear at the age of three.\n\nThe fake flashback with of Archer as a young lacrosse recruit is in reference to The Natural.\n\nAfter witnessing the gutshot scene, Archer complains to James Mason \"What frickin' movie is this?! What's next, Mr. Gower slaps me deaf?!\" referring to the scene in It's a Wonderful Life wherein George is slapped in his deaf ear by the druggist.\n\nSeeing the fur hats of the Turkmen, Archer exclaims \"Hey, check it out, Fred and Barney, we're at the water buffalo lodge!\" a reference to the lodge of which Barney and Fred of The Flintstones are members, where they wear similar hats.\n\nArcher also references Buck Henry, who, among other things, directed another film in the genre of people being given a chance for character development in the wake of death, Heaven Can Wait.\n\nThe scene in which Archer plays a clarinet while wearing a grey tracksuit mimics a saxaphone-playing Warren Beatty scene in Heaven Can Wait.\n\nThe entire episode references the nation of Turkmenistan and its leader. The leader of Turkmenistan after independence, Saparmurat Niyazov, was well known for his changes to their language and naming various things after his family, etc.\n\nAfter receiving the antivenom from Cyril, Archer wakes up with the syringe still in his chest. This scene is a reference to Pulp Fiction, where Mia Wallace woke up in the same way after a drug overdose coma.\n\nArcher mocks James Mason's accent and calls him a \"cut-rate James Mason.\" This is a bit of in-joke ribbing at the fact that it was Peter Serafinowicz, and not James Mason (who is dead), voicing the character.\n\nArcher continues the theme of referring to vast knowledge of television trivia by comparing their situation to that of The Rat Patrol. James Mason also starred as Erwin Rommel in the 1951 film The Desert Fox.\n\nEpisode 7 - Live and Let Dine[]\n\nThe episode title is a play on the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die.\n\nCasteau is a French-speaking village in Belgium, although here it may also be a reference to Jacques Cousteau.\n\nRay Gillette's fake name is a reference to Gilles de Rais, best known by his reputation and conviction as a prolific serial killer of children.\n\nCheryl tells Casteau that she is former USA President John F. Kennedy's niece.\n\nCheryl mentions Ted Kennedy in a fake story.\n\nLana asks \"What is this, Spain?\" after hearing Cheryl/Carol make monkey noises. This is a reference to several instances in the past in which Spanish soccer teams have refused black players.\n\nPam calls Malory \"Cruella de Vil's mom\".\n\nCheryl says \"I'll have what he's having\" after the ambassador dies. This is a reference to the film When Harry Met Sally.\n\nCasteau at one point calls Ray \"Gayvid Niven,\" an obvious reference to David Niven, an English actor and novelist popular both in Europe and the US.\n\nCasteau also calls Ray \"Mincent Price,\" referencing Vincent Price, an American actor well known for his distinctive voice and serio-comic performances in a series of horror films made in the later part of his career. Note, Malory has before said that Ray \"minces,\" meaning to (1) speak in an affected way and (2) walk with very short steps or with exaggerated primness.\n\nThe opera Malory and Ron attend, and are kicked out of, is Carmen. The aria in the background is Habanera.\n\nThis episode draws inspiration from various cooking reality shows.\n\nAnthony Bourdain: The voice actor for Lance Casteau is Anthony Bourdain, and in addition to his smoking, mannerisms, and language being essentially like Bourdain, his motivation later on is to have a travelling show like Bourdain has. Bourdain is also known for trying all kinds of odd cuisine from various countries in his travels. In particularly he has eaten eyeballs and the heads of numerous animals.\n\nHaving untrained staff who are constantly being berated and yelled at, with sensational and often staged cuts for bumpers, references Gordon Ramsay, who is, like Casteau, famous for his risotto.\n\nSeveral cultural references are made in this episode. A number of items of Albanian cuisine are featured in the show, including dolma, rakia, and tavë kosi (the national dish of Albania). Customs such as using yogurt extensively in their food and the eating of the lamb's head and eyeballs get play. The tavë kosi in this case was made from the heads of lambs, from which Archer made Cyril scrape the meat and remove the tongues and eyeballs.\n\nBarry references the 6 Million Dollar Man, whom he resembles visually.\n\nPam holds a fish bowl containing a Siamese fighting Fish (Betta Splendens), named Germaine.\n\nMalory asks \"What is this, Spain in the 30s?\" Spain suffered a wine shortage in the 1930s during the depression.\n\nEpisode 8 - Coyote Lovely[]\n\nThe episode title is a play on the 2000 film Coyote Ugly.\n\nAs Archer explains, \"coyotes\" are people who smuggle people across the U.S.A.-Mexico border.\n\nHe also says that coyote is Spanish for coyote, and says coyote is a loanword \"...or is it a calque?\" A calque is a translated compound word (like English thought experiment from German Gedankenexperiment).\n\nArcher scratches the word \"DOM\" into a rock while waiting to snipe. This refers to the movie Fandango which has a rock with the same inscription.\n\nArcher calls Lana \"a Lorax-blowing tree-hugger\", referring to the character by Dr. Seuss.\n\nMoreno means \"Brown\" in Spanish. The name of Merces' mother, Maria Moreno, may be a reference to Maria Brown, the mother of Stephen F. Austin who inspired him to settle Texas.\n\nThe turtle seen on the desert is a Breaking Bad reference.\n\nWhen Archer handcuffs Cyril to Lana he says \"Just like The Defiant Ones.\" The Defiant Ones is a movie in which two prisoners, one black (Sidney Poitier) and one white (Tony Curtis), escape while shackled to one another.\n\nGiardia is a protozoan parasite that causes violent diarrhea, excess gas, stomach or abdominal cramps, upset stomach, and nausea.\n\nArcher concludes he may be autistic because he can count things others cannot. This refers to a phenomenon seen in some autistic people[7] and was made popular by the film Rain Man about an autistic savant.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Lana tells him she thinks he's autistic, and when Archer shoots several shots from his sniper rifle, he sarcastically retorts \"because apparently I find repetitive behavior calming!\" which is a common symptom of autism.\n\nAfter installing the police radio, the 8-track does not work. 8-tracks are obsolete today.\n\nWhen the border patrolmen run out of ammo, Mercedes says \"espera, tenia algo para esto\", which is Spanish for \"wait, I had something for this\", a frequent Archer line.\n\nArcher refers to the veterinarian who removes the bullets from his back as \"D.T. McShakyhands.\" He is referring to delirium tremens, commonly referred to as DTs, which result from alcohol withdrawal.\n\nArcher also refers to the vet as \"Kitty Hepburn\""
