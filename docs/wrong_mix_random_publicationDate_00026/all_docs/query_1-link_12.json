        "text": "You've been patient. Here is Sabio Inc.'s #FridayFireside, today featuring Amazon's Albert Cheng in a special #InsideTelevision program from our friends at Operative. I met Albert when his The Walt Disney Company team was working on the first interactive television application for the newly introduced #iPad. Working under the nickname, “#ProjectYoda,” his VERY SMALL team was responsible for developing and executing an astonishing multi-camera experience for the 2010 #AcademyAwards Broadcast. That event won an #Emmy for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media."
