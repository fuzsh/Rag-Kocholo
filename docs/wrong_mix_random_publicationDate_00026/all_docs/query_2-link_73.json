It is novel, not a picture book. I remember no pictures on the cover or the pages. I do remember a good bit about the story: a young boy is given to the local \"good witch\" (of whom the townspeople are afraid). She teaches him, among other things, mathematics. At some point he finds himself hiding while some sort of ritual is being performed on a baby. He recites the multiplication tables in order to avoid being pulled into the bad magic of the ritual. He rescues the baby and travels with two jesters. It turns out that the he and the baby are related and part of the royal family. I remember that the book started with the boy's foster father slamming his hands on the table and telling him to sit down. It ends with him unable to sleep in his soft bed in the castle and going to join the jesters in their simpler room.\n\nMcKenzie, Ellen Kindt, Taash and the Jesters, 1968. \"An orphan boy who lives with a witch becomes involved in a dangerous adventure from which he eventually emerges as the brother of a king.\"\n\nTaash and the Jesters, McKenzie, Ellen, 1970. Oh, I loved this book too! It's Taash and the Jesters, and was originally pulished in the late 60s/early 70s. Taash was a royal prince, who was stolen to protect him from an evil witch, only there was some mix-up and he was lost--nobody actually knows he's a prince. The baby is actually his nephew, although he doesn't find that out until later. The jesters are sons of two sets of identical twins--Kashka and Pip, and they're almost identical as well, only one has blue eyes and the other brown. There's a sequel called Kashka, which is even harder to find.\n\nMcKenzie, Ellen, Taash and the Jesters. Thank you!!! That is it! I almost put in the description that one of the main characters had two A's in his name. Odd the things that stick in one's mind. Now if I can only find a copy...\n\nTailypo\n\nI told my sister about you and she wants a book looked up for her. This is gonna be hard cause it wasn't a story by itself. Its a collection of short stories. But heres the main one she can remember---- it was called, I'm not sure about the spelling, \" TALYPOE \" . All she can remember is the saying that was mentioned numerous times in the story which is ------- \" TALYPOE, TALYPOE, ALL I WANT IS MY TALYPOE!! \" How's that for a stumper!\n\nTailypo by Galdone.\n\nThe book is TAILYPO by Joanna Galdone, illustrated by her father, Paul Galdone.\n\nHi. \"Tailypo\" (T12) is a story called The Peculiar Such Thing, in a collection of stories called The People Could Fly, by Virginia Hamilton. It's a marvelous collection of African-American folk tales that is sold with a tape of the stories read by Hamilton and by James Earl Jones. Hearing Virginia Hamilton groan, \"Tailypo, tailypo. Give me back my tailypo\" is absolutely blood-curdling!\n\nT12 There was a wonderful book that came out in the late 1960s called Gwot: Horribly Funny Hairticklers by George Mendoza. It consisted of several stories, one of which featured the words \"Give... me... my... hairy... TOE!!\" It had some strange illustrations that fascinated my siblings and me because they were grotesque and scary. The stories were scary and funny, but mostly funny. This might be the book you're thinking of.\n\nTaka-chan and I\n\nThank you for your time. I am looking for a book I read as a child (1960-1965). The pictures in the book were black and white photgraphs. I can't remember the names of the characters but the two main characters were a little girl and a large dog (yellow labrador). I believe the dog \"dug\" to China or Tokyo and found this girl. I can still see some of the pictures in my head. Little girl looking down a hole, dog digging, girl and dog walking through a busy city (Tokyo or another oriental city). Any assistance you could give me would be greatly appreciated. I wrote to Captain Kangaroo aka Bob Keeshan because I remember seeing this book on his show. He remembered the story but could not remember the title of the book. I thank you for your time and assistance or guidance.\n\nYou didn't mention a dragon, but possibly Taka-chan and I: A Dog's Journey to Japan by Betty Jean Lifton (Norton, 1967). \"A dog digs a hole in the sand, all the way to Japan, where he meets a little girl held captive by a dragon and helps her to find the most loyal person in Japan.\"\n\nD114 Lifton, Betty Jean. Taka-Chan and I. I used to half-heartedly look for a copy of my daughter.\n\nTake Me to My Friend\n\nearly 70s. A girl and her grandmother are on a car trip and they pick up two teens (they think are boys but one turns out to be a girl). The teens take over the car and put the girl and grandmother in peril. They hide their travelling money in a knitting bag and the teens don't know it is there and spitefully throw it out of the car and then they have to go back for it when it is revealed about the money. The girl ties a red scarf on the car antenna to allow the car to be spotted by rescuers.\n\nJordan, Hope Dahle, Three Desperate Days, 1967. I think this is the book you are looking for. There is an alternate title, Take Me to my Friend which is in reference to the sign the hitchhiker had. Julie is the name of the girl and she has to drive her grandmother from Florida to someplace up north. I remember that she doesn't like to drive and is afraid of crossing a bridge. She hides her grandmother's rings in a ball of yarn so the hitchhikers can't get them. Her boyfriend was supposed to meet them on the way home by putting a red ribbon on the car's antennae. So that's how they get rescued.\n\nHope Dahle Jordan, Take Me To My Friend\n\nYes, It is Take Me to My Friend. Thank you so much.\n\nTaking Care of Carruthers\n\nThe book I'm searching for is a children's fiction book which I *think* may have been published in the '70's because of the style of the drawings. There were three main characters: a pig, a bear and an alligator (or crocodile). They all go on a boat trip down a river or canal (somewhere narrow and dark anyway) and along the way meet other creatures. I'm not certain but I think they met a bird and a dog. One of the three main characters may have been called Cuthbert or Hubert as I remember them having old-fashioned names. The front cover of the book was white and had a central picture of the three character sitting in a boat. Possibly under an umbrella too. The cover colours were very simple. The rest of the illustrations in the book were just ordinarily printed on the page. I'm sorry that's so vague. It's all I can remember and even most of that is a bit iffy in my memory. Please help me!\n\nP243 This is most likely a book illustrated and maybe even written by James Marshall. It could be one of the FOX books (like FOX AND FRIENDS). Fox does have a pig and alligator/crocodile among his friends. Take a look online at some of his illustrations. His style is simple, but distinctive, and you'll probably know right away whether he's the right illustrator.~from a librarian\n\nJames Marshall, What's the Matter With Carruthers? Hi, I solved my own book stumper when I recognised the style of drawing from the cover on the of the books on the 'back in print' pages! The illustrator turned out to also be the author, James Marshall. Then I found the book and it was called What's The Matter With Carruthers. I'm so pleased. Much thanks to you and your website!\n\nJames Marshall, Taking Care of Carruthers. Oops, I got it wrong, it isn't What's The Matter With Carruthers?, it's Taking Care of Carruthers instead. And it's not an alligator, it's a turtle instead. Thanks for the help!\n\nTal, his Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom\n\nMy teacher read us this book in 6th grade. A man is going to see a king whose son is locked up somewhere and will only come out when the right story is told. If the wrong story is told it is death to the storyteller. This man is traveling with a young boy and he tells him all the different stories he is thinking about telling to get his opinon of which will be the story to set the kings son free. Well it turns out the boy the man is traveling with is the son of the king. It had many magical stories within the story.\n\nCooper, Paul Fenimore, Tal, his Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom, Purple House 2001, reprint. The story teller is Noom-Zor-Noom, and he travels with a donkey and a boy named Tal. Tal is the King's son, who has been lost, and can't be identified/found until the right story is told. I think.\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades Cooper, Paul Fenimore. Tal, His Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom. Illustrated by Ruth Reeves. Purple House Press, 1929, 1957, 2001. New hardback edition. $20\n\nThe Tale of a Monkey\n\nA children's book, possibly Canadian in the late 50's was about a monkey whose tail wouldn't curl. They tried various solutions that didn't work: tieing a cane to it, which slipped off and he fell into something like cake batter. The final solution was to put his tail in the pretzel baker.\n\nAlice Sankey, Rosemary Buehrig (illus), Marcus - The Tale of a Monkey, 1950. A Cozy Corner Book, published by Whitman in 1950, about a young monkey named Marcus (after his great uncle) whose tail won't curl, leading him into all sorts of adventures. The book is squarish with a green cover, showing Marcus (from the shoulders up) wearing a little red hat with a green plaid hatband, a yellow turtleneck shirt, and green plaid suspenders.\n\nAlice Sankey, Marcus - The Tale of a Monkey. You may set my stumper to solved! Thank you so much! Tale of Corally Crothers\n\nCarolee Carouthers, had no sisters or brothers, 1925--1935.\n\nGay, Romney. The Tale of Corally Crothers. Grosset & Dunlap, 1932. and a sequel: Come Play with Corally Crothers. Grosset & Dunlap, 1943.\n\n---\n\nI am looking for a book my parents read to me in the mid to late 1940s. It was about \"Cora Lee Cruthers, She had no brothers.\" The book about Cora Lee Cruthers or maybe Carrothers was all in verse.\n\nTale of Custard the Dragon\n\nThe first lines of this book/story were: \"Melinda lived in a little white house with a little brown dog and a little grey mouse.\" The story went on to talk about a buglar and a crocodile and possibly an island, but I have never been able to remember enough to find the book again. My First Grade teacher, Ms. Lucas, always read it to us after lunch/recess. That was back in 1959-1960. At one point I had the entire thing memorized. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nM115: Well, the details are not consistent, but it DOES sound like Ogden Nash's Tale of Custard the Dragon. I first read it in Louis Untermeyer's 1970s Golden Treasury of Poetry.\n\nOgden Nash, The Tale of Custard the Dragon. \"classic Nash story of Belinda and her pet dragon is illustrated by Lynn Munsinger.\"\n\nOgden Nash, Custard the Dragon or the tale of. I'm pretty sure the rest of the line is something about a little yellow dog, and a little red wagon and a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.\n\nOgden Nash, The Tale of Custard the Dragon. Most anthologies of classic children's poetry include this poem. Also posted on a lot of personal web sites.\n\nM115 \"Belinda lived in a little white house, With a little black kitten and a little gray mouse, And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon, And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon\" from CUSTARD THE DRAGON by Ogden Nash. There is a newly illustrated copy out, but the copy you probably remember was published in 1959 with illustrations by Linell (Ogden Nash's daughter) ~from a librarian\n\n---\n\nThis was a book but it read like a very long poem/prose. It had a hard cover, tall (11\") but not wide, maybe six inches. I think the cover was white. It started with: \"Melinda lives in a little white house, with a little brown dog and a little grey mouse.\" It goes on to talk about the house being on a island, a robber at the window and the dog, mouse and Melinda out smart him, perhaps a crocodile in there somewhere. My First Grade teacher, Mrs. Lucas read it to us every day after lunch. At age 6, I could recite the entire prose but now can only remember the first line. Please help. I have been looking for this for over twenty years. Thanks!\n\nWhy does everyone forget the dragon? This is Ogden's Nash's Tale of Custard the Dragon.\n\nA Tale of Stolen Time\n\nOk, everyone insists I've made this up: A young boy lives in a village and goes to school. One day he gets lost in the woods and finds a cottage with a grandfather clock in it. Since it's late, he goes to sleep, but is awakened when he hears chanting? Several weird children are dancing in a circle and the clock hands are going backward. Scared, he runs off and finds his way home. The next day, he's very old. No one recognizes him. He sees an old woman on a park bench crying and after talking to her, realizes she's his classmate, and they've been aged overnight. They figure out that there are other children who are in the same plight, and they go back to the cottage and dance, turning the clock forward. As they're dancing, the weird children burst in, screaming at them to stop, but the boy and his classmates are getting younger as the weird children (fairies?) are getting older. This is an illustrated book, there's a picture of a red double-decker bus in it, so I think it's British. I have no idea when it was written, but I would be SO greatful if anyone has a clue!\n\nNo solution unfortunately, but it looks like this might be the same as O79.\n\nEvgeny Schwartz, A Tale of Stolen Time, 1966, copyright. I almost fainted when I got this book in the mail (thank you Amazon!). I have been looking for this for twenty years, and as soon as I saw the illustrations, I knew I'd found it. Thank you so SO much for having this service -- you have solved a mystery that has haunted me for most of my life.\n\nTale of the Napkin Rabbit\n\nThis was a hard cover book approximately 8\"x12\" and about 1/4\" thick. It was sold with a handkerchief. As far as I remember,there was someone telling the Easter story while twisting and folding a handkerchief on her lap. At the end of the story the folded handkerchief resembled a bunny. I first saw it at a Meijer store in the early 1990's and it sold for about $15.00.\n\nA.J. Wood, The Tale of the Napkin Rabbit, 1993. I'm almost positive this is what you are looking for - it comes with a napkin to fold into the bunny. It might also just be called \"The Napking Rabbit\". We have a copy at my store, but it doesn't have the napkin with it anymore. I'm not sure if it's still in print or not.\n\nTale of Tiggy Pig\n\nDrawings by Earnest Aris dated 1920 appear in the 1989 Brambledown Book Hoppity Hareï¿½s Adventures which appears to be based on an Uncle Toby Tale, by Ernest Aris titled The Story of Ginger Hare published about 1937. What was the name of the book that featured the original drawings??\n\nA73 spelling shld be Ernest. I found this 1920 bk in a list of pig bks when I used \"Ernest Aris\" on search engine Google. Ernest Aris: The Tale of Tiggy Pig (1920) Seeker might want to look - I didn't go thru all 20 or so articles.\n\nTales of Magic\n\nI'm looking for a 1950's children's book about time travel through a pond or lake to King Arthur's time. There were two or three children and I think they may have gone more than once. At the time I thought it was a little like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Thanks!\n\nSounds like a combination of Magic By the Lake and Half Magic by Edward Eager--the children visit King Arthur's time in the latter and time travel via a lake in the former. His characters do interrelate I can't recall if the same set of characters are used in these two titles or not.\n\nEdward Eager has two books that, combined, could fit this stumper. In Knight's Castle the children travel into the Ivanho story. In Magic By The Lake they do a lot of time-travelling via lake-water. Both books have an irreverent humor that might remind the reader of Connecticut Yankee.\n\nEdward Eager's time-travel adventures are grouped together under the group title Tales of Magic. The series includes Half Magic, Knight's Castle, The Time Garden and Magic by the Lake.\n\nTales of Mr. Pengachoosa\n\ni remember a beautiful weekly reader book club edition about a little girl with rhuematic or scarlet fever. she couldn't go out to play so her hamster amused her by telling stories. this was not a picture book. i think it had chapters.\n\nwhat a great idea, I think we all need a story-telling hamster...\n\nCaroline Rush, Tales of Mr. Pengachoosa,1973. '\"While recovering from a long illness, a little girl is entertained by her pet hamster who tells her stories about his adventurous grandfather.\"\n\ncaroline rush, tales of mr. pengachoosa, 1973. Wow! Thank you, thank you thank you! This was so fast. It posted on Monday and was solved on Tuesday! Now to find that book!\n\nAnd let's not forget Further Tales of Mr Pengachoosa (Crown, 1973). \"Hammy the hamster continues to entertain the little girl who owns him with stories of his grandfather's adventurous exploits.\"\n\nInterpreting\n\nCondition\n\nGrades Rush, Caroline. Tales of Mr. Pengachoosa. Illustrated by Dominique M. Strandquest. Crown, 1965. Weekly Reader Children's Book Club edition. Fine. $8\n\nTales of the Resistance\n\nThe main character was a boy who had a scar (from a burn?) on his cheek. It embarassed him so he'd cover it with his hand when he talked to people. He may have been known as Scar. He was an orphan, I think.-There was some evil corporation or something that made orphans (or maybe just kids) work in the sewers and waterworks of the city. They might have lived down there as well. -There was a garbage dump (landfill) where there was a magical doorway to another place, a kingdom of sorts, where social outcasts and people with deformitie became beautiful and lived together in peace. This place had a king and I think he had bright red hair. -When the boy with the scar went to that place he didn't have a scar. At one point in the story, he and a girl passed through fire and become regal. -I read these books in the 1980s. The two books I had were thin and hardbound with dustcovers. One of the books (sans dustcover) was purple and the other was blue. The dustcover had illustrations on the front. The books themselves were richly illustrated.\n\nMains, David R. and Karen, Tales of the Resistance (Kingdom Tales). I'm pretty sure this is what you're looking for. The boy is called 'Hero', but he does have a scar, and he does pass through fire. He does have a female friend, though I can't remember her name. My copy of the book was hard cover, purple/blue and had the elaborate illustrations you mention. The stories in the book are Christian allegories.\n\nMains, David R. and Karen, Tales of the Resistance. Stay away from the edition that was put out in 2000 -- it only has B&W pictures apparently. I JUST bought these after a long search myself! I bought these online -- each one was $22, but they were brand-new and had never even been opened. I've soaked them in, re-reading them!!! Not only are they just as beautiful, the stories are rich and I have cried several times -- the correlation between faith and the King / Kingdom of the Restoration is absolutely encouraging and uplifting. I don't think I'll ever be too old for these.\n\nTales from Shakespeare\n\nThis book is titled \"Favorite Stories from Shakespeare,\" or \"Favorite Tales from Shakespeare,\" or suchlike. 1910-ish. It is NOT \"Tales from Shakespeare\" by Charles and Mary Lamb. Different author(s). The summaries of the plays (including \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"Taming of the Shrew,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Hamlet,\" \"King Lear,\" and \"The Tempest\") are retold very simply. It has a dark-violet cover with decorated gilt title (as I recall). The copy I once owned lacked a jacket. It features charming black-and-white illustrations, especially at the end of each chapter, and several full-color plates: watercolor paintings on glossy white stock. One of these plates depicts Hamlet responding to the Ghost's summons on the battlements. He's at the left foreground, in profile, wearing a black cloak. The Ghost stands in right background. Another color plate shows Petruchio arguing with the haberdasher, pointing to some imaginary fault in the lacy peach-satin dress he has just received while Kate stands (or sits) confounded, helpless, and the tailor stands with his back to the viewer, stooped over, and very upset. There's a color plate of Romeo and Juliet in the balcony scene, too. I think there's also one showing Titania with Bottom (ass's head and all). The b/w pen-and-ink illustrations have a charming Art Nouveau quality. There's one showing a perplexed Miranda meeting Ferdinand for the first time, and one showing Lear holding the dead Cordelia in his arms, his eyes full of grief and fury. I recall another one showing Petruchio pulling the sheets from a bed while Kate sits in profile, protesting (rather calmly). I am eager to locate a replacement copy of this book.\n\nBernard Miles, Favo(u)rite Tales from Shakespeare. ill Victor Ambrus. various editions (UK & US). Not quite the set of tales included by the querier, but otherwise, sounds like the book in question.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, but the book I'm looking for dates to the World War I or Edwardian era. I'm familiar with the work of Victor Ambrus (and like it, and am curious to check out this book)...but it's a completely dfferent one I'm after.\n\nE. Nesbit, The Children's Shakespeare, 1938. My copy of this contains all the retellings the seeker mentioned, but only b/w illustrations by Rolf Klep, and sounds like it is from a later time period than the book in question. But I thought I'd mention it anyway, just in case.\n\nE. Nesbit, Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare for Children, 1907.\n\ncheck out the images at this site. these are Max Bihn's illustrations for E. Nesbit. Table of Contents: Brief life of Shakespeare -- A Midsummer night'\\''s dream -- Tempest -- As you like it -- Winter's tale -- King Lear -- Twelfth night -- Much ado about nothing -- Romeo and Juliet -- Pericles -- Hamlet -- Cymbeline -- Macbeth -- Comedy of errors -- Merchant of Venice -- Timon of Athens -- Othello -- Taming of the shrew -- Measure of measure -- Two gentlemen of Verona -- All's well that ends well\n\nS98 shakespearean stories: From about the right date is Children's Shakespeare, retold by Alice Spencer Hoffman, illustrated by Charles Folkard, published Dutton 1911 (reprint 1936). Contents are Tempest,\n\nMidsummer Night's Dream, Much ado, Merchant of Venice, As you like it; Taming of the Shrew, Twelfth Night, Winter's Tale, King John, King Richard II, King Henry V, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Cymbeline, Coriolanus, Pericles. There's also Shakespeare Story Book, retold by Mary Macleod, illustrated by Gordon Browne, published Barnes 1905, reprint of 1902 ed. No contents list available, a retelling of 16 of the plays using \"as much as possible of the dialogue\". Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch published his retellings in 1900, but he only covered the history plays, so that can't be the one wanted.\n\nLang, Jeanie, Stories from Shakespeare Told to the Children. Perhaps it is from the \"Told to the Children\" series? They\n\nare small hardcover books with yellow dustjackets and a mostly red cover underneath with gilt writing. They have colour plates, but I don't remember any black and white. The series contained famous Western Classics (Homer, Chaucer, the Bible, etc) retold very simply. My father had these growing up in England (1950s), but I think they might be from much earlier. They are very much treasured in my family.\n\nSOLVED: Margaret Christian, Tales from Shakespeare, 1917. The book I was looking for is Margaret Christianï¿½s \"Tales from Shakespeare\" (Childrenï¿½s Classics series, M. A. Donahue & Company, 1917). It includes six full-color illustrations by A. M. Turner and numerous pen-and-ink illustrations by A. T. Weston. (I recalled five of the Turner illustrations, having forgotten only the frontispiece, showing Rosalind, Celia, and Touchstone.) I checked around online and saw a photo of the dustjacket, which shows Titania and Bottom. It resembled the illustration that I remembered, and I took a leap, and now have a copy.\n\nTales of Terror\n\nCannot remember title, publisher, date for ghost story collection read in elementary school circa 1984-1988 that had a story about a family eating possum and discovers possums have eaten uncle ned's corpse and possibly story about a man on snipe hunt falls into river and snakes engulf him. May have been a child's recollection about picking rocks every year so the father can plow. It had a folklorish nature, maybe mountain folk. May have had a story about disembodied voices from a hole in ground or abandoned mineshaft. I think book was about 8\"x10\" and about an inch thick, was illustrated.\n\nIda Chittum, Franz Altschuler, Tales of Terror, 1975. I remember this book-- there was a story of a \"snipe hunt\" (involving a bunch of snakes), a woman turning to paper, children picking rocks on a farm... The cover art was of people in rural garb, with swirls of green fog instead of faces. (I checked it out in elementary school back in the 70s, and forgot to return it, so my parents had to pay for it!)\n\nI would like to thank the wonderful person who replied to G301 stumper. My husband was ready to sign papers to have me commited to an institution because I was so obsessed with this book. God bless you all.\n\nTales Told in Holland\n\n1975. This is a picture book, and I think the title has the word \"precious\" or \"golden\" in it. A port in Holland is rich its ships bring in rich textiles, glass goods, fancy dolls. Then the port (?) falls on hard times. Or something falls on hard times, and the people are starving. A ship brings in wheat, but the captain's somehow insulted or infuriated by the ragged crowd, and he dumps all the wheat over the side. The town dies, the port silts in, and the wheat grows, golden as the precious whatevers ships had once brought. Boy, does that sound hokey. I sure loved it, though.\n\nMiller -- Book House for Children, Tales Told in Holland, 1926. This story appears in a children's book of mine. The title of the story is \"The Lady of Stavoren.\" I am sure the story has been anthologized or retold in many other books. The lady is a rich widow whose ships sail everywhere. She commands her best captain to sail all over the world and bring her back the most precious cargo that can be bought for gold. He brings back a shipload of wheat. She is outraged and commands him to dump the cargo in the harbor. So he dumps it at the mouth of the harbor, which causes the mouth to silt up to the point that no ships can enter or leave. The rich lady is reduced to poverty and finally understands that her ship's captain was right all along. And the sand bar that formed is called Vrouwenzand, or Lady's Sand.\n\nSome of the stories in Tales Told in Holland have authorial credits, most have regional credits, others have title translations. \"The Lady of Stavoren\" is credited as \"A Tale from the Province of Friesland.\" I suspect you did indeed have this collection. Perhaps you remember a trio of tall books: Tales Told in Holland, Nursery Friends from France and Little Pictures of Japan? Look under the Anthology Finder for My Bookhouse. These three books were issued as companions to the set of My Bookhouse.\n\nhttp://www.aaronshep.com/stories/017_legend.html does this help?\n\nI sent in the first solution. My grandmother gave my sisters and me all three of these books. My oldest sister got the French book, my second sister, who was born in Japan, got the Japanese book, and I got the Dutch book. I always loved the careful illustrations, often adapted from masterpieces by Dutch artists. I was sorry to learn that these were the only three books in this series.\n\nTalisman\n\nJust discovered your website and am hoping you can help me out. I've been searching for a book called, 'The Talisman' and so far no luck. It doesn't help that I don't remember the authors name, all I do remember is that it was one of my favorite books which I read as a child in the mid to late 70's??? (I'm sure it was written well before this time but I really have no idea) The story was of a group of children who found this coin (the talisman) and I believe they could make wishes on it or some such magic. (as you can see my memory of it is a bit fuzzy) It was a wonderful, magical tale of their adventures with this coin and also had nice illustrations. It's a book I'd love to have on the bookshelf for memory sake and to also share with my niece.\n\nEdward Eager, Half Magic, 1954. This sounds like Edward Eager's amazing children's classic Half Magic, which is wonderfully and whimsically illustrated by N.M. Bodecker. Here's a synopsis: Edward Eager has been delighting young readers for more than 40 years with stories that mix magic and reality. Half Magic, the most popular of his tales about four children who encounter magical coins, time-travel herb gardens, and other unlikely devices, is a warm, funny, original adventure. The \"Half Magic\" of the title refers to a coin that the children find. Through a comical series of coincidences, they discover that the coin is magic. Well, it's not totally magic--it's only (you guessed it) half magic. That means there's a certain logic to the wishes one must make to generate a desired outcome. Imagine the results emerging from inaccurate efforts: \"half\" invisible, \"half\" rescued, \"half\" everything!\n\nE. Nesbit, The Story of the Amulet, 1906. This is just a suggestion it doesn't match exactly. A group of children have half an amulet which allows them to travel in time. If they find the other half, they will receive their heart's desire. A classic, in print for nearly a century.\n\nThere could be a different book called The Talisman, but this does remind me of Nesbit's book The Amulet.\n\nT98 Could be HALF MAGIC by Edward Eager, 1954 ~from a librarian\n\nStephen King And Peter Straub, The Talisman\n\nTalking Earth\n\nI don't remember much about the book, but it was about an indian girl traveling down a (river?) She travels in a canoe and there's something about an otter that she befriends in it. I also remember her staying in a cave at one point and meeting up with a mountain lion (or some other large cat) which I belive shows up later in the book to help her. I'm not having any luck trying to find this book because I don't remember much about it. It was probably published before or around 1995.\n\nGeorge, Jean Craighead, The Talking Earth. Billie Wind, a Seminole teenager, goes out into the Everglades alone to try to understand her people's beliefs in earth spirits and talking animals. She befriends an otter, a turtle, and a panther cub. She crawls into a sand cave towards the end of the book when her animal friends alert her to a coming storm.\n\nJean Craighead George, The Talking Earth. This sounds a lot like what you describe -- Native American girl in Florida goes on a journey into the Everglades to learn to listen to the land and understand her people. She does meet an otter and a panther in the course of her journey. I loved this book when I was younger! Hope it's what you're looking for!\n\nThe Talking Parcel\n\nGirl named Penelope. I read this book around the mid to late 70s and can not remember much. It involved magic, a phoenix and possibly a railroad? It was not a typical children's book, it seemed kind of mystical, along the lines of 'A Wrinkle In Time' possibly.\n\nGerald Durrell, The Talking Parcel aka The Battle for Castle Cockatrice. Three kids have adventures, one is named Penelope. All the other elements you mention are present.\n\nGerald Durrell, The Talking Parcel (later republished as The Battle for Castle Cockatrice), 1974. This might be a bit of a longshot... Penelope and two other children are recruited by a talking parrot to go to Mythologia, a world of fantastic animals by means of a magic train, in order to save the land from marauding cockatrices. They meet many creatures, such as mooncalves, werewolves, a sea serpent, phoenix, and more. The author is much better known for his amazing (and very funny) books for adults about his adventures in animal tracking and collecting. You can definitely see the influence in this work: each of his fantastic creatures has its particular habitat, diet and needs. This book was later made into a very odd animated film!\n\nSOLVED: Gerald Durrell, The Talking Parcel aka The Battle for Castle Cockatrice. This is it!!! Thanks, that was quick!!! Now if I can find it....Can't wait to read it again!!!\n\nTall and Proud\n\nLooking for a book from my elementary school library, so would have been published before 1979. The story is of a girl who loves horses and gets polio and is confined inside. I think there was a burglar and she somehow uses the horse to ride to safety?? Can't remember much more than that. Thanks\n\nVian Smith, Tall and Proud, 1966. This is definitly the book! Its about a girl named Gail who contracts polio, her desperate father gets her a horse to motivate her to learn to walk again. In the process she and the horse, Sam, catch an escaped convict.\n\nSmith, Vian, Tall and Proud, 1968, Pocket Books (reissue Doubleday 2000). Sounds like \"Tall and Proud,\" in which a girl contracts polio and gradually rehabilitates both herself and a lame racehorse. I'm pretty sure the book was British. I recall the heroine at the beginning playing in a stream with her dolls she'd named for the Beatles, and rescuing Ringo first \"because he was the most important\"!!! When she's dxed with polio, all of her treasures and toys are burned. Her parents get her the sick horse to help her connect with the world again.\n\nVian Smith, Tall and Proud. I loved this one and I was just thinking about it the other day! The heroine's parents buy her an injured racehorse as she's recovering from polio -- she learns to walk again because of her desire to take care of the horse.\n\n---\n\nA girl ends up in the hospital with, perhaps, polio. She has a painful recovery and must learn to walk again. When she is sent home there is a horse who is also lame and recovering. At some point the girl must get on the horse at night to ride for help or to safety because something has happened at her home. She is hoping they will both make it. I read this book in the 60s so it is at least that old. Older if the girl had polio I suppose. Thanks for any help.\n\nVian Smith, Tall and Proud, 1966, copyright. This is Tall and Proud by Vian Smith (UK title King Sam)...one of my favorites growing up (I still have my copy!). Gail is recovering from polio, but is falling behind in learning to walk again, due to the fear of the pain involved in her physical therapy. Her parents buy her Sam, a steeplechaser injured and retired from the track, hoping that the desire to ride will inspire her to push herself to walk again. All the characters, Gail, her friend Roddy, her parents, are very well drawn, as is the location, Dartmoor. Smith wrote a number of horse books, all well worth checking out, all had both US and UK printings. Tall and Proud was printed by Doubleday in hardcover and Archway in paperback, as King Sam it was printed by Constable Young.\n\nC. W. Anderson, Afraid to Ride, 1957. Maybe this one? The details aren't exactly the same--the girl is injured in a riding accident, and is too scared to ride; the horse is badly treated and skittish, too. Otherwise, the plot is almost the same as you describe.\n\nDorothy Lyons, Dark Sunshine, 1951, copyright. \"Two years before, horse-loving Blythe Hyland would have been thrilled with the news that the family was moving back to an Arizona ranch, but now - what difference did it make to her? What could a thin, listless girl, crippled by polio, do on a ranch? Then Blythe found Dark Sunshine, a magnificent wild mare that had been trapped by a landslide. From the moment she learned it was possible to rescue the buckskin, Blythe determined that, crutches or not, she would train and ride her. It was slow, often painful work for the crippled girl but when an endurance ride offered Blythe her only chance to win athletic honors toward a scholarship, both horse and rider were ready for the grueling test.\"\n\nVian Smith, Tall and Proud. This must be it. The plot is just what the poster remembers. Its listed on the solved mystery pages.\n\nVian Smith, Tall and Proud, 1966, approximate. I think this is the book you're looking for. The girl has polio, the horse was lame, she doesn't think she'll ever get better. I think either robbers or someone with a grudge against her father breaks into her home, and she escapes, manages to get on the horse, and rides for help. Tall and Proud might have been the an alternate title--I think it was one of those books that when it ended up in the Scholastic book order, it was given a different title.\n\nMystery ALREADY solved from further research on your site. Tall and Proud by Vian Smith. : )\n\nTall Book of Christmas\n\nSeeking a a collection of Christmas stories-Granny Glittens and Her Amazing Mittens, The Penny Walk (flipping a penny to decide which way to walk), The Perfect Tree (with Mary Berry---) this is NOT the Gertrude C book you see on Ebay all the time. I know because I accidentally bought it! It was the size of a Giant Golden Book. From the mid to late 1950's is my best guess....??? Great Big Book of Christmas Stories??---???Big Santa CLaus Book???? Thanks for helping me. I remember my mother reading them to me and she passed away a year ago. I would love to have this for Christmas\n\nDorothy Hall Smith, The Tall Book of Christmas, 1954. Granny Glittens and her Amazing Mittens is in this book, as is Christmas Through a Knothole and many more. Not sure about the other stories mentioned.\n\n---\n\nMrs. Smittens and Her Christmas Mittens, Nov. 1954? This was part of a treasury of Christmas stories. Mrs. Smittens used colored licorice to dye wool for Christmas mittens. Mrs. Smittens might be a cat. This is all I can remember.\n\nSmith, Dorothy Hall, The Tall Book of Christmas, 1954. This is almost certainly right. The book is an anthology that includes, among other stories, \"Granny Glittens and Her Amazing Mittens.\" The name's a little off (Granny Glittens vs. Mrs. Smittens), and I don't think she was a cat, but everything else checks out.\n\nTall Book of Christmas\n\nA story my parents read to us when my sister and I were children featured a giant in a castle made of limberger cheese (?). I remember this story being read to us around Christmas, but I'm not sure whether or not it was a Christmas story. My recollection is that it was contained in a collection / anthology of children's stories. This was in the late 1960's - early 1970's, so the book had to be published before then I'm guessing pre-1950 (?). Any help in finding this would be appreciated.\n\nDorothy Hall Smith, The Tall Book of Christmas, 1954, 2006 reprint. My family just received this as a Christmas gift. This is a brand new reprint from Gramercy Books and it contains the story \"Giant Grummer's Christmas\" by William Dana Street. This story is about a giant who lives in a castle made from limburger cheese. Now when are they going to reprint the rest of the \"Tall Books\"?\n\nGiant Grummer's Christmas. The giant is Giant Grummer, and he does live in a castle made of limburger cheese. The story is in the Tall Book of Christmas.\n\nTall Book of Make-Believe\n\nThe book I am looking for, as I remember it, is a collection of childrens' verses. My mother read it to me in the early 1960's. My favorite was about a crooked man who had a crooked house, a crooked cat, etc. I believe Puss 'N Boots was in it also. The book was tall and narrow. The illustrations in the book and on the cover were wonderful. The cover illustrations may have included elves.\n\nBe sure you look at the Most Requested Anthologies page to see if anything there looks familiar.\n\nThe Tall Book of Make-Believe. Sounds like it, anyway. Hard to find and pricey, too. :-)\n\nOf course. See also Most Requested Books.\n\n---\n\nI am looking for a childhood book, I am 44 years old. This book was a reader or fairy tale book of some type I believe, it contained several stories in it. The stories I most remember and want to find is a story about The Everlasting Lollipop and also a story about the Magic Kettle, I think they had to speak to the kettle to stop it from boiling over and say \"stop, stop\" or something like that. I am not sure what the exact title of these stories are. I believe these stories were both in the same book. We were thinking it was in that Tall Book of Fairytales, but I found a 1947 edition of that book on ebay and won the bid to find out that neither story was in there. I don't know if they have several editions of that book or if I have it confused with the book these stories are really in. I have been on a search for this book for years. Can anyone help me??\n\nPorter, the Magic Kettle, 1979 Franklin Watts, NY, reprint. Found this description online of a book by \"Porter\" called \"The Magic Kettle\": \"A rusty, dusty, magical kettle brings good fortune to two men\" But that was all it said.

The version of this anthology that appeared in 1950 contains The Everlasting Lollipop, but not the other story.\n\nMagic Porridge Pot or Wonderful Porridge Pot. Perhaps you mean the Magic Porridge Pot (aka Wonderful Porridge Pot)? In this story, a kind man repays a good deed by giving up a magic pot that if you say \"Cook, little pot, cook\", it will cook a nice potful of porridge, but you must stop it by saying \"Stop, little pot, stop\". The old woman forgets the right words to make it stop, and the pot keeps pumping out porridge until it floods the old woman's house.\n\nWell, based on the memory that it might be a Tall Book... and the inclusion of The Everlasting Lollipop, I'm going to mark this one solved as The Tall Book of Make-Believe. My copy also does not have Magic (or Wonderful) Porridge Pot. Perhaps that was part of a separate book memory?\n\n---\n\nThis picture book is about a naughty mouse who lives with a girl and her mother. The mouse never helps with chores (ie. never brings in the morning newspaper) and is very messy (never wipes feet at front door and doesn't clean up the milk (or o.j.?) that he frequently spills. Finally, the girl's mother is tired of cleaning up after the mouse and she ties him to an umbrella during a rainstorm. The mouse that eventually finds his way home is a very reformed mouse who always brings in the newspaper, wipes his feet, and cleans up the spilled liquid. I loved this book as a child and my parents still call me \"Bad Mousie\" although I don't remember that being a part of the title/book? I remember reading it in the early/mid 80's. It was a library book (that I checked out a lot and always had to pay overdue fines!) that wasn't in the best of condition, so maybe published in the 60's or 70's??\n\nMartha Dudley, Bad Mousie, 1947. \"Donica's story, written by her mother, illus. by Trientje Engelbrecht.\" If you can find a copy of Books Before Five, by Dorothy White (check a library), the book is mentioned in it (it was a favourite of Dorothy White's small daughter).\n\nDudley, Martha, Bad Mousie. I've never read it, but I think this is it. Bad Mousie \"is the story of a little girl who has a pet mouse that is constantly making messes and getting in touble.\" (quoted from the Jane Werner Waton page under \"Most Requested Books.\")\n\nBad Mousie. This story was also in the book Tall Book of Make Believe, 1950.\n\nDudley, Martha, Bad Mousie, 1947. This is anthologized in The Tall Book of Make-Believe, copywright 1950.\n\nThank so, so, so much for providing your Stump the Bookseller service! I am astonished that a solution was found so quickly, especially since I've been trying to find out the title of this book for years! On a side note, I now realize that I was thinking of the version of Bad Mousie that is in The Tall Book of Make-Believe. I'm beginning to remember some of the poems and other stories in that collection. Now I'm searching for economic copies of that book...why are these books so expensive???

I recall something about her and the people she was living with hiding in caves to escape the shelling of the city and them not having much food or clothing after a while, she ended up wearing a pair of Wellington boots from England because her other shoes had worn out and they couldn't get anything new because of the siege. thanks\n\nThe tamarack tree : a novel of the siege of Vicksburg / Patricia Clapp. 1986 1st ed.

It's about a girl whose parents have died, the house is made out of a type of colored crystal, she has her mother's necklace made out of the same stuff. She goes to see the old woman on the hill who will answer only one question from each person (and she keeps chickens) and the girl wins the love of the prince at his birthday celebration. Vague, I know, but this is what I remember. Oh -- there is also a dog-like creature with really long fur and more than four legs, so when it walks it looks sort of like a walking carpet (?)'\n\nIs this similar to F21: Fairy, tiny?\n\nThis IS definitely Tatsinda by Elizabeth Enright. A childless couple find a child being carried off by an eagle and they adopt her, but she is a brown-eyed, golden-haired child in a land of blue-eyed, silver-haired people. She is, however, very good at weaving the traditional rugs and so is tolerated. She weaves the very best for the prince's birthday in hopes he will notice she has grown up and marry her, but in the midst of the birthday celebration, an evil giant appears to steal the crystals which are so prevalent that everyone uses them to build roads and houses, but are precious in the giant's land. Tatsinda and the prince defeat the giant and do marry. The wise woman does have chickens and answers one question per person, and aids in the defeat of the giant. The \"dog\" is not part of the illustrations in my edition but there is a picture of a \"tim-tik,\" drawn as a tallish, long-haired goat type creature which Tatsinda rode upon. The ISBN is 0-15-284280-2\n\n---\n\nMy third grade class read this book together. The title was the protagonist's name, which may have begun with a \"t\". It was about a blonde haired brown eyed baby raised amid a race of white haired blue eyed people who regarded her as ugly. Eventually she married their prince. I've questioned lots of people about this book over the years and apparently myself and fellow classmates are the only people who've ever read it!\n\nElizabeth Enright, Tatsinda, 1961. This sounds similar to a summary I read for Elizabeth Enright's Tatsinda today!\n\nTatsinda--Elizabeth Enright\n\nEnright, Elizabeth, Tatsinda, illustrated by Irene Haas, NY Harcourt 1963. I'm sure I won't be the only one with this answer - Tatsinda is a young girl in the wonderful kingdom of Tatrajan. She is not native, but arrived in the kingdom as a baby, rescued from an eagle by an old huntsman. \"The trouble was that her hair was golden and her eyes were brown. All the other Tatrajanni ... had glittering white hair like snow crystals and eyes ... a cool greenish-blue. That was the way people were meant to look, they thought, and they considered Tatsinda handicapped and were sorry for her.\" There's more plot of course. Tatsinda loves the prince Tackatan, who defended her from teasing when they were children. The wise woman Tanda-nan gives her enough magic for one wish. Tatrajan is attacked by one of the Gadblangs, troll-like giants with leather clothes and stone shoes, who mine the precious mineral gleb.\n\nStumper C150 certainly sounds like Tatsinda from the solved list, although I haven't read it!\n\nI just wanted to send in the answer to stumper B150. The answer is TATSINDA by Elizabeth Enright, 1963. It looks like it might still be in print.\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to find a book that my Sixth Grade teacher read to our class in the mid-1960s that involved a journey to a distant land where streets were paved with something of no value in one land but that was as valuable as gold in the other--some kind of ore or rock used as paving material. That's about all I can remember of the story. Ring any bells?\n\nElizabeth Enright??, Tatsinda?? 1963. This is a really long shot, but the way you phrased it, that something of no value in\n\none land was like gold in the other, reminded me of the giant in Tatsinda who starts grabbing up the paving stones and cobblestones of the Tatrajanni, crying that now he'll be rich, because in the giants' land the \"greb\" that the paving is made of is very valuable. ??\n\nEnright, Elizabeth, Tatsinda. NY Harcourt 1963. Kind of a longshot, but the story is about a strange country, and the giants who invade it are after \"greb ore\" which they value but which is used in Tatsinda's country as gravel or to pave streets. Of course, the \"streets paved with gold\" trope is so common as to be a cliche, so there are many other possible answers, I'm sure!\n\n---\n\nThis was a library book I read in grade school in the early 1960's. An eagle (?) steals a baby and drops it on a mountain in the distance. The girl is adopted by a family who weaves carpets. There is an old wise woman who lives at the top of the mountain, and she grants each person in their lifetime 3 questions or something similar. When the girl becomes a young woman, she however is also granted a gift of magic from the old woman because she has been kind to her. The young woman has fallen in love with the prince of the mountain and asks for a gift to make him fall in love with her, which she will give him at his upcoming birthday party. However, as the party is taking place, trolls or ogres storm in and I believe they take the young woman with them. After the men of the mountain rescue her and she is riding back with the prince, he of course tells her he is in love with her. And then she asks him how he liked the present she gave him, whereupon he states that in the chaos he has not had time to open any of the presents yet. Therefore, he loved her without the need of magic.\n\nElizabeth Enright, Tatsinda. I'm pretty sure this is Tatsinda, especially if the poster remembers wonderful illustrations in feathery pastels.\n\nThe book is in fact Tatsinda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't tell you how many years I have wondered about this book! This was the best 2.00 I ever spent!!!! And after posting, I realized I had forgotten to mention the part about the people on the mountain all having white hair and blue eyes! Thank you to the solver of this mystery!!!!!!!!!! Thank you, thank you!!!\n\n---\n\nAn eagle steals a blonde, blue-eyed little girl from a farm in the valley and takes her to a mountain kingdom where everyone has the same color hair and eyes (gray eyes/silver hair I think) and she's the only blonde one. Kids tease her but the young prince pities her and tells them not to tease her for being different. That's the first chapter, it continues on as the girl grows, she's a peasant, he's a prince, I read it in the 70's.\n\nElizabeth Enright, Tatsinda. Again! See Solved Mysteries.\n\nTatsinda. Sounds exactly like the one that was just solved called Tatsinda. The poster should check out the solved pages under T and see if it's the same book.\n\nElizabeth Enright, Tatsinda. This is on the Solved pages under TATSINDA by Elizabeth Enright.\n\nElizabeth Enright, Tatsinda. It's Tatsinda again :) ! See the Solved Mysteries.\n\nTea Cake from Cakeville\n\nI was 5 in 1948 when we moved into a house in Los Angeles, and a book of stories had been left behind by the tenants before us. The book was very thick and made of newsprint. One of the stories was about the donut. I don't remember any other stories because this one was my absolute favorite. One day the king decided to visit the people of Cakeville. Well, they were so excited that they baked all their favorite cakes in honor of the king. Needless to say, the people were a hefty lot since all they ate was cake. The king sampled all the cakes and fell in love with them, so much so that he decreed no one except he was allowed to eat cake. The people had to bake their cakes and bring them to the town square for the king. If they were caught eating cake they would be put in prison. Well, as time went by the people of Cakeville got thinner and thinner and Dame Peters was worried for her son. One day she decided to cut out the center of her best cake. Pretty soon her son began to get fat again, which made her quite happy. All the people wanted to know how she managed to fatten up her son, so she told them. Soon all the townspeople were cutting the centers out of their cakes and everyone was happy again. Everyone that is except the king who became quite angry. He believed someone was stealing cake from him. He called all the people together and demanded to know why there were holes in his cakes. Dame Peters came forward and told him that by removing the centers, the cakes were better to eat. [something like that] and the king believed her. She told him she was removing the donut. So the king gave his approval and everyone in Cakeville lived happily ever after and that's how the donut got its name and hole. I would be most appreciative if anyone could find this story if not the entire book. Thank you.\n\nNo real proof this is it, but since there's no other guesses, maybe: Anon. Make-Believe Stories McLoughlin Brothers 1942 24mo, illustrations by Sari, some in colour\n\nI was browsing EBay and I think I may have found the Cakeville story. I got a little excited, since I never expected to find this stumper. Our Story Book. Akron: Saalfield, 1942 Partial Contents: Tea Cake from Cakeville, Lavendar Alligator, What Did the Bee Say?\n\nDear Harriett: Thank you so much for continuing to look for the story for me. I checked the eBay title and sent the seller an email. Unfortunately the story is not in Our Story Book. The other title, Make Believe Stories is a possibility so I'm requesting it through Interlibrary Loan. Once again, thank you. How long has it been since I requested that title? I'm guessing 2-3 years.\n\nVarious authors, Our Story Book, illustrated. Akron, Saalfield 1942. I have a copy of this book now, and I'm going to make the pitch for it again. The book matches in date and description. The first story is The Tea Cake from Cakeville, by Elaine Baldridge. It takes place in a town called Cakeville, where the people like to eat nothing but cake. \"The funny little women all wore large white caps and they grew so fat they began to look like little sailboats.\" They compete with each other to make the largest and richest cake, until the king happens to ride through town in his golden carriage on the way to the castle. Smelling something delicious, he sends his Prime Minister to Dame Peters tiny green cottage. She has just made \"a huge marshmallow cake with pink candies all over it\" for her little son Peterkin, to be his first cake, but thrilled to have the king interested, she brings the cake to him, and the other dames bring out their cakes. The king and his servants eat all the cake, \"getting frosting over their gold and purple robes\" and he orders his men to gather up all the cakes in Cakeville and take them to the castle. \"From now on no one must eat any cake or he will be put in prison. You must make the biggest, richest cakes you ever made or you will go to prison.\" says the king, and so it is. Every day the soldiers fill 15 large carts with cakes from the village, not letting any of people come near the pile of cakes \"as high as a house.\" The people make do with bread and begin to forget what cake tastes like. Dame Peters regrets that Peterkin has never tasted cake (the king having eaten his birthday cake) and at night she sneaks past the soldiers and steals back a chocolate cake she has just baked. \"She very carefully cut the middle out and hurried back to the cottage.\" The next day the castle servants eat all the cakes before the king has a chance, except the holed cake. When the king demands his cake, that's the only one left. The cook, to appease the king, says \"Please, your Majesty, it is supposed to be that way. It is a tea cake.\" Because the king is so hungry, the \"tea cake\" tastes better than ever, and he decides that all his cakes shall be tea cakes from now on. The people of Cakeville \"cut all the centers out of the cakes and became very fat and happy once more. ... That is the reason why so many tea cakes are made round with a hole in the center.\" Other stories are: Squeak, by B.H. Hand The Gift of Spring, by Myrtle Barbre The Lavender Alligator of the Purple River, by Jeanne Opie The Legend of the Ginseng, by Ruth Irwin The Windmill and the Tulips, by Margot Jackson Tommy's Teeny Tiny Pig, by Ida Danziger What Did the Bee Say, by I.L. Reisler Crocks of Gold, by Carol Ryrie Brink Sylvia's Autumn Gift, by Myrtle Barbre and several poems.\n\nStories We Like, 1942. I found this book on E-Bay and purchased it. It contains \"The Tea Cake from Cakeville\" and \"The Lavender Alligator\" Published by Saalfield in I believe 1942. I searched so long to find this book. Having this book read to me was one of the delights of my childhood. It has a picture on the front and back of a Lady Goose Wearing a hat & scarf and carrying an umbrella, looking into the window of a hat shop\n\nTears of the Dragon\n\nI recently learned that books that I had as a child were accidentally thrown away. I am hoping to replace them. So far I have located that titles and authors of four books, Harvey's Hideout by Russell Hoban, Miss Suzy by Miriam Young, The Cookie Tree by Jay Williams and Never Tease a Weasel. My mother got me these books through Parents Magazine Press when they first came out. The other books I cannot find because I don't have the titles and authors. I know they came from Parents Magazine. One book was about a boy and a dragon. In the story, the dragon cried and his tears created a river. The dragon transformed into a boat and the little boy sailed away in the dragon boat. The front cover was a picture of the oriental boy and the dragon.\n\nMaybe too recent ... Ming Ming and the Lantern Dragon, by J.E. Edwards, illustrated by P. Aitken, published Methuen 1981, 110 pages. \"Ming Ming is a Chinese boy living in a village. When all the people are starving because of a drought, Ming Ming determines to get the river to run again. He becomes involved with a river spirit, a giant Panda and the Sun Dragon. The Sun Dragon seems to reign supreme until Ming Ming gets the idea of turning all the people in a riverside village into the Dragon of the Thousand Eyes. They, together with the unknowing help of another river spirit, defeat the Sun Dragon. The rain clouds come in, the rivers fill again and all ends happily ever after. This is a Read Aloud book that should be welcomed by children everywhere.\" (Junior Bookshelf Feb/81 p.17)\n\nD55 dragon cries river: well, after finally having the wit to do a search with dragon and parents mag as keywords, would suggest - Tears of the Dragon, by Hirosuke Hamada, illustrated by Chihiro Iwasaki, published Parents Magazine Press, 1967 unpaginated. Translated from Ryuno Me No Namida, originally published by Kaisei Sha, Tokyo. \"A little boy wants the dragon who lives in the mountains nearby, to come to his birthday party despite warnings that the creature is very wicked. The little boy and dragon become friends and the hatred drains out of the dragon and turns to love; he cries tears and makes a river.\"\n\n---\n\nThis book is about an Asian (country?) boy who lives in a small village. Everyone is afraid of a dragon who lives on a mountain (or far away place) above the village. One day the boy decides to go visit the dragon and he learns that the dragon is quite lonely. They become friends. The version of the \"book\" that I remember is actually on large (place mat sized) picture cards with words on the back for the reader.\n\nKenneth Grahame, The Reluctant Dragon. This plot sounds exactly like The Reluctant Dragon (excerpted from, I think, The Golden Age)--except that the boy there is not Asian. Maybe a retelling?\n\nB184 Hamada Hirosuke, translated by Alvin Tresselt, Tears of the Dragon, illustrated by Iwasaki Chihiro. NY: Parents Magazine Press 1967. Well, this one involves an Asian country boy and befriending a dragon. It's on the solved list. \"Akito was the only boy in the village who did not believe that the great monster dragon that lived in the mountains would carry off bad children. He decided to find the dragon and invite him to his birthday party. His kindness made the dragon cry a river of tears that carried the boy on the dragons back down to the village and the dragon miraculously turned into a dragon boat for all the children to enjoy forever.\"\n\nTeaser and the Firecat\n\nLooking for a picture book I had as a child sometime in the 70's. In the story the moon falls from the sky and lands flat like a shining pancake on the ground. Then a group of owls come along pick it up and fly away with it then, throw it back up into the sky. Excited to see if you can find it!\n\nCat Stevens, Teaser and the Firecat, 1972. I just saw this book in a post at Vintage Kids Books My Kid Loves. The moon falls on a roof instead of the ground, but I think it's the one you're looking for.\n\nSOLVED: Cat Stevens, Teaser and the Firecat. Hey, Just took a peak and you found my book!! Thank you for doing what you do.\n\nTee-bo and the Great Hort Hunt\n\nBook (late 70s, early 80s) that featured a brother and sister and their dog that talked to them after all of them(?) ate special berries. The kids had saved a couple of berries just in case the effects of the first berries wore off. No one else can understand the dog. I think there was a series, but the book I read had them discover fairy-like people who had a special egg shaped rock made out of lapis laluzi. The dog was embarassed because he was making sarcastic comments and didn't realize the fairy people could understand him.\n\nWhitcomb, Mary B., Tee-Bo on the Trail of the Persnickety Prowler. (1975) This is the book. There is also a sequel, Tee-bo and the Great Hort Hunt.\n\nWhitcomb, Mary Burg, Tee-bo and the Great Hort Hunt. (1978) This is it! \"With the stone they are also able to discover the magical land behind the waterfall where the Horts - a small elf-like people - live.\" Thanks so much!\n\nTeddy B.B.\n\nDescription: A soft cover book from the 1950's about a teddy bear who falls out of a car window on an outing. He runs into several adventures trying to find his way back home but finally does. Remember a cute picture of him trying to climb up huge front steps. The cover is black & white with a picture of the bear.\n\nSOLVED: Lebeck, Oskar, Teddy B.B. This is kind of funny but I solved my own bookstumper! I thought the book was lost but was going through some old boxes & actually came across it. It is called Teddy B.B. & was a Surprise Dell Book published in 1950 by Western Printing & Lithographing Co. An original story by Oskar Lebeck. Illustrated by Dan Noonan. It cost 10 cents! I would be curious to know if there are any reprints available as a couple of the pages are half torn out. I'm guessing not, but you never know. Just wanted to let you know this is solved. That's all I needed to do to find the book was to list it as a bookstumper! Thanks for all your help. You have a great service.\n\nTeddy Bear Habit\n\nThe book I am looking for was read by me in grade school in the early 1970s. It was considered a late grade school / early teen book by our grade school librarian. I remember the cover of this soft bound book to be pink or purple, and the rough subject matter was as follows: something about growing up as a child in the family of an abstract painter dad who produced his paintings by hurling paint or other substances through the air at the canvas. I belive that the dad used spoons to lob the gobs of paint. for some reason I believe that it was set somewhere in New York City. I know this is not much to go on but hopefully someone out there will recognize the story. thanks to any or all who can help.\n\n#A126--Abstract painter dad: In the Georgie Stable books, The Teddy Bear Habit and Rich and Famous, by James Lincoln Collier, Georgie and his father live in Greenwich Village. Georgie's father draws comic books for a living but longs to be an artist like Jackson Pollack or Andy Warhol. I believe Rich and Famous appears on the \"Solved Mysteries\" page.\n\n---\n\nThe book I'm looking for is a mystery/adventure with a definate comical tone concerning a teddy bear that has jewels stashed inside it. The hero is a boy, and the bad guy wears a fez. I think it was illustrated with black and white line drawings, was probably published in the 1970's, and was geared toward middle school ages.\n\n#J39--Jewels in a teddy bear: The Teddy Bear Habit, by James Lincoln Collier. Its sequel Rich and Famous is on the solved page and, since I seem to remember solving this one before, I'm pretty sure it is, too.\n\nCollier, James Lincoln, The Teddy Bear Habit. NY Grosset 1967. This is on the solved list, and seems like a reasonable match.\n\nJames Lincoln Collier, The Teddy Bear Habit. \"Twelve-year-old George Stable wants to be a rock star someday,\n\nbut he gets horrible stage fright - unless he has his old teddy bear with him. Hiding the teddy in his guitar seems like a brilliant idea until George discovers that someone has hidden jewels in the stuffing of his beloved bear. Quirky yet believable characters and a funky setting make this one a winner all around.\"\n\nI submitted the stumper J39 Jewels in teddy bear, and I believe it has been solved with \"the Teddy Bear Habit\". I had forgotten about the guitar but knew that was the one as soon as I read it. I looked at the solved mysteries entry and was struck by what different people remember - I had no recollection of the artist father, and they didn't mention the teddy bear! (I tried searching the solved section before submitting, but didn't realize I needed to search each section individually.....) I'm looking forward to sharing this book with my kids - especially my daughter who wants to be a rock star!\n\n---\n\nBook about an old teddy bear dated before 1970. The cover had just as drawing of a teddy bear missing and eye, hardcover not jacket. The story was about the teddy and a little boy in an apartment, I think the Teddy Bear might have gotten lost. It's not \"Charles\"or \"Courdory\"\n\nJames Lincoln Collier, The Teddy Bear Habit, 1967. There's a missing teddy bear and an apartment in this one. Check it out in Solved Mysteries to see if its the one you're looking for.\n\nTeddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow\n\nI'm looking for a book about the \"teddy bear of bumpkin hollow\". It was a largish size book (12X12 or so) and I swear it had flocked pages to feel the bear's fur. But maybe that was my imagination? I had it as a child in the early 70's, but suspect that it might be older.\n\nI found T31 in the LC online catalog. Teddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow, by Sharon Boucher, Rand McNally, 1948\n\nTeddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow is always late coming back from errands, because he stop and plays. So his mother sends him on an errand, tells him to be sure to come back right away, and then plans a trip to his grandma's house to start promptly at the time Teddy Bear is supposed to come home. Well, he comes back late again, and finds a babysitter there. He cries big tears. The next morning, Mama gives him cookies from grandma (these are what impressed *me* the most, they looked like giant iced plates!), and he learns his lesson and is on time henceforth.\n\n---\n\nA young bear misbehaves and goes to his Grandmother's house through the woods. He was told not to. If he did, he would miss out on some kind of treat. The last page was the young bear and his Grandmother with a plate full of pink cookies.\n\nI sometimes confuse stumpers for this book for Little Bear's Visit by Else Homelund Minarik, illustrated by Maurice Sendak(An I Can Read Book). But I think this one is Teddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow by Sharon Boucher, illustrated by Dean Bryant, published Rand McNally Elf Books 1948. The little bear misses out on a visit to grandma because he is always late, then is consoled by having her visit him and make giant cookies for him.\n\n---\n\nA little bear lived with his Mama and Papa Bear and was always misbehaving. His parents kept warning him that he should mind them. One day they told him to be in from playing at a certain time or he would be sorry. He returned late and found that Mama and Papa had gone over on another mountain to visit Grandma and Grandpa Bear. He was heartbroken because he loved going to their house. Cousin Amanda Bear was at his house to babysit while Mama and Papa were gone. He cried himself to sleep he was so sorry and disappointed. When Mama and Papa came home they brought cookies from Grandma. This is a precious book with beautiful word pictures. It was about the size of a Golden Book. It also had pretty pictures, too. I used it in my kndergarten class over 30 years ago. I have a feeling it was printed much earlier. Help me, please.\n\nI think this one is Teddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow by Sharon Boucher, illustrated by Dean Bryant, published Rand McNally Elf Books 1948 (similar to Little Golden Books). The little bear misses out on a visit to grandma because he is always late, then is consoled by having her visit him and make giant cookies for him. I sometimes confuse stumpers for this book for Little Bear's Visit by Else Homelund Minarik, 1961, illustrated by Maurice Sendak (An I Can Read Book).\n\nRichard Scarry, Richard Scarry's Best Story Book Ever. The Richard Scarry book with the Pierre the Bear story that I inherited from my grandfather and still have has 4 stories inside this book. It has a drawing of Pierre on the cover reading a book in front of the fire same as the first picture in the beginning of his story. The first story in this book is the City Mouse and the Country Mouse, then a story about a female crow with a piece Swiss cheese and a fox finally sweat talks her out of the piece of cheese, then the Pierre the Bear story, \"In a wind swept cabin way up North lived brave Pierre the Bear. He lived all alone.\" And the last story is about a Duck that didn't like water until he had to rescue his friends. My favorite book as a kid and probably the reason I think bears are to human to hunt.\n\n---\n\nMy sister remembers this book being read to her when she was in preschool in the early 1970's. Her recollection is a story about a little bear who runs an errand for his mother. His mother tells him to take the long path, not the shortcut. He gets into trouble when he doesn't listen to his mother and takes the shortcut. He may have fallen in a stream or gotten stung by a bear, but my sister is uncertain about these details. Thanks so much for your help!\n\nI don't remember the title or the author, but I do remember that the bear gets into poison ivy. He gathers an armful of what he thinks are beautiful leaves and ends up with poison ivy all over himself.\n\nKathyn Jackson , The Golden Book of 365 Stories, 1998, reprint. After doing some Google research on a bear and poison ivy, I'm wondering if this may be the book. It is illustrated by Richard Scarry. There is a story about Hasty Bear who doesn't listen to his mother and picks a bouquet of poison ivy instead of flowers. Does anyone know if the bear takes a short-cut, though? The name \"Hasty Bear\" does imply that he is in a hurry.\n\nKathryn Jackson, Hasty Bear, 1955, copyright. This is in \"The Golden Book of 365 Stories\" by Katheryn Jackson, illustrated by Richard Scarry. It's the story for October 14th. His mother asked him to pick some pretty leaves for her. Hasty Bear was in such a hurry, he never heard her say \"but don't pick the shiny, red, three leaved kind, because they are poison ivy and will make you itch\". Of course, that's what he brings home. At the end of the story, he waits a whole minute to make sure he hears everything she says.\n\nSharon Boucher, Teddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow, 1948, copyright. I showed my sister the story of Hasty Bear in The Golden Book of 365 Stories, but it wasn't the one she remembered. Then I contacted the granddaughter of my sister's nursery school teacher, and she came up with Teddy Bear of Bumpkin Hollow. That was the one! My sister had misremembered about the bear taking the long path (he was actually supposed to take the short-cut), but the mystery is solved. Thanks for the help - it's a great website!\n\nTeddy Bear Twins\n\nHi! I hope you can help me, I'm looking for a book, and I don't know the name, and I'm not sure of the publisher! I'm 32 and I remember the book as a child being about the same size as a Golden Book, not positive it was though. The story was about two teddy bear brothers who go to town (for a vacation, maybe?) and run into a series of misadventures. I vaguely remember a picture of them in a taxi! And I believe one of the teddy bears was named Hal. Any info would be appreciated!\n\nFor T56 the name of the book is The Teddy * Bear Twins and it was published by Rand McNally Elf book. The copy I have was published in 1965. The bears' names were Floppy and Flip. They go to town on a train and get a haircut, ride in a taxi that has a flat, ride in a canoe that tips over then go back to the hotel to have a shower. I love this book and so do my children!\n\nWing, Helen. The Teddy Bear Twins. Illustrated by Marjorie Cooper. Elf Book #8453, #8637, & #8722. 1965.\n\nthe story is about Floppy and Flip two bears a rhyming story they go on adventures That is all I have??\n\nThe Solved Mysteries page has Teddy Bear Twins featuring Flippy & Flop, a Rand McNally Elf book. Close enough?\n\nTee Vee Humphry\n\nAdventures (or misadventures) of a young boy who would love nothing more than working for a TV station (or something close to that). I read this in the 70s when I was in grade school. Once the boy was given the assignment to find an empty milk bottle, instead of drinking a bottle of milk to obtain an empty bottle, he took a long long cab ride in search of a milk bottling factory... When he was given the role of someone shot by a bullet, he got up and dust himself when the camera was still rolling... I also remember that he became the co-host of an animal/pet show at one point.\n\nA188 Lewellen, John [Llewellyn] Tee Vee Humphrey illus by Kurt Werth Knopf c1957 Weekly Reader edition 1958 television broadcasting - juvenile fiction\n\nTeenie Weenies\n\nold illustrated childrens book about a land of little people. illustrated childrens book with exceptional photographic style illustrations. The book is about a group of small people who live in a shoe and I remember one scene of them lounging around an old fashioned sink and trying to pull up the chain of the stopper.\n\nMary Norton, Borrowers Series, 1950s-1960s. This sounds like the Borrowers series. The borrower family lived in a shoe in The Borrowers Afield, and something similar to the sink incident happened in The Borrowers Afloat. The illustrations by Beth and Jo Krush in the US editions were verey detailed, though I wouldn't call them photographic.\n\nDonahey, William, Adventures of the Teenie Weenies. Chicago, Reilly 1920. The illustrations for these are closer to photographic, being very detailed, not scribbly (like the Krush illos) and coloured & shaded. \"This is the first of the large Teenie Weenie books and we are introduced to these folks who live in a shoe-house under a rose bush, in a neat little village hidden away in the midst of a thicket.\"\n\nJohn Peterson, The Littles. Your description sounds a lot like a series of books I read to my daughter when she was little. \"The Littles\" by John Peterson and illustrated by Roberta Clark. Published by Scholastic. I am not sure of the exact first printing date, but you could probably find that out on your own. Hope this helps!!\n\nAlthough the Clock family lives in a boot during The Borrowers Afield, the Borrowers series by author Mary Norton is probably not the one being sought. Beth and Joe Krush's black and white line illustrations are detailed, but not photographic, and there is no illustration matching the stumper requester's description in any of the five books in the series. The \"similar to the sink incident\" in The Borrowers Afloat is an illustration of the family sliding down a cord suspended in the drain in the floor of the wash house, while a friend hoists the drain's metal grating aloft. Also, the first book, The Borrowers, was written in 1952, so the series may not be \"old\" enough for the stumper requester.\n\nThe Littles series by author John Lawrence Peterson and illustrator Roberta Carter Clark is also probably not \"old\" enough, since the first book, The Littles, was published in 1967. I have not read every book in the series (at least eleven titles by Peterson, followed by at least five \"Littles first readers\" adaptations by author Teddy Slater and illustrator Jacqueline Rogers), so I don't know if the illustration described is in any of the books, but I do remember one interesting fact about the Littles that may help the stumper requester decide if this is the sought series. The Littles have TAILS covered with fluffy, luxuriant fur. If your little people don't have tails, they're not the Littles.\n\nWilliam Donahey, author/illustrator, The Teenie Weenies (and nine sequels) 1916-1945. I've never read William Donahey's Teenie Weenies series, but you can see examples of his work (and covers from his books) on this website. The illustrations are certainly detailed, vividly colored, carefully shaded, and nearly photographic in quality. If you scroll down the page, you can see an illustration of the shoe house on the cover of the book Teenie Weenie Town and in the map of the town just a little further down the page. The first book, The Teenie Weenies, was published in 1916, and the last book, Teenie Weenie Neighbors, was published in 1945, so this series is definitely \"old\"! I think this may be the series you're looking for!\n\nTeeny Tiny Woman\n\nAs a child I had a favorite book. It was about a lady (maybe Old Mother Hubbard) and she went to her cupboard to get her poor dog a bone, but in the meantime the story goes on and that part I can't remember. But the very ending is she starts, oh, I just remembered--- she goes to her cupboard to get herself something to eat and there's nothing there. She goes out and steals the dogs bone from his dish outside. Then at the end of the story she starts hearing at first quietly and then louder and louder. \"Give me my bone, give me my bone, my bone, my bone, my bone! And she's hiding in the closet\n\n(one of those old wardrobe type) and the dog opens the door hollering this at her, or something like that. I have been looking and looking for this book. I sure hope you can help me. Thank You.\n\nThe folk tale is The Teeny Tiny Woman. Our copy is illustrated by Margot Zemach and is printed in a teeny tiny format. Many other authors and illustrators have attacked this creepy tale, including Harriet Ziefert and Paul Galdone. This has also been published under slightly varied titles, such as The Little Tiny Woman.\n\nTelevision Book of Hesperus\n\nI can't remember the title or the author, but the book I am looking for is about an old car that is out of date. He meets newer cars and trucks along the way. It is a picture book I had as a child and want to read it to my infant son. It would be great if you can find it. Thank You.\n\nThere's a book by Ingri & Edgar Parin d'Aulairecalled THE TWO CARS that features an old car and a new car who share a garage. It was published in 1955, so this is all relative. The old car is boxy and tall and red; the old car is sleek and low and green. They go along together with the old car lagging in every way until the new car meets the traffic cop, and after that their fortunes change. When they get home at last, the old car says to the new car: \"You won the race, but not the praise. I still think I am the best car on the road. But you will be a fine car, too, when you get older...\" This could be it! But 1st editions are pricey, and I'm not sure how many reprints are available. On second thought, I do not think The Two Cars is the book being sought here...\n\nI'm wondering is C-21, out-of-date car, could be the Wonder Book All in a Day's Work. It doesn't match exactly, but has elements in common, and maybe the story will ring a bell. A \"little old car\" (looks like a red model-T with a yellow cloth roof) goes down the street. He meets a \"big, new green car\" that can't start and gives him a push. He meets a \"great big trailer truck\" and brings him gas. Then he meets a \"blue pick-up truck\" and helps him fix a flat tire. None of the others thank him, but he just says \"It is all in a day's work.\" In winter one day, he's driving along the road and flips off and turns over. He's convinced he's done for, but along come the three vehicles he helped, and they get him out of the ditch, saying things like \"Oh, and I forgot to pay you for the gas.\" And the little old car goes off down the road. The story is by Caroline D. Emerson; pictures by Sergio Leone. The copy I have is c1964 by Wonder, division of Grosset & Dunlap.\n\nProbably too late, and English, but there's The Old Car by Elisabeth Borchers, illustrated by Werner Maurer, published London, Blackie 1967 \"The old car is sad and shy because it (or he) is different from the others,\n\nwith his old-fashioned horn and high weels. So he goes off alone through seacoast and jungle, into the desert. There the animals speak to him kindly and give him confidence. And when he returns to the town, his owner, Mr. Flups, is waiting to greet him, with two tears in his eyes. With strong yet dreamlike pictures, in appropriate colours.\" (Best Children's Books of 1967)\n\nAnother possible is Little Old Automobile, written and illustrated by Marie Hall Ets, published Viking 1948. \"What finally happened to a little old automobile which refused to give anyone or anything time to get out of its way. Marie Ets at her most amusing. Picture Book age.\" (HB Ju./48 p.231 pub.ad)\n\nC21 car out of date: here's another, though perhaps too long - Mat and Mandy and the Little Old Car, by Ruth Simon, illustrated by Lisl Weil, published Crowell 1953, 110 pages. \"Younger children will enjoy reading for themselves this gay account of a family's escape from the summer heat in a battered old car that manages to carry them up the little brown hills and the big blue mountaints of California. Says Mat, 'Our car is not new. Our car is not big. But our little old car can go anywhere it wants!'\" (HB Feb/53 p.47)\n\nI remember a book from childhood that I think had a similar theme. I thought it was a Little Golden Book called Hesperus yetI could never find it in any searches! Now it turns out it was a Bonnie Book called The Television Book of Hesperus. I wish I could find a copy to verify my memories of this story-it might match your inquire.\n\nBonnie Books had a series of \"Television Books\", so named for the moving wheel that changed pictures on the front cover. Hesperus is from this series, NY: John Martin's House, Bonnie Book, 1949.\n\nTelevision Book of Hesperus\n\nPossibly Golden Book - title \"Hesperus\" (sp) about a huge family and a run-down Model-T type car. The car w/ family is on the cover, I think. Thank you.\n\nWalsh, Morris. There are several titles - don't know if they're all the same or different: Hesperus (1947) / Hesperus Was An Automobile (1948) / Hesperus (1968) / Hesperus: The Story Of A Jalopy (1966) \"A tired old jalopy gets a new lease on lfe with a new owner.\"\n\nThe Television Book of Hesperus, 1949, approximately. A Bonnie Book, not a Golden Book, this one is about a junkyard car named Hesperus and the big family that drove around in him. I haven't read it since I was little, so the memories are fuzzy, but the cover had a wheel you could turn and change the pictures in a screen over top of the car. This is also in Solved Mysteries under T.\n\nTell Me, Cat\n\nThere was a book I adored as a child. I had this book in the 60's or early 70's. I was around the age of 8-12. It was hardcover with not many pages, maybe 30 maximum but that is one detail I am very unsure of. Each page contained a different fictional story about a cat. There was an actual photo of each cat and embroidered illustrations that went along with the story. I remember an orange persian with tufts of hair between his ears. But the main story I remember was a black cat named Cap't Jack who sailed to Zanzibar and back. I also remember a kitten who got in trouble because it played with yarn...it might have been two kittens. I also remember a cat who climbed a tree and the embroidered illustration was a tree with claw marks. It was an easy reading book.\n\nPossibly TELL ME, CAT (A Big Golden Book) by Ellen Fisher, Stitchery by Virginia Tiffany. I have Two Kittens with embroidery, stitched by Tiffany, and photographs very much like description so possibly she did several with other authors.\n\nEsther Averill, Jenny Goes to Sea, 1957. This doesn't sound exactly like the stumper, but it does have cats and there is a\n\ntrip to Zanzibar.\n\nTo the person who first guessed at this, I would like more info about the book you listed...Two Kittens who is the author and I'm wondering if you would possibly email me a photo or scan of your book. It is a book I'd be interested in purchasing if I can find a copy\n\nHere's what I found on that: Marjory Schwalje, Two Kittens. Whitman, Racine, 1966. Tell-A-Tale Book #2525. 28 pages. Stitchery by Virginia Tiffany. Photographs by ZFA, Duesseldorf. Tell-a-Tale books are even smaller than Little Golden Books. I can find you a good copy for $20 if you'd like.\n\nI agree with the first suggestion that this might be Tell Me, Cat. It's an oversized book with poems, embroidery and photographs of cats.\n\nEllen Fisher, Tell Me Cat. Solved!! It is Tell me Cat. I found the book on ebay!! Thanks to you who helped.\n\nTell Me a Mitzi\n\nA book that is probably from the 70's/80's. It goes through a huge description on how the small child gets the younger sibling ready because he wants to go to a relative's house? Very descriptive and goes through each step, put on right sock then left, put on right shoe, feed baby. Landscape and in color.\n\nLore Segal, Tell me a Mitzi. Definitely the one. \"So Mitzi lifted Jacob out of the crib and put him on the floor and she put on his shirt and his overalls and his socks. She put on his right shoe and his left shoe an dhis snowsuit and his mittens and tied his hat under his chin and said, 'NOW let's go.'\"'\n\nLore Segal (Harriet Pincus, Illustrator), Tell me a Mitzi 1970. This might be it... the book contains 3 stories, and in the firsst, Mitzi and her little brother Jacob decide to go to Grandma's house before her parents get up: the descriptions of feeding and dressing Jacob are very detailed. The illustrations are very bright-colored, but it is set in the city, not the country. You can see a picture of the cover here: http://www.librarything.com/work/45497/covers/.\n\nLore Segal, Tell me a Mitzi. Maybe this one? In one of the stories a child wakes up the baby, dresses hims completely, takes him downstairs to the front of the apartment building, and tries to take a taxi to grandmas house, all without the mothers knowledge. When they cant get a taxi she has to go back upstairs and reverse the proceedings, putting the baby back in bed. The mother is surprised at how tired they both are that day!\n\nI have been looking for this for YEARS!!! Your readers out there have solved it!! I can now purchase this book and feel like my book collection will be complete. Tell me a Mitzi is the correct book!! Thank you so much!!\n\nTell Me, Mr. Owl\n\nI'm looking for a Halloween book I constantly checked out of my elementary school library (to the point of embarassment as 6th grade approached) in the mid 60's. All I can recall is that it was dark blue or purple, probably published in the 50's or early 60's, and was about a boy who had to walk through the woods at night to get to a Halloween party. I think one of the illustrations at the end of the book was of the boy looking through a window at the other kids attending the party. I also think there may have been an owl somehow involved. I would love to find a copy of this book so I can get back to obsessing about more important things like the impending war...or Meg Ryan. Okay...just Meg Ryan. Thanks.\n\nDoris Van Liew Foster, Tell Me, Mr. Owl, 1957. Could this be it? The HALLOWEEN ADVENTURE OF LITTLE BOY & MR. OWL.\n\nMy stumper has been solved. Tell Me, Mr. Owl isn't exactly as I remembered it, but it's been over thirty years. Still, I'm really glad you found it for me and I've been telling all my friends about your site. Now that I've achieved my final goal, I realize I should've set the bar a tad higher goalwise.\n\nTell No One\n\nDoctor searching for lover he wrongly believed was murdered years previous. 1st chapter is sad couple at private cabin on lake,swimming at night and get attacked.He believes her dead as her father,a cop, identifies her body.Years later he gets email telling him to log on to website and he does and sees a street.At certain time he sees her looking at camera before running away.Book is about him searching for truth and her whilst getting in trouble with police etc.Her dad faked her death as she had witnessed a murder committed by either someone in power or a son to someone who was. Please help!\n\nThe book is TELL NO ONE by Harlan Coben. It came out in hardback in 2001 from Delacorte Press, but is now available in paperback. TELL NO ONE was the first book by Coben that was NOT part of his Myron Bolitar mystery series.\n\nThe book stumper number is D168 and its been solved thanks! I lent my mother-in-law the book and she lent it to someone else because she forgot it was mine so now I know what it is called she can buy me another copy. Thank again.\n\nTell Us Your Secret\n\nA friend recommended this site as a way to track down the title of a book I would like to re-read. The information I remember is very vague, but here goes: a it was arelatively recently published book (probably sometime in the 1980s), about a girl going to a weekend writer's conference for teens. Her parents don't want her to go but she does anyway. Her parents are Holocaust survivors, and part of the book deals with that. I had thought it was by Eve Bunting, but when I checked on a list of titles she had written, none sounded familiar. I hope this is enough info to track down the title; I would really liketo find it and read it again.\n\nI think this is Barbara Cohen, Tell Us Your Secret (Bantam,1989)\n\nHello. I was the person who asked about W24, the book about the Writers' conference. I just wanted to let you know that the answer was absolutely right!! Thanks so much for your help; this is a wonderful site for book-lovers.\n\nTen Kids, No Pets\n\nThis book is probably still somewhere in my library, but I can't seem to locate it. I read it in 1990 or 1991 and it was fairly new then. It's about a young girl (I want to say her name is Calandra) who discovers a secret room in the house her family has recently moved into. In the room, she discovers a diary of a girl who lived there 100 years earlier. I seem to remember she enters the room through a closet of some sort. Anyway, she reads all about this girl's life, and at one point she makes old-fashioned valentines like the kind the girl describes in her diary. I think she also keeps the room a secret from the rest of her family and wants it for her own private space.\n\nThis sounds like The Four-Story Mistake by Elizabeth Enright. Check out other comments and memories on the Solved Mysteries page to confirm.\n\nThanks very much for your response! Unfortunately, the book I'm looking for is definitely not The Four Story Mistake. Those details don't ring a bell, although some parts do sound similar. Additional details: I think the name of the girl who wrote the diary was Celia or Cecily. I think the main character (Calandra?) was a part of a large family, and that the bit about the secret room and the diary may have been just a small part of a much larger story. I also seem to remember something about Christmas, having a country Christmas, an orphaned deer, a Halloween party and possibly hiding a rabbit in the secret room. Love the site!\n\nG51 Girl finds secret room in new house sounds like M107 Millowner's daughter's diary\n\nHi there, I'm the original searcher for G51. Curiosity got the better of me, and I went looking through my old bedroom for this book. I eventually found it packed away with the Baby-sitters Club series. It's called Ten Kids, No Pets and it's by Ann M. Martin. Interestingly, the secret room doesn't figure that prominently in the book! Thanks very much for posting my query and giving suggestions as to what it might be. :o)\n\nTen Tales Calculated to Give You Shudders\n\nI stumbled on your Stump the Bookseller page this morning and am hoping you can lend me a hand with a short story I'd like to find again. In the book that we had, one of the other stories was The Monkey's Paw. This other story featured a boy who lived in near a cemetery with his grandmother. He plays with some children in the cemetery. For reasons various and sundry, the social workers come and take him away from his grandmother. At the end of the story, he comes back, all grown up, and you find out his playmates were really ghosts. It was a sweet story, and I'd like to read it again. Any ideas? I know The Monkey's Paw has probably appeared in any number of anthologies, so it might not be a helpful clue. Thanks. Love your site. I suspect I'll be spending more money than I should pretty soon.\n\nG17 this one for sure - the story is Floral Tribute by Robert Bloch, first published in Wierd Tales in 1949, and probably anthologised umpteen times since. My copy is in The Devil's Generation, edited by Vic Ghidalia, Lancer, 1973. Eddie is raised by his grandmother Hannah Morse, who lives \"right in the back of the cemetery\" and sends him over the fence to get flowers for the table. His friends are Joe and Susie, and his grandmother's visitors include Sam Gates, a Civil War soldier. Eddie comes back after being invalided out of the army (WWII) and finds his grandmother the same, till she sends him to get flowers again, from her grave. Sweet sad story.\n\nCan I suggest in the same vein a children's book The Gathering Room by Colby Rodowsky, about Mudge, a little boy whose father has a caretaking job at an old Victorian cemetery. Mudge plays with Dorro, a little girl who died at age 10. Other ghosts are the Captain, the Butterfly Lady who recites poetry, and the Judge.\n\nRoss Olney (editor), SHUDDERS (a.k.a. TEN TALES CALCULATED TO GIVE YOU SHUDDERS)'\n\nfrom 1972. The *story* sought in G17 has already been identified, but in case questioner also wants to refind the original book, the only anthology which contains *both* Bloch's \"Floral Tribute\" and Jacobs' \"Monkey's Paw\" is the Whitman hc juvenile anthology SHUDDERS ed. Ross Olney (1972), so presumably that'\\''s the one where the questioner read the Bloch story. (Match found via THE SUPERNATURAL INDEX by Mike Ashley and William Contento Greenwood Press, 1995).\n\nThis may be the anthology wanted - Ten Tales Calculated to Give You SHUDDERS, edited by Ross R. Olney, published Whitman 1972. Cover picture in blue/green tones shows teenage girl and boy looking b"
