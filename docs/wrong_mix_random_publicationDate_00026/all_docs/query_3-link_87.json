All rights reserved.\n\nTo the Isaac Asimov home page\n\nTo the Isaac Asimov FAQ\n\nTo Jenkins' Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov\n\nIntroduction\n\nThough perhaps best known throughout the world for his science fiction, Isaac Asimov was also regarded as one of the great explainers of science. His essays exemplified his skill at making complex subjects understandable, and were written in an unformal style, liberally sprinkled with personal anecdotes that endeared him to a legion of faithful readers.\n\nIt was all a labor of love; in particular Asimov often remarked that of all his writing, his essays for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction were his favorite, despite the fact that he received the lowest word-rate payment for them. From November 1959 to February 1992, an essay of his appeared in the magazine every month, without fail.\n\nAsimov didn't stop with his F&SF essays, however. With the advent of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in 1977, he began a series of editorials that appeared at the beginning of each issue. He also wrote a regular series of science articles for American Way (the magazine of American Airlines), SciQuest (the magazine of the American Chemical Society), and the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. In addition he wrote essays and introductions for literally hundreds of magazines, newspapers, books, and trade publications. All together he wrote over 1600 essays.\n\nWith such a huge collection of essays, it can pose a problem for the reader who remembers a piece that Asimov wrote, but can't recall the source. Those who haven't read a great many essays may want to know if Asimov ever wrote an essay on a particular subject. And then there are the Asimov completists who want to read everything that Asimov ever wrote, but lose sleep at night worrying that they might have missed something. Where do they turn?\n\nTo that end, we have compiled a list of every known essay by Asimov, together with a brief description of its subject, and listed the source in which the essay originally appeared, as well as any collections of Asimov's in which it appeared. Please note that the emphasis is on known, since there are undoubtedly some we have missed. We have included every essay that has appeared in Asimov's collections, as well as a good number of those that have never been collected. Also included are introductions Asimov wrote for other books, though in this department we probably have missed quite a few.\n\nNotes on the listings\n\nThere are some essays that do not appear in any collection and are not readily available, so that the authors haven't read them yet. For those essays the subject field is left blank.\n\nAsimov compiled a list of his F&SF essays on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of his first essay, in the November 1978 issue of F&SF, and reprinted (slightly updated) in the collection The Road to Infinity. That list is ordered alphabetically according to the title of the essay, and includes a designation of the collection in which each essay appears as well as a very brief subject description for each essay. We have used those descriptions, but have added to them in some places, as well as added our own descriptions for essays published since his list appeared. In order to distinguish between his descriptions and ours, we preceded all of our additions with a virgule (also known as a slash, \"/\"). Note that it is only the F&SF essay descriptions that are affected by this.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times essay titles are sometimes followed by a designation such as \"(V4)\". This indicates the section and page where the essay appeared in the newspaper. The L.A. Times essays for which the exact date of publication has not yet been determined are listed with a range of dates within which they appeared, either 1987-1989 or 1990-1992.\n\nSources:\n\nHere are five series in which Asimov's essays regularly appeared, with the remainder grouped together under \"Various Sources\". The essays are listed chronologically within groups.\n\nEssay lists ordered by source:\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine American Way Magazine The Los Angeles Times Syndicate SciQuest, the Magazine of the American Chemical Society Various Sources\n\nSubjects:\n\nWhat is truly remarkable about Asimov's body of nonfiction is not only its sheer volume, but its great breadth and diversity, and this is reflected in the essay subjects. Though he concentrated on the sciences, and especially loved astronomy, you will find that there aren't many areas of human knowledge that he ignored. The subject groupings here begin with the broad bibliographic categories, and end with some somewhat more specialized areas.\n\nSometimes Asimov wrote more than one essay on the same subject, in order to update an essay once new information became available, or simply revisit a topic that he had written about long ago. The essays within each subject area are arranged so that, to the extent possible, essays about the same or related topics are grouped together.\n\nEssay lists ordered by subject:\n\npsychology society history geography anthropology economics and overpopulation fine arts literature writing issues in science mathematics and computers astronomy physics chemistry geology biology zoology physiology microbiology robotics technology about himself religion and creationism women rationality intelligence politics speech television and film science fiction Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine fantasy miscellaneous topics\n\nIndex of essays ordered by subjects:\n\npsychology\n\nsociety\n\nhistory\n\ngeography\n\nanthropology\n\neconomics and overpopulation\n\nfine arts\n\nliterature\n\nwriting\n\nissues in science\n\nmathematics and computers\n\nastronomy\n\nphysics\n\nchemistry\n\ngeology\n\nbiology\n\nzoology\n\nphysiology\n\nmicrobiology\n\ntechnology\n\nrobotics\n\nabout himself\n\nreligion and creationism\n\nwomen\n\nrationality\n\nintelligence\n\npolitics\n\nspeech\n\ntelevision and film\n\nscience fiction\n\nIsaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\n\nfantasy\n\nmiscellaneous topics\n\nEssays about psychology\n\npsychology is an important science that we all know but don't understand narcissism is analogous to humans studying the brain encouraging characteristics associated with creativity dream interpretation creative dream experiences\n\nEssays about society\n\ntime travel into the past wouldn't be as fun as some may expect the implications of immortality cryogenics and immortality what life would be like if medical science gives humans immortality /vices of modern cities the easy tendency to forget the past arguments for suicide and euthanasia choosing your future the irrational desire for gold high illiteracy;

Sprague de Camp detailed requirements for being a prolific writer words and writing are important for scientific progress the writer's responsibility to further the scientific approaches to problems evolution of the word \"shuttle\" from arrow to spacecraft\n\nEssays about issues in science\n\nthe precision of numerical values in science /lighter than air flight knowledge often spans different branches of science; e.g. astrochemistry making a computer like the brain publishing is central to science; a reader predicts an asteroid will hit Earth American students are scientifically illiterate personal problems can cause misery to anyone, even scientists early scientists had little formal education, but read books concentration has advanced science and kept sanity language is the ultimate tool of science knowledge of science can be valuable to anyone science books and journals cooperation of scientists knowledge usually has some usefulness, either bad or good scientists must teach science and the public must learn it reprint of \"What's Fueling the Popular Science Explosion?\", Aug-80 establishing a science corps to encourage interest in science ten science books that every nonscientist should read reasons society needs to have general knowledge of science saving the planet must be the primary goal of science creativity/encouraging scientific creativity changing scientific theory great scientists in history great scientists Franklin's lightning rod/and its impact on rational thinking poison gas/the social responsibility of scientists scientific inspiration /integrity and dishonesty in science the reason for Nobel prize delays debate on the supercollider experimental data proven to be wrong acoustic and electronic types of noise accidents sometimes trigger scientific advances Galileo protected his right of discovery by a secret code scientific knowledge is valuable for its own sake Nobel prizes can be too late for the short-lived famous stories about scientist's extreme concentration true advances in science are often hard to sell terminology: changing natural philosophy to science don't try to limit the building of knowledge science polices itself and mostly avoids scandal the lunar landing provided the universal joy of intellectual discovery the result of scientific discoveries often cannot be predicted there may be a grain of truth in folk tales belief in science being useful started with kite experiments advances in art and science are often complementary arguments against slowing scientific research science adds to and enhances the simple beauty we see occasional misuse of science shouldn't stop the search for knowledge serendipity in scientific discovery arguments for support and funding for science and research the Chernobyl disaster and its effects on world nuclear future magic is more exciting than science because it is unpredictable\n\nEssays about mathematics and computers\n\nlogarithms logarithms computers /computers and thinking beneficial uses of computers simplifying spelling with computers computer interfaces that use speech computers analyze sports statistics computing with molecules a description of computer hardware and bugs the promise of future computers targeting mail and messages using computer technology the history leading up to computers a computer in charge of everything computers aid man's abilities and will not act against him advances in computers will change our lives even more sharing of information in a world network (ala the Internet?) computers and robots will change the hotel environment Asimov's troubles with learning the quirks of personal computers the fear of learning about computer technology the word processor improved appearance but didn't speed writing perhaps the computer can help simplify spelling rules can our ubiquitous computers get out of human control? the influence of the computer on future crime computers will change our daily lives and women's roles will more computers and technology put people out of work? computers and more leisure time will change many jobs our fear should not stop us from using computers more impact of computerization and space exploration on future life computerization will allow better knowledge and justice computers do things humans can't do or want done better shortcuts for solving math problems the names of numbers discovery of zero binary numbers various calendars prime numbers factoring prime numbers factorial numbers pi pi calculating pi to increased precision transfinite numbers large numbers large numbers large numbers imaginary numbers statistics of isotopes geometric axioms /deriving the golden section non-Euclidean geometry\n\nEssays about astronomy\n\n/calendar calculations; choosing Julian day number 1 evidence that planets are more likely mapping the stars; duodecimal system Shakespeare's astronomy ancient astronomic theory star of Bethlehem extraterrestrial life extraterrestrial intelligence extraterrestrial intelligence germs from space are unlikely possibility of life near Alpha Centauri will aliens be kind or cruel to humans?
