The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\"\n\n\"Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.\"\n\n\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.\" (Meaning)\n\nGet Your Guide For Free\n\n\"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...\" (Meaning)\n\n\"No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"It is not only the living who are killed in war.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.\" (Meaning)\n\n\"A subtle thought that is in error may yet give rise to fruitful inquiry that can establish truths of great value.\" (Meaning)\n\nGet Your Guide For Free\n\n\"To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.\" (Meaning)\n\n- Isaac Asimov Quotes\n\n***\n\n* The editor of this short biography made every effort to maintain information accuracy, including any quotes, facts, or key life events.
