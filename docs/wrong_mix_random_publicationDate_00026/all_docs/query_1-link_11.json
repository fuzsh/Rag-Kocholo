Here's the opening sentences: \"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. ' Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,' he told me, ' just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'' And here's the last sentence: \" So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\" In between, some good reading. The only Fitzgerald book I love.

Further on, the book includes the complete text of Dr. Polidori's The Vampyre, whose Lord Ruthven was modeled after Polidori's erstwhile patient Lord Byron. I did not know until I read this book that Polidori's story was widely believed to have been written by Bryon himself, and was included in two collections of his works. Polidori was among the participants in the ghost-story evenings of June 1816 from which Mary Shelley's book Frankenstein arose. Also included is the Fragment written by Lord Byron to distance himself from the Polidori story. This book also supplies extracts from the text of Varney, the Vampire, one of the most popular penny dreadful series ever produced in England; excerpts from Bram Stoker's Dracula as well as essays on Stoker's research papers and on the genesis of Dracula. Where other books on vampire lore and vampire literature detail the history, this book gives you the sources themselves. Excellent. 425 pages, 4.00\n\nThe Dark Tower volumes 1-3 by Stephen King.
