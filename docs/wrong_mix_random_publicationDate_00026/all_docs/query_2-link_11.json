        "text": "The Magnus Archives just ended; I literally started working on this article whilst listening to the final episode. I want to stress, starting out, that I do largely respect what its production team, The Rusty Quill, have accomplished here: a 200 episode podcast, split into five seasons, with a massive narrative arc running over all of them but with many episodes also offering satisfying self-contained horror stories despite their wider links to the larger tale, with the show fully delivered from beginning to end without any massive Internet drama or sudden curtailment of activities derailing the production process.\n\nHowever, I couldn’t fucking stand the fifth season.\n\nTo get into the details of why, I’ll need to get deep into spoilers. I will say at this point, however, that I still think that the first four seasons hold up. In fact, helpfully there’s a massive, radical shift in the very basis of the show, as a result of the massive events that happen at the end of the fourth season; on future listens I think I will take the finale of season 4 as the show finale and think of season 5 as a different show that happened to share the same name, characters, and continuity that I don’t need to bother revisiting.\n\nI’m not kidding here: I genuinely think that the shift between the fourth and fifth season is so radical that it doesn’t make sense to treat it as the same show any more after that, and I also think that if you stopped listening at the end of the fourth season, you could actually be satisfied with that and consider that a fulfilling story in its own right.\n\nBefore I drop some spoiler space and start ragging on season 5 properly, however, I want to start off positive by doing a quick non-spoilery rundown of the first four seasons, which I do genuinely recommend.\n\nThe premise is this: the imaginatively named Jonathan Sims (played by the real-life Jonathan Sims from The Mechanisms – many of whom also appear in various roles) works as the Archivist of the Magnus Institute, which gathers testimony from individuals who have had unnerving supernatural experiences.\n\nHis predecessor went missing and left the Archives in disarray; as the show starts, John is trying to put them in order. An attempt to digitise the various Statements has run into technical difficulties; giving up on more technically advanced methods, John has taken to using a tape recorder to produce audio transcripts of the Statements as he works his way through the pile. At first, he is dismissive of most of them. Then interconnections start becoming apparent…\n\nFurther wrinkles and complications manifest over the course of the four seasons, of course, but you get the basic concept right there: you have the majority of the episodes revolving around John either reading a transcript, or recording a Statement from a witness in-person. Tape recorders also end up capturing other discussions surrounding the Statements, giving us insight into stuff happening to the characters separate from that paperwork.\n\nWhilst, say, the latter episodes of season 4 often felt somewhat different to the early stretches of season 1, the changes to the show unfolded gradually, and it never felt like The Magnus Archives over the course of these four seasons ever really stopped being the type of show it had originally presented itself as. I’d bought into it on the understanding that what I’d be getting each week was a little pocket horror story taking place in a close approximation to the real world, inhabited by characters who largely have reasonable human motivations (with some alarming exceptions), and even when the story involved extensive interconnections to other bits of plot it’d still be a satisfying story in its own right.\n\nAnd on those grounds, the first four seasons were broadly a success – largely something I would recommend to fans of Adam Nevill, Ramsey Campbell, or Thomas Ligotti. Then season 5 rolled around and…\n\nAh, right. Spoiler space. See you after the jump, if you are going to keep reading, and see you later if you’re not…\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRight, so, season 5.\n\nOver the course of seasons 1-4, it transpired that much of the supernatural material logged in the Archives was related to the Fears, the Platonic forms of particular sources of dread. The Archives, themselves, were aligned with one of these – The Eye, corresponding to the primal fear of being watched – and as a consequence of his work with the Archives, John became a kind of initiate of the Eye. (“Avatar” is the term the show used – slightly unfortunate to appropriate religious terminology corresponding to a real-world faith there, but that’s what they did – but I will use “initiate” instead.) This meant he got nutrition and strength out of the Statements and observing fear and whatnot, it was all rather insidious and grim.\n\nDigging into this, John and his allies ended up foiling a couple of plots to deliver the world into the hands of one or the other of the Fears. In the course of this, John had a bunch of encounters with initiates of other Fears (or the cosmic presence of those very Fears themselves) and seemed to come out of them weirdly easily – like how he was able to retrieve his colleague and eventual partner Martin Blackwood (Alexander J. Newall) from the realm of the Lonely (the Fear of isolation), or undertake a similar expedition to rescue Daisy Tonner (Fay Roberts), a police officer who’d become an ally of John and company, from the realm of the Buried (the Fear of being, well, buried).\n\nAt the end of season 4, it turned out this was purposeful: John had been manipulated into these encounters so that he’d be touched by each of the Fears, allowing him to read what was in effect a cursed Statement in order to summon all of them to manifest fully on Earth at once (the Eye ending up in a somewhat privileged position due to its centrality to this plan). The Statement duly read, the apocalypse happened.\n\nThis was both a hell of a way to end the season and went a long way towards resolving a gripe I’d been increasingly feeling. It hadn’t sat right with me that John could just kind of go in there and accomplish that through, so far as I could tell, nothing more than sheer force of will. It made particularly little sense that the Lonely, a Fear all about being isolated, ignored, and unacknowledged, should be apparently helpless against an incursion by an agent of the Eye – they’d seem to me to be fundamentally incompatible. If any Fear should have been able to keep John away from anyone, it should have been the formless deity of being kept away from people. However, if the Fears were all going along with this, each touching John so as to make him capable of playing his part in the grand plan, then that inconsistency makes sense.\n\nA big part of the reason I listened to the end of season 5, despite not liking a lot of it, was down to the handling of this finale, and how it made stuff that had previously bugged me suddenly seem more acceptable. I kept clinging on to episode 200 in the faint hope that Rusty Quill would repeat this trick. They did not.\n\nSeason 5 takes place after the apocalyptic transformation of the world into a nightmarish hellscape of different realms presided over by the various Fears and their initiates, with everyone else trapped in various types of private Hell. John and Martin, who are now Officially A Couple in a way which the show had sort of slow-boil been creeping towards over its run but dials up significantly this time around, are exceptions to this as a result of their various experiences. In particular, John’s role as the Archivist gives him a connection to the Eye and, therefore, a kind of cosmological diplomatic immunity (and even the ability to destroy other initiates by turn the Eye’s gaze on them). He and Martin go off on a trek to the vast Panopticon in London from which the Eye’s main initiate presides, with the intention of doing something to overthrow the Dark Lord and bring peace back to the Shire overthrow the Eye and bring peace back to Earth.\n\nNow, you might note that this sounds completely different to what we got in seasons 1-4, and you would basically be right. In essence, this is no longer the same setting as the earlier part of the show, or really the same sort of genre. Sure, there’s ample familiar characters, but what was previously a horror-story-of-the-week show based in a broadly realistic setting has been abandoned for an epic quest across a fantasy setting.\n\nOK, sure, the setting is all dark and spooky, and it’s arisen from the wreckage of the real world of the previous seasons, but this is far from a conventional post-apocalypse – the phantasmagoric realms of the various Fears are more Silent Hill than Fallout. Even the concerns which might apply to a realistic post-apocalyptic story don’t really apply: the cosmic change to the world mean that the characters don’t really need to eat or sleep any more, though they can feel appallingly hungry or tired if a particular Fear’s schtick calls for that.\n\nIn short, the setting has become so bizarre and surreal that it is entirely disconnected from conventional reality, which means that the entire “hidden horrors behind the veneer of conventional reality” schtick of the first four seasons has been comprehensively abandoned, and abandoned in a brutally sudden and absolute manner.\n\nOh, sure, there’s still John and Martin and various other familiar characters we remember from the old seasons – but seeing them dragged out of the conventional 21st Century Earth setting they previously existed in and plopped into the middle of this Bosch painting feels like clumsy fanfic. Divorced so totally and absolutely from the context they were established in, they feel less interesting than they were when we first got to know them. People are a product of their context; drag and drop them into a comprehensively different context, and you may as well be dealing with a largely different person.\n\nThe comprehensive transformation of the setting, as the feature of a series finale, would work just fine. As the premise of the entire final season of the show, however, it feels like a bait-and switch. The Rusty Quill are essentially making a big gamble here: they are taking away major aspects of the premise the audience has bought into over the course of the last four seasons, and substituting in something extremely different, and gambling that the linkages between old and new which do carry over will be enough to maintain the enthusiasm and enjoyment of their audience. It wasn’t the case for me.\n\nGiven that the basis of the show had changed so completely, you might wonder whether the Statement structure was also abandoned. After all, considering that the characters and their world have been transformed so utterly, the natural world having departed and the occult, esoteric aspects of the characters having become overt and exoteric, keeping the Statement structure would seem incongruous.\n\nWell, the Statements weren’t gone – but they also kind of were gone.\n\nTo be less cryptic, Statements were still significant portions of each episodes – however, the type of content involved in said Statements was now very different, as was the manner of delivery, so the Statements of season 5 aren’t really like the typical Statements of the first few seasons. Rather than reading out someone else’s written testimony or listening to them give it, John in season 5 typically just pulls a Statement out of thin air, a by-product of his Eye-gifted power of omniscience.\n\nAnd usually, the Statements are no longer micro-horror stories set in the real world about a curious incident – again, the thing which got me and many other listeners hooked in the first place – so much as they are narrative musings about the experience of being in one of these Fear-ruled hell-realms. No longer a conventional witness statement, they approach prose poetry (or, in at least one incident, actual poetry). For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like; for those who wanted a weekly mini-horror story set in the real world, which is what four seasons of the show had trained us to expect, this may have been jarring.\n\nIt certainly put me off. I took to skipping most of the Statements midway through the season, and honestly it had no major effect on my understanding of what was happening. After all, most of the Statements seemed to now be dedicated not to creating an atmosphere of horror mystery, but explaining the schtick of one of the Fears which had already been perfectly adequately depicted in the main run of the show (and, indeed, as season 4 progressed had risked already becoming over-explained). In many of them, nothing particularly plot-important happened, particularly since the material around the statements had now become the place where major plot things happened and the Statements themselves were this sort of vestigial, atrophied feature of the show.\n\nPerhaps Rusty Quill felt obligated to keep the Statements to help make the show feel Magnus Archives-y despite the massive changes to the setting. However, just as you can’t drag a character into a completely different context and expect them to really function the same narratively or psychologically as they did in their original niche, you also can’t just completely change the type of content the Statements focus on and expect much in the way of atmospheric continuity. Again, the show I fell in love with had these statements take place in the real world with psychologically realistic narrators. In season 5, the real world had been blown up and was, so far as anyone knew, irretrievable.\n\nAs a result, the apocalypse and the metaphysic underlying it are the only stories going, because the natural universe and all the side plots that could be happening in it have gone away and every character encountered and interacted with over the course of the entire season has had their entire existence comprehensively subverted and defined by it. The Magnus Archives had gone from a universe where there was a dizzying array of stories to tell to one in which there was only really one story, and hearing some 40-odd different iterations of it was just tiresome.\n\n(There are some exceptions, but not ones which bring back the sort of approach I’d originally come to love. The final Statement is an account of the birth of the Fears, which feels just as pointless as the various extremely tedious attempts by the likes of Lin Carter or Brian Lumley to try and dig into the family tree of the Cthulhu Mythos pantheon, despite that never really being interesting or even useful in creating an atmosphere of horror and dread.)\n\nAs well as a shift in content, there was also a shift in style. Naturalistic performances and understated narration gave way to a very performative, stagey style of narration on Sims’ part, right down to him lapsing into using a spoooooky voooooice, like he’s telling a campfire story or something rather than relating someone’s account of a thing that happened to them. In fact, more generally in this season there’s a notable shift away from the more natural, realistic performances that had been the hallmark of the earlier seasons into something which I’d describe as being more stagey and overacted. (There’d been touches of this more melodramatic style in the previous seasons, but the proportion notably jumps up here.)\n\nThis tonal shift is particularly annoying when you take into account the format. See, when I say “stagey” I’m using a term I didn’t learn until a little while back, but which to me seems apt: it refers to performances which are deliberately somewhat overacted and overemphasised compared to a more natural delivery of the material. In the context of an actual stage play, this is is actually kind of necessary. Understated actions and responses might be more realistic and more convincing, but they’re also harder to spot for audience members way at the back of the theatre, and in general you’re supposed to perform for everyone in the audience, not just the lucky people who got front row seats. A podcast, intrinsically a more personal and intimate medium, is not like that; you can use more subtle notes in your tone of voice to convey stuff, you don’t need to overact everything so that someone at the back can catch what you’re trying to do.\n\nTo be fair, I can understand a production opting for a deliberately stagey performance style from the beginning if that were appropriate to the material at hand, or if the cast were enthusiastic amateurs who weren’t really sold on their ability to pull off a more natural performance but were more confident about hamming it up and chewing some scenery. The first four seasons demonstrated sufficient acting chops on the part of the performers that the latter factor can be written off immediately. I can see the point of shifting to a more stagey and melodramatic style to fit the hallucinatory fantasy world of the fifth season here, contrasted to the more realistic setting of the first four seasons – but the fact that this makes sense only underscores the discontinuity in setting, tone, and overall approach.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, I really feel like season 5 is such a radical departure from the first four seasons that it would make much more sense to regard it as a sequel or a separate work altogether. Calling it season 5 and continuing the episode numbering from episode 160 (the season 4 finale) to episode 161 (the season 5 debut) implies a level of continuity between what has come before and what comes after that simply does not exist. Oh, sure, there’s diegetic continuity in the sense that the events of the first four seasons remain canonical and whatnot, but seasons 1-5 don’t feel like five parts of the same whole on the level of atmosphere and mood and stylistic approach, they feel like one four-season show and its weird one-season sequel.\n\nI have other issues with the season itself, but to be honest if similar plot points had been part of a more conventional season of the show I would have probably forgiven them – it’s this big, macro-scale, structural shift, this wholesale abandonment of all the bits I enjoyed the most about previous seasons, coupled with a draining of mystery from the show as everything gets somewhat overexplained, which was so totally fatal to my enjoyment of season 5, and the finale did nothing to turn this ship around."
