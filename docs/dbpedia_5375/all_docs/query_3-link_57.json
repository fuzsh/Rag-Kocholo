This will be based on CarbonFree’s patented SkyCycle® technology.\n\nThe Swiss-Japanese cleantech company Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) and the innovators at CarbonFree Chemicals Holding LCC (CarbonFree) in the USA have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) and are now planning to join forces in implementing a unique solution to reduce the carbon footprint of the waste industry. Texas-based CarbonFree developed its separation and mineralization technology some 15 years ago and has refined it further to create the SkyCycle® concept. This process allows the CO2 contained in industrial flue gases to be captured at the source. The CO2 is being reacted with calcium to form mineral calcium carbonate – a stable, non-toxic, valuable component which has many uses, including as a raw material in the construction industry, a fertilizer, and a mineral filler in the paper, paint, and plastics industries. The high achievable capture rates can enable incineration plants to become carbon sinks. The system is geographically independent: it does not require storing CO2 in a gaseous phase underground, nor additional pipelines for transportation. The MoU expresses both companies’ desire to integrate the technology within existing and new energy from waste plants.\n\nA Win for Both Companies\n\nThe further development of this technology opens the way to new projects for both companies. “We are delighted to have found an experienced partner in HZI that can help us to adapt our technology directly to EfW and AD processes. Branching out into these industries will bring us much closer to our goal of separating 10% of the CO2 emitted by industrial processes worldwide,” says Scott Gardner, CFO of CarbonFree. Fabio Dinale, Vice President Business Development at HZI, adds: “In the best-case scenario, our joint efforts will help us to reduce CO2 emissions from EfW plants to zero or even negative and make our technologies even more embedded within the circular economy changing our plants from being WtE to real WtX plants. At the same time, we will be creating a marketable zero carbon emission end product. In CarbonFree, we have secured a partner that already has 15 years of experience in carbon capture utilization and an impressive record of success.”\n\nWith the MoU now signed, the active phase of the project begins immediately.\n\nAbout Hitachi Zosen Inova\n\nZurich-based Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) is a global leader in energy from waste (EfW) and renewable gas, operating as part of the Hitachi Zosen Corporation Group.

That’s why we’re so excited to partner with CarbonFree.”\n\nCarbonFree’s patented SkyCycle™ Technology is an on-site solution that mineralizes CO2 captured from the generator and creates products for sale or safe storage, such as calcium carbonate (PCC & limestone); sodium bicarbonate (baking soda); and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl).\n\nThis announcement is yet another signal that CarbonFree is readying itself to implement its technology on a grander scale and make a significant impact in the race to net zero. Two months ago the company also announced its collaboration with TETRA, a world-class player in the calcium chloride space, along with its participation in the first cohort of the exclusive Carbon to Value Initiative.\n\nAbout CarbonFree\n\nCarbonFree is a private company focused on advancing the net-zero ambitions of both CO2 emitters and consumers of carbon-negative chemicals. CarbonFree invested 15 years into research and development to prepare to bring a technology to carbon-emitting plants around the world called SkyCycleTM. This on-site solution mineralizes CO2 captured from the plant and creates products for sale or safe storage, such as calcium carbonate (PCC & limestone); sodium bicarbonate (baking soda); and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl).
