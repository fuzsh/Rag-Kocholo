        "text": "Pentagon Auditorium\n\nJanuary 16, 2007\n\nVice President Cheney, members of the Ford family, distinguished guests, welcome, and thank you for coming to participate in today’s naming ceremony.\n\nTo be chosen as an aircraft carrier’s namesake is a rare honor.\n\nA U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is a symbol that is recognizable throughout the world.\n\nIt represents American power.\n\nIt is a reminder of America’s global interests, and global reach.\n\nIt is, in the eyes of the American people, a safeguard in a troubled and dangerous world.\n\nAt moments of crisis, Americans from presidents to schoolteachers to cabdrivers anxiously await the latest news of an aircraft carrier’s progress, knowing that wherever threats emerge, an American carrier will get the call.\n\nToday it is my great pleasure to announce that the Department of the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, CVN 78—the first in a new class of carriers—will be named--USS GERALD R. FORD.\n\nPresident Ford, as many Americans have over the years come to fully appreciate, was an historical figure, a great president, and a man of the highest character.\n\nAmerica has been blessed, in the eyes of many, with leaders who were able to steer the American ship of state through dangerous waters during our Nation’s most difficult crises.\n\nWe think of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, Franklin Roosevelt during World War II, and Ronald Reagan during the Cold War.\n\nPresident Ford assumed the presidency during the greatest Constitutional crisis since the Civil War, at a time when the public’s faith in government was shaken.\n\nBut America was blessed once again with a leader for the times, a man with the integrity and character to heal the nation and restore trust in the presidency.\n\nIt is worth recalling an episode in President Ford’s life that is illustrative of his character.\n\nAfter Ford was chosen to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president, the FBI assigned 350 agents from 33 field offices to conduct an exhaustive background check on him. The FBI sent 70 agents alone to Ford’s hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Soon then-Congressman Ford’s office in Washington, DC received a stream of phone calls from friends and associates who wanted to let him know that they were being questioned. Ford had one stock reply: “Tell them the truth—give them everything.” It was a philosophy that served him well over a long lifetime of public service, and that would serve him well as president.\n\nHis legacy includes service on an aircraft carrier during World War II, an experience made a lasting impression on him of a carrier’s capabilities. His Naval service was followed by 25 years in Congress, the vice presidency, the presidency, and an active career in support of worthy causes in the long twilight of his life.\n\nPresident Ford’s reputation has steadily grown over the past three decades, and the judgment of history now recognizes the rightness of his most difficult and controversial decisions.\n\nPresident Ford was heavily criticized at the time for signing the Helsinki Accords of 1975. And yet those agreements established the principle of individual rights, put a spotlight on the plight of Soviet refuseniks, and set the stage for the fall of the Soviet Union sixteen years later.\n\nThe Ford presidency will always be remembered for the pardon that was granted to Richard Nixon. The pardon was widely unpopular at the time, but it is now viewed as a critical step in moving our Nation forward.\n\nPresident Ford did something that is all too rare in American politics—he put the national interest above his own political interest. He sacrificed his political career but he later earned a Profile in Courage award for his actions, and, even more important, the delayed but enduring respect of a grateful Nation.\n\nWhether dealing with a dire financial crisis in New York City, the Vietnam War, or an economy ravaged by inflation and a world oil crisis, President Ford made tough decisions based on what he thought was the right thing to do.\n\nIn doing so, he set a standard of character and decency that future generations will respect and admire, and a standard of leadership for the United States Navy to uphold.\n\nPresident Ford, I am pleased to say, had been informed before he passed that we had decided to name CVN 78 after him, and I know that he was enormously proud of and grateful for the honor.\n\nWhat a wonderful capstone to a life in which his connection with aircraft carriers was deep and personal. He served aboard a carrier during war. As president, he commanded carriers in the fleet. During his tenure as president, he also commissioned USS NIMITZ, the first in its class of nuclear-powered carriers. No one could have appreciated more the honor of having a carrier named after him than President Ford.\n\nMay the future Sailors of USS GERALD R. FORD always show themselves to be worthy of their ship’s name, and may they always honor the legacy of a great man.\n\nThank you.\n\nPentagon Auditorium\n\nJanuary 16, 2007\n\nVice President Cheney, Secretary Winter, Admiral Mullen, members of the family of Jerry Ford, men and women of our Armed Forces, ladies and gentlemen:\n\nI want to thank Senator Warner for his leadership on last year’s Defense Authorization Act in including the provision that made this day possible, and I want to commend the Navy and Secretary Winter for following through on the suggestion in that bill that we name CVN 78 in honor of President Gerald Ford. I was pleased to co-sponsor Senator Warner’s amendment because of the special pride this honor would bring to President Ford’s heart, and because it rings so true as a memorial to him.\n\nIn 1941, not long after Gerald Ford opened a law practice in Grand Rapids, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Gerald Ford enlisted in the Navy within the week.\n\nAt first, Ford served in the physical education branch, and this gifted athlete coached all nine sports that were offered. He soon grew restless, though, and needed to join the fight. Ford asked to be transferred to service at sea, and was assigned to a light aircraft carrier, the USS Monterey. He would later write that there he saw “as much action as I’d ever hoped to see.” With Ford serving as assistant navigator, athletic officer and anti-aircraft battery officer, the Monterey fought in many of the major operations of the South Pacific, earning 10 battle stars during his service.\n\nPerhaps Lieutenant Ford’s finest hour at sea, however, was a battle not with the enemy, but with the elements. In December 1944, a massive typhoon slammed the Monterey, with waves topping 70 feet. Chaos reigned as the planes on board caught fire, and several broke free from their cables. Many of the sailors were incapacitated; Admiral Halsey ordered the Monterey abandoned; and flames threatened to consume the carrier. But then – thirty years before President Ford would right our ship of state – Lieutenant Ford helped save the Monterey and its men.\n\nAt great personal risk, Jerry Ford led a team down to the hangar deck to battle the fire. With gas tanks exploding around them and thick smoke choking the air, they evacuated the stricken men and then extinguished the fire. The fight lasted for hours, but the Monterey and almost all of her sailors survived. The teamwork that Jerry Ford learned playing football at the University of Michigan was surely put to the test that day. And the “we’re all in this together” feeling of community, instilled in him by his Grand Rapids upbringing, just as surely contributed to his leadership on the Monterey.\n\nAfter the war, Gerald Ford returned to practice law in Grand Rapids but soon felt a new call to service. When he ran for Congress, his naval record was clearly an asset, but more important than how that service helped him was how it had changed him. Ford’s naval service had inspired in him a transformation similar to that of Michigan’s great Senator Arthur Vandenberg, another son of Grand Rapids who had evolved from an isolationist to an internationalist.\n\nWith Vandenberg’s support, Ford ran an underdog primary campaign against the isolationist incumbent. Ford’s upset victory was a reflection of how highly voters thought of him personally and also how much had changed in American politics.\n\nThe people of Michigan’s Fifth District recognized that Gerald Ford was the right man for the times, and years later the rest of America would reach that same judgment. The Watergate scandal slammed our nation like a political typhoon, and thank goodness Gerald Ford was there to lead us with the same steady courage he had displayed on the Monterey.\n\nAs Commander in Chief, President Ford resolved, in his words, “to make our Navy as it has been, as it will be, and as it must be – the best Navy in the whole world.” Today, we help keep that pledge with this new aircraft carrier named in his honor, and we renew that pledge in his name to maintain the best navy in the whole world and to help defend beyond his and our lives the nation that Jerry Ford loved so much.\n\nPentagon Auditorium\n\nJanuary 16, 2007\n\nThank you very much. And, Secretary Winter and Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, Chief Mullen, it's great to be here this afternoon to participate in a very special ceremony that has great meaning, obviously, for our late President's family, for the men and women of the Navy, and of course, for the nation.\n\nI've been looking forward to this gathering of friends and colleagues, and President Bush asked me to come this morning and extend his good wishes to everybody, as well.\n\nIf the purpose of naming an aircraft carrier is to convey the confident spirit of our military, and the good and just causes that America serves in the world, then we have certainly accomplished that purpose here today. The name Gerald R. Ford belonged to a man who gave a lifetime of devoted service to our country, reflecting honor on the United States Navy, on the House of Representatives, on the Vice Presidency, and on the Presidency. The naming of a carrier is a fitting tribute to the man, and it's thrilling for all of his family and friends.\n\nKnown before today only as CVN 78, the Gerald R. Ford already has years of planning behind it, and will join the fleet seven or eight years from now. The construction of these carriers represents a bipartisan commitment by the United States Congress to carefully prepare our military for challenges far into the future. One of the very practical lessons I learned at the Pentagon is that every President, every Secretary of Defense, and every military chief of staff deploys a force that is, in large part, the result of decisions made many years earlier by his predecessors. Because our own generation is taking that responsibility seriously, the Gerald R. Ford, and sister ships in the new class of nuclear-powered carriers, will help ensure the sea power of the United States for the next half century.\n\nPresident Ford himself, with his background and the good common sense we all remember, was deeply committed to an active foreign policy, and to maintaining the strength of our military. Having fought for our country in the Second World War, he understood that events on distant shores can have a direct impact on our own security. He understood that protecting the American people requires defending our interests in far-away places. He understood that for our forces to be credible, they must be able to deploy wherever and whenever needed -- and this, in turn, requires the power to sail the oceans of the world, in control of the surface, the sub-surface, and the skies overhead.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, Gerald R. Ford applied American influence with wisdom and foresight. He stood firmly by the men and women of the armed forces, and left office with the military in a higher state of readiness and morale than when he found it.\n\nPresident Ford was rightly proud of his record on national security. And, like the team player he always was, he was quick to share the credit with the fine people who served alongside him -- from Henry Kissinger to Brent Scowcroft to Don Rumsfeld and Jack Marsh. It was my privilege, as well, to be on Jerry Ford's team, both during a difficult transition and through all the challenges of his time in office. All of us who were there count the experience as one of the truly great periods in our lives, when we worked for one of the most genuine, upright, and considerate men we have ever known.\n\nOnly three weeks after President Ford's passing, there is still a sense of loss for all of us, most especially for Betty and her children. This has been a time of reflection for everyone who had the honor of knowing President Ford and of serving with him. It's also been a time for re-connecting with old friends, reliving the things we shared, and looking back with gratitude on the good life of the man we were proud to call our leader. President Ford will always be an example to us of personal kindness, of loyalty, and of coolness under pressure. We remember how this longtime legislator proved to be a natural-born executive with a decisive, well ordered mind. He was comfortable with responsibility -- and because of his sturdy character and his Navy experience, Jerry Ford knew a thing or two about riding out a storm.\n\nHe didn't shrink from a tough call. In such a moment, even with a popular choice in plain view and the easy path laid straight out in front of him, President Ford asked only what was right for the United States of America, and acted accordingly. When criticism came, he kept his head about him, focused on his job, and persevered. History looks favorably on such a man, and President Ford's reputation has, indeed, grown even greater in the three decades since he left this city.\n\nToday in our country, and at posts around the world, the flag of the United States remains at half-staff in memory of President Gerald Ford. But I think it would please him to know that today we're also looking to the future. He always reminded us that there's work to do; servicemen and women who need our support; and a call to duty in a world that benefits greatly from American power and American values. He would be proud, as well -- modestly so, but proud nonetheless -- of this coming addition to the Navy he joined 65 years ago, led as Commander-in-Chief, and respected all the days of his life.\n\nWhen completed, the USS Gerald R. Ford will be a sight to behold: 100,000 tons of American ingenuity and power; rising 20 stories above water level; about as long as the Empire State Building; and able to sail the oceans for 20 years without refueling. We look forward to the day she joins the fleet and begins her long and steady service to the United States of America.\n\nPentagon Auditorium\n\nJanuary 16, 2007\n\n11 a.m.\n\nMr. Vice President, Secretary England, Secretary Winter, Senator Levin, Senator Warner, Admiral Mullen, General Swan, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:\n\nThe Ford Family this morning is filled with tremendous pride. No doubt, my brothers and I could spend several hours talking about how much the Navy’s tribute meant to Dad. However, before talking about today’s remarkable tribute, with your indulgence, Secretary Winter, I’d like to share some thoughts from Mother and our family. Mother is doing well and is watching this ceremony on the Pentagon Channel.\n\nDuring the past three weeks, we’ve been deeply moved by the outpouring of affection and remembrances from across the United States. We particularly want to express what an honor it was to have the men and women of the United States Armed Forces present with us at every ceremony and service of the State Funeral. There is nothing – absolutely nothing – that would have made Dad prouder. The dedication, compassion, and dignity of those brave men and women strengthened and comforted Mother and our family at every step of the way. They will always have a special place in our hearts - always.\n\nWe would like to extend a personal thank you to President and Mrs. Bush and to Vice President and Mrs. Cheney for their many kindnesses and, most of all, for their decades of friendship with Dad and our family. We remember fondly Mr. Joe Hagin and the White House Staff along with the U.S. Secret Service for their many kind deeds and for their moving farewell tribute in front of the White House. We are particularly grateful to the House of Representatives and the Senate, especially both Sergeants-At-Arms and their staffs, for their assistance and for the unprecedented historical tributes that both bodies conducted for Dad.\n\nAnd, General Swan, if I may, a personal comment. The kindness and care that you provided to Mother as her personal escort is a gift for which we will always be grateful. You embody the highest ideals of our great country, General Swan, and your assistance to Mother was, quite frankly, beyond description. Thank you, sir.\n\nAs we gather today for the naming of CVN-78, let me first say to Senator Levin and Senator Warner, thank you for your tireless efforts in make this Naming Ceremony a reality. And thank you for your unceasing support of our men and women in uniform.\n\nThe naming of CVN-78 as the USS Gerald R. Ford represents more than assigning a name to a naval vessel. There is now a unique bond between CVN-78 and its new namesake. The permanence of Dad’s name and his legacy is forever instilled into this magnificent vessel and the men and women who will someday occupy her decks. And it is that special bond that gives our family such pride.\n\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford also shares a unique bond with another ship and her crew. As many of you know, several years ago the USS America was towed into the Atlantic Ocean and then sunk in a series of tests to verify critical components of the CVN-78 carrier program. Those tests were essential to maximizing the survivability of the future carrier fleet, including CVN-78. The USS America and her proud crew set a magnificent example of patriotism and unwavering service to the U.S. Navy. And now their valor lives on within the spirit of the USS Gerald R. Ford. For that gift and for their service, we are deeply grateful to the America and her crew.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about how to convey Dad’s gratitude upon learning that Secretary Winter was considering naming CVN-78 the USS Gerald R. Ford. I struggled to find words adequate to express the emotions that Dad shared privately with Mother, Mike, Jack, Steve, and me regarding CVN-78. And, as was so often the case with Dad, the answer was found in his own words.\n\nA few weeks before his death, Dad wrote a letter to our friend Greg Willard regarding CVN-78. In the letter, he described how much the tribute then under consideration by Secretary Winter meant to him. Dad wrote to Greg:\n\n“In closing, please permit me a personal reflection. In my life, I’ve received countless honors. But none was greater than the opportunity to wear the uniform of Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy. On an aircraft carrier in the South Pacific during World War II, I learned to respect, and to rely on, my comrades as if my life depended on them – because it often did. As a World War II veteran, I yield to no one in my admiration for the heroes of Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima. At the same time, I take enormous inspiration from their grandsons and granddaughters who are writing new chapters of heroism around the globe. Thus, it is a source of indescribable pride and humility to know that an aircraft carrier bearing my name may be permanently associated with the valor and patriotism of the men and women of the United States Navy.”\n\nDad conveyed in words precisely how each of us in the Ford family feels about this wonderful tribute. So today and in our every tomorrow, we will fondly remember those words with the knowledge that the USS Gerald R. Ford and her crew will forever embody a tribute to Dad that was -- and is -- without equal.\n\nSecretary Winter, on behalf of Mother and the entire Ford Family, please accept our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the extraordinary honor which you have given Dad.\n\nMay God Bless and watch over the USS Gerald R. Ford and her crew. And may God Bless America.\n\nThank you very much."
