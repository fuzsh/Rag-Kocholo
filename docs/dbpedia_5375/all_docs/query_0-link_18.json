        "text": "An unexpected attack\n\nOn early morning of June 22 1807, the American warship USS Chesapeake weighed anchor from its naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, and soon cleared the bay whose name she carried to put to sea. Built less than seven years before, she had just been refitted after a four-year hiatus in the shipyard. She was now headed for a two-year assignment as flagship of the American squadron in the Mediterranean. On board were important civilian passengers – government officials- on their way to postings in Europe, travelling along with their relatives and their belongings. As a result, baggage and extra gear were scattered all over the lower decks and took priority over the battle readiness of the frigate; moreover, the extra weight also slowed her down considerably. However, since the country was at peace and she was going to sail in known and friendly waters, no one was too concerned by her state.\n\nChesapeake's senior officer was newly-appointed Commodore James Barron, an experienced seaman and captain of good repute who was heading for his post as Head of the American fleet in the Mediterranean. As his frigate rounded Cape Henry and made for open sea, a watchman signalled a British warship nearby. The Commodore was well aware that the Royal Navy was patrolling just off the three-mile limit which marked the boundary of international waters: before leaving port, he had heard of two French ships which had taken refuge in the Chesapeake Bay during a recent storm and which were now hiding from the Royal Navy. Surely, the British were waiting for them to come out, in some cat-and-mouse game. However, just as he crossed the three-mile limit, he saw that HMS Leopard, a 50-gun frigate, was actually hailing his ship. Extending naval courtesy, Barron ordered his men to drop sail to allow Leopard to catch up. Signals were exchanged and a small party of British officers came on board the American warship. Once civilities were exchanged, a young lieutenant flatly demanded of Barron that his whole crew be immediately assembled on deck for an inspection: the Chesapeake was suspected of having deserters from the Royal Navy in her ranks and the captain of the Leopard wanted to have them removed on the spot to be accordingly pressed back into His Majesty the King's service.\n\nBarron, just as flatly, refused to comply. The British could perhaps bully captains of the merchant navy in this manner, but his was a US Navy warship and as such, it represented American territory: surely, the Leopard's captain would understand Barron's refusal to acquiesce to an invasion. The meeting was over and the British party went back to its ship. The discussion continued through loud hailers for a while but when Barron ordered to set sail, Leopard fired a shot across the Chesapeake's bow. It was followed in a matter of seconds by a full broadside; then six more came. In total, twenty-one roundshots hit their marks on the starboard side of the American. In less than 10 minutes, having fired only one shot, Chesapeake was too severely damaged to fight; Barron ordered her colours to be struck. There were four dead and 18 wounded amongst her crew, including Barron himself. Before the smoke could clear, another British party came onboard and proceeded to search the ship, moving through the debris and the ravaged and bloody decks. The inspection was carried out swiftly and the British soon left the American frigate, refusing her as a prize, but taking with them four men whom they declared bona fide deserters. Leopard then sailed off with the prisoners, leaving the crippled Chesapeake to get back to harbour by her own means.\n\nPrelude to war – Europe vs North America (1803-1812)\n\nAs violent as it was, this incident – which was soon dubbed the “Chesapeake Affair” by the American press – was only the latest escalation in the long-standing disputes between the United States and England, their former colonial master. During the four years prior, unresolved issues between the two countries had resurfaced, (1) compounded by the events taking place in Europe. The resuming of the war between France and Britain had now turned into a bitter and all-out conflict. Napoleon and the English cabinet were exchanging blows which sent shockwaves all over the world, North America being no exception. As a result, relations between the United States, France and England had taken a turn for the worse, especially after Trafalgar, in October 1805. By gaining mastery of the seas during that battle, England had put an end to Napoleon's dream of invading the Island-Nation. In 1806, the Emperor opted for an economic war aimed at suffocating England's sea trade. From occupied Berlin, Napoleon decreed a continental blockade of all Europe, banning British merchandise. England replied with a series of Orders in council which forbade trade with French-held ports. These measures put all neutral nations in a deadlock and basically forced them to take sides. First and foremost among these countries were the United States. With the second largest merchant fleet in the world operating all over the European coast, reaching as far as the Baltic Sea and deep within the Mediterranean, the Americans could not abandon European markets without feeling a devastating economic backlash at home. Knowing this, both France and Britain seemed more and more intent on using US maritime as a weapon against each other: little consideration was given to American Independence. “All this was done with a self-righteous arrogance, as if dealing with an inferior species, which was no less infuriating for being perfectly sincere.” (Elting, 1991: 69).\n\nA few months after the Chesapeake Affair, both Napoleon and the British government tightened their noose further around America's foreign trade by respectively issuing new decrees and orders which put the Americans in an impossible situation. If France acted harshly towards the Americans, it was nonetheless England which now seemed keenest on hurting the United States. “Great Britain, fighting for her life against France, was bent on all-out maritime warfare. If a neutral America, reaping the economic benefits, was bruised a little on the high seas, well, that was unfortunate but necessary. America, in British eyes, was a weak, inconsequential nation that could be pushed around with impunity.” (Berton, 1980: 24). In 1806, as a reply to the Napoleonic blockade, the Royal Navy started boarding American merchantmen for inspections at sea, sometimes taking them back to England as seized contraband runners. Between 1808 and 1812, over 400 US merchantmen met with such a fate, a loss which heavily affected American trade and created bitter resentment.\n\nAnother point of contention which furthered the deterioration of diplomatic relations between the two countries was that of the impressment of American sailors into British service. While inspecting US ships, British officers often picked-up seamen and forced them onboard His Majesty's ships without any further trial than their own decision. By doing so, Britain claimed it was merely going after deserters who were hiding onboard US ships and fleeing the harsh discipline on Royal Navy men-of-war. (2) But the manner in which it did so, and the extent of this impressment, continued to drive a wedge between the two countries. (3) As such, the Chesapeake Affair only added fuel to the fire. (4)\n\nIn the end, the United States were caught between the hammer and the anvil. A young nation, it was very much divided as to how to reply to European pressures. Some advocated from the start that the country needed to take up arms to impose respect on England but in 1807, when the Chesapeake Affair took place, the US were nowhere near being ready for a war. Saddled by a huge economic debt, they could not afford the scaling up of armament and the mustering of a large military force needed against such a powerful enemy. Thus, Presidents Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and James Madison (1809-1817) opted in turn for economic warfare, enacting bills which were aimed at hurting both France and England by depriving them of much-needed American goods. Half-bluff, half-hopelessly idealistic policy, these measures ultimately failed – they nearly killed US foreign trade – and as a result, they brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. After four years of such diplomacy, it became obvious for many Americans, including Madison, that peace was now a more costly proposition than war. This was made abundantly clear by a new crop of American politicians who were elected to Congress in 1810 under the slogan Free trade and sailors' rights. These politicians – though from Madison's own political party – were openly pro-war and were soon dubbed the “War Hawks”. Although they did not bear Napoleon in their hearts, their main nemesis was Britain. Since England refused to revoke its Orders in Council and, more importantly, kept on inspecting and seizing American ships or citizens at sea, they felt time had come once more to remind John Bull who had won at Yorktown. Although some Americans were in disagreement with this position – in particular in New England and along the central eastern coast, regions which now depended on black market with Canada and Britain for their livelihood. (5) But the War Hawks finally prevailed and carried the country into war. On June 1st, President James Madison delivered a message to Congress and after approval by both Houses, he signed a declaration of war against Britain on June 18, 1812.\n\nThe War of 1812: The North American campaign of the Napoleonic Wars\n\nMany historians, past and present, tend to designate this conflict as the “Second American War of Independence”. Though partly adequate, this title is also inadvertently misleading because it confines this war to a strictly British-American perspective, a sort of colonial clash which settled old scores rooted in Eighteenth-Century politics. The War of 1812 – as it is also and perhaps more aptly called – should rather be seen as the North American phase of the Napoleonic Wars. In fact, many of the conflict's roots plunged deep into the European geopolitical context of the time and in the struggle for domination between France and England which affected all continents on this planet. (6) Although the matters of sea trading, sailors' rights and Britain's attitude towards North American politics played a great part in pushing the United States into open war, there were other factors at work which actually set this conflict in another, and larger, context. Declared in the early summer of 1812, it coincided with the beginning of Napoleon's military drive for Moscow. The American government had been told by its network of spies in Europe of the falling out between Russia and France in 1811. As the Grande Armée was gathering on the banks of the Russian border, many believed that Napoleon would repeat his successes of Austerlitz and Friedland, this time smashing the Czar's armies for good and imposing his terms on his former ally. If that happened, Britain would lose her only remaining continental support to the East and would have to face Napoleonic Europe on its own. Thus severely weakened, the Island-Nation would no doubt try to avoid the predicament of a war on two fronts. In an opportunistic gamble, the Americans decided to move on these “foregone” conclusions: Madison and his government now thought that the odds of declaring war on England and getting something substantial out of it were in their favour. But since they could not strike England on its own territory, the Americans opted for an easier and closer objective: the conquest of the British colonies in Canada. (7)\n\nThe invasion of Canada: \"A mere matter of military marching\"\n\nIn June of 1812, there were less than half a million people in the whole of Canada while there were over seven and a half million people living in the United States. With a fifteen to one advantage in favour of the Americans, Canada stood no chance of resisting for long. In total, 9,000 British troops were expected to defend a territory of over 2 million square miles. England had no immediate reinforcements to spare because of the war in the Iberian Peninsula, a fact well known by American authorities. The conquest of Canada, as President Jefferson had once put it, would be a “mere matter of military marching”. Nonetheless, the Americans did not possess many strategic options in drawing up their invasion plans. With the Royal Navy in command of the Atlantic and well established in the Saint Lawrence River – Canada's gateway to the East- the US Army command could not attack from there. (8) Consequently, it was forced to launch its invasion from inland, to the West. The conquering armies would first seize the British colony of Upper Canada (now Ontario), and then roll back the tiny Anglo-Canadian forces towards Lower Canada (Québec). Once the cities of Montréal and Québec were under their control, the Americans could give the final push up the Saint Lawrence River, moving on the shoreline towards Halifax and the sea. Plans were hastily drawn up and the American Army was sent to into Canada for a war that was supposed to be over by Christmas.\n\nLogic and numbers do not always prevail in times of war and this particular war was one in which logic would be baffled almost daily. Badly led and under-trained, the US military forces that attacked the Canadian border in the summer of 1812 met with one humiliating disaster after another. Even though superior in numbers, they could not dispose of the small defending garrisons of British regulars, Canadian militia and Amerindian warriors in Western Upper Canada, let alone threaten Lower Canada or the cities of Montréal and Québec. Six months after the beginning of the war, Madison and the American military command could not escape the dire facts: their forces had been repelled three times from Canada. In the process, two armies had been defeated and forced to surrender to forces greatly inferior in numbers. Moreover, parts of American territory to the West of the Great Lakes and Upper Canada now lay in British hands. On the whole, there was only one source of good news for the Americans at the end of 1812, and it came from the most unexpected place of all: the sea.\n\nThe first \"Wolf Packs\" (1812-1813)"
