        "text": "The Battle of Okinawa took place from 1 Apr 1945 â€“ 22 Jun 1945. The Pacific War began with the rapid advance of Japanese forces in East Asia and across the Pacific. By the end of December 1941, Japanese control in the Pacific extended as far as Wake Island, less than 2,500 miles from Hawaii.\n\nDecisive naval clashes at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, in May and June 1942, turned the tables on Japan. In August of the same year, the US launched its 'island-hopping' strategy to retake control in the Pacific, beginning with an amphibious assault at Guadalcanal.\n\nBy April 1945, US forces were ready to launch an assault on Okinawa. An airbase here would bring US B-29 bombers within range of the Japanese home islands.\n\nDiscover five facts about the Battle of Okinawa and a few highlights from our collection."
