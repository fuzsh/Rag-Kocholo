        "text": "At a Glance\n\nThe Army, Navy, and Air Force are each developing hypersonic missiles—nonnuclear offensive weapons that fly faster than five times the speed of sound and spend most of their flight in the Earth’s atmosphere. Those missiles are intended to be maneuverable and capable of striking targets quickly (in roughly 15 minutes to 30 minutes) from thousands of kilometers away.\n\nIn this report, the Congressional Budget Office analyzes the hypersonic weapons being developed by the U.S. military and compares them with less expensive existing or potential weapons that might fill similar roles, such as ballistic missiles or cruise missiles. CBO reached the following conclusions:\n\nTechnological challenges must still be overcome to field hypersonic missiles. The fundamental remaining challenge involves managing the extreme heat that hypersonic missiles are exposed to by traveling at high speeds in the atmosphere for most of their flight (unlike cruise missiles, which fly in the atmosphere at lower speeds, or ballistic missiles, which mainly fly above the atmosphere). Shielding hypersonic missiles’ sensitive electronics, understanding how various materials perform, and predicting aerodynamics at sustained temperatures as high as 3,000° Fahrenheit require extensive flight testing. Tests are ongoing, but failures in recent years have delayed progress.\n\nBoth hypersonic and ballistic missiles are well-suited to operate outside potential adversaries’ anti­access and area-denial (A2/AD), or “keep-out,” zones. The Department of Defense has developed a strategy to use accurate, long-range, high-speed missiles early in a conflict to neutralize the A2/AD zones being developed by potential adversaries, such as China and Russia. Both hypersonic missiles and ballistic missiles equipped with maneuverable warheads could provide the combination of speed, accuracy, range, and survivability (the ability to reach a target without being intercepted) that would be useful in the military scenarios CBO considered. However, many missions do not require such rapid strikes. For those missions, less costly alternatives to both hypersonic and ballistic missiles exist, including subsonic cruise missiles. Hypersonic weapons would mainly be useful to address threats that were both well-defended and extremely time-sensitive.\n\nHypersonic missiles would probably not be more survivable than ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads in a conflict, unless the ballistic missiles encountered highly effective long-range defenses. Hypersonic missiles can neutralize long-range (midcourse) defenses because they fly inside the atmosphere, below the altitude where midcourse ballistic missile defenses typically operate. Hypersonic weapons can also maneuver unpredictably at high speeds to counter short-range defenses near a target, making it harder to track and intercept them. Ballistic missiles are also difficult to defend against, particularly if they are equipped with countermeasures to confuse midcourse missile defenses and maneuverable warheads to defeat short-range missile defenses. Only very effective long-range defenses would be likely to threaten ballistic missiles in midcourse; to date, no potential U.S. adversaries have deployed such defenses.\n\nHypersonic missiles could cost one-third more to procure and field than ballistic missiles of the same range with maneuverable warheads. CBO estimates that buying 300 ground- or sea-launched, intermediate-range ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads and sustaining the missile system for 20 years would cost a total of $13.4 billion (in 2023 dollars). The same number of comparable hypersonic missiles would cost about one-third more, $17.9 billion, CBO estimates. (Neither estimate includes the cost overruns that are often associated with technically challenging programs.) The higher costs for hypersonic missiles partly reflect the complexity of building systems that can withstand the heat of hypersonic flight.\n\nNotes\n\nUnless this report indicates otherwise, all years referred to are federal fiscal years, which run from October 1 to September 30 and are designated by the calendar year in which they end.\n\nNumbers in the text, tables, and figures may not add up to totals because of rounding.\n\nOn the cover:\n\nLeft: Artist’s rendering of the Air Force’s Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon with the Tactical Boost Glide vehicle at its tip.

The Air Force, Army, and Navy all plan to field hypersonic missiles within the next few years. China and Russia have stated that they are also fielding such weapons.\n\nThe term “hypersonic weapon” is often misapplied. Strictly speaking, it refers to a missile that travels at speeds at least five times the speed of sound in air (Mach 5 or above) and that spends most of its flight inside the Earth’s atmosphere (rather than in space), where it can use aerodynamic design features to maneuver.\n\nThe combination of long range, high speed, and maneuverability distinguishes the hypersonic weapons that DoD is developing from the conventional strike weapons in the U.S. military’s current inventory. Hypersonic missiles are considered a possible counter to the antiaccess and area-denial (A2/AD) systems that potential near-peer adversaries such as China and Russia are deploying to prevent U.S. forces from operating freely in their regions. In theory, hypersonic weapons could be launched from outside the range of those systems and could reach targets within minutes over medium to intermediate ranges (from hundreds to a few thousands of kilometers), with a high degree of accuracy and less vulnerability to defenses than existing missiles.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office analyzed the relative capabilities and possible costs of hypersonic missiles and potential alternatives in scenarios in which long-range, rapid-response weapons might be useful. CBO found that hypersonic missiles with sufficient ranges for A2/AD scenarios—at least 1,000 kilometers (km), or about 600 miles, for missiles launched from aircraft and at least 3,000 km, or about 1,900 miles, for missiles launched from the ground or sea—have the speed to be useful in the early stages of a conflict with a near-peer adversary.\n\nHypersonic missiles with those ranges, however, would be more expensive than similar ballistic missiles and pose much greater technical challenges (see Figure S-1). CBO estimates that hypersonic missiles would cost roughly one-third more than ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads that had the same range and accuracy and traveled at similar speeds. (The United States does not currently field such ballistic missiles, but the technology for them is well developed.)\n\nFigure S-1.\n\nComparison of the Features and Limitations of Hypersonic Missiles and Alternatives\n\nHypersonic weapons could be better than ballistic missiles at penetrating long-range missile defenses that operate outside the atmosphere. So far, however, no potential U.S. adversaries have succeeded in developing such defenses. Against shorter-range defenses, it is unclear whether hypersonic missiles would have an advantage over ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads.\n\nGiven their cost, hypersonic weapons would provide a niche capability, mainly useful to address threats that were both well-defended and extremely time-sensitive (requiring a strike in 15 minutes to 30 minutes). If time was not a concern, much cheaper cruise missiles could be used. If targets were time-sensitive but were not protected by defenses that effectively intercept incoming ballistic missiles in the middle of their flight, less costly ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads could be used.\n\nHow Did CBO Compare Planned Hypersonic Weapons and Possible Alternatives?\n\nTo evaluate hypersonic missiles and potential alternatives, CBO considered possible scenarios for their use and what those scenarios would require in terms of missiles’ range, time to reach their targets (responsiveness), and ability to reach those targets without being intercepted (survivability). Both China and Russia have long-range A2/AD systems that are tailored to prevent the United States from achieving air, land, and sea superiority in their areas during a conflict. A long-distance, highly responsive weapon could be useful in other circumstances, such as when fleeting intelligence was available about the location of a high-value target (a missile launcher or the head of a terrorist organization, for example). CBO concluded that in A2/AD scenarios centered on the South China Sea and the Baltic region, there would probably be a number of time-sensitive, high-value targets for which rapid strikes from longer distances could be useful. In evaluating those scenarios, CBO also considered whether potential adversaries had missile defense systems to defend against an incoming U.S. missile.\n\nCBO identified potential weapons that could be employed in such scenarios and estimated their performance using metrics describing range, responsiveness, and survivability. The weapon systems that CBO considered include existing systems, such as subsonic cruise missiles like the Navy’s Tomahawk Land Attack System, and possible future systems, such as hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic boost-glide missiles like those being developed by DoD. (A cruise missile is powered by an engine throughout its flight; a boost-glide missile is initially accelerated to a high altitude using a rocket and then glides at high speed through the atmosphere to its target.) CBO also considered hypothetical ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads that would provide accuracies similar to those predicted for hypersonic boost-glide missiles.\n\nCBO then narrowed its list of weapon systems to only those technologies that could meet the more demanding requirements for range, responsiveness, and survivability in the relevant scenarios. CBO analyzed the characteristics of each of those systems and estimated the cost to produce them.\n\nWhat Did CBO Find?\n\nTo operate effectively in an adversary’s A2/AD zone, the U.S. military might need to strike a small number of targets in as little as an hour at ranges that could be as long as 3,000 km to 5,000 km (about 1,900 miles to 3,400 miles), CBO estimates. Such targets include coastal air-defense systems, long-range strike systems, and over-the-horizon radars that are essential to maintaining an A2/AD zone. By degrading an adversary’s long-range strike systems and defenses, the United States could limit the effects of A2/AD systems early in a conflict, allowing it to use a broader arsenal of shorter-range and less survivable weapons thereafter.\n\nOf the potential alternatives that CBO examined for those types of missions, only ballistic missiles equipped with maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and hypersonic boost-glide missiles would have the combination of speed and range to strike targets under the strict time constraints associated with the most challenging A2/AD scenarios.\n\nComparison of Hypersonic Boost-Glide Missiles and Ballistic Missiles\n\nCBO concluded that hypersonic missiles combine many features that would present challenges to defense systems designed to intercept ballistic missiles. (Indeed, a main reason that China and Russia have been developing hypersonic weapons is a desire to defeat the United States’ comparatively advanced ballistic missile defense capabilities—both short-range terminal defenses that protect forces in a theater of operations and long-range midcourse defenses that protect the United States itself.) By spending much of their flight inside the atmosphere, hypersonic boost-glide missiles would have an advantage over ballistic missiles in surviving midcourse ballistic missile defense systems, which aim to intercept ballistic missiles in the middle of flight, when those missiles are high above the atmosphere on a predictable and detectable path. That potential advantage for hypersonic boost-glide missiles might become important if a potential U.S. adversary developed midcourse ballistic missile defenses that operated outside the atmosphere and that were effective against countermeasures (such as decoys to fool interceptor missiles).\n\nAgainst shorter-range missile defenses, it is unclear how much advantage hypersonic missiles would have over ballistic missiles equipped with maneuverable reentry vehicles. By flying low, hypersonic missiles could force the surface-based radar associated with short-range defenses to detect a missile later in its flight, shortening the time available for a defense system to intercept it. But because hypersonic missiles use up much of their energy while gliding toward their targets, they are likely to be traveling more slowly than a ballistic missile’s MaRV as it gets close to its target. In addition, both types of missiles can perform preprogrammed maneuvers near their targets to make it harder for short-range defenses to intercept them.\n\nHypersonic weapons also have the potential to create uncertainty about what their ultimate target is. Their low flight profile puts them below the horizon for long-range radar and makes them difficult to track, and their ability to maneuver while gliding makes their path unpredictable. Ballistic missiles equipped with MaRVs could also create target uncertainty by maneuvering during the late stages of flight. But because hypersonic missiles can maneuver during more of their flight, their target uncertainty is greater than for a MaRV. Such uncertainty could be an advantage by making it harder for adversaries to defend against attacks, but it could also cause the target country or nearby countries to misinterpret the United States’ intentions. The importance of that consideration would depend on the details of a particular scenario.\n\nThe United States does not currently field intermediate-range ballistic missiles, in part because some of those missiles were prohibited by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, which the United States was a party to from 1988 to 2019. Over the years, however, the United States has mastered the technological challenges of operating such missiles. For example, in the 1980s, the U.S. military deployed Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads. Both the hypersonic missiles that DoD is currently developing and the ballistic missiles with MaRVs that CBO included in its analysis would probably be accurate enough to strike many fixed targets. However, both missiles would need improved targeting technology (such as a homing seeker or other type of sensor) to improve their accuracy or to enable them to strike moving targets.\n\nHypersonic boost-glide missiles would cost about one-third more than comparable ballistic missiles, in CBO’s estimation. Specifically, CBO estimates that procuring 300 intermediate-range hypersonic boost-glide missiles like the ones being developed by the Army and the Navy and then sustaining the missile system for 20 years would cost a total of $17.9 billion in 2023 dollars (see Table S-1). By comparison, 300 MaRV-equipped ballistic missiles with the same speeds, ranges, and targeting capabilities as those hypersonic missiles would cost a total of $13.4 billion, CBO estimates. If potential adversaries developed effective midcourse defenses against ballistic missiles, the total cost for the ballistic missiles would be slightly higher because of the need to develop more advanced countermeasures to enhance the missiles’ survivability.\n\nTable S-1.\n\nComparison of the Missile Options That CBO Analyzed\n\nChallenges Ahead for Hypersonic Missiles\n\nRealizing the full potential of hypersonic weapons will depend on future success in achieving some of the improvements now being researched and developed, including missile components such as transparent communications windows that can withstand the high heat of extended flights. DoD is taking a phased approach to fielding hypersonic missiles. Early versions of those weapons will have capabilities at the lower end of the desired ranges and will not be able to locate targets autonomously or maneuver in response to attacks by missile defenses. However, those early hypersonic missiles may be able to carry out small maneuvers on preplanned trajectories to make them more difficult for defenses to track and intercept. Further enhancements would increase the risks of cost increases and schedule overruns.\n\nWhat Are Some Limitations of CBO’s Analysis?\n\nThe models that CBO used to estimate missile performance are based on publicly available data and do not incorporate classified technical specifications or the results of ongoing testing. To reflect uncertainty about current and likely future performance, CBO presents a range for its model results. In addition, CBO’s estimates of the costs of various missile options are derived from statements about planned inventories of hypersonic weapons by public officials and program offices. Large changes in the number of missiles purchased or problems in overcoming technical challenges could alter the relative costs of the options.\n\nChapter 1Hypersonic Missiles and Their Policy Implications\n\nA cornerstone of U.S. defense planning is the ability to establish and maintain freedom of military action anywhere around the globe if a crisis occurs. Such freedom of action is enabled by superior air and maritime forces that can neutralize defensive and offensive systems that adversaries could use to attack U.S. forces and prevent them from operating freely. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has used its strategy of military superiority successfully against adversaries with limited military capabilities, at least during the initial combat phase of a conflict.\n\nIn recent decades, however, potential adversaries such as China and Russia have worked to diminish the United States’ military advantage by developing advanced weapons with long ranges that could keep U.S. forces from operating in large areas—a strategy known as anti­access and area denial. With the Department of Defense shifting its focus from conducting counterinsurgency operations in the Middle East and elsewhere to deterring near-peer military competitors, the challenges of operating in an A2/AD environment have come to dominate DoD’s planning.\n\nVarious approaches can be used to defeat A2/AD systems. One is to develop aircraft that have stealth characteristics that can help them elude air defenses (as the Air Force did during the Cold War and continues to do today by fielding F-35 stealth fighter aircraft and developing the B-21 stealth bomber). Another approach that DoD is taking now is to develop long-range, high-speed missiles that carry conventional (nonnuclear) weapons. Long range enables the missiles’ launchers to stay out of reach of offensive A2/AD systems; high speed makes the missiles harder to intercept and lets them reach their targets more quickly from long distances. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all developing hypersonic missiles, which can fly at speeds faster than Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound) in the atmosphere during much of their flight.\n\nBesides concern about potential adversaries’ A2/AD systems, another stated rationale for developing hypersonic missiles is the sense that the United States has fallen behind those adversaries in hypersonic missile technology. The United States has performed foundational research into the technological challenges of flying at hypersonic speeds since at least the 1950s. Over the decades since then, both U.S. allies and potential adversaries have also conducted research into hypersonic missiles. In recent years, advances in aerodynamics, materials science, and computational science have enabled them to make significant progress. Both Russia and China have announced in the past few years that they have developed and fielded hypersonic missiles. Russia is believed to have used a missile that it classified as hypersonic in its war with Ukraine.\n\nThe United States has not yet fielded such weapons, for both scientific and policy reasons. Hypersonic missiles are expensive, and there have been questions about the value of the capabilities they might provide. Achieving the desired performance for those weapons would require significant investment in additional research. Nevertheless, because of their potential, the U.S. military has established accelerated programs for hypersonic missiles, sharply increasing its support and funding, testing prototypes, and creating units in anticipation of fielding the weapons in the next few years.\n\nBasics of Hypersonic Missiles\n\nMissiles are considered to be hypersonic not only on the basis of their speed but also on the basis of their flight profile and means of control. The harshness of the environment around a hypersonic missile as it flies makes designing such missiles challenging. (For explanations of missile speeds and other terminology, see Box 1-1.)\n\nBox 1-1.\n\nMissile Concepts and Terminology\n\nSpeeds\n\nsubsonic: less than the speed of sound in the air at sea level—that is, less than Mach 1 (767 miles per hour)\n\nsupersonic: from one to five times the speed of sound in the air at sea level—that is, Mach 1 to Mach 5 (767 miles per hour to 3,836 miles per hour)\n\nhypersonic: more than five times the speed of sound in the air at sea level—that is, more than Mach 5 (3,836 miles per hour)\n\nRanges\n\nshort range: less than 1,000 kilometers (km, or 621 miles)\n\nmedium range: between 1,000 km and 3,000 km (621 miles to 1,864 miles)\n\nintermediate range: between 3,000 km and 5,500 km (1,864 miles to 3,418 miles)\n\nintercontinental range: more than 5,500 km (3,418 miles)\n\nMiscellaneous Characteristics\n\nresponsiveness: a measure of a missile’s ability to reach its target (cover its range) in a timely fashion\n\nsurvivability: a measure of a missile’s ability to not be intercepted en route to its target\n\nconventional: nonnuclear\n\nTypes of Missiles and Components\n\nballistic missile: a missile that consists of a warhead and a guidance system mounted on a rocket motor (or booster). At launch, the booster propels the missile up and out of the atmosphere at high speed. Once the missile is above the atmosphere and the motor has shut down, the booster is jettisoned. The warhead then travels an unpowered, arcing path to its target, much like the path of a ball thrown up in the air (see the figure).\n\nNotional Flight Paths for Different Ballistic and Boost-Glide Missile Trajectories With the Same Range\n\nhypersonic missile: a missile that travels within the atmosphere (rather than above it) at speeds greater than Mach 5 and that can maneuver in the atmosphere for much of its flight. Hypersonic missiles can take various forms, such as boost-glide missiles or cruise missiles.\n\nboost-glide missile: a missile that consists of a rocket motor, which accelerates the missile to a high speed, and a glide body containing a warhead. After the glide body detaches from the spent rocket, it uses its kinetic and potential energy, as well as lift generated by its movement through the air, to coast at high speed through the atmosphere and maneuver to hit its target.\n\ncruise missile: a missile that typically flies at low altitudes (ranging from less than 100 meters for a subsonic cruise missile to about 30 km to 40 km for a hypersonic cruise missile) and that is powered throughout its flight. A hypersonic cruise missile is initially accelerated to speeds approaching hypersonic by a rocket booster, then accelerates and maintains speed throughout its flight using a jet engine called a supersonic combustion ramjet (or scramjet) that operates at speeds above Mach 4.\n\nmaneuverable reentry vehicle: a ballistic missile warhead capable of correcting its trajectory when it reenters the atmosphere, increasing its accuracy.\n\nTypes of Launch\n\nair-launched: launched from aircraft in flight\n\nground-launched: launched from fixed or mobile (vehicle-based) launchers on land\n\nsea-launched: launched from surface ships or submarines\n\nFlight Phases and Paths\n\nboost phase: the period from a missile’s launch until its rocket booster shuts down. During the boost phase, the missile is powered by the rocket motor. The length of this phase depends on the desired speed of the missile when the booster shuts down. For intermediate-range missiles, the boost phase can last as long as two to three minutes.\n\nmidcourse phase: for a ballistic missile, the period from the end of the boost phase until the warhead reenters the atmosphere. During the midcourse phase, the warhead is coasting above the atmosphere on an arcing path. This phase is the longest part of a ballistic missile’s flight. For intermediate-range ballistic missiles, it lasts roughly 10 minutes to 20 minutes.\n\nterminal phase: for a ballistic missile, the period from reentry into the atmosphere until the warhead reaches its target. This phase is very short, generally less than one minute.\n\nglide phase: for a boost-glide missile, the period during which the glide body is coasting in the atmosphere. For the intermediate-range boost-glide missiles now being developed, the glide phase may last for 10 minutes to 20 minutes.\n\nminimum-energy trajectory: the flight path that maximizes the range of a ballistic missile.\n\ndepressed trajectory: a lower, but still ballistic, path that shortens the flight time and reduces the range of a ballistic missile.\n\nWhat Is a Hypersonic Missile?\n\n“Hypersonic” refers to speeds above Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound in air. (Although the speed of sound varies by altitude and depends on the density and temperature of the air, in most discussions of hypersonic weapons, that speed is measured at sea level under standard conditions, a convention that CBO uses as well.) Mach 5 is generally considered to describe an aerodynamic regime that is different from that of lower speeds—specifically, where heating becomes so significant that it dominates the physics of air flow around a moving object, such as an aircraft or a missile. For example, the transition between smooth flow and turbulent flow along the body of such an object becomes much more difficult to predict above Mach 5. That condition has implications for the heating of the object’s surface and for the performance of aerodynamic control surfaces that allow the object to maneuver.\n\nThus, technically speaking, “hypersonic” refers only to travel at speeds above Mach 5 within the Earth’s atmosphere, where interaction between the aircraft and molecules of air takes place. Spacecraft routinely travel at speeds well above Mach 5, and all but the shortest-range ballistic missiles also spend most of their flight at speeds above Mach 5 outside the atmosphere. But those flights are not considered hypersonic because they do not have the associated challenges of extended interactions with the air. Spacecraft or ballistic missiles that reenter the atmosphere near the end of their flight also face extreme heating at that point, but briefly. What distinguishes hypersonic missiles is that they have to contend with thermal effects throughout most of their flight.\n\nAnother defining characteristic of hypersonic missiles is that they depend on aerodynamic control surfaces (such as wings or tail fins) to glide and maneuver, like an aircraft, rather than using thrusters, like a spacecraft. Air is necessary for control surfaces to function, so a hypersonic missile must be within the atmosphere to maneuver.\n\nThe U.S. military is developing two types of hypersonic missiles: boost-glide missiles and cruise missiles. Both types need air to operate for reasons besides maneuvering. A hypersonic boost-glide missile consists of a rocket motor that accelerates the missile to a high altitude and speed and a glide body that detaches from the spent rocket. In addition to the kinetic and potential energy from its initial acceleration, the glide body uses lift generated by its movement through the air to extend its range and maneuver to hit its target (see Box 1-1).\n\nA hypersonic cruise missile is also initially accelerated to a high speed by a rocket booster. After that, it accelerates and maintains speed throughout its flight by using a type of jet engine known as a supersonic combustion ramjet (or scramjet). A scramjet uses oxygen from the air to burn its fuel, rather than carrying an oxidizer, as a rocket does, so it is known as an air-breather. Scramjets require supersonic air flow and only begin to operate at speeds above Mach 4. Although air-breathing engines tend to be smaller and lighter than rocket engines that carry both fuel and oxidizer, that size advantage is lessened by the size of the rocket booster used for the initial acceleration.\n\nDesign Challenges for Hypersonic Flight\n\nFor a missile traveling at hypersonic speeds in the atmosphere, the intense effects of heating during much of the flight influence every aspect of the missile’s design. Heating creates the need for special materials to handle extreme temperatures for many minutes. It also affects the stability of the flight as well as communications and targeting for the missile.\n\nHeating and Thermal Shielding. Moving at very high speeds within the atmosphere creates thermal challenges for an object such as a hypersonic glide body. The leading edge (the nose cone or the front edge of a wing) compresses the air ahead of the object, heating the air. The more rapidly the air is compressed, the hotter it will become. Drag also generates heat along any exposed surfaces, but to a lesser degree than air compression does. As the object moves through the heated air, its surfaces will begin to warm.\n\nStructural materials for objects that travel at hypersonic speeds must be able to withstand high temperatures for the duration of the flight inside the atmosphere without significantly deforming or melting. The lower the heat tolerance of the material used to build the object, the greater the need for heat shielding, such as the ceramic plates used on the space shuttles that were operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The choice of materials for an object’s structure and heat shielding has a significant effect on the object’s weight and cost.\n\nAir behaves differently at different temperatures, which has major implications for the materials needed at those temperatures. As air warms, its molecules increasingly vibrate. At temperatures over 2,000 Kelvin (3,140° Fahrenheit), the air molecules can be ripped apart. And at temperatures above 4,000 K (6,740° F), the atoms from those molecules will lose some of their electrons (become ionized), and the surrounding gas will be in a plasma state. Plasma effectively absorbs radio frequency signals, affecting the ability to communicate or use radar.\n\nDoD has suggested that, according to its modeling of the first-generation hypersonic boost-glide missiles it is developing, temperatures around most of the body of a missile are likely to remain within a range of 1,000 K to 2,000 K, below the threshold for plasma formation. Materials that have the potential to withstand those temperatures without melting or losing structural integrity include high-performance alloys known as superalloys. For the parts of a missile exposed to higher temperatures, exotic materials such as ceramic composites and materials made from carbon fibers, which have melting temperatures around 3,500 K, can be used. Carbon-carbon composites, such as those used on the space shuttle, have been shown to withstand heat of more than 2,000 K. Those high-performance materials are especially difficult and expensive to manufacture—factors that could limit the speeds and ranges at which hypersonic missiles can operate.\n\nFlying at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere for more than a few minutes presents challenges greater than those of reentering the atmosphere. Materials routinely used on reentry vehicles (such as ballistic missiles and the space shuttle) work over the shorter time frame associated with reentry to absorb heat or dissipate it through chemical processes. Such materials are not sufficient for hypersonic flight because they will eventually conduct heat inward or be used up.\n\nStability and Maneuvering. At speeds greater than the speed of sound (over Mach 1), a shock wave is produced ahead of a moving body, resulting in what is known as a sonic boom. When speeds reach the hypersonic regime (over Mach 5), the boundary between the shock wave and the moving body—the shock layer—can become very thin. In addition, the air near the moving body is very hot and can be chemically altered. One of the biggest challenges that designers of hypersonic missiles face is predicting the behavior of the shock layer. The transition from smooth to turbulent air flow around a moving body can disrupt its stability and cause sudden, localized increases in temperature. High-speed computing has been fundamental to advancing understanding of that phenomenon in recent years.\n\nManeuvers such as turns increase drag, adding to a missile’s thermal load (the heat it experiences during flight, which is a function of temperature and time). Increased drag slows the missile considerably, reducing its range. Those factors tend to limit how much a hypersonic missile can maneuver.\n\nCommunications and Targeting. DoD has stated that its hypersonic boost-glide missiles will be able to emit and receive radio signals, such as those from the Global Positioning System (GPS). That statement implies that portions of a missile’s glide body where transmitters and receivers are located will remain below the temperature threshold for plasma formation in the surrounding air, as DoD’s modeling suggested might be the case. Even so, the intersection of materials, temperature, and communications remains a challenge in designing hypersonic missiles, as ongoing research by organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has shown. Although the sensitive electronics necessary for communications must be adequately shielded from a missile’s exterior temperatures, the missile needs to have windows (called radomes) through which signals can be emitted or received. The materials for such radomes are inherently difficult to develop because they must allow radio frequency or infrared radiation to pass through them while also providing significant thermal shielding.\n\nScramjet Technology. An additional challenge in developing hypersonic cruise missiles is designing engine components that can maintain proper air–fuel mixing at the right temperature, air pressure, and density for a supersonic combustion ramjet to operate for the duration of a missile’s flight. That challenge has been likened to the difficulty of keeping a match lit in a hurricane. Before 2022, the United States had successfully operated a scramjet for only a few minutes. But the recent successful demonstration of a scramjet implies that several design challenges have been overcome. Nonetheless, engineering hurdles remain in the development of hypersonic cruise missiles, which must meet size, range, and speed requirements while also managing the thermal and aerodynamic challenges of hypersonic flight described above for boost-glide missiles.\n\nA Brief History of U.S. Hypersonic Research\n\nResearch to overcome the challenges of hypersonic flight has been going on since World War II, when Germany developed the V-2, a ballistic missile that traveled faster than Mach 5 for part of its flight. Soon after the war, the United States built its first wind tunnel for aero­dynamic testing at hypersonic speeds and began developing its first intercontinental ballistic missiles. From 1959 to 1968, the United States test-flew a piloted hypersonic aircraft called the X-15, a research project that contributed to the development of NASA’s piloted spacecraft. During that era, scientists made enough progress in aerodynamic design and advanced materials to address the challenges of extreme heating that ballistic missiles and spacecraft encounter briefly when they reenter the Earth’s atmosphere. The greater challenges posed by extended flight and maneuvering through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds and extreme temperatures remained the subject of active research programs.\n\nHypersonic flight continues to be extraordinarily challenging. But in recent years, computational science and materials science have advanced enough to transition to developing practical technologies for use in operational hypersonic missiles.\n\nTechnology for Hypersonic Boost-Glide Missiles\n\nThe modern era of DoD’s involvement in research into hypersonic boost-glide missiles has roots in the Sandia Winged Energetic Reentry Vehicle Experiment (SWERVE) project, which began in the 1970s (see Figure 1-1). In 1985, the SWERVE project successfully tested a design for a missile glide body.\n\nFigure 1-1.\n\nProgression of DoD’s Research Programs for Hypersonic Boost-Glide Missiles\n\nA second track of missile research began in 2003 when DARPA started the Force Application and Launch From Continental United States (FALCON) project. That project was designed to study technologies that would extend the reach of U.S. missiles so they could be launched from the continental United States rather than from locations closer to their targets.\n\nIn 2008, lawmakers established the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program to advance some of the technology originated by the FALCON project. The new program focused on a concept for an intercontinental-range hypersonic glider known as the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2. Reports at the time suggest that the program’s rationale was to reduce the U.S. military’s reliance on strategically located bases in multiple regions, for two reasons. First, strategic locations change over time, and they are not always known or available far enough in advance to allow the U.S. military to establish bases there. Second, growth in the size of adversaries’ antiaccess and area-denial regions created a desire for long-range weapons that could destroy an adversary’s air defenses and strike its mobile offensive systems early (or, in some cases, later) in a conflict.\n\nOther technology under consideration for that mission included putting conventional warheads on some of the Navy’s Trident missiles—long-range, submarine-launched ballistic missiles that were previously armed with nuclear warheads. The Conventional Trident Modification (CTM) program envisioned a nonnuclear warhead carried by a maneuverable reentry vehicle that would provide the greater accuracy that a conventional warhead requires to compensate for its much lower explosive power. The CTM program was first funded by the Navy in 2007. It was later canceled by lawmakers because of concerns that an adversary seeing a CTM launch might think the United States was launching a nuclear-armed Trident missile and might respond with a nuclear attack of its own. To avoid such confusion, the United States has generally maintained different types of missiles to carry nuclear warheads and conventional warheads.\n\nAfter the CTM program was canceled, the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program continued working on the intercontinental Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2, conducting test flights in 2010 and 2011. The second test in 2011 failed when contact with the vehicle was lost. After that, the program’s funding was sharply reduced. In 2012, DoD began to shift its focus to shorter-range hypersonic missiles, and “global” was dropped from the program’s name, which became simply Conventional Prompt Strike.\n\nDuring the same period, the Army began the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon program, which built on the glide-body design of the earlier SWERVE project. The Advanced Hypersonic Weapon was successfully tested in 2011 but failed during the boost stage of a flight test in 2014.\n\nDespite reductions in their funding after test failures, those early 21st-century programs led to the two main efforts that DoD is pursuing today to develop hypersonic boost-glide missiles:\n\nThe Advanced Hypersonic Weapon evolved into the Common Hypersonic Glide Body. That glide-body design forms the basis for missiles that the Army and Navy are developing, the Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and the Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike. (The Air Force also had a program based on the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, known as the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, but it was canceled in 2020.)\n\nThe Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2 evolved into DARPA’s Tactical Boost Glide vehicle, which forms the basis for the Air Force’s current program to develop the medium-range Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon.\n\nTechnology for Hypersonic Cruise Missiles\n\nResearch on supersonic combustion ramjet engines began in the 1950s. But the first successful flight test of a scramjet did not occur until 2002, when Australia’s HyShot aircraft flew for a few seconds on a parabolic trajectory under scramjet power. Two years later, NASA’s scramjet-powered X-43 successfully flew several tests in horizontal flight. The X-43 holds the record for the fastest jet-powered aircraft, having reached a speed of Mach 9.6 with the scramjet engine operating for 10 seconds during a flight test in 2004. Later development focused on the Air Force’s X-51 program. A scramjet-powered X-51 aircraft was successfully flown in 2013 at Mach 5.1 for 210 seconds.\n\nThe research from those programs is being applied to several current efforts to develop an operational hypersonic cruise missile. Although scramjet technology appears to be maturing, integrating the engine into a missile that is small enough to be tactically useful will require significant further efforts. Trade-offs exist between speed, size, and range that might be addressed with improvements to fuel efficiency. Such improvements are being explored in laboratory testing and with modeling and simulation.\n\nMuch of the research into hypersonic cruise missiles being conducted worldwide is exploring the use of hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen has many characteristics that make it desirable for use in scramjets, such as high flammability and high caloric value (a measure of the energy that can be extracted during combustion). Hydrogen-fueled scramjets could theoretically operate at speeds higher than Mach 20. And many researchers prefer hydrogen to hydrocarbon-based fossil fuels for environmental reasons, because it produces only water as a byproduct. But hydrogen fuels also have downsides. Their extreme volatility increases safety concerns during the storage and handling of a missile, and their lower density than hydrocarbon fuels makes it harder to design a missile with the sort of range that DoD wants. For those reasons, DoD is likely to use hydrocarbon fuels in hypersonic cruise missiles, which would limit their maximum speed to about Mach 9.\n\nDoD’s Current Hypersonic Missile Programs\n\nThe Department of Defense has spent more than $8 billion since 2019 on programs to develop hypersonic missiles. Those programs include separate efforts by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to develop hypersonic boost-glide missiles; collaborations among DARPA, the Air Force, and the Navy to research technology for hypersonic cruise missiles; and various research programs for missile components (discussed in Appendix A). In its latest five-year budget plan, the 2023 Future Years Defense Program, DoD is requesting $13 billion over the 2023–2027 period for developing hypersonic missiles and almost $2 billion for procuring missiles. (The procurement request represents only Army and Air Force programs; the Navy has not yet requested procurement funding for the hypersonic missile it is developing.)\n\nThis section describes DoD’s major hypersonic missile efforts and the research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) funding provided or requested for them. Those funding numbers are in nominal dollars, meaning that they have not been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation.\n\nDoD has stated that the urgency of hypersonic missile development outweighs the need for traditional oversight, so its three boost-glide missile programs are proceeding outside the usual acquisition process, under an approach called rapid prototyping. The RDT&E funding described below for those programs is for advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity level 4) and, starting in 2023 for the Army’s program, for system development and demonstration (budget activity level 5). In DoD’s development strategy for hypersonic boost-glide missiles, the versions fielded initially will have the capabilities of the prototype missiles. Full-capability versions will be fielded later.\n\nThe Army and the Navy are developing separate missile systems, but they are collaborating on a joint glide body for those missiles—the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, or C-HGB (see Figure 1-2)—and a common two-stage booster. The Navy is responsible for designing the glide body and the booster, and the Army is responsible for producing them. (The Air Force participated in that collaboration until 2020, when it chose to focus on a different glide-body design for its boost-glide missile.) The Army and Navy will use identical glide bodies but plan to separately develop different launch platforms for the missiles.\n\nFigure 1-2.\n\nDepiction of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body\n\nThe Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon\n\nThe Army’s boost-glide missile, the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), is intended to be launched from the ground using mobile transporter-­erector-launcher (TEL) vehicles. An LRHW battery will consist of four TELs, eight missiles, and one operations center for the battery. Most of the performance characteristics of the LRHW are classified, but its range has been publicly stated as exceeding 2,775 kilometers (km, or about 1,724 miles).\n\nThe LRHW program has been funded since 2020 and has received $1.7 billion through 2022. DoD requested $807 million for the missile in 2023 (see Table 1-1). In that budget request, the Army estimated that RDT&E for the program would conclude in 2027, at a total cost of $5.3 billion.\n\nTable 1-1.\n\nU.S. Hypersonic Weapons Programs and Their RDT&E Funding\n\nThe LRHW program has completed successful flight tests of a prototype missile, but it has also experienced test failures in recent years. Several more flight tests, to be conducted jointly with the Navy, are scheduled through 2028. The Army expects to field initial prototype LRHW missiles in 2023 and two additional batteries in 2025 and 2027, respectively. DoD’s 2023 budget request includes $249 million in procurement funding to purchase LRHWs.\n\nThe Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike\n\nThe Navy’s boost-glide missile, which will also carry the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, is a sea-launched missile called the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IR-CPS). The Navy’s original plan was to field the IR-CPS on Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines, using the Virginia payload module, a multimissile launcher that is planned to be built into newer versions of those submarines. To deploy the missiles sooner, the Navy now plans to field them on existing Zumwalt class destroyers first and then develop the launch capabilities for Virginia class submarines. The specifications of the IR-CPS are classified, but its range is expected to be about the same as that of the Army’s LRHW (greater than 2,775 km).\n\nThe IR-CPS program has been funded by the Navy since 2019 and has received $2.6 billion through 2022. DoD requested $1.2 billion for the program in 2023. The Navy expects research and development on the IR-CPS to continue past 2027, at a total cost of more than $9 billion.\n\nThe Navy’s version of the boost-glide missile is expected to take longer to develop than the Army’s version for several reasons. First, the timing of the IR-CPS was initially linked to the timing of the Virginia payload module. Second, launching a missile from a submarine requires a “cold launch,” in which the missile is ejected from the launch tube by a gas generator before the missile ignites. That process is more complicated than the “hot launch” used for ground-launched missiles such as the Army’s LRHW. In a hot launch, the missile ignites and is propelled out of the launcher by its own exhaust.\n\nThe Navy had intended to demonstrate a prototype-­capability IR-CPS in 2022, but the missile failed its first flight test in 2022. Joint flight tests with the Army are scheduled to continue through 2028. The Navy plans to demonstrate a cold-launch prototype in 2024, field proto­type missiles on Zumwalt class destroyers in 2025, and field full-capability missiles on Virginia class submarines in 2028.\n\nThe Air Force’s Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon\n\nThe hypersonic boost-glide missile that the Air Force is developing, the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), is based not on the Army and Navy’s common glide body but on the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) vehicle developed by DARPA (see Figure 1-3). The ARRW missile is designed to be launched from B-52 bombers, although there is discussion about using additional launch platforms, such as B-1 bombers. The Air Force has released some technical information about the missile: Its range will be at least 926 km (about 575 miles), and its booster will consist of a single-stage solid rocket motor.\n\nFigure 1-3.\n\nDepiction of the Tactical Boost Glide Vehicle Being Carried by an ARRW Missile\n\nThe ARRW program received a total of nearly $1.2 billion in RDT&E funding from 2019 to 2022. For 2023, DoD requested $115 million for RDT&E and $46 million for missile procurement. Separately, DARPA has spent $555 million on the TBG program so far and requested $30 million for 2023.\n\nThe first flight test of the current development effort was not successful, but it was followed by several successful flight tests. The Air Force’s 2022 budget request to purchase 12 ARRWs was cut by lawmakers, leaving questions about when and in what quantity the missiles will initially be fielded. The $46 million procurement request for 2023 is intended to fund one missile.\n\nOther Hypersonic Programs\n\nBesides the military’s three programs to develop hypersonic boost-glide missiles, the Army and DARPA are developing ground-based launchers for boost-glide missiles. In addition, the Air Force, the Navy, and DARPA are working on technology for hypersonic cruise missiles.\n\nOpFires Launchers. The Army is continuing development work on DARPA’s Operational Fires (OpFires) program, which demonstrated a flexible ground-based launch system for short-range hypersonic boost-glide missiles, capable of launching multiple payloads at a variety of ranges. OpFires has been funded through DARPA since 2018 and has received $169 million through 2022. The Army spent a total of $55 million on OpFires in 2021 and 2022 and requested $11 million for 2023. Budget documents indicate that the launch system will be fielded along with the LRHW in 2023.\n\nHypersonic Cruise Missiles. DoD is also developing hypersonic cruise missiles, which are based on scramjet technology. DARPA has been funding research on scramjets under the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program since 2014; the program has received $195 million through 2022. For 2023, DoD requested $60 million for the program, whose name has been changed to MoHAWC. The Air Force and the Navy have both been collaborating with DARPA on scramjet research, and each service now has its own program to develop a hypersonic cruise missile.\n\nThe Air Force’s effort, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program, received $190 million in 2022. An additional $462 million was requested for 2023. The program is described in budget documents as aiming to achieve a long-range, prompt strike capability, building on technology developed through DARPA’s HAWC program. Three companies received funding to develop a prototype HACM; two of the prototypes were successfully demonstrated in 2021 and 2022. The prototype developed by Raytheon and Northrop Grumman reportedly flew more than 500 km, but it is unclear how long the scramjet was operating during that flight.\n\nThe Navy was also involved in flight tests during DARPA’s HAWC program. It requested $92 million in 2023 for its own cruise missile development program: the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) Increment 2, commonly known as the Hypersonic Air-Launched OASuW (HALO) program. Funding documents indicate that the Navy plans to field HALO missiles starting in 2028.\n\nDesign specifications for those various cruise missiles have not been publicly released. For a hypersonic (or any) cruise missile, design trade-offs exist between speed, size, and range.\n\nThe Path Forward for U.S. Hypersonic Missiles\n\nIn addition to the programs discussed above, DARPA and the laboratories of the military services are funding many research programs related to hypersonic flight. The topics of that research provide insights into the technological challenges that remain in fielding hypersonic missiles. For example, many of those research programs seek to develop technical knowledge or components that will increase the range or payload of hypersonic missiles or enhance the ability to control them for maneuvering and targeting. (For more details about those programs, see Appendix A.)\n\nDoD has stated that the hypersonic missiles currently in development will be developed and fielded in stages. The existence of ongoing research efforts to increase the range, maneuverability, and targeting capabilities of the next generation of hypersonic missiles suggests that the initial versions fielded by DoD will lack some of the performance and features often attributed to hypersonic missiles. As a result, it appears likely that DoD’s first generation of hypersonic weapons will operate at or below the minimum ranges associated with the range categories for missiles (see Box 1-1). For instance, intermediate-range missiles are defined as reaching between 3,000 km and 5,500 km, but the range of the Army’s and Navy’s intermediate-range hypersonic boost-glide missiles (LRHW and IR-CPS) is expected to be about 3,000 km because heating will limit the speeds those missiles can sustain.\n\nThermal challenges also suggest that those missiles will be limited in what maneuvers they can perform, because their trajectories will be designed to minimize thermal stresses on the missiles. Furthermore, DoD’s first-­generation hypersonic missiles are not expected to have the accuracy or sensors needed to operate effectively in situations in which targets may be moving.\n\nPolicy Issues Related to Hypersonic Missiles\n\nAs significant progress has been made on the development of hypersonic missiles over the past decade, support for such weapons appears to have broadened in the United States. Potential reasons include the rise of China as a technological and military power, the pivot in U.S. defense policy toward a greater focus on China and Russia as near-peer competitors, and announcements by those two countries that they have overcome technological challenges and fielded hypersonic missiles. Nevertheless, hypersonic missiles could be seen as costly and unnecessary given the diverse arsenal of strike weapons that the U.S. military already possesses and given the immature state of potential adversaries’ defenses against current U.S. missiles. Ultimately, whether hypersonic missiles are affordable and useful will depend on whether remaining technological hurdles can be overcome and at what cost.\n\nBeyond general considerations of usefulness and cost—which would apply to any new weapon system—other policy issues are specifically associated with deploying hypersonic missiles. The most prominent of those issues involve hypersonic missiles’ potential to confuse adversaries about the United States’ nuclear intentions and their potential to escalate crises.\n\nNuclear Ambiguity\n\nNuclear ambiguity occurs when an adversary is uncertain about whether an incoming missile is armed with a nuclear or a conventional warhead. That uncertainty can lead the adversary to respond with nuclear weapons if it thinks it may be coming under a nuclear attack. The desire to avoid a nuclear response to a conventional strike is a significant, widely agreed upon principle of U.S. security policy. The Navy’s Conventional Trident Modification program of the early 2000s was canceled largely because lawmakers were concerned that a Trident missile armed with a conventional warhead would be indistinguishable from one armed with a nuclear warhead.\n\nAlthough the U.S. military has generally used different missiles for conventional and nuclear warheads, there is precedent for fielding nuclear and conventional versions of the same or very similar missiles. Examples include the Navy’s Tomahawk Land Attack Missile and the Air Force’s Air-Launched Cruise Missile. During the Conventional Trident Modification program, methods were proposed to ensure that adversaries could distinguish conventional from nuclear Tridents. Those proposals included having the conventional missiles use a different trajectory and maneuvering capabilities that would keep them from flying over countries other than the United States and the intended target.\n\nCrisis Instability\n\nRegardless of ambiguity about the nature of a missile’s payload, the compressed time frames associated with a strike by a conventional hypersonic missile could be seen as fundamentally destabilizing during a conflict. A missile capable of flying 3,000 km in only about 15 minutes would allow little time for an adversary to make a well-thought-out response. The same issue would exist with conventionally armed ballistic missiles because their travel times would be similar to those of boost-glide missiles.\n\nIn addition, the maneuverability of hypersonic missiles creates uncertainty about their targets. When a ballistic missile is launched, despite its extreme speed, its general destination is roughly calculable—both because its high trajectory makes it observable to powerful terrestrial radar (as explained in Chapter 3) and because its ability to change its path after its rocket booster burns out is limited. A ballistic missile equipped with a maneuverable reentry vehicle probably could maneuver by no more than several tens of kilometers after reentering the atmosphere, whereas a hypersonic boost-glide missile could theoretically strike largely undetected anywhere within a radius of several thousand kilometers.\n\nA hypersonic boost-glide missile would probably be detected at launch (if the adversary had space-based infrared sensors with the ability to do so and in the correct position). But the difficulties of tracking the boost-glide missile through its lower-altitude flight, combined with its much greater ability to change direction, mean that potential adversaries might not know whether they or another country in the region was the intended target. That target uncertainty could increase the likelihood of a response (accidental or otherwise) before the actual nature of the attack was known.\n\nChapter 2Scenarios That Define Potential Requirements for Hypersonic Missiles\n\nThe U.S. military’s arsenal includes a wide variety of guided weapons that can be used to attack targets on land. Those weapons have ranges that vary from as short as a few kilometers (for the Joint Direct Attack Munition) to more than 1,500 kilometers (for the Tomahawk cruise missile) and speeds that vary from well below the speed of sound (for the AGM-154 glide bomb) to more than three times the speed of sound (for the Army Tactical Missile System). With that variety available, why is the Department of Defense interested in pursuing new and relatively expensive hypersonic missiles?\n\nLonger ranges and higher speeds are the main attributes that distinguish the hypersonic weapons DoD is developing from the conventional strike weapons in today’s inventory. Long range and high speed are nearly always desirable characteristics for a strike weapon, but they can be expensive. DoD’s shift in focus, to potential conflicts with near-peer adversaries that have advanced militaries, has brought those characteristics to the fore. Of specific concern are potential conflicts with China or Russia, both of which have advanced air defenses, long-range bombers and missiles, and antiship missiles. With those systems, Chinese or Russian forces could establish large areas in which U.S. forces would be vulnerable to attack.\n\nSuch an antiaccess, area-denial strategy would reduce U.S. combat power and give an adversary greater freedom of action. In particular, the A2/AD weapon systems that China and Russia have deployed could force the U.S. military to use ground- or ship-launched weapons from as far as 4,000 km (about 2,500 miles) away and air-launched weapons from at least 1,000 km (about 600 miles) away. Launching such weapons from shorter distances would put the launchers and the units operating them at greater risk. Long-range weapons with high speeds could be launched from areas of lower risk but not take too much time to cover the longer distances to their targets.\n\nThis chapter describes, in general terms, the planning scenarios for near-peer adversaries that DoD is currently using and their implications for the performance requirements of weapons designed to overcome the A2/AD threats found in those scenarios. In any conflict, combatants try to establish A2/AD zones to protect their own forces and territory and to limit where their opponents can safely operate. But near-peer adversaries pose particular A2/AD challenges because they are likely to possess longer-range weapons (and the ability to target them) in greater numbers than less advanced adversaries do. In particular, China and Russia both have many offensive and defensive weapon systems capable of establishing challenging A2/AD environments. Beyond those challenges, other types of scenarios could also affect the U.S. military’s requirements for hypersonic missiles.\n\nChina\n\nDisputes over territory in the South China Sea have occurred in recent years. The People’s Republic of China has threatened at times to take the island of Taiwan by force. And the United States has indicated in increasingly explicit ways its intent to come to Taiwan’s aid should China attempt to do so. In addition, if the Chinese military tried to coerce other U.S. allies in the Pacific or shut down access to sea lanes there, the United States could choose to respond militarily.\n\nIf a conflict erupted in the region, China has a variety of A2/AD weapons that could pose challenges to the United States and its allies. At present, China’s antiship and air defenses have the potential to limit U.S. naval and air access to much of the South China Sea, particularly because China could extend the reach of those weapons by basing them on disputed islands in the South China Sea, such as those in the Paracel and Spratly chains. Chinese surface-to-air missiles and antiship cruise missiles located on the mainland could cover an area with an estimated radius of 400 km, potentially including Taiwan (see Figure 2-1). If those missiles were located on the Paracel Islands—which China has claimed sovereignty over, in violation of international law—China’s reach into the South China Sea could be roughly doubled.\n\nFigure 2-1.\n\nApproximate Coverage Areas of China’s Potential A2/AD Defenses\n\nIn addition, Chinese DF-21D antiship ballistic missiles have a range of 1,500 km. DF-26 antiship ballistic missiles may reach as far as 4,000 km, but their actual capabilities are not yet clear and would require that China have an intelligence and surveillance system that could detect and track targets at those long ranges with enough accuracy for the missiles to find their targets. Chinese H-6K bombers flying from an inland base could reach 3,500 km offshore, and SU-30MKK fighter aircraft have a range of 1,350 km.\n\nChina also employs modern air defenses, most of which were purchased from Russia or designed in Russia and licensed for production in China. The most notable are the S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, which have maximum ranges of a few hundred kilometers. China has also fielded a variety of shorter-range air-defense systems that could engage naval aircraft in the region or land-based fighters and bombers. Those defenses would be less effective against cruise missiles, such as the Tomahawk, that fly a few hundred feet above the surface to avoid detection until they are close to their targets. But such defensive systems would still have some capabilities against low-flying missiles at short ranges.\n\nTo defend against ballistic missiles, China’s S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems (like the U.S. Patriot missile system) have some capability as point defenses against shorter-range ballistic missiles as they approach their targets. (A point defense can protect a relatively small area, from a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers in diameter.) China is working to develop interceptors to defend against longer-range ballistic missiles, but those systems are still in development and have not yet been deployed. Thus, China’s ability to intercept very fast, high-flying missiles en route to their targets is likely to be limited for at least the near future.\n\nRussia\n\nAs evinced by its invasion of Ukraine, Russia may harbor aspirations to restore the territory of the former Soviet Union. That territory includes the three Baltic Sea nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). If Russia invaded a NATO country, the United States would have a treaty-based obligation to respond. Such a response would be harder if Russian forces were able to establish a strong ground presence in one of those NATO countries and could protect themselves with long-range air defenses and missile attacks.\n\nLike China, Russia has a variety of antiaccess and area-denial weapons that could pose challenges for the United States and its allies—particularly Russia’s long-range missiles and air defenses. For attacking targets on land, Russia can use ground-launched Iskander ballistic missiles, which have a range of 300 km, and ground-, ship-, and air-launched land-attack cruise missiles, which have ranges up to several thousand kilometers. In addition, Russia’s Kinzhal ballistic missiles, which have a range of 2,720 km when launched from fighter aircraft, can be used to strike targets on land or at sea and could limit naval access to the Baltic Sea. And Russia’s air defenses, such as the S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems also deployed by China, could limit access by NATO air forces to areas that would include much of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland (see Figure 2-2).\n\nFigure 2-2.\n\nApproximate Coverage Areas of Russia’s Potential A2/AD Defenses\n\nHowever, the Russian military’s failure to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in February 2022, which many analysts thought would be fairly easy for Russia, suggests some of the pitfalls of relying on technical assessments to measure military capability. Sensors, intelligence gathering, flexible command-and-control systems, and well-trained personnel are just as important. Thus, the risks to U.S. weapon systems in potential adversaries’ A2/AD zones may be overstated.\n\nOther Scenarios\n\nHypersonic weapons could prove to be useful in ways other than thwarting the A2/AD defenses of near-peer adversaries. Notable examples would be scenarios in which the United States wanted to conduct a rapid, long-distance strike because it had intelligence indicating the location of a high-value target, such as the leader of a terrorist organization or a nuclear-armed missile about to be launched by a rogue nation. Such intelligence would have to be acted on quickly because of potential movement of the target. Although there might not be U.S. forces nearby, a hypersonic missile could potentially hit the target from a long distance in a time frame that would not be possible with a slower-flying missile, such as a subsonic cruise missile. That type of mission is what initially revived DoD’s interest in hypersonic weapons in the early 2000s.\n\nChapter 3Comparing the Capabilities of Hypersonic Missiles and Potential Alternatives\n\nConsidering the scenarios described in Chapter 2, the Congressional Budget Office analyzed how well different types of weapons could conduct rapid strikes with conventional warheads in an antiaccess and area-denial environment. In such an environment, three characteristics that are particularly important for strike weapons are range, responsiveness, and survivability: To be effective, a strike weapon must be able to reach the target (range) in a timely fashion (responsiveness) with a reasonable probability of not being intercepted en route (survivability). A strike weapon’s range, responsiveness, and survivability for a given mission are a function not only of the weapon’s performance but also of the type of platform that launches it. The performance of the opponent’s weapons plays a role as well.\n\nCBO used the metrics of range, responsiveness, survivability, and overall effectiveness in an A2/AD environment to characterize the potential performance of the following general types of weapon systems:\n\nHypersonic boost-glide missiles;\n\nBallistic missiles with various ranges and trajectories;\n\nSubsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic cruise missiles; and\n\nLong-range bomber aircraft.\n\nUsing the results of that general performance comparison, CBO created five illustrative options with specific quantities of particular weapon systems and compared the potential costs and effectiveness of those options (see Chapter 4).\n\nThe performance characteristics of the hypersonic mis­siles that the Department of Defense is developing are not publicly available, so CBO conducted its analysis by modeling generic versions of each type of weapon system using information that has been made public. The technologies of the systems CBO analyzed exist in various states of maturity. But for the purposes of comparing performance, the systems were all assumed to be mature enough to deploy in the near future.\n\nCBO concluded that although the hypersonic missiles now in development would theoretically have the energy to glide farther than a ballistic missile with the same initial speed, heating of the missile body would probably limit the range at which those hypersonic missiles could operate. Consequently, the hypersonic boost-glide missiles and cruise missiles currently being developed would have to be located near or within an A2/AD zone to conduct rapid strikes.\n\nHypersonic boost-glide missiles and ballistic missiles are considerably faster than the other weapons that CBO examined, including hypersonic cruise missiles. CBO concluded that over short to intermediate ranges, hypersonic boost-glide missiles might be slightly faster than ballistic missiles of the same range that were flying on a minimum-energy trajectory (a flight path that maximizes the range of a ballistic missile). But hypersonic boost-glide missiles would be no faster than ballistic missiles flying on a lower, or depressed, trajectory (which would require a little more power to achieve the same maximum range as a ballistic missile flying on a mini­mum-energy trajectory).\n\nA purely ballistic missile with a conventional warhead would not be accurate enough for many targets, so the notional ballistic missile that CBO included in this comparison would be equipped with a maneuverable reentry vehicle capable of correcting its trajectory when it reentered the atmosphere. MaRVs would probably give ballistic missiles an accuracy similar to that envisioned for the hypersonic missiles DoD is developing (although those ballistic missiles would not be capable of flying the nonballistic trajectories used by hypersonic boost-glide missiles). Maneuverable reentry vehicles are a less challenging technology than hypersonic glide bodies; they have been studied since the 1960s and were deployed on the U.S. military’s intermediate-range Pershing II nucle­ar-armed missiles in the 1980s.\n\nIn terms of performance against defenses, CBO’s analysis found that subsonic cruise missiles are among the most difficult munitions to detect because they are small and fly close to the ground. But once detected and tracked, they are easier to intercept than missiles traveling at higher speeds. For all types of missiles, as speed increases from subsonic to hypersonic, the challenge of intercepting them increases.\n\nThe ability of hypersonic boost-glide missiles and ballistic missiles with MaRVs to avoid being detected and intercepted varies with the type of defense system—specifically, with the phase of a missile’s flight in which it is targeted by the defense system. (For a description of those phases, see Box 1-1.) A hypersonic boost-glide missile may be detected by infrared sensors during portions of its boost phase as well as in its glide phase, when its temperature increases. The missile can also be detected by ground-based radar during early parts of its trajectory, when it is relatively high in the atmosphere, and at later stages, when it is closer to the radar.\n\nTracking and intercepting a missile in the middle of its flight would be considerably harder with hypersonic boost-glide missiles than with ballistic missiles. But the inherent challenges of ballistic missile defense—coupled with the fact that no potential U.S. adversaries have yet deployed midcourse defense systems—suggest that the advantages offered by hypersonic missiles against such long-range defenses may not be important at this time. Moreover, modifying a ballistic missile’s trajectory (such as depressing its altitude) or using countermeasures (such as decoys to fool interceptor missiles) would make ballistic missiles difficult to counter even if potential adversaries deployed midcourse defenses.\n\nAgainst defenses that target missiles in the terminal phase of their flight, ballistic missiles with MaRVs and hypersonic boost-glide missiles would probably be similarly effective because both would be able to maneuver as they got close to their targets.\n\nRange\n\nThe threats that an A2/AD environment poses to missile launchers increase the importance of range for missile systems. Most of the missiles that the United States is deploying or developing for those purposes today have ranges of 5,500 kilometers (about 3,400 miles) or less, with the exception of long-range nuclear delivery systems, such as submarine-launched Trident missiles and ground-launched Minuteman III missiles (see Table 3-1). For any weapons with a range of less than 5,500 km, the ability to position launch platforms in proximity to a conflict but outside the range of an adversary’s defenses is important. The defenses that China, Russia, or a regional power might use to threaten U.S. weapons and their launchers could have ranges from 400 km to 4,000 km (about 250 miles to 2,500 miles), depending on the type of defense.\n\nTable 3-1.\n\nRanges of Various U.S. Weapon Systems\n\nIn a China scenario, for example, a U.S. missile with a range of 3,000 km (like the Army’s planned Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon) would be able to reach China’s populous and militarily important coastal regions if it was launched from the Pacific island of Guam. But in doing so, it would be within range of China’s medium-range bombers and ballistic missiles (see Figure 2-1). Whether those Chinese weapons could destroy the missile launcher would depend on how it was deployed (dispersed, camouflaged, or dug in), how well it was protected by air and missile defenses, and how quickly its missiles were launched at the start of a conflict. The fate of the launcher would also depend on the accuracy and effectiveness of China’s weapons, the number of long-range missiles in China’s inventory, and the ability of China’s intelligence and command-and-control systems to pinpoint the launcher’s location.\n\nA U.S. Navy ship carrying a weapon similar to the planned Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike missile might have to stay as far as 4,000 km away from China’s coast if China was able to track the ship and if its DF-21D or DF-26 antiship ballistic missiles proved effective at that range. In such a case, the IR-CPS missile might not be able to reach targets on China’s coast, although it could still attack air-defense systems and other fixed targets deployed on artificial islands that China has built in the South China Sea. The IR-CPS might also be used against Chinese surface ships if they were not moving. However, a submarine carrying that missile could use its stealth capabilities to get closer to China’s coast and strike targets there or perhaps farther inland. Subsonic cruise missiles like the Navy’s Tomahawk might also be effective in that scenario.\n\nThe hypersonic boost-glide missile that CBO modeled on the Air Force’s planned Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon has a much shorter range than the Army’s and Navy’s boost-glide missiles—about 1,000 km—which would require an aircraft carrying it to get much closer to China’s coast. China’s air-defense systems have much shorter ranges than its bombers and ballistic missiles, about 400 km. But Chinese fighter aircraft (like the SU-30MKK) armed with air-to-air missiles might be able to attack U.S. aircraft as far as 1,000 km from the coast. ARRW missiles launched from that distance could probably still reach coastal targets.\n\nIn a Russia scenario focused on the Baltic region, ground-based missile launchers could be located at multiple spots in nearby North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, but they might require some protection. Submarines would be less likely to play a role in that scenario than they would in the waters around China because the Baltic Sea is smaller and space would be constrained. Aircraft, particularly ones with stealth characteristics, might be able to approach Russia’s borders and launch missiles at inland targets.\n\nIn the face of A2/AD challenges from such potential adversaries, the United States could use a phased approach to destroying A2/AD systems. For example, if ships, submarines, and bombers were not yet in position, ground-based weapons that had already been deployed to a region could be fired the most quickly. The locations where such weapons could be deployed are limited in the Pacific region but are more numerous in the Baltic region. At present, U.S. allies in the Pacific have not agreed to allow the United States to base its planned hypersonic missiles in close proximity to China, leaving Guam as the most likely launch location. In Europe, by contrast, most if not all NATO countries might serve as launching points for U.S. missiles. Even with a range limited to 3,000 km, a missile like the Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon might be able to degrade enough of the air and missile defenses in a small area early in a conflict to allow U.S. aircraft to operate in that area. In turn, those aircraft could use air-launched hypersonic missiles to eliminate additional A2/AD sites, further opening the area to U.S shorter-range forces.\n\nIntermediate-range ballistic missiles equipped with maneuverable reentry vehicles would have the same, if not longer, range than the hypersonic boost-glide weapons that CBO modeled. The reason is that a MaRV is likely to be lighter than a hypersonic glide body. An air-launched ballistic missile with a MaRV could be boosted by a single-stage rocket, similar to that of the hypersonic ARRW. With a lighter payload, such a missile’s range could exceed that of the ARRW. Alternatively, the payload capacity of a MaRV-equipped ballistic missile could be increased, making its range similar to the ARRW’s.\n\nOther weapons that CBO included in its comparison, such as subsonic cruise missiles (like the Navy’s Tomahawk), have ranges longer than the air-launched hypersonic boost-glide missile (ARRW) but shorter than the ground- or sea-launched hypersonic boost-glide missiles (LRHW/IR-CPS). However, because those other weapons would be slower, their flight times would be much longer than the flight times of hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe U.S. military’s interest in relatively long range weapons is driven by an assumption that the defensive systems in Chinese and Russian A2/AD areas would be effective. Those defensive systems require sophisticated intelligence collection and broad surveillance, which is almost certainly not constant or complete. Without detailed information about the tracking and targeting capabilities of Chinese and Russian air-defense and antiship systems, the severity of those A2/AD threats cannot be definitively determined.\n\nResponsiveness\n\nOne of the main reasons that DoD is developing hypersonic missiles is that they can reach their targets very quickly from relatively long distances—a capability that is lacking in the current U.S. arsenal of longer-range conventional weapons. Quick response times also require that missiles’ launchers already be located within range of their targets.\n\nThe U.S. arsenal currently lacks medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles primarily because the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union prohibited either country from developing or possessing ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 km and 5,500 km. The treaty did not limit air- or sea-launched missiles of those ranges, but the United States did not develop such ballistic missiles, presumably because they were considered too inaccurate and expensive to function as conventional weapons and were not considered necessary for nuclear deterrence.\n\nOne reason that DoD initially became interested in developing hypersonic boost-glide missiles is that their flight path (which involves spending less than half their flight in a ballistic trajectory) would make them compliant with the terms of the INF treaty. However, the United States withdrew from the treaty in 2019, citing Russian violations. That withdrawal widens the range of possible solutions to the problem of Russia’s and China’s efforts to develop longer-range weapons that increase the distance at which U.S. forces might have to operate. The U.S. military has chosen to continue to focus on developing hypersonic weapons to meet its desire for fast medium- and intermediate-range missiles, rather than focusing on simpler alternatives, such as ballistic missiles with maneuverable reentry vehicles.\n\nEstimating Average Speeds of Missiles\n\nTo measure the responsiveness of hypersonic missiles and other weapon systems, CBO estimated their flight times, taking into account such factors as range, initial speed, propulsion, trajectory, and loss of speed during flight because of drag. Different types of missiles have very different flight profiles, which can make comparing flight times difficult. For example, a cruise missile flies at a constant speed throughout most of its trajectory; a hypersonic boost-glide missile accelerates rapidly to a high speed and then slows down steadily as it glides along its trajectory; and a ballistic missile accelerates rapidly, slows for the first half of its trajectory, and then accelerates again for the second half of its trajectory.\n\nTo facilitate comparison, CBO calculated a missile’s average speed for each range, defined as the distance along the Earth’s surface between the launcher and the target divided by the missile’s time in flight (see Table 3-2). Although most of the missiles in CBO’s comparison have ranges of 3,000 km or less, CBO analyzed weapons with ranges between 500 km and 10,000 km (about 300 miles to 6,200 miles) for completeness.\n\nTable 3-2.\n\nAverage Speeds of Selected Weapons at Different Ranges\n\nMach Number\n\nIn its current development programs, DoD is designing hypersonic boost-glide missiles with likely ranges between 1,000 km and 3,000 km (about 600 miles to 1,900 miles). To estimate the flight time of such missiles, CBO created a model of a boost-glide trajectory that was based on an evaluation of publicly available data from an earlier flight test and potential improvements that DoD says it has made since then, allowing the missiles to glide faster and longer inside the atmosphere without damage from heating. The actual performance of those missiles is probably somewhere between the previously demonstrated performance and the assumed improvements that CBO included in its model. (For more details about CBO’s modeling of missiles, see Appendix B.)\n\nFor ballistic missiles, the longest flight time to a given target is the one associated with flying a minimum-energy trajectory (the path that allows the missile to have the longest possible range). The flight time of a ballistic missile can be shortened by altering the trajectory to a lower, but still arcing, path known as a depressed trajectory. The differences in flight times between a minimum-energy trajectory and a depressed trajectory become more pronounced over longer ranges (see Figure 3-1). CBO estimates that for ballistic missiles traveling 1,000 km to 3,000 km, depressed trajectories reduce flight times by 10 percent to 30 percent compared with minimum-energy trajectories.\n\nFigure 3-1.\n\nSpans of Flight Times for Hypersonic and Other Weapon Systems\n\nMinutes\n\nA ballistic missile on a depressed trajectory generally spends more time in the atmosphere than a ballistic missile on a minimum-energy trajectory. As a result, it may also face greater thermal challenges, which can limit either its speed or its maximum range. However, a ballistic missile experiences those challenges for a much smaller portion of its flight than a hypersonic boost-glide missile of the same range.\n\nCruise missiles fly at low altitudes at roughly constant speeds. For its analysis, CBO used generic definitions of speed to group weapons into subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic categories. On the basis of publicly available information, CBO limited the speed of the hypersonic cruise missiles currently under development to Mach 9.\n\nIn its comparison, CBO also considered long-range, subsonic stealth bombers, such as the current B-2 or the planned B-21, which could penetrate an adversary’s A2/AD zone to deliver short-range guided weapons, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition. To model that type of mission, CBO assumed the aircraft would fly at speeds between Mach 0.7 and Mach 0.85 and have a maximum range of 10,000 km.\n\nThe flight times that CBO calculated for a given distance between launcher and target would be increased if a missile or aircraft did not fly a direct route to its target. That increase could be significant for boost-glide and cruise missiles. Boost-glide missiles would suffer an additional speed penalty because they are unpowered, so they would lose energy during the maneuvers necessary to fly an indirect route to the target.\n\nResponsiveness of Hypersonic Boost-Glide Missiles and Ballistic Missiles\n\nActual flight speeds for hypersonic missiles depend on many design considerations, such as their initial acceleration, aerodynamic shape (which affects drag), limits on maximum speed because of heating, and requirements for a maximum terminal speed (the speed at which the glide body approaches its target). CBO’s estimates of response times take into account a range of potential design choices and improvements to drag conditions, but they do not account for any reductions in speed caused by maneuvering, which would increase flight times for hypersonic missiles. (For more information about how CBO estimated the upper and lower bounds on average speed for each type of missile, see Appendix B.)\n\nShort Range. At ranges of less than about 1,000 km, there is significant overlap in the span of flight times for boost-glide and ballistic missiles, CBO estimates (see Figure 3-1, bottom panel). The hypersonic boost-glide missiles currently being developed by the United States are likely to have longer response times than ballistic missiles flying depressed trajectories. But if the United States can develop technologies that allow glide bodies to move faster without burning up, future boost-glide missiles have the potential to achieve roughly the same response times at short ranges as ballistic missiles flying depressed trajectories and slightly shorter response times than ballistic missiles flying minimum-energy trajectories (METs). How significant that small time advantage would be in combat is not clear.\n\nIntermediate Range. At ranges greater than 1,000 km, hypersonic boost-glide missiles are likely to take longer to reach their targets—even under optimistic performance assumptions—than ballistic missiles on depressed trajectories. Boost-glide missiles may still take less time than MET missiles at ranges of less than about 5,000 km, but that advantage dissipates with range.\n\nLong Range. Beyond 5,000 km, the shortest estimated response times of hypersonic boost-glide missiles exceed those of MET missiles. At those longer ranges, the time advantage that hypersonic boost-glide missiles gain by traveling a shorter path because of their low-­altitude trajectory is offset by the reduction in speed that they experience because of drag as they fly through the atmosphere.\n\nIn addition, as range increases, estimates of the time difference between hypersonic boost-glide and ballistic missiles become increasingly sensitive to the hypersonic missiles’ design parameters and initial speeds.\n\nResponsiveness of Hypersonic Cruise Missiles\n\nHypersonic cruise missiles, which are powered by supersonic combustion ramjets, are likely to operate at speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 9. Because of their low, flat trajectory, hypersonic cruise missiles flying at those speeds would take less time to reach their targets than either boost-glide or ballistic missiles at very short ranges. Cruise missiles can end their flight at roughly any location between launch and their maximum range. By contrast, ballistic and boost-glide missiles designed for a certain range have a minimum distance they must fly as well as a maximum range.\n\nCBO used a simple model of the flight time of cruise missiles, which does not take into account trade-offs between the burnout speed of the booster that provides initial acceleration and the ability of the scramjet to continue that acceleration (rather than just maintain the speed achieved by the booster). Using average speeds that do not depend on those design choices, CBO concluded that hypersonic cruise missiles would lose their time advantage over ballistic missiles between ranges of 700 km and 800 km.\n\nAlthough scramjet technology has been demonstrated in both ground tests and flight tests, it would still require significant development to be able to be integrated into a useful weapon. DoD has stated that scramjet technology will allow for smaller, lighter cruise missiles that can be loaded on short-range tactical aircraft. Keeping the missiles’ mass small enough, however, would require making concessions on both speed and range. Given those challenges, CBO limited the range for first-generation hypersonic cruise missiles in its analysis to about 500 km. The size of those missiles would limit the types of aircraft that could carry them and the number of missiles that would fit on an aircraft.\n\nResponsiveness of Subsonic and Supersonic Cruise Missiles and Subsonic Bombers\n\nSubsonic cruise missiles, such as the Navy’s Tomahawk, are considerably slower than hypersonic missiles and ballistic missiles of the same range, flying at an average speed of Mach 0.7, CBO estimates. CBO compared subsonic cruise missiles with speeds up to Mach 1 over the ranges available with existing weapons—up to about 2,000 km—and found that their flight times would be 9 to 11 times as long, on average, as those of hypersonic boost-glide missiles and ballistic missiles of the same range (see Figure 3-1, top panel).\n\nSupersonic cruise missiles would have flight times between those of subsonic and hypersonic cruise missiles. DoD does not currently field such weapons, nor is it developing them. But CBO included hypothetical supersonic cruise missiles in its analysis for comparison.\n\nAn Air Force B-2 bomber can fly at a maximum speed of Mach 0.95, offering similar response times but longer ranges than a subsonic cruise missile. The bomber’s flight path, however, can increase or decrease the total response time for a strike, depending on the bomber’s initial location and on whether it or its missile has to take a more circuitous path than the cruise missile to avoid defenses.\n\nImportance of Positioning\n\nThe time needed to prepare a missile for launch includes positioning the launcher (whether it is located on land, at sea, or on an aircraft) so its weapons will be within range of the target. In a scenario in which the United States did not have time to move ships, submarines, and aircraft into position, ground-based launchers kept in the region would probably be able to launch missiles the most quickly and therefore be the most responsive. In scenarios in which the United States had more time to build up its forces in the region, it might be able to launch missiles from other platforms relatively quickly if they were in position.\n\nSurvivability\n\nFor a missile to be effective at destroying its target, its launcher must survive any attacks before launching the missile. And once launched, the missile must survive any attempts by air defenses or missile defenses to intercept it before it reaches its target.\n\nSurvivability of Launchers\n\nThe easiest way for a launcher to survive is to remain out of range of weapon systems that can attack it. Those systems include land-attack cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and bombers for attacking ground-based launchers; antiship cruise and ballistic missiles and antisubmarine forces for attacking sea-based launchers; and air defenses and fighter aircraft for attacking airborne launchers. The need to avoid such weapon systems puts a premium on longer ranges for U.S. missiles.\n\nLaunchers that must operate within an antiaccess and area-denial zone can use several strategies to increase their chances of survival:\n\nThey can operate near the outer edges of the A2/AD zone, which boosts survival because adversaries typically have fewer weapon systems with long ranges and fewer sensors that can detect launches at those ranges. In general, the risk of attack tends to rise the closer a launch platform is to the adversary’s territory.\n\nThey can move so they are harder to track and hit.\n\nThey can use stealth characteristics (as submarines and stealth bombers do) or camouflage (as ground-based launchers hidden among trees do) to avoid being detected. That ability means submarines are more likely to survive than surface ships, and stealth aircraft are more likely to survive than their nonstealth counterparts.\n\nThey can be protected by active defenses, such as missile and air defenses.\n\nThere are limits to how long a launcher of shorter-range missiles can use those strategies to survive within an A2/AD zone. For example, stealth aircraft become more vulnerable if they must loiter in range of air defenses. The same is true for ships moving at sea. But if those aircraft or ships must remain outside the A2/AD zone for protection until the last possible moment, the promptness of their missile strikes will be delayed by the extra time it takes them to get into position (within the range of the missiles they carry).\n\nSurvivability of Missiles\n\nOnce launched, strike missiles must survive any defenses that adversaries have deployed before they can hit their targets. One of the most advertised features of hypersonic missiles is their ability to penetrate defenses. The trajectories flown by hypersonic boost-glide and cruise missiles have inherent advantages for survival, but they also have unique vulnerabilities.\n\nIn general, strike missiles are difficult to defend against. Some (such as subsonic cruise missiles) fly low, staying below the horizon for much of their flight so they cannot be detected by radar until they are close to their targets. Others (such as ballistic missiles and supersonic cruise missiles) use speed to reduce the effectiveness of defenses. Some missiles can also maneuver to make it harder for a defender to target or intercept them, and some can use countermeasures to help them penetrate defenses. For example, ballistic missiles can deploy decoys outside the atmosphere to make it more difficult for a defender to find and track the real warheads.\n\nHypersonic missiles are designed to use speed, altitude, and maneuvering to penetrate defenses. They fly almost as fast as ballistic missiles, but at lower altitudes. They also have the potential to maneuver midflight, either in altitude or in direction. Those features make it harder for them to be detected, tracked, and intercepted by air defenses (because they are too high to reach and too fast to catch) or by missile defenses (because they are too low to detect until late, too low for many midcourse interceptors to hit, and in many cases too maneuverable to track and intercept effectively with current interceptors). China and Russia are developing hypersonic weapons for just those reasons. They see advantages in having short- and medium-range missiles that could penetrate the missile defenses that protect U.S forces (particularly ships) in a theater of operations, as well as advantages in having long-range missiles that could penetrate the missile defenses that provide some protection for U.S. territory.\n\nAt the same time, the extreme heat that hypersonic missiles generate in the atmosphere makes them likely to be detectable by infrared sensors; the United States is developing space-based infrared sensors for that purpose. In addition, the trajectory of hypersonic boost-glide missiles near the end of flight is similar enough to that of aircraft that they may be vulnerable to air defenses. The effectiveness of air defenses would depend on the relative speeds and maneuverability of the interceptor and of the hypersonic missile near the end of its flight, when it had slowed considerably.\n\nBenefits of Flying at Lower Altitudes. To illustrate the effects of geometry on the ability of a radar to detect a missile, CBO calculated the radar horizon distance, or the distance at which an object at a given height can be physically seen by a radar. Because the Earth is spherical, a radar cannot see objects that are below the horizon. Thus, a missile will remain out of view of a radar as long as it is below the radar’s horizon (see Figure 3-2). Missiles can be detected earlier in their flight if the radar’s altitude is increased—say, by giving the radar a taller antenna or putting it on an aircraft.\n\nFigure 3-2.\n\nEffects of Altitude on a Radar’s Ability to Detect a Missile\n\nThe first opportunity to detect a ballistic or hypersonic missile is during the boost phase, when its rocket motors emit a great deal of heat (infrared energy). Boost-phase detection systems are usually based in space, where factors such as the horizon are less relevant. The United States and the Soviet Union both initially deployed space-based infrared systems during the Cold War to detect long-range ball"
