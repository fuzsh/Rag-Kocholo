        "text": "First Nations\n\nSilver Covenant Chain Treaty\n\nThis wampum treaty between Britain and the Haudenosaunee represented an open and honest communication between two peoples. Subsequent wampum treaties reinforce this idea, as well as the idea of mutual interest and peace. Such wampum treaties oblige the parties to help each other, in war if necessary, should they be asked.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nTreaty of Paris 1783\n\nThis treaty ended the American Revolution, recognizing the independence of the American colonies. The boundary between British and American territories was set along the St. Lawrence River and through the Great Lakes. Post-war life in the United States was very difficult for British Loyalists, who endured property loss and discrimination. Many left and began to arrive in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec and Ontario. Famous migrant Loyalists include Lieutenant James Moody, Laura Secord and Richard Pierpoint.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nSimcoe Encourages Immigration\n\nJohn Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, issued a land grant proclamation that encouraged American immigration to Upper Canada. By the War of 1812, more than half of the population of the colony would be American born.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nBattle of Fallen Timbers\n\nAn American force under General Anthony Wayne defeated a force of Shawnee, Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomi warriors and some Canadian militia in the Ohio region. After the battle American forces destroyed the First Nations’ fields and villages.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nThe Treaty of Greenville\n\nA treaty between the United States and the Shawnee, Delaware, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Wyandot, Miami, Chippewa, Kickapoo, Wea, Piankashaw and Kaskaskia following the Battle of Fallen Timbers that forced them to cede most of Ohio.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nUS Sloop Boarded by British\n\nThe Royal Navy boarded the sloop USS Baltimore and impressed 55 of her crew. Fifty were subsequently freed, but there was much outrage at this violation of American sovereignty.\n\nFirst Nations People\n\nJohn Norton (Teyoninhokarawen) appointed diplomat and war chief\n\nThe son of a Cherokee father and Scottish mother, Norton came to Canada as a soldier and eventually began living at Onondaga on the Grand River. He was adopted by the Mohawk nation, and in the War of 1812 recruited hundreds of Six Nations and Delaware warriors to help defend the Niagara Frontier from American invasion.\n\nFirst Nations People\n\nJohn Brant (Dekarihokenh, Ahyonwaeghs, Ahyouwaeghs) moves to Grand River\n\nAfter the death of his father, Joseph Brant, John Brant moved to the Grand River reservation with his mother. Brant became a Six Nations war chief and, along with John Norton, recruited warriors for service in the Niagara Region during the War of 1812.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe Chesapeake-Leopard Affair\n\nBritish frigate HMS Leopard attacked USS Chesapeake looking for British-born sailors. British crew boarded the American ship and forced one sailor into service with the Royal Navy. The incident brought American outrage against forced service in the British navy to a peak and became a major factor in the declaration of war.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nBritish Trade Restrictions\n\nTo increase the economic pressure on France, the British government issued orders-in-council forbidding foreign vessels from trading with European ports unless they first called at a British port or were inspected on the high seas.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nCongress Restores Trade\n\nCongress restored trade with Britain and France through Macon’s Bill No. 2 but promised to stop trading with the enemy of the first power to remove its restrictions against neutral shipping.\n\nPeople\n\nMajor-General Brock Appointed\n\nOn this day Major-General Sir Isaac Brock took the oaths of office as president and administrator of Upper Canada. He was also commander of its armed forces. Brock went on to defend against American attacks, and enlisted the support of Tecumseh’s Western Confederacy and other Aboriginal allies.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe 12th US Congress Opens\n\nIt became known as the War Congress. New members from southern and western districts such as Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina pushed for war to defend America’s honour and were dubbed “War Hawks.”\n\nHistorical Context\n\nGlengarry Light Infantry Formed\n\nBritish Commander-in-Chief Sir George Prevost ordered the recruitment of a regiment of fencible infantry from the eastern districts of Upper Canada. The resulting unit, the Glengarry Light Infantry, saw much action across the province during the war.\n\nPeople\n\nSalaberry Appointed\n\nCharles-Michel de Salaberry was appointed head of a corps of Voltigeurs. Born in Beauport, Québec, Salaberry was an officer in the British army who set up a militia corps made up primarily of French Canadians that was known as the Canadian Voltigeurs.\n\nWestern Region\n\nGeneral William Hull's American army invades Upper Canada\n\nWith thousands of American troops under his command, American General William Hull invaded Upper Canada at Sandwich (present-day Windsor), proclaiming his invasion as liberating the Canadians. However, his army quickly turned the inhabitants against it by looting farms and burning homes.\n\nWestern Region\n\nFrançois Bâby House\n\nInvading American forces under William Hull took over the large, elegant house of François Bâby, a prominent French Canadian leader in southwestern Upper Canada, and used it as a base. They later retreated, and the house was then used as a headquarters by the British and Canadians.\n\nWestern Region\n\nSkirmish at the River Canard, Upper Canada\n\nAdvanced units of Hull’s invading army attacked a British picket, which fell back to Amherstburg. Two British soldiers were accidentally left behind, and they defended their position until they were captured. One of them, Private Hancock, died of his injuries that evening, becoming the war’s first British casualty.\n\nWestern Region\n\nFort Michilimackinac Captured\n\nFort Mackinac, located on Mackinac Island in the straits between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, was captured by a force of 400 Sioux, Menominee, Winnebago, Odawa and Ojibwe warriors, 200 fur traders and some 50 British regulars. The victory underlined the need for Britain to ally with Aboriginal nations.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nBattle of Brownstown, Michigan\n\nTecumseh led an attack on a force from General William Hull's army at Detroit sent to meet a supply column from Ohio. Hull's troops were repulsed and returned to Detroit without the supplies, and dispatches from Hull showing his tenuous position at Detroit were captured.\n\nAtlantic and Gulf Coasts\n\nHMS Guerrière Sinks\n\nThe USS Constitution sank the HMS Guerrière. This Atlantic naval victory was a morale boost to the American public and Congress. This was one of 26 naval actions on the high seas during the War of 1812, half of which were American victories.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nRunchey's Corps is Formed, Upper Canada\n\nIn October 1812, Captain Robert Runchey (a white Niagara tavern owner) was put in charge of a small corps of free coloured men raised for defence on the Niagara Frontier. Sometimes called the Coloured or Black Corps, it totalled about 50 men and saw service throughout the war, including participation at the Battle of Queenston Heights.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBattle of Queenston Heights\n\nAmericans crossed the Niagara River and attacked the high ground of Queenston Heights. His sword drawn, Major-General Brock led troops into battle and was fatally wounded. The battle essentially lost, Grand River Mohawk warriors led by John Norton (Teyoninhokarawen) prevented American forces from retreating for several hours until reinforcements led by Major-General Roger Sheaffe arrived and forced over 1,000 American soldiers to surrender.\n\nWestern Region\n\nSecond Battle of Frenchtown\n\nAfter capturing Frenchtown (now Monroe, Michigan) a week earlier, American forces came under attack from Western Confederacy and British forces. The American defenders were quickly overwhelmed by cannon and musket fire. After the fighting ended, the battle turned into a massacre when more than 30 American prisoners were killed.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nWinter march of the 104th Regiment of Foot\n\nGovernor-in-Chief Sir George Prevost ordered the transfer of soldiers from the Atlantic region to the Canadas to help protect them from impending US attacks. Soldiers from New Brunswick began their snow-shoed march from Fredericton to Québec City, eventually reaching Kingston, Ontario. Some died of frostbite on the nearly six week journey.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nInvasion and burning of York\n\nAmerican forces led by Brigadier-General Zebulon Pike launched a seaborne invasion of York (Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada. The Americans captured, sacked and burned the city. The local militia committed acts of sabotage. They set alight the grand magazine (gunpowder storage) at Fort York, killing or wounding over 240 American occupiers. The partially-built sloop HMS Sir Isaac Brock was burned to prevent it from being used by the Americans.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBritish Abandon Fort George\n\nIn the face of a larger American invasion force Brigadier-General John Vincent ordered that the smouldering Fort George be abandoned. The move exposed the entire British line on the Niagara Frontier, which Vincent ordered abandoned from Queenston Heights south to Fort Erie.\n\nWar on the Great Lakes\n\nRaid on Sackets Harbor\n\nA combined British naval and army force attacked Sackets Harbor to destroy the American shipyard and a frigate on the stocks (later named General Pike). The attack had mixed results and failed to destroy the shipyard and frigate.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBattle of Stoney Creek\n\nBritish forces launched a surprise night attack on the American camp at Stoney Creek. The British had learned the sentries’ password, and after a night of close and confused fighting British forces declared victory. The battle led the American invasion force to retreat to Fort George.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nUS Forces Abandon Fort Erie\n\nAfter the loss at Stoney Creek the American presence in Upper Canada was less secure and Fort Erie, which had been held for a period by US forces, was abandoned and later re-occupied by the British.\n\nFirst Nations Niagara Region\n\nBattle of Beaver Dams\n\nA force of 400 Caughnawaga and Mohawk warriors from both Upper and Lower Canada, with British regulars in support, forced the surrender of nearly 500 advancing American soldiers at what is now Thorold, Ontario. The battle was the largest Indigenous victory without significant non-Indigenous involvement.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBattle of Butler's Farm\n\nA group of some 40 American infantry tried to outflank First Nations forces made up of Iroquois, Mississauga and Ottawa warriors in the vicinity of Butler's Farm. The warriors cut them off, and after a sharp action 20 Americans lay dead, while the balance surrendered.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nSkirmish at Corus's Farm\n\nA small British force, protected by Six Nations, Ottawa and Mississauga warriors, went to Casper Corus’s farm to retrieve a cache of medicines buried by Corus following the capture of Fort George in May. They were chased away by a large force of American dragoons and infantry.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nFirst Muster of Canadian Volunteers\n\nA military unit of Canadian renegades joined the American cause at Fort George. Commander Joseph Willcocks, a sitting member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, began a reign of terror in the Niagara Region lasting until December. Many inhabitants loyal to Britain, including those who had given their paroles not to fight, were taken as hostages and imprisoned in the United States.\n\nAtlantic and Gulf Coasts\n\nHMS Boxer vs. USS Enterprise\n\nA naval battle between HMS Boxer and USS Enterprise off the Maine coast ended with Boxer's surrender. The ship was towed into Portland, Maine. There the commanders of both ships, both of whom had been killed in the battle, were buried with full honours.\n\nWestern Region\n\nAmherstburg Abandoned\n\nAmherstburg was abandoned and burned by the British because of approaching American forces. British Major-General Henry Procter and his force began a withdrawal along the Thames River toward Moraviantown, accompanied by Tecumseh and his warriors.\n\nFirst Nations Western Region\n\nBattle of the Thames (Moraviantown)\n\nMajor-General Procter decided to turn and face the pursuing American forces under William Henry Harrison at Moraviantown. The British forces surrendered after a brief fight, while Tecumseh’s warriors offered stiff resistance. Tecumseh was killed in the battle, and the remaining British and Aboriginal forces retreated.\n\nFirst Nations People\n\nDeath of Tecumseh\n\nThe Shawnee leader Tecumseh was killed in the Battle of the Thames. He and his brother Tenskwatawa had formed a confederacy in 1805 to oppose American expansion in present-day Michigan and Indiana. Tecumseh’s death effectively destroyed the Western Confederacy and any hope of an independent Aboriginal nation in the Old Northwest.\n\nPeople\n\nJohn Richardson is Captured\n\nJohn Richardson, a Canadian serving in the British Army, was captured at the Battle of the Thames (also known as the Battle of Moraviantown). Richardson would later gain modest fame as the first Canadian novelist.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nBattle of Châteauguay\n\nThe United States launched its largest offensive of the war, attempting to capture Montréal. Some of the invading US troops were sent down the St. Lawrence River, while others crossed from New York State into Lower Canada. At the Battle of Châteauguay (near Ormstown, Québec), an American land force of approximately 3,000 was defeated by nearly 2,000 French-Canadian Voltigeurs, fencibles and Mohawk warriors from Kahnawake, all led by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles-Michel de Salaberry.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nBattle of Crysler's Farm\n\nAmerican forces on the St. Lawrence River were halted when British and militia units defeated them at the Battle of Crysler's Farm near Cornwall, Ontario. After defeats at Châteauguay and Crysler's Farm, the Americans abandoned the St. Lawrence campaign, guaranteeing British control of the important river.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBritish Capture Fort Niagara\n\nIn a night assault, boats were brought 68 miles overland from Burlington Heights with a force of 500 British regulars and warriors from the Six Nations, Mohawks of St. Regis, and Caughnawaga. The troops were instructed to be as silent as possible and to only use their bayonets. The fort was captured without a shot being fired.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nSecond Battle of Lacolle Mills\n\nThe small garrison of a British outpost guarding the crossing of the Lacolle River, aided by reinforcements, fought off a strong but badly executed American attack by General Wilkinson and some 4,000 men.\n\nAtlantic and Gulf Coasts\n\nUSS Frolic Surrenders\n\nThe American sloop USS Frolic, out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, fell in with the British frigate HMS Orpheus and schooner HMS Shelburne in the Florida Straits, surrendering after being fired upon by Orpheus.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nThe Ancaster Bloody Assize\n\nA series of trials were conducted in which 19 men were accused of supporting the American cause. They were charged with high treason. Fifteen men were found guilty, and eight executed by hanging at Burlington Heights on 20 July 1814.\n\nFirst Nations Niagara Region\n\nBattle of Chippawa\n\nFor the first time in the war, American forces defeated a similarly sized British contingent. In addition, Mohawk warriors allied with the British were forced to face fellow Six Nations warriors in battle, as Seneca warriors from New York were allied with American forces. The battle set the stage for the Battle of Lundy's Lane.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nSecond Treaty of Greenville\n\nA peace treaty was signed between the US and the Wyandot, Delaware, Seneca, Shawanee, Miami and Potawatomi residing within Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBattle of Lundy's Lane\n\nIn one of the bloodiest battles fought on Canadian soil during the war, British troops, fencibles, militia and Grand River warriors (led by John Norton) clashed with Americans near Niagara Falls. There were nearly 900 casualties on each side. The battle ended American advances into Upper Canada as they retreated to Fort Erie.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nSiege of Fort Erie Begins\n\nThe siege of Fort Erie was a British blockade of their own fort, located at the entrance to the Niagara River opposite Buffalo, New York, which the Americans had captured on 3 July 1814.\n\nWar on the Great Lakes\n\nCapture of the USS Ohio and USS Somers\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, a British assault party led by Alexander Dobbs captured two American ships, the USS Ohio and USS Somers, anchored in the Niagara River near Fort Erie.\n\nPeople\n\nMcKitrick of PEI Killed\n\nSergeant Joseph McKitrick of Prince Edward Island was killed in action with the Glengarry Light Infantry at Fort Erie, Upper Canada. He is believed to be the only Islander killed in the war.\n\nWar on the Great Lakes\n\nHMS Nancy Sinks\n\nThe HMS Nancy was sunk during an attack by a US squadron at the Nottawasaga River, Upper Canada.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nAssault on Fort Erie\n\nAfter two days of bombardment British troops and First Nations allies, including Six Nations warriors, under Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond attacked the fort in three prongs. British forces were able to fight their way into the fort but a gunpowder magazine exploded, killing many of the attackers and forcing the others to retreat.\n\nAtlantic and Gulf Coasts\n\nSacking of Washington\n\nSome 4,500 British soldiers landed at Benedict, Maryland and advanced on the American capital. British soldiers quickly overwhelmed the American defenders guarding Washington. The British proceeded to sack government buildings, setting fire to the US Capitol and White House. Americans destroyed the Washington Navy Yard to prevent ships and stores from falling into British hands.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nBritish Army Invades New York State\n\nA British invasion force numbering over 10,000 men under the command of Sir George Prevost crossed the border into the United States and moved towards Plattsburgh.\n\nAtlantic and Gulf Coasts\n\nBritish Occupy Castine, Maine\n\nThe British occupied the town of Castine and held it until nearly the end of April 1815, more than four months after the peace treaty.\n\nWar on the Great Lakes\n\nCapture of the USS Tigress and USS Scorpion\n\nA British and Canadian force of seamen, soldiers and Aboriginal allies under Lieutenants Miller Worsley, R.N., and Andrew Bulger captured the USS Tigress and two days later captured the USS Scorpion after fierce hand-to-hand fighting.\n\nPeople\n\nRobert Ross is killed\n\nBritish commander Robert Ross, who defeated the American army defending Washington and burned the city, was killed in the attack on Baltimore on 12 September 1814. His body was taken to Halifax and buried at the Old Burying Ground cemetery.\n\nSt. Lawrence Region\n\nBattle of Plattsburgh\n\nAfter receiving reinforcements from Britain, Governor-in-Chief Prevost launched a combined land and naval operation against American forces stationed at Sackets Harbor, New York. British ships met American forces near Plattsburgh, New York. After the British ships are defeated, their land forces were ordered to withdraw. It was the last major British operation of the war.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nBattle of Cook's Mills\n\nAfter the unsuccessful siege of Fort Erie the British retreated to Chippawa. US regular forces pushed north along Chippawa Creek and destroyed grain at nearby Cook’s Mills. A British column confronted the American force, and both sides withdrew after several hours of indecisive skirmishing. The action was likely the last battle on the Niagara Peninsula during the war.\n\nWestern Region\n\nDuncan McArthur’s Raid into Southwest Upper Canada\n\nIn the fall of 1814, American Brigadier-General Duncan McArthur led a brutal military operation to punish the people of Upper Canada. He raided Upper Canada with a large mounted army, burning homes, pillaging farms, and stealing large numbers of horses and livestock. The Canadian militia and Six Nations warriors fought McArthur and his raiders at Malcolm's Mills and other locations.\n\nNiagara Region\n\nUS Forces Blow Up Fort Erie\n\nWhen the Americans evacuated the Niagara area they blew up Fort Erie. It remained in ruins until its restoration by the Niagara Parks Commission in the 1930s.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nTreaty of Ghent\n\nPeace talks between Great Britain and the United States took place in Belgium in August and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on Christmas Eve.
