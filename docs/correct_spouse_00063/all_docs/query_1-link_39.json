        "text": "_\n\nMissing the residents of Forks, Washington? To mark the 10-year anniversary of the release of \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2\" on Nov. 16, 2022, Wonderwall.com is checking in on the \"Twilight Saga\" cast's real-life love lives. Keep reading to see who's married, who's engaged and who's still single…\n\nKeep reading for more…\n\nRELATED: All the actors who've portrayed Bruce Wayne and Batman over the years\n\n_\n\nKristen Stewart brought the character of Bella Swan to the big screen in all five \"Twilight\" films, with audiences avidly following her vampire-human romance with Edward Cullen. These days, the Oscar-nominated actress has settled down with one special lady.\n\nRELATED: All the stars who've played Princess Diana\n\n_\n\nKristen Stewart has been dating screenwriter Dylan Meyer since 2019, though the couple originally met on a film set in 2013. In a November 2021 interview with radio host Howard Stern, Kristen revealed that she and Dylan were engaged. She previously dated co-star Robert Pattinson, music star St. Vincent and model Stella Maxwell.\n\nRELATED: Stars who've been engaged or married 5 times or more\n\n_\n\nRobert Pattinson embodied hunky, tortured and devoted Edward Cullen, bringing the iconic character to life beginning in 2008. Off screen, like Edward, he's currently a one-woman man…\n\n_\n\nRobert Pattinson has been happily dating model-actress Suki Waterhouse since 2018. The couple have kept their relationship relatively private, a decision he explained in the Sunday Times in 2019. \"If you let people in, it devalues what love is,\" he said. \"If a stranger on the street asked you about your relationship, you'd think it extremely rude. If you put up a wall it ends up better. I can't understand how someone can walk down the street holding hands, and it's the same as when I do it and a hundred people are taking your photo. The line between when you're performing and when you're not will eventually get washed away and you'll go completely mad.\" He famously had a very public — and rocky — romance with \"Twilight\" co-star Kristen Stewart and was engaged to musician FKA twigs, from whom he split in 2017.\n\n_\n\nTaylor Lautner stole hearts and amassed his own team of fans as Jacob Black in the \"Twilight\" flicks. His romantic fate in the films was pretty controversial — he ended up imprinting (a werewolf term for falling in love) on Bella Swan and Edward Cullen's daughter, Renesmee — but his real-life love life is a bit more straightforward.\n\n_\n\nTaylor Lautner is married! He proposed to girlfriend Taylor Dome, a registered nurse, on Nov. 11, 2021 — and the couple tied the knot exactly a year later on 11/11 in 2022. They started dating in 2018 and went public with their romance on Instagram that Halloween. The \"Twilight\" star's sister, Makena Moore, is the one who made the original introduction. The actor previously dated famous faces like Taylor Swift and Billie Lourd.\n\n_\n\nRosalie Cullen had a pretty adorable relationship with Emmett Cullen in the \"Twilight\" films, but she certainly didn't have an easy road to love. Off screen, the actress who brought Rosalie to life, Nikki Reed, hit the jackpot in the romance department…\n\n_\n\nNikki Reed is happily married to another hunky on-screen vampire, Ian Somerhalder (who famously starred on \"The Vampire Diaries\"). They wed in April 2015, a little less than a year after they were first rumored to be an item. They welcomed a daughter, Bodhi Soleil, in 2017 and are living happily ever after on a farm together today.\n\n_\n\nKellan Lutz starred as beefy but sweet Emmett Cullen in the \"Twilight\" franchise. He was hopelessly devoted to fellow vampire Rosalie. In real life, he's similarly off the market…\n\n_\n\nKellan Lutz married model Brittany Gonzales in November 2017. The two announced their engagement a few months before that after taking their romance public the year prior. They welcomed a daughter, Ashtyn Lilly, in February 2021, and a son, Kasen, in August 2022. Before Brittany, Kellan romanced actress AnnaLynne McCord, with whom he co-starred on \"90210,\" from 2008 until 2011.\n\n_\n\nAshley Greene brought whimsical vampire Alice Cullen to life. She rocked a pixie haircut and showed off her sweet love story with Jasper. In real life, Ashley is now a married woman…\n\n_\n\nAshley Greene wed Paul Khoury, an Australian TV announcer who counts Liam Hemsworth as his best bud, in 2018. The couple started dating in 2013 and got engaged in 2016 at the bottom of a waterfall. They welcomed their first child, daughter Kingsley Rainn, in September 2022.\n\n_\n\nPlaying Jasper Cullen in the \"Twilight\" flicks remains Jackson Rathbone's most notable role. He happened to find love during the height of his \"Twilight\" fame…\n\n_\n\nJackson Rathbone met Sheila Hafsadi in 2011 when he was touring with his band 100 Monkeys. They wed two years later in 2013 — after welcoming son Monroe the year before. They've since welcomed two more children — daughter Presley, born in 2016, and son Felix, born in 2020 — and settled down in Austin, Texas.\n\n_\n\nThe Cullen family patriarch, Dr. Carlisle Cullen, was portrayed by Peter Facinelli. His love life looked a lot different before and after the smash hit franchise was released…\n\n_\n\nPeter Facinelli had been married to actress Jennie Garth since 2001 when he landed the role of Carlisle Cullen. In 2012 — the same year \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2\" was released — he filed for divorce. He then started dating actress Jaimie Alexander that same year after they met on the set of \"Loosies.\" They got engaged in March 2015 but split in 2016. These days, Peter is engaged to actress Lily Anne Harrison (seen here): He popped the question on New Year's Eve 2019. The couple's wedding plans were paused due to the pandemic, and though they originally rescheduled their nuptials for 2022, life had other plans: They welcomed son Jack that September.\n\n_\n\nUnlike her character, Esme Cullen — the matriarch of the Cullen family — Elizabeth Reaser has kept her private life very private. She has yet to publicly confirm a romantic relationship (though her Instagram feed often includes photos of a man named Bruce Gilbert).\n\n_\n\nWe watched Jessica Stanley look for love at Forks High. In real life, actress Anna Kendrick most recently romanced actor-comedian Bill Hader: In January 2022, People magazine confirmed the pair had been dating for more than a year, but by June, it was over.\n\n_\n\nThough Mike Newton had a failed romance with Bella Swan in the flicks, the actor who played him — Michael Welch — has been luckier in love in real life…\n\n_\n\nMichael Welch married his first wife, Marissa Lefton, in 2008 — the same year the first \"Twilight\" film hit theaters. The two split in 2011. In 2016, Michael married model Samantha Maggio (seen here). They share two children, daughters Parker and River.\n\n_\n\nChristian Serratos played shy, camera-wielding Angela Weber in the \"Twilight\" franchise. Find out more about her love life these days next…\n\n_\n\nChristian Serratos has been dating musician David Boyd, the singer for the band New Politics, for years. The couple share a daughter, Wolfgang, who was born in 2017."
