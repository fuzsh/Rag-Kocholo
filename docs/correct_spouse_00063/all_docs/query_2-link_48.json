        "text": "Image\n\nThis has been an eventful year, and there is much to celebrate. I am very grateful to our donors, whose generosity supports our students and fosters research, scholarship, and community engagement. We simply could not accomplish all that we do without your support.\n\nWe put great effort this year into creating a new strategic plan for Hofstra, including the formation of four committees â composed of faculty, staff, administrators, and students â tasked with developing recommendations in four main areas that had been identified through an earlier campuswide process as key to Hofstraâs future. These areas were Interdisciplinary and New Academic Programs; Student Success; Community Engagement; and Organizational Agility. The committeesâ recommendations are now being used to draw up the strategic plan, which will be complete by the start of the 2024-2025 academic year.\n\nLast fall, we opened the new Science & Innovation Center, a 75,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility that houses the Hofstra Northwell School of Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies and two departments of the DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science. The building has modern, high-tech classrooms, cutting-edge lab facilities, simulated clinical facilities for nursing students, and a large makerspace for use by the whole campus.\n\nNew degree programs were launched this past year. The Herbert School created a cross-departmental Bachelor of Science in Sports Media, and the School of Health Sciences (newly renamed from the School of Health Professions and Human Services) is opening its Doctor of Physical Therapy program this summer.\n\nThe Frank G. Zarb School of Businessâ online MBA program remained in the top 30 nationwide, according to the U.S. News & World Report 2024 Best Online Programs, and was ranked #18 in the country by Poets & Quants and #37 by The Princeton Review. The nursing masterâs programs at the Hofstra Northwell School of Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies moved up 35 spots to #38 in the nation, its highest ranking to date, according to U.S. News & World Report, representing a 77-spot climb over the past five years. Hofstra College of Liberal Arts and Sciencesâ music business program was recognized by Billboard magazine for the fifth time since 2016, and Variety included the Herbert School in its roundup of the best film schools in the country for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nSo many students have accomplishments to boast about this year, so I will highlight just a few. From The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication, six students received awards from the Broadcast Education Association, seven students took home Gracie Awards from the Alliance for Women in Media, and two students were selected to cover the Super Bowl for WRHU, marking the first time Hofstra has been represented at the big game. Tyler Thomas, a member of the Hofstra Pride menâs basketball team, won the Haggerty Award, given to the top NCAA Division I basketball player in the New York metropolitan area.\n\nIn November, we relaunched the Hofstra Magazine. This biannual publication showcases the lives and careers of Hofstra alumni, provides updates on many areas of the University, and offers class notes to stay up to date with classmates. You can expect this publication in your mailbox each November and April, and the issues will be available online.\n\nIn April, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Hempstead for Hofstra/Hofstra for Hempstead. This organization was founded by a group of volunteers dedicated to raising scholarship funds so local high school students could attend Hofstra University. Tens of thousands of dollars have been raised, and many local students have been able to further their education due to these efforts.\n\nThis spring, Hofstra University was one of only 145 universities and colleges around the world to be honored by Exercise is Medicine for its efforts to create a campus culture of wellness. Exercise is Medicine is global health initiative of the American College of Sports Medicine.\n\nCommunity service and civic engagement remain an integral part of the Hofstra student experience. Students completed thousands of hours of community service through food, clothing, and toy drives; area cleanups; tutoring at local schools; and yard work for our neighbors in Hempstead and Uniondale. One Hofstra student, Matthew Adarichev â26, was awarded a Presidentâs Volunteer Service Award by the Long Island Volunteer Center for his outstanding level of community service. A public policy and public service major, Matthew exceeded 250 hours of volunteer work with several local organizations.\n\nIn other exciting community news, Hofstra was selected by the Nassau County Board of Elections as an early voting location for this election season. This designation provides easy access to voting for members of the Hofstra community as well as residents from the surrounding area. This is the first time that a university in Nassau County was chosen to be an early voting site.\n\nPride Athletics had another good year, both on the field and in the classroom. The menâs soccer team advanced to the third round of the NCAA Championship after capturing its third consecutive CAA title. Three student-athletes were named All-Americans, and two student-athletes signed with professional teams. In the classroom, Hofstra student-athletes received a combined 3.48 grade point average in the fall semester, the 23rd consecutive semester that the average topped 3.00. Additionally, Hofstraâs cheer and dance teams took home first place honors at the 2024 Universal Cheerleaders Association and Universal Dance Association College Nationals, held in Orlando, FL.\n\nSeveral new leaders joined Hofstra University this year. We welcomed Lorrie McAllister as dean of libraries; Chermele Christy as dean of students; and, beginning July 1, 1024, Jenny Roberts as dean of the Maurice A. Deane School of Law. Dr. Cornell Craig was promoted to become Hofstraâs inaugural vice president for equity and inclusion.\n\nFinally, as you know, world affairs made this a challenging year in higher education. I am proud to say that the maturity and character of our student body, as well as the hard work and combined efforts of faculty, staff, and administrators, resulted in our maintaining a peaceful campus. We demonstrated that there can be free speech, civility, and peace even where passions run high and beliefs and feelings are at odds. We have been steadfast in putting safety first, and in enforcing our longstanding policy of intolerance for antisemitism, Islamophobia, and any other form of discrimination or harassment.\n\nI hope this makes you as proud of our beloved University as I am. Thank you for your support and commitment to Hofstra.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSusan Poser, President"
