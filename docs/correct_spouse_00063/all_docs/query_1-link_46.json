        "text": "Michael Welch, who played Mike Netwon in the first three Twilight movies, has gotten divorced from his wife Marissa Lefton, reports TMZ. Lefton is a former child actress — she played Annie at three years-old in Father of the Bride. The two were married in 2008, separated in December of 2011, and made the divorce official this month. On Valentine’s Day. The same day that Kris Humphries‘ lawyer dumped him. News of the divorce is just coming to light (no pun intended). Hey, you try finding non-Oscar related news the night after/early morning of the Oscars. Seriously though, divorce sucks and he seems like a good guy. He’s a spokesperson for The Thirst Project, a nonprofit organization that “informs and empowers students regarding the global water crisis.”\n\nThey are both 25. DAMN it sucks to get divorced so young."
