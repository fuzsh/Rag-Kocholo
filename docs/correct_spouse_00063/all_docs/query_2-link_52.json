        "text": "Team Hampton just keeps getting better & better! While I've been on maternity leave for the last several months, it was so incredible to get together with the team IRL for the CAMPTON retreat before I officially return in a few weeks. Community & hospitality is core to Hampton's business and it's reflected in everything we do as a team as well. We really do practice what we preach. So grateful to be part of a team that values their employees as people first. Jordan DiPietro, Sam Parr, Joe Speiser, Anna Cogswell, Anna Santiago, Maya Miro, Margaret Lefton, Julie Cooper Geer, Ali Greenberg, Laura Cyrek Gignac, Alex Stanton, Doug Reale, Jeff Breunsbach, Patricia Bajis, Alexa McKnight, Brandy Myrah, D'azhane Cook see ya'll soon!\n\nSo special to dip my toes back with the one and only Stephanie Redlener and the Lioness community! It's truly magical what happens when you bring women together and create a space for them to be vulnerable and real. Thank you to the inspiring women who showed up and let their guards down- Kae Burke Dom Farnan Allison Fleece Alysha Malik Carrie Zhang Chloe Anderson Jenna Guarneri Jess Goldberg Lydia Winkler Manuela Milan Perez (she/her) Rebecca Sharzer Vishwa Goohya Karishma \"Kush‚Äù Chawla Britta Larsen.

And big thank you to The Culinistas for such a delicious meal üòç As always, tag a female founder who should attend one of our dinners (hosted in NYC!)\n\nHappy International Women‚Äôs Day to all of the inspiring, uplifting and remarkable women in my life. As I enter a new chapter of motherhood, this past year has changed my perspective on what it means to be a woman. Last year, I started IVF a week after I began my new job at Hampton. I balanced the intensity of a new job with the emotional and physical rollercoaster of IVF and then a high risk pregnancy. On January 27th, 2 months early, I welcomed my son Charlie into the world. I spent 36 days by his side in the NICU. Everything else stopped and my career was put on hold. As a woman, bringing and nurturing a new life into this world can mean - as it did for me- putting yours on hold. It can be emotionally and physically taxing. However, this year also taught me the power of vulnerability, kindness and compassion. I‚Äôve been incredibly supported by my family, friends, strangers, and the entire team at Hampton. I was also immediately bonded and supported by other woman who also dealt with infertility or NICU babies. The power of women supporting women is unstoppable. If you‚Äôre a woman struggling with infertility or caring for a NICU baby, I see you and am sending you all of the strength - you got this! Being a woman can be hard and you are amazing. A reminder to always give people the benefit of the doubt, be patient, be kind, be respectful. You never know what someone is going through. Shoutout to a few of the many incredible women who I get to partner and work with: Anna Santiago, Anna Cogswell, Maya Miro, Margaret Lefton, Julie Cooper Geer, Ali Greenberg, Laura Gignac Cyrek, Stephanie Redlener, Angela Parker, Brandy Myrah, Molly Bridges and so many more!\n\nüì£ The Hampton team is growing, this time on our Membership Sales Team! This person will play a crucial role in carefully expanding our community. It's a remote sales position for someone who has a comfort level speaking with entrepreneurs and CEOs, and can quickly get up to speed on a variety of startups, business models, and technologies. We‚Äôre looking for someone who loves talking to people and building rapport with some of the most impressive and influential founders in the startup world.

Over the last 2 years, Stephanie Redlener and I have teamed up to host over 150 female founders at our intimate, behind closed door dinner series. What happens at the dinner stays at the dinner üòâ After attending a dinner, women get added to our private WhatsApp group (140+ women!) to connect and help each other. For months, we talked about gathering everyone who has attended a dinner under one roof for a special evening. Last night, we finally did it for a celebratory and intimate holiday party celebration! We gathered to connect, reflect on the year, share our desires for the future and celebrate all that we accomplished. There were laughs and meditations and dance parties and so much more. Beyond grateful to learn from and get to partner with the incredible and master facilitator Stephanie Redlener, what a gift! Big thanks to all of the incredible women who choose to spend your busy holiday season with us - we're so grateful for you!
