        "text": "Welch unexpectedly took the stage at the end of the sixth annual Thirst Gala, which raises funds to end the global water crisis, and asked his date Maggio to marry him.\n\nThe actor, who played Mike Newton in the first three installments of the hit vampire/werewolf franchise, told the audience he had hired a violinist to play Elvis Presley's classic Can't Help Falling In Love, but his plane was delayed.\n\nWelch improvised and called on the crowd to hum the romantic song as he got down on one knee.\n\nHe later took to Twitter.com to share a picture of himself and his new fiancee, who proudly showed off her new sparkling diamond engagement ring, and he added the caption, \"Well I had a pretty good night... the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to be my wife. If I look a bit dazed, I was. I blacked out during (sic).\"\n\nThis will be the second marriage for Welch, who split from ex-wife Marissa Lefton in 2011."
