Not all “Twilight” romances are for eternity.

Mortal man Michael Welch – better known as Mike Newton, the high school human who had a crush on Bella throughout “The Twilight Saga” – and his wife of more than four years, Marissa Lefton, filed for divorce on Valentine’s Day.

Welch, 25, and Lefton tied the knot in 2008 – the same year the first “Twilight” movie hit theaters – but separated at the end of 2011, according to TMZ.

The pair had no children or property to battle over, so we’re guessing this should be a pretty easy split.

The same day of the filing, Welch was making jokes on Twitter about a girlfriend. “I gotta run. Still need to go buy my gf a new Lexus for valentines day. She's tired of the BMW I bought her for Christmas,” he wrote, following it up with a quick “Just kidding.”

Welch can be seen in “Hansel & Gretel Get Baked” with “Castle” star Molly C. Quinn, currently in select theaters and set for home video release on June 25.
