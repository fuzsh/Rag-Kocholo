Twilight star Michael Welch is divorcing wife Marissa Lefton. The 25-year-old, who plays Mike Newton in the popular series, filed for divorce earlier this month in LA.

The pair married in 2008, but separated in December 2011 and allegedly filed for divorce on Valentine's Day.

It is thought that the divorce will be relatively uncomplicated as they don't have any children or shared property.

Marissa played three-year-old Annie in the 1991 film Father Of The Bride, while Mike has just completed The Demented, which is out this year.
