During the war, this (along with so much else) was lost. Today, Glenn Anthony Borromeo, Omar Borromeo Sazon and Maria Clara Borromeo Serio of Negros Oriental have helped re-establish the direct link between the Borromeo clans of Cebu and Negros. Freddie Borromeo of Makati has likewise helped us reconnect the missing information linking the Borromeo clans of Cavite on Luzon (settled there in 1744) and of Iloilo on Panay (settled there in 1769) to the Borromeo clan of Tanjay City on Negros (settled there in 1794) and finally to my own Borromeo clan of Cebu City on the Island Province of Cebu (settled in Cebu in 1819).\n\nNote: the history of my immediate family branch (that of my first cousins the Borromeo family of Southern California, of the Querouz family and the Atega family) and the “Rallos” family tree may both be found at the end of the article on my illustrious maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880-1923).\n\nHier kann man über die Geschichte der Familie Borromeo in den Philippinen lesen. Die Familie Borromeo ist in den Philippinen seit dem Jahre 1744, als sich Karl Kapitän Aro (“Carlos Capitan Aro”) Borromeo in Cavite auf Luzon ansiedelte. In den folgenden Generationen, ist die Familie von Cavite auf Luzon nach Iloilo auf Panay, dann nach Bacolod auf Negros, und hat sich danach in der Stadt Cebu, auf der Insel Cebu nieder gelassen. Cavite, Iloilo, Bacolod und Cebu sind alle Städte. Luzon, Panay, Negros und auch Cebu sind alle Inseln. Es gibt mehr als 7,000 philippinische Inseln mit oft verschiedenen Dialekten. Die englische Sprache und auch die spanische Sprache sind weit verbreitet.\n\nA Genealogy researched before World War Two – but Lost in 1945 and finally reclaimed in 2019 (thanks to Freddie Borromeo of Makati)\n\nThe memory of Lolo Marcial’s work was passed onto me by two of his children (2nd cousins of my mother Hermenegilda Amor Victoria Borromeo Nonnenkamp). These were my uncle Tito Tomas Luis Cabrera Borromeo (born in 1910) and his younger sister my aunt Tita Day Angelita Cabrera Borromeo (born in 1911, and the eldest living member of the extended Cebuano Borromeo family in 2009).\n\nVor dem zweiten Weltkrieg, hat Marcial Borromeo y Guerrero (der Vetter meines Großvaters) die Ahnenforschung der Familie Borromeo in den Philippinen geschrieben. Bedauerlicherweise hat dieses ausführliche Werk den Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht überstanden. Ein Grund weil ich in die 1980er Jahren anfing einen neuen Familienstammbaum und die Ahnenforschung neu aufzubauen.\n\nThese elders told me that we Borromeos of Cebu Province (and Island) are related to other Borromeos in the Philippines going back even further in time. The father of Carlos Borromeo IV y Felis (born 1795) was Carlos Borromeo III (born 1770). We believe that Carlos Borromeo IV y Felis was born in Bacolod, Negros in 1795 and that he settled in Cebu. Negros and Cebu are neighboring islands in the Visayas region of the Philippine archipelago. The father of Carlos Borromeo III was Carlo Borromeo II (born circa 1745 and who used the Italian spelling for his given name). Carlos Borromeo III is believed to have been born in Iloilo, Panay (yet another island within the Visayas region) in 1770 and to have settled in Bacolod, Negros. His father Carlo Borromeo II was born in Cavite on Luzon (not part of the Visayas) in 1745 and is believed to have settled in Iloilo, Panay. We believe that the father of Carlo Borromeo II was Carlo “Capitan Aro” Borromeo I who was born in 1720 and eventually settled his family in Cavite on the island of Luzon (he worked as both a professional harbor captain and as a municipal official – hence the title “Capitan”). Among the Borromeo family of Negros Oriental, there is a legend that their Borromeo ancestors migrated from Northern Italy to Spain, and then to the Philippines. My own Tito Tomas Cabrera Borromeo (my mother’s second degree cousin) once told me that his father (Lolo Marcial Borromeo y Guerrero) believed that our ancestor Carlo “Capitan Aro” Borromeo came from Canton (China) to Cavite (on the island of Luzon in the Philippines). Based upon what we know today, it is possible that members of the Borromeo family migrated from Lombardy in northern Italy to Spain, France (specifically Corsica where the surname is spelled in Latin as “Borromei”), the New World (Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Chile), to China (Canton) and finally to the Philippines and even to India. In Brazil, the surname is spelled in Portuguese as “Borromeu.”\n\nThe Philippines were part of the vast global Spanish Empire from 1521 until 1898. The Portuguese-born explorer Ferdinand Magellan claimed the Philippines (initially named the “Islands of Lazarus”) for Spain in 1521. He and his remaining 3 sailing ships (out of an original 5 which had departed from Spain) landed in what is today Cebu City. At the time, Cebu was comprised of a mere 300 or so bamboo huts built upon stilts. Magellan and his 3 remaining wooden sailing vessels were manned by about 150 Europeans (Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Greeks and Germans) and one Malay slave who acted as their interpreter. Each ship ranged in size from a mere 75 to 125 tons total displacement – good for their time, but tiny by today’s standards. Magellan had left Seville, Spain with 270 men aboard 5 sailing ships. 2 ships were lost around Cape Horn (at the Southern tip of South America, which is the most dangerous sea passage on earth due to its rough waters and extreme weather). One ship was scuttled damaged in the Philippines, while another (the “Trinidad”) was left in the Moluccas, Indonesia as no longer seaworthy. Merely one ship (the “Vittoria”) and 18 Europeans made it back to Seville alive 3 years after their original departure from Spain.\n\nCarlo Borromeo I’s eventual title of “Capitan” was due to being a harbor captain by profession. In addition to this, he was also a “Gobernadorcillo,” or Departmental Administrator of Cavite on Luzon. His salary in the 1740s was 30 Pesos per year, a large sum of money in those days. The Gobernadorcillos were chosen by an elite corps of so-called “Principalia,” also known by the titles of either “Alcalde Mayor” or “Gobernador.” This higher official was like a combined Provincial Governor and State Supreme Court Justice, who was in turn appointed by the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.\n\nThe Gobernadorcillos in turn appointed “Cabezas,” (or Filipino Chiefs) who served as Parish (town) Justices. The Gobernadorcillo enforced the law, judged petty disputes and generally ran the community in which he lived.\n\nThe first Chinese settled in the Philippines in 1401, when their Emperor made an attempt to colonize the islands. The first Spaniards came in 1521. The first Italian not under the Spanish flag came to the Philippines in the 17th century; his name was Gemelli Careri. The first American who settled in the Philippines was actually one John Stuart Kerr, who settled in Manila between 1786 and 1796.\n\nManila had a population of 45,000 souls in 1680, 90,000 by 1780, 150,000 by 1860 and 270,000 by 1880. In 1780, 4,000 of Manila’s inhabitants were white Spaniards and another 15,000 were Chinese. In the old days, metropolitan Manila consisted of the walled city, and of Binondo. Most of the people lived in Binondo (140,000 out of 150,000 in 1860).\n\nWhat follows is a newspaper article written upon the death of my maternal great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan in 1930 (translated into English by my late aunt Maria Benita Borromeo Atega):\n\nThe Venerable and Respected “Pepe” Borromeo has died\n\nLast Sunday at 7:00 AM (March 16, 1930) Mr. José Maria Borromeo y Galan of Cebu City died. He had been afflicted by a severe and sudden illness, which claimed the life of this highly respected and well-known patriarch of the city of Cebu. Mr. José Maria Borromeo y Galan was known to his friends and family by the name of “Señor Iyo Pepe.”\n\nThe news of his death immediately spread throughout the entire city last Sunday. Within a few hours of his passing, countless friends and relatives converged upon the Borromeo home on North America Street. The burial took place on Monday. A Mass was offered with the body of the deceased lying in state at the Cebu Cathedral that morning. Many people attended the final rites at the Cebu Cathedral, after which they joined the funeral procession and the rites at the Roman Catholic Cemetery. We can say that the funeral service was an expression of sympathy by the Cebuano people for the entire Borromeo family.\n\nIyo Pepe Borromeo was the father of the late Judge Andrés Borromeo, Captain José Ubaldo Borromeo (former Head of the Detectives of Manila Customs Bureau), Dr. Maximo Borromeo, Pharmacist Exequiel Borromeo and Engineer Canuto Octavio Borromeo.\n\nHe was an exemplary man because he sacrificed much so that his children would achieve the professions which now are know their own. He was also respected and loved as an exemplary public citizen and as a wonderful individual due to his cordial personality, helpfulness and golden character.\n\nMay he rest in peace, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family from the entire staff and readership of the “New Strength” newspaper.\n\nThe nine children of my great-grandparents were my maternal grandfather (the eldest of the nine siblings) and my great aunts and uncles:\n\nJudge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880-1923)\n\nCaptain José Ubaldo Borromeo y Reynes (1881-1949)\n\nMatilde Borromeo y Reynes (1883-1946)\n\nDr. Maximo Borromeo y Reynes (1887-1948)\n\nPharmacist Exequiel Borromeo y Reynes (1889-1949)\n\nEngineer Canuto Octavio Borromeo y Reynes (1891-1959)\n\nVenustiano Borromeo y Reynes (1891-1891)\n\nPatrocinio Reynes Borromeo de Uy Herrera (1892-1984)\n\nSalud Borromeo y Reynes (1898-1969)\n\nThe grandchildren of my maternal grandfather’s siblings are thus my second degree cousins.\n\nSecond Cousins\n\nIt was from the estate of my maternal great-grandparents (Don José Maria Borromeo y Galan and Doña Margarita Sy Reynes de Borromeo) that the modern Borromeo Business Group was formed. The group was incorporated on February 8, 1933 but was already well-known as a manufacturer of “Tartanilla” horse-drawn carts since 1879. Here is a nice Cebu-based website page on the history of the “Tartanilla” (from Cebu and the Visayas region) and the “Calesa” horse-drawn cart (from Manila and the Luzon region): http://cebuwebsite.tripod.com/tartanillas.html\n\nOrigin of the Name “Tartanilla”\n\n“Tartanilla” is Spanish for the Italian “Tartanella.” The latter word is derived from the Italian word “Tartana,” which refers to a type of small sailing vessel used for fishing in the Adriatic Sea. They use both sails and oars for propulsion, and can range from 10 to 100 tons full load. A “Tartanella” is merely a smaller “Tartana,” whereas a “Tartanone” is the larger version.\n\nThe family branches of the younger siblings of my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (November 10, 1880 – January 3, 1923) are as follows:\n\n2. Captain José Ubaldo Borromeo y Reynes (1881-1949)\n\nCaptain José Ubaldo Borromeo y Reynes (October 21, 1881 – May 8, 1949) was married to Remedios Rodriga de Borromeo (December 27, 1891 – September 25, 1935). Lolo José served as Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc. from its inception in 1933 until his death in 1949. They had one child, who was my “Tita Pepa” Josefa Borromeo Capistrano (born in 1911). She was married to my “Tito Nick” Nicolas Castañeda Capistrano.\n\nTita Pepa was a personal friend of US General Douglas MacArthur, and in fact started & led the Womens’ Auxiliary Corps (WACS) of the Philippines in World War Two. Tita Pepa also served as honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc. from 1949 until her death in 2004. Before he retired, Tito Nick was a successful logging company owner in Northern Mindanao.\n\nMy Tita Pepa and Tito Nick had two children, my second cousins Remedios Capistrano Dovas and Mario Borromeo Capistrano. Remedios (my cousin “Didi”) resides in Chicago, Illinois and Mario lives in Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao in the Philippines. Didi is married to Christos Dovas and they have three children named Lara, Tom and Peter.

Mario Jr. is married to Rachel Apostol-Capistrano and they have one daughter named Marion Alexa “Max” Capistrano (born November 11, 2012).\n\n3. Matilde Borromeo y Reynes (1883-1946)\n\nMatilde Borromeo y Reynes (March 14, 1883 – August 4, 1946) never married and thus remained a spinster until she died.\n\n4.

Sophie Gossinitser Borromeo is believed to be in Austria today, while the descendants of Johnny Cairo Borromeo are in Mandaue (Cebu), the Philippines.\n\nLolo Max was a Director of the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc. from its inception in 1933 until his death in 1948. Tita Carol (November 4, 1917 – December 28, 2015) was married to my “Tito Ledo” Leandro Ocampo (1914-1977), who was a very successful engineer. His company (Alltech Contractors) once employed up to 3,400 employees engaged in power plant construction throughout the Philippines and the Middle East. Alltech was part of an alliance with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, and was sold by its owners in 2004.

These include Crown Fruit (the largest pineapple grower in the Philippines after Dole of the USA), AMS Farming Corporation, AMJR Holdings, Soriano Fruits Corporation and Cabadbaran Fruits Corporation (global leaders in the output of both bananas and papayas). Wholly-owned companies providing sales and transportation support include JOS Trading Corporation, Redwood Logistics Corporation and DTI Overland Transport Corporation. Yet another company (AMSIA Management) owns numerous retail Shell gasoline stations in Northern California. The companies led by Bobby employ yet another 3,000 employees in the Philippines and in the USA. Bobby since turned over the day-to-day leadership of his companies to his eldest son Joey Ocampo Soriano.\n\nA different branch of the Soriano family is famous for their ownership of San Miguel Corporation, one of the largest corporations in the Philippines. San Miguel today is a vast food conglomerate very well known for “San Miguel” beer.\n\nDr. Juanito Johnny Cairo Borromeo (born February 26, 1936) is the son of Dr. Maximo Borromeo y Reynes (1887-1948) and Teresa Mina Cairo (September 29, 1920 – October 26, 2000).

Salud Borromeo y Reynes (1898-1969)\n\nThe estate of Salud Borromeo y Reynes (the youngest sibling of my maternal grandfather known as my “Lola Saling”) is today the Salud Borromeo Memorial Charity Clinic and Foundation, one of the largest charitable organizations on the island of Leyte. It is located in the city of San Isidro, the headquarters of our agribusiness subsidiary. This company is known as “Margarita Agro-Industrial Corporation,” being named after my great-grandmother Margarita Sy Reynes de Borromeo (my “Nanay Titay”). She purchased this large tract of land in the 1880s with profits from her husband’s horse-carriage (“Tartanilla”) manufacturing business and from her own business of trading in salt at the Cebu City wharf. Salud Borromeo y Reynes was born on September 7, 1898 and died on November 30, 1969 with no legal will.\n\nThis completes all of the Borromean lines of my second cousins.\n\nThird Cousins\n\nMy great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan (my “Tatay Pepe” who lived from 1847-1930) was the second of 11 children of my great-great grandparents Maximo Borromeo y Feliz (1820-1892) and Hermenegilda Galan de Borromeo (April 13, 1825-1894). My mother was named after Maximo’s wife, who was known as “Nanay Binda.”\n\nIn an urban population that numbered 10,078 in 1834 (when Tatay Maximo Borromeo y Feliz was just 14 years old), the Parian-Lutaos parish incorporated slightly more than two-thirds (67%) of the inhabitants of Cebu. For these “Ciudadnons” (city dwellers) the Parian was the central focus of their religious and social life. A group of approximately 30 wealthy “Mestizo” families appears to have monopolized the elite of Parian and its parish. These families represented a close-knit, socially inter-related group that tended to confine its marriages if not strictly within the principal families, then almost always within the larger mestizo community. The records of the Philippine National Archives show 28 families that composed Parian’s elite in the early 19th century: Alo, Borromeo, de Castro, Climaco, Cuico (Cuyco), Espina, Gandiongco, Gantuangco, Garces, Janson, Limcaco, del Mar, Narvios, Noel, Osmeña, Regis, Reynes, Rodis, Rubi, Sanson (Samson), Singson, Sison, Solon, Suico, Valle, Velez, Veloso and Villa.\n\nThe elder sister of my great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan never married and had no offspring. The 11 children of Tatay Maximo and Nanay Binda were:\n\nLeoncia Borromeo y Galan (no issue)\n\nJosé Maria Borromeo y Galan\n\nJulian Borromeo y Galan (1853-January 18, 1919): died aged 66 years; no issue\n\nFlorentina Borromeo y Galan (no issue)\n\nAniceta Galan Borromeo de Ocampo\n\nPantaleon Borromeo y Galan\n\nCosme Borromeo y Galan\n\nVito Borromeo y Galan\n\nQuirino Borromeo y Galan (no issue)\n\nTrinidad Borromeo y Galan (no issue)\n\nPaolo Borromeo y Galan\n\nTheir great-grand children are thus my third degree cousins. The estate (home) of Maximo Borromeo y Feliz and Hermenegilda Galan de Borromeo was located in Banawa, Cebu, was purchased in 1844 and was only sold in 1990 (146 years later). Vito Borromeo y Galan’s estate still exists today as a corporate entity, and it in turn has a seat upon the Board of Directors of the Salud Borromeo Foundation.\n\nAs can be seen in the list above, Julian Borromeo y Galan was single and had no issue (offspring). Florentina Borromeo y Galan was in the same situation, with no issue. Aniceta Borromeo y Galan married Francisco Ocampo, and they had one daughter named Aurora Borromeo y Ocampo. Aurora was single and had no issue, so this line of the family died out as well.\n\nPantaleon Borromeo y Galan married Remigia Pulaire de Borromeo (this was the first of his two wives), and they had three children named Ismaela Borromeo y Pulaire, Crispin Borromeo y Pulaire and Teofilo Borromeo y Pulaire.\n\nIsmaela Borromeo y Pulaire married Escolastico Morre. They had seven children, named Lilia Borromeo Morre, Patricia Borromeo Morre, Aurora Borromeo Morre, Rosario Borromeo Morre, Isagani Borromeo Morre, Lamberto Borromeo Morre and Floro Borromeo Morre.\n\nLilia Borromeo Morre married Teopisto Tabotabo, and they had five children, being my third degree cousins Dr. Armando Morre Tabotabo, Merardo Morre Tabotabo, Cesar Morre Tabotabo, Lorena Morre Tabotabo and Evelyn Morre Tabotabo.\n\nPatricia Borromeo Morre married a man with the surname of Ranario (I do not know his first or given / Christian names) and moved to Stockton, California. They had five children (at least one of whom lives in New Jersey), being my third cousins Napoleon Morre Ranario, Alexander Morre Ranario, Maria Ofelia Morre Ranario, Chester Morre Ranario and Marian Morre Ranario.\n\nAurora Borromeo Morre married her cousin Manuel Infante Borromeo. They had two children, being my third cousins Norma Morre Borromeo and Josephine Morre Borromeo. Norma passed away on January 9, 2008. She was married to Dionisio Guevarra Venzon, Jr. from Batangas, and they have three children named Jennifer Borromeo Venzon, Dionisio Borromeo Venzon III and Mary Ann Borromeo Venzon. Jennifer is married to Elmer Enerio Aque from Aloran in Misamis Occidental, and they have two children named Edman Josh Venzon Aque and Beatriz Faith Venzon Aque. Dionisio Borromeo Venzon III (who kindly shared this information with our site) is married to Princess Abrigo Austria from Indang (Cavite on Luzon), and they have three children named Harold Efrain Austria Venzon, Thomas Harvey Austria Venzon and Norman Hill Austria Venzon. Mary Ann Borromeo Venzon is married to Vergel Elacion Misola from Santa Cruz (Zambales), and they have one daughter named Jazmine Aubrey Venzon Misola. My late third degree cousin Josephine Morre Borromeo was married to Attorney Leonardo Palicte III, and they have three children named Leo Jamal Borromeo Palicte, Joshua Borromeo Palicte and Jessamine Faith Borromeo Palicte.\n\nRosario Borromeo Morre married Alfredo Gatchalian, Sr. They had two children, being my third cousins Rodolfo Morre Gatchalian and Alfredo Morre Gatchalian, Jr.\n\nIsagani Borromeo Morre did not marry and had no issue (offspring). Lamberto Borromeo Morre was in the same situation, with no marriage and no issue. Ditto with Floro Borromeo Morre, so these three lines will eventually or have already died out.\n\nCrispin Borromeo y Pulaire (who became a municipal judge in Cebu) married Petra Ozaraga. They have one son named José Ozaraga Borromeo (1938-2013) who married Sela Quijano; both of them moved to Houston, Texas where they worked and eventually retired from ChevronTexaco. José and Sela have three children named Joesel Quijano Borromeo, Martonette Quijano Borromeo and Marjoe Quijano Borromeo. Joesel is married to Cyd Therese Acosta, and they have two children named Jo Trescha Acosta Borromeo and Selsy Mae Acosta Borromeo. Martonette is single. Marjoe is married to Maria Stella Tonggao Borromeo and they have two children named Steony Tonggao Borromeo and Anthony Tonggao Borromeo.\n\nTeofilo Borromeo y Pulaire married Remedios Cuenco de Borromeo, and they had one son named José Cuenco Borromeo.

Angelica Rusiana Borromeo is divorced from a Wrobel, and they have one son named Andrew Borromeo Wrobel.\n\nThe second wife of Pantaleon Borromeo y Galan (Pantaleon was of course a younger brother of my great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan) was named Francisca Good de Borromeo. They had two sons, named Francisco Borromeo y Good and Patricio Borromeo y Good. Francisco Borromeo y Good married, but I do not know the name of his wife. They had one son named Teobaldo Borromeo who did not marry and had no issue (offspring). Patricio Borromeo y Good also married, but I do not know the name of his wife either. Patricio and his wife had two children, named Ananias Borromeo and Basilia Borromeo.\n\nAnanias Borromeo married Eleuteria Mendoza, and they have ten children (my third degree cousins) named Antonio Mendoza Borromeo, Wilfredo Mendoza Borromeo, Jennifer Mendoza Borromeo, Rory Yul Mendoza Borromeo, Joni Mendoza Borromeo, Judith Mendoza Borromeo, Jacqueline Mendoza Borromeo, Joan Mendoza Borromeo, Jocelyn Mendoza Borromeo and Victor Mendoza Borromeo.

Victor Mendoza Borromeo is married to Joan and they have five children named Nina Gavrieljh Borromeo, Vien Carlo Borromeo, Tyron Troy Borromeo, Wyeth Ken Borromeo and John Victor Borromeo.\n\nAvanias’ sister Basilia is single and has no issue.\n\nCosme Borromeo y Galan was the next youngest sibling of Pantaleon Borromeo y Galan. Cosme Borromeo y Galan married Petronila Guerrero de Borromeo. They had seven children, being Marcial Borromeo y Guerrero, José Borromeo y Guerrero, Carlos Borromeo y Guerrero, Carmen Borromeo y Guerrero, Asuncion Borromeo y Guerrero, Florentina Borromeo y Guerrero and Emilio Borromeo y Guerrero. These children were thus first cousins to my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes. Marcial Borromeo y Guerrero also happened to be my grandfather’s best friend – the two men especially enjoyed horseback riding with one another. My grandfather’s last horse was a beautiful white stallion named “Quaranto” – after one of his successful court cases. In fact, “Quaranto” survived his famous master to provide companionship and transportation (pulling a Borromeo “Tartanilla” horse-drawn cart) to my grandmother and her surviving six children.\n\nMarcial Borromeo y Guerrero married Rosario Cabrera de Borromeo, and they had seven children named Cosme Borromeo, Tomas Luis Cabrera Borromeo, Angelita Cabrera Borromeo, Josefina Borromeo Neri, Maria Borromeo Reunilla, Prescillano Cabrera Borromeo and Domingo Cabrera Borromeo. These children are of course second degree cousins to my mother, Hermenegilda Amor Victoria Borromeo Nonnenkamp.\n\nCosme (my “Tito Cosme”) Borromeo married Corazon, and they had two children, who in turn had five children, who in turn had eight children, who in turn had one child.\n\nThe next sibling of Cosme Cabrera Borromeo was Tomas Luis Cabrera Borromeo. My “Tito Tomas” was a lawyer by trade and was also the best friend of his second cousin and my uncle “Tito Diding” (Andrés Rallos Borromeo). Many who knew them said they looked very similar as well. Tito Tomas was married to one of the wealthiest women in the Philippines named Carmen Fargas Barredo Borromeo. My “Tita Carmen” came from an old Spanish colonial family in the Philippines. I had the privilege of seeing her shortly before she passed away at their home in Mandaluyong in metropolitan Manila. Tita Carmen’s parents had three children. When her father Fausto Barredo passed away in 1937, the same year she married my Tito Tomas, the Barredo estate was valued at 400 million Pesos ($200 million at the exchange rate of the time). This was one of the largest fortunes in the entire Philippines, and the holdings of the family included much of the real estate in old Manila. This was granted to them by the Spanish Crown (the Philippines were a Spanish Crown Colony from 1521 until 1898), just as modern Makati was granted to the Zobel de Ayala family (an old Basque Spanish family in the Philippines who now own the oldest incorporated and largest business group in the country).\n\nIn the case of Tita Carmen’s family, both the Fargas family (her mother’s family) and the Barredo family (her father’s family) were wealthy old Spanish families in the Philippines. They formed a company named “Fabar” (a combination of the name of “Fausto Barredo,” who was the patriarch of the Barredo family FABAR fortune), which became the first company to assemble (not manufacture) motor vehicles in the Philippines after World War Two. Fabar, Inc. was established out of the old Malate Stables of Fausto Barredo and evolved into the Malate Taxicab in Manila, which eventually included the Royal Taxicab franchise in Baguio.\n\nThey began assembling Studebaker automobiles in 1951, which made history – they owned the very first auto assembly plant in the Philippines. Fausto Barredo thus had something very much in common with my own great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan (1847-1930). Both men made their fortunes by manufacturing horse-drawn carriages. In the case of my great-grandfather, it was the Cebuano “Tartanilla.” In the case of Fausto Barredo, it was the famous “Karatela” of Luzon. In both cases, they were instrumental in starting the Philippine vehicle industry. My great-grandfather’s company built and sold the “Tartanilla” from 1879 until 1933. In the case of Fausto Barredo, I believe his company built and marketed the “Karatela” from about 1890 until 1945.\n\nFabar owned the Philippine Studebaker franchise from 1951 until the demise of Studebaker as a car company in 1966. Studebaker was based in the old Catholic city of South Bend, Indiana. It was the largest vehicle maker in the world from 1861 until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Ford Motor Company. Studebaker was founded by German immigrants to the USA from Solingen in the Catholic Rhineland region. Their original name of “Stutenbecker” was changed to Studebaker when they settled in the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) country in the 18th century. They eventually migrated to Ohio and finally to Indiana. Studebaker became very large due to contracts to manufacture and sell horse-drawn wagons to the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861 to 1865). In 1954, Studebaker merged with Packard of Michigan to form the Studebaker-Packard Corporation. They continued to manufacture passenger cars until 1966, when the old South Bend factory was sold to Chrysler. Production of the high performance Avanti Coupé continues to this very day, albeit at a very low volume from a plant located in Cancun, Mexico. Fabar held the Philippine Studebaker franchise from 1951 until 1966, after which they purchased the Philippine franchise for B.MC. (the “British Motor Corporation”). They then exchanged the British franchise for Toyota of Japan, a franchise which they kept until 1984.\n\nB.M.C. was formed in 1952 due to the merger of Morris and Austin of the United Kingdom. B.M.C. owned the British brands of Austin, M.G. (“Morris Garages”), Morris, Riley, Wolseley, Austin-Healey and Vanden Plas. On December 14, 1966 B.M.C. changed their name to B.M.H., or “British Motor Holdings.” B.M.H. then merged with Leyland in May 1968, which became the “British Leyland Motor Corporation” (B.L.M.C.). B.L.M.C. was partly nationalized by the British government in August 1975, after which it was renamed “British Leyland, Limited.” The same company was again renamed the “Rover Group” in 1986, the “MG Rover Group” in the year 2000, and they were finally purchased by their current owner, the Nanjing Automobile Group of China, in April 2005.\n\nThis huge conglomerate included most remaining British motor vehicle marques that were not part of either General Motors (Vauxhall and Bedford), Ford or the Rootes Group (Rootes was eventually purchased by Chrysler Corporation). After the Second World War, the British vehicle makers had the largest market share worldwide after the Americans, and the British were number one in parts of Asia (the Philippines included), Australia, Oceania, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe British motor industry has since lost most of its national independence. Rolls-Royce and Mini are owned by B.M.W. of Munich, Germany. Bentley and Cosworth (the latter being an engine manufacturer) are owned by Volkswagen A.G. of Wolfsburg, Germany. Jaguar and Land-Rover are owned by Tata Motors of India, and Lotus is owned by Proton of Malaysia. TVR is owned by the Russian banker and businessman Nikolai Smolensky, while AC Cars is owned by Gullwing G.m.b.H. of Germany. SAIC-Nanjing Motor Corporation of China owns the formerly British automotive brands of MG (“Morris Garages”) and Roewe (formerly known as “Rover”). SAIC stands for “Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.” The information about the Fabar automotive franchises was kindly shared with me by Rosie Barredo Borromeo and her cousin Carlos “Caloy” Barredo.\n\nMy Tito Tomas Luis Cabrera Borromeo and my Tita Carmen Barredo Borromeo had ten children, being my third cousins Maria Pilar (“Piluchi”) Barredo Borromeo, Gabriela (“Bingo”) Maria Cristina Barredo Borromeo Berenguer, Maria Juliana (“Julie”) Irene Barredo Borromeo, Maria Rosa (“Rosie”) Redenta Barredo Borromeo Rieth, José Vito (“Pocholo”) Miguel Francisco Barredo Borromeo, Marcial Alfonso (“Lito”) Barredo Borromeo, Maria Cecilia (“Cibbie”) Barredo Borromeo, Tomas (“Tom-Tom”) Clemente Barredo Borromeo, Miguelangelo (“Mike”) Valentino Barredo Borromeo and Maria Victoria Paz (“Toy-Toy”) Barredo Borromeo. My mother lived with this warm and wonderful family in Mandaluyong for two years from 1955 to 1957.\n\nMaria Pilar Barredo Borromeo (1938-2019) was married to the late Carl Garmsen. Carl was born in Mindanao, but his father emigrated to the Philippines from Germany. Pilar and Carl have two children named Patricia Borromeo Garmsen and Carl (“Cali”) Borromeo Garmsen. Patricia is married and has three children. She and her family reside near Manila in the Philippines. Cali is single and works in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nGabriela (“Bingo”) Maria Cristina Barredo Borromeo is married to Silverio Berenguer and has three children named Tomas “Tom” Borromeo Berenguer, Ramon Borromeo Berenguer and Maria Elena Borromeo Berenguer. Tom is married to Bernice Gamboa of the Gamboa family from Negros Occidental. Tom and Bernice have a baby girl named Isabella Marie Gamboa Berenguer. They also reside near Manila, where Tom is a practicing lawyer and owns a firm that does outplacing consultancy for American companies.

She remained single her entire life, and used to reside in an old home on Sikatuna Street in Cebu City, whence she operated a successful catering business.

He was aboard the passenger vessel “S/S Corregidor” which struck a mine and sunk. Domingo had been studying in Manila, and was encouraged to leave the Philippine capital due to rumors of the coming war with Japan. Tragically, this last ship out from Manila to Cebu struck an American mine and sunk with a great loss of life.\n\nThe next sibling of Marcial Borromeo y Guerrero was José Borromeo y Guerrero, who remained single and had no offspring. José Borromeo y Guerrero was followed by Carlos Borromeo y Guerrero, who married Mivela Talam de Borromeo. Carlos and Mivela had one daughter named Amelinda Talam Borromeo, who remained single and had no offspring. Carlos Borromeo y Guerrero was followed by his sister Carmen Borromeo y Guerrero. Carmen had one daughter out of wedlock who was named Amelia Guerrero Borromeo. Amelia remained single and had no offspring.

The information for this branch of the Borromeo family was kindly shared with us by Maricar Monique Borromeo Murriel.\n\nEduardo remained single and had no offspring. Corazon married and has one son named Peter Homer Borromeo Martin, who is thus my third cousin. Peter is married to Marissa Macalanda and they have five children named John Vincent Macalanda Martin, Michael Angelo Macalanda Martin, Ivan Christian Macalanda Martin, Samson Macalanda Martin and Margaret Timmy Macalanda Martin.\n\nGoing back to past generations, Vito Borromeo y Galan was a younger brother of my great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan (1847 to 1930). Vito married Juliana Evangelista de Borromeo, and they had one son named Manuel José Borromeo y Evangelista, who was thus a first cousin to my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880 to 1923). Manuel José remained single and had no children. This line thus died out, but as Vito Borromeo y Galan had an estate valued at 16 Million Pesos upon his death, he named his surviving nephews and neices and their descendants his lawful heirs. The estate exists as a legal entity to this very day, and its representatives are also on the Board of Directors of the Salud Borromeo Memorial Charity Clinic (Salud Borromeo y Reynes was the youngest sibling of my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes).\n\nCarl Ernest Borromeo Santos of Maryland, USA wrote in to our site and gave information stating that Don Vito Borromeo y Galan had one (1) biological son named (Attorney) Fortunato Borromeo who was born out of wedlock. Fortunato is the deceased grandfather of Carl Ernest Borromeo Santos. Fortunato was married and had six children – three daughters and three sons. These children are Juanita Borromeo (permanently residing in England), Maribel Borromeo (permanently residing in the USA), Elvira Borromeo Maguad (married to a Nephrologist Dr. Ruben Maguad in Cebu), Mariano Montero Borromeo, Antonino Borromeo (permanently residing in Canada) and Julian Borromeo. Carl Ernest Borromeo Santos has one older brother named Christopher “Chris” Evangelo Borromeo Santos who works as a physical therapist in New York and one sister named Christine Marie Santos who is also a US citizen.\n\nCarl Ernest Borromeo Santos wrote into our site yet again on August 8, 2017 with further information about his branch of the extended Borromeo family of Cebu City. He has an aunt named “Lady Juanita Borromeo” who resides in the United Kingdom (UK). Juanita is a sister of Carl’s mother Maribel Borromeo Santos. Juanita was married to the late Sir Giles Gervais Tennyson d’Eyncourt, 4th Baronet (he lived from 1935-1989). Juanita thus became Lady Giles Gervais Tennyson d’Eyncourt, part of the nobility in the UK. Sir Giles and Lady Giles had one son named Sir Mark Gervais Tennyson d’Eyncourt, 5th Baronet (born in 1967). This indicates that Sir Mark is the 5th generation to carry the noble title of Baronet in his family line in the UK. Here is a link to information about Sir Mark in the Peerage of the UK:\n\nThe next sibling of Vito Borromeo y Galan was Quirino Borromeo y Galan, who remained single and had no children. Next in line was Trinidad Borromeo y Galan, who also remained single and had no offspring. The youngest sibling of my great-grandfather José Maria Borromeo y Galan (1847-1930) was Paulo Borromeo y Galan, who married Anaclita Luminario de Borromeo. Paulo and Anaclita had one son named Pedro Borromeo y Luminario, who was thus a first cousin of my late maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880-1923). Pedro remained single and had no children.\n\nThis completes all of the Borromean lines of my third cousins.\n\nFourth Cousins\n\nMy great-great grandfather Maximo Borromeo y Feliz (1820-1892) fathered the so-called “fat” line of Cebuano Borromeos. In the Cebuano language, they are known as the “mga tambok” Borromeos. Tatay Maximo was the eldest of two sons of my great-great-great grandparents Carlos Borromeo IV y Felis (born 1795) and Maria Tupas de Borromeo. Maximo’s younger brother Florentino Borromeo y Feliz fathered the so-called “thin” line of Cebuano Borromeos. In the Cebuano language, they are known as the “mga daut” or the “mga niwang” Borromeos. The great-great grandchildren of Florentino Borromeo are thus my fourth degree cousins. I do not know the name of Florentino’s wife, although her surname was “Rosa.”\n\nIt is interesting to note here that the “thin” Borromeo line from Cebu intermarried with their cousins from both the “thin” and “stout” Borromeo lines from Cavite on Luzon (settled there in 1744) and from Iloilo on Panay (settled there in 1769). The “thin” Borromeos of Cebu City are my 4th degree cousins, whereas the Borromeos of Iloilo are my 6th degree cousins and the Borromeos of Cavite are my 7th degree cousins – thanks for this information go to Freddie Borromeo of Makati.\n\nFlorentino Borromeo y Feliz and his wife had two sons and one daughter, named Juan Borromeo y Rosa, Florentino Borromeo y Rosa and Baldomera Borromeo y Rosa.\n\nJuan Borromeo y Rosa was married to Paulina Veloso de Borromeo, and they had sixteen (16) children. This is the largest family I know of on any side of my family. These sixteen children were thus second cousins of my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880-1923). They were named Dr. Angleo Borromeo y Veloso (an attending physician upon my grandfather’s deathbed in January 1923), Father Rodolfo Pedro Casto Borromeo y Veloso (a Roman Catholic Priest), Luis Borromeo y Veloso (both a merchant and a Vaudeville Pianist), Juan Borromeo y Veloso, Jr., Catalino Borromeo y Veloso (a Roman Catholic Subdeacon), Dr. José Maria Borromeo y Veloso, Judge Fortunato Borromeo y Veloso, Ramon Borromeo y Veloso (a civil engineer), Antonio Borromeo y Veloso, Guadaloupe Borromeo y Veloso, Rosario Borromeo y Veloso, Dr. Juan Luis Borromeo y Veloso, Carmen Borromeo y Veloso, Vicente Borromeo y Veloso and two final siblings who died in infancy.\n\nDr. Angelo Borromeo y Veloso was born in 1880, did not marry and had no offspring.

He was a lawyer by profession who was named to be a Judge of the Court of First Intance, just like my maternal grandfather Judge Andrés Borromeo y Reynes (1880-1923), who was his second cousin.
