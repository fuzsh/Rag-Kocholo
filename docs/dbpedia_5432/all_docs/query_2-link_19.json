        "text": "Filipino actor\n\nBernardo “Narding” Anzures (1928–1949) was a Filipino film actor and convicted murderer.\n\nThe son of actors Miguel Anzures and Rosa Aguirre, Anzures had starred in pre–World War II films as a child actor under Sampaguita Pictures & LVN Pictures. After the war, he was paired with Lilian Velez in three films produced by Filippine Films & Philippine Pictures Inc., such as Binibiro Lamang Kita, Ang Estudyante, and Sa Kabukiran which was directed by Velez's husband, Jose Climaco.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Notes 1947 Sa Kabukiran Philippine Pictures Inc., also being composed by his former on-screen partner's father, Manuel Velez; and also his last film appearance with Lilian Velez as his on-screen partner 1947 Ang Estudyante Philippine Pictures Inc., his second film appearance with Lilian Velez 1946 Death March Philippine Pictures Inc. 1941 Binibiro Lamang Kita Filippine Films, first being paired with Lilian Velez as his first on-screen partner 1941 Binatillo LVN Pictures, final appearance with his father, Miguel Anzures 1940 Bahaghari Filippine Films, last appearance with his mother, Rosa Aguirre 1940 Gunita Filippine Films 1940 Inang Pulot Filippine Films 1939 Ang Magsasampaguita Sampaguita Pictures 1938 Ang Batang Tulisan Filippine Films 1937 Ilaw ng Langit Filippine Films 1937 Taong Demonyo Filippine Films\n\nMurder of Lilian Velez\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1948, LVN Pictures decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez's leading man in her next picture. After a dispute regarding the decision, at about 1:00 am on June 27, 1948, Anzures barged into the home of Velez in Quezon City and stabbed her and a housemaid to death in front of Velez's daughter Vivian and another housemaid. After the incident, Anzures fled to Santa Cruz, Laguna, where he surrendered a few days later.[1]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nAt his trial, Anzures pled insanity, claiming to have been under a \"fantastic spell\" when he committed the crime, but eventually pled guilty on July 19, 1949. He was sentenced to two sentences of life imprisonment and was ordered to pay P5,000 each to the relatives of his victims, but was later pardoned by President Elpidio Quirino. He died from tuberculosis shortly after his release; his exact motives for the killings were never determined.[1]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1995 film The Lilian Velez Story, Filipino actor Cesar Montano played the role of Narding Anzures, who murdered actress singer Lilian Velez, which was played by the Sharon Cuneta. It was directed by Carlo J. Caparas and co-produced by Golden Lion Films and Viva Entertainment.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
