        "text": "By Lilian Velez and Mattie Zautner, Current Staff\n\nThe music program at West Bend High Schools is experiencing a new era.\n\nSeth Matuszak and David Pecsi are the new faces of the music department. Matuszak teaches orchestra while Pecsi teaches choir, and as new teachers, they have been learning right along with the students as the year continues. Now that each has a concert or two under the belt, they are thinking about combining the skills of the choir and orchestra for some of the upcoming shows.

I was so shocked. You never think you’re going to be the one to win,” Schultz said.\n\nEven with all of her success, Katelyn does have an everyday obstacle: She was born without depth perception, making sports like volleyball and basketball difficult to play. Continue reading →\n\nBy Alina Prahl, Current Staff\n\nGabbie Becker again flipped over the Trump magnet on the fridge, much to her mother’s chagrin.\n\nAs with the country as a whole, the 2016 presidential election has divided the Becker family. Gabbie, an East senior, has reservations but prefers Hillary Clinton, while her mom, Paula, a West Bend real estate agent, plans to vote for Donald Trump. Continue reading →\n\nWest senior is headed to the seminary\n\nBy Hannah Bensen, Editor in Chief\n\nIt’s the question that many high schoolers are asked to consider at some point in their lives: What do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nThis question is often met with ambiguous and uncertain answers, but for West senior Max Rettler, the answer is clear. He wants to become a priest. Continue reading →"
