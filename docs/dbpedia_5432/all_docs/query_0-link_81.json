        "text": "The project in its original title \"A Preliminary Selected and Annotated Discography of Existing Recorded Art Music by Filipino Artists in the Philippines from 1910 - 1946\" was initially conceived when the Cultural Center of the Philippines commissioned this researcher last year to collate materials, including pictures, for the commemorative web site of the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra. This researcher discovered quite a substantial amount of significant and memorable pictures of various performing artists who have performed at the National Theater. However, pictures only portray the visual aspects of the glory of performances. Critic's reviews chronicle in vivid details an account of the performances. Neither picture nor chronicles can capture the spirit of a performance. Nothing could have completed the picture than a recording of a performance or an actual broadcast frozen in recorded form. This researcher thru an article published by the Philippine Daily Inquirer discovered the collection of Mr. Vera Cruz. The collector, a septuagenarian, was worried that his collection shall be totally forgotten in oblivion. Likewise, this is a particular concern of this researcher. The collection shall be the starting point of a rediscovery of a cultural heritage that every Filipino should rediscover and be proud of. This researcher aims to address the urgency of collating existing Filipino recordings that have survived the ravages of time and oblivion. The first recording ever of Filipino music was done in 1906 in Louisiana, USA by musicologist France Desmore. These were not included because these recordings were done in the context of musicological research as sound samplings. (Played were the indigenous instruments, which were on display at the United States of America at that time. The said recordings and musical instruments were later donated to the Smithsonian Institute.) Much of the cultural heritage of the Philippine musical world has to be literally unearthed from the dustbins of collectors and brought into their proper place in Philippine Music History- that of recognition. Many of these Filipino artists’ recordings have been mentioned in the annals of Philippine Cultural History. The recovery and rediscovery of these recordings’ existence could give our present and future generations a new perspective into the glorious years of pre-1946 cultural and artistic environment. When I commenced teaching music history courses, there was an enormous amount of frustration involved when I started describing the works of musical masters without the benefit of listening to the musical example. I compared it analogous to describing the heavenly delight of eating a Chocolate Devil Cake without the benefit of tasting the cake itself. Even if one is to describe the cake with all its ingredients and an explanation of the whole baking process, the description does not suffice. Even if a nice color photo is brought, the visual aid still does not suffice. The same holds true with the many historical accounts of Philippine Music History, a vast amount of cultural artifacts exists but the historical descriptions of this rich cultural heritage seems like cold facts or just plain romantic thoughts of ages that has gone by."
