        "text": "CPMers are no longer googling, they are anthropologically excavating the references of Tito Sotto.\n\n“Ahhha look what I found! Tito bought Diane pills in 1975 from European black market before being approved for international marketing in Germany for his severe facial acne problem and Helen surreptitiously ate them for contraception. Kaya pala ganoon ang title ng noontime show nila. Na- EAT BULAGA si Helen!”\n\nSenator Tito Sotto claims the pill that caused his son’s death in 1975 was called Diane. However, the said pill was sold only to the public 3 years after.\n\nhttp://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?articleid=839048\n\nSOTTO: “Diane po ang pangalan ng pills na ginamit ng aking asawa noon.” (referring to 1974 when his wife used pills alleged to cause the death of his son 1975 ).\n\nAccording to the manufacturer’s website Bayer Pharma, Diane was introduced 1978.\n\nhttp://www.bayerpharma.com/en/company/history/index.php\n\nWho do we believe now?!\n\nHe claimed his son’s death was due to contraceptive use by his wife 37 years ago. Although the contraceptive he mentioned was not manufactured until 3 years later, 34 years ago to be exact, but it was also manufactured for acne treatment, not for contraceptive use then.\n\nDiane was manufactured by Schering Plough, Germany pharmaceuticals in the seventies. It was originally promoted for acne treatment.\n\n“Diane-35 is a medicine, manufactured by Schering that, according to BirthControl.com, contains a combination of cyproterone and ethinyl estradiol. Cyproterone is a type of antiandrogen, which means it prevents the effect of many sex hormones. Ethinyl estradiol is an estrogen-like drug that can help prevent pregnancy and help with acne. According to CHealth, Diane 35 is marketed for acne treatment, but BirthControl.com reports that the drug can be used as birth control. In either case, use of the drug may expose patients to various side effects.”\n\nSource: http://www.livestrong.com/article/108291-side-effects-diane-birth-control/\n\nLet us say Tito bought the pills from the black market. How did it exist when it wasn’t even manufactured until 1978 nga? At that time, malamang it was at the final stages of clinical trials. Mas mahigpit kung clinical trials. That means the pills were produced according to how much was needed. Diane-35 was first licensed for use in 1984. And, at that time, only in Europe.\n\nPaano siya nakakuha nun? Hmm, perhaps Sotto invented it in 1975?\n\nWOW! So we not only have a COMEDIAN/SENATOR EH! We got a huge bargain: a COMEDIAN-SENATOR CUM MEDICINE FORMULATORWHATEVER! HOORAY!!!!\n\nSotto, thanks for Diane-35… Maybe you also invented Diane-Sawyer? Hehehe!\n\nOr perhaps the Filipinos were made into guinea pigs and dumping grounds of those pills and injectibles before it was finalized to be commercially released.\n\nA more logical explanation: The senatorial sperm must have a time machine & traveled from 1975 to 1978 just to buy Diane. Ayos! Bilib talaga ako kay Tito Escalera pagdating sa kalokohan at kabobohan!\n\nWhy not send a copy of his speech against the oral contraceptive at Bayer directly and let us see what they will say.\n\nSotto: “Why should you believe in Bayer? Bayer lang yun! Mas bilib ako sa Generics!”\n\nSotto: “I am not quoting Schering or Bayer or Merck o Kung ano mang pharma company. I am quoting Diane!”\n\nAs expected hindi kasi pwede ganun-ganun lang yun na sisisihin mo ang isang pill sa pagkamatay ng anak mo without any concrete evidence but just your story.\n\nAng hirap ng nagsisinungaling! Ika nga, however you hide it, the TRUTH will come out.\n\nAs the Bubble Gang people would shout: BOOM!!!\n\nShowbiz kasi. Tabloid evidence lang ang naiintindihan. Senador na ayaw pang gamitin ang utak. Mapilit lang false accusation nila. Eh nagkalat din naman sa Internet ang years of scientific research proving na walang significant health hazards ang paggamit ng pills. Pati posisyon ng WHO kontrahin din. Eh simpleng simple, magtanong kaya sila sa kahit sinong OB. Mas magaling raw kasi sila. Lalo na mga writers nya. Mga timaw na makasarili at manloloko pa.\n\nSotto, or his staff, should do more research. Actually there are already new, health-boosting birth control pills like Charlize, a low-dose pill with Ferrous Fumarate (that’s iron) good for women with dysmenorrhea or irregular menstrual bleeding. For beauty-conscious women who battle with monthly PMS acne will be glad to know that more affordable pill brands that help clear skin are available like Althea. Take note, it also aids in preventing cancers like ovarian and endometrical cancer, and can be used as a treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\nRemember, ask your doctor first. (para po kay Tito Sotto ang message na ito)\n\n*credits to the Filipino critics"
