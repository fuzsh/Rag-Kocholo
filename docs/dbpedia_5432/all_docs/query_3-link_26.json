        "text": "WILMINGTON — Ricardo Velez, born on July 17, 1987, in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, and raised in New Haven, Connecticut, has left us on January 9, 2024. He was a loving father, son, brother, uncle, and friend who will be deeply missed by all who knew him.\n\nRicardo’s journey in life was filled with love and cherished moments. He moved to Wilmington, North Carolina with Melissa Kellogg, with whom he raised two beautiful children, Ricardo Velez and Cameron Kellogg. Ricardo’s dedication and love for his children were unmatched. He found immense joy in spending quality time with them and being a loving father.\n\nOne of Ricardo’s greatest passions was fishing. Whenever he had the chance, he would grab his fishing gear and head out to the water. Fishing brought him a sense of peace and tranquility, and it was a hobby that he truly loved.\n\nRicardo was a beloved son, and he leaves behind his mother, Lillian Mejias (Edgar Nieves), and his father, Ricardo Velez (Sonia Crespo). Ricardo’s family was his rock, and he cherished the bond he had with them.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Ricardo is survived by his four sisters: Jessica Velez, Bonni Bell Velez, Veronica Velez, and Lilybeth Johnson. He was a loving uncle to his four nieces: Lilliany Mendez, Jizelle Dewitt, Analiyah Velez, and Primrose Orellana. He also had four nephews: Luis Nuñez, Cesar Mendez, Elijah Velez, and Emanuel Nuñez, who was also his godson. Ricardo’s family extended beyond blood relations, as he had many uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends who held a special place in his heart.\n\nRicardo’s passing has left a void in the lives of those who loved him dearly. As we mourn his loss, we find solace in the memories we shared and the love he bestowed upon us. Ricardo’s spirit will forever live on in our hearts.\n\nAquamation services have been entrusted to Tranquility Cremation by Aquamation. A celebration of Ricardo’s life will be held at a later date, and we encourage everyone to check back often for updates. Let us come together to honor and remember the beautiful soul that Ricardo Velez was."
