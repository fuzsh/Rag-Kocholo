        "text": "In this day and age, pop music dominates the airwaves at every turn. Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and many are commonplace names among teenagers and younger demographics. They already forgot the songs where they belong… like the old song songs or folk song which seriously relate to human lives. Yes, I also appreciate modern songs but these folk song make us reflect the lives of the people before the booming of technology. Everything in the present are caused by innovation. Innovations or let’s just say technology hinders our appreciation to our own cultures. This time I’ll share to all of you the Cebuano folk songs with their corresponding english translation written and composed by creative indigenous people in Cebu.\n\nThe wide repertoire of Visayan songs includes ballads, lullabies, harana (serenade), children’s\n\nsongs, working songs, drinking songs, nonsense songs, and a lively song-and-dance debate called\n\nbalitaw.\n\nAko anak ni Tatay,\n\nAko ra’y puti ug diyutay;\n\nPanahon sa kagabhion,\n\nAko ra’y makita dayon.\n\n(I’m my father’s son,\n\nFairer than anyone;\n\nWhen it’s nighttime,\n\nI’m the easiest to see.)\n\nAko anak ni Tatay,\n\nAko ra’y buotan ug diyutay;\n\nPanahon sa tingpamuklay,\n\nAko ra’y makapahulay.\n\n(I’m my father’s son,\n\nBetter behaved than anyone;\n\nWhen it’s time to till the field,\n\nOnly I may rest.)\n\nAko anak ni Tatay,\n\nAko ra’y guapo ug diyutay;\n\nPanahon sa tingpamiesta,\n\nAko ra’y duna’y korbata.\n\n(I’m my father’s son,\n\nHandsomer than anyone;\n\nWhen it’s fiesta time,\n\nOnly I have a tie to wear.)\n\nGlossary\n\nanak – child; son or daughter\n\nputi – fair-complexioned; white\n\ndiyutay – a little bit\n\npanahon – time; weather\n\nkagabhion – night; evening\n\nmakita – to be seen\n\ndayon – immediately; soon\n\nbuotan – well-behaved; well-bred\n\npamuklay – tilling the field; plowing\n\npahulay – rest\n\nguapo – handsome; good-looking\n\npiyesta – fiesta; merrymaking\n\nduna, aduna – to have\n\nkorbata – necktie\n\nIlo nga Bata (A little orphan)\n\nAko ang ilo nga bata,\n\nKang Nanay nga pinalangga;\n\nUgaling kay biniyaan,\n\nNiining kalibutan.\n\n(I am a little orphan,\n\nMother had cared for me;\n\nBut now I’m all alone,\n\nAnd the w hole w orld has left me.)\n\nGlossary:\n\nilo – orphan\n\nbata – child; young boy or girl\n\nNanay – an endearing term for mother\n\npinalangga – loved; doted on; cared for\n\nugaling – however; but\n\nbiniyaan – abandoned; cast off\n\nniini – here; in this place or situation\n\nkalibutan – the world; the earth\n\nPakitong-kitong\n\nTong, tong, tong, tong, pakitong-kitong,\n\nAlimango sa suba gibantog dili makuha;\n\nAko ra’y makakuha,\n\nAko ra’y makasuwa.\n\n(Tong, tong, tong, tong, pakitong-kitong\n\nCrab of the river that none has caught yet;\n\nOnly I can get,\n\nOnly I can eat.)\n\nGlossary:\n\nalimango – crab\n\nsuba – river; stream\n\ngibantog – famous; known; reputed to be\n\ndili – no; not; negative\n\nkuha – to get\n\nsuwa – to eat (viand)\n\nSi Pelimon\n\nSi Pelimon, si Pelimon\n\nNamasol sa kadagatan;\n\nNakakuha, nakakuha\n\nUg isdang tambasakan;\n\nGibaligya, gibaligya\n\nSa merkadong guba;\n\nAng halin pulos kura, ang halin pulos kura\n\nIgo lang gipanuba.\n\n(Pelimon w ent to sea to catch some fish;\n\nWhat did he catch?\n\nA small mudskipper;\n\nHe sold it at a rickety market;\n\nFor it he w as paid kura,\n\nJust enough to buy tuba.)\n\nGlossary\n\npasol – to catch fish; to fish by hook-and-line\n\nkadagatan – the open sea\n\nkuha – to get; to catch\n\nisda – fish\n\nisdang tambasakan – mudskipper\n\nbaligya, ibaligya – to sell\n\nmerkado – market\n\nguba – broken down; run-down; rickety\n\nhalin – revenue; income from sale\n\npulos – entirely; wholly\n\nkura – fake money; money circulated during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines\n\ntuba – a popular drink fermented from the sap of the coconut tree\n\nipanuba – to spend one’s money on tuba\n\nAko kini si Angi (My name is Angi)\n\nAko kini si Angi,\n\nAng opisyo ko’y panahi;\n\nAdlaw ug gabii\n\nKanunay ako nagtahi.\n\n(My name is Angi\n\nAnd I sew for a living;\n\nDay and night I sew\n\nAnd sew without rest.)\n\nBisan nako’g unsaon,\n\nWala’y kuwartang matigum,\n\nKay ang akong pagpanahi\n\nIgo ra’s panginabuhi.\n\n(No matter how I try\n\nI can’t have any savings;\n\nFor w hat I get from sew ing\n\nIs just enough to survive.)\n\nGlossary:\n\nkini- this\n\nopisyo- occupation; job\n\ntahi – to sew\n\npanahi – the act of sewing\n\nadlaw – day\n\ngabii – night\n\nkanunay – always; ever; all the time; ceaselessly\n\nbisan – however; no matter how\n\nnako – me; my; mine\n\nunsaon – to try to do; to try to achieve\n\nwala – nothing; none\n\nkuwarta – money\n\ntigum – to save; to accumulate\n\nkay because; on account of\n\nigo – enough; sufficient\n\npanginabuhi – means of livelihood; means survival\n\nTrue aesthetic beauty can be found regardless of the form of art presented, so long as perspective is relative to the individual observing it. Since only only knew few folks songs, but still I love it because it reminds me of my childhood years. Folk music may not be as widespread or pervasive as many other genres, but the simplistic styles, calming melodies, and gorgeous lyrics will always provide the perfect connection between soul and music.\n\nAs early as seven in the morning, during an ordinary workday, the speed of trucks that sends the streets to convulsion and the drowsy pace of pedestrians ambling in their search for good breakfast would not prevent one or two individuals to grab the microphone from the nearest videoke and belt out songs by Parokya ni Edgar. They could effectively send many wincing with aural pain, but they are better (in an amusing way, that is) than a rooster’s call that is practically useless under the metal-bonging cacophony of the leisurely moving garbage truck.\n\nFilipinos love to sing. Singing is not reserved to videokes or to concerts. We sing wherever, whenever we want—inside stuffy jeepneys, at work, over the phone, at any special occasion, even during heartaches, over baptisms and burials, reunions, and under the shower (or on the toilet, distasteful as that thought may incur). In fact, we have long been singing, way before Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his mob came to the Philippines, as historical records show. This guy named Antonio Pigafetta, a scholar, mentioned about hearing a gong-drum ensemble in Cebu. And when this foreign troupe did land and made themselves comfortable, Filipinos—dangerously pliant as we are—rapidly assimilated to Spanish practices with the upper Filipino class belting out Andalucía songs, strumming the harp, and gyrating to Spanish music.\n\nOver the years, despite the arrival of two more foreign mobs crusting our pliant personalities, we managed to produce some good songs played in phonographs and aired over the radio. Up to now, every Sundays, we hear wistful songs like Ben Zubiri’s “Matud Nila” (1941), Minggoy Lopez’s “Rosas Pandan” (1938), and Manuel Velez’s “Sa Kabukiran” (1941). This, while during the rest of the days, we hear Western songs with a “dance-able” beat but…what is that song all about? We also hear songs many people could barely understand, save for an English line during chorus repeatedly (sometimes angrily) piped with, uh, um, distinct sense of, er, difficulty. And still, we keep hearing almost the same set of old Cebuano songs every Sundays over the radio. While we exalt them in the kingdom of glory, where are the new good Cebuano songs that our own kids will be able to glorify, too, when we reach Pilita Corales’ current age?\n\nNow, let’s open the curtain for Vispop, the Visayan Pop Songwriting Campaign that challenges Cebuano songwriters to produce songs that can “break into current radio airplay…that have both a hook and a heart…that are radio-friendly, and yet are also substantial in their theme and approach”. As a campaign, it aims to alleviate the current state of Cebuano music (or perhaps the lack thereof?) on the radio by infusing into our airwave system a “more professional and competitive playlist of new Cebuano songs”. Vispop is organized by Artist Ko or Artists & Musicians Marketing Cooperative led by its core team Ian Zafra (songwriter/music producer from the band Sheila & The Insects), Cattski Espina (singer/songwriter/music producer), Jude Gitamondoc (composer/music producer) and Lorenzo “Insoy” Niñal (songwriter/music producer and frontman of the band Missing Filemonin cooperation with the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.\n\nSo after rounding up groups and schools and getting 80 entries, Vispop selected six finalists who battled each other’s vocal cords out last May 18 at the Benedicto College Artists Hall. They were Marianne Dungog and Kyle Wong with “Balay Ni Mayang”, Paterno Niñal with “Hinaut”, Alphecca Perpetua with “Historias”, Marie Maureen Salvaleon with “Pa-Pictura Ko Nimo, Gwapo”, Lourdes Maglinte with “Laylay” and Jewel and Joe Villaflores with “Duyog.” Jewel and Joe won first place; Lourdes at the second; and Marian and Kyle made it to the third spot. Congratulations!\n\nBig thanks to Vispop and the team behind it, we are getting the new local sound we can be proud of, something that is certainly not barat and bakya. It’s true that Filipinos, or in this case the Cebuanos, love to sing. It’s just a matter of having more new really good Cebuano material we can belt out.\n\nRarely can a Visayan be found, “unless he is sick, who ceases to sing except when he is asleep”- thus remarked 17th century Jesuit chronicler Francisco Alzina on the prodigious activity of Visayans in the field of music. He noted, with much amazement, not only the fact that Visayans seemed to be singing all the time but that they played musical instruments with such dexterity, they could-by just playing such instruments as the kudyapi (guitar of lute) and korlong (fiddle)- “speak and make love to one another” ((Alzina 1668, III:64, 678-69).\n\nThe field of Visayan and Cebuano music is vast. This is indicated by the array of native musical instruments in the Visayas, which include percussion tubes called bayog and karatong, drums called guimbal and tugo, ribbon reeds called pasyok and turutot, lutes or buktot, violins or litguit, jew’s harp or subing, clarinets or lantoy, flutes of tulali (Takacs 1975:126-27). Ubiquitous too was vocal music since songs called ambahan, awit, or biyao were sung for many purposes and occasions. Songs included saloma (sailor songs), hila, hele, holo, and hia (work songs), dayhuan (drinking songs), kandu (epic songs), kanogon (dirges), tirana (debate songs), the balitao romansada (song form of the balitao) as well as religious chants, courtship and wedding songs, lullabies and children’s songs, and songs that accompanied various types of dances ad performances.\n\nSpanish colonial rule exposed Visayans to Western music traditions. Alzina (1668, III: 66) notes that in the 17th century Visayans could already play Spanish musical instruments with “notable skill.” The Spanish guitar called sista in Cebuano, superseded indigenous string instruments akin to it and became so popular that the Visayas, particularly Cebu, has acquired a reputation not only for guitar players but for the manufacture of fine guitars. Other instruments, like the alpa (harp), also became widely diffused in the Visayas.\n\nThe Spaniards also introduced the Christmas carol called dayegon and a more Latin touch to the serenade or harana. Catholic liturgical music and associated religious songs also became an important part of the music tradition of the Visayas. Little is now known of Cebuano composers of early liturgical music and no adequate study has been undertaken on the adaptation of this music to the Visayas or of its influence on secular music in the region. While there was a tendency towards rigidification in liturgical practices in the Spanish period, artistic cross-fertilization undoubtedly took place. After all, the early missionary accounts themselves frequently cite how the Spanish missionaries appropriated native songs and reformed their content to facilitate the communication of new messages. At the very least, Catholic liturgy- with the important role played in it by songs and chants- nourished the native passion for music. American rule also introduced new musical influence into the Visayas, particularly through the public schools, the stage (as in case of vaudeville or bodabil), the phonograph, movies and radio.\n\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a flowering of Cebuano music composition. A major factor was the rise of Cebuano theater in the early 1900s, with the sarswela or musical play as the most popular dramatic form. Hence, there was a demand for music-and-song performances. Teatro Junquera (later Oriente) in Cebu City showed Cebuano sarswela and Spanish zarzuelas, Italian opera, and American-style bodabil in the early 1900s. Plays by Buenaventura Rodriguez and Florentino Borromeo were staged with a complement of as large as a 32-member orchestra. Off-theater, there were open-air plays staged in Visayan villages as well as neighborhood performances of the Cebuano balitao. Then, one must also consider that, beginning with the Spanish period, the social calendar was filled with religious festivities that created occasions for musical performances. Hence, it was a standard for a town, and even many barrios, to have a local orchestra or band.\n\nIn later years, Cebuano movies and radio programs also stimulated the creativity of composers and performers. The 20th century saw the advent of the music recording industry in the Philippines. In the 1920s and 1930s, Cebuano songs and singers were recorded on phonograph discs. In 1929 for instance, the premier Cebuano singer of the time, Conception Cananea, had already cut 27 songs for Disko Odeon while her husband, composer Manuel Velez, had 12 songs recorded. (Velez also owned at this time the Santa Cecilia music Store in Cebu City, which sold musical intruments, sheets, and phonographs). In 1931 there was an Odeon Palace in Cebu City selling phonograph records of compositions by Velez, Brigido, Lakandazon, Piux Kabahar, Hermenegildo Solon, Rafael Gandiongco, Ben Zubiri, Domingo Lopez, and Tomas Villaflor. Lakandazon, a Tagalog who married a Cebuana and settled down in Carcar, Cebu, was an all-round music man who played several instruments, acted as local bandmaster and music teacher, and composed music for Cebuano sarswela.\n\nSongs composed during this period included “Sa Kabukiran” (In the Mountains) by M. Velez, with lyrics by Jose Galicano, “Rosas Pandan” and “Kamingaw sa Payag” (Loneliness of the Heart) by Domingo Lopez, “Salilang” and “Dalagang Pilipinhon” (Filipino Lady) by Celestino Rodriguez, “Wasaywasay” by Piux Kabahar, “Aruy-aruy” by Tomas Villaflor, “Garbosong Bukid” by Hermenegildo Solon, and “Mutya sa Buhat” (Pearl of Labor) by Rafael Gandiongco. The prolific character of the prewar and immediate postwar period can be inferred from the large number of Cebuano composers: Vicente Rubi, Emiliano Gabuya, S. Alvarez Villarino, Diosdado Alferez, Manual Villareal, Dondoy Villalon, Vicente Kiyamko, Estanislao Tenchavez, Ramon Abellana, and the Cabase brothers (Siux, Sencio, Narding, and Mane). In addition, Cebu produced excellent performers and singers: the couple Manuel and Concepcion Cananea-Velez and their daughter, Lilian Velez, Eulalia Hernandez, Teodora Siloria, Presing Dakoykoy, Pablo Virtuoso, and Pilita Corrales.\n\nIn time, the growing dominance of Western music and the promotion of Tagalog music (favored by the fact that Manila is the capital art and entertainment) eclipsed Cebuano music composition. Musical activity, however, has remained active in Cebu through the work of such composers, teachers, and performers as Pilar B. Sala, Rodolfo E. Villanueva, Ingrid Sala-Santamaria, and the Cebu Symphony Orchestra. Promotional activities by such groups as the Cebu Arts Council, Cultural and Historical Affairs Commission, Cebu Arts Foundation, Cebu Popular Music Festival which has done notable work in encouraging Cebuano composition of popular songs, and local music schools and radio stations have encouraged composition and performance in Cebu. There are indications that Cebuano music composition may again be entering a new energetic phase in its history.\n\nThe first time I have heard of and visited the JRG Halad Museum, a museum “where Cebuano musical heritage comes alive” (the museum’s tagline), was in 2012. But this museum has been around since 2010. I remember I wasn’t hiding under a rock then, how come I did not know about it until 2012? Maybe I should go out more. And maybe you should, too. The museum is a tribute (halad is Cebuano for tribute) to Cebuano music. It tells about some Visayan music artists and Cebuano 20th century composers. What I liked best about this museum is that it has listening stations where you can listen to some old Cebuano music through modern means: a laptop or an mp3 player. The museum also has phonographs, vinyl records, radios, and musical instruments on display.\n\nJRG Halad Museum is a musically-themed museum in Cebu City, Philippines that pays homage to the musical heritage of Cebu. It is located along V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) and D. Jakosalem St. Cebu City, the old building of The Freeman Newspaper has been converted to a museum which houses Cebuano and Visayan musical treasures and memorabilia. Halad Museum was founded by Jose “Dodong” R. Gullas, the Halad Museum was inaugurated on January 12, 2010 and opened to the public on February 2, 2010. With the founder’s support, reviving works of long forgotten composers was achieved via concerts of an award winning university-based choir, the UV Chorale of which the first of the Halad concerts came about in 2007 wherein a group of composers were honored posthumously including Ben Zubiri, composer of Matud Nila, and Vicente Rubi, composer of Kasadya Ning Taknaa. This started the donations of family members of the honorees for the three Halad concerts (in 2007, 2008 and 2010) [2] from lyric sheets to instruments, prompting the idea of a repository—a museum. Eventually, the founder was inspired to actively acquire other musical memorabilia, not just to keep the memory of the honorees alive, but also hopefully, to educate youngsters on how rich Cebu’s musical heritage is.\n\nIn November 2010, expansion of the museum was carried out to make more room for the increasing collections held by the museum which includes memorabilia of Cebuano composers and artists in the 20th century, from musical instruments, lyric sheets to long-playing records. The revamped and completed Halad Museum was opened to the public in June 13, 2011 with more musical pieces on exhibit. The museum features three galleries dedicated to Cebuano music, kinaiyang Sugbuanon (Cebuano cultural traditions), and the founder’s gallery. The JRG Halad Museum pays tribute to the enduring legacies of Cebuano cultural heritage as expressed through music. It envisions itself to be recognized as an experience of Cebuano music, performing arts, cultural heritage and research exhibitions that enrich the quality of life and build a better future for generations to come.\n\nThe Halad Music Gallery displays composers from the 20th century who have produced timeless Cebuano songs, as well as artists who have earned international recognition for their talents. Highlights include original music sheets and musical instruments played by the composers themselves and numerous awards and personal items from gowns to gadgets owned by the artists. Turntables and digital music stations are also available for visitors.\n\nThe musical memorabilia plus instruments occupy the main section of the museum, but with its recent expansion, it is now home to other interests. The Kinaiyang Sugbuanon section showcases the Cebuano traditions over time including life-cycle events, popular practices and expressions of religiosity in the different artworks depicted. Another gallery is devoted to the founder who pays tribute to the most influential people in his life, his parents and his living commitment to heritage preservation.\n\nOne thing Cebuanos and Visayans in general are remarkable for is their culturally rich and diverse music. Traditional music of the Visayas generally fits into a classification described by Philippine musicologists as indigenous Hispanic music of the Christianized lowlands. (Maceda 1963) Trimillos refines this particular classification (which is only one part of his overall musical typology) in a slightly different way as “Hispanised musics based upon indigenous forms or traditions.” (Trimillos 1972) This precludes influences assimilated during the American regime starting at the turn of the 20th century. Ragtime, jazz (boogie-woogie), country western, rock and roll, disco, etc., infiltrate almost all folk repertories at some point. Traditional music in Cebu City, and even some Church music, is subsumed by contemporary, globally influenced, popular musical genres. Traditional extant Hispanised music found now is mainly in rural provincial areas or in urban areas where probinsyanos (urban term for rural dwellers) live.\n\nBy the 17th century, introduced Hispanic musical instruments, such as the harp, guitar, violin, various bandurria types (flat backed mandolins), bass viol, organ, clarinets, trumpets, flutes and other instruments became popular and displaced most pre-Hispanic instruments once used. The Filipino harp is definitely an offspring of a European prototype. Christianized indigenous populations absorbed European music and musical instruments rapidly taking them on as their own, but often in their own fashion.\n\nIn Cebu and many areas of the Philippines, older musical traditions offer an interesting contrast to contemporary popular commercial genres readily available in television, radio, and recorded media. Regionalistic fervor for linguistic distinction, nevertheless, is still strong. The language format of almost all local radio stations in Cebu is Cebuano-Bisayan. Bisayan radio stations play various contemporary styles of music, like, jazz, popular, rock and roll.\n\nThe Cebuanos also have folk songs aptly depicting the local life of the region. Remember children singing “Pakitongkitong” or “Si Pilemon” while at play. Then neighbors would relax and farmers would take a break to sing or whistle songs, such as “Ang Lungsod sa Buenavista”. Songs were sung for a variety of reasons and occasions. Cebuanos have a number of laylay (lullabies), occupational songs, balitaw (debate songs), harana (love and courtship songs) and even drinking songs. All songs tell a story, whether sad, anxious, or happy. In addition, for these folk songs, nobody could tell who sang them first. It seemed all were born with a song in their hearts. The traditional Bisayan form of the folk song genre called is harana. The harana, though still popular with the older population tends to be losing ground to modern “progressive” tastes. Harana is usually slow and sad, a heartfelt love song which is verbally expressive. Typically, the traditional harmonic progression alternates between a major and minor tonality (usually parallel, but sometime relative), common to many Hispanic influenced music genres found in the Philippines.\n\nVery popular in both rural and urban areas are radio soap operas, usually presented in the vernacular language of the region. Certain songs presented through these soap operas become quite popular, infiltrating folk music repertories and may stay popular for decades, such as the song “Usahay” (“Once in a While”) in the Visayas. “Usahay” is not song just for old men and women. It is for other romantics too. Its appeal does not have as much to do with age as with loneliness, despair and rejected love. In addition, lyrics tell of being lonely and dreaming of a long-wished for love and regretting why there is still life when love is ridicule. The song “Matud Nila” in my own opinion is somewhat like a story about a girl who loves a person but the people around them were hesitant for their Love because they think that the two of them were not compatible. Though she loves the person so much, yet she is not being love back, she longs for the boys love and appreciation.\n\nIn addition, with Cebu’s music, music also performed in the Catholic Church service on Cebu is both interesting and diverse. Musical orientation is usually in a contemporary setting; the content left up to the discretion of an individual priest, and may differ from one parish to the next. Churches usually have an organ and/or a piano. Guitar sometimes accompanies the choir as well. Songs in Cebu churches are sang in Cebuano-Bisayan, some in English, rarely in Tagalog.\n\nIn a global era of foreign-induced mainstream culture, Filipinos and perhaps the Cebuano in particular, tend to veer off from their own, and easily adapt to things and thoughts Occidental, sometimes-sacrificing local identity. Thus, the need to go back and re-awaken in the Cebuano’s love of their conscious past oftentimes belatedly appreciated until someone unveils it.\n\n“Where words fail, music speaks”\n\nCertainly we can think of other functions of music –to inspire religious dedication, to express political protest, to coordinate work, to lull one’s baby to sleep and so on. Music can reinforce family ties or strengthen communities. It provides a path to meditation, exhibit devotion, or act as an inseparable component of rituals. In some cultures music is performed as entertainment for, or communication with, the divine.\n\nDespite colonial rule of more than 400 years, the entire Philippines continue to take pride in its indigenous music. Not only has indigenous music been preserved, but it has also helped enriched contemporary Philippine music, fusing with the old and the new, the original with the borrowed, the indigenous with the foreign.\n\nSpanish musical influence is mainly motivated to bring the Christian faith closer to the natives in Cebu. Songs, epics native drums and gongs were overshadowed by the Christian chants and the harmony of new Western instruments namely the organ, harp and the guitar. Unfortunately music during the arrival of the Spaniards also meant the forced eradication of ethnic music and old traditions. Performing ethnic music was highly discouraged, thus slowly disappearing, although some traditions still exist. The formal rise of liturgical music started when missionaries taught European religious music to the new Christians. The Spanish regime gave new form to the entire Philippine music in particular. During the Spanish period, music was the means of conversion by the friars. These converts proved to be good and interested in learning the plainsong, the flute, the harp, and the guitar. After fifty years since the conquest, music schools for the faith were established by the Church.\n\nSince Christianity proved to be a very powerful force in the Colonial period, the influence of Church music extended to everyday living. As a result, as an offshoot of liturgical music, extra liturgical music was born. It evolved as time passed and eventually lost its religious characteristic.\n\nThe combination of ritual music of the indigenous religion and the music of Christianity paved way for Secular music as years passed. This type music from the Spanish Colonial tradition assimilated elements of European secular genres.\n\nMusic had already been present even before Cebuano were supposedly “civilized” by the Spaniards. Cebuano, before, used different materials, such as animal skin, wood, and other organic materials to create their own musical instruments. Ethnic music in the Cebu concentrated on the different beliefs, lifestyles, and societies of the native people.\n\nWhen the Spanish came and invaded our country, ethnic music began to disappear because it was highly discouraged. Instead, Spanish colonialism gave rise to religious and liturgical music. However, the Spanish brought with them the formal education of music to those who were capable of learning them. Since music is accompanied by instruments primitive people in Cebu used strings when playing an instrument.\n\nPlaying a musical instrument is educational. Music is an exact science. According to some Cebuano, whom I asked, playing a musical instrument is personal achievement as well as contribution to the growth and development.\n\n“You can’t have the rhythm going against the text or the text going against the rhythm- they must be coalesce”\n\n-Jose Garcia Villa\n\nSome peoples in different parts of the world live under more primitive conditions than others, and in many cases the arts are beginning points. In the field of the art of sound there is great variety to be found; no two people’s music is alike, and in some cases there is much complexity. Of all the arts, music is regarded as the most universal in its appeal and acceptance.\n\nMusic plays a vital role in human society. It provides entertainment and emotional release, and it accompanies activities ranging from dances to religious ceremonies. This universality, however, does not mean music is without individual character. Each country has its own kind of music that embodies the total experience, the collective consciousness of its people. Music, therefore, is the collective expression of the musical genius of a particular people.\n\nWhile all music may have had outside influence at one time, we think of music as being primitive. Indigenous music before the colonial era was largely functional. The type of music is retained and practiced in the Philippines especially in the Visayan region. Music was deeply integrated with the activities of natives in Cebu. The ancient Cebuano had music practically for all occasions, for every phase of life, from birth to death. The understanding of Cebu ethnic music is premised on an appreciation of indigenous instruments which are used in the various ritual and secular activities of ethnic people. The diversity of ethnic musical tradition arises from several significant historical accidents.\n\nBefore, people enjoyed nature through their flora and fauna. They relished the sound of the rushing waters in the rivers, lakes and seas, occasional rains, singing of the birds, crying of animals and shouting of people were ordinary occurrences. Ethnic music in Cebu was started by different groups before. In their hunting travels, they discovered that different sounds were produced by various sources. They had songs and dances. Music was mostly monophonic. Rhythm was provided by clapping of the hands, hitting of bodies, stomping of the feet, sometimes with rattles or scraped bones attached to their bodies. Music was a never-ending stimulant and nourishment to them. Their desire to have more music was plaguing problem. In this problem, they made way to search for more instruments that can make harmonious music and played them. They need musical instruments for their magical powers, sacrificial rituals and ceremonial functions. Musical instruments had a permeating influence on the lives of primitive people. Musical tradition may mark rites of passage and life-cycle events for the early Cebuano. Endemic, these instruments served as common bonds and symbols of their culture. Manifold aspects in ritualistic ceremonies were believed to unburden their woes.\n\nThe most primitive instruments that were used by the Cebuano natives were the drum. It was used to accompany dancing and to communicate with each other. The ancients had drums which they believed to have decisive influence on their thinking. Not only drums were used before but also this big seashell or “budyong” was used by the natives in Cebu. Way back then, native Cebuano used this shell during harvest time in calling people to harvest. With the help of this instrument, people before were united because they see and make friends with each other during harvest time. This instrument was also used to warn the natives from the bad elements like those people who came from different places. The mentioned musical instruments are not the only instruments that were used in Cebu during the primitive times. Nevertheless, the ethnic music was not only made by playing instruments. Different pieces were also made by using the voices of the people. In addition of the instrumental music that was made by the groups before, vocal music was also established. Like the instruments, vocal music expresses and transmits in a concrete and vivid manner a great variety of the thoughts, beliefs, society, lifestyles, character and way of life of the native peoples.\n\nIn the 15th century, instruments were no longer made by the players but by guilds. Instruments were made from precious metals with the idea maintaining the humanistic interest in music.\n\nSuch in the case, Cebuano music today is regarded as one of the unique blending of two great musical traditions- the East and the West. The western musical tradition was introduced to the entire Philippines by the Spanish colonizers. The new musical consciousness was herald by the tolling of the church bells, which marked both the advent of a new sound among the Christianized natives and the area in which the natives contained for efficient colonial administration. Being innately musical, the Cebuano, from the earliest to contemporary times have imbibed these traditions and have woven their musical creations mainly streams of musical thought. Through time, the “queen city of the south” has witnessed the evolution of music expressed in different forms and stylistic nuances.\n\nA people gifted with strong sense of musicality, the Cebuano turn to music to express their innermost feelings. Hence, every song they sing, every instrument they play, every music they make is direct, almost spontaneous reflection of their hopes and longings, frustrations and fulfillment, failures and triumphs.\n\n” Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing.”\n\n– Rollo May\n\nCommunication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Communication is the very basis, which drives the process of development in all the fields. Today, it’s much easier to communicate with others than it was just a decade ago. We can send and receive messages instantly with a number of new technologies. This has improved our lives in many ways by allowing us to become more interconnected and knowledgeable about the world. People communicate through mobile phones, telephones and through social media sites. If we stepped into a time machine and traveled back to a moment in history that gave us a glimpse of our ancestors as they struggled but somehow managed to communicate we’d be baffled yet marveled at how far we’ve come. The history of communication began with man communicating with others like him, using oral communication that was understandable to the listener. Every day we hear or read about something new in the market that will make communicating with one another faster, better, more efficient, and above all, an experience to remember. We’ve upgraded our systems, changed our technological preferences, and convinced others in our lives to do the same, knowingly or unknowingly. The power of technology is a mammoth subject to review, but we’ve all seen it evolve and change over the years, making us appreciate the genius that man is.\n\nAt the birth of our nation there were no; emails, telephones, or printed material floating around. With these conveniences not in our reach the only tool for communication was found in between our chins and noses: our mouths. Using our mouths as the only implement for communication made things difficult. With this it took a long time for people to be informed on what was going on in the country.\n\nThe most common means of communication before was writing letters. The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. Posted letters have become less important as a routine form of communication. The stamps from the letter that they received are usually kept as souvenirs from the sender. The letter in the sender’s own writing is more personal than e-mail that we used today.\n\nThe development of the telegraph drastically shortened the time taken to send a communication, by sending it between distant points as an electrical signal. At the telegraph office closest to the destination, the signal was converted back into writing on paper and delivered to the recipient. According to some people letters were paid for by the recipient rather than the sender, and were charged according to the distance the letter had travelled and the number of sheets of paper it contained.\n\nRadio has been the first device to allow for mass communication. Radio is an important tool for the rapid diffusion of important messages. Despite the technological advances in the communication field, radio is still the most pervasive, accessible, affordable, and flexible mass medium available. Radio serves as entertainer and messenger. It delivers messages to people. From our ancestors, radios also provide emergency and public service assistance. This has been very beneficial in emergencies, saving lives in many instances.\n\nFor the time being, exchanging information, feelings in a long distance is no longer a difficult experience thank to the development of technology. In conclusion, thanks to technology, people from all corners of the world are able to communicate with each other quickly and easily. It has changed our life for the better. In the coming year, we may hope to see an even greater number of new technologies are invented. The history of modern communication is still ongoing, and will continue to progress far into the future."
