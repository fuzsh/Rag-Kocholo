        "text": "Keep going up [the ladder]. The seminar kit. :)\n\nSince I am already focused on establishing my career in the field of education, I decided to participate in the National Seminar-Workshop on Campus Journalism held last April 4-6, 2014 at Iriga Plaza Convention Center.\n\nThe main reason why I wanted to participate in the said event is that I’ve always wanted to learn how to write the way journalists do.\n\nWhen I was in my sixth year in grade school, I became a member of the school publication as one of the editorial cartoonists. I remember having no clue whatsoever on how cartooning is actually being done. I didn’t know about the rules and guidelines. Anyway, that was one embarrassing moment for me. Haha.\n\nI was never an official member of the school publication from high school to college. I was only a mere contributor. Somehow, two of my poems were published too - one when I was in high school and the other in college. But what I really want to know is how to write the journalist’s way.\n\nSo even if the theme and the topic of the seminar-workshop don’t have a direct link to my major, which is biological science, I decided to take part in it. My main purpose is for my personal improvement. The additional points for the ranking of Teachers just come second.\n\nIriga Plaza Convention Center, Iriga City. The venue of the Seminar-Workshop Days 1 and 3. :)\n\nI arrived past nine at the venue around past nine. After registration, I lurked around and familiarized myself with the place because the first session would start after lunch. I didn’t know anyone and I was as alone as I can be.\n\nIriga Plaza Convention Center, Iriga City.\n\nAfter waiting for a little more than an hour, I decided to eat a very economical lunch at the nearby Chowking fast food chain. When I came back, about a quarter of the seats are already occupied by participants.\n\nThe view from the table where I was seated.\n\nI managed to talk to other people too, which was an achievement in itself, though I still don’t know if I did everything the right, professional way. I am not a people-person but I’m trying to change that portion of my personality, little by little, for the better. If I want to survive this profession, I need to be likable. There’s nothing to lose in being one. :)\n\nMy name tag. They asked me to write my nickname. “Hello! I am Prince!” :)\n\nAfternoon snacks for day 1.\n\nOn the second day, there was a sudden change in the venue because the Convention Center hosted a wedding reception. So we moved to a hall in a nearby University.\n\nI was late during the second day (not that it’s a news) so I found myself a seat at the back portion of the hall. It was the same hall where we had the first few weeks of our review for the Nurse Licensure Examination (NLE) so I pretty much know my way in and out.\n\nMy pathetic attempt of a Feature article. :(\n\nMorning snacks for Day 2.\n\nTuna sandwich and fries in a box…\n\nWith a bottle of coke…\n\nThe meal stub. The lunch pass for Day 2.\n\nFor the second day, since we weren’t in the Convention Center, we were given these pieces of paper that served as our meal stub.\n\nChicken adobo, fried rice and fresh lumpia for lunch on Day 2.\n\nSorry. I just loved how monochromatic my outfit was that day. :)\n\nAfternoon snacks for Day 2.\n\nFor the third and final day of the Seminar-Workshop, I came in late again and managed to find myself a comfortable seat at the back of the hall. We were back at the Convention Center on Day 3. :)\n\nMorning snacks for day 3. :)\n\nI have to say that I learned things… bits of concepts here and there… but not enough to make me call myself a journalist already. I’m a little on the perfectionist side when it comes to skills - that’s why I don’t call myself a painter (even though I can paint) because I know that there are lots of things I still need (and badly want) to learn.\n\nAppetizer for Day 3.\n\nLunch for Day 3. :)\n\nAfternoon snacks for Day 3.\n\nSo the seminar concluded with the awarding of the certificates to the participants. I wish I understood more the technicalities in writing.\n\nSorry for the short post. There’s nothing really much to say. I was disappointed in myself. I didn’t learn that much. :(\n\nFreedom…Happiness… Sunshine. Image from inspirably.\n\nI got nominated by Mindy, the ever young-looking webmistress of Pink and Undecided who claims to be 30 years old (visit her blog and you’ll know what I mean) for the Sunshine Blogger Award. It’s my first time so I’m a little too excited about this.\n\nHere’s how it goes:\n\nTHE RULES:\n\nPost a picture of the Sunshine Award.\n\nPost 11 facts about yourself.\n\nAnswer 11 questions (same as the blogger who nominated you).\n\nLink back to the blogger who nominated you.\n\nNominate 11 bloggers too (no tag backs).\n\nLet the bloggers know about your post.\n\nSounds exciting! I think I’m gonna babble again in this post. Forgive me if I do! :)\n\nFACTS ABOUT PRINCE:\n\nLet’s start with the basics. I am twenty-one years old, biologically female, five feet and three inches tall and currently loving my bob cut hair. I am in a really awesome and loving relationship with… tada! My boyfriend! Who else? I am a Registered Midwife, a Registered Nurse and a soon-to-be licensed teacher. I am taking baby steps towards my career. I am practically paranoid about it and I want everything to be perfect and to go as planned. A little diversion is alright as long as it’s tolerable.\n\nI am a terrible morning person so I resort to cappuccino and coffee addiction to help wake me up every morning. I know that too much caffeine isn’t good for my bones and calcium reserve but I am really groggy every morning. This is a habit I’ve always wanted to change and I keep failing every single time!\n\nI am a notorious procrastinator and have been playing tug-of-war between what I need to do and what I want to do for as long as I can remember. And I’m still struggling to overcome such an awful attitude. I know what I need alright: time management. It’s easier said than done, though. I’ve been thinking that I need therapy on this! Sometimes, I can’t handle my procrastinating nature anymore. It sucks.\n\nI used to love painting and drawing but since I have kind of gotten disappointed and discouraged in the field of art, I resorted to reading and writing (from poetry to short stories to monologues) instead. I love reading everything from news to novels to amateur novelettes by aspiring authors - as long as it isn’t that cliche.\n\nI was once a fan fiction author in winglin and asianfanfics. I still want to continue writing stories for my readers. I do but I’ve been suffering from author’s block - which I attribute to a successful love life. I used to be able to write stories (which aren’t that good - just okay) because I had always been heartbroken. My inspiration during those moments were from my heartbreaking experiences. Now that I am not heartbroken anymore and am more than contented with my love life, I can’t seem to write love stories anymore. Ugh. Why oh why?\n\nI want to be a published author of novels and inspirational books. I still don’t know how I’m going to manage that dream but I feel like I just have to put that dream in my head for now - since my schedule doesn’t allow such leisure just yet. I am not giving up on that dream.\n\nI love taking photos and have been dreaming of having my own DSLR. With that said, I plan on becoming an inspirational blogger, a travel blogger, a book review blogger, an education blogger and a fashion blogger. I don’t know if I’d be able to reach those dreams, while balancing my time with my (future) kids and husband, my career, my job and my precious daydreaming moments. That’s quite a list!\n\nI am not really ladylike in front of guys (and most of the times, even girls) - with my boyfriend as the only exception. I love being tomboyish because it gives me higher self esteem. I don’t even know why. I guess it’s because acting a little tough and rough (but not to the point of rudeness) makes me feel stronger. However, when the situation calls for a ladylike demeanor, I can also guise myself to become a proper lady. I’m weird and I know it. :)\n\nI don’t really like very ladylike ladies who are practically suffering from narcissism and enjoying it. I’m talking about the selfie phenomenon. I think there’s nothing wrong with taking pictures of yourself, most especially if no one else is present to take a picture for you. However, taking photos after photos every five minutes is uncalled for. It’s just a little too irritating and sad that it’s depressing me. I mean, why do people do that? I need to research on this topic.\n\nI don’t like fancy jewelries (but I still need to have some in the case of special occasions) and I dress as comfortable as I could. I am obsessed with sweat pants and tactical pants because they offer the best comfort. However, I want to stand out when there’s a special occasion so I also know how and when to dress up properly. However, as for casual wears, it depends on my mood.\n\nI’m actually planning on buying a bicycle of my own, which I’m going to use as my service to and from the school where I’ll be teaching! I want my students to see me as a simple and practical person. Besides, aside from minimizing air pollution and saving up transportation fees, I’d also get a fair amount of exercise on a daily basis! Isn’t that cool?\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:\n\nWhat do you prefer to do on Christmas, open gifts or give gifts?\n\nHonestly, I’d love to do both! But I feel like I’m cheating now so to answer this question, I’d prefer giving gifts. That’s because seeing happiness on the other person’s face is a very fulfilling Christmas gift that I can give to myself. :)\n\nParty invitation, do you prefer to wear a dress or pants?\n\nIt depends on the kind of party, my mood and who I am going with. :)\n\nWhat designer would you like to model for?\n\nI’m not really familiar with designers so I don’t know. Sorry. :)\n\nA model you wish you were?\n\nI wish I were Miranda Kerr. Her body and face and hair… everything is perfect! AND I wish I have her discipline when it comes to food!\n\nWhen you go on a date do you prefer Movies or Bowling?\n\nI prefer movies. I don’t know how to play bowling and I don’t think I’m gonna enjoy it, either. It looks kinda boring to me. -_-\n\nWhich will you have to like, a mountain or the beach?\n\nI like the beach as long as it’s calm and not very touristy. I always want to relax when I go to beaches. :)\n\nFavorite Lip Balm?\n\nI don’t have one so I have no clue what the difference is. :)\n\nRestaurant or homemade food?\n\nOf course nothing can beat homemade food!\n\nEggnog or Champagne?\n\nEggnog! I don’t drink liquors - no matter how light, how expensive or how cool it is. -_- They always give me flank pains so… no.\n\nFrom all of the blogger followers, who would you want to meet?\n\nWell, technically I don’t have blogger followers because I don’t have Google Friend Connect in my blog. However, I’d love to meet Mindy Pauline! She’s sounds so cool to be around with and has lots of story to share. :)\n\nI WOULD LIKE TO NOMINATE THE FOLLOWING AWESOME BLOGGERS:\n\nSamantha of Greenspired\n\nIrish of Iamsociallyawkward\n\nMrs. C. of Mrspcuyugan\n\nRochkirstin of Rochkirstin\n\nAngelique of Ladywithrandomthoughts\n\nGen-zel of Genzelkisses\n\nSai of Fashionbysai\n\nRobi Jiz of Kabyahe\n\nMarie of Mommyunwired\n\nMeika of Mamaisworking\n\nJaja of Beautycolada\n\nJeez. I have disclosed more things here than I did in my About Me page!\n\nI should have been reviewing for the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) while I was reading this dystopian trilogy by Veronica Roth.\n\nDivergent is the debut novel of American novelist Veronica Roth, published by Harper Collins Children’s Books in 2011. It is a young-adult dystopian novel set in the so-called Divergent Universe, that features a post-apocalyptic version of Chicago. The novel explores the protagonist’s emotional struggles as she defines her identity within a society that defines its citizens’ by their social and personality-related affiliation with five different factions. Also driving the novel is a romantic subplot between Tris and Four, her trainer in her new faction, “Dauntless”. - Wikipedia.\n\nInitially, despite the marketing and advertisement by the media, the Divergent didn’t really catch my attention. I just decided to read the whole book after I watched the official trailer.\n\nI don’t know… I guess it’s because I already have the image of Theo James and Shailene Woodley in mind while reading the book so it’s a whole lot better than just reading the book with blank faces of a boy and girl in mind. The best thing is that I can let my imagination about the whole place run wild - not just limited within what’s featured in the movie.\n\nThis is the first time that I actually read the whole book before watching the movie adaptation and I must say, there’s the big difference than doing it the other way round. Now that I have experienced this, I will do my best to read the book first before watching its movie adaptation. It’s a better exercise for your imagination and offers a better experience. :)\n\nSo in the post-apocalyptic Chicago, the ancestors of the decided to establish the city into five different factions according to personalities:\n\nAbnegation - for the selfless\n\nAmity - for those seeking peaceful\n\nCandor - for those who are (brutally) honest\n\nDauntless - for the brave\n\nErudite - for the intelligent\n\nThey believed that the faction system is the reason why they have made it after the war. How are they sorted? They are sorted into factions (I can’t help but compare it to Harry Potter’s houses) when they turn 16. The sixteen-year-old of every factions will have to take an aptitude test, which results will tell them which faction they are compatible to.\n\nWell, what’s odd is that these people don’t necessarily have to choose the faction according to the aptitude test result. They still have the option to freely choose which faction they want to join. I mean, the aptitude test only exists to… like… give advice? I dunno. I think its main purpose is to allow the Erudite to determine the divergents - whom they perceive as a threat to the system because divergents can’t be confined in a single faction only. They can qualify for 2 or more factions.\n\nTobias “Four” Eaton played by Theo James. Image from divergentfans.\n\nThomas Eaton is a total hottie. I don’t deny that obvious fact. When I was reading the book series, I have his face and physique in mind so I don’t have a problem imagining Four. I mean, he fits the character well! It’s really easier to read the book with a real person’s image in mind. :)\n\nShailene Woodley as Beatrice “Tris” Prior. Image from tobiaslovesmydauntlesscake.\n\nShailene Woodley isn’t exactly the short, wimpy girl that looks like a child from the book but overall, she was able to portray the character effectively.\n\nI have read the trilogy already and honestly, I am having difficulty reviewing the Divergent book because there are lots of things that have been disclosed already in the other two books.\n\nOverall, I like the author’s writing style. Veronica Roth was able to write an action-packed novel in a way that won’t make my head hurt from all the big, technical words. It was a light read.\n\nThe only thing I want to complain about is the fact that first 75% of the book is all about a little too elaborately written training of initiates and cooking of the Tris-Four love story. I can’t complain much about the latter as much as I complain about the first one because honestly, it’s the only thing that geared me up to read the whole trilogy - since I already have the image of Shailene and Theo in mind (they have good chemistry).\n\nThe real action just started in last few pages so I felt like the story line was dragging itself a little bit. Overall it was an enjoyable (yet not-that-spectacular) read.\n\nAs for the movie, though, there were LOTS of things that happened in the book that aren’t featured in the movie at all - I should not be disappointed but I still am. :(\n\nBesides, the compound looked better in my imagination than what I saw in the movie and it’s kinda disappointing.\n\nOf course, since it’s a BIG movie, I expected the whole thing to beat the world that I conjured myself when I was reading the book.\n\nAs of the plot, though it feels like the author just threw things she randomly thought of in her dreams together in the first 75% of the book (because most of those things didn’t really matter that much with regards to the whole story), I like the way that the love story and the action are balanced - that is, in the book - which wasn’t that apparent in the movie.\n\nThe thing about Divergent is that you really need to read the whole trilogy to understand what’s going on. I find it amusing! Seriously. I don’t know about you but after I learned the reason why they were inside a fence, I felt a conflicting feeling of disbelief and amusement.\n\nI found myself saying, “Ugh. Seriously?”\n\nAnyway, if you guys want a free EPUB copy of the trilogy (and other inclusive), click the following titles: Divergent, Insurgent, Allegiant, Free Four, The Transfer. Enjoy! :)\n\nFor free PDF copies of all five, click here. Do remember to wait for 5 seconds and click the skip ad button that looks like this:\n\nHave you read the Divergent book and watched the movie adaptation too? Feel free to share your comments below. :)\n\nYesterday, I already inquired about the availability of my grades in the university where I took 18 units Methods of Teaching subjects. Sadly, the transcript of records is not available as of the moment because our professors haven’t submitted our grades yet.\n\nI don’t know when the transcript will be available but I’m seriously hoping that the other news is just a nasty joke. A former classmate told me yesterday that the university will not issue my transcript of records (TOR) unless I enroll in a review center or in the review class that the university is offering!\n\nI was utterly shocked! I am doing self review right now and I don’t think my parents will allow me to hand over 6000 pesos (full) for just a few days of review. That amount itself can already buy lots of reviewers! I am seriously hoping that that bad news isn’t true.\n\nI don’t even know if it’s alright for a teaching institution, even though it’s privately owned, to hold the release of the transcript because of the abovementioned reason. -_-\n\nIt gives me the impression that they don’t have much faith with the quality of instruction of their university.\n\nCome to think of it; if they know that the quality of instruction in their university is good enough, they wouldn’t require their students to enroll in review classes because what they have learned inside the school should be enough to successfully get them through the board examination. -_-\n\nAnyway, I’m still hoping that if it’s the protocol of the institution, they’d let me be one of the exceptions. I’m going to pursue masters this summer so I can’t possibly attend review class at the same time. Besides, I really want to pass. They shouldn’t worry about me that much because I’m doing what I can to ensure that I pass the board. :( Somehow, this is still making me feel uneasy.\n\nI just happened to read the quote above while scrolling through my Facebook feeds and it hit something within me. I gotta read now. :)\n\nImage from kevinandamanda. Edited using Adobe Photoshop CC.\n\nI am the kind of person who can’t seem to stay on track for long. I may be driven for a week, or sometimes even a month but my focus hardly lasts longer than that. Thus, I need a constant source of motivation and inspiration to keep me on track.\n\nI have read about this method once but I completely forgot where I learned about this so pardon me if I can’t state the origin of this idea. However, instead of a simple fishbowl method, I decided to put some artistry in it.\n\nThis is my Project No. 1.1 - A Daily Dose of Inspiration.\n\nLet me explain to you the whole idea before we get started:\n\nThe concept is just like drawing lots; only this time you have to write your big dreams, visions, inspirations, or even your favorite success quotes in the paper instead of a winning number.\n\nWhenever you feel down, frustrated, or discouraged, pick something from the bowl (randomly) and read it. It’s going to make you feel better, I assure you. It’s like the future itself is trying to poke you, reminding you that you shouldn’t give up on pursuing him (or her).\n\nThis is a good exercise when you’re starting a new venture or you’re going to make a major decision or change in your life. Change is scary, as a matter of fact, because it means sailing away from your comfort zone. That’s why you need a reminder. A personalized one is even better. :)\n\nSomehow, this project may help you remember why you started in the first place. :)\n\nYou can’t possibly remember every logic, philosophy and reasons you had when you started planning or when you decided to do a major change in your life. You might forget why you chose a particular path in the first place when the obstacles start to pile up. :)\n\nOriginal image from weheartit. Edited using Adobe Photoshop CC.\n\nSo here are the materials that I used:\n\nOld CD container\n\nColorful papers\n\nColorful pens\n\nGlue and tape\n\nScissor and cutter\n\nOther designing tools\n\nBasically, you can use anything from an old shoe box to a tin can as long as it can house your notes inside it. The photo below? Just some stuffs I managed to salvage… from cake box ribbons to uniform buttons. :)\n\nThe empty CD container:\n\nCutting equipment. :)\n\nIf you are wondering what this is all about, let me show you the\n\nFINAL OUTPUT:\n\nNow that you’ve seen it, I’m gonna show you how I did it. After gathering all the materials, I decorated the outer part of the CD container with this cute wallpaper.\n\nIt’s basically up to you. Make the design as personalized and as stylish as you can!\n\nI used an old folder to cover the base of the CD container. I also used the other half of the folder to cut another cover for the top (or the cover) of the CD container.\n\nFully covered! :)\n\nAfter all the covering, I made a simple design on the cover.\n\nI manually cut the folder with cutter to make slits for the ribbon. You can use a puncher if you want, of course. I didn’t use one because I can’t find mine. :)\n\nYou can design it in any way you want. :)\n\nAfter designing the container, I started writing inspirational notes, reminders, dreams and even ugly insults thrown at me. This is the FUN and the most IMPORTANT part.\n\nOf course you need a pen! Design it the way you want it! :)\n\nThis is the design I picked from my stacks of stationery and notepads. :)\n\nHere are some examples of the stuffs that I wrote:\n\nSorry I have to blur the name. It’s necessary for the person’s confidentiality. :)\n\nUhm… yes. I wanna be a travel blogger and lots of other things. Don’t get me started with my dreams because it’s gonna take me the whole day writing yet another set of monologue. It’s just that I\"m so passionate about dreaming… Damn. Sorry. I’ll stop now. :)\n\nYes. There’s this VERY talented person with a huge potential who deserves all the help he can get. I wanna help him out no matter what happens. :)\n\nA message to my future self. Sincerely, dreaming self. :)\n\nAfter writing as many reminders, dreams or letters as you can, roll these pieces of papers. :)\n\nHere is an example of how the rolled papers look when inside the designed old CD container:\n\nWhenever you feel sad, let down, frustrated, hopeless, discouraged, you can pick a note and be reminded of why you’re there in the first place.\n\nIt’s done! It's pretty simple actually. My design is simple itself. However, it’s not all about the design. It’s all about the usage of this project.\n\nPlease feel free to tell me what you think about this project through the comment’s box below. I’ll be more than happy if you’d share your own unique way to stay motivated.\n\nThank you for dropping by and have fun making yours! :)"
