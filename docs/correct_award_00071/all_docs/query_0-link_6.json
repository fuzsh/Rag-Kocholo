        "text": "Reviews From the Archive\n\nAn occasional series, cross-posting my reviews from Read the Nobels.\n\nTo see my progress with completing the Read the Nobels Challenge, see here.\n\nSteppenwolf, by Herman Hesse, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1946\n\nTranslated by Basil Creighton, revised by Walter Sorrell, Penguin, 1965, 1979 reprint.\n\nI am almost too embarrassed to share the excruciating naïveté of this review, but there it is at Blogspot for all to see anyway, and those who’ve read the book may enjoy an opportunity to chat about it set me straight. To redress my sins, I’ve added excerpts from its citation in 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die which, (obviously) I didn’t own when I wrote this review. I apologise too, for the use of the term ‘schizophrenic’… these days I would use ‘bipolar disorder’.\n\n30th November, 2006\n\nHesse says in his introduction that this is the most misunderstood of his works and I can understand why. It seems to be a first person narration of a person with a mental disorder – maybe schizophrenic or maybe chronic depression – but whatever it was, I got tired of it before long.\n\nThe Steppenwolf is a man who feels himself to be half man, half wolf, and he is torn between satisfying his ‘base’ desires (exemplified by sex, dancing, jazz and generally the sort of stuff that most people enjoy but he despises himself for it) and satisfying his intellectual desires (Goethe, Mozart, solitariness and rejecting bourgeois taste).\n\nHe meets a strange girl who seems to know what’s good for him, but Hermoine is also a Herman, and a procuress to boot. She lines up another girl for him, not to mention Pablo the jazz muso.\n\nI know, I know, all this is a metaphor for the crisis in Hesse’s own persona, but at the end of the day, it just didn’t work for me. At least it was short. (And so is this ‘review’!)\n\nI finished reading it and journalled it on the 30th of November, 2006.\n\nFrom the citation in 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, edited by Peter Boxall, A Quintet Book for ABC Books (2006 edition) purchased from the Hobart Bookshop, $45.00\n\nHarry Haller, the protagonist of Steppenwolf, feels himself painfully divided into two diametrically opposed personas. […] Steppenwolf chronicles the tension that dominates Haller’s inner life from three distinct perspectives: his bourgeois landlady’s nephew, a psychoanalytic tract, and Haller’s own autobiographical accounts. With the help of some of the other characters, Haller gradually learns that every ego, so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms…\n\n[…]\n\nHe determines to explore the multiple aspects of his being, experimenting with his sexuality, frequenting jazz clubs where he learns to dance the fox-trot, and socialising with groups of people whom he formerly regarded with condescension and derision. Thus he realises that these pursuits are to be valued as much as the thrill of intellectual discovery. The highly experimental, perplexing nature of the conclusion goes some way to explaining why Steppenwolf is the most misunderstood of Hesse’s works.\n\nIn addition to a brilliant and thought-provoking meditation on the tumultuous process of self-discover, Steppenwolf is a scathing and prescient critique of the complacency of Germany’s middle class amidst the escalating militarism that preceded and made possible Hitler’s rise to power. (p.322)\n\nAm I going to read it again? Uh, no. But I have Siddharta and The Glass Bead Game on the TBR, both of which are listed in 1001 Books and I am going to read them in due course.\n\nWhat I’d really like (and this is my not so secret real reason for publishing this) would be for someone who’s written a proper review of Steppenwolf to tell me where it is so that I can link to it from here.\n\nUpdate 1/12/20: Yesssss! Andrew Blackman has just reviewed Steppenwolf here.\n\nHi Lisa, love your review. No need to be embarrassed, thankfully we all grow in literary maturity and understanding with time and perseverance. At least you are brave enough to share it with us and we can all have a little chuckle together. I read Steppenwolf about 5 years ago but sadly I don’t have a review. I wasn’t blogging then and I don’t remember enough about the book to offer an adequate opinion, except that I remember being somewhat confused by it. I knew it was considered a classic but lacked any knowledge about Hesse himself. I’m currently studying a BA in English Lit and History, and have just completed a course looking at the Literary Canon. One of the things I really took away from the course was the need for some context and background knowledge when reading many of these classic texts. It’s sometimes quite difficult to go in cold. Steppenwolf is a short book, so maybe I will reread it one day and write a review then. It will be interesting to see how you find Hesse’s other two texts."
