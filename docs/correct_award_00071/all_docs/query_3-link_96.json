        "text": "Filmstill from \"Vagabunden Karawane\" © Werner Penzel Filmproduktion itd.\n\nHermann Hesse: 100 years of Siddhartha\n\nThe Sound of Faraway Lands\n\nSouth Asia maintains a long tradition of yearning for German cultural figures and intellectuals. Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha, published in 1922, is an expression of this fascination. The book also shaped the South Asian enthusiasm of the 1960s and 1970s. Commemorating the 100th anniversary of Siddhartha, the Goethe-Instituts in South Asia are exploring how South Asia and Germany are projected in the other region in literature, music, film and everyday culture.\n\nAbout the Project\n\n\"Siddhartha\" – A Tale from India?\n\nHermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha, published in 1922, is part of the tradition of enthusiastic romanticism about India in Germany. The novel also had a formative influence on a later phase of India euphoria, which saw thousands of young people from Europe and the U.S. embark on journeys to India and Afghanistan in the 1960s and 1970s. How did Siddhartha shape the image of India in Germany? On the occasion of 100 years of Siddhartha, contributions on the mutual reception of South Asia and Germany are brought together here - in literature, music, film and everyday culture.\n\nSiddhartha in Translation\n\nThe popularity of Siddhartha is prevalent from a large number of translations in the various South-Asian languages.\n\n© Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Sanskrit\n\nPublisher: Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\nTranslation: L Sulochana Devi (2008)\n\n© Kairali Books Kannur\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Malyalam\n\nPublisher: Kairali Books Kannur\n\nTranslation: R. Raman Nair (1990)\n\n© Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Marathi\n\nPublisher: Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\nTranslation: Avinash Tripathi (2007)\n\n© Fiction House\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Urdu\n\nPublisher: Fiction House\n\nTranslation: Asif Farkhi\n\n© Shilalekh\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Punjabi\n\nPublisher: Shilalekh\n\nTranslation: Dr. Hari Singh\n\n© Pallavi Publications\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Telugu\n\nPublisher: Pallavi Publications\n\nTranslation: Bellamkonda Raghava Rao\n\n© Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Hindi\n\nPublisher: Hermann Hesse Society of India\n\nTranslation: Prabakaran Hebbar Illath (2012)\n\n© New Directions Publishing Corporation\n\n\"Siddhartha\" in Englisch\n\nPublisher: New Directions Publishing Corporation\n\nTranslation: Hilda Rosner (1951)\n\nConversations on Literature\n\nThe german fascination with the Indian subcontinent can be vividly witnessed in the works German-speaking writers with the onset of the 18 century, as well as in the works of writers like Hermann Hesse and Günther Grass. In their texts they not only reflect the general image of India of that time, but also their own cultural paradigms.\n\nThere is no understanding without prejudices - so famously argued the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, an admirer of Indian philosophy. In a similar way, one could argue that there is no engagement with another culture without projections. In this literary dialogue series, we invite artists from literature and other fields to explore the role of projections in intercultural encounters. Do we need them at all? If so, are they merely negative, or can projections be productive as well? How do projections manifest themselves in literature?\n\nEvents\n\nPerception is related to insights and understanding. In a story, how each character is perceived by each one varies according to the narration, experiences and worldviews. Writers have their own perceptions to describe, analyze and explain content. So what are the techniques that are employed by writers when they write about other cultures and what are the challenges that the translators face when they intend to capture the otherness?\n\nIn this panel discussion, we have two eminent writers, one from Germany and one from India along with a prominent translator, discussing how they perceive the other in their writings. They shall also deliberate on how the perception of the foreign is reflected in their works and how they shape ideas and images of the other world through their works.\n\nDay, Date: Thursday, 8 December 2022\n\nTime 18:00-19:30 hrs.\n\nVenue: Goethe-Institut New Delhi / Max Mueller Bhavan Chennai\n\nParticipants\n\nChristopher Kloeble\n\nChristopher Kloeble is a German novelist, playwright, and scriptwriter.

One of the most prolific writers in India today, he has authored more than two hundred books, spanning novels, short fiction, travelogues, literary criticism and essays on heritage and philosophy, amongst others.\n\nPriyamvada Ramkumar\n\nPriyamvada Ramkumar is a private equity investor and literary translator. She translates from her native tongue Tamil into English. Her first book-length translation, Stories of the True (a translation of B.Jeyamohan’s Aram), was published by Juggernaut Books in August 2022.\n\nModeration by Dr. Katharina Görgen\n\nDr. Görgen is the Director of Goethe-Institut Chennai. She is a film scientist, a feminist aficionado with years of experience in media culture and theatre.\n\nThere is no understanding without prejudices - so famously argued the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, an admirer of Indian philosophy. In a similar way, one could argue that there is no engagement with another culture without projections. In this literary dialogue series, we invite artists from literature and other fields to explore the role of projections in intercultural encounters. Do we need them at all? If so, are they merely negative, or can projections be productive as well? How do projections manifest themselves in literature?\n\nIn the discussion, the participants will examine how the perception of the foreign is reflected in literary works. How do authors shape ideas and images of India in Germany through their works, and vice versa?\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\nMartin Mosebach (digital participation)\n\nMartin Mosebach is a German writer of novels, plays, radio plays, and other genres.

This is also reflected in literature. In this conversation with writers and publishers from Germany and India, we will explore how feminism and gender relations are reflected through literature in the two countries. We will discuss ways in which projections, societal norms and global movements have shifted the feminist discourse over time.\n\nParticipants\n\nMithu Melanie Sanyal was born in Düsseldorf in 1971 and is a cultural scientist, writer, journalist and critic.

Southasia and Germany resonate as cosmopolitan spaces for intercultural transnational exchanges, with live music events and festivals mushrooming since the 1960s. A burgeoning interest can be recapitulated with JISR, a German band that toured South Asia in the late 1960s, with Afghanistan and India as important cultural stops. What once were just palatable teasers are now a regular delight, with music becoming increasingly fluid since the very dawn of the 21st century.\n\nJISR - on tour in South Asia\n\n© Ali Malak\n\nJisr is Arabic for “bridge”. The popular international ensemble performs in a wide variety of instrumentations with top-class virtuoso musicians. Rooted in several musical genres, this unconventional musical project builds bridges between Arabian, Afro, jazz, rock and classical music and takes the path of maximum musical variation and improvisation.\n\nIn 2016, Ramdan came from Morocco to Munich to study German where he founded the group with two refugee Syrians. Marja Buchard is also a Jisr band member. The multi-instrumentalist is the leader of Embryo, a world music group founded by her father Christian Burchard in 1969, which she took over in 2016 and has continued to lead since his death in 2018.\n\nIn March 2022, Jisr will tour South Asia at the invitation of the Goethe-Institut - with stops in Colombo, Karachi, Dhaka, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore.\n\nVibraphon, Keys, Trombone\n\nMarja Burchard\n\n\"I had the privilege of listening to music from India live from an early age.\"\n\nOud, Guitar\n\nRoman Bunka\n\n\"South Asian Modal Music has influenced musicians in all genres . I hope to get new impulses through this trip.\"\n\nEMBRYO\n\nThe band Embryo was founded in 1969 by multi-instrumentalists Christian Burchard and Edgar Hofmann in Munich. The two are considered to be the pioneers of the so-called Krautrock in the 1960s. The band travelled overland from Germany to India and Afghanistan in 1979. Since then, the band has been intensively involved with Indian, Afghan and also African music. To this day, the band combines jazz with rhythms and instruments from India, Africa and the Arab world.\n\nMarja Burchard, the co-founder of the band Jisr, took over the leadership of Embryo from her father Christian Burchard in 2016."
