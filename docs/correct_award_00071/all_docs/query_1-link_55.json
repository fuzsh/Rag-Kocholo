Hesse’s writings often explore themes of spirituality, self-discovery, and the search for meaning in life.\n\nHermann Hesse became my personal favorite author after reading one of his lesser known books titled Demian for the first time in 2021. Up until that point I had never read a book that I couldn’t stop thinking about until it was finished. I believe I finished in less than 2 days it’s a fairly short book roughly 100 pages. \n\nSo when I had the opportunity to own Hesse’s first ever publication in its original German from 1904 “Peter Carmenzind”… of course I purchased it. Despite the unusual foxing and spotting to the boards the inside is very clear and the book seems to be unread! \n\nIt likely survived both World Wars, is 120 years old, and thanks to God…. And my inability to pass up a great book…. It has made its way into my collection and I’m forever grateful 🙏\".",
