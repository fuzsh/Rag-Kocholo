        "text": "We tend not to think of Hermann Hesse as a guy with a great sense of humor.\n\nTo the contrary, Hesse was known to be deeply interested in spirituality. He became widely read in the US during the 1960’s when his sort of quest for spirituality came into vogue. BTW, Americans tend to forget that Hesse had already won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1946, and was much more widely known and understood in Europe.\n\nIn fact, Hesse was born in Estonia in the small town of Paide back in 1877. His father was a Baltic German,, which made Hesse both a citizen of the Russian and German Empires. If you are not familiar with the history of the region, the Baltic Germans had been established as a dominating land owning class in Estonia going back to the 13th century following their crusade. The Estonian, meanwhile had only fairly recently been freed from serfdom in the earlier part of the 19th century.\n\nThis tidbit of young Herman’s Baltic German life in Paide is especially odd\n\nHesse described his father’s Baltic German heritage as “an important and potent fact” of his developing identity. His father, Hesse stated, “always seemed like a very polite, very foreign, lonely, little-understood guest.”[6] His father’s tales from Estonia instilled a contrasting sense of religion in young Hermann. “[It was] an exceedingly cheerful, and, for all its Christianity, a merry world… We wished for nothing so longingly as to be allowed to see this Estonia… where life was so paradisiacal, so colorful and happy.” Hermann Hesse’s sense of estrangement from the Swabian petty bourgeoisie further grew through his relationship with his maternal grandmother Julie Gundert, née Dubois, whose French-Swiss heritage kept her from ever quite fitting in among that milieu.\n\nIf you are craving for a peek at Paide, here is a nice view. BTW, there is a very nice restaurant or two in that vicinity. One specializes in fish. The other in sort of a Noma reverence for local tastes.\n\nHmmm … cheerful Estonia? That is not the image one normally has of this northern culture. But Hesse saw it differently back then.\n\nHesse led a more cosmopolitan life than his father.But perhaps like his father, the sense of estrangement or at least detachment was always a theme of his consciousness. Are estrangement and humor contradictory? And if they are, why do I think of him as an artist with a sense of humor?\n\nIt comes from Theodore Ziolkowski’s introduction to Hesse’s “The Glass Bead Game”. It was the great author’s last major work. Just for fun, here is good old Professor Ziolkowski. He has had a distinguished academic career, though you might not suspect it because of the rather jaunty chapeau.\n\nAccording to Ziolkowski, when Hesse finished The Glass Bead Game, he sent it to his friend Thomas Mann. Mann immediately saw something in the story that few others did.\n\n(he sensed) that the serious theme of Hesse’s novel was enclosed within a “cunning artistic joke”.\n\nIn short, the book is a parody of biography because the narrator is a bit of a pompous fool. Mann foresaw that the general reading public would not get the joke, Worse still, the translation of the work erases its sense of irony.\n\nSo here we have Hesse the artist, at the end of his long career, making fun of his ability to tell a story. This is not back slapping stuff. But it is humor nonetheless. Humor of a subtle sort that is part of the artist’s estrangement.\n\nAnd it it an attitude that is foreign to many of us living in 2018. Irony? Detachment? Spirituality?`Longing for Paide?\n\nAll most peculiar!"
