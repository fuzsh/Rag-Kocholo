        "text": "Biography of Hermann Hesse\n\nHerman Hesse was born in Calw, located in the Kingdom of Württemberg, on the 2nd of July 1877.\n\nIn the 1870s, the Kaiserreich, also known as the German Empire, was a period of the unification of the separate kingdoms of Germany. In 1871, the Southern German states joined the North German Confederation. In all, there were 25 states, including Württemberg, where Hesse was born.\n\nHesse's father, Johannes Hesse, worked at a publishing house and was a Pietist. Pietism is something Hesse would distance himself from as he grew older.\n\nHesse was an incredibly depressed child and spent time exploring the nature around Calw. Between 1881 and 1887, Hesse lived in Basel, Switzerland with his family. Hesse, under the encouragement of his grandfather, began to read widely as a child. He also had a love of music, poetry, and art.\n\nIn 1891, Hesse joined the Evangelical Theological Seminary at Maulbronn Abbey and spent a great deal of his time translating Greek poetry and writing essays. However, by the spring of 1892, Hesse's personality began to shift. He became increasingly rebellious. He moved around to different schools and even attempted suicide. He was moved to a mental institution located in Stetten im Remstal before re-entering school at the end of the year. Finally, in 1893, he passed his exams and finished school.\n\nHesse began work as a bookshop apprentice before moving on to a mechanic apprenticeship at a clock factory. By 1895, Hesse found another apprenticeship with a bookseller and began to focus greatly on his spirituality.\n\nHesse was not very social and preferred to read. He focused on Greek myths, theology, Goethe, Schiller, and Nietzsche. He would then move on to studying the German Romantics. In 1896, Hesse published a poem called \"Madonna\" in a periodical before releasing an entire poetry volume titled Romantic Songs (1896). This got the attention of Eugen Diedrichs, a publisher interested in publishing Hesse's prose collection One Hour After Midnight (1898). Both publications were unsuccessful.\n\nHesse moved to Basel, Switzerland in 1899. There he worked in a bookshop and found himself in an active intellectual and literary circle of friends. After a trip to Italy, Hesse decided to work at an antique bookstore and began to publish more works, such as Posthumous Writings and Poems of Hermann Lauscher (1901). This got the attention of Samuel Fischer, who published Hesse's next novel, Peter Camenzind (1904).\n\nWith enough recognition to become a full-time writer, Hesse got married, had children, and began writing full-time. He produced novels, short stories, and poems. A few of these publications include Beneath the Wheel (1906), \"The Wolf\" (1906-07), and Gertrude (1910).\n\nIn the early 1900s, Hesse took an interest in Buddhism once more. In 1904, Hesse was introduced to theosophy.\n\nDrawn by his interests in Buddhism, Hesse embarked on a trip to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Burma in 1911. He was not satisfied with his spiritual journey and returned home to his family. They moved to Bern, Switzerland in 1912, but Hesse's marriage was already falling apart. This inspired his novel Rosshalde (1914).\n\nIn 1914, when World War I broke out, Hesse wished to volunteer for combat but was rendered unfit. Hesse instead volunteered to care for prisoners of war. During this time, Hesse published an essay titled \"Oh Friends, Not These Tones\" (1914), calling for an end to nationalistic conflict among European countries. Hesse was heavily criticized during the war for his anti-nationalistic views.\n\nThis was followed by the death of his father and the illness of his son and wife. This caused Hesse to seek help from a psychotherapist. This sparked an interest in psychoanalysis and a friendship with the psychoanalyst Carl Jung.\n\nIn 1919, after divorcing his wife, Hesse moved to Montagnola where he focused on writing and painting. He was very productive and happy. During this period, Hesse wrote the novella Klingsor's Last Summer (1920) and his most famous novella, Siddhartha (1922). During this period, he also published Der Steppenwolf (1927).\n\nHe moved in with the art historian Ninon Dolbin in 1931 and began work on The Glass Bead Game (1943). This would become his last major literary piece. In 1933, with the rise of Nazism in Germany and Hesse's strong stance against antisemitism, Hesse began to undermine the Nazi regime quietly by making the banned literary works of Jewish authors popular. Hesse was eventually banned from publication under the Nazis."
