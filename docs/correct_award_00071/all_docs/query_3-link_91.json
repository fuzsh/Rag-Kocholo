        "text": "Fifty-four years after Robert Allen Zimmerman changed the world with his eponymous debut album Bob Dylan, the titan of American songwriting has just been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nThe win comes as a sweet surprise for many Dylanologists -- including Bill Wyman -- who have for years argued the case for Dylan getting the Nobel. Dylan is now the first ever songwriter to win the prize, considered as one of the world's most prestigious and financially generous award. The Swedish Academy's literature prize, unlike its awards in the field of science, medicine and others, is given for a lifetime of writing rather than a single piece of work. Even though many would argue that Dylan's work may not fit the traditional literary canons of poetry, novels and stories that the Academy has recognised in the past, his influence is far too expansive to be ignored in human history.\n\n\"Dylan changed the nature of his art form repeatedly and is still doing so, which is why he's the greatest creator of songs who has ever lived,\"argues writer/film director Jaideep Varma. A sentiment shared by millions of Dylanologists, and the Swedish Academy's permanent Secretary Sara Danius. She said, \"If you look far back, 5000 years, you discover Homer and Sappho. They wrote poetic texts which were meant to be performed, and it's the same way for Bob Dylan. We still read Homer and Sappho, and we enjoy it. For 54 years now, he's been at it reinventing himself, constantly creating a new identity.\" Salman Rushdie chimed in on Twitter, \"From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice. #Nobel\"\n\nBut the reactions to Dylan's Nobel prize -- previously awarded to literary stalwarts like Ernest Hemmingway (1954), Hermann Hesse (1946) and Pearl S. Buck (1938) -- have been fairly divided with some, including author Hari Kunzru, calling it the \"lamest Nobel win since they gave it to Obama for not being Bush.\" And publisher Jason Pinter now arguing the case for Stephen King to \"get elected to the Rock 'n' Roll hall of fame.\"\n\nBob Dylan is the first every songwriter to be awarded this prize, and the first American to win it since Toni Morrison in 1993."
