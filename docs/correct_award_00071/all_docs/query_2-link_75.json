I started reading an edition translated by Basil Creighton but found certain parts difficult. Since I buddy-read this book with @eranehreads , he sent photos of the same page, which I found easy. Then I got an edition translated by Kurt Beals, and I found the book easier. Though it’s a novel that's autobiographical, existential fiction, parts of it read like an epistolary and magical realism.\n\nHaving read Siddhartha (by the same author) a few years ago, I could see that both the books spoke about finding oneself or self-exploration in different ways.\n\nThe protagonist Harry Haller and the author Hermann Hesse have similar names starting with ‘H’. Hermann Hesse wrote this book when he was about fifty.\n\nHarry is a man around the age of fifty. He looks like an intellectual, and he is courteous and amicable but is a mystery and perpetually looks disenchanted. Harry is a writer and a pacifist who has given up many things in his life, including his wife and job.\n\nWhat is he going through?\n\nWas he going through a midlife crisis?\n\nOr did he suffer from an existential crisis?\n\nA neighbour initially narrates and tells us how he perceives Harry. Then he reads out the book Harry has written about himself.\n\nOften, we as adults feel that we do not need anybody to guide or chide us, and inherently, we need that father figure or maternal touch to pilot our lives. So many decisions in our lives would be much easier if we constantly had someone to show us the way. Time and time again, we need people to bring out the best in us. Don't you think?\n\nHarry meets a girl at the bar who very vociferously tells Harry to do things as though taking control of his life. Harry happily listens to her and humbly agrees to do whatever she asks him to do. Loved the fact that he found a person who could bring him out of his cage. \n\nCONTD BELOW ⬇️\".",
