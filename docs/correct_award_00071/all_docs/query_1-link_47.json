        "text": "Herman Hesse – Abandoned studies and suicide attempt\n\nHerman Hesse was born in the German town of Calw on 2 July 1877. The son of a Protestant missionary couple, his childhood environment was comfortable and educated. His parents wished him to pursue a career as a theologian, but his rebellious nature often brought him into conflict with teachers and his family. He wanted to become a poet and nothing else, Herman Hesse expressed at the age of fifteen as he fled out of a theological lecture. Two months later, he attempted suicide and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. He felt shunned by God, his parents, and the whole world, and wrote his father a reproachful letter full of irony and sarcasm. He broke off an apprenticeship as bookbinder as well as mechanic in the tower clock factory in Calw. Hesse’s difficult experiences during his youth later found their way into his novel Under the Wheel.\n\nFirst literary successes bring independence\n\nHermann Hesse started writing early on in his life: at the age of ten he had already written a literary fairy tale, published in Zürich in 1951. Whilst working in an antiquarian bookshop in Basel, and thanks to his parents’ good social contacts - including the Swiss historian Rudolf Wackernagel and the Austrian poet Richard von Schaukal – he wrote the book Hermann Lauscher which contained poems and prose pieces and was initially published under a pseudonym. There followed ever more small publications until his literary breakthrough with his civilisation-critical novel Peter Camenzind. The resulting fees allowed him to marry the photographer Mina Bernoulli, nine years his elder, with whom he had already undertaken a trip to Italy. The couple settled on the Bodensee, and in the spirit of the ‘Lebensreform’, lived for three years without running water and electricity.\n\nOpposition to war and nationalism\n\nHerman Hesse was a citizen of the Russian Empire for a time, later of Württemberg, and finally Switzerland, but always felt connected to the whole world and its people. He valued the books of Karl May, defended him against literary criticism and declared that if only May had been a pacifist, he could have stopped the youth from any further war with his enthusiastic writing. Hesse himself had once volunteered for military service but was decommissioned due to an eye condition and assigned to the prisoner-of-war welfare service, where he was responsible for the library. Influenced by these experiences, he became opposed to all forms of war and nationalism. After the breakdown of his marriage, he suffered again from depression, underwent therapy, and turned to watercolour painting. He was horrified by the outbreak of the Second World War; the National Socialists classified his novels Beneath the Wheel and Steppenwolf as degenerate and banned them, and his publisher Peter Suhrkamp was arrested. Herman Hesse continued to write in opposition to Hitler, but the texts could only be published after the end of the war.\n\nHermann Hesse died on 9 August 1962 in Montagnola in Switzerland."
