        "text": "George Wallis Field\n\n(1914-2002)\n\nProfessor of German, Victoria College, University of Toronto, 1948-1979, [ ] died suddenly, on Wednesday, December 18, 2002, while swimming at Hart House, U of T, in his 89th year. [ ] Devoted to Victoria College and the University of Toronto, widely published author and worldrenowned scholar of German literature, specializing in Goethe, Schiller, Heine and especially the works of Hermann Hesse. He was a true renaissance man, passionate about classical music, ballet, Japanese art and culture, sports, fishing, swimming and spending time at his beloved Georgian Bay. He possessed a keen and powerful intellect, always ready to debate both current issues and historical events. He delighted all who knew him as a wonderful story teller with amazing attention to detail and ever present humour. Born in Cobourg in 1914, one of his earliest memories was witnessing the victory celebrations at the end of the Great War. Graduated from U of T in 1935, recipient of the Gold Medal, taught high school in Bradford, Ontario and then at the Canadian Academy in Kobe, Japan from 1938-1940. He obtained his MA and PhD from U of T upon his return from the Second World War. He commenced his long and distinguished teaching career at U of T in 1948. The Professor G.W. Field Scholarship Fund has been established in his memory and donations may be made to Victoria University Alumnae Office, 150 Charles St. West, Toronto, Ontario) M5S1K7. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held in the Victoria College Chapel on Friday, January 31st, at 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe Seattle Times\n\nSunday, June 30, 2002\n\nShow describes hellish journey of cult author Hesse\n\nVisitors toured an exhibition titled Hellish Journey Through Myself in the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. The show gave an overview of the life of Nobel Prize-winning author Hermann Hesse\n\nby Hanns Neuerbourg\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nZURICH, Switzerland  The novel, purportedly written by a man named Emil Sinclair, immediately won a literary award when it was published in 1919. But the winner of the prize, reserved for first works, returned it since he was no newcomer to the literary scene.\n\nOnly in the mid-1920s did the author of the self-exploring Demian reveal his true identity: Hermann Hesse. Half a century later, Hesses books became cult favorites for millions worldwide, above all young readers.\n\nNow, on the 125th anniversary of his birth, the life and work of Hesse, one of the most widely read German-speaking novelists and poets, are themes for numerous shows, conferences and other events throughout the world.\n\nCompeting for special attention are Calw, the picturesque German Black Forest town where he was born July 2, 1877, and Zurich, in his adopted homeland, Switzerland, where all of his Nobel Prize-winning prose was written.\n\nThe Zurich exhibition at the Swiss National Museum claim[ed] to be the largest presentation. Its title, Hellish Journey Through Myself. [was] excerpted from a résumé Hesse wrote in 1924. It point[ed] to decades of struggle to overcome personal crises.\n\nOn view [were] first editions of his books as well as paintings, texts, letters and memorabilia. The focus [was] on Siddhartha and Steppenwolf, two key novels by the prolific writer, whose works have been translated into almost 60 languages.\n\nTwo revolvers stuck to the wall of one room recall Hesses flirtation with suicide, which began when he was a teenager. He bought his first handgun at age 15 in a mental clinic where his austerely Pietist parents had put their rebellious son after he escaped from a Protestant seminary.\n\nNext to the arms [was] a letter in which he accuses his father of having robbed him of the zest of life. By then, he had already long decided that he wanted to become a poet or nothing at all, as he would remember in his résumé.\n\nHis first novel, Peter Camenzind, a back-to-nature call in response to growing industrialization published when he was 27, was already a success  as was the life of Buddha and reflecting Hesses studies of Indian and Chinese philosophy. It was only with Steppenwolf, his novel about a romantic anti-establishment loner, that Hesse found relative peace, according to Zimmermann.\n\nThe publication of Steppenwolf, on his 50th birthday, can be considered as a symbolic end of the hellish journey, Zimmermann writes. Hesse has reached the highest degree of self-awareness and self-discovery possible to him.\n\nArtistic installations at the show are designed to transmit emotionally the message of the two novels to visitors.\n\nHesse once thought of dropping writing for painting. Some 20 of his nearly 3,000 watercolors, chiefly landscapes, are on view. He also was a compulsive writer of letters  more than 35,000. Many are responses to letters from readers or are correspondence with friends. Some of those displayed seem bizarre, such as a 1934 letter to a wealthy supporter in which he enclosed a pair of pants and asked for two more pairs of the same kind.\n\nAfter World War I, Hesse settled in Montagnola in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino and obtained Swiss citizenship. He rarely left his retreat in the tiny village. In 1946, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his inspired writings which exemplify the classical humanitarian ideals and high qualities of style.\n\nHe died in his sleep of a brain hemorrhage Aug.9, 1962. In his bedroom, a gray cardboard box was found. It contained a revolver.\n\nTranslations of his works had been best sellers in Japan since the 1930s. But Hesses fame took worldwide dimensions only posthumously.\n\nAmerican interest was first largely limited to the academic community. But in the 1960s, the beat generation enthusiastically made Hesse its cult figure. And with LSD guru Timothy Leary recommending Siddhartha and Steppenwolf as helping to expand consciousness, some members of the counterculture considered Hesses work to be a psychedelic bible.\n\nDear Friends of \"Siddhartha\",\n\nFirst, there are many new playdates for Siddhartha around the country.
