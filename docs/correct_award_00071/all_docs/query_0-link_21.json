After the end of war, he returned to civilian life in 1919 and ultimately settled in Montagnola. The new ambience brought new wave of creativity within him and he describes 1920-24 as most prolific and most passionate period of his life. His novel Siddartha was written at this time.\n\nThe last and the longest novel written by Hermann Hesse was Das Glasperlenspiel (1943/49).
