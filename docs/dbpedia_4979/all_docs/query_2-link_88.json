        "text": "Assessing SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited's (SEHK:315) past track record of performance is a valuable exercise for investors. It enables us to reflect on whether the company has met or exceed expectations, which is a great indicator for future performance. Today I will assess 315's recent performance announced on 30 June 2019 and evaluate these figures to its longer term trend and industry movements.\n\nView our latest analysis for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nDid 315's recent earnings growth beat the long-term trend and the industry?\n\n315's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 30 June 2019) of HK$632m has increased by 2.8% compared to the previous year.\n\nFurthermore, this one-year growth rate has exceeded its 5-year annual growth average of -4.6%, indicating the rate at which 315 is growing has accelerated. What's the driver of this growth? Well, let’s take a look at if it is solely because of industry tailwinds, or if SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings has experienced some company-specific growth.\n\nIn terms of returns from investment, SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 12% instead. However, its return on assets (ROA) of 6.5% exceeds the HK Wireless Telecom industry of 6.3%, indicating SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings has used its assets more efficiently. Though, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings’s debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 15% to 11%.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThough SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings's past data is helpful, it is only one aspect of my investment thesis. Recent positive growth doesn’t necessarily mean it’s onwards and upwards for the company. I suggest you continue to research SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings to get a better picture of the stock by looking at:\n\nFuture Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for 315’s future growth?
