        "text": "Cleveland, OH – The Kennedy Group, a company with more than 20 years experience in applicator technologies, introduces three new SmartOne™ RFID Applicator systems in response to customer demand for a means to ensure that bad, or quiet smart labels are ejected before being applied. The systems have the ability to verify, encode and apply from 50 to 85 Smart Therm™ labels per minute for 900 MHz and 13.56 MHz applications.\n\nThe SmartOne RFID Applicator (Model 1000) combines its ability to identify and eject bad, or quiet, smart labels with high-speed (65 Smart Therm labels per minute, 50 with label eject) encoding and application technology to meet in-line encoding and application production requirements of retail, defense and consumer good suppliers. In addition, the SmartOne RFID Printer Applicator (Model 2000) incorporates a print engine for variable speed printing. The applicator is capable of verifying, encoding, printing and applying 45 Smart Therm labels per minute (30 per minute with label eject) and offers “Next Out” capability.\n\nIn November, The Kennedy Group will be introducing the SmartOne™ RFID Printer Applicator (Model 3000) with the quiet tag ejection feature. This high-speed printer applicator is anticipated to handle encoding, printing and applying up to 85 Smart Therm Labels per minutes (65 per minute with label eject). All of the SmartOne RFID Applicator systems are ideal in heavy industrial conditions, because they can easily be integrated into manufacturing and distribution environments.\n\n“The Kennedy Group is the one source for a total RFID solution,” said Patrick Kennedy, The Kennedy Group Vice President/Marketing & Sales. “Since we manufacture the Smart Therm™ labels that travel through our SmartOne applicator, we can provide the end user with the lowest total applied cost. In addition, we supply the testing, hardware, installation, service and support. We place the onus on ourselves that if an issue does occur, they can rely on us to be there.”\n\nThe new SmartOne RFID Applicators are also versatile. They can function with either top or side application and provides precise placement of The Kennedy Group’s Smart Therm™ labels on pallets and containers. Each applicator has a user-friendly operator interface, on-board diagnostics and is made of rugged construction for operation in harsh environments.\n\nSmartOne™ RFID Applicators can support a variety of EPC-compliant Smart Therm label sizes including 4” x 2”, 4” x 4”, 4” x 6” and 4” x 8” with Alien ‘squiggle’ tags; and Alien ‘M’ tags in 4” x 4”, 4” x 6” and 4” x 8” configurations. In addition, Smart Therm labels with Matrics Glass Bottom Tags in sizes 2” x 2”, 3” x 3”; and with Matrics Dual Dipole Class 0 and 0+ tags in sizes of 3” x 3”, 4” x 4”, 4” x 6”, and 4” x 8” can be supported. Smart Therm labels in the 13.56 MHz frequency also available in a variety of sizes. All Smart Therm labels are available with either general purpose or freezer grade adhesive approved by the FDA for indirect food contact.\n\nThe Kennedy Group’s Logistics and RFID Solutions Division is a leader in RFID technology, providing turnkey assistance in helping major manufacturers to test, specify, install, service and support their EPC-compliant, fully integrated systems.
