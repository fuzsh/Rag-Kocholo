        "text": "The following details an example of how this global GPS tracking device can be used in a commercial application.\n\nA rail transportation company wants to track several of their freight trains as they routinely travel between Chicago, Illinois and New Orleans, Louisiana. They make several stops along the way. The company would like to be notified regarding the location of the freight train once every hour. Additionally, they want to know when the train leaves one station and enters the next, as well as how long the train remains stopped at each station. They would also like to occasionally check in on the speed of the trains to ensure compliance with safety regulations.\n\nTo customize the notification settings to meet these demands, this rail transportation company would sign up for the 24 locates per day plan. This will provide them with a location report every hour. Geofences would be set up within a given radius around each train station, so the company is notified whenever the train enters or leaves said station. The online dashboard provides the duration of time the train has been stopped at one station for the loading and unloading of freight. The motion/vibration sensor will show movement reports as the train travels between the target locations. A compliance officer can also utilize the online dashboard to check the speed of the train at any given time."
