        "text": "Former President Trump said his 18-year-old son Barron is a “smart one” whom he trusts to advise him on politics.\n\nTrump said his youngest son, who will be making his debut in the political sphere at this year’s Republican National Convention, “likes” the industry. November will mark the first presidential election in which Barron is eligible to vote.\n\n“He’s seen it. He doesn’t have to hear. He is a smart one. He doesn’t have to hear much. But he’s, he’s a great guy,” Trump told “Kayal and Company” on Philadelphia’s Talk Radio 1210 WPHT on Friday. “He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one, but he is a good-looking guy.”\n\n“And he’s really been a great student,” he continued. “And he does like politics. It’s sort of funny. He’ll tell me sometimes, ‘Dad, this is what you have to do.’”\n\nThe former president added, “He’s a senior now in high school, and he’ll be going to college. And you know, a lot of, a lot of these choices of colleges are changing because you see what’s going on in the last month. Biden has totally lost control of the country.”\n\nBarron Trump was named as one of the 41 at-large Republican delegates to represent Florida at the convention in Milwaukee set to take place in July. During the convention, the party is expected to officially nominate Trump as the GOP presidential candidate, officially setting up a rematch against President Biden in November.\n\nThe younger Trump will be accompanied by three of the former president’s other children, including Eric, Tiffany and Donald Trump Jr., who will also serve as delegates.\n\nBarron Trump has spent most of his life kept outside of the political spotlight. He was 10 when his father was elected president in 2016."
