Is there a way to fix this? I registered the remote on the soundbar and seemed to work once but stoppped almost immediately.\n\nTotally with normal remote but Id rather use the smart one\n\n@steeble: On the TV, please can you confirm if you have been to Home > Menu > Connected device > Universal Remote, and registered the soundbar from here? If the issue persists, try adjusting the position of the soundbar, and make sure that there are no obstacles in front of the soundbar, or the Samsung logo on your TV."
