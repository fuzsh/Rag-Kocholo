        "text": "Super Micro stock sinks, CrowdStrike earnings on tap: Catalysts\n\nOn today's episode of Catalysts, hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from sinking shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) to the rising prices of cocoa (CC=F). Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock is under pressure after the company announced it was delaying its annual report. This move comes after claims from short seller Hindenburg Research alleging \"accounting manipulation\" at the company. Defiance ETFs CEO & CIO Sylvia Jablonski suggests that if SMCI can demonstrate they have the situation under control and their accounting is accurate, \"then this is a great buy on the dip opportunity.\" She highlights the stock's impressive growth over two years, the company's leadership in cooling data centers, and the upcoming 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for October. As consumers show continued signs of weakness and tighter budgets, HSBC has downgraded the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) as a whole. HSBC Global Chief Investment Officer Willem Sels explains that financially healthy consumers are spending more on services and leisure than discretionary items. However, he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between companies within the retail space: \"you want companies that have the pricing power because of their positioning.\" Toy giant Lego has reported double-digit sales growth year-over-year in the first half of 2024, rising by 13% in a \"toy market that's not growing right now,\" according to The Lego Group CEO Niels B. Christiansen. Christiansen sits down with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to talk about Lego's fundamental building blocks that continue to make the brand a standout among consumers. \"The appreciation of the fact that playing allows you to gain some skills and to really develop your brain, but also a lot of skills that you need through life, I think that's actually well appreciated by parents and kids really like it,\" Christiansen says, later adding: \"The Lego brand is just such a good bridge between digital and physical.\" The price of cocoa (CC=F) is still trading over 128% compared to a year ago due to increased weather incidents and crop disease which have led to supply shortages. Saxo Bank head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen explains why prices may be out of control for some time, perhaps as far ahead as 2026: \"That really is a combination of two things: first and foremost, that the farmers are receiving more for their product. They can spend more money on fertilizers and also pesticides, which is a key right now due to some diseases they have in some of the crops. But also that we see the weather continue to improve...\" Meanwhile, CrowdStrike (CRWD) will release its first earnings report since the massive software update triggered global IT outages in July. Citi US software equity research co-head Fatima Boolani notes that investors will be specifically looking at guidance as they look to rebuild their confidence in the company. \"There is absolutely an appetite for this company to frankly just throw the book at guidance, just every possible parameter or permutation that they can throw into guidance and frankly, de-risk the numbers is exactly what investors are looking for,\" she explains.

BNY Mellon global head of ETFs Ben Slavin joins Brad Smith in-studio to talk about the ETFs that could also be swayed through their exposures to Nvidia and the AI chip trade: \"One thing that's very important for investors really to understand is what those weights are in the ETFs they hold. Obviously, Nvidia, given the big run-up in the stock, is a significant weight in not just the S&P but a wide variety, several hundred ETFs that hold the stock. And so obviously, depending on which way things go here, you're going to see a big impact, and those ETFs are going to move.\" Slavin notes the gains actively managed ETFs have seen over passively managed funds. He also notes that a major risk more investors are reconsidering is their concentration in any big stock, namely the Magnificent Seven tech names., For more expert insight and the latest market action, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch this full episode of Wealth!

CFRA analyst Zachary Warring joins Morning Brief to discuss Abercrombie's results and how other retailers are faring in a tight consumer environment. \"Investors might be a little bit scared that this could be peak growth for them,\" Warring says of the stock's movement. However, he believes there are other catalysts for the retail name moving forward: \"The company has now got a clean balance sheet. They have no debt. So they have plenty of room over the next 12 to 24 months to buy back shares.\" He calls Abercrombie \"the best-performing apparel brand in the US right now,\" explaining its effective marketing on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. He believes the company has \"plenty of room to grow,\" although he expects growth to decelerate over the next two years. While many retailers have prioritized promotions and discounts as consumers increasingly seek value, Warring argues that Foot Locker (FL) \"is almost a complete opposite of Abercrombie.\" He notes that the footwear retail chain is battling long-term headwinds as Nike (NKE) experiences a significant slowdown. In addition, he explains that Foot Locker is closing stores globally and believes that \"there's at least a few more quarters of underperformance\" for the company.

Given the stock's outsized role in the recent bull market, Wall Street will be watching the results closely. Russell Investments president and chief investment officer Kate El-Hillow joins Morning Brief to give insight into how Nvidia's earnings will impact the market. El-Hillow states AI's impact will be felt beyond the major tech names: \"The application of it into different sectors... it's in the consumer areas, it's in the service areas where you can start to see it actually being applied. It's going to take longer for that to play out versus what we've seen with this hardware investment on the capex spend that's been happening, but it hasn't been priced in yet. So we do see more of an opportunity there.\" If Nvidia's earnings outperform, El-Hillow believes \"It gives you more conviction around the broadening out. If you know that there's still spending happening from a capex perspective, and people are trying to build out the infrastructure to do this, you feel more confidence that the only reason you're going to be doing that is because you see opportunity in terms of buyers on their end starting to invest more. So I do think it ends up giving that next push into a broadening of the rally.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) ended Tuesday's session in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average achieving a new all-time high for the second day in a row. Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders explains that the market's sky-high valuations are improving, largely due to the recent pullback. \"We did see a little bit of an easing in some of those mega-cap names. But we're still in the high 20s [percent] for the Magnificent Seven. So you are at that point, especially given we've seen some deterioration in third quarter consensus estimates relative to second quarter, that we are a bit in that show-me environment because of valuation expansion that predated this recent pullback.\" Josh Lipton and Seana Smith break down what to watch on Wednesday, August 28th, from Nvidia's (NVDA) second quarter earnings to commentary from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Yahoo Finance markets and data reporter Jared Blikre breaks down his top takeaways from the trading day as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) fell to the Rubicon and central banks continue buying up gold (GC=F). Shares of organic food brand Hain Celestial (HAIN) surged after reporting fiscal fourth quarter earnings results, beating its adjusted earnings per share estimates. Hain Celestial CEO Wendy Davidson argues that \"the trends are in our favor\" as consumers seek out healthier food options: \"We think we have a great brand portfolio that offers variety, offers multiple pack sizes. Our goal is to make it both available and affordable so that healthier living doesn't have to mean sacrificing taste or availability or affordability. And that's been the big focus for Hain in our in our transformation.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n\nCrowdStrike outlook appears 'absolutely solid' despite outage\n\nCybersecurity stocks are in focus this week, with SentinelOne (S) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) earnings giving investors a fresh read on the sector. TD Cowen senior analyst Shaul Eyal joins Market Domination to discuss the state of the cybersecurity industry and some of its key players. All eyes will be on CrowdStrike's earnings on Wednesday, as it will be the first report since a software defect caused a global outage in July. Eyal expects \"just a little bit of a haircut\" when it comes to the company's guidance for the second half of the year. \"I think that might, at the end of the day, show that the outage that we had seen back on July 19 was a major bump, but still a bump. And I think the long-term outlook for the company remains absolutely solid.\" On the other hand, Eyal is more cautious about Okta (OKTA) and maintains a Hold rating on the stock. Despite having two outages over the last 18 months, he believes that management could turn the company around. With more consistency, Eyal believes that Okta could eventually gain a Buy rating.
