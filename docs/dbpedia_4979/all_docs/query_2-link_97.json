        "text": "Wireless services provider SmarTone-Vodafone, unfazed by the economic crisis, has started an ambitious network expansion programme that promises to bring its subscribers the fastest mobile broadband service in Greater China by next year.\n\nThe 3G mobile network operator, with about 1.1 million subscribers in Hong Kong, has partnered with Swedish telecommunications equipment supplier Ericsson on the world's first pilot implementation of Mimo - for multiple input, multiple output - smart antenna technology.\n\nMimo, pronounced 'mee-moh', will enable SmarTone-Vodafone to deliver 3G mobile broadband transmission speeds of up to 28 megabits per second next summer and 42Mbps by the end of next year - advances that would help realise the potential of 3G services in Hong Kong.\n\nSmarTone-Vodafone's network currently provides peak data rates of 14.4Mbps, compared with up to 7.2Mbps for other local 3G mobile network operators.\n\n'This pilot project will further extend the company's leadership in mobile network performance and expand the boundaries of the digital lifestyle,' said Douglas Li, chief executive of SmarTone-Vodafone.\n\nThe faster speeds mean increased use of capacity by the operator - allowing a large number of customers to enjoy high-speed mobile broadband service simultaneously without compromising on quality - and shorter downloading time for 3G mobile phone subscribers to rival the desktop computing experience on fixed-line broadband networks, Stephen Chau Kam-kun, the company's chief technology officer, said.\n\nMimo uses multiple antennas to boost the efficiency of both the transmitter (the cellular base station) and receiver (the handset), which significantly improves wireless data throughput and range of connection without the operator having to add bandwidth or transmission power.\n\nJohan Adler, president at Ericsson Hong Kong and Macau, described Mimo as an essential component of the future of high-speed mobile networks, which will evolve from the current collection of High-Speed Packet Access mobile telephony protocols to the so-called Long-Term Evolution (LTE) 4G standard.\n\nMatts Olsson, president at Ericsson Greater China, said: 'With the imminent implementation of 3G on the mainland, the experience we have shared with SmarTone-Vodafone and the Mimo pilot will help us ensure a successful deployment of 3G and LTE in the whole Greater China region.'\n\nTechnology consulting firm Ovum says caution may be inevitable for operators during the economic downturn, but a more aggressive strategy is advisable for those with tangible resources.\n\n'Even in the darkest reaches of a recession, clients will continue to expect quality services delivered at appropriate pricing levels, with continual improvements to both,' said Eamonn Kennedy, practice leader of Ovum's information technology services team.\n\nMr Chau said: 'This [Mimo] initiative will ultimately cost SmarTone-Vodafone tens of millions of [Hong Kong] dollars.'\n\nThe company, a partner network of global mobile telecommunications giant Vodafone Group, expects consumers to be able to experience the improvements on its network soon, as brand-name handset models supporting downlinks of up to 10.2Mbps, such as those from Nokia, will be available by February.\n\nMr Chau said the more efficient use of its network would allow SmarTone-Vodafone to encourage more households to give up their fixed-line telephone links and adopt its alternative wireless service."
