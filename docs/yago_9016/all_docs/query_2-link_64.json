        "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 24/09/2010 (5078 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nTORONTO — In the realm of the English-Canadian movie, a sequel is as rare as an Arctic orchid — or to coin a less florid metaphor, as rare as a money-making English-Canadian movie.\n\nBut it was a no-brainer, in more ways than one, to make Fubar II, a sequel to director Michael Dowse’s no-budget 2002 mockumentary. The story of a pair of hapless, vandalism-inclined headbangers named Terry and Dean, Fubar was a success story due to the fact the digitally-shot original movie cost practically nothing to make. Improv actors David Lawrence and Paul Spence, who played Terry and Dean respectively, interacted with regular people who presumably bought into the premise that a documentary crew was following these guys around to capture the reality of blue-collar life.\n\nThe actors and a few of their onscreen co-conspirators were so hilariously accurate in their depiction of headbanger lifestyle and idiom (such as their trademark expression “Give’r”), the film actually made money.\n\n“It made money for Alliance,” corrects director Dowse, referring to the film’s Canadian distributor. “It did well, especially on DVD. That’s where it really found its market.”\n\nWhile the sequel is likewise shot on digital video and has a documentary feel, it abandons the mock-doc format, but maintains the core of improvised comedy as Calgary-based Terry and Dean decide to earn some serious money working up north in the Alberta oil sands of Ft. McMurray (a.k.a. The Mac) at the encouragement of their conspicuously moneyed friend Tron (Andrew Sparacino). (The movie was briefly known as Fubar II: The Wrath of Tron.)\n\nDowse, Lawrence and Spence wrote a 30-page treatment and instead of relying on non-actors, hired some 40 actors, all at ease in the territory of improvisation.\n\n“We had practically no budget on the first one and on this one, we just wanted to do bigger stunts and just make it bigger and be able to do things like go to West Edmonton Mall, while keeping the style of it the same,” says Dowse.\n\nThe popularity of the first film, especially in Western Canada and especially among younger people, may have necessitated that Terry and Dean move away from interaction with regular citizens, but that wasn’t really on their agenda anyway, Spence says.\n\n“In a bar, people who drink tend to know who Dean is,” says Spence. “But I think, even if we could have interacted with more real people, I don’t know that it would have fit in with the way we shot this film.”\n\nFriends since childhood, Spence and Lawrence actually had experience working on northern pipeline crews, which partially inspired the creation of Fubar II. Dowse adds stories of real pipeline workers fed into the reality of the film.\n\n“The (assistant director) had a story about a welder that he worked with for about three months. The guy was the epitome of a functioning alcoholic,” Dowse says. “His ritual was he’d go to work and then he’d go and get plastered, and then he’d get home to his motel and he would fill up the bathtub with hot water and jump in with a two-six of vodka and drink himself to sleep in a warm bathtub. The idea was that in four hours, it would be cold enough to wake him up to get him up to go to work, and that’s what he did,” Dowse says. “There’s so many stories like that.”\n\n“Working in that isolated world, that kind of added into it,” Lawrence says. “Probably every single job I had since I’ve been 14, somehow I was working beside a headbanger-type guy. And they were always the fun-loving guys, always the best guy to hang out with,” he says. “So to imitate them and take their best elements and turn that into a character, that was kind of a treat.”\n\nLess of a treat was realizing the oft-punishing physical slapstick endured by Terry and especially Dean during the course of the movie.\n\n“I really was rolling around on pine needles in -30 C weather in my underwear in Edmonton,” says Spence. “That’s not a stunt guy.”\n\nrandall.king@freepress.mb.ca"
