        "text": "Terry and Deaner take their hard-partying antics to Fort Mac\n\nSept. 27 7 p.m. Plaza\n\nYou’d best believe that every opportunity we had over the last eight years to just give’r we gave’r. We shotgunned Pilsener smoked Export As smashed up bus shelters finger-banged with mad abandon — you name it. But it just hasn’t been the same without Terry and Dean.\n\nIntroduced in Michael Dowse’s hard-partying mockumentary FUBAR the two Calgary headbangers turned up the good and turned down the suck to spectacular and hilarious effect. Together they faced down challenges such as their own near-constant state of inebriation and Dean’s tragic case of “nut cancer.” For Terry and Dean’s troubles — and those of the dudes who played them Dave Lawrence and Paul J. Spence — they became hoser icons to a generation of comedy fans.\n\nAnd now they have returned for FUBAR II the sequel that actually deserves those fancy Roman numerals. Presented at the Calgary International Film Festival ahead of its national release on October 1 it is more than funny enough (and raw enough) to fulfil the expectations of the denim-clad legions who have embraced Dean and Terry as models to live by.\n\nDowse — who originally developed the film around a comedy routine that the duo developed at the Loose Moose Theatre Company when they were living in Calgary — believes that the appeal of Dean and Terry goes deeper than you might think.\n\n“Their camaraderie and their friendship are the essential things” says Dowse over the phone from his Montreal home. “I think that’s what appeals to everybody outside of the humour and the partying. Deep down inside they’ve all had friends like that who they care about no matter what.”\n\nFor FUBAR’s creators to see their improvised no-budget effort develop cult-classic status over the course of the decade was both gratifying and unexpected. “I couldn’t ask for a better run on a first film that we made with no money” says Dowse. “As soon as it hit video it just got a life of its own. Our original idea was to release it on 200 VHS tapes and leave them around Calgary and see what would happen. I am pleasantly surprised to know that some people have now seen it 100 times piss-drunk.”\n\nWhile in Toronto for FUBAR II’s recent world première Lawrence and Spence say they saw how the original movie continues to make new converts. “There are a lot of kids going to college or university” says Lawrence “And I’m sure once they settle into their dorm somebody says ‘Wanna see something?’ And then they watch FUBAR and shotgun Pilsners.”\n\n“It’s cool too because people are turning 16 or 17 every day… I think” adds Spence with a laugh. “And those people are watching it for the first time. It’s like finding booze for the first time in a way — not to give too much weight to what FUBAR is but in a sense they are related. And the first time you watch it particularly as a Canadian you’re like ‘That’s a Canadian movie and it’s actually funny?’”\n\nMany Pilsner-addled fans have somehow memorized every line of FUBAR — truly a Herculean feat. But a sequel wasn’t necessarily in the cards or at least not until recently.\n\n“It was definitely something we didn’t want to do right away” says Dowse. “It was five years later when we said ‘Well it’s a privilege to make a movie and we could probably finance this movie in about half an hour so why don’t we explore it and see what happens?’”\n\nA new setting helped give Terry and Dean plenty of fresh comedic potential. Their latest misadventures take place in Fort McMurray somewhere that may be too wild for even them to handle. As Dowse says the setting boasts “a great mix of low-class guys and high-class wallets” therefore proving to be a perfect milieu for the characters. (The film itself could only afford to shoot there a few days — the rest was done in Edmonton last winter.)\n\nSince Lawrence and Spence both worked pipeline jobs when they were younger they have first-hand knowledge of Fort Mac’s brand of madness. “It can be a fun place but most guys up there are slogging through the daily grind and then getting trashed on the weekend. There’s not a lot to do up there. I don’t know if the city of Fort McMurray would agree with how we portrayed the lifestyle but it’s fairly truthful.”\n\nAdds Spence “When you read about the oilsands and the boom up there it’s always just a picture and then they talk to one average Joe on the street to get his story. I think it’s so much more than that. It should be a city of 60000 but it’s more like 200000 so there’s no room for everybody except there are tons of jobs around. It’s a weird thing because it’s Friday night and you know that in 48 hours you’re going back to working 16-hour days. Your mantra is to get obliterated that night.”\n\nTheir bond is threatened by fresh pressures including a new girlfriend for Terry (played by fellow Loose Moose alum Terra Hazelton) and a new crisis for Dean. But what’s most satisfying about the new movie is just how emotionally raw it turns out to be. Like the original FUBAR II is not just another lowbrow showcase for foul-mouthed buffoons — in fact even hardcore fans may be surprised at how dark and despairing some scenes can get.\n\nAnd though the budget increase meant the FUBAR team could work on a bigger scale and do more stunts — the house-party mayhem in the opening scene is truly magnificent — Dowse and pals essentially used the same improv-heavy methodology as they did in the first movie.\n\n“We just tried to approach it in the same way” he says. “Even though you have more money it can bring more problems. One of the big things I wanted to see carry forth from the first film was the spirit in which we shot it. We wanted to make a film that was as good as the first one but is better in other ways and could stand alone and be its own thing. I hope we succeeded. I’m really proud of it.”\n\n“I just love the fucking movie” he adds.\n\nTerry and Dean’s devotees will soon be echoing the sentiment."
