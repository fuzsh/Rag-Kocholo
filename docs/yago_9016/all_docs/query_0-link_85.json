Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the Arts & Life section of today’s National Post\n\n,\n\nwe have a great interview\n\nwith Paul Spence and David Lawrence, also known as Dean and Terry from the cult hit\n\nFubar\n\n— and now,\n\nFubar 2\n\n(which comes out this Friday). But our reporter wasn’t able to squeeze in all the quotes she got from director\n\nMichael Dowse\n\n, who was at TIFF to promote the film.\n\nHere, below, are some extra tidbits from the Canadian filmmaker:\n\nOn the decision to make a sequel\n\n:\n\n“We didn’t want to tread the same ground all over again, but as time went on, there was more of a call to do a sequel and we said, ‘Well, let’s explore it and see what happens.’ We wrote something, we were pretty happy with it, and two years ago we got financing and went ahead. But we took that pressure from our fans pretty earnestly — none of us wanted to disappoint people and I don’t think we have.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

There’s no company signage, and besides, we were over 100 feet from a public road, which isn’t breaking any laws. But we came to the conclusion very early on that we’d never get clearance to get on that property, so we chose to have Terry and Dean work on a pipeline outside in the open air, as opposed to in an actual refinery or whatever. We also shot in Fort Saskatchewan, not in Fort McMurray. That was the only way we could do it. We also spent time in the editing room digitally erasing of a lot of logos.”\n\nOn making movies about jerks… lovable jerks, that is\n\n:\n\n“For me, I like characters that are assholes, but creative in how they’re assholes. With It’s All Gone Pete Tong\n\n, it was a mix of Jeff Bridges in\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nand Sean Penn in\n\nSweet and Low Down\n\n, where the guy’s obviously talented but he’s an asshole — that’s what I gravitate toward. It’s easy to make someone sympathetic because his dad died or there’s some outside thing that does it; but it’s more of a challenge with guys like Terry and Dean. It would all fall apart if it wasn’t funny, that’s for sure.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn carefully orchestrating all of the inebriated destruction\n\n:\n\n“That’s all carefully planned… it’s a safety issue. We wanted to open with a party and didn’t want it to feel like a beer commercial. Those nine minutes are there to answer the call of the sequel; it’s like a Bond film where you start with a huge action sequence and then get on with the main story. We wanted to fill the appetite of our fans.”\n\nOn newcomer Terra Hazelton, who plays love interest Trish\n\n:\n\n“Isn’t she amazing? Can you please focus on her and say in your writing how f—ing strong she is as an actress? She goes toe-to-toe with those guys and, man, she is just so good. She’d ever acted before, and on the first day, we stuck an M16 in her hand; two hours later we had her in a wave pool for three hours; then at the end of the day she’s in a motel hot tub with Dean. We just threw her into it.”\n\nOn the possibility of a third\n\nFubar\n\nfilm\n\n:\n\n“I think there will be a third in our future, but it’s too early to know where and what. But there are two new members of the family now, so it would probably be sort of like, banger parents. That’s the next phase of these guys’ lives.”\n\nOn what he’s doing next\n\n:\n\n“I’m in prep on a film called Goon\n\n; we start shooting Oct. 18th in Winnipeg. Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg wrote it. Basically it’s about a Jewish bouncer who’s touched by the fist of God and becomes an enforcer in a major hockey league.”\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
