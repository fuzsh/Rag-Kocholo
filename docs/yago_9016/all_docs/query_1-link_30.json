        "text": "He’s been back before but Arnold Schwarzenegger is back once more in Fubar, his new series now streaming on Netflix and his first foray into small-screen entertainment amid a career that’s already spanned five decades.\n\nOfficially announced back in 2020, this scripted live-action spy comedy looks set to bring Schwarzenegger into the streaming world with guns blazing. Throughout eight episodes, he'll star as a battle-hardened CIA spy who’s more than ready to slowly walk away from his last explosion, cigar in mouth.\n\nHowever, his plans suddenly change when he’s lured back into the line of fire for one last mission to rescue another operative that just so happens to be his own daughter.\n\nRead more: Arnie wishes he could run for President\n\nBased on a concept dreamed up by The Sopranos writer Nick Santora, Fubar (short for F*cked Up Beyond All Recognition), looks to set to hark back to Arnie’s storied history as a bonafide action icon, with plenty of bullet-heavy True Lies vibes and comedy moments utilising the funny bones he used to make films like Twins and Kindergarten Cop such a huge hits.\n\nFubar release date\n\nAll eight episodes of Fubar are now available to binge in their entirety on Netflix having landed on the streamer on Thursday, 25 May, 2023.\n\nFubar series reviews\n\nArnie's latest has blasted its way onto Netflix and reviews of his action-packed new series have started to arrive. They're mostly good too, with many critics praising the show's fondness for fun, action and silliness.\n\nYahoo UK: Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in the spy world in fun Netflix thriller (3 min read)\n\nThe Telegraph: Arnold Schwarzenegger proves there's no age limit on fun (2 min read)\n\nThe Guardian: Arnie’s a natural comedian in this unstoppably daft crime drama (4 min read)\n\nFubar plot\n\nIn Fubar, Schwarzenegger stars as Luke Brunner, a top-secret CIA operative and veteran spy who’s seen his fair share of action all while keeping his exploits hidden from his loving family back home.\n\nHowever, just as he’s ready to embrace retirement, he’s called in to help with one final job involving another clandestine spy that just so happens to be his daughter Emma.\n\nWith each unaware of the other’s secret professions, the mission turns out to be an unlikely bonding experience for father and daughter as they work together to take down an evil that threatens the world.\n\nSchwarzenegger explained his decision to sign on to the project in Netflix’s official Fubar announcement. “Everywhere I go, people ask me when I’m going to do another big action comedy like True Lies,” he said. “Well, here it is.”\n\nRead more: Schwarzenegger fans as actor makes TV debut\n\nMeanwhile, show creator Santora shed some light on what viewers can expect from the show: “Fubar is, by far, the most surreal project of my career,\" he admitted.\n\n“I grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films — I’d hit my dad up for a few bucks so I could race to the movies and see the biggest star in the world on the big screen — so creating the first scripted television project for Arnold is unbelievably exciting for me.”\n\nHe added: “The thing I always marveled at was how Schwarzenegger could be funny while still kicking ass... that’s why I wanted Fubar to be a hysterical, CIA-spy comedy mixed with heart-stopping action! And it is all that — and more. I’d love to elaborate with more details, but sorry, it’s classified.”\n\nFubar cast\n\nSchwarzenegger fronts this spy series as CIA operative and part-time family man Luke Brenner with Top Gun: Maverick actor Monica Barbaro appearing as his secret agent daughter Emma.\n\nComedian Fortune Feimster and star of You season three, Travis Van Winkle, make up agents in Luke’s crack CIA team, with Fabiana Udenio playing the ex that he’s still chasing.\n\nMeanwhile, the likes of Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Barbara Eve Harris and Gabriel Luna are all confirmed to star throughout the series’ eight episodes, with a guest appearance from Schwarzenegger’s True Lies co-star Tom Arnold also confirmed to take place.\n\nFubar trailer\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, “Fubar will kick your ass and make you laugh” — and that’s exactly the vibe we get from its first full trailer.\n\nBefore this, we got a first look back when the series was initially announced earlier this year, with Schwarzenegger in full cigar-chomping action man mode."
