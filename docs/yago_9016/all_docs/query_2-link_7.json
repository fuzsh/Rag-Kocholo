        "text": "Welcome, dear Canconheads. This time, it’s about Goon.\n\nGoon is a 2011 Canadian sports movie directed by Michael Dowse, who also directed Fubar, a Canadian cult classic that a boy once tried to make me watch on a date but we had to turn it off because I was too stressed (interesting that so many Cancon cult productions are about boys being dudes… very interesting). Since his Cancon legend origins he’s gone on to produce a bit more Cancon but has largely veered into American territory with Stuber (sounds a lot like Fubar, eh?) and Take Me Home Tonight.\n\nGoon was also written by Canadian comedy bros Evan Goldberg and Jay Baruchel (the latter of whom also co-stars in the film, and directs the sequel, The Last of the Enforcers). Along with Baruchel, the film features Seann William Scott as the lead, Liev Schrieber, Allison Pill, Eugene Levy, and Marc-Andre Grondin (who I fully thought was Gaspard Ulliel for the entire movie).\n\nGoon is the charming tale of aimless himbo Doug Glatt (Scott), the titular goon, from Massachusetts who doesn’t fit in with his smart doctor family. He’s super strong and super nice and super dumb and after beating up a homophobic guy at a hockey game he gets recruited to a minor league hockey team in his hometown, where he is an “enforcer” (i.e. the guys who beat up other guys to make the game interesting). Because Doug is so good at beating people up and protecting people, he is then recruited to the “Halifax Highlanders”, another, higher-grade (?) team considered to be one step down from the NHL.\n\nAlong for the ride are Doug’s best friend Pat (Baruchel), who has a local-access show called “Hot Ice” where the Trailer Park Boys cameo as his production team, Eva (Allison Pill), Doug’s love interest who has a boyfriend and Xavier LaFlamme (Grondin), who is the star player of the Highlanders and who, in my opinion, is too skinny to convincingly play a hockey player. Liev Schrieber (extreme handsomeness to be honest) plays a famous minor-league enforcer whose story mirrors and parallels Doug’s rise.\n\nI really like Goon!! It’s sort of like a sports parody film like Blades of Glory, except it actually depicts hockey (and the role of the ‘enforcer’) mostly accurately and isn’t as homophobic. I love the first half, and the second half is just ok.\n\nThe first half sort of posits ‘enforcers’ as this sort of silly and insane role in the world, and gets a lot of humour from the senseless violence of it. But the second half seems to want to switch into taking Doug, and his role as an enforcer, really seriously in a way that doesn’t really jel with the rest of the movie. I think it could have ridden the train all the way to the end, but it injects a level of seriousness in the final act that I didn’t care for. I also don’t really buy into the senselessness of the enforcer role, and I don’t think a lot of the audience would either, which is why I think it should have kept with the parody vibes.\n\nIt would have almost been better as a My Big Fat Greek Wedding, i.e. having no actual plot conflict, just a series of events that are really fun to watch with the mere suggestion of conflict. It would be especially fun because Doug is really really good at being an enforcer, and to me watching someone be unambiguously talented at something is one of cinema’s great pleasures.\n\nI love Doug. He’s an amazing protagonist, and I think Seann William Scott does a great job being a big ol dumb sweetie. My favourite parts of the movie are his interactions with Eva, his ‘puck bunny’ love interest. Doug is so nice to Eva, and Eva can’t resist his handsome dumb hockey ways, despite having a boyfriend! I’ve been feeling very romantic lately and their meet-cute was a sweet little serotonin rush for me.\n\nI love that this movie celebrates the himbo. I think we’d all be a little bit happier as a society if more boys tapped into Doug’s non-toxic energy. The other guys are grouchy and lonely and mean, but Doug is kind to everyone who deserves it, and doesn’t hold other people’s flaws against them, and his main goal is just to fit in and help the people he cares about. What a guy! I smiled a lot watching Doug, especially when he meets Eva at a cafe wearing a paisley button down.\n\nI also (mostly) appreciate this movie for its place in Cancon: its modestly successful, entertaining, and authentically plays tribute to Canadian culture while also appealing to an international audience with non-Canadian stars. Its broey, but like Letterkenny, in a less toxic way than in what I might expect of a movie like this. Maybe it’s the association with Canada that made the writers make a more gentle movie. It’s nice to see a movie like this make small waves.\n\nHowever, Goon definitely perpetuates a certain idea of Canadianness, and is part of the saturation of Cancon with content about broey/moronic white guys. I think only two girls talk in the whole movie. There’s racism, homophobia, the works. With movies made before 2018 I typically don’t pass judgement (or I technically do, I just know my judgement won’t change it and appreciate that public opinion of what is and isn’t acceptable has changed drastically in the past ten years). But it does suck that so much Cancon is made from a very specific perspective that I bet not even that many cis men completely identify with. I hope that fun movies like Goon continue to be made. However, I hope that other, more interesting and rare stories are elevated and prioritized over ones like this, so there is more to choose from and people inside and outside of Canada get to see more of us.\n\nOverall, this is a great ‘winter movie’ to watch and feel cozy after Christmas has passed, like Doctor Zhivago or Mon Oncle Antoine (just kidding don’t watch that). I recommend this movie if you miss the unique smell and temperature profiles of a community skating rink.\n\nSeven and a half out of ten rinkside fistfights."
