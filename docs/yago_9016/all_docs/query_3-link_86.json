        "text": "\"What the fuck?\" - Kareem\n\nI spent most of the film rooting for the kid to get maimed.\n\nSomeone decided to bring back the cop/little kid buddy comedy because nothing matters anymore. Coffee and Kareem is a highly forgettable joyless slog of a film that probably just shouldn't have been made. The script is very weak and a good performance by Betty Gilpin is all that separates this from being a 1/2 star film for me. Terrence Little Gardenhigh is given one of the least funny child actor roles in recent memory and Ed Helms is at his worst. The racial humor is cringe as fuck and the action is lame.\n\nIt's bad.\n\nIt's called Coffee & Kareem, what the fuck are you expecting.\n\nI mean, sure. Michael Dowse has directed a few fun films. Ed Helms, Taraji P. Henson and Betty Gilpin should make it worth a watch.\n\nBut that title really is an indicator of how desperately shit this is, and no amount of Gilpin throwing everything she can into this makes any difference at all. It's absolutely dreadful and that is the most annoying kid in the last 20 years of cinema, at least.\n\nPlease take into consideration that this is the sort of thing I spend half my reviews defending here on Letterboxd too. So if I say it's total bollocks, then you should be extremely worried.\n\nFucking hell, Netflix. We're all stuck at home and this is the wank you feed us. Give us series two of Russian Doll you fucking bellends, nobody asked for this.\n\nThis is kind of...good? And...funny? Like, it has...jokes? That...land? And...bits? That...develop...and...pay off?\n\nIt's not a great film comedy by any means but I was struck by how much more craft went into the gags here than in the vast majority of studio comedies (including every other film to feature Ed Helms in a starring or supporting role). The \"act gay\" bit, for example, is the kind of thing that most of these kind of movies would use strictly as an excuse for an incongruously young child to say a bunch of homophobic slurs and then be dropped. Here, they bring it back and elaborate on it, and heighten it until it culminates in a genuine, surprising, laugh-out-loud moment. The kid is trying WAY too hard, but even he has a few decent punchlines. Could this be the first spring roots of a new comedy renaissance? Or a wink into the abyss? I know where my money is!\n\n\"There’s so much more to women than just sex.\"\n\n…and there’s so much more to a good comedy than just swearing.\n\nHave you ever seen an obnoxious one-joke movie that shotguns nothing but obscenities as loud as it can because it can’t seem to think of anything else to do?\n\n….I have.\n\nBy the way how many times does Betty Gilpin have to be the best thing about a movie before we finally give her something worthy of her talent?\n\n\"We took a classic and just set it on fire.\n\nIt’s kinda like a coke brûlée.\"\n\nCinematic Time Capsule - 2020 Ranked\n\nNetflix Originals Ranked\n\n2020 First Time Watches Ranked\n\n\"Coffee ain't dirty. He's the one cop you can trust. That's why he's so broke and sad.\"\n\nI won't deny that I laughed a few times but the sheer pointlessness of this movie was infuriating by the last stretch and doubled how stir-crazy I've been feeling lately. I just know that every time a lazy, brainless lowest common denominator trifle is unleashed upon us, we slide closer to our species' extinction-level event.\n\nP.S. Betty Gilpin, I'm so sorry you were told to overact in this.\n\nP.P.S. The things I will do for Taraji. The women in this movie just deserve so, so, soooo much better."
