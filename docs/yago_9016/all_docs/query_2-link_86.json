Its exploitation is both central to our economic wellbeing and raises uneasy questions about our relationship to the environment that has been so essential to Canadian identity; based on the policies, protests and politics that surround it, it seems fair that we could call the last decade or so Canada’s era of oil sands (or tar sands or whatever, shut up).\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

Though it would also be fairly easy to complain about a film industry that mostly seems to forget that Canada’s borders have changed some since 1867, in honestly seems unlikely that anyone will ever more perfectly capture the dirtbag heart of the Alberta boom than Terry and Deaner and the comedic genius who breathes them to life, Michael Dowse.\n\nThough Dowse has had no shortage of popular support since the first Fubar, he remains a thoroughly underappreciated filmmaker, a deft auteur in a time when comedy direction too often just means picking from improvised scenes in an editing suite. It’s no stretch to call him the funniest director Canada has produced in two decades; he might also be the funniest in North America.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt can be hard to immediately notice this, if only because the surface of Dowse’s work can be so pleasantly overwhelming. Fubar, particularly the first one, is an exceptional example. It’s easy to get lost in Terry and Dean’s f-bomb-heavy idiocy, and there’s no shortage of Pil-swilling honorary ‘Bertans who may not fully appreciate the joke.\n\nAs anyone who has ever known an improv troupe can attest, though, if it was just a matter of putting outrageous characters on screen, we’d have four Fubars a year. Dowse, though, even in his first steps as a filmmaker, is acutely aware of the rhythms of speech, and shoots and cuts Fubar (and its sequel) for maximum effect. He is a smart enough director to know that Dean’s mom reading his metalhead poetry just needs an isolated voice, and to constantly undercut Terry and Dean’s more ridiculous flights of grandiose drunken fantasy with ironic or static images, grounding these uber-hosers in prosaic, deflating reality.\n\nThat sense of place is also key to Dowse’s effect, and its no surprise that his best work has involved evoking very particular worlds, be it Fort Mac or minor league hockey. (I’ll elide It’s All Gone Pete Tong and Take Me Home Tonight except to say that they’re better than their lukewarm reception fully warrants.) The only competition Goon has a hockey movie is Slap Shot; where that could rest pretty comfortably on the charisma of Paul Newman and a gang of misfits, Dowse manages to inject a bruiser humanity into the creaky oak of Seann William Scott and Liev Schreiber. And doing George Roy Hill one better, Dowse captures the head rush action of hockey as well as the mind-fuck sadness of living it up in the minors.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBoth of those talents are evident in his latest, The F Word, an entirely charming and thoroughly modern romantic comedy, which just premiered at TIFF. Working off a script that is structurally too conventional and with dialogue that, in the wrong hands, could sound like watered-down Diablo Cody, Dowse actually might have made his most complete film yet.\n\nDowse is good at comedy because he is good at capturing characters in a particular place, and then letting them speak their piece\n\nFor a start, he turns Toronto into a viable romantic destination, and with none of the stuffy intellectual fantasy that Sarah Polley required in Take This Waltz: he finds the private moments of budding love among quiet, treed streets and along the city’s edge (all the more impressive given that the Don Valley, which this film spends a lot of time walking along, is essentially an overgrown ditch). More importantly, though, he evokes the easy banter of the screwball era, giving Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan the room to breathe through their lines, turning something obviously written into a palpable connection. That it is also funny goes without saying, although it’s particularly notable for also being considerably more quiet than Dowse’s previous work.\n\nThis not only has a way of drawing attention to the underlying structures in all Dowse’s work, but is also suggestive of his potential: Dowse is good at comedy because he is good at capturing characters in a particular place, and then letting them speak their piece. That is a talent that can take you an awful lot further than Fort McMurray.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
