        "text": "It’s nearing the end of a conversation with director Michael Dowse in downtown Calgary when he seems to veer from the rules of the indie-filmmaker handbook. Specifically, it’s that commandment that indie filmmakers see themselves as the uncompromising yin to the yang of big Hollywood spectacles. As it turns out, the towering former university football player harbours no such pretensions about his work. Hollywood? Bring it on.\n\n“They make great movies down there,” he says, in between bites of nachos. “They are real craftsmen. They are real film fans. They study it. They want it to be excellent. They want it to be a classic movie, which is great. You want to surround yourself with people like that.”\n\nThe former Calgarian has returned to his old stomping grounds as part of a promotional tour for his latest film, The F Word, a romantic comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan and Adam Driver that seems poised to give the director his biggest career push to date.\n\nAs the interview comes to a close over the remnants of what was a heaping plate of nachos—“Nobody makes nachos like Calgary,” he says—the 41-year-old shares an impressive list of upcoming projects he is working on, albeit in that vague manner required when discussing films that have yet to be officially green-lit.\n\nAmong them is an American film that he can’t talk about except to say that it is an American film. So we get a little more hypothetical. If Hollywood came calling with an offer to direct one of those expensive, seemingly impersonal, tent-pole action films—the type that indie filmmakers tend to rail against—would he be interested?\n\n“Absolutely,” Dowse says quickly. “I’m very comfortable doing action. Give me seven cameras and I’m very happy, for sure.”\n\nWith The F Word, which opens today in North America (in the U.S., it’s called What If), Dowse certainly seems to be at a crossroads in his career. It has received rave reviews from Rolling Stone and The Village Voice. Salon.com’s Andrew O’Hehir claims it “could be the breakthrough film that underappreciated Canadian director Michael Dowse has been waiting for.”\n\nMonths before the film was released, fan and movie sites were abuzz with rumours Dowse had been shortlisted by Marvel Studios to helm its upcoming, all-star superhero flick Ant-Man. (Alas, the job ultimately went to Yes Man’s Peyton Reed.)\n\nOn the one hand, Dowse seems a perfect fit for Tinseltown. A former jock who played offensive tackle for the University of Calgary’s Dinos, Dowse seems the ultimate team player in a town that, at least in blockbuster mode, seems ruled by compromise. He is affable but plain-spoken and adept at wrangling large ensemble casts. On the other hand, he can also be an exacting and stubborn director who has bumped heads with more than one producer in the editing suite. Most recently, he walked away from directing the mainstream and very Canuck comedy The Grand Seduction—despite having written the script, based on Ken Scott’s original Quebec film—due to “creative differences” with the producer. His only attempt at a “Hollywood” film to date, the universally booed ensemble comedy Take Me Home Tonight, sat on the shelf for four years and only recently became a topic that he is willing to discuss.\n\nIs Dowse ready for Hollywood? Is Hollywood ready for Dowse?\n\nCertainly, his career up to this point could be seen as a step-by-step journey to Tinseltown, starting with his 2002 no-budget, faux-documentary debut Fubar and arriving at a rom-com starring Harry Potter. Dowse has earned a reputation for scrappy indie comedies that take irreverent but heartfelt looks at loveable—and occasionally not-so-loveable—underdogs, whether they be the dim-bulb Calgarian headbangers Terry and Dean in Fubar and its sequel, or the dim-bulb hockey enforcer Doug Glatt in 2011’s Goon. Each new offering seemed to come with a bigger budget and more mainstream leanings.\n\nBut in the beginning, Fubar was a textbook example of defiant, aggressively DIY filmmaking, and about as far removed from Hollywood movies by committee as you are likely to get. Paid for with maxed-out credit cards and largely improvised by its actors, it nevertheless became an indie hit at Sundance and secured Dowse a spot in the rarefied world of Canadian auteurs. His films, which also include the comedy It’s All Gone Pete Tong, about a British DJ who is going deaf, are funny and entertaining, but usually have a darkness lurking beneath.\n\nWhile smartly written and well-acted, The F Word, on the other hand, could hardly be described as anything close to dark. Even if the Irish-Canadian co-production is not officially a Hollywood film, it has all the crowd-pleasing aspects of one.\n\nWhen compared to the F-bomb-dropping, beer-swilling antics of Fubar or those of Goon’s quick-fisted titular lug played by Seann William Scott, the romantic misadventures of Wallace (Radcliffe) and Chantry (Kazan), played out against an idealized, gorgeously shot Toronto backdrop, make for what Dowse calls “a bit more of a patient film, a bit more grown-up.”\n\nBut it still fits into a bigger picture, he argues, when asked how it relates to his previous work.\n\n“I think there’s a consistency in the tone and the humour and the heart of the movie,” Dowse says.\n\nIt’s telling that Dowse laughs when asked to pinpoint the thematic and esthetic threads that link his films. He seems mildly amused by the notion he would spend any time at all pompously pondering how his body of work qualifies him as an auteur. Certainly there were clues early on that he took a somewhat tongue-in-cheek approach to certain aspects of his career. Fact-checkers need to be wary when looking for autobiographical tidbits about Dowse online, as there are still a few bios floating around that are less than accurate. He did not, for example, earn an MBA from Yale, as a few early bios reported. Despite online claims to the contrary, he has two, not six children, and he clearly did not sever the pinky and ring fingers on his left hand during a freak accident on the set of Fubar. Still, his early work has been subject to serious academic study over the years. University of Calgary film professor George Melnyk includes Fubar in his new book, Film and the City: The Urban Imaginary in Canadian Cinema, as an example of Calgary’s “young, comic and discontented” cinematic identity. In the Young, the Restless and The Dead: Interviews with Canadian Filmmakers, also edited by Melnyk, Dowse is described as “representing the new globalized generation of Canadian film directors for whom there are no territorial boundaries in the creative consciousness.”\n\nDowse’s own reading of his work is far more down-to-earth.\n\n“I think even if I was doing something a little more dramatic, comedy would always sneak in there,” he says. “I just can’t seem to take anything that serious. I don’t think I can help myself in trying to make it funny.”\n\nBorn in London, Ontario to Irish immigrant parents, Dowse spent his early childhood shuttling between Ontario and England before the family settled in Calgary when he was eight. He says he was one of those kids who was forever showing up with a video camera to shoot footage of family and friends. Nevertheless, his first love was sports. It was only after he decided that a football career wasn’t in the cards in the 1990s that he turned his attention to film. He became an obsessive cinephile and even had a job slinging popcorn at now-closed Uptown Theatre in downtown Calgary, which specialized in arthouse fare. He joined the Calgary Society of Independent Filmmakers, eventually becoming the president of the board. It was a heady time for the organization. Fellow members included Robert Cuffley, who would go on to make films such as Walk All Over Me and Ferocious, and David Christensen, currently a producer and director at the National Film Board.\n\nIn 2000, Dowse found success with his short film 237 as a member of CSIF, and it became clear that he was destined “to do stuff,” says Christensen. While that drama, described as a “dark and voyeuristic” look at the history of a single hotel room, may seem to have little in common with his later comedies, it showcased a distinctive style and technical know-how that impressed his peers.\n\n“You could see that short was going to give him room to do the stuff that he wanted to do,” says Christensen. “I’ve seen a lot of shorts in my time and a lot of them are instantly forgettable and you realize you will never get that 10 minutes back again. But I still remember images from that film, 237. I can remember Mike screening a cut of it and being really impressed. There are a lot of people who talk but you don’t see a lot. Then there are people like Mike, who just seem to commit and do the work and make stuff happen.”\n\nBefore Fubar, there was a failed attempt at a dark comedy called Static, shot in a house that was earmarked for demolition to save on production costs. It was to star Calgary improv actor Dave Lawrence, who would go on to play Terry opposite Paul Spence’s Dean in the Fubar films.\n\nStatic was never completed, which only seemed to strengthen Dowse’s resolve.\n\n“He was almost like a linebacker, even when I first met him,” Lawrence says. “He would just say ‘We’re going.’ Even with Static, he applied (for funding) and didn’t get it and he said we’re making it anyway. The same with Fubar, he just said ‘let’s get it done.’ I think it takes that in a filmmaker, to never say die. So it didn’t surprise me at all that he went on to crank out those feature films he did. He has the mindset to just push when most people would probably bail.”\n\nIt was an attitude that drove Fubar to completion despite seemingly overwhelming odds. Dowse was already working steadily as a film editor at the time and was shooting segments for MuchMusic in Calgary. But after his experiences with Static, he was determined to make this feature film a reality no matter what the obstacles.\n\nWith no money, no script, no real story and very little crew, Dowse, Spence and Lawrence jumped in with both feet and began shooting reams of improvised scenes around Calgary in the summer of 2001.\n\n“I had tried to do a movie where you tried to do everything properly and by the book, where you get a crew and craft service and all that s–t,” Dowse said. “I said ‘I’m not doing any of that.’ We’re not going to try and raise money, we’ll just find money and just do it, literally, with me as the camera guy and a sound guy and those guys and we’ll just have fun. We just set a date and started shooting that August.”\n\nThe rest, of course, is Canadian cult-movie history. The adventures of Dean and Terry were set in Calgary’s grey suburbs and touched on dark subjects like cancer, death and alienation without ever losing its irreverent humour. It became a hit at Sundance in 2002 and eventually spawned a sequel. Afterwards, Dowse, Spence and Lawrence all fled to the seemingly greener cinematic pastures of Montreal. Lawrence eventually returned to Calgary, but Dowse remains in that city with his wife and two children.\n\nFubar gave him a high enough profile to attract the attention of Vertigo Films in Britain, leading to the next bizarre chapter in his cinematic life. He was given money to write and direct his sophomore effort, but it came with the oddball proviso that the film be set in the decadent, party-central Spanish island of Ibiza and be about DJ culture. It’s All Gone Pete Tong, which is Cockney rhyming slang for “It’s all gone a bit wrong,’ was released in 2005 and told the darkly comic story of a superstar DJ whose life falls apart after he begins to lose his hearing.\n\n“I hadn’t even been to Ibiza,” Dowse said. “So, yeah, it was a great challenge and a great experience.”\n\nPerhaps, but it also required Dowse to put his combative side to good use. In a 2005 interview with the National Post, the filmmaker said it was a stressful shoot due to the nonstop party atmosphere on the island. But things got even worse after filming was completed and the production company hired its own editor, taking creative control away from Dowse and placing him in the “absolute creative fight of my life.”\n\n“If he doesn’t like something, he will definitely tell you it sucks,” says Lawrence, who had a cameo alongside Spence in Pete Tong (they played Austrian metalheads). “Definitely, I’m sure he can be difficult to work with but that’s because he is fighting for something that he thinks is good. Producers might want him to do something but he will know (the film) better than them.”\n\nDowse’s cut eventually prevailed, and the film went on to win Best Canadian Feature at the Toronto International Film Festival. Unfortunately, there was no similarly happy ending for his followup, Take Me Home Tonight. Coming off of Pete Tong, it certainly sounded like a sure bet commercially, a graduation of sorts to a big American film. It was a Universal Studios project that starred Topher Grace, fresh from his successful run on television in That ’70s Show. It also starred Chris Pratt, Dan Fogler and Anna Faris, and told a nostalgic teenage tale of high-school life in the 1980s. The shoot, which took place in Phoenix in 2007, was a positive, reassuring experience, Dowse says. But things went seriously astray during the editing process.\n\nIn the end, it languished on the shelf for four years and went through numerous name changes before limping to a limited U.S. run and DVD release in 2011. At that point, Dowse flatly refused to talk about it.\n\nHe is a little more open about it these days, suggesting it was all a valuable learning experience that did not sour him on bigger-budget Hollywood productions.\n\n“What I learned a lot about was the politics of the edit suite,” he said. “You have to really, really be careful and protect your cut and fight a little more. I tried to be collaborative with people and be open to their ideas. I think everybody is legitimately trying to help your movie and it was just a good way to conduct yourself. But, on that one, I learned you have to say no, to fight for what you believe in. It taught me how to fight, actually.”\n\nHe won’t go into details about whom he was fighting exactly, saying only that there were “a lot of cooks in the kitchen.”\n\n“It toughens you up,” he said. “You pour your heart into something and have a good initial reaction and then everything goes haywire. The studio basically shelved it and sold it to another studio, and they recut it even more. You just repeat ‘whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ and you get through it. I’m a better director because of it.”\n\nCertainly, there seems little doubt that Dowse will be well-prepared for the attention and opportunities that may arise if The F Word is a hit. Having Radcliffe sign on—Dowse says he simply sent the actor a letter to get him involved—certainly pushed it into a higher stratosphere of commercial appeal than a Toronto-set rom-com may have otherwise enjoyed.\n\nBased on TJ Dawe and Michael Rinaldi’s one-act play Toothpaste and Cigars, it was written by Elan Mastai and had been floating around for a few years before Dowse was convinced to direct.\n\nShot in Toronto, it tells the deceptively simple tale of a sad-sack former med student (Radcliffe) relegated to the “friend zone” of a spirited but involved girl (Kazan) he meets at a party. It hits some requisite rom-com buttons, including a wacky best friend played by Driver and a “will-they-or-won’t-they” dynamic between the two leads. But it’s charming and sweet and leisurely paced, expertly conjuring up those years of romantic and career anxiety in your early 20s while giving the audience plenty of time to build empathy for its two protagonists.\n\n“I think what separates this film from a lot of them is that it’s actually funny and romantic,” Dowse says. “The comedy helps build the romance between the two of them, which, in my experience, is how you try to meet a girl. You try to make her laugh. The essence of most flirting is comedy. It also has just a really nice, simple structure that harkens back to old-school romances. Crazy things aren’t coming in and driving the plot. It’s a very nice slow boil that hopefully delivers an emotional punch.”\n\nBack in those early years in Calgary, when Dowse would devour arthouse fare at the Uptown and binge-watch foreign films he rented at the local video store, he admits to being drawn to the usual suspects of film, the dark, uncompromising auteurs.\n\n“I think when you first start out you get influenced by the classic greats, the Kubricks and the Scorseses and the Bergmans and the Fellinis,” he says. “As I get older, I start to appreciate the directors who had a huge range of movies and weren’t always successful but were really working-man directors.”\n\nDowse has certainly taken the “working-man” philosophy to heart. Along with the aforementioned American film, he also has a series in development with Amazon, is writing something for Fox and another screenplay based on a Parisian French movie. On top of that, there will likely be a sequel to Goon and a third instalment of Fubar. He is also toying with the idea of turning the further adventures of Dean and Terry into an animated series.\n\nFor inspiration these days, Dowse looks to directors who straddled genres and balanced commercial and artistic films: John Huston, Sidney Lumet, John Boorman and even Michael Ritchie, a director who started out making heavy-hitters in the 1970s like Downhill Racer, The Candidate and Prime Cut, but also did fluffy Hollywood star vehicles like Eddie Murphy’s The Golden Child and Cops and Robbersons with Chevy Chase.\n\n“I love directors that just keep working,” Dowse says. “I think that’s the key: just keep going. Don’t pull yourself out of the game. Those guys had long careers and made a huge range of movies. I would love to do that, to just keep making them.”"
