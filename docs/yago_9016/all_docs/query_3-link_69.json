        "text": "When a mild-mannered Uber driver named Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) picks up a passenger (Dave Bautista) who turns out to be a cop hot on the trail of a brutal killer, he’s thrust into a harrowing ordeal where he desperately tries to hold onto his wits, his life and his five-star rating. Directed by Michael Dowse, this action-comedy from 20th Century Fox also stars Iko Uwais, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, Jimmy Tatro, Mira Sorvino and Karen Gillan.\n\ncatching this in a few hours. I'd be seeing detective pikachu if i didn't miss out on a pass for that so i'm gonna try not to hold that against this movie\n\nAgreed, it was pretty good. Would've liked some more connective tissue for everything. Kumail reacting to all the crazy shit going on is like a third of the movie's appeal\n\nOh, and the theater gave all the attendees a coupon for a free popcorn so that was nice. Well, at least until we all had to get in line for it and I was minutes away from nearly missing the start of the film\n\nAt our screening they just set boxes of popcorn in the entrance of the theater so you could grab it, it was a nice surprise.\n\nAlso, you can catch a pre-screening like I did if you're in any of these areas\n\nStuber Screenings | 20th Century Fox | Stuber In Theaters July 12\n\nI wonder how much / if the movie has changed since the last round of screenings\n\nThere was probably some revisions, yeah\n\nThought this was fine. Unless you’re on A-List, there’s no reason to rush out to the theater to see it. Clocks in at just about 90 minutes and probably would have been even shorter if they cut out a romantic subplot that went nowhere. Bautista and Kumail are fun to see interacting though."
