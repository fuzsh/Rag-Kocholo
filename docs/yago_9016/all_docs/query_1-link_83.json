        "text": "ARNOLD Schwarzenegger makes an epic TV debut in the first look at his new Netflix thriller FUBAR.\n\nThe 75-year-old is best known for action films including The Terminator franchise and Conan the Barbarian.\n\nArnie stepped away from acting while he was the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011, before returning to the big screen.\n\nHowever, the small screen has alluded him until now, and like many other action stars of his era, he's now got his own Netflix series.\n\nFUBAR is an action-comedy series and the first look trailer focuses on the big budget star at the centre of it.\n\nArnie plays Luke Brenner, a veteran CIA operative posing as a regular guy who discovers that his daughter Emma (Monica Barbaro) has also been undercover for years.\n\nThe official synopsis reads: \"When their assignments converge, it’s a high-stakes yet relatable father-daughter clash that complicates not just a dangerous global mission but also their already complicated family dynamic.\"\n\nThe trailer sees Arnie on a motorcycle a la The Terminator as well as firing guns and getting hit in the crotch by co-star Fortune Feimster who plays a character called Ruth.\n\nArnie said of his decision to front a TV series: \"Everywhere I go, people ask me when I’m going to do another big action comedy like True Lies...Well, here it is.\n\n\"FUBAR will kick your ass and make you laugh –– and not just for two hours. You get a whole season.”\n\nMeanwhile showrunner and co-executive producer alongside Arnie, Nick Santora, said: \"I grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films –– I’d hit my dad up for a few bucks so I could race to the movies and see the biggest star in the world on the big screen –– so creating the first scripted television project for Arnold is unbelievably exciting for me.\n\n\"The thing I always marveled at was how Schwarzenegger could be funny while still kicking ass… that’s why I wanted FUBAR to be a hysterical, CIA-spy comedy mixed with heart-stopping action!”\n\nHe added cheekily: \"I’d love to elaborate with more details, but, sorry, it’s classified.”"
