FUBAR is a 2002 Canadian film directed by Michael Dowse and written by Dave Lawrence, Michael Dowse and Paul Spence, following the lives of two lifelong friends and head-bangers, Terry Cahill and Dean Murdoch. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. Since its release, it has gained a cult status in North America, particularly in Western Canada.

Filmed and set in and around Calgary, Alberta, it was shot on a Canon XL1, on a shoestring budget that required Lawrence to max out his credit card and his dad to refinance their family home to complete it.[3]
