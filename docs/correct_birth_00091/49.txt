There's something in the water in Akron, Ohio.

LeBron James wasn't the only NBA MVP born there. Stephen Curry was too.

And not only were the two born in the same city (which is a remarkable enough coincidence), but they were also born in the same hospital—Akron General Medical Center, to be exact.

While James' ties to Ohio are well-known, Curry has always claimed Charlotte, North Carolina, as his hometown. It is, after all, where his father played 10 seasons with the Charlotte Hornets.

But before joining the Hornets in 1988, Dell Curry played the 1987-88 season for the Cleveland Cavaliers—during which time he and his wife, Sonya, gave birth to a future NBA giant.

However, Curry's ties to Charlotte still trump Akron.

"I'm from Akron but Charlotte raised," he told reporters Thursday.

But if you ask LeBron, Curry's birthplace has everything to do with his success.

When asked in 2012 if the reason Curry could make other athletes play at a higher level was because he was born in Akron, James said, "That's already self-explanatory."
