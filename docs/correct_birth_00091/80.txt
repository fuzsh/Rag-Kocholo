Howdy! Itâ€™s Joey, back with Fun Fact Friyay. Today, weâ€™re trading a basketball court for a hospital.

LeBron James and Stephen Curry were born in the same hospital.

Even if youâ€™re not a fan of basketball, youâ€™ve surely heard of these two guys. LeBron James is the secret star of the movie Trainwreck, and Stephen Curry launched a fairly popular extreme mini-golf show called Holey Moley. Theyâ€™re world-renowned.

Of course, theyâ€™re probably best known for being phenomenal basketball players. Theyâ€™ll both be in the Hall of Fame as soon as theyâ€™re eligible, having set multiple records and winning a collective eight championships and six Most Valuable Player awards.

Even more spectacularly, both players were born in the same hospital, the esteemed Akron General Medical Center in Akron, Ohio.

LeBron Raymone James popped into the world on December 30, 1984. A little more than three years later, Wardell Stephen Curry II was born on March 14, 1988, right down the hall.

Today, the hospital is known as Cleveland Clinic Akron General, and its Google rating is 2.5 stars, which seems about on par for a medical operation.

A few years ago, Curry noted that the narrative around these two legendsâ€™ origin stories keeps shifting. Some accounts say it was the same room and even the same attending physician that delivered both boys.

Curry is fairly certain he and LeBron were both born on the same floor, which is already a pretty good connection.

LeBron ended up staying in the greater Ohio area for quite some time â€” he grew up in Akron, went to high school there, and spent about half of his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Curry, meanwhile, got out of Ohio faster than you can spell it. His dad, Dell Curry, was playing for the Charlotte Hornets, so the younger Curry got a taste of NBA life while growing up in Charlotte. He also spent a bit of time in Toronto when his dad played for the Raptors.

Add the first letter of those cities together, and youâ€™ve got the ACT, a test both boys likely took in high school. What if they got the same score on that test, too? ðŸ¤¯
