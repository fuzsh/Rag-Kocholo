        "text": "Akron native LeBron James might know a thing or two about high school basketball and competition after having won three state titles while at St. Vincent-St. Mary.\n\nHe recognized a move made by the Ohio High School Athletic Association Board of Directors as being good for assorted sports, but especially basketball.\n\nThe association will add three divisions for boys and girls basketball for the 2024-25 school year. It’s a move that James put his stamp of approval on X, the social media site, while calling for something else — a shot clock:\n\nJames wasn’t the first NBA player of note with Ohio ties to call for a change that many view as essential to developing players.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell, a high school hoops fan, supported the suggestion in a Beacon Journal story last year, and it enjoys backing from coaches throughout the area on the girls and boys sides.\n\nOhio high school basketball: Will the state use a shot clock anytime soon? What to know\n\n“We're falling behind the rest of the world,” STVM boys coach Dru Joyce II told the Beacon Journal. “Kids in Europe play with the shot clock their whole life, so they have the understanding of what it truly means. They recognize that in a game you're going to have more possessions. There's going to be more opportunities to score, more opportunities to defend. We need a shot clock. It's our game. We can't allow the rest of the world to take the game away from us.”"
