        "text": "Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James got acclimated quickly to the new EA Sports College Football 25 video game on Saturday as part of the Gameday Showcase.\n\nLeBron went up against his longtime friend Frankie Walker and played as his beloved Ohio State Buckeyes. James took the fight to Walker and his Miami Hurricanes, building up a 28-0 lead entering halftime:\n\nJames also played a game as the Deion Sanders-coached Colorado Buffaloes, going up against the rival Oregon Ducks. With LeBron at the controls, the Buffs were up 24-7 on Oregon in the third quarter:\n\nWhile James was all business while playing as OSU, fun and games ensued when he took control of Colorado.\n\nThe NBA's all-time scoring leader jokingly did his best Coach Prime impression by coaching up Colorado star wide receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter and breaking off a huge play on a jet sweep:\n\nA bit later in the game, massively popular streamer and YouTuber Kai Cenat popped in to chat it up with King James:\n\nIt seemed the four-time NBA champion, NBA Finals MVP and NBA MVP was largely a natural at College Football 25, but his playing session wasn't completely absent of some hiccups.\n\nLeBron made the somewhat surprising decision to play as OSU rival Penn State, and that didn't go in his favor, as he was trailing Texas and hadn't even scored a point by the latter stages of the first half:\n\nAlthough it is the NBA offseason, James is still a busy man since he is part of Team USA, which will be playing in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris later this month.\n\nLeBron is in the midst of Olympic preparations and Team USA training camp, but he still found some time to play one of the most highly anticipated video games in recent memory.\n\nIt has been 11 years since the last college football video game—NCAA Football 14—hit shelves, and both college football fans and gamers alike have been waiting for the return of the franchise."
