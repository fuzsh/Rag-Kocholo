        "text": "January 11, 2014\n\nLeBron James: A Biography, is a biography entirely about LeBron James himself. It's written by Lew Freedman himself. The biography covers the life span of LeBron James since he was a baby all the way to his age of 24. LeBron James was born on the exact date of December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year old mother, Gloria Marie James. While LeBron was growing up, life was very quite often a struggle for him and his mother, who constantly moved from home to home. Realizing LeBron would be much and way better off with a more stable family enviroment, Gloria allowed him to move in with Frank Walker. He introduced LeBron to the actual and real game of basketball when he was at the age of 9. As a youth, LeBron played Amateur Athletic Union basketball (AAU). As LeBron continued and kept on growing up, he chose to attend St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, a largely white private school, instead of public school. In LeBron's freshman year, he made his high school basketball debut. LeBron played on his high school basketball team consecutively for 4 years all the way through to his senior year. In LeBron's senior year, he lost his NCAA eligibility, making it offical he would enter the 2003 NBA Draft. LeBron was selected to the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. It was the moment where LeBron's NBA career finally began. From this moment on, LeBron would strive on to be the absolute greatest NBA player he could possibly make of himself. He would strive on to be able to be defined as one of the greatest to ever play the game and possibly, maybe even, a soon to become legend.\n\nMy experience throughtout reading it was I learned quite a lot about the timeline and events in the life of LeBron James. Also, being a biography it is, I actually and truly enjoyed reading more tha most books I've ever read in my whole entire life. But, probably it's due to the fact LeBron was already my all time favorite athlete and sports figure. Even though LeBron is, throughout reading it, I learned many and several things about him I never even had a single clue about. I was so shocked and surprised because I thought I knew him kind of well. But, it turns out, there's so very much more to his life than I ever could've possibly assumed and guessed. Now, I know even more than I ever did about the life of LeBron James himself.\n\nThere are people who I would recommend the book to and think should read it. These people are the ones who are into athletes and sports figures. Also, these people are the ones who are into sports, mainly and mostly basketball though. Well, the reason why is because like I mentioned, LeBron James plays for the NBA. So, it would make him an NBA player. The NBA stands for the National Basketball Association, making it all about the sport of basketball of course.\n\nMay 30, 2012\n\nI loved this book because LeBron James is my favorite athlete. He's so exciting to watch and I loved his biography. This book explained what happened in his life before basketball, and it describes how well of an athlete he is.\n\nThis book told you about his whole life. His father left him when he was a little boy and it was only him and his mom. The moved to so many place. I think they said he moved about ten times by the age of ten. Basketball was not the only sport he was good at. He was also very good in football. In high school he scored over sixteen touchdown in eight games. He got a scholarship for football but he decided to stay with the sport he loved: Basketball. He was so good at basketball. He was the number one draft pick out of high school to get into the NBA. He averaged about thirty points or more in high school. He brought his team to a 40 in 0 recored in two years of high school. His team was not that good but he made everyone around him better. He lost his first game in the third year of high school to a team that was very good. The next time he played the same team, his team beat that team by twelve points.\n\nAll in all this book is great. I wish to have LeBron's skill in Basketball. He is so talented and he has been my favorite athlete since 4th grade. I can relate this book to a biography I've read before. They explain the persons whole life.\n\n**THIS BOOK IS FOR 4TH QUARTER!!\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 25, 2016\n\nLebron James: A Biography, Lew Freedman\n\nThe book i read was Lebron james : A Biography by Lew Freedman. The author is an experienced writer and author of over 75 books. He has written books about athletes in sports like basketball, baseball, football, etc. The tone of the book is more dry and informative than anything else. I think that the book is great. There is a lot of information that I didn’t know, which I found out through this book. It was written in a way in which the reader could relate to it. My favorite part was when they were talking about Lebron’s early life growing up in Akron Ohio. I have no least favorite part of the book. I would recommend this to readers who love sports, and basketball in particular.\n\nRead\n\nApril 4, 2013\n\nThis book was recommended by a friend of mine. My friend told me that this book was a awesome book about how Lebron James became a familiar face in the NBA World. Well I liked how he had practiced in High School and how he became the familiar face for NBA .\n\nMarch 27, 2009\n\nthis book is the best so is lebron\n\nMarch 18, 2013\n\nHow do u add the book\n\nJanuary 24, 2020\n\nHave you ever wondered what it is like to be a king? Well if you have, just read this book. No, I don't mean an actual king. I mean the king of all of basketball, everywhere. Meet LeBron James, or King James. People call him the king because in the league, he can do whatever he wants to. He is currently the best player in the league so that is another reason we call him King James. This book is a biography about LeBron James and I think any basketball watchers/players would really enjoy this book. The book is located in really a lot of places. At his high school, his house with his family, and the NBA. The time is from about 2000ish until whenever the book came out. An interesting part in the book is when they talk about his high school life and how hyped up he was, and it makes me wish and want to be the player that he was.\n\nDecember 3, 2018\n\nI enjoyed reading this book. It had accurate details on the come up of the superstar athlete Lebron James. Lebron is my favorite basketball player so this book was a book that I actually looked foward to read this book. That is a sighn that this is a good book for me too read. I almost never ever get so excited to read a book but this one was all my free time.\n\nJune 11, 2020\n\nWhen people talk about Lebron James he is usually talked about either being the best player of all time or at least one of them. Lebron is one of the best leaders the NBA has ever had! This book tells you how he grew up and how he is now.\n\nDecember 18, 2019\n\nI think this book was good because it talks about how Lebron James became a basketball player.\n\nMay 6, 2016\n\nthis book was a good a book and I would recommend this book for kids who like autobiography and sports like basketball.\n\nMay 18, 2017\n\nThis book about Lebron James was okay. I liked it, but not as well as I liked the other book I read about Lebron. The book teaches good lessons and tells a great story."
