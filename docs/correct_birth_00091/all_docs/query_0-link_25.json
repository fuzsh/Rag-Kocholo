        "text": "I spent the last two days in Akron, gaining perspective on the NBA Finals from the Cavaliers’ side of the equation in the hometown of LeBron James. My column about the experience is running on Page A1 of Tuesday’s print editions but it had to be trimmed for space reasons. So this is the unedited “Directors’ Cut” version of the column:\n\nAKRON, Ohio\n\nHere I am at the Most Valuable Basketball Maternity Ward in America. It is located on the second floor at Summa Akron City Hospital. Rosemary Williams has been at the check-in desk for more than 30 years. She has seen much, all sorts of labors, difficult and smooth and slow and fast.\n\n“We haven’t had a baby born here at my desk yet,” she said Monday morning. “But we’ve come close.”\n\nSafe to say this: Of the many births that she has logged in, none are receiving as much publicity this month as the deliveries of two infants who came into the world on this very floor in the 1980’s, just 39 months apart.\n\nLeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors are the two biggest stars of the ongoing NBA Finals. Both are MVPs of their sport. And both of them dribbled their first dribbles right here. Rosemary Williams probably helped dab up the spillage.\n\n“I bet I was here on duty when they were born,” she told me decisively, with a smile. “Am I surprised that it was here? No. You know, we’re the best hospital in the area. They had to come here.”\n\nAround Williams, the the ward is besotted with Finals fever. There are bulletin boards full of pictures and encouraging slogans. Several weeks ago, one nurse began placing “Cavaliers” sock caps on the heads of every new infant. Monday, one of the caps adorned the noggin of beautiful little Bella Princehorn, born early Sunday morning, just in time to witness Cleveland’s Game 2 victory over Golden State. The Cavaliers are undefeated in her lifetime. bbb\n\n“Yes, I did know that those two players were born here,” said Bella’s mom, Michele. “My husband told me. That’s pretty awesome.”\n\nJustin Princehorn, holding Bella in a nearby chair, nodded. Of course, I had to ask the mandatory question. Does the legacy of this unit mean that Bella must play basketball and keep up the MVP streak?\n\n“That’s her decision,” Justin said.\n\nDecision? Oh, man. Amazing how every vocabulary word in this town really does relate to hoops.\n\n* * *\n\nJust to remind everyone: “The Decision” was the name of the 2010 television special during which James announced that he would be leaving his home state Cavaliers to sign a free agent contract with the Miami Heat. This choice outraged many Ohioans. But last summer, after winning two NBA titles with the Heat, James opted to rejoin the Cleveland roster. This choice did not outrage many Ohioans.\n\nAnd now, playing brilliantly, James has led his team to the Finals. Just like the Warriors, the Cavaliers are on the brink of their potential first-ever NBA title. But who would have ever guessed that the man leading the team standing in James’ way would be another Akron City Hospital baby – and only because Curry’s father, a pro basketball star himself, was playing his only basketball season for the same Cavaliers’ franchise when Steph was born?\n\n“The mathematical odds are obviously so long,” said Dr. Vivian von Gruenigen, the maternity department chair, although she noted that her operation’s birthing center has won many awards and has always done a high volume of deliveries (3,390 last year alone).\n\nYes, some contend that the whole thing is just a random quirk, pure happenstance. They say it’s a fluke that Curry’s mother gave birth to Steph in March of 1988 within these same walls where James was born in December of 1984. They say it’s basically just trivia and blind coincidence.\n\nOr . . . . is it?\n\nBecause I can tell you that, after spending two days roaming the Akron streets and surrounding countryside to soak up the ambiance and talk to locals, there is some sort of molecular basketball vibe in the air that makes make me believe it might not be a coincidence at all.\n\n* * *\n\nThe principal reason that Steph Curry was born in Akron can be seen along a quiet stretch of State Route 303 northwest of here. Just west of Interstate 271, you’ll find an enormous grassy meadow, now part of a national park. Between 1974 and 1994, however, the meadow was covered with asphalt parking lots that surrounded the Richfield Coliseum, an 18,000 seat arena where Muhammad Ali once fought and Led Zeppelin once played and mostly where the Cavaliers almost always lost.\n\nThe location, by today’s standards, is a weird one. The Cavs now play in a modern downtown Cleveland arena. Yet back in the 1970’s with so many people fleeing big cities, the Cavs’ owner decided to build his expansion NBA team’s home 22 miles outside the city – which actually put the arena slightly closer to Akron, which is 40 miles away from its larger neighbor. Because of this, many Cavaliers’ players lived in the smaller municipality. The commute was easier, the neighborhoods less urban.\n\nDell Curry, Steph’s dad, was traded to the Cavs before the 1987-88 season. He and his pregnant wife, Sonya, moved into a non-luxurious but practical residence in the Timber Top Apartments Complex on Akron’s north side. The complex still exists, slightly worn at the edges but still in a pretty location with a babbling creek running through the property. Rents there today run between $550 and $1,000.\n\nSonya was due to give birth in late March of that season. Thus, Dell felt it was all right to take a three-game road trip earlier in the month and not worry about the birth of his first child. Except, ooops. Sonya went into labor early, the night after an Earth, Wind and Fire concert. She had to phone another player’s wife for a ride to the delivery room. Except, oops again.\n\n“She took me to one hospital and it was the wrong one,” Sonya told NBA.com in a recent interview. “So we needed a police escort to get us to the other one in a hurry because I was so far ahead. We got there and they didn’t have a room for us because it was on short notice. Finally they found a room. And he came out. And it was just me and him.”\n\nA few months later, Dell was claimed in the expansion draft by the new Charlotte franchise. So the family left town before Steph was even out of diapers. I drove up to the Timber Top Apartments to eyeball the spot and was telling this whole nutty story to Barney Trevillion, a 43-year-old complex resident who I found polishing his Mercedes sedan in the parking lot.\n\n“Wow, that’s funny,” Trevillion said, then gazed toward his unit. “They should have updated these places since then.”\n\nSo was he conflicted watching the NBA Finals, knowing that James was born and raised in Akron while Curry spent his first nights in one of the nearby buildings? Which player does he like and root for the most?\n\n“Neither,” Trevillion replied quickly. “You know, I like LeBron being from here. But the player I like most is Kobe Bryant.”\n\nWhich again proved to me that Akron-ites are independent basketball thinkers, ready to engage the basketball-humanity interweave at every level, embracing what the game can bring to their city and maybe to their souls. Or something. That’s part of the story, too.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen LeBron James was born at Akron City Hospital, he had a very different backstory than Steph Curry’s backstory. James’ mom was on her own – she has never identified LeBron’s father – and took him home to a series of scattered residences. When her son was five years old, they moved seven times in 12 months.\n\nThen, a stroke of good humanity occurred. LeBron had shown an affection for basketball as a grade schooler. As his mother struggled to find her bearings, a local family took him in for a while and helped shepherd him through the classroom and onto various club basketball teams coached by well-meaning men. This led to James’ enrollment at St. Vincent-St. Marys High School, which has a campus in a multiple-vacant-lot kind of urban neighborhood near downtown.\n\nDuring those prep days, teachers and administrators there protected James and seemingly kept him as grounded as possible—at least in relative terms, given that he made Sports Illustrated’s cover while leading his prep team to three state championships. Weeks after his high school graduation, he entered the NBA.\n\nBut a whole lot more was going on during James’ ascendance than just basketball in relation to the way Akron felt about him. The best person to explain that is probably author David Giffels. He’s a native of the city and assistant professor of English at the University of Akron. Giffels writes about his town the way that John Steinbeck wrote about Salinas and Monterey, with affection and humor and bluntness and sensitivity. An essay in Giffels’ latest book, “The Hard Way On Purpose,” focuses on why James is such an important figure in Akron’s historic arc.\n\n“LeBron James was born at exactly the moment the city was losing all sense of what it was about, all confidence, all antecedent,” Giffels wrote, relating it to the abandonment of Akron by its previous signature industry, tire manufacturing.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon at his home on Akron’s west side, Giffels elaborated on that observation.\n\n“In 1960 if you got in a cab in Tokyo and you said ‘Akron, Ohio,’ people would say that’s where tires come from. Today when you get in a cab in Tokyo, it’s ‘That’s where LeBron James comes from.’ ’’\n\nSo what does Giffels, who served as a Cavaliers’ bellboy when he was in high school, make of the odd Akron connection with Steph Curry and their meeting in the NBA Finals?\n\n“It’s weird chance,” he answered. “But . . . the whole theme of my book is that I grew up in a place that people were saying you had to leave. And now, a friend of mine just wrote this very meta post on my web page: ‘So you realize that you are in position potentially of having an Akron-ite who came back being defeated by an Akron-ite who left?’ That’s taking it to a full kind of like psychic weight of this whole identity crisis of ours. Technically, Steph Curry is a young professional who left and didn’t came back–even though he probably hadn’t shed his umbilical cord.”\n\nWe then talked about the Cavs’ bad luck in losing two of their best players, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, to injuries. Giffels agreed that it makes the Cavaliers even more of an underdog.\n\n“In a way,” he said, “I think psychologically now, we have a valid excuse if we don’t win. And if we do win, it’s going to be even more epic.”\n\nGiffels then looked me directly in the eyes, as if to make certain that I had to absolutely believe what he was saying or be banned from covering the rest of the series.\n\n“If LeBron wins a championship for the Cavaliers, I think it’s one of the great sports stories of all time,” said the Steinbeck of Akron.\n\n* * *\n\nOn the Akron playgrounds, intellectual dialogue isn’t quite as rampant. Over at the Croghan Park outdoor courts, not far from Giffels’ house, some guys are gathering for a weekend pickup game. Jay Wilder is one of them. He’s 27 years old. His running buddy, Mike Simon, is 28. But the most active person on the court is a skinny 13-year-old, Antoine Cook.\n\nFor these guys, James forever and always will be all Akron, all the time, even though he now lives in a 30,000 square foot mansion in an adjoining township.\n\n“In Cleveland, they called him ‘hometown hero’ when he left for Miami,” said Mike Simon. “We call him ‘hometown hero’ wherever he lives. He’s representing us. I was telling a friend of mine that if he was playing in China, I would follow him.”\n\nWilder, though, informed me that Antoine, the 13-year-old, might have a different opinion because his body type more resembles Curry.\n\n“So which guy do you most want to be?” Wilder asked the kid. “Is it LeBron or Curry? Which one?”\n\n“Steph,” admitted Antoine shyly.\n\nWhy? There was a long, shy silence.\n\n“Cause he’s good,” said Antoine.\n\nWilder shook his head.\n\n“I don’t think LeBron’s going to let us lose,” he said.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen James decided to leave Northeast Ohio for Miami in 2010, the citizens of Akron were not as upset about it as the people of Cleveland. That’s because James and his charitable foundation have been extremely generous to his hometown. He buys bicycles for kids, he gave a million dollars to renovate his high school gym, he does a lot of stuff that doesn’t get publicized. When he left to play in Miami, he took out a full page advertisement in the Akron Beacon Journal to thank his city.\n\nBut that’s not the favorite LeBron anecdote that Akron civilians like to relate. This one is: Last summer when James decided he would return to play for Cleveland, satellite television trucks and all sorts of media folks clogged the streets outside his house, blocking intersections and messing up traffic. He felt so bad about it that a few days later, all of his neighbors opened their doors to find delivery of gourmet cupcakes with an apology note from LeBron.\n\nThat’s what Akron is about, the people tell you. The city still has problems.\n\nThe downtown streets, clean but with too many vacant storefronts, could be described as more lonely than decrepit. And there are still plenty of abandoned factory structures sprinkled across the landscape. (One joke goes that Akron is a Greek word that means “Abandoned Industrial Buildings.” The true translation is “A High Place” because of the geography.) The politics are in kind of a mess right now, after one mayor resigned last month and his successor just revealed he had an inappropriate encounter with a female employee. The population has dropped from 290,000 in 1960 to 199,000 in 2010.\n\nBut here’s the point: Those who do stay believe they are all in it together. The Black Keys, the city’s hottest current musical product, prominently display “Akron Ohio” on their tee shirts. When James was named league MVP for the first time, he asked that the league present the award to him at his high school. The next time, he arranged for the ceremony to be held at the University of Akron gym.\n\n“I don’t think he ever forgot who Akron helped get him to where he is,” said Bruce Winges, the editor of the Beacon Journal. “He mentions it a lot.\n\n* * *\n\nYou may be aware that I am also an Ohio native. As such, I find myself constantly explaining the state to my California friends. The narrative for this NBA Finals casts Cleveland as the Oakland of California. And vice versa.\n\nWrong. Akron is the actually Oakland of Ohio, constantly annoyed when people lump it in with the larger and more famous city of Cleveland, which in this analogy is the San Francisco of Ohio. (Please don’t laugh.) And if you wanted to extend the comparisons further, Columbus is San Jose and Canton is Stockton. (But let’s not extend it any farther.)\n\nAkron sports fans, however, do follow Cleveland teams with a passion. And if you’ve studied history, you know that no Cleveland team has won a championship in any major pro sport since 1964 when the Browns won the NFL title. Since then, across the board in all sports, there’s been heartbreak after heartbreak, hopes crushed and nuked.\n\nTo grasp what this dynamic has done to fans of the Cavaliers, you really need to observe them in their NBA Finals habitat. Sunday night during Game 2, I hopped around to three different sports bars in Akron to get the full range of reaction as people watched the telecast from Oakland.\n\nExcept there really was no range. At all three places, even as the Cavs made good plays, there was an unspoken certainty that the worst possible thing might happen any minute. This is an odd atmospheric element to infiltrate a sports bar. But it was palpable.\n\nMy first stop was a hipster spot called the Matinee on Market Street, where a gaggle of twenty-somethings had gathered for the game. A serious fan named Samuel Hunt said he was almost resigned to a series defeat following the rash of Cavaliers’ injuries.\n\n“I’m just sad about it,” said Hunt.\n\n“Well, there’s still like a sliver of a chance, a slice, that the Cavs pull it off,” said his friend, Jacob Densford.\n\n“You haven’t been a Cleveland sports fan for long enough,” Hunt quickly replied.\n\nWhen the Warriors scored, there were no hoots inside the Matinee. When Curry made a crazy underhanded layup, no groans. Just silent resignation. The biggest reactions were when James hit a three-point shot or plowed toward the hoop. It was the same way downtown at The Barley House, where a large crowd barked approval for Cavaliers’ baskets and more or less worshipped Cleveland guard Matthew Deladova by shouting the following phrase every five seconds he was on the court: “Come on, Delly!”\n\nMy final stop was at a friendly neighborhood joint called Max McQ’s, not far from the Timber Top Apartments. The mood was turning slightly more optimistic when I arrived just as the second half began.\n\n“I think the Cavs are figuring it out,” said Kelly James, a social worker and no relation to the other famous James from Akron.\n\nKelly’s boyfriend, Tim Covan, was more restrained. He works as a Timber Top groundskeeper and has a beard with long hair, which helped him dress up as “Jesus” last Halloween. He won a contest with the costume. He showed me a smartphone photo of an alternate costume and makeup he called “Zombie Jesus.”\n\n“I think the Cavs might pull this off,” said Zombie Jesus . . . er, sorry, I mean Covan.\n\nAnd just about then, to the surprise of no one in the room, things began to go horribly wrong in the final minutes. Cleveland was getting no referees’ calls. A lead was blown. The game was going into overtime.\n\n“What is this?” yelled Kelly. “What is this?”\n\nIt’s the Cleveland curse, someone else yelled back.\n\nNot this night. As the Cavaliers gutted out a victory, the bar exploded in high fives and hugs. We had all just seen the first Cavs victory in a NBA Finals game. Ever. It was almost as if the fans didn’t know how to handle it.\n\n“We’ll take the next three and win it all,” proclaimed Covan, perhaps anticiparting a new costume as “Soothsaying Zombie Jesus.”\n\nThe next morning at the Most Valuable Maternity Ward on earth, Dr. Von Gruenigen had more perspective. She said she was happy about the Cavs’ victory and happy that no matter how the Finals turn out, the hospital will have birthed a NBA champion – even if one certain champion would be more preferred.\n\n“For us, it’s a win-win,” said Dr. Von Gruenigen. “But we would really like a win. You know?”\n\nI knew."
