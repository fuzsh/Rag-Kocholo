Lebron James is currently in his 14th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He spent his first seven seasons playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers, just 39 miles from his hometown, Akron. After the 2009-2010 NBA season, James decided not to resign his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers and instead sign a contract with the Miami Heat.
