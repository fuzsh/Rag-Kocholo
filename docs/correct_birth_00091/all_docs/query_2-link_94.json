        "text": "The Western Conference Semi-Finals are set to grab all the attention of the basketball world. After an incredible 50-point outburst to win Game 7 in Sacramento, Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are ready to face LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. The rivalry between the basketball icons has defined a generation and will be talked about in NBA folklore for years to come. After battling it out in the Finals for four straight seasons, fans will witness the LeBron James-Stephen Curry matchup again, but in the Conference Semi-Finals. However, a common connection between both superstars will blow your mind.\n\nBorn in the same ‘Akron Water’, the connection between the two goes decades back. Their legacies have intertwined and when speaking about either of them, the other has to be mentioned.\n\nWhat is the unknown LeBron James-Stephen Curry connection?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nStephen Curry won three of his four rings defeating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, The King‘s revenge in 2016 to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win Cleveland’s first title arguably has equal importance. LeBron and Curry continue to age like fine wine. LeBron James won his fourth and latest championship for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 amid the pandemic trouble at the age of 35. Last year, Stephen Curry proved he is not yet done, winning his 4th title in a span of 8 years at the age of 34.\n\nThe NBA buffs went crazy when Curry and James played for the same team in the 2022 All-Star game. While the two-time MVP dropped a 50-point game to win the All-Star MVP, LeBron James hit the game-winning bucket to seal the win. After they both put on a show for their hometown, Curry made sure he gave The King his due credit as he made a mention of their hometown.\n\nThe All-Time three-point leader tweeted, “@KingJames with the Game winner. Something in that Akron water. An incredibly special trophy[All-Star MVP] in the birth state.” It was indeed a surprise for many fans to find out that the two were born in the same place; Akron, Ohio. However, there is a deeper connection.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe father of the Warriors star, Dell Curry, was famous for his tenure with the Charlotte Hornets. However, during his time with Cleveland Cavaliers before, Dell and Sonya Curry gave birth to the Warriors legend at Akron General Medical Center.\n\nRead more: “GOAT Things!”: Massive Stephen Curry Feat Amid LeBron James’ Record-Breaker Earns Him Supreme Plaudits\n\nYep, you guessed it right. The four-time MVP King James was also born in the exact same hospital, in 1984. The similarity between the two is uncanny. There is definitely something in the ‘Akron water’ considering their impact on the game.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch this story: “Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams join hands to push 27078 billion worth Marvel franchise Spider-Man”"
