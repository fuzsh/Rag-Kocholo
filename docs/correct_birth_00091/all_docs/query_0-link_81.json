        "text": "The game’s greatest player is set to open a museum in his home state.\n\nLeBron James and his LeBron James Family Foundation announced Thursday the opening of a LeBron James’ Home Court, which is a museum dedicated to Akron, Ohio’s James. The museum will be at the House Three Thirty and will open on Nov. 25, according to Sports Illustrated.\n\n“LeBron James’ Home Court is a multimedia storytelling experience that offers a look at LeBron’s life with never-before-seen items along his journey from Akron to the NBA, Olympics, business, philanthropy and beyond,” it says on the museum’s Eventbrite page. “Located inside the LeBron James Family Foundation’s House Three Thirty venue, all proceeds from ticket sales will go back into the community through House Three Thirty’s innovative job training model that employs I PROMISE students, parents, educators and family members.”\n\nThanks to a multimedia experience, the museum will have a re-creation of the apartment where he and his mother, Gloria James, lived, along with items from his childhood, high school playing career and championship runs with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n“My dream was always to put Akron on the map, so to have a place in my hometown that allows me to share my journey with my fans from all over the world means a lot to me,” James said. “I’ve been known to hang on to a lot of things over the years, and I always knew there would be a time and a place to bring them out.”\n\nThe other items on display, according to NBCNewYork.com, will be the all-white suit James donned at the 2003 NBA Draft, his McDonald’s All-American game jersey and an original backboard and rim from his high school, St. Vincent-St. Mary, where James first caught the attention of basketball and sports fans around the world.\n\nThe general admission will be $23 and all children under 5 years old or younger can get in for free. The museum itself will be open Mondays to Saturdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nJames, a 38-yeard NBA player who has won four NBA championships, is in his 21st season as a pro. He’s the leading all-time scorer in league history after surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar last season (2022-23)."
