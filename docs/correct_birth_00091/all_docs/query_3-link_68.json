        "text": "Bronny James has officially entered the transfer portal.\n\nJames, who played his freshman season at USC, announced Friday morning on his personal Instagram page that he would also be entering the NBA Draft process.\n\n“I’ve had a year with some ups and downs but all added to growth for me as a man, student and athlete,” James wrote. “I’ve made the decision to enter the NBA Draft while maintaining my college eligibility, and will also be entering the NCAA transfer portal. Thank you to USC for an amazing Freshman year, and as always thankful for my family, friends, doctors, athletic trainers and fans for their support.”\n\nIn his season with the Trojans, James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists while shooting 36.6% from the floor and 26.7% from 3-point range. He appeared in 25 games after suffering sudden cardiac arrest during the preseason that put his season – and career – in doubt. He was hospitalized for three days in Los Angeles and cleared to play roughly four months later, making his debut in a Dec. 10 overtime home loss to Long Beach State.\n\nThe son of NBA great LeBron James, Bronny James heavily considered Ohio State out of high school before signing with the Trojans. The Buckeyes are likely to look at pursuing him a second time, The Dispatch has learned.\n\nJames' coach at USC, Andy Enfield, left for SMU after the season's end. Former Arkansas coach Eric Musselman has been hired as his replacement.\n\nOhio State hosted Bronny James and both his parents for an unofficial visit as the football team hosted Notre Dame in the 2022 season opener at Ohio Stadium. While there, they posed for photos in team gear, spent time on the sidelines pregame and took in the game from a suite.\n\nThe Buckeyes have also hosted Bronny’s younger brother, Bryce, on a visit. Ohio State has offered him a scholarship.\n\nOhio State Buckeyes: Join the Ohio State Sports Insider text group with Bill Rabinowitz, Joey Kaufman Adam Jardy\n\nThis is the first offseason for coach Jake Diebler, who was hired to replace Chris Holtmann after taking over as interim coach midseason. Diebler was a significant part of Ohio State’s recruitment of Bronny James the first time, and Ohio State’s decision to hire Diebler was met with public approval by LeBron James, who posted a congratulatory message to his Instagram account.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Duquesne is expected to be \"among his prominent considerations\" should Bronny James remain in college. Dru Joyce, Duquesne's newly hired coach, was high school teammates with LeBron James and remains a close family friend.\n\najardy@dispatch.com\n\n@AdamJardy\n\nGet more Ohio State basketball news by listening to our podcasts"
