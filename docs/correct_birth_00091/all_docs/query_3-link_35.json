        "text": "Miami Heat superstar LeBron James led the Ohio State Buckeyes into the stadium for their Saturday afternoon college football game against Wisconsin. James, who spoke to the team prior to their game, said that had he attended college for a year, he would’ve chosen Ohio State. Per the Plain Dealer: “That’s the message the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player delivered to a frenzied St. John Arena that was filled to capacity with the Buckeyes faithful and the Ohio State Marching Band about two hours prior to the school’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff against Wisconsin. ‘I promise, I say this all the time — if I had one year of college, I would have ended up here,’ James said. James, donning a black short-sleeve shirt, a black cap and jeans, led the team down the steps outside the Blackwell Hotel to the arena for the team’s traditional Skull Session pep rally. Head coach Urban Meyer introduced James, who was greeted with mostly cheers, but a few noticeable boos. ‘No matter where I go in the world, no matter where it is, I will always rock Ohio State colors,’ James said. Meyer, who gushed about James’ leadership abilities at Big Ten media days this summer, did more of the same on Saturday. ‘[He’s] one of, arguably, the greatest champions, greatest competitors and most importantly, a Buckeye,’ Meyer said as he presented James to the crowd. Meyer praised James — who reached out to the university for the opportunity — even more following Ohio State’s 31-24 win. […] Earlier this month, the university unveiled a special locker dedicated to James inside the Schottenstein Center, where the basketball team plays its home games. A two-time NBA champion and two-time NBA Finals MVP, James played for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2003-10. In 2007, the Buckeyes became the first team to wear the Akron, Ohio, native’s Nike gear, as they sported the LeBron logo instead of the patented swoosh.”"
