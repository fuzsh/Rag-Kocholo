        "text": "Nike released a LeBron James Ohio State T-shirt with a No. 23 and the \"M\" in \"James\" crossed out on the back to pay tribute to the Buckeyes' most famous fan to never attend the school. (LeBron did attend The Game in Columbus last year.)\n\nThe crossed-out \"M\" is consistent with Ohio State supporters' refusal to use the letter in advance of the game with archrival Michigan, scheduled for Sat., Nov. 25 at noon in Ann Arbor.\n\nA look from @WFNYScott via Twitter:\n\nThe shirt looks like the all-white jersey Ohio State will wear at Michigan, per elevenwarriors.com.\n\nFanatics.com lists the shirt at $25.99 and says it's out of stock."
