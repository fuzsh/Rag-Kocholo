        "text": "An Akron hospital is making a name for itself internationally as the birthplace of basketball’s biggest stars.\n\nMedia from across the globe are descending on Summa Akron City Hospital this week to show where the Cavaliers’ LeBron James and the Warriors’ Stephen Curry were born just 39 months apart.\n\nSince news spread that the NBA MVPs entered the world at the same downtown Akron hospital, City has been inundated with media requests during the NBA Finals.\n\nESPN, NBA Inside Stuff, the San Jose Mercury News and media outlets from as far away as Italy and Brazil have shared the unlikely story, hospital spokesman Jim Gosky said. He estimates the hospital has hosted or talked to more than two dozen media.\n\n“We cannot buy this kind of advertising,” Gosky said. “It does wonders for the OB program, the maternity unit and the pride of the employees. This is great exposure for a great program.”\n\nBirth records show LeBron Raymone James was born at Akron City Hospital on Dec. 30, 1984. Wardell Stephen “Steph” Curry arrived March 14, 1988, during his family’s brief stay in Akron while his dad, Dell Curry, spent the 1987-88 season with the Cavs.\n\n“Almost 40 years ago, we had the Miracle of Richfield,” Gosky said. “Now we have the miracle of both these MVPs being born here.”\n\nThough City is the birthplace of both stars, the hospital’s allegiances obviously are with Akron’s hometown hero.\n\nAll babies born at City this week are sporting Cavs caps. Those arriving on game days during the finals also get a mini basketball.\n\nAfter all, it’s never too early to start training the next MVP."
