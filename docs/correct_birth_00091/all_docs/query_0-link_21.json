From my earliest days growing up in those streets, the community wrapped its arms around me. My mom and I had our challenges, but the people I was lucky to have around me would not let me fail.\n\nI want to do everything I can to be that for my kids in Akron coming up behind me who have incredible futures ahead of them."
