Over at the LeBron James Family Foundation's House Three-Thirty, the day is slated for a full schedule of celebrations.\n\nCelebrating not just the city of Akron but also the first anniversary of the community hub opening of House Three-Thirty, which is hosting a free all-day event with food, games, music, and entertainment.\n\nFrom a game room set up for guests with pool and air hockey tables, cornhole and numerous PlayStation 5 setups, there are free games for kids and adults of all ages.\n\nLocal bands and performers will take the stage inside the Cabaret. The schedule of events is listed here:\n\nJames' new children's book, \"I Am More Than,\" which will be released worldwide on April 2, is available early exclusively at House Three-Thirty's 330 Day. Inside the retail shop, \"Just a Kid From Akron,\" \"I PROMISE,\" \"We Are Family,\" and \"Strive for Greatness\" shirts can be purchased, along with other Akron and LeBron James-themed merchandise.\n\nCapping off the night is a special performance by Montell Jordan from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nAdmission for the day of celebrating House Three-Thirty and all things Akron is free.\n\nHouse Three-Thirty is located at 532 West Market Street in Akron."
