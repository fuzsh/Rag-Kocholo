        "text": "High School Career\n\nLeBron James along with his friends and AAU teammates decided to attend St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. St.Vincent-St. Mary High School was a predominately white private catholic school and so James and his friends, Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee attendance at the school caused some controversy. Dru Joyce's father, who was also the AAU coach, was later made the head coach of the basketball team during the students time spent at the high school. As a freshman, LeBron averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game and led his team to a 27-0 record and a Division III state title. The following year he averaged 25 points, 7 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. LeBron James became so popular that they had to play their home games at the University of Akron. That year they finished 26-1 and won back to back state titles. During his junior year, he averaged 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals and was on the cover of SLAM Magazine and Sports Illustrated. That year he became the first junior basketball player to win Gatorade National Player of the Year.\n\nSenior Year/Controversy\n\nIn his final year of high school, St. Vincent-St. Mary traveled around the country to play nationally ranked teams and their games were televised as often as possible. James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game and was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and to USA Today All USA First Team for a third consecutive year and Gatorade Player of the Year for a second time. LeBron James risked his college eligibility by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mom who took a loan out using her sons future success. He was cleared because it was from his mother and not an agent. He did however accept 845 dollars worth of clothes for pictures and autographs which led to him missing only 2 games. James also played football in high school and got offers from several Division 1 schools. After participating in several high school all star games, he lost his NCAA eligibility and instead would enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nJames drops 52 points!"
