        "text": "Fans all around the world are excited for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game. The highly anticipated event will see two of the most influential athletes in the league, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, team up one more time to take on the Eastern Conference All-Stars. Bron and Steph were also excited to play alongside each other tonight as they had a wholesome exchange in the locker room ahead of the game.\n\nBoth superstars hugged each other in the All-Stars locker room after Bron interrupted Steph while he was clicking a picture. James and Curry’s locker room exchange reminded fans of a crazy coincidence that the two legends are bonded by. “Still crazy how they were born in the same hospital and ended up being NBA legends.” One fan wrote on X. Yes, however unbelievable it may sound, LeBron and Steph were born in the same hospital in Ohio over three years apart. Both NBA legends took their first breath in Summa Akron City Hospital.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAkron is LeBron’s hometown. So, it is not shocking that he was born in a hospital in the same city. Bron, and Curry, both were born in the General Medical Center. Like James, Curry claims Charlotte, North Carolina, to be his hometown. Of course, this is where his father played 10 seasons with the Hornets. Before joining the Hornets in 1988, Dell Curry also played the 1987-88 season for the Cavaliers. It was during this time that he and his wife gave birth to the legendary 3-point shooter.\n\nWhile James was born in December 1984, Curry was born in March 1988. In fact, in 2021, in an Instagram live video, Curry even joked about this connection that they share. At the time, he was asked by his teammate, Damion Lee, if he and Bron were born in the same room. To this, Curry hilariously said, “Oh maybe the same floor, the story continues to stretch. It was possibly the same floor, same nurse, I don’t know”.\n\nHe went on to laugh at his statement later. But it is a major coincidence that both NBA giants and MVPs started their lives in the same city, same hospital. Probably there’s something in the waters there, giving birth to two legends.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nStephen Curry and LeBron James have had legendary careers\n\nApart from sharing the same hospital as their birthplace, LeBron and Steph also share the fact that they are two of the best players in NBA history. Both superstars have won the NBA Championship 4 times in their careers. They also share several accolades, including Regular season MVPs, Finals MVP, and multiple All-Star selections. LeBron and Steph have had illustrious NBA careers and will be inducted into the Hall of Fame when their careers are over. However, that moment is a long way down the line.\n\nRead More: Shaquille O’Neal Demands Big Change In NBA All-Star Event After Stephen Curry & Sabrina’s Massive Success\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nTonight, LeBron and Steph will share the court at the All-Star Game. This is Steph’s 10th career All-Star selection. Meanwhile, King James will play in his career’s 20th All-Star Game tonight, the most by any player in NBA history. Both superstars are in the later stages of their careers, and fans will cherish watching them play together one more time. It does not happen often that two people born in the same hospital become legends in the same field years down the line and become an integral part of each other’s careers."
