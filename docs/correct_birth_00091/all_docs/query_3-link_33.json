        "text": "Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is getting his own museum in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. The museum will be included in the transformation of an entertainment complex in Akron, which is being rebranded into the House Three Thirty.\n\nThe museum will be built in the former Tangier entertainment complex and will be rebranded into the House Three Thirty. The complex will also house bars, restaurants, and retail shops. There is no exact date set for the museum's opening, but an admission fee will be charged.\n\nThere are already several planned ideas for exhibits when it comes to the LeBron James museum.\n\nVisitors will have an opportunity to walk in a pair of James' size 15 shoes and experience his journey through life. The first exhibit will feature James' early years growing up in Akron's Springhill Apartments and how that transformed him into the man that he is today.\n\nThe museum will also showcase James' skills on the court beginning at his time at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School before segueing into his NBA career. Fans will be able to see how James' career has blossomed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and Lakers.\n\nAnother exhibit space will take a closer look at James' business ventures away from the court, such as his 2021 film \"Space Jam: A New Legacy.\"\n\nThe final hallway will be a tribute to the LeBron James Family Foundation, which began by giving Akron third grade students a bicycle and a helmet. Eventually, James' ambitions became much larger as he eventually founded the I Promise School in 2018.\n\nThe LeBron James museum will be located right down the street from the I Promise School. The idea to open the museum had been discussed for quite a while. Once the Tangier complex was purchased, the idea of the LeBron James museum became a reality.\n\n\"When the school opened, we never anticipated the number of people who would come just to take a picture of the sign,\" LeBron James Family Foundation executive director Michele Campbell told the Akron Beacon Journal. \"This museum will be fun for everyone.\"\n\nNow fans will have a place to learn more about James' life and see several memorabilia items firsthand at the museum."
