        "text": "AKRON, Ohio — The Most Valuable Basketball Maternity Ward in America is located on the second floor here at Summa Akron City Hospital. Rosemary Williams has been at the check-in desk for more than 30 years.\n\nWilliams has seen thousands of births, but none is receiving as much publicity this month as the deliveries of two infants who came into the world on this very floor in the 1980s, just 39 months apart.\n\nLeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors are the two biggest stars of the ongoing NBA Finals. Both are MVPs of their sport. And both of them dribbled their first dribbles right here. Rosemary Williams probably helped dab up the spillage.\n\n“I bet I was here on duty when they were born,” she told me decisively, with a smile. “Am I surprised that it was here? No. You know, we’re the best hospital in the area. They had to come here.”\n\nAround her, the ward is besotted with Finals fever, with bulletin boards full of pictures and encouraging slogans. Most, of course, focus on the Cavs and James, whose Akron connection is well-known. Curry, who split town before he turned 2, understandably registers more as a curious Akron footnote.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, one nurse began placing Cavaliers sock caps on the heads of every new infant. On Monday, one of the caps adorned the noggin of beautiful little Bella Princehorn, born early Sunday morning, just in time to witness Cleveland’s Game 2 victory over Golden State. The Cavaliers are undefeated in her lifetime.\n\n“Yes, I did know that those two players were born here,” said Bella’s mom, Michele. “My husband told me. That’s pretty awesome.”\n\nJust a coincidence\n\nCleveland is on the brink of its first-ever NBA title, its first championship in any sport since the Browns won the NFL title in 1964. But who would have ever guessed that the man leading the team that stands in the way would be another Akron City Hospital baby?\n\n“The mathematical odds are obviously so long,” said Dr. Vivian von Gruenigen, the maternity department chair.\n\nYes, some contend that the whole thing is just a random quirk, pure happenstance. They say it’s a fluke that Curry’s mother gave birth to Steph in March 1988 within these same walls where James was born in December 1984. They say it’s basically just trivia and blind coincidence.\n\nThe principal reason that Steph Curry was born in Akron is that his dad, Dell, was traded to the Cavs before the 1987-88 season. He and his pregnant wife, Sonya, moved into the Timber Top Apartments Complex on Akron’s north side, a practical location given that the Cavs then played at the Richfield Coliseum, 22 miles from Cleveland. The complex still exists, slightly worn at the edges but in a pretty location with a babbling creek running through the property.\n\nSonya was due to give birth in late March that season. Thus, Dell felt it was all right to take a three-game road trip earlier in the month and not worry about the birth of his first child. Except, oops — Sonya went into labor early, the night after she attended an Earth, Wind and Fire concert. She had to phone another player’s wife for a ride to the delivery room. Except, oops again.\n\n“She took me to one hospital, and it was the wrong one,” Sonya told NBA.com in a recent interview. “So we needed a police escort to get us to the other one in a hurry because I was so far ahead. We got there, and they didn’t have a room for us because it was on short notice. Finally, they found a room. And (Steph) came out. And it was just me and him.”\n\nA few months later, Dell was claimed in the expansion draft by the new Charlotte franchise. So the family left town before Steph was even out of diapers. I drove up to the Timber Top Apartments to eyeball the spot and was telling this whole nutty story to Barney Trevillion, a 43-year-old complex resident who I found polishing his Mercedes sedan in the parking lot.\n\n“Wow, that’s funny,” Trevillion said, then gazed toward his unit. “They should have updated these places since then.”\n\nLeBron’s city\n\nA whole lot more was going on in Akron during James’ ascendance than just basketball in relation to the way city felt about him. The best person to explain that is probably author David Giffels. He’s a native of the city and assistant professor of English at the University of Akron. Giffels writes about his town the way John Steinbeck wrote about Salinas and Monterey, with affection and humor and bluntness and sensitivity. An essay in Giffels’ latest book, “The Hard Way On Purpose,” focuses on why James is such an important figure in Akron’s historic arc.\n\n“LeBron James was born at exactly the moment the city was losing all sense of what it was about, all confidence, all antecedent,” Giffels wrote, relating it to the abandonment of Akron by its previous signature industry, tire manufacturing.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon at his home on Akron’s west side, Giffels elaborated on that observation.\n\n“In 1960, if you got in a cab in Tokyo and you said, ‘Akron, Ohio,’ people would say that’s where tires come from,” he said. “Today, when you get in a cab in Tokyo, it’s, ‘That’s where LeBron James comes from.'”\n\nSo what does Giffels, who served as a Cavaliers’ ballboy when he was in high school, make of the odd Akron connection with Steph Curry and their meeting in the NBA Finals?\n\n“It’s weird chance,” he answered. “But … the whole theme of my book is that I grew up in a place that people were saying you had to leave. And now, a friend of mine just wrote this very meta post on my Web page: ‘So you realize that you are in position potentially of having an Akron-ite who came back being defeated by an Akron-ite who left?’ That’s taking it to a full kind of like psychic weight of this whole identity crisis of ours. Technically, Steph Curry is a young professional who left and didn’t come back — even though he probably hadn’t shed his umbilical cord.”\n\nCleveland connection\n\nThe narrative for this NBA Finals casts Cleveland as the Oakland of Ohio. Wrong. That rightfully belongs to Akron, a city constantly annoyed when people lump it in with the larger and more famous city of Cleveland, which in this analogy is the San Francisco of Ohio. And if you wanted to extend the comparisons further, Columbus is San Jose and Canton is Stockton.\n\nAkron sports fans, however, do follow Cleveland teams with a passion. And for the past 51 years, there has been heartbreak after heartbreak, hopes crushed and nuked.\n\nTo grasp what this dynamic has done to fans of the Cavaliers, you really need to observe them in their NBA Finals habitat. On Sunday night during Game 2, I hopped around to three different sports bars in Akron to get the full range of reaction.\n\nExcept there really was no range. At all three places, even as the Cavs made good plays, there was near absolute certainty that the worst possible thing might happen at any minute.\n\nAt a hipster spot called The Matinee on Market Street, where a gaggle of twenty-somethings had gathered, a very serious fan named Samuel Hunt said he was almost resigned to a series defeat following the rash of Cavaliers’ injuries.\n\n“I’m just sad about it,” said Hunt.\n\n“Well, there’s still like a sliver of a chance, a slice, that the Cavs pull it off,” said his friend, Jacob Densford.\n\n“You haven’t been a Cleveland sports fan for long enough,” Hunt quickly replied.\n\nWhen the Warriors score, there are no hoots inside The Matinee. When Curry makes a crazy underhanded layup, no groans. Just silent resignation. The biggest reactions are when James hits a 3-point shot or plows toward the hoop. It is the same way downtown at The Barley House, where a large crowd barks approval for Cavaliers’ baskets and lavishes Cleveland guard Matthew Dellavedova with constant shouts of “Come on, Delly!”\n\nAt Max McQ’s, not far from the Timber Top Apartments, the mood was turning slightly more optimistic when I arrived just as the second half began.\n\n“I think the Cavs are figuring it out,” said Kelly James, a social worker and, as she points out no relation to LeBron. Kelly’s boyfriend, Tim Covan, was more restrained.\n\n“I think the Cavs might pull this off,” said Covan, until things begin to go horribly wrong in the final minutes and Cleveland isn’t getting any referees’ calls and the game ends up going into overtime.\n\n“What is this?” yelled Kelly. “Is this the Cleveland curse or what?”\n\nIt wasn’t. As the Cavaliers gut it out and finish on top, the bar explodes in high-fives and hugs. It’s the first Cavs victory ever in an NBA Finals game. It’s almost as if the fans don’t know how to handle it.\n\n“We’ll take the next three and win it all,” proclaimed Covan.\n\nThe next morning at the Most Valuable Maternity Ward on earth, Dr. Von Gruenigen had more perspective. She said she was happy about the Cavs’ victory and happy that no matter how it turns out, the hospital will have birthed an NBA champion — even if there’s one champion that would be preferred.\n\n“For us, it’s a win-win,” said Von Gruenigen. “But we would really like a win. You know what I mean?”"
