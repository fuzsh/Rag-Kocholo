Pride never fades in Akron, especially when it comes to your alma mater.\n\nTheir jump shot form is flawless, even after a night of questionable decisions. Basketball is ingrained in their DNA.\n\nThey can quote LeBron James like Shakespeare. They practically grew up with him.\n\nFAQ: Unleash Your Inner Akron All-Star (Probably Not)\n\nYou might not be the next LeBron, but here are some quick tips to up your basketball game (or at least impress your friends at the park):"
