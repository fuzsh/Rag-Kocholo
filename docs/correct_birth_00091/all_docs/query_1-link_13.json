        "text": "LeBron James has been dominating the court ever since he entered the league in 2003. He’s considered one of the best basketball players of all-time and many will sit and debate him amongst the likes of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant.\n\nBut did LeBron James go to college? When did LeBron start playing basketball? And of course, how many rings does LeBron James have now? All of these questions and more will be answered in our biography.\n\nLebron’s Early Life\n\nWhere was LeBron James Born? He’s just a kid from Akron, Ohio!\n\nLeBron “King” James was born December 30, 1984, to a single mother when she was only 16 years old. Gloria Marie James gave birth to LeBron and his father, Anthony McClelland had various run-ins with the law so he was not in his son’s life as he was growing up.\n\nJames faced a lot of difficulties growing up as his family moved around a lot amongst some of the “less desirable” neighborhoods in Akron.\n\nLeBron ultimately moved in with a local football coach when he was nine years old. Frank Walker, the coach, introduced LeBron to basketball. He quickly became a star player in his local leagues.\n\nHigh School Career\n\nIn high school, James played for St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. He led the school to three state championships and was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball three times. He was also selected to play for USA Today’s All-USA First Team as a sophomore.\n\nDuring his senior year, he was widely regarded as the best high school player in the country.\n\nLeBron put up 21 points and 6 rebounds per game during his high school career and ultimately entered into the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nHow long has LeBron James been in the NBA? Let’s go through the details of LeBron’s career in the league:\n\nCleveland Cavaliers – 2003-2010\n\nIn 2003, LeBron James was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was only 18 years old at the time and was immediately hailed as a prodigy. In fact, he put up 25 points in his first regular season game.\n\nJames quickly lived up to the hype, averaging 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game in his rookie season. He became the first Cavalier to ever receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nHe went on to spend seven seasons with the Cavaliers, becoming the team’s all-time leading scorer in the process.\n\nMiami Heat – 2010-2014\n\nIn 2010, James shocked the basketball world by leaving the Cavaliers to join the Miami Heat. He was contacted during this time by a number of teams but he ultimately chose Miami for the opportunity to keep winning.\n\nJames was heavily criticized during this time by analysts, fans, and even former players like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.\n\nAlong with fellow All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, James formed a “big three” that was expected to dominate the league. And dominate they did. James won two more MVP awards and led the Heat to four straight NBA Finals appearances, winning two championships in 2012 and 2013.\n\nJames averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists in February of the 2012-2013 season. The Heat had the third longest win streak in NBA history at 27. Everything seemed to be going right for the big three in Miami.\n\nThe Spurs eliminated the Heat in five games in 2014 where James averaged 28.2 points. He opted out of his contract and went back to Cleveland.\n\nLeBron returns to Cleveland – 2014-2018\n\nIn 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers, determined to bring a championship to his hometown. He led the team to the NBA Finals in each of his four seasons back in Cleveland, winning the championship in 2016.\n\nThis was a historic moment for the Cavaliers, as they became the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. LeBron helped pave the way averaging a near triple-double with 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. He became only the third player in history to record a triple-double in a game 7.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers – 2018-present\n\nLeBron signed with the Lakers in 2018 and while there have been many struggles, he still dominates the Western Conference averaging 25, 7, and 8. The team in 2018 was made up of a controversial bunch of veterans and the Lakers struggled to find cohesiveness in the lineup.\n\nJames had a strong mid-season performance right up until he had the first major injury of his career missing 17 consecutive games. The team was ultimately unable to make the postseason until the 2019 season.\n\nThe team entered the playoffs as the number one seed and James helped them defeat the Heat in the Finals with a huge game 6.\n\nOn February 7, 2023 – LeBron scored his 38,388th point to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. This is a record that has remained since 1984.\n\nLeBron James is a legend and will go down in history as one of the best basketball players to ever step foot on the court. He has contributed a lot on and off the court and has inspired countless young men to pursue their passion."
