        "text": "During his first season with the Cavaliers, James led the team in scoring, steals, and minutes played. His performance earned him the title of the NBA’s Rookie of the Year. James earned a spot on the All-Star team during his second season (2004–05). In his third season he led the Cavaliers to the playoffs for the first time in nine years. James won the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for his play during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons.\n\nAfter the 2009–10 season James left Cleveland and joined the Miami Heat. James helped the Heat advance to the NBA championship finals four times. They won two championships, in 2012 and in 2013. While he was with the Heat, James received two more league MVP awards (for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons).\n\nJames moved back to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2014–15 season. He led the team to four championship finals in a row (2015–2018). The Cavaliers took home the championship in 2016. After the 2017–18 season James joined the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2020 James led the Lakers to an NBA championship and was named MVP of the finals.\n\nJames was also a member of three U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams. The teams won bronze in 2004 and gold in 2008 and 2012. James published a memoir, Shooting Stars (written with Buzz Bissinger), in 2009. The book explores his years as a high-school basketball star."
