        "text": "LeBron James is being honored in his hometown of Akron, Ohio!\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers player now has a place for fans to visit to learn more about his life and NBA career. The LeBron James Family Foundation recently opened the LeBron James museum, named “LeBron James’ Home Court,” in Akron, Ohio, Good Morning America reports. The museum offers a glimpse into the life and career of the perennial NBA all-star. In honor of the museum’s opening, James hosted his Lakers teammates at the museum for a walkthrough of the exhibition.\n\n“It’s very special. To be a kid of Akron, I grew up 30 miles south of here, and to be able to be drafted here and spend my first seven years here and then come back for four more years and do some special things that the franchise had never seen,” James said. “When I [was] drafted, I said, I wanted to [light] this place up like Vegas, so I feel I did a decent job of doing that while I was here for my 11 years.”\n\nThe museum is an immersive experience where attendees can enter a recreation of James’ childhood apartment in Akron’s Spring Hill neighborhood. Then, you can explore the exhibit by seeing jerseys from the player’s career on display. The museum also includes the all-white suit James wore at the 2003 draft, where he was chosen by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nThe museum then goes on to follow James’ career through his two times on the Cavaliers, the Miami Heat, and ultimately, the Los Angeles Lakers. It also shows how he’s given back to his community. All ticket proceeds will go toward his foundation, where the money will be distributed to I PROMISE students, parents, educators, and family members.\n\nThe new “Home Court” museum is currently open at James’ multipurpose facility, House Three Thirty.\n\nCover photo: New LeBron James Museum Opens in Akron, Ohio/Photo by LeBron James Family Foundation/Instagram"
