        "text": "POWERED BY\n\nTHE LEBRON JAMES FAMILY FOUNDATION\n\nAs one of this generation’s greatest athletes, LeBron James has channeled his global reach, influence and passion into positively impacting the lives of those around him. With education as the driving force of change, the LeBron James Family Foundation is not only spreading that impact and improving lives of inner-city students and families, but also shifting the course of anentire community.\n\nFocusing on his hometown of Akron, the Foundation's I PROMISE program provides year-round resources, access to opportunities, supportive skill development, constant encouragement and other wraparound supports to more than 1,300 Akron Public School students who have all been guaranteed college scholarships if they do their part.\n\nThese efforts have culminated in the groundbreaking new public school - the I Promise School - that is taking an innovative approach to providing a challenging, supportive, and life-changing education, creating a new model for urban public education.\n\nPOWERED BY\n\nAKRON PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nFrom kindergarten through eighth grade, LeBron James was an Akron Public School student.\n\nKnowing the struggles the students and families in Akron face, he's used his influence and his resources to forge a once-in-a-generation partnership with the Akron Public Schools system to help serve some of its most challenged students.\n\nThis partnership that began in 2011 - and serves more than 1,300 students and counting - has evolved into the joint creation of the I Promise School that is rooted in its deep connection between LeBron and the community that raised him.\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nPRINCIPAL BRANDI DAVIS\n\nLeading the I Promise School in its innovative approach to educating its students, Principal Brandi Davis has the passion, knowledge, and experience needed to solidify the school’s vision and direction from the onset.\n\nPrior to IPS, the Akron native attended and has worked for Akron Public Schools for 18 years and served as a foundational member of the LeBron James Family Foundation’s elementary LeBron Advisory Board, providing critical feedback on its initiatives and incentives. With her infectious enthusiasm and deep-rooted desire to see the I Promise students succeed, Principal Davis is ready to execute a new model for urban public education.\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nVICE PRINCIPAL LEBRON JAMES\n\nOne of the greatest athletes of his generation, LeBron James will always be just a kid from Akron. Seeing himself in the faces of Akron’s youth, he’s dedicated his time and resources to eliminating many of the barriers most inner-city students and families face. He’s rolled all of his philanthropic efforts into the I Promise School, which he considers one of the greatest achievements of his lifetime.\n\nProviding his students with motivation and encouragement every step of the way, LeBron has put the plans and the people in place to make the I Promise School a safe and nurturing place for them to earn their educations and achieve their dreams.\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MICHELE CAMPBELL\n\nAs the Executive Director of the LeBron James Family Foundation, Michele Campbell is charged with executing LeBron’s vision to create generational change in his hometown. That entails overseeing the I Promise School’s overall vision and programming from the Foundation perspective and driving the change it was intended to create.\n\nWith more than 25 years of higher education experience, the Akron native is passionate about education and firmly believes in the I Promise School’s potential to change the world, one student at a time."
