        "text": "Brennan: LeBron James' return a heartwarming upset for Ohio\n\nRetire the \"Mistake by the Lake\" jokes. Stop laughing at Cleveland. Loserville finally won one. LeBron James is coming home.\n\nCleveland just defeated Miami in the most important domestic sporting event of the month: the battle over where LeBron James would rather spend his time. Not just where he wants to play, but where he wants to live.\n\nNow there's an upset for you.\n\nLeBron picking Northeast Ohio over South Florida for livability has to be the best famous thing to happen to Ohio since John Glenn orbited the earth. That was in 1962. Two years later, the Browns won their last NFL championship, which also happens to be the last major sports title won by a Cleveland team.\n\nA half century has gone by. What a nice 50th anniversary present this is for Cleveland. And Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has to be thrilled, too. He has a new buddy to hang around with. Can you imagine the tweets?\n\n\"The Decision: The Sequel\" is especially rewarding for Ohioans because it's really all about one thing: coming home.\n\n\"My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball,\" LeBron wrote in Sports Illustrated. \"I didn't realize that four years ago. I do now.\"\n\nAs it turns out, going to Miami to play for the Heat for four years was like heading off to college, LeBron wrote. Now it's time for him to come back.\n\n\"I have two boys and my wife, Savannah, is pregnant with a girl. I started thinking about what it would be like to raise my family in my hometown. â€¦ The more time passed, the more it felt right. This is what makes me happy.\"\n\nAs luck would have it, it's also what makes the loyal and passionate sports fans of Northeast Ohio happy. Not to mention the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHe's not promising a championship, at least not yet. \"We're not ready right now. No way,\" he wrote.\n\nCleveland sports fans should be fine with that, for one simple reason: Victory already has been achieved. LeBron is coming back to them. This must sound corny to many in this transient nation of ours, but Ohioans truly care about this.\n\nIt's a Great Lakes/Big Ten thing. I'm an Ohioan, from the suburbs of Toledo, where I still own a home. Roots are insanely important to us. That's why LeBron's departure four years ago triggered such a visceral reaction in so many in Cleveland, and why his return is such a joyous moment for the area.\n\nHe clearly gets it.\n\n\"I feel my calling here goes above basketball,\" he wrote. \"I have a responsibility to lead, in more ways than one, and I take that very seriously. My presence can make a difference in Miami, but I think it can mean more where I'm from.\n\n\"I want kids in Northeast Ohio, like the hundreds of Akron third-graders I sponsor through my foundation, to realize that there's no better place to grow up. Maybe some of them will come home after college and start a family or open a business. That would make me smile. Our community, which has struggled so much, needs all the talent it can get.\"\n\nFour years later, and here we are, with such a better way to use the word talent in a sentence."
