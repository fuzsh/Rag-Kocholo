        "text": "The LeBron James Family Foundation opened the LeBron James Museum in Akron, Ohio, this past Saturday, with the aim of showcasing the life and career of the eponymous NBA star.\n\nDubbed LeBron James’s Home Court, the museum is located in the athlete’s hometown. The offerings at the museum include a re-creation of his childhood apartment in Akron’s Spring Hill neighborhood, as well as ephemera such as his McDonald’s All-American high school jersey and the all-white suit he wore at the 2003 draft pick.\n\nThe museum offers fans the opportunity to follow James’s career from his early days playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers to his time with the Miami Heat, as well as championships won in South Beach, Cleveland, and Los Angeles.\n\nAdditionally, the museum highlights James’s philanthropic pursuits off the court, with an exhibit on the establishment of his foundation from the 2009 Bike-a-Thon to the 2018 launch of his education program, I PROMISE.\n\nProceeds from ticket sales will benefit the foundation, the funds to be distributed to students, parents, educators, and family members participating in I PROMISE."
