        "text": "Avia Solutions Group, a global aerospace services group, has acquired Biggin Hill Hangar Company Limited, the owner of Hangar 510, a premium fixed base operations (FBO) and maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) centre of operations at London Biggin Hill Airport.\n\nBuilt in 2011 to the highest standards, Hangar 510 is a state-of-the-art unit located at one of the United Kingdom’s leading business aviation airports.\n\nJonas Janukenas, CEO, Avia Solutions Group, said: “We are pleased to announce the acquisition of this fantastic operation, based at one of Europe’s fastest-growing business aviation airports. We look forward to working with business operators and the Airport to continue delivering exceptional quality services for passengers, aircraft owners and fleet operators landing and departing from London Biggin Hill Airport.”\n\nAvia Solutions Group’s acquisition of Biggin Hill Hangar Company Limited follows the Group’s previous investment in the Airport’s burgeoning business ecosystem. In March 2021, Avia Solutions Group’s subsidiary, Jet MS, acquired RAS Group, a long-established aircraft interior, exterior, and completions specialist based at the airport.\n\nThe transaction also strengthens ASG’s presence in the UK’s aviation services market. In August 2021, Avia Solutions Group’s subsidiary Storm Aviation Limited acquired Manchester-based Chevron Technical Services Ltd (CTS) and its Prestwick-based subsidiary Chevron Aircraft Maintenance Ltd (CAM), providing aerospace solutions to the commercial aircraft maintenance industry.\n\nClick below to share this article"
