        "text": "Oriens Aviation Joins Cirrus Aircraft’s Network of Authorised Service Centres\n\nOriens Aviation is pleased to announce it is now able to offer third party maintenance and repair overhaul (MRO) work on the Cirrus SR family of single-engined piston aircraft. It is expanding its presence at its London Biggin Hill Airport HQ to accommodate the type, which has become increasingly popular in Europe with first time owners.\n\nAt AERO Friedrichshafen, Germany in April, Cirrus highlighted nearly 40% of buyers of the SR2X series in 2021 were new to aviation and 25% of SR orders were outside the US, prompting the manufacturer to open a regional operations office in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Oriens Aviation offers an attractive South East London MRO location, complementing existing UK providers in Guernsey, Gloucestershire and Leeds.\n\nA number of Oriens engineers completed their factory training on the SR in readiness to support the SR2X. Oriens’ General Manager for Maintenance, Stuart Locke, will oversee technicians and engineers on the type, as well as committing further investment to equipment and tooling. The business is currently recruiting additional B1/B2 engineers.\n\n“We are delighted to become a Cirrus SR2X Partner,” commented Stuart Locke. “The Cirrus is a fantastic aircraft and a great brand in personal aviation, testament to its excellent sales performance. We look forward to working with the team in Europe, supporting UK and European owners.”\n\nRobert Walters, Commercial Director at London Biggin Hill Airport, said: “Oriens Aviation is seeing fantastic growth here at London Biggin Hill and we are thrilled the company is now a Cirrus SR2X Partner. Additionally, with the exclusive distribution of Pilatus and Tecnam, Oriens Aviation plays an important role here at the Airport and is a vital part of our business aviation ecosystem.”\n\nEditor’s notes:\n\nThe Cirrus SR2X is one of the world’s best-selling single-engined aircraft, hugely popular amongst private pilots. In manufacture since 2001 in more than seven model variants, it is distinctive in its class for its fixed landing gear and emergency parachute system known as CAPS (Cirrus Airframe Parachute System).\n\nOriens Aviation, based at London Biggin Hill Airport (EGKB), offers a full range of maintenance, repair and overhaul services to private aircraft owners and operators, together with aircraft sales, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, warranty work, aircraft management, AOC advisory, pilot training, operations and handling. It holds EASA Part 145 approval, alongside its national UK CAA 145 and FAA Repair Station approvals.\n\nSince launching maintenance facilities at Biggin Hill Airport in 2018 Oriens Aviation has doubled its workforce and made significant investment in training and tooling.\n\nOriens’ mission is to deliver a high quality, responsive, end to end service to all its customers – from sales, AOC advice, aircraft management advisory, MRO and pilot training.\n\nwww.www.oriensaviation.com\n\nwww.cirrusaircraft.com\n\nMedia contacts:\n\nAlison Chambers, Emerald Media Ltd\n\nTel: +44 (0) 1420 560094/ Mobile: +44 (0) 7721 882939\n\nJurgita Brenninkmeyer, Oriens Aviation\n\nTel: +44 (0) 7904 928928"
