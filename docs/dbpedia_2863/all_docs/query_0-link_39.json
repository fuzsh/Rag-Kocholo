        "text": "On Saturday 22 June, London Biggin Hill Airport hosted the return of their Sunrise Challenge to raise money for the RAF Benevolent Fund.\n\nThe sold-out event saw over 260 runners and 100 cyclists take on the 5K run and 15K cycle ride along the historic runway.\n\nThe runners and cyclists set off on their race at 6:30am. All proceeds from the race were donated to the Fund as chosen charity partner, to support RAF serving personnel, veterans and their families.\n\nThe participant medals were handcrafted by The Biggin Hill Shed, a local community project for men to meet and interact, sharing skills gained during their working lives.\n\nDavid Winstanley, Chief Executive Officer at London Biggin Hill Airport said: “We are thrilled with the support from our local community in making this year’s Sunrise Challenge a huge success. The sold-out event saw over 260 runners and 100 cyclists take on the 5K run or 15K cycle along our historic runway and raise an incredible £7,000 for our corporate charity partner, the RAF Benevolent Fund.”"
