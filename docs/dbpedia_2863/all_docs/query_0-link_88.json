        "text": "General aviation pilots have a great new choice for a detailed airport in Microsoft Flight Simulator. London Biggin Hill Airport, located just to the south of Central London, is a history-rich hub for private pilots, and it’s available now as a bespoke creation from Pilot Plus.\n\nBiggin Hill Airport was initially opened during WWI, but it was during WWII that it became famous, playing a vital role during the Battle of Britain as a commanding base for a variety of Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons.\n\nAfter the War, Biggin Hill Airport eventually fell into civilian use, slowly becoming a popular hub for business jets and similarly sized aircraft. Scheduled flights are not allowed in this airport, so it’s mostly a GA center for private pilots looking for a friendly airfield near London.\n\nDespite its long history, nowadays Biggin Hill Airport features a modern terminal building, overhauled runway, and a variety of useful facilities. The Pilot Plus team took this into account for the re-creation of EGKB for Microsoft Flight Simulator, promising a realistic and authentic rendition of the airfield.\n\nPilot Plus worked in close collaboration with the airport management to ensure they captured every detail in the airport, from the latest construction development to smaller objects like bin bags, so that simmers can get a feel of what the actual location feels like. Based on the official product images, it seems the developers have managed to capture Biggin Hill’s atmosphere quite nicely, which should make for an impressive new airport to add to your list of third-party creations in MSFS.\n\nLondon Biggin Hill airport from Pilot Plus was built to be enjoyed alongside the UK World Update, which launched way back in early 2021. Make sure to have that installed to enjoy this scenery to the fullest!\n\nEGKB London Biggin Hill Airport is now available for MSFS, priced at around £13 through Orbx Direct.\n\nMain Features:"
