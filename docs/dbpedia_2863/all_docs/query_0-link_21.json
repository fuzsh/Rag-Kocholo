        "text": "20 May 2022, London – London Biggin Hill Airport is announcing Jetex as its new Hangar 510 FBO operator, marking the brand’s 35th international FBO location and its first in the United Kingdom.\n\nJetex London will be located in Hangar 510, taking over from Signature in August this year.\n\n“London is a natural next destination for Jetex. We already have a strong presence in Continental Europe with a flagship private jet terminal at Paris Le Bourget, and the new flagship Jetex London is a natural evolution of our operations. Jetex passengers will enjoy a seamless travel experience complemented by the greatest levels of luxury hospitality, unseen before in the market.” said Adel Mardini, Founder & CEO of Jetex.\n\nJetex London will offer a suite of flagship services for passengers and crews traveling through the airport, including private lounges, retail and entertainment areas. Additionally, the terminal will house fully equipped boardrooms and shower suites.\n\n“Jetex is a globally admired brand and we are proud to have the company join our ecosystem of aviation businesses here at London Biggin Hill Airport. We know Jetex will provide an excellent continuity of service and we are looking forward to seeing them thrive,” said Robert Walters, Commercial Director, London Biggin Hill Airport.\n\n“We are very delighted to welcome this new partnership with Jetex, one of the top names in executive aviation, and are looking forward to operating in London Biggin Hill together. The airport is already one of the key points for Avia Solutions Group, as our subsidiary JETMS Completions is successfully running aircraft interior and exterior completions there. Thus, the partnership is opening even more opportunities for further business expansion as well as collaboration on future projects. We see great things ahead,” adds Vygaudas Ušackas, Member of the Board of Directors at Avia Solutions Group."
