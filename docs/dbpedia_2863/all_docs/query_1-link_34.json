        "text": "London Biggin Hill Airport (BHAL), the only dedicated international business aviation airport in Greater London, returns to Schedulers and Dispatchers in San Jose, California this week (3rd to 6th February) Booth No 1717 to promote its London Heli Shuttle offering - a brand new dedicated on demand service to The London Heliport in Battersea.A fleet of AgustaWestland AW109 helicopters, configured for six passengers and operated by resident charter firm Castle Air, whisk arriving business jet passengers from Biggin Hill to London within six minutes. The London Heli Shuttle affords the shortest journey time of any business airport in the UK to London -at a cost of US$3,500. Included in the fixed price is a complementary door-to-door chauffeur service to the clients' final destination in London. No prior notice is required to book the service, which gives arriving US clientele the utmost flexibility and significantly improved access.The London Heli Shuttle launch is part of the airport's wider strategy to attract more transatlantic traffic. Biggin Hill is the UK sister airport to the USA's metropolitan New York Teterboro Airport, which also operates a shuttle helicopter service to Manhattan, operated by AAG, using Sikorsky S76S, in under 10 minutes. Both airports play key reliever airport roles - Biggin Hill recognized as a well-placed alternative for the busy congested hub airports serving London and the South East with its three fixed base operations - Biggin Hill Handling, Rizon Jet and Signature Flight Support.Biggin Hill Airport is back at S&D as it eagerly anticipates the outcome of a public consultation that will enable it to extend its operating hours. It is seeking to be open for business from 06:30 hours to 23:00 hours Monday to Saturday (currently 07:30 to 21:00) and from 08:00 to 23:00 on Sundays and public holidays - versus 09:00 to 21:00, currently. A positive outcome will be especially good for US customers who will benefit with earlier arrival slots.\"London Biggin Hill now ranks 3rd In the UK for business aviation movements, handling some 14,000 during 2014. \"With an expansion of our operating hours and no slot restrictions, we will be able to welcome more traffic, backed up by strong infrastructure with multi-choice FBOs, maintenance providers (including a UK authorised service centre for Dassault Falcon models at JETS Biggin Hill) and extensive hangarage options,\" said Robert Walters, Business Development Director.In August 2013 London's Biggin Hill and Teterboro Airports signed a MoU to both support and develop business air transportation between the financial and commercial centers of the cities of London and New York, recognizing their similarities as international gateway airports to their respective cities. Both are located within 12 miles of the city centers, offering multi choice FBOs, MRO expertise and a range of supporting technical services. They continue to work together on initiatives to minimize disturbance to the local community, whilst continuing to meet the growing needs of customers. \"We pride ourselves on continuing to proactively develop a wide choice of product and services that ensure our customers make London Biggin Hill Airport their gateway of choice for access to and from London and the South East,\" added Robert Walters. \"The London Heli Shuttle experience will enable our customers to gain more control of their time, ensure the transit to and from London is as efficient as possible and have the reassurance that we have chosen excellent service providers and partners through our close association with both Castle Air and Lloyds of Bromley. London Biggin Hill Airport is just 12 miles from central London. It offers award winning VIP handling, a choice of three FBO's, extensive hangarage, support and maintenance services for all ranges of business jets. It is a designated UK Port of Entry, is not restricted on runway slots and now boasts an exclusive six minute London Heli Shuttle transfer service to and from the heart of London.Welcome to Biggin Hill, London's fast track gateway."
