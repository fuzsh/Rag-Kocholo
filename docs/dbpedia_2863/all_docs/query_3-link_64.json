        "text": "London Private Jet: Biggin Hill Airport\n\nLondon Biggin Hill Airport, some 20 kilometres southeast of central London, is home to a large share of charter and private aircraft in the British capital. Whether flying for business or pleasure, Biggin Hill is the ideal airport for those who want to enjoy the privileges of a private jet.\n\nHistory of Biggin Hill Airport\n\nBiggin Hill Airport – or BQH Airport – was built in Bromley in 1917 and served during the two world wars as an important military base for the Royal Flying Corps and later the Royal Air Force. Between 1929 and 1932, the airport was modernised according to the state of research at that time. For example, a technique was retrofitted that enabled some of the first commercial night time flights in the history of aviation. In the Second World War, the airfield served the military aircraft – Spitfires and Hurricanes in particular – that were involved in the Battle of Britain.\n\nAfter the London Croydon airport was closed in 1959, London Biggin Hill Airport became a hub for commercial flights to and from the capital. The increasing number of passengers and flights required the construction of another hangar, which is now used by private jets. In 1992, the Royal Air Force finally withdrew and handed over the administration of Biggin Hill Airport to Regional Airports Ltd. Today, the airport mainly services charter airlines, private aviation clubs, and the EFG Flying School.\n\nBiggin Hill Airport Location\n\nDistances from Biggin Hill Airport to:\n\nLondon Centre: approx. 26 kilometres by car\n\nNotting Hill: approx. 32 kilometres by car\n\nThe British Museum: approx. 28 kilometres by car\n\nWimbledon Park: approx. 24 kilometres by car\n\nLondon Golf Club: approx. 29 kilometres by car\n\nLondon Biggin Hill Private Jet Flights\n\nAt Biggin Hill Airport, passengers can enjoy the benefits of a private airport.
