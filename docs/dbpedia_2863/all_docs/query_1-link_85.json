        "text": "Our rebranding work for Biggin Hill Airport has caught the attention of Design Week magazine. The story featured in the News in Brief round-up along with news from Aardman Animations and Philips.\n\nPad’s first step in redesigning the branding was research on the airport’s reputation and perception. Pad’s Designer, Katie Barron, explained: “We wanted to find out what Biggin Hill Airport (BHA) meant to local people so our research team went out and about in the community. The results showed that 80% felt the old logo was quite or not very appealing, while 60% thought of BHA as local and 50% regarded it as historic.”\n\nThese results gave three vital insights:\n\nthat the majority of people are aware of Biggin Hill Airport as a local business\n\nthere is still a strong association with BHA’s past as an historic WWII airbase\n\nthe airport has a good reputation for being professional.\n\nAll these results went into Pad’s creative thinking. Katie continued: “It was important to reflect BHA’s impressive heritage and vibrant future in the branding. The new, circular logo echoes the RAF roundel while the introduction of the gold colour reinforces the airport’s professionalism. It’s traditional yet classic – just like the airport.\n\n“We also introduced a new strapline: Business, Travel, Community to highlight all the services the airport has to offer. BHA is not just an airport but also a business centre with a strong community.”\n\nThe logo has been incorporated into a comprehensive brand guidelines to help all areas of the business develop consistent, professional communications that reflect and reinforce the brand.\n\nAlison Steward, Pad’s Director of Creative Service said: “I’m so proud of the team here at Pad. It’s an honour to work with such great designers and it’s fantastic to see our work recognised by Design Week.”"
