        "text": "OPUL Jets, a new UK provider of private air charter services, is commencing operations with an initial fleet comprising a Bombardier Global Express XRS and two Bombardier Learjet 40 and Learjet 45 business jets.\n\nTwo G-registered light jets will be hangared at London Biggin Hill Airport, as well as the Isle of Manâs Ronaldsway Airport, to be joined by additional G-registered aircraft later this year.\n\nThe Global Express, on the Maltese registry, will be a âfloating fleetâ aircraft, also available for charter out of Al Maktoum Airport in Dubai. Additional acquisitions will be confirmed over the forthcoming months, with further expansion into the Middle East and Asia also planned.\n\nOPUL Jets was founded last year with offices and operations in London, the Isle of Man, India and Dubai. Harry Ackerman, OPUL Jetsâ CEO, is overseeing sales, aircraft management and charter. He has experience in the aviation sector, global trade and investment and has served private family offices in the UAE, supporting their international growth strategy in the logistics and aviation sector.\n\nMr. Ackerman is excited about establishing a presence for executive jets in the UK, particularly in the thriving market for executive charter, in the realm of light jet cabin aircraft. Concurrently, the Middle East has been experiencing a steady rebound post-pandemic and OPUL is an approved charter company under the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority All OPUL's aircraft are type-rated for London City Airport, positioning the company to meet the anticipated demand and provide business travellers with unparalleled access to the heart of London.\n\nOPUL Jetsâ ultra-long range Global Express is ideal for inter-continental journeys with a 6,500 nm range. It is configured for up to 16 passengers, offering inflight connectivity with a flexible cabin to work and sleep. The iconic Learjet is ideal for short trips to Europe, with seven seats and a generous cabin.\n\nOPUL Jets' Global Express XRS.\n\nClients flying OPUL Jets booking direct or via a charter brokerage can take advantage of personalised VIP concierge services and inflight catering. Supplemental services include personalised security, chauffeur service, restaurant bookings and entertainment as detailed in its new website: www.opuljets.com\n\nOPUL Jets is committed to sustainability, launching with its own proprietary carbon calculator, developed in partnership with Enfiniti. This will allow clients to calculate and offset their carbon footprint for each flight. Where available, OPUL will also encourage its clients to travel on blended SAF. Flight crew will also wear certified recycled apparel.\n\nHarry Ackerman commented: \"We are delighted to bring OPUL Jets into the market with our owned fleet; enabling us to quickly respond to client and broker requests. We are looking forward to elevating expectations in both private aviation and luxury travel. OPUL Jets is a new member of the British Business and General Aviation Association (BBGA) and has also applied to join the Air Charter Association."
