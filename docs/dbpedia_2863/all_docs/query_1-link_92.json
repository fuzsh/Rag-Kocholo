The modern equipment and real-life training has given me the confidence to fly to new places and continue to find new excuses to use my licence.”\n\n“The team managed to accommodate all my challenging needs in terms of scheduling. I was able to train on beautiful G6 airplanes, take full advantage of their simulator and incorporate that oft-missing element of fun.”"
