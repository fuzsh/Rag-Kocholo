        "text": "Fixed-base operator Jetex has launched its first UK service at London-Biggin Hill Airport (BQH) welcoming private jet flyers to the UK’s capital.\n\nThe move into the UK market signals further expansion for the aviation company which already has a strong presence in Europe, including a private jet terminal at Paris–Le Bourget Airport (LBG).\n\nFounder and CEO of Jetex Adel Mardini described the move into the UK aviation industry as a “natural evolution” for the company.\n\nAs well as providing executive terminal services at Biggin Hill, Jetex will also set up retail and entertainment areas plus flight support facilities for crew.\n\n“We are pleased with our arrival in London. Jetex already has a strong presence in Europe with a flagship private jet terminal at Paris Le Bourget, and the new flagship Jetex London is a natural evolution of our operations,” the CEO explained.\n\nExisting Jetex operations stretch across the globe including the US, Brazil, Singapore and China.\n\nLaunched in 2005 in Dubai, Jetex has seen rapid growth with more than 30 FBOs (Fixed Base Operations) and ground support stations on its portfolio.\n\nRobert Walters, Commercial Director at London-Biggin Hill said he was “extremely proud” that Jetex chose the airport for its latest launch.\n\n“Jetex is one of the most respected and acclaimed businesses in private aviation, with an ambitious growth roadmap that reflects our own,” he added.\n\nAlong with Farnborough Airport, Biggin Hill is among the most widely used by private jets arriving in the UK."
