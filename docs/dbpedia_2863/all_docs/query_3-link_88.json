        "text": "London Biggin Hill Airport (IATA: BQH, ICAO: EGKB) is an operational general aviation airport at Biggin Hill in the London Bororugh of Bromley, located 12NM(22 km; 14 mi) south-southeast of Central London. The airport was formerly the Royal Airforce station RAF Biggin Hill, and a small enclave on the airport still retains that designation.\n\nThe airport has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P804) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Regional Airports Limited). It specialises in general aviation, handling a spectrum of traffic from private aviation to large business jets. It currently has no scheduled airline service, as flights using the airport are not permitted to carry fare-paying passengers.\n\nLondon Biggin Hill Airport in London, United Kingdom has a runway length of 5932 feet and is suitable forSmall props, Small Jets, Medium Jets, Long Range Jets and Regional Airliners."
