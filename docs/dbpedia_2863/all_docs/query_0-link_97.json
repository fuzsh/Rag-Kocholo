Please make sure to indicate the correct contact details, as the calculation will be sent to your e-mail.\n\nThere are many domestic and international airports in London and surrounding areas. One of them is Biggin Hill. It is located 12 miles from central London, which makes it especially convenient for business aviation. The airport is popular with businessmen, athletes and media persons. As the airport is located very close to the city centre, the transfer won’t take you much time. In addition, you can drive right up to the jet in your own car.\n\nHistory and infrastructure\n\nThe airport was originally opened during the First World War. The reconstruction of the airport was finished in 1932. During the Second World War, Bigging Hill was handed over to the UK’s Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and served as a commanding base for the Battle of Britain.\n\nRFC left Bigging Hill only at the end of the 1950s. After that, the airport was used to train Air Force pilots. After the closure of the nearby original London Airport at Croydon in 1959, Bigging Hill became the major civilian airport in the suburbs of London.\n\nThe R.A.F left Biggin Hill in October 1992. Two years later, the airport was leased to Biggin Hill Airport Limited for 125 years. Since 2001, the airport hasn’t been used for scheduled flights. Today, Biggin Hill is used only by business and commercial aviation. The international code of the airport is BQH/EGKB.\n\nBiggin Hill is located on top of the hill near the town of Biggin Hill. The airport has two runways, intersecting each other in the shape of the letter “L”. One of the runways is equipped with a glide path and is longer than 1.800 m. Therefore, it is suitable for serving such jets as Airbus and Boeing.\n\nThe airport has a passenger terminal, located on A233 road, which provides facilities for business flights. The building also has cafés, lounge zones, immigration facilities and customs. The “South Camp”, situated to the south of runway 11/29, now contains hangars, as well as many aviation-related businesses, flying clubs and flying schools.\n\nPrices for domestic private flights in UK\n\nBiggin Hill - Edinburgh ~ 9000 EUR (~ 7600 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Jersey ~ 8500 EUR (~ 7200 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Dublin ~ 8500 EUR (~ 7200 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Grenoble ~ 7000 EUR (~ 5900 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Birmingham ~ 8000 EUR (~ 6800 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Leeds ~ 6700 EUR (~ 5700 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Manchester ~ 8000 EUR (~ 6800 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Liverpool ~ 8500 EUR (~ 7200 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Newcastle ~ 7500 EUR (~ 6300 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Glasgow ~ 9500 EUR (~ 8000 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Bristol ~ 6800 EUR (~ 5700 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Southampton ~ 6200 EUR (~ 5200 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - East Midlands ~ 6800 EUR (~ 5700 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Cardiff ~ 9100 EUR (~ 7700 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Inverness ~ 9200 EUR (~ 7800 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Aberdeen ~ 9800 EUR (~ 8200 GBP);\n\nBiggin Hill - Gibraltar ~ 11600 EUR (~ 9800 GBP).\n\nThis is only a small part of the available routes.
