It is recognized as a global center of excellence and the second private jet operation in the U.K. with 23% of London’s market share after Farnborough (31%) and ahead of Luton (22%). The airport typically connects flights to more than 750 destinations across over 70 countries.\n\nJetex London is conveniently located just nine miles from Canary Wharf and 15 miles from Central London, with helicopter transfers taking passengers to and from the heart of the British capital in just six minutes, with limousine transfers taking less than 50 minutes.\n\nThe modern airport runway (1,806 meters) allows most aircraft to operate without payload or range restrictions, including non-stop transatlantic flights.\n\n“We are pleased with our arrival in London. Jetex already has a strong presence in Europe with a flagship private jet terminal at Paris Le Bourget, and the new flagship Jetex London is a natural evolution of our operations.

The airport has been offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) since April 2021.\n\n\"We are extremely proud that Jetex has chosen London Biggin Hill Airport as the destination for its latest FBO - the first in the United Kingdom. Jetex is one of the most respected and acclaimed businesses in private aviation, with an ambitious growth roadmap that reflects our own. We stand at the ready to welcome Jetex’s customers to the capital and offer them the very best standards of service they have come to expect.”\n\nRobert Walters\n\nCommercial Director, London Biggin Hill Airport\n\nWith natural materials, soft lighting, and floor-to-ceiling windows, Jetex London is designed to feel like a warm, contemporary space.
