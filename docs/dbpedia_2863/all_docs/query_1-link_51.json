        "text": "Opul Jets, a private aviation charter brand, has launched in the UK, Isle of Man, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOpul Jets has debuted its operations with an initial fleet of one Bombardier Global Express XRS and two Bombardier Learjet 40 and Learjet 45 business jets. Two G-registered light jets will be housed at London Biggin Hill Airport, as well as the Isle of Man’s Ronaldsway Airport, to be joined by additional G-registered aircraft later this year.\n\nThe Global Express, on the Maltese registry, will be a ‘”floating fleet” aircraft, also available for charter out of Al Maktoum Airport in Dubai. Additional acquisitions will be confirmed over the forthcoming months, with further expansion into the Middle East and Asia also planned.\n\nOpul Jets was founded last year with offices and operations in London, the Isle of Man, India, and Dubai. Opul Jets CEO Harry Ackerman—overseeing sales, aircraft management, and charter—has experience in the aviation sector, global trade, and investment, and he has served private family offices in the UAE, supporting their international growth strategy in the logistics and aviation sector.\n\nAckerman is enthusiastic about establishing a presence for executive jets in the UK, particularly in the thriving market for executive charter, in the realm of light jet cabin aircraft. \"We are delighted to bring Opul Jets into the market with our owned fleet,” he said, “enabling us to quickly respond to client and broker requests. We are looking forward to elevating expectations in both private aviation and luxury travel.”\n\nThe Middle East has been experiencing a steady rebound post-pandemic, and Opul is an approved charter company under the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority. All Opul's aircraft are type-rated for London City Airport, positioning the company to meet the anticipated demand and provide business travelers with unparalleled access to the heart of London.\n\nOpul Jets’ ultra-long range Global Express is ideal for inter-continental journeys, given its 6,500 nautical mile range. It is configured for up to 16 passengers, offering inflight connectivity with a flexible cabin to work and sleep. The iconic Learjet is ideal for short trips to Europe, with seven seats and a generous cabin.\n\nClients flying Opul Jets booking direct or via a charter brokerage can take advantage of personalized VIP concierge services and inflight catering. Supplemental services include personalized security, chauffeur service, restaurant bookings, and entertainment as detailed in its new website.\n\nOpul Jets is committed to sustainability, launching with its own proprietary carbon calculator, developed in partnership with Enfiniti. This initiative will allow clients to calculate and offset their carbon footprint for each flight. Where available, Opul will also encourage its clients to travel on blended SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)."
