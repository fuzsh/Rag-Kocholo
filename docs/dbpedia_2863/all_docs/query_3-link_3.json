        "text": "Biggin Hill Airport is located in the London Borough of Bromley. The freehold has been owned by the council since 1974. The primary reason it was purchased was to ensure the airport’s long-term success whilst at the same time protecting the interests of residents from across the borough and those living under the flightpath.\n\nIn 1994, the council granted Biggin Hill Airport Ltd a 125-year lease. When Biggin Hill Airport Ltd applied to extend its operating hours in 2015, the council required it to commit to a further series of measures to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on Bromley residents. These measures are known as the noise action plan (NAP) and the management information letter (MIL).\n\nBiggin Hill Airport Ltd continues to run the airport, while the council monitors the airport’s activity to ensure it complies with the lease, NAP and MIL. We encourage and assist the airport to work to reduce noise disturbance for Bromley residents where this is possible.\n\nAs a key agreement within the NAP, Biggin Hill Airport installed a noise and track keeping system to enable residents to easily identify and report excessively noisy aircraft and report these aircraft directly to Biggin Hill Airport.\n\nIf members of the public want to contact the council in its role as the landlord, about their concerns, they should complete the airport monitoring form , where correspondence can also be uploaded."
