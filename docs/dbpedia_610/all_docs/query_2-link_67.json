        "text": "Philip Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on August 23, 1954. He is ranked the greatest African scientist of all time and the 35th greatest African of all time. He won the prestigious Gordon Bell Prize for inventing the machine to compute a world record 3.1 billion calculations per second using 65,536 processors to simulate oil reservoirs. On account of being extremely fast, accurate, and being capable of analyzing huge data analyses, his computers are being extensively used for weather forecasting and predicting the effects of global warming and the impacts of other serious environmental issues. As a result of his intellect and hard work, the child of a poor family raised himself to a position which brought him fame and wealth to the extent of his being known as the “Bill Gates of Africa.”"
