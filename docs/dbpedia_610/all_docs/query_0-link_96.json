        "text": "State of Nigeria\n\nState in Nigeria\n\nAnambra State is a Nigerian state, located in the South-eastern region of the country.[5] The state was created on 27 August 1991.[6] Anambra state is bounded by Delta State to the west, Imo State and Rivers State to the south, Enugu State to the east and Kogi State to the north.[7] The State's Capital is Awka, while the State’s Largest City is Onitsha which is regarded as one of the largest metropolis area in Africa. Nnewi is the second largest commercial and industrial city in Anambra State, and also a known automobile hub within Nigeria and Africa.[8]\n\nThe state name was formed in 1976 from the former East Central State. The state is named after Omambala River, a river that runs through the state. Anambra is the Anglicized name of the Omambala.[9][10] The State capital is Awka. The city of Onitsha, a historic port city from the pre-colonial era, remains an important centre of commerce within the state,while Nnewi is the second largest commercial and industrial city in the state.[11]\n\nNicknamed the \"Light of the Nation\", Anambra State is the fourteenth most populous state[12] in the nation, although that has seriously been argued against as Onitsha, the state's biggest and most populous urban area was discovered to be over 8.5 million in population in 2022 by Africapolis which makes Onitsha one of the largest urban areas in Nigeria by population.[13][14][15][16] The area currently known as Anambra State has been the site of numerous civilizations since at least the 9th century AD, including the ancient Kingdom of Nri, whose capital was the historic town of Igbo-Ukwu within the state. Residents of Anambra State are primarily Igbo,[17][18] with the Igbo language serving as a lingua franca throughout the state.[19]\n\nDuring the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970), Anambra State was part of the secessionist Republic of Biafra formed by Igbo nationalists. Anambra was severely affected by the war.[20][21] Today, Anambra State is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria.[22][23]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Anambra is the merging of Anam and the English word 'branch'. Anam is a clan in the Omambala region[24] and the last Igbo speaking community the British colonialists encountered while heading up to Northern Nigeria from across the riverine areas. They usually described present day Anambra as 'Anam branch' to their colleagues up North. Reason Anam together with some neighboring clans was Anambra LGA when the state was created. It is now Anambra-West LGA with Olumbanasa.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra's history stretches to the 9th century AD, as revealed by archaeological excavations at Igbo-Ukwu and Ezira. It has great works of art in iron, bronze, copper, and pottery. These have revealed a sophisticated divine Kingship administrative system, which held sway in the area of Anambra from c. 948 AD to 1911. In some towns, such as Ogidi and others, local families had hereditary rights to kingship for centuries.[25][26]\n\nGreat Britain recognised some of these traditional kings and leaders in their system of indirect rule of the Protectorate of South Nigeria. Beginning in the 19th century, they appointed some noble leaders as Warrant Chiefs, authorizing them to collect taxes, among other duties.\n\nAnambra is in the Igbo-dominated area that seceded as part of an independent Biafra in 1967, following rising tensions with Northern Nigeria. During the Nigerian/Biafran war (1967–1970), Biafran engineers constructed a relief airstrip in the town of Uli/Amorka (code named \"Annabelle\"). Extremely dangerous relief flights took off from Sao Tome and other sites loaded with tons of food and medicine for the distressed Biafran population. Uli/Amorka airstrip was the site where American pilots such as Alex Nicoll, and scores of others, delivered tons of relief supplies to the Biafran population.[27]\n\nDisgusted by the suffering and mounting death toll in Biafra from starvation, as well as the continuous harassment of the relief planes by the Nigerian Airforce, Carl Gustaf von Rosen resigned as a Red Cross relief pilot. He helped Biafra to form an Airforce of five Minicoin planes Malmö MFI-9 stationed at the Uga airstrip. He named his tiny but effective air force \"Babies of Biafra\" in honour of the babies who died from starvation inside Biafra.[28][29][30]\n\nOld Anambra State was created in 1976 from part of East Central State, and its capital was Enugu. In 1991, a re-organisation divided Anambra into two states, Anambra and Enugu. The capital of the New Anambra is Awka.[31]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nBoundaries are formed by Delta State and Edo State to the west for about 97 km across the River Niger, Imo State and Rivers State (for four km) to the south, Enugu State to the east for 139 km, and Kogi State to the north for about 40 km. The name was derived from the Anambra River (Omambala) which flows through the area and is a tributary of the River Niger.\n\nAnambra is the eighth-most populated state in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the second-most densely populated state in Nigeria after Lagos State. The stretch of more than 45 km between the towns of Oba and Amorka contains a cluster of numerous thickly populated villages and small towns, giving the area an estimated average density of 1,500–2,000 persons per square kilometre.[32]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state has a Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate with yearly temperature of 28.99 °C (84.18 °F) and it is -0.47% lower than Nigeria's averages. Anambra typically receives about 212.36 millimeters (8.36 inches) of precipitation and has 243.38 rainy days (66.68% of the time) annually.[33][34]\n\nThe state has been described as one of the worst places affected by the climate change in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa in 2022 according to the Climate Change Education and Action Programme, (CLEAP).[35]\n\nAdministrative Division\n\n[edit]\n\nCities and administrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nWith an annual population growth rate of 2.21 percent per annum, Anambra State has over 60% of its people living in urban areas. It is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria.[36]\n\nThe major urban centres of Anambra State are Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia, Ihiala, Aguleri and Awka, the state capital. Awka and Onitsha had developed as pre-colonial urban centres: Awka was the craft industrial centre of the Nri hegemony. Onitsha is a city state on the Niger, having developed as a river port and commercial centre.\n\nOnitsha is a fast-growing commercial city and has developed to become a huge conurbation extending to Idemili, Oyi and Anambra East LGAs, with one of the largest markets in West Africa.\n\nIn 2012 the tri-city area was dubbed the Onitsha-Nnewi-Awka (ONA) Industrial Axis, in recognition of the expanding industrial capacity. Nnewi (sometimes called the Taiwan of Nigeria)[37][38] is a rapidly developing industrial and commercial centre. Designated as the state capital, Awka has regained its precolonial administrative eminence.\n\nLocal government areas\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra State consists of 21 local government areas. They are:\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra houses the first Nigerian vehicle manufacturer, Innoson, an automobile manufacturer, located in Nnewi.[39][40][41]\n\nPeople all over West Africa travel to Onitsha and Nnewi to trade, which boost the internal revenue of the state. Onitsha is among the top commercial cities in Africa.[42][43]\n\nAgriculture is an important economic sector in Anambra. Oil palms, maize, rice, yams and cassava are among the crops grown. Fishing is also part of the economic mainstay of Anambra State more especially for communities along the riverine areas.\n\nAnambra is a home of innovation, inventions and creativity. There have been several innovations in Anambra, due to its appreciation of education, which has added to the state's GDP. One of those was in 2018, when two brothers, Atikpo Chukwuebuka and Ubaka Chukwuebuka, were the first to invent a machine, that could wash off the bitterness from bitter-leaf (a highly popular vegetable staple in Nigeria).[44] This machine will greatly improve the productivity of vegetable farming in the state.\n\nThe export of agricultural items is a continual boost to Anambra Internal Generated Revenue. In 2017, the state generated $5 million from the export of washed bitter leaf.[44]\n\nThere is a huge deposit of oil and gas in Nigeria, with the Anambra Basin having a great potential of 1000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves untapped. Having more than 13 oil wells situated in Anambra, the state has the capacity to produce more than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, with indigenous companies like Orient Petroleum, and Sterling Oil Exploration and Production Co. LTD (SEEPCO), already leading the way.[45]\n\nNatural resources\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra is rich in natural gas, crude oil, bauxite, and ceramic.[46] It has an almost 100 percent arable soil.\n\nAnambra state has many other resources in terms of agro-based activities such as fisheries and farming, as well as land cultivated for pasturing and animal husbandry.\n\nOil and gas\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the year 2006, a foundation-laying ceremony for the first Nigerian private refinery, Orient Petroleum Refinery (OPR), was made at Aguleri area.[47] The Orient Petroleum Resource Ltd (OPRL), owner of OPR, was licensed in June 2002, by the Federal Government to construct a private refinery with a capacity of 55,000 barrels per day (~7,500 t/d).\n\nIn 2012, following the efforts of Governor Peter Obi and other stakeholders of Orient Petroleum, Anambra State became an oil-producing state. The indigenous company struck oil in the Anambra River basin.[48]\n\nOn 2 August 2015, the management of Orient Petroleum Resources Plc said the company planned to increase its crude oil production to 3,000 barrels per day by September 2015, as it stepped up production activities in two new oil wells in its Aguleri oil fields. An indigenous company, Nails and Stanley Ltd, was to establish a gas plant at Umueje in Ayamelum Local Government Area to support economic activities in the oil and gas industry in the state.[49]\n\nFollowing the attribution of eleven (11) oil wells by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) in August 2021, Anambra State joined the league of oil producing States in Nigeria.[50][51][52] The process to amend the law that set up the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) through which infrastructure is provided to oil producing States has started. The purpose is to include Anambra State in the list of oil producing States as stated in the NDDC law through the amendment of Section 2(1)(b) of the NDDC Establishment ACT CAP N 86 LFN 2004.[53]\n\nInfrastructure and urbanization\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the late 1990s, there has been a migration from rural to urban areas in the state, resulting in Anambra becoming a highly urbanized state: 62% of its population lives in urban areas. In October 2015, the APGA-led state government of Willie Obiano, signed a memorandum of understanding with Galway modular housing company, Affordable Building Concepts International, for 10,000 housing units to be built in the state.[54]\n\nGiven decades of neglect of infrastructure and bad governance, the shift in human migration has posed problems for the state. Infrastructure improvements, both physical and social, have lagged behind the growth in population. There are problems in environmental sanitation, erosion control, and provision of social services. Major cities have become characterized by inadequate and deteriorated road networks and walkways, unregulated building patterns, poor sanitation, uncontrolled street trading, mountains of garbage, and chaotic transport systems, creating congestion, noise pollution, and overcrowding.[55]\n\nThe government of Peter Obi, with the assistance of the UN-HABITAT, produced 20-year structural plans (2009–2028) for three major cities in the State: Onitsha, Nnewi and Awka – the Capital Territory, to restore urban planning and guide their growth into the future.\n\nThe plans contain policies and proposals for land use, city beautification, road infrastructure, industrial development, housing, waste disposal, water supply and health and educational facilities to turn the cities into successful urban areas that can generate employment and wealth, and provide high living standards for their residents.[56]\n\nAnambra became the first state in Nigeria to adopt structural plans for its cities.[5] With effective implementation, it should systematically grow as a major economic center in Nigeria, and West Africa.\n\nThe process of urbanization is fairly contributed by population growth, immigration, migration, and infrastructure initiatives like good road, water, power, and gardens, resulting in the growth of villages into towns, town into cities and cities into metros. To have ecologically feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the growth dynamics. There is a fear that if too many people leave the villages, only the aged men and women will be left to farm. This pattern has been seen in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They have been important in the production of yam, cocoyam, and cassava through consistent agriculture, but such activities have suffered due to the out-migration of youth to the urban centres. There has been both food scarcity in the region and over-population in urban areas.\n\nTo upgrade the state capital and improve traffic, Awka, Governor Willie Obiano signed off on construction of three flyovers between the Amawbia and Arroma end of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, a distance of about three kilometres within the city.[57] Anambra International Cargo Airport, Umueri, opened on 7 December 2021.[58]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra has good transport links to other states in the country.\n\nFederal highways:\n\nA6 north from Owerri in Imo State.\n\nA232 (Trans-African Highway 8 Lagos-Mombasa) east from Asaba in Delta State by the 1,404 m Niger River Bridge (1965) to Onitsha via Awka to Enugu State at Ugwuoba.\n\nOther major roads include:\n\nthe Umuleri-Onitsha Rd north from Onitsha to Aguleri where the Adani Rd continues north to Enugu State,\n\nthe Awka-Okigwe Rd south from Awka to Imo State at Amaeshi,\n\nthe Orlu-Ihiala Rd southeast from A6 at Orlu Junction to Imo State,\n\nthe Uki-Oguta Rd southwest from A6 at Uli to Imo State at Atughobi.\n\nWater Transportation Service;\n\nThe Niger River connects Onitsha Inland Port with the ports of Port Harcourt in Rivers State, and Bururu and Warri in Delta State.

It is classified as a sandstone cave (Lateritic sandstones of Campanian-Miocene age).[62] The Owerre Ezukala caves and waterfalls are great tourist attractions in the state.[63] Largely unexplored, the caves are said to be the largest in West Africa.[64][65]\n\nThe indigenous ethnic groups in Anambra state are the Igbo (99% of the population) and a small population of people who are bilingual[66]\n\nIgbo Ukwu Museum:[67] Igbo Ukwu is an ancient town known for its astonishing metal crafts; it continues to attract tourists to see its bronze artifacts.

It is required that any parents and guardians must ensure that their child is enrolled in and regularly attends private, public or a combination of schools for the academic session.\n\nAnambra is known to be leading in basic education in Nigeria, especially in science and technology. In 2018, five students from Regina Pacis Model Secondary School,[79] Onitsha, won gold medals at the World Technovation Challenge, held in Silicon Valley, San Francisco.[80] In 2019, Anambra State representatives from St. John's Science & Technical College Alor, won bronze at the International Festival of Engineering, Science and Technology I-FEST, held in Tunisia. In 2021, Seven students from Queen of the Rosary College, Onitsha defeated over five thousand other teams from around the world to win the Global Prize Award at Diamond Challenge Global Summit.

Their activities are overseen by the Anambra state and Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nPublic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka, which runs a modern teaching hospital in Nnewi with facilities also at Umunya,[83] and Ukpo. There are also a faculty of pharmaceutical sciences at Agulu, a School of Preliminary studies at Mbaukwu, and a College of Agriculture.\n\nThe Anambra State University (Officially known as Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, formerly known as Anambra State University of Science and Technology (ASUTECH), with two campuses, one in Uli, and another at Igbariam[84][85][86]\n\nThe Federal Polytechnic, Oko[87]\n\nThe Federal College of Education (Technical), Umunze\n\nNwafor Orizu University of Education (formerly known as the Nwafor Orizu College of Education), Nsugbe[88]\n\nAnambra State Polytechnic, formerly known Anambra State College of Agriculture, Mgbakwu[89]\n\nPrivate\n\n[edit]\n\nMadonna University, Okija, the first Catholic University in Nigeria.[90]\n\nTansian University, Umunya[91]\n\nPaul University, Awka[92]\n\nLegacy University, Okija[93][94]\n\nSt Peter's University, Achina\n\nThe UA College of Science & Technology Isuofia[95]\n\nThe University of America College of Science and Technology.[96]\n\nGrundtvig Polytechnic, Oba[97]\n\nBuckingham Academy of Management and Technology, Ogidi[98]\n\nOnit College of Education, Mbaukwu[99][100]\n\nThe literacy rate in the state is comparatively high compared to other states. Anambra State students have won laurels, nationally and internationally in recent times. This is a pointer to the literacy rate of the state, when compared to others.[101][102][103][104] Primary and secondary school enrollment in the state is one of the highest in the country.[105] Consequently, Anambra state has the highest number of JAMB candidates going after the limited number of spaces in Nigeria's tertiary colleges.[106] From 2011/2012 to 2014, its students had the best results in both WAEC and NECO-conducted senior secondary school examinations.[107][108]\n\nAnambra State has some of the best boarding and day secondary schools in Nigeria. The state places a high standard on secondary education.[109][110]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nThe successive government of the state had established Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme, to enable people pay a little amount of money for quality healthcare services noting that it is a way of strengthening the health sector and making health services accessible to the people of the State irrespective of their level of income.[111]\n\nNotable Health Institutions in Anambra include:\n\nAnambra University Teaching Hospital Awka.\n\nNnamdi Azikiwe Teaching Hospital Nnewi\n\nIyi Enu Hospital Ogidi\n\nSt. Borromeo Specialist Hospital Onitsha\n\nDame Irene Okwuosa Cardiology Hospital Oraifite\n\nObijackson Children Hospital Okija\n\nHealth Research Institute Umuchukwu[112]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe State has a three-tier administrative structure: State, Local and Autonomous community levels. The three arms at state level are the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary. The executive arm is headed by an elected governor, who is assisted by a deputy governor, commissioners and executive advisers.\n\nAnambra's political history can be described as varied. Until the early 21st century, it was marked by considerable unrest. Having a long list of \"firsts\" in Nigerian history, it has been known by the sobriquet as, \"The Light of The Nation\". On 29 May 1999, Chinwoke Mbadinuju was sworn in as civilian governor of Anambra state, after many years of military rule. His administration was plagued by deep problems: the most notable was withholding of teachers' salaries in the school. The teachers finally conducted a ten-month strike in all the government secondary schools in the state.[113]\n\nBefore Mbadinuju's rule, secondary education had been free of charge. His administration imposed a tuition fee of 3,000 Naira per term, for all secondary schools, which led to an unprecedented massive demonstration by secondary school students from all over the state. Many people attribute Mbadinuju's failure to political godfathers; his successor also struggled. On 26 May 2003, Chris Ngige was sworn in as the new governor of the state, but he was removed in March 2006 after Peter Obi of APGA filed charges against him of electoral malpractice. The Court of Appeal in Enugu asserted that Ngige's apparent victory in the 2003 election was fraudulent and ordered him to leave the seat.[114]\n\nObi was ousted by a faction of the Anambra State House of Assembly on 2 November 2006 and replaced by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy.[115] On 9 February 2007, Etiaba handed power back to Obi after the Court of Appeal had nullified Obi's removal.[116]\n\nOn 14 April 2007, Andy Uba of PDP was \"elected\" as the new governor of the state and, on 29 May, was sworn in.[117] Reported to be massively rigged, the election was widely criticised. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that Peter Obi's tenure had not ended; therefore, there was no vacancy in the governorship. It removed Andy Uba from office and replaced him with his predecessor Obi.[118]\n\nOn 6 February 2010, Peter Obi was re-elected governor for a second term of four years, after a hot contest with Chris Ngige, a former governor of the state; Prof. Charles Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria; and Andy Uba, who was a strong voice in the state's politics.[119][120] Other contenders included Mrs Uche Ekwunife, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, and many others. Twenty-five contestants ran for the office. Obi was affirmed as the winner of the election, having more than 30% votes above the immediate runner-up. Chief Willie Obiano was sworn in on 17 March 2014 after winning the 16 November 2013 election. Governor Willie Obiano of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was sworn in for a second term in office on 17 March 2018 after the victory at 18 November 2017 elections.[121] He handed over to Charles Soludo, winner of the 9 November 2021 gubernatorial election in Anambra state on 17 March 2022.[122][123]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable media houses in Anambra include:\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nAnambra Broadcasting Service TV\n\nNTA Channel 5 Awka\n\nNTA Onitsha\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nABS 88.5FM\n\nBrilla Sports 88.9FM\n\nWazobia 93.7FM\n\nSapientia 93.5FM\n\nBlaze 91.5FM\n\nCity Radio 89.7FM\n\nNewspaper\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Light Newspaper[124]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most popular sport in the state is Football.

To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two -third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.[126]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitical Figures\n\nDr. Nnamdi Azikiwe – 3rd Governor General of Nigeria; 1st President of Nigeria; and the father of Nigerian Nationalism[127][128]\n\nDr. Alex Ekwueme – from Oko town; politician; architect; first Executive Vice-President of Nigeria, serving 1979–1983[129][130][131]\n\nDim Emeka Ojukwu – native of Nnewi, the leader of the secessionist Biafra Republic[132][133]\n\nEmeka Anyaoku – first black Secretary-General of the Commonwealth and recipient of South Africa's Order of the Companions of Oliver Reginald Tambo for his role in initiating talks between the apartheid state and the African National Congress[134]\n\nNwafor Orizu – hails from Nnewi, Nnewi South; 3rd Senate President of Nigeria and Acting President of Nigeria (1965–1966)[135]\n\nDr. Senator Chuba Wilberforce Okadigbo (1941–2003) – native of Ogbunike; president of the Senate of Nigeria[136][137]\n\nDora Akunyili – ex-head of NAFDAC, and former Nigeria Minister of Information, won international awards for cleansing Nigeria of the scourge of fake drugs[138]\n\nChief P.N.
