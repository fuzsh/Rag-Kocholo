        "text": "5 difference of 4th generation of computer and 5th generation of computer?\n\nThis is hard to answer, because there is no industry standard for what a 'generation' is. It is entirely subjective. You will need to define a 'generation' before a comparison is given. IE, there are 3 generations of AMD Phenom II processor, and over 70 generations of AMD processors. There are five major generations in processor bitrate. There are over 400 generations of individual progressments in major computer technology. There are nearly 50 different generations of individual architecture design.\n\nPersonal computer vs network computer?\n\nPersonal Computer is the computer that is not connected unto any other computer. Network Computer are computers that are inter-connected with each others. Network Computer can access any other computers files/data from one another."
