        "text": "Black History is full of legendary figures. Martin Luther King JR., Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks are probably the first to come to many people’s minds. But what about those who are not mentioned in textbooks or in major films? What black stories have been left out of history’s pages? It was on this quest to answer these questions that led me to various black contributors around the globe from both modern and past eras, all having unique stories and contributions that still affect us today.\n\nContributor #1- James Lafayette\n\nJames Armistead Lafayette was not your typical American slave. He was enslaved by William Armistead and would later wind up in the service of Marquis de Lafayette, Spying on the British. To give some context, Benedict Arnold (a key revolutionary spy) had just turned on George Washington, so the Continental Army was low on trusted informants. But James Lafayette would change that. Deployed into the enemies camp, he acted as an upset slave runaway to the British, feeding valuable information to Washington and the rest of his armies. But Lafayette did not stop there. One of the basics of the spy game is that information only comes through trust. So what did Lafayette do? He pretended to spy on the Americans to throw the British off. In effect of becoming one of the first black double agents and providing key information in a war, Washington would have had some trouble winning without him. Because of this vital role he played, he was freed by the Marquis and took his surname living as a free man and was a respected farmer to the end of his days. Despite being left out of America’s textbooks, his contribution to this country’s freedom can not be overstated.\n\nContributor #2- Philip Emeagwali\n\nPhilip Emeagwali is who we owe the creation of the Internet to. While he shares the title of Father of the Internet with a few other tech geniuses, the formulas he invented are directly used in many of our phones, computers, and electrical applications. Emeagwali was born in 1954 into a poor Nigerian family and was not able to stay in school for long due to economic issues. However, his genius did not go unnoticed. He was able to attend well known colleges on scholarships such as the University of London, George Washington, and the University of Michigan. It was here in our home state of Michigan, that he made a breakthrough that would change the world. For those who do not know, the reason our phones and other electronics can perform all of these complex functions (such as surfing the web) is because our phones have microprocessors (tiny micro computers) working in unison. This is all due to the hard work of Emeagwali in his Ann Arbor lab. Here, he was able to create a formula that allowed eight computers to communicate with each other in unison. Emeagwali won the Electrical Engineers’ Gordon Bell Prize in 1989, considered the Nobel Prize of computing, and then joined the list of geniuses who share the title the Father of the Internet."
