https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny5Yiu34FJo&t=7s\n\nhttps://YouTube.com/emeagwali\n\nPodcast: https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\nHow I Invented My New Internet\n\nA Small Boy in Charge of a Big Ship\n\nI began programming supercomputers\n\non June 20, 1974\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nwith one of the world’s fastest supercomputers\n\nthat was at 1800 SW Campus Way,\n\nCorvallis, Oregon.\n\nThat supercomputer\n\nwas the first to be rated\n\nat one million instructions per second.\n\nAs a 19-year-old\n\nsupercomputer programmer,\n\nI felt like a small boy\n\nthat was in charge of a big ocean liner\n\nthat turns slowly.\n\nThree weeks after I began programming supercomputers,\n\nI was on the cover of a newspaper\n\nthat circulated in the cities of\n\nMonmouth and Independence, Oregon.\n\nI became a local celebrity.\n\nOver the years, I realized that\n\nin Africa, a breakthrough technology\n\nis a sacred object.\n\nThe African that invents\n\na groundbreaking technology\n\ncan occupy the position\n\nbetween Albert Einstein\n\nand Nelson Mandela\n\nand occupy that position\n\nin the minds of Africans\n\nat home and in the diaspora.\n\nThat African inventor\n\nis invited to seat\n\non the African high table.\n\nThe invention of the fastest supercomputer\n\nis a concrete and visible achievement\n\nthat everybody understands\n\nas pushing the frontier of technology\n\nas well as the boundary\n\nof human knowledge.\n\nEmailing Across My New Internet\n\nThe act of inventing\n\nis the courage to try the untried.\n\nEverything I invented changed me.\n\nI was never the same person\n\nafter an invention.\n\nBefore 1989,\n\nthe year I experimentally discovered\n\nmassively parallel processing,\n\nI was described\n\nas a research mathematician\n\nor a research physicist.\n\nAfter I experimentally discovered\n\nmassively parallel processing,\n\nI was redefined\n\nas a research supercomputer scientist.\n\nBut it took me sixteen years,\n\nonward of June 20, 1974,\n\nto be mentioned\n\nin the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof The Wall Street Journal\n\nand to become a supercomputer scientist\n\nthat invented a new supercomputer.\n\nIt took me sixteen years\n\nof dedication, discipline,\n\nand unpaid hard work\n\nto become a supercomputer inventor\n\nthat is the subject of school reports.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow and why\n\nparallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest.\n\nSince that discovery, I really don’t know\n\nwhat I should, or was, best known for.\n\nThe inventor is a prisoner\n\nof his invention\n\nand somewhat need an outsider\n\nto fully explain his invention\n\nto him.\n\nBack in 1974,\n\nI had a blurry vision\n\nof the parallel processing supercomputer—that is a new internet de facto\n\nand that is not a new computer per se—\n\nthat I invented in the 1980s.\n\nI needed the distance in time and space\n\nto gain clarity\n\nand understand that\n\nI am the only father of the Internet\n\nthat invented a new internet.\n\nWhat Made Parallel Processing Impossible\n\nA story in the June 14, 1976 issue\n\nof the Computer World magazine\n\nwas titled:\n\n[quote]\n\n“Research in Parallel Processing\n\nQuestioned as ‘Waste of Time’.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nTo the Computer World magazine,\n\nto invent parallel processing\n\nwas to show that\n\nmassively parallel processing the toughest problems in supercomputing\n\nis not a waste of time.\n\nI was in the news in 1989\n\nbecause I experimentally discovered\n\nhow to save time\n\nand how to do so by reducing\n\n65,536 days, or 180 years,\n\nof time-to-solution on one processor\n\nthat is not a member of an ensemble\n\nof processors\n\nand reducing that time\n\nto only one day of time-to-solution\n\nacross\n\nan ensemble of 65,536 processors\n\nthat were the building blocks\n\nof a new supercomputer.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nwas recognized in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe achievement was recognized\n\nbecause\n\nI experimentally discovered that\n\nthe impossible-to-compute is, in fact,\n\npossible-to-compute.\n\nAt the granite core\n\nof my experimental discovery\n\nthat occurred\n\nat 10:15 in the morning New York Time\n\nTuesday the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nwas my one-to-one mapping\n\nof my 65,536\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof modern mathematics\n\nand computational physics\n\nand my mapping of those problems\n\nto as many\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat defined and outlined a new internet.\n\nPrior to that experimental discovery\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989\n\nthe mechanism\n\nby which 64 binary thousand\n\ncomputational physics codes\n\nwere synchronously emailed\n\nto as many processors\n\nremained unknown.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989\n\nput to rest the saying that\n\nparallel processing\n\nis a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked experimental confirmation.\n\nThe Uncharted Road to Parallel Processing\n\nIt takes eight minutes\n\nto describe how I mapped\n\neight initial-boundary value problems\n\nof modern calculus\n\nand computational physics\n\nand mapped them onto\n\neight processors\n\nthat were a subset\n\nof the 64 binary thousand processors\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas evenly distributed across\n\na small copy of the internet\n\nthat enshrouded a small globe.\n\nAt that rate of eight minutes\n\nfor eight processors,\n\nit will take me ten thousand lectures,\n\nto describe how I\n\nexperimentally mapped\n\ntwo-to-power sixteen processors\n\nacross a new internet\n\nthat’s a global network of\n\nsixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\nprocessors.\n\nLooking back from June 20, 1974,\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States,\n\nmy lone search\n\nfor what makes modern computers faster\n\nand for what makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nwas like going into the Sambisa forest\n\nof Northern Nigeria\n\nalone\n\nand in search for the elusive Chibok girls\n\nthat were held hostage\n\nby Boko Haram fighters.\n\nParallel processing\n\nwas the Holy Grail\n\nand the Chibok girls of supercomputing.\n\nSearching for the fastest\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas like walking at night\n\nand along an uncharted road\n\nin the Sambisa forest of Northern Nigeria\n\nand doing so armed against\n\nBoko Haram fighters\n\nwith only a small lantern.\n\nHow I Experimentally Discovered Parallel Processing\n\nAs we struggle to solve the grand challenges of massively parallel supercomputing,\n\nwe reveal more grand challenges,\n\nsuch as quantum computing.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nparallel processing and, therefore,\n\nnobody else can experimentally discover parallel processing\n\nagain.\n\nWhat was overlooked\n\nin the news headlines\n\nwas that\n\nmy world record speed of\n\n3.1 billion calculations per second\n\nin 1989\n\nwas verified by The Computer Society\n\nof the IEEE,\n\nthe largest society of computer professionals.\n\nMy world’s fastest calculation\n\nwas verified as evenly spread across\n\nsixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\ncommodity processors, or CPUs,\n\nwith each CPU contributing\n\n47,303\n\ncalculations per second.\n\nThe Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nwas the day\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthe world’s fastest computation\n\nand discovered it\n\nacross\n\na massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nthat is the precursor\n\nto the supercomputer of today\n\nthat, hopefully, will become\n\nthe computer of tomorrow.\n\nDivide-and-Conquer in Supercomputing\n\nThere are three methods\n\nthat I could use to decompose\n\nthe oilfield\n\nthat my petroleum reservoir simulation\n\nrepresented.\n\nTo experimentally discover\n\nthe fastest computation across\n\nmy ensemble of processors\n\ndemanded that I achieve\n\na one-to-one\n\nnearest-neighbor mapping\n\nof my 64 binary thousand\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nto my as many commodity processors.\n\nIn my first method,\n\ncalled slab decomposition,\n\nI divided my three-dimensional oilfield\n\ninto sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\none-dimensional slabs,\n\nor oil-blocks.\n\nIn my second method,\n\ncalled pencil decomposition,\n\nI divided my three-dimensional oilfield\n\ninto sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\ntwo-dimensional pencils,\n\nor oil-blocks.\n\nIn my third method,\n\ncalled block decomposition,\n\nI divided my three-dimensional oilfield\n\ninto sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\nthree-dimensional oil-blocks.\n\nThis analogy\n\nrepresents what we knew about\n\nparallel processing\n\nduring the early 1970s.\n\nWhat I believed in the 1970s\n\nwas that my email must travel across\n\nsixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and THIRTY [65,530]\n\nprocessors\n\nto it be delivered to a processor\n\nthat’s five processor apart.\n\nMy 1970s thinking\n\nwas that if I try to send and receive\n\nsixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\nemails at once\n\nthat I will fail in sending them all.\n\nAnd as I intellectually matured\n\nas a research mathematician\n\nand as a research supercomputer scientist,\n\nI discovered that\n\na computer screen comprising of\n\ntwo hundred and fifty-six [256]\n\nby two hundred and fifty-six [256] pixels,\n\nor sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\ncells,\n\ncan be coded with circularity.\n\nIn lay person’s terms,\n\ncircularity means that\n\nthe lower edge of the screen\n\ntouches the upper edge of the screen.\n\nThat circularity occurs\n\nwhen the right side of the screen\n\ntouches the left side of the screen.\n\nI coded circularity\n\ninto my email messaging\n\nin the sixteenth dimension\n\n—not in the two dimensions—\n\nthat I described.\n\nBut I applied the same concept\n\nof circularity in the sixteenth dimension\n\nand I did so, in part, to enable me to record previously unrecorded speeds\n\nin floating-point arithmetical calculations.\n\nThat circularity\n\nwas in the granite core\n\nof my world’s fastest calculation\n\nthat was heard around the world.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nwas the news headlines\n\nbecause I recorded\n\nthe world’s fastest calculation\n\nand I recorded it\n\nby solving sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\nproblems at once.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nin 1989,\n\nand was recorded\n\nin the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal\n\nand was in the June 27, 1990 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education,\n\nthe publication\n\nthat distributes news to universities.\n\nParallel Processing Was Ridiculed\n\nWhen I began scalar supercomputing\n\non June 20, 1974\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States,\n\nscalar processing\n\n—or the one-step-at-a-time\n\nserial computer approach—\n\nwas the frontier of knowledge\n\nof supercomputers.\n\nIn 1974, vector processing\n\nwas the next-generation technology\n\nfor supercomputers.\n\nIn 1974, parallel processing\n\n—or solving many problems at once,\n\ninstead of solving them one by one—\n\nwas an unknown land\n\nto all supercomputer scientists.\n\nIn the 1970s, parallel processing\n\nwas embroiled in controversies\n\nand countless ridiculing statements\n\nwere made about the technology.\n\nI was not surprised\n\nwhen my first lecture\n\non massively parallel processing\n\nhad only one attendee.\n\nThat lecture was in November 1982\n\nin an auditorium\n\nthat was a short walk from\n\nThe White House\n\nin Washington, DC.\n\nThat attendee\n\nwas an eccentric-looking, mid-thirties\n\nwhite male in cowboy regalia\n\nthat included cowboy boots, a bolo tie,\n\nand a Texan hat.\n\nThe second reason\n\nmy lecture on massively parallel processing\n\ndrew only one attendee\n\nwas that it was known in advance\n\nthat I was young and black\n\nthat was unpublished and unproven.\n\nWhite male scientists\n\nwho began conducting research\n\nbefore I was born\n\nare not likely to listen to the discoveries\n\nof a young black African\n\nscientific researcher that was\n\nunpublished and unproven.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the theoretical analyses\n\nof extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics codes\n\ndidn’t meet up to publication standards\n\nand were offhandedly rejected.\n\nIt was until the Fourth of July 1989\n\nthat I could experimentally prove\n\nthat massively parallel processing works.\n\nTo those white scientists, I was trespassing\n\nin a space—a technological\n\nterra incognita—that wasn’t mine.\n\nMy discovery story\n\nwas rejected\n\nbecause it wasn’t their discovery story.\n\nTo many white historians of science,\n\na black inventor is a myth\n\nuntil he becomes a white inventor\n\nI’ve sat for a published portrait\n\nin which the white illustrator portrayed me as a white inventor\n\nand did so\n\nto make me acceptable\n\nto his white readers.\n\nWhen I gave my lectures\n\nin 1982,\n\nthe massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas ridiculed by everybody.\n\nA story in the June 14, 1976 issue\n\nof the Computer World magazine\n\nwas captioned:\n\n“Research in Parallel Processing\n\nQuestioned as ‘Waste of Time’.”\n\nScience Fiction Becomes Science\n\nMy supercomputing quest\n\nwas to make the fictional factual.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nfrom the realm of science fiction.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nfrom the realm of a fictionalized\n\ntwo-to-power sixteen processors\n\nthat were married together\n\nas one cohesive internet\n\nand married by sixteen times\n\ntwo-to-power sixteen email wires\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin a sixteen-dimensional hyperspace.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\non Thursday June 20, 1974,\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon, United States.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nnot as a supercomputer scientist\n\nbut as a mathematician\n\nthat was more at home with\n\nnon-Euclidean geometry and topology\n\nthan with a single processor.\n\nI began supercomputing\n\nas a mathematical physicist\n\nthat was exposed to the\n\nfour-dimensional space time-continuum\n\nof Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.\n\nBecause I began supercomputing\n\nfrom theoretical physics\n\nI found it easier to accept\n\nextra dimensional thinking\n\nthat was then taboo\n\nin engineering science.\n\nMy technological quest\n\nfor massively parallel processing\n\nthat makes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\ndemanded that I think in\n\nsixteen dimensions.\n\nMy quest\n\nfor the new supercomputer knowledge\n\nthat will make the new supercomputer\n\nfastest\n\ndemanded that I imagine\n\na one-to-one correspondence\n\nbetween the bi-directional edges\n\nof the cube in the sixteenth dimension\n\nand the sixteen times\n\ntwo-to-power sixteen email wires\n\nof my new internet\n\nthat encircled a globe\n\nthat I visualized\n\nin the sixteenth dimension.\n\nAlso, my quest for the new knowledge\n\nthat will make the new internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nfastest\n\ndemanded that I imagine\n\nand then that I visualize\n\nanother one-to-one correspondence\n\nbetween the two-to-power sixteen\n\nvertices of the cube\n\nin the sixteenth dimension.\n\nSince I was programming\n\nall 65,536 processors,\n\nand programming them blindfolded,\n\nI had to correctly visualize\n\nwhere each processor was located\n\n—in my sixteenth dimension—and located\n\nwith respect to the other processors.\n\nI imagined my ensemble\n\nas one cohesive supercomputer\n\nthat’s a parallel processing machine,\n\nthat’s de facto\n\na small copy of the Internet.\n\nThat new internet\n\nwas a small copy\n\nof a never-before-understood Internet,\n\nthat had only 65,536 processors\n\naround a globe\n\ninstead of billions of computers\n\naround a globe.\n\nIn the 1970s,\n\nmy parallel processing machine\n\nwas science fiction.\n\nThe belief that the technology\n\nwas science fiction\n\ngave rise to the saying:\n\nparallel processing\n\nis a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked an experimental confirmation.\n\nA theory\n\nis an idea that’s not positively true.\n\nYet, the sixteenth dimensional\n\nthat sounded like science fiction\n\nto the petroleum engineer of the 1970s\n\nthat explores crude oil and natural gas\n\nin the everyday three-dimensional world\n\nalso sounds like fact\n\nto a mathematician used to thinking\n\nin infinite dimensional subspaces.\n\nThe sixteenth dimensional\n\nthat sounded like a science fiction\n\nto the computational physicist\n\nof the 1970s\n\nalso sounds like a fact\n\nto a theoretical physicist\n\nthat routinely imagines multi-dimensional string theory or multi universes\n\nor universes with different laws of physics.\n\nI was a civil engineer\n\n—an engineering physicist—who helped operate dams, reservoirs, and power plants\n\nthat were along the North Platte River\n\nof Wyoming, United States.\n\nThat intellectual difference\n\nbetween the theoretical physicist\n\nand the practical engineer\n\nmade it easier\n\nfor me—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nthat was both a theoretical physicist\n\nand a practical engineer\n\nto change the way I thought\n\nwe could make new supercomputers faster.\n\nThe Fastest Parallel Human Computers\n\nIt’s often forgotten that\n\nparallel human computing\n\nwas discovered in the early 1940s.\n\nShortly after the Second World War,\n\nparallel human computing\n\nwas used to crudely solve\n\nordinary differential equations\n\ngoverning the motions of projectiles.\n\nIn the early 1940s,\n\nballistic computations were executed\n\nby 150 women, each a human computer\n\nthat computed in parallel,\n\nor computed 150 things\n\nat a time,\n\ninstead of computing only one thing\n\nat a time.\n\nThose 150 female human computers\n\ncomputed to solve\n\nan ordinary differential equation\n\nof calculus.\n\nThat ordinary differential equation\n\nencoded the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics.\n\nThose 150 human computers\n\ncomputed, in parallel,\n\nand computed six days a week\n\nand computed\n\nfor the Ballistic Research Laboratory\n\nin Aberdeen Proving Ground,\n\nAberdeen, Maryland,\n\nthat’s 26 miles outside\n\nBaltimore, Maryland.\n\nIn early 1987, I declined a job offer\n\nto program vector processing supercomputers\n\nat Aberdeen Proving Ground,\n\nthe birthplace of the supercomputer.\n\nI decline that job offer because\n\nI was at the brink of completing\n\nmy research that made the news headlines\n\nas the experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel supercomputing.\n\nI declined that job offer, in part,\n\nbecause Baltimore, Maryland\n\nis the hometown of my parents-in-law.\n\nThere were university-trained\n\nbut were prevented by US segregation laws of the 1940s\n\nfrom applying\n\nfor computer programming jobs\n\nat Aberdeen Proving Ground.\n\nBlack American scientists\n\nof the generation of my father\n\nwere prevented from contributing\n\nto the development of the computer.\n\nThe denial to black supercomputer scientists\n\nof the opportunity to contribute\n\nto the development of the computer\n\nand to conduct research\n\nat the frontier of the supercomputer\n\nis a terminal illness\n\nfor American science and technology.\n\nWhen I began supercomputing, in 1974,\n\nthe segregation law had been abolished\n\nin the United States\n\nwhich made it possible\n\nfor me to contribute\n\nto the development\n\nof the fastest supercomputer.\n\nHow I Invented a New Internet\n\nMy contribution\n\nto the development\n\nof the modern supercomputer\n\ndid not only reside\n\nin seeing my new internet\n\nand in seeing the technology\n\nas a global network of\n\n65,536 processors\n\nand did not only reside\n\nin seeing each processor\n\nwith my biological eyes.\n\nI saw my new internet\n\ninside my mind\n\nand I saw the technology\n\nas a new supercomputer\n\nthat was de facto\n\na new internet.\n\nIt was my being the first person\n\nthat saw the technology as a new internet\n\nthat proved that I invented the technology.\n\nI was the first discoverer because\n\nI was the lone wolf research\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer scientist\n\nof the 1970s and ‘80s.\n\nI was the first discoverer because\n\nI took a parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer path\n\nthat was orthogonal\n\nto the vector processing\n\nsupercomputer path\n\nthat was taken by\n\nthe 25,000 vector processing\n\nsupercomputer scientists of the 1980s.\n\nI was a research physicist\n\nof the 1970s\n\nthat was not searching for\n\nnew laws of physics, per se.\n\nI was a research mathematician\n\n—in College Park, Maryland—\n\nthat was not searching for\n\nnew partial differential equations, per se.\n\nAnd I was a research computer scientist\n\n—in supercomputer centers across\n\nthe United States—\n\nthat was not searching for\n\nnew computer algorithms, per se.\n\nOn the contrary, my unorthodox quest\n\nwas for a new supercomputer\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nthat is defined and outlined\n\nby a global network of\n\n65,536 commodity processors.\n\nMy technological quest\n\nwas for the fastest supercomputer\n\nand for how to reduce\n\n65,536 days, or 180 years,\n\nof time-to-solution\n\non only one processor\n\nthat is not a member\n\nof an ensemble of processors\n\nand how to reduce it\n\nto just one day of time-to-solution\n\nacross a new supercomputer\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nand that is defined\n\nas a global network of\n\n65,536 processors.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat the 32 bi-directional email wires\n\nthat delivered emails\n\nto and from\n\neach of those 65,536 commodity processors\n\ncan deliver the fastest\n\nprocessor-to-processor emails\n\nand deliver them across\n\na global network of 1,048,576\n\nbi-directional email wires\n\nand deliver them\n\nas many times faster\n\nthan a singular\n\nprocessor-to-processor email.\n\nThat invention\n\nredefined my new supercomputer\n\nas a new superinternet.\n\nIn the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nI imagined my ensemble\n\nof 65,536\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nas one cohesive new supercomputer\n\nthat’s a parallel processing machine,\n\nthat’s de facto\n\na small copy of a new internet.\n\nThat new internet\n\nwas a small copy\n\nof a never-before-understood Internet\n\nthat had only 65,536 processors\n\naround a globe\n\ninstead of billions of computers\n\naround a globe."
