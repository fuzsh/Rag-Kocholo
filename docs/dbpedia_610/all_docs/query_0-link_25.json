        "text": "After writing much of the article on Philip Emeagwali, I occasionally search Google News to see what he's been up to. In this speech, he makes the rather interesting claim that, due to racism, the world's scientists have grossly misinterpreted the scientific evidence on the origins of AIDS. His preferred hypothesis is that AIDS originated in Britain and was spread to Africa by David Carr, the first known human carrier of the disease who died in 1959.\n\nHas anybody else heard this hypothesis floated before, and by if so by whom and when? --Robert Merkel 20:56, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI haven't heard the theory. But, of course, us British do have a noble tradition of invention. So, if indeed AIDS is made in Britain I shouldn't be at all surprised and it will add to my reasons for bowing and scraping in an unseemly manner in front of an over-privileged, utterly useless family of flappy jawed spongers. --[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod » .....TALKQuietly)]] 21:48, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)\n\nSo do we Australians. We are also in favour in bowing and scraping in an unseemly manner in front of an over-privileged, utterly useless family of flappy-jawed spongers. It's just that these days our (recently reelected..grrrrr) government prefers the Bush family :) :/ --Robert Merkel 22:22, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI heard a very strange conspiracy theory on this - that AIDS was a biological weapon invented by Japan in the 1930s, and that they even hold patents for it. -- Alphax (Talk)\n\nI'm writing a bit of stand up comedy.

I thought it was a Van der Graaf Generator (and, yes, I KNOW it's a band too, but I thought they'd got their name from it, but apparently not).\n\n--[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod » .....TALKQuietly)]] 21:48, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)\n\nTry Van de Graaff generator for starters.

Though some of the uses that this device have been put to are, shall we say, distinctly less than amusing. More generally, my favourite unintentionally funny bit of labelling with a scientific/mathematical implication is washing powder in Australia. A few years ago, all of them began to have standard government labelling in one of two categories \"P\" and \"NP\". I was hoping that the \"NP\" one would be able to cope with intractable stains (maybe by trying all possible ways to get the clothes clean and applying the one that suceeds), but no such luck. In fact, they performed pretty much the same, which went completely against my expectations!\n\nIf the (alleged) humor of the above is lost on you (and it probably is unless you're a CS geek), have a quick look at Complexity classes P and NP.

For instance, when Lex Luthor tells Clark Kent \"Our friendship will be the stuff of legends,\" Clark saying he doesn't like flying, Chloe telling Clark that yellow and red really aren't his colors, Lois Lane expressing a disinterest in reporting, etc. These involve some irony, but there have been others that weren't necessarily ironic. It's not really foreshadowing; it seems more of a direct appeal to the audience, and depends on their knowledge of what is to come. Is there a term for this? -- Wapcaplet 18:02, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhen the audience/reader knows something the characters do not, that's dramatic irony. This appears to be a bit of a mix of dramatic irony and foreshadowing - ironic foreshadowing, perhaps, because the characters are expressing their expectation that things will turn out the opposite of the way they actually do. — Ðåñηÿßôý | Talk 18:13, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm looking for rather complete tree scheme of mathematics, its subdivisions and etc. Something like:\n\nMathematics -> Topology | v Arithmetics\n\nI dunno, you get the idea?

However, there is a county jail for Ontario County on this list, but like most county jails, it is simply referred to as Ontario County Jail. Whether or not there is a commonly used nickname for this facility, I couldn't tell you -- Cvaneg 21:21, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean, but Ontario County Jail is called Ontario County Jail or Ontario County Correctional Facility. The jails that have \"nicknames\" such as Sing Sing (which isn't a nickname... it was just what it was named upon opening), are generally state or federal prisons and they get different names because they can't be named after the city or county they are located in. Ontario County Jail is the only correctional facility in Canandaigua.

For a cylinder it's C = 2 π ϵ r ϵ 0 L ln ⁡ ( b / a ) {\\displaystyle C={\\frac {2\\pi \\epsilon _{r}\\epsilon _{0}L}{\\ln(b/a)}}} , where L is the length of the cylinder, and a and b are the radii of the inner and outer plates. -- DrBob 20:13, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI was looking for a roll-on cylindrical capacitor... I can't find it anywhere! All I'm finding is exercises that just say \"using Gauss' Law, find the equation of this capacitance\"... — Kieff | Talk 21:32, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)\n\nI found it. The sushi-like rolled capacitors can be considered flat parallel capacitors, so the equation does apply :). By the way, someone who's more knowledgeable upon this subject should add the above cylindrical capacitance equation to our capacitor article. — Kieff | Talk 03:50, Oct 20, 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm not sure where I heard this, but I distinctly remember hearing once that churches (at least in the Catholic tradition) are built facing Jerusalem. Is this true? --Penta 20:01, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nCertainly not in general. Roman Catholic churches are, more often than not, aligned with the compass points. -- Jmabel | Talk 20:08, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)\n\nChurches often do face east. This comes from the tradition that, in Southern Europe at least, Jerusalem is to the east. The Word 'to orient' comes from the fact that churches are oriented to The Orient. Of course, there is symbolism about the rising sun too. There is a theory that (because churches often do not align directly east) they are aligned to face the sunrise on the saint's day that they are consecrated for. Wordsworth notes this in 1823, there is also stuff about a Scottish Masonic tradition. try this. Intrigue 20:19, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nYes, I suppose the \"facing east\" tradition does relate to Jerusalem, never thought about it, but the tendency is to face due east, not in the precise direction of Jerusalem (unlike Muslims facing Mecca to pray). -- Jmabel | Talk 21:14, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)\n\nEarly Christian churches often faced Jerusalem, based in part (as I recall) on the tradition that the Second Coming of Jesus would occur on the Mount of Olives. A prominent example, as I recall, is the building once known as Hagia Sophia in Istanbul -- I remember seeing a picture of its internal layout once (it's now a mosque) that showed the praying Muslims are not aligned with the building's axis. The explanation given was that the building was aligned to Jerusalem when built, but that praying to Mecca meant that worshippers didn't face the front wall directly, but at a slight angle. I believe I saw this in Kenneth Clark's Civilisation film series, but it may have simply been in a college lecture. Wish I had more data and less recollections, though. Jwrosenzweig 21:23, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nA google search provided a number of sites agreeing with me, though I didn't find any of them authoritative enough that they're worth quoting here (searching at Google for 'Christian church \"facing Jerusalem\" will provide what I found). I will check some of my reference materials at home to see if a better source can be found. Jwrosenzweig 21:29, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThis tradition is no longer followed, atleast not in the new world. Around here, catholic churches face the street they are on, for example, Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph (San Jose) faces west, while my church in Saratoga, California faces north, and is shaped like a hexagon. Gentgeen 22:54, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nMany British churches were built so that the sun would rise and come through the main entrance at dawn on the feast day of the saint the church was named for. When the calendar change in 1752 occurred, this threw churches out of alignment. I've read that some churches later put additions on to be aligned once more, but the \"crooked churches of England\" has a whiff of apocrypha about it. PedanticallySpeaking 14:07, Oct 23, 2004 (UTC)\n\nI am wondering if the average speed of normal, passenger airline travel has increased in recent decades, let's say 1960 to now. Is travel from Los Angeles to New York any quicker today than it was in 1980?? ike9898 20:52, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe major advance in airliner speed since the 1940s is jet propulsion. The first jet airliner was introduced in 1949 (see jetliner), but it took a number of years to phase out the old models. I checked a few articles on early jetliners and found them to be remarkably short on specifications, but IIRC they had cruise speeds of 400-500 miles per hour. Modern designs range between 500 and nearly 600 miles per hour; large models are a bit faster than small ones. If you're looking for information about things like air traffic control efficiency, flight patterns, airport streamlining, etc., I can't help you. --Smack 05:13, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThey had Concorde in 1980, they don't now. Speeds have come down! Dunc|☺ 17:03, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nFor quite a while, airliners have flown at speeds around 90% of the speed of sound. Concorde not withstanding, it generally hasn't been seen as being economically viable to design passenger planes which can break the sound barrier (although there are some plans for future supersonic airliners). So there hasn't been much change in the average cruise speed for the last twenty years or so. However, there has been considerable effort put into developing more efficient engines and aircraft designs. As such the range of airliners has increased, so it is now possible to get non-stop flights to more destinations. If you are travelling to an airport that used to require a refuelling stop but now doesn't, there can be a significant saving in the total time required for the flight (probably saves about two hours). -- Solipsist 23:45, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm considering staying up to watch the US presidential results on election night. Can anyone tell me at roughly what time did American television channels initially declare Gore/Bush the winner of Florida? [[User:Dmn|Dmn / Դմն ]] 22:00, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nAccording to this timeline Florida was initially called for Gore at 7:50 PM EST. I don't know how valid that reference is, but my vauge recolection of the election agrees with that approximate time. Incidentally, you'd probably be better off getting your sleep rather than staying up, as I imagine this coming election will be just as contentious if not more so than the last. At the very least, I don't forsee either candidate conceding defeat until all ballots are counted, which usually does not happen till early the next day anyway.--Cvaneg 22:22, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nCheers, I think I can afford to stay up to 01:00 GMT [[User:Dmn|Dmn / Դմն 13:41, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThough they often declare candidates to have won before they actually have results, the polls generally close in most states at 8 PM. To find out the actual result of the election is 2000, you would have had to stay up for about 3 weeks. I often don't trust the initial reports (especially when it is before polls technically close) in battleground states, anyway. That's just me, though. Skyler 13:49, Oct 20, 2004 (UTC)\n\n8 PM? Gosh that's early! In UK general elections the polls stay open until 10 PM. -- Arwel 01:24, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nWell, they do open at 7 AM... if you can't find fifteen free minutes in that span of time to get out and vote, your life is entirely too busy. Still, if I had my druthers, \"Election Day\" would last for at least two days, and polls would be open for a full 24 hours... Garrett Albright 04:42, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nWell, UK general elections open at 7 AM too -- we like to give people plenty of chance to vote, and they can always apply in advance for a postal vote if they absolutely can't get to a polling station. And the BBC usually declares the winners at 10:00:01 PM, though there's the fun of staying up to 3 or 4 AM to watch the individual results, especially when the major candidates get humiliated by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate standing behind them! The annual UK local elections have polls open from 8 AM to 9 PM. -- Arwel 23:14, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIn most states, you can vote early, if you want. Voting at the polls in Florida is already a few days under way, and here in Washington State, where almost half the people vote by mail, most of those who do so have already received their ballots. -- Jmabel | Talk 05:53, Oct 21, 2004 (UTC)\n\nIt should be noted that, in most states in the US, absentee ballots are ludicrously easy to get, and are more and more common. One state (Oregon I believe) does only postal voting, something which will make election night absolutely strange. However, more directly: 7-8PM is the standard in each time zone, and this requirement is dictated in part by the fact that elections occur in early November, and darkness hits very early in lots of the US by then. You risk Meaning, if you're on the East Coast of the US, election night is an all-night affair as you wait for final returns to come in from the Pacific Coast, as while it usually takes mere minutes for projections to be released, the actual counts take hours. Hawaii and Alaska, Thank God, are (typically...after 2000 I hesitate to set any rules...) electorally insignificant. This is a Good Thing only because they are several hours off of even Pacific time. The results are usually not in until early Wednesday from those states, and life would be even more miserable for political junkies if Guam was a state. As is, I advise foreign people to be very gentle to Americans the next day, even if the election comes off fine; We'll be up all night this year, and thus rather sleep-deprived. --Penta 01:38, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nPolls in Kentucky and Indiana are the first in the country to close, doing so at 6 PM. However, western parts of both states (the areas around Bowling Green, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, Evansville, Indiana, and Gary, Indiana) are in the Central Time Zone and would close at 7 PM Eastern. A few more close at seven and in my state of Ohio they close at 730 PM, having opened at 630 AM. PedanticallySpeaking 14:10, Oct 23, 2004 (UTC)\n\nAs for voting by post, Oregon residents no longer go to the polls as the entire election is done by mail. In some states, any person can get an absentee ballot just by asking. In California, voters can request to be permanent absentee voters, meaning they automatically get a ballot by mail. In Ohio, one must have a reason as delinated on the form here. Among them: you are at least sixty-two, in jail (but not prison), out of the county, disabled, a fireman on duty, and working the polls. There is no process to check this, however, so if you claimed to be out of the county, no one could stop you. In West Virginia, if you claim you are disabled and can't get to the polls, you must present a note from your doctor verifying this. PedanticallySpeaking 14:16, Oct 23, 2004 (UTC)\n\nwhich is correct....\n\nwhat's at stake\n\nor\n\nwhats at stake?\n\n(this is used as the opening line to a paragraph in a promotional brochure)\n\nthank you.\n\n\"What's\" Chameleon 22:56, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI believe \"What's\" would be correct, as in \"What is at stake.\" I'm not even sure that \"whats\" without the apostrophe is a word. --Cvaneg 23:17, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIts only potential use, as far as I can postulate, is in casual speech or writing -- people talk about the \"whys and hows\" of doing things, so I suppose a use for \"whats\" can be envisioned (though I admit I can't think of any reasonable example at present). Jwrosenzweig 23:30, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nBut shouldn't one use apostrophes for plurals of words: \"why's and how's\"? mat_x 08:51, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nNo. To quote from the apostrophe article: \"its role in pluralization of symbols has led to a modern tendency to use the apostrophe incorrectly to form plurals of words, ... such as the movie title Dating Do's and Don'ts in which the first apostrophe is erroneous\". Gandalf61 11:16, Oct 20, 2004 (UTC)\n\nMaybe. Wikipedia's article notwithstanding, many guides allow its use to pluralize words \"not normally admitting of a plural\" (which is the quote that's stuck in my head from one guide), meaning words other than nouns, including proper nouns and adjectives used as nouns. As I recall the example was \"no if's, and's or but's\", so \"who's, what's, where's, when's and why's\" would follow, I think. It's ultimately up to you to decide whether whether your readers will figure out what you mean; \"dos\" even in lower case is a well-known acronym, but \"don't's\" looks like some dialectical \"doughnuts\". The Dating movie's producers may have chosen the least evil. At any rate, in the example, \"What's\" is certainly short for \"what is\" and certainly needs the apostrophe. Sharkford 13:28, 2004 Oct 20 (UTC)\n\nMaybe indeed.

In general, what's meaning \"what is\" is so common that I think it would be a mistake to ever use it as the plural of what. Where's and who's are even more clear-cut—if you intend for either to be a plural than it had better be exceedingly obvious from context! If's, and's, and but's are different in that one never contracts \"and is\", \"if is\" or \"but is\". In the example in question, though, the apostrophe almost certainly indicates a contraction of \"what is\", so all this debating is not strictly relevant (although very interesting).

Too much, really, for a non-specialist (i.e. me) to wade through in a reasonable time...so I looked for a review paper, and stumbled upon a 2002 review article (with 131 references) that seems exactly what is needed here (and might make a good starting point for a Wikipedia article on the topic): N. Goldstein, \"Reactive oxygen species as essential components of ambient air,\" Biochemistry (Moscow) 67 (2), 161-170 (2002). Abstract:\n\nIn this review evidence for the presence of the anion radical O2(-*) in atmospheric air is considered, and the biological activity of superoxide and negative air ions is compared. Various aspects of the biological effect of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species contained in air at the cell, tissue, and organism levels are discussed. The results of the therapeutic use of exogenous gaseous superoxide and low doses of H2O2 for the treatment of bronchial asthma, pain, and Parkinson's disease are reported. A hypothesis on the mechanism of physiological action of exogenous reactive oxygen species is discussed.\n\nI emailed a PDF of the article to the original poster, and would be happy to send a copy to anyone else who wants to write a Wikipedia article on the subject (put a note on my Talk page). —Steven G.

How does this affect the speed you run? Is there an equation to work out what a comparable speed that would be run on a smooth road? --[[User:OldakQuill|Oldak Quill]] 19:32, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhy do you think you don't have momentum? Momentum = mass * velocity. When you're running on the treadmill, your momentum (a vector) is countered by that of the treadmill's reverse motion, so the total momentum of runner + treadmill is indeed zero. Maybe I'm missing a point here -- it's been a while since I took physics. --jpgordon{gab} 21:51, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIndeederoonie. A treadmill runner is moving at exactly the same speed (and in just the same manner) with respect to the surface of the treadmill as a road runner is to the surface of the road. If this wasn't the case then one's gait would differ radically between the two, which it doesn't. In practice, a good quality treadmill has a springy surface (there's a plywood board or something under the belt) and so the treadmill has better energy-return characteristics than a tarmac road. This makes running on the treadmill a bit more efficient (not much, but enough to count). The benefits of this are, however, entirely countered by the undoubted fact that running on a treadmill is vein-openingly dull. - John Fader\n\nAlso, of course, a treadmill runnner doesn't experience the drag from air-resistance that a road runner would. I don't know if it would make much difference, but it'll have at least a slight effect. -- DrBob 01:58, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nOn a treadmill, you have zero momentum from the frame of reference of the ground.

Others have shown you the momentum is not the issue since you do have momentum relative to the moving track. There are two other effects to consider. Unless the road surface is perfectly flat, a constant incline on the treadmill will not be correct. Also in free surface running the runner will vary the speed they run, while the treadmil forces an even pace. My inclination is that this even pace is easier on an energy use basis, but varying the speed can help your legs feel better too sometimes. The difference between running on varying surfaces (and by extension a treadmill) can be studied by testing the heart rate and oxygen uptake, etc of the same runner or group of runners on each surface. If I recall correctly, the rule of thumb is that an incline of 2-3% is needed on a treadmill to approximate running on paved surfaces outdoors, but this varies depending on the incline of the outdoor surface, the wind speed, etc. Downhills force a much different (greater in many ways) stress on the leg muscles, and are hard to account for on most treadmills. Though I have heard of people training for them specifically by propping up the back of the treadmill. - Taxman 17:04, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)\n\nHow long is the growth cycle of morning glories?\n\nErowid sez that if the seeds are nicked and soaked, morning glories will flower six weeks after being sowed. --Neschek 18:07, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nwhat year did joseph stalin die?\n\nStalin died on March 5, 1953.

At this point I simply want confirmation that the game exists, and that my childhood was not a hallucination. The game is a simulation of the Space Shuttle program. It's very in depth, and you spend a bunch of time planning before you even get to the first launch. You have to purchase equipment, hire astronauts, schedule launches, and of course pilot the shuttle in outer space. I remember random details of the game, for example when you're landing you have to control your descent or else the tiles get damaged. When you're in orbit, the game deviates from reality and gives you a \"pod\" which you fly around in, and you can use it to grasp satellites and debris. You can perform experiments in space in order to earn government funding, and you can also launch commercial satellites.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember the name of this game.

But isn't remarkable the range of these answers, varying by 1,700 feet? PedanticallySpeaking 14:34, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)\n\nOne thing that might be a factor is that these are all heights above sea level. Given that Taiwan has fallen under the political control of mainland China, Japan, and of its own government, perhaps some of this variation reflects some numbers being with respect to different definitions of sea-level. Unfortunately Wikipedia's sea level article doesn't really compare values for different countries (something that would probably be rather hard, geoids and all. Still, sea level does mention a 20cm difference at Panama - if that's representative then this doesn't really address the significant differences you describe. - John Fader\n\nWhich countries are not democracies? Thanks, Gelu Ignisque.\n\nThis is a bit too broad of a question. It would involve the definition of a democracy and a large list of countries that don't fall within the scope of what is typically considered to be democratic. Also, you would have to discount countries that are working toward democracy, transitional (i.e. Iraq and Afghanistan) and those countries that call themselves democracies, but actually are not. I would try looking here if you would like to research this further on your own.

I would suggest looking at the Worldwide Press Freedom Index complied by Reporters Without Borders. 04:37, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)\n\nThis is a very complex question. What does it mean to be a democracy? You'll get some American libertarians who'll argue long and loud that their own country is a \"republic, not a democracy\" according to their (rather idiosyncratic) definitions of such, despite the fact that by most standards it's a fairly conventional representative democracy. And, by democracy, do you require that there be a number of political parties who alternatively control the government? What restrictions on universal suffrage are acceptable? How free from fraud should be electoral process be? How free does the press have to be? To give some examples, does Singapore count as a democracy? Did South Africa during the apartheid years? What about Mexico, where the PRI wins just about every election? How about Japan, where the LDP wins every election through rural malapportionment and massive pork to that narrow constituency? If I wished to be *really* provocative, you could argue that democracy in the United States isn't in such a healthy state, given the massive influence of financial donors and the chaotic electoral system. Not that I'd necessarily support the argument. --Robert Merkel 06:44, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nTechnically, the United States is a republic. It would be termed as a democratic republic. In order for it to be a technical democracy, every person would have to have the ability to vote on every issue. Since this is not a very pragmatic solution, we choose a democratic republic, but a republic all the same. Still, this is neither here nor there.

Tuf-Kat 14:27, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)\n\nAs odd as it may sound to some, that is partially a correct view, Tuf-Kat. \"Pure Democracy\" does not exist in the world (not on a national government level, at least). Just as \"Pure Capitalism\" and \"Pure Communism\" do not exist on a large scale. However, democracy does exist on smaller scales, such as Wikipedia and town halls across the world. Just as capitalism exists on smaller scales, such as certain derivatives markets and flea markets. Sorry for going slightly off-topic. Skyler1534 15:01, Oct 24, 2004 (UTC)\n\nDemocracy isn't necessarily direct democracy. \"Government by the people; that form of government in which the sovereign power resides in the people as a whole, and is exercised either directly by them (as in the small republics of antiquity) or by officers elected by them\" - from the OED definition of \"democracy\". (\"Republic\", on the other hand, is effectively meaningless in this kind of discussion - it just means that the Head of State isn't a monarch.) Proteus (Talk) 22:52, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nProteus, a lot of US conservatives and libertarians have their own definition of \"republic\" and \"democracy\", and when they speak of democracy, they refer exclusively to what the rest of us call \"direct democracy\". They will argue until they are blue in the face that their definition is correct and the rest of us have it wrong, though. It's a little bit like how in the Linux community \"hacker\" means something different to what the general public has in mind. --Robert Merkel 03:14, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhat you are really asking is: \"What does the word 'democracy' mean?\" You will get as many different answers to this as people you ask.

From my experience, there are three main ways to change the sound: loosen or tighten the head (the part you hit), loosen or tighten the part that causes the snare sound (it is stretched across the bottom, but i can't remember what it is called) or put something inside the drum (I used to use rolled up tissues. The purpose is to muffle the sound in some way.) If all else fails, you can just change the setting on any part of the drum that will move and hit it to see if the sound changes. You'll need a drum key for most of these changes. Anyplace the key will fit, try making it looser or tighter. Best of luck!

A drum (and anything else that is two-dimensional) has much more complicated vibrational modes than a string, but it's still one of the more simple models and any book on acoustics will include diagrams of the normal modes of a flat, circular object.\n\nI imagine it would not be difficult to show that hitting the drum at a node or antinode of an important vibrational mode (or at the nodes of different vibrational modes) will have different effects. (All I have with me at the moment are bell acoustic diagrams, which are not exactly the same, although they are related.) Of course, I am not familiar with snare drums; I don't know what effect the snare has or how audibly \"pitched\" the sound really is.\n\nThe vibrating string article gives formulas relating string tension to the frequency of vibration (see also Pitch (music)). It's a little different for a drum, but basically, increasing the tension will increase the frequency. The aforementioned book on acoustics will probably have a chapter discussing drums. It will certainly discuss the basics of the vibrating string. Depending on how in-depth the project is supposed to be, it may be enough to understand the basic concepts.

Is it just that fjords are a more direct product of glaciation? Can some (all) fjords be straits? To what extent are the terms interchangable? [[User:Rhymeless|Rhymeless | (Methyl Remiss)]] 07:07, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIIRC, a strait is any narrow body of water separating two large land masses (eg the straits of Malacca (sp?)), while a fjord is a deep body of water caused by glacier activity. I suppose you would use the most appropriate name for the task - is it more important that your body of water is defined as \"narrow and between two land masses\", or that your body of water \"is where a glacier once was\"? --inks 07:30, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe terms are not interchangeable at all. A strait is a narrow body of water connecting two bodies of water/separating two land masses e.g. the Cook Strait between the two main islands of New Zealand. A fjord is a flooded, heavily glaciated valley, and characteristically is a dead end, e.g. the Sogne Fjord is the longest fjord, at about 120 miles long, but it still comes to an end. Lim Fjord appears to be a misnomer! -- Arwel 10:10, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm trying to find info on the following questions in scientific articles, but the specific info I need is never mentioned in the articles I read.

A medical librarian should immediately recognize the request as it is a multivolume \"encyclopedic\" reference work. This is a good place to start. If I have time later, I'll see what I can find in Medline on wnt. You can refine your search by restricting to \"review\" articles that mention wnt and lipoprotein. I'll bet that makes it a manageable number.

So, assuming that American Catholics are the largest English speaking group of Catholics and that they are observant enough to follow biblical recommendations from the clergy, that should be the answer. Of course, I don't know if my assumptions are correct. --Cvaneg 22:40, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nAccording to Revised Standard Version, the Catholic Bible Association adopted the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition in 1965 and the New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition in 1989. I'm not sure how many people actually used the latter, as apparently there were some issues with the \"inclusive language\", but you can just bet that there are still a lot of people using the former. The New American Bible apparently has only been around since 1970, so I imagine there are still people using whatever came before that.\n\nFrom experience, the clergy tend to be a bit ahead of the laity with regards to what translation is preferred. I suppose what you really need is someone who has led Bible study groups with Roman Catholics. [[User:Aranel|Aranel (\"Sarah\")]] 00:28, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe other major versions are the Jerusalem Bible of 1966; the New Jerusalem Bible of 1985 and the Douay-Rheims Bible of 1752 but in use until quite recently.

Is the King James Version considered a protestant bible? ike9898 15:20, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)\n\nAt one time, all translations into vernacular language were treated with a strong disapproval. But, that was a long time ago. AFAIK, there are no special constraints about Bible translations. But, even among Protestants, only a minority place special emphasis on the KJV as their particular translation. Considering the flaws, great age, and difficulty in comprehension that the KJV suffers from, it is unlikely to have many Catholic takers. The KJV is still widely quoted because it sounds \"Biblical\" with all the \"thees\" and \"thous\", but I doubt there is much use of it in Catholic churches beyond quoting certain verses that everyone knows in KJV form. Diderot 15:32, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe Douay-Rheims Bible was first translated as a Catholic edition opposed to the Protestant ones, about the same time as the King James version. Both achieved similar long usage and both are still used by \"traditionalists\" among their respective groups. Generally the important difference between Protestant and Catholic Bible is the \"extra books\" in the Catholic ones which were included in the original King James translations and you can still get complete versions today. Rmhermen 17:24, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)\n\nYes, I believe the King James bible is considered a Protestant bible more or less. Also the above mentioned translation issues leave it not the version of choice for Catholics. Growing up catholic, at least in Michigan, we did not focus very much on the bible at all, especially in comparison to other Christian groups. The Catechism and the epistles and so forth were much more emphasized, just as they are in masses. - Taxman 18:52, Oct 26, 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhen someone is executed via a firing squad, will the impact of the bullets causes instant biological death?\n\nYou can read our article at firing squad. However, the article doesn't really cover this point, and your question can be interpreted in several ways. As I understand it (and I'm not an expert), if you are shot in the heart several times blood supply to the brain would end pretty much instantaneously, and according to the cardiac arrest article that leads to immediate loss of consciousness, though the death of brain nerve cells would take a couple of minutes after that. Would there be enough time for the executed person to percieve pain? Who knows? Not every body cell would die immediately, some would remain alive for some minutes afterwards.\n\nAs to the question of whether the executed person could be legally declared dead immediately after being shot, you might like to read our article on death and the difficulties of determining exactly when a person goes from being considered alive to being dead.\n\nFinally, in practice it is not unknown for firing squads to, for whatever reason, aim imprecisely, and leave their target terminally wounded to die a long, slow, painful death.

I have a minor (?) mental disability which results in transposing letters when I type. This was diagnosed by medical experts as a coordination problem. I also have auditory processing deficit (basically a delay in interpreting what we hear) and hyper focus, which can be a good thing, as you can get intensely into whatever you are paying attention to. These are all manifestations of adult add, which was diagnosed when I was 42.\n\nTo explain briefly, I had career in bus transportation, so I know how to spell \"fleet\". (duh?). When I type, I can mentally envision F-L-E-E-T, but it will come out as FLETE or something like that. This occurs every thrid to fuifth word on average, like this sentanec e I am typing right now, whcih i will refrain from cleaning up (sorry).\n\nWhen I manually print, the problem doesn't happen, and for years, at work I had help to do my typing (in the days before computers). I actually spell pretty well, but have to go back over every single word I ever type, even e-mail. Spell checkers on a computer were a godsend for me, and help enormously, although they don't catch it when I make another word by accident or when what I come out with is beyond the suggestions.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. I have tried working off-line in my word processor, but I am trained and used to an outdated one (Lotus Wordpro a.k.a. AmiPro) and it doesn't work very well with wiki formatting. I someday will need to earn MS word like the rest of the world, and have been doing that some. Copying previous work and editing it also is a workaround for me. I tried voice recognition stuff 8-10 years ago before I retired, but the results were poor. Expensive software or equipment is out of the question these days, as I am one of those seniors on a very fixed income.\n\nFor my Wikipedia contributions, I am mostly focused on history and people, places and railroads. I have been working on Virginian Railway and several related others items.

You asked me this on my talk page, but we may as well stick the discussion together.\n\nThere's a pretty good web-based spellchecker, though it seems to work almost too well, considering that, in testing it, I misspelled 'the' as 'teh' and it didn't mark it as wrong; turns out that 'TEH' can be an acronym for a few things.\n\nIf you're using Internet Explorer, there's an apparently gratis extension you can download called ieSpell. I haven't tried it and recommend Firefox. :-)\n\nSome other spellcheckers exist, but they tend to cost money. Here's a Google search for 'spell checker', which simply gets more results than 'spellchecker'.\n\nBy the way, if you do try a different word processor (and there's no reason to if you're happy with your current one), please give OpenOffice.org a try. Word is needlessly (for you, not MS) expensive.\n\nAnd of course remember that if you misspell things, only morons will whine about it and do nothing.

Your best bet would be to contact your local apartment/rental association or a lawyer who specializes in rental law. The amount of money spent on such services will vastly outweigh potential losses of rent as a result of an incorrectly executed eviction, or losses due to litigation regarding unintentional non-compliance with local rent laws.

Programmers and sysadmins who would otherwise have been deploying new apps spent '98 and '99 reworking old ones. Likewise, many new hires in those years who went straight into y2k work would have been reassigned to catchup work in '00, not let go. At any rate, there was a huge I.T. labour buildup in the U.S. throughout the late '90s owing to the phenomenon generally called the dot-com boom, which ended in a bust in early '02. It might be hard to discern y2k hiring effects against that background.

But I always have people warning me that these blankets can start fires. In fact, one friend who told me seemed to know what he was talking about - his company did repair work on houses that had been damaged by fires, floods, ect. BUT... It seems to me that if there really were that many fires caused by these blankets, some goverment agency (the Consumer Products Safety Commision?) would step in. Is this an urban lengend? (I've heard the same about Glade Plug-ins) ike9898 14:03, Oct 28, 2004 (UTC)\n\nLook for the UL label, or the CE logo where appropriate. In principle, these products are tested so that ordinary use shouldn't cause an unexpected risk of injury or property damage.\n\nIt does happen. [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] But, when the blanket isn't faulty due to poor manufacture, the insulation is intact, and the blanket isn't worn out, it is not supposed to be possible for it to cause house fires. An electric blanket is a device which draws electrical current with the intent to produce heat in a space where the heat is not quickly radiated away. There are inherent risks that don't go away under those conditions. I doubt any class of government regulation short of banning them could make them totally safe, and I imagine that the certification labs and the risk of lawsuits usually acts in lieu of comprehensive regulation.

[[User:MacGyverMagic|Mgm|(talk)]] 19:49, Oct 29, 2004 (UTC)\n\nIf the number lock is turned on, the keys of the numeric keypad will give you numerals instead of behaving as up and down arrows, etc. On my laptop, this is particularly useful, since it makes it much easier to get at special characters and such. See IBM PC keyboard and Num lock. [[User:Aranel|Aranel (\"Sarah\")]] 18:57, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIf you're on a desktop Mac, NumLock does nothing; it's just there on the \"Clear\" key for compatibility (with non-Mac OSs like Windows (in emulation) or Linux/Unix, I suppose).

If you're interested in citing Wikipedia, please see Citing Wikipedia --Neschek 22:05, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThis question is asked so often that I wonder if people know the meaning of the word 'cite' or 'citation'. Maybe we should change the title of the article to something more obvious, such as, Wikipedia:Who is the author of a Wikipedia article?, or How to use Wikipedia articles for your research paper. GUllman 03:42, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n\nYou can track the answer to this down by typing FAQ in the search box, which has a link to Wikipedia:FAQ -> Wikipedia:Readers' FAQ and that has a link to Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia. OK, it's a hell of a journey, but it's logical... I think. --[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod » .....TALKQuietly)]] 10:20, Nov 10, 2004 (UTC)\n\nFrom Neque porro est qui dolorem ipsum quiadolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit:\n\nI have been sent this message by a lost loved one. It is almost certainly from Dante. Can someone tell me what this phrase means, where it's from and what follows it in it's original source? This is extremely important to me, thank you.\n\n\" Neque porro est qui dolorem ipsum quiadolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit... \"\n\nmy email is (deleted, see history)\n\nIt means \"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain...\". Here's our writeup on what it's best known for: Lorem ipsum --jpgordon{gab} 02:10, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nI do not know if this will accomplish what I want. I am trying to find a simple Email contact to ask a question. I can find all kinds of data about deficiences in vitamin b-12, but I cannot find out what is undesirable about having too much in the system. A doctor removed my wifes consumption of a multiple vitamin because she had too much b-12 in her system. What could be the possible consequences of having too much? --anon\n\nThat's odd. The Institute of Medicine states that \"no adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin B12 intake from food and supplements in healthy individuals.\" Your doctor must be privy to some very exclusive information... As for finding an email contact, we generally don't encourage people to request email replies here, as it benefits all for answers to these questions to be public... but you didn't leave an email address anyway. Garrett Albright 04:45, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nAlthough B12 isn't believed to be harmful in itself, there are several reasons your doctor may wish her to stop taking it. Chiefly its a diagnostic tool - elevated serum B12 can be indicative of several conditions (including obesity, ulcers, diseases of the liver and kidney, diabetes, and certain metabolic imbalances). So if he's tested her blood and found elevated B12 it's quite reasonable that he ask her to stop taking a B12 supplement so he can be sure that it's the cause of the elevated B12, not one of those conditions. - John Fader\n\nhttp://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/idiom\n\nUnfortunetly, according to the GFDL license, no.

Could it have been a day trip? (How far is it?) Would there have been a stage coach (diligence)? Would the public be allowed close enough to get a good impression of the exterior? Probably hard questions to answer exactly, but any good guesses or estimates would also be much appreciated.--Bishonen 15:40, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nOff the top of my head, didn't the citizens march to Versailles in 1792 as a mob? I think it's less than 10 miles. Alteripse 17:08, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\n1789, actually -- and it was mostly women. --jpgordon{gab} 19:27, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nIn 1693? Dunno. But I can show you how to make the journey now. Go to mappy.com and enter \"Paris\" and \"Versailles\" under Itinerary. It is apparently 21.4 km from the centre of modern Paris to the centre of modern Versailles, taking an average of 29 minutes in a typical car. Chameleon 17:28, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nOh, cool, thank you both very much. If the mob could do it on foot, I guess a healthy young man would have made it an easy day trip, either on horseback or by diligence. Vanbrugh was to invent English baroque later, that's why I wondered if he could have seen Versailles. In 1693 he wasn't a sightseeing Grand Tour kid, but a political prisoner who'd just been let out of the Bastille and allowed to move freely in Paris only, but if Versailles is that close, I don't think it would have been a problem. He wasn't especially supposed to have tendencies to assassinate royals. Thanks.--Bishonen 18:27, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nEasy enough to get to on horse back and a popular day out for Parisians today. It might be on the edge of Paris now, but I would have thought Versailles would have been seen as a very separate village in 1693. Surely it would have meant leaving the city boundaries. -- Solipsist 08:01, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)"
