North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nCatchiness\n\nInteresting topic.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per its overall significance and only being Start class. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nNeutral – was previously a TAFI collaboration in early May 2013, but did not receive much in terms of significant improvements. The topic may not interest a great deal of editors, and the article may not actually be improved much. North America1000\n\nComment @Northamerica1000: If I remember correctly, Catchiness was previous a TAFI during the period when 7 or 10 articles were chosen per week, which severely diluted the effectiveness of the TAFI project because people were no longer guided towards one article over the week. During that period, contributions slumped across the board.--Coin945 (talk)\n\n@Coin945: Thanks for the input, and nice to hear from you. I'll retain my \"neutral\" for the time being, though. I'm not convinced that the topic will attract a great deal of improvements. However, I'm not opposing. North America1000\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – Upon further consideration, opposing, per my comment above (part of which has been struck).

North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nJust Do It\n\nInteresting topic.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per page view stats and cultural significance, also only Start class. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – A well known corporate trademark and slogan, but Nike makes more than enough money; doesn't need our efforts to help improve their market share in shoes and apparel. See also: Nike sweatshops (nominated below) and Sweatshop. North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nGeo-literacy\n\nInteresting topic.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nOppose per low page view stats, also already C class. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nOppose – Low page views, not of enough interest to many people.

I doubt this will actually attract many editors for significant improvements. Lowish to moderate overall page views. North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nDog–cat relationship\n\nInteresting article.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport - already OK article. But can be expanded.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nSupport as is only Stub class: also has significant page view stats. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nNot approved.

Donnie Park (talk)\n\nOppose – \"Interesting article\" and \"support per nom\" rationales don't convince me to support. Not sure this would actually be improved much over the course of a week. North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nWhat's done is done\n\nInteresting article.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport as is only Start class. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – It's an expression, but I'm not sure that this would need an entire week for improvements; this may not actually be improved much as per the topic's limited scope and actual potential for expansion. North America1000\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nWord recognition\n\nInteresting article.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per overall significance, also needs cleanup. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – Already fairly developed.

North America1000\n\nReader Rabbit\n\nSad article for iconic edutainment series.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport The article has only one source! Catmando999 Check out his talk page!\n\nOppose per only Low importance in its respective WikiProjects. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nComment @Rubbish computer:, the article's importance was incorrectly rated. I re-rated it as medium and high according to the Wikiproject.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per above points and high page view stats. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nOppose – Not finding many sources that are about the topic. There's a few usable ones, but it's not very extensive.\n\n–\n\n– North America1000\n\nWell, just find some more. Two sources is much better than one, three sources is better than two, but adding one extra source from an article with hundreds of citations is not such a huge difference (other than verification of a certain statement). Here, we need more citations for proving the article is notable and is of any value. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nIn this case, this article is notable, but not proved well enough. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nSupport - per every supporting point. Yes, many people know Reader Rabbit, yet it appears very in-universe. Needs more sources describing Reader Rabbits reception, development, etc. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nSupport per nom.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nApproved Looks like it is 3 net supports.

How much is actually written about this game in reliable sources? From a cursory search, many sources only provide passing mentions. North America1000\n\nOppose - just as Northamerica1000 says, reliable sources are not the main TAFI intention. I would much prefer improvement of the actual article content, rather than just source improvement. Source improvement is only complementary. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nNot approved.

Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport – Makes sense to have a complete encyclopedia. North America1000\n\nNeutral – Not supporting or opposing at this time. The content already exists in similar format compared to other list articles at Economy of Oceania, which includes a list. I'm not sure if this would be of strong interest to diverse editors over the course of a week. The list is already developed, so it just needs a few paragraphs summarizing the content of the list. Struck my initial !vote above. North America1000\n\nAbsolute support - because Wikipedia should not be fully Euro-biased or US-biased. Oceania is needed too. Well, we just need to get started with this article before we continue thinking about anything. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nComment - Coin945, looks like the actual page is: Economy of Oceania. Cheers! {{u|Checkingfax}} {Talk}\n\nSee this template for proof of my assertion above. I think the scope of currency lists and economics articles fall under different scopes anyway.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nNot approved. No further input after 21 days.

Lbertolotti (talk)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nSupport per nom. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Coin945 (talk • contribs)\n\nOppose – A simple topic about a business term. Would this actually be improved much? It seems that it's already defined in the article, so it's likely that expansion would involve documenting various business alliances that exist. E.g. \"Company A has an alliance with company B, here's what it entails\". North America1000\n\nOppose per Northamerica1000. Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)"
