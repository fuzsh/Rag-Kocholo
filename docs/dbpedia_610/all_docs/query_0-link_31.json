        "text": "Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?\n\n[edit]\n\nVery interesting discovery for me, as a lover of the Carmen Sandiego franchise. This state-specific game has scant sources on the internet, yet is a very fascinating piece of gaming history.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nOppose due to low page view stats and Low importance in WikiProject Video games. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nFWIW, I wouldn't base any decisions on the \"importance\" scale. Firstly, I find this scale very dubious personally and having little actual value due to the subjectivity of it all and lack of regulation. Secondly, most of the articles I nominated are very new, and the talk page templates were added swiftly after creation; the \"Low\" importance is the default choice despite it actually being true or not.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – Per the article, it's the \"arguably the least-known title in the franchise\". As such, it is unpopular, and the article receives low page views: 191 views in the last 30 days. Unlikely to attract much interest. North America1000\n\nOppose – As User:Northamerica1000 said, it's probably too obscure to secure enough interest. Graham (talk)\n\n{{Unapproved}}. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nChemistry (relationship)\n\n[edit]\n\nInteresting topic.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nOppose: may be better off merged with interpersonal relationship. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nOppose – Already fairly developed, most points appear to already be covered, and proposed for merging. North America1000\n\n{{Unapproved}}. No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nAdult interaction with infants\n\n[edit]\n\nInteresting article.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per overall significance. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport - per nomination.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – In poor shape, low page views, reads like a subjective essay. Rather than improved, it may need to be restarted from scratch (e.g. WP:TNT). North America1000\n\n@Northamerica1000: In your opinion, do you think there's a valid core article idea here? (i.e should it be TNTed or deleted)--Coin945 (talk)\n\n@Coin945: Parenting covers some aspects of this topic. I'm going to pass on researching the overall notability of the topic at this time.

No further input after 21 days. North America1000\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article that has fairly recently been delisted from GA status. This article has an extremely high number of page views, with more than 1 million views in the past 90 days. I think running this through TAFI would allow editors to quickly fix the issues of the article. sst✈\n\nSupport - per fact that it was delisted. Extremely high number of hits and the fact that the article could be improved and possibly expanded at some sections.BabbaQ (talk)\n\nSupport per above. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nOppose due to being too developed for this project.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nOppose – Already well-developed; unlikely to receive much improvement.

Hit #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport Potential for expansion and improvement. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nComment: I have changed the article's class to Start as it appeared too lengthly to be a stub, a rating automatically assigned to it. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nSupport - per nom.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nOppose – Unconvinced that an article about one song will receive much improvement over the course of a week. Many editors may not be interested in researching and expanding an article about one song. North America1000\n\nOppose - Controversial themes and not very interesting.--Sige |д･)\n\nOppose - The article doesn't appear sub-standered enough to merit a AFI. Catmando999 Check out his talk page!\n\nOppose - though I have known Jesus Christ Superstar before, this article is not substandard enough in ratio to its page views to merit an AFI. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nIzakaya\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article about a type of informal Japanese drinking establishment that serves food to accompany the drinks.

North America1000\n\nVandal Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nAn interesting historical kingdom from one of the most elusive periods.

Catmando999 Check out his talk page!\n\nOppose per only Low importance in its respective WikiProjects. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nComment @Rubbish computer:, the article's importance was incorrectly rated. I re-rated it as medium and high according to the Wikiproject.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nSupport per above points and high page view stats. --Rubbish computer (HALP!: I dropped the bass?)\n\nOppose – Not finding many sources that are about the topic. There's a few usable ones, but it's not very extensive.\n\n–\n\n– North America1000\n\nWell, just find some more. Two sources is much better than one, three sources is better than two, but adding one extra source from an article with hundreds of citations is not such a huge difference (other than verification of a certain statement). Here, we need more citations for proving the article is notable and is of any value. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nIn this case, this article is notable, but not proved well enough. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nSupport - per every supporting point. Yes, many people know Reader Rabbit, yet it appears very in-universe. Needs more sources describing Reader Rabbits reception, development, etc. Qwertyxp2000 (talk | contribs)\n\nSupport per nom.--BabbaQ (talk)\n\nApproved Looks like it is 3 net supports.

How much is actually written about this game in reliable sources? From a cursory search, many sources only provide passing mentions. North America1000\n\nOppose - just as Northamerica1000 says, reliable sources are not the main TAFI intention.

I'm not sure if this would be of strong interest to diverse editors over the course of a week. The list is already developed, so it just needs a few paragraphs summarizing the content of the list. Struck my initial !vote above. North America1000\n\nAbsolute support - because Wikipedia should not be fully Euro-biased or US-biased. Oceania is needed too.
