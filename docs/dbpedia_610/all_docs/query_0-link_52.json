        "text": "Throughout history we encounter some personalities who think ahead of their time and, in many cases, are misunderstood or even wronged. However, they all have one thing in common: they are geniuses who find impressive solutions to complex problems. This article aims to carry out, through bibliographical research using qualitative data analysis methodology, a historical review of one of the important personalities who wrote his name in history and has great relevance in the development of modern computing: Alan Mathison Turing or how it is known: Alan Turing. Considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, he made his great contribution to humanity by developing, in 1936, through an academic article, an automatic machine (\"a-machine\", which was later called the Turing), who could read and write different numbers and symbols. This article covers since his birth, covering his academic trajectory, understanding a little of his mentality and vision around machines and technological equipment, his partnerships and some interesting facts about his life. Thus, it can be understood that, even at that time, it was already possible to visualize the signs of the first computational logics and realize that machines have dynamics beyond human understanding, as they can also learn from humans and other machines and, best of all, Above all, transmit this knowledge with quality. Thus realizing the legacy and historical milestone that this British mathematician, computer scientist, philosopher and biologist left for the modern and contemporary world in which we live today.\n\nAlan Turing has a rightful claim to the title of father of modern computing. He laid the theoretical groundwork for a universal machine that models a computer in its most general form before World War II. During the war, Turing was instrumental in developing and influencing actual computing devices that have been said to have shortened the war by up to two years by decoding encrypted enemy messages that were believed by others to be unbreakable. Unlike some theoreticians, he was willing to be involved with practical aspects, and was as happy to wield a soldering iron as he was to wrestle with a mathematical problem, normally from a unique angle compared to others.\n\nSergei L'vovich Sobolev is the eminent mathematician whose work had a substantial influence on the development of twentieth century mathematics. Sobolev made fundamental contributions to the theory of partial differential equations, functional analysis, function theory, mathematical physics, and computational mathematics. Less well known is the fact that Sergei Sobolev was the founder of Computer Science in the USSR/Russia. He took active participation in the development of the architecture of the first Soviet computer M1 and in developing the first computer program in the USSR for \"atomic project\". Really in fact he was the first professional programmers in Russia. Thanks to him, theoretical and practical programming became scientific disciplines.\n\nThe social and organizational history of humanity is intricately entangled with the history of technology in general and the technology of information in particular. Advances in this area have often been closely involved in social and political transformations. While the contemporary period is often referred to by such names as the Computing and Information Age, this is the culmination of a series of historical transformations that have been centuries in the making. This course will provide a venue for students to learn about history through the evolution of number systems and arithmetic, calculating and computing machines, and advanced communication technology via the Internet. Students who take this course will attain a degree of technological literacy while studying core historical concepts. Students who complete this course will learn the key vocabulary of the computing discipline, which is playing a significant role in modern human thought and new media communications. The Hist..."
