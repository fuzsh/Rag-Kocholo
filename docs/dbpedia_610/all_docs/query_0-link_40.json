        "text": "How Much Time Should be Allocated to Extra Curricula Activities in Schools?\n\nExtracurricular activities are school-sanctioned undertakings outside academics. This may include sports, the performing arts, literary enhancements, leadership clubs, and many more forms of empowerment. Although not directly related to grades and academics, these activities are important for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to student development. These activities are designed to enhance special talents as well as to develop leadership qualities – things that are necessary parameters especially when a student has the desire to apply for college education.\n\nHowever it should be noted that these are extra activities and as such, should not take precedence over academic concerns. A student’s major priority is academics and passing the courses required of him or her. In order to maintain a good academic performance while having “extra” activities, a student should be able to strike the right balance and manage his or her time efficiently. There is no hard and fast rule as to how much time should be given because these things all depend on a individual’s capacity to multi-task.\n\nBe Inspired: Helen Keller\n\nNo story about defying the odds to get an education can be more inspiring than that of Helen Adams Keller. Despite being deaf and blind from childhood, she rose above her disability to become the first deaf-blind to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nHelen Keller was born a normal child on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama. At 19 months, she contracted an illness that had cost her sight and hearing. Her formal education started at 8 years old when she attended the Perkins Institute for the Blind.\n\nMost deaf persons are mute simply because they cannot hear and learn spoken language. But not with Helen. She was so determined to communicate with others as normally as possible that she eventually learned to speak and became a famous speaker around the world. She is also known for her literary excellence.\n\nHelen spent most of her life traveling the world speaking her convictions and inspiring millions of lives to rise above their circumstance.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller\n\nBe Inspired: Dr. Jose Rizal\n\nJose Rizal the national hero of the Philippines and pride of the Malayan race, was born on June 19, 1861, in the town of Calamba, Laguna. At the age of 3, he learned the alphabet from his mother; at 5, while learning to read and write, he already showed inclinations to be an artist. He astounded his family and relatives by his pencil drawings and sketches and by his moldings of clay. At the age 8, he wrote a Tagalog poem, “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” the theme of which revolves on the love of one’s language.\n\nHe had always excelled in school and studied in Spain to be a doctor to help her mother who was going blind. He had so many accomplishments but the one that gained him the most respect from people all over the world was to seek political and social reforms for his country through education instead of bloody revolutions. He is famous for his statement that the youth are the hope of the fatherland.\n\nSource: http://www.joserizal.ph/bg01.html\n\nBullying in Schools\n\nBullying in schools has become so prevalent and is no longer confined to congested public schools but has now spread in private schools where children of well-to-do families attend. It was once believed that troublesome children are only found in underprivileged families. However, this is entirely untrue.\n\nBullying can take many forms – from subtle intimidation to actually inflicting physical injuries on their hapless targets. Finding a solution to these increasing incidents of school violence should merit the immediate attention of not only school officials concerned, but also of the police force and the whole community. Public awareness should be increased and cooperation (such as reporting of incidents) should be encouraged so that proper intervention can take place.\n\nKids who are being bullied should be encouraged to speak out and parents should be keen observers in the change of behavior of their children towards school. This can be a telltale sign that the child is being bullied.\n\nBe Inspired: Dr. Philip Emeagwali\n\nDr. Philip Emeagwali, who has been called the “Bill Gates of Africa,” was born in Nigeria in 1954. Like many African school children, he dropped out of school at age 14 because his father could not continue paying his school fees. However, his father continued teaching him at home and everyday, Emeagwali performed mental exercises such as solving 100 math problems in one hour. His father taught him until Philip “knew more than he did.”\n\nGrowing up in a country torn by civil war, Emeagwali lived in a building crumbled by rocket shells. He believed his intellect was a way out of the line of fire. So he studied hard and eventually received a scholarship to Oregon State University when he was 17 where he obtained a BS in mathematics. He also earned three other degrees – a Ph.D. in Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan and two Masters degrees from George Washington University.\n\nDr. Philip Emeagwali is known as the inventor of the world’s fastest computer.\n\nSource: http://www.black-inventor.com/Dr-Philip-Emeagwali.asp\n\nBe Inspired: Albert Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. In 1896, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics.\n\nEinstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance. Among his most famous works are the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics.\n\nEinstein’s gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for relaxation, music played an important part in his life.\n\nSource: http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html\n\nBe Inspired: Introduction\n\nHistory has given us great people who we can look up to and get inspiration from. Many of them have trodden paths that are not popular and have faced challenges that would daunt the faint-hearted. Yet, despite the odds, they continued to pursue the things that they believed would be better for the empowerment of humanity.\n\nIt is said that everything in this world happens twice – first in the mind, then in reality. These inspiring people are concrete examples of perseverance, of tenacity and of fortitude. I once heard that a man with a dream can never be denied. Some of our next articles will be our salute to those who chose to take the challenge of trailblazing and succeeding.\n\nSome of these people include:\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nAprille Ericsson\n\nDr. Jose Rizal\n\nDr. Phillip Emegwali\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\nProf. Ernest Izevbigie\n\nSir Isaac Newton\n\nThomas Alba Edison\n\nHelen Keller\n\nTake advantage of School’s Open Day\n\nOpen days are wonderful opportunities for parent and teacher interaction. It is also an avenue where parents meet other parents and for parents to take a glimpse of what is going on in school. It is a day of fun and discovery. It is also a day where parents can discuss with their children special concerns regarding their child’s education.\n\nFor a lot of schools in Nigeria, an open day is also a way of promoting your school. When parents see that their children are learning through the many activities that they are doing, they are apt to give a good word about the school to their friends. It is a good “word of mouth” marketing strategy.\n\nBoth the school and parents can take advantage of this to fit their purposes. The school can use this medium to re-assure the parents that they are getting their money’s worth by show-casing the several achievements of the pupils. The parents too can get better and direct understanding of their ward’s challenges and victories in school.\n\nPlaying Hooky! (The Truant Student’s Guide)\n\nI am a truant student and I think it’s cool. Well actually there are a few of us in school who belong to this cool club. We are all smart kids and school doesn’t interest us anymore. I can spend my time playing video games and not worry about not passing the exams. Didn’t I tell you I am smart?\n\nSo here’s what I do. I make sure to leave for school early as usual so mom and dad will think their little angel is in school learning. Of course I don’t want them to worry about me – well what they don’t know won’t hurt them, right? Teacher is too busy with the other kids so I am sure she will have no more time telling my parents. Or does she even know I am missing?\n\nOn the few days I go to school, you know, to keep up appearances, Archie Comics keep me company. Who has time or energy for boring school books?! Certainly not me!\n\nThe principal said to study for empowerment, bla bla bla……… Who says Archie doesn’t empower me?!\n\nFor now, I’ll just enjoy my little shot at freedom. School and education can wait til I get older, iThink………. iHope."
