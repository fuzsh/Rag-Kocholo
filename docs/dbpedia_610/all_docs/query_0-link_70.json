        "text": "Share this\n\nA few citizens of South Africa don’t know who Nigerians are.\n\nAlthough black South Africans suffered immensely due to racist ideas and racist oppression, I have observed that racism has become internalized by some, not all, South Africans and those individuals are unable to see greatness in others, only absurd stereotypes about Nigerians.\n\nSo, allow me to re-introduce us, particularly the Nigerians you haven’t met yet, who have no plans to come to your country.\n\nWe are Africa’s most populous country and its largest economy. Nigeria makes up 3% of the world’s population, 20% of Africa’s population, and is the 7th most populous country on earth.\n\nWe accommodate at least 372 nations; people groups each with its own unique languages, cultures and shared histories. There is no other African country with this level of diversity.\n\nSome of the smartest, richest and most creative Africans come from Nigeria. Achievements are not new to Nigeria.\n\nLargest African Empires of all time\n\nThe largest Empire in African history was founded by a native from among the Faru people of Sokoto, Sonni Ali[1]. Under his rule, Songhai Empire reached a size of over 1,400,000 square kilometers, exceeding the peak size of the Axumite kingdom.\n\nThe extent of the Songhai Empire at its peak under Sonni Ali\n\nThe second largest Empire in African history was founded by a Fulani man from Nigeria, Usman Dan Folio. Usman Dan Folio was a Fulani who was born in Gobir. He belonged to the Toronkawa clan. The state he founded in 1804 would go on to shape Nigeria later in 1914 when the Southern Protectorate of Nigeria was merged with the Northern Protectorate of Nigeria.\n\nPolitical sophistication\n\nWhile South Africans are proud of the Zulu kingdom, it will shock you to discover that over the last 3,500 years Nigeria has produced more than 100 political states.\n\nMost notably:\n\nNok civilisation\n\nThe Aro Confederacy\n\nThe Benin Kingdom\n\nThe Hausa kingdoms (Gobir, Katsina, Zaria etc.)\n\nThe Ife Kingdom\n\nThe Igala kingdom\n\nThe Itsekiri Kingdom\n\nThe Kanem Bornu Empire\n\nThe Kwararafa Federation\n\nThe Nri Theocracy\n\nThe Nupe kingdom\n\nThe Oyo Empire\n\nAn illustration of the Benin kingdom, a pre-colonial empire located in what is now southern Nigeria. Pic credit: Melanin Mind\n\nLargest cities in Africa\n\nLagos, Nigeria\n\nLagos is the most populous state in Nigeria and also the most populous state in the whole continent of Africa. Lagos is 35% of the size of the whole of South Africa. Lagos is also one of the fastest growing cities in the World, and a major financial centre in all of Africa. The Lagos city was settled in the 15th century and founded by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba. The city has a total population of 21 million people and has an area coverage of 452.23 square miles (1,171.28 square kilometers) and a population density of 17,800 per square mile (6,871 per square kilometer). The population growth rate of Lagos is between 2 to 3% annually. Lagos also generates about $90 billion annually to the GDP of the country, the economy, unlike most areas in the country, is not dependent on oil production but depends on manufacturing, transportation, construction, and other sectors of the economy. The GDP of Lagos is 26% of the entire GDP South Africa managed in 2019.\n\nKano, Nigeria\n\nKano is one of the top 15 largest cities in Africa. Kano city is the capital of Kano state in the North Western part of Nigeria. The origin of Kano (and the concomitant Hausa states) dates back to between the 5th and 7th century of our era, the earliest recollection of female queen and matriarch called Queen Magajiya Kofana, Queen of the Kufufu. Modern Kano city is regarded as the commercial center of the Northern part of the country and also the second largest city in Nigeria after Lagos. Geographically, it is located in the Sahelian region, south of the Sahara.\n\nLargest People Groups in Africa\n\n4 of the largest tribes in Africa are to be found in Nigeria. These include the Fulani (the sixth largest in Africa with 40 million people), the Igbo (3rd largest with 45 million people), the Yoruba (the 2nd largest with 47 million people) and the Hausa (with 74 million people).\n\nOther Great Historical Icons of Nigeria\n\nQueen Amina of Zaria (Zazzau), artist illustration.\n\nQueen Amina, warrior queen, with her 1,000 cavalry troops.\n\nArtists\n\nOdinigwe Benedict Chukwukadibia Enwonwu MBE, better known as Ben Enwonwu, is a famous painter and sculptor.

The first terrestrial television broadcast signals in Africa occurred on Saturday October 31, 1959 and belonged to the Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTS). This was a critical milestone in Television history and today Africa boasts of over 600 television stations (excluding repeater stations).\n\nLongest bridge in Africa. The 3rd mainland bridge used to be the longest bridge in Africa. It measures about 11.8 km in length. It was completed by Nigeria in 1990. Later in 1996, Egypt completed the 6th October bridge which is 20.5 km long.\n\nLongest road in Africa. Trans-African Highway 7 (TAH 7), the Dakar-Lagos Highway, measuring 4,010 km (2,490 mi): also known as the Trans–West African Coastal Road, which is about 80% complete is the longest road in Africa.\n\nThe ancient Kano walls were built between 1095 and 1134 during the reign of Sarki Gijimasu (King Kijimasu) and completed in the 14th century; and measure 40 ft. thick at base, 30 to 50 ft. in height (15m) with 15 gates.\n\nWalls of Benin. Work first began around 800 AD and continued up until around 1460. The structure upon completion comprised of moats and ramparts, covered a border distance of about 16,000 kilometres, the 16,000 sq. kilometres and enclosed about 6,500 square kilometres of community land in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlements. Altogether this was double the length of the Ming Great Wall of China, which measured 8,851 kilometres. The new official length of 21,196 kilometres was announced on June 5th 2012, after the discovery of the Walls of Benin displaced the Great Wall of China, under its old measurements. You can see from the image below what China did to reach 21,196 km from 8,851 km.\n\nWealth\n\nRichest black man in the world (2013 – 2021): Aliko Dangote\n\nRichest black woman in the world (2015 – 2021): Folorunso Alakija\n\nPower & politics\n\nMost powerful black man in Africa – Aliko Dangote\n\n1st most powerful black woman in Africa – Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\n\n2nd most powerful black woman in Africa – Folorunso Alakija\n\nFirst opposition Presidential candidate to defeat an incumbent from a different political party – Muhammadu Buhari (2015).\n\nMost complex democracy in Africa.

The Medal for Distinguished Services is an annual medal awarded to pioneering and deserving American doctors.\n\nDuring the Atlantic slave trade many cures and medicines were discovered from West Africans and Central Africans. For instance, one doctor, Thomas Winterbottom, recommended that Europeans should learn more from west African remedies for dysentery:\n\n‘But their most celebrated remedy, and one which deserves more particular attention from Europeans, is the bark of a large tree, called by the Foolas, bellenda; and by the Soosoos and Mandingoes, bembee; rondeletia Africana It is employed either in powder mixed with boiled rice, or is used in a strong infusion. This bark is an agreeable astringent, possessing somewhat of a sweetish taste. A quantity of this bark was sent to me at Free Town, from the Rio Nunez, where it had been used with very great success in an epidemic of dysentery which prevailed among the slaves in the factories of that river. I had not an opportunity of trying its effects in dysentery, as a case of that disease did not occur in the colony from the time I received the bark until I left the country; but in several instances of diarrhoea it shewed itself very effectual. After my arrival in London I gave some of it to my friend Dr. Willan, who made trial of it in agues, fevers, sore throat and dysentery, very much to his satisfaction.’ (Winterbottom, vol 2, 1803, p45–6)\n\nActing\n\nChiwetel Umeadi Ejiofor CBE.

Important general sources are E. W. Bovill, The Golden Trade of the Moors (1958; 2d ed. 1968); J. Spencer Trimingham, A History of Islam in West Africa (1962); and J. O. Hunwick, “Religion and State in the Songhay Empire, 1464-1591,” in the International African Seminar, Islam in Tropical Africa, edited by I. M. Lewis (1966). ↑"
