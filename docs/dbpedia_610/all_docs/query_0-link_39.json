Each individual that I love and trust, helps me to push past the difficulties and challenging times that may occur. With their support, I am the person you see today!\n\nWho inspires you or do you believe is important to highlight for Black History Month?\n\nMy great-great grandfather Bishop John Silas Holly! He was an apostolic pioneer here in the heart of Bronzeville and a leader that many around the world followed!\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nTo work at a high tech company and learn the important skills and techniques to take and share with the youth!\n\nWhat does Black Excellence mean to you?\n\nBlossom Egbuonu Heading link\n\nBlossom Egbuonu\n\nComputer Science, Undergraduate Student\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\nDescribe a proud moment you have had at UIC\n\nA proud moment I had at UIC was being a TA for CS113 at UIC which was the first Computer Science class I took at UIC. It marked a full circle from student to mentor, allowing me to share my knowledge and passion for computer science with new students.\n\nWhat student organizations or groups are you a part of at UIC?\n\nNational Society Of Black Engineers, African Student Council, DuSable Scholars Program\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to succeed academically?\n\nI am motivated by the belief that education is the most powerful weapon you can own. My drive to represent underrepresented groups in tech and to use my skills for global impact, especially in Africa, fuels my academic success.\n\nWho inspires you or do you believe is important to highlight for Black History Month?\n\nPhilip Emeagwali is a significant source of inspiration for me. He is a Nigerian computer scientist who gained global recognition for his work in developing a formula used for supercomputing in the oil reservoir modeling industry.\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nAfter graduation, I plan to join a tech company to continue growing my expertise in software engineering and contribute meaningfully to the industry. Academically, I plan on attending graduate school for either a Master‚Äôs in Computer Science or an MBA, to further enhance my skills and knowledge.\n\nWhat does Black Excellence mean to you?\n\nGiorgia Asamoah Heading link\n\nGiorgia Asamoah\n\nBiomedical Engineering, Undergraduate Student\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nFrom Bolingbrook Illinois, family from Ghana, born in Italy\n\nDescribe a proud moment you have had at UIC\n\nMy second semester here as a transfer student, I had a group project that could be on any topic. The people in my group refused to help me or add to the project so I ended up choosing the topic, researching it, performed the modeling, and presented the project basically entirely on my own. My project was titled ‚ÄúDetecting Depression in Brain activity with EEG frequency bands‚Äù. I was upset at how the project played out and I was nervous about not getting a good grade. But, to my surprise, everyone in the class was very impressed with my project and its findings and I still get comments today ‚Äì 2 years later ‚Äì from classmates who remember that presentation and really enjoyed it. This proved to me my ability to succeed even when the odds are stacked against me.\n\nWhat student organizations or groups are you a part of at UIC?\n\nNational Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to succeed academically?\n\nHonestly, my parents, as cliche as it sounds but they were the first people to reiterate education to me. They were the first people that encouraged me to excel in my classes and not just pass. Also, I just love learning because education is one of the things no one can take away from you and I am a true believer that knowledge is power.\n\nWho inspires you or do you believe is important to highlight for Black History Month?\n\nAny Black medical professional inspires me. Any Black professional that knows what it feels like to be the only Black person in a class, or knows how it feels to be first generation, or knows how it feels to be doubted. Black professionals that hold positions to let other Black students know it‚Äôs possible deserve to be celebrated for Black History Month. Representation means everything.\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nTo find a neural engineering position preferably or any other biomedical engineering positions\n\nWhat does Black Excellence mean to you?\n\nJeremiah Benjamin\n\nComputer Science, Undergraduate Student\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nChicago, IL\n\nDescribe a proud moment you have had at UIC\n\nPromoting DEI in STEM\n\nWhat student organizations or groups are you a part of at UIC?\n\nNSBE\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to succeed academically?\n\nMaking god/myself/my family/my community proud, in that order.\n\nWho inspires you or do you believe is important to highlight for Black History Month?\n\nClarence Ellis\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nWork full time as a software engineer üôÇ\n\nWhat does Black Excellence mean to you?\n\nRashaun Muhammad\n\nIndustrial Engineering with a Minor in Business Administration, Undergraduate Senior\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nChicago, IL\n\nDescribe a proud moment you have had at UIC\n\nLast summer, I had the honor of engaging in undergraduate research alongside my faculty advisor, Dr. Quintin Williams. Dedication and effort were poured into crafting a presentation focusing on musculoskeletal disorders resulting from medical tools used by female surgeons. The culmination was presenting before esteemed UIC faculty and fellow researchers, receiving positive feedback that left me immensely proud of the time invested in the project.\n\nWhat student organizations or groups are you a part of at UIC?\n\nNSBE, SHPE, IISE\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to succeed academically?\n\nThe sacrifices and time invested by both myself and my family have fueled not only my academic drive but also my path to success.\n\nWho inspires you or do you believe is important to highlight for Black History Month?\n\nThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad is an individual who I believe should be highlighted this black history month due to his wealth of knowledge and his immense positive impact on black culture.\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nUpon graduation, my aspiration is to thrive in a supply chain and logistics role, laying the foundation for my ultimate goal‚Äîestablishing and successfully managing my own engineering consulting firm in the future.\n\nWhat does Black Excellence mean to you?"
