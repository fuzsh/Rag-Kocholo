        "text": "Philip Emeagwali Lecture\n\nVisit http://emeagwali.com for complete transcripts of 100+ lectures.\n\nVideo: https://YouTube.com/emeagwali\n\nPodcast: https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\n9 What is Philip Emeagwali Famous For?\n\n9.1.1.1 The Hero’s Quest\n\nAt 8:15 on the morning\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe U.S. Independence Day,\n\nI saw something\n\nthat had never been seen before.\n\nBy seeing something\n\nwhere nothing existed,\n\nthe discoverers and inventors\n\nmade darkness visible.\n\nThe inventor\n\nembarked upon a hero’s quest\n\nto hear something\n\nthat was previously unheard;\n\nto see something\n\nthat was previously unseen;\n\nand to understand something\n\nthat was previously misunderstood.\n\nTrying to understand an invention\n\nwithout the life story of its inventor\n\nis like looking at an embroidery\n\nfrom the wrong side of the cloth.\n\n9.1.1.2 The Eureka Moment!\n\nOn that U.S. Independence Day,\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nI made the first experimental measurement\n\nof the world’s fastest computation\n\never recorded across\n\nan ensemble of processors\n\nthat is a new internet.\n\nThat invention\n\nrepresents a new way\n\nof looking at the computer.\n\nTo be the first\n\nis a greater achievement\n\nthan to be number one\n\nor to be the fastest.\n\nThere’s only one first\n\nbut they will be many fastest.\n\nI was the first to discover that\n\nparallel processing across\n\nan ensemble of the slowest processors\n\nis faster than sequentially processing\n\nonly on the fastest processor,\n\nor doing so only on the fastest supercomputer.\n\nBack in 1989,\n\nit was my most pleasurable experience\n\nto be the first-person-ever\n\nto stand at the farthest frontier\n\nof human knowledge\n\nand see\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nthat is the precursor\n\nto the modern computer.\n\nOn the night of the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI had a powerful, unsettling dream.\n\nI woke up with the visceral feeling\n\nthat I had permanently entered\n\ninto the history book\n\nand into school reports.\n\n9.1.1.3 Philip Emeagwali Invention\n\nI witnessed the birth cry\n\nof a new computer\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nthat is outlined\n\nas a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nthat were identical and equal distances apart.\n\nEach processor operates\n\nits own operating system.\n\nEach processor\n\nhas its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shares nothing with each other.\n\nI trembled because I saw a supercomputer\n\nthat no human had ever seen before.\n\nI saw an ensemble\n\nof the slowest processors\n\nin the world\n\noutperform the fastest supercomputer\n\nin the world.\n\nI got goose bumps\n\nand my hairs stood on end\n\nwhile I watched my invention unfold.\n\nSeeing, for the first time ever,\n\nthe slowest processors compute together\n\nto compute faster than\n\nthe fastest supercomputer\n\nwas the most amazing experience\n\nin my life.\n\n9.1.1.4 The Paradigm Shift\n\nI trembled because I was witnessing\n\nthe birth of a new era\n\nin the history of the computer.\n\nI trembled because I was witnessing\n\na paradigm shift\n\nin the supercomputer world.\n\nI trembled because I was witnessing\n\na change of tectonic proportions\n\nthat will forever affect the way\n\nour distant descendants of Year Million\n\nwill think about their version of the computer.\n\nI trembled because my dreams\n\nand my illusions had become reality.\n\nI got goose bumps because\n\nI was gazing across the centuries\n\nand into one thousand millennia.\n\nThat Fourth of July 1989\n\nmarked the moment\n\nwe changed the way we looked at\n\nthe modern supercomputer\n\nand changed the technology\n\nfrom an old computer\n\nthat computed with only one electronic brain\n\nto a never-before-seen supercomputer\n\nthat executes the fastest computations\n\nand compute them across\n\na never-before-seen internet\n\nthat was outlined by millions upon millions\n\nof electronic brains.\n\nThat Fourth of July 1989\n\nmarked the moment\n\nwhen for the first time ever\n\nan ensemble of the slowest processors\n\ncomputed together\n\nand computed as one seamless, cohesive unit\n\nand computed faster than\n\nthe fastest supercomputer.\n\nFor me, Philip Emeagwali,\n\nthat Fourth of July 1989\n\nwas a day of fire,\n\nthe day the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nbecame the fire we can’t put out.\n\nAfter my discovery on that day,\n\ntrying to stop the acceptance of\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer\n\nbecame like trying to stop midnight.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat using only one processor\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics\n\nwas like putting the wings\n\nof a jet aircraft\n\nupon an ocean liner.\n\nMy paradigm shift\n\nwas from computing in the singular\n\nto both simultaneously computing\n\nand communicating\n\nin the plural senses.\n\n9.1.1.5 Benefits of Philip Emeagwali Supercomputer"
