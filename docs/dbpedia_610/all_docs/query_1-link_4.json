        "text": "If you could pass this question on to the President. Back in the early years, there was a man who lived in Germany from what we call the beginning of time. This man was called King Henry 1st. Ok Im talking about history from the past, but King Henry 1st going back 23 generations ago was my grandfather. Where Lord John was his son, and King John of England, all are my grandfathers. I do have all of the proof of all of this. I have the real last name as well as the last name that is in the books that we already know of. As strange as it sounds, the family has married into the Stuart-Stewart family. Not just once but several times. But on April 13 of 2002 there was another joining of the two family`s again. When my wife and I joined for the last time. I know that the house of King Henry the 1st is in Afterburner. Yes I would love to live there, but that house belongs to Germany.\n\nWhat Im trying to say is that the President of Germany has very little power, but the grandson of King Henry the 1st, I should have the right to say if the President shoud receive more power than what he has right now.\n\nYes you have a President, but I place as a Prince as well as a King. According to the family history. So I should have a say so of the power.\n\nYou can write to me at the following address. royalfamily2@myway.com I will await for your resp-once.

Sorry, but you have no sovereignty over Germany. Garrett Albright 06:00, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nIt's a shame Germany is a republic. England however isn't. Since you are the grandson of King John perhaps you could lay claim to the English throne? Our own royal family have been shown to be somewhat lacking of late. The Queen is OK of course but she can't live forever, what will happen when she dies? Many people don't like the thought of Prince Charles becoming king, perhaps a new pretender would solve those problems. Of course the royal family don't have any real power nowadays but they do get to live in a nice big house. Anyway it's just a thought. theresa known 08:42, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC) watch out for the lockness monster he`s dangerous\n\nAfter 23 generations pretty much everyone in Britain has some family connection to royalty, particularly on the wrong side of the sheets -- and many people have a closer connection than Henry I - Charles II was particularly prolific with his mistresses!

Arwel 11:28, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nFunnily enough, somebody has just recently discovered evidence that the entire British royal family has been illegitimate for about 500 years. I'm not joking! It should have gone to the Duke of Clarence instead of Edward IV.

So the legitimacy of Edward IV is no more than an interesting historical question. Gdr 11:53, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)\n\nWell i don't know my history all that well but I'm pretty sure that Henry Tudor took the throne by force from Richard III.

A'dish on the other hand is a little weird. Personally I think the whole thing is pretty dumb but hey, he's the owner of the company, you might as well resign yourself to the fact that you have to put up with his silliness. moink 16:49, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nSee if you can get any ideas out of List of company name etymologies.

Thanks, moink 16:46, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nPresumably that change was on the basis of his having been born in Groningen, NL; on the other hand he did live in Switzerland for nearly 60 years.

On the basis that he spent more than 2/3rd his life in Switzerland I'd call him Swiss!

The site is VERy professionally done but I thougth I will, if I may, make a suggestion that may help.\n\nI am a web developer and we now see a much greater tendancy for Internet pages to be displayed in a font that is not Times New Roman. I agree that in a printout form Times New Roman is often the font of choice but for displaying on a monitor, as Wikipedia is intended, a font such as Verdana is more advisable. You will se my point when you look at two of teh biggest sites in teh world: www.microsoft.com and www.bbc.co.uk, they are both designed on the Verdana font and are much easier to teh eye when displayed on a monitor.\n\nAs i understand, it isn't that difficult to change the font and I strongly recommend that the Wikipedia webpages be changed to Verdana font. -- Thank you, Alom\n\nAlom, a signed in user can select an alternate stylesheet \"Cologne Blue\", which has a sans-serif (I think it might well be Verdana) font. I think the reason the \"classic\" stylesheet remains the default is partially inertia, and partially the rather poorer handling of some older browsers with sans-serif fonts (and we do try very hard to sustain even the most antique browser). -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 22:01, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nSince when did \"teh\" Microsoft become an authority on graphic design? I mean, have you seen Windows XP's default appearance? Ug. I know the \"experts\" say that sans-serif fonts are better for screen design, but in my experience (I am also a web designer, of seven years) that applies more for short pieces of text (such as a list of links in a menu) than for long chunks of it as in a Wikipedia article. Garrett Albright 22:32, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n\nAlso, if you use a good browser like Mozilla or its derivatives, you can choose your own font preferences. -- Wapcaplet 03:04, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI personally think Times is underrated. It is a beautiful and highly readable font if only given proper spacing between the lines (preferrably 1.5em). Headings should always be sans-serif, though. Fredrik 20:57, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nSome people say that Times is too narrow (horizontally), as it was'nt designed for books but for newspapers, which have narrow columns. -- Stw 17:38, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm confused- and wondering if there are any vice-presidential trivia buffs that could clear something up for me. According to this article, Thomas Hendricks served as Grover Cleveland's first VP, but died in 1885. It says that he was succeeded as VP by Levi P. Morton, who didn't enter office until 1889. Was there no one in the VP spot for those four years? Why wasn't someone promoted to VP, in following with United States Presidential line of succession? - DropDeadGorgias (talk) 22:50, Mar 31, 2004 (UTC)\n\nAt the time of Hendricks' death, the constitutional amendment allowing for a replacement for a vacant Vice Presidential office wasn't in effect. Whenever a Vice President died or resigned, the office was left vacant until the next election. The appropriate amendment was Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1967. RickK | Talk 02:55, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nCould someone explain how the math works in the following trick? I realize that in this case, the \"phone-number\" is just a number in the millions, but what is the formula?\n\n1. Grab a calculator. (you won't be able to do this one in your head) 2. Key in the first three digits of your phone number (NOT the area code) 3. Multiply by 80 4. Add 1 5. Multiply by 250 6. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number 7. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number again. 8. Subtract 250 9. Divide number by 2 10. The answer is YOUR PHONE NUMBER.\n\nSincerely, Kingturtle 00:34, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nEasy enough. Say the 1st 3 digits of your phone number is \"x\" and the last 4 digits are \"y\". Then the whole phone number is 10000x+y.\n\nYou multiple \"x\" by 80: 80x\n\nAdd 1: 80x+1\n\nMultiply by 250 : 250(80x+1) = 20000x + 250\n\nAdd \"y\" twice: 20000x + 250 + 2y\n\nSubtract 250: 20000x + 2y\n\nDivide by 2: 10000x + y\n\nVoila! --DrBob 00:41, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nNicely demonstrated. →Raul654 00:43, Apr 1, 2004 (UTC)\n\nMinor point. We don't all have 7 digit phone numbers.\n\nDrBob, thanks. But all you've done is the basic math again, which I already knew. I should rephrase my question. Why those specific numbers? why add one? Why multiply by 250 and later subtract 250? Kingturtle 01:21, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nYou can pick any numbers or procedures you like. If you generalise this procedure completely, and work through to get an algebraic expression, you can proceed again assuming a 7 digit phone number, with x and y as before, the phone number is 10000x+y.\n\nMultiply x by a, a constant, add c to get ax+c, multiply by b, bax+bc, add y n times, bax+bc+ny. Now, to get back to 10000x+y, we need to reverse our steps and namely eliminate bc and n. Since we are allowed a little freedom in picking our constants, for bc, we only want to add 1 after we multiply by 80 (or a in this instance). So now we're back to bax+b+ny. Subtract off b, and we're left with bax+ny. Now, to make this equivalent to the phone number, we want to let ba=10000*n. If n=1, you can stop here and use factors 16 and 625 here, but the constants a=80 and b=250 give ba=20000, so divide by 2 also (so n=2). In general, if you pick constants a and b arbitrarily, you need to divide throughout by n=ab/10000.\n\nDysprosia 01:34, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThey make the answer non-obvious. If I said take your phone number, add 1, and then subtract 1, it would be pretty obvious what the answer is. Extra (and more complicated) steps are necessary to make the answer nontriival. Why those numbers in particular? It's arbitrary. →Raul654 01:24, Apr 2, 2004 (UTC)\n\nThat's pretty much exactly it. I'm passing through almost 2 weeks later, but here's an explanation I gave a friend (without the algebra--you guys must be math majors! ;-) ):\n\nLet's say your phone # is 123-4567. That's 1230000 + 4567. When you multiply the 1st 3 digits by 250 and then by 80, that's multiplying by 20000 (250x80). Which is the same as multiplying your first 3 digits by 10000 (1230000) and then again by 2 (so now it's doubled).\n\nBut you added 1 before multiplying by 250, so it's that doubled number plus 250 extra.\n\nNow you add your last 4 digits twice (in other words, doubling that part), so now you've got 2 times the whole phone number--plus that 250 extra.\n\nSo subtract that extra 250 and divide by 2.\n\nThey just moved around and disguised simple arithmetic (Add 4 zeros to the first 3 digits. Double it. Add 250. Double the last 4 digits and add to the total. Subtract 250. Undouble the result. -- Or, even more simply--double your phone number. Add 250. Subtract 250. Take half of your doubled phone number. Wow--you have your original phone number!) to make it look complicated.\n\nElf | Talk 22:35, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nmlarcher@uclan.ac.uk Land 08703215390 0701 0713 765 To whom it may consern I'm Mike a degree student and at last I have found what seems to be a useful site that collates and disseminates information. sorry about my spelling I? am dyslexic and don?t really worry about such things. To me the important thing is the content not the presentation. I am writing an assignment on the Morphology of vernacular earth build in the world with a particular interest in the UK. I already have lots of information on the world but appear to be struggling in the UK. there are lots of examples of earth construction but I want to see if I can prove a link between them showing an evolutionary nature to our knowledge and their construction over the millennia. So far I can see substantial variation in the types of early build with the great wall of China and Hannibal?s watch tower mentioned by the Roman historian Plyny from David Eastern book. But where is the change from one level of knowledge to another. Nina Jennings referring to Clay Dobbins of the Solway plains refers to the Long house derivatives their making a connection to the Norse tradition of building that was found in the Artic circle and changes in the locations of the fire wall but what about all the other changes to addobi or clay lump, when and where? I am desperately looking and quickly running out of time Please send me any information on changes to earth construction however insignificant it may seem. it may just provide the missing links I am looking for. In return I am willing to post my finished paper SPELT Correctly!! Thanks in anticipation Mike A\n\nThank you Mike but this page is for questions.

Mark Richards 20:09, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nSomeone needs to run a bot to fix all those links to Great Britain that are actually intended for United Kingdom or Kingdom of Great Britain. British is a disambiguation page and many links to Britain are relevant to the country, not the meaning of the word. Any bot operators around? --Jiang 07:30, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhoa there. A thought - every history book I've ever seen refers to the \"British\" during world war II, even thought it was the whole of the UK that was actually fighting. Don't ask me why, either, it's juts an observation. my point is that I think it's important to be in agreement with all the other texts on the subject. So whoever runs that bot had better know what he is talking about - I don't want him making changes if he isn't certain (or virtually so) why he is changing something. →Raul654 07:34, Apr 2, 2004 (UTC)\n\nYes, there will be a number of options:\n\nUnited Kingdom - This, UK, UK of GB & I are the same (abreviated forms)\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\n\nKingdom of Great Britain Precursory state\n\nRoman Britain Precursor\n\nBritish Empire Different political unit (historical)\n\nBritish Isles Geographical term\n\nGreat Britain Subset politically of UK\n\nno change\n\n...\n\n--Jiang 08:42, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI annotated the list with comments - hope you don't mind!Mark Richards 18:41, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI think the best thing would be to go with one of the CIA World factbook conventional forms -\n\nconventional long form: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nconventional short form: United Kingdom\n\nabbreviation: UK\n\nUnless we are talking about one of the historical precusors or different geographical or political entities mentioned above like the Roman Empire or the British Isles. Using Britain to mean the UK is common, but incorrect. This is subtly different to the use of the word 'British', which, confusingly, can mean either 'related to Britain', or 'related to the UK'. Mark Richards 18:35, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nYeah, it's because it's very awkward to say \"United Kingdomer\", \"United Kingdomish\", whatever... so generally, it's either \"British\", \"Northern Irish\", or the specific area of Great Britain (English, Welsh, Scottish, Irish). ugen64 22:43, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)\n\nWhat we substitute each with depends on context, of course. If it's in a historical context, the refer to the precuror (e.g. \"The American colonies declared independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]\"). But someone reading that sentence would not be interested in how the word \"Britain\" evolved, so linking to [Britain] would do no good. We have different articles for UK GB&NI (at UK) and UK GB%I. For the UK before 1927, we would link to the latter. --Jiang 00:14, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI agree - but I think that the poster was suggesting that where we link to Great Britain, but actually mean the UK, we should fix it. I think you agree with that too - I share your concerns about using a bot to do this! Yours, Mark Richards 20:43, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nFlanders and Swann said (about a related issue):\n\nYou've got to be very careful how you use those words, just by the way. The rule is, if we've done something good, it's 'another triumph for Great Britain', but if we've done something bad, it's 'England loses again'.\n\nIf the English/British/UKers can't decide, what chance (or need) have we? Andrewa 10:22, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe need to be careful about these distinctions is fairly recent. As late as the 1950s people wrote \"England\" to mean \"England\", \"United Kingdom\" or \"British Empire\", expecting the reader to work out which one was meant from the context, or simply not to care. Gdr 12:19, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)\n\nI think that you are saying the same thing - we need to be carefull that we use the right term - I think that in the 1950s it was mostly the English who used 'England' to mean the UK or the British Empire - the trend towards more careful usage suggests a greater awareness of the political implications of treating them as equvalents! Mark Richards 13:24, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nWell put. Just BTW, despite my English name my ancestors came mainly from Scotland (I come from a long line of men with an English name with the good taste and fortune to marry girls from the North), and I proudly wear the kilt on formal occasions.

Much thanks in advance. --Johnleemk 13:39, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nAccording to the Columbia University Health Education Program:\n\nThe change to grey or white is caused by the gradual decrease of pigmentation that occurs with age. Contrary to what you may have heard, special diets, nutritional supplements, certain vitamins, and protein will not affect the graying process. Graying, whether it comes with the normal process of aging or prematurely, has a genetic basis. Hair turns gray or white when a pigment (melanin) ceases to be produced in the hair root, and new hairs grow in gray or white. If you're a smoker, take note: a 1996 British Medical Journal study conducted by J.G. Mosley, MD found that smoking may cause premature graying. When compared to nonsmokers in the study, smokers were at a four times higher risk of graying prematurely.\n\nAlthough graying usually starts in the thirty-something age range, there's nothing to worry about in graying prematurely -- some say it's rather sophisticated and sexy!\n\nHave to agree, by the way -- my brother-in-law (like his father) had silver at the temples at sixteen, and it looked really good on him. He's completely white now at 26, and it's very striking!\n\nI'm adding this info to Hair color...we seem to be lacking in that section -- thanks for asking!

WhiteDragon 19:46, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI was wondering at what point did the names in the bible receive their meanings? For example, Isaiah, which means the salvation of the Lord. Did that name always mean that or did it get its meaning after Isaiah became know for being a prophet and trying get Isreal to turn back to God? And this question is posed for other names as well that have a meaning that refers to God in someway in the bible.\n\nWikipedia entries for the names you're wondering about will often provide etymologies. For instance on Isaiah you can see that the name came from the Hebrew ישׁעיהו or \"Yeshayahu\". In that you can see יהו, from יהוה, YHWH, Yahweh, the name of God in the Tanakh, which suggests that Isaiah always meant \"(something) of Yahweh\", at least. Someone fluent in Hebrew, which I am not, could probably go so far as to say that it has always meant \"salvation of Yahweh\", which is what the etymology provided there says. The root words which make up a name are not likely to change meaning because of one individual, and Hebrew names tend to be made up of Hebrew words.\n\nOf course you may have to trust the etymology provided in some cases, or cross-check it with other resources; one freely-available resource to chech against is Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897), which while dated is still of some use. For example, you can see here that \"Isaiah\" has an etymology that agrees with the one in the Isaiah article here.\n\n(This means that you would have to do the same sort of research for whatever other names you were curious about, but that's probably the best-case scenario anyway.)\n\nIncidentally, note there that \"Isaiah\" does not refer to \"the Lord\" in those words, but to the specific name Yahweh; you've probably encountered an etymology based on a Bible version which systematically replaced direct mentions of His name with \"the Lord\" as is typical. — mendel ☎ 01:29, Apr 5, 2004 (UTC)\n\nPerhaps you have things the wrong way around here. In many traditions, including for example contemporary Hebrew and the native American cultures, there are no names that are purely names, but rather every name means something. That is to say, the name already has a meaning before it is given to the person, and a meaningless name just wouldn't be considered a correct thing to do. This is contrary to our Western culture, where parents will happily invent a name just for its sound. But, we understand for example that Sitting Bull is a different sort of name from a different culture. The culture of Old Testament Israel seems to be somewhere in the middle, it has elements of both these extremes from time to time. The Book of Genesis in particular seems full of devices we can perhaps best understand as puns, to try to find a parallel in our society, but that's not exactly right. Does this help?

Perhaps someone has even tried the experiment. It might be easier to assume that the Earth has uniform density. Even better would be a general formula that worked for height above the ground as well as depth below it. -- Heron 20:00, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nAbove ground is easy: for an object mass m at height h, it's just:\n\nW = G m m E ( R E + h ) 2 {\\displaystyle W={\\frac {Gmm_{E}}{(R_{E}+h)^{2}}}}\n\nwhere mE and RE are the mass and the radius of the Earth. (See Gravitation for more).\n\nFor below ground, it depends on your assumptions. If you assume that the Earth's density is completely uniform, it's:\n\nW = G m m E ( R E − h R E ) 3 ( R E − h ) 2 {\\displaystyle W={\\frac {Gmm_{E}\\left({\\frac {R_{E}-h}{R_{E}}}\\right)^{3}}{(R_{E}-h)^{2}}}}\n\nwhere h is distance below the ground. This works because you can treat the gravitation of the Earth as a point mass at the centre of the Earth, with a mass equal to the fraction of the Earth's mass which is below the object's depth.\n\nFor non-uniform density, you need to know the density distribution as a function of the Earth's radius. -- DrBob 20:21, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThanks, DrBob.

It looks as though \"Deutschland\" came from an old German word, 'diutisc', which referred to a common vernacular tongue (and thence to those who spoke it). \"Germany\" apparently is from a Roman term for the Germani tribe, which was later applied to a region (Germany) where they once lived. The discussion at the above link explains it all better than I can. -- Wapcaplet 03:59, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nBTW, in Romania they use \"german\" to refer to a person from Germany, but \"neamt\" to refer to a person of German ethnicity. -- Jmabel 04:13, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nTyskland and Deutschland are actually the same word, showing sound changes within the Germanic languages (because the Scandinavian languages are, after all, Germanic). In Romance languages they took their word from the Germanic Alemanni...you might ask, why that tribe and not some other one, but I don't know :) The English word I guess comes from Latin Germania, but as far as I am aware no one knows where the Latin word comes from (maybe from Celtic languages). And in Slavic they use some form of \"Nemets\" which is equivalent to \"barbarian\" I think.

Flag of Yemen indicates that the colors are traditional colors that refer to abstract concepts. LuckyWizard 23:40, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI've often noted that flags seem to go in \"batches\" in terms of colour - presumably sometimes due to common origin, sometimes due to influencing each other, and possibly sometimes just a subtle similarity in culture. For instance, a large number of European countries use (only) red, white and blue, whereas African nations tend to make heavy use of black, green, yellow and red; a lot of island nations, meanwhile, seem to use light blue/turquoise and yellow a lot, since they are the predominant colours of their environment. - IMSoP 01:39, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nRight, you're talking about the Pan-African colours in the latter case and a combination of the Pan-Slavic colors and the Tricolore in the former. What I'm asking is do the Arab flag colors have a similar standard name or origin? --Alex S 01:59, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nIt's easy to see what IMSop means. The best explanation I can come up with is that they all felt compelled to include green in their flags, green being the color of Islam (see Green#Green_as_a_symbol), and the other colors just tagged along.

I'm not a medic but I have an old big yellow medicine book (with a medieval picture in the cover) called Principles of Surgery (Schwartz, Shires, Spencer, Stores, 1976, 3rd edition) (I'm not an expert, but, I think, this is a classical textbook, along with Guyton).\n\nThe problem is:\n\nfor example:\n\n\"Glycogen is stored in muscle and liver in combination with water and electrolytes, so that 1 Gm of glycogen yields only 1 or 2 kcal instead of the 4 kcal found in 1 Gm of dry carbohydrate.\" (page 19, chapter 1)\n\nthe above is a random page I had picked up, but the \"Gm\" spreads through all the book. So, what Gm stands for? grams? I've found nothing either in gram (unit) or talk:gram (unit), and besides:\n\n\"Initial therapy therefore always should be intravenous and should consist of 100 to 200 mg of cortisol as the 21-hemisuccinate or phosphate.\" (page 14, chapter 1)\n\nSo, if Gm stands for gram, why the author putted mg for milligrams? Is Gm a medical jargon? --200.154.209.96 01:16, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThis is almost completely a guess, and almost bound to be wrong, but might it have anything to do with moles? Obviously, \"m\" ought to stand for metre, and moles should be \"mol\", but with a \"G\" for giga, I thought this just might be worth consideration. (by the way, if that's \"Engrish\", I'm impressed - it was better than many native English-speakers!) - IMSoP 01:34, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI think in this case the author is using \"Gm\" as an (incorrect) abbreviation for \"gram\". I think this because 1 gram of carbohydrates = 4kcal is correct.\n\nBy the way, your \"Engrish\" seems like perfect English to me. -- DrBob 01:41, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nDrBob is right that in the context Gm refers to grams and is a mid century american abbreviation which became obsolete with international standardization of abbreviations in medical journals starting in the late 1970s. The sentences you quote appear to refer to fasting fuel metabolism and treatment of adrenal crisis; there are more current sources of info on these topics than an old surgical text though Schwartz' description of both topics is still basically usable. In those days Schwartz and Guyton often hung out with Grant, Bloom & Fawcett, Robbins, Harrison, Nelson, Williams, and White, Handler & Smith. alteripse 9 apr 04\n\nWell, thanks for the help folks!

What we would like to do is build an academy and create links with many simulations so that we can train and award qualifications that can be accepted by these simmulations. We are planning many training programs, including ones aimed at more experienced simmers. We have already been in contact with websites and organisations who have offered to provide resources and guidance, so that we can plan this academy and one day make it a reality.\n\nBelow I have provided a list of some of the jobs that need filling, but in general, as this is still in such an early stage we are open to any help we can get and are willing to accept ideas and suggestions.\n\nSIMULATION LIAISON We are looking for people to form and maintain links with Simulation groups across the web. You may already be a part of a simulation that wants to join the academy program, although we have not yet started advertising to simulations, and will not until there is more information available on the web.\n\nPUBLIC RELATIONS We are looking for people to oversee all operations involving all those not in the academy. This job will involve dealing with and helping outsiders and watching over other groups like simulation liaison and advertising.\n\nINSTRUCTORS We are looking for people with a fair amount of simming experience to help us plan and set up the academy before carry out the training when the academy is opened.\n\nCONSULTANTS We are looking for people with detailed knowledge of any aspect of Star Trek to help us set up and create the training programs and provide an interactive resource. This job will be one were yo can put in as much or little time as you like.\n\nADVERTISING/RECRUITING We are looking for people to spread information about the academy and recruit students and staff once the academy is open.\n\nIn general we are looking for people who would be interested in helping to build the academy and run it. We would be perfectly happy to accept someone with another idea for a role or someone who would like to combine two roles. If you are at all interested or would just like to ask a question do not hesitate to contact me at:\n\ncommandant@universalacademy.co.uk\n\nI look forward to hearing from you,\n\nWilliam Lea\n\nUniversal Academy\n\nThis page is for questions. - Woodrow 15:55, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nYou might like to try the members of the Star Trek wiki at Memory Alpha, as there will be far more people there who'll be interested in your game academy. If, however, you have also developed an academy for play-by-internet games which involve endless bickering about the spelling of the names of small towns in western Poland, I'm sure we'd love to know all about it. -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 23:58, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'm doing a project on JFK for school and I would be very interested to find out how President Kennedy's children had a treehouse on the lawn in front of the White House.

It certainly doesn't find the shortest path, but it should find a path if there is one.

Angela\n\nAccording to our List of Latin phrases page: \"Through hardship to the stars\" -- motto of the Royal Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force.\n\nI'm a bit suspicious of the Latin phrases list, as it gives the same translation for per aspera ad astra and per ardua ad astra which seems unlikely. The RAF motto is per ardua ad astra which is through struggle/adversity/hardship to the stars (RAF history website - origin of the motto). I would translate aspera as hope, but then it's 30 years since I last studied Latin, so what do I know? :) -- Arwel 19:47, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe Latin phrases list should be fine in this instance -- Arwel's memory (no offense Arwel!) is incorrect in this. Merriam-Webster note that [15] aspera means \"harsh things\" in English. I humbly suggest that Arwel was connecting \"aspiration\" to a conjectured Latin cognate \"aspira\". :-) Anyway, \"Through harsh things to the stars\" should be accurate. I've never heard of \"per ardua ad astra\", and M-W doesn't have \"ardua\" (though their list of Latin words is far from exhaustive). Interesting. Jwrosenzweig 19:54, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nYou're correct - it's a \"false friend\", I was thinking of aspiration. Oh well, we live and learn, which is why it's useful to ask questions!

Basically, a site is considered more important if many other important sites links to it. I would love to see this algorithm implemented on wikipedia! Is it already done? I've looked for it, but haven't find anything.\n\nThe Google algorithm provides the most convenient means yet for assessing interest in multiple articles containing common terms. You can apply the Google algorithm to Wikipedia by entering the term Wikipedia along with any search term, or by using the search box at the top of this page.\n\nThe algorithm does not, however, provide a qualitative ranking of articles in Wikipedia the way it tends to do in Google. The reason is that Google searches many articles on a similar topic and sorts out the most recognized articles. Qualification of Wikipedia articles would require validation of individual ariticles against similar articles from recognized sources. An earlier effort to develop a better-validated encyclopedia, called Nupedia, was abandoned when it did not progress as quickly as developers liked, probably because it did not encourage contributors to add what they know, regardless whether contributions could be validated against recognized sources. Wikipedia currently relies largely on an ad hominem method of validation, in which familiar contributors assess new contributions based on whatever they know about a topic and their opinion of whether a contributor is reliable.\n\nRanking requires a method of evaluation by which to assign rank. Google uses density of linkages to assign rank. Wikipedia offers a system of popular selection that sometimes bumps articles to featured status, but is otherwise organized according to common scientific or liberal arts taxonomies. There is currenlty no reliable means for ranking Wikipedia articles for their validity.

All of the fields in an email's header (its addressing and routing information) can easily be forged, and there are (still) innumerable open email relays that allow anyone to send email through them. As part of a serious criminal investigation, a law enforcement organisation (like the FBI) can generally track the sender of an email, providing the sender hasn't taken some (fairly simple) steps to conceal their identity further. -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 09:27, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)~\n\nThe mail you got could either be spam (very unlikely) or it could be a virus playing around. As McWalter above says, the header could be forged, so you could get nowhere with an investigation, but there are interesting ways you can start investigating - starting from getting the IP addresses and doing a whois. Also refer Stopping e-mail abuse, probably the \"External links\" section would be more helpful. Jay 10:51, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nIf it's a matter of whether or not the message comes from your friend's machine, it's not quite so hopeless. There will be a series of headers called \"Received:\" telling, in reverse order, which machines it passed through --that is, if your e-mail program doesn't strip them out of the message. The last one tells what machine the message came from -- or rather, what machine first handled it and obeyed the rules for e-mail handling. If these headers are different from the ones in your friend's messages, then it came from a different machine, and the \"From\" information is a lie. It's little more complicated than that, but this is a rough guide. But if it did come from his machine, it could still have been sent by a virus that he knows nothing about. But you can be sure of this: messages do go out with fake sender addresses. Spammers send such stuff all the time.

Chopchopwhitey 06:35, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nIndeed.

Cultural myth or is their scientific grounding in this? --Jiang 06:12, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\n\"Han\" is not an ethnic group since Chinese in different regions are genetically different from each other. Look at a person from Guangzhou or even Hunan, then look at a person from Harbin or Beijing. Big difference. This is because Chinese originally lived around Shaanxi, then spread out and conquered other areas. Only a few thousand troops conquered the southern Yue, so they left hardly any genetic impact upon the population, which is why Chinese people have different physical features depending on the region you go to. In the north, curly or wavy hair is not uncommon, nor is light brown/blond/red hair, compared to the straight dark hair of southerners. In the north, blue or green eyes are not necessarily uncommon, while in the south you will not find anything other than brown. Northerners are bigger and taller, while southerners are shorter and skinnier. Single or double eyelid varies by region, as do the shape of people's noses, skin color, facial or body hair, etc. This all stems from the various populations that were absorbed into the Chinese population long ago, and vice-versa. The Chinese language and culture have survived and spread, that can not be disputed, however you will never find the word \"Han\" used to describe a so-called \"ethnic group\" before a hundred years ago or so-it was never used throughout history. Therefore to answer the question, I would say cultural myth. --Xiaogoudelaohu (talk)\n\nI am interested in writing to a member of the Department of Archeology in order to obtain some information about an artifact which was obtained from someone who claimed to be the head of a University of Chicago Babilonian Expedition back in l936.

My e-mail is vbrian48@hotmail.com. Thanks a lot, bye.\n\nBrian\n\nHere's a link to an image of a polydactylus hand: [19] and another [20] The extra digits of polydactylus appendages often lack effective muscular connections. Polydactyly is usually inherited as a dominant trait but is also sometimes induced by teratogens.\n\nFormation of human hands and feet begins at about the 6th week of gestation, when cell death divides the apical ectodermal ridge into, normally, five segments. Normal patterns in digits are formed, or not formed, as a result of activity in a zone of polarizing activity at the base of arms and legs on their posterior edge. The morphogenesis probably involves retinoic acid (vitamin A) and a series of genes called homeobox genes.\n\nOther embryonic malformations of hands and feet include ectrodactylyl, which is the absence of a digit, usually unilateral (one only one side) and syndactyly, which is abnormal fusion between fingers or toes.\n\nSyndactylus appendages form in about 1 of 2,000 human births, when the normal breakdown of mesenchyme fails to occur. Clubfoot often presents along with syndactylus, but clubfoot might be inherited or a result of abnormal placement of the legs in the uterus during gestation. In clubfoot, the sole of the foot is turned inward.\n\nNone of these are the same as cleft hands or feet, called lobster claw deformity, consisting of an abnormal cleft between the 2nd and 4th metacarple bones and soft tissue, usually along with missing 3rd metacarpal and phalangeal bones, and often with fusing of the thumb and index finger and of the 4th and 5th fingers. You might learn more about this by reviewing articles on human embryology I'm not sure your teacher will be very impressed if you say a bird told you this. If you enter some of these words in the www.google.com search engine, you might find additional sources for this information. You should at least check my spelling, and do something to be sure the information I freely provided comports with some other reliable source. Byrd\n\nInternal link: Polydactyly Bensaccount 04:15, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nAfter reading a bit more, I learned that polydactyly is present in as many as 100 other disorders, often as a minor trait compared to the gravity of the disorder, and that in rare cases it cannot be attributed to any known cause. RaymondByrd 04:35, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nDoes anybody here know if static electricity discharges from breaking ice? I'm not sure if it occurs when ice separates from plastic or when ice separates from itself. I observed the phenomena while breaking icecubes from a plastic tray in a darkened kitchen. I would expect static discharges from plastic, though I never really contemplated why they occur, much less if they occur in ice alone or in ice separating from plastic. Just curious...\n\nI remember hearing or reading that breaking icicles causes sparks. I've just spent 10 minutes searching, though, and can't find anything online at the moment. I read something about breaking things causing sparks recently (maybe lifesavers), and the only thing I can find on the net says that from personal experience that's false. I might have read it in Discover magazine--I'll see whether I can find it in an old issue, unless someone else can come up with something. Elf | Talk 17:10, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe thing with Lifesavers is called triboluminescence and it does work (I've done it myself). There may be a similar effect with ice; a google search for triboluminescence+ice gives some links, such as [this scientific paper]. -- DrBob 17:46, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nCan any one tell me, why we call this country as Germany, while it is called Deutschland by Germans themselves? What is the etymological meaning of Germany? Thank you\n\nThe word Germany derives from the latin Germanic labeling the barbaric tribes of Northern Europe, see Germanic peoples. The French word for Germany, Allemagne, derives from one specific germanic tribe of southern Germany, the Alamanni. The origin of the word Deutsch is a bit more complicated. The name derives from the germanic word theoda meaning folk, from which around the 8th century the latin word theodiscus labeling the german language developed. And I wonder why the above isn't included in the articles on Germany or German language yet. andy 10:10, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nMaybe it's the same user who asked the same question before. See the 'Name of \"Deutschland\" ' section above. Jay 10:52, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI think it was named after Germanicus Caesar, the general at the battle of Teutoberg Forest. It comes from the Latin name for the area past the Rhine, that's for sure, but I could swear the Romans assigned that name to it and that it had been the name of a person. Diderot 13:42, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nIt's the other way around - people were called Germanicus as a nickname for having served well in Germania. Adam Bishop\n\nYou can check out Germany at List of country name etymologies, it's pretty complete. Btw, it wasn't me who asked this time.

Gandalf61 15:25, Apr 15, 2004 (UTC)\n\nPage 594 of my copy of Analytical Chemistry, by Skoog and West (ISBN 0-03-097285-X) gives the procedure for determining the percentage of copper in an alloy. I'd post it, but that would be a violation of copyright, and Dr. West was too nice of a professor for me to do that to him. Gentgeen 06:21, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI doubt the procedure itself would be copyright, the specific formatted presentation of it might be - you could redescribe the procedure in entirely your own words - IANAL but I think that should be fine.

THANK U!!!\n\nThe article in question is List of Disney animated features. →Raul654 00:49, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)\n\nSomeone once told me that after around 20 days without sleep a person will... die. I was a little dubious of this, however the sleep deprivation article states that:\n\nLack of sleep may result in irritability, blurred vision, slurred speech, memory lapses, overall confusion, nausea and eventually death....\n\n...but doesn't give a figure. Does anyone know what the (average) limit is?\n\n(And yes, I didn't sleep too well last night.) Chopchopwhitey 15:09, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nIf my shoddy memory serves me, the world record for human sleep deprivation was done by a california boy who did it under psychological supervision (from either Stanford or Berkeley - I can't remember which). He made it to ten days with no sleep, but at that point, it becomes a question of what exactly sleep is. Does microsleep count? Again, IIRC, in experiments with rats, the rats died after 3 weeks with no sleep. I don't think a human has ever made it that far. →Raul654 15:24, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)\n\nAm I the only one just a bit troubled by the fact that the world's leading sleep researcher is named Dr.Dement? -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 00:25, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI wondered the exact same thing recently; I learned in my high school psychology class that it's impossible to die from sleep dep, that you'd fall asleep before dying. I did some googling, and from what I can tell by making inferences based on vague speculation, the only way to die from sleep dep is to be incapable of sleep. Check out this small table giving life expectancy with total sleep deprivation (no references given); a newsgroup posting with (again unreferenced) replies claiming death won't occur... I'd also love to see a definitive answer on this. I'm not convinced by any lab studies in which animal (or human) sleep mechanisms were intentionally destroyed. Obviously, if one is physically incapable of sleep, death will occur before sleep. -- Wapcaplet 01:07, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI'd be very interested to know what the supposed physiological cause of death is in these cases. I believe I'm correct in saying that the Autonomic nervous system and brainstem don't really partake of \"sleep\", so surely can't itself be harmed by the lack thereof. And I think I'm (roughly) correct in saying that a patient with these intact can at least keep breathing, digesting, and heart beating. -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 01:18, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nSleep is not well understood, so I think no definite explanation is known. But experiments have been done with rats: A pair of rats is placed on a circular platform in a pool of water, separated by a barrier. One is hooked up to an EEG (the other probably has a hookup which is ignored). Whenever this one rat starts to fall asleep, the barrier begins to move, forcing the rat awake. This way the rat can rest but not sleep, and the other rat can sleep sometimes. After a while (3 weeks?) the rat that couldn't sleep was unable to maintain its body temperature and died. Even if the rat was allowed to sleep after the body temperature began to wander, death still occurred. For this reason, volunteers are generally not permitted to become this sleep-deprived in studies. As for \"you'd fall asleep first\", this is probably true in a quiet room with nothing but food and water, but with suitable stimulants or a person to keep waking you, you could stay awake a very long time. I wish I still had the book I read all this in, but it (and its title and author) have now vanished into the mists of time. Perhaps the problem was that I was sleep-deprived to the point of hallucination and bad memory when I read it... --Andrew 15:22, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)\n\nThe info about sleep deprivation killing people comes mainly from studies in rats where sleep deprived rats eventually die, despite being otherwise healthy. However, these studies are heavily confounded, since keeping an animal sleep deprived is difficult and stressful (for the animal). Usually it involves something like electric shocks or tipping it into a bucket of cold water every time it starts to fall asleep. This means that anyone who is sleep deprived is also very stressed, and it's hard to tell whether the stress, or the lack of sleep, kills them. The experiment Andrew describes is a better version of this, but it is still vulnerable to the criticism that the experience of the rat that kept on being woken whenever it started to fall asleep might be more stressful than the experience of the other rat. Mark Richards 19:17, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nThanks, Andrew and Mark. The mention of thermal homeostasis (and that water business) might implicate the hypothalamus, and I know there's a diurnal variation of core body temperature (a variation greater during sleep, I think). So one can see at least a shadow of a physiological explanation. Yeah, the water and stress is confounding, and it's tough to think of an experiment that wouldn't at least have the stress. -- Finlay McWalter | Talk 19:57, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\nI don't know anything scientific, but I've heard of users of crystal methamphetamine staying awake for 30 days and more.
