        "meta_description": "Jan Troell (b. 1931) is a Swedish filmmaker. Usually, Troell writes his own scripts and serves as his own director of photography, but he is most famous outside Scandinavia for 'The Emigrants' and 'The New Land' based on Vilhelm Moberg's classic saga. Troell's realistic films, with a lyrical photography in which nature is prominent, have placed him in the first rank of modern Swedish film directors.",
