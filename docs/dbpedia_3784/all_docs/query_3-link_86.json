        "text": "★★★★★\n\nEverlasting Moments is a 2008 Swedish drama from acclaimed director Jan Troell. Although it is not an extremely well known movie, it is one that really touched me emotionally, and I felt compelled to share my thoughts on it today.\n\nIn the early 1900’s, in Sweden, Maria Larsson (Maria Heiskanen) wins a camera in a lottery. She and her husband, Sigfrid (Mikael Persbrandt), have no experience with photography, so they set it in a drawer and forget that it even exists.\n\nThe Larsson family lives in a lower class working neighborhood in Sweden. Sigfrid takes whatever jobs are available, while Maria spends her days doing odd jobs like house cleaning and laundry around the neighborhood. She also has her hands full raising their seven children.\n\nThe two things Maria didn’t know about Sigfrid when they were married were his love for other women and his love of drinking. The more he drinks, the more he looks for more women to enjoy. When he drinks he also becomes physically abusive toward Maria.\n\nAs times grow more difficult around World War I, Maria tries to sell her camera. She takes it to a photography store that is run by Sebastian Pedersen (Jesper Christensen). Instead of buying the camera from her, he teaches her how to use it properly, as well as develop her own photographs. What she produces are some amazing photographs that capture fascinating images of things and people that may seem ordinary. Oddly, Maria doesn’t have an understanding of her natural talent. She continues to improve as a photographer and is even able to bring in some money when Sigfrid is in jail.\n\nMaria continues to gain confidence in her abilities, and she also begins to develop an intimate relationship with Sebastian. It is not a closeness based on physical needs, but rather an emotional one. Of course the problem is that it does begin to interfere with her marriage.\n\nThe movie then goes on to show the difficulties that this couple endures, and how they must work in order to keep their marriage and family from crumbling beneath them.\n\nPrior to watching Everlasting Moments, I hadn’t heard anything about the film or about director Jan Troell. Based on this one experience, I must admit that I am highly impressed. Everlasting Moments was a breathtaking film that captured the spirit and essence of a specific time and place in history. Jan Troell has used the camera to capture shot after captivating shot as if he was putting together an immense photographic album to share with the world. I don ‘t feel as if I watched a movie about a persons life, but rather experienced Maria’s life through her eyes. Maria was able to open up her thoughts through Troell and his unique perspective on filmmaking, in order to share her story with the world.\n\nEverlasting Moments is based on the book by Troell’s wife, Agneta Ulfsater-Troell. Maria Larsson is actually Agneta’s great aunt. As Agneta was writing the book, Jan said he wanted to make it into a movie. He felt that he identified with Maria in the story. Troell loves the art of photography and the idea of capturing solitary moments that can live on forever. On many of his movies, Troell is his own cinematographer because he loves the ability to improvise a shot during filming. Troell doesn’t always feel that he is even a director, and often feels he is in the wrong place while filming. He blames it on his lack of formal training as a director.\n\nHis feelings of not belonging in the director chair could have something to do with the path his career has taken. Jan Troell first gained success with his 1972 movie, The Emigrants. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including two nominations for Troell for Best Screenplay and Best Director, as well as a nomination for Best Picture. Troell was then lured to Hollywood, and over the next few years struggled to make a movie that he loved. His way of filming was much different from the American way, and the restrictions set upon him were frustrating and exhausting. Instead of being his own cinematographer, he was forced to rely on others. He ended up butting heads with many people, mostly cinematographers, and within a short time was ready to return to Sweden and his way of making movies. Troell has continued to work sporadically, and has continued to make critically acclaimed movies.\n\nWhile filming Everlasting Moments in 2008, Troell was filled with a sadness thinking that it could prove to be his final movie. Luckily, he soon decided on another project and The Last Sentence is due to be released in December 2012.\n\nAs a worldwide fan of movies I was surprised, and a little disappointed, that I hadn’t seen any of Jan Troell’s movies. I have tried several times to find a copy of The Emigrants, but to no avail. The only reason I was able to watch Everlasting Moments, is because Criterion released it in their collection. After I finished Everlasting Moments and was so thrilled by what I had seen, I went to see what other Troell movies I could find. I was extremely disappointed to find that all but one was unavailable at this time. After reading about Jan Troell online, I have learned that he is considered one of the three greatest directors to ever come from Sweden. Although I have only seen this one movie, I don’t doubt this to be true. I am however questioning why his movies aren’t more widely produced. I will continue to try to find his movies, and if his other work is anywhere as remarkable as Everlasting Moments I am certain that my search will not be in vain."
