        "meta_description": "Original 9 3/8 inch by 7 1/8 inch Still of Swedish director JOAN TROELL Troell was born in 1931 in Limhamm, Skane, Sweden. A dentist’s son, he worked as a schoolteacher for nine years before embarking on a film career in the early 1960s. He turned out a number of shorts and assisted Bo Widerberg as a cameraman and co-editor on several projects before directing his first feature ‘ Here's Your Life’ in 1966. Troell's major work in the 1970s became The Emigrants (1971) and its sequel The New Land (1972), two epic films about some peasants emigrating from the barren Swedish countryside to America in the 19th century. Despite his age (he is currently in his 80s), Troell has remained productive. His recent films include ‘As White as in Snow’ (2001), based on the life of Swedish aviator Elsa Andersson; a documentary called ‘Presence’ (2003); ‘Everlasting Moments’ (2008), based on the life of Maria Larsson, a 20th-century, working class photographer; and his latest film, ‘The Last Sentence’, a biographical film about the Swedish publicist Torgny Segerstedt. ‘The Last Sentence’ premiered in November 2012 at the Stockholm International Film Festival. At the same festival Troell was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award. The still is in very good condition. Reverse side blank.",
