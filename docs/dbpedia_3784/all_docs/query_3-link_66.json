        "text": "The World Film Festival in Montreal has awarded Jan Troell the award for Best Director at its closing ceremony yesterday. The award was given for Troel´s latest feature THE LAST SENTENCE. World premiering in Montreal this is the film´s first international screening.\n\nTHE LAST SENTENCE, which was previously know under the working title TRUTH & CONSEQUENCE, tells the story about one of the leading journalists in Sweden in the 20th century, Torgny Segerstedt, who fought against Hitler and the Nazi regime until his death in 1945. Jan Troell is back after his last feature EVERLASTING MOMENTS (2008), which made it to the Academy Award shortlist as the Swedish nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, and this time he comes with an epic bio-picture starring two of Scandinavia´s finest acting talents; Jesper Christensen and Pernilla August.\n\nProducer is Francy Suntinger for Filmlance with the support of Swedish Film Institute.\n\nNordisk Film is distributing domestically with a local release date set on 7 December this year."
