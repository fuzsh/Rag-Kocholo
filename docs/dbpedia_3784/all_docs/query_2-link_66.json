        "text": "Swedish cinema is known as producing many critically acclaimed movies, and during the 20th century was the most prominent of Scandinavia. This is largely due to the popularity and prominence of the directors Ingmar Bergman, Victor Sjöström, and more recently Lasse Hallström and Lukas Moodysson. Swedish filmmaking rose to international prominence when Svenska Biografteatern moved from Kristianstad to Lidingö in 1911. During the next decade the company's two star-directors, Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller, produced many outstanding silent films, some of the best of them adaptations of stories by the Nobel-prizewinning novelists. Stiller fostered the early popularity of Greta Garbo. In the mid-twenties both of these directors and Garbo moved to the United States to work for MGM, bringing Swedish influence to Hollywood. The departure left a vacuum in Swedish cinema, which subsequently went into a financial crisis. Both directors later returned to Sweden, but Stiller died soon after his return while Sjöström returned to theatre work for most of the remainder of his career. The advent of the talking movie at the beginning of the 1930s brought about a financial stabilization for Swedish cinema, but the industry sacrificed artistic and international ambitions for this financial success. During World War II Swedish cinema gained artistically, mainly due to the directors Gustaf Molander and Alf Sjöberg. Cinema had to perform the task of psychological defence during the war. The most famous and influential Swedish filmmaker, Ingmar Bergman, rose to prominence in the fifties. Working closely with Bergman, cinematographer Sven Nykvist can be said to have had a major impact on the visual aspect of Swedish cinema. Nykvist is considered by many to be one of the greatest cinematographers of all time. During the late 1990s early 2000s several young filmmakers started exploring genre-films which had earlier been almost non-existent. The Swedish Film Institute was founded in 1963 to support and develop the Swedish film industry. It supports Swedish filmmakings and allocates grants for production, distribution and public showing of Swedish films in Sweden. It also promotes Swedish cinema internationally. Furthermore, the Institute organises the annual Guldbagge Awards.\n\nBest International Feature Film Wins[]\n\n33rd Academy Awards, 1960\n\nThe Virgin Spring — Ingmar Bergman\n\n34th Academy Awards, 1961\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly — Ingmar Bergman\n\n56th Academy Awards, 1983\n\nFanny and Alexander — Ingmar Bergman\n\nBest International Feature Film Nominations[]\n\n33rd Academy Awards, 1960\n\nThe Virgin Spring — Ingmar Bergman\n\n34th Academy Awards, 1961\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly — Ingmar Bergman\n\n37th Academy Awards, 1964\n\nRaven's End — Bo Widerberg\n\n38th Academy Awards, 1965\n\nDear John — Lars-Magnus Lindgren\n\n42nd Academy Awards, 1969\n\nÅdalen 31 — Bo Widerberg\n\n44th Academy Awards, 1971\n\nThe Emigrants — Jan Troell\n\n45th Academy Awards, 1972\n\nThe New Land — Jan Troell\n\n55th Academy Awards, 1982\n\nFlight of the Eagles — Jan Troell\n\n56th Academy Awards, 1983\n\nFanny and Alexander — Ingmar Bergman\n\n64th Academy Awards, 1991\n\nThe Ox — Sven Nykvist\n\n68th Academy Awards, 1995\n\nAll Things Fair — Bo Widerberg\n\n72nd Academy Awards, 1999\n\nUnder the Sun — Colin Nutley\n\n76th Academy Awards, 2003\n\nEvil — Mikael Håfström\n\n77th Academy Awards, 2004\n\nAs It Is in Heaven — Kay Pollak\n\n89th Academy Awards, 2016\n\nA Man Called Ove — Hannes Holm"
