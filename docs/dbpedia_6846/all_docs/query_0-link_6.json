        "text": "Ella Gourkova\n\nSchool​ Director/Ballet Mistress\n\n​\n\nMs. Gourkova began her classical ballet training at age seven in her birthplace, Donetsk, Ukraine. At age eleven she auditioned for admittance into the Kirov Ballet’s famed Vaganova Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia and was accepted. Thus began her association with legendary teachers, dancers and choreographers of Russia’s renowned Bolshoi and St. Petersburg ballet companies. Upon her graduation from the Vaganova school, she joined the Donetsk Theatre of Opera and Ballet where she rose to the rank of principal dancer. She later performed on international tours with the ‘cream’ of Russia’s ballet artists including Vladimir Vasiliev, Ekaterina Maximova and Nina Ananiashvili, among many others. During a tour of the USA she and her husband, Sergey Popov, came to the attention of Vassili Sulich and Nancy Houssels, co-founders of Nevada Ballet Theatre (then, Nevada Dance Theatre) and were engaged as principal dancers, positions they held from 1995 to 2000. After her retirement from the stage, Ms. Gourkova was contracted to teach at the company’s academy where she continues to conduct ballet and character classes and to provide choreography for its annual concerts. In addition, she is a faculty Teacher for Dance Masters of America. She is happy to be sharing her experience and expertise with the students of Nevada School of Dance.\n\n​Sergey Popov\n\nPrincipal/Artistic Director\n\n​\n\nMr. Popov trained extensively at the State Choreographic School in Perm, Russia. He has performed throughout the world dancing leading roles from the classical ballet repertoire, including the princes in “Swan Lake,” “Sleeping Beauty” and “The Nutcracker.” His numerous awards include first prize as Best Partner at the Ukrainian Contest of Ballet. During his career, his partnering skills have been much sought after by many renowned ballerinas, including Russia’s Lyubov Kunakova and Inna Dorofeeva. He has been a guest artist with numerous companies and in many international gala performances with such luminaries as Irina Kolpakova, Galina Mezentseva, Vadim Pisarev, Julio Bocca and Farukh Ruzimatov, to name just a few. While principal dancer with Donetsk Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Ukraine he met and married ballerina Ella Gourkova. Before they retired from performing they were principal dancers together at Nevada Ballet Theatre for five years. Mr. Popov has taught dance at the College of Southern Nevada since 1999 and, as a faculty member of Dance Educators of America and Dance Masters of America, conducts classes throughout the USA. Mr. Popov brings vast knowledge and experience to Nevada School of Dance."
