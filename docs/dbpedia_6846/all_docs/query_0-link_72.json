The stage manager will confirm the cue timing with each participant during stage rehearsals.\n\nBackup Performance Music CD:\n\nWe recommend participants prepare one backup CD with the same music and labeling as the original. You do not need to submit the backup CD.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nParticipants in the Modern & Contemporary Category may choose between an Assigned Piece and a free variation.\n\nExceeding the specified time limit in any category will result in disqualification.\n\nFor pieces where copyright applies to the music or choreography, it is the participant's responsibility to obtain the necessary permissions for use beforehand.\n\nRequests to change submitted variations must be made no later than 10 days before the competition date. No changes will be accepted after the deadline, regardless of reason.\n\nContemporary dance is now incorporated into the repertoire of many ballet companies and is a mandatory subject in renowned ballet academies. Our competition has established a Modern & Contemporary Category to deepen understanding and promote skills that are applicable internationally. By giving Assigned Pieces choreographed by Ms. Mia Tomano, we hope to encourage those who have not had the opportunity to experience contemporary dance to take on this new challenge.\n\nOptional Ms. Mia Tomano Works:\n\nIf participants are new to contemporary dance, they should choose from either Assigned Piece A or B for their performance. If they have previous experience with the Assigned Pieces or other contemporary dance works by different choreographers, participants may also opt to enter with Mia Tomano's works \"Prelude\" or \"Untitled2(Figures)\".\n\nMessage from Choreographer Ms. Mia Tomano:\n\nI would be delighted if these pieces can be an opportunity for young dancers without much previous exposure to perform a contemporary piece. I hope this will be a valuable learning experience for them, not only in terms of technique but also in terms of expression and discovering new physicality.\n\nThe set pieces were created with beginners in mind, so both A and B are combinations of fairly basic and fundamental enchainements. They are more focused on the elements of enchainements than on being complete works. For those who will be taking part in domestic and international competitions after Grande Fete, I hope you choose to challenge yourselves with more complex pieces.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nFor participants choosing to perform an Assigned Piece, participants in Grades 1-5 should select Assigned Piece B. Participants in Grade 6 through the Senior Group may choose either Assigned Piece A or B.\n\nPrivate Coaching applications will close once they reach full capacity. Please apply for both Private Coaching and Workshops as early as possible.\n\nOur staff will be recording video of all performances for scholarship evaluation purposes. If participants wish for a copy of their recording, please ensure to request one on the day of the competition.\n\nFor scholarship selection purposes, there may be instances where video recordings of barre and center work are required. In such cases, the instructor in charge will contact you individually after the selection process on behalf of Grande Fete.\n\nParticipants who are only participating in the Modern & Contemporary and Universal Categories are also welcome to apply for scholarship evaluation.\n\nThese pieces are intended for dancers in grade 6 and above. As dancers at this age typically have established technique, the enchainement emphasizes physicality and the precision of movement. Enjoy the music and dance with full energy, fully committing to each movement.\n\nModern & Contemporary Category Assigned Piece A:\n\nFor Assigned Piece A, the female dancers depicted have performed the choreography faithfully, so please learn the choreography just as they dance it. The male dancers depicted have developed the expression and physicality of the piece in a more dynamic way, so please familiarize yourself with the choreography first before using the male dancers depicted for inspiration.\n\nFor costumes, please wear something that clearly shows the lines of your body, such as a leotard and tights (black or colored), so that your physicality is easily visible during the enchainements. You may choose to dance barefoot or in ballet shoes.\n\nModern & Contemporary Category Assigned Piece B:\n\nFor this piece, imagine finding something you love and dancing with it, expressing joy and lightheartedness in your movement. For your costume, please wear a leotard with a flowing skirt, such as a wrap skirt. There are no specific requirements for color or shape. You may choose to wear tights, leggings, or dance barefoot or in ballet shoes.\n\nAbout the Participant:\n\nAbout the Participant:\n\n1. Category\n\n2. Full Name (Kanji) / Full Name (Romanized)\n\n3. Date of Birth (Year/Month/Day) & Age\n\n4. Postal Code & Address\n\n5. Contact Information: Mobile Phone Number / Email Address\n\n6. Height\n\n7. What are your future career goals?\n\n8. Are you currently attending or planning to attend an overseas ballet school this year?\n\n9. Are you interested in summer or year-round programs?\n\n10.

Studio Name / Instructor's Name\n\n2. Email Address\n\nPlease Note:\n\n*We recommend that those who wish to be considered for scholarships or other selections participate in the workshops or private coaching sessions led by the judges responsible for the selection process.\n\n*Participants who are only competing in the Modern & Contemporary or Universal Categories are also welcome to apply for scholarship evaluation."
