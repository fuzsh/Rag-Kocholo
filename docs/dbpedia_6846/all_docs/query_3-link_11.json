        "text": "Vadim Pisarev and Inna Dorofeyeva had just arrived in New York City with the rest of the Donetsk Ballet, but they had already settled into the hectic pace of the city. A morning sitcom burbled on the television set. Mr. Pisarev sported an apple pin on his natty overcoat, and a scroll proclaiming ''I Love You New York'' hung on a wall of their hotel room. The telephone rang repeatedly, and as visitors trooped in they were politely offered tea, little gifts and a bit of the dancers' breakfast.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Pisarev, a young international ballet star, and Miss Dorofeyeva, an acclaimed soloist to whom he is married, began a series of six performances at City Center with other members of the Donetsk Ballet. The New York engagement had not been scheduled when the dancers left Donetsk, in the Ukraine. But little in the tour had happened as planned.\n\nThe day after their arrival in the United States on Feb. 2 for performances in Baltimore, the company's 59 members were told they might have to return home because the American tour producers had lost expected financing. They were without money for room or board, but help was volunteered by Baltimore authorities and in New York by the Howard Gilman Foundation, the management firm ICM Artists, the City Center Theater, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The company is now scheduled to continue its tour with performances at the National Theater in Washington from Tuesday to March 5 and at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia on March 6 and 7.\n\nAs it pressed on, the Donetsk Ballet gained critical praise for its production of ''Giselle'' and for its mixed bill of traditional and contemporary short ballets. The company will perform ''Giselle'' at City Center tonight, with the Grand Pas de Deux from ''Don Quixote.'' The other program will be presented tomorrow afternoon and evening and Sunday afternoon. It includes ''Gopak,'' ''Paquita,'' the Grand Pas de Deux from ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' the Pas d'Esclave from ''Le Corsaire'' and ''The Flames of Paris.''\n\nMr. Pisarev, 24 years old, is known to American balletomanes as a bravura dancer who has won numerous gold medals in international competitions, among them the U.S.A. International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986. He was one of the stars of the touring Moscow Ballet in 1987. Miss Dorofeyeva has been praised during the Donetsk tour as a ballerina distinguished by both a delicate lyricism and a strong technique.\n\nMr. Pisarev, who was born in Donetsk, a coal-and-steel-producing city, loved to dance as a child. ''We all liked to sing and dance,'' he said of his family, which includes his father, a coal miner; his mother, a factory worker, and a sister. ''And they wanted their dream to come true through me.'' Mr. Pisarev began his training at a local dance school. Knowing nothing of dance or auditions, he simply improvised to music while other children offered prepared routines. But he was greeted with applause, and the auditioners gave him high marks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
