Her vast and incredibly versatile repertoire , ranging from classical and neoclassical productions to modern and contemporary works , included principal , title and lead roles in ballets by M.Petipa, A.Bournonville, J.Cranko, F.Ashton, K.MacMillan, G.Balanchine, A.Tudor, P.Taylor, J.Kudelka, B.Stevenson, S.Welsch , V.Caniparolli .

Tentor.\n\nâ....She is one of the greatest dancers of our time.â -Alan Helms.\n\nâFor Ms. Ponomarenko, Aurora and , by implication, classical ballet technique itself were embodiment of ideal beauty. Her placement and balances made her a symbol of harmonious order.â - Boston Herald , by Theodore Bale.\n\nâPonomarenkoâs mad scene is a convincing unraveling of a soul distancing itself from life. ........Giselle dies of a broken heart. Ponomarenko May come close to breaking yours. â - Boston Globe , by Christine Temin.\n\nâPonomarenkoâs interpretation of Marguerite is gloriously nuanced.
