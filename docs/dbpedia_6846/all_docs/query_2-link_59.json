        "text": "I miss this man, his theater and his wit, every day. Moscow has never been the same without him. My writing of this piece for the Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History around 2005 or 2006 was a pleasure and an honor.\n\nModern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nGURVICH, GRIGORY EFIMOVICH (1957-1999). Director who brought style, elegance and humor to Moscow theater in the late 1980s and 1990s at his Bat (Letuchaia mysh) theater, a revival and rethinking of the legendary Bat cabaret which existed in Moscow from 1908 to 1920, then continued its life in emigration in Paris and New York.\n\nGurvich was born in Baku. His father Efim Grigorievich Gurvich was a journalist, a deputy of the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet and, for forty-seven years, head of Azerinform, the press agency of Azerbaijan. His mother Maia Lvovna Gurvich, nee Shik, taught genetics at Baku University. Gurvich learned English at an early age and harbored a deep interest in theater, both Russian and foreign, eventually graduating from the philology department of Baku University in 1978. After graduating in 1985 from the State Institute of Theater Arts (GITIS) in Moscow where he studied with the legendary professor Maria Osipovna Knebel (1898-1985), Gurvich failed to find his place in Moscow theater. Productions he prepared in the mid-1980s for the Satirikon Theater and for a studio at the Lenkom Theater were not completed. At the same time he occasionally was hired to stage kapustniki, or semi-improvised satirical skits, for various theatrical festivities. The Russian kapustnik originally arose in the nineteenth century as a means for actors to celebrate the Easter Fast, a time when public stage performances were forbidden. The name derived from the traditional Easter meal of cabbage (kapusta in Russian). Thanks largely to Nikita Fedorovich Baliev (1876 or 1886-1936), who founded the original Bat cabaret and developed the kapustnik into an original genre, it evolved into a common means of informal entertainment at celebrations of theatrical anniversaries, commencement exercises, and holidays. In 1984, after one such New Year kapustnik, the prominent director Mark Grigorievich Zakharov (1933- ) gave Gurvich the idea of reviving the Bat. In 1998, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s (1931- ) openness policy (glasnost) loosened the state’s grip on the arts, that idea became a reality.\n\nThe new Bat’s first production, The Reading of a New Play (Chtenie novoi pesy, 1989), was a smash success. Conceived, written, directed, and hosted by Gurvich as an actor/emcee, it was an episodic portrait of what happened to Baliev’s leading actors after he emigrated from the Soviet Union. I Tap around Moscow (Ya stepuiu po Moskve, 1992) was a nostalgic and comical look back at life in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, and was Gurvich’s own artistic declaration as to why he remained in Russia while many of his friends had emigrated to the West. These productions, with their stylish mix of music, dance, comedy, satire, history, and politics, established Gurvich’s Bat as a mecca for Moscow’s in-crowd. 100 Years of Cabaret (100 let kabare, 1993) was a paean to popular song from opera to Chubby Checker. In That’s Show Business! (Eto shou-biznes!, 1996) and The Great Illusion (Velikaia illiuziia, 1998) he paid tribute to American musicals, working excerpts from West-Side Story, Jesus Christ – Superstar, The Wizard of Oz, A Chorus Line and others into loosely-plotted song and dance entertainments. You Can Play it Again (Vam pozvoleno pereigrat, 1997) was a dramatic production of Max Frisch’s Biography. Gurvich’s heartfelt rendering of this tale of a dying man who is given the chance to change his past took on added meaning when he was diagnosed with inoperable leukemia. Gurvich staged a full-fledged musical, Aleksandr Klevitsky and Nikolai Denisov’s Gelsomino in the Land of Liars (Dzhelsomino v strane lzhetsov), for an independent agency in 1992.\n\nA full-bodied man of small height who spoke with a stutter, Gurvich commanded grace and poise in his physical presence, and charisma, wit, and understatement in his manner. This gave him legitimate claim to being Baliev’s successor and in the late 1990s made him a popular television personality, especially in The Old Apartment (Staraia Kvartira), a program he hosted and scripted with the playwright Viktor Iosifovich Slavkin (1935- ). For airing on New Year’s Eve, he directed the made-for-television movie A Starry Night on Kamergersky Lane (Zvezdnaia noch v Kamergerskom) in 1997. After his death his widow Liubov Aleksandrovna Gurvich (1957- ), nee Shapiro, ran the Bat until it closed in 2002.\n\nBibliography: Francis Klines, “Russian Life is a Cabaret Again.

Vladimir Ageev was not a cookie-cutter director. He was a mystic and an experimenter. His shows were unlike no one else’s, often strange and eerie. When they worked, they could be extremely effective. He was a seeker, always looking for a good new play or a good new approach to an old play. The piece below ran shortly after we learned that he was ill with cancer. With treatment, he made it until May 2, 2014. Not a long run. He died at the age of 55. I pulled the two photos above off the net. I always liked him with the long hair of his younger years, but we grew accustomed to this look towards the end.\n\n13 October 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nWhen the news surfaced in social media at the end of September it seemed unreal. Vladimir Ageyev, one of Moscow’s most prolific directors of the last 15 years, had been diagnosed with bone cancer..\n\nOne or two people posted the news in Facebook then Vladimir posted his own statement on September 27.\n\n“My dear friends,” he wrote. “Yes, indeed, I am sick — the diagnosis is complex… I’ll be doing chemotherapy which will be followed by bone marrow transplants. But I am not losing heart… All is in God’s hands….”\n\nMany of Ageyev’s friends have taken much into their own hands, as well, opening an account for donations to defray his high medical costs, and organizing a full day of benefit performances that will be held at the Theater Center Na Strastnom on Oct. 20. More information on all of that follows at the end of this blog.\n\nAgeyev, who turns 55 on Monday, is a former student of Anatoly Vasilyev’s acting and directing course at the State Institute of Theater Arts (GITIS). He graduated in 1993 and took his first steps as a director in the mid to late 1990s.\n\nHe first collaborated with the Playwright and Director Center in 2000, kicking off a professional relationship that would flourish over the next decade. As one of 15 directors in that theater’s now-legendary production of “Moscow, the Open City,” a theatrical almanac consisting of 15 short plays written by various writers and directed by various directors, Ageyev produced Andrei Vishnevsky’s 10-minute piece “Moskausee.” This strange and moving piece about what Moscow would be like today if the Germans had won World War II was one of the most striking of the 15 segments.\n\nArguably, Ageyev’s reputation was made by his production of “Captive Spirits” by the Presnyakov brothers at the Playwright and Director Center in 2003. This comic and mystical tale about the relationships among the scientist Dmitry Mendeleyev and writers Alexander Blok and Andrei Bely was a cult hit from Day One.\n\nAgeyev was one of the first Moscow directors to stage a work by then-unknown Togliatti playwright Yury Klavdiyev. His production of “Let’s Go, A Car is Waiting” was mounted in 2006, also at the Playwright and Director Center.\n\nIn all Ageyev staged eight plays at the Playwright and Director Center between 2000 and 2011. His most recent there was “Yevgenia’s Dreams” by Alexei Kazantsev, one of the founders of the theater.\n\nAgeyev’s popularity at the Playwright and Director Center led to several major productions at some of Moscow’s biggest playhouses, including the Sovremennik, the Satirikon, the Theater Na Maloi Bronnoi and the Pushkin Theater.\n\nIn recent years the director has worked closely with Drugoi Theater, where he has staged five shows, including a recent, highly-regarded revival of Viktor Slavkin’s contemporary classic, “Cerceau.”\n\nThe Theater Marathon in Support of Vladimir Ageyev is being organized by friends and colleagues that that the director has acquired over the years. Theater companies, individual actors, musicians and writers will begin performing on Oct. 20 at 2 p.m. and will continue to do so until at least 1 a.m. in various spaces at the Theater Center Na Strastnom, located at 8A Strastnoi Bulvar. (See the schedule below.)\n\nTickets are now on sale at the venue for 3,000 rubles ($93) apiece. Since everything going into the event is donated — the use of space, performers’ time, equipment and support personnel — organizers have declared that every kopeck of each ticket bought will be turned over to Ageyev.\n\nFurthermore, a ruble account has been opened in Ageyev’s name in order to receive donations. Full bank transfer information is available on a Russian-language Facebook page entitled Help for Director Vladimir Ageyev. According to a post made by Ageyev himself, over 300,000 rubles ($9,300) had been donated by late Friday. At present there is no provision for making donations in foreign currency.\n\nAgeyev posted the following message on his personal Facebook page on Thursday:\n\n“Friends, I am very moved by everyone’s concern. I’m experiencing the sea of your love. I may never have been so happy… In recent weeks I have had serious problems with my eyes, as a secondary effect. It looks like they have found the necessary treatment and I’m beginning to see again. […] I can’t wait for December 3 when my old friends get together to perform ‘Captive Spirits’.”\n\nFollowing is a barebones listing of the performances currently planned for the Oct. 20 marathon. Changes and additional performances are expected. A full schedule in Russian is available on the website of the Theater Center Na Strastnom.\n\n2 p.m. — Piano trio of the School of Dramatic Art.\n\n3 p.m. — “Tolstoy-Stolypin. Private Correspondance,” a production of Teatr.doc.\n\n5 p.m. (in the foyer) — Igor Pekhovich’s jazz performance of poetry by Joseph Brodsky.\n\n6 p.m. — “Viy,” a production of the Playwright and Director Center.\n\n7:30 p.m. (in the foyer) — Yulia Volkova and Pavel Artemyev perform poetry by Vera Polozkova.\n\n8:30 p.m. — “Alaska,” a production of Teatr.doc.\n\n10 p.m. (foyer) — acting student Vasily Beryozin performs poetry.\n\n11 p.m. — “Nine by Ten,” a production of the Mayakovsky Theater.\n\nThe telephone of the Theater Center’s box office is 495-694-4681.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 227. Some more fun lists and numbers, this time in regards to the City on the Neva. My photo above shows director Dmitry Volkostrelov in 2011.\n\n30 July 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nSome time ago I put together an unorthodox picture of Moscow theater using numbers of various kinds. It’s a hit-or-miss way of looking at a broad topic and it has no pretensions of providing a fully rounded portrait. On the other hand, the aggregation of some seemingly random figures does provide some curious insights. This week I apply the method to St. Petersburg theater.\n\n0 — the number of times you will see performances this coming season at ON.TEATR, the important venue that gave kick starts to numerous directors, actors and playwrights over the last few seasons. The theater was closed by the authorities in June. 2013, for safety violations.\n\n1 — the number of artistic directors to run the Little (Nebolshoi) Drama Theater since it was founded in 1999. Lev Erenburg is the only person to have held the post.\n\n3 — the number of roles that Innokenty Smoktunovsky played at the Bolshoi Drama Theater between 1957 and 1960. It was his first, however, Prince Myshkin in “The Idiot,” that caused a nation to crown him a genius.\n\n4 — the number of directors who have led the Theater of Comedy since the death of the great Nikolai Akimov in 1968. The four are, by name, Vadim Golikov, Pyotr Fomenko, Yury Aksyonov and the current artistic director Tatyana Kazakova.\n\n5 — the total number of productions staged by Klim during his two brief St. Petersburg periods. They are Eugene O’Neill’s “A Moon for the Misbegotten” at the Theater on Liteiny in 1996; “The Approach of a Golden Age,” after Somerset Maugham, at the Otrkyty Theater in 1996; and William Congreve’s “Love for Love” at the Theater on Liteiny, 1997; “Dream of Autumn” at Baltic House in 2003; “Why People Don’t Fly” after Ostrovsky at the Theater on Liteiny in 2004.\n\n6 — the number of years it took architect Giacomo Quarenghi to build the Hermitage Theater for Catherine the Great, from 1783 to 1789. The 240-seat hall intended exclusively for the Russian royal family and its guests is still a working venue.\n\n7 — the approximate number of names by which St. Petersburg, Petrograd, and Leningrad audiences have known the venue which, since 1991, we have called the Theater on Liteiny. Some of its names have been Mozaika (1911-1912), the Liteiny Intimate Theater (1913), and the Theater of Working Youth (TRAM, 1928-1932). Directors who have worked here include Vsevolod Meyerhold, Nikolai Yevreinov, Lev Dodin, Kama Ginkas, Genrietta Yanovskaya, Grigory Dityatkovsky, Alexander Galibin and many others.\n\n8 — the number of productions Dmitry Volkostrelov has staged for his Post Theater group (sometimes as co-productions with other theaters) since founding the organization in 2011.\n\n9 — the number of productions mounted by Valery Fokin at the Alexandrinsky Theater since he was appointed artistic director in 2002.\n\n11 — the number of actors comprising the troupe of the independent FMD Theater, based in the Dostoyevsky Museum.\n\n14 — the number of St. Petersburg venues where Andrei Moguchy had staged theatrical works prior to his appointment as artistic director of the Bolshoi Drama Theater five months ago. Venues graced by Moguchy’s work included his own Formal Theater, the Baltic House, Priyut Komedianta, the Mariinsky, the Alexandrinsky, the Circus on the Fontanka and eight nightclubs around town.\n\n17 — the number of productions that Georgy Tovstonogov staged outside of Leningrad during his storied tenure as artistic director of the Bolshoi Drama Theater from 1956 to his death in 1989. Twelve of them were done abroad\n\n22 — the number of times that Lev Dodin’s famous production of “Brothers and Sisters” for the Maly Drama Theater has toured abroad since it was first staged 28 years ago.\n\n23 — the number of the next Baltic House festival, scheduled to be held from Oct. 4 to 18. The first was held in 1991. The unifying theme for the 2013 festival is “Russians.”\n\n32 — the number of years that passed between the death of the great actress Vera Komissarzhevskaya in 1910 and the opening in 1942 of the theater that now bears her name — the Komissarzhevskaya Theater on Italyanskaya Ulitsa.\n\n39 — the total number of shows in repertory at the Youth Theater on the Fontanka at the close of the 2013 season. They included two plays by Shakespeare, two by Ostrovsky, two by Bulgakov, one by Ivan Vyrypayev and seven based on French works.\n\n40 — the number of years that Alexander Bryantsev ran the Young Spectator Theater following its founding in 1921. It’s one of the longest tenures of a theater head in Russian history.\n\n43 — the number of years that Arkady Raikin’s Variety and Miniature Theater performed in Leningrad (1939-1982) before his son Konstantin convinced him to move to Moscow and found the Satirikon Theater.\n\n50 — the number of stage productions that the popular actress Alisa Freindlikh has appeared in since her debut at Leningrad’s Komissarzhevskaya Theater in 1957.\n\n72 — the official number of issues that the St. Petersburg Theater Journal has published since 1992. The actual number is 73 because the first issue bore the number 0.\n\n80 — the number of seats in the small, but influential, Osobnyak Theater on Kamenoostrovsky Prospekt.\n\n93 — number of theaters registered in St. Petersburg, as per the rosteatr site.\n\n185 — the number of years that have passed since the building now housing the Lensoviet Theater was constructed in 1828. It actually did not become a theater until 1933.\n\n1987 — the year that the theater known as Priyut Komedianta — the Actor’s Shelter — was founded. It wasn’t until 1995, however, that it took over the space it now occupies on Sadovaya Ulitsa.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 226. I never felt like I was overdoing it by posing this loaded question after only six months had passed since the opening of the Gogol Center. What Kirill Serebrennikov was doing – and what he had already done – at this formerly dead and dusty place was nothing short of miraculous. And he and his company kept it up over the next few years. Of course, there’s no telling now what history will bring us. Serebrennikov is under house arrest; his former managing director is in jail… Will this be just another of those horrible stories of artistic talent and quality destroyed by Russian authorities? We can go back to at least the 18th century for the first of these tales. What a shame they must continue into the 21st century. Today’s repost takes us back to a time when there was nothing but good news on the horizon. My photo above shows Kirill Serebrennikov speaking to the crowd at the closing of the first season of the new Gogol Center.\n\n21 July 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nMy annual Moscow Times theater awards won’t be published in print and online until next week but I can lift the curtain on one secret now: Gogol Center is going to be generously represented in that list.\n\nEvery once in awhile a theater comes along in Russia that lives up to the distinguished notion that theater in Russia is more than theater.\n\nSkipping over the Moscow Art Theater, which towers over virtually every theater in the world, let me leap to a few that came into being in more recent times: the Bolshoi Drama Theater in Leningrad after it was turned over to Georgy Tovstonogov in 1956; the Sovremennik Theater, founded by a team of actors in 1957; the Taganka Theater after it was taken over by Yury Lyubimov in 1964; the Maly Drama Theater in Leningrad after it was taken over by Lev Dodin in 1982; the Playwright and Director Center, founded in 1998 by Alexei Kazantsev.\n\nAll of these theaters went far beyond reflecting their eras successfully. They actually established aesthetic standards and creative goals that affected everyone working around them. In short, they changed the theater of their time.\n\nAstonishingly, I see Gogol Center doing that already and it has only been a working playhouse for five months.\n\nKirill Serebrennikov, one of the most popular directors to emerge in Russia over the last decade or so, was appointed to lead the old Gogol Theater 11 months ago. It was a controversial move and there was staunch opposition to it from inside and outside the theater. Serebrennikov, however, got down to the business of creating a new theater.\n\nIn place of the old single, unified troupe, Serebrennikov developed a broader concept. At present there are actually four groups working side by side at the Center — the troupe of the former Gogol Theater, Serebrennikov’s former students now known as the 7th Studio, Vladimir Pankov’s SounDrama Studio, and Dialogue Dance, a contemporary dance group that originated in Kostroma.\n\nNot all the groups are working at full force yet, it would seem.\n\nDialogue Dance has yet to put up anything new, while Pankov moved a few of his shows originally created elsewhere to the Center. His first new show there will be “Car,” a version of Yury Klavdiyev’s “Let’s Go, A Car is Waiting” that will premiere in September.\n\nBut the interchange of creative forces between the company of the old Gogol Theater and Serebrennikov’s 7th Studio has produced some astonishing work.\n\nConsider the numbers alone — eight new productions were mounted between the theater’s gala opening on Feb. 2 and the season closer on June 30. The range of material is striking, including musical works (“Utyosov,” based on songs made popular by Leonid Utyosov in the Soviet period), the Soviet absurd (Alexander Vvedensky’s “Christmas at the Ivanovs”), post-Soviet prose (Viktor Yerofeyev’s “Russian Beauty”), classical Russian prose (Ivan Bunin’s “Mitya’s Love”) and European screenplays from the second half of the 20th century (Visconti’s “Rocco and His Brothers,” Fassbinder’s “Fear Eats the Soul” and Von Trier’s “The Idiots.”)\n\nAdd to that the fact that Serebrennikov has enlisted a large number of directors and playwrights to share the creative load with him. This, by Russian standards, may be one of the new theater’s biggest breaks with tradition. Usually a director takes over a theater and dominates it with his own vision, style and work. Serebrennikov is clearly putting his stamp on everything that happens at Gogol Center, but he is not monopolizing the creative process. He himself staged just two shows — “The Hunting of the Snark” and “The Idiots.”\n\nHe oversaw the Russian debut of Latvian-born Vladislav Nastavshev, who staged two brilliant shows this year — “Mitya’s Love” and “Fear.” He provided an opportunity for film director Alexei Mizgiryov to make his theater debut with “Brothers.” He commissioned interesting works from young directors Zhenya Berkovich (“Russian Beauty”) and Denis Azarov (“Christmas at the Ivanovs”).\n\nFor the European screenplay project he signed on Russian playwrights Mikhail Durnenkov, Valery Pecheikin and Lyuba Strizhak, of which only Durnenkov has an established reputation. Pecheikin and Strizhak both fly under the banner of promising writers for the future and it is pretty clear from the quality of their work at Gogol Center that, thanks to the opportunity provided by Serebrennikov, their future will come sooner than later.\n\nGogol Center looks like no other Russian theater. Designed by Vera Martynova and Serebrennikov, it has the feel of a night club-meets-museum-meets-cultural center. With flashy neon-lit mirrors depicting great theater directors from the past, a compact but excellent bookstore, and curated programs of concerts, lectures and discussions, the place is virtually buzzing with activity.\n\nThe audience, too, looks like no other I see in town. It’s mostly young and hip, similar to audiences that frequent Teatr.doc and the Playwright and Director Center, but there is an added element that changes that entirely. This crowd comes dressed to kill.\n\nUntil now if you wanted to see women and men decked out in finery at a Moscow theater, you would go to the Lenkom or the Satirikon. Those audiences, however, tend to be older and relatively conservative. Gogol Center has tapped into a whole new demographic niche: bold, young, aesthetically adventurous individuals who are ready, willing and able to show off their command of style.\n\nNone of this, of course, would mean much if the product were not in evidence. But that is precisely what is pulling in these fascinating new crowds — cutting edge theater that speaks the language of young, demanding and intelligent spectators.\n\nSerebrennikov steered his theater through deep, rich waters in its first few months of life. He tapped into inclinations of nostalgia for the Soviet period with “Ustyosov.” He revived a work of the under-appreciated Soviet avant-garde in “Christmas at the Ivanovs.” He blew down cultural obstacles by embracing three great European films as fodder for contemporary Russian problems and aesthetics. He gave a nod to pre-revolutionary and emigre culture in “Mitya’s Love” and he tapped into post-Soviet sensibilities with “Russian Beauty.”\n\nAnd as if this wasn’t enough, there was the season-closing party where young members of Gogol Center’s troupe put on an astonishing concert. Drummers took over as lead singers, guitarists moved to drums, keyboard players moved to other instruments, all the while keeping up a knee-shaking, waist-wobbling concert that spanned every genre of music I can think of. They played rock, they did reggae, they crooned pop and they rapped rap. These were all actors, mind you! Turns out they’re great musicians on the side.\n\nIn short, Gogol Center is simply loaded with talent, ideas and style. It already feels like the flagship theater of the current generation.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 215. Just a fun tossing-together of trivial facts. My photo above shows the interior of the Maly Theater in Moscow. Technically speaking the Maly hall has one balcony and two tiers, but to the naked eye they look every bit like three balconies.\n\n05 May 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nBeing a fan of Henry Miller, I love lists. Being an old sports aficionado, I love numbers and statistics. This week and in the months to come I propose to bring those two loves together on occasion in order to draw an unusual, if incomplete, picture of Russian theater. Today I focus exclusively on Moscow. I’ll take on other locales in future posts.\n\n0 — the number of people who actually know how many theaters and theater companies exist in Moscow. I have used the number of 115 for a couple of years now, but that is a guesstimate. I count 102 in the recent issue of Teatralnaya Afisha, but it doesn’t list a few obvious venues (Teatr.doc, Polytheater and Praktika, for instance), and it misses several companies whose work comes at irregular intervals.\n\n3 — the number of balconies at the Maly Theater. Technically speaking the theater has one balcony and two so-called tiers, but let’s not be pedants.\n\n4 — the number of shows in which you can see the great Inna Churikova perform at the Lenkom Theater — “The Lioness of Aquitaine,” Tout Paye,” “The City of Millionaires” and “Lies for Salvation.” Until recently she was in the cast of “The Marriage,” but has since left that show.\n\n8 — the number of productions staged by Rimas Tuminas at the Vakhtangov Theater since becoming its artistic director in 2007.\n\n10 — the number of chief directors to run the renamed Pushkin Theater since 1950, following the closure by Soviet authorities of Alexander Tairov’s famous Kamerny Theater in the same location on Tverskoi Bulvar in 1949. The current artistic director of the Pushkin is Yevgeny Pisarev.\n\n12 — the number of Pyotr Fomenko productions still in repertory at the Fomenko Studio following his death in August 2012.\n\n22.7 — the number of meters (74.48 feet) spanning the distance from the front to the back of the main stage of the Chekhov Moscow Art Theater on Kamergersky Pereulok.\n\n30 — the number of productions currently in repertory at the Moscow Theater Yunogo Zritelya. Among them are six productions by artistic director Genrietta Yanovskaya and 11 by her husband Kama Ginkas.\n\n35 — the number of days since playwright Ivan Vyrypayev officially took over Praktika Theater as artistic director. (This blog was posted on the fifth day of May.)\n\n47 — the approximate number of dramatic productions of plays, stories and other texts by Anton Chekhov currently running in town. I say approximate because this number may be slightly low due to the way that repertory theaters work, often keeping shows running, although not playing them every month.\n\n56 — the number of performances of Oleg Menshikov’s production of Maksym Kurochkin’s epic drama “Kitchen” between the opening in November 2000 and the last show in June 2002.\n\n83 — the number of actors in the troupe of the Mayakovsky Theater.\n\n90 — the number of years since the Mossoviet Theater was founded.\n\n100 — the years between the founding of the Moscow Art Theater and the Playwright and Director Center. Alexei Kazantsev, the founder of the Playwright and Director Center, told me that he actually hurried the opening of the first show in late 1998 in order to open his theater exactly 100 years after Stanislavsky opened his.\n\n103 — the total number of individuals — including actors, musicians, singers, dancers and performing technicians — who take the stage during a single performance of Dmitry Krymov’s “Tararabumbia” at the School of Dramatic Art.\n\n138 — the largest number of spectators I have ever counted at an event at Teatr.doc, a basement that comfortably seats around 50. Actually, on that day in September 2011, 137 spectators crammed into the space for a reading of Yury Muravitsky’s “Pornography,” and one more stood outside on the street and followed the reading through an open window.\n\n650 — the number of rubles ($20.74) it costs to buy a ticket in the last row, far right corner, for the famous old production of “An Unusual Concert” at the Obraztsov Puppet Theater.\n\n1,130 — a low estimate of the total number of dramatic productions currently running in Moscow. This is an impossible number to pin down because of the complexities of repertoire listings, but you get the idea. Moscow offers theatergoers choices.\n\n1,535 — the number of seats in the cavernous large auditorium of the Russian Army Theater.\n\n3,500 — the number of rubles ($111.70) needed to buy a single sixth row, center, seat to see Konstantin Raikin perform the title role in “King Lear” at the Satirikon Theater.\n\n30,000,000 — the approximate number of dollars, perhaps a tad less, that it cost for the city of Moscow to build the spectacular School of Dramatic Art on Sretenka Ulitsa in 2001. If you have ever seen the building designed by Igor Popov and Anatoly Vasilyev, you know it was worth every penny.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 211. Extremely rarely did I use my blog space to write something like a review. One of the instances in which I might do that was during the Golden Mask Festival – it gave me an opportunity to write about shows I would not normally be able to write about (since my policy was to write about shows that readers could go out and see, i.e, shows produced and performed in Moscow). This meant that every year I pretty much got to write a review of a production by Lev Dodin. This particular year, however, there was no Dodin to write about – so some other St. Petersburg theaters got the spotlight. The photo above, from the Golden Mask archives, is of “Antibodies,” a production by St. Petersburg’s Baltiisky Dom. (One of the shows I discuss below, Pavel Pryazhko’s “Haughty Girl” underwent a name change in English, when I later translated and published it in TheatreForum journal as “Angry Girl,” which I came to realize was much closer to the original intent.)\n\n07 April 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nThere was plenty of talk when the nominations for this year’s Golden Mask awards were announced and St. Petersburg’s Lev Dodin was nowhere to be found among them.\n\nDodin, the master of the Maly Drama Theater — known in the West affectionately as “the Maly” — is a perennial nominee and almost a perennial winner. He has been the standard-bearer for theatrical excellence in St. Petersburg since the late 1980s and he still is that, make no mistake.\n\nBut things have changed, make no mistake about that either. That became quite clear to me on Thursday and Friday. In the course of those two days I saw three shows from St. Petersburg, each very different, each a huge success if taken on its own terms.\n\nBut let’s get one messy detail out of the way before we expand upon that.\n\nThe day is long gone when an actor or director worked with a “home” company and rarely strayed. So when we talk “St. Petersburg productions,” we’re also talking about some pretty important Moscow talent. Just as some significant St. Petersburg talent has begun to call Moscow at least a home-away-from-home — consider the movie star Konstantin Khabensky at the Moscow Art Theater or the director Yury Butusov working at the Satirikon, the Art Theater and the Pushkin Theater.\n\nAs such, some of the St. Petersburg shows at the Golden Mask have a Moscow stamp. The Alexandrinsky’s scintillating “Hedda Gabler” was staged by Moscow’s Kama Ginkas. (Although Ginkas attended theater institute in Leningrad in the 1960s and worked there sporadically in the 1970s.) “Lear,” a production of the Priyut Komedianta, was staged by Konstantin Bogomolov, who was born, bred and began his career in Moscow. Even Mikhail Patlasov, who directed “Antibodies” for Baltiisky Dom, spent a few years studying in Moscow after beginning his career in Perm, but before moving to St. Petersburg.\n\nThe point is that I am not referring to a “purely” St. Petersburg kind of theater art. But the fact remains: in two days I saw three highly innovative shows that originated in the city on the Neva River.\n\nThe first I saw was Dmitry Volkostrelov’s staging of Pavel Pryazhko’s “Haughty Girl,” produced by the Bryantsev Theater Yunogo Zritelya and Post Theater. Born in Moscow 30 years ago, Volkostrelov studied in St. Petersburg with Dodin and founded his Post Theater there a few years ago, although, let’s note, he was born in Moscow and he told me Thursday that he now is spending most of his time here.\n\nVolkostrelov has earned a strong following (while baffling some) with a distinctive style that seems to take the notion of “realism” to extremes. His actors move around the stage, sometimes talking to themselves, sometimes busying themselves silently with tasks the audience has no way of understanding. If I had to find comparisons to make the point I might compare his works to the paintings of Edward Hopper, say, or to the way we perceive what fish are up to in an aquarium.\n\nMost of the time in recent years Volkostrelov has worked with the texts of Pavel Pryazhko, a Minsk-based writer whose plays originally appeared in Moscow thanks to Teatr.doc, and who increasingly seems to be seeking ways to break down the theatrical and dramatic process in new ways.\n\nPryazhko’s “The Soldier,” for example, consists of two sentences and Volkostrelov’s production takes 15 minutes to perform. Yet it is more fully defined than most new plays I see produced. Another recent collaboration between the two was “I Am Free” — wherein Volkostrelov stood in front of an audience showing 90 minutes of bleak slides “organized” dramaturgically by Pryazhko. When I saw this performance in September it really angered most people in the hall. Volkostrelov, who constantly wears an almost imperceptible grin on his lips, never changed expressions once as people shouted at him and he continued to click his computer to bring up the next slide.\n\nBy comparison, “Haughty Girl” might seem a traditional play — although it is nothing of the sort. There is almost no dialogue. Most of the text is prose description or narration with a few monologues tossed in. Volkostrelov’s actors lounge on stage, go to bed, sleep, fix coffee, watch movies on their computers, swim in swimming pools and stand jumping up and down in the cold. Rarely do they actually do what the words of the play say, so there is usually a gap in what we perceive. It works a little bit like stereo, I guess, whereby our brains are given two sets of information simultaneously — what we see and what we hear. It’s up to us to make of it what we will.\n\nI found the show to be a brilliant and incisive portrait of a generation.\n\nOne hour after the conclusion of “Haughty Girl,” with its highly stylized, super-clean visual lines, I found myself staring at the wildly chaotic set for Patlasov’s production of “Antibodies.” This is a piece of documentary theater, based on interviews with people involved in one way or another in the 2005 murder of a young antifascist in St. Petersburg. In well edited snippets we hear from the mothers of the killer and the victim, from the victim’s girlfriend, from a security guard who watched the event occur, from one of the killer’s fascist friends and from the police investigator.\n\nThe story is harrowing and, what is more, the production is too.\n\nThat is a tremendous achievement. If I have a complaint with documentary drama as we usually see it — and, boy, do I ever — it is that the shows we see are often weaker and less involving than the burning topics they take on. After attending documentary productions about murder and mayhem I often leave the theater grateful that someone is taking on these controversial topics, but underwhelmed by the theatrical experience. At worst, this does legitimate social or political topics a great injustice by making them seem banal.\n\n“Antibodies” raises the level of its performance to match the drama and horror of its topic. It’s the kind of show that leaves an audience stunned. Questions of whether you “like” what you saw or not are beside the point. The show does what it intends to – make you feel that suffering, anger and helplessness that destroyed (or did not destroy) the lives of those affected by a senseless murder.\n\nThe set designed by Valentina Serebrennikova is brilliant (although she is inexplicably not nominated for a Golden Mask award). It uses a multitude of surfaces — doors, walls, glass panes, human bodies and such — on which to project light or video projections fed from two live cameras stalking the stage with the actors. The juxtaposition of close-ups, long shots and mirrored effects conceived by video designer Yelena Anisimova either expands the significance of the images we see, or breaks down our sense of visual unity, depending upon the device being used at any given moment.\n\nAs for the acting, it is arguably the finest I have ever seen in a Russian docudrama. There isn’t a wisp of overacting. Yet the connection between each performer and his/her character is so deep that it leaves a profound impression on us. It’s no coincidence that Olga Belinskaya is nominated for Best Actress. She is superb in the devastating role of the killer’s mother.\n\nFriday I took in Bogomolov’s “Lear.” Bogomolov has become something of the bete noir of Russian theater lately, his kitsch-laden, inventive, poetic and pop-oriented shows garnering him huge groups of fans and detractors.\n\n“Lear,” as the title suggests, is less than Shakespeare’s “King Lear” – but it is also much more. This garish, in-your-face production is a mostly comic riff on the theme of the tragedy. It is set in the Moscow Kremlin before and during World War II, with a few scenes moving to an insane asylum and the front line of military action. Most characters bear Russian or Russianized names and General Secretary Lear, if I may put it that way, is a foul-mouthed, enigmatic character whose behavior changes little, regardless of whether he is in full charge or himself is in the charge of psychiatrists.\n\nThe text includes bits of Shakespeare, Varlam Shalamov, Paul Celan, Friedrich Nitzsche (his Zarathustra is a character in the play) and others. In all cases men play female characters, women play male characters.\n\nIt is a violent, crazy, irreverent portrayal of the way dictatorial power consumes everyone who touches it. The twist here, however, is that dictators and their sycophants never die. They just get up from their bloody spots on the floor and carry on dictating and scheming.\n\nBogomolov created a comic-book version of Shakespeare’s story (not play), that yanks it into the modern world. His version of Lear-as-Stalin is on no way time specific. This cold, reptilian, zombie-like dictator is a dictator for all seasons.\n\nI hesitate to draw any far-reaching conclusions based on this trio of shows. Twelve, 14 years ago St. Petersburg seemed poised to make a huge leap forward, as several young directors began making very impressive, important work. But that kind of petered out, if you’ll pardon the sour pun.\n\nAs such, I’ll avoid making any grand predictions. But I do want to say: St. Petersburg theaters have provided me with the most rewarding hours I have spent so far at this year’s Golden Mask Festival.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 179. The loss of Pyotr Fomenko five summers ago still stings. He was a large part of my Moscow theater. We were not “friends,” I did not hang out with him. But we crossed paths countless times, always enjoyed each others’ company, and always had something joyous or funny to say to each other. My wife Oksana Mysina has a great story of running into him on the streets of St. Petersburg one night, a meeting that turned into an all-nighter of sorts. I’ll let her tell that someday. I mention it because that’s the kind of person he was. Quick on the uptake. I took the photo above in the foyer of the Pyotr Fomenko Workshop Theatre (that’s now their preferred name in English). These days Fomenko’s ghostly portrait hovers over spectators before they enter the hall to see performances.\n\n10 August 2012\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nThe superlatives will flow. The death of director Pyotr Fomenko at the age of 80 on Thursday will unleash a torrent of beautiful, respectful, praiseful, loving words.\n\nI cannot possibly do anything but join the chorus.\n\nFomenko was, perhaps, the most beloved theater director of his generation in Russia. His best productions challenged those of us who wrote about them to find ever new ways of describing elegant perfection.\n\nWhen I think of Fomenko I think of subtle smells and delicate sounds. Fomenko always challenged his audience to attune itself to subtleties, to the kinds of details that we ignore in everyday life. It was one of many ways that his work lifted us above the mundane.\n\nI can still recall the rich scent of fresh, peeled oranges in Olga Mukhina’s “Tanya-Tanya” at Fomenko’s own Fomenko Studio in 1996. As I can smell the fragrant talc that cascaded down through a chute under the ceiling onto the stage and the audience in his scintillating production of Fernand Crommelynck’s “The Magnanimous Cuckold” on the small stage of the Satirikon in 1994.\n\nFomenko could get more out of a rustling dress or the clinking of glasses than any director I have known.\n\nThe reason, I suspect, was the depth of wisdom and experience that went into everything he did. There was never a random element in a Fomenko production. He filled every one of his actors’ gestures and intonations with meaning. He had a stunning and complete command of his profession that was rivaled only by his extraordinary feel for life.\n\nAccording to an acquaintance of mine who studied with Fomenko at the Moscow Art Theater school in the early 1950s, a friend of Fomenko’s once bet he could not stop traffic on Tverskaya Ulitsa. Rising to the challenge, Fomenko walked on his hands all the way from Pushkin Square to what is now the mayor’s office, where he proceeded to lay out a row of vials filled with alcohol from one side of the street to the other.\n\nNeedless to say, traffic came to a halt on Tverskaya.\n\nNot counting that marvelously spontaneous and untitled performance, Pyotr Fomenko debuted as a director in 1958 with Konstantin Finn’s “A Troubled Legacy” at the Malaya Bronnaya Theater in Moscow. Through his final production, “Triptych” in 2009, he staged over 60 plays, including a rendition of Alexander Ostrovsky’s “The Forest” at the Comedie Francaise in Paris in 2003. He directed three feature films and made 10 films for television.\n\nFomenko’s path in life and art was anything but easy.\n\nUnable to find regular work in Moscow in the 1970s, he spent most of the decade toiling at the Leningrad Theater of Comedy. The 80s were even more complex for him — he could not find a permanent place of employment at any theater and ended up spending most of his time teaching directing and acting at GITIS, the State Institute of Theater Arts.\n\nHis work at GITIS changed his life. A group of students that Fomenko gathered in the late 1980s began showing such promise that most became stars even before they graduated in 1992. On the strength of this group Fomenko was given the opportunity to keep the entire class together in a professional theater that took its name from his studio at GITIS — the Pyotr Fomenko Studio.\n\nEven though it still lacked a physical home and had to perform on rented stages around the city, the Fomenko Studio immediately became one of Moscow’s most popular and respected theaters.\n\nBeginning at the turn of the 21st century, and now occupying two small stages in an old Stalin-era apartment building not far from the Poklonnaya Gora monument, Fomenko turned out a string of hit productions that included “One Absolutely Happy Village” (2000), “Family Happiness” (2000), “The Mad Woman from Chaillot” (2001), “War and Peace” (2001) and “Egyptian Nights” (2002). These shows won countless awards and frequently toured the stages of Europe, where Fomenko became one of Russia’s best-known cultural ambassadors.\n\nFomenko’s production of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” in 2004 was, perhaps, the greatest work of his final decade. Sweeping and delicate at the same time, it was a deeply tragic piece that focused relentlessly on the human penchant for folly and failure. It was performed on rented stages for four years until the spectacular new home of the Fomenko Studio’s large stage was opened on Taras Shevchenko Naberezhnaya in 2008.\n\nFomenko had a way of creating shows that I, along with thousands of others, related to as if they were personal messages, bits of wisdom or insight offered in a hushed whisper and with a wink. I felt as though I breathed more deeply, felt more acutely and heard more sensitively when I attended a Fomenko production. He was a master of exploring human emotions and was quite capable of driving audiences to tears of joy and sadness, although there wasn’t a sentimental bone in his body.\n\nThe pangs of remorse and the sighs of joy Pyotr Fomenko inspired in us were always rich, deep, meaningful and real.\n\nTheater Plus blog No. 117. This was a cool evening. It brought together several of my favorite people – George Genoux, a German director in Russia, David M. White, an American playwright in Baltimore, and many others. Georg was and still is (in Ukraine and Germany where he usually works now) was a master organizer. David had been doing great things in the U.S. with his WordBRIDGE playwrights laboratory. I kind of brought them together and we had a fabulous evening in one of Moscow’s Arte FAQ cafes. You’ll get a bit more information by reading on below. I’ll only add that I can’t possibly imagine things like this happening in Moscow anymore. Not only is Georg gone, but the spirit of that time is gone. If you follow the cultural news out of Moscow, you may know that Konstantin Raikin, the great actor, director and head of the Satirikon Theater, publicly admitted yesterday that the Russian Culture Ministry has been harassing his theater for the last year. It is not yet on the level of the harassment suffered by Kirill Serebrennikov, Alexei Malobrodsky and others, but it is disturbing nonetheless. Russia now is a place where artists are targets of the state. As I say, we have come a long, long way since the night of this fabulous evening that brought together Georg Genoux and David M. White. My photo above shows poet Vera Polozkova, playwright Nina Belenitskaya and actor-researcher Molly Flynn reading George Brant’s “Clipped” at An Evening of Short American Plays at Arte FAQ cafe in 2011.\n\n15 May 2011\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nI have lived in Moscow for nearly 23 years and I have heard this comment so many times my head hurts: “Russians and Americans are identical,” “We Russians and you Americans are exactly alike.”\n\nI don’t believe it for a minute. But I continue to hear it.\n\nI most recently heard it at an evening of readings of short American plays in Russian translation. The event, which was called just that — “An Evening of Short American Plays” — was organized by Georg Genoux of the Joseph Beuys Theater in Moscow. It was held downstairs on Thursday in the club at the ArteFAQ café.\n\nI had a hand in it too, because the plays came to Georg’s attention through me. I occasionally collaborate with the WordBRIDGE Playwrights Laboratory in the United States, and it seemed to me that the people at WordBRIDGE and the people at Joseph Beuys had something in common.\n\nAfter a bit of vetting, the plays that I delivered to Georg were the following: Erik Ramsay’s “Traction”; K. Frithjof Peterson’s “Gun Metal Blue Bar”; John Walch’s “Aisle 17B”; George Brant’s “Clipped”; Samuel Brett Williams’ “Missed Connections”; David M. White’s “Enough.” Each is a dramatic sketch that takes roughly 10 minutes to read. Perfect for an hour’s evening of entertainment.\n\nThat’s when the surprises began for me. Yury Muravitsky, the director to whom Georg entrusted the work on the readings, told me a month or so ago that he was knocked out by the plays. Very funny, very clear, he said.\n\nVery clear? Very funny? Okay, the old geezer dying in “Enough” might be like old geezers dying in many places in the world, but the lunatics in “Traction” who appear to see religion in the notion of the tire gripping the road? The sadistic middle-aged farmer snapping pigeons’ necks to keep the flock pure in “Gun Metal Blue Bar?”\n\nI was taken aback. Even after living in Russia for 23 years I still never tell jokes in Russian. Never. Ever. And when I do, they fail. Period. The Russian “anecdote” and the American “joke” — well, they’re like American jello and Russian jellied meat, if you know what I mean. If you don’t, trust me: Russians barf at the former and Americans barf at the latter.\n\nBut I’m digressing.\n\nAfter the readings on Thursday, and after my wife put on a blistering blitz concert of Russian-American rock and roll with her band Oxy Rocks, I went stalking. I was curious to find out what people thought. I was encouraged by the fact that approximately 120 people had crammed into a space that supposedly holds 85. I was encouraged by the fact that the SRO audience listened intently and often laughed when you might expect it. I was buoyed by the fact that, following the final reading, the place burst into – as the official Kremlin chroniclers used to put it — an “intense, sustained ovation.”\n\nYeah, but maybe they were just being polite. I wanted real answers from real people — not just a mass response from an unpredictable crowd.\n\nI sidled up to Varvara Nazarova. She’s a fabulous young actress, performs in several of Dmitry Krymov’s productions at the School of Dramatic Art. She’s talented, smart, young and hip. She’ll give me the real dope.\n\n“Amazing,” she said with a big grin lighting up her face. “Astonishing how you Americans are just like us Russians!”\n\n“You sure about that?” I asked, skeptical.\n\n“Oh, yeah!” she said. “You’ve got that same, like, boldness and, uh, arrogance.”\n\n“Well,” I muttered inconclusively. “But there’s more…”\n\n“I think it must be that we are both used to being big empires,” she went on. “We’re powerful. We like power. And we’ve got space, lots of it. We’re used to being able to throw our elbows around.”\n\n“Okay, yeah, I’ve heard that, but I’m not sure that’s enough to…”\n\n“No, no. It’s true! You Americans are just like us!”\n\nHmm. Another tack, another person.\n\nI asked a stranger about the translations. What sounded rough? Was there anything that sounded un-Russian in the texts?\n\n“Excellent translations,” she said.\n\nNow, this is the perfect place to note that the translations — indeed, very good — were done by Yekaterina Raikova, Lera Kudryavtseva and Oksana Alyoshina. But, really? No flaws?\n\n“Surely there were some words or phrases, that stuck out wrong?” I pressed ahead in my mission for the truth.\n\n“Nothing. They all had a perfect flow as if they were written in Russian. Very funny.”\n\nI moved on to Yelena Kostyukovich. She is the literary director at the Saratov Youth Theater. She oversees annual new play festivals in Saratov, so she’ll definitely tell me the truth.\n\n“Those were fabulous plays,” she said, her eyes shining happily. “It’s like they were Russian. Their sense of humor is exactly like ours.”\n\n“Yeah, Lena,” I said, “But…”\n\n“Oh, yes,” she cut me off. “Very funny, very acerbic on the surface, and devastatingly tragic underneath.”\n\nThere’s a Russian phrase that sort of goes, “Don’t leave behind good to go in search of good.” I’m a big fan of Russian wisdom. What else could I do then, but believe what people were telling me?\n\nNow, I know: You doubters are going to say they were just being polite.\n\nBut, aha! Gotcha! That’s Americans who are “just polite!” When have you ever seen a Russian “just be polite?”\n\nSo. I’m still a doubter myself. And I still will never eat my mother-in-law’s jellied meat, which is considered her absolute specialty among the family. I’m an American. I don’t do that.\n\nBut maybe Russian and American dramatists are closer than I thought. That might be a topic to explore some day."
