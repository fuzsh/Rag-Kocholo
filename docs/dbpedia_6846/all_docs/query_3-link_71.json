        "text": "After all, if you want to tell a good story, all of these elements must become inseparable so that the audience becomes captured; spellbound even. For the audience, the sheer excitement of experiencing that suspension-of-disbelief is why they go and see him perform in the first place. And that is what Denys does. He bends the audience to his will. His movements reflect what the audience feels. Do they feel joy? Or sadness? His entire self creates and delivers that emotive energy to anyone who goes to see him.\n\nIn the past many people have always asked him questions. Why he adores ballet so much. What does he think about before he goes on stage? They talk about the work he has done so far. But rarely do they ask about what Denys is made up of.\n\nDenys used to go along to his sister’s traditional Folk Dance classes, sit on the side and watch. At the age of 5 he was already watching the coordination and the musicality behind all the dance exercises. Week after week he sat there watching the class, learning their choreography through process and practice. He watched how they moved their arms. He watched how the fabric of their costumes added expression. He watched how the carefully choreographed movements create a performance more beautiful than he could have ever imagined. It was through this experience that he understood, very early on, that an emotional performance would resonate with how an audience might feel.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the 5 year old Denys no longer wanted to sit on the side and watch. He wanted to be involved so he started dancing too. Within weeks his folklore teacher was calling him ‘Vasiliev’. Of course, at this age it was his mother who had to sit him down and explain exactly who this ‘Vasiliev’ was. He knows now of course! His teacher, back then, said to Denys he ought to make the switch from folklore to ballet. She even brought in a flyer to class for a Ballet audition. It was for 7-8 year olds and Denys went along with a friend. Denys recalls watching the panel of selectors through the keyhole and instead of being afraid of them, his curiosity allowed him to watch and observe. He watched the panel of selectors discuss his friend’s flexibility and jump technique. So, when his friend came out with such a happy expression on his face Denys he knew that he too had to go into that room.\n\nDenys queued with the others to audition and was met by the security team who asked him how old he was. He replied 6. The security guard looked at him and explained that he was too young to audition, but he could come back next year when he was old enough. As young as he was, Denys felt ready. He felt ready to go into that room and dance so he just refused to leave until they let him audition. Eventually they gave in and they let him through. Denys must have made quite an impression as he was awarded a place in the Ballet Academy of Vadim Pisarev at the age of 6, a year earlier than anyone else."
