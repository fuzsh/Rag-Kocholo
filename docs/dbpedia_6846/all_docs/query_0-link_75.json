        "text": "Rudolf Nureyev's life and career will be celebrated in London with five performances at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, which is where Nureyev made his London debut.\n\nFormer Royal Ballet principal Nehemiah Kish is the artistic director for the performances that will feature 22 leading dancers performing nine classical ballet excerpts representing highlights of Nureyev's career.\n\nThe dancers that can be seen from 5-12 September are William Bracewell, Yuhui Choe, Alina Cojocaru, Cesar Corrales, Guillaume Côté (12 September), Benjamin Ella, Francesco Gabriele Frola, Emma Hawes, Francesca Hayward, Daichi Ikarashi, Oleg Ivenko, Germain Louvet (5 and 6 September), Natascha Mair, Maia Makhateli, Vadim Muntagirov, Yasmine Naghdi, Natalia Osipova, Xander Parish, Iana Salenko, Marcelino Sambé, Alexandr Trusch, Marianna Tsembenhoi from companies includingThe Royal Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, Dutch National Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, and the English National Ballet.\n\nDame Monica Mason (who shared the stage with Nureyev many times) and Ralph Fiennes (who appeared in and directed The White Crow, the film about Nureyev's early life and defection), are the presenters on the opening night, and a filmed version will be shown at the subsequent performances.\n\nNehemiah Kish said,\n\nFrom my earliest memories as a young dancer, I have regarded Rudolf Nureyev as synonymous with classical ballet. At Canada's National Ballet School, I was fortunate to study with a close colleague of Nureyev and our training was infused with daily reminders of the impossibly high standard of discipline and artistry that Nureyev practiced. Every step of my dance education and professional career has been shaped by those who knew Nureyev and drew inspiration from his passion and commitment to illustrate the highest achievements in dance and inspire the next generation of dancers. In presenting this programme, I want to celebrate Rudolf Nureyev's transformative influence on dance and his legacy, expressed through the performances of today's most incredible dancers.\n\nThe evening will begin with a solo Nureyev choreographed forThe Sleeping Beauty underlining the impact he had on elevating the role of the male dancer by adding solos to the classical repertoire. It will be danced by Germain Louvet of the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nOther extracts include a pas de deux from Gayane, which reflects Nureyev's folk dance roots and will danced by Oleg Ivenko (who played Nureyev in The White Crow) with Maia Mahkateli; and the pas de six from Laurencia, which Nureyev staged with the Royal Ballet for a TV special in 1964, which has been staged for the gala by Natalia Osipova, who will be accompanied by Marcelino Sambé and four dancers from The Royal Ballet.\n\nLive music will come from 40 musicians of the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, conducted by David Briskin, Musical Director of the National Ballet of Canada. Costumes which draw on archival footage of Nureyev's performances have been created by ballet dancer turned designer Natalia Stewart.\n\nA proportion of tickets for the production will be offered free of charge to ballet students and workers in the NHS. Some of the dancers in the programme have been direct beneficiaries of bursaries to study from The Rudolph Nureyev Foundation.\n\nNureyev Legend and Legacy | Theatre Royal Drury Lane\n\n5 September 2022 at 7.30pm\n\n6 & 12 September 2022 at 2pm and 7.30pm\n\nTickets from £25: lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/theatre-royal-drury-lane\n\nDancers' Biographies\n\nWilliam Bracewell Welsh dancer William Bracewell joined The Royal Ballet in 2017.
