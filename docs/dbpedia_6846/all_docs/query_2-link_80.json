INAA is presently being used in several projects on air pollution studies using bio monitors (moss, lichens, tree bark). The results for some selected areas of Central Russia, South Urals, and countries of Europe (Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, Slovakia, Western Ukraine) are reported to the European Atlas of Heavy Metal Atmospheric Deposition edited under the auspices of the Environmental Commission of the United Nations. Battering-ram studies using NAA were initiated also in Turkey, China and South Korea. Applied to the analysis of air filters, INAA is successfully used in assessing quality of London underground air, Sahara desert impact on the Greater Cairo Area. Epithermal activation analysis in combination with atomic absorption spectrometry and energy-disperse X-ray fluorescence allowed source evaluation of metals in soil from some industrial and metropolitan areas of Russia (South Urals, Cola Peninsula) and the USA (Minneapolis). The analytical possibilities of NAA are favorably used in biotechnology, (i) for investigation of bacterial leaching of metals, including uranium and thorium from low-grade ores, rocks and industrial wastes; (i i) in the development of new pharmaceuticals based on the blue-green alga Spirulina platensis. Occupational health studies are carried out at several fertilizer plants in Russia, Uzbekistan, Poland, Romania, Denmark and the Netherlands in the framework of the 5th Programme Copernicus. The quality of foodstuffs grown in some contaminated areas of Russia is investigated in the framework of IAEA Coordinated Research Programme.

Previously the international community of Dubna's experimentalists and theorists (high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low energy nuclear and neutron physics, accelerator and applied nuclear physics) had no effective computer links with scientific centres worldwide\n\nThe NICA Project at JINR Dubna\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKekelidze V.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available New scientific program is proposed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR in Dubna aimed at study of hot and dense baryonic matter in the wide energy range from 2 GeV/amu to âsNN = 11 GeV, and investigation of the nucleon spin structure with the maximum polarized protons and deuterons energy in the c.m. 27 GeV (for protons. To implement this program the development of JINRâs accelerator facility in high energy physics has started. This facility is based on the existing superconducting synchrotron - Nuclotron. The program foresees both experiments at beams extracted from the Nuclotron, and construction of an ion collider - the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA.\n\nDubna - A University Town Exhibition Science Bringing Nations Together\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2000-01-01\n\n1994 marked the opening of the Dubna International University of Nature, Society and Man.

This was measured using a beam of longitudinally polarized neutrons and a longitudinally polarized proton target with parallel and antiparallel polarization directions. The polarized neutron beam, from the break-up of polarized deuterons, was accelerated by the Synchrophasotron at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) Laboratory of High Energies, Dubna (Russian Federation). The polarized target, 20 cm long and 3 cm in diameter, provided by DAPNIA (Saclay, France) and Argonne (USA), had also been used in 1989-1990 at Fermilab for the E704 experiment. Equipment from Saclay and Argonne was shipped to Dubna and work started in June 1994. The International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (INTAS) supported the construction and improvement of the target in a suitable transportable form. The target was mounted in the JINR Laboratory of Nuclear Problems (LNP) by experts from DAPNIA (Saclay), JINR Dubna (LNP, LHE and Laboratory of Particle Physics - LPP), Gatchina (Russia), RASMoscow and the Kharkov (Ukraine) laboratories. The Saturne National Laboratory (Saclay), helped with computer programmes for the NMR target polarization measurements. Apparatus was tested in early February. The beam of 2 x 109 polarized deuterons produced 106 polarized neutrons at 3.6 GeV. The neutron beam polarization was about 52%. The new superconducting Nuclotron accelerator should allow the beam intensity to be increased and beam quality improved after an upgrade of the injection system.

Kadyshevsky reported on important recent achievements. The Nuklotron superconducting accelerator has now been completed and is in operation. (A report will feature in a forthcoming edition of the CERN Courier.) The FOBOS multiple event spectrometer mounted in the heavy ion beam of the U-400M cyclotron is designed to record the products of nuclear reactions in the high mass and charge region with high efficiency. New experiments are envisaged. At the IBR research reactor a cryogenic moderator has been put into operation. Physics goals include generation of an impulse flux of cold neutrons. The neutron Fourier high resolution diffractometer was commissioned for polycrystal studies. Meanwhile an imaginative scheme to establish an International University using JINR research facilities and highly qualified personnel is being implemented. New appointments include Alexei Sissakian and Tzvetan Vylov as Vice-Directors, Nikolai Russakovitch as Chief Scientific Secretary, Vladislav Sarentzev as Chief Engineer and Alexandre Lebedev as Administrative Director.

As a counterpart, the JINR Laboratory will produce drift chambers for the new NA62 experiment. This operation is a fruitful exchange of technology that profits both laboratories and enhances their collaboration. Â On 22 July, in the occasion of the departure of the chambers from CERN, Mikhail Itkis (centre), acting Director of the JIINR visited the NA62 experimental area accompanied by Rolf Heuer (left), CERN Director General and Ferdinand Hahn, NA62 technical Co-ordinator. The NA48 drift chambers were overhauled in 2000 and employed until 2008. With a total of 110 kilometres of wire soldered to a very high degree of precision, the four drift chambers were a crucial element of the experimental kaon programme at CERN.

NA48, a Cagliari/Cambridge/CERN/ Dubna/Edinburgh/Ferrara/Mainz/Orsay/Perugia/Pisa/Saclay/Siegen/ Turin/Vienna collaboration, aims to study the small asymmetry in the properties of matter and antimatter known as CP violation, and should be fully ready to collect data next year. Through its links with Dubna's Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR), near Moscow, NA48 has launched a number of initiatives designed to involve Russian physicists and industry in the experiment. The bargain 22 tonnes of krypton for NA48's energy-measuring calorimeter were manufactured at a specially- built factory in Russia. INTAS, the European Union-backed scheme for the promotion of cooperation with former Soviet Union scientists, provides funds for Dubna physicists to visit Western Europe. INTAS will also provide computing and networking infrastructure allowing the Russian physicists to participate fully in NA48's programme. As well as the cryostat, NA48's collaborating institutes have placed other orders with Russian suppliers. INFN Pisa has ordered 14,000 electrical feed-though contacts from the Budker Institute in Novosibirsk, whilst Saclay has placed contracts elsewhere for vacuum and other equipment. The new cryostat forms part of a joint project of INFN Pisa and CERN, involving scientists from Dubna, Edinburgh, and Saclay.

A Laser Measurement System (LMS) proposed and realized in Dubna guarantees a high-precision module assembly. The non-planarity of module size surfaces (1.9x5.6 m) controlled area is well within the required Â±0.6 mm tolerance for each of JINR assembled modules. The module assembly technique achieved with the LMS system allows us to deliver to CERN one module every 2 weeks. This laser-based measurement system could be used in future for the control measurement of other large-scale units during the ATLAS assembly\n\nJINR rapid communications\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe present collection of rapid communications from JINR, Dubna, contains six separate records on test of a threshold aerogel Cherenkov counter on cosmic particles, first results of study of transversal dimension of region of cumulative particles production in d + C and d + Cu reactions for energy 2 GeV/nucleon, the evidence of Ï[0 + (0 ++ 0)] meson at a mass of M Ï + Ï - = 750 Â± 5 MeV/c 2 observed in Ï + Ï - combinations from the reaction np â npÏ + Ï - at an incident momentum of P n (5.20 Â± 0.16 GeV/c, inclusive spectra of protons and Ï - mesons emitted in 4 HeC and 12 CC interactions with total disintegration of nuclei, heavy quark-antiquark pair production by double pomeron exchange in pp and AA collisions on the CMS and global features of nucleus-nucleus collisions in ultrarelativistic domain\n\nCurrent experiments using polarized beams of the JINR LHE accelerator complex\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLehar, F.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe present review is devoted to the spin-dependent experiments carried out or prepared at the JINR LHE Synchrocyclotron. The acceleration of polarized deuterons, and experiments using the internal targets, the beam extraction and the polarimetry are briefly described. Then, representative experiments using either the extracted deuteron beam or secondary beams of polarized nucleons produced by polarized deuterons are treated. Three current experiments: 'DELTA-SIGMA', 'DELTA' and 'pp-SINGLET', require the polarized nucleon beams in conjunction with the Dubna polarized proton target. Already available ÎÏ L (np) results from the first experiment show unexpected energy dependence. Experiment 'DELTA' should investigate the nucleon strangeness. The aim of the third experiment is to study a possible resonant behavior of the spin-singlet pp scattering amplitude. For all other Dubna experiments unpolarized nucleon or nuclei targets are used. The polarized deuteron beam allows determining spin-dependent observable necessary for understanding the deuteron structure, as well as the nucleon substructure. One part of investigations concerns deuteron break-up reactions and deuteron proton backward elastic scattering. A considerable amount of data was obtained in this domain. Another part is dedicated to the measurements of the same spin-dependent observable in a 'cumulative' region. Interesting results were obtained for proton or pion productions in inclusive and semi-inclusive measurements. In the field of inelastic deuteron reactions, the analyzing power measurements were performed in the region covering Roper resonances. Many existing models are in disagreement with observed momentum dependences of different results. Finally, the proton-carbon analyzing power measurements extended the momentum region of rescattering observables. Some inclusive Dubna results are compared to exclusive Saclay data, and to lepton-deuteron measurements.

The straws were glued, the radiator stacks were installed and the PNPI wheel was tested for gas leaks. An initial large leak rate was observed and fixed by increasing somewhat the amount of glue around each straw end-piece and improving the leak-tightness of the testing equipment itself. PNPI will assemble a total of 48 4-plane wheels of type A using two assembly lines. JINR Dubna will assemble a total of 32 4-plane wheels of type B using a single assembly line. The next steps are the gluing of the so-called active webs (printed circuit boards connecting high voltage and signal lines from straw/wire to HV supply and front-end boards), followed by wiring, and will take place in November. PNPI and JINR Dubna should start mass production in February-March next year.

The results of the clinical probation of the methods for the uterus cervix cancer treatment have confirmed the advantage of the proton irradiation. The most important advantage of the proton beam treatment is absence of postradiation reactions and complications in the critical organs (bladder and rectum). Up to now 31 patients with the uterus cervix cancer have been treated at the JINR phasotron. 6 of them had proton-and-gamma treatment combined with surgical operation and 22 patients received a radical proton-and-gamma treatment (without surgery). The clinical results are in good agreement with the preceding results of the ITEP group. After receiving proton-and-gamma radiotherapy of the uterus cervix, 83% of the patients are alive without recurrences, metastases and complications. 10 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs\n\nAnalytical investigations at the IBR-2 reactor in Dubna\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFrontas'eva, M.V.; Pavlov, S.S.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nExperience in applying activation analysis with epithermal neutrons to environmental studies at the IBR-2 pulsed fast reactor in Dubna is reviewed. The principal units of the pneumatic system REGATA are described as well as the main present-day parameters of the irradiation channels. Examples from two challenging areas: analysis of airborne particulate matter and analysis of the biomonitors of atmospheric deposition, where the feasibility of ENAA related to non-nuclear multi-element techniques has been shown, are given. ENAA is presently being used in several projects carried out at FLNP JINR that involve the analysis of aerosol filters. For these studies, instrumental neutron activation analysis cannot feasibly be replaced by any non-nuclear analytical technique at the present state of art due to the fact that the total mass of the aerosol collected on filter samples is often rather small. This favours direct instrumental techniques rather than those depending on dissolving the sample prior to analysis. The dominant part of air pollution studies at FLNP JINR is based on the use of the moss biomonitoring technique resulting in a final product-maps of the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals, rare-earths, actinides (U and Th), etc., constructed by the GIS (geographical information system) technology\n\nCross-section studies of relativistic deuteron reactions obtained by activation method\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nWagner, V; Svoboda, O; VrzalovÃ¡, J; Majerle, M; KrÃ¡sa, A; Chudoba, P; Honusek, M; Kugler, A; Adam, J; Baldin, A; Furman, W; Kadykov, M; Khushvaktov, J; Sol-nyskhin, A; Tsoupko-Sitnikov, V; ZÃ¡vorka, L; Tyutyunnikov, S; Vladimirova, N\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe cross-sections of relativistic deuteron reactions on natural copper were studied in detail by means of activation method. The copper foils were irradiated during experiments with the big Quinta uranium target at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. The deuteron beams with energies ranging from 1 GeV up to 8 GeV were produced by JINR Nuclotron. Residual nuclides were identified by the gamma spectrometry. Lack of such experimental cross-section values prevents the usage of copper foils from beam integral monitoring.\n\nUpdating and test on 12 kA HTSCL for Russia JINR\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhou, Tingzhi; Ding, K; Liu, C; Xu, C; Feng, H; Wu, H; Liu, X; Song, Y\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) started manufacture and test of superconducting magnets for the new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA).

New radiation sources providing better distribution of the radiation doses in a patient's body are shown to increase the efficiency of the radiation therapy. Grounds for using heavy nuclear particles to treat malignant tumours and the first clinical tests of these particles at some physics research centres in different countries of the world are considered. A many-room complex of radiation treatment with JINR phasotron beams at the Laboratory of Nuclear Problems is described. The first results of treating cancer patients with proton beams in this complex are given. The prospects for radiation therapy and diagnosis with heavy nuclear beams from other basic facilities of JINR are presented. The necessity of building a radiological hospital and a regional treatment and diagnosis centre in Dubna is discussed, which will allow the fastest and most efficient application of new nuclear physics techniques and designs to medicine. 68 refs., 17 figs., 6 tabs\n\nStatus of the NICA project at JINR\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKekelidze Vladimir\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility project is now under active realization at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR, Dubna. The main goal of the project is a study of hot and dense strongly interacting matter in heavy-ion (up to Au collisions at the center-of-mass energies up to 11 GeV per nucleon. Two modes of operation are foreseen, collider mode and extracted beams, with two detectors: MPD and BM@N. The both experiments are in preparation stage. An average luminosity in the collider mode is expected to be 1027 cmâ2 sâ1 for Au (79+. Extracted beams of various nuclei with maximum momenta of 13 GeV/c (for protons will be available. A study of spin physics with extracted and colliding beams of polarized deuterons and protons at energies up to 27 GeV (for protons is foreseen with the NICA facility.

Nobody knew of him until 4 March 1955, when he gave a press conference in Moscow at the Academy of Sciences where he explained the motivations that had led him to decide to live in Russia. He arrived in Moscow in September 1950 and at the end of October of the same year he moved in Dubna and started his research work at the Institute of Nuclear Problems where, at the time, the most powerful particle accelerator in the world was in operation. A historical reconstruction of the early years of his scientific activity is done through the pages of his first logbook. This âlaboratory notebookâ, dated November 1, 1950, contains unpublished notes, ideas and considerations that Bruno wrote by hand, mostly in English, at the beginning of his work in Russia.\n\nInvenio @ JINR\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN.

They involve physicists, biologists and chemists from the scientific centres of the JINR Member States and other countries. Major contributions are made by the physicists from Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. During a visit to Dubna, Niels Bohr took an interest in a simple idea behind the periodic pulsed reactor and said: \"I admire the courage of the people who ventured to build such a remarkable facility!\"\n\nTransmutation studies using SSNTD and radiochemistry and the associated production of secondary neutrons\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBrandt, R; Wan, J S; Schmidt, T; Langrock, E J; Vater, P; Adam, J; Bamblevski, V P; Bradnova, V; Gelovani, L K; Kalinnikov, V K; Krivopustov, M I; Kulakov, B A; Sosnin, A N; Perelygin, V P; Pronskikh, V S; Stegailov, V I; Tsoupko-Sitnikov, V M; Modolo, G; Odoj, R; Philippen, P W; Adloff, J C; Pape, F; Debeauvais, M; Zamani-Valassiadou, M; Hashemi-Nezhad, S R; Dwivedi, K K; Guo Shi Lun; Li, L; Wang, Y L; Wilson, B\n\n1999-01-01\n\nExperiments using 1.5 GeV, 3.7 GeV and 7.4 GeV protons from the Synchrophasotron, LHE, JINR, Dubna, Russia, on extended Pb- and U- targets were carried out using SSNTD and radiochemical sensors for the study of secondary neutron $9 fluences. We also carried out first transmutation studies on the long-lived radwaste nuclei /sup 129/I and /sup 237/Np. In addition, we carried out computer code simulation studies on these systems using LAHET and DCM/CEM codes. We $9 have difficulties to understand rather large transmutation rates observed experimentally when they are compared with computer simulations.

A.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nOn 26 March 2016, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) will mark its 60th anniversary as an internationally known research center that is a unique example of how fundamental theoretical and experimental studies can be integrated with the development and application of cutting-edge technologies and with university education. JINR member states number 18, of which Hungary, Germany, Egypt, Italy, Serbia, and the Republic of South Africa are each under a government-level cooperation agreement with the institute. Three factors combine to form a solid foundation on which JINR bases its work: commitment to traditions of internationally renowned research schools; unique performance hardware capable of solving problems of current interest in various fields of modern physics; and status as a UN intergovernmental body. Ranked high within the world's scientific community, the institute has conducted a wide range of research and trained high quality research personnel for its member states over the 60-years period since its foundation. In accordance with its Charter, JINR is open to participation by all interested states and ensures equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among them.\n\nExperience gained during 10 years transmutation experiments in Dubna\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZamani, M.; Fragopoulou, M.; Manolopoulou, M.; Stoulos, S.; Brandt, R.; Westmeier, W.; Krivopustov, M.; Sosnin, A.; Golovatyuk, S.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nTransmutation, the procedure of transforming long-lived radioactive isotopes into stable or short-lived, was proposed for reducing the amount of radioactive waste resulting from technological applications of nuclear fission. The Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) provide the possibility to generate intense neutron spectrum yielding in an effective transmutation of unwanted isotopes. Such experiments are being carried out for the last 10 years in Synchrophasotron / Nuclotron accelerators at the Veksler-Baldin Laboratory of High Energies of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Thick Pb and Pb-U targets, surrounded by moderators, have been irradiated by protons in the energy range of 0.5-7.4 GeV. Neutron fluence measurements have been performed by different techniques of passive detectors (neutron activation detectors, solid state nuclear track detectors). Transmutation of 129I, 237Np, 239Pu was studied. The results of these experiments are presented and discussed.\n\nDoing More Together Exhibition Science Bringing Nations Together\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe first international symposium on \"LHC Physics and Detectors\" was held in Dubna in 1996.

Since the summer of 1995, a systematic sampling of bio-indicators has been carried out. The bio-indicators are represented by three species of bryophytes with an endemic development in the Romanian area: Hylocomium splendens, Hypnum cupresiforme and Pleurozium schreberi. A large area of 45,000 km 2 , including the Carpathian Arch between the Olt River Gorge (Southern Carpathian Mountains) and the northern Romanian border (Eastern Carpathian Mountains) was covered. Some of the samples were prepared in the laboratory and analyzed by nuclear analysis methods of a high sensitivity and accuracy i.e., neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectrometry. Other samples are to be prepared and analyzed. The results will be shown as distribution maps for heavy metal concentrations in the studied area. The analysis were carried out at NIPNE-HH-Bucharest, JINR-Dubna and Trondheim University. Part of the results have already been included in the European Atlas of the Heavy Metal Atmospheric Depositions, published by the Northern Countries Council. The distribution maps of atmospheric depositions in Romania will also be included in the above mentioned Atlas.

The main aim of the study is evaluation of the applicability of the welding technique for CT specimensâ reconstitution. Thus, the temperature distribution during electron beam welding of a CT specimen was calculated using Greenâs functions and the residual stress distribution was determined experimentally using neutron diffraction. Time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments were performed on a Fourier stress diffractometer at the IBR-2 fast pulsed reactor in FLNP JINR (Dubna, Russia). The neutron diffraction data estimates yielded a maximal stress level of Â±180 MPa in the welded joint.\n\nUser guide to JINR server of scientific publications JDS\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFilozova, I.A.; Zaikina, T.N.; Musul'manbekov, Zh.Zh.; Semenov, R.N.; Shestakova, G.V.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the framework of the international program OAI (Open Access Initiative) the digital open access archive-repository JINR Document Server (JDS) is built up.

The main goal of NICA is to collide heavy ion nuclei to study the properties of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at high baryon density. In this accelerator complex, two big particle detectors are planned to be installed: Spin Physics Detector (SPD) and Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD). At the design luminosity, the event rate in the MPD interaction region is about 6 kHz; the total charged particle multiplicity would exceeds 1000 in the most central Au+Au collisions at \\\\sqrt{{sNN}} = 11 {{GeV}}. Since the middle of 2016 a group of researchers and students from Mexican institutions was formed (MEXnICA).

The measured cross sections are the following: Ï( 107m Ag) 204 Â± 18 mb, Ï( 109m Ag) = 262 Â± 26 mb. These values are essentially lower than the excitation cross section of the 103m Rh isomer. The analysis of the data on level structures and transitions between these levels for rhodium and silver nuclei together with the data on Î³-spectra created in the reactions (n, n ' Î³) shows that the essential difference between excitation cross sections of Rh and Ag isomers can be explained by different populations of corresponding levels\n\nA history of the collaboration between the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), and with Soviet research institutes in the USSR 1955-1970\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLock, W.O.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe report describes in some detail the origins and development up to 1970 of the collaboration which now exists between the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and its counterpart the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) at Dubna, USSR and also with the Institute for High Energy Physics, Serpukhov, USSR. Part 1 deals with the relations between JINR and CERN, their beginnings and the subsequent development of exchange of scientists, joint Summer Schools, and the organization of Seminars to discuss perspectives in high energy physics. Part 2 describes first the steps which led up to the signing of an Agreement between CERN and the State Committee of the USSR for the Utilization of Atomic Energy, governing collaboration between CERN and the Institute for High Energy Physics at Serpukhov. A brief account is then given of the subsequent installation of equipment built at CERN for the Institute's 76-Gev proton accelerator and the carrying out of joint physics experiments by teams from Western Europe and from the Soviet Union. Part 3 summarizes the origins of collaborative agreements which have been made by CERN with a few other leading Institutes in the Soviet Union. A number of Annexes reproduce some of the relevant documents and letters.

In total, the ATLAS feet system will carry approximately 6000 tons, and will give the same inclination to the detector as the LHC accelerator. The installation of the feet is scheduled to finish during January 2004 with an installation precision at the 1 mm level despite their height of 5.3 metres. The manufacture was carried out in Russia (Company Izhorskiye Zavody in St. Petersburg), as part of a Russian and JINR Dubna in-kind contribution to ATLAS. Involved in the installation is a team from IHEP-Protvino (Russia), the ATLAS technical co-ordination team at CERN, and the CERN survey team. In all, about 15 people are involved. After the feet are in place, the barrel toroid magnet and the barrel calorimeters will be installed. This will keep the ATLAS team busy for the entire year 2004.\n\nCMS Experiment Data Processing at RDMS CMS Tier 2 Centers\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGavrilov, V; Korenkov, V; Tikhonenko, E; Shmatov, S; Zhiltsov, V; Ilyin, V; Kodolova, O; Levchuk, L\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRussia and Dubna Member States (RDMS) CMS collaboration was founded in the year 1994 [1]. The RDMS CMS takes an active part in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration [2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3] at CERN [4]. RDMS CMS Collaboration joins more than twenty institutes from Russia and Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) member states. RDMS scientists, engineers and technicians were actively participating in design, construction and commissioning of all CMS sub-detectors in forward regions. RDMS CMS physics program has been developed taking into account the essential role of these sub-detectors for the corresponding physical channels. RDMS scientists made large contribution for preparation of study QCD, Electroweak, Exotics, Heavy Ion and other physics at CMS. The overview of RDMS CMS physics tasks and RDMS CMS computing activities are presented in [5-11]. RDMS CMS computing support should satisfy the LHC data processing and analysis requirements at the running phase of the CMS experime...\n\nJINR rapid communications.

P.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe cross sections for the excitation of long-lived isomers of 107,109 Ag nuclei are measured in the inelastic scattering of fast neutrons from the IBR-2 reactor of JINR (Dubna). The measurements are performed by means of comparison with the yield of the 103m Rh isomer, for which the excitation cross sections are known over a wide energy range for similar reactions induced by monochromatic neutrons. The measured cross sections proved to be Ï( 107m Ag)=204Â±18 mb and Ï( 109m Ag)=262Â±26 mb. These values are significantly smaller than the cross section for the excitation of the 103m Rh isomer. An analysis employing information about the arrangement of energy levels in Rh and Ag and about transitions between these levels, as well as data on the spectra of Î³ rays emitted in (n,n'Î³) reactions, reveals that the distinction between the cross sections for the excitation of Rh and Ag isomers can be explained by the difference in the population of corresponding levels of Rh and Ag nuclei\n\nThe status of computing and means of local an"
