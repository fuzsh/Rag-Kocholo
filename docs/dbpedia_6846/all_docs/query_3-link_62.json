        "text": "Ekaterina Floria is taking part in Swan Lake\n\nSwan Lake is coming to York today and it features a ballet dancer from Ukraine.\n\nEkaterina Floria has been talking about the challenges she has been facing in the last six months.\n\nShe was born in Mariupol. After successfully graduating from the Vadim Pisarev's Ballet Academy in 2003, she was accepted right away to the Donbass Ballet Theatre. Thanks to her great dedication and talent, she danced her way up to and became the principal ballerina at the theatre which gave her the opportunity to tour the whole world. She continued to show success on stage and this was rewarded when she was invited to join the Mariinsky Theatre in 2016 as a soloist where she stayed until recently.\n\nEkaterina had to leave Mariupol to study ballet at the age of 12.\n\nShe said: \"Of course, I am very sad that my hometown became so famous for the wrong reasons in the world. I am feeling very disappointed about all the bad things happening at the moment and very upset that I had to leave my theatre as it was a great place to work at.\n\n\"I'm enjoying the UK alot. I'm enjoying being here and I like the public in theatres and how they react. I really love this country.\n\n\"The situation is like a terrible dream and I think in this situation, our art and our favourite job is the only thing that can bring us to another road and when we're dancing on stage, we can forget about all these things. It's the only way to feel something good.\n\n\"I hope they will like the way I'm dancing and I hope that people will like it. Just enjoy it.\n\n\"We're dancing Swan Lake and as for me, I'm enjoying all the parts because when I was young I liked only the Black Swan but now I'm enjoying the White Swan much more. I hope the audience will enjoy everything.\"\n\nEkaterina’s repertoire includes all major roles in ballet, not to mention: Aurora, Lilac Fairy – Sleeping Beauty, Giselle – Giselle, Sugar Plum Fairy – The Nutcracker, Odette, Odile – Swan Lake, and many more.\n\nSwan Lake\n\nFor the first time in the UK, this ballet company is from Moldova with dancers from many different countries all over the world, including Ukraine.\n\nIt is taking place at York Barbican today (Sunday 23rd October) at 2.30pm and 7.30pm.\n\nFind out more information on the venue's website.\n\nIt is also coming to Harrogate on Tuesday 25th October at 8.30pm at Royal Hall.\n\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Greatest Hits Radio app."
