Unlike most of those kids, Clay grew his initial interest in music into a lifelong passion and career. By age ten, Clay had joined The Arsenal, his first band, and in middle school he rocked with The Odyssey. Clay studied classical guitar in college and traveled the Pacific Northwest performing with a variety of rock groups: Good Question, Pilot, CPR, Rod and Clay, and The Click, to name a few. While Clay enjoyed performing and always knew music would be integral to his life, he had yet to discover his true calling. The demand for Clay’s recording and producing skills, coupled with his love of the work, led him to officially create SoundSmith Studios. SoundSmith has now been in business and thriving for more than 20 years. In that time, the business continued to grow and expand, both in the physical space of the studio and in the variety of services offered. Clay’s deepest joy comes from collaborating with musicians and businesses to help them realize their creative aspirations.\n\nPaula Dreyer\n\nComposer\n\nPaula Dreyer is a classically trained contemporary composer and pianist living in the Pacific Northwest who seeks to inspire, include, and connect individuals through music. She has created her own, unique sound—weaving a wide range of influences from the Romantic and Impressionistic eras, film composers, Spanish music, and solo improvisation albums from the masters. Listeners are transported through her music that is sophisticated yet intimate, melancholic yet hopeful, hauntingly melodic, and rhythmically alive."
