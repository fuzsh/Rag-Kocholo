        "text": "Introduction\n\n1\n\nWhen we in the West think of nineteenth-century Russian literature, we think of the Russian novel, and we associate it with Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Russians, however, are quick to point out that Alexander Pushkin created the Russian novel and that Dostoevsky’s and Tolstoy’s works are an extension of his genius. They regard Pushkin as their greatest writer, their Shakespeare. Why is this so? In order to understand Pushkin’s unique role in the history of Russian culture, we must remember that Russian literature was late to mature. Only in the eighteenth century, in the wake of the reforms of Peter the Great, did a secular literature begin to emerge, and only in the nineteenth century did Russian literature truly come into its own. Pushkin was Russia’s first great writer in the modern tradition. After self-consciously practicing European literary genres for almost one hundred years and groping for a national literary language, Russia suddenly produced a dazzling and sophisticated poet who wrote with complete assurance. It was as if he had simultaneously created and perfected the Russian literary language. He seemed both the creator and the supreme embodiment of Russian literature.\n\nPushkin, however, is more than the creator of modern Russian literature. He is the “beginning of all beginnings,” to quote Gorky. He has such a powerful hold on the Russian imagination because literature means much more to Russians than it does to us in the West. To Russians literature is both an affirmation and an expression of national identity, narodnost’. Moreover, literature is regarded as an embodiment of social and moral truths. Therefore, the writer is viewed as a sacred voice, a prophet, and is revered in a way we in the West find difficult to imagine. The Russians regard Pushkin not only as the first but also as the fullest expression of Russianness in literature. The work of Pushkin’s which best articulates this national quality is Eugene Onegin.\n\nBegun in 1823 and completed in 1831, Eugene Onegin is the most original of all of Pushkin’s writings and the most difficult to characterize. On the one hand, it is a dazzling poetic masterpiece. No other poem of Pushkin’s contains such an abundance of perfect poetry, all the more astonishing because the work is executed in intricate fourteen-line stanzas. On the other hand, Onegin is a novel—the story of love twice rejected set against a broad picture of contemporary Russian life. Its hero and heroine—Onegin, the disillusioned sophisticate, and Tatyana, the appealing, sincere young woman—became the prototypes for many characters in nineteenth-century Russian fiction.\n\nOnegin is an intriguing hybrid. In some ways it resembles the nineteenth-century realistic novel which was to follow it; in other ways it is very different. Pushkin deliberately called attention to the hybrid nature of his work by giving it the subtitle “novel in verse.” In his very first mention of Onegin he emphasized its elusive quality: “As for what I am doing,” he confessed in a letter to a friend, “I am writing, not a novel but a novel in verse—a devil of a difference.”1\n\nThis “devil of a difference” disturbed Pushkin’s contemporaries. They were quick to find fault with Onegin because it did not fit their preconceptions. Since it was full of sparkling play and amusing chatter, they did not regard it as serious poetry nor could they accept it as a novel. They complained about its digressive quality, “improvisatory” nature, and weak plot. Moreover, they saw nothing “Russian” about Onegin. Living in an age dominated by Byron, they were quick to conclude that Pushkin’s work was marred by the influence of the English poet. Their views were summed up by Pushkin’s fellow poet Evgeny Baratynsky:\n\nThe form belongs to Byron, the tone also. Many poetic details are borrowed . . . the characters are pale. Onegin is not well developed, Tatyana lacks distinctive qualities, Lensky is insignificant. The descriptions of locale are beautiful but are only an exercise in purely plastic art. There is nothing here which definitively characterizes our Russian way of life.2\n\nLike many Russians of the period, Baratynsky believed that genuine literature did express national character—that it embodied the inner, as well as the external, life of a people. This view, propounded by the German Romantics, had great appeal to Russians in the 1830s because they, like the Germans before them, relied on literature to aid them in self-definition. Russians, however, believed in the crucial role of literature more intensely than did the Germans because there were few other signs of cultural life in their country. Russia had a repressive censorship. She had no secular philosophical tradition and no tradition of political or social thought. She had not yet made important contributions in the fields of secular art or music. She could look to literature and little else, although Russians suspected that their own literature did not express the national character. They were afraid that the Russian character did not exist, that they lacked an identity of their own, that they had received everything from without and given nothing to the world. They feared that theirs was a country without a history in the Western European sense, and they had a great feeling of inferiority.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve this cultural dilemma Russian intellectuals of the 1840s put forward two opposing sets of views. Some—labeled Slavophiles— insisted that the true national identity had been preserved among the peasants, whose way of life had not been violated by the reforms of Peter the Great, and that Russians could regain a sense of wholeness by returning to the ideals and traditions of the people. Others—called Westernizers—argued that the reforms of Peter the Great had awakened Russia from her lethargy and that in order to come fully into her own Russia must continue to learn from the West and follow the European pattern of development.3\n\nThe chief spokesman for the Westernizers was Vissarion Belinsky, who played a more important role in Russia’s cultural history than has any other critic and who has no real counterpart in Western criticism.4 Belinsky was an ardent polemicist, and in a sense his 1844 essay in the present collection is a polemic against the Slavophiles. At the same time it reveals his ability to transcend the controversies of his day and to perceive what was actually happening in and to Russia.\n\nBelinsky had an acute sense of history. He realized that profound changes had occurred in Russia during his own lifetime. (He was born in 1811, on the eve of the Great Patriotic War of 1812.) Belinsky possessed, as it were, a double vision. He was able simultaneously to see what had happened and to relive it, to outline the broad contours of Russia’s cultural development and to bring events alive and give them a sense of immediacy. His excellence as a critic stemmed from his finely tuned historical sense, his remarkable judgment, and his forceful and impassioned manner of writing. Belinsky realized that in his own time modern Russian society had come into being and modern Russian literature had been born. Aware that he had been present at the genesis of modern Russian culture, he simultaneously traced this process, recreated it, and celebrated it.\n\nBelinsky recognized that Pushkin’s novel in verse, which he termed an “encyclopedia of Russian life,” had played a crucial role in the development of national self-awareness, that it both affirmed the existence of Russian culture and the Russian character and embodied them. Onegin was testimony to the fact that the Russian consciousness had awakened; at the same time, the work was an act of consciousness itself Belinsky saw Onegin as the center which made everything cohere. Thanks to Onegin, Russia had a past and was moving, organically, toward the future. Onegin was an affirmation that Russia had entered universal history and, simultaneously, had her own unique history. It was also evidence of the rapidity with which Russia was changing, proof that the pace of her cultural development was radically different from that of the West. Time, Belinsky observed, was compressed in Russia: “Five years for her is almost a century.”5\n\nBelinsky grasped, as no one else had, the unique cultural significance of Eugene Onegin. He dramatized its meaning more compellingly than has any other critic. At one stroke, he elevated Pushkin’s work to the status of a national epic and forged a link between Onegin and Russia’s identity. Thus the centrality of Pushkin’s novel in verse for the national life was quickly established. What would probably have been a gradual process in other European countries happened overnight in Russia.\n\nBelinsky devoted considerable attention to the major characters, discussing them as if they were real people.6 Ardently defending Pushkin’s hero, he blamed the age in which Onegin lived for his egotism and inactivity. He treated Onegin’s dilemma as if it mirrored the dilemma of Belinsky’s own generation, many of whom felt their talents stifled by the repressive regime of Nicholas I. Moreover, Belinsky interpreted the similarity between Pushkin’s hero and Pechorin, the hero of Mikhail Lermontov’s novel, Hero of Our Time, as evidence that this dilemma was an ongoing problem in Russian society. Indeed, the degree to which Russians would read their own social and spiritual history in the lives of their literary heroes became one of the most striking features of nineteenth-century Russian criticism. The Onegin-type hero was labeled the “superfluous man,” and both his progeny and his genealogy were traced by later critics. The first to emphasize the social significance of literary heroes like Onegin, Belinsky defined the malady of the superfluous man and introduced the notion of a recurring social type.\n\nToday, Belinsky is regarded as the father of social criticism, which became the dominant approach to literature in Russia in the nineteenth century and was enshrined as the official creed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. However, Belinsky was strongly influenced by German Romanticism and never abandoned its basic doctrines, even though he modified his views toward the end of his life. Like the German Romantics, Belinsky conceived of society as a spiritual entity, the embodiment of consciousness, and he believed that genuine literature—i.e., literature that is truly national—was an expression of that consciousness. Increasingly, however, Belinsky also came to identify society with empirical reality, to regard literature as society’s mirror, and to assume that literature evolved along with society.7 The tension between these two impulses is evident again and again in the articles on Onegin. It helps to explain inconsistencies: why, for example, Belinsky in one breath referred to Onegin as a poem and in the next as a novel, why he insisted that the characters were typical and then argued that they were extraordinary beings. Belinsky was neither troubled nor impeded by the contradictions inherent in his views. Those who followed him, however, were much more rigid. In the next generation a conflict arose between critics of the Left and of the Right, each claiming to be Belinsky’s true heirs. Actually, Belinsky fathered two traditions yet remained distinct from both of them.\n\nDmitry Pisarev’s 1865 essay on Eugene Onegin demonstrates how different from Belinsky’s were the attitudes and sensibility of the radical sons. Pisarev, the most talented and outspoken of the “new men,”8 was a passionate utilitarian and had little respect or sympathy for culture. (In a heated moment he once said that a pair of boots was of more value than all the plays of Shakespeare.) Pisarev tolerated literature that was critical of existing social conditions and educated the reader to fight against the existing order, but he had little feeling for art as such and did not hold its great practitioners in high esteem.\n\nUnlike Belinsky, Pisarev had nothing but contempt for Pushkin and Eugene Onegin. He accused Pushkin of turning his back on social issues, of failing to portray Russian reality as it really was, of sweeping the “dirt of real life” under the rug and chattering away about inconsequential matters like restaurants, balls, and the little feet of ladies. (In an effort to demonstrate the inanity of Eugene Onegin, Pisarev twisted quotations, deliberately destroying Pushkin’s rhythm and rhyme.) Pisarev strongly disapproved of the exuberance of Pushkin’s novel in verse. He insisted that the tone of Onegin was misleading, that Pushkin duped his reader into believing he lived in Arcadia, that far from being an encyclopedia of Russian life, Eugene Onegin was nothing more than an apotheosis of the status quo.\n\nPisarev hungered for a new kind of hero—a man of action who would shape the future and serve as a model for others to follow. He insisted that Onegin, like Pushkin himself, was shallow and spineless. Whereas Belinsky blamed Onegin’s inactivity on the age in which he lived, Pisarev argued that the times were the inevitable cumulative result of such men as Onegin.\n\nPisarev considered Pushkin’s novel in verse to be the epitome of a superfluous culture deserving of repudiation. Yet we should not completely dismiss his interpretation of Onegin. Pisarev raised important questions about the nature of Pushkin’s hero. Although he was blind to the ironic distance created by Pushkin and persisted in identifying the poet with his flawed protagonist, he surely was right to question the authenticity of Onegin’s ennui. Moreover, he pointed to a significant peculiarity in the language of Eugene Onegin: Pushkin’s use of “elastic”—i.e., ambiguous—words, which the reader should be wary of accepting at face value.\n\nPisarev’s radical views were opposed by a group of conservative critics who called themselves pochvenniki, “men of the soil.”9 The pochvenniki were intensely nationalistic, and their understanding of nationhood was tinged with mysticism. They believed in the powers of intuition rather than reason, religiosity rather than science. They valued organic growth, man’s connections with history and tradition. They revered things Russian and felt an antipathy to Europe, Catholicism, and socialism. They sought a renewed sense of wholeness, a reaffirmation of national principles, a return to the soil. The mentor of the pochvenniki was Apollon Grigoriev, a gifted critic who considered himself a follower of Belinsky.10 The most outspoken member of the group was Grigoriev’s disciple Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was Dostoevsky who led the counterattack against the radicals, polemicizing heatedly with them both in his journalistic writings and in such works of fiction as Notes from Underground and The Possessed.\n\nThe conservative critics regarded art as the highest of human achievements. They held that the artist possessed prophetic powers as well as a special intuitive, synthetic understanding of life and of truth. They stressed the artist’s organic connection to his native soil, which permitted him to grasp and represent different facets of the national psyche and to delineate truly national types. In their eyes the consummate artist was Pushkin.\n\nThe pochvenniki made a cult of Pushkin, but their adoring voices were drowned out by the tumult of the 1860s. By 1880, however, the mood of the country had changed. There was a resurgence of nationalism in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War. At last the conservative critics saw their position vindicated and Pushkin enshrined. The occasion was the erection of a monument to the poet in Moscow (it still occupies a central place in the nation’s capital); the most celebrated speech at the dedication ceremony was delivered by Dostoevsky.\n\nDostoevsky’s “Pushkin Speech” is actually a speech about Russia—her spiritual identity and her destiny. It is important for two reasons: it reveals with striking clarity Dostoevsky’s view of his native land and his vision of her future, and it demonstrates that for Dostoevsky these matters were inextricably bound up with Pushkin and Eugene Onegin. To talk about them was to talk about Russia; to make extraordinary claims for Pushkin the poet was to make extraordinary claims for Russia. Dostoevsky insisted that Pushkin was an unprecedented phenomenon in world literature and that his greatness was a sign of Russia’s future greatness; his unique ability to reincarnate himself in the spirit of other nations was a foretoken of Russia’s messianic mission.\n\nDostoevsky invoked Pushkin to vindicate Russia and the Russian spirit, and he invoked Eugene Onegin to explain the Russian psyche. As a pochvennik, Dostoevsky believed that the Russian character had been split in two as a result of the reforms of Peter the Great and that Russia, Janus-like, had one face turned outward toward the West and the other turned inward toward the people. (The former he viewed as a sign of disease, the latter as an indication of health.) Dostoevsky insisted that Pushkin’s hero and heroine incarnated the two sides of the Russian character. He portrayed Onegin as the negative type, the Westernized intellectual who had lost contact with the people and wandered about aimlessly, seeking salvation in Europe and in socialism. Tatyana became the positive type, close to the people, their traditions, and their religious beliefs. Dostoevsky stressed the opposition between the two characters—that Onegin was an abstract reasoner, while Tatyana instinctively knew the truth and was faithful to it; that Onegin came from Petersburg, the cosmopolitan city built by Peter the Great, while Tatyana came from the country; that Onegin was uprooted, like a blade of grass carried hither and yon by the wind, while Tatyana was firmly rooted in her native soil. Dostoevsky argued that Tatyana’s rejection of Onegin and her pledge of conjugal fidelity proved that she was morally superior to Onegin in the same way that Russia was morally superior to the West.\n\nThe “Pushkin Speech” deified the poet, treated Eugene Onegin as scripture, and strangely transformed Pushkin’s characters. Tatyana was elevated to sainthood, Onegin was recast as a restless intellectual (much like the heroes in Dostoevsky’s own novels), and Tatyana’s husband was brought to life, por trayed as an honest old man who dearly loved his wife (thereby acquiring a psychological presence never granted him by Pushkin, who deliberately left him undeveloped).11\n\n2\n\nIn the 1920s the Russian Formalists radically reinterpreted Pushkin by shifting attention from content to form. A seminal critical movement, Russian Formalism left an impressive legacy whose impact on criticism—both in the Soviet Union and in the West—is still felt today.12 Among its founders was the linguist Roman Jakobson, who later became one of the main creators of Structuralism.\n\nFormalism was part of the broader modernist trend which emerged in Russia, as in other parts of Europe, just before World War I. It was closely allied with the Russian avant-garde movements in literature and art—Futurism and Constructivism—and shared their enthusiasm for technology and innovation, their desire to break with tradition, and their taste for nonobjective, stylized art. Formalism was a reaction against social criticism, on the one hand, and philosophical criticism on the other. The Formalists insisted that art does not reproduce reality. Art, they argued, is not a reflection of society or a battleground for ideas. Rather it is both artful and artificial—invented and shaped through the deliberate manipulation of materials.\n\nThe Formalists disregarded extraliterary factors and turned their attention solely to the work of literature itself.13 What interested them was literaturnost’ [literariness], i.e., that which distinguishes literary works from other uses of the word. In an attempt to discover the specific properties of literary art, they focused on technique, on the “devices” employed.14 They sought to discover how literary works are constructed or put together.15 Their overriding concern was with language as the medium of literature. They assumed that literary speech is different from practical speech, autonomous rather than subordinate to objective reality, sign-oriented rather than referential. They were particularly interested in poetic language, since poetry enables one to experience speech in its totality.\n\nThe Formalists sought to redefine the study of literature radically and make it a science. They were not interested in traditional critical concerns: plot, characters, and ideas; nor were they committed to the traditional task of the critic: making value judgments. They regarded literature as a construct, analogous to a clock, and they wanted to take it apart and determine what makes it tick. At the same time they sought to challenge readers’ perceptions, to make them see literary works in a new light by restoring the orientation toward form.\n\nAs a school of thought, Russian Formalism was far from unified, and there were marked differences among its members. This state of affairs is illustrated by the two Formalist essays on Eugene Onegin. The first, Viktor Shklovsky’s “Pushkin and Sterne: Eugene Onegin,” has been available in translation since 197516 and is not included in this collection; the second, Yury Tynyanov’s “On the Composition of Eugene Onegin,” is translated here for the first time.\n\nThe enfant terrible of the Formalist movement, Viktor Shklovsky was an initiator, a gadfly, the creator of slogans, and the brash promoter of Formalism.17 In his article he boldly challenged traditional views of Onegin. He dismissed the characters and the plot, disavowed the work’s social significance, and focused on the playfulness of Pushkin’s novel in verse, the ways in which Pushkin deliberately flaunted his craft. Shklovsky insisted that Eugene Onegin bore a close resemblance to Tristram Shandy, that, like Sterne’s work, it was highly form-conscious and parodied the techniques and conventions of the novel.18 He pointed out that Pushkin mocks conventional narrative schemes by playing with his story: digressing, omitting stanzas, rearranging the time sequence and calling attention to it, deliberately breaking off the narrative at the end; and he argued that this playing with the “story” is in fact the true “plot” of Eugene Onegin.\n\nBy focusing on Pushkin’s form-consciousness, Shklovsky rendered Eugene Onegin “perceptible” again—to use another favorite term of the Formalists. Yet he overstated the case, ignoring the fundamental differences between Onegin and Tristram Shandy (Tristram Shandy was Shklovsky’s favorite novel and the one he deemed “most typical”). Moreover, he assumed that the work of literature is the sum total of devices employed in it, and he mechanically juxtaposed the parodistic devices used in Pushkin’s novel in verse to similar devices found in Sterne.\n\nYury Tynyanov was a very different kind of critic: a systematic thinker, brilliant theoretician, and astute literary historian. From the very beginning of his career he had a dynamic conception of literature and the literary process. He conceived of the literary work as a hierarchical system in which one group of elements “dominates” and “deforms”—i.e., alters the nature of—all other elements. Thus, when Tynyanov used the term “composition,” he had in mind the dynamic integration of elements and not their static and symmetrical arrangement. His notion of the aesthetic structure as a dynamic system anticipated the Czech Structuralists.19\n\nIn his article on Onegin, Tynyanov addressed one of the fundamental questions of literary theory: What is it that distinguishes poetry from prose? He took an approach to this problem that was characteristic of mature Formalism. He did not assume an inherent difference between the two, as many critics have done. Rather he argued that the difference hinges on function—that in poetry rhythm (in the broad sense encompassing all perceptible phonic phenomena) is dominant, while in prose the semantic aspect is dominant. Tynyanov recognized that poetry and prose are closed categories or systems, yet he did not insist that they are mutually exclusive. He realized that the systems overlap, that they enrich and cross-fertilize each other, and he substantiated this argument with the example of Eugene Onegin. Pushkin’s work provided rich material because it is a borderline case, poised between poetry and prose, where there is maximum tension between the two systems.\n\nTynyanov stressed the differences between the novel in verse and the novel in prose, pointing out that in Eugene Onegin, meaning—the characters, the story, even the digressions—is deformed by the verse. (As if rebutting Shklovsky’s argument, Tynyanov observed that Tristram Shandy and Onegin are very different kinds of works precisely because of their systemic differences.) At the same time Tynyanov demonstrated how verse itself is exploited in Eugene Onegin to make the “novel” more perceptible. By “novel” Tynyanov meant: (1) novel as a literary genre with a defined tradition and (2) novel as an embodiment of the colloquial intonations of everyday speech. The latter concept particularly interested him, and he subjected it to rigorous analysis.\n\nAt the end of the 1920s Russian Formalism was suppressed in the Soviet Union. The official criticism that dominated the next three decades was not really Marxist (the Marxist school too came under attack at the end of the 1920s) but a more “neutral” form of sociological criticism. It evaded the issue of class origin and was actually reminiscent of nineteenth-century social criticism. Therefore, it is not represented in the present collection.20\n\nThe 1950s brought a change in intellectual climate in the Soviet Union. As has often been the case in Russian history, one cause of the change was political—the death of Stalin; another was technological—the advent of cybernetics. The “thaw” that followed Stalin’s demise prompted renewed interest in the culture of the 1920s—in the contributions of writers and artists and in the critical studies of the Russian Formalists and, by extension, the Czech Structuralists, since the two schools overlapped. The coming of the computer age, by contrast, sparked an interest in machine translation, in semiotics, and in structural linguistics. Out of this complex interplay of factors emerged Soviet Structuralism, which flourished in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nYury Lotman, a professor at Tartu University in Estonia, quickly became one of the leaders of the movement, although he was not involved in the group’s activities before 1964. Because of his abundant energy and productivity, Tartu became a major locus of Structuralist activities in the mid-1960s, achieving international prominence. Lotman is well known in the West. Many of his articles and three of his books have been translated into English.21 A specialist in Russian literature, Lotman has written widely on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Russian culture. By examining his two articles on Eugene Onegin in the present collection, we can trace his development from a Structuralist stage into a new phase, perhaps best termed the “semiotics of culture.”\n\nLotman’s 1966 article, “The Structure of Eugene Onegin,” was one of his early Structuralist pieces. In it Lotman called attention to the fact that he had ceased to practice sociological criticism and stressed his links with the Russian Formalists—Shklovsky, Tynyanov, Boris Eikhenbaum, and Grigory Vinokur—and with Mikhail Bakhtin. Criticizing the work of his teacher, Grigory Gukovsky, and his own earlier work on Eugene Onegin, Lotman emphasized that the purpose of this article was to determine what makes Onegin cohere as a structural whole. In an attempt to answer this question, Lotman set out to analyze the internal structure of Pushkin’s novel in verse on three levels: point of view, intonation, and character. The article represented a search for an appropriate methodological model. Lotman experimented— testing out different ideas on Pushkin’s novel in verse and diagramming the results. Analyzing point of view, Lotman applied Bakhtin’s notion that the text is a series of overlaid utterances.22 Discussing intonation, he drew on the theories of the Russian Formalists. Investigating character, he adopted a Jakobsonian approach, looking at the novel as synchronic sections and reducing the characters to a series of binary oppositions.\n\nLotman’s “The Structure of Eugene Onegin” was a pioneering piece. It signaled a change in the critical climate and was itself instrumental in bringing about that change. Lotman resurrected Formalist techniques in order to apply a Structuralist approach to one of the sacred texts in Russian literature. At the same time he challenged the authority of official criticism by pointing out the limitations of extrinsic approaches to literature. Here, too, Lotman emphasized the semantic energy of art, thereby opening the door for new and diverse readings of Onegin.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s Lotman’s critical orientation began to change. He ceased to view literature as a closed system and came to regard it as an integral part of the larger field of culture. He recognized that literature influences other cultural systems and is in turn influenced by them.\n\nThis recognition of the interrelatedness of cultural series informs Lotman’s 1975 article on Eugene Onegin and the Russian novel. Here, Lotman, examining the tradition generated by Onegin, approached the problem of Onegin’s impact on that tradition, not in terms of mechanistic reproduction, as critics have traditionally done, but as a process of continual transformation caused by the interaction between systems. Lotman stressed that for subsequent writers Onegin was not so much a literary as a cultural fact. He showed the way in which writers like Lermontov and Turgenev, far from duplicating Onegin, adapted elements from it to meet their own needs and how in turn their interpretations of Pushkin’s novel in verse began to influence perceptions of the work itself Onegin, for example, came to be perceived through the prism of Turgenev’s novels, which are characterized by a strong heroine and a weak hero. (Undoubtedly this had an impact on both Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky.)\n\nIn his 1975 article Lotman radically redefined the notion of the “superfluous man,” whose roots he traced back to the Romantic hero, demonstrating that the phenomenon was the result of a complex interaction between “literature” and “life.” He argued that the notion of the superfluous man was later projected onto Pushkin’s hero rather than being characteristic of him and stressed that Eugene Onegin stands outside the novelistic tradition generated by it.\n\nLotman’s evolution may be said to parallel that of the mature Formalists, such as Yury Tynyanov, who became increasingly aware that literature is not a closed field of inquiry but a social construct. Lotman and his fellow semioticians of culture have once again taken up the question of literature’s social role, but their assumptions and methodology are quite different from those of the nineteenth-century social critics.23\n\nThe 1960s witnessed not only the flourishing of Structuralism in the Soviet Union but also the rediscovery of Mikhail Bakhtin, whose seminal study, Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics, was reissued in 1963 by two of his young disciples, Vadim Kozhinov and Sergey Bocharov.24 Following the publication of a major work on Rabelais in 1965,25 Bakhtin came to the attention of Western critics, and soon he was influential in the West as well. His influence has continued to grow as more of his work has become available, and he has come to be regarded as one of the major thinkers of the twentieth century.26\n\nBakhtin began his career in the 1920s during the prime of Russian Formalism. But in many ways his approach was antithetical to that of the Formalists. They concentrated on what might be termed the technical aspects of literature, while he focused on semantics, insisting that language cannot be divorced from meaning but that meaning is itself open-ended since it depends on a variety of contexts. Bakhtin was given to speculation and broad synthesis, the Formalists to systemization and close analysis. Bakhtin conceived of the work of literature as animate, living, and therefore unfinished—hence his preference for organic metaphors; while the early Formalists viewed the literary work as a construct, a finished object—hence their preference for technical metaphors.\n\nBakhtin regarded the novel as a genre unlike all other genres. What made the novel radically different in his view was the fact that it presumes its own highly peculiar relationship to language. According to Bakhtin, the language of other genres is fixed, homogeneous, direct, while the language of the novel is heterogeneous—a living mix of varied and opposing voices. Bakhtin argued that this heterogeneity must be taken into consideration if the novel’s stylistics is to be understood, that it is erroneous to identify one particular style in the novel with its author, for he speaks through all of its languages, simultaneously representing in them and distancing himself from them—criticizing them, arguing with them, ridiculing them. In Bakhtin’s view, the novel is a complex dialogical system of languages with the author serving as the unifying aesthetic center.\n\nBakhtin presented his theory about the way discourse functions in the novel in remarkably concise form in remarks here entitled “Discourse in Eugene Onegin.”27 For Bakhtin, Onegin proved the uniqueness of novelistic discourse, since it is not characterized by a single uniform style, as one finds in Pushkin’s poetry, but by a variety of languages or styles connected to one another through dialogical relationships. Bakhtin pointed out that different parts of Onegin are constructed in different “speech zones” and that each of these major voice zones is associated with one of the novel’s central characters: the Sentimental Romantic poetic style with Lensky, the Byronic style with Onegin, the complex combination of dreamy sentimental Richardsonian language and folk language with Tatyana. Thus, each of these stylistic systems is inseparable from a living being, a character who is its agent, and from his world view. Bakhtin stressed that none of these speech zones can be directly identified with the author Pushkin. He is closer to some languages than to others, yet not one of them, not even that of the lyrical digressions, is completely free of parodically stylized or parodically polemicizing elements. Bakhtin called attention to the fact that Pushkin participates in the novel with almost no direct language of his own. He is present, however, as the organizing center where all these images of language intersect.\n\nIn “Discourse in Eugene Onegin” Bakhtin succeeded in demonstrating, as no other critic has done, the novel-ness of Eugene Onegin. He did this by radically shifting ground, focusing attention on discourse. Incisively characterizing the major speech zones found in Pushkin’s work and revealing their links to the novel’s central characters, he showed that discourse functions in Eugene Onegin as a dialogized system composed of images of languages and consciousnesses that are concrete and inseparable from language.\n\nBakhtin’s disciple Sergey Bocharov, a research fellow at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow, is one of the finest Pushkin scholars in the Soviet Union today. Bocharov was not associated with the Structuralist movement in the Soviet Union; neither can he be called a cultural semiotician. Rather, he is akin to the Phenomenologists—critics like Georges Poulet, Gaston Bachelard, and the early J. Hillis Miller. To some degree he has been influenced by the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. (Bocharov reads French and has been in France.) At the same time his understanding of the novel and in particular of the way discourse functions in the novel has been shaped by Bakhtin, to whom he was close in the 1960s and early 1970s and whose works he has been instrumental in bringing into print.\n\nBocharov has written on Cervantes; he had produced a study of Tolstoy’s War and Peace, which Edward Wasiolek has called remarkable and praised for its originality and perceptiveness;28 and he has written articles on Gogol and on the philosophical poet Evgeny Baratynsky, who was Pushkin’s contemporary. His substantial essay in the present collection is taken from his book on Pushkin’s poetics.29\n\nIn order to understand Bocharov’s interpretation of Eugene Onegin, it is crucial to understand his view of discourse. Like the Phenomenologists, Bocharov believes that language is open to the lived world of experience rather than being an autonomous and closed system of signs, as the Structuralists conceived it to be. For Bocharov, as for the Phenomenologists, style is of overriding importance because it can capture and constitute the fullness of reality, since it is the incarnation of intentional consciousness, the writer’s experience of the world given verbal form.\n\nIn “The Stylistic World of the Novel” Bocharov attempts to show how the fullness of life is constituted, stylistically speaking, in Eugene Onegin. Here the crucial notion for him is “translation,” not in the sense of a literal copy or a deflation (although these meanings enter in as well—particularly with reference to Onegin). Rather, by “translation” Bocharov means the continual switching from one stylistic language to another which pervades Pushkin’s novel in verse. However, since Bocharov assumes that language is a living phenomenon and not a closed system, he does not regard this switching as an automatic mechanism but as a dynamic process in which varied and opposing voices animatedly interact. To characterize this interaction Bocharov uses the musical analogy of counterpoint.30 Broadly speaking, he sees the stylistic interaction in Eugene Onegin as that of two independent voices which sound simultaneously and yet remain distinct, which coalesce and yet retain their active differences. For Bocharov this interaction forms a kind of tension between “poetry,” on the one hand, and “prose,” on the other. With “poetry” is associated the verse tradition, the periphrastic style, the lofty, the ideal, the subjective; with “prose” the bare word, simple language, the plain, the real, the objective. “Poetry” is identified with the young poet Lensky, “prose” with the cynical Onegin. In Bocharov’s view the stylistic world of Pushkin’s work is a dynamic synthesis of these polar opposites. One does not negate the other; rather the two collide, yet come together in the unity of authorial speech."
