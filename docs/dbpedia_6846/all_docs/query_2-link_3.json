        "text": "Review Alert! (Re:) Claiming Ballet Edited by Adesola Akinleye 'This anthology is a valuable tool for engaging new audiences in ballet; it is a call-to-action for younger generations to connect ballet with their lived worlds. It will be of interest to academics, researchers, or students working in the fields of dance, theater, performing arts, and cultural studies‚Äîespecially within the intersection of gender, race, and dance. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to acquire a broader knowledge of ballet as a global art form with the potential to become a key representation of our multicultural society.' - Gonzalo Preciado-Azanza, Journal of Dance Education Available in paperback here üëâ https://lnkd.in/ecAAA_n\n\nMust all lines be straight? In exploring different styles of movement, I discovered the beauty and precision of ballet. Its principle of perfect, straight lines intrigued me, so I tried to blend it with my traditional African dance style. But something felt off. The expressive fluidity that once told my stories so well began to feel constrained. I was sacrificing my originality for a borrowed perception. African dance, rooted in stories and culture, flows freely with the rhythm of our spirits. It tells tales of our heritage with intricate torso movements, bends, and turns that embrace the earth. Despite the allure of straight lines, this rhythm is what makes our dances unique and sought after worldwide. Even ballet dancers strive to replicate the nuanced expressions of African movement. We can admire the beauty of other styles without losing our uniqueness. It‚Äôs a reminder that our tradition is our strength and that originality shines brighter when we stay true to ourselves. Educators and families, this is an important lesson for our young people. You can only be yourself, everyone else is taken. Dance remains a vivid expression of our identity, carrying our legacy through every step. Embrace your rhythm and dance your own story. It‚Äôs what sets you apart. -------------------------------- I invite you to join me on this #journey as we explore the #EssenceOfLearning to #OptimizeHumanPotential. #PhDofLife #AfricanExcellence #DoctorateOfLearning #LearningJourney #LearningToLearn #EducationForAll #LinkedforAll\n\nSuccess requires sacrifices. The exquisite dance of the ballet dancer captivates the audience. Every movement grabs the audience's imagination. Underneath the pointe shoes, a story is conveyed about the wear and tear of long hours of practice to produce a moving masterpiece. People may perceive your accomplishment without realising how hard you worked. Like a ballet dancer, any job you work on may appear effortless. Similar to pointe shoes, it tells the story of long hours of work and sacrifices. People may not see your sacrifices, but keep moving. Do not give up. You will reap the benefits of success, whatever it looks like to you.

Over the weekend I went to see the Coco Chanel Ballet which was a good performance. And Nostalgic to the days I was part of a dance company from high school thru college. Chanel is notoriously known in the #beautyindustry, yet there were key details I learned during the performance. Which I had three business takeaways : 1Ô∏è‚É£How you start may not be how you finish. 2Ô∏è‚É£Be ok to go ‚Äúoutside the lines‚Äù, not always taking the traditional path, there is beauty and lessons along the journey. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stand firm on what matters to you and business. You may be party of 1 or party of many, be consistent and do not waver. BONUS: A ballet does not have any words, the performance depicts the series of actions as part of the story. Sometimes words aren‚Äôt needed because, Actions can speak louder than words! #TheProjectExecutionHER¬ÆÔ∏è #beauty #atlantaballet #businesslessons\n\nCase Study: Royal Expressions Contemporary Ballet Company and School Website Overview: The website for Royal Expressions Contemporary Ballet Company and School is an online platform that serves as a dynamic hub for engaging with parents, guardians, plus ametuer, and professional dancers.

Queens and kings, in a regal ballet, Navigate the chaos in a calculated display. Bishops whisper schemes, knights take their stance, In the cunning ballet, where destinies enhance. Rooks guard secrets with silent might, As pawns move forward, embracing the fight. On the living chessboard, a theater of the mind, Cunning plays its part, the narrative entwined. In the realm of squares, where power contends, Cunning ballet shapes how the story bends. As the game unfolds, and the chessboard imparts, On this battlefield, cunning plays its art."
