B 107, L020407 (2023) – Published 19 January 2023\n\nUnderstanding disorder-induced exotic states in two-dimensional magnets is one of the central topics in the study of frustrated magnetism. Here, the authors focus on the randomness-induced disordered phase in the spin-½ J1−J2 square-lattice Heisenberg model with a strong bond randomness, by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. The results not only reveal the absent spin-glass order, but also identify the power-law decay of the average spin correlation and the exponential decay of the typical spin correlation. These all agree with the corresponding behavior in the one-dimensional random-singlet state and characterize the random-singlet nature of this disordered phase. This shows that DMRG simulations provide opportunities for exploring the disorder effect in two-dimensional magnets.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nLetter\n\nField-induced Kitaev multipolar liquid in spin-orbit coupled d2 honeycomb Mott insulators\n\nAhmed Rayyan, Derek Churchill, and Hae-Young Kee\n\nPhys.

B 107, 024107 (2023) – Published 26 January 2023\n\nPbCrO3 is a perovskite that undergoes a large volume collapse and concurrently an insulator-metal transition with pressure. While one may think that the volume collapse can be associated with conversion of Pb2+ ions to the smaller Pb4+, the spectroscopic measurements in this experiment reveal that the Pb ions remain divalent. Instead, the Cr ions undergo a transition from a charge-disproportionated 2Cr3+/Cr6+ configuration to a homogenous Cr4+ with pressure. Thus, the authors can explain the insulating/metallic nature of PbCrO3 at low/high pressures, respectively.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nElectric polarization reversal and nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in the honeycomb antiferromagnet Fe4Nb2O9 single crystal\n\nJ.

Notably, it is shown that the Ga vacancy can form a favorable three-split configuration, consisting of three Ga vacancies and two Ga interstitials, which enables migration with a dramatically lower migration barrier than previously calculated, further demonstrating the important role of split vacancies in this material.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nSuperconductivity of graphenelike hydrogen in H2He at high pressure\n\nKang Yang, Wenwen Cui, Jian Hao, Jingming Shi, and Yinwei Li\n\nPhys.

Rev. B 107, 024504 (2023) – Published 11 January 2023\n\nPalladium hydride is one of the rare examples of superconducting hydrides at ambient pressure, exhibiting a critical temperature of 10 K in its equilibrium structure, with hydrogen atoms occupying octahedral interstitial sites of the palladium fcc lattice. Making use of ab initio calculations considering quantum anharmonic lattice effects, the authors show here that full or partial occupation of tetrahedral sites is possible in metastable structures, but that their superconducting critical temperature is lower than the equilibrium case with full octahedral occupation.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nSuperconductivity in medium- and high-entropy alloy thin films: Impact of thickness and external pressure\n\nGabriel Pristáš, Július Bačkai, Matúš Orendáč, Slavomír Gabáni, Filip Košuth, Marek Kuzmiak, Pavol Szabó, Emil Gažo, Robert Franz, Sabrina Hirn, Georg C.

MacDonald\n\nPhys. Rev. B 107, 024509 (2023) – Published 26 January 2023\n\nThe microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is currently under active debate. The authors propose here that valuable constraints are implied by the band-filling dependences of the critical temperature and the critical magnetic field, which together define an average Fermi velocity. They show that a robust inverse correlation between the critical temperature and the average Fermi velocity holds in models with band-filling independent pairing interactions. The absence of such an association in experiments suggests that the pairing glue in MATBG is strongly band-filling dependent.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nInterference-induced surface superconductivity: Enhancement by tuning the Debye energy\n\nYunfei Bai, Yajiang Chen, M.

Rev. B 107, 024512 (2023) – Published 31 January 2023\n\nInvestigations show that the physical properties of the layered van der Waals semiconductor GaTe are strongly layer dependent. Here, the authors systematically study its properties by using external pressure as a tuning knob. They first find pressure-induced metallization and superconductivity simultaneously occurring at ~3 GPa, presumably owing to a quasi-two-dimensional to three-dimensional structural crossover and to an electronic phase transition due to a change of the bonding nature between layers from weak van der Waals interaction to strong Coulomb coupling. A second distinct superconducting phase is then observed at ~10 GPa due to a structural transition.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nNonlinear optical responses in noncentrosymmetric superconductors\n\nHiroto Tanaka, Hikaru Watanabe, and Youichi Yanase\n\nPhys.
