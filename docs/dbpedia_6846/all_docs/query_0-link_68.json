        "text": "Alla Kushnir was born in the Ukrainian city of Nikolaev. Now she a well-known choreographer in Kiev, who specifies in Oriental dance, and more precisely, in belly dancing.\n\nAt her pre-school age Alla Kushnir was already assigned to host children’s events. She also started dancing at the early age. Year by year, little by little, Alla was getting ready for big stage and eventually her dream came true.\n\n(alla kushnir – biography – wiki)\n\nStages of the creative development of choreographer and dancer Alla Kushnir\n\nOn June 11, the famous choreographer of Oriental dance will only turn 35, but the list of her victories and awards is already impressive and long. You actually need to work very hard on yourself to achieve such success! It also came thanks to her parents, who noticed their daughter’s numerous talents and sent her to the “Academy of children’s creativity” when she was 12. There the young girl was taught many things that could be useful in the creative future if you wanted to go and study art of dance. At the Academy, along with other gifted children, Alla learned the basics of choreography, made costumes and clothes, and painted. A notable fact is that every year the Academy’s students took part in the Golden stork festival, where Alla received her awards.\n\nIt was a long way before she decided on a specific dance variation. Like everyone else, she started with ballroom dancing, which made it possible to develop grace and a sense of taste. She also tried pop dancing, which helped to develop a sense of rhythm and creativity.\n\nBut, oddly enough, she did not immediately connect her professional life to dance – she had chosen the law academy.\n\nWhen Alla was second year student, she was watching a movie on TV. The main heroines were performing a belly dance, and that fascinated her, gave her desire to learn, to obtain all skills of Oriental dancing. This moment decided her fate and her future!\n\nAt that time, Mykolaiv was not the place where she could find a good teacher of Oriental belly dancing. Alla Kushnir was up to the task. She began to look for opportunities and ways to perfect her Belly dance skills on her own. She went to Russian and Ukrainian cities for various training seminars. She’s got acquainted with many talented and famous performers of Oriental dances. She trained in America, where she also learned the nuances of the art of belly dancing from American masters. Having returned to her native town, Alla Kushnir started her personal dance lessons."
