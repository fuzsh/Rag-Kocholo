I also gravitated toward other young dancers like myself who wanted nothing more in the world than to dance professionally. The combination of the dance educators I thankfully found and the students I trained side by side with (including Denise Cecere) fueled my ambition and drove me to constantly strive for an ever-elusive perfection. It is with this philosophy that I inspire, train and nurture my students.” – Lorraine Chapman\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNathan Duszny is a New Hampshire native that started his professional career at the young age of fifteen.
