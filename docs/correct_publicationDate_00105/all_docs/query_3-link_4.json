        "text": "Praise\n\n“The Left Hand of Darkness surprises me again every time I reread it. There are so many wonderful ideas and stark emotional moments, and Le Guin’s language always startles me with its sheer power and wonder. And every detail in the book has little stories embedded inside it, and these stories keep intersecting and building on each other every time I revisit them—until you start to realize that everything is made of stories. As Genly Ai says on the very first page, ‘Truth is a matter of the imagination.’”\n\n—Charlie Jane Anders, in the afterword to the 50th anniversary edition\n\n“Perhaps it is enough to say that The Left Hand of Darkness is relevant, full stop. That’s what I see as Le Guin’s ultimate triumph with this book—not the impact it had on me, not the impact it had on the genre, not the exquisite prose that sings with every step. It is one thing to write a good story, or a great story. It is a whole other accomplishment, for an author of fiction, to write a true story.”\n\n—Becky Chambers, in the introduction to the Folio Society edition\n\n“This is my sacred scripture. This is what science fiction and fantasy can do. In much the same way that Star Trek shows us what the future can be like if we set aside our differences in pursuit of a common goal, Le Guin’s novel imagines how bridges can be built, chasms crossed. By the end, the book has changed us. Thus, the author not only demonstrates how to build worlds. She shows why we build worlds in the first place.”\n\n—Robert Repino, Tor.com\n\n“Probably one of the most extraordinary examples of soft-core sf is Ursula Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), which reflects the author's formidable background in anthropology as well as her overriding ethical and artistic concerns.”"
