        "text": "Acclaimed science fiction and fantasy writer Ursula K. Le Guin has died, her agent told TheWrap Tuesday. She was 88.\n\nLe Guin died at her home in Portland, Oregon, on Monday. Her son told The New York Times she had been in poor health for months. Her agent had no further statement at this time.\n\nLe Guin has sold millions of copies of her books, which have been translated into 40 languages, many of which have been in print for the better half of a century.\n\nLe Guin brought feminist ideals to the science fiction and fantasy genre, writing more than 20 novels, along with books of poetry, dozens of short stories, collections of essays and children’s books.\n\nPerhaps her most popular book is the “thought experiment” titled “The Left Hand of Darkness,” published in 1969, which takes place on a planet in which people do not have gender but go between genders throughout their lives.\n\n“I eliminated gender to find out what was left,” Le Guin once told The Guardian. The novel won the Hugo and Nebula awards, and is often taught in high school and college.\n\nLe Guin is survived by her husband, son, two daughters, two brothers and four grandchildren."
