Norwalk, CT. Easton Press 1992. Ursula K. Le Guin \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". Limited Collector's Edition from the Masterpieces of Science Fiction series. Beautifully illustrated and luxuriously bound in full genuine leather. Ursula Kroeber Le Guin was born in Berkeley, California, in 1929. She was the bestselling author of the Earthsea books and the Hainish books, including The Left Hand of Darkness, which was awarded both the Nebula and the Hugo Awards. With the awarding of the 1975 Hugo and Nebula Awards to The Dispossessed, she became the first author to win both awards twice for novels. She passed away in 2018. Easton Press 1992 First Edition (not the later 2002 Printing). Full genuine leather. Preface by Joan D. Vinge. Illustrated by Frank Kelly Freas and Laura Brodian Kelly Freas. The Masterpieces of Science Fiction series spans the entire history of the genre and encompasses an extraordinary range of work from Jules Verne and H.G. Wells to Isaac Asimov and Douglas Adams. Easton Press began publishing this series of novels in 1986 with commissioned introductions and artwork. There are now more than 140 volumes in the series. Each publication is bound in embossed leather of various colors with titles in 22kt gold. The pages are made of acid-neutral paper and are gilded on three sides. About the book The Left Hand of Darkness is a science fiction novel by U.S. writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Published in 1969, it became immensely popular, and established Le Guin's status as a major author of science fiction.[6] The novel is set in the fictional Hainish universe as part of the Hainish Cycle, a series of novels and short stories by Le Guin, which she introduced in the 1964 short story \"The Dowry of Angyar\". It was fourth in sequence of writing among the Hainish novels, preceded by City of Illusions, and followed by The Word for World Is Forest. The novel follows the story of Genly Ai, a human native of Terra, who is sent to the planet of Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Ai's mission is to persuade the nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by a lack of understanding of their culture. Individuals on Gethen are ambisexual, with no fixed sex; this has a strong influence on the culture of the planet, and creates a barrier of understanding for Ai. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Fine. First Edition Thus - First Printing. First printing of this edition, with a full number line including a 1. A fine copy, probably gently read, in a fine dust jacket, now in a clear removable protective cover. SIGNED by the author on a bookplate with a pen and ink drawing of a dragon, and inscribed \"for Ben/With all good wishes./Ursula K. Leguin\". After I read this story (not this book), which just blew me away, I wanted to know more about the author so I went to her website, and among other things found out that if I sent her a request, she would send me one (1) signed bookplate, and so I did, on December 9, 2017. The envelope returning a copy of my letter and the signed Dragon bookplate, is postmarked January 18, 2018. Mrs. Le Guin passed away on January 22, four days later. I received the bookplate the next day. I'll send the bookplate, a copy of my letter, and the mailing envelope postmarked in Portland, OR with the book. Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards. Size: 8vo - over 7¾\" - 9¾\" tall. Signed by Author(s). Book.\n\nSigned first UK edition of the famous radical science fiction novel on gender and isolation by one of the most influential writers in the genre - an exceptionally beautiful copy. In this novel, inhabitants of the alien planet \"Winter\" are androgynous, becoming temporarily male or female at periods of fertility. The protagonist is a male visitor from another world, thrown into political machinations that take him on a journey of survival across the ice with a single companion: a native whom he instinctively distrusts. While reckoning with different ways to envision gender, they develop a deep human bond that becomes central to their survival. Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, this UK edition was issued the same year as the US first. One of the great science fiction novels that feels more significant with each passing year. Signed copies are quite scarce. 7.75'' x 5''. Original textured purple paper boards, gilt-stamped spine. In original unclipped (£1.50 / 30s) color pictorial dust jacket. 286 pages. Only a touch of bumping to spine ends. No fading, no marks: crisp and clean. About fine in about fine jacket.\n\n1st UK Edition,13 x 20.4 cm purple boards with silver titles to the spine. 286[2]pp in original unclipped jacket priced at £1.50 and 30s. net. Together with a T.L.S. from Le Guin to Malcolm Edwards the then editor of a Science Fiction Fanzine called Quicksilver, dated 20th April 1971. In it she addresses questions about 'The Left Hand of Darkness' and the first printing of her short story, 'Winter's King' in Orbit 5' (copy included) which she refers to in the letter as \"the genesis of the story\". A clean bright book without name inscription or bookplate and just a tiny Foyles label on the verso of the front free endpaper. There is also little tape burn on the fore edge of the front free endpaper, presumably from a previous jacket cover, but otherwise the pages are very clean. The dust jacket which is now protected in a removable, clear cover (not shown) is in excellent condition with the merest hint of dust marking to the rear panel and a tiny 3mm tear on the top edge of the rear panel with a touch of associated creasing. The Left Hand of Darkness is probably the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction. A major theme of the novel is the effect of sex and gender on culture and society. When the book was first published, the gender theme touched off a feminist debate over its depiction of the ambisexual Gethenians. The book won Le Guin the Nebula Award for the Best Novel in 1969, the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1970, the Otherwise Special Retrospective Award in 1995 and was voted 2nd in the All-time Best SF Novels by a Locus Magazine Poll in 1987 only being beaten by Dune. Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness stands as a landmark achievement in science fiction and Le Guin's signed letter provides significant insight into the origins of the tale. The letter is written to Malcolm Edwards, then the editor of Quicksilver, a Sci-fi fanzine, whist he was still at Kings College Cambridge. Presumably this letter is in reply to research questions regarding the novel Left Hand of Darkness that was to appear in Quicksilver (which Le Guin \"looks forward to\" in the last line) however, there were only two editions of Quicksilver, in 1970 & 1971. It ended abruptly when Edwards took on editorship of the BSFA magazine, Vector, so the Le Guin article did not appear in Quicksilver. Edwards' first issue of Vector, the 59th, was dated Spring '72 and he explains inside that the contents were originally intended for the never to be published third issue of his own fanzine, Quicksilver even here, there is no Left Hand of Darkness article. Malcolm Edwards would go on to become Sci-fi editor at Victor Gollancz in 1976, where Ursula Le Guin would be one of his authors and later Orion and eventually Chair of Gollancz, a true publishing legend. A wonderfully insightful item. Rainford & Parris Books welcomes enquiries, so please do not hesitate to ask if you require further images or have any questions.
