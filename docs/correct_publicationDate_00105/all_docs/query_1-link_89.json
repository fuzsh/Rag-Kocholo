        "text": "I initially put this secondary bibliography together while doing research on a paper about Ursula K. Le Guin’s fantastic novel The Left Hand of Darkness (LHD) for the History of Science Fiction II class at the Mythgard Institute.\n\nI added links to common resources, such as full-text archives like JSTOR, for additional research and later reference. I added notes about how the content applies to where it seemed appropriate.\n\nI started building this list simply by copying citations in the various articles I was reading for my paper. The following resources were invaluable in putting it together:\n\nThe bibliography in Ursula K. Le Guin: A Critical Companion (at least, the parts viewable at Google Books)\n\nInternet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB)\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy Research Database (SFFRD)\n\nThis information is provided “as-is.” It’s not comprehensive, and undoubtedly there are many other great secondary sources. I also may have missed a link or several. If you know of an additional resource I missed, a link I overlooked, or have a correction to something I mis-cited, please contact me.\n\nA list of abbreviations is provided after the list.\n\nAcademic Articles/Books\n\nAdams, Rebecca. “Narrative Voice and Unimaginability of the Utopian ‘Feminine’ in Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness and ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.” Utopian Studies 2.1-2 (1991): 35-47.
