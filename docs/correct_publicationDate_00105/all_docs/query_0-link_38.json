This first volume in a definitive two-volume edition gathers the first five Hainish novels: Rocannon's World, in which an ethnologist sent to a bronze-age planet must help defeat an intergalactic enemy; Planet of Exile, the story of human colonists stranded on a planet that is slowly killing them; City of Illusions, which finds a future Earth ruled by the mysterious Shing; and the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning masterpieces The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed-as well as four short stories.LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing.

An envoy from the galactic community becomes embroiled in local politics and is forced by his experiences to reconsider his attitudes toward human relationships. Serious, meticulous, and well written, the book has been much discussed, praised, and taught in university classes because of its timely analytic interest in sexual politics\" (Barron, Anatomy of Wonder II-643).\n\nHardcover.

In this novel, inhabitants of the alien planet \"Winter\" are androgynous, becoming temporarily male or female at periods of fertility. The protagonist is a male visitor from another world, thrown into political machinations that take him on a journey of survival across the ice with a single companion: a native whom he instinctively distrusts. While reckoning with different ways to envision gender, they develop a deep human bond that becomes central to their survival. Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, this UK edition was issued the same year as the US first. One of the great science fiction novels that feels more significant with each passing year. Signed copies are quite scarce. 7.75'' x 5''. Original textured purple paper boards, gilt-stamped spine. In original unclipped (£1.50 / 30s) color pictorial dust jacket. 286 pages.
