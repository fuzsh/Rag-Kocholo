        "text": "No reading list covering gender in speculative fiction would be complete without reference to Ursula Le Guin’s classic work. The Left Hand of Darkness follows a diplomat from an interplanetary alliance on his first approach to an icy planet, whose most intelligent life forms are largely androgynous, but—when they come into heat—can become either sex. Neither dystopian nor truly utopian, Le Guin’s book is a fascinating and immersive study of an imaginary alien culture that throws a great deal of light upon our own. This Lithub essay by the novelist Becky Chambers offers some further insight into the significance of Le Guin’s gender-queer masterpiece.\n\nFrom our article Books like The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness is probably Ursula le Guin‘s most famous book. Like Dune, it allows us to explore a complex alien culture through the eyes of a visitor; in this case, the diplomat Genly Ai who has arrived on the planet of Gethen as part of a mission to persuade its inhabitants to join the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Gethen, like Dune‘s Arrakis, has an extreme climate; at one stage, Ai treks with a Gethen native across an ice sheet for 80 days, almost losing his life in the process. And like Dune, we are introduced to an alien religion with prophetic elements. The Left Hand of Darkness is best known as a study of gender—the residents of Gethen take on characteristics of both sexes, but only at certain times, and this has profound impacts on its culture and social hierarchies. Fascinating and thought-provoking.\n\nFrom our article Books like Dune"
