        "text": "Ursula K. LeGuin’s books always find me when I need comforting, and usually, when I don’t even know it yet. I remember reading A Wizard of Earthsea while battling a flu, my bones aching and shivering while I insisted on being productive. It so happens that when I was reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I had a horrible bout of insomnia, where I was awake until 4:00 a.m., when I had to be up by 7. There was a difference between these forms of comforting, though. The Earthsea novel I found to be ridiculous and hilarious; in time, I would be endeared to the “little fail wizard.” In The Left Hand of Darkness, amidst technical terms and anthropological musings, it was the human element that left me with a feeling of bereavement. I don’t think you can understand how much emotional power is put into the words, “I must not touch you,” until you come to that part.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness is an exceptional novel, and while I always want to compare it to the writer I thought I understood in Earthsea, I’ve found that I have to understand LeGuin on her adult writing level. This is a novel that challenges the definitive labels we as a human race force onto others while avoiding understanding, that evaluates preconceived notions about gender in a genderless society. To label The Left Hand of Darkness as science-fiction and write it off is to do LeGuin a horrible disservice.\n\nIt’s important to start off with the fact that LeGuin is the daughter of an anthropologist. As such, she approaches societal structures from an anthropological view-point. Winter is a land made up of humans who are both male and female at the same time. They switch genders upon feeling emotional stress or for reproductive reasons. However, this understanding is simply the perspective of one Genly Ai, or the Envoy who has been sent by the Ekumen to form an alliance. Having been raised in a culture that is conditioned into gender and roles, he sees the “Gethenians” as switching between male and female, as he abides by the translated name of Gethen, “Winter” while watching a “traitorous sun” overhead. The best description of this state with the Gethenians can be found on The Left Hand of Darkness‘s Wikipedia entry: “they have gender identities and sexual urges only once a month.”\n\nGenly is in the midst of political dealings, having to suffer through a concept he has practically no knowledge of – “shrifgrethor” which is a concept of pride with the Gethenians that can be used to smooth over differences, but it can also be exploited and used to control others. Often, Genly misreads these conversations and when the Prime Minister of Karhide, Estraven, is trying to give him advice, the Envoy sees this as mocking. He travels to distant lands, from Karhide to Orgoreyn, while constantly being treated like an alien. The Gethenians refer to him as a “pervert”, as his static gender identity is an insinuation to them that Genly is always sexually active. Despite these differences, if he wears their clothes, Genly can often pass as a Gethenian. Except he’s quite taller than all of them, which becomes a source of humor within the book.\n\nThroughout the story, there is a sense that Genly is “going native” amongst the Gethenians. He’s spent three years with them and realizes that women are more alien to him. And it’s in a moment of complete isolation with Estraven that Genly loses his objectivity. The term “going native” often has negative connotations attached to it. As an anthropologist, you lose your academic hold with your subject. But LeGuin attaches a positive connotation to this condition. In losing his objectivity, Genly comes to love the Gethenians which is shown through his eventual love for Estraven. Love becomes a vehicle for understanding. And isn’t that why we study other groups? To understand them?\n\nGenly’s character development can be seen solely in his name. When he first met the Gethenians, they were confused as to why someone would be named after a sound of pain – “Ai”. But Ai is also the Japanese word for love. There is a duality in Genly’s name alone, and this is what separates him from the Gethenians. Duality is merely a human concept that is bred out of gender. While living with the Gethenians, Genly comes to understand the concept of shadowing. He even mentions the yin-yang symbol at one point, black and white. For Genly to understand the Gethenians, he must understand their shadowed state, which they express by not having opposites to their concepts. Rather than “light” and “dark”, the Gethenians believe in darkness and undarkness. It’s not an opposite, but a degree of darkness. And that is how the Gethenians live – by degrees of the same concept.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of names, I think it’s no accident that Estraven’s name is so similar to the word estrogen. Coupled with the fact that Estraven is referred to as a “he” displays this duality that Genly is so fond of.\n\nThe story of Genly’s relationship with the Gethenian race is interspersed with documents about said race and myths, as well as Estraven’s journals. These documents are fascinating in and of themselves, as LeGuin created a hermaphroditic race and honestly thought about what kind of society that would engender; rather than use concepts like hermaphroditism and androgyny for titillation, she uses it to further her ideas. Above every other idea that is presented in The Left Hand of Darkness, what LeGuin is proposing in this novel is that the concept of civilization is inherent in animal and human society. Upon listening to Tibe’s diatribe, Genly states, “One of the most dangerous is the implication that civilization, being artificial, is unnatural: that it is the opposite of primitiveness . . . Of course there is no veneer, the process is one of growth, and primitiveness and civilization are degrees of the same thing. If civilization has an opposite, it is war.”\n\nThis is a civilization where, without gender, there is no sexual tension, no war, no patriotism, and no competition. Everyone, as Genly eventually remarks, is on equal footing. There is no sense of dominance, and I hate to refer to this as “male dominance” because females have a habit of displaying dominance as well. Safe to say, there are no mean girls within the Gethenians. On the opposite hand, LeGuin is insinuating that these notions are born out of gender. There exists no war because when one, “eliminate[s] the masculinity that rapes and the femininity that is raped,” then there is no need for conquest. In the sense of child rearing, they believe in the idea of “it takes a village to raise a child.” “Everyone between seventeen and thirty-five or so is liable to be . . . ‘tied down to child bearing’ implies that no one is quite so thoroughly ‘tied down’ here as women, elsewhere, are likely to be – psychologically or physically. Burden and privilege are shared out pretty equally; everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make. Therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else.”\n\nThe Gethenians have no concept of war . . . but they’re on the verge of one. There are certainly borders about the world of Gethen, even though Estraven explains how he can’t understand the concept of borders. It’s interesting that it’s only when the Gethenians have started to learn to live off the harsh land that they finally have a concept of war. Once they don’t need to spend all of their time focusing on survival, that’s when they begin to grow uncomfortable with other countries on their planet. Is LeGuin then saying that we were more civilized when we were a primitive race? We can’t harbor these feelings of fighting when we’re trying to survive because it goes against our need to survive as a race. If we were killing each other off at the most troubling of times, then we’d never prosper. It’s only when we become prosperous that we can focus on other matters. Like land.\n\nOnce Estraven and Genly have both become exiles, spending multiple chapters moving across the vast expanse of snow, they develop companionship. I wasn’t expecting a romantic element to this novel and yet, when it came upon me that perhaps Genly was in love with Estraven, it is explained in such bare language that it becomes quite touching, perhaps due to the fact that they can’t touch. For if they did, it would remind them of their stark differences when they’ve formed a relationship based on their commonalities. And it’s only through falling in love with Estraven that Genly can see “him” for who “he” really is, that there is also a woman’s face residing within Estraven’s features.\n\nOn pronouns, LeGuin decided to use “he” when speaking of the Gethenians. In later essays, she has expressed regret for having done so, and perhaps leading readers to believe that they were more masculine than feminine. However, I think this really works in terms of Genly’s perspective. He doesn’t understand their full hermaphroditic existence and forces them into a masculine role simply by using a pronoun. When Genly speaks of the Gethenians, he betrays them by placing them in one gender. Much as Estraven betrays his own people by wanting to form an alliance. Much as language always betrays us.\n\nWhen Genly finally contacts other humans and they land on Gethen, he finds that he’s disgusted by them. “But they all looked strange to me, men and women, well as I knew them. Their voices sounded strange: too deep, too shrill. They were like a troupe of great, strange animals, of two different species: great apes with intelligent eyes, all of them in rut, in kemmer . . .” There is a sense in this book that alien is only defined by one’s surroundings. One human amidst Gethenians transforms Genly from human to alien. At the beginning, Genly understands that, “more and more often I longed for anonymity, for sameness. I craved to be like everybody else.” When the other humans come to greet him, Genly has become too embedded within the culture. Once he understands the shadowed concepts of the Gethenians, he’s disgusted by the black and white mentality of humanity.\n\nIt’s impossible for humans to ever be genderless, but I think there’s a message in here for humans as well. In time, science has informed us that men have amounts of estrogen within them, while women have amounts of testosterone within them. There’s a set number of how much or how little though. Women have more estrogen, men have more testosterone. I have a disease that often makes this “balance” completely unbalanced. Because of this, my sense of femininity, which was once attached to my sense of self, has been completely thrown out the window. I dislike the fact that some people will refer to their gender identities as “shifting”, because I think that rather than shifting, there is simply no word for feeling without gender. What we assume to be “gender” is a set of personality traits that were devised back in more conservative societies, where gender roles were needed for the sake of survival. But we have no need for this survival anymore. Humans need to learn to have more understanding of shadowing within the world of gender. Or rather, as Genly plainly states, “my efforts took the form of self-consciously seeing a Gethenian first as a man, then as a woman, forcing him into those categories so irrelevant to his nature and so essential to my own.” We are conditioned by gender, by the biological processes that work within us. And I can only hope that in more time, as a race, we can become like Genly.\n\nThroughout The Left Hand of Darkness, LeGuin stays quite ambiguous about characters and plot. This is leaps and bounds beyond what I found in A Wizard of Earthsea where everything possible is explained to the reader; friendship is ruined by a need to barrage the reader with information. And yet here I’ve found a subtle and complex book from a writer I believed I knew. One of the most ambiguous moments of the book comes when Genly teaches Estraven to mind-speak with him, a language that is impossible to lie in. When Genly speaks to Estraven though his mind, the Gethenian hears the voice of his dead brother, and lover as the Gethenians are not opposed to incest, so long as they don’t vow “kemmering.” It’s left up to the reader to decide why Genly’s thoughts are spoken with Arek’s voice. A myth of the Gethenians led me to my answer, in the chapter titled “Estraven the Traitor.”\n\nThe myth tells of Estraven’s ancestors and that the Estravens within Gethenian society have always been traitors – perhaps a self-fulfilling prophecy to give him that name. The story tells of one Gethenian named Estraven who was lost in the cold only to be rescued by one named Arek. They fell in love, only to learn later that they were siblings. Because of this, Estraven was killed. Later, a baby is brought back to the land of Estre, believed to be Estraven and Arek’s child. That child grows up as another Estraven and is later saved by another Gethenian, possibly named Arek, but also his sibling. They go on to form an alliance between the Gethenians. They are always mortal enemies, but their relationships ends in an alliance of some kind. Genly is Arek. Only instead of being a Gethenian, he is a human and their relationship ends with an alliance between humans and Gethenians."
