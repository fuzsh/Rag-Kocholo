        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n♪♪♪ Le Guin: I wrote a book, back in the '60s, called 'Left Hand of Darkness.'\n\nWhat I was first asking myself, you know, 'Well, okay, what [laughing] is the difference between men and women?'\n\nAnd the means I used to talk about it was to invent a race of people who are androgynous, fully androgynous.\n\nYou only become sexually active once a month and you may become active as a man or as a woman.\n\nYou don't know which.\n\nBrown: And so, in the course of someone's lifetime, they can father a child; they can mother a child.\n\nThey can have lovers of all different types.\n\n♪♪♪ [ Wind whistling ] Le Guin: In 'The Left Hand of Darkness,' we meet Genly, the first envoy from the Ekumen to the planet of Winter.\n\n♪♪♪ -[Crowd whispering] -As he tries to navigate this icebound world of genderless people, Genly becomes entangled in a political web.\n\n[ Whispering continues ] He's forced to flee across a glacier, along with Estraven, a native of Winter who has become his ally.\n\n♪♪♪ Mitchell: As they cover the miles over the ice, they also close the miles between themselves, as individuals, as different subspecies of ♪♪♪ Le Guin: 'After all he is no more an oddity, a sexual freak, than I am; up here on the Ice, each of us is singular, isolated, I as cut off from those like me, from my society and its rules, as he from his.'\n\nMitchell: It's not just a geographical journey.\n\nIt's a journey into human cooperation, into a human relationship.\n\n[ Wind whistling ] Gaiman: When 'Left Hand of Darkness' came out, it was perceived, rightly, as having changed things, as being something that was unlike anything else that had been published.\n\n♪♪♪ Miéville: Nowadays, there is a lot more interest in kind of genderqueering and genderfluidity.\n\nI wonder if it might be difficult for a young reader now to realize quite how extraordinary and powerful that was when she did it.\n\nGoss: Readers and critics have thought about 'Left Hand of Darkness' as a feminist novel and I absolutely think it was, for its time, but, there were other writers, feminist science fiction writers, and critics, as well, who were saying, 'You didn't quite go far enough.'\n\nAtwood: She got in trouble with 'Left Hand of Darkness' because, when you weren't changing into some other gender, you were 'he.'\n\nGaiman: It started getting criticism: 'Why are you forcing us to think of a masculine default all the way?\n\nCouldn't you have done it a different way?'\n\nDo I think that 'The Left Hand of Darkness' that Ursula would write now would be 'The Left Hand of Darkness' that I read in 1971?\n\nNo! Obviously not.\n\nShe has changed and the world has changed.\n\n[ Birds chirping ] Le Guin: At first, I felt a little bit defensive, but, as I thought about it, I began to see my critics were right.\n\n♪♪♪ I was coming up against how I write about gender equality.\n\n♪♪♪ My job is not to arrive at a final answer and just deliver it.\n\n♪♪♪ I see my job as holding doors open or opening windows, but, [scoffing] who comes in and out the doors?\n\nWhat do you see out the window?\n\nHow do I know?\n\n♪♪♪"
