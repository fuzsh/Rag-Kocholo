How our environment, our upbringing, and our gender system affect our social and political progress is a really interesting topic which she explores here deftly and interestingly. highly recommend.\n\nToo many words not enough plot\n\nI was a little concerned when I was getting bored with the author's introduction. Unfortunately that was how the whole book ended up for me.\n\nNot very good\n\nBig Guidall fan, and legiuin has good reviews, but the story was dull xxx\n\nHigh\n\nI am a better and wiser person after this tale.\n\nIf you are new, be patient with the early chapters. She will explain everything in due course.\n\nIts Ursula, just listen.\n\nKnit one pearl two!\n\nA complex concept delivered with clarity and perfect narration. The voice conveyed emotions and clarity in differentiation of the many characters and their many traditions.\n\nseemed old fashioned\n\nI didn't check to see when this was written. I'm surprised to have this reaction as I would have thought I would like classic sci fi. good story, ready to see through to the social commentary. liked it ok\n\nthat was an interesting story.\n\nNever have I been so moved by a book written so devoid of emotion and dictated on audible with the voice of someone with equivocal stoicism.\n\nWell-developed and thought-provoking\n\nIf you're familiar with LeGuin's other work, it's no surprise this novel is packed with thought-provoking conversations and casually dropped aphorisms that may keep you thinking hours after you turn it off. It's brilliant. It's a meditation on what mankind is capable of mentally, socially, politically, and even physically. The world-building is exceptional and characters are compelling and realistic. I also love the way LeGuin brings journal and other life writing into the book, which comes across well in the performance. Highly recommend.\n\nFailed to live up to its reputation\n\nAlas, I only got through half of this book, and it's the second time I started and didn't finish it. About forty years ago the book was highly recommended to me, and I gave it a brief try. I thought that with the maturity of older age I might find this \"classic\" more interesting, and this time I read substantially more. But I just didn't find the story plot and characters sufficiently gripping to hold my attention."
