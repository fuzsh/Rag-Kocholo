        "text": "Genly Ai has spent two long years on the planet Gethen now, in the kingdom of Karhide. He is still learning how to balance his steps on its icy, slippery terrain and society. He has been sent as an envoy from the Ekumen of Known Worlds, a confederation of 83 inhabitable planets (including Earth), to woo Gethen into the alliance.\n\nGethen has human inhabitants, but no men or women. No gender. They do have a monthly mating cycle (called kemmer) during which a Gethenian can temporarily become male or female without any predisposition. This is something that baffles Genly, who hails from a world where gender politics is the norm:\n\n“A man wants his virility regarded. A woman wants her femininity appreciated, however indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation.” On Gethen, one is respected and judged only as a human being.\n\nHumankind on Gethen has evolved accordingly over the last 20,000 years or so. In a society without gender and gender politics, the rules of the game are different. Gethenian sociopolitics is instead governed by shifgrethor, an intricate code of etiquette (equivalent to tehzeeb), that Genly cannot make head or tail of. He is wary of the people, and the discomfiture is mutual, as the Gethenians cannot fathom how this alien can be a ‘man’ all the time, a perverted alien. For them, the physical traits that set apart a male from a female are apparent only during kemmer, that time of the month when they are sexually active.\n\nBut Genly is here to do a job. He can do that only by gaining an audience with the king of Karhide, a privilege that has been denied to him for two years now. His only patron and friend is Estraven, a key figure in Karhidian politics. However, before Genly can make a move, the delicate political waters are disturbed, and the duo are estranged and rendered fugitives of the state. Now Genly must overcome the hostile frigidity of Gethen and Gethenians, and undertake a journey across this eternally frozen land.\n\nIn the course of this long, long journey, Genly’s eyes are slowly opened to the workings of this strange planet, its regions and religions. The two major nations — Karhide and Orgoreyn — and two major religions — Handdarata and Yomeshta — have been at loggerheads for thousands of years, and now Genly somehow finds himself in the thick of the action. This is a tricky spot to be in, but also the only opportunity to gain the trust and alliance of Gethen. It is all or nothing.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin liked to call The Left Hand of Darkness a thought experiment. She hated it when you called her a sci-fi/fantasy writer. She hated to be pigeonholed, she said. So yes, I will not try to belittle her legacy by telling you all about her extraordinary world-building, and stuff like that.\n\nI can, however, tell you that she was a rabble rouser, a woman ahead of her time and unafraid of speaking her mind. I can tell you how the poetry of her prose rises and dances and whirls on these pages like Sufi dervishes gathering to celebrate the discovery of a new, mystic land. I can tell you how my goosebumps tingled with cold and nervous excitement when Genly Ai takes off on this terrifying adventure across the ice, ice and ice of Gethen.\n\nI can tell you about the Ekumen and Karhide and Orgoreyn, and how it all comes to an end. But nusuth. It doesn’t matter.\n\n“It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.”"
