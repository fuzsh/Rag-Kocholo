        "text": "For anyone wanting a masterclass in science fiction world-building, look no further than the legendary Ursula K. Le Guin. The daughter of an anthropologist and a writer, she holds the honor of being the first writer to win both the Hugo and Nebula awards twice. While I’ve been an adoring fan of her fiction for years, I regret that I arrived so late to reading The Left Hand of Darkness. A guidebook to a world I desperately want to visit, this novel broke all the rules at the time of its publication over half a century ago. This novel not only explored a fantastic world, but also the inner workings of a very detailed society. With its ideas from gender/sexuality to the meaning of patriotism, this is a classic piece of literature that still holds so much relevance in a world of misunderstanding.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness takes place on the world of Gethen, also known as Winter on account of its harsh blizzard-like conditions. By the time I finished reading, I literally felt like I had actually been there. Taking the form of a travelogue, the detailed descriptions of Gethen’s nations of Karhide and Orgoreyn were the best I’ve encountered since Frank Herbert guided me through the desert planet of Arrakis. In fact, Gethen felt like the opposing cousin to Herbert’s incredibly detailed world. The book’s protagonist, Genly Ai, serves as an ambassador to a benevolent federation called the Ekumen, whose mission is to invite the Gethenians to join. While Genly faces many challenges on this frigid world, the biggest is his struggle to understand a society of people who are quite different from him.\n\n“Cultural shock was nothing much compared to the biological shock I suffered as a human male among beings who were, five-sixths of the time, hermaphroditic neuters.”\n\nThe Gethenians are gender-neutral most of the time, except for once a month when they go into a phase called “kemmer” and become either male or female. This means that someone could be male during one cycle and a female during the next. Throughout the novel, Le Guin provides detailed cultural norms. For example, a couple can “pledge kemmer” which is another term for staying partners for life. Siblings can even become partners, but they have to separate after the first off-spring. Along with so many other details, including Gethenian folklore and sayings, Le Guin weaves together so many fascinating threads into a tapestry that feels like a series of books than just one standalone novel.\n\nWhile The Left Hand of Darkness feels like such a grand epic, it is also a very intimate story of its two main characters learning to understand each other over cultural barriers and sexual stereotypes. Genly Ai doesn’t trust his main ally on Gethen, a native named Therem Harth rem ir Estraven, and the two of them continually fail to communicate, even as the situation gets worse for both of them. Le Guin captures perfectly the tragedies that occur due to their miscommunication. This attention to a very relevant problem today makes this novel even more important now than its first publication back in 1969. Genly and Estraven’s relationship, particularly their journey together over the life-threatening terrain, is what gives this book its emotional arc.\n\nThe novel’s title comes from a Gethenian myth about light and dark existing together:\n\n“Light is the left hand of darkness\n\nand darkness the right hand of light.\n\nTwo are one, life and death, lying\n\ntogether like lovers in kemmer,\n\nlike hands joined together,\n\nlike the end and the way.”\n\nGenly relates this back to the yin-yang symbol of Taoism. While this is a rather dark story, there are moments of brightness, particularly in the strengthening friendship between Genly and Estraven. And this is especially true during the long sequence where Genly and Estraven trek across the Gobrin Ice, the frozen waste to the north of Orgoreyn and Karhide. Every step of their journey is beautifully described, with phrases like “mincing along like a cat on eggshells” and “cinders patter, falling with the snow.” These little moments of poetry work well in opposition to the unforgiving setting. The strengthening bond between Genly and Estraven is the brightest part of this novel. For such a bleak setting, this book is often suffused with optimism. This idea of an enlightened society like the Ekumen feels very attainable under Le Guin’s vision. While our society is nowhere close to bridging that gap from ignorance to awareness, perhaps we are moving closer to that goal.\n\nI’ve always thought that a good science fiction story (or any work of fiction) is that it allows you, for at least a moment, to suspend disbelief. You can actually envision the possibilities of a world that could be different. When this novel was originally written, there were those that identified as trans, but only a few that were in the public eye. Nonbinary people even less so. One of the problems I had with this book was the consistent use of the word “he” to describe anyone. In an interview, Le Guin felt that any other pronoun might make this novel too confusing, but she did take more than her fair share of flack for this. In a later short story set in this universe, Le Guin uses the pronoun “she” which still does not feel right.\n\nHowever, this weakness in the book’s approach to gender is also a strength as it helped me to understand that Genly Ai is a very flawed narrator. Genly is clearly a misogynist, which unfortunately makes him terrible at his job. It’s fascinating that he was chosen as emissary considering this description of the Ekumen:\n\n“But the Ekumen is not essentially a government at all. It is an attempt to reunify the mystical with the political, and as such is of course mostly a failure; but the failure has done more good for humanity so far than the successes of its predecessors, It is a society and it has, at least potentially, a culture. It is a form of education; i one aspect, it’s a sort of very large school-very large indeed. The motives of communication and cooperation are of its essence, and therefore in another aspect it’s a league or union of worlds, possessing some degree of centralized conventional organization. It’s this aspect, the League, that I now represent.”\n\nIt’s fascinating, and very realistic, that Genly Ai serves as an enlightened representative of an advanced, harmonious culture—while also being a deeply prejudiced individual who cannot see past his own limited ideas about gender and sexuality. While most of the time, he is quite open-minded, he comes across as downright derogatory to his views on gender. For me, this overabundance of the word “he” felt like an extension of the narrator’s own limitations. At the heart of The Left Hand of Darkness, there is this journey across the Gobrin Ice with Estraven. The length and slowness of their trek matches Genly’s slow internal process of attaining wisdom and understanding.\n\n“No I don’t mean love, when I say patriotism. I mean fear. The fear of the other.”\n\nWhile Genly Ai spends the novel learning to see past his own prejudices, Estraven’s story is all about just how far someone will go to create a better future for their people. All of Estraven’s choices are driven by his determination to bring progress and enlightenment to Gethen. Embedded within this narrative of change, there’s this discussion on the concept of patriotism. Is this idea of patriotism about love for one’s nation or the fear of those who are different? Le Guin explores these ideas through the misfortunes that occur with the two leads of the story.\n\nAnother reason this novel shines so brilliantly is in its philosophical and mystical dialogues that are interspersed within the main storyline. It’s impossible to separate the politics of The Left Hand of Darkness from its spirituality. Le Guin isn’t afraid to tackle the big questions, such as the meaning of patriotism, what makes a people a nation, and the delicate balance between lightness and darkness. Gethen is a world without war—which may be due to its climate, or to its lack of warriors—but it’s also just beginning to develop the concept of the nation-state. Orgoreyn, with its oppressive bureaucracy and lethal secret police, is closer to nationhood than Karhide, but a territorial dispute is pushing both countries closer to patriotic fervor (a patriotism that is fear-based rather than one based on love).\n\n“The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.”\n\nFor everything we intimately witness in regards to Gethen, there is so much mystery and wonder. Part of what Genly offers the people of this planet is the hope that by joining the Ekumen they become part of a unified whole. For the majority of the story, the Ekumen remain largely in the background in the form of this spaceship where Genly’s people are in cryostasis as he works his mission. This is just one area that we only get glimpses of. The nature of prophecy is the same way. We visit the foretellers and see their work without fully grasping how it works, and the future remains a mystery even as they speak. Of course, the prophecy fails due to miscommunication (the wrong question asked or misunderstanding of the answer). One of my favorite parts of the book is the legend of Meshe, who was a Weaver in a foretelling when someone asked the meaning of life, and it all went horribly wrong. This theme of misinterpretation runs rampant in the narrative, perhaps a lesson on how misunderstandings are our downfall on both grand and intimate scales.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness is such an important novel on so many different levels. It is an honor to count it as my classic from a woman author for BACK TO THE CLASSICS 2021. Filled with many wonderful ideas and deep emotional moments, Le Guin’s language sparks with so much wonder. For every detail in the book, there are so many more little ones embedded inside. You catch a glimpse of one story which leads down another, and soon you realize that everything is made of stories. As Genly Ai says on the very first page, “Truth is a matter of the imagination.”\n\n“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.”"
