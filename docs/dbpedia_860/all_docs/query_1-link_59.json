        "text": "It is a well-known fact breastfeeding can help give babies the best start to life. When a baby is in hospital, the role of this is even more important, making the support for healthcare teams invaluable. Together with Western Sydney Local Health District, our lactation nurses in the Grace Centre for Newborn Intensive Care and our Family Health Nurses recently ran a two-day 'SCORIO (Structured, Clinical, Objective, Referenced, Problem-orientated, Integrated, Organise) Breastfeeding Train the Trainer' workshop for healthcare workers, equipping participants with the knowledge and skills needed to become breastfeeding trainers. The interactive workshop brought together 64 participants from eight different Local Health Districts and our Network, including nurses from our Grace Centre, Edgar Stephens Ward, Clancy Ward, and our Education team. Lactation Specialist, Gabbie Kerslake, was one of the presenters at the workshop and said it was a hands-on way for participants to learn practical skills they can use to help educate and train their own teams. \"SCORPIO increases health professionals' confidence and provides them with up to date, evidence-based knowledge and skills that they can use when providing care for mothers and babies with breastfeeding,\" Gabbie said. \"The impact on mothers is that they receive correct and consistent information, which is vital for mothers of sick babies and infants. This empowers mothers to feel more supported so they can breastfeed for longer and hopefully decrease some of the stress they experience.\" The workshop was praised by participants and has been a vital step in building capacity and empowering more breastfeeding educators around the state.\n\nOur Network and NSW Health are committed to taking action and responding to climate risk to ensure the long-term sustainability of the healthcare sector. As part of this commitment, NSW Health has established a Sustainable Futures Innovation Fund to assist projects across the system deliver an environmentally sustainable footprint for the future. Congratulations to Associate Professor Justin Skowno, Dr Reza Kahlaee and their team in our Anaesthetics Department on their success in securing funding for their sustainability project 'Empowering Gas Monitoring for Better Care: A Smart Dashboard for Sustainability and Healthcare Efficiency'. With this grant, the team will develop a smart dashboard that provides real-time data on nitrous oxide gas consumption and emissions within healthcare facilities. The overall aim is to transform how healthcare facilities monitor and manage nitrous oxide gas usage, with a strong focus on reducing the environmental impact and enhancing operational efficiency. \"By accurately tracking nitrous oxide usage, with data-driven insights, the dashboard will help healthcare providers make informed decisions to optimise their resource usage,\" Dr Kahlaee said. The smart dashboard builds on last year's initiative to install an accurate flowmeter for monitoring nitrous oxide consumption at our hospital - the first of its kind in Australia, and is an important step in reducing our carbon footprint for the future. \"It is an incredible honour and a significant milestone for our team. It validates our vision of leveraging technology to create a healthier and more sustainable future,\" Dr Kahlaee said. We look forward to seeing this projects progress in the coming months.\n\nWorking in our Grace Centre for Newborn Intensive Care at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Felicity and our lactation specialists provide crucial support to new mothers and their babies who are starting their breastfeeding journey. This includes Julieta and her baby, Austin, who was born at 28 weeks' gestation weighing less than a kilo. After several surgeries, Austin needed tailored support to help him progress to breastfeeding. With Felicity's guidance, Julieta was able to learn how to pump, the best ways to express milk and was able to practice regular skin-to-skin. Over time, Austin gradually mastered the skill of latching and breastfeeding quickly became one of his favourite activities. As well as working with families, our lactation specialists also work with other teams across the Network and across the health system, providing education and training that helps empower health professionals to support all new mums with breastfeeding their baby. The role of our lactation specialists across the Network is invaluable and this World Breastfeeding Week is a chance to recognise and celebrate their dedication in fostering successful breastfeeding journeys and delivering essential multi-level support for families like Austin's. #WorldBreastfeedingWeek #NICU #breastisbest\n\nJoin us for the biennial \"Spring with the Kids\" seminar on 14 September. Hosted by the Perioperative Service at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, the seminar will enhance and update the clinical knowledge and skills of nurses who provide care to children and their families in perioperative and surgical settings. The seminar is open to all perioperative and surgical nurses working in paediatric units across Australia and abroad. For more information and to register, visit https://lnkd.in/gF4g2aTK #perioperative #education #healthcare\n\nA world-first study has shown a low carbohydrate, high fat diet could have a life-changing impact on cognitive function for children living with Kabuki syndrome. The study, led by Professor Russell Dale’s Clinical Neuroimmunology Group at Kids Research, in collaboration with The Children's Medical Research Institute, the University of Sydney and The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, trialled the ketogenic diet over a period of 12-months in a teenage boy, Hugo, with the rare condition. Study lead, Ms Erica Tsang, Senior Ketogenic Dietitian, said the study proved that diet can change gene regulation and improve clinical outcomes, with life changing results for children like Hugo. The research was generously supported by the Sydney Children's Hospitals Foundation (SCHF), the Wood family and the Petre Foundation.

The research project is a national collaboration lead by Dr Hsu and other investigators from Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, University of Sydney, UNSW, Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), The Royal Children's Hospital and Garvan Institute of Medical Research.

Dr Chennapragada is only the third Australian Interventional Radiology Specialist (IR) to receive this prestigious fellowship. Awarded at The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Annual meeting in the USA, the fellowship recognises members of the Society who have made significant contributions to the field of interventional radiology and obtained achievements in research, education and leadership. For Dr Chennapragada, this has included performing minimally invasive procedures and utilising best advances in medical technology to provide treatments for sick children that alleviate pain, reduce recovery times and improve health outcomes. “Receiving FSIR is an incredibly humbling and gratifying experience. I also feel quite proud, especially since I am only the third Australian Interventional radiology specialist to have been awarded the fellowship and the only paediatric IR from the Asia Pacific region,” Dr Chennapragada said. \"I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to practice in this field. To make a significant positive impact on the lives of young patients and their families is incredibly fulfilling.\" Please join us in congratulating Dr Chennapragada on this outstanding achievement. #forsickkids #interventionalradiology #staffrecognition"
