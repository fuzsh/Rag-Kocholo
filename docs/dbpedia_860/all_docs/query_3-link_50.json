        "text": "In 1876 – at a time when the industrial revolution had made Sheffield a dirty and unhealthy place and there were frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases - a doctor, an architect and a solicitor decided it was “expedient to found an institution for the relief of poor sick children” and opened Sheffield Children's Hospital.\n\nThey made history. They thought that children would get the best possible care if they were in a hospital dedicated to treating them.\n\nFrom then on, surgeons performed world first operations, parents heard about the doctors that were experts in their field and scientists found ground-breaking cures and treatments for all kinds of conditions.\n\nThey left a legacy in Sheffield, one which placed the hospital as a centre of excellence and one of only four stand-alone children’s hospitals in the country.\n\nLet’s make it better together and continue the original founding vision of Sheffield Children's Hospital – to significantly improve child health care across Sheffield, the region and beyond.\n\n1876 – The hospital opens, seeing outpatients only\n\n1877 – The hospital gains eight beds, but no running water\n\n1880 – The hospital moves into a bigger home at Western Bank and St. Barnabas’ School donates £1 specially and solely for the hospital\n\n1896 - a new central block with operating theatre and isolation room is installed\n\n1903 – A new outpatients block is built – the old part of the hospital which still stands today. The first electric lights are switched on and an x-ray machine is installed. There are now 50 beds.\n\n1972 – Two new wards are built which means there are now 85 beds at the hospital. The outpatients department is extended, electric lifts installed and the operating theatre is improved.\n\n1970s – The accident and emergency department on Western Bank is extended. Over 50,000 children visit the department each year!\n\n1976 – The Children’s Hospital Charity is born to raise vital funds for the hospital\n\n1990s/2000s – The hospital now has over 150 beds, 10 wards and departments, seven operating theatres and specialist units for burns and neuro-care.\n\nIn the late 1990’s a part-time arts coordinator was employed by the hospital trust to give clearer direction to art commissioning. Soon after, senior consultants began to identify the benefits of art in providing distraction for children in hospital and thus an arts workshop programme was designed to engage children on the wards. These varied workshop sessions, facilitated by professional artists and musicians, were a great way to get children socialising, expressing and enjoying themselves.\n\n2008 - The Children’s Hospital Charity took over funding of the arts programme as part of its mission to 'make it better'. Formerly named the Arts for Health Programme, Artfelt has since re-branded to reflect its increased involvement in Trust redevelopment projects. Artfelt now works alongside Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust to ensure all alterations to the decor and appearance of the hospital are completed to a professional standard and provide a stimulating atmosphere that makes the clinical more comfortable.\n\n2015 – Over 260,000 patient visited the hospital in this year as demand for its services its increases year on year. Children come from across the UK and even the world to receive specialist treatment in Sheffield so the hospital is transforming with the development of a new hospital ward\n\n2016 - A new spacious Outpatient Department opens in the new wing of the hospital following a fantastic £10 million raised.\n\n2018 - The new wing to our hospital opens with brand new state of the art bedrooms, and play tower making a childs stay at our hospital an adventure!\n\n2022 - The new Cancer and Leukaemia Ward opens thanks to charity fundraising."
