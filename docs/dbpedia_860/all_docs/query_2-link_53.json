        "text": "Noah’s Ark’s willingness to break the mould by committing to training in this area and supporting Long-Term Ventilated children is laudable and the Noah’s Ark team’s ethos of providing excellent care is palpable.\n\nEverything about Noah’s Ark just works, unlike other services. The communication with Katie, our Specialist Carer, with Adele, our Family Link Worker and with Kirsty, the Music Therapist – it’s a whole family approach and we really feel valued. And Katie offers so much more than just ‘care.\n\nThey’re our family now. We all know where the journey will end and we want it to be somewhere that we feel loved and accepted with people we know around. We couldn’t imagine anywhere better than The Ark.\n\nNoah’s Ark’s Music Therapist joined us on the day of George’s compassionate extubation (removal of breathing support). It was very comforting to know that he was surrounded by familiar pleasant sounds associated with happy and calm times we had together. For one last time we were able to experience being a family of three.’\n\nMagnus has had some tremendous experiences here and some amazing memories have been made. It really is a Gold Star Operation, and with some of the highest standard of care that we’ve seen in our journey with Magnus. Through everything, it will continue to be a priority for us that he continues to come here."
