        "text": "Welcome to our unique, exciting integrated children’s centre.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of Serennu is the provision of treatment, care, information, consultations and leisure services from under one roof. This eases tremendously the burden on individual families and provides continuity of care for the children.\n\nThe guiding principle for Serennu is to ensure disabled children and their families from all communities are fully supported to participate in valued childhood experiences and have access to the same range of opportunities, life experiences, mainstream and community services and facilities as other children and their families.\n\nThe centre facilities include:\n\n‘Serennu’ isn't just about the treatment that the children and young people receive; the centre provides family centred services to accommodate the needs of parents too. Through use of the MediCinema and leisure facilities the centre helps families to be able to socialise and enjoy a range of activities in a supportive environment."
