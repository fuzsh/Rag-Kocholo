The country has been great to us and people have been amazing hosts so we just wanted to do our part and give back to the community and country.”\n\nBotham added: “We’ve been playing some games with the kids. It’s been great to see smiles on faces and like Dewi said give something back.”\n\nQueensland Children’s Hospital is one of Australia’s largest and most advanced paediatric health facilities and a centre for teaching and research. On any given day, the team at the Queensland Children’s Hospital treat more than 200 children in its emergency department, see around 1,000 children for outpatient appointments and care for over 200 children as inpatients. It is the busiest Paediatric Intensive Care Unit in Australia, providing life saving care to more than 1,800 critically injured and sick kids each year.\n\nThe Children’s Hospital Foundation funds cutting-edge equipment, vital research and on-the-ground support for kids with all illnesses, injuries and conditions, throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales."
