        "text": "Your initial request for support will be received by our Single Point of Access team. They may decide you would benefit from an assessment.\n\nWe’ll start by inviting you for an initial meeting we call an assessment as soon as we can (normally within 4 weeks). This could be a virtual, telephone or face to face appointment.\n\nThis is a chance for us to get to know you and understand what’s going on in your life. We’ll talk about the challenges you’ve been facing, what you’d like to change and how we might help with achieving your goals.\n\nWe’ll ask you questions about your experiences at home, school and with your family and friends. You can also ask us questions. Together we will decide what the next best step is for you.\n\nYou may find that this initial meeting is all that you need. We may also signpost you to an appropriate service. We may also decide with you that a few sessions with our interventions team would be helpful.\n\nWe will find the best option for you based on your individual needs.\n\nWe provide assessments and care in the community to children and young people who are referred to Specialist CAMHS and who have severe mental illness and complex needs.\n\nYou’ll first be invited for an initial meeting called a choice appointment with Specialist CAMHS, where we’ll talk about the difficulties you’ve been having, what you’d like to change and how we might help with this. Your practitioner will then refer you to the CITT team.\n\nWe aim to meet you for a first face to face assessment within 5 working days of discussing your referral as a team. Following this first session, we can complete a more thorough assessment for very complex needs over six weeks if there is a need for a diagnosis.\n\nWe will work with you to create a care plan about what to expect from your treatment, how you can look after yourself and the goals you would like to achieve. We will also deliver therapeutic interventions based on your needs.\n\nWe will work with you until you are stable and can be stepped down to Specialist CAMHS, Primary Mental Health or Adult Mental Health Services for the next stage of your emotional wellbeing journey. This is a good thing as it means that you are making progress towards your goals and are ready for the next step.\n\nWe support young people aged 11-18 years who are struggling with their emotional wellbeing by connecting them to opportunities in their local community.\n\nOur Community Connectors get to know the young person by listening to their needs, discussing the challenges they may face and identifying goals they want to work on.\n\nWe then work together with the young person to create a plan to help improve their wellbeing by connecting them to local groups and activities. This could include:\n\nmaking new friends,\n\nvolunteering,\n\nexercising,\n\ngetting out in nature or\n\nexploring new hobbies.\n\nWe will have an initial phone call with the young person to make sure:\n\nWe are the right team to support them\n\nThe young person fully understands what we are offering, and\n\nThe young person wants to participate\n\nWe will then meet the young person regularly over a 12-week period.\n\nOur community connectors can help by:\n\nproviding their knowledge about local activities,\n\nsupporting the young person to attend any groups or activities,\n\nhelping them to identify and overcome challenges to their emotional wellbeing.\n\nWe provide mental health assessments for young people in hospital, GP surgeries and custody suites.\n\nAn assessment is a chance for a young person to talk with a practitioner about what they’re feeling, the impact on their life and what goals they want to achieve. We will complete this assessment within 48 hours of the referral.\n\nAfter the assessment, we will talk to you, your family and anyone who’s been involved with your care about next steps. This could include:\n\nDirecting you to other services\n\nIntensive follow up support with the Crisis Liaison Team\n\nAdmitting you to supportive accommodation or a CAMHS or Adult Mental Health Services in-patient facility\n\nWe’ll also tell the person who referred you to us what happened and what we have recommended to you.\n\nWhen we receive your referral, we’ll start by inviting you by letter or telephone for an initial meeting called a choice appointment.\n\nWe’ll talk about the difficulties you’ve been having, what you’d like to change and how we might help with this.\n\nWe’ll also talk about how you and your family’s strengths and skills may help the situation. We’ll talk to you about how we will work together on the difficulties you’re facing and the goals you want to achieve.\n\nAfter the choice appointment, we’ll assign a practitioner to lead your care that has the skills and experience to meet your needs.\n\nWe’ll ask you to attend sessions once or twice a week to start with, so that we can talk to you about what’s going on with you and keep an eye on your physical wellbeing through regular weighings and medical checks.\n\nThe support you receive in your sessions will vary depending on what you need. We have a Family Therapy pathway that involves your family members in your care, and an Enhanced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy pathway that is adapted for your individual needs.\n\nWe have strong connections with staff at Adult Mental Health Services, University Hospital Wales, and Ty Llidiard. Even if you experience a change in your care, such as transitioning to Adult Mental Health or needing to stay in hospital to look after your physical health, we will continue to support you and be part of your care.\n\nWe invite all adults supporting children who live in care to attend our Enfys Group. This is a 6-week programme based on the Nurturing Attachments Group devised by Kim Golding (DDP Consultant). We also offer specific workshops on understanding regulation, food and sleep issues for children who have experienced trauma.\n\nThe majority of the children we support have an allocated social worker. In order to receive support from the Enfys Team, we first invite a conversation between ourselves and the child’s social worker at one of our weekly Advice and Support consultations.\n\nAfter this initial conversation, where we decide together on how best to work together to meet the child/family’s needs, we may then offer ongoing support to parents/carers, meet with the rest of the system (e.g. school), work directly with the family, offer therapy, and so on.\n\nThe team are trained in specialist, evidence-based therapies for trauma.\n\nThe team supports young people who are experiencing high levels of distress, many of whom have sought safety in the Emergency Department.\n\nOur clinical vision is that we are formulation-driven, attachment and relationship-focused and are trauma and mental health specialists. The team consists of Occupational Therapists, Graduate Mental Health Workers, Clinical Psychologists, Social Work Assistants and Education Co-ordinators. We work in partnership with our Children’s Services colleagues in Cardiff and the Vale. The needs of the young people that we support are best understood through a developmental trauma lens and we ask, ‘What has happened to you?’ not ‘What is wrong with you?’.\n\nOur aim is to work alongside other professionals to co-produce a trauma-informed understanding of the young person’s story so that we can make sense of the function of a young person’s observable behaviours.\n\nOur goal in supporting the system that surrounds the young person is to soothe and contain distress by assisting it in ‘holding on’ to these young people.\n\nThe Hangout offers the following support:\n\nDrop-in support (at any point during opening hours)\n\nScheduled sessions with our wellbeing team\n\nWellbeing-focused groups\n\nGroup activity sessions\n\nVolunteering opportunities\n\nDrop-in: Mental health support, as well as information about the groups and volunteering opportunities available, can be accessed on a drop-in basis. Young people can access the hub at any point during opening hours to discuss what may be helpful for them with our team.\n\nYoung people who have been referred to mental health services and are waiting to be seen or are in-between appointments can also use The Hangout to access additional support.\n\nScheduled support and referrals: It’s also possible to schedule mental health support sessions. This can be done either through self-referral or referral by a professional who is working or supporting a young person.\n\nReferrals can also be made for access to groups, general support or simply to come and get familiar with the space and the things we offer — this may be helpful if a young person doesn’t feel comfortable attending a drop-in.\n\nThe Hangout can be found at 26-28 Churchill Way and is open every day from 3pm to 9pm. They are also open on bank holidays apart from Christmas Day (25/12), Boxing Day (26/12) and New Year’s Day (1/01).\n\nHowever, a reduced service between Christmas and New Year will be available so please contact the team to find out what support is available in December.\n\nThe Hangout is a place where young people can meet other people, find volunteering opportunities and get involved in groups that could really help boost their wellbeing.\n\nNo referral is needed to visit — young people can drop-in at any time.\n\nTo find out more:\n\nVisit: The Hangout – Platfform 4YP\n\nEmail: hangout@platfform.org\n\nCall: 0300 3732717\n\nThe Hangout team work closely with our other Emotional Wellbeing and Mental Health services for children and young people within Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. This means they are able to talk with other services to make sure young people receive the best support from the right people at the right time to ensure a holistic and complimentary approach to care delivered.\n\nReferral forms:\n\nOnce a referral form is completed, The Hangout team will contact the young person within 3 days to arrange an initial session on-site.\n\nSelf-referral: The Hangout – Get support (for young people) (office.com)\n\nReferral by support staff: The Hangout – get support for a young person (for those working with young people) (office.com)\n\nWe know that needing to wait can be challenging when you’ve asked for help, but we will try to see you as soon as we can.\n\nIf you are waiting and need some support, you can contact our Single Point of Access team by calling 02921 836730 Monday to Friday between 9 am – 5 pm (excluding bank holidays).\n\nWe offer a range of interventions using a variety of techniques. This is likely to be through group work initially, which may be followed by individual work if needed.\n\nAt the beginning of your journey with us, we will help you to set goals we are able to support you with achieving. We will review these regularly and if needed we will adapt your care.\n\nWhen you come to the end of your journey with us, we will take the time to review and plan your next steps.\n\nA significant portion of our work is working with education staff to deliver training, consultation and reflective practice as part of providing a whole school approach to emotional and mental wellbeing.\n\nThis work benefits learners and staff working in the education setting, even if young people do not directly work with one of our practitioners.\n\nIt may be that School In-Reach is best placed to support the learner, but the In-Reach practitioner may feel support is best provided by another service or organisation.\n\nIt could also be that the In-Reach practitioner works to build the capacity and confidence of those already involved with the learner, rather than introducing another person."
