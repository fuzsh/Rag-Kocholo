This includes people who work for the local authority such as teachers and social work practitioners, health practitioners, the police, probation services and others.\n\nIt is mandatory for all regulated health and social care professionals and teachers in Wales to report ‘known cases’ of female genital mutilation (FGM) in under 18s to the police (Home Office, 2016).\n\nReferences\n\nReferrals and investigations\n\nThe local authority child protection team has a legal duty to investigate any concerns referred to them.\n\nIf the child is not in immediate danger, there will be an initial assessment of the child’s needs.\n\nUnder Section 21 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014, the local authority has a statutory duty to assess the needs of a child if they appear to need additional support to that provided by their family.\n\nIf a child appears to be suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm the local authority has a duty to investigate under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989.\n\nAfter these investigations they will decide how to act. They may:\n\ntake no further child protection action if the child hasn’t been harmed and isn’t considered to be at risk of harm\n\nassess the child as a person who has a need for care and support. A child is assessed as in need of care and support if:\n\nthe need arises from circumstances such as their age or health, and:\n\nit relates to their personal wellbeing outcomes\n\nit cannot be met by their parents, wider family or community services\n\nit can only be met by their local authority arranging or providing the service or making direct payments.\n\nIf the child is eligible for a service a care and support plan must be agreed. This is required under Section 54 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.\n\nIf the child is in immediate danger the local authority or an authorised person (including the NSPCC) can take the following action through the courts:\n\nAn emergency protection order can be issued to immediately remove a child to a place of safety.\n\nAn exclusion order can be issued to remove the abuser from the family home.\n\nA child assessment order can be issued for a children’s social worker to assess the child’s needs without the parents’ or carers’ consent.\n\nThe police can remove a child to a place of safety for up to 72 hours without obtaining a court order.\n\nA female genital mutilation protection order (FGMPO) can be applied for through a family court and offers the means of protecting actual or potential victims from FGM under the civil law.\n\nCase conferences\n\nA case conference is held if the child is at risk of significant harm. At the case conference relevant professionals can share information, identify risks and outline what needs to be done to protect the child.\n\nIn Wales, this must happen within 15 working days from the start of the assessment.\n\nIf professionals at the initial case conference decide a child is at risk of significant harm they will add the child to the child protection register, and draw up a child protection plan.\n\nCase conferences will continue at regular intervals until the child is no longer considered at risk of significant harm or until they are taken into care.\n\nChild protection measures\n\nChild protection register\n\nIn Wales the child protection register (CPR) is a confidential list of all children in the local area who have been identified as being at risk of abuse, neglect or harm under one or more of the following categories:\n\nphysical abuse\n\nemotional or psychological abuse\n\nsexual abuse\n\nfinancial abuse\n\nneglect.\n\nThe CPR allows authorised individuals to check if a child they are working with is known to be at risk.\n\nIf a child is added to the CPR the practitioners working with them have a duty to inform the child’s social worker if there are any significant events or changes to the child’s circumstances.\n\nThe child must also have a child protection plan, which sets out what action needs to be taken by whom and when, in order to safeguard the child and promote their welfare.\n\nCare proceedings\n\nIf the local authority believes that a child is at risk of significant harm they may take the child into care to keep them safe.\n\nUnless the level of risk requires the courts to get involved immediately, extensive efforts will be made to keep the child with their family.\n\nA child can be taken into care voluntarily or under a care order.\n\nVoluntary accommodation\n\nA child may be taken into care voluntarily through Section 76 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.\n\nA local authority must provide accommodation for children who do not have anywhere suitable to live. This includes children who have nobody to look after them or whose parents are unable to look after them for a period of time, due to illness or other problems.\n\nUnder Section 76 a parent retains all their legal rights and can require the child’s return at any stage.\n\nGoing to court\n\nCare proceedings are usually held in the Family Court and more complex cases may be held in the High Court.\n\nThe court will make sure the child has a children's guardian. The guardian's job is to look after the child’s interests. If the child is judged to be mature enough they will also be allowed to appoint their own solicitor to represent their wishes.\n\nThe child's social worker will make a care plan to help the court decide how the child should be cared for.\n\nCare orders\n\nIf the courts agree that it's necessary, they can make an order giving the local authority parental responsibility for a child.\n\nInterim care order\n\nAfter the initial hearing the court may decide that an interim care order is needed to set out what should happen to the child during proceedings.\n\nThis is awarded for eight weeks initially and must be renewed every four weeks, allowing for investigation and further plans to be made. The social worker and an officer from the Children and Family Court advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) among others will try to understand why the child might be at risk and what can be done to keep them safe.\n\nThe social worker and Cafcass officer will then produce reports on what they think should happen to the child, after consulting with the parents, child and family and friends.\n\nThis will include whether they think the child should be taken into care or stay with the family.\n\nCare order\n\nThe court will only make a full care order if they are convinced:\n\nthe child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm\n\nmaking an order would be better for the child than making no order\n\nand that harm is due to either:\n\nthe care the child is receiving or likely to receive if the care order isn’t made; or\n\nthe child is beyond parental control.\n\nA care order gives the local authority shared parental responsibility with the parents, but the local authority has the power to decide how much involvement a parent should have with their child.\n\nOnce a care order has been made, the child’s care plan will be carried out.\n\nPlacement order\n\nThis allows a child to be placed with prospective adopters prior to an adoption order, should the local authority believe this is the best option for the child.\n\nAdoption order\n\nThis transfers parental responsibility to the adoptive parents. It’s only made by a court following extensive enquiries, based on the best interest of the child.\n\nAt the point of adoption the care order ends and the adoptive parents take over the sole parental responsibility.\n\nCare order duration\n\nUnless an adoption order is made or the child returns home, care orders last until the child turns 18. Local authorities have a duty to continue to promote the welfare of care-leavers until the age of 21.\n\nChild protection legislation and guidance in Wales\n\nLegislation\n\nChildren Act 1989\n\nIn Wales, the Children Act 1989 outlines when to initiate care proceedings and the duty of local authorities to safeguard and promote children’s welfare.\n\nMuch of the Children Act 1989 applies to both England and Wales. As of April 2016, Part 3 of the Act (which refers to support for children and families provided by local authorities) has been replaced by Part 6 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.\n\nChildren Act 2004\n\nThe Children Act 2004 strengthens this by encouraging partnerships between agencies and creating more accountability. A number of sections have been amended, repealed or replaced by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 and the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 contents, including the requirements for the establishment of local safeguarding children boards in Wales.\n\nSocial Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014\n\nThe Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 provides Wales with its own framework for social services by:\n\ngiving individuals a stronger voice and more control over the care and support they receive\n\nencouraging a renewed focus on prevention and early intervention.\n\nProvisions in the Act include:\n\nEstablishing a National Adoption Service.\n\nStrengthening powers for safeguarding children and vulnerable adults.\n\nIntroducing a National Outcomes Framework for setting out what children and families can expect from social services.\n\nThe Welsh Government adopted the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) as the basis for all policy relating to children and young people in 2004 (Welsh Government, 2019a; Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 1989).\n\nRights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011\n\nThe Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 requires the Welsh government to:\n\nhave due regard to the UNCRC in all its functions, including when developing or reviewing legislation and guidance\n\nbe responsible for making sure people in Wales know about the rights of children and young people as set out in the UNCRC.\n\n(Welsh Government, 2019a).\n\nThe Children's Commissioner for Wales has produced a framework to help children's services put children's rights at the centre of decision making (Children's Commissioner for Wales, 2021).\n\nPolicy and guidance\n\nWorking together to safeguard people\n\nWorking together to safeguard people is the statutory guidance in relation to Part 7 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. This Welsh Government guidance covers the protection of adults and children. The volumes that cover safeguarding children are:\n\nVolume 1: Introduction and overview (Welsh Government, 2019b)\n\nVolume 2: Child Practice Reviews (Welsh Government, 2019c)\n\nVolume 5: Handling individual cases to protect children at risk (Welsh Government, 2019d)\n\nVolume 7: Safeguarding children from child sexual exploitation (Welsh Government, 2021).\n\nWales Safeguarding Procedures and Practice Guides\n\nThis guidance, first published in 2019 by the Wales Safeguarding Procedures Project Board, provides a common set of child and adult protection procedures and practice guides for every safeguarding board in Wales.\n\nThe Procedures relating to children and young people at risk of harm are divided into six sections, covering:\n\nsafeguarding principles and effective practice (section 1)\n\nthe duty to report a child at risk of abuse, neglect and/or harm (section 2)\n\nresponding to a report of a child at risk of harm, abuse and/or neglect (section 3 part 1)\n\ndecision making and initial child protection conferences (section 3 part 2)\n\nplanning and intervention for children on the child protection register (section 4)\n\nsafeguarding allegations/concerns about practitioners and those in positions of trust (section 5).\n\nThe procedures contain ‘pointers for practice’ which provide information on how to complete safeguarding tasks. They have been designed to enable frontline practitioners and their managers apply the legislative requirements and expectations of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.\n\nThe All Wales Practice Guides on safeguarding children, which forms section 6 of the procedures, provides guidance on specific issues for practitioners working with children and young people:\n\nchild criminal exploitation (CCE)\n\nabuse related to cultural or religious beliefs\n\nchild trafficking\n\ndomestic abuse\n\nneglect\n\nonline abuse\n\nharmful sexual behaviour\n\nhome education\n\nchildren who go missing from home or care\n\nchild sexual exploitation (CSE)\n\n(Wales Safeguarding Procedures Project Board, 2021).\n\nKeep up-to-date with new legislation and guidance by signing up to CASPAR, our current awareness service for policy, practice and research.\n\n> Find out more about the key legislation guidance for schools"
