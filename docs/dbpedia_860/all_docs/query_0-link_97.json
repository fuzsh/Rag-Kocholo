        "text": "If you're referred to hospital or other NHS premises for specialist NHS treatment or diagnostic tests by a doctor, dentist or another primary care health professional, you may be able to claim a refund of reasonable travel costs under the Healthcare Travel Costs Scheme (HTCS).\n\nThis page explains who's eligible for the scheme and how to make a claim.\n\nIf you have questions about help with health costs, contact the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) online or call 0300 330 1343. They will respond to your queries Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm and Saturday, 9am to 3pm.\n\nWho can claim for help with travel costs?\n\nTo qualify for help with travel costs under the HTCS, you must meet 3 criteria:\n\nAt the time of your appointment, you or your partner (including civil partners) must receive one of the qualifying benefits or allowances listed on this page, or meet the eligibility criteria for the NHS Low Income Scheme.\n\nYou must have a referral for specialist care from a healthcare professional to a specialist or a hospital for further NHS treatment or tests (often referred to as secondary care).\n\nYour appointment must be on a separate visit to when the referral was made. This applies whether your treatment is provided at a different location (hospital or clinic) or on the same premises as where the GP or another health professional issued the referral.\n\nChildren and other dependants\n\nYou can claim travel costs for your children if you're eligible for any of the benefits described under condition 1 and your child has been referred for treatment as outlined in condition 2 and condition 3 above.\n\nIf your child is aged 16 or over, they may make their own claim under the Low Income Scheme.\n\nCarers and escorts\n\nYou can claim travel costs for an escort if your healthcare professional says it's medically necessary for someone to travel with you.\n\nSome integrated care boards (ICBs) may accept claims for help with travel costs if you're the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16 who you have to bring with you to your appointment.\n\nThese payments are made on the basis of the patient's eligibility for the scheme, irrespective of the escort's eligibility.\n\nWho cannot claim help with travel costs?\n\nYou cannot claim help with travel costs if you're visiting someone in hospital.\n\nYou also cannot claim if you're visiting a GP, dentist or another primary care service provider for routine check-ups or other services, such as vaccinations or cervical cancer screening, as these are excluded from the scheme.\n\nUrgent primary care services during out-of-hours periods (between 6.30pm and 8pm on weekdays, weekends or bank holidays) are also excluded.\n\nWhat are the qualifying benefits and allowances?\n\nYou can claim help with travel costs if you or your partner (including civil partner) receive any of the following benefits:\n\nIncome Support\n\nincome-based Jobseeker's Allowance\n\nincome-related Employment and Support Allowance\n\nPension Credit Guarantee Credit\n\nyou receive Universal Credit and meet the criteria\n\nYou can also claim for help with travel costs if:\n\nyou're named on, or entitled to, an NHS tax credit exemption certificate (if you do not have a certificate, you can show your award notice) – you qualify if you get child tax credits, working tax credits with a disability element (or both), and have income for tax credit purposes of £15,276 or less\n\nyou have a low income and are named on certificate HC2 (full help) or HC3 (limited help) – you can apply for these certificates through the NHS Low Income Scheme\n\nFind out more about NHS tax credit exemption certificates on the NHSBSA website.\n\nFind out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme.\n\nWhat form of transport can I use?\n\nThe NHS organisation handling your claim will normally base any refund on what would have been the cheapest suitable mode of transport for your circumstances.\n\nThis can include your age, medical condition or any other relevant factors, such as the availability of public transport.\n\nThis means you should use the cheapest, most appropriate means of transport, which in most cases will be public transport.\n\nIf you travelled by car and your claim was approved, you'll be reimbursed for the cost of fuel at the mileage rate used by your local integrated care board (ICB).\n\nYou may also be able to claim for unavoidable car parking and toll charges.\n\nIf you need to use a taxi, you should agree this in advance with the hospital or ICB before you travel.\n\nPatients in London may be able to claim reimbursement of congestion charges or Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) charges. Get more information on reimbursements of the Congestion Charge and ULEZ charge on the Transport for London website.\n\nHelp with similar schemes in other areas may be available – check with your ICB.\n\nHelp with travel costs before your appointment\n\nYou're expected to pay for your travel and claim back the costs within 3 months.\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to get an advanced payment to help you attend your appointment.\n\nThe NHS service providing your treatment should be able to tell you how to apply. Alternatively, contact your local ICB for advice.\n\nHow do I claim a refund?\n\nTo claim your travel costs, take your travel receipts, appointment letter or card, plus proof that you're receiving one of the qualifying benefits, to a nominated cashiers' office.\n\nNominated cashiers' offices are located in the hospital or clinic that treated you. They'll assess your claim and make the payment directly to you.\n\nIn some hospitals, the name of the office you need to go to may be different (for example, the General Office or the Patient Affairs Office).\n\nIf you're not sure, ask reception or Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALS) staff where you should go.\n\nSome hospitals and clinics do not have cashier facilities. In this case, you can complete an HC5(T) travel refund form and post it to the address stated on the form.\n\nYou can make a postal claim up to 3 months after your appointment took place.\n\nDownload an HC5(T) form to claim necessary costs of travel for NHS treatment from NHSBSA website.\n\nCan I claim travel expenses for treatment abroad?\n\nIf you're travelling abroad for treatment on the NHS, you may be able to claim for travel costs incurred travelling from your home to the international railway station, port or airport where you leave Great Britain and your international journey begins.\n\nThis is treated the same as if you were travelling from home to receive NHS care in Great Britain. You can claim for these costs if you would normally qualify for help with travel costs through the HTCS.\n\nThe cost of your travel from the port in Great Britain to the place of treatment abroad falls within NHS foreign travel expenses and cannot be claimed through the HTCS.\n\nNHS foreign travel expenses are necessary travel expenses that a person incurs when travelling abroad from a port in Great Britain to receive services arranged by the NHS.\n\nYou'll only be entitled to have NHS foreign travel expenses paid for when the health service body that made the arrangements for services to be provided overseas agrees the mode and cost of travel, and the necessity or otherwise for a companion. This all has to happen before the costs are incurred.\n\nFind out more about going abroad for medical treatment."
