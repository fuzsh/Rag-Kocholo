        "text": "The main entrance to the hospital is on Guilford Street. The address and postcode for the entrance is Morgan Stanley Clinical Building, Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH.\n\nThe map below shows you where the entrance is and the locations of our other hospital buildings - the Sight and Sound Centre, the Zayed Centre for Rare Diseases and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, where some outpatient clinics are located.\n\nThe entrance on Great Ormond Street is closed while we construct our new Children's Cancer Centre and main entrance.\n\nThis page provides more information about which entrance may be best for you.\n\nBlue badge holders can park in a bay (residents parking bays, pay and display bays, or designated disabled bays) for an unlimited amount of time. Parking is only permitted for 3 hours if you are parking on a single yellow line. The badge and the clock should be displayed clearly on the vehicle’s dashboard.\n\nFind out more about Blue Badges on Camden Council's website.\n\nWalking is the cheapest – and can also be the most pleasant and fun – way to travel in London. To plan your walking route to the hospital from other locations you can use Google maps which allows you to search for the least polluted routes.\n\nWatch the walk from the old GOSH entrance on Great Ormond Street to our alternative entrance on Guilford street, which will be in use from 19 February 2024.\n\nGOSH is located near to several mainline stations, underground stations, and bus stops. The easiest way to plan your travel in London is to use the Transport for London (TfL) Journey planner. It allows you to plan routes between stations and postcodes. It also allows you to specify preferences for modes of transport (including walking and cycling) and accessibility requirements (such as step-free transport).\n\nThere are cycle racks on Queen Square, Great Ormond Street and Guilford Street. When these are in operation, you can hire bikes in London using Santander Cycles and there are docking stations all over central London, and all you need is a bank card to get started.\n\nThe nearest docking station to the hospital is on Guilford Street.\n\nIf you have issues with mobility and have trouble using public transport, you may be able to get subsidised taxi and minicab travel in London. The two schemes are called Taxicard and Capital Call.\n\nLondon's traditional taxis (black cabs) can be booked in advance, hailed on the street, or picked up from designated taxi ranks. Black Cabs are also disabled friendly as they have access ramps to wheelchairs and will be willing to help those with disabilities.\n\nThe cheapest and easiest way to travel on public transport in London is to use a contactless payment card (issued by many banks) or an Oyster (pre-pay) card. Paying for a paper ticket can be several times more expensive than using these methods\n\nBuses in London are now entirely cash-free, so use of a contactless card, and Oyster card, or a previously purchased paper travelcard is necessary.\n\nWe provide non-emergency medical transport where any other method of getting to and from GOSH would be damaging to the patient’s health.\n\nPlease ask your family doctor (GP) to arrange transport to GOSH if your child requires it to attend an outpatient appointment. If your child is coming for an inpatient stay, our staff will organise this. Unfortunately, we cannot accept bookings from anyone else.\n\nFor additional information on non-emergency patient transport services and whether you and your child are eligible, please see the NHS England website."
