        "text": "The construction site location and its relationship to the existing Hospital posed many construction challenges in terms of access and egress within a tight working space and the close proximity to adjacent buildings and Heath Park Way.\n\nRedundant paediatric wards, renal and cardiac departments, and associated offices were all located within the site footprint and were demolished by Tilbury Douglas under an enabling works contract, which also included decant works, asbestos removal, alteration and extension to existing facilities, refurbishment of wards, and a new temporary link corridor.\n\nOur team had to engage early with the end user and our design team to ensure maximum value and a state-of-the-art facility. Weekly end user meetings were held during contract delivery.\n\nOur team had to react to a number of emergencies and provide much needed assistance to the Hospital. Extremely heavy rainfall resulted in large volumes of water pouring through the ceiling of the top floor of the adjacent hospital building causing the ceiling to partially collapse. This water then cascaded to a lesser extent through all three floors below.\n\nDue to the relationship built up with the supervisors of the wards during the decant contract, our project team were the first people called upon to help. The response was immediate and a detachment of operatives, staff and subcontractors all carrying mops/brushes and vacuums worked until 9pm to clean up. Within five days, thanks to the efforts of the team the main wards were fully operational again."
