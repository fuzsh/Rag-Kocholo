        "text": "The Paediatric Emergency Unit at the University Hospital of Wales is the biggest emergency unit specifically for children under the age of 16 in Wales.\n\nSeeing over 35,000 children and their families each year, the Paediatric Emergency Unit is committed to providing world-class care. The service provides emergency care and treatment to children aged 0 â€“ 15 for the full range of clinical presentations, including medical illnesses, mental health problems and minor injuries through to major trauma.\n\nIn 2020, University Hospital Wales (UHW), Cardiff was appointed as the Paediatric Major Trauma centre for South Wales, providing care to the most severely injured children from across the region. Since then, we have delivered care to over 120 children a year via the South Wales Trauma Network, in addition to those severely sick and injured children brought to hospital via Wales Ambulance Services NHS Trust (WAST).\n\nThe Paediatric Emergency Unit includes a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals who are specialised in delivering emergency paediatric care. The team is made up of specialist consultants, junior doctors, paediatric nursing teams and healthcare assistants. The Paediatric Emergency Unit is supported by an experienced management and leadership team within the Emergency Unit and Medicine Clinical Board and we operate in close partnership with the Adult Emergency Department at UHW, with many team members working across both adult and paediatric teams."
