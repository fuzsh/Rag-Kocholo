        "text": "Adele Jergens is undoubtedly one of the better known actresses featured on this site. There is plenty of info about her on the internet, and her career is well covered. So why choose her? First, she is obscure to the general audience of today. Second, Adele was such a likable, interesting actress, a gal who could have gone much further had some opportunities knocked on her door. Actresses who suffered similar fates were a dime a dozen in Hollywood ‚Äì and I hope to profile more of these as time goes by. Adele is first on the list.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nAdele Louisa Jurgens was born on November 26, 1917, in Ridgewood, Brooklyn, New York City, New York to August and Marie Adele Jurgens. She was the only daughter among four sons.\n\nAdele grew up as a tomboy, playing baseball with her brothers. However, her home life was anything but easy ‚Äì her father was a difficult man and could barely afford to support the family. Adele attended Southside High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Grover Cleveland High School.\n\nAdele took ballet classes, but deemed her temperament ill suited for the art, so took to dancing in burlesque. At 14 she won a scholarship to Manhattan‚Äôs Albertina Rasch Dance School. Naturally gifted and very ambitious, she was barely 15 years old when she got the nickname ‚Äúthe girl with the million-dollar legs‚Äù.\n\nSoon, her hard work paid off and she was steadily working as a chorine in Brooklyn Fox Theatre and the Ziegfeld Follies. To supplement her income, she signed with the John Robert Powers modeling agency. She also worked briefly as a Rockette, and was named the city‚Äôs leading showgirl. She was an understudy of the legendary dancer, Gypsy Rose Lee.\n\nAdele hit it big when she was named ‚ÄúMiss World‚Äôs Fairest‚Äù at the 1939 World Fair. Not long after, she was to become a famous war time pin up. This catapulted her into Hollywood.\n\nCAREER:\n\nThere are several well written accounts of Adele‚Äôs career, much better than any I could write about, so I decided to put a link to this fabulous pdf on Alan K. Rode‚Äôs site. Check it out by all means! Adele was one of the legendary femme fatales during the golden age of film noir and she acted opposite quite a number of hefty actors! She even played Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs mother in a movie! Another great article about Adele is on the Films of the golden age site. Go and read it now üôÇ\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nIn an interesting twist of fate, Adele was often compared to Virginia Mayo in terms of looks ‚Äì both were round faced, soft looking blondes ‚Äì and in real life, the two were good friend, dating from their shared New York chorus girls days. Despite being physically similar, they were diametrically opposite when personality was concerned ‚Äì Adele was a boisterous, simple, gregarious girl who liked to have fun and dated guys by the bucket load from her earliest years ‚Äì Virginia was a quiet, unassuming girl who rarely went out, was very devoted to her family and did not have any serious beaus.\n\nAdele first hit the papers in March 1937, when she was dating George Hale. Hale had a fine eye for ladies, and specialized in finding diamonds in the rough. He allegedly took Adele from a Brooklyn high school play and launched her into a full fledged chorus girl. Adele was liked by the boys and dated constantly during the late 1930s.\n\nIn 1939, while making a picture for Columbia, she was allegedly infatuated with a Brazilian businessman. In 1940, she added Franchot Tone and Burgess Meredith to her line of erstwhile admirers. On an ironic note, George Hale, who had been dating Adele for two years by then, but was too busy to commit, introduced her to Tone, claiming he was a perfect gentleman, just the kind of a man to make a woman feel nice and to take her out. Then Franchot and Adele hit it off and dated every night! George was left dangling‚Ä¶\n\nBy August 1940, Adele was fed up with Franchot, and was one of many girls that Victor Mature dated (along with Betty Grable and Phyllis Brooks). Drop in a few dates with lothario Bruce Cabot in the mix.\n\nIn 1941, Adele first dated Al Jolson (funny, considering that her former boyfriend Hale was suing him!), and then Orrin Lehmann fell for her like a ton of bricks. No luck for Orrin ‚Äì Adele liked Al better and dated him for several months. Jolson lived the prestige California-Florida-New York relation, and this gave Adele the perfect opportunity to date other swains while he was in another town ‚Äì and often a different man every night! Plus, she also went on tour with him, just to keep close. Oh Al!\n\nThey had a brief tiff in May, got together again, and Jolson asked Adele to marry him in June. Yes, it was that serious for Al. But was it for Adele? While she said yes to his proposal, no wedding date was set, and Adele enjoyed a sojourn in South America in August. On board with her were other pretty showgirls, like Nancy Hill and Peggy Healy, and the famous Brazilian money bags, Joege Guinle. Imagine the fun! She came back to Al, naturally, but it did not yell. They broke up in September.\n\nIn October, Adele caught Tony Martin‚Äôs fancy. They were a charming couple, dancing together in Los Angeles nightclubs. In Early 1942, she was seen with Horacee Schmidlapp, a decidedly non handsome, but rich and charming fellow, future husband of Carole Landis. He gave her a fur coat (how can any woman resist a fur coat!). But, her real heartthrob remained a mystery ‚Äì a columnist even teased that his real identity would cause quite a splash. This man gifted her with a mink coat and a bracelet (she obviously had several mink coats).\n\nIn April 1942, Dorothy Killgallen wrote a long piece on Adele, the proof of her then popularity. We learned that she is the most dated chorus girl, and that many of her admirers were rich and famous (duh!), and that many of them want to marry her after the first few dates. Obviously Adele was not swayed by money that easily, and turned them down quite a few (something I admire her infinitely for‚Ä¶ GO ADELE!). Once an admirer asked her to pinch him so he could he sure he was not dreaming, and she pinched him so hard, it proved to be their last date üôÇ She was a big eater, enjoyed fine food, and her mother served her breakfast in bed every day at 11:30. She lived in Upper Manhattan, her father worked in a real estate office. Her nick name was Addie.\n\nShe preferred men in their thirties, and they have to be good conversationalists. She does not care if they are good dancers or not. She impressed Franchot Tone by her eating habits ‚Äì he called her ‚ÄúBeauty and the feast‚Äù. Adele is a fine singer, does not like cocktail parties and prefers golf, horseback riding and loved to travel. She goes to work in IRS, but goes back mostly in her admirer‚Äôs limousines. She drinks tow bottles of beer a day, never drinks more than two cocktails, can drink a lot of champagne and smokes in moderation. Her favorite drink is a Black and White and Soda.\n\nHer favorite people are Roosevelt, Buddy De Silva and Eddie Cantor. Her favorite movie is Gone with The Wind, and she loves to read, especially Marcel Proust, but never has time to read any more (was this really true remains to be seen). One day she wants to be married, and her future husband has to first and foremost be a nice guy, his wealth comes way second.\n\nDuring that time, Adele was madly in love with a saxophone player from the Freddy Martin band. Feted by playboys and millionaires, and she loved a hard working boy, so cute! The relationship lasted until the end of summer.\n\nNow, we come into a very sketchy and muddled part of Adele‚Äôs life, and understandably so. Somehow, she met a Washington DC bigwig. A married bigwig. The two started an affair in early autumn 1942. While they were low key, word was soon to spread that somebody high up in Washington was dating Adele. The news broke in January 1943, but he could not be named. By April 1943, Adele told friends that he would divorced his wife and marry her. No such luck, the unknown man chickened out and they broke up. Adele was heartbroken, but marched on.\n\nBy June, she was involved with an East Coast meat packing millionaire. In January 1944, Adele cut short her Hollywood career to go back to New York, to be close to a certain bandleader. By September he was ancient history, and RAF ace Willy Bidell took his place. By October, Adele was back in Hollywood, and in a weird twist of fate, the bandleader she originally pursued now pursued her and moved to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the housing in Los Angeles was so scarce that Adele and her mom, who was chaperoning her, had to sleep in a wardrobe room on the lot!\n\nRay Sinatra, Frankie‚Äôs cousin, was the next stop in Adele‚Äôs amorous adventures. The press claimed the two would get married in January 1945, but she debunked them by saying that Ray was already married to his wife. What a bummer! She continued with Jerry Marks, but left him after a few short dates ‚Äì sadly, Marks carried a torch for Adele for some time afterwards!\n\nAdele liked her new life in Hollywood. She noted that, while living on New York, she never got up before noon, even if there was matinee performance that day. In direct contrast, now she had to get up at 6 so she could be at the studio at 7, and work until 6 pm. She had to go through make up, hairdressing and costume fitting, and the filming was pretty strenuous. After work, she would only have time for dinner and maybe an early show, but she was firmly in bed before midnight. Her studio wanted to build her to become a rival to Maria Montez ‚Äì considered the most mesmerizing, seductive girl in Hollywood of that time. Predictably, the papers also build a rivalry between her and Yvonne de Carlo. Petty, but it‚Äôs a story we‚Äôve seen a hundred time in Hollywood and will probably see hundred times more. She was also revealed to be a serious ice cream lover.\n\nIn April 1945, Adele was seen with producer Ross Hunter, the former date of Jane Withers. Yet, Ray Sinatra was always dangling in the background. He had been separated for many years from his wife, but could not get a divorce. The papers were abuzz with the news tat he wanted to marry Adele, but had to wait for his divorce to come through.\n\nIn 1946, Adele dated Jack Dennison, Bill White, producer Raymond Hakim and Ray Rossbach (related to baseball great Hank Greenburg by marriage). She was also visited by her old flame, Orrin Lehmann, in August. She went back briefly to New York after this. October was reserved for Morton Downey. On a funny note, Adele had to dash before midnight to catch a tram that would take her to her brother‚Äôs Long Island home. She left to Chicago first, for four days of fun, before returning to Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 1947, she was going steady with Tom Cassara. The affair lasted until July 1947, and it was from the looks of it, a serious one. Phillip Reed was her escort in August. Ross Hunter briefly came back to her life about that time. Some hand holding in the public, but not much more. Soon, she was at hand to console Milton Pickman ‚Äì Pickman was sacked by his fiancee, Nan Wynn. In November she resumed her romance with director Jackson Halliday, whom she sort of started to date in June.\n\nIn early 1948, she dated actor Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Scott, and then took up with actor Ron Randell. Soon, Don McGuire was added to the roster. Scott ended up the most serious of her beaus, and friends were pretty sure the two would end up betrothed. Just when you thought, that‚Äôs it, Adele is finally going to get married, puff, another man enters the scene ‚Äì Judd Downey, the legal eagle of Los Angeles. He took over the marriage sweepstakes from poor Bob, and now he was allegedly to become Adele‚Äôs husband. In April, the papers were pretty sure the two would wed. Yet, by June she was dating architect George Hyam and there was no additional mention of Downey. As they say, easy come, easy go. Also worth noting is that Hyam designed several dresses for Adele. Not long after, Adele changed her hair color from blonde to brunette.\n\nMilton Berle briefly took over from Hyam in late July, but by August she was already seen another man, Clinton Bagwell. Scott Brady also entered the scene about that time. Adele was sent everywhere in Hollywood by her studio for publicity ‚Äì for instance, she was there for a drug store opening, and won a specially made lotion!\n\nIn 1949, Adele continued her man enchanting ways. She and Johnny Gibbs were often seen at the nightclubs, and especially loved to hear Liberace playing the piano. She was still seeing George Hyam on the sly. Adele was also a tennis fan and often attended tennis events at the Wiltshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. In 1949, something nasty happened to Adele ‚Äì she wanted to enter an eleator, and stopped herself at the last moment ‚Äì the elevator shaft was empty! Despite the shock, she attended a charity function at Ciros later and modeled clothes to raise money. Ron Randell then entered her life again. Like her, he was a former Columbia contractee who went on to free lace. In August, Adele developed a crush on a Brazilian businessman, but nothing came out of it. In September, she was robbed and the thieves made way with several of her mink coats and jewelry. Later that month Adele ended a short romance with a wealthy San Francisco man and returned his diamonds (in a bucket :-P)\n\nAlso in 1949, Adele was involved with Ronald Reagan ‚Äì and the same old stories happened again ‚Äì Ronald was crazy for Adele and wanted to marry her, but she was not to keen on the idea. It seems that the right man, her prince on the white horse, had not yet come.\n\n1950 started on a working note. Adele worked so hard she fainted on the set of one of her movies. The doctor ordered rest and relaxation afterwards. She was even in ‚Äúnegotiations‚Äù with the handsome, wealthy Robert Goelet Jr. about appearing in one of his movies filmed in Rome. She also volunteer in a cancer clinic without much fanfare and danced with the Fashionettes, a troupe that donated all it‚Äôs earnign to charitable cuases.\n\nBy mid 1950, her romance with her one time co star, Glenn Langan, was out. The girl who was a constant bachelorette for years and whom no man could tame had finally found her match. Langan, who was neither rich nor especially popular, caught her heart. In this regard, Adele was truly one of the few actresses who claimed they were not after wealthy man, and they really were not ‚Äì and this proves it.\n\nThe romances blossomed nicely for the second part of 1950 and early 1951. One reported even wrote that Adele has two shadows now ‚Äì her own and Glen‚Äôs. After a small tiff in May (the papers were cryptic about their separation, like even the gossip columnists did not believe the two were over for good). In July, Adele was even seen with another man, Mickey Stokey, a TV personality. My own guess was that she tried the oldest trick ‚Äì making Glen jealous, as they were not over with each other.\n\nAdele attended the marriage of actress Sally Forrest and Milo Frank and cached the bride`s bouquet. It was a dead give away. She married Langan on October 6, 1951.\n\nTheir only son, Tracy T. Langan, was born on September 11, 1952. Adele took it slowly after this, semi retiring with her family in Encino.\n\nShe and Langan had a happy marriage that lasted until his death on January 19, 1991. She never remarried.\n\nHer son Tracy was an active, much beloved member of the Hollywood community along with his wife Cynthia. As a Mr. Roy Wagner posted on Tracy‚Äôs imdb page:\n\nOne of the greatest and most legendary figures in the history of camera support. Tracy was instrumental in the success of so many directors of photography, including myself. No matter what the cost he would make sure that your project had what was necessary to do a good job. I would not have the success that I have had without his extraordinary assistance. He was the backbone of Panavision.\n\nRoy H. Wagner ASC\n\ndirector of photography\n\nAdele‚Äôs health started to fail in the late 1990s. In 2001, Tracy died. It was a huge blow for her, one from which she never recovered.\n\nAdele Langan died on November 22, 2002, just weeks before her 85th birthday.\n\nMerle McHugh was a girl who had connection in Tinsel town, her father being a prominent newspaperman who was a friend of Hedda Hopper and other social columnists. She was pretty, not without talent and had some stage experience. What went wrong? It‚Äôs the million dollar question nobody knows the answer to, but bottom line is, Merle McHugh made only two very brief appearances in movies before sliding into total obscurity.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nMerle McHugh was born in 1927 in New York to Eugene ‚ÄúGene‚Äù McHugh and Merle Trillard. Her father was the managing editor of the New York Daily News, and her mother was born from an union of a Frenchman and an English lady. Merle was a beautiful child much loved by her parents and nicknamed Scoop.\n\nMerle started working as a copyright girl at the New York Daily News, courtesy of her father. Yet, Merle was unhappy with the job and wanted to go to the stage. She took lessons in Shakespearean theater, but wisely pondered that maybe going to the chorus gave her better chances at reaching her ultimate goal, Hollywood. She modeled on the side to make extra money.\n\nIn late 1945, Merle was a Broadway newcomer at the Latin Quarter, vying for bigger and better things. She came to some prominence in 1946, when she was first mentioned in Walter Winchell‚Äòs column. Pretty soon, she was summoned to Hollywood to have a screen test with MGM. Unfortunately, before the scheduled flight to Tinsel town and fame, she fell and dislocated her spinal vertebrae. The result ‚Äì a period of six weeks rest wearing a neck brace. The injury was quite serious, so she went to consult a specialist in Norwalk, Connecticut, where she lived with her uncle and aunt, Edn and Jay Erman, (Edna was her mother‚Äôs sister), for a week. While there, Walter Pidgeon, famous actor who knew her from New York, send her flowers and a note wishing for a speedy recovery. Not a girl to be easily discouraged, she patiently waited until she was better and was off to Hollywood in May 1946.\n\nCAREER:\n\nPretty slim in this department, Merle made only two appearances in movies, and both uncredited. As I said several times already, what a waste!\n\nCopacabana is a Grouch Marx/Carmen Miranda movie that only works when Groucho is playing his usual Marx brothers persona, and when Miranda is doing her electric musical numbers. The rest ‚Äì the story, supporting characters, and more or less everything else ‚Äì falls flat like a deflated balloon. Merle plays one of the Copa girls, and, of course, she simply drowns in the sea of pretties.\n\nIn Living in a Big Way, we have all the right ingredients for a hit ‚Äì Gregory LaCava in his last credit, Gene Kelly at the time when he did hit after hit, and Marie McDonald, no great actress but a vivacious, endearing presence in most of her movies, with a body to die for (hence her nickname, The Body). The end result is only barely passable, and considering who is involved in it, it‚Äôs pretty much downright bad. Okay, maybe it‚Äôs not that bad ‚Äì it can hardy go into the Hall of Worst Movies Ever Made, but could have been so much better. Saving grace of the movie is definetly Kelly, always sensually elegant in his dancing and a true gentleman in his demeanor.\n\nMerle found no further luck in Hollywood, and left the film world for good.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nWhen Merle hit Hollywood, she was chaperoned everywhere by a family friend, Lieutenant Charles Sweeney, the man who dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Another man who liked her was composer Sam Coslow, who wanted to write a song especially for her in her first feature, Copacabana. Of course, he did not, but at least he tried üôÇ\n\nLike many starlets of the day, Merle tried the ‚Äúless clothes, more flesh‚Äù approach to achieve any level of recognition. As she told a TV presenter, ‚ÄúNothing succeeds like excess‚Äù. Of course, this is for the most part a wrong way to gain fame and fortune, Merle ultimately failing a victim to it, getting a bit of newspaper publicity but making no lasting impression on nobody.\n\nIn 1952, long after her career was over, Merle made headlines by getting sick on a yacht owned by her then boyfriend, wealthy East coast socialite Eric Piper, and having to be rescued by the Coastal guard via a plane. The plane was flying at five feet over the waters, and a raft was dropped down that paddled to the Sandpiper. She was taken into the Salem Hospital. She was suffered internal hemorrhaging, but was said to have been fine later that same day. The Sandpiper, an auxiliary yacht (known as a ketch to the sea wolves), a 65 foot beauty, was sailing to Sciatuate, Masschusets.\n\nMerle announced she would marry Piper as soon as she left the hospital. Piper was a good catch by anyone‚Äôs standards, not too old (he was 42 then), and a member of the Boston Brahmin. I found no traces of the union, so while it is possible it took place sometime, I highly doubt it.\n\nIn 1958, Merle married Jack Leon Medoff. Medoff was born on June 21, 1924, in Massachusetts to Katie and David Medoff.\n\nMerle and Jack did not have any children and divorced in the early 1960s.\n\nMerle McHugh died in the 1970s in New York.\n\nMedoff died on August 7, 2001.\n\nMerle Medoff is very probably alive today and living in Closter, New Yersey.\n\nOvershadowed by her more popular sister (Anita Colby), Francine Counihan was still a well known model of the 1940s and 1950s, who, with several fellow models, helped usher the golden age of modeling and made an lasting impact on the US advertising world.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nFrancine Lynn Counihan was born on November 18, 1915 in Washington, DC, to Daniel Francis Counihan and Margaret Ann McCarthy. Her father, nicknamed Bud, was a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. Her older sister Anita was born on August 5, 1914.\n\nThey family lived in Washington, DC. The girls mother, Margaret, was a very conservative and strict disciplinarian: they were bred to be perfect ladies, always thinking of propriety, with a perfect carriage and maintaining their decorum at all times. It was forbidden to swear or use any ‚Äúunladylike‚Äù language.\n\nUnder Anita‚Äôs tutelage, Francine started modeling in 1935. As she later reccounted:\n\nColby started me in ‚Äô35. Conover said, ‚ÄòHave her come with you on one of the jobs and I‚Äôll talk to her.‚Äô I was eighteen, and Colby was nineteen. Conover said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre crazy if you don‚Äôt start modeling. There‚Äôs so much money in it.‚Äô Well, in those days it was five dollars for an hour and a half. So I went to Powers. He was very interested in people, and he was interested in you being successful. He was a great morale builder. I went into everything. Fashion shows; Sears, Roebuck; Vogue; Harper‚Äôs Bazaar; all the catalogs. I went to Canada, and I went to Arizona‚Äîany place that there was money.\n\nThe girls were social butterflies of New York, frequenting all the places high society cold be seen in: Twenty-one,‚Äô Stork Club, El Morocco, Plaza Hotel. Yet, when they went for dates, it was forbidden to go without a chaperone ‚Äì if Francine wanted to go out with a man, she had to find a date for Anita so they could chaperone each other. Imagine the many awkward situations that came out of this!\n\nAnita decided to try her luck in Hollywood (she would have better luck as a heartbreaker than an actress), and Francine followed suit.\n\nCAREER:\n\nAgain, I quote some of the previous posts about her movie career:\n\nHer first credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting roles in A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it‚Äôs a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nFrancine was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Eileen McClory, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Cecilia Meagher, Anita Colby, Karen Gaylord and so on.\n\nFrancine returned to New York after this and never had another Hollywood role.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nOn January 5, 1936, at just 20 years old, Francine married Robert J. Riordan in Manhattan, New York. Riordan, born in 1912, was the son of a banker, who finished 2 years of colledge and never graduated. The couple lived in New York, and soon Francine was the main breadwinner in the family.\n\nTheir son Robert J. Riordan Jr. was born on October 11, 1936. Their daughter, Francine Lynn, was born in 1940.\n\nFrancine continued to model, but only for the money. As she told author Michael Gross for his book, Model, the ugly business of beautiful women:\n\nColby was more glamorous than I was. I thought glamour was fine, but I wanted the money. She was doing a lot of Vogue and a lot of Harper‚Äôs. I was more commercial, and she was more high-fashion. I made a lot of money. See, for me, being a model wasn‚Äôt as important as the money. I had a seven-room apartment in New York, I had two children in private school.\n\nFrancine and Robert‚Äôs marriage was not a stable one and they separated in 1941. They remained separated for six years, until 1947. In the interim, Francine occasionally dated somebody who caught her fancy. In 1946, she was a duet with Richard Carolson, just out of the army.\n\nFrancine varied the color of her hair through her long modeling career. She was originally a light brunette, but changed the color to ash blonde in the mid 1940s. She got back to blonde in 1949, just before the end of her career.\n\nFrancine married John B. Okie in 1949. Okie was born on August 27, 1914, in Marshall, Virginia. He was an OSS operative during World War II and an international businessman afterwards. They met when Francine and Anita sailed to Europe on a luxury ocean liner (wth many other dignitaries like Rita Hayworth, an Indian maharaja, the Churchills and so on). Churchill was pretty impressed by the sisters, and even gave them a signed copy of his book about painting! There is a funny story concerning the camaraderie between the sisters and the maharajah: he was a free wheeling, great spender type of a fellow, but his government forbade him to spend any more more on women an d gambling as he was deeply in debt. Known for showering ladies with jeweles, he met the two sisters, liked them a great lot, but could not give them the customary rubies or diamonds. The girls, when they came to England, as a consolation, they send him a crystal nipped from a chandelier!\n\nLets go back to Fancine and John. They lived for a time in Connecticut, before moving to Kent, Rhode Island. Thier mansion in Kent featured a huge swimming pool beyond a set of magnificent floor-to-ceiling glass doors.\n\nOkie was not ecstatic about his wife modeling, and persuaded her to give up that life in 1950. Conover owner her a load of money, but she gave up on ever trying to get it from him. She retired for good after 13 years as a model (a pretty long time for such a fickle job).\n\nFrancine Okie died on November 14, 1994, in Kent, Rhode Island.\n\nFrancine‚Äôs widower John Okie died on February 6, 1999 in Kent, Rhode Island.\n\nAs the daughter of one of Hollywood‚Äôs richest citizens, Peggy Lloyd could have had an ‚Äúeasy living‚Äù kind of a life. Yet, she stubbornly chose to become her own, independent woman, and fought tooth and nail to make a decent living in Hollywood for herself and her children.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nGloria Gabrielle Freeman was born on April 15, 1925, in Los Angeles, Califronia, to single mother Gloria Freeman. Her father (whatever his name was) was allegedly from Nebraska and her mother from Pennsylvania. Miss Freeman gave up Gloria for adoption soon after birth. She was put in a Pasadena orphanage.\n\nPeggy was adopted at the age of 5 by Harold and Mildred Lloyd. Harold Lloyd was a famous comedian, and the richest man in Hollywood ‚Äì he was a shrewd investor and canny businessman. They already had two children, a son, Harold Lloyd Jr. and a daughter, Mildred Gloria, whose companion Gloria was destined to become.\n\nThey renamed her Marjorie Elisabeth, she was nicknames Peggy almost from day one.\n\nPeggy lived the high life as Lloyd‚Äôs daughter ‚Äì she was chauffeured to school in a limo, and the family lived in the fabulous Lloyd estate (Green Acres, one of the first mansions in Beverly Hills) that had it‚Äôs own nine hole golf course and an Olympic sized pool. In 1930, after the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, Lloyd became paranoid about the safety of his own children. As Gloria Lloyd later said to a journalist:\n\n‚ÄúThat was a scary time because we were old enough to know what was going on. We had two guards outside of our room with guns in holsters. Nice guys ‚Äì they made fun for us children. But they used to go with us wherever we went, even to the tennis court. One taught me how to rollerskate. We weren‚Äôt allowed to go many places. So it was a very sheltered childhood.‚Äù\n\nBy all accounts, Harold and Mildred, as parents, were generous to the point of overindulgence. I quote Gloria‚Äôs independent obituar:\n\n‚ÄúThe children even had a private zoo. But Harold insisted they learn the value of money. At 13, Gloria and her friends had a lemonade stand on Benedict Canyon Drive. They charged a dime a glass, but Mildred made sure they gave the profits to the church.When Gloria and Peggy were students at UCLA. Lloyd ran the family on strict Victorian lines. Drinking was forbidden. Pocket money was limited to $30 a month while the girls were at college, and they were expected to travel there by bicycle.\n\n‚ÄúAs we grew up we had to be heavily chaperoned. It seems a little strange now, but we went out on dates with the chauffeur and the governess. Boyfriends came to the estate and were screened by Clementine, our housekeeper for 45 years. We felt like a Hollywood royal family.‚Äù\n\nPeggy attended Westlake School for Girl and, as mentioned in the quote, enrolled into UCLA and USC, majoring in art.\n\nDespite the family‚Äôs wealth, Peggy wanted to work and carve her own mark on the world. Being a very beautiful woman, it was only natural that she try her hand in modeling. Soon, Peggy was all over the papers, modeling clothes and advertising for this and that. In 1943, she landed a role in Cover girl, and started her career in Hollywood, the town where she was practically royalty.\n\nCAREER:\n\nAgain, I quote some of the previous posts about her movie career:\n\nHer first credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting role sin A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it‚Äôs a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nPeggy was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Eileen McClory, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Cecilia Meagher, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nAfter her death, Peggy was featured in an American Masters episode about her father, where she talked about their relationship and how was it to growing up in such an environment.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nIn 1946, Peggy made it in the California debutante book, along with her sister, Gloria, and Shirley Temple.\n\nPeggy married movie producer Almon Bartlett ‚ÄúBart‚Äù Ross on April 17, 1948. Ross was born on July 5, 1923, making him just two years older than Peggy. His father was a well known doctor in Beverly Hills. Their son David Lloyd Ross was born on May 26, 1950. They separated and divorced in 1953. In 1954, Bart married Erin Considine, another daughter of well heeled showbiz parents (her mother was Carmen Pantages, of the Pantages dynasty, and her dad director John Considine Jr.). That marriage did not last either, and he married lastly to Mary Carmenla Clark in 1961. He died in 1970.\n\nAfter her divorce, Peggy refused to return to the Lloyd‚Äôs house, and instead took an apartment with a friend and started a career as a Hollywood gossip columnist. She had to learn everything from a scratch, but Peggy was a smart, sharp woman and quickly paved her own way. She was proud to be able to support her son all on her own.\n\nPeggy had a one sided crush on society columnist Jim Copp. One of her first dates after her divorce were Don Taylor (then freshly divorced from Phyllis Avery) and Bob Fullerton. She let her hair down, driving in a fiee truck around town with her friend Ginny Simms. In late 1953 and early 1954, she had a serious romance with Dick Ogden, but he left her and she carried a torch for several months afterwards. Peggy dated first Harry Crocker and then Herbert Hirschmoeller for a brief time in the 1955, and then met her next husband, a young actor Robert, ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Patten.\n\nThey married on March 3, 1956, in Las Vegas. Patten was born on October 11, 1925 in Tacoma, Washington. He came to Hollywood in 1925 and was to become a major character actor in showbiz. The real marriage lasted only 8 months, and her friend Betty Plant even testified that Patten told her he could not stand Peggy any more, since he disliked ‚Äúgood wives‚Äù. They won a divorce in December 1956, and afterwards Peggy found out she was pregnant. This did not change her decision about her marital state ‚Äì they did not remarry. Their son Robert Patten Jr. was born on August 3, 1957 in Los Angeles.\n\nAs Harold Lloyd‚Äôs daughter, Peggy was very active socially. She knew everybody who was somebody from the movie colony, and was a good friend with Charlie and Oona Chaplin, giving many interview about the couple. Peggy also gave many soirees at her home in San Fernando Valley, hosting many a famous people. She was on good terms with her sister and brother, and the only child who remained in normal contact with the elder Lloyd and Mildred.\n\nI was very impressed by Peggy, as she became a publicist and refused all help from Harold for financial support. She candidly told a reported that ‚ÄúI am over 21 and mom and dad are not responsible for my mistakes.‚Äù Bravo for Peggy! A very down to earth, normal millionaire‚Äôs daughter! Peggy later worked in a variety of other jobs: as a talent scout for a radio DJ, restaurant hostess, bookkeeper for an advertising agency and saleswoman.\n\nPeggy tried to find her birth mother in about 1972, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. This started a trend in the papers, where adopted children seeker the truth about their birth parents. I don‚Äôt know how exactly it transpired, but Peggy met with her birth mother, then known as Dorothy Callison.\n\nPeggy did not remarry and lived the rest of her days in California.\n\nMarjorie Elisabeth Lloyd died on November 18, 1986, from lung cancer in Newport, Orange County, California.\n\nHer former husband Bob Patten died in 2001. The last surviving Lloyd sibling, Gloria, died in 2012.\n\nBeautiful model whose movie career never happened, but who became a leading philanthropist in the New Jersey area, Helen Mueller is certainly a woman living an interesting life.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nHelen Irene Mueller was born in August 1919 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, to Emil Mueller and his wife, Gertrude Mueller, the youngest of three daughters. Her older sisters were Marguerite V., born in 1913, and Hildegarde, born in 1915. Both of her parents were born in Germany and immigrated to the States in about 1903 and 1904.\n\nHelen grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey. There she graduated from Bloomfield high school (but opted not to go to college).\n\nHelen‚Äôs father died in the 1930s, and her mother took up nursing to support the family. Her sisters married and left the family home, and in 1940, Helen and her mother were living together in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Helen was working as a professional photographer‚Äôs aide. Her knowledge of the photography process helped her carve a career as a model, and she left for New York in cca 1941. She quickly rose in the modeling ranks, and was posing for Norman Rockwell and regularly appearing on magazine covers. In 1943, she was summoned to Hollywood to appear in Cover girl, a Rita Hayworth movie, and left for the West coast.\n\nCAREER:\n\nAgain, I quote some of the previous posts about her movie career:\n\nHer first and only credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting roles in A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it‚Äôs a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nHelen was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Eileen McClory, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Cecilia Meagher, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nI was surprised to see just how many models actually had low-key love lives and married normal guys. I always imagine them as glamorous gals who ended up with crem de la crem of society (Conover once remarked that he wasn‚Äôt sure was he running a marrying agency or a modeling agency). Yet, there undoubtedly was a string of models who married high up and made news with their romantic exploits. Helen was on the threshold between these two : the girls next door and the glam queens. Why? Let us find out!\n\nHelen hits the papers in 1941 as a serious romance of a famous illustrator Jon Whitcomb. Whitcomb had just left a short and bitter marriage to Mary Brian months prior, and of course the ‚Äúserious romance‚Äù led nowhere.\n\nWell, for a time in 1943, Helen was in all the papers as the prospective bride to be of Mickey Rooney, that well-wed but well-loved cad. Rooney needs no introductions ‚Äì a genius all around performer, he was one of the best examples of the triple threat: an actor, dancer and singer rolled into one. By 1943, he was already married once, to Ava Gardner, but the marriage was pretty short. Helen and Mickey met in the early 1943, by April were a constant couple, and in August he organised her a birthday party and even gifted her with a ruby bracelet! They were frequently photographed at the Mocambo night club and at the premiere of ‚ÄúFor Whom the Bell Tolls‚Äù . It must have been love for Mickey, as he tried to persuade the pretty model to marry him in January 1944. During the whole month of September and October Helen was trying in earnest to fight off rumors that she would wed Mickey, claiming that she was engaged to another man.\n\nAnd engaged to another man she was. Helen announced her engagement to Bill ‚ÄúWild Indian‚Äù Geyer in May 1943, before things with Mickey really heated up. She vehemently tried to deny that she was in a serious relationship with Mickey and that she would wed Bill regardless. She and Bill married on March 15, 1944, in New Jersey.\n\nNow, Geyer is a very colorful, interesting man. I quote http://www.njinvent.org/ web site for information about Bill‚Äôs father, also called William Geyer:\n\nWilliam Geyer arrived in the United States from his native Germany in 1910 at age 17, earning his passage by peeling potatoes on the ship. He had no money or command of the language but put his skills to work as a glassblower at Westinghouse, making lamps for 15 cents an hour.\n\nBy 1918, at age 25, he established Scientific Glass Apparatus Co. in Bloomfield in the back bedroom of his home. After the business spilled onto other parts of his property, including the chicken coop, he established his first factory in Bloomfield, about 500 feet from his home. Several skilled craftsmen manned the plant, producing custom-made glassware for local laboratories.\n\nGeyer was the inventor of automatic burettes, metal-clad joints, melting point thermometers and other items now considered standard equipment in laboratories. He was also responsible for the development and production of interchangeable glassware in the United States.\n\nHe was honored with the Kiwanis International Legion of Honor Award.\n\nHis son ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù Bill Geyer, who was an All-American running back at Colgate University and a professional with the Chicago Bears, succeeded his father as president of Scientific Glass, now an international company with annual sales in excess of $7 million. He was resident of Bloomfield.\n\nHere are some more bits about Bill ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to see what an interesting character he was:\n\n‚Äì Colgate football ‚Äì 1939, 1940, 1941\n\n‚Äì 1942 East-West Shrine Game\n\n‚Äì Selected in the 11th round of the 1942 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears\n\n‚Äì Chicago Bears ‚Äì 1942-1943, 1946\n\n‚Äì He paid for his own plane and training after being rejected for Colgate‚Äôs civilian pilot training course in 1940 because of an eye injury\n\n‚Äì He was turned down by the Navy in 1941 because of the same injury, so he had surgery to correct it\n\n‚Äì Returned to Colgate in 1943 for aviation training and took math courses from Andy Kerr\n\n‚Äì Gunnery officer in the Navy in World War II\n\n‚Äì Played with a Navy football team in a game against the Army in the Philippines in 1945\n\n‚Äì Returned to the Brooklyn Armed Guard Center in 1945 after commanding a gun crew\n\nBill was a very industrious, hard working man. He served not only heads a prospering manufacturing company, with factories in many states, but also held such honors as the vice-chairmanship of the Colgate University Board of Trustees and the presidency of the New York Touchdown Club.\n\nHelen and Bill had, by all means, an exciting, harmonious marriage ‚Äì in short, a marriage anybody could wish for. They had more than one child, but I am unfortunately unable to find their names (if anybody has this information, please email me so I can put it here). They were a perfect team, doing extensive philanthropic work together, flying in their Cessna airplane, attending charity events, mingling with students at Bill‚Äôs alma mater, Colgate University, and making long sojourns in Africa to go hunting.\n\nDue to their shared philanthropic work, Helen is a living legend in New Jersey, as the local web page (http://patch.com/) quotes about her:\n\nHelen Geyer has served for many years as a valuable volunteer to the YMCA of Montclair. Over the years she served on the Ladies Auxiliary and in addition to many other special events she assisted in transforming the gymnasium to look like that of the theme of that year‚Äôs fundraiser. She assisted with inviting ‚Äúthe right people‚Äù to the table for each event and funded several projects over the years. More recently and more significantly, Mrs. Geyer generously funded the renovation of the 159 Glenridge Avenue property. In 2007, the branch of the YMCA intended to serve our youth population was officially named the Helen & Bill Geyer Family Center of the Montclair YMCA. We give many thanks to Helen for her philanthropic spirit.\n\nBill Geyer died on June 4, 2004.\n\nHelen Geyer is still alive and lives in Montclair, New Yersey.\n\nRegal, elegant model who became the queen of jukebox movies in California, Cecilia Meagher lasted much longer than some, but still did not find lasting success in Hollywood.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nCecelia Margret Meagher was born on May 10, 1919 in New York to John Meagher and Sarah Potter. Her father was to become a vice president of the Pennsylvania R.R. company.\n\nCecilia was the oldest of three daughters: her younger sister were Mildred, born in 1921, and Joan, born in 1926. Cecilia and her sisters grew up in the family home in Howard Beach where they attended high school.\n\nA pretty brown eyed girl, Cecilia entered the world of modeling in 1936, barely 17 years old. She entered a large number of various beauty contests and often placed second (always the bridesmaid, never the bride).\n\nIn the early 1940s, Cecilia signed with Conover models. In 1942, she won a national wide contest of Coronet magazine to find a perfect girl who will represent them in the upcoming Rita Hayworth movie, Cover Girl. Thus, Cecilia left for Hollywood!\n\nCAREER:\n\nCecilia made only one movie under her real name, and that movie is Cover girl. As with Jean Colleran, I repeat the passage about the film:\n\nHer first credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting role sin A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it‚Äôs a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nCecilia was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Eileen McClory, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Helen Mueller, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nIn the interim, Cecilia change her name to Cissy Marr and made a large number of jukebox movies. IMDB only lists a few credtis under t his name. Let‚Äôs go with them:\n\nAnna and the King of Siam, a predecessor of The King and I. It‚Äôs a very well made movie, with a geniune warmth and loads of charm. The performances by Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison are first class, very nuanced and deeply felt, the production values are high and the script is intelligently written. While it‚Äôs not the flippant, happy go lucky movie the musical version is, the dramatic flair gives it a seriousness and earnestness the musical does not have. Cissy played one of the King‚Äôs wives and was (sadly) uncredited.\n\nThe second one is Blue Skies, a Bing Crosby/Fred Astaire film with music by Irving Berlin. If you like musicals where the music is of primer importance, this is the movie for you. While both Astaire and Crosby excell at their prospective fields (Astaire as a dancer and Crosby as a singer, naturally), they cannot outmatch Berlin‚Äôs ingenious music. Joan Claufield is a bit balnd as the love interest, but her sweet but interesting type was a female role staple in Crosby movies for a very long time. All in all, a nicely done musical, worth watching, not the best for any of the performers involved but certantly good enough.\n\nThe Belle of New York is a slightly different musical (of the musical fantasy type), with Astaire and Vera Ellen, that never grows to it‚Äôs full potential. The reason? Several, but mostly it‚Äôs the inspid, uninteresting story (about a playboy at the beginning of the 20th century who falls in love with a mission house worker, now where did I see that one before?) . Fred, despite being in his late 50s, is as god as ever, and Vera Ellen is a graceful but energetic dancer, matched by very few female dancers of that time. The supporting players are also outstanding (Marjorie Main, Keenan Wynn, Alice Pearce), but there is always something missing.\n\nCissy allegedly appeared in the movie A Bell For Adano with her daughter, but it is not listed among her credits.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nCecilia‚Äôs life was pretty ordinary for someone who was a top New York model and an working actress (at least for a time). Men flock to date and sometimes wed both of these brands of girls.\n\nBack home n New York, in the late 1942 and early 1943, Cecilia dated the famous puppeteer, Frank Parris. Yet, Parris was soon out and a new beau was in ‚Äì civilian flying instructor, Robert Heasley. For Cecilia Bob Heasley was the one, and the two wed on December 7, 1943, in Los Angeles.\n\nRobert Preston Heasley was born on August 2, 1915 to Walter Heasley and Jeanette Barrett in California. The family lived in Los Angeles where Bob grew up. He later opened a flying school in Arizona.\n\nHer daughter Barbara Jeanne Heasley was born on October 26, 1944. When the baby was two months old, both she and Cecilia appeared in the movie ‚ÄúA bell for Adano.‚Äù Cecilia‚Äôs second child, a son, Robert Preston Healey Jr., was born on April 29, 1948.\n\nAlso worth noting is that Ceceilia‚Äôs sister, Mildred, became the model Betty McGuire and made headlines more than her sister in the earl 1940s. She was very popular with the boys and had a brief marriage that was well documented in the papers. She faded from view after 1946.\n\nCecilia and Robert continued to live in California. She gave up her movie work in the late 1940s to raise their family. She was completely out of the limelight and it‚Äôs very hard to find any information about what she was doing during that time. Cecilia and Bob divorced sometime in the mid 1960s, and Bob remarried in 1968 to Constance Simons.\n\nHer son, Robert Preston Heasley Jr., married Mary Charlene Hayes in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1977.\n\nCecilia‚Äôs former husband, Robert Preston Heasley, died on April 17, 1998.\n\nCecilia Heasley died on July 11, 1998, in South Lake Tahoe, El Dorado County, California\n\nLooking at Dee Turnell‚Äôs filmography, it‚Äôs almost like seeing a list of the best musicals made in the 1940s and 1950s. As a trained ballet dancer with an extensive background in chorus work, she worked exclusively in the musical genre, dancing endless hours and giving it her best years. This devotion also constitutes the main tragedy of her career ‚Äì today, she remains totally obscure to all except the most devoted of musical fans.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nEdythe Helen Turnell was born on November 27, 1925, in Westmont, DuPage, Illinois to Charles Allen Turnell and his 20 years younger wife, Edith H. Turnell. She had an older brother, Warren, and two half siblings from her mother‚Äôs prior marriage, Junior Hilling and Geneoave Hilling.\n\nIt was clear from her earliest childhood that Edythe was a natural at dancing, and her mother enrolled her into ballet classes. By the age of 10, she was appearing on the stage, by the age of 16 making her living as a dancer, and by the age of 18 was a veteran of the stage, a part time model to make ends meet (her sister Geneoave was the first to start that fad in the family), and a triple winner of titles in the Chicago‚Äôs Artists and Models Contest (for glamour, smile and figure). Dee gave up her high school education to dance in cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit during the war (in 1942 and 1943).\n\nIn 1944, she went to New York for better job opportunities, became a Conover Model and danced on the side. She struck gold when she got the role in Dream with Music as an understudy of Vera Zorina. The play was a miss and closed after just two weeks, but the famous impresario Monte Prosser noticed Dee and got her a spot at the world famous Copacabana chorus line. She also scored a Collier magazine cover November 20, 1944. It was this that caught the attention of a talent scout from Hollywood, who persuaded Dee to try her luck on the West Coast.\n\nCAREER:\n\nDee was a part of the golden age of MGM musical, one of the times in movie history that pure magic and escapism actually made good viewing. This is a great achievement for anyone in the showbiz industry, and it‚Äôs clear that she worked hard at her craft and was an elegant, accomplished dancer.\n\nDee started her acting career in Copacabana, a movie that desperately tries to revive the magic and allure of it‚Äôs stars, Groucho Marx and Carmen Miranda, both waaay past their prime by the late 1940s. As in real life, she played one of the Copa girls. Needless to say, as all movies that try too hard, it fails. Not a starry start,but it gets better. Cass Timberlane, originally a sharp and biting book by Sinclair Lewis, became a drama that was sugarcoated to meet the typical demands of Hollywood. It was one of the very few non musicals Dee made, and today is still worth watching, if for nothing but to see Spencer Tracy and the ever sexy Lana Turner together.\n\nNow, Dee took a leap upwards, and had a names character role in The Pirate, a charming, fluffy and totally lightweight Gene Kelly vehicle. Her next appearance was an absolute hit and one of the best 1940s musicals, Easter Parade, one of the few movies that gave Judy Garland a true chance to shine and show her diverse talents. Words and Music followed, less in quality than Easter Parade, but still a decent example of the genre. The Barkleys of Broadway, the last movie Astaire/Rogers movie, made with both of them in middle age and not the young and vivacious couple they were for their 1930s RKO output, is accordingly a more mature musical than most Dee made. Not to say that the plot is a shining example of complex storytelling, but the sole act of moving away from the idealized stage of falling in love and tackling the issues of long standing couples that have slipped into a routine (like the desire for change after years of repetition) touched a slightly different cord, and proved to be the very thing Astaire and Rogers needed.\n\nDee was pushed into a new type of musical: aquatic extravaganza, with who else but the queen of the genre, Esther Williams. Neptune‚Äôs Daughter is one of the better showcases for the athletic star, bringing nothing new nor especially exciting, but Red Skelton and Ricardo Montalban are charming leading men, and Esther always stuns with her swimming numbers. Tea for Two was a No, no Nanette remake with Doris Day and her best singing partner, Gordon MacRae. With this, Dee entered the golden part of her career, having small roles in a classic musical after classical musical.\n\nIt started with Royal Wedding, a Astaire/Jane Powell gem, moved to Show Boat, a very good version of the Edna Ferber classic, with Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner and Howard Keel, got little off track with the average Mickey Rooney potboiler, The Strip, and then hit high notes again with An American in Paris and Singin‚Äô in the Rain.\n\nHer musical output slowed down after this, and Dee found herself cast in a minor role in a great dramatic movie, The Bad and the Beautiful.The Girl Who Had Everything was an early showcase for Elizabeth Taylor, not a particularly good movie, but the gorgeous fashion and beautiful actors (Liz at her physical best and the dashing Fernando Lamas) make for a pleasant viewing. It was back to musicals once again with the dapper, elegant The Band Wagon. Brigadoon gave Dee her one credited role ‚Äì in one of the most nonsensical musicals (in terms of plot) ever made, and that‚Äôs saying a lot. Yet, seeing Gene Kelly dance somehow melts all the other doubts away. Deep in My Heart was a direct, verbatim translation of a Broadway hit to the screen, but once again, Dee was uncredited. It seemed by now that her chances of getting somewhere high in the strata of Hollywood were zero.\n\nThe string continued with Kismet ‚Äì a musical that suffers from a serious illness of having an uninteresting story, but possess a lively high quality score, never managed to become a top tier movie. Dee‚Äôs last role was an small one The Opposite Sex, a promising remake of The Women that never reached it‚Äôs full potential and ends up as a forgettable female romp. And there were actually tons of men in the movie, in total contract to the original where there was not a single man present on screen.\n\nAlready a married woman by this time, she gave up Hollywood in late 1955.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nDee was a strong, independent woman who was very loyal to her friends and family. To illustrate the point, when Dee first came to Hollywood, during the wartime shortage of housing when anybody was lucky to get any kind of accommodation, she insisted that her Collie, Cleopatra who was with her from his puppyhood, lived wherever she lived. In the 1940s, it was usually frowned upon when a lodger had a dog, and most people who rented flats did not have any pets for this reason. Combine this with the housing shortage, and you have a woman who risked her job prospects for her canine friend. Luckily, RKO did find her a suitable apartment where she could live with Cleopatra.\n\nDee was often featured in newspaper columns in the late 1940s, pictured with a very young Elizabeth Taylor on several occasions- Dee was painted as a passionate swimmer who spent a chunk of her free time on the beach. Dee‚Äôs legs, toned from years of dancing, were also frequently on display, and won her several prizes.\n\nAs an interesting tidbit, Dee had an highly unusual role in a movie, playing none other than Dean Stockwell‚Äôs deceased mother! How, you ask? Simple, her photograph poses for Dean‚Äôs late mother‚Äôs photograph. She was slightly airbrushed, so that the artist gave her a vague resemblance to the young Stockwell, by lowering her eyebrows, raising her lower eyelids a trifle, and making her mouth a bit wider.\n\nInformation about her love life are slim at best. She dated Curley Harris, one of the Three Stooges, for more than a year, staring in 1945 and ending early in 1947. They were even engaged at some point of the relationship, but it obviously did not yell.\n\nDee married, very low key, Richard Jerome Thorpe on March 4, 1951. Thorpe was born on August 29, 1926, making him several months younger than Dee. His father was the actor and director Richard Thorpe, whose filmography lists such prestigious pictures like Jailhouse Rock, Fun in Acapulco The Prisoner of Zenda, Ivanhoe and so on.\n\nHer son, Tracy Thorpe, was born on August 27, 1957. Her first daughter, Tricia A. Thorpe, was born on August 21, 1959. Her second daughter, Tiana H. Thorpe, was born on August 1, 1964.\n\nDee divorced her husband in 1971. dee moved to West Palm Beach, Floria and became an active participant in the local social life under the name of Dee Turnell Thorpe. Among others, she was a chairman at a charity gala for a local hospital in 1991.\n\nDee Turnell died in 2007 from cancer.\n\nAfter Whitney Bourne, we have an another debutante who wanted more of life than fancy tea parties and golf. Leila Ernst was a Boston blue blood who gained ever lasting recognition on Broadway with her role in the original production or Pal Joey, but did not continue her winning row, which ended after just one movie , in Hollywood.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nLaila Semple Ernst was born on July 28, 1922/1920, in Joffrey, New Hampshire, to Frederick Steinmann Ernst and Roberta D. Ernst. Her father, a WW1 veteran, served as a head master at a prestigious all boys school in the city. They moved to Salem, Massachusetts right after 1923 started. Her younger brother Frederick Jr. was born there a year later, in 1924. The family moved to Wellesley, Norfolk, Massachusetts in the late 1920s, and were prominent in the Chesnut Hill social set. Leila traveled with her parents from her earliest days ‚Äì she was in Europe before she turned 8, visiting Monaco and France.\n\nComing from a solid upper middle class family, Leila had a top notch schooling, shuffling between private schools in England, France and Italy, and, after coming of age, getting her very own place in the Back Bay Society of Boston. Being one of the oldest WASP society enclaves in the US, the Boston set was highly prestigious and Leila was a sough after debutante. Yet, the life of leisure proved too unsatisfying for the energetic girl and after getting the acting bug she enrolled into Walter Hartwig‚Äôs Junior Colony Theater School. Her talent did not go unnoticed and in 1937 she was given a big chance of playing opposite the theater‚Äôs professional team, led by Donald Cook, in a play named ‚ÄúSoubrette‚Äù. A Paramount executive saw her and steered her towards the New York office. To prepare for a movie career, she enrolled into Boston‚Äôs Leland Powers School for Radio . Reta Shaw was one of the more famous actresses to come out of that school. After one term at Powers, she got real acting experience in the Mercury Theater (led by Orson Welles), acting in stock in Maine. There George Abbott heard her, and tested for his upcoming play, Too Many Girls.\n\nCAREER:\n\nLeila had much better luck on Broadway than in Hollywood. After some brushing up in summer stock, she got her first real role in Too Many Girls in 1939. At the tender age of 17, there she was , on the sure road to stardom. And for a time, she did not disappoint. She took her theater career very seriously, and was very dedicated to it.\n\nIn the interim of her theater work, Leila made only one movie in Hollywood. It was a leading female role in Life with Henry where she was surrounded by some pretty famous thespians ‚Äì Jackie Cooper, Eddie Bracken and the gossip queen/actress Hedda Hopper. The movie is not a bad piece of work, one in the long running series of the Henry Aldrich adventures, but it was quickly forgotten.\n\nLeila was very level headed about both Hollywood and the movie business. She refused to stay as a contractee in California, and went back to summer stock right after the movie was finished. Despite the fact that she liked Hollywood and doing movies, her chief desire was to gain stage experience, and she knew she could not get that if she was tied to a studio for a prolonged period of time. Her plan was to work for two years on the East coast before trying her hand on the West coast yet again. She rubbed this method into her costar Jackie Cooper, who left movies for a period after Life with Henry to experience stage life and become a better actor. The two went into a semi partnership to appear in Maine summer stock.\n\nAnd then, after some summer stock, Leila got her big break. In December 1940, Pal Joey opened on Broadway with her, Gene Kelly and Vivienne Segal in the leads. Leila played Linda English, the nice, naive showgirl, Segal‚Äôs rival for Joey‚Äôs love. The show is a musical theater staple even today, and got made as a movie in 1957 (sadly with no actors from the original run, but with Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak in Leila‚Äôs role). The play lasted for a year and after it ended in November 1941, Leila opted for semi retirement with her new husband.\n\nIn early 1943, there were reports that RKO was giving Leila a large build up to become a comedienne in the class of Carole Lombard, but it all amounted to nothing, and she left the West coast not long after. She was back on the stage in June 1943 in Doughgirls. A funny farce about wartime Washington, it was a decent comeback vehicle, and Leila was once again ready for the big spotlight. She continued touring with the play in 1945.\n\nIn 1946 she hit the Broadway stage once again with Truckline Cafe, starring in February 27, 1946. Tons of highly revered names were involved in it: Maxwell Anderson, Harold Clurman, Elia Kazan, Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and David Manners among others, but it was a failure, closing after only 13 performances. Today it is best known as one of Brando‚Äôs earliest stage credits.\n\nLeila‚Äôs last Broadway credit was If the Shoe Fits, a short lived musical that closed after a few performances ‚Äì but Leila at least played the dream role for every woman ‚Äì Cinderella.\n\nLeila withdrew from the acting life after this.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nPapers tried to make the most out of her blue blood background. She was hailed as a ‚Äúblonde Boston ball of fire‚Äù who ‚Äúshocks old Boston dowagers with her crazy tomboy antics‚Äù in Hollywood. Example: Leila dated Victor Mature, the muscle man of Hollywood. For one, Mature, who came from a humble background, had a special taste for fine bred ladies (three of his wives were debutantes), and for the other, they were even named ‚ÄúLeast likely to romantically succeed‚Äù by the papers. The press got that right (what a shocker! :-P), as they broke up soon after. The same year she had a unnamed Boston admirer who only saw her photo, but was ready to date her anyway. No info is given to what happened next.\n\nLeila married Stacy Beakes Hulse Jr. on July 1, 1941, in the Church of the Transfiguration (commonly known as the Little Church) in Manhattan. Hulse was born on April 25, 1920 in New Haven, Connecticut to a prominent family, attended the private Belmont High School, studied at Harvard, majoring in business and specializing in American colonial history. Afterwards, he would go on to work in the finance world.\n\nAlas, the marriage was not meant to last ‚Äì they separated in late 1945 and divorced in 1947 in Dade, Florida. Hulse died in 1988 in Maryland.\n\nIn 1946, before her divorce (but while she was separated from Hulse), she started dating Edgar Luckenback, a Palm beach man from a prominent shipping family. The relationship lasted until mid 1947. After this, she was seen with Victor Carbone and was suppose to marry him in 1948, but nothing came out of it. Right after came Bruce Emmings, a British business executive, but that too did not lead to marriage.\n\nLeila‚Äôs last acknowledged beau was James Veitch in 1952. What happened to her afterwards is a mystery.\n\nShe is allegedly still alive today, at the age of 91."
