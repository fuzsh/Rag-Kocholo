        "text": "The Beverly Hills home of Gene Kelly, who died at 83 in February, has been sold for nearly its $2-million asking price. The buyers are Richard \"Dick\" Costello, president of MCA's Universal Strategic Marketing Group, and his wife, Ann.\n\nKelly had the house rebuilt in 1984 to look the same as it did before a fire destroyed it and his only Oscar. The legendary dancer-actor owned the property for more than 30 years.\n\nThe traditional-style home has three bedrooms and a guest house in about 5,000 square feet.\n\nTennis nut Dustin Hoffman put love first when he built his new house in the Los Angeles community of Brentwood. His walled north-south tennis court was completed months before the home.\n\nAn avid player who often participates in celebrity tennis tournaments, the Oscar-winning actor has just moved with his family into the new seven-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot home.\n\nHoffman co-stars with Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt in the current film Sleepers and is in Los Angeles filming Mad City with John Travolta.\n\nThe two-time best actor Oscar winner (Kramer vs. Kramer, 1979; Rain Man, 1988) had been living in his New York City co-op with his wife, Lisa, and their four children. Hoffman, 59, also has two grown children from his first marriage.\n\nHe was born and raised in Los Angeles and in recent years has owned homes in Malibu and the Hollywood Hills.\n\nHoffman's Brentwood home, which took two years to build, is on several lots. His house was built on the two-lot site of a 6,000-square-foot house built in the 1940s. That house was gutted to make way for the current home.\n\nBefore his new house was built, Hoffman also bought an adjacent house that was torn down to make room for his tennis court. He bought part of a neighboring lot for a path as court access from his house.\n\nHoffman's house, which is sheathed in redwood, has been described as \"contemporary but country in style, with soaring spaces.\"\n\nHoffman is estimated to have spent $5-million in construction."
