        "text": "Several of you expressed your appreciation for Gene in a sailor suit. He was with you on this, as he thought this costume particularly suited his dancing as he showed the lines of his body yet allowed him to be in character. He wore the “dress blues” of the U.S. Navy in Anchors Aweigh and here is in the “dress whites” for On the Town. In the animated scene with Jerry the Mouse, he is wearing the striped shirt, white pants and white bâchi topped with a red pompon of the French National Navy. Then, of course, he wore the real uniform when he was in the U.S. Navy in WWII. Gene told me that on his first leave from boot camp in San Diego, he returned to MGM dressed in his sailor suit. He said, “I ran into the studio to check the numbers in Anchors Aweigh and the little girl who ran the elevator said, ‘retakes?’” I have my father’s white sailor suit. He was an ensign in the Navy at 19. I don’t have Gene’s, but I do have the dress blues from Anchors Aweigh. #genekelly #genekellylegacy #onthetown #anchorsaweigh #invitationtothedance\n\nGene told me that every form of movement came easily to him. So I wasn’t surprised to find this photo of him riding a skateboard with kids in New York City during the filming of his show “Gene Kelly in New York, New York” (1966). There is something wonderful about a 53-year-old man in a suit and tie who saw himself as “a perennial child” and no different from the kids playing on the street. At least that’s what I think. #genekelly #genekellylegacy\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of the love between Gene and @sinatra I thought I would include this photo that is hanging in the archives. Frank sent it to Gene as a gift after Gene’s house fire. It was taken by David Sutton during the rehearsals for Frank’s comeback performance “Ol’ Blue Eyes is Back” in 1973. Frank’s note reads: “Dear Shanty - Fire or no fire - I love you even more! Francis.” Shanty (for “shanty Irish” vs “lace curtain Irish”) was Frank’s nickname for Gene. Gene’s mother aspired to be “lace curtain” and always tried to elevate the family’s standing. This photo shows the men as I knew them. Tender men. #genekelly #genekellylegacy #franksinatra# olblueeyesisback\n\nThere’s that left hand again! Yet another example of how Gene characteristically gestured in still photos in order to convey some activity. I love Frank and Gene together in Anchors Aweigh. It is especially touching to watch them knowing that, as Gene said, they were “closer than brothers.” They are playing against type with Frank the guy who can’t get girls and Gene as the “wolf.” I’m glad I have Gene’s sailor suit here in the collection. I wonder who got Frank’s in the recent auction. #genekelly #genekellylegacy #franksinatra #anchorsaweigh\n\nOkay, you super sleuths! Thanks to Rich Emery and Don Harden, we now know that this building is the Administration Building at MGM-British Studios or “MGM Borehamwood.” Originally called Elstree Studios, it was purchased by MGM in 1947 and renamed “MGM-British Studios.” Thanks to Ronald G. Holland, we know that the car is a Vauxhall. Founded in London in 1857, Vauxhall was originally a pump and marine engine manufacturer. In 1903, the company moved into the car market. In 1925, Vauxhall, then operating out of Luton, was acquired by General Motors. During WWII, car production was suspended in order to work on the “Churchill tank.” Vauxhall resumed car production in September 1945. In 1951, Vauxhall released the six-cylinder EIP Velox. Ronald G. Holland is not certain that the model Gene is driving is a “Velox.” I can only say that this suggestion triggered something in my memory about Gene and a Vauxhall Velox. Once I find that bit of information, I will share it. In the meantime, we can be certain it is a Vauxhall. Karen Lorraine Saunders and Mary Jane Taylor Isaacs suggested that the sticker might be a “tax disc” that was required in the UK. I have not found a disc that resembles this one, but I’ll keep looking. Kari Foster explained how Gene is able to lean out the window like this—the steering wheel is on the opposite side. Gene is sitting in the passenger seat. So there you have it! Fun facts, thanks to you! Gene was shooting Invitation to the Dance at the MGM-British Studios, so it makes sense that he was there. Now I’m determined to find an operational Vauxhall Velox! I can’t afford one, of course, but I can dream. #genekelly #genekellylegacy #vauxhall\n\nEven in black and white this is a powerful shot (when you add the dramatic red floor and walls, it takes on another dimension in much the way that Gene’s dance with Vera-Ellen does in On The Town). Gene is coiled like a cat ready to spring and Mitzi is right there with him. Two pros, and they are both “dancing hurt” in this number. Like the dance with Olivia in Xanadu, this number was not in the movie initially. Gene thought it was wrong NOT to dance with an experienced dancer like Mitzi, so he pushed it through. The arranger Saul Chaplin flew to New York to meet with composer Cole Porter and “Why Am I So Gone (About That Gal)” was born. Thankfully. #genekelly #genekellylegacy #mitzigaynor #lesgirls #coleporter"
