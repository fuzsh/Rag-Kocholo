        "text": "American actor\n\nPaul Michael Kelly (August 9, 1899[citation needed] – November 6, 1956) was an American stage, film, and television actor. His career survived a manslaughter conviction, tied to an affair, that caused him to spend time in prison in the late 1920s.\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nKelly alternated between stage and screen as an actor. He was a handsome and popular male lead or costar in Broadway plays from the late 1910s and throughout the 1920s. Kelly made his talking film debut in 1933's Broadway Through a Keyhole. In the course of his career, and relatively short life, it has been estimated that Kelly worked on stage, screen, and television in over four hundred roles.[1]\n\nIn 1948, Kelly won a Best Actor Tony Award for his role in Command Decision. Clark Gable later played the same role in the film version of the play. Kelly shared the award with Henry Fonda for Mister Roberts and Basil Rathbone for The Heiress.[1]\n\nManslaughter conviction[edit]\n\nOn April 16, 1927, a drunk Kelly confronted fellow actor Ray Raymond over his affair with and love for Raymond's wife, actress Dorothy Mackaye. Raymond, who was also drunk, was no match for Kelly, who was considerably larger than him. During their confrontation, Kelly hit him several times and left him on the floor.[2]\n\nMackaye denied claims in court that she had been romantically involved with Kelly before Raymond's death, but Kelly's love letters to her were introduced as evidence. She was charged with felony conspiracy for the attempted coverup, and sentenced to one to three years, but served less than 10 months.[3] Kelly was sentenced to up to 10 years, but served only 25 months in San Quentin prison. Conditions of his release included that he must not marry for 18 months after his release, and that he would have to take a job as a clerk for $30 per week.[2] Kelly found working as a clerk untenable, and convinced the supervisors of his parole to allow him to return to acting on Broadway, with the condition that he continued to be limited to an income of $30 per week.[2]\n\nYears later, Kelly played the part of San Quentin Warden Clinton Duffy in Duffy of San Quentin.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nKelly and Mackaye married in 1931, shortly after the expiration on Kelly's parole condition prohibiting him from marrying.[2] They performed on Broadway, and then returned to California, where Mackaye's daughter Valerie Raymond was apparently adopted by Kelly and became known as Mimi Kelly. Mimi would later have her own modest Broadway career.[1]\n\nDorothy Mackaye's account of her experiences, Women in Prison, became a film, Ladies They Talk About (1933), with Barbara Stanwyck, and was remade as Lady Gangster in 1942.\n\nMackaye died from a 1940 auto crash, when her car swerved and rolled into a ditch. She walked home, and, seeking to assuage Kelly's concerns, insisted that she was not seriously hurt. Her doctor, however, insisted that she go to a hospital, where she died three days later due to a ruptured bladder she suffered in the accident.[4]\n\nKelly married Claire Owen a year later.[4] He died of a heart attack at 57 on November 6, 1956, in Beverly Hills, California.[5]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1919 Fit to Win Hank Simpson Anne of Green Gables Gilbert Blythe 1920 Uncle Sam of Freedom Ridge Young Sam 1921 The Great Adventure Another Leek Son The Old Oaken Bucket The Youth 1926 The New Klondike Bing Allen 1927 Slide, Kelly, Slide Dillon Special Delivery Tuck, another detective (scenes deleted) The Poor Nut Spike Hoyt Uncredited 1932 The Girl from Calgary Larry Boyd 1933 Broadway Through a Keyhole Frank Rocci 1934 School for Girls Garry Waltham The Love Captive Dr. Norman Ware Side Streets Tim O'Hara Blind Date Bill Lowry Death on the Diamond Jimmie Downey The President Vanishes Chick Moffat 1935 When a Man's a Man Phil Acton Star of Midnight Jim Kinland Public Hero No. 1 James Duff Speed Devils Martin Gray Silk Hat Kid Tim Martin It's a Great Life Rockie Johnson\n\n1935 Saga of the West Phil\n\n1936 My Marriage Barney Dolan Here Comes Trouble Duke Donovan Song and Dance Man Hap Farrell The Country Beyond Sgt.
