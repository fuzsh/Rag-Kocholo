        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Gene Kelly, the dancer who brought his athletic grace and Irish charm to \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"On the Town\" and other great movie musicals of the 1940s and '50s, died yesterday. He was 83.\n\nWarren Cowan, Mr. Kelly's longtime publicist, said the entertainer died in his sleep at his Beverly Hills home, with his wife, Patricia, at his bedside. Mr. Kelly had suffered strokes in 1994 and 1995, and Mr. Cowan said he never really recovered from them.\n\nMr. Kelly reigned at MGM in the postwar era, when the studio was known for turning out the best movie musicals. He also had serious acting roles and directed \"Hello, Dolly!\" and other films.\n\nHis most memorable dance was the title number of \"Singin' in the Rain,\" in which he splashed joyously through puddles on a near-deserted street, his love for Debbie Reynolds rendering him oblivious to the wet.\n\nIn 1989, \"Singin' in the Rain\" was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry of significant movies.\n\n\"He was part of my family, part of all of our heritage ... an American treasure, a friend, an original,\" Liza Minnelli said on hearing of Mr. Kelly's death. \"I know one thing. For the rest of my life, whenever it rains ... I will think of him and smile.\"\n\nNo funeral was planned."
