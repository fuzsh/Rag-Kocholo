        "text": "Eugene Curran Kelly (August 23, 1912 – February 2, 1996) was an American tap dancer, singer, actor, film director, and choreographer. He has starred in some of the most iconic classic American musical films, including Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, and Anchors Aweigh, among others.\n\nIn 1952, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his contributions to Hollywood. He also received honors from the Kennedy Center Honors (1982), the American Film Institute, and the Screen Actors Guild. The AFI ranks Gene Kelly as the 15th greatest male film actor of all time in its 100 Years... 100 Stars list.\n\nLife[]\n\nGene Kelly was born Eugene Curran Kelly on August 23, 1912, in Pittsburgh. During the Great Depression when he was in high school, he helped make money for his family by tap dancing. After he graduated from Peabody High School and later the University of Pittsburgh, he tried to find work in New York City, but failed. After a prolonged search for work, he was hired as choreographer for the musical Hold Your Hats in his hometown in 1938. Talent scouts from Broadway discovered him a few months later, he was hired as a choreographer and lead dancer for the five-act drama Time of Your Life. His career shot upwards when he was hired as the leading actor for the Rodgers and Hart Broadway production, Pal Joey. Soon, David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures signed Gene Kelly into a contract, and his first film was For Me and My Gal, in which Kelly played opposite Judy Garland as an aspiring vaudeville actor trying to find a leading lady for his double act.\n\nKelly's contract was then picked up by Selznick's good friend Arthur Freed, of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he starred in such films like DuBarry was a Lady, Thousands Cheer, Cover Girl, Anchors Aweigh, and The Pirate, just to name a few.\n\nThe early 1950s marked a peak in Kelly's career. An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain received great reviews grossed excellently, while It's Always Fair Weather, although a box office flop, was praised by the critics, and the three of them are now considered must-see classics.\n\nBy the late 1950s into the 1960s, tap dancing musicals fell out of favor, so Kelly stopped acting in dancing roles and instead took up dramatic and, occasionally, singing roles. By the 1960s, Kelly took up directing. Some of his directing roles include Gigot (1962), A Guide for the Married Man (1966), Hello, Dolly! (1969) The Cheyenne Social Club (1971), and That's Entertainment! Part 2 (1975). His dramatic credits include Inherit the Wind (1960), Jack and the Beanstalk (1967), and Viva Knievel! (1976).\n\nKelly suffered two strokes in 1994 and 1995 before dying on February 2, 1996. His body was cremated and no funeral was organized.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nReligious views[]\n\nKelly was born and raised a devout Catholic, but because the Roman Catholic Church supported the rule of Francisco Franco, he officially severed his ties with the Church in 1939. He lived the remainder of his life as an agnostic.\n\nPolitical views[]\n\nKelly was a Democrat, but officials suspected that his wife, actress Betsy Blair was Communist, and the should be removed from MGM. Kelly successfully bailed her out by threatening to withdraw from the production of It's Always Fair Weather.\n\nAwards and honors[]\n\nKelly won numerous awards in his lifetime and even a few after his death.
