        "text": "Gene Kelly is widely considered to be one of the greatest performers of all time.\n\nThe actor has left behind a legendary body of work, showcasing the smooth moves and silky voice of the Hollywood icon.\n\nWatch the full story above\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nCurrently touring the country, the wife of the late performer, Patricia Ward Kelly, is keeping his legacy alive - recounting his life in an intimate sit-down showcase.\n\n“He was very funny. He’s not at all what everyone imagines,” Kelly said.\n\n“I think they think he’s going to be singing and dancing around the kitchen and everything. But in fact, he was such a regular guy.\n\nMore on 7NEWS.com.au\n\nFans aren’t happy Luke Perry and Cameron Boyce were forgotten at the Oscars\n\nMichael Buble’s candid confession about fame and family\n\n‘I adore you’: Brad Pitt’s emotional tribute on stage at Oscars\n\nGet more entertainment news here\n\n“One of his favourite foods was fried baloney sandwiches and cold mashed potato sandwiches, and very often I was often boiling hot dogs on the stove for him.\n\n“He would sit in front of the TV and compare a baseball game to classical ballet, and we were just listening to his incredible descriptions.\n\n“He hated going out to big parties, so he liked to sit at home by the fire and read a book and listen to Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole on the stereo.”\n\nHow they met\n\n“I was a writer on a television special, and he was the host and narrator - and the grand irony is that I did not know who Gene Kelly was,” Kelly said.\n\n“The director put me in the room with Gene, because all the women were literally scratching at the door to get at him. He was one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, and I am in the room with this guy, and he starts testing me a little bit.\n\n“By the middle of the week, I was completely enchanted. He spoke French, Italian, he read Latin, he spoke Yiddish. He was an economics major. He was just this immense mind and a true romantic.\n\n“This is a guy who used to wake me up just to go out on the balcony to see a full moon.\n\n“On Valentine’s Day, he would hand-draw cards and leave them around for me that read, ‘I’m glad you’re my wife’, and ‘roses are red, violets are pink and yellow, you’re my valentine and I’m your fellow.’”\n\nRemembering Gene Kelly\n\nPatricia was invited to write Gene Kelly’s memoir, and this has formed the basis for a special live show where she takes fans through the archives of the star’s legacy.\n\n“It’s a very intimate show, and I created it because Gene was very adamant that he wanted to known for being behind the camera more than in front as a choreographer and director,” Kelly said.\n\n“I created this for what would have been his 100th birthday, and it just took off. It is a very intimate look at him.\n\n“I did have the privilege of recording him almost every day for 10 years in some formats - sometimes on little cocktail napkins when we were listening to music at a piano bar - and I weave these stories on stage and have the beautiful clips on.”"
