        "text": "Gene Kelly, the dancer, actor, director and choreographer who brought a vigorous athleticism, casual grace and an earthy masculinity to the high romance of lavish Hollywood musicals, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 83.\n\nHis longtime publicity agent, Warren Cowan, said Mr. Kelly had never fully recovered from strokes he suffered in 1994 and last year.\n\nMr. Kelly's highly developed sense of the possibilities of dance on film invigorated classic musicals like \"Anchors Aweigh,\" \"On the Town,\" \"An American in Paris\" and \"Singin' in the Rain.\"\n\nA gifted dancer with his own vibrant style, he also flourished as an innovative choreographer and director in the 1940's and 50's, the heyday of the big, splashy Hollywood musical.\n\nMr. Kelly, who could also put over a song in a high, thin voice, brought to his films an inventive technique that enabled him to create unusual and imaginative dance routines that usually arose directly out of a plot or script situation.\n\nThus millions of moviegoers remember Mr. Kelly dancing merrily in a downpour in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" hoofing with an animated mouse, Jerry, in \"Anchors Aweigh,\" hopping over garbage cans in a sequence in \"It's Always Fair Weather\" and, with the aid of special process photography, dancing with himself in the \"alter ego\" number from \"Cover Girl.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
