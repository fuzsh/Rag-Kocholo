        "text": "GENE Kelly is famously remembered for starring in Singin' in the Rain and Cover Girl.\n\nThe late Oscar winner is survived by his third wife, Patricia Ward.\n\nWho is Gene Kelly's widow, Patricia?\n\nOn July 20, 1990, Gene Kelly tied the knot with Patricia Ward.\n\nThe latter is 47 years younger than the late Take Me Out to the Ball Game actor.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, California, Patricia is an author and public speaker.\n\nThe pair remained married until Gene's death.\n\nWhile discussing her marriage to Gene, Patricia told Fox News: \"I did not know who Gene Kelly was when I first met him.\n\n\"That always surprises people. In fact, some people think I'm making it up.\n\n\"The age issue was not an issue for me and the funny thing is, I never really even thought about it because he was so young at heart.\n\n\"And then, I didn't even add up the difference until they made a big deal.\n\n\"My parents understood and didn't see it as any problem.\n\n\"They knew I'd always kind of colored outside the lines a little bit and so it seemed perfectly natural to them.\"\n\nThe filmmaker's widow added: \"There wasn't anything strange about it.\n\n\"I hear from so many people now saying, 'Oh, my gosh, my mother would keep me home from school if a Gene Kelly movie was on' or, they watched them with their parents or grandparents and that just wasn't my upbringing.\n\n\"In a weird way, I think it was the best way to meet Gene because I came with no preconceived notions of him.\n\n\"Everybody else comes in there like, 'Oh my God, I love you,' and I didn't know who he was.\n\n\"I didn't know what he represented. I didn't know his films at all.\"\n\nHow did Gene meet Patricia?\n\nGene and Patricia first crossed paths in 1985, the latter was writing for a TV special about the Smithsonian; a special that the former happened to be hosting.\n\nAfter working on the abovementioned TV special together, Gene asked Patricia to assist him with his memoir.\n\n\"I figured it would maybe be a couple of weeks, and we ended up getting married five years into that process,\" she recalled.\n\n\"In a strange way, I'm very happy that the work came first, and the marriage came second.\n\n\"I was really committed to getting Gene's words on tape and then on paper, and making sure that I got a sense of this man that he felt had not been captured before.\"\n\nWhat was Gene's cause of death?\n\nOn February 2, 1996, 83-year-old Gene died at his Beverly Hills home after years of ill health.\n\nIn the final years of his life, he suffered two strokes that contributed to his decline.\n\nRegarding her husband's legacy, Patricia shared with the abovementioned outlet: \"Geneâ€™s never going to go away.\n\n\"I really miss his decency. I miss his integrity. He was fighting for things way ahead of the pack.\n\n\"His movies are not violent. They bring memories back instantly and will trigger the positive memories, songs, and things.\"\n\nIn addition to his widow, he is also survived by his three children; Kerry, Bridget, and Timothy."
