        "text": "GENE Kelly's widow, Patricia Ward, has opened up about the large age gap she had with the Hollywood star during their relationship.\n\nPatricia married the Singin' in the Rain star at the age of 31 when he was 78, giving them a nearly 50-year age gap.\n\n\"[The] funny thing is, I never really even thought about it because he was so young at heart,\" she told Fox News.\n\n\"He was young in the way he spoke, in his demeanor, in his brightness of his mind, certainly.\"\n\nPatricia said that she never saw a problem with their difference in age until tabloids started making a \"big deal\" out of it.\n\nShe added that her parents never saw any issues with their age difference as well, despite meeting when Patricia was 26 and he was 73.\n\nThe couple met in 1985 when Patricia was writing for a TV special about the Smithsonian - a special that Gene happened to be hosting.\n\nAfter working on the TV special together, the Xanadu star asked Patricia to assist him with his memoir.\n\nThe two were married from 1990 until Gene's death in 1996 at the age of 83.\n\nPatricia later admitted to The Irish Times that she lied about her age when they tied the knot, claiming to be 36 when she was only 31.\n\nGene died at his Beverly Hills home after years of ill health, including two strokes that contributed to his decline.\n\nPatricia was Gene's third wife, and he shares three children from previous marriages.\n\nJUDGEMENT-FREE\n\nWhile speaking with the outlet, Patricia also admitted she didn't know who the famous actor was when they met.\n\n\"That always surprises people. In fact, some people think I'm making it up,\" she said.\n\nShe explained that meeting him without any preconceived notions was the \"best way\" to get to know him.\n\n\"Everybody else comes in there like, 'Oh my God, I love you,' and I didn't know who he was,\" she said.\n\nI really miss his decency. I miss his integrity. He was fighting for things way ahead of the pack.\n\nPatricia Ward\n\n\"I didn't know what he represented. I didn't know his films at all.\"\n\nALWAYS REMEMBERED\n\nSince Gene's passing, Patricia has opened up about how his legacy will live on in his iconic roles.\n\n\"Geneâ€™s never going to go away,\" she said.\n\n\"I really miss his decency. I miss his integrity. He was fighting for things way ahead of the pack.\n\n\"His movies are not violent. They bring memories back instantly and will trigger the positive memories, songs, and things.\""
