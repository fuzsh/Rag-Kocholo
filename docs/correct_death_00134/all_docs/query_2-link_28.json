Kelly attended St. Raphael School in Morningside and graduated from Peabody High School in 1929. He began his college career in journalism at Penn State University, but returned home after the Crash of 1929 to help with family finances. Kelly then enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh and in 1933 received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics.\n\nAfter initially struggling with his career, Kelly found success and would ultimately be recognized as multi-talented individual excelling at acting, singing, dancing, choreographing, producing, as well as motion picture directing. Two of Kelly's most acclaimed performances are his roles in \"An American in Paris\" (1951) and in \"Singing in the Rain\" (1952). Kelly's personal life included three marriages; the first to Betsy Blair with whom he had one child (Kerry), a second to Jeanne Coyne with whom he had two children (Bridget and Tim) and, after Jeanne's death, to Patricia Ward.\n\nGene Kelly died in his sleep at his home in Beverly Hills, California, on February 2, 1996, leaving a legacy of dance, drama, and a host of fans.\n\nCustodial History\n\nBetween the dates of June 22 and June 29 of 1993, approximately 0.3 cubic feet of materials pertaining to the University of Pittsburgh's most famous alumni, Gene Kelly, was donated to the University Archives by retired Pitt Stewardship Administrator, Virginia Nicklas.\n\nMs. Nicklas, an avid fan of Mr. Kelly, had been collecting various material on Kelly since 1942. As a member of the Office of Development and Alumni Affairs, Ms. Nicklas obtained the unique assignment of contacting Mr. Kelly to encourage him to become active in assisting the University in fundraising. As part of her job, Virginia Nicklas came into the acquaintance of Mr. Kelly in 1971. She deposited this collection of materials in the University Archives to document the relationship that developed between the University and Gene Kelly.\n\nAcquisition Information\n\nGift of Virginia Nicklas in June 1993 and June 1996.\n\nSubjects\n\nCorporate Names\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh.
