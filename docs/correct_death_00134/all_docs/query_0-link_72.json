        "text": "One fire blamed on a Christmas tree killed three children and their wheelchair-bound grandmother in Florida early today and a similar blaze destroyed the California home of actor-dancer Gene Kelly but caused only minor injuries.\n\nTwo elderly residents of a senior citizen's complex in Seattle died in a fire late Wednesday, raising the 24-hour toll from fires to at least 13.\n\nOfficials said Robert G. and Rose M. Berry, ages unknown, lived in the unit of the seven-story building where the fire started. Officials speculated the fire began in an electric heater placed too close to a bed. Three children and their wheelchair-bound grandmother died when lights ignited an artificial Christmas tree in Tampa, Fla., early today.\n\nA neighbor out for a post-midnight walk called the fire department and trained his garden hose on the fire.\n\n'It was just like throwing a cup of water over the fire,' said Gerard Fordoms. 'I tried to help 'em, but there wasn't nothing I could do.'\n\nKilled were Gussie Robinson, 61, and Bernard Keel Jr., 12; Robert Keel, 8; and Kwatia Keel, 4. The youngsters were found in their bedrooms and Mrs. Robinson in her wheelchair in a hallway outside the bathroom.\n\nA fire department inspector said it appeared the fire started 'in the Christmas tree wiring.'\n\nFirefighters in Beverly Hills, Calif., said Kelly and his son, Timothy, suffered minor burns on their hands when fire consumed their two-story wood-frame home. Kelly's daughter, Brigit, escaped unharmed.\n\n'The cause is still under investigation, but the initial investigation shows it was a Christmas tree,' said fire spokesman Charles Alvey.\n\nNear Detroit, police charged Robert Gambrell, 22, with setting fire to a room in a motel. His daughter Michelle, 2, died and he was treated for smoke inhalation and burns.\n\nHis girl friend, Shelly Hennings, said Gambrell had taken their child for a visit earlier in the week and called her from a motel and threatened to kill their child and himself.\n\n'I didn't think he'd do it,' she said. 'I guess I was wrong.'\n\nIn suburban St. Louis, an elderly man died and his infant grandson was missing and presumed dead today in a fire that began in an electric heater in their home.\n\nPine Lawn, Mo., police said an electric heater set fire to some bedroom curtains. The grandfather's body was found in the kitchen and searchers looked for the tot's body.\n\nThe bodies of a 2-year-old Kevin Bills and his pet cat were found huddled Wednesday night behind a bureau after fire struck a Hyde Park, Mass., apartment building.\n\nFire officials, who blamed the blaze on worn electrical wiring, said his father had led three other children to safety and did not realize Kevin had been left behind.\n\n'We were not told about the little boy until after we had been there,' said Deputy Chief John Harrison. 'Much, much later.' In addition:\n\n-Two people died in Maine -- an 18-month-old boy in a Portland apartment house blaze and an 80-year-old woman when her Sumner home burned to the ground in a fire blamedon a wood stove.\n\n-A 12-year-old girl died in a fire in her New Orleans home in which her mother and cat suffered smoke inhalation.\n\n-A fire blamed on a maintenance man using a blowtorch to thaw frozen pipes forced the evacuation this morning of about 100 people from an Aurora, Colo., apartment house.\n\nAn 11-year-old Delaware boy remained in critical condition from burns suffered in a fire Wedneday that killed his parents and a brother.\n\nWilliam Joseph Smith, 11, was the only survivor of a fire that was touched off by a kerosene heater in a Wilmington, Del., row house early Wednesday morning, fire investigators said."
