        "text": "2023 was a tough year for the biopharma industry, with several companies downsizing and restructuring their workforces to stay afloat. There are signs of recovery, as mergers and acquisitions picked up across the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in the latter part of 2023 and have continued their upswing into 2024. Will the job market follow suit?\n\nBioSpace will continue to be your source of news on job cuts and restructuring initiatives throughout 2024. Follow along as we keep you up to date on which companies are tightening their belts and cutting staff.\n\nJuly 18\n\nAslan Pharmaceuticals is liquidating its assets and has terminated all of its employees, the Singapore-based biopharma announced Wednesday. Its directors had determined “that ASLAN SG cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business,” according to the announcement. The company also said it had received a delisting determination from the Nasdaq on July 15 “due to its failure to meet continued listing requirements,” and that it elected not to request a hearing about the determination.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, as of the end of 2023 Aslan had 20 employees in Singapore, 14 in the U.S. and one in the U.K.\n\nJuly 16\n\nCaribou Biosciences has parted with 21 people—12% of its workforce—as it discontinues preclinical development of allogeneic CAR-NK therapies, the company reported to the SEC on Tuesday. The filing added that the layoffs will be completed by the end of the third quarter and that its cash runway will be extended into the second half of 2026 as it focuses resources on its allogeneic (or off-the-shelf) CAR T cell therapy platform.\n\nJuly 12\n\nRoche’s Spark Therapeutics is laying off staffers and halting some of its early-stage programs, Endpoints News reported Thursday. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based gene therapy biotech told the publication that the company is pivoting its strategy to “accelerate its pipeline and help bring more therapies to patients sooner, but this move will include ‘organizational changes.’” Notifications about employment were sent out this week, although no indication was given of how many people would be let go.\n\nSpark has two late-stage trials in hemophilia A and hemophilia B in its pipeline and an early-stage asset for treating Pompe disease.

The outlet notes that the move follows multiple other layoffs this year at Thermo Fisher facilities across the U.S.\n\nNov. 8:\n\nSQZ Biotechnologies is reducing its workforce by approximately 80%, the company noted Wednesday in its third-quarter earnings release. The cell therapy company has between 51–200 employees, according to its LinkedIn page. In July, Roche announced that it would not expand a years-long collaboration with SQZ around products to target HPV16-positive solid tumors, despite positive preliminary Phase I results released earlier this year.\n\nNov. 8:\n\nRegenxbio is reducing its workforce by 15%, the company announced Wednesday. Regenxbio said the restructuring will extend its cash runway into 2025 and that it will prioritize its candidate treatments for wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and mucopolysaccharidosis type II. The staffing cuts will come “primarily in rare neurodegenerative disease development, early research, and other general and administrative areas,” according to the announcement. Regenxbio has between 201–500 employees, according to its LinkedIn page.\n\nNov. 7:\n\nLyell Immunopharma will reduce its workforce by approximately 25%, the company announced on Tuesday, with Chief Medical Officer Tina Albertson among those to part ways with the company. “We have restructured our company to prioritize investment in our clinical-stage programs and core research platforms and have streamlined operations,” said Lyell President and CEO Lynn Seely in the announcement. The company had reported having 274 employees as of the end of 2022.\n\nEndpoints News noted that Lyell, which specializes in T-cell cancer therapies, was valued at more than $4 billion when it went public in 2021 but is now worth about $550 million. A year ago, GSK terminated a deal with the company to discover and develop T-cell therapies using Lyell’s technologies.\n\nNov. 7:\n\nArbutus Biopharma is cutting 24% of its staff, the company announced Tuesday along with updates on its candidate therapies to functionally cure chronic hepatitis B.

McElhaugh will serve as interim CEO. Arbutus has between 51–200 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile.\n\nNov. 7:\n\nPyxis Oncology is cutting its headcount by approximately 40%, the company announced on Tuesday. According to the announcement, the layoffs and other cost-cutting measures will extend the company’s cash runway to early 2026 as it prioritizes two candidates currently in Phase I trials, antibody-drug conjugate PYX-201 and immune-oncology therapeutic PYX-106.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn page, Pyxis currently has between 51–100 employees.\n\nNov. 7:\n\nPfizer is cutting about 100 jobs at its manufacturing plant in Newbridge, Kildare, Ireland as part of its drive to cut $3.5 billion in costs. The move, reported by Fierce Pharma, theIrish Independent, and other outlets, comes as the company says it plans to expand at other sites in Ireland, adding 230 positions in Dublin and Cork.\n\nNov. 3:\n\nPfizer is laying off around 200 employees at its manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan amid declining sales for its COVID-19 products, according to television station Fox 17. Friday’s news comes as the company struggles to regain its financial footing from the sharp decline in its COVID-19 business. In an attempt to weather the downturn, Pfizer last month launched a widespread cost-cutting initiative designed to generate $3.5 billion in savings through 2024.\n\nNov. 2:\n\nLocanabio, a company that aimed to develop RNA-editing therapies, will shutter by the end of the year, CEO Jim Burns announced on LinkedIn Thursday. “While we continue to believe in the potential of our RNA-targeted gene therapy platform to deliver transformative therapies, the decision was made due to the time and capital required to deliver clinical data in the current challenging funding environment,” he wrote. The closure was confirmed by Fierce Biotech. Locanabio, based in San Diego, has between 51–200 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile.\n\nNov. 2:\n\nKronos Bio will reduce its staff by 19%, the company announced Thursday just after releasing positive preliminary Phase I/II trial data on its antitumor candidate KB-0742. The company also has a therapy, lanraplenib, in development for FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia. “By streamlining our operations and extending our runway, we best position the company to optimally fund our KB-0742 clinical studies while continuing to focus on the clinical development of lanraplenib, the advancement of our maturing discovery projects, and our collaboration with Genentech,” said Kronos CEO Norbert Bischofberger in the company’s statement.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, Kronos had 97 employees at the beginning of this year. The company said its restructuring will extend its cash runway into 2026.\n\nNov. 2:\n\nSeres Therapeutics will undergo a restructuring that includes reducing its workforce by 41%—approximately 160 positions—the company announced Thursday as it touted positive sales data for its microbiome therapeutic, Vowst. “Given the realities of this challenging financial environment for biopharmaceutical companies, we believe that concentrating our resources on VOWST offers an attractive opportunity for targeted revenue growth, while operating in a more capital efficient manner,” said Seres President and CEO Eric Shaff in the statement.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Seres will prioritize Vowst’s commercial launch going forward, as well as an ongoing Phase IB study on the microbiome therapeutic candidate SER-155. It will scale back “all non-partnered R&D programs and activities.”\n\nNov. 1:\n\nRani Therapeutics will cut its workforce by 25%, the company announced Wednesday. The company, which is developing orally administered biologics, will halt or pause development of several of its candidate therapies while moving others into Phase I or II trials and expanding its manufacturing capabilities.

Rani has between 51–200 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile.\n\nNov. 1:\n\nSangamo Therapeutics is shuttering its Brisbane, California headquarters and cutting its U.S. workforce by approximately 162 people—40% of its total headcount—the company announced Wednesday. Among those to be let go are Chief Operating Officer D. Mark McClung and Chief Scientific Officer Jason Fontenot.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, Sangamo will transition its headquarters to its Richmond, California facility and cease investment for now in its investigative treatment for Fabry disease and in CAR-Treg cell therapy as it searches for partners to continue development of those programs. The company will instead focus on “epigenetic regulation therapies treating neurological diseases and novel AAV capsid delivery technologies,” according to the announcement. Sangamo expects that the restructuring will cut its operating expenses in half, allowing its funds to stretch into the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOctober\n\nOct. 30:\n\nGalapagos and Alfasigma have signed a letter of intent to transfer Galapagos’s Jyseleca (filgotinib) to Alfasigma. The potential deal, announced by Galapagos on Monday, would involve the transfer of approximately 400 employees to Alfasigma, while 100 others would be laid off. “Looking ahead, the planned transaction is expected to free up significant resources across the organization, enabling us to invest more in our R&D growth areas, business development and M&A,” said Galapagos CEO and Chairman Paul Stoffels in the company’s announcement.\n\nJyseleca is marketed in Europe and Japan for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Earlier this year, it failed to meet primary endpoints in a Phase III trial for Crohn’s disease.\n\nOct. 30:\n\n“Pfizer is in the process of closing its Peapack, New Jersey facility that will go in effect in early 2024,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to BioSpace. “The vast majority of colleagues will be re-assigned to Pfizer’s New York headquarters at 66 Hudson Yards with a small portion transitioning to the company’s Parsippany, NJ site. This follows a previously communicated decision in 2021 of plans to sell the Peapack campus.” The spokesperson added that if employees do not want to be reassigned to a different site, their employment will terminate.\n\nThe facility closure coincides with the company’s announcement two weeks ago that it will be cutting $3.5 billion in costs due to disappointing sales of the COVID-19 therapeutic Paxlovid, as well as the Comirnaty vaccine. New Jersey is far from the only site to feel the effects of the cuts; Fierce Pharma notes that Pfizer has also announced the closure of two facilities in North Carolina and reported an unspecified number of layoffs in Colorado.\n\nCorrection (Oct. 30): This story has been updated from its original version to reflect the fact that 791 employees are not being laid off in New Jersey, but rather are being transferred to new work sites. BioSpace regrets the error.\n\nOct. 26:\n\nElevateBio is cutting 13% of its workforce, a company spokesperson told Fierce Biotech Thursday. The Massachusetts-based company is involved in gene editing, RNA, cell, vector engineering, protein and induced pluripotent stem cell technologies; it is not clear how many employees it has. The cuts, to staff involved in the company’s preclinical work, come despite a $401 million Series D financing round that closed in May.\n\n“Our financial position and balance sheet are very strong and we are experiencing robust customer and revenue growth,” the spokesperson told Fierce Biotech.\n\nOct. 24:\n\nAmgen is letting go of 350 employees following its $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, according to several media reports on Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will affect Horizon roles that overlap with existing teams at Amgen, a company spokesperson told Fierce Pharma. More than 80% of Horizon’s staff will be absorbed into Amgen roles, “reflecting the knowledge and capabilities we need to continue serving patients suffering from rare diseases,” a spokesperson for the California-based biopharma said. At the end of 2022, Horizon had more than 2,100 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nThis is Amgen’s third round of layoffs this year.\n\nOct. 24:\n\nBrainStorm Cell Therapeutics will lay off 30% of its staff, the Israel and New York–based company announced Tuesday. The cost-cutting measure narrows the company’s focus in the wake of a vote by an FDA advisory committee last month against approving its amyotrophic lateral sclerosis candidate NurOwn, and BrainStorm’s subsequent decision to withdraw its Biologics License Application and conduct a Phase IIIb clinical trial on the therapy.\n\nAccording to the company’s announcement, the layoffs are part of “a strategic realignment to enable accelerated development of NurOwn.” Among those let go is EVP and Chief Medical Officer Kirk Taylor, whose responsibilities included leading launch activities.\n\nAs of June 30, BrainStorm reported that it had 44 employees between the U.S. and Israel.\n\nOct. 24:\n\nIdorsia Pharmaceuticals has reduced the workforce at its headquarters in Switzerland by half, the company announced on Tuesday. “Approximately 475 positions at headquarters in Allschwil, Switzerland, have been made redundant through a combination of canceling open positions, not replacing people who are known to leave (outside the mass dismissal), and up to 300 terminations mainly in Research & Development and the associated support functions,” the announcement states.\n\nEndpoints News noted that sales of Idorsia’s insomnia drug, Quviviq, have so far been disappointing. According to the company’s announcement, its cash runway now extends into next year. “Our short-term priority is to further extend our cash runway and we are actively reviewing all avenues including potential out-license deals with a few balls in the air that we expect to catch in the upcoming months,” Chief Financial Officer André C. Muller said in the statement.\n\nOct. 19:\n\nBase-editing company Beam Therapeutics will lay off about 100 employees—20% of its workforce—it announced on Thursday. The move is part of a restructuring plan aimed at funding the company into 2026. Beam’s priorities going forward will include development of its sickle cell disease programs, a base editor to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and in vivo editing to treat liver disorders, while its hepatitis B program “will be paused and designated for partnering,” according to the announcement. Reuters reported that shares of the company declined by 2.4% in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nOct. 16:\n\nCell therapy company Nkarta is laying off 18 people, about 10% of its staff, it revealed in an SEC filing. The morning after the filing, the company announced that the FDA has cleared its Investigational New Drug application for NKX019, its CAR NK cell therapy candidate for lupus nephritis. The announcement also notes “cost containment measures designed to extend its projected cash runway by one year into 2026.” Nkarta President and CEO Paul Hastings told Fierce Biotech that the workforce cuts will take place “across the board,” in accordance with the company’s aim to focus on its later-stage programs.\n\nNkarta’s stock price rose by 112% following its announcement of the FDA clearance, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nOct. 13:\n\nPfizer late Friday launched a sweeping cost-cutting initiative aimed at generating $3.5 billion in savings through 2024 as the company weathers a steep decline in the sales of its COVID-19 products.\n\nPfizer said the “multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program” will involve layoffs, though it is still unclear how many employees will be affected. As of August 1, Pfizer employed approximately 83,000 people worldwide.\n\nOct. 11:\n\nSana Biotechnology will lay off 29% of its workforce—approximately 120 people—as part of a portfolio realignment initiative, the company announced on Tuesday. Sana will narrow its R&D focus to its ex vivo cell therapy platform and move away from an in vivo gene delivery program with an eye toward reducing its 2024 operating cash burn to below $200 million. According to the company, this will allow Sana’s current cash runway to extend further into 2025 while also providing leeway for investments in clinical capabilities across various indications.\n\nTuesday’s downsizing follows a previous round of layoffs in August, which was first revealed through a series of LinkedIn posts made by company employees. Sana later confirmed the downsizing to Endpoints News, but did not disclose exactly how many were let go. The biotech also underwent a strategic reorganization in November 2022, which included a workforce reduction of around 15%.\n\nOct. 9:\n\nBiogen is laying off 113 employees from Reata Pharmaceuticals’ Plano, Texas site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification notice. The layoffs, set to take effect in late November, come just months after Biogen acquired Reata for $7.3 billion in July 2023.\n\nAt the time, Biogen had just launched a sweeping cost-reduction program that involved terminating around 1,000 employees in an effort to save $1 billion in operating expenses by 2025. Late last month, Biogen completed the acquisition of Reata. At the end of 2022, Reata had 321 employees, according to its annual report to the SEC.\n\nOct. 7:\n\nEikon Therapeutics has laid off some of its staff in a bid for efficiency, Fierce Biotech reported. The outlet obtained an Oct. 5 internal letter to staff from Eikon CEO Roger Perlmutter that reads in part, “As I discussed at the all-hands meeting last month, our recent success in advancing new programs requires that we become more selective in allocating our resources,” and “the plain fact is that our company, like all companies, must evolve to become more efficient.”\n\nEikon, which emerged from stealth in 2021, uses live-cell super-resolution microscopy and engineering for drug development, but Fierce Biotech calls it “famously tight-lipped about the discovery process.” The company has a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist in a Phase I trial to treat advanced solid tumors, and last month announced that it has integrated TLR 7 and 8 co-agonists into its clinical development program and that it plans to begin a Phase I trial on its PARP1 inhibitor—another experimental cancer drug developed with Impact Therapeutics—this year.\n\nOct. 5:\n\nNorth Carolina-based gene therapy biotech Atsena Therapeutics recently laid off an undisclosed number of employees to conserve cash, multiple sources reported Thursday. Atsena has also raised about $24.5 million of a targeted $32 million in an insider-led Series B round, the company told Endpoints News. Atsena is expecting data from a Phase I/II trial of its lead program, ATSN-101, targeting the retinal disease Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) by the end of this year, Endpoints reported. It kicked off another Phase I/II trial of a second gene therapy, ATSN-201, for RS1-associated X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)—a rare congenital retinal disease—in August.\n\nOct. 5:\n\nuniQure is laying off 114 people, about 20% of its total workforce, the gene therapy company announced Thursday. The company “will discontinue more than half of its research and technology projects, including AMT-210 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and multiple undisclosed programs,” according to the announcement, while focusing on AAV capsid development and treatments in development for ALS and Alzheimer’s disease. uniQure will also continue several clinical-stage programs, including an investigational treatment for Huntington’s currently in Phase I/II trials.\n\nThe company said the moves will save $180 million, extending its cash runway into 2027. As part of the restructuring, Chief Scientific Officer Ricardo Dolmetsch is leaving the company, and uniQure executive Richard Porter will assume a new role as chief business and scientific officer.\n\nOct. 3:\n\nKezar Life Sciences is laying off 41% of its workforce and its CEO and chief medical officer will step down as part of a restructuring, the company announced Tuesday. Kezar has paused all of its research and drug discovery efforts, according to the announcement, as it focuses on shoring up enough funds for its Phase IIb clinical trial of the experimental drug zetomipzomib in lupus nephritis. The company anticipates having top-line data from that trial in mid-2026, with data from its Phase I trial of a drug for solid tumors and a Phase IIa trial of zetomipzomib in autoimmune hepatitis expected in the meantime.\n\nCompany co-founder and member of the board Christopher Kirk will replace fellow co-founder John Fowler as CEO, and Zung To, the current senior vice president for clinical development operations, will step into the role of chief medical officer.\n\nOct 2:\n\nSyros Pharmaceuticals is laying off 35% of its workforce, and its CEO and chief science officer are also departing, the company announced Monday. Syros said it is ending a Phase I trial of a potential treatment for a type of leukemia, as well as earlier-stage work on that drug, to focus on tamibarotene, another blood cancer treatment that is currently in Phase II and III trials.\n\nCEO Nancy Simonian, who has led the company since 2012, will retire in December, the company said, but she will remain on the board of directors. Replacing her will be Conley Chee, currently Syros’ chief commercial officer and chief business officer. Chief Scientific Officer Eric Olson will depart the company later this month. Syros had 117 employees as of the end of 2022, according to its most recent SEC filing.\n\nSeptember\n\nSept 28:\n\nPTC Therapeutics announced Thursday it is laying off a further 25% of its workforce. The move continues a restructuring the company began in May, when PTC laid off 8% of its employees and announced that it would discontinue several early-stage gene therapy development programs. Thursday’s announcement notes that the company “continues to focus its resources on its differentiated, high potential R&D programs and on support of the robust global commercial infrastructure.” It adds that PTC will submit a re-examination request regarding a recent decision by the EU’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending against renewal of conditional authorization for Translarna for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nIn its most recent annual filing, at the end of 2022, PTC reported that it had 1,410 employees.\n\nSept 26:\n\nDenmark–based biotech Galecto is searching for strategic alternatives after its lead lung disease asset failed the primary efficacy endpoint in a mid-stage trial in August. On Tuesday, the company announced it would lay off approximately 70% of its workforce—which equates to about 30 people. As part of its business evaluation, Galecto is also considering a number of opportunities, including an acquisition, merger, business combination or divestiture of assets, technologies or capabilities.\n\nFollowing the Phase IIb trial failure, Galecto announced it would discontinue development of GB0139, which was being developed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The company also stated it was re-evaluating its options and resource allocation plans “with the goal of extending our cash runway into 2025.”\n\nSept 26:\n\nIn a “workforce realignment,” AM-Pharma announced Tuesday it has completed a workforce reduction but did not provide specific numbers. The Netherlands–based biopharma is also switching it up at the top, with Juliane Bernholz—currently chief operating officer—succeeding Erik van den Berg as CEO.\n\nThese moves come nearly a year after AM-Pharma halted a pivotal Phase III trial of its recombinant alkaline phosphatase, ilofotase alfa, in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury after it failed the primary endpoint of rate of all-cause deaths at 28 days.\n\nSept 26:\n\nFrench biopharma Poxel is seeking new financing to initiate Phase II proof-of-concept studies for its adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) assets, PXL770 and PXL065, and to “execute its rare diseases strategy.”\n\nIn the same announcement, the company disclosed that its headcount now stands at 15 employees, which compares to 37 at the end of December 2022 and 16 at the end of August, according to reporting by Endpoints News. Poxel is also taking a $17.6 million impairment, which “aims to best reflect the current value of PXL065” and takes into account the need to “obtain additional financing to pursue its development plan in NASH [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis] or ALD,” along with its current market capitalization and the macroeconomic context in which the company operates.\n\nSept 22:\n\nIt took more than four months, but ImmunityBio is laying off 48 staffers after failing to win approval in May for its bladder cancer therapy. The layoffs, which were revealed in a Sept. 19 California WARN notice, affect employees at the company’s El Segundo, California site, as well as remote workers who report to that site, Fierce Biotech reported on Friday.\n\nIn May, the company, headed by Patrick Soon-Shiong, had received a Complete Response Letter for the bladder cancer hopeful in which the FDA cited deficiencies with its third-party contract manufacturer. It’s also the biopharma’s second round of layoffs in less than a year. In October 2022, ImmunityBio parted with 30 employees due to “economic reasons” at a New York facility that was expected to expand the company’s manufacturing footprint.\n\nOn Sept. 11, the company announced it had taken on a $200 million convertible debt note from Nant Entities, an affiliate associated with Soon-Shiong, its founder, executive chair and global chief scientific and medical officer.\n\nSept 19:\n\nNightHawk Biosciences is flying in a different direction as it turfs its R&D business in favor of its contract development and manufacturing organization, Scorpius Biomanufacturing. The plan will see NightHawk part with 13 employees in the R&D business, the equivalent of 14% of its workforce. The company believes the pivot “represent(s) its best opportunity for success” and said in an SEC filing that the layoffs, which will take place immediately, are expected to save $1.8 million in annual compensation.\n\nScorpius—a Texas-based CDMO specializing in mammalian, microbial and cell- and gene-based therapies—brought in $700,000 during the second quarter of 2023, Fierce Biotech reported, while the R&D business cost NightHawk $5.7 million in the same timeframe, according to the company’s Q2 business update.\n\nSept 19:\n\nAfter a fresh start as Fresh Tracks Therapeutics a year ago, the company formerly known as Brickell Biotech will shut its doors for good. Fresh Tracks will discontinue all of its clinical and preclinical development programs and lay off “most employees” by early October, according to a statement issued Tuesday. The Colorado–based company had undertaken an “extensive” search for strategic alternatives, following which the Board of Directors decided to liquidate and dissolve the outfit. Certain employees, consultants and advisors will remain to oversee the wind-down of the company.\n\nFresh Tracks officially changed its name in September 2022 to reflect its strategic shift toward developing groundbreaking autoimmune and inflammatory disease therapies.\n\nSept 18:\n\nHistogen is history. The San Diego–based biotech, which is focused on treating infectious diseases, announced that “after extensive consideration of potential strategic alternatives,” it will close its doors. Accordingly, Histogen is discontinuing all clinical development programs and will let most employees go by the end of September.\n\n“The Board of Directors and management devoted substantial time and effort in identifying and pursuing various opportunities, but we were unable to complete a transaction that would allow us the potential to enhance stockholder value,” Steven J. Mento, president and CEO of Histogen, said in a statement.\n\nSept 18:\n\nBay area-based Kinnate Biopharma is undertaking a “reprioritization and workforce restructuring” plan that will reduce by 70% its current employees. The review, which considers the company’s cash runway, near-term pipeline value creation prospects, the evolving regulatory landscape for targeted therapies and other factors, will see Kinnate left with 28 full-time staff members, according to a press release issued Monday. The layoffs include all employees at Kinnate’s Chinese subsidiary, Kinnjiu Biopharma.\n\nThe cancer-focused company will focus its attention on KIN-8741, an exarafenib/binimetinib combination being developed for a range of solid tumors where c-MET is overexpressed, and its brain-penetrant CDK4 selective program, for which it plans to nominate a candidate in the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, it has paused development of KIN-7136, a brain-penetrant MEK inhibitor for MAPK pathway-driven solid tumors.\n\nSept 15:\n\nNearly two months after Lyndra Therapeutics replaced CEO Patricia Hurter with Executive President and Chief Operations Officer Jessica Ballinger, the Watertown, Mass.–based company is laying off nearly a quarter of its staff, Endpoints News reported. The layoffs are the result of the company’s decision to outsource commercial manufacturing and partner on both the development and commercialization of “all future products,” a spokesperson told Endpoints on Friday. Lyndra, which in 2019 teamed up with Gilead to develop and market ultra-long-acting oral HIV therapies, is expecting a top-line data readout from a pivotal trial of its long-lasting schizophrenia drug in “the next weeks,” the spokesperson said, “and we feel these changes will set us up to successfully navigate the regulatory pathway ahead and ultimately bring oral weekly medications to patients.”\n\nSept 12:\n\nA “convergence” of factors led to the announcement that 2seventy bio will lay off approximately 40% of its staff in a sweeping reorganization that includes the departure of CEO Nick Leschly. On an investor call Tuesday, Leschly cited the “difficult and unpredictable macro environment” as the rationale behind the decision but added that delays experienced by the company’s later-stage programs and “complicated Abecma commercial dynamic” were also factors. Abcema is 2seventy’s approved treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The company will also advance fewer pipeline programs, according to the announcement.\n\nThe workforce reduction—which represents 176 roles—is expected to generate an annualized cost savings of at least $65 million.\n\nSept 11:\n\nIsrael–based Enlivex Therapeutics is doubling down on its inflammatory and autoimmune indications—and tagging its oncology programs for either external collaborations or out-licensing—resulting in a 50% workforce reduction. In a press release issued Monday, Enlivex stated it expects the cuts and reclassification of the oncology indications to extend its cash runway through the end of 2025. As part of this push, the company has initiated a new program in osteoarthritis after preclinical evidence from its most advanced candidate, Allocetra, showed promise in this indication. Enlivex’s most advanced program is in organ failure associated with sepsis.\n\nSept 6:\n\nCSL Vifor will be 85 employees lighter at its California location as of Oct. 25. CSL Vifor—which was established following the completion of CSL’s $11.7B acquisition of Vifor Pharma in August 2022—revealed the cuts in a California WARN notice. The addition brought Vifor’s iron deficiency and kidney disease portfolios under CSL’s extensive umbrella.\n\nThe layoffs are the result of a strategic review that found changes to the U.S. commercial business were required “in light of [CSL Vifor’s] current portfolio of marketed products and near to mid-term prospects to deliver cost, revenue and growth synergies,” a company spokesperson told Fierce Pharma in an email.\n\nSept 5:\n\nThe hits just keep coming for Infinity Pharmaceuticals, which in July laid off approximately 78% of its workforce—or 21 employees—after the company’s planned merger with MEI Pharma broke down. On Friday, Infinity’s depleted board—the company reduced its board members from eight to five in July—terminated CEO Adelene Perkins and Chief Medical Officer Robert Ilaria Jr. as part of the ongoing restructuring plan, Seeking Alpha reported. Another three employees were also let go. As of Sept. 5, Infinity’s website lists Seth Tasker as CEO and the lone member of the leadership team.\n\nAugust\n\nAug 31:\n\nThe Labor Day long weekend began on a sour note for more than half of the employees at Maryland–based NexImmune. The biotech, which is developing immunotherapies for cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases, announced it will lay off approximately 53% of its staff, turning a workforce of 47 full-time employees into one of just 22 as of September 5. The move was designed to reduce costs and extend the company’s cash, according to the announcement. The departures include chief financial officer John Trainer, whose final day was listed as September 2.\n\n“The workforce reduction protects our core capabilities to advance novel therapeutic candidates and our multiplex validation of functional antigen-specific T cell responses while giving us additional flexibility to manage our business,” CEO Kristi Jones said in the announcement.\n\nAug 31:\n\nOn the cusp of receiving its first clinical data—for SC291, a CD19-targeted allogeneic CAR T cell therapy—Sana Biotechnology is laying off an undisclosed number of its staff.\n\nThe revelation is based on about half a dozen LinkedIn posts recently made by Sana employees, according toEndpoints News, which reported the layoffs on Thursday.\n\n“Due to company restructuring and downsizing, my role, and the role of many of my incredible colleagues, have been eliminated,” Cole Delyea, a senior research associate, posted on the business networking platform.
