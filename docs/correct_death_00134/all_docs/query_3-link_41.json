        "text": "Bryan Gene Kelly, born on January 18, 1984, was tragically taken from his family and friends on December 10, 2011. Bryan leaves behind his wife, Chantel, and his daughters, Grace Anne and Jayda Lee, whom he loved more than anything else in the world. They were everything to him and they were his life. He also leaves behind his mother, June Darbin, father, Ken Kelly and step-mother Susan Kelly, as well as two sisters, Stacey Herman-Hoffman and family and Christy Herman and family, one brother, Kenny McDaniel, grandmother Melba Ann Wilkie, many aunts, uncles, cousins Wesley Coatney, Jr. ,Miles Harper and Wesley Davis who were like brothers to him and an Aunt Debbie Coatney and Glenn Kalchusdah who treated Bryan like a son and other family members who all loved him very much. He is preceded in death by his Grandmother and Grandfather Alfont. With his recent giving of himself to the Lord, we believe that he is with his grandparents and his Heavenly Father looking down upon us.\n\nBryan loved camping and fishing. He could walk for miles to find the right place to throw in his fishing line and could stay out all night in Melba cat-fishing. He always had a good time with his male cousins duck hunting, camping at his favorite spots, or just getting together to catch up on their lives. His favorite time was time spent with his girls playing horse with them both on his back, taking them fishing, and teaching them to play chess. He also loved music and traveling. He thrived on the cultural experiences traveling from Mexico to Canada and Alaska with his father Ken and Susan and family or taking a trip to Texas with his mother, June.\n\nBryan was a gentle soul and when he walked into a room he filled the room with his calm spirit. Rest with Jesus, sweet Bryan, we love you very much and will miss you. You will always be in our hearts.\n\nA viewing will be held on Friday, December 16, 2011 at the Nampa Funeral Home, Yraguen Chapel from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M. A celebration of his life will be held at 2:30 P.M. Saturday, Dec. 17, 2011 at the Christian Faith Center, 31 S. Midland Blvd, Nampa.\n\nBryan loved wildflowers and plants, or in lieu of flowers there is also an account setup for Bryanâ€™s little girls at Capital Educators Credit Union."
