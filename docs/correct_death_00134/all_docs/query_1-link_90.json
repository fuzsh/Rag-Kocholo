        "text": "Debbie Reynolds, who starred opposite Gene Kelly in the 1952 musical Singin' in the Rain, has died a day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher.\n\nThe US actress, 84, had been rushed to hospital with a suspected stroke.\n\nHer son, Todd Fisher, said the stress of his sister's death had been too much for her and in her last words, she had said she wanted to be with Carrie.\n\nUS actress Bette Midler said, external Reynolds was \"devoted to her craft\" and that her death was \"too hard to comprehend\".\n\nActress Debra Messing said Reynolds, her on-screen mother in sitcom Will and Grace, had been an \"inspiration\".\n\n\"A legend of course,\" she wrote in a statement. \"The epitome of clean-cut American optimism, dancing with Gene Kelly as an equal, a warrior woman who never stopped working.''\n\nActor Rip Torn, who worked with Reynolds in her Las Vegas stage show, said: \"I was blessed to work with this remarkable woman for 45 almost 50 years. That makes for a very rare bond and unique relationship.\n\n\"She was generous to a fault, never caring who got the laugh from the audience. I will always love her.\"\n\nVeteran comic actress Carol Channing agreed: \"She was beautiful and generous. It seems like only yesterday she was having lunch here at the house and we were discussing the possibility of working together in a new show.\"\n\nFor Star Trek actor William Shatner, Reynolds was one of the last of the Hollywood royalty.\n\n\"It breaks my heart that she is gone,\" he wrote, external. \"I'd hoped that my grieving was done for 2016.\n\nReynolds had been at her son's house in Beverly Hills - apparently discussing the arrangements for Carrie Fisher's funeral - when she was taken ill.\n\nShe was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre suffering from breathing difficulties and her death was confirmed a few hours later. It is thought she suffered a stroke.\n\nCarrie Fisher, renowned for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars series, had died aged 60 the day before, after spending three days in a Los Angeles hospital.\n\nShe never regained consciousness after suffering a massive heart attack on board a flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press news agency about his mother, Todd said: \"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken.''\n\nCelebrity news site TMZ reported, external that Reynolds cracked while discussing plans for Carrie's funeral with her son, telling him: \"I miss her so much; I want to be with Carrie.\"\n\nSome people talk about \"broken heart syndrome\", known more formally as stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. According to the British Heart Foundation, it is a \"temporary condition where your heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned. The left ventricle, one of the heart's chambers, changes shape.\"\n\nIt can be brought on by a shock. \"About three quarters of people diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have experienced significant emotional or physical stress prior to becoming unwell,\" the charity says.\n\nThis stress might be bereavement but it could be a shock of another kind. There are documented cases of people suffering the condition after being frightened by colleagues pulling a prank, or suffering the stress of speaking to a large group of people. It's speculated that the sudden release of hormones - in particular, adrenaline - causes the stunning of the heart muscle.\n\nThis is different from a heart attack, which is a stopping of the heart because the blood supply is constricted, perhaps by clogged arteries.\n\nRead more here\n\nHow does grief cause physical pain?\n\nThe actress has a sometimes strained relationship with her actress daughter, who wrote about it in her semi-autobiographical novel Postcards from the Edge.\n\nThe pair stopped speaking to each other for many years but became closer later in life.\n\nIn an interview last month with US radio network NPR, Fisher said her mother was \"an immensely powerful woman\" whom she admired \"very much\".\n\nAs people gathered to pay their respects to the actress at Hollywood's Walk of Fame, one couple, Jose and Daniela Barrera, appeared to speak for many after a year marked by celebrity deaths.\n\n\"It's just, you know, a sad time I guess,\" Jose told the Reuters news agency. \"With the closing of the year and so many deaths in the year, it's just sad.\"\n\n\"It was so sad,\" added Daniela. \"It was a shocker. I mean, what were the odds of this happening? It was incredible finding out, sad.\""
