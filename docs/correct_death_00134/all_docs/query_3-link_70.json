        "text": "Something Special to Get You Through the Summer\n\nMy love of Gene Kelly became common knowledge at school when I was 9 years old. We were asked to name our favourite film stars. Steve McQueen was a popular choice for the boys, as were Sean Connery and Roger Moore (Bond was huge in the ‘70s). And I seem to remember that even Elvis Presley got a mention (he’d just passed away and all of his films were shown on television).\n\nAs you’ve probably already anticipated, my choice was met with particular derision. Two things allowed me a modicum of redemption: football and humour. If you can play the national sport well and are also perceived as funny, then the respect and freedom from your contemporaries can be invigorating. Mostly.\n\nBarry Floyd was his name: a tall, stocky bully with a huge mane of blonde curls — an anti-Harpo, if you will. He made the next six months of my young life, a very long time to a nine year old, an absolute misery. Simply because my celebrity of choice was Gene Kelly, he would punch, kick, and spit on me with every opportunity that presented itself.\n\nDespite a visit to the school by my mother and admonishment from teachers, the bullying continued. My father’s advice, doled out early on in the period of persecution, seemed to me a last resort: “There’s only one way to deal with bullies, son. You hit them right back.” I had never hit anybody in my life, and the thought of any kind of violence abhorred me.\n\nOn the final day of school before the summer break, my tormentor cornered me in the library, advising me he was going to give me “something special that would get me through the summer.”\n\nBarry Floyd had hardly advanced when I caught him square on the jaw with my right fist and sent him sprawling into a portable trolley of cheap paperback Westerns. Fitting, I thought.\n\nHe stared up at me from the floor with an expression of pained incredulity, but said nothing more. I turned and walked out of the library followed by, I like to think, the spirit of an athletic dancer in t-shirt and chinos who leapt into the air and triumphantly clicked the heels of his loafers.\n\nBarry Floyd didn’t bother us again. He never laid another finger on me, nor did he ridicule Gene Kelly after that. Not to my face, at least.\n\nSpreading The Word of Gene\n\nIn my teenage years, my love of Gene Kelly is something I only shared with those closest to me, and I spread The Word of Gene with wonderful success.\n\nFor example, when I taped On the Town (1949) on Betamax in 1982, it had such a profound effect on my brother that years later, when he began his career as a carpenter, he would walk onto building sites singing, “I feel like I’m not out of bed yet.” Likewise, after I recorded Singin’ in the Rain (1952), I caught my other brother watching the titular number after, falsely, denouncing its merits.\n\nWith women, my Gene Kelly fandom is something I reveal early. I once used the DVD of Gene’s AFI Tribute to court a woman (with whom I’d eventually have a nine-year relationship). She told me she’d never liked Gene Kelly but admitted after watching the Tribute that she had found him funny, talented, and humble.\n\nAnother woman not only fell in love with Singin’ in the Rain after I showed it to her, but also bought it as a present for her little girl who similarly adored it and showed it to her friends.\n\nIn my adulthood, I’ve never tried to conceal my love of Gene Kelly. On the contrary, it is something I wear on my sleeve with pride: an adornment of muscular, joyous, and inventive brilliance. Equipped with an extensive knowledge of his work and opinions formulated after years of viewing and reading, I will, and have, gone to war in Gene’s defence.\n\nSo it is an irony not lost on me — again, a Gene Kelly fan and a student of Scottish history at the nation’s oldest University — that one of Kelly’s films, MGM’s Brigadoon, is regularly accused of perpetuating the myth and image of Scotland as a primitive country driven by a supernatural thirst for the following: whimsy, legend, whisky, dancing, quaintness, and tartan. Acres of tartan. Swathes of tartan. Huge, billowing, terrifying mounds of tartan.\n\nBloody Brigadoon\n\nDerision in Scotland and the wider UK for MGM’s Brigadoon was instantaneous. According to Colin McArthur, the most extensive coverage of the film was in the Glasgow Press (109–11):\n\n“It’s the queerest village in the Highlands.”\n\n“It’s got colour… It’s got Cinemascope… It’s got Kelly. BUT IT’S PHONEY BALONEY.”\n\n“A couple of Americans ‘huntin’ grouse among trees with the wrong kind of guns and without dogs and beaters…”\n\n“The director seems to have gone out of his way to make the film look as unauthentic as possible.”\n\n“Someone should’ve told [MGM] just a little about Scotland and how the place looks and how the natives talk.”\n\nEven the NY Times reviewed Brigadoon as “pretty weak synthetic Scotch.” And the fact that it followed Walt Disney’s equally ludicrous Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue (1953) — in which an Englishman portrayed one of Scotland’s most celebrated outlaws (the ignominy!) — compounded the resentment tenfold.\n\nSome reports suggest that Gene Kelly came to Scotland to scout locations for the film in 1953. Photographs of him outside Glasgow Central Train Station and receiving an award in Edinburgh exist (below). But this seems rather implausible given that the film musical was on the wane and MGM no longer had faith in the genre.\n\nFurthermore, if Kelly’s An American in Paris (1951) wasn’t shot on-location when the genre still had legs, then what would have compelled the studio to embark on a location shoot in a country notorious for intemperate weather and difficult terrain?"
