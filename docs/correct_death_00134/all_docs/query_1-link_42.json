        "text": "Butler, Pa. -\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump called for unity and resilience Sunday after an attempt on his life added fresh uncertainty to an already tumultuous presidential campaign and raised sharp questions about how a gunman was able to open fire from a rooftop near a Pennsylvania campaign rally.\n\nA full day after the shooting, the gunman's motive was still a mystery, and investigators said they believe he acted alone before being fatally shot by Secret Service agents. President Joe Biden ordered an independent security review of the attack, which killed a bystander and critically wounded two others. The FBI was investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism.\n\nDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\nThe attack shook the firmament of the American political system, causing a reassessment and a detente — at least temporarily — of the heated 2024 presidential campaign that has grown increasingly vicious.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said the upper part of his right ear was pierced by a bullet. His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well, and he arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday.\n\n“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.”\n\nIn a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.\"\n\nThe rallygoer who was killed was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who added that Comperatore “died a hero.”\n\n“His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. The two other bystanders who were wounded were listed in stable condition.\n\nBiden spoke briefly with Trump and was to address the nation Sunday evening. The president said the country would continue to debate and disagree, but stressed: \"We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are.”\n\nFBI investigates shooting as possible domestic terrorism\n\nThe FBI identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Penn., which is about 50 miles (80 kilometres) from the scene of the shooting. An FBI official said investigators had not yet determined a motive.\n\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips\n\nThe gunman had his father's AR-style rifle and was perched atop a nearby roof when some rallygoers pointed him out to local law enforcement, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe.\n\nA local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer then retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That's when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said.\n\nLaw enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, Pa., that they say was a residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the suspected shooter of former President Donald Trump, Sunday, July 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nQuestions abounded about how the gunman could have gotten so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said \"it is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him.\n\nBomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks' vehicle and at his home. The FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.\"\n\nHis motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn't on the FBI's radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators combed through his social media feeds and his home but found no immediate threatening writing or posts. His family was cooperating. Crooks’ relatives did not return multiple messages seeking comment from the AP.\n\nCrooks’ political leanings were also not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day Biden was sworn in as president.\n\nThe absence of a clear ideological motive added to the deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions about the shocking crime.\n\nBiden urged Americans to stay patient. “I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,\" he said.\n\nMost serious assassination attempt since 1981\n\nThe attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is helped off the stage at a campaign event in Butler, Pa., on Saturday, July 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally, along with people posing online as the dead shooter.\n\n“We’re also focused on the continuing efforts — which were already substantial, given that they’re national security special events — to conventions in Chicago, in Milwaukee,” he said\n\nBiden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention, which is proceeding as planned. The Secret Service said it was “confident” in the security plan for the RNC, and no additional changes were planned.\n\nBiden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden returned to Washington from his Delaware beach home where he met with leaders in the Situation Room about the attack. He said during an address Sunday afternoon that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.”\n\n“We cannot allow this to happen,” Biden said.\n\nAn AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking.\n\nFollow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp\n\nYet many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment.\n\nIt's not clear yet whether Biden will be forced to recalibrate a campaign that's largely focused on Trump as a threat to democracy. It is a situation the U.S. has not seen since Teddy Roosevelt was shot a month before the election in 1912 while campaigning to regain the White House as a third-party candidate.\n\nA rally disrupted by gunfire\n\nTrump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the gunfire began after 6:10 p.m.\n\nAs the first pop rang out, Trump said \"Oh\" and raised his hand to his right ear and looked at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. The people in the stands behind him also crouched as screams rang through the crowd.\n\nSomeone could be heard near the microphone saying, \"Get down, get down, get down, get down!\" as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop the former president to shield him with their bodies as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.\n\nAfterward, voices were heard saying, \"Shooter's down\" several times, before someone asked, \"Are we good to move?\" and \"Are we clear?\" Then someone ordered, \"Let's move.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is helped off the stage at a campaign event in Butler, Pa., on Saturday, July 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nTrump could be heard on the video saying at least twice, \"Let me get my shoes,\" with another voice heard saying, \"I've got you, sir.\"\n\nTrump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was streaked with blood. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word \"fight\" twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of \"USA. USA. USA.\"\n\nHis motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, former first lady Melania Trump said that when she saw her husband wounded, \"I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change,\" referring to their son. She said she was grateful to Secret Service agents and other law enforcement officers, and offered her \"sincerest sympathy\" to the families of the other victims.\n\nWitnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover\n\nWhen the firing began, \"everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew. Everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,\" said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump's right on stage.\n\nAs he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage.\n\nEventually, first responders were able to carry the wounded person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said.\n\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips\n\nReporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.\n\nWhen it was clear the situation had been contained and Trump would not return to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue.\n\nPolice soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get \"out now. This is a live crime scene.\"\n\nPolice snipers return fire after shots were fired while Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump was speaking at a campaign event in Butler, Pa., on Saturday, July 13, 2024.

Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump's. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nPresidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security, and Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Kelly, who represents the area where the shooting occurred, attended the rally with his wife and grandchildren and was just behind Trump when he was wounded. Kelly said he was \"in a state of bewilderment of how and what has happened to the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I just wish people — tone it down,\" he said. \"Quit trying to find, to blame somebody. The blame lies somewhere in the psyche of America.\"\n\n------\n\nColvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington. Tucker reported from Westport, Connecticut.
