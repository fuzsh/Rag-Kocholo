        "text": "Gene Kelly’s dance moves redefined musical films, thanks to his athletic style and captivating energy.\n\nEven the casual film fan will likely recognize his famous numbers from such movies as “Singin’ in the Rain” (1952) as he sang and danced under a downpour of rain, or when he danced with an animated Jerry the Mouse in the 1945 film “Anchors Aweigh.”\n\nThe Carpenter Center is now stepping deeper into the life of the famed dancer, choreographer, singer and film director with the help of his widow, Patricia Ward Kelly, who will appear in a one-woman performance on Nov. 22 called “Gene Kelly: The Legacy.”\n\n“It’s really a very intimate journey into the creative process of Gene Kelly,” Patricia Ward Kelly said during a phone interview. “I had the great privilege of recording him nearly every day for over 10 years, so it’s this really personal look at him through his own comments and the way he thought and how he created things and why.”\n\nThe 2 p.m. performance is part of the center’s ongoing Sunday Afternoon Concert Series.\n\n“Even the casual fan will get a greater appreciation of what he did,” said Michele Roberge, executive director of the Carpenter Center. “He was a huge force not only in dance but in film.”\n\nThe performance, which mixes elements of a lecture, documentary and music, consists of rarely seen film clips and personal audio recordings weaved with stories from his wife.\n\n“He used to sing to me at night,” Kelly said. “That was often how he would reveal the most intimate parts of his life. He would revert to songs and song lyrics, so you get these very rare recordings of him.”\n\nShe also shares personal items like costumes and clothing her husband wore.\n\n“I quite literally unpack some of his belongings on stage and take people into the stories of these personal objects,” she added.\n\nThroughout the show people learn that Gene Kelly spoke French, was a voracious reader, loved the New York Times crossword puzzle, and had the confidence to do it in ink. He also studied economics and was fluent in Yiddish.\n\n“The most common comment that I hear after the show is, ‘I never knew that about him.’ Or people say they loved him before and now they love him even more,” Kelly said.\n\nKelly, who created the piece in 2012 to mark what would have been the star’s 100th birthday for a Centennial Tribute by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, met the film icon in 1985 while they worked on a television documentary together.\n\nShe was 26 and he was 73.\n\nKelly said she had no idea who Gene Kelly was when she met him but the two hit it off.\n\n“He was a very romantic guy, a classic, old school romantic who loved Valentine’s Day. He would start to sprinkle Valentine’s around the house at midnight, and so I have some of those Valentine’s at the show,” she said.\n\nThey married in 1990 and were together until his death in 1996. During the time they knew each other, Kelly worked on his memoir and recorded his stories on tape and written notes.\n\nShe’s now finishing the book, which is due out sometime next year.\n\nFor now, she’s sharing the man she knew better than most in hopes that people leave with a deeper understanding of Gene Kelly beyond the famous dance moves.\n\n“He really wanted to be known more for being behind the camera than in front of it and for creating these things that you’re seeing,” Kelly said. “A lot of people don’t realize he directed and choreographed these pieces. When they come out of this, they really understand the real depth of his character and the real magnitude of his genius.”\n\nIf You Go:\n\nWhen: 2 p.m. Nov. 22.\n\nWhere: Carpenter Performing Arts Center, 6200 E. Atherton St., Long Beach.\n\nTickets: $38.\n\nInformation: 562-985-7000, www.carpenterarts.org"
