        "text": "HE’S GOT RHYTHM\n\nThe Life and Career of Gene Kelly\n\nBy Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson\n\nIllustrated. 517 pp. University Press of Kentucky. $39.95.\n\nOne of Gene Kelly’s co-stars, the swimmer Esther Williams, left for posterity a succinct version of his life story: He was “a jerk, but he could dance!” Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson’s “He’s Got Rhythm,” the first substantial biography of Kelly since his death in 1996, provides the details Williams left out, but essentially says the same thing. The book retells the accepted view of Kelly’s scandal-free life. He was a happily married man (that is, happily married until his divorce from his first wife, Betsy Blair, then happily married to his second, Jeanne Coyne, until her death, and then happily married to his third, Patricia Ward, until his own death). He was a devoted father to his three children (one with Blair, two with Coyne), a wonderful host to a world of friends at lively parties he gave in the house that was his home for 50 years, and, although a demanding taskmaster who could make Cyd Charisse cry, a heck of a swell guy who was tough only because of his incredible dedication to his profession.\n\nIs there no more? Was Gene Kelly, as he asks about Leslie Caron in “An American in Paris” (1951), the “still water that doesn’t run deep”? The Brideson sisters offer little analysis of what they refer to as his “complexity,” but they do raise significant issues. They admit “Gene pushed people to their limit.” They quote friends who testify to Kelly’s rages whenever he lost a game of any sort. (The composer André Previn, once a member of Kelly’s elite circle of Hollywood intellectuals, stopped attending his parties because of the host’s “desperate need to be the best.”) Betsy Blair Kelly mentions his “lack of deep friendships” (in the authors’ words), and Kelly himself is quoted as saying: “Show business is all I know. Take it away from me and you’ve taken everything.” The book never addresses in depth the inner life of the man who said that, nor does it explain what generated his towering rages (other than a volleyball).\n\nThe Brideson sisters — the authors of “Ziegfeld and His Follies” (Sara died earlier this year) — do cover Kelly’s professional story in full detail. Eugene Curran Kelly was born in 1912, the third of five children in a Pittsburgh family. When he left for New York in 1938 at age 26, he was a college graduate, an experienced dancer and a co-owner of successful dance schools. Within three years, he made theater history, as the original Harry the Hoofer in “The Time of Your Life” (1939), the star of the groundbreaking musical “Pal Joey” (1940) and the dance director for the hit show “Best Foot Forward” (1941). He proved himself as actor, musical performer and choreographer — the tripartite basis of his lifetime success. It was inevitable that Hollywood would seek him out."
