        "text": "Gene Kelly's first film success, ''For Me and My Gal,'' came when he was 30, past his prime as a dancer. By the time he was 40, Kelly had transformed the movie musical with classics like ''On the Town,'' ''An ''American in Paris,'' and ''Singin' in the Rain.'' In his 50's and 60's, Kelly's output and career dwindled.\n\nThe achievement of Kelly, a star of Hollywood's Golden Age whose athleticism, masculinity and working-class roots shaped his dancing, is depicted in a new PBS documentary ''Gene Kelly: Anatomy of a Dancer,'' on the ''American Masters'' series. It offers a candid glimpse into the life of a star who, onscreen, was inevitably charming and good-natured. Offscreen, he was an obsessive and volatile taskmaster who sought perfection at almost any cost.\n\n''Until now,'' said Robert Trachtenberg, the writer, producer and director of the documentary, ''Kelly's story has usually been glossed over. I thought it was time to get the whole picture.''\n\nThe documentary coincides with the 50th anniversary of ''Singin' in the Rain,'' arguably the greatest Hollywood musical, which Kelly directed with his longtime collaborator, Stanley Donen. The show is being presented on most PBS stations, including WNET in New York, on Sunday night. It will be shown in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe documentary offers a portrait of a determined, almost driven, actor, dancer, director and choreographer who, as Leslie Caron, his co-star in ''An American in Paris,'' said, brought modern dancing to films. In the process, Kelly relentlessly pushed his co-stars.\n\n''I guess the two hardest things I ever did in my life was childbirth and 'Singin' in the Rain,' '' said Debbie Reynolds, who added that her feet bled at times because she rehearsed so much. But Ms. Reynolds also said she owed her career to Kelly, who in his prime starred, directed, choreographed and even helped write some of his movies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
