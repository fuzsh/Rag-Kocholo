        "text": "Legendary actor, dancer, director and choreographer Gene Kelly brought astonishing grace and athleticism to the big screen – yet we know little about him. Patricia Ward Kelly – his wife and biographer – returns to The Wallis to present an intimate portrait of this dynamic and innovative artist who created some of the most memorable and iconic scenes in film history. This unique one-woman performance, which enjoyed two sold-out performances in our 2014/2015 season, combines rare and familiar film clips, previously unreleased recordings, personal memorabilia, and insights culled from Kelly’s hours of interviews and conversations with her husband.\n\n“Endearingly entertaining” - The Hollywood Reporter\n\nVenue: BRAM GOLDSMITH THEATER"
