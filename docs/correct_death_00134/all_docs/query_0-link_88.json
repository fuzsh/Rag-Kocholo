        "text": "Gene Kelly- How did his performance style change film musicals and tap dance?\n\nGene Kelly was born in 1912 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is famously known for his tap dancing and most people would recognise him for his performance in ‘Singing in the Rain’ (released 19th September 1952). However, he is also recognised for his singing and acting as he was featured and stared in many films throughout his career. Kelly is often compared to Fred Astaire (who is another famous tap dancer) as these two dancers have very different dance styles. Kelly died 2nd February 1996 (aged 84) in his home in Beverly Hills, California. Although, even after his death, Kelly’s legacy is still going strong and he is well remembered within the world and is especially appreciated for his work by people with an interest in dance for creating this style of dance where you can have fun with the movements and are free to explore new ideas and new techniques.\n\nAs a child Gene Kelly was not enthusiastic about dance from the start and preferred to play sports as a hobby such as Hockey, Football and took part in some Gymnastics. It is said that it was Kelly’s sports training when he was younger that gave him his unique style and what helped him differ to Fred Astaire so much. Astaire is someone who Kelly is compared a lot to because of the contrast on their styles and take on tap dance and dance in general, possibly because of the different upbringings that they had. Astaire was trained in dancing with his sister (presumably in ballroom and tap) and they both eventually made it onto Broadway. They started dancing from the get go whereas Kelly was more hesitant ([1] Biography.com, 2016). It was actually his mother who first put his brother and himself into various dance classes which she believed would help develop poise in each of her boys ([2] genekellyfans.com 2016). He started these classes at the age of seven, training in classical ballet ([3] blogs.wsj.com, 2016), but was reluctant to carry on as classmates would tease him. However, he later found out that the girls liked boys who could dance so decided to pursue with the lessons. It was during the Great Depression that Kelly attended the University of Pittsburgh having to transfer from Pennsylvania State College due to his family losing their money and having to cut out the costs of him living away from home. It was also at this time when Kelly’s mother started to work as the local dance studio’s receptionist and which later on lead the family to having their own dance studio ([4] notablebiographies.com, 2016). After working at the dance studio with his family teaching dance classes, he decided to move to New York to see if he could make it like many other artists. It was in New York where he really started his career and making a name for himself, leading him to earn the lead role in ‘Pal Joey’ ([5] http://www.pbs.org, 2016).\n\nKelly first started his career performing on Broadway. In 1938 he was in Cole Porter’s ‘Leave It to Me’ and then had a small role in ‘One For the Money’. It was a year later, 1939, when he gained his first director role and was made dance director for Billy Rose’s ‘Diamond Horseshoe club’. In 1940, Kelly bagged his first lead role in ‘Pal Joey’ running for two years before he was spotted by a recruiter from MGM Studio’s and performing in his first film ‘For Me and My Gal’. After this debut he amazed audiences over and over again with his style and the presence that he had on the screen by being a fun and cheeky character ([6] encyclopedia.com, 2016). He was in multiple films such as ‘On The Town’ (1941), Anchors Aweigh (1945), An American in Paris (1951) and (as I mentioned earlier) Singing In the Rain (1952) which is one of his most recognisable pieces ([7] Biography.com 2016). Most people know Kelly from ‘Singing In the Rain’ because this was such an iconic piece that even after the many years between when this film was released and now, people are still creating variations of the dance sequence. It is amazing how his legacy is being passed down through generations because of the big impact that he had on the industry by creating this new and exciting style and the fact that he was such an amazing performer by being able to sing, act and dance and to have this charisma that pulled audiences in. Another piece of Kelly’s that was of particular interest when carrying out my research is from ‘An American in Paris’. This is because one website (Biography.com) had talked about a dance at the end of the film which Kelly had choreographed but it was in the style of Ballet and not in Tap which is what you would usually expect from him. Kelly had a long and memorable career and it is nice to know his work will live on.\n\nGene Kelly first started his career on the stage. The stage is where most artists start out and this is a good place to start as the atmosphere is a lot different to film. With stage you are able to almost work with the audience in a way that you can see people’s reactions and you can gain energy from the audience because if they are having a good time then it makes you feel good too as the performer. However, film is different as you can’t see the reaction of the audience so there isn’t that atmosphere that you get within a theatre. Also, in film, you are able to have re-takes if something goes wrong whereas on stage you only get one chance to do something right and with people watching you, this can very hard to do. Moving from stage to film takes a lot for a choreographer to get used to because of the visual aspects of the dances and the new possibilities that you have when working with a camera and on a set. When choreographing for film you are able to use different techniques for showing the skills and the technique of the dance itself and dancers with camera angles and you have a much bigger space to work in. This gave Kelly more freedom in his choreographing because he was able to think more outside of the box because of what he now had available. This thinking outside of the box lead him to creating interesting dance sequences such as performing a tap routine whilst on roller skates which he wouldn’t have been able to on the stage because of the amount of space you have on a stage is a big limitation. Moving from theatre to film was one of the reasons that he became so famous because a film is recorded so people were able to keep watching a re-watching his work and these films are pass down through generations and that is why we still are watching him today. Kelly used the physical energy that you would need on stage in his films which is why he seems so excitable and energetic on the screen because he always put in 110%.\n\nI wanted to ask other people’s opinions of Gene Kelly because this could give a good insight into how he affected people with his talent and through the films he performed in and directed. I asked six people ranging in ages, roughly from 19 to 50 years of age. I wanted different ages to see if this affected the opinion they had and also, I mainly asked people who are in performing arts but they range in their specific subjects (Acting, Dace and Musical Theatre). After looking at all of the answer given it seems to be that ‘Singing In the Rain’ is most people’s favourite piece of Kelly’s. I personally also love this film and many other people do too because this is such an iconic film and the dance sequence in the rain was particularly memorable. Many of the people I asked also said that they liked that his style was free and easy but also quite comedic in some aspects. This is also what made his such a good entertainer because he was able to make people laugh whilst also creating a spectacular dance routine. When asked ‘How did you come across Gene Kelly and his work?’ most people said that they were introduced by their mothers or remember hearing them talk about it and then later became more interested in Kelly’s work. This shows that Kelly was quite popular with women and this is possibly because of this new rugged and casual persona that he had with everything rather than what Astaire used before him which was much more gentlemanly. Kelly was also quite a handsome man which may have contributed to his female fan base. Looking at the results of the questions is shows that he was a very loveable character on the screen and people fell in love with his energy that he brought to the screen. He changed the face of film musicals because now this person the audience were watching, was someone that they could relate to. Kelly supposedly quoted that he ‘didn’t want to move or act like a rich man. I wanted to dance in a pair of jeans. I wanted to dance like the man in the streets.’ ([8] azquotes.com, 2016).\n\nKelly’s style is very fluid but it is also very grounded meaning that he really used the floor as something to work with and made everything bigger and better whilst at the same time keeping his upper body loose. It was this new style that Kelly brought to tap dance and dance in general, that you really notice how he influenced the next generation of dance and musicals and continued to influence many generations after that. To really see the changes that Kelly unleashed on the world, it would be helpful to compare him with another iconic film star of this period such as Fred Astaire to see the comparisons that could be made between the two. Fred Astaire was more of a gentlemanly figure and his approach is very formal and precise. He keeps completely upright and strong when dancing and usually he does a lot of partner work with Ginger Rogers in dances such as ‘Swing Time’. However, Kelly’s approach is, whilst still strong in the movements, quite loose and much more like he is just having fun with the movements instead of it being a very strict discipline. Kelly seems to work on his own but also in groups or duets with others such as ‘Ballin’ the Jack’ or when he performed a trash can dance in ‘It’s Always Fair Weather’. Another way Astaire differed from Kelly he always wore a three-piece suit with a bow tie and smart shoes. This represented money and elegance whereas Gene Kelly was a lot more casual by wearing jumpers and less formal attire. Another way that these two dancers differ is in the way that they dance. People throughout the years have also said that Kelly’s style is influenced by Ballet and has some Ballet technique within his style. With film and musicals, Kelly brought out the fun side and liked to explore what you could do with it such as dancing with a cartoon mouse or creating two of himself on screen which had never really been done before.\n\nIn conclusion, Gene Kelly had such as big impact on the world of dance and musicals because of his style and his ability to capture the hearts of audiences. He did this by creating something new and showing people what they really could do with a little inspiration such as playing with new technology (of that time) and pushing the boundaries of dance. ‘Singing In the Rain’ is his main claim to fame. Becoming this cheeky and lovable character, people could relate to him and he wanted the audience to think of him as another regular man. He is supposedly quoted saying “All of my dancing came out of the idea of the common man,” ([9] Biography.com 2016). Without Gene Kelly, tap dance wouldn’t have become what it is today. He showed the world that you can create something incredible out of nothing and you can see this in some of his work such as the metal bin lid dance sequence in ‘It’s Always Fair Weather’.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
