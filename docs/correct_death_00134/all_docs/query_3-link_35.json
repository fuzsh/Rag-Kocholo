        "text": "“He basically gave me my marching orders,” recalls Patricia Kelly of her late husband, Hollywood golden age legend Gene Kelly. “It’s become my life, in a sense. But it isn’t a burden. It’s really what I love to do.”\n\nPatricia, who became Gene’s third wife in 1990, has become her husband’s advocate in the afterlife.\n\nIn an entertainment world full of gossip, exaggeration and outright lies the notorious perfectionist was determined to craft and protect his legacy from beyond the grave.\n\nAnd the woman who recorded his voice almost every day during their decade together before his death is now fiercely, proudly embracing her role – and claiming it as her own.\n\n“Gene had been so explicit about how he wished to be remembered,” Patricia says. “He said ‘I wish to be remembered for changing the look of dance on film, and for my work behind the camera as director and choreographer’, and he said ‘if anybody’s going to do that it would be you’.\n\n“It was very specific.”\n\nThe result is a stage show – Gene Kelly The Legacy, which grew from a Hollywood tribute evening to a production that tours the world, and has come to Australia this month.\n\nPatricia first met her husband-to-be in 1985, when she was 26 and he was 73 and she had never heard of him or seen any of his movies.\n\nShe was a scholar and journalist working on a documentary about the Smithsonian Museum when Gene came in as the host.\n\nAfter six months working together he invited her to his Beverley Hills home and asked her to help write his memoir. Five years later, in 1990, they married (Gene’s previous wife Jeanne Coyne had died in 1973). He died in February 1996 aged 83.\n\nHe called himself her \"Pygmalion\".\n\n“There was this tremendous attention to detail about everything, about how you carry yourself, how you stand, how you sit, how you speak, how you address someone, how you dress, how you walk across the floor, how you enter a room.\n\n“People will comment about that about the way I’m standing or the way I’m walking and I know it’s a reflection of Gene… having me go up and down the stairs. He’s always present.”\n\nIt might sound controlling. But Patricia will admit to no flaws in the man – though “I know he was a man and I know all the intricacies of that”.\n\n“Gene gets described as ‘difficult’, as a taskmaster and a perfectionist – which drove him crazy because he said ‘I don’t understand a professional who is not [one]’. Some people would call that a negative trait. But if you look at it, you look at why we are watching these movies many decades later, precision is involved in this.”\n\nShe reveals, for example, his fury with the creators of Olivia Newton John dance movie Xanadu, whom he thought “didn’t know what they were doing” and were wasting time and money. When test screenings revealed audiences yearning for a missing dance number with Gene and Olivia he insisted on creating it himself, on a closed set with the director and producer absent.\n\nAs their relationship “evolved”, Gene revealed more and more, Patricia says.\n\nFor example, the “party line” was that he joined the navy in World War II “to kill Hitler and Tojo”. But he admitted to his wife it was because “I didn’t want to miss out on the big parade”.\n\nPatricia worked hard to fact check her husband – spending days in movie libraries scanning production notes to check, for example, that the Singing in the Rain dance routine did take a day and a half to film, or to verify with a sound engineer that Gene really did dub his own taps.\n\n“Most performers fabricate a lot,” she says. “When someone makes such a significant creative contribution in the 20th century… that person deserves not to have that taken away by other people who did not do the work, or minimalised or trivialised or just simply lost.”\n\nPatricia says her husband’s work will exist forever, but people have forgotten his creative contribution: how he worked to make the camera move with the dance, to bring back the third dimension lost when you put a routine on film.\n\nThey have forgotten he directed Hello Dolly and Singing in the Rain and On the Town.\n\n“He was this immense mind, this formidable brain,” she says. He would hold forth on the link between mathematics and classical ballet.\n\nPatricia created the show as a substitute for the standard Academy tribute evening on what would have been Gene’s 100th birthday. She went into it a “cipher” in the shadows of her husband and it was her “coming out party”, she says.\n\nAnd it has enabled her to “deal with the absence of him”.\n\n“How do you go forward and make it something that is mine and not simply part of his life? I’ve been able to do that.”"
