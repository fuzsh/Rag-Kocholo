        "text": "According to the Wall Street Journal, Gaynor has listed the 4,100-square-foot abode for $5,495,000, and we think it's well worth the price. Stars like Gene Kelly, Betty Grable and Richard Burton have all been guests.\n\nThe listing by Sotheby's Reality says the Spanish-styled villa has five bedrooms and six baths. Gaynor supposedly bought the home in 1960 with her husband, talent agent Jack Bean. Since his death in 2006 however, the \"South Pacific\" star says the house is too big for her. \"There are so many blessed memories here, but there comes a time when you have to move on,\" she told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nScroll through the photos below to see the property, and head over to Sotheby's Realty and the Wall Street Journal for more information.\n\nDo you have a home story idea or tip?
