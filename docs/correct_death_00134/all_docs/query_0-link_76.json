        "text": "The two famous dancers (Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly) were together dancing and singing in 'The Babbitt and the Bromide' dance number in the film \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (1946). They perform to a song about two acquaintances who meet once every decade or so and have the same shallow conversation.\n\nAstaire, original name Frederick Austerlitz, was born in May 1899 in Omaha, NE. He died in June 1987 in Los Angeles, CA. As a dancer of stage and motion pictures, he is best known for a number of very successful musical comedy films in which he starred with Ginger Rogers.\n\nEugene Curran Kelly, aka Gene Kelly, was born in Pittsburgh, PA in August 1912. He died in February 1996 in Beverly Hills, CA. He had a career reputation as an actor and a dancer. For 1952's \"Singin' in the Rain\", one of the all-time great movie musicals, it is perhaps the film most associated with Kelly. He is now best remembered for his big contributions to the movie musical through choreography, dance performance, and photography.\n\nIn the 1946 MGM release of the film which was based on Ziegfeld's shows entitled 'Ziegfeld Follies' besides the work of Astaire and Kelly, stars of the film include: Judy Garland, Lena Horne, William Powell, Fanny Brice, Red Skelton, Esther Williams, Cyd Charisse, Lucille Ball, Kathryn Grayson, and others performing songs and sketches similar to those from the original Follies, which were a series of elaborate theatrical revue productions done on Broadway in New York City, NY."
