People who are democrats have an ability to tolerate the complexity and the undertow of democracy because the alternative is so bad and that bad alternative is always in play.\" Ken Burns on the importance of historical fact, and telling narratives that have been erased, including his latest film about the American Buffalo, which is really a story of genocide through habitat destruction. #education #documentary #filmmaking #socialstudies #history #StorytellingWithPurpose https://lnkd.in/gCN5YYES\n\nArea 51, a name synonymous with intrigue, mystery, and countless conspiracy theories.

After all, for more than 10,000 years - 600 generations - bison and Native American tribes lived harmoniously - the Buffalo serving as a source of food and essential survival materials, with every ounce of an animal being incorporated into some aspect of the culture of a tribe. Indigenous people revered the Buffalo because life as they knew it depended on its survival and sacrifice. In the new Ken Burns documentary “American Buffalo,” available on PBS, the viewer comes to understand the symbiotic relationship between the bison and Native American tribes, and how the timeline of near extinction for the buffalo paralleled a similar experience for the Native Americans. In a recent interview Ken Burns shared, “What was most disturbing and heartbreaking was not just the slaughter of the animal, which in and of itself is beyond the pale. But the idea that behind it … sometimes verbalized but never written into real official policy, was the realization that ‘if we kill the buffalo, we kill the Indian’.” I encourage you to watch “American Buffalo” to discover the lessons that this dark and tragic chapter of our history still has to teach us, and learn how there is still room for hope. #PBS | #AmericanBuffalo | #buffalo | #nativeamericans | #kenburns | #history\n\nGood things are worth defending! Do you agree? Our current cultural landscape is full of smut and degeneracy--things that cause, as someone said today, the \"animalization\" of us. Our media, music, and entertainment reduce us to animals, diminishing us to base things rather than inspiring us to be virtuous, whole, and truly happy. God has so much better for us. We just have to participate in what He is doing and give generously of ourselves however we can.
