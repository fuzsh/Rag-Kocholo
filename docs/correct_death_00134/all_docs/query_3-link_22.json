His experiments with dance and with ways of filming it include combining dance and animation (Anchors Aweigh and Invitation to the Dance), and special effects (The \"Alter Ego\" number in Cover Girl and the split-screen dance of It's Always Fair Weather). His first attempts at film choreography relied on the established formulas of the film musical, but subsequently, particularly in the three films he co-directed with Stanley Donen, he developed a flexible system of choreography for the camera that took into account camera setups and movement, and editing.\n\nKelly consciously integrated dance and filmic elements with his on-screen characterizations, thereby developing a persona (and also a recognizable popular culture figure) that is manifested in the films' plots, songs, and especially dances. Like his dance style, this complex persona draws on a variety of sources. The song-and-dance man of For Me and My Gal is a vaudeville hoofer, and his principal dances are tap routines. The introspective Pierrot of Invitation to the Dance, and the Pierrot-sailor of the \"A Day in New York\" sequence from On the Town, are derived from commedia dell'arte, and their dances are more balletic. The swashbuckler of the dream dances in Anchors Aweigh and The Pirate is an athletic performer, combining the tours de force of ballet with acrobatic stunts.\n\nWithout disparaging his towering achievements as triple threat, it is clear that Kelly's happy-go-lucky Yankee Doodle dancin' boy image seems less resonant in today's pop culture vacuum. Despite superb supporting turns in What a Way to Go! and Forty Carats, it is obvious that Kelly's grinning goodwill ambassador fell out of step with the sixties antiestablishment antiheroes. But Kelly's image does not need a rehabilitation so much as a reshifting \"perception-wise,\" to paraphrase a tune from It's Always Fair Weather. Mesmerized by Gene's athleticized self-approval and tireless cherchez la femme-ing, critics and audiences have overlooked the contradictions in his cocky all-American huckster persona. Debuting as a draft dodger in For Me and My Gal, Kelly used his charisma's sinister edge to limn a mother-fixated killer in Christmas Holiday, camouflaged his rendition of a gigolo in An American in Paris, deftly enacted a womanizing summer schlocker in Marjorie Morningstar, and capped off his musical comedy career as a small-time fight promoter toying with a fix in It's Always Fair Weather.\n\nEven in lighter fare (On the Town, Summer Stock), he often portrayed fellas bent on impressing people to get what they wanted. Reconsidering the Kelly persona from a distance of several decades, one can enjoy his eventual triumphs over shortcomings (including his own robust ego) in Singin' in the Rain, etc. It is a tribute to his unflappable charisma that unsavory character flaws all registered as temporary slippage, indiscretions cured by true love and transformed by joyfully aggressive dance. In his most seductive choreography (The Pirate, Cover Girl), he seemed to be dancing his demons away, and it is time to credit him for a more complex image than previously assumed.\n\nIf his solo work reveals a pretentiousness that never darkened Astaire's sunny horizons, no male dancer was ever as sexually potent in tandem on-screen; he can make a soft shoe with Debbie Reynolds an adventure in eros. Betrayed by overreaching with the ill-fated Invitation to the Dance, Kelly minimized his true gifts as entertainer and misjudged his audience's appetite for his brand of high culture. It was barbarous of MGM not to lend him for Guys and Dolls and Pal Joey and to saddle him with the airless Brigadoon and heavy-handed Les Girls. If the last four decades were dotted by the dashing of tantalizing projects and by Kelly's inability to stamp his post-Donen directorial assignments with his own personality, Kelly could take comfort in his singular contribution to the all-but-extinct musical form; time will reveal an icon more complex than the quixotic puddle jumper of Singin' in the Rain. In film after film, this superb actor choked back darker impulses to earn his goodness; he is the all-American operator who plays all the angles, but ultimately seeks the light in a song-and-dance spotlight.\n\n—Jerome Delameter, updated by Robert Pardi\n\nGene Kelly\n\nAlthough Gene Kelly (1912-1996) established his reputation as an actor and dancer, his contribution to the Hollywood musical also embraces choreography and direction.\n\nGene Kelly's experiments with dance and with ways of filming it include combining dance and animation (Anchors Aweigh and Invitation to the Dance), and special effects (The \"Alter Ego\" number in Cover Girl and the split-screen dance of It's Always Fair Weather). His first attempts at film choreography relied on the established formulas of the film musical, but subsequently, particularly in the three films he co-directed with Stanley Donen, he developed a flexible system of choreography for the camera that took into account camera setups and movement, and editing.\n\nKelly was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1912, and was the middle son of five children. His father was Canadian-born and loved sports, especially hockey. Every winter Kelly, Sr., would flood the family backyard and make an ice rink for hockey. As quoted in the New Yorker, Kelly remembered how the sport would later influence his dancing: \"I played ice hockey as a boy and some of my steps come right out of the game—wide open and close to the ground.\" At 15 Kelly was playing with a semi-professional ice hockey team. Yet, he was also influenced by his mother's love of the theater. In fact, it was she who sent him to dancing lessons.\n\nIn 1929 Kelly left for Pennsylvania State college, but because of the Great Depression, his family lost their money, and Kelly had to move back home and attend the University of Pittsburgh in order to save the cost of room and board. Eventually, all five children would graduate from that school. While at Pitt, Kelly worked at a variety of odd jobs to pay his tuition: ditchdigger, soda jerk, gas pumper. Kelly's mother began to work as a receptionist at a local dance school, and she came up with the idea of the family running its own dance studio. They did and the studio was a big success.\n\nAfter graduation from the University of Pittsburgh, Kelly attended law school. After only a month, he decided that law was not the career for him. He quit and continued to teach dance for another six years. In 1937 he left for New York, and was confident enough of his talent to believe that he would find work. He was right. He landed a job his first week in New York. Kelly's big break came in 1940 when he was cast as the lead in the Rodgers and Hart musical Pal Joey. He played the part of an Irish nightclub singer who was a good-for-nothing loner.\n\nThe show was a hit and Kelly attracted the attention of producer-songwriter Arthur Freed, who convinced his boss, Hollywood studio executive Louis B. Mayer, to see the show. Mayer liked what he saw and told Kelly that he would like to have him under contract for the MGM studio. But it was Mayer's nephew, David O. Selznick, who signed Kelly to a contract in 1942. After six months, Kelly's contract was sold to MGM and he worked for MGM for the next 16 years.\n\nHis first Hollywood film was For Me and My Gal (1942), in which he starred opposite Judy Garland. Garland was only 20, but she had begun working in films at the age of 16. It was she who insisted that Kelly have the role, and she tutored him in how to act for the wide screen. \"I knew nothing about playing to the camera,\" Kelly told Architectural Digest. \"It was Judy who pulled me through.\" He learned quickly, however. After a couple of years doing stock musicals, Kelly made a breakthrough with Cover Girl (1944). Of his work in Cover Girl, Kelly told Interview: \"[That's] when I began to see that you could make dances for cinema that weren't just photographed stage dancing. That was my big insight into Hollywood, and Hollywood's big insight into me.\"\n\nGene Kelly established his reputation as an actor and dancer, but his contribution to the Hollywood musical includes choreography and direction. His experiments with dance and with film technique include combining the two, as demonstrated in such films as Anchors Aweigh (1945) and Invitation to the Dance (1956). He also made use of special effects, as in the \"Alter-Ego\" number in Cover Girl (1944), where he danced with his reflection, or in the split-screen dance of It's Always Fair Weather (1957). His first attempts at film choreography relied on the established formulas of the film musical, but subsequently he developed a flexible system of choreography for the camera that took into account camera setups, movement, and editing.\n\nKelly consciously integrated dance into film in order to help the audience gain insight into the types of characters he played. For example, the song-and-dance man of For Me and My Gal is a common, unpretentious character, and his principal dances are tap routines—the kind of dance accessible to the general public of the era. The sailor of the \"A Day in New York\" sequence from On the Town is introspective and his dance is therefore more lyrical and balletic. The swashbuckler of the dream dances in Anchors Aweigh (1945) and The Pirate (1948) is an athletic performer, combining the forceful turns of ballet with acrobatic stunts.\n\nKelly often played a guy who feels that the best way to get what he wants is to impress people. He almost always realizes, however, that his brashness offends people, and that he will more easily succeed by being himself. The worldly wise sailor trying to impress Vera-Ellen in On the Town (1949) is really just a boy from Meadowville, Indiana. In The Pirate the actor Serafin pretends he is a treacherous pirate in order to win Judy Garland's heart, but it is the lowly actor that she really wants. In An American in Paris (1951) Kelly plays an aggressive painter, and in It's Always Fair Weather (1955) he portrays a cool and sophisticated New Yorker. Yet, underneath each of these characters' masks are the charming and clever \"true\" selves, which are expressed wittily through song and dance.\n\nThough Kelly's characters are naturally high-spirited, they also have a somewhat sad aspect and tend to brood about their loneliness at key moments in the films. Kelly expresses the loneliness in dances that are almost meditations on the characters' feelings. After Gaby has lost Miss Turnstiles for the second time in On the Town, he dreams the ballet \"A Day in New York.\" The isolation of his character is emphasized by the anonymity of the other dancers as well as the disappearance of Vera-Ellen. The ballet in An American in Paris serves a similar thematic purpose. The \"Alter-Ego\" dance in Cover Girl expresses Kelly's anxiety over losing his girlfriend, and the squeaky-board dance number in Summer Stock (1950) is a rumination on his new feeling for Judy Garland's character.\n\nKelly's performances left the impression that anyone— sailors, soldiers, ball players—could sing and dance. As he matured, his characters took on greater dimension, responding to the anxiety of city living, falling in love, and being lonely by distilling such experiences into dance.\n\nAnd while most of his audiences were not really aware of Kelly's sophisticated techniques—thus the magic— virtually all found him uniquely appealing as a leading man. Nowhere was he more engaging than in 1952's Singin' in the Rain. One of the all-time great movie musicals, and perhaps the film most associated with Kelly, this comedy illustrates the late-1920s transition from silent pictures to \"talkies.\" Singin' in the Rain showcased the considerable acting, singing, and dancing gifts of Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, but it is Kelly who dances away with the movie. His rendition of the title song has become an icon of American entertainment; Kelly makes a driving rain his partner, communicating the joy in movement at the heart of all his performances.\n\nGene Kelly will always be remembered for his incredible contribution—through dance performance, choreography, and photography—to the genre of the movie musical. While he had some success in nonmusical films— Christmas Holiday, Marjorie Morningstar, Inherit the Wind—his legacy lies in dance. Kelly died on February 2, 1996.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGriffith, Richard, The Cinema of Gene Kelly, New York, 1962.\n\nSpringer, John, All Talking, All Singing, All Dancing, New York, 1966.\n\nKobal, John, Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance, New York, 1970.\n\nBurrows, Michael, Gene Kelly, Cornwall, England, 1971.\n\nThomas, Lawrence B., The MGM Years, New Rochelle, New York, 1972.\n\nKnox, Donald, The Magic Factory, New York, 1973.\n\nHirschhorn, Clive, Gene Kelly: A Biography, London, 1974; rev. ed., 1984.\n\nThomas, Tony, The Films of Gene Kelly, Song and Dance Man, Secaucus, New Jersey, 1974; rev. ed., 1991.\n\nDelameter, Jerome, Dance in the Hollywood Musical, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1981.\n\nThomas, Tony, That's Dancing, New York, 1985.\n\nAltman, Rick, The American Film Musical, Bloomington, Indiana, 1989.\n\nCinema, December 1966.\n\nAmerican Film (Washington, D.C.), February 1979.\n\nFilm Comment (New York), November/December 1984.\n\nAmerican Film (Washington, D.C.), March 1985.\n\nInterview, May 1994.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, 13 May 1994. □\n\nGene Kelly\n\nBorn: August 23, 1912\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nDied: February 2, 1996\n\nBeverly Hills, California\n\nAmerican dancer, actor, and choreographer\n\nAlthough Gene Kelly established his reputation as an actor and a dancer, his contribution to the Hollywood, California, musical also includes choreography (creating dances) and movie direction.\n\nAthletic childhood\n\nEugene Curran Kelly was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 23, 1912, the middle son of five children. His father was Canadian-born and loved sports, especially hockey. Every winter Kelly Sr. would flood the family backyard and make an ice rink for hockey.\n\nKelly Jr. later credited hockey for some of his dance steps, which he described as \"wide open and close to the ground.\" At fifteen Kelly played with a semiprofessional ice hockey team. He also played football, baseball, and participated in gymnastics.\n\nTurns to dancing\n\nKelly's other major influence was his mother, who loved the theater. She was the one who sent him to dancing lessons. At first Kelly did not want to continue with his dance lessons because the other students made fun of him. But then he discovered that the girls liked a boy who could dance, so he decided to stick with the lessons.\n\nIn 1929 Kelly left for Pennsylvania State College, but because of the Great Depression, his family lost their money. The Great Depression (1929–39) was a time of worldwide economic trouble that led to global unemployment and poverty. Kelly had to move back home and attend the University of Pittsburgh in order to save the cost of room and board. While at the university, Kelly worked at a variety of odd jobs to pay his tuition: he dug ditches, worked at a soda fountain, and pumped gas. Kelly's mother began to work as a receptionist at a local dance school. She came up with the idea of the family running its own dance studio. They did and the studio was a big success.\n\nAfter Kelly graduated from the University of Pittsburgh he taught dance for another six years. In 1937 he left for New York City. He believed that he was talented enough to find work and he was right. He got a job in theater his first week in New York. Kelly's big break came in 1940, when he was cast as the lead in the Rodgers and Hart musical Pal Joey.\n\nGoes to Hollywood\n\nProducers from Hollywood saw the show in New York and offered Kelly a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM). He worked for MGM for the next sixteen years. His first Hollywood film was For Me and My Gal (1942), in which he starred opposite Judy Garland (1922–1969). Garland was only twenty, but already a major star. She had seen Kelly's work and insisted that Kelly have the role. She tutored (taught) him how to act for the movies.\n\nKelly made a breakthrough with Cover Girl (1944). At one point in the film, his character dances with a mirror image of himself. It caught all the critics' attention. Kelly told Interview magazine, \"[That is] when I began to see that you could make dances for cinema that weren't just photographed stage dancing. That was my big insight into Hollywood, and Hollywood's big insight into me.\"\n\nExperiments with film\n\nKelly's experiments with dance and with film technique included combining the two, as demonstrated in such films as Anchors Aweigh (1945), where he danced with a cartoon mouse, An American in Paris (1951), and Invitation to the Dance (1956). His first attempts at film choreography relied on the established formulas of the film musical. Later he developed a system of choreography made for the camera that took into account camera setups, movement, and editing. Many people believe that he was the major influence in creating a new form of American dance, one that was different from the more formal and ballet styles of European dance. Kelly danced in a more energetic, athletic way.\n\nKelly often played a guy who felt that the best way to get what he wanted was to impress people. However, he learns that his brashness (self-confidence without politeness) offends people. In the end he succeeds by being himself. Kelly's characters had much of the \"average guy\" in them and this quality appealed to audiences. His characters seemed so natural that people who saw his films did not always realize how very sophisticated (complex) his dancing and choreography were.\n\nSingin' in the Rain\n\nNowhere was Kelly more engaging than in 1952's Singin' in the Rain. One of the all-time great movie musicals, and perhaps the film most associated with Kelly, this comedy is about late-1920s Hollywood and the change from silent pictures to \"talkies\" (movies with sound). Singin' in the Rain showcased the considerable acting, singing, and dancing gifts of Debbie Reynolds (1932–) and Donald O'Connor (1925–), but it was Kelly who danced away with the movie. His dance to the title song has become an icon (something that is regarded as the ideal) of American entertainment. Kelly made a drenching rainstorm and umbrella his partners, and communicated the joy in movement at the heart of all of his performances.\n\nGene Kelly died on February 2, 1996, in Beverly Hills, California. He will always be remembered for his incredible contribution to the movie musical through dance performance, choreography, and photography.\n\nFor More Information\n\nHirschhorn, Clive.
