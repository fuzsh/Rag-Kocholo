CINCINNATI, OH (FOX19) - The Cincinnati Reds and 700 WLW announced today the renewal of the radio rights agreement to broadcast all regular and postseason games through 2017.

As part of the agreement, 700 WLW's game coverage will serve as the flagship for the Reds Radio Network, one of the largest in sports with 93 affiliates in nine states.

"The Reds and WLW have been linked together for almost 90 years and our fans are very passionate about both," said Bob Castellini, Reds President and CEO. "We're excited about continuing one of the best broadcast partnerships in all of sports."

"We take great pride in delivering Cincinnati Reds programming to Reds Country on 700 WLW," said Chuck Fredrick, Market President, Clear Channel Media and Entertainment Cincinnati. "We are thrilled to extend our highly successful relationship with the Reds and continue providing great coverage for Reds fans."

WLW first went on the air in 1922 under the direction of future Reds owner Powel Crosley, Jr. and aired the first broadcast of a Reds game in 1924. Since 1969, WLW has served as the Reds' flagship station.

"There's been no greater marriage than Reds radio and WLW radio," said Hall of Fame Broadcaster Marty Brennaman. "And it's great for our fans to know that this relationship will continue."

The 2013 season will mark Brennaman's 40th year of broadcasting the Reds on WLW and he is one of three Reds radio broadcasters to receive the Hall of Fame's Ford C. Fricke Award, joined by Red Barber and Russ Hodges.
