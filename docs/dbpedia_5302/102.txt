In Cincinnati, Steve Watkins reports the Reds will have a “new home for the Opening Day over-the-air TV broadcast” as WLWT-TV will simulcast the game Thursday against the Nationals along with the Reds TV home, Bally Sports Ohio. Reds Opening Day has been broadcast by WKRC-TV for more than a decade. WLWT as well as its WLWT.com, WLWT mobile app and the Very Local app will provide “not just the game but a full day of Opening Day coverage” on what is "annually the most-watched Reds game of the year in Greater Cincinnati." Last year’s Opening Day broadcast attracted 115,500 household impressions between Bally Sports Ohio and WKRC, which was 30,000 more than the second most-watched Reds game last season (CINCINNATI BUSINESS COURIER, 3/26).

OUTSIDE HIRE: THE ATHLETIC’s Andrew Marchand cited sources as saying that YES Network had "discussions with Buck Showalter about joining the network.” The Mets had the "right to prevent Showalter from advancing talks" with the Yankees’ RSN under the terms of Showalter’s original three-year deal. A Mets spokesperson said that they “would have allowed Showalter to work for the crosstown network if talks had advanced.” A YES spokesperson said, “Once we learned that he was still under contract, we did not pursue it any further.” Showalter will be part of MLB Network’s coverage this year, doing “once-a-month appearances” (THE ATHLETIC, 3/25).
