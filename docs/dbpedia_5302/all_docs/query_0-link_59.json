        "text": "Marty Brennaman is a blunt instrument by baseball standards, a play-by-play announcer who handles hard truths without soft-pedaling.\n\nHe is going to be a tough act to follow with the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n“There are guys in this profession that have to measure every word,” Brennaman said Thursday night at Louisville Slugger Field. “I think it’s worse today than it’s ever been. ...\n\n“I couldn’t do that. If at any point they had called me in and said, ‘This has got to stop,’ I’d have to resign.”\n\nHaving announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2019 season, his 46th year in the Reds’ radio booth, Brennaman’s characteristic candor remains one of the club’s most valuable assets. Though four straight last-place finishes have eroded attendance in Cincinnati, WLW nonetheless produced the highest ratings among baseball’s flagship stations during the 2018 season.\n\nWhile much of that is attributable to the radio station’s 50,000-watt signal, some of it surely owes to the following Brennaman has built and maintained for four decades since the breakup of the Big Red Machine.\n\nHis style, he says, is unpopular “because most guys inherently want to be liked.” But while Brennaman’s refusal to sugar-coat the club’s shortcomings has sometimes aggravated upper management and caused clubhouse confrontations with such stars as Ken Griffey Jr. and Dave Concepcion, it seems to resonate with those fans who prefer straight talk to spin.\n\nRelated: Cincinnati Reds broadcaster Marty Brennaman retiring after 2019 season\n\nHis listeners don’t always agree with him, nor do they understand all of his digressions, inside jokes or unconcealed antipathy toward pitcher Homer Bailey, but they know what they hear will be either heartfelt or humorous.\n\n“Maybe my act wouldn’t have flown in some other city,” Brennaman said. ”I’ve never approached it as a life and death proposition. I’m going to laugh. I’m going to be self-deprecating. I’m going to talk about a lot of things that a lot of guys in my profession don’t talk about.”\n\nBaseball’s long season is longer still for bad ballclubs, and local announcers must be able to improvise if they are to hold an audience through the lean years.\n\nFor a time, the Reds’ radio booth doubled as a shrine to Elvis Presley and, later, to pro wrestling. Periodically, Brennaman will enliven a spring training game (or a Hall of Fame acceptance speech) by spotting Harold Lauder warming up in the bullpen. That Lauder never gets into a game is probably due to him being a fictional character from a Stephen King novel.\n\nOver the years, a man learns to lighten up.\n\nMore from Tim Sullivan: The N is silent, but Jordan Nwora's game speaks loudly\n\nWhen he first began broadcasting Reds games in 1974, Brennaman would take losses home and take them hard. Sparky Anderson told him he had to leave the stress to the manager or he wouldn’t last.\n\nOnce prone to refer to the Reds as “we,” Brennaman stopped using the plural pronoun after pitcher Jack Billingham asked him how many hits he had contributed to a blowout of the Atlanta Braves.\n\n“That was a defining moment in my career,” Brennaman said. “People will resurrect a tape from 1975 and I cringe.”\n\nAs his style has evolved, Brennaman has been careful to draw a distinction between “telling it like it is” and “telling it like I think it is,” mindful that even an embedded announcer may not be privy to all pertinent information in real time. His cautionary tale on this score involves criticizing the outfield play of Reds’ slugger George Foster during a game in which Foster was running a 104-degree temperature.\n\n“I’m sure over the years I’ve said things that made people cringe,” he said. “When John Allen was the (chief operating officer), we’d be in social situations with people and someone would bring up my candor and John would say, “You have to understand that the opinions expressed by Marty are not necessarily those of the club.’ ”\n\nYet despite his staunchly independent spirit, and the brinkmanship of his 1980s battles with former Reds President Dick Wagner, Brennaman is one of only six big-league announcers to work 40 years for a single club.\n\n“I’ve always felt the time was going to come when I had to make a decision and I still had my health about me,” he said. “Because there are things I want to do and places I want to go with my wife.\n\n“I’m healthy as a horse, but when you get to be my age, you can have everything working perfectly and drop dead in the next two minutes. I ain’t gonna roll the dice. They wanted me to work until I had 50 years and I would be 80 years old and I said, ‘Nah, I’m not doing that.’ “\n\nHe plans to work through Sept. 26, the Reds’ last home game, and to pay homage to at least one fictional relief pitcher.\n\n“Harold,” he promised, “will be in bullpens in spring training.”"
