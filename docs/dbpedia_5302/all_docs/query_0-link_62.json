        "text": "2024 MLB Regular Season under way! Stream it live with Fubo!\n\nIf you want to watch every Reds game of the regular season, you have options depending on where you are located. You don’t need cable. Below we explain everything.\n\nIn a hurry? Local Reds fans can watch almost all games:\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds are one of the storied franchises in baseball. In fact, Opening Day in Cincinnati has historically been revered as the sport’s most traditional and supported. As a result, the Reds have opened their season at home every year since it joined the National League in 1890 with three exceptions: 1966 (rainouts), 1990 (lockout), and 2022 (lockout).\n\nAre you a Reds fan interested in following the team on Opening Day and throughout the following six or seven months? If yes, you should secure access to either DIRECTV STREAM ($108.99/mo) if you are in Bally Sports Ohio’s broadcast area or MLB.TV ($24.99/mo) if you are outside of the Reds’ blackout region.\n\nAlso consider MLB Radio ($2.99/mo) if neither applies to you, which is the case for many in Tennessee.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nSchedule and Start Times for Today’s Cincinnati Reds Game(s)\n\nGet complete details for the next game in our Cincinnati Reds Today guide.\n\nNone\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nCincinnati Reds TV Channels\n\nThe vast majority of Cincinnati Reds games are broadcast on Bally Sports Ohio, which is also unofficially known as Bally Sports Cincinnati. Essentially, all matchups not on national or regional television or exclusively streamed by an MLB partner will be on this regional sports network (RSN).\n\nBally Sports Ohio also carries games played by the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers, NHL’s Columbus Blue Jackets, and MLS’s Columbus Crew.\n\nWhen the Reds are being showcased to a larger audience, you can find the broadcast on your local Fox, ABC, or NBC affiliate or Fox Sports 1 (FS1), ESPN, TBS, or MLB Network.\n\nAnother possibility is the game being streamed by Peacock Premium or Apple TV+.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nUltimate Guide: How to Live Stream the Cincinnati Reds Without Cable\n\nReds games appear in many forms. You can find games over-the-air (OTA), on national “cable” channels and RSNs, and increasingly exclusively streaming.\n\nStreaming\n\nThere are two kinds of streaming services that relate to watching Cincinnati Reds games. The first is the live TV streaming services that provide you access to the kinds of live channels that were once only available via cable.\n\nAnd then there are specialty streaming services that stream live games independently of live channels. MLB.TV is an especially important member of this group, so we give it its section.\n\nStream the Cincinnati Reds Today With Fubo: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nFubo gives you a 150+ channel base plan including any Bally Sports channels (and other RSNs) in all your area. In and around Cincinnati, that means you will get Bally Sports Ohio for a total cost of $91.98/mo.\n\nYou will also get a full slate of local and “cable” channels as well as CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN2, FS1, FS2, and the networks beIN Sports and TUDN. And MLB.TV is available as an add-on.\n\nThe base plan also comes with unlimited cloud DVR and streaming on up to 10 devices at the same time. For more, check out our Fubo review.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nWatching the Cincinnati Reds With DIRECTV STREAM: Plans and Pricing\n\nDIRECTV STREAM (formerly AT&T TV) is another option for getting Bally Sports Ohio if you are a cord cutter. It and any other regional sports networks that you are eligible to receive because of where you are situated can be accessed after getting its Choice plan ($108.99/mo). This channel is available throughout Ohio and in parts of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New York.\n\nAll DIRECTV STREAM plans come with unlimited cloud DVR storage if you sign up online. (And you are, right?) It also allows you to stream on unlimited devices. See our DIRECTV STREAM review for more information.\n\nGet DIRECTV STREAM Free for 5 Days\n\nExplore More Ways to Watch the Cincinnati Reds Games Today\n\nConversely, if you are outside of that area, you should also consider Hulu + Live TV ($76.99/mo), Sling TV ($55.00/mo), and YouTube TV ($64.99/mo). Each of them allows you to watch many of the non-Bally Sports Ohio broadcast Reds games.\n\nSpecialty Streaming Services\n\nApple TV+ ($4.99/mo): Will exclusively stream a couple of Cincinnati Reds matchups this season. This is part of a deal that started with the 2022 campaign to stream two MLB games every Friday.\n\nPeacock Premium ($4.99/mo): Will exclusively stream 18 Sunday MLB games for at least the 2022 and 2023 seasons. The Reds will likely be featured. (Peacock review)\n\nESPN+ ($10.99/mo): Regularly streams MLB games throughout the season although these are generally subject to blackout restrictions, so this streaming service is best for out-of-market Reds fans. (ESPN+ review).\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nMLB.TV for Out-of-Market Reds Games\n\nMLB.TV provides access to all out-of-market games and so is a spectacular option for Cincinnati Reds fans who are situated outside of this club’s blackout region. However, note that this area is considerable, covering Ohio and Tennessee as well as portions of Indiana, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Mississippi, including some regions that do not receive Bally Sports Ohio through Fubo or DIRECTV STREAM.\n\nThe base plan is $24.99/mo or $139.99/yr (there are also special deals). If you are only interested in the Reds, you can get a Single Team package for $119.99/yr. Only the monthly plan comes with a free trial, however.\n\nFor everyone to whom the Reds’ blackout area does not apply, you can watch almost all Reds games that are broadcast on that channel through MLB.TV. The only ones that will be blacked out to you will occur when Cincinnati plays a team local to you.\n\nNote that MLB.TV does not provide access to any playoff games. To watch those, you will need to turn to a live TV streaming service or (in some cases) an antenna.\n\nSign up for MLB.TV on Fubo for FREE today!\n\nWatch Nationally-Broadcast Reds Games for Free With a Antenna\n\nIf you have an antenna, you can watch the Reds play whenever they feature on network television. During the regular season, this will not be often, but you will be assured of watching the team’s biggest games if they make it to the World Series since those matchups are all shown on Fox.\n\nOur Indoor Antenna Guide will get you all set up. It’s quite easy!\n\nDevices and Apps for Streaming Cincinnati Reds Games\n\nThe major services support most steaming devices in use today. We’ll just focus on the two most important streaming services for the Reds: Fubo, DIRECTV STREAM, and MLB.TV.\n\nMLB.TV also supports PlayStation and Xbox gaming systems.\n\nEverything You Need to Know About the Cincinnati Reds\n\nAlthough the Reds have no direct connection with the Red Stockings of 1869, the city of Cincinnati does. It played host to the sport’s first fully professional team that year and, as a result, is the birthplace of professional baseball.\n\nAs for the Cincinnati Reds franchise itself, it got its start in 1882 in the American Association, a major league, before moving to the National League in 1890.\n\nCincinnati played in four World Series from its founding through 1969. Those occurred in 1919, 1939, 1940, and 1961. The Reds won the 1919 and 1940 editions.\n\nLater, the Big Red Machine became a dominating force in the sport as Cincinnati claimed six division titles in the 1970s and World Series titles in 1975 and 1976.\n\nIn 1990, the Reds impressively and stunningly swept the Bash Brothers and the Oakland Athletics in the World Series to claim their last world championship.\n\nMore recently, the team has made the playoffs four times since 2010. However, the Reds lost every playoff round in that span, going 2-9 in postseason games since then.\n\nWith that said Cincinnati entered its 2022 campaign off of back-to-back winning seasons. The 2021 Reds completed play with an 83-79 mark, which was good for third-place in the NL Central standings.\n\nIn 2022, the Reds had a terrible season as they managed a losing record of 62-100 having lost 22 of their first 25 games. However, 2023 saw the Reds improve on their previous season with a record of 82-80 falling short of a playoff spot by 2 games. This earned them a third place finish in NL Central Division rankings.\n\nSince 1912, Cincinnati has played in just three stadiums: Crosley Field (1912-70), Riverfront Stadium (1970-2002), and Great American Ball Park (2003-present).\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nWrapping Up\n\nCord cutters who are also Cincinnati Reds fans and want to watch their favorite team as often as possible should get Fubo ($91.98/mo) or DIRECTV STREAM ($108.99/mo) if Bally Sports Ohio is available to them. If they are outside the Reds’ blackout zone, then they should get MLB.TV ($24.99/mo).\n\nIf watching occasional baseball games is good enough, a streaming service like Sling TV will fit the bill.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat channel is the Reds game on tonight?\n\nGenerally, the Reds will be Bally Sports Ohio. In the few cases that it is not, including if it is the postseason as no playoff games are on Bally Sports Ohio, then your focus should turn to ESPN, TBS, FS1, MLB Network, ABC, NBC, and Fox. If it is not being shown on any of those channels either, it may only be available online through Apple TV+ or Peacock Premium (both $4.99/mo).\n\nWhat radio stations cover the Reds?\n\nThe flagship station for the Reds has been Newsradio 700 WLW since 1969. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network expands far from Cincinnati, reaching much of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Also, one station apiece in Virginia, Tennessee, and Illinois broadcasts Reds games. You can also listen to the game on SiriusXM. Regardless of where you are, you can listen to the broadcasts through MLB Radio ($2.99/mo).\n\nHow do I go about watching Reds games for free?\n\nIf you are not blacked out from MLB.TV streams of Bally Sports Ohio-produced Reds broadcasts, you can periodically check out the team’s games for free, courtesy of the MLB.TV Free Game of the Day. Otherwise, your best option is to use an antenna to watch any of the club’s contests that are shown on Fox, NBC, and ABC.\n\nIs it possible to watch Reds games on my phone?\n\nYes, you absolutely can watch the Reds play on your phone. The app that you will want to download, log into, and use for this purpose will depend on how you are can these games. For example, Fubo, DIRECTV STREAM, Bally Sports, MLB.TV, and all the other services have apps that run on iOS (iPhone) and Android devices.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nWhat is the Reds roster heading to spring training?\n\nAfter losing baseman Joey Votto at the end of last season to free agency, the Cincinnati Reds have pitchers Brent Suter, Frankie Montas, and Ian Gibaut, infielders Elly De La Cruz, Jonathan India, Noelvi Marte, and Matt McLain, and outfielder Will Benson, among others for spring training.\n\nHow do I go about watching other MLB teams?\n\nSee the appropriate guide:"
