Beginning in 1937 they began designing and building television equipment. In March of 1939 they leased space in the Carew tower for television, and made the first public demonstration of television on April 26, 1939. During 1939, the first Cincinnati Reds baseball game was televised, and they participated with RCA in a television demonstration. but they didn't receive their construction permit for W8XCT until August of 1940. It is unclear whether they were actually broadcasting prior to this date.\n\nIn 1939, WLW singer Hellen Diller appeared in a Philco television demonstration. It is unclear whether this demonstration took place in Cincinnati, though the wood paneling in the photo below is very similar to that in the next picture. Here is a 1960s Crosley brochure.\n\nThe following is excerpted from the book Cincinnati Television, by Jim Friedman:\n\nJanette Davis was best known as the singing star of Arthur Godfrey's CBS television shows from 1946 to 1957. In 1939, the Crosley Radio Corporation hired Davis to perform for experimental tests. The early television cameras were very insensitive to light, so technicians needed to put a great number of lights on Davis just to create a picture. The lights generated heat and, in a short period of time, the room filled with the smell of scorched wool from Davis's clothing. This was one the early problems with the new technology; talent could be in front of the camera for only a few minutes before they were drenched with persperation. The picture below, taken off the television screen, was considered an outstanding image in 1939 (Courtesy the Clyde Haehnle collection.)\n\nRoberta (left) Lynn, and Harris Rosedale take a bow in front of the W8XCT camera operated by Phil Underwood. The Rosedales taught dance at their downtown studio, hosted a weekly amateur-hour radio show, and staged variety shows. Every Thursday, they brought their dance students and performers to the Carew Tower to perform in front of the camera. Their involvement in television continued for decades. (Courtesy Cincinnati Post.)\n\nThe camera shown above was made by DuMont, and was used in the DuMont exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\nHere is more from the book Cincinnati Television, by Jim Friedman:\n\nA 1945 list of U.S. TV stations shows that W8XCT had a construction permit, but the first telecasts probably started in late 1947. In February of 1948 they received the call sign WLWT as a commercial station. In 1949 Crosley started WLWD Dayton and WLWC Columbus. A private microwave network was built in 1949 to interconnect the three stations. Later, other stations were built by Crosley.\n\nTest patterns courtesy of Steve Dichter"
