Owned by iHeartMedia, WLW is a clear-channel station, often identifying itself as “The Big One”. Its studios are located in Sycamore Township (with a Cincinnati address).\n\nWLW operates with 50,000 watts around the clock. The transmitter site features a distinctive diamond-shaped Blaw-Knox tower in nearby Mason. Its daytime signal is heard at city-grade strength as far as Indianapolis, Indiana; Lexington, Kentucky and Columbus, Ohio, with secondary coverage as far as Louisville and the outer suburbs of Cleveland and Detroit. At night, with a good radio, it can be heard in much of North America.\n\nWLW is a primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System for Southwest Ohio, Kentucky and Eastern Indiana. Besides its main analog transmission, its programming is simulcast on 99-watt FM translator W233BG on 94.5 MHz and on an HD digital subchannel of co-owned 107.1 MHz WKFS."
