        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Major League Baseball and the Cincinnati Reds have a home in Nashville. ESPN 94.9 Game 2 (WBUZ-D3) and the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network are pleased to announce a new partnership for the 2017 season. This marks the first Major League Baseball affiliation for ESPN 94.9 Game 2, as over 130 Cincinnati Reds games will be heard on Nashville radio this season, including Opening Day on Monday, April 3.\n\nCromwell Market Manager, Jana Hampton, says, “Nashville is a city thriving with transplants. 94.9 Game 2 offers the best National Sports Talk with ESPN programming starting with Mike & Mike and including Paul Finebaum. Adding the Cincinnati Reds to the list of our offerings is just one more way we are giving fans a chance to hear another team they love.”\n\n“The Reds along with our fans in Nashville thank Cromwell Radio for bringing Reds baseball to the local airwaves,” said Karen Forgus, Cincinnati Reds Senior Vice President of Business Operations. “Tennessee has been part of Reds Country for generations and we are excited to add this important station to our Cincinnati Reds Radio Network affiliates.”\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds Radio broadcast team is led by legendary Hall of Fame voice Marty Brennaman, who has handled the play-by-play duties since 1974. For the 11th straight season, Brennaman will be joined in the booth by former MLB pitcher, Jeff Brantley. Also making appearances on radio this season will be Thom Brennaman and Jim Kelch.\n\nCromwell’s baseball coverage will be headlined by the Cincinnati Reds, but will also feature “Sunday Night Baseball” on sister station, ESPN 102.5 The Game (WPRT-FM), and other national games provided by ESPN Radio.\n\nESPN 94.9 Game 2 also serves as an affiliate of University of Kentucky Athletics, Alabama Football and Auburn Football.\n\n“Having a pair of 24/7 sports radio stations in a growing market like Nashville, it’s important to have a baseball partnership every summer,” said Ryan Porth, Program Director of ESPN 102.5 The Game and 94.9 Game 2. “We are very excited to bring Reds Baseball to the radio airwaves in Music City.”\n\nThe Reds will begin their 2017 season at Great American Ball Park when they host the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday, April 3 at 3:10 p.m. CST. Pregame coverage on ESPN 94.9 Game 2 will begin at 2:40 p.m.\n\nFor a full list of Reds games to be played on ESPN 94.9 Game 2, visit thegamenashville.com.\n\nESPN 102.5 THE GAME and 94.9 GAME 2 are locally owned by Bayard “Bud” Walters and are sister stations to: heritage rock station, 102.9 THE BUZZ; 102.1 THE LIGHT; and 93.3 CLASSIC HITS.
