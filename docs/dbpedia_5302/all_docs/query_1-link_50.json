        "text": "Baseball is back, Reds fans! Pitchers and catcher reported to spring training on Valentine's Day, full squad workouts began earlier this week, and on Saturday, the first Cactus League game of the season will commence at Goodyear Stadium when the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Guardians take the field.\n\nThe Guardians, who hold their spring training at the complex in Goodyear, Arizona, will be the home team on Saturday, February 24th. The first pitch is slated to take place at 3 p.m. ET. Manager David Bell has yet to name a starter for that contest.\n\nUnfortunately, not every Reds game will be televised this spring, but the Cincinnati faithful will still receive a handful of opportunities to see their favorite players competing for a spot on this year's Opening Day roster.\n\nReds release 2024 spring training broadcast schedule\n\nEvery year, Major League Baseball divides up all 30 teams between Arizona and Florida and allows the clubs to get into in-season form with about a month's worth of exhibition games. The Reds' slate of Cactus League games begins on Saturday, and runs through March 24th against those same Cleveland Guardians.\n\nThe Bally Sports Ohio broadcast team of Jim Day, Chris Welsh, John Sadak, and Sam LeCure will be on hand this spring to lend their talents to calling three of the Reds' seven televised games. The other four games will be broadcasted by other Bally Sports regional networks.\n\nThe Bally Sports Ohio crew will be giving play-by-play and color commentary for Cincinnati's February 26th's contest against the Seattle Mariners at Goodyear Ballpark. They'll also be on hand when the Reds welcome the Kansas City Royals on March 15th and the Colorado Rockies on March 23rd.\n\nOther Bally's Sports regional networks will broadcast Cincinnati's games against the Cleveland Guardians (February 24th and March 24th), the defending World Champion Texas Rangers (March 15th), and the Shohei Ohtani-less Los Angeles Angels (March 19th).\n\nThe closer we get to Opening Day, the more the roster battles will begin to heat up. Hunter Greene, Andrew Abbott, and Elly De La Cruz are looking to take their success from 2023 and turn it into a playoff run in 2024. Get ready for some exciting Cactus League games that will offer Reds fans a preview of coming attractions once the season begins on March 28th."
