        "text": "93.7 The Light (WFCJ-FM) is a broadcast ministry of Strong Tower Christian Media, whose mission is to use multiple media platforms to reach more hearts with deeper impact by sharing the love of Jesus through Biblical teaching and worshipful music. We broadcast 50,000 watts from our 541 foot tower in Miamisburg, Ohio, our city of license.Â From there, our signal blankets Dayton, Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky and Eastern Indiana.\n\n93.7 The Light airs the best in Christian teaching and talk 24/7.Â We start your weekday mornings with the only live, local Christian morning show in Dayton and Cincinnati â called âLiving Lifeâ. Then, throughout the day our programs will help you grow in your faith, strengthen your Biblical world view and provide practical help in managing your finances and relationships in a God-honoring way.\n\nWe offerÂ one additional format,Â a 24/7Â praise and worship channelÂ through HD broadcasting and live-streaming from our websiteÂ 937thelight.com.Â Â Take us with you wherever you go by downloading our free mobile app in the Apple or Google Play Store.\n\nWFCJÂ went on the air January 7, 1961 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization; theÂ first Christian FM station in the area,Â and the second in the state of Ohio. Commercially licensed, one-third of our funding comes from commercial and broadcast partners;Â Â the remaining two-thirds from the donations of individuals and families.\n\nWe appreciate your prayers and support which help keepÂ The LightÂ on the air!\n\nLauren Kitchens-Steward was born & raised in Tupelo, MS & attended The University Of Mississippi on a music scholarship. She went on to receive two undergraduate degrees in Music & Communications from Oral Roberts University in Tulsa OK where she was led praise & worship. Lauren also holds a Masterâs degree in Radio, TV, & Film from Regent University in Virginia Beach, VA where she started her media career on the Family Channel.\n\nLauren spent 2 summers in Europe & 1 in Canada on mission trips while she was in college.\n\nHer 31 year background in Media includes hosting a Morning Show on the Family Channel, co hosting on TBN with John Tesh, TV News Reporting, being a repeated guest on Bill Maher's show Politically Incorrect on ABC & hosting radio shows for Salem Radio Network Los Angeles & Nashville, Clear Channel Communications, Sony Worldwide and American Family Radio Network before coming to Strong Tower, and hosting the Morning Show at 88.7 The Cross in NE Louisiana.\n\nLauren is a college professor having held positions at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, TN and Azusa Pacific University in Los Angeles.\n\nShe & her husband Robin have a passion for adoption & have beautiful daughter from Nepal named Channing & a feisty son Knox from China & an amazing 2 year old they adopted from Dallas named Chambers. They also have 3 grown children William, Miller, & Olivia who bless their hearts to overflowing. Lauren is daily involved in pet rescue which explains their plethora of pups coming out of the wood work.\n\nShe loves Jesus & asked him into heart when she was 7. Lauren is an only child & was blessed to grow up in a beautiful home packed full of love & joy with two parents who loved the Lord to the core. She has a passion for helping people see their extreme value & worth & realizes âIf the enemy canât win your soul, the next thing he will attempt to do is render you ineffective. When the saints of God know whose they are, look out!ââ\n\nJoy is no stranger to radio with 30 years of experience in Christian radio as well as television. She hosted âJoy in the Morningâ on WEEC for 10 years prior to her move to San Antonio, Texas. While in San Antonio, Joy was the Promotions Director for 3 Salem Communication stations as well as morning drive host on KSLR. Joy also was a host for TBNâs Community Affairs program, âJoy In Our Townâ as well as a guest on various occasions.\n\nJoyâs newest âhatâ at Hope 100.7 is hosting EnJoy! You can spend your evenings with Joy from 7-midnight.\n\nGrowing up in Ohio and moving to Michigan for 7 years early in her marriage proved to be a challenge, especially on game day! Seriously, God has shown Himself strong in her life as well as her husband Charles, daughters, Lauren and Olivia through many tough struggles that could easily break a family apart. When Joy is not speaking, writing or planning retreats, she enjoys time with her family.\n\nJoyâs favorite scripture is Psalm 16:11 âHe will show you the pathway of life and in His Presence is fullness of joy.â"
