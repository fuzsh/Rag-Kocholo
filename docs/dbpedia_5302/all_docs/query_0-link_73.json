        "text": "Of all the thousands of Cincinnati Reds games called by Marty Brennaman, there is likely no one who’s listened to more of them than the guy who’s spent nearly three and a half decades getting them on the air. Dave “Yiddy” Armbruster has been with 700WLW radio since 1982, although putting it that way does a great disservice to Yid’s radio career, which has included nearly every role on- and off-air imaginable.\n\nYid has been the producer and engineer of the Reds Radio Network since 1986, which means he’s tasked with handling the technical parts of the broadcasts and is ready to handle the, um, feedback, from Brennaman when things occasionally go wrong. It also means there isn’t a person besides the late Joe Nuxhall who’s spent more time in a broadcast booth with Brennaman.\n\nIn the coming days, there will be no shortage of shared perspectives on Marty’s career, impact, legacy and personality. But perhaps no one’s Marty perspective is as unique, or as intimate, as that of the man who’s spent nearly three and a half decades making sure his microphone is turned on.\n\nYid sat down with me to talk about what it’s been like to work closely with — and get chewed out by — one of the greatest play-by-play announcers in sports.\n\nI want to start with this season, then maybe work backward a little bit. I’ve listened a little differently, not only savoring each time I’ve listened during Marty’s final season, but also curious to see if he sounds at all different, if he sounds maybe a little reflective or even melancholy, but to me, he sounds the same as he has for years. You’re there every day, so what’s Marty’s final season been like in the booth?\n\nFor the most part, Marty’s not very reflective, but I think he will be coming down the homestretch. It’s been good, though. Busy. Marty’s told me, “I think I’m going to die before I retire,” because he’s been running everywhere. The booth is like Grand Central Station anyway; this year has been beyond the usual. There’s so many people that want to stop in and say hello, lots of people he’s known for years. He gets that that’s part of the gig right now, and we were prepared for more visitors than normal, but for the most part, it’s been business as usual. He still treats every game, every broadcast, the same as he has since I’ve been there.\n\nYou began working for 700WLW in 1982. So a few years later, when you’re in your mid-2os, someone tells you you’re going to engineer the games, in the booth with Marty and Joe. By then, Marty has been there for a while and he’s certainly well-established and popular, but I’m guessing at that point, he’s still not the bigger-than-life figure that he would become. But I would imagine that working with him was still very intimidating.\n\nIt was panic central, especially when I filled in for three games the season before, then becoming the full-time guy the next year, starting on Opening Day, which you obviously cannot screw up.\n\nWhen you meet Marty for the first time, he’s a really, really good guy, but he can be intimidating. He’ll say things to you as soon as the first time he’s met you that, deep down inside he’s joking, but you don’t know that he’s joking. I can’t tell you exactly what he said to me when I started, but all I know is I was scared to death, and he makes it known from the get-go that he’ll be on you if you screw something up, and it’s still that way now.\n\nBut that said, he’s the best person to work for, ever. He will go off on you and let you have it, but 15 minutes later he’s forgotten about whatever upset him that you screwed up and he’s ready to move on.\n\nIs there a specific incident — recent or way back when — where he just carved you up?\n\nI don’t know that I can remember one incident that really stands out, but whatever it was, I guarantee it involved something not working. Maybe it was his mic or the mixer wasn’t working, maybe the recorder was busted. Either way, his standard go-to when something goes wrong is to rip on the equipment.\n\nEvery time, it’s, “Ah, the shitty equipment. Every other place we go, the equipment is fine, but the crap we have here is so old …” That’s not the case, obviously, but that’s how he digs at you. He can carve you up with words better than anyone I’ve ever met, but I honestly can’t think of one particular incident, but it does happen. It happened two weeks ago.\n\nSo after all these years, well over three decades, he’ll still light you up?\n\nHe had to be down on the field for some sort of pregame ceremony, which means he had to record his open for the broadcast. So I hand him a mic, we record it and, of course, it didn’t work. There was no audio, so of course, here he goes with, “That shitty equipment; you can’t get this crap right.”\n\nThat kind of thing has happened countless times over the years. You just learn to deal with it, and eventually, you get to a point where you’ve learned not to tell him when things have gone wrong. That’s really the trick.\n\nWhen the Reds go on the road, there is always someone in each city who does what you do. Do you ever hear from an unsuspecting engineer who maybe hasn’t worked with Marty and doesn’t know what he or she is in for?\n\nBelieve it or not, no! In fact, just the opposite. The Reds were just in Seattle, and the engineer there called me because he was worried that Marty wasn’t coming. I had to assure him that, yes, Marty would be there. Those guys love him. They know how he is, but they can’t wait for him to get there, and Marty loves messing with those guys, a few of whom he’s actually known longer than he’s known me.\n\nThose guys will tell you the same thing. Marty can cut you down, but he never — ever — stays mad.\n\nIs there a time you can point to where Marty goes from being a respected, popular broadcaster to this celebrated figure who might be, at least in some respects, bigger than the team itself? More simply put: When did Marty become Marty?\n\nI think when he won the Ford C. Frick Award in 2000 and became a Hall of Famer. That might be part of it. That came with a lot of attention. Then, doing “Brennaman and Jones on Baseball” and before then “Brennaman and Bench on Baseball” (daily segments that have aired on the 700WLW morning show for years) helped that transformation even more, because those shows took him out of the realm of just broadcasting a game, allowing him to talk about other things, especially all these years with Tracy (Jones). That show allows him to be goofy and crazy. They’re supposed to be about baseball, but really they’re about Marty. I think that’s had a lot to do with it.\n\nWhen did Marty start being so brutally honest on the air?\n\nIf I had to pick a specific time, I’d say post-’90, especially as we got to the late ’90s when the Reds weren’t very good. Then you add in the Hall of Fame in 2000 and a long time until they won the division in 2010; the team just didn’t win that often.\n\nI don’t know any of this for sure, but under some of the old regimes — (general managers) Bob Howsam and Dick Wagner — Marty being as honest as he is now just wouldn’t happen, even though he had some big blowouts with Wagner over what he could and couldn’t say on the air. Over time, though, I think Marty just gained a little more power to navigate the fine line between being a shill for the club and talking about what’s actually happening. There’s no question that the team knows how popular Marty Brennaman is. There’s no question that sponsors know how popular Marty Brennaman is. He’s one of the few who does what he does that has the power to speak his mind, and we’re not going to see or hear anyone like him ever again.\n\nI’ve always thought your perspective has to be so cool. The coolest part for me, if I was you, would be in the hours before the game when you’re both there in the booth well before the beginning of a broadcast. So what’s it like to have literally a front-row seat to watch one of the greatest who’s ever done baseball play-by-play getting ready to call a game?\n\nA lot of people listen to someone like Marty and they say, “Well, I can do that.” Um, no you can’t. Marty does a lot of work at home, then gets to the park, even at the age of 77, at 2:30 in the afternoon for a 7:10 game. He does not need to do that. He’s Marty Brennaman, you know? He could show up at 5 and no one would say a word. But he starts his prep at 2:30, and to watch him is incredible because he really does prepare as well as anybody I’ve ever seen. I mean, other than writing the lineups in his scorebook, he’s already pretty much set when he gets to the ballpark. Aside from that, it’s getting information from the other team, maybe entertaining guests, but mainly it’s just remarkable that someone who’s been at it this long, who can call a game with his eyes closed, shows up more than four and a half hours before a game.\n\nYou obviously weren’t working in the booth when Marty and Joe were first paired, but you were there in 2007 when Jeff Brantley joined the broadcast. I remember very early that year, maybe even in spring training, listening to Marty and Jeff together, thinking this could work. Give me your perspective on the development of that relationship.\n\nYes, I thought it would work. Now remember, Thom (Brennaman) started that spring, too, and at the time he was doing a little more radio, including some games with Jeff, but to answer your question, yes, I thought it would work, and a lot of that comes from Jeff’s respect for Marty and, for that matter, Thom. When Jeff got here, he was “Jeff Brantley,” not “The Cowboy.” And in those first few weeks, Jeff was just feeling his way around.\n\nOne time comes to mind. I think it took a while for Jeff to understand, as it does everybody, that Marty Brennaman is not a baseball announcer. Marty Brennaman is an entertainer, and baseball just happens to be there. You could do the Marty Brennaman Show every night, and it would be funny. Anyway, when Jeff is doing play-by-play, Marty is doing other things. He’s watching the game, but he’ll go visit people, and he likes to read USA Today, which I remember specifically him doing this one game.\n\nHe’s reading the USA Today purple section (the Life section) while Jeff’s calling the game, and he signals to me to turn on his mic. He says, on the air, “Jeff, let me ask you a question. Would you pay 200 dollars to see Celine Dion?” Jeff looks at Marty like he’s out of his mind and in that Southern drawl says, “I don’t pay for my tickets.” So we get to the break and Marty says, “Jeff, what are you doing? You’re talking to people who aren’t you. You’ve made a ton of money pitching in the big leagues, but you’re talking to people who work really hard to put some cash together to see a concert. You can’t talk about getting free tickets — you’re talking to real people.” To me, that was a turning point, one of the moments that helped turn Jeff into “The Cowboy.” The light went on, and he started to understand.\n\nMarty relates to everybody, which is why people like listening to him. Now, so is Jeff. But it took Marty teaching him who they’re broadcasting to and who’s in their audience. Jeff got to the point he’s at now by reacting to Marty talking about goofy things and realizing that it’s OK to laugh at things, laugh at myself and be the butt of the joke.\n\nI never realized this until Dan Hoard told me this years ago: “Marty Brennaman makes everybody better.”\n\nWhich brings me to recent years, because there have been a lot of announcers Marty has had to work with over the last few seasons, some less experienced than others. As a listener, it’s seemed like Marty has gone out of his way to put these guys over.\n\nAbsolutely, and he doesn’t have to do that. You and I both know people that wouldn’t do that. This is a business filled with paranoid people, and no one wants anybody stepping on their turf. But Marty is comfortable with who he is, and he’s not afraid of being fired. He also knows that it’s part of his job to make these guys better, and he will go out of his way to do that. Go back to Steve Stewart (who called Reds games in 2005 and 2006); Marty really worked with him to make him better, get him more comfortable and not come off so robotic.\n\nIt’s not like Marty says, “Sit down, son, and let me teach you.” It’s just little things as you go, little pointers like remembering who you’re talking to, talk about what you’re comfortable talking about. It’s like with Danny Graves — Marty will tell him, “You were a pitcher; talk about pitching and then we’ll get to the other stuff.” He’ll tell them during breaks if they’re talking too much or sometimes not enough. He wants these guys to get better, and he’ll do what he can to help them succeed.\n\nYou won’t believe the number of high school kids, college kids and even guys that are in the business who come to Marty or send him a tape, asking for feedback, and he gives it to almost everybody. We’ve had college kids shadow him for a day, and he does not have to do that, and yet he does that kind of thing all the time.\n\nYou could ask Brian Anderson, who does Brewers games and works for Turner Sports. He’s used Marty’s advice to help get to where he is. Marty has done that with so many people. It’s just part of his personality.\n\nTake me back to the last few seasons of Marty and Joe together. By then, Joe as an announcer no longer had his fastball, so to speak. Marty still did. It was still Marty and Joe, but listening to them together over those final few years wasn’t entirely what it had been for so many years. So what was it like being in the booth and watching Marty, for lack of a better way of putting it, having to elevate Joe a little during those final few seasons?\n\nAt times, it was a little tough because, as you said, you knew Joe had lost his fastball. Through all of that, though, it’s not like Marty said, “Oh boy, we have to get this better.” Never. Not once. He loved having Joe there and didn’t want anyone else. But Joe had health problems, and those last few years, Joe actually had a wheelchair in the booth, hidden from view in case something would happen to Joe.\n\nSo Marty was aware of what Joe was dealing with, but he never let it affect what he did on the air, and looking back, I’m not even sure he turned his mic on more often while Joe was doing play-by-play. He never felt like he had to interject more or help Joe, but if he ever felt like he had to, he would have.\n\nIf someone who isn’t familiar with Marty’s work asked you to explain why we’re making such a big deal about him, why he’s no revered and what it is that’s made him so good, what would you say?\n\nHe’s one of us. He’s just a simple dude from Virginia. He happens to be really good at what he does, but deep down Marty is just the wise ass in school, the kid everyone loved because he would say anything at any time. You can’t help but listen to him and be entertained.\n\nI could find you tomorrow a hundred guys that can do play-by-play in the big leagues, but you can’t find people that are entertaining. I’ve had countless people send me tapes over the years, and I always tell them that I don’t want a best-of tape because anyone can do a best-of. Send me the tape of the 10-zip blowout when your team’s losing and it’s a four-hour game. If you listen to Marty in those situations, that’s when he’s at his absolute best.\n\nHe can obviously call a big play with anybody. I’ll put him up against Vin Scully or anybody you name. The difference is, when the game isn’t very good, he’s still perfect. He can talk about anything, and he can take something very minute and make it something big.\n\nI’ll give you an example. This is when we were still at Riverfront and fax machines were just becoming a thing, so we had one in the booth. For reasons I can’t completely go into, Marty mentions Buck Jones’ horse. That turns into a long conversation on-air about TV cowboys and their horses that went on for four innings, and we’re getting faxes in the booth about Buck Jones and horses. It was one of those things that in some dog of a game in the middle of the season you’ll listen to because even if you don’t know who Buck Jones is, it’s funny and relatable. It sounds silly, but that’s the kind of thing he’s done time and again over the years, where he mentions something small and it turns into a thing that people remember.\n\nIt’s the most entertaining three hours in Major League Baseball, I guarantee. There’s nobody that can even come close because when you try to be funny, you can’t. Guys that are funny, they’re funny without trying too hard. It’s just there, something you’re born with. That’s Marty.\n\nSomeone asked me what my favorite Marty call was, and whenever this comes up, people recite their favorites. My favorite Marty calls aren’t actual calls but instead those moments when he’d be telling a story or riffing on something and I’d stay in my car even though I’d arrived at where I was going because I wanted to hear the payoff to the story or rant. The greatest attribute a broadcaster can have, in my mind, is the ability to hold an audience. So, as someone who’s been in the booth with Marty for thousands of games, is there a call or a story or a moment that stands out as your absolute favorite?\n\nTom Browning’s perfect game is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in baseball, so that call stands out above all else, but the things you’re talking about, stories where you have to hear how it ends, those are what I think about.\n\nWay back when, when Marty and Joe would talk about their tomato plants — I bet Marty grew one tomato plant in his life — and people still ask him about his tomato plants. Stuff like that sticks with listeners.\n\nIn the late ’90s, we went through an Elvis phase, and that was hilarious because our booth filled up with crap that people sent us, and we still have the Elvis bust. Rich Walburg, who worked at the radio station for years, would write Elvis fun facts. They were just goofy, weird facts about Elvis that Marty would read every night, and people couldn’t wait for them. One night, Marty read one about Colonel Parker and dancing chickens, which for some reason made Marty and Joe crack up to the point where neither could talk, which is one of those instances where if you’re a listener, you’re laughing because they’re laughing. That’s the stuff I remember most: the nonsensical, stupid stuff that made people laugh.\n\nThere was the time Randy “Macho Man” Savage visited the booth. That was one of the funniest things I’ve ever witnessed. In fact, that’s my moment. Marty talking to Macho Man and trying to get through the whole thing without laughing while Savage is going out of his mind. At one point, Eric Davis came out of the Reds dugout and started flexing, and I couldn’t stop laughing.\n\nAfter the game, Marge Schott made us come to her office. Why I had to go, I have no idea, because I had nothing to do with it. I’m sitting in the office, she’s going nuts, and Steve Schott, her nephew, tells Marge that he was going to physically remove this hulked-up pro wrestler, to which Marty said, “If you would’ve done that, Steve, he would have pinched your head off.”\n\nYou’re right, though; it’s the stuff that would stand out in the broadcast for being different. He’d read letters and emails from people. He’d read fake headlines from tabloids and try to keep a straight face.\n\nI’ll tell you the other thing: I love how he reads the lineup. He has one phrase he uses, not often, where for example he’ll say, “In center field is Nick Senzel, to his left in right field is Aristides Aquino, to his right in left field is Phillip Ervin.” To me, that is so cool because it just flows, it’s unique, and it paints a picture. Not everyone can do that.\n\nYou’re one of the least sentimental people I know. Still, 34 years in that booth with Marty, and it’s all about to end after thousands of games. Have you thought about what that final broadcast will be like?\n\nPainful. You’re right; I’m not very sentimental, but I guarantee you I’ll cry. Guarantee it. It will be the end of part of my life. I’m as close to Marty Brennaman as I am to people in my family because I see him more. I’m with him, counting spring training, well over 100 days a year for six, seven hours at a time. To me he’s family, and I hope he feels the same. We play golf with each other, but it’s not like we hang in the same crowds, yet he’s as close to me as anyone. It’s what I love about getting to the ballpark early: the chance to talk to Marty about things. Different things, family things. I mean, he’s known my daughter since the day she was born. I think we took Hannah to the Hot Stove League show when she was three days old, and now she’ll walk into the booth and it’s, “Hi, Marty.” I was invited to his daughter’s wedding, so yeah, it’s going to be an adjustment. It’s going to be hard.\n\nI don’t want to even think about how I’ll feel like another one of thousands of listeners that day, so how does someone in your position with the relationship you have with Marty do that? Have you even talked to him about it?\n\nNo, because I’m afraid. We did it with Joe in 2004. That was emotional, and that postgame show was really, really hard to get through, and I think this one will be the same thing from the eighth inning on. Right now, I’m trying to decide how I’ll throw it to him at the end of the pregame show for the final time. I don’t know how I’ll do that. What do you say?\n\nIt’s going to be like that the entire game. I know Marty wants it to be normal, and I want it to be normal, but it’s the one game that I really hope that the crowd coming in and out of the booth is minimal, at least from, say, the fifth inning on. After that, hopefully it’s just us. Us in the booth, and Marty with the audience, because that’s what it’s about, and I think he wants it that way. I think he wants his final games to be really normal.\n\nYou know, every night at 5:30 we eat dinner in the media kitchen. It’s Marty, Jeff about half the time, Tommy Thrall, Chris Welsh, Thom Brennaman, Jim Day, Jeff Piecoro, all of us eating dinner together. You talk about something I’ll miss — I’ve been doing that for 34 years. That is Marty on his stage. He will say anything to anybody. So, leading up to the game might be harder than the game itself because once baseball starts, it’ll be baseball until we start creeping to the eighth inning. But that last time we eat together, man, that’s going to be rough.\n\n(Top photo: From left, Jeff Brantley, Dave Armbruster and Marty Brennaman. Courtesy of Dave Armbruster)"
