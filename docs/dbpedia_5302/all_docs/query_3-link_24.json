Thank You, Mary\n\nNick Trautmann\n\nI have listened to WLW am for 40 years but I may be trimming my listening from 9am to 12:00 pm. Scott Slone's opinion on immigration, abortion, and etc. is very atypical to the views that I'm accustomed to listening to on WLW am. I will still continue listening to the other programs.\n\nGeorge Williamson\n\nSandy Collins is just right person to read the news on WLW.\n\nA\n\nHow does 'Sandy Collins' have a job?\n\nI was excited to hear a female voice when she first came to 700WLW, but she is awful at her job. No preparation apparently.\n\nDoes the station manager listen at all? Offer suggestions for improvement?\n\nExcrutiating to listen to now.\n\nBobbie Rieman Becker\n\nI love Jim Schott. When I was 14 years old and in the hospital for spinal surgery for almost 3 months, Jim called me a few times a week while I was at Good Sam. He called me and on my birthday he came to visit bringing me a birthday cake and a large bag of Grippo Potato Chips. He stayed for around a half hour and really enjoyed talking with him. He made me feel so special. He is such a great guy. God bless him.\n\nThanks Jim!\n\nBobbie Sue Rieman Becker"
