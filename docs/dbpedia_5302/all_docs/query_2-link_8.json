        "text": "Update 1:20 p.m. Tuesday Feb. 20: Two more Reds spring training telecasts have been announced by Bally Sports Ohio, for a total of seven Cactus League games.\n\nBally Sports will air the Thursday March 14 game against the World Champion Texas Rangers, and the March 19 Los Angeles Angels game which MLB Network also plans to carry live. Over the weekend the Reds announced that fans would see five Reds games on Bally Sports Ohio, and another five games live on the MLB Network, including the March 19 Angels same.\n\nBoth the Rangers and Angels games will feature the opposing team’s announcers.\n\nBally Sports Ohio says that “a rotation of Chris Welsh, John Sadak, Jim Day and Sam LeCure” will call the action for three “March to Opening Day” games. The other four will be produced by different Bally Sports regional networks, and feature the opposing team’s announcers, Bally Sports Ohio said.\n\nReds games on Bally Sports Ohio stream live on the Bally Sports app and on ballysports.com when a consumer authenticates through their pay-tv service, Bally Sports Ohio said. Visit Help.BallySports.com for support; streaming support can also be found @ballysportshelp on X (Twitter).\n\nOriginal post 10:50 a.m. Monday Feb. 19: Play ball! When the much anticipated 2024 Cincinnati Reds season starts Saturday, Feb. 24, fans can watch the spring opener live on Bally Sports Ohio, and hear it on Fox Sports WSAI-AM (1360) or foxsports1360.iheart.com.\n\nBally Sports Ohio will air five Reds home games from Goodyear, Ariz. Two — the first game and the last game (March 24) from Goodyear — will feature announcers for the Cleveland Guardians, who share the Arizona complex with the Reds.\n\nThe MLB Network also has scheduled five Reds games, but four will use the opposing team’s announcers, graphics or crew, according to Rob Butcher, Reds vice president for media relations. The MLB game with Reds announcers, against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday March 24, also will be seen on Bally Sports Ohio.\n\nWLW-AM will broadcast a majority (17) of 30 spring games — including the Reds’ second game on Sunday, Feb. 25 — as it works around commitments for University of Cincinnati and Xavier University basketball games. Weaker WSAI-AM will air 10 Reds games. There will be no broadcasts for the Reds’ three road split squad games.\n\nAll of the Reds radio broadcasts will be streamed by whatever station airs the game, says Dave \"Yiddy\" Armbruster, Reds radio producer-director and iHeartMedia's sports operations director. The Reds radio pregame show starts 30 minutes before the first pitch.\n\nDay games will air at 3:05 p.m. Cincinnati time through Saturday March 9. Start time changes to 4:05 p.m. with Daylight Saving Time on March 10. Here’s the complete Reds spring schedule.\n\nThe Bally Sports telecasts:\n\nSaturday Feb. 24: At Cleveland Guardians (Cleveland feed) 3:05 p.m. (WSAI-AM).\n\nMonday Feb. 26: Seattle Mariners at Goodyear 3:05 p.m. (WSAI-AM).\n\nThursday March 14: At Texas Rangers (Rangers feed), 9 p.m. (WSAI-AM).\n\nFriday March 15: Kansas City Royals at Goodyear, 4:05 p.m. (WSAI-AM).\n\nTuesday, March 19: At LA Angels (Angels’ feed), 4:10 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nSaturday March 23: Colorado Rockies at Goodyear, 4:05 p.m. (WLW-AM)\n\nSunday, March 24: Cleveland Guardians at Goodyear, 4:05 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nThe Reds’ live telecasts on MLB Network:\n\nThursday, Feb. 29: Los Angeles Dodgers at Goodyear (Dodgers feed), (8:05 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nThursday, March 7: Chicago Cubs at Goodyear (Cubs feed), 8:05 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nFriday, March 8: At Los Angeles Dodgers (Dodgers feed), 8:06 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nTuesday, March 19: At LA Angels (Angels’ feed), 4:10 p.m. (WLW-AM).\n\nSaturday, March 23: Colorado Rockies at Goodyear (Reds feed), 4:05 p.m. (WLW-AM)\n\nThe Reds regular season Opening Day is Thursday, March 28, with a 4:10 p.m. game against the Washington Nationals on WLW-AM and Bally Sports Ohio."
