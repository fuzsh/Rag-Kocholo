        "text": "The Chicago White Sox fired manager Pedro Grifol on Thursday, turning the page on an era that seemed doomed almost from the start.\n\nThe decision came on the heels of a franchise-record 21-game losing streak and after Grifol denied reports of rancor in the clubhouse. Now 28-89, the White Sox are on pace to challenge the 1962 New York Mets’ modern-era record of 120 losses, the most in history.\n\nGrady Sizemore, a former MLB player and current member of the White Sox’s coaching staff, has been named interim manager.\n\n“This morning, I had some very tough conversations, starting with Pedro, dismissing him as our manager,” White Sox general manager Chris Getz said in a video conference call with reporters. “I do want to start with commending Pedro for his professionalism, for his care, for his passion for this game and for the White Sox and how much he put into this. …\n\n“With that being said, there was underperformance. It’s now our job to turn the page and move forward and create an environment for the players that we currently have on this roster and for the younger players that are going to be breaking into the big leagues here shortly.”\n\nThe team also announced three coaching changes Thursday: Charlie Montoyo (bench coach), Eddie Rodriguez (third base) and Mike Tosar (assistant hitting coach) have been fired. They were replaced by Doug Sisson, Justin Jirschele and Mike Gellinger, respectively. Drew Butera will be a co-bench coach with Sisson.\n\nBut the current staff will not be contenders for the full-time manager job, Getz said.\n\n“I think it’s important to bring in a new voice, a fresh voice, perhaps that’s been exposed to areas of this game that we don’t currently have in our organization,” Getz said. “I’m very curious to learn more about some of these individuals and then we’ll get it to the finish line and name the next manager.”\n\nGetz, a former big-league player who was promoted from farm director to GM late last season, has built a front-office core from outside the Sox organization, all of whom have their own contacts and favorite coaches. He’s also been updating a personal list of possible managers that he would want to target for years. Getz said they won’t rush the search.\n\n“We’re going to have a broad search when it comes to finding the next manager,” Getz said. “And it’s going to be a thorough interview process, so every candidate’s obviously going to be different based on personality and resumé. We’re going to find the right fit, so to clearly define who that person is or what that person looks like, I think is premature.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhy Grady Sizemore took a $15-an-hour internship to launch a coaching career\n\nGrifol, 54, was hired in November 2022 to replace veteran manager Tony La Russa, who stepped down following an 81-81 campaign and after he faced health issues that forced him to miss the season’s final 34 games. When then-GM Rick Hahn unveiled Grifol in an introductory press conference, he told reporters that they would see him “smiling a little bit more than you have over the past year.”\n\nInstead, the 2023 White Sox finished 61-101 and Hahn was fired along with executive vice president Ken Williams last August.\n\nGrifol came to the White Sox after 10 seasons on the major-league staff of the Kansas City Royals. He previously worked in player development and as a minor-league manager for the Seattle Mariners.\n\nHe was spared a one-year tenure by chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, the ultimate decision-maker, and Getz, who previously worked with Grifol in the Royals organization. But the White Sox’s decision to embark on a new rebuild left little hope for a turnaround in 2024. Grifol finished with an 89-190 record as White Sox manager.\n\n“We know the flaws in this roster,” Getz said. “But with that being said, we expected to win more games — we did. These factors led to the decision.”\n\nThe White Sox opened the year with 22 losses in their first 25 games, tying the 2022 Cincinnati Reds and the 2003 Detroit Tigers for the worst 25-game start in the modern era. Only the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who began 2-23, were worse.\n\nIt didn’t get much better. The White Sox began their franchise-record slide on July 10 against the Minnesota Twins. When the streak hit 16 games against the Royals on July 30, Grifol denied a report from a Chicago radio station that said he told White Sox players that it would be on them if they broke the MLB record for losses.\n\nThe White Sox, who began play in 1901, have lost 100 games just five times, including a franchise-record 106 losses in 1970.\n\nIs Getz focused on avoiding the ignominy that would come with breaking the Mets’ record?\n\n“Well, it’s certainly something that we would like to avoid,” he said. “No one wants to be associated with a record like that. Now, with that being said, it has not been the highest priority, being that we just went through a trade deadline and moved on from players that obviously were attractive to other clubs. But our main focus has been and will remain the future of this organization.”\n\nAs for why a coach, or experienced manager like the Miami Marlins’ Skip Schumaker, who will be a free agent after the season, would want to work for the White Sox, Getz is optimistic about his organization’s future.\n\n“Rewinding back to when I was hired and the focus of building something special from the ground up, those were the selling points and those were the conversations I had with outside people that have come into our organization,” Getz said “Although we’ve had a disappointing major-league season, the mission hasn’t changed. The message really hasn’t changed. We have a farm system that is rising towards the top. I think it’s a consensus top-10 farm system in the game and some have it even higher. I anticipate even adding to that as time goes on here. We’re looking to build something special.”\n\nMore White Sox coverage\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGreenberg: Pedro Grifol and the White Sox are better off without each other\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe '24 White Sox are at risk of being worse than the '62 Mets: Can they avoid infamy?\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhite Sox snap 21-game losing streak: ‘It’s just a sigh of relief’\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWho will replace Pedro Grifol as White Sox manager?\n\n(Photo of Pedro Grifol: Nuccio DiNuzzo / Getty Images)"
