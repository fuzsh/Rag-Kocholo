        "text": "The Cincinnati Reds are about to begin playing spring training games. There will be 18 games in 19 days beginning on Friday March 18th. Some teams, like the Los Angeles Angels, broadcast every single spring training game. While the Reds have had more games broadcast in recent years than in the not-so-distant-past, they still don’t have too many games available through Bally Sports Ohio. Every game will be available on the radio, either on 700 WLW or 1360 WSAI in the greater Cincinnati area.\n\nThe Spring Training TV Schedule\n\nBally Sports Ohio will broadcast 6 of the teams 18 games this spring. An additional 4 games will also be available on MLB.tv if you have that service. Here’s the breakdown of the schedule for both radio and television (as always, this is subject to change – and if it does we will do our best to update this):\n\nDate Time Opponent TV Radio 18-Mar 4:05 PM Guardians BSO 700 WLW 19-Mar 9:05 PM A’s N/A 700 WLW 20-Mar 4:05 PM Giants BSO 700 WLW 21-Mar 4:05 PM Cubs MLB.tv 1360 WSAI 22-Mar 4:05 PM Dodgers MLBNet 1360 WSAI 23-Mar 9:05 PM Brewers BSO 700 WLW 24-Mar 4:05 PM Royals N/A 1360 WSAI 25-Mar OFF OFF OFF OFF 26-Mar 4:05 PM Giants MLBNet 700 WLW 27-Mar 4:05 PM Rockies BSO 700 WLW 28-Mar 9:05 PM Cubs MLBNet 700 WLW 29-Mar 4:05 PM Rangers BSO 1360 WSAI 30-Mar 4:05 PM A’S MLB.tv 700 WLW 31-Mar 9:05 PM White Sox N/A 700 WLW 1-Apr 4:05 PM Angels BSO 1360 WSAI 2-Apr 9:05 PM Padres N/A 700 WLW 3-Apr 4:05 PM Dbacks N/A 700 WLW 4-Apr 4:05 PM Royals N/A 1360 WSAI 5-Apr 3:05 PM Mariners N/A 1360 WSAI All games on Bally Sports Ohio will also be on MLB.tv"
