Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds have extended one of the longest radio rights deals in sport until 2017.

All Reds games will continue to be broadcast live on 700 WLW, a station with 93 affiliates in nine states which has partnered the team for nearly 90 years. The first Reds broadcast was in 1924, with WLW becoming the team's flasghip radio station in 1969.

“We take great pride in delivering Cincinnati Reds programming to Reds Country on 700 WLW,” said Chuck Fredrick, market president for Clear Channel Media and Entertainment Cincinnati, WLW's parent.
