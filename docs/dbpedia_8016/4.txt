The British government has picked Pfizer Inc. over local drug giants GSK Plc and AstraZeneca Plc to supply millions of doses of its RSV shot to the UK.

Pfizer was chosen to provide over 3.5 million doses of its Abrysvo vaccine to older adults and more than 1.4 million doses to pregnant mothers to protect their babies in England and Northern Ireland over the next two years, according to a redacted contract published earlier this month.
