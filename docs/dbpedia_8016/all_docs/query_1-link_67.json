The reaction can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. It may also occur right after a XOLAIR injection or days later. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and can lead to death. Go to the nearest emergency room right away if you have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction:\n\nwheezing, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, or trouble breathing\n\nlow blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, rapid or weak heartbeat, anxiety, or feeling of “impending doom”\n\nflushing, itching, hives, or feeling warm\n\nswelling of the throat or tongue, throat tightness, hoarse voice, or trouble swallowing\n\nYour healthcare provider will monitor you closely for symptoms of an allergic reaction while you are receiving XOLAIR and for a period of time after treatment is initiated. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about getting medical treatment if you have symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nDo not receive and use XOLAIR if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the ingredients in XOLAIR.\n\nBefore receiving XOLAIR, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\n\nhave a latex allergy or any other allergies (such as seasonal allergies).

Use XOLAIR exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\n\nThe XOLAIR autoinjector (all doses) is intended for use only in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have rash; chest pain; shortness of breath; or a feeling of pins and needles or numbness of your arms or legs.\n\nFever, muscle aches, and rash.
