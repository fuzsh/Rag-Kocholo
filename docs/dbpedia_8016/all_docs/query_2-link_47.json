        "text": "Summary of safety profile\n\nChildren 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses\n\nIn Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.\n\nThe overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (> 10%).\n\nChildren 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose\n\nIn a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).\n\nThe overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 30%), headache (> 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%).\n\nAdolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses\n\nIn an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.\n\nThe overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%).\n\nParticipants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses\n\nIn Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.\n\nAt the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.\n\nThe safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.\n\nParticipants 12 years of age and older – after booster dose\n\nA subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).\n\nThe overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%).\n\nIn Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow up- period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.\n\nA subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.\n\nBooster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine\n\nIn 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-authorisation experience in individuals 5 years of age and older\n\nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1.

In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster (≤ 2.8%) dose than after primary (≤ 0.9%) doses of the vaccine.\n\nb. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare.\n\nc. Through the clinical trial safety follow-up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group.\n\nd. Adverse reaction determined post-authorisation.\n\ne. Refers to vaccinated arm.\n\nf. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose.\n\ng. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post-marketing phase.\n\nh. Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in children 5 to 11 years of age.\n\ni. Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis\n\nThe increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).\n\nTwo large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.\n\nLimited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.\n\nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via a Yellow card. Reporting forms and information can be found at https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store and include batch/Lot number if available.\n\nAlternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Comirnaty can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via www.pfizersafetyreporting.com.\n\nPlease do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.\n\nEfficacy\n\nStudy 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).\n\nEfficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses\n\nIn the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.\n\nThe population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).\n\nAt the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.\n\nThere were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).\n\nThe vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2. Vaccine efficacy – First COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2, by age subgroup – participants without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 – evaluable efficacy (7 days) population\n\nEfficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAdditionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nUpdated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.\n\nThe updated vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 3.\n\nIn the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAdditionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nEfficacy against severe COVID-19\n\nUpdated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID‑ 19.\n\nAs of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.\n\nEfficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses\n\nIn an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).\n\nUpdated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.\n\nIn the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).\n\nIn Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).\n\nThe ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67.\n\nEfficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses\n\nStudy 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.\n\nInitial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 5. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nTable 5. Vaccine efficacy – First COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2: Without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 – Phase 2/3 – Children 5 to 11 years of age evaluable efficacy population\n\nPre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.\n\nIn the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).\n\nIn Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).\n\nThe GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6. Summary of geometric mean ratio for 50% neutralising titre and difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse – comparison of children 5 to 11 years of age (Study 3) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (Study 2) – participants without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 2 – immunobridging subset – Phase 2/3 – evaluable immunogenicity population\n\nImmunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after booster dose\n\nA booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 7.\n\nTable 7. Summary of geometric mean titres – NT50 – participants without evidence of infection – phase 2/3 – immunogenicity set – 5 through 11 years of age – evaluable immunogenicity population\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nUnopened vial\n\nFrozen vial\n\n2 years when stored at -90 ° C to -60 ° C.\n\nThe vaccine will be received frozen at -90 ° C to -60 ° C. Frozen vaccine can be stored either at -90 ° C to -60 ° C or 2 ° C to 8 ° C upon receipt.\n\nWhen stored frozen at -90 ° C to -60 ° C, 10-vial packs of the vaccine can be thawed at 2 ° C to 8 ° C for 4 hours or individual vials can be thawed at room temperature (up to 30 ° C) for 30 minutes.\n\nThawed vial\n\n10 weeks storage and transportation at 2 ° C to 8 ° C within the 2-year shelf life.\n\n• Upon moving the vaccine to 2 ° C to 8 ° C storage, the updated expiry date must be written on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or discarded by the updated expiry date. The original expiry date should be crossed out.\n\n• If the vaccine is received at 2 ° C to 8 ° C it should be stored at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. The expiry date on the outer carton should have been updated to reflect the refrigerated expiry date and the original expiry date should have been crossed out.\n\nPrior to use, the unopened vials can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures between 8 ° C and 30 ° C.\n\nThawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.\n\nOnce thawed, the vaccine should not be re-frozen.\n\nHandling of temperature excursions during refrigerated storage\n\n• Stability data indicate that the unopened vial is stable for up to 10 weeks when stored at temperatures from -2 ° C to 2 ° C, and within the 10-week storage period between 2 ° C and 8 ° C.\n\n• Stability data indicate the vial can be stored for up to 24 hours at temperatures of 8 ° C to 30 ° C, including up to 12 hours following first puncture.\n\nThis information is intended to guide healthcare professionals only in case of temporary temperature excursion.\n\nDiluted medicinal product\n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 2 ° C to 30 ° C, after dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, which includes up to 6 hours transportation time. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of dilution precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately,\n\nin-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.\n\nHandling instructions prior to use\n\nComirnaty should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared dispersion.\n\n• Verify that the vial has an orange plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (children 5 to 11 years).\n\n• If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of Product Characteristics for that formulation.\n\n• If the vial is stored frozen it must be thawed prior to use. Frozen vials should be transferred to an environment of 2 ° C to 8 ° C to thaw; a 10-vial pack may take 4 hours to thaw. Ensure vials are completely thawed prior to use.\n\n• Upon moving vials to 2 ° C to 8 ° C storage, update the expiry date on the carton.\n\n• Unopened vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at 2 ° C to 8 ° C; not exceeding the printed expiry date (EXP).\n\n• Alternatively, individual frozen vials may be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30 ° C.\n\n• Prior to use, the unopened vial can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures up to 30 ° C. Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.\n\nDilution\n\n• Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature and gently invert it 10 times prior to dilution. Do not shake.\n\n• Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous particles.\n\n• The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.3 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.\n\n• Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.3 mL air into the empty diluent syringe.\n\n• Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake.\n\n• The diluted vaccine should present as a white to off-white dispersion with no particulates visible. Do not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present.\n\n• The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time.\n\n• After dilution, store at 2 ° C to 30 ° C and use within 12 hours.\n\n• Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to come to room temperature prior to use.\n\nPreparation of 0.2 mL doses\n\n• After dilution, the vial contains 2.6 mL from which 10 doses of 0.2 mL can be extracted.\n\n• Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab.\n\n• Withdraw 0.2 mL of Comirnaty for children aged 5 to 11 years.\n\nLow dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 10 doses from a single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract ten doses from a single vial.\n\n• Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine.\n\n• If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.\n\n• Discard any unused vaccine within 12 hours after dilution.\n\nDisposal\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements."
