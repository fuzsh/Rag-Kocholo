        "text": "Say it with me: Koe-mir'-na-tee.\n\nComirnaty, as it's known, is the official, brand name for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration this week gave full approval to the vaccine for people 16 and older.\n\nAs part of the approval process, the vaccine also gets its brand name approved for use in the U.S.\n\nSo, how did Pfizer and BioNTech settle on this unique moniker?\n\nBioNTech and Pfizer wanted to highlight special meaning\n\nThe naming process started early on in the vaccine's development.\n\nBrand Institute, the naming agency behind the effort, started working with BioNTech in April 2020, according to the website FiercePharma. Pfizer would later join the branding team.\n\nScott Piergrossi, Brand Institute's president of operations and communications, told FiercePharma that the goal in naming drugs is \"to overlap ideas and layer meaning into a name.\"\n\nAccording to Pfizer, the pharmaceutical companies wanted to emphasize COVID-19 immunization and the vaccine's core mRNA technology. They also wanted to encompass \"community\" and \"immunity\" into the final product.\n\nComirnaty touches all of the bases.\n\nThe name \"represents a combination of the terms COVID-19, mRNA, community, and immunity, to highlight the first authorization of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, as well as the joint global efforts that made this achievement possible with unprecedented rigor and efficiency — and with safety at the forefront — during this global pandemic,\" Pfizer and BioNTech said.\n\nWhat were some other names being considered?\n\nCovuity, RnaxCovi, Kovimerna, RNXtract were all in the running.\n\nFiercePharma said BioNTech even filed these names with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office this summer.\n\nThe internet keeps Comirnaty humble\n\nSure, Comirnaty is a lifesaving vaccine that will help end a pandemic.\n\nBut the internet doesn't care. Critics turned to Twitter to make light of the brand name shortly after it was announced.\n\nBen Wakana, a member of the White House's COVID-19 Response Team, joked: \"The correct pronunciation of Comirnaty is: \"keepz-u-out-of-the-hospital-saves-UR-life-protects-your-community.\"\n\nIt could be worse.\n\nAlexander Gaffney, executive director of Politico's AgencyIQ, noted it's not that bad. He tweeted that there have been some other cumbersome drug names that have come out just this year: Bylvay, Truseltiq, Zynlonta, Qelbree. Take your pick.\n\nGaffney joked that those names \"look like some drug executive was trying to make a name using the letters from a bad hand of Scrabble.\"\n\nWhat's Moderna's vaccine going to be called?\n\nSpikevax, according to the European Medicines Agency.\n\nModerna still awaits full FDA approval for its COVID-19 vaccine."
