        "text": "Introduction\n\nMeningococcal disease is a life-threatening invasive infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine administration of a single dose of quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) to persons at age 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. ACIP recommends a 2-dose serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series for persons aged 16–23 years, based on shared clinical decision-making, to provide short-term protection against meningococcal disease caused by most serogroup B strains (1). ACIP also recommends routine vaccination with MenACWY (for persons aged ≥2 months) and MenB (for persons aged ≥10 years) who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease caused by the serogroups covered by each vaccine (Box) (1).\n\nIn October 2023, a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp [Penbraya, Pfizer Inc.]) was licensed for use in persons aged 10–25 years (2). MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp contains the same components as those in two existing meningococcal vaccines: 1) N. meningitidis polysaccharide groups A, C, W, and Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier protein (MenACWY-TT* [Nimenrix, Pfizer Inc.], a non–U.S.-licensed vaccine), and 2) two recombinant lipidated factor H–binding protein (FHbp) variants from N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB-FHbp [Trumenba, Pfizer Inc.]). This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides clinical guidance for the use of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp.\n\nSummary of Evidence for Use of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp in Persons Aged ≥10 Years\n\nSafety and Immunogenicity\n\nThe body of evidence comprised data from three randomized, quadruple-blinded multisite¶ clinical trials that assessed immunogenicity and safety** among healthy participants aged 10–25 years. Participants were randomized to 1) the pentavalent group (2 doses of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp, administered 6 or 12 months apart††) or 2) the control group (MenACWY-CRM [Menveo, GSK, 1 dose] + MenB-FHbp [2 doses administered 6 months apart]) (4). The trials included ACWY-naive and ACWY-primed participants; all study participants were MenB-naive. The GRADE assessment focused on the 6-month pentavalent dosing interval for immunity outcomes; data on both 6- and 12-month pentavalent dosing intervals were assessed for safety outcomes.\n\nShort-Term Immunity\n\nAmong both MenACWY-naive and MenACWY-primed participants, seroresponse§§ for serogroups A, C, W, and Y 1 month after the first trial dose of ACWY-containing vaccine was achieved as often or more often in the pentavalent group than in the control group. On the basis of a composite measure, seroresponse for serogroup B 1 month after the second dose of serogroup B–containing vaccine was achieved more often in the pentavalent group than in the control group. The overall level of certainty for the critical outcome short-term immunity for all serogroups was moderate for healthy persons and low for persons at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions.\n\nPersistent Immunity\n\nAmong ACWY-naive and ACWY-primed participants, seroprotection¶¶ for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y occurred as often or more often in the pentavalent group (48 months after receipt of 2 doses MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp) compared with the control group (54 months after 1 dose MenACWY-CRM). Little or no difference was observed in the frequency of serogroup B strain–specific seroprotection*** 48 months after receipt of 2 doses of pentavalent vaccine when compared with those seen 48 months after receipt of 2 doses of MenB-FHbp + 1 dose MenACWY-CRM. The overall level of certainty for this important outcome was low for serogroups A, C, W, and Y for healthy persons, moderate for serogroup B for healthy persons, and low for all serogroups for those at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions.\n\nAdverse Events\n\nThe proportion of participants who experienced serious adverse events††† was similar in the pentavalent group (0.6%) and the control group (0.5%; p = 0.7). No serious adverse events were deemed related to the vaccine by the study investigators. The pentavalent group had significantly fewer nonserious adverse events§§§ (24.6%) than did the control group (32.5%; p<0.001). The most common solicited adverse events within 7 days after receipt of either trial dose of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp were injection site pain (84.4%–89.3%; mostly mild or moderate), fatigue (47.6%–52.1%; mostly mild or moderate), and headache (39.8%–46.8%; mostly mild or moderate) (5). For both serious and nonserious adverse events, the level of certainty was low for healthy persons and very low for those at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions.\n\nCoadministration with Other Vaccines\n\nNo data exist on coadministration of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp with other vaccines. Review of the interactions sections of the package inserts for the component vaccines Nimenrix (MenACWY-TT) and Trumenba (MenB-FHbp) did not identify any concerns for coadministration with other vaccines (6,7).\n\nResource Use\n\nFindings from two economic models (CDC model and Pfizer Inc. model) that assessed the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp for each policy question within the routine schedule were considered by ACIP (8). According to the CDC model, strategies likely to be societally cost-saving would use the pentavalent vaccine to 1) replace a single dose of MenACWY and MenB when both are indicated, or 2) replace MenACWY and MenB when both are indicated, followed by completion of the 2-dose MenB series with a second dose of pentavalent vaccine. The CDC model also illustrated that when immunization against serogroup B meningococcal disease is not indicated, replacing both doses of MenACWY with the pentavalent vaccine would be incrementally less cost-effective. Despite differences in input values and assumptions, similar conclusions were reported by the Pfizer Inc. model.\n\nClinical Guidance\n\nShared Clinical Decision-Making for MenB\n\nFor healthy persons, use of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp should not supersede discussion of whether to administer MenB using shared clinical decision-making (Table). Clinicians should refer to previously published considerations for shared clinical decision-making and timing of MenB administration (1).\n\nInterchangeability of Vaccine Products\n\nMenACWY products are interchangeable; the same vaccine product is recommended, but not required, for all doses (1). Different manufacturers’ MenB products are not interchangeable; administration of a B-component vaccine (monovalent or pentavalent) requires that all subsequent B-component vaccine doses, including booster doses, be from the same manufacturer. If one MenB dose was received but the vaccine manufacturer is not known, the series must be restarted with any licensed product to ensure completion of the MenB series using products from a single manufacturer.\n\nIf MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp is inadvertently administered in lieu of MenACWY or MenB when only one (i.e., MenACWY or MenB) was indicated, the dose can be considered valid if it would otherwise have been a valid dose of MenACWY or MenB (i.e., on the basis of indication, patient age, and dosing interval).\n\nDosing Intervals\n\nThe licensed dosing interval for MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp is 6 months. Data are not available regarding safety or immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp with dosing intervals exceeding 12 months. Healthy adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years who receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp on the basis of shared clinical decision-making should complete the MenB series with a dose of MenB-FHbp 6 months after the pentavalent vaccine dose was administered (Table).\n\nPersons at increased risk for meningococcal disease who receive a dose of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp and are recommended to receive additional doses of MenACWY and MenB <6 months after a dose of pentavalent meningococcal vaccine should receive separate MenACWY and MenB-FHbp vaccines rather than MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp (Figure). MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp may be used for booster doses in persons who remain at increased risk if a booster dose of both MenACWY and MenB are indicated at the same visit. MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp doses deviating from the licensed 6-month interval can be considered valid for MenACWY or MenB if the timing would otherwise have been valid for that component.\n\nContraindications and Precautions\n\nSevere allergy. MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp is contraindicated for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any component of the vaccine or to a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine.\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding. No data exist on use of MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Because limited data are available for MenB vaccination during pregnancy, vaccination with MenB should be deferred unless the pregnant person is at increased risk for acquiring meningococcal disease, and, after consultation with their health care provider, the benefits of vaccination are considered to outweigh the potential risks. When MenACWY is indicated, persons who are pregnant or breastfeeding should receive MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-TT (MenQuadfi, Sanofi Pasteur).\n\nReporting of Vaccine Adverse Events\n\nAdverse events that occur in a patient after meningococcal vaccination should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Instructions for reporting to VAERS are available online at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html or by telephone (800-822-7967)."
