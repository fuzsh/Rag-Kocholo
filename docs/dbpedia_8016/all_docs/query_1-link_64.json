        "text": "Overview\n\nA Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) review of the evidence for benefits and harms for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was presented to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) on August 30, 2021. GRADE evidence type indicates the certainty of estimates from the available body of evidence. Evidence certainty ranges from type 1 (high certainty) to type 4 (very low certainty) [1].\n\nThe policy question was, “Should vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (2-doses, IM) be recommended for persons 16 years of age and older?” The potential benefits pre-specified by the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group included prevention of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (critical), hospitalization due to COVID-19 (critical), death due to COVID-19 (important) and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, assessed using PCR (important). The two pre-specified harms were serious adverse events (SAEs) (including myocarditis and anaphylaxis) (critical) and reactogenicity (severe, grade ≥3) (important).\n\nA systematic review of evidence on the benefits and harms of a two-dose regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥16 years was conducted, based on data available as of August 23, 2021. The evidence from one Phase I randomized controlled trial (RCT) [2], one Phase II/III RCT [3,4,5], 26 vaccine effectiveness studies [6-31], and two vaccine safety surveillance systems [32,33,34] were assessed using a modified GRADE approach [1]. Pooled efficacy and effectiveness estimates were calculated when multiple sources had data on an outcome.\n\nIn terms of benefits, the available data from RCTs demonstrated that, compared with placebo, vaccination was associated with a lower risk of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (relative risk [RR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.11; evidence type 1), hospitalization due to COVID-19 (RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00–0.12; evidence type 2), and death due to COVID-19 (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02–1.39; evidence type 2). The certainty of estimates regarding hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 was reduced due to imprecision.\n\nThe pooled vaccine effectiveness estimates from observational studies were consistent with these findings. Compared with no vaccination, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.05–0.13; evidence type 2), hospitalization (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03–0.12; evidence type 2), and death due to COVID-19 (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02–0.09; evidence type 2). The certainty of each of these estimates was increased for a strong association. Vaccination was also associated with a decreased risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.10–0.12; evidence type 4); the evidence certainty type was downgraded for inconsistency.\n\nIn terms of harms, the available data from RCTs indicated that serious adverse events were balanced between the vaccine and placebo arms (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18, evidence type 2), and two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination among more than 22,000 persons vaccinated. The certainty of this estimate was reduced due to imprecision. Reactogenicity grade ≥3 was associated with vaccination (RR 4.69; 95% CI 3.83–5.73, evidence type 1). About 11% of vaccine recipients versus 2% of placebo recipients reported grade ≥3 reactions. Two rare but serious adverse events, anaphylaxis and myocarditis, have been associated with vaccination in post-authorization safety surveillance (see results section and Table 3e).\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (COMIRNATY®) for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals aged ≥16 years [35]. As part of the process employed by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a systematic review and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment of the evidence for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was conducted and presented to ACIP [1]. There were no conflicts of interest reported by CDC and ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group members involved in the GRADE analysis.\n\nACIP adopted a modified GRADE approach in 2010 as the framework for evaluating the scientific evidence that informs recommendations for vaccine use. ACIP has made modifications to the GRADE approach by presenting assessed evidence as type 1, 2, 3, and 4, which corresponds to high, moderate, low, and very low certainty, whereas standard GRADE has high as level 4 and very low as level 1. Additionally, instead of presenting the overall certainty of evidence across all outcomes, ACIP presents the certainty of evidence for the benefits and harms separately. ACIP includes an option “ACIP recommends the intervention for individuals based on shared clinical decision-making” instead of providing a conditional recommendation for or against an intervention. GRADE was used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-dose regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥16 years. Evidence of benefits and harms were reviewed based on the modified GRADE approach [1].\n\nThe policy question was, “Should vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (2-doses, IM) be recommended for persons 16 years of age and older?” (Table 1).\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a systematic review of evidence on the benefits and harms of a two-dose regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (see Appendix 2 for databases and search strategies). We assessed outcomes and evaluated the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Patient-important outcomes (including benefits and harms) for assessment were selected by the Work Group during Work Group calls and via online surveys where members were asked to rate and rank the importance of relevant outcomes.\n\nWe identified RCTs through clinicaltrials.gov. Relevant Phase I, II, or III RCTs of COVID-19 vaccine were included if they: 1) involved human subjects; 2) reported primary data; 3) included adults (aged ≥16 years) at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 4) included data relevant to the efficacy and safety outcomes being measured; 5) included data for the dosage being recommended (30 μg, 2 doses at 0 and 21 days). We identified relevant observational studies through an ongoing systematic review conducted by the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) [36]. Relevant observational studies, using case-control, test-negative, or cohort designs, were restricted to the defined population, intervention, comparison, and outcome outlined in the policy question. Outcomes were assessed starting at least 7 days after 2nd dose. We included only 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine effectiveness estimates, with combined mRNA vaccine effectiveness estimates excluded. We included studies of general populations and special populations. In addition, efforts were made to obtain unpublished and other relevant data by hand-searching reference lists, and consulting with vaccine manufacturers and subject matter experts. We included observational safety data from two vaccine safety surveillance systems based on input from ACIP’s COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group: Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Characteristics of all included studies and surveillance systems are shown in Appendix 1. [2-34]\n\nTwo reviewers evaluated all studies for study limitations (risk of bias) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies. RoB comprises a series of questions structured into domains focusing on different aspects of trial design, conduct, and reporting. Based on question responses, judgement can be “low”, “moderate”, or “high” risk of bias. NOS is a 9-point scale which assesses study limitations related to participant selection and comparability, and assessment of outcome (cohort studies) or ascertainment of exposure (case-control studies). Studies with NOS scores <7 were considered to have serious study limitations.\n\nFrom the RCT data, relative risks (RR) were calculated from numerators and denominators available in the body of evidence. Vaccine efficacy estimates were defined as 100% x (1-RR). Vaccine effectiveness estimates and 95% CIs were taken from the published/preprint studies, as defined by the authors using a variety of study designs and analytical approaches; adjusted estimates were used when available. When multiple studies were available, pooled estimates were calculated using random effects (>3 studies) or fixed effects (≤2 studies) meta-analysis (R meta package). When multiple studies provided estimates based on overlapping study populations, the study with the most comprehensive population and follow-up time was selected for inclusion in the pooled estimate. Because there was a relatively large body of evidence from vaccine effectiveness studies, with many available only in the preprint literature, an a priori decision was made to exclude studies judged to have serious study limitations from the main pooled estimate used for GRADE. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of study characteristics (e.g., special populations vs. full population, preprint vs. peer-reviewed, standard vs. extended dosing interval, cohort vs. case-control/test-negative study design, study limitations, and circulating variants). The evidence certainty assessment for randomized and observational studies addressed risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other characteristics. The GRADE assessment across the body of evidence for each outcome was presented in an evidence profile.\n\nResults\n\nThe results of the GRADE assessment were presented to ACIP on August 30, 2021.\n\nOutcomes of interest included individual benefits and harms. Indirect effects of vaccination (e.g., societal benefits) were not considered as part of GRADE. Benefits of interest deemed critical were prevention of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and prevention of hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Table 2). Other important benefits included prevention of death due to COVID-19 and prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The critical harm of interest was serious adverse events (SAEs), including myocarditis and anaphylaxis; reactogenicity grade ≥3 was deemed an important harm.\n\nAfter screening 86 records, 45 were excluded from full-text review because they were a different study design (i.e. screening method, n=2), a different intervention (e.g., a different vaccine or a different dose, n=28), or a different outcome that did not directly align with the PICO outcomes (e.g., any infection instead of symptomatic COVID-19 or asymptomatic infection, n=15). Of the 41 records that were deemed eligible for full-text review, 1 was excluded for not having primary data, 4 were excluded because they assessed a different intervention, and 4 were excluded because they assessed a different outcome. The remaining 33 records, which reported data on 29 studies or surveillance systems, were included in the evidence synthesis and GRADE evidence assessment (Appendix 1) [2-34]. Data were reviewed from four RCT records, including one publication from a Phase I trial, one publication and one preprint from the same Phase II/III trial, and additional data provided by the sponsor [2-5]. Data were reviewed from 26 vaccine effectiveness studies [6-31]. Two vaccine safety surveillance systems, VSD and VAERS, included data for SAEs [32,33,34].\n\nIn the Phase II/III RCT, using data on all blinded follow-up (up to 6 months or the unblinding date of March 13, 2021), the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced symptomatic COVID-19 when compared to placebo (vaccine efficacy: 91.1% (95% CI 88.8–93.1%)) (Table 3a). For hospitalization due to COVID-19, 31 events occurred, all in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was 100% (95% CI 87.6–100%) (Table 3b). Deaths due to COVID-19 were uncommon, one in the vaccine group and six in the placebo group (83% (-39–98%)) (Table 3c). Numbers of SAEs were comparable between the vaccine group and the placebo group across the two RCTs (Phase II/III: 268/21,926 (1.2%) vs. 268/21,921 (1.2%); Phase I: 1/24 (4.2%) vs. 0/6 (0.0%)); there were no cases of vaccine-associated enhanced disease or vaccine-related deaths (Table 3e). Grade ≥3 reactions generally were not uncommon and occurred more frequently in the vaccine than placebo groups (Table 3f).\n\nSeventeen vaccine effectiveness studies reported data on symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (Table 3a), 13 reported data on hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Table 3b), 6 reported data on death due to COVID-19 (Table 3c), and 5 reported data on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3d). The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimates from the observational studies demonstrated that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced symptomatic COVID-19 when compared to no vaccination (pooled vaccine effectiveness: 92.4% (95% CI: 87.5–95.3%), based on 8 studies) [6,10,11,14,17,18,21,31]. The pooled vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was 94.3% (95% CI 87.9–97.3%), based on 8 studies [13,15,17,21,22,25,28,30]. The pooled vaccine effectiveness for prevention of death due to COVID-19 was 96.1% (95%CI 91.5–98.2%), based on 4 studies [13,15,17,25]. The pooled vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 89.3% (95% CI 88.4–90.1%), based on 2 studies [17,24].\n\nObservational data on serious adverse events were reviewed. A rapid cycle analysis from VSD evaluated chart-reviewed cases of myocarditis occurring among persons aged 18–39 years following dose 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Table 3e) [34]. The rates of myocarditis were 368 per million person-years (9/24,432) in the 0–7-day risk interval and 48 per million person-years (3/62,481) in vaccinated comparators (adjusted rate ratio: 9.1 (95%CI 2.1–48.6)). Data from VAERS showed an elevated ratio of observed to expected myocarditis cases in the 7-day interval following vaccination among females in age groups 16–24 years and among males in age groups 16–49 years, with higher observed/expected ratios in males than females [33]. A rapid cycle analysis of data from VSD evaluated chart-reviewed cases of anaphylaxis among all vaccinated persons aged ≥12 years. Based on events occurring in a 0–1 day risk interval after vaccination, the estimated incidence of confirmed anaphylaxis was 5.0 (95% CI 3.5–6.9) per million doses [34]. The absolute reporting rate to VAERS was 4.7 per million doses administered [32].\n\nGRADE Summary\n\nThe initial GRADE evidence level was type 1 (high) for randomized controlled trials and type 3 (low) for the observational data (Table 4). In terms of benefits, the RCT data indicate that the vaccine reduces the risk of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and no serious concerns impacting certainty were identified for this outcome (type 1, high). Observational data for symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 indicated a similar risk reduction with vaccination, and the certainty was upgraded one point for a strong association (type 2, moderate). The certainty of the evidence from RCTs for hospitalization due to COVID-19 was downgraded one point for serious concern of imprecision (type 2, moderate). Observational data for hospitalization due to COVID-19 indicated a similar risk reduction with vaccination, and the certainty was upgraded one point for a strong association (type 2, moderate). The certainty of the evidence for death due to COVID-19 was downgraded one point for serious concern of imprecision (type 2, moderate). Observational data for death due to COVID-19 concurred with a strong risk reduction with vaccination, and the certainty was upgraded one point for a strong association (type 2, moderate). The body of evidence for prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection came from observational studies and was downgraded one point for serious concern for inconsistency (type 4, very low). The certainty of evidence for serious adverse events was downgraded one point for serious concern of imprecision related to sample size (type 2, moderate). Observational data on specific serious adverse events (i.e., myocarditis among persons aged 18–39 years and anaphylaxis among persons aged 12 years and older) demonstrated these events are rare (evidence type 3, low). No serious concerns impacted the certainty of estimates of reactogenicity from RCTs (type 1, high).\n\nThe summary of evidence types is shown in Table 5. The final evidence types were type 1 for symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, type 2 for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and death due to COVID-19, type 4 for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, type 2 for serious adverse events, and type 1 for reactogenicity.\n\nReferences\n\nAhmed F.

Although participants and study staff were blinded to intervention assignments, they may have inferred receipt of vaccine or placebo based on reactogenicity. This was deemed unlikely to overestimate efficacy or underestimate risk of serious adverse events, therefore the risk of bias was rated as not serious.\n\nThe RCT excluded persons with prior COVID-19 diagnosis, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and persons who were immunocompromised. The population included in the RCT may not represent all persons aged >=16 years.\n\nAbsolute risk was calculated using the observed risk among placebo recipients in the available body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. Absolute risk estimates should be interpreted in this context.\n\n17 studies were available in the body of evidence. 8 were excluded because the study population was already represented, and 1 was excluded due to serious study limitations.\n\nThe body of evidence includes preprints.\n\nAlthough I2 value was high (95.0%), no serious concern for inconsistency was judged because all studies showed a high degree of vaccine effectiveness, with point estimates ranging from 87% to 97%. In a sensitivity analysis including results from one study with study limitations identified that had a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 56%, the pooled RR was 0.10 (95% CI 0.05–0.18), and I2 was 98.1%.\n\nData on numerators and denominators were not consistently reported in the available body of evidence. The n shown excludes events from studies that did not report the number of cases. The N is not included because studies variously provided person-time or number of persons. In addition to the numerators from cohort studies shown, the body of evidence included at least 85 cases and 54,603 controls from case-control or test-negative studies.\n\nPooled RR based on a random effects meta-analysis, using adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates on a log scale.\n\nRisk of bias was considered due to concern about misclassification of outcome. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 is not specified in the study protocol, and the data shown include only persons who met the protocol definition of COVID-19 using an approved assay or confirmation in a central laboratory; it was unclear if constructing a non-protocol measure may have resulted in bias. Data on all hospitalizations due to COVID-19 diagnosed by any assay after dose 1 were also obtained and reviewed. Two hospitalizations due to COVID-19 occurred among 21,909 persons in the vaccine arm and 59 occurred among 21,908 persons in the placebo arm (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01–0.14); the similar efficacy diminished concerns regarding risk of bias.\n\nSerious concerns of imprecision due to fragility in the estimate was present because there were only 31 events observed from a single RCT.\n\nRR calculated using a standard continuity correction of 0.5.\n\n13 studies were available in the body of evidence. 5 were excluded because the study population was already represented.\n\nAlthough I2 value was high (91.7%), no serious concern for inconsistency was judged because all studies showed a high degree of vaccine effectiveness, with point estimates ranging from 84% to 99%.\n\nDefinitions varied by study. Indirectness was considered given COVID-19 was not necessarily confirmed as the cause of hospitalizations, but this was deemed not serious.\n\nData on numerators and denominators were not consistently reported in the available body of evidence. The n shown excludes events from studies that did not report the number of cases. The N is not included because studies variously provided person-time or number of persons. In addition to the numerators from cohort studies shown, the body of evidence included at least 95 cases and 1,359 controls from case-control or test-negative studies.\n\nRisk of bias was considered due to possible misclassification of outcomes. One death in a vaccine recipient and 3 deaths among placebo recipients were in persons who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 based on local clinical nucleic acid amplification tests that were not protocol approved; these diagnoses were not confirmed by the central study laboratory and were not counted in the efficacy estimates for symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or hospitalization due to COVID-19. In an analysis using only protocol approved or central laboratory confirmed cases resulting in death, with a standard continuity correction applied, the relative risk was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01–2.77).\n\nSerious concern for imprecision was present due to the small number of events that were observed. In addition to a 95% confidence interval crossing the line of no effect, there was concern for fragility in the estimate due to the small number of events.\n\nCalculated risk among placebo arm in available body of evidence from RCT was 0.03%, but it appears lower here due to rounding.\n\n6 studies were available in the body of evidence. 2 were excluded because the study population was already represented.\n\nThe relative risk shown is from a pooled analysis of 4 cohort studies conducted in different populations. I2 was 48.8%.\n\nDefinitions varied by study. Indirectness was considered given COVID-19 was not necessarily confirmed as the cause of deaths, but this was deemed not serious.\n\nData on numerators and denominators were not consistently reported in the available body of evidence. The n shown excludes events from studies that did not report the number of cases. The N is not included because the type of denominator varied across studies (e.g., person-time or number of persons).\n\n5 studies were available in the body of evidence. 2 were excluded because the study population was already represented, and one study was excluded due to study limitations.\n\nSerious concern for inconsistency was present (I2 = 98.1%). The magnitude of the relative risks from the two studies in the body of evidence varied widely, possibly reflecting different prevalence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants at the time of data collection or differences in study methods. In a sensitivity analysis including results from one study with study limitations identified that had a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 35.9%, the pooled RR was 0.12% (95% CI 0.11–0.13), and I2 was 99.1%.\n\nPooled RR based on a fixed effects meta-analysis, using adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates on a log scale. Fixed effects model was used for this analysis due to imprecise estimates of the between-studies variance.\n\nAbsolute risk was calculated using the observed risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among placebo recipients in the available body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. Absolute risk estimates should be interpreted in this context.\n\nRisk of bias related to blinding of participants was present. Although participants and study staff were blinded to intervention assignments, they may have inferred receipt of vaccine or placebo based on reactogenicity. Some reactogenicity outcomes may also have been reported as serious adverse events, and experiences of reactions immediately after vaccination could have influenced recall or reporting of subsequent serious adverse events. This was rated as not serious.\n\nSerious concern for imprecision was present. The confidence interval indicates that both reduced and increased risk of serious adverse events are possible.\n\nPooled RR based on a fixed effects meta-analysis. Fixed effects model was appropriate for this analysis because these RCTs used the same protocol and were conducted in similar populations.\n\nA rapid cycle analysis from Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) evaluated chart-reviewed cases of myocarditis among persons aged 18–39 years, following dose 2. Based on events occurring in a 7-day risk interval after vaccination vs. a comparison interval in vaccinated individuals, the adjusted rate ratio was 9.1% (95% CI 2.1–48.6). The rates of myocarditis were 368 per 1 million person-years (9/24,432) in the 0–7 day risk interval and 48 per 1 million person-years (3/62,481) in vaccinated comparators.\n\nData from the national Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) showed an elevated ratio of observed to expected myocarditis cases in the 7-day interval following vaccination among females in age groups 16–24 years, and among males in age groups 16–49 years, with higher observed/expected ratios in males than females. Although VAERS data are subject to the limitations of a passive surveillance system, the elevated risk of myocarditis following Pfizer vaccination is consistent with that observed in VSD.\n\nA rapid cycle analysis of data from VSD evaluated chart-reviewed cases of anaphylaxis among all vaccinated persons aged 12 and older. Based on events occurring in a 0-1 day risk interval after vaccination, the estimated incidence of confirmed anaphylaxis was 5.0 (95% CI 3.5-6.9) per million doses. The absolute reported rate to VAERS was 4.7 per million doses administered.\n\nTable 5: Summary of Evidence for Outcomes of Interest\n\nSummary of Evidence for Outcomes of Interest Outcome Importance Included in profile Certainty Symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 Critical Yes Type 1 (high) Hospitalization due to COVID-19 Critical Yes Type 2 (moderate) Death due to COVID-19 Important Yes Type 2 (moderate) Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection Important Yes Type 4 (very low) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (including myocarditis and anaphylaxis) Critical Yes Type 2 (moderate) Reactogenicity (proportion with grade 3 or worse reactions) Important Yes Type 1 (high)\n\nAppendix 1.
