        "text": "The spring campaign offering an NHS Covid booster jab to the most vulnerable across the UK closed on 30 June.\n\nMany pharmacies have started selling the jab privately.\n\nAt the moment almost no one can get an NHS Covid jab.\n\nIn line with current advice from the government's vaccine advisers, the JCVI and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), someone aged over six months with a weakened immune system would be eligible for a vaccine or booster, if their doctor thought it was clinically necessary.\n\nNo details have yet been released about whether there will be an autumn booster campaign, or who would be eligible.\n\nThose at highest risk were invited first.\n\nThe NHS sent texts, emails, NHS App messages or letters to those who were eligible.\n\nAppointments could also be booked directly via the NHS App, external, the NHS website, external, GPs, or local pharmacies, by calling 119, external, or by visiting a drop-in clinic., external\n\nOn 20 June, NHS England said more than four million people had received a spring booster jab, external.\n\nVaccines from four different companies are in use across the UK: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Sanofi/GSK and Novavax.\n\nThe NHS spring booster campaign used mRNA vaccines made by either Pfizer or Moderna. Both have been updated to help protect against more recent strains of Covid.\n\nPeople were advised to take whichever they were offered, as all provide protection against severe illness or death.\n\nAstraZeneca withdrew its Covid vaccine worldwide because of the surplus of updated vaccines from its competitors.\n\nAt the firm's request, in May 2024, the European Medicines Authority withdrew authorisation for the vaccine,, external which is no longer being manufactured or supplied.\n\nA number of High Street chemists and private clinics have started selling and administering the Pfizer Covid vaccine directly to the public.\n\nThe cost varies from about Â£45 to Â£99.\n\nYou need to be aged 12 or above, and must not have had a Covid vaccine in the previous three months. You also need to talk to a health professional to check that it is suitable.\n\nA protein-based booster vaccine made by Novavax, which works differently to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, should also be available to buy soon.\n\nModerna is hoping to launch a combined flu and Covid vaccine in 2025 or 2026, after the jab passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checks in June 2024.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid.\n\nVery rarely myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - has been linked to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nIt has also been listed as a rare possible side effect of the Novavax vaccine, after a very small number of cases were reported during clinical trials.\n\nThere have also been extremely rare, but occasionally fatal,, external cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nA very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction, external after the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nPatients with serious allergies should talk to their healthcare professional before being vaccinated."
