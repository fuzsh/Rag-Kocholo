We have made recent enhancements to the MSCI Implied Temperature Rise Model, read the summary of the enhancements here.\n\nIf the company you search for does not appear but is in our MSCI ESG Research coverage universe, this means that it is not in the MSCI ACWI Index at this time.\n\nMSCI ESG Methodologies\n\nThis information is subject MSCI Inc’s and MSCI ESG Research LLC’s terms of use that you can find here: https://www.msci.com/terms-of-use and here additional-terms-of-use-msci-esg-research-llc\n\nThis information may not be used for corporate financing purposes (including, without limitation, ESG-linked loans, credit facilities, securities or structured products), as a basis for any financial instruments or products (including, without limitation, passively managed funds and index-linked derivative securities) or other products or services, to manage any funds or portfolios, to verify or correct data in any other compilation of data or index, to create any derivative works, nor to create any other data or index (custom or otherwise), without MSCI's prior written permission.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nPlease contact use if you would like to learn more about how we can help you integrate ESG and Climate insights into your investment process.\n\nContact Us"
