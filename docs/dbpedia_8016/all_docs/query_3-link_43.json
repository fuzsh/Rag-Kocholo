It is important treatment starts within five days of a positive test.\n\nMost people who have conditions that put them in the highest risk category will have been contacted directly with information about how to get these treatments, if needed.\n\nTreatments for Covid-19 are for people aged 12 and over who:\n\nare at highest risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19\n\nhave symptoms of Covid-19 that started within the last five days\n\nhave tested positive for Covid-19 by PCR or LFT within the last five days.\n\nIf you think you're in the highest risk group and need to access Covid-19 treatment, follow these steps to be considered for a referral.\n\nKeep rapid lateral flow tests at home.\n\nIf you're eligible for Covid-19 treatment, you should keep rapid lateral flow tests at home.\n\nYou may be able to pick up free rapid lateral flow test kits from your local pharmacy if you're eligible for treatment.\n\nThe pharmacy may ask you questions about your medical history to confirm you’re eligible for free tests. If you have a copy of a letter or email sent to you by the NHS that says you’re eligible for Covid-19 treatment, take this with you. A letter or email is not essential, but it will help the pharmacy to confirm you’re eligible for free tests more easily.\n\nSomeone else can collect free tests on your behalf, for example, a friend, relative or carer. If you do not have a friend, relative or carer who can collect your tests for you, you may be able to book a volunteer responder by calling 0808 196 3646.\n\nAnyone collecting free tests on your behalf needs to give the pharmacy your details, including your:\n\nFull name\n\nAddress\n\nDate of birth\n\nNHS number (if available)\n\nMedical condition(s) to confirm your eligibility\n\nThey should also bring any copies of letters or emails that have been sent to you by the NHS about Covid-19 treatments.\n\nTake a rapid lateral flow test if you get symptoms\n\nIf you have any symptoms of Covid-19, take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible, even if your symptoms are mild.

Treatments for Covid-19 need to be given quickly after your symptoms start to be effective.\n\nIf you’re prescribed capsules or tablets, the medicine can be collected on your behalf by someone else, such as a friend or relative. You’ll be advised where the medicine can be collected from. Alternatively, the NHS may be able to arrange for the medicine to be delivered to you.\n\nIf the treatment needs to be given as a drip in your arm (infusion), you'll usually get it at your local hospital or in a local health centre.\n\nYou'll get instructions on where to get the treatment and how to get there and back safely.\n\nIf your test is negative, do a total of three tests over three days\n\nIf your test result is negative, but you still have symptoms of Covid-19, you need to do a total of three rapid lateral flow tests over three days.\n\nFor example, if you did your first test today, you should do a second test tomorrow and a third test the day after.\n\nIf any test result is positive, you can stop testing and call your GP surgery, NHS 111 or hospital specialist as soon as possible."
