        "text": "COVID-19 Vaccine Development and Authorization\n\nThe federal government has been working since the pandemic started to develop, manufacture, and distribute safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nYears before the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists were already studying coronaviruses to find out how to protect against them. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers were able to come up with vaccines for this new virus much faster because of work that was already happening.\n\nFDA Authorization\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews and evaluates COVID-19 vaccines for quality, safety, and effectiveness. The FDA then issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain vaccines that meet rigorous, science-based standards. The FDA determines that these vaccines are safe and effective for public use.\n\nCDC Recommendation\n\nAfter the FDA authorizes the emergency use of a vaccine, an independent panel of medical and health experts called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides recommendations and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the use of the vaccine.\n\nFDA Approval\n\nWhen the FDA approves a vaccine, it must undergo the agency's standard approval process for reviewing the quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research conducts an analysis of the benefits and risks to ensure the vaccine meets the FDA's standards for approval.\n\nEquitable Access to COVID-19 Vaccines\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, each state, tribe, and territory received allocations of vaccines and developed its own plan for distributing vaccines to people in their jurisdiction.\n\nVaccinations in the United States began on December 14, 2020.\n\nTo ensure the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the federal government stood up programs to reach high-risk communities directly and quickly.\n\nThe Federal Retail Pharmacy Program sent doses to 21 pharmacy partners with over 40,000 activated stores, 40% of which are located in high-risk zip codes.\n\nThe Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program allocated doses directly to community-based health centers who signed up to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccines. The program was open to more than 1,400 health centers nationwide. Over 91% of these health center patients were individuals or families living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n\nThe Rural Health Clinic COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution (RHCVD) Program distributed doses directly to Rural Health Clinics in medically-underserved rural communities.\n\nTribal health programs and Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) decided to receive vaccines either through the Indian Health Service (IHS) or through the State. To better understand the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native, HHS initiated tribal consultation in September 2020 to seek input from tribal leaders on COVID-19 vaccination planning for Indian Country.\n\nVaccine Data\n\nThe CDCâ€™s COVID Data Tracker shows the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in the United States."
