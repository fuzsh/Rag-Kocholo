        "text": "Safety Information\n\nAlert communication\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis â rare adverse reactions to Comirnaty (Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine)\n\n21 July 2021\n\nOn 9 June 2021 we published a Monitoring Communication on a safety signal of myocarditis with Comirnaty vaccine. It has now been concluded by Medsafe, other national regulators (such as the FDA) and the company, Pfizer, that myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) is a rare side effect of vaccination with Comirnaty. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), the warning will relate to both conditions. This information will be added to the data sheet very shortly.\n\nThe wording will be similar to the update recently made in the United Kingdom:\n\nThere have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Comirnaty often in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest.\n\nHealthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinated individuals should also seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias. 1\n\nMyocarditis has also been seen in relation to COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe benefits of vaccination with Comirnaty continue to outweigh the risk of experiencing a side effect for people of all ages in the approved indication. 2\n\nAdvice for consumers and caregivers\n\nInformation for healthcare professionals\n\nProduct affected\n\nFurther information\n\nUseful links\n\nAdvice for consumers and caregivers\n\nIn the first few days after your vaccination seek medical attention if you experience new onset chest pain, shortness of breath or an abnormal heartbeat. These are potential signs of myocarditis.\n\nMyocarditis has affected less than one person in a million people who have had Comirnaty vaccine in the European Union countries.3 In most cases the myocarditis was mild and is not expected to have any long-term effects.\n\nComirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in protecting people from COVID-19 infection, which can also cause myocarditis\n\nPlease report any adverse event following immunisation with COVID-19 vaccine to CARM\n\nInformation for healthcare professionals\n\nMyocarditis has been determined to be a rare side effect (less than 1 in a million overall3) to vaccination with Comirnaty. This information will be added to the data sheet very shortly.\n\nBe alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in people after vaccination.\n\nVaccinated individuals should be advised to seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias.\n\nThere is no contraindication or change to the vaccination schedule required for the first or second dose of the vaccine for anyone who has experienced myocarditis in the data sheet update. However, a decision to vaccinate should be made with the individual after full consideration of their circumstances.\n\nGlobally, the rate appears to be highest in younger men (aged 18-24 years) and after the second dose. The rate estimated from confirmed cases in health databases in the USA was 8 per million for 12-39 year olds after dose 2 (the estimated rate with the Moderna vaccine was higher in this analysis).4 Myocarditis occurred mostly within 4 days but in a few cases up to 14 days after vaccination.\n\nTo date, CARM and Medsafe have received reports for people across a wide range of ages. Some of the reports of myocarditis were in women and/or occurred after the first dose.\n\nMyocarditis following Comirnaty vaccination is usually mild, and individuals have tended to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest.\n\nMyocarditis after vaccination should be treated as usual. Consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (eg, cardiologists) if needed for more information on management.\n\nPlease continue to report adverse events following immunisation with COVID-19 vaccines to CARM\n\nProduct affected\n\nProduct name Sponsor Comirnaty Pfizer BioNTech\n\nFurther information\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, while the tissue forming a sac around the heart is inflamed in pericarditis. Myo-pericarditis means that both the heart muscle and the sac are inflamed.\n\nThere are many possible causes of myocarditis, the most common being viral infection. Over 100 people are discharged from hospital with a principle diagnosis of myocarditis in New Zealand every year. It has been shown that men are three times more susceptible to myocarditis than women. Young men (aged 16â20 years) are especially at risk of experiencing myocarditis, while women are affected most after menopause.5 The estimated rate of hospitalisation due to myocarditis in New Zealand is around 2 per 100,000 person years (Interim data SAFE study led by Associate Professor Helen Petousis-Harris, University of Auckland).\n\nMyocarditis has been seen in relation to Covid 19 infection. The short- and long-term implications of SARS CoV-2 infection-induced myocarditis are being monitored.6\n\nThe United States was among the first countries starting to vaccinate people from 12 years of age with Comirnaty. Currently the rate estimated from confirmed cases in health databases in the USA was 8 per million for 12-39 year olds after dose 2. The rate was higher at 23 cases per million in 12-39 year olds when unconfirmed cases were included in the estimate (this rate was in males, there were no cases reported in females).4 The overall rate across all ages and both sexes currently remains at less than 1 in a million3. Myocarditis and pericarditis reactions have also been reported for other COVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna, and to a much lesser extent AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines.\n\nUp to 19 July 2021, the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) has received 9 cases of myocarditis, 5 cases of pericarditis and 4 cases of myopericarditis. Eight of the cases involved male vaccinees. Not all the cases reported to date were admitted to hospital. Cases reported to CARM are being reviewed by the Independent Safety Monitoring Board. To date there has been no clear increase in cases of myocarditis in New Zealand. The age ranges are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Ages of people reported with myocarditis/pericarditis after vaccination in New Zealand\n\n* these reports do not necessarily have a causal relationship with administration of Comirnaty and may represent coincidental events.\n\nFive of the reported reactions occurred after the first dose and 13 occurred after the second dose.\n\nThe New Zealand data sheet for Comirnaty will be updated shortly with a myocarditis and pericarditis warning and precaution. Medsafe will continue to monitor this adverse reaction to Comirnaty to ensure we have identified risk factors and outcomes for anyone affected.\n\nSearch for consumer medicine information (CMI) and data sheets\n\nMonitoring communication\n\nReport an adverse reaction to a medicine\n\nReferences"
