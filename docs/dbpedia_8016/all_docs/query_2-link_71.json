        "text": "The UK has become the first country to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use.\n\nFrom Tuesday, it will be available in 70 hospitals across the country. The first person to be vaccinated was 90-year-old Margaret Keenan, in Coventry.\n\nThe development follows trial results made public in mid-November showing the vaccine, produced by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, had a 95-percent success rate and caused no serious side effects.\n\nBased on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, the jab was found effective across different age groups and ethnicities, raising hopes it will play a significant role in ending the pandemic.\n\n“It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson after the approval by the UK’s independent medicines regulator.\n\nHowever, it is still not known whether the Pfizer-BioNTech shots, estimated to cost about 15 British pounds ($20) per dose, can stop people infected with the novel coronavirus from spreading it to others.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long the vaccine’s effect will last.\n\nThe UK, home to about 67 million people, has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine – enough to inoculate 20 million people, as it is given in two injections, 21 days apart.\n\nThere are three routes for transporting the vaccine into the country, a programme officials have warned will be challenging because it needs to be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94F), or below.\n\nBecause the vaccine needs to be stored at this level, to begin with people will only be vaccinated at hospitals, rather than in nursing homes.\n\nCare home staff and residents will be first in line to get vaccinated, followed by people older than 80, those deemed to be clinically vulnerable, and other health and social care workers.\n\nThe UK, which has celebrated what it dubbed “V-Day”, is battling Europe’s worst outbreak, with more than 1.6 million coronavirus cases and more than 60,000 deaths.\n\nPfizer has described the UK’s emergency-use authorisation as a historic moment in the fight against the pandemic.\n\n“This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win,” said CEO Albert Bourla.\n\n“We are focused on moving with the same level of urgency to safely supply a high-quality vaccine around the world.”\n\nThe authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech drug for use could be followed by the approval of other promising vaccines, including those developed by US biotech firm Moderna and UK pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford.\n\nModerna’s costs roughly 25 British pounds ($33) per dose and offers a similar protection rate to Pfizer-BioNTech. It can be stored for up to six months at -20 degrees Celcius (-4F), although it is believed to remain stable at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to 30 days.\n\nAstraZeneca-Oxford’s product is cheaper, about 3 British pounds ($4) per dose, and proved to be up to 90-percent effective in trials. It can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, meaning it potentially offers the best option for mass immunisation around the world."
