        "text": "A few weeks ago, we talked about some of the changes to watch for with an FDA approval of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIt turns out, one of the most noticeable changes can also be one of the least understood. After Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was FDA approved, it took on a new name: Comirnaty. Even though the name changed, the vaccine remains the same.\n\nSo why did it need a name change in the first place? And what does this mean for other vaccines? Read on to discover what’s really in a name.\n\nWhen do vaccine name changes happen?\n\nBefore a vaccine (or any product) gets FDA approval, it’s known by the company that created it (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, etc.).\n\nOnce an FDA approval is granted, the company selects a brand name for use in the U.S. Until that time, the company is not allowed to advertise or use a brand name, even with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nIs everything else the same?\n\nFor now, everything about the vaccine remains the same, including its ingredients and formulations. The only change is the name.\n\nManufacturers may still change things in the future, like packaging or the way it is administered, but the ingredients and the formulation will stay exactly the same. Any changes that affect a vaccine’s safety or how it works are strictly forbidden and would require a reassessment by the FDA.\n\nWill other vaccines change their names?\n\nYes — any vaccine that gets full FDA approval will also adopt a brand name. That means the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will get new names if the FDA approves them.\n\nHow are the names decided?\n\nThe behind-the-scenes process for selecting a name is actually pretty interesting! Pfizer decided on Comirnaty back in December 2020.\n\nAccording to Pfizer, the name Comirnaty (pronounced Koe-mir’-na-tee) was selected because it “represents a combination of the terms COVID-19, mRNA, community, and immunity.”\n\nco = COVID-19 (which in turn stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019, the year it was discovered).\n\nmirna = mRNA, the snippets of genetic code that tell cells to build proteins. In this case, the proteins on the COVID-19 spike protein.\n\nty = a combination of community and immunity.\n\nModerna is expected to go by the name Spikevax in the U.S. if FDA approval is granted. The company is already using Spikevax in Europe and Canada. AstraZeneca, makers of a COVID-19 vaccine that’s used in many other countries outside the U.S., also goes by the international brand name Vaxzevria.\n\nCan I still use the old name? Are the instances where the manufacturer name will still be used?\n\nShort answer, yes! Though here’s where things can get a little confusing. Comirnaty is the official name for Pfizer’s FDA approved vaccine. That two-dose vaccine is approved for people ages 16 and older. It’s not yet fully approved for people ages 12–15; or people receiving a third dose or booster.\n\nFor those instances, the vaccine is available under the EUA. If you remember from earlier, under an EUA the vaccine will go by the name of the company that developed it.\n\nHere’s a few technicalities using Pfizer’s vaccine as an example:\n\nIf you’re an 18-year-old getting your first and second dose — you’re getting what’s known as Comirnaty. Your 15-year-old sibling getting a shot at the same time will be getting the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nYou’re an immunocompromised individual who’s eligible for a third shot. You’re getting the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nYou’re an adult over the age of 65 who’s now eligible for a booster. You’re getting the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nAgain, same vaccine — just different names depending on who’s receiving it.\n\nDon’t worry if you’re confused. The two names are used by people interchangeably. The good news is that your health care provider — or whoever administers your vaccine — will know what you’re talking about if you just say Pfizer (or Comirnaty)."
