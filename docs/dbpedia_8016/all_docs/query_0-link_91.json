        "text": "Behind every innovative breakthrough are scientists, doctors, nurses, participant volunteers, and many others who work with us to advance science and medicine. They continue to inspire us with their ambition, passion, and commitment to finding new treatments, vaccines, and potential cures for diseases that affect millions of people around the world. They are the #TrailblazersAmongUs. Today, on #ClinicalTrialsDay, we celebrate all those who help make the impossible possible. Thank you. #CTD2024\n\nAt Pfizer Oncology, we have a bold vision: To accelerate breakthroughs that help people with cancer globally live longer and better lives. This vision drives everything we do and reflects our colleagues’ personal mission to improve the lives of people with cancer. In a meeting with the investment community, we outlined strategic priorities for our newly formed Oncology organization, and how our deep and diverse pipeline, industry-leading Oncology expertise, and anticipated near- and mid-term catalysts are expected to position the company to deliver strong growth and shareholder value. Below are some highlights from the event, and you can view the presentation and other details here: www.pfizer.com/investors. #LetsOutdoCancer\n\nPfizer’s Chief Global Supply Officer, Mike McDermott, will be speaking at the TechOps Leadership Accelerator Program in NYC.

Under the motto “Bring Amyloidosis into the light,” the purpose of Amybel is to inform, guide and support patients with Amyloidosis. The two board members of Amybel shared with us their personal story and how they got diagnosed, which even reinforced our commitment to support them and raise awareness around this rare and often underdiagnosed condition. Amyloidosis causes an abnormal accumulation of parts of proteins and can affect different tissues and organs, such as the heart for instance. An early diagnose can make a real difference in the evolution of the disease. For more information on the disease check today www.amyloidose.be and very soon www.amybel.be as well. #Amyloidosis #RareDisease #RadiOrg #PfizerBelgium Maura Verdoliva Stefaan Osaer Quentin Vander Stricht Dave Ceyssens Marie-Lise Verschelden Arnoud den Ouden Ruben Weckx Michiel Vanmeert, PhD, PharmD Ingrid Van Steenberge Mieke Vandenberghe, MD Bharati Shivalkar Arturo Prieto Rodríguez\n\nDr. Kathleen strives to outpace, outsmart and outmaneuver cancer at every turn.
