        "text": "Introduction\n\nA range of clinical comorbidities have been associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and poor outcomes.1, 2, 3 COVID-19 vaccines have shown high levels of efficacy in older adults, healthcare workers and the general population both in clinical trials and real world effectiveness studies.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, data on the effectiveness of these vaccines amongst individuals in clinical risk groups are limited.\n\nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave emergency use authorisation to three vaccines against COVID-19 between December 2020 and January 2021, namely the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA, Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral AZD1222; and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines. BNT162b2 and AZD1222 have been delivered through the national vaccination programme since 8 December 2020 and 4 January 2021, respectively. Rollout of the Moderna vaccine in England began 13th April 2021, though use of this vaccine has been more limited. Vaccination was initially prioritised for older people, health and social care workers and predefined clinical risk groups.10 As of 24 November 2021, over 110 million doses of vaccine have been delivered in the UK.11\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine trials demonstrated high levels of efficacy.4, 5, 6 This has been further supported by real world vaccine effectiveness studies which indicate 50–70% protection against infection or mild disease after a single dose of either BNT162b2 or AZD1222, and 75–85% protection against hospitalisation or death. After two doses effectiveness reaches 65–90% against infection or mild disease, and 90–100% against severe disease.7 , 9 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 These high levels of effectiveness are maintained in older adults, nevertheless, vaccine effectiveness estimates have not yet been reported for individuals in clinical risk groups.\n\nAlthough age has been found to be the greatest risk factor for adverse outcomes following COVID-19 infection, clinical comorbidities may also increase the risk of severe disease. Diabetes, severe asthma, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic liver disease, neurological disease, and disease or therapy associated with immunosuppression have all been linked to an increased risk of hospitalisation or death with COVID-19.1, 2, 3 Individuals with these conditions have been prioritised for vaccination in many national programmes. In the UK, those at highest risk of severe disease have been advised to ‘shield’ by remaining isolated at home for long periods of the pandemic.18 This group was offered vaccination from January 2021 along with older adults. Individuals aged under 65 in other clinical risk groups were offered vaccination from February 2021.19\n\nA number of studies have monitored antibody responses to vaccination in individuals with clinical comorbidities. Reduced seroconversion rates have been seen in transplant recipients, haematological malignancy, solid organ cancer patients and patients on some immunosuppressive therapies after one dose of vaccine. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Reduced antibody responses have also been seen after two doses amongst patients with haematological malignancy and transplant recipients.23 , 26 , 27 Conversely other studies have found similar seroconversion rates amongst patients on immunosuppressive therapy, patients with end stage renal disease and solid organ cancer patients, in particular after 2 doses.22 , 23 , 25 , 28, 29, 30, 31 However, it is not yet clear how differences in antibody responses translate into changes in vaccine effectiveness, although there is some suggestion that higher antibody levels are associated with better protection with respect to more severe outcomes.\n\nIn this study we use computerised medical record (CMR) data from a cohort of general practice patients and sentinel antibody testing within the same cohort to estimate antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic medically attended COVID-19 amongst patients in different clinical risk groups.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study provides evidence of a strong S-antibody response and high levels of effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic medically attended disease in most clinical risk groups. We see reduced S-antibody response and reduced VE amongst the immunosuppressed group, though VE in this group is higher after the second dose and the wide confidence intervals overlap with those in non-risk groups.\n\nThe overall immunogenicity and VE findings are similar to those reported previously. Like other studies we found lower antibody levels with advancing age and in males, and after dose 2 with shorter intervals between doses.24 The levels of VE in our study after 1 and 2 doses are similar to those previously reported in other real world studies.7 , 9 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 However, dose 2 VE estimates for the 16–64 age group appeared low, but only those in clinical risk groups and health and social care workers are likely to have received dose 2 by the end of the study. Health and social care workers are at higher risk of exposure to infection, which is likely to have impacted results.\n\nOur finding of reduced S-antibody positivity and antibody levels in immunosuppressed individuals is in line with that seen in other immunogenicity studies of specific immunosuppressed groups.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 One other study found reduced S antibody levels amongst individuals with cardiovascular disease, in particular amongst those on statin therapy.24 Mechanisms for any reduction in vaccine response in this group are unclear though the association between statins and lipid nanoparticle vaccines merits further investigation. VE against clinical outcomes has not previously been reported. Our findings suggest that the reduced S-antibody response after 1 dose translate into reduced VE in immunosuppressed individuals, but after a second dose VE is higher. After 2 doses of mRNA vaccine previous studies have suggested that individuals on immunosuppressive therapy maintain an immune response,30 , 31 however other studies have reported reduced immune response amongst individuals with haematological malignancy.23 , 26 Considering a broad immunosuppressed group we found only a modest and non-significant reduction in VE after 2 doses of either vaccine. There were 10 cases after 2 doses amongst immunosuppressed individuals, the majority of whom were over 70 years of age. Cases under 70 years had autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease; type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis; psoriatic arthritis) and were on immune modulating therapy.\n\nThese results support maximising coverage with two doses of vaccine amongst immunosuppressed groups. In the context of high rates of COVID-19 in the population, there may be a case for reducing the interval between doses in order to maximise coverage. However, other studies have suggested that longer dosing intervals result in improved immune response, therefore such a move may be counterproductive, in particular in the context of low COVID-19 activity, a finding that we also see in our serology data ( ).35 The findings also support prioritising immunosuppressed individuals for third doses, and to maximise antibody levels prior to a new variant and wave of infections. The main findings are based on medically attended symptomatic disease, protection against severe disease after one dose, including hospitalisation and death, appears to be greater (supplementary material S4).\n\nThis study has a number of strengths: we rely on cases attending general practice and having relevant symptoms recorded by a medical practitioner, which is likely to be more reliable than self-reporting. We also have a large amount of data on previous medical history and demographic characteristics from the full clinical record which allows us to adjust for a large number of possible confounders. Furthermore, we have both immunogenicity data and vaccine effectiveness data (with two distinct methods to estimate VE) and in general the findings from these different analyses are concordant.\n\nAs with any observational study, there are also limitations. Disease epidemiology and testing policies have changed over the period of study. For example, with increased use of lateral flow devices in the community, PCR testing may have shifted toward more confirmatory testing of lateral flow outcomes, which could introduce temporal bias, especially in the TNCC design. We adjust for week which should help to control for such temporal changes. Risk of COVID-19 is likely be greater in health and social care workers (HSCW) who are at high risk of transmission and were amongst the first to be vaccinated. Care home residents were almost all offered vaccination before the end of January 2021, and since severity increases with age, GP consultation with symptoms may be more likely amongst the oldest age group. While it was possible to control for age effects, HSCW status is not known and our large household variable is a limited proxy for care home resident status. The lack of control for HSCW status is likely to explain the lower 2 dose VE in the 16–64 year old age group in the cohort analysis as HSCW are one of the few groups in this age cohort that will have received second doses during the study period but are also likely to have higher exposure risk. Imperfect control of these important variables will introduce bias, including temporal biases given the timing of vaccination in these groups, especially affecting the cohort study.\n\nUnvaccinated individuals are likely to differ from vaccinated individuals in an important way. Vaccination coverage shows that individuals aged 90+, aged 65–69 and belonging to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, especially black ethnicities, are less likely to be vaccinated. Disparities in transmission rates are understood to exist by these sociodemographic characteristics. Those close to the end of life may be less likely to vaccinate. Those who have had recent infection are expected to wait 28 days from resolution of symptoms before vaccinating. We control for many of these factors, but some residual confounding is likely. While the cohort under study is large, once stratifying by clinical risk groups, numbers in some groups remain small and we were unable to further stratify, for example by specific cause of immunosuppression. It is likely that there are differences in immune response and VE according to the severity of immunosuppression.\n\nIn most clinical risk groups, immune response to vaccination is maintained and high levels of VE are seen with both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The immunosuppressed group stands out as having reduced response to vaccination after one and two doses. However, after second doses moderate vaccine effectiveness against clinical disease was seen in this group. In this study we are unable to further breakdown the impact of differing levels of immunosuppression on vaccine effectiveness. Our findings support maximising coverage of immunosuppressed individuals with two doses as well as prioritising this group for third doses. Further research is needed to understand vaccine effectiveness against severe disease amongst immunosuppressed groups, including the added value of 3rd and 4th doses."
