        "text": "Which vaccines has the UK ordered?\n\nThe UK has ordered vaccines from:\n\nOxford/AstraZeneca\n\nPfizer/BioNTech\n\nJ&J/Janssen\n\nNovavax\n\nModerna\n\nGSK/Sanofi\n\nValneva\n\nThe Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are currently in use in the UK, and the government announced on May 28 that 20 million doses of J&J have now been ordered. Additionally, Novavax has published phase three data and looks set to be approved soon. The GSK/Sanofi and Valneva jabs are still in development.\n\nHow effective are the vaccines?\n\nGoing by clinical trial results alone the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs have the highest efficacy – scoring 95 per cent and 94.1 per cent respectively. However, as data from mass administration of the vaccines begin to emerge we are getting a clearer picture on the real-world effectiveness of all of the jabs.\n\nFor example, data from Public Health England in May showed that both the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca jabs prevented 90 per cent of infections in the real-world after both doses.\n\nThat's actually even better than the AstraZeneca jab's trial efficacy results, at 76 per cent after one dose and 82 per cent if the second dose is given 12 weeks later.\n\nOther vaccines do not yet have such strong real-world data to back up trial results.\n\nThe J&J vaccine – which was tested in the United States, South Africa and several Latin American countries – had 66 per cent efficacy overall, but this varied depending where it was tested. For example, in the US the vaccine achieved 72 per cent efficacy, but in South Africa – where a new variant was running rampant – it was just 57 per cent.\n\nBut, Dr Anthony Fauci, leader of the US response, pointed out that none of the trial participants who took the vaccine – either in the US, South Africa or Latin America – were hospitalised or died.\n\n“The most important thing is to keep people outside hospital and prevent them getting severe disease,” he said.\n\nWhat about efficacy among older people?\n\nOlder people are at more risk from Covid but immune responses tail off as people age and vaccine efficacy wanes.\n\nMost of the studies that looked at different age groups only compared over 60s and over 65s to the rest of the study population – but there is a world of difference between a healthy 60-year-old and a 90-year-old chockablock with comorbidities.\n\nAnd the number of older adults included in trials were too small to draw firm conclusions. Several European countries, including France and Germany, initially said the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be given to the over 60s or 65s – this is because of a lack of evidence in this age group, rather than because they think the jab is ineffective. France has now revised this guidance and does recommend the use of the jab in older adults with comorbidities.\n\nMoreover, the real-world data from the UK is beginning to prove that doubts over the jab's effectiveness among older people are unfounded, with a study from March showing that a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine provides a high level of protection against severe disease in the most vulnerable age-groups, with approximately 80 per cent protection against hospitalisations in the over 70s.\n\nHow long does immunity last after vaccination?\n\nThere is currently no reliable test to indicate how long immunity lasts after any of the vaccines. The only clue we can get is to look at immunity conferred by the virus itself, with various studies suggesting it lasts several months. One study last November suggested it could last at least eight months or even years.\n\nReinfection has also – so far – been relatively rare and a UK study of 20,000 health workers in January showed that immune responses from past infection reduce the risk of catching the virus again by 83 per cent for at least five months.\n\nHowever, immunity against other coronaviruses - such as the common cold - wanes over time so booster shots are likely to be needed as most experts believe this virus is not going away. The emergency of new variants may also make further jabs necessary, and the UK is now actively investigating this area.\n\nHow effective are the vaccines against the variants?\n\nTwo doses of a coronavirus vaccine seem to be effective against the Indian variant, Matt Hancock confirmed on May 27. Dr Jenny Harries added that \"we are seeing very, very strong vaccine effectiveness after the second dose\", with Pfizer around 80-90 per cent effective.\n\nWhile AstraZeneca has lower effectiveness against the dominant variant, the Indian strain, early data reveals AstraZeneca vaccine immunisation improving after the second dose.\n\nAt the moment, it is important to point out that all of the vaccines continue to provide adequate protection against severe illness and death caused by all of the \"variants of concern\" - the so-called Kent variant (B.1.17), the South African variant (B.1.351), the Brazilian variant (P1) and the new Indian variant (B.1.617.2).\n\nIn some cases, the effectiveness of the vaccines against the variants is reduced, but they do still work; experts say it is better to think of immunity as a sliding scale, rather than an on/off switch. Moreover, even if the vaccines only offer, say, 50 per cent protection against the variants, that is better than nothing.\n\nSome manufacturers have also created \"tweaked\" jabs. The Moderna vaccine, the first to be tested, has been shown to be effective against the Covid-19 variants.\n\nSecond-generation vaccines are also currently in development, with UK and German firms GSK and Curevac collaborating on a multi-valent vaccine that can be used against several strains.\n\nWhat about ease of use?\n\nOther considerations should also be taken into account when comparing vaccines.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine now no longer needs to be kept at deep freeze conditions - between minus 60 and 80 degrees Celsius - and can be stored in a standard medical freezer at between -15C and -25C for as long as two weeks.\n\nHowever, other vaccines - including AstraZeneca - can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures.\n\nThe J&J vaccine is administered in just one shot – although the company is also trialling a booster dose – so would be appropriate for remote locations or where transport is a challenge.\n\nThe government has ordered 20 million doses of J&J, which will be used to target \"hard-to-reach\" groups in the vaccine rollout, such as those who may be reluctant to come forward for two jabs. Additionally, the Janssen vaccine will potentially be used as part of a booster programme later in the year.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is cheap and is being made available at cost to low and middle income countries in perpetuity.\n\nDo they have side effects?\n\nThe main side effects from vaccines are immediately post vaccination and include tenderness, swelling and/or redness at the injection site, headache, muscle ache, fatigue and fever.\n\nHowever, there have been concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine after several European countries reported a link between it and a rare, but serious, kind of blood clot. Several European countries, like Norway, have since suspended their use of the shot. Others, like the UK, have weighed up the risks and recommend that people aged under-40 get a different jab where possible.\n\nOverall, both the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the British and European regulators, agree the vaccine is \"safe and effective\" and its benefits outweigh the risks, but recommend that the clots should be listed as a \"very rare\" side effect.\n\nThe UK regulator says anyone who experiences a headache for more than four days after having the jab should seek medical attention. People should also get help if they have bruising somewhere other than the injection site after a few days, it added.\n\nThere is a similar issue over the rare clots and the J&J vaccine, first discovered in the US, where it is more widely used. However, the EMA says the benefits of this vaccine also continue to outweigh the very rare side effect risk.\n\nCan I buy the vaccine?\n\nNot in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine is currently being offered by the NHS to those over the age of 32.\n\nRepresentatives of Pfizer have stated that they have no plans to supply the vaccine to the private sector, and private vaccination during the first wave of vaccinations is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat about cost?\n\nComparing cost is a murky business – the UK has not published vaccine contract details or costs because of \"commercial sensitivities\" and different countries have negotiated different prices that don’t always make sense. South Africa is paying twice what European countries are paying for the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.\n\nIn December, a Belgian minister tweeted the price the European Union was paying for the leading vaccines which gives some indication over price per dose.\n\nHowever, recent EU attacks on the AstraZeneca have called into question the decision not to profit from the coronavirus vaccine. In a Telegraph exclusive, Sir John Bell of the AstraZeneca team warned that the company may decide to stop charging the vaccine at cost price due to damaged team morale.\n\nOxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78 (£1.61)\n\nJohnson & Johnson: $8.50 (£6.30)\n\nSanofi/GSK: €7.56 (£6.63)\n\nPfizer/BioNTech: €12 (£10.53).\n\nCureVac: €10 (£8.77)\n\nModerna: $18 (£12.96)\n\nWhat do we know about China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines?\n\nSinovac is one of four Chinese vaccines to have reached the last-stage human trials, a higher number than any other nation in the world.\n\nAlong with Sinopharm, it is now being rolled out across the world. Some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines after past scandals over Chinese-made drugs and vaccines.\n\nClinical trials in Brazil reported on Jan 13 that Sinovac was 50.4 per cent effective, only slightly above the World Health Organisation's minimum standard of 50 per cent.\n\nOn Jan 11, Indonesia became the first country outside China to grant emergency approval to Sinovac’s vaccine, amid surging infections and deaths, followed two days later by Turkey. Interim data showed it is 65.3 per cent effective, Indonesia's food and drugs authority said.\n\nSinopharm was approved by the World Health Organisation for use in May, which concluded that the data showed it had an efficacy of 79 per cent. It is now considering Sinovac for use, too.\n\nLeave your questions about the vaccines below"
