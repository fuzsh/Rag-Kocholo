        "text": "Well, it’s official. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now officially approved the first Covid-19 vaccine for people 16 years and older, as Jemima McEvoy reported for Forbes. People have been referring to the vaccine as the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. But now that it’s progressed from the emergency use authorization (EUA) stage, you may be seeing more of it’s brand name. And that brand name is, drum roll please, Comirnaty.\n\nWhat’s that? Co-ed manatees? Nadia Comăneci? Vormir is nasty? Covfefe?\n\nNo, Comirnaty. So, if you’ve been thinking of naming your kid “Comirnaty,” you may want to re-consider. After all, there’s a reason why you might not name your kid “Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups” or “iPhone.” Those names are already taken by other products, and it could be a bit confusing when someone says, “your iPhone needs an update”\n\nYou may be thinking, “Comirnaty is such an obvious name for the Covid-19 vaccine.” But, if you aren’t, you may be wondering how this name arose? Did someone accidentally hit himself or herself in the genitals and say “Comirnaty?” Or was this a case of a little too much thought:\n\nWell, according to Beth Snyder Bulik writing for Fierce Pharma, the Brand Institute helped come up with the name. The name uses the prefix “co-” to represent community, the “mirna” for mRNA, and the “-ty” as a nod towards the end of both “community” and “immunity.” So the name is supposed to make you think about the technology behind the vaccine, immunity, and community at the same time, rather than one manatee saying to another, “come on, manatee, let’s go party.” Thus, the correct phonetic pronunciation of this new brand name will be koe-mir’-na-tee. Of course, the pronunciation may differ depending on what part of the country you may hail from:\n\nOr what you happen to be drinking at the time:\n\nBy the way, it’s probably not a good idea to get vaccinated while you are drunk, as I described previously for Forbes.\n\nNot unexpectedly, there has been some name calling on Twitter. For example:\n\nAnd:\n\nLoser? Now, that’s just mean.\n\nApparently, other names under consideration included Covuity, RnaxCovi, Kovimerna, and RNXtract. There’s no indication that names such as “Trumpcine”, “your keys will stick to your forehead”, or “wanna be a giant magnet” were under consideration. After all, the technology was already being developed well before 2020, and there has been no documented real scientific evidence that the vaccine will make you magnetic.\n\nThe FDA approval of Comirnaty follows the July 29 European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the Comirnaty vaccine for preventing Covid-19 in those 12 years and older.\n\nThe vaccine’s generic name will be tozinameran, which may not be the easiest thing to say either. That sounds a little like a Europop one-hit-wonder group, as in “and now, with their new hit single, ‘Everyone Loves Monika,’ give it up for Tozinameran.” Instead, the name is the mixture of the prefix “tozina-,” which reportedly was required by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the suffix “-meran,” which is reminiscent of mRNA.\n\nWhile the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine hasn’t received official FDA approval yet, such approval most likely will come soon. The vaccine has been distributed in the U.S. under a EUA since December. And the European Medicine Agency (EMA) has already approved the Moderna vaccine to marketed to those 12 years and older under the name Spikevax. This name is a little more on point as it clearly refers to filmmaker Spike Lee, right? Or maybe filmmaker Spike Jonze? Or perhaps the spike protein that’s on the surface of the Covid-19 coronavirus?\n\nRegardless, there may be different ways of spelling Spikevax, sort of like Sophia versus Sofia versus Sofiya versus Sofiah versus So-fee-ah or Duane versus Dwayne versus Dwain versus Dewayne versus The Rock. For example, Moderna reportedly has filed trademark request for Spykevax and SpikeVax. It’s unlikely the name “M&M’s” for “Moderna mRNA” was ever a leading candidate because again that name is already taken by another product.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine will eventually have a brand name as well. Word is that Rezymnav, Rezymden, Fampelsen, Aqcovsen, Evcoyan, Abfivden, Jcovden, Ovcinden and Jcovav are possibilities. Now, none of these names may be very common in the U.S. You may not hear people saying, “ I was hanging out with Fampelsen the other day when Rezymden and Evcoyan came over with some pizza. It’s too bad that Ovcinden and Jcovav are not here, said no one ever.” No one has mentioned “your Johnson vaccine” as a candidate though.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 mRNA vaccine was the first Covid-19 vaccine to receive FDA EUA, back on December 11, 2020. On May 10, 2021, the FDA expanded this EUA from people 16 and older to those 12 and older. Comirnaty remains available to 12 to 15 year old folks under the EUA but there’s no reason to believe that full approval for that age group won’t eventually come. The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine has lagged the Pfizer/BioNTech a bit, earning a EUA for those 18 years and older seven days after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, on December 18, 2020. So expect official FDA approval of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine sometime in the coming weeks.\n\nOr, rather, expect official FDA approval of the Spikevax sometime in the coming weeks."
