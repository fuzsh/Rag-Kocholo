        "text": "Helena Bonham Carter is an actress of great versatility, one of the UK's finest and most successful.\n\nBonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (née Propper de Callejón), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter's great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Der Roman eines Blumenmädchens (1938) and Ernst sein ist alles (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo's own father was a Czech Jew). Helena's maternal grandmother, Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband's Catholic faith.\n\nBonham Carter experienced family dramas during her childhood, including her father's stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie Es geschah am See (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films Zimmer mit Aussicht (1985), director James Ivory's tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, and Lady Jane - Königin für neun Tage (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Engel und Narren (1991) and Wiedersehen in Howards End (1992).\n\nOften referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in Die Flügel der Taube (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in Die Flügel der Taube (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late '90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson's Live aus Bagdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass' Vom Fliegen und anderen Träumen (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn's Was ihr wollt (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Geliebte Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen's Das Ende aller Träume (1995); Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelleys Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990).\n\nOther notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish - Der Zauber, der ein Leben zur Legende macht (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.\n\nIn between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two-parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann's Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson's junkie fiancée, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall's heart in Liebste Braut, ich hab 'ne Freundin (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.\n\nBonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton's massive hit Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in Wallace & Gromit - Auf der Jagd nach dem Riesenkaninchen (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton's spooky Corpse Bride - Hochzeit mit einer Leiche (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.\n\nAfter their meeting while filming Planet der Affen (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton made seven films together. They lived in adjoining residences in London, shared a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, born in 2003, and Nell Burton, who was born in 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.\n\nJoan Collins is an English actress from Paddington, London. She is most famous for playing the role of vengeful schemer Alexis Carrington Colby in the soap opera \"Dynasty\" (1981-1989). In 1997, She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. In 2015, She was promoted to the rank of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to charity.\n\nShe was the daughter of talent agent Joseph William Collins (1902-1988) and his wife, dance teacher Elsa Bessant, (1906-1962). Joseph was born in South Africa, and of Jewish descent. As a talent agent, his most famous clients were Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Tom Jones. Elsa was born in the United Kingdom to an Anglican family.\n\nCollins was educated at Francis Holland School in London, an independent day school for girls. She made her theatrical debut c. 1942, as a child actress. She had a role in a performance of the play \"A Doll's House\" (1879) by Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906). In 1949, She started training as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. In 1950, she signed a contract with a British film studio, the Rank Organisation of businessman Joseph Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank (1888-1972).\n\nCollins made her film debut in the short film \"Facts and Fancies\" (1951), and her feature film debut in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\" (1951), where she played an unnamed Beauty Queen Contestant. She had supporting roles as the Greek maid Marina in \"The Woman's Angle\" (1952) and gangster's moll Lil Carter in \"Judgment Deferred\" (1952).\n\nCollins had her big break when cast as juvenile delinquent Norma Hart in prison drama \"I Believe in You\" (1952). She was hailed as Britain's new \"bad girl\" and started being offered high-profile roles in British films. The next stage in her career started when cast as Princess Nellifer of Egypt in the historical epic \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955), an international production . While the film was not successful at the box office, it became a cult classic and Nellifer was one of her most recognizable roles. Studio executive Darryl Francis Zanuck (1902-1979) was sufficiently impressed to offer her a 7-year-long contract with American studio 20th Century Fox. She took the offer.\n\nCollins' first American film was the historical drama \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), where she shared the top-billing with established stars Bette Davis and Richard Todd. She then played the leading role of actress Evelyn Nesbit (1884/1885-1967) in the biographical film \"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing\" (1955). The role was intended for established actress Marilyn Monroe, but she replaced Monroe based on a studio decision.\n\nCollins was placed on loan to studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for her next role, that of gold digger Crystal in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956). She received the top billing in the refugee-themed film \"Sea Wife\" (1956), and enjoyed box-office success with the interracial-love themed drama \"Island in the Sun\" (1957). In the drama film \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957), she received top-billing over her co-star Jayne Mansfield. Her next films included the spy thriller \"Stopover Tokyo\" (1957), the Western \"The Bravados\" (1958), the comedy \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys\" (1959), the caper film \"Seven Thieves\" (1960), and the biblical epic Esther and the King (1960).\n\nBy 1960, Collins was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest stars, but she demanded a release from her studio contract. She had campaigned for the title role in the upcoming production of \"Cleopatra\", but the studio chose to cast Elizabeth Taylor in the role. Collins felt slighted. As a freelance actress for most of the 1960s, she had few film roles. Among her most notable roles was playing the leading lady in \"The Road to Hong Kong\" (1962), the last film in the long-running \"Road to ...\" series. The male leads for the entire series were Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, but their usual leading lady Dorothy Lamour was considered too old for the role. Collins replaced Lamour.\n\nCollins started appearing frequently on television guest star roles. Among her most notable television roles was the villainous Siren in \"Batman\", and pacifist spokeswoman Edith Keeler in \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". \"Road to ...\" played in only one episode of Star Trek, the time-travel episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" (1967). However the episode is regarded among the best episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, with Collins considered one of the most memorable guest stars in the original series.\n\nIn 1970, Collins returned to her native United Kingdom. She started appearing frequently in British thriller and horror films of the decade. Among her films was revenge-themed drama \"Revenge\" (1971),science fiction film \"Quest for Love\" (1972), horror anthology \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1972), psychological horror \"Fear in the Night\" (1972), thriller \"Dark Places\", horror anthology \"Tales That Witness Madness\" (1973), and horror film \"I Don't Want to Be Born\" (1975).\n\nCollins appeared in a few comedies in-between horror films, but none was particularly successful. She returned to the United States in order to play a role in the giant monster film \"Empire of the Ants\" (1977). She then returned to mostly appearing in thriller roles. She was catapulted back to stardom with the lead role of nymphomaniac Fontaine Khaled in the erotic drama \"The Stud\" (1978), an adaptation of a novel written by her younger sister Jackie Collins. The film was a surprise box office hit, earning 20 million dollars at the worldwide box office. \"Road to ...\" returned to the role of Fontaine in the sequel film ''The Bitch'' (1979), which was also a hit.\n\nCollins found herself in high demand in both stage and film. But she gained more notoriety with the television role of Alexis Carington in \"Dynasty\". She started appearing in the role in the second season of the soap opera. Her performance is credited with the subsequent rise of the show's Nielsen's ratings. She became a household name, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983.\n\nBy 1985, \"Dynasty\" was the number-one show in the United States, beating out rival soap opera \"Dallas\". Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award for her role, winning once in 1983. She was also once nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series. Collins was viewed as a sex symbol at the time, and in 1983 appeared in a 12-page photo layout for Playboy magazine. She was 50-years-old, unusually old for a Playboy model.\n\nCollins appeared in a total of 195 episodes of \"Dynasty\". The series was canceled with the last episode of its 9th season, due to falling ratings. New ABC entertainment president Bob Iger (1951-) is credited with ending the series as soon as possible. The show had a cliffhanger ending, and several of its subplots were not resolved. Collins returned to the role of Alexis in the sequel mini-series \"Dynasty: The Reunion\" (1991). The miniseries only lasted for 2 episodes, but resolved several subplots and was a ratings hit.\n\nThroughout the 1990s., Collins returned to guest star roles in television. She appeared in (among others) \"Roseanne\", \"Egoli: Place of Gold\", and \"The Nanny\", She had the recurring role of Christina Hobson in the short-lived soap opera \"Pacific Palisades\" (1997). She appeared in 7 of its 13 episodes. Her next notable soap opera role was that of so-called \"rich bitch\" Alexandra Spaulding in 2002 episodes of the long-running series \"Guiding Light\". Collins was the third actress to play this role. following Beverlee McKinsey and Marj Dusay.\n\nIn film, Collins played Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma Flintstone's mother, in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000). It was the second live-action film based on the popular animated series \"The Flintstones\". In 2006, she toured the United Kingdom with \"An Evening with Joan Collins\", an one-woman show where she narrated the highs and lows of her career and life. She later toured the word with both this show and its sequel \"Joan Collins Unscripted\".\n\nCollins had a notable guest star-role as Ruth Van Rydock in the television film \"Agatha Christie's Marple: They Do It with Mirrors\" (2009). The film was an adaptation of the 1952 novel by Agatha Christie, where Ruth is an old school friend of Jane Marple, who assigned Jane to investigate a home for juvenile delinquents.\n\nCollins played herself in three episodes of the sitcom \"Happily Divorced\" (2011-2013). She had the recurring role of Crystal Hennessy-Vass in the sitcom \"Benidorm\" (2007-2018). She had another recurring role as Alexandra, Grand Duchess of Oxford in the soap opera \"The Royals\" (2015-2018).\n\nCollins had two different roles in the horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". She played wealthy grandmother Evie Gallant, and witch Bubbles McGee. She appeared in a total of four episodes in 2018.\n\nBy 2024, Collins was 90-years-old. She has never retired from acting, and she continues to appear in new roles.\n\nShelley Alexis Duvall was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the first child to Bobbie Ruth (Massengale, 1929-2020), a real estate broker, and Robert Richardson Duvall (1919-1994), a lawyer. At the time of her birth, her mother was visiting her grandmother in Fort Worth, though Duvall was raised in Houston. During her childhood, Shelley's mother humorously gave Shelley the nickname \"Manic Mouse\", because she would often run around her house and tip over furniture. Shelley however was more than a mouse, but rather quite the little artist. Her favorite thing to do when she was very young was draw. She also has three brothers: Scott, Shane, and Stewart.\n\nShelley graduated from Waltrip High School in Texas and at first became a cosmetics salesperson. It was in 1970 when Shelley was discovered by talent scouts at a local party. Director Robert Altman wanted to cast Shelley in a film that he was making during the time. Shelley had experience in acting in high school plays at the time and took Altman's offer and she appeared in her first film Brewster McCloud. Altman was so fascinated by her performance that she appeared in his next films including: McCabe and Mrs. Miller in 1971, Thieves Like Us in 1974, and Nashville in 1975. Aside from these three successful films, Duvall's acting blossomed in her leading role as Mille Lammoroux in 3 Women in1977. Duvall's acting was so superb that she won Best Actress at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. Shelley also starred as Bernice in Joan Micklin Silver's Bernice Bobs Her Hair in 1976, and had a cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall in 1977. In the same year, Shelley also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nWhen the 1980s hit, Duvall's career was just beginning.\n\nShe is famously known for playing the role of \"Wendy Torrance\" in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with Jack Nicholson. During the making of this film, Kubrick psychologically tormented Duvall, causing her immense stress and affecting her mental state. He would often ignore her entirely during filming or would put her into situations which caused immense fear and distress for her. The most obvious example is when Kubrick shot the famous \"baseball bat scene\" with Duvall and Nicholson 127 times, which is the world record for most number of takes in any film set.\n\nIn January of 1979, Robert Altman would offer Duvall yet another role in one of his films. Only the role was a certain role Altman believed she was born to play. That certain role was \"Olive Oyl\" in the real life version of Popeye. Shelley was skeptical at first on accepting the role, due to bad memories as a child of negatively being called \"Olive Oyl\" in grade school. She fortunately decided to take the role and performed admirably. Shelley also sings several songs in this film. The most famous ones would be \"He's Large\" and \"He Needs Me\" which also appeared in the film Punch Drunk Love.\n\nAs the 1980s rolled on, Shelley's career never slowed down.\n\nShe appeared as a supporting actress in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits in 1981; she played \"Susan Frankenstein\" in Tim Burton's Frankenweenie (1984) , and co-starred in the hit comedy film Roxanne in 1987 starring Steve Martin.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Shelley continued her filming career but from a different aspect. Since Shelley was 17, she had a collection of a variety of illustrated classic fairy tale books. During the making of Popeye, she showed her collection to Robin Williams. One particular fairy tale she showed Robin was \"The Frog Prince\". Picturing Robin as the real life Frog Prince, Shelley created Platypus Productions, her own production company. Shelley went to Showtime with the idea for airing a television program based on fairy tales. She produced Fairy Tale Theater which Showtime aired and was a hit television series based on several classic fairy tales.\n\nFairy Tale Theatre was on television from 1982-1987. Each episode was a one-hour series and there were a total of twenty six episodes, all hosted by Shelley Duvall. Shelley also starred in four out of the twenty six episodes. In 1985, Ms. Duvall created Tall Tales and Legends which was aired for three years until it ended in 1988. Similar to Fairy Tale Theatre, Tall Tales and Legends was also a one-hour series hosted, produced, and guest starred by Duvall. Although it only consisted of nine episodes, Shelley was nominated for an Emmy from the series.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shelley discovered Think Entertainment; another production company which helped Shelley create more programs and movies that were made for television that aired on common cable channels. Shelley produced three more programs from these production companies that aired on Showtime: Nightmare Classics, Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories, and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle. Her Bedtime Stories program earned her a 2nd Emmy Nomination. Shelley sold Think Entertainment in 1993 and retired as a producer.\n\nIn 1989, Shelley met Dan Gilroy while filming the Disney Channel movie Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme (1990), the two fell in love and they have been together ever since.\n\nShelley Duvall's later career found her a number of different roles. She appeared in the family comedy Home Fries in 1998 playing \"Mrs. Jackson\", Drew Barrymore's character's mother. Other comedic films Shelley appeared in were Suburban Commando in 1991, and Changing Habits in 1997. She also had cameos in several TV series' such as: Frasier, L.A. Law, The Ray Bradbury Theater, Wishbone, and several others. Shelley returned to the horror genre when she played \"Martha Stewart\" in The 4th Floor in 1999 and played the role of \"Mrs. Stein\" in Big Monster On Campus in 2000; which consisted of both the comedy and horror genre.\n\nSince 2002, Shelley Duvall has not acted in any films, but lives a quiet and peaceful life in Blanco, Texas. She has lived in Blanco since 1994, after her home in Los Angeles was badly damaged by an earthquake. For the last couple years, there have been several rumors about Duvall being a \"recluse\" and not being in touch with reality. However, a recent interview in 2010 was conducted by MondoFilm VideoGuide that had heavy proof that Shelley is as normal and aware of reality as ever. She has also noted in this interview that she takes care of several animals at her home in Texas and writes a lot of poetry, and that returning to acting is always a possibility.\n\nMargot Kidder was born Margaret Ruth Kidder in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, to Jocelyn Mary \"Jill\" (Wilson), a history teacher from British Columbia, and Kendall Kidder, a New Mexico-born mining engineer and explosives expert. Margot was a delightful child who took pride in everything she did. At an early age, she became aware of the great emotions she felt towards expressing herself, and caught the acting bug. As a child, she wrote in a diary that she wanted to become a movie star, and that one day it would happen, but she had to overcome something else first. She was aware that she was constantly facing mood swings, but didn't know why. At odd times, she would try to kill herself - the first time was at age 14 - but the next day she would be just fine. Her father's hectic schedule and moving around so much didn't help matters, either, causing her to attend 11 schools in 12 years. Finally, in an attempt to help Margot with her troubles, her parents sent\" her to a boarding school, where she took part in school plays, such as Romeo and Juliet\", in which she played the lead.\n\nAfter graduation, Margot moved to Los Angeles to start a film career. She found herself dealing with a lot of prejudice, and hotheads, but later found solace with a Canadian agent. This was when she got her first acting job, in the Norman Jewison film Heißes Pflaster Chicago (1969). This led to another starring role in Quackser Fortune hat 'nen Vetter in der Bronx (1970), in which she co-starred with Gene Wilder. After some harsh words from the film's director, Margot temporarily left films to study acting in New York, doing television work to pay her bills, but when the money ran out, she decided it was time to make a second try at acting. When she arrived in Hollywood she met up at a screen test with actress Jennifer Salt, resulting in a friendship that still stands strong today. Margot and Jennifer moved into a lofty beach house and befriended other, then unknown, struggling filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg and Susan Sarandon, among others. Late nights would see the hot, happening youngsters up until all hours talking around a fire about how they were all going to change the film industry. It was crazy living and within the Christmas season, Margot had become involved with De Palma, and as a Christmas present he gave her the script to his upcoming film Die Schwestern des Bösen (1972). Margot and Salt both had the leads in the film, and it was a huge critical success.\n\nThe film made branded Margot as a major talent, and in the following years she starred in a string of critically acclaimed pictures, such as Jessy - Die Treppe in den Tod (1974), Tollkühne Flieger (1975), 33 Grad im Schatten (1975) - directed by Thomas McGuane, who was also her husband for a brief period - and a somewhat prophetic tale of self-resurrection, Der Mann, der zweimal getötet wurde (1975).\n\nAfter three years of being a housewife, looking after her daughter Maggie and not working, Margot decided it was time to let her emotions take control and get back into acting. Once her marriage to McGuane was over, she eyed a script that would change her life forever. Her new agent referred her to a little-known director named Richard Donner. He was going to be directing a film called Superman - Der Film (1978), and she auditioned for and secured the leading female role of Lois Lane. That film and Superman II: Allein gegen alle (1980) filmed simultaneously. After the success of \"Superman\" she took on more intense roles, such as Amityville Horror (1979) and Willie & Phil (1980). After that, Margot starred in numerous films, television and theater work throughout the 1980s, including Superman IV - Die Welt am Abgrund (1987). When the 1990s erupted with the Gulf War, Margot found herself becoming involved in politics. She made a stir in the biz when she spoke out against the military for their actions in Kuwait. She also appeared in a cameo in Donner's Maverick - Den Colt am Gürtel, ein As im Ärmel (1994).\n\nIn 1996, as she was preparing to write her autobiography, she began to become more and more paranoid. When her computer became infected with a virus, this gave her paranoia full rein, and she sank into bipolar disorder. She panicked, and the resulting psychological problems she created for herself resulted in her fantasizing that her first husband was going to kill her, so she left her home and faked her death, physically altering her appearance in the process. After an intervention took place, she got back on her feet and started the mental wellness campaign. Since then, she resumed her career in film, television, and theatre, including appearing in a Canadian stage production of \"The Vagina Monologues\", and in films like The Clown at Midnight (1998).\n\nMargot died on May 13, 2018, in Livingston, Montana.\n\nThe sultry, versatile, petite (5' 4\") beauty Sherilyn Fenn was born Sheryl Ann Fenn in Detroit, Michigan, into a family of musicians. The youngest of three children, her mother, Arlene Quatro, played keyboard in rock bands, her aunt is rock-star Suzi Quatro, and her grandfather, Art Quatro, was a jazz musician. Her father, Leo Fenn, was the manager of such bands as The Pleasure Seekers (the all-girl band formed by the Quatro sisters), Alice Cooper, and The Billion Dollar Babies. Sherilyn's ancestry includes Irish, Italian, Hungarian, German, and Bohemian Czech.\n\nSherilyn traveled a lot with her divorced mother and two older brothers before the family settled in Los Angeles when she was seventeen. Fenn, who says herself she's demure didn't want to start with a new school again and soon enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.\n\nFenn began her career with a number of B-movies including Wild Life (1984) (alongside Chris Penn), skater film Trashin' - Krieg der Kids (1986) (opposite Josh Brolin) and teen-fantasy movie Interceptor (1986) (opposite Charlie Sheen). She had a memorable part in the cult teen-comedy Lass mich mal ran! - Als Junge ist sie spitze (1985) in which she tries to seduce a teenage girl disguised as a boy, played by Joyce Hyser. Fenn landed her first starring role, as an engaged heiress to an old Southern family experiencing her sexual awakening in Zalman King's erotic drama film Two Moon Junction - Fesseln der Leidenschaft (1988), after which she said she wanted to hide for a year. Fenn won her most outstanding role and made an indelible impression on the public when she was cast by David Lynch and Mark Frost as the tantalizing Audrey Horne, the high-school femme fatale from the critically acclaimed TV series Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990). The series ran from 1990 to 1991, and the character of Audrey was one of the most popular with fans, in particular for her unrequited love for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and her style from the '50s (with her saddle shoes, plaid skirts and tight sweaters). Sherilyn made a memorable impression as the cherry stem-twisting siren. This was her breakout role; even now she says of her Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990) experience: \"It still makes me feel kind of proud and special to be part of something like that\". In the show's second season, when the idea of pairing Audrey and Cooper was abandoned, Audrey was paired with other characters like Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane). Sherilyn hit cult status when Lynch filmed her dancing on Angelo Badalamenti's music and with another memorable scene in which her character knotted a cherry stem with her tongue.\n\nShortly after shooting Twin Peaks' pilot episode, David Lynch gave her a small but impressive part in Wild at Heart: Die Geschichte von Sailor und Lula (1990), as a girl injured in a car wreck, obsessed by the contents of her purse, opposite Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. According to Fenn, the turning point in her career was when she met veteran acting coach Roy London in 1990. She credits him with instilling confidence and newfound enthusiasm.\n\nAfter two nominations (Emmy and Golden Globe) and covers for Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines, Fenn was propelled to stardom and became a major sex symbol. She was chosen as one of People magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\", was named one of the \"10 Most Beautiful Women in the World\" by Us magazine, and one of the \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" by FHM magazine. Fenn's classic looks - with her lily-white skin, vertiginous boomerang eyebrows, beauty mark next to her left eye and topaz eyes - were highlighted by renowned photographers like George Hurrell Sr., Steven Meisel, and Bettina Rheims, and led her to be compared to the ones like Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner. Fenn has had an eclectic career with a significant body of work following Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990). She chose to focus on widening her range of roles and was determined to avoid typecasting. She turned down the Audrey Horne spin-off series that was offered to her, and unlike most of the cast, chose not to return for the 1992 prequel movie Twin Peaks - Der Film: Die letzten 7 Tage im Leben der Laura Palmer (1992), as she was then shooting Von Mäusen und Menschen (1992). She proved her mettle as an actress with varied roles in neo-noir black comedy Sunset Motel (1991) (as a sultry femme fatale, opposite Whip Hubley and David Hewlett), huis-clos Keiner kommt hier lebend raus (1991) (the directorial debut of her acting coach Roy London, in which she plays a fragile mother who confronts hitman Forest Whitaker), John Mackenzie's fictionalized biopic Jack Ruby - Im Netz der Mafia (1992), (as stripper Sheryl Ann DuJean, a Marilyn Monroe look-alike fictional character, who is a composite of several real-life women from Jack Ruby and president John Kennedy's entourage; opposite 'Danny Aiello' and Arliss Howard), romantic comedy Drei von ganzem Herzen (1993) (as Kelly Lynch and William Baldwin's love interest), Carl Reiner's 1940s detective parody Allein unter Idioten (1993) (as Armand Assante's lovesick secretary and Sean Young and Kate Nelligan's rival) and Showtime's biblical Slave of Dreams (1995), directed by Robert M. Young (as Potiphar's seductive wife Zulaikha, opposite Adrian Pasdar and Edward James Olmos, and produced by Dino De Laurentiis).\n\nA highlight of Fenn's film career is Gary Sinise's film adaptation of Von Mäusen und Menschen (1992), in which she brought nuance to the role of a seductive and lonely country wife, desperately in need to talk to somebody, opposite Sinise and John Malkovich. In 1993, Fenn teamed up with David Lynch's daughter Jennifer Lynch and starred in her directorial debut Boxing Helena (1993) as a haughty seductress forced to live in a box after her limbs were amputated by love-obsessed surgeon Julian Sands in an effort to possess her (a role Kim Basinger backed out of). Both Lynch and Fenn were proud of their work in it but the film - which was overshadowed by the lawsuits against Kim Basinger after she dropped out - ultimately was a critical and commercial failure. Another outstanding performance was in NBC's miniseries Liz Taylor Story (1995). During the shooting, Fenn fought to keep integrity in the script. Her priority was to respectfully and accurately portray Taylor, and she supported the original screenwriter's effort to concentrate on Taylor the person, not the legend. The same year she starred in an episode of Geschichten aus der Gruft (1989) directed by Robert Zemeckis, alongside Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, as the lover of Humphrey Bogart, who appeared in the episode via CGI special effects. She went on to star in independent films that have been well received on the festival circuit like Jon Harmon Feldman's Lovelife (1997) (as a low self-esteemed waitress, along with Bruce Davison, Jon Tenney, Carla Gugino and Saffron Burrows), romantic comedy Just Write - Alles aus Liebe (1997) (as the dream actress of Hollywood tour bus driver Jeremy Piven, who mistakes him for a famous screenwriter) and Adrian Pasdar's neo-noir directorial debut Cement (2000), a contemporary re-telling of \"Othello\", in which she played a tempting but imprudent femme fatale, alongside Chris Penn, Jeffrey Wright and Henry Czerny.\n\nTired of Hollywood, Fenn contemplated starting a European career when she starred opposite Ray Winstone in the British psychological drama and huis-clos Mörderisches Geheimnis (1999) (as a wealthy, neglected wife, sequestered with her husband by a man determined to understand the events that led to his wife ending up in a coma). She eventually decided to return to the United-States and gained newfound enthusiasm with the lead role in Showtime's dark comedy Rude Awakening - Nur für Erwachsene! (1998) as Billie Frank, an alcoholic ex-soap actress who struggles with her self-destructive habits. Based upon creator/executive producer Claudia Lonow's experience, the series ran from 1998 to 2001 and co-starred Lynn Redgrave, Jonathan Penner and Mario Van Peebles. Following Rude Awakening - Nur für Erwachsene! (1998), Fenn's film and television credits have included Showtime's family comedy Off Season (2001), directed by Bruce Davison (along with Hume Cronyn, Rory Culkin, Adam Arkin and Davison; as a singer who takes care of her orphaned nephew), Matthew Ryan Hoge's State of Mind (2003) (as a woman who represents happiness and joie de vivre to Ryan Gosling), Showtime's Cavedweller (2004) (2004, along with Kyra Sedgwick and directed by Lisa Cholodenko), Geretta Geretta's Whitepaddy (2006) (opposite Lisa Bonet and Hill Harper, as a woman who struggles with her dysfunctional family after she reluctantly returned home and tries to fit in with her new neighborhood that has become predominantly black), Emily Skopov's Novel Romance (2006) (as a pregnancy shop owner, opposite Traci Lords and Paul Johansson), psychological thriller Presumed Dead (2006) (as a female detective working on a missing person case, who has to outwit crime novelist Duncan Regehr in order to get to the truth), and Ein Duke kommt selten allein - Wie alles begann (2007) (as a flirtatious version of Lulu Hogg).\n\nFenn has appeared along with Rob Estes and Milo Ventimiglia in a 2003 episode of Amy Sherman-Palladino's Gilmore Girls (2000), which was the pilot for a California-set spin-off, eventually dropped by the network. Sherman-Palladino brought her back in the series with a different part as Scott Patterson's ex-girlfriend and protective mother to his daughter (2006-2007). Fenn had previously had recurring parts on Dawsons Creek (1998), (2002, as Joshua Jackson's seductive boss) and Boston Public (2000) (2003-2004, as a porn star turned tutor). Other notable guest appearances have included 21 Jump Street: Tatort Klassenzimmer (1987) (opposite her then-fiancé Johnny Depp), Friends (1994) (1997, as Matthew Perry's wooden-legged girlfriend), Outer Limits: Die unbekannte Dimension (1995) (2001, as a duplicated scientist), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) (2002, as a manipulative actress), and 4400 - Die Rückkehrer (2004) (2005, as Jean DeLynn Baker, a 4400 who has the ability to grow deadly toxin-emitting spores on her hands).\n\nFenn's interest in directing and children led her to step behind the camera to direct in 2006 a documentary film about the child enrichment program CosmiKids and Judy Julin, the program's founder. She subsequently joined its executive team as executive director of the film and television division.\n\nOn set, Sherilyn is noted for having a quirky sense of humor and a joie de vivre. Off-screen, Sherilyn is proud of the friendship she has maintained with her ex-hubby Toulouse Holliday, a musician and film technician. Sherilyn lives with her son, Myles, and two cats: Ophelia and Redmond. Sherilyn practices meditative kundalini yoga, and every room in her house has feng shui elements-- crystals in one corner, water in another. Sherilyn enjoys biking, swimming and cooking, and of course being a mom: \"After I had my son, I found life much funnier and brighter\"."
