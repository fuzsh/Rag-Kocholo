He grew up on the streets of the South Bronx in New York City, where he very early decided that dance and the theatre were to be his career. He attended the High School for the Performing Arts (popularized in Fame - Der Weg zum Ruhm (1980)).

Landing one of his first roles on the hit TV show, 'Moonlighting' (with Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd), Richard's career took off from there and hasn't shown any sign of slowing down since. Best known for his roles as Buddy Revell in 'Three O'Clock High', Cullen Crisp in 'Kindergarten Cop' (opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger) and Perry in 'Two Moon Junction', Richard has time and time again proven his versatility as an actor in not only the different characters he plays, but also in his ability to go from feature film star to television actor to theater performer (he regularly takes to the stage to perform Shakespeare).\n\nRichard was the star of his own television series called Hardball which ran for a year in 1989.

He was first recognized for his gregarious performance of teen rebel \"Zack Dell in the cult-classic film Ferien total verrückt (1994). Barely in high school, Roland Emmerich cast Keegan in the blockbuster Independence Day (1996). After an immediate rise in popularity, the charismatic actor guest-starred on many hit shows before being cast on the TV drama Party of Five (1994). That same year, he landed another recurring role on Eine himmlische Familie (1996), the WB's longest-running hit series, on which he played a single teenaged father in love with Jessica Biel's character Mary. Keegan showed his range from comedy to drama in two modern-day Shakespearean film adaptations. His hilarious performance as the antagonist of Heath Ledger in the comedy 10 Dinge, die ich an Dir hasse (1999) was balanced by a solid dramatic performance as Mekhi Phifer's best friend in O (1995), which was directed by Tim Blake Nelson.\n\nA bold choice in his career, Keegan accepted the lead role in Greg Berlanti's critically acclaimed Der Club der gebrochenen Herzen - Eine romantische Komödie (2000), which showed a more vulnerable side of his acting range as the newbie. The film won best picture that year at the GLAAD Awards. Expanding his range in 2009, Keegan made his theatrical stage debut in the provocative award winning play \"He Asked For It.\" Keegan stepped on stage as Rigby, a character tackling the emotional issues of being HIV-positive in modern-day society. In 2010, Keegan jumped into the cockpit as Strayger, a drug-smuggling pilot in the high-octane action film Kill Speed - Lebe schnell ... stirb jung! (2010). Innovative camera technology allowed the adrenaline-driven actor to give his performance while doing aeronautical stunts in mid-flight.\n\nAlongside William Sadler and John Heard, Keegan took on a darker role as a sadistic and sociopathic vampire named Blake in the film Living Among Us (2018).\n\nAn acting chameleon who can easily lose himself in the life of his film and television characters, Clifton Collins Jr. is a native Angeleno who grew up destined to become a part of the Latino entertainment industry. His great-grandparents on his mother's side were a Mexican trumpet player and Spanish dancer who formed a traveling family act, and his grandfather was well-known character actor Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, most famous for his humorous sidekick roles in 1950s/1960s John Wayne westerns (he played the excitable hotel keeper in Rio Bravo (1959)) and in sitcoms. His uncle and aunt dabbled in the business at one point as well. While his famous grandfather was unable to break out of the old unflattering Latino stereotypes, Collins Jr. has done Pedro proud in the new millennium. Playing everything from policemen to boxers to serial killers, he has managed to transcend the typical racial trappings of his grandfather's era and play flesh-and-blood, three-dimensional characters. It was not always that way.\n\nBorn short, lean and mean on June 16, 1970, he started his career in 1988 using his real name of Collins, but two years later began billing himself as \"Clifton Gonzales-Gonzales\" as a tribute to his aged grandfather and his early accomplishments. Pedro, who died in 2006, lived long enough to witness his grandson's achievements. Toiling in typical \"barrio\" roles at the beginning of his career, Collins Jr. found himself stuck in bit parts either as a struggling blue-collar worker or urban thug. In the mid-1990s, he began to search out and wing standout roles that enabled him to break the confines of the Latino stereotype. He slowly moved up in billing, even in mediocre material such as the futuristic prison film Fortress - Die Festung (1992) and the mindless 1970s rock-era comedy Chicks - Total bekifft und wild auf Girls (1994). His breakout role as Cesar, the vicious student and gangbanger in 187 - Eine tödliche Zahl (1997) opposite Los Angeles substitute teacher Samuel L. Jackson, set him on the right path. This led to a mesmerizing collection of other portrayals, both good-guy and bad-guy, in such films as The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998), Ein Anzug für jede Gelegenheit (1998) and Tigerland (2000). His versatility finally tested, he played everything from a gay Mexican hitman in the critically acclaimed Traffic - Macht des Kartells (2000) to a psychological profiler for the FBI in the mainstream actioner Mindhunters (2004). A number of top guest appearances came his way on such series as New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993) and Twilight Zone (2002) and he had recurring roles on Resurrection Blvd. (2000) and Alias: Die Agentin (2001).\n\nA monumental shift forward in his career happened recently with his hypnotic portrayal of killer Perry Smith, the object of writer Truman Capote's obsession, in the art-house favorite Capote (2005). Decades ago, Robert Blake played the same part in the gripping Capote book-to-film Kaltblütig (1967). This heralded achievement has enabled Collins to move into the co-producer's chair of late, notably for Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders (2006), in which he inhabits the role of serial killer Kenneth Bianchi. Obviously, there is plenty more in the works for this major talent.\n\nMore recent millennium work includes potent performances in Road Dogz (2002); Tom Cool (2009), which he produced; Dirty (2005); For Your Own Good (1996), which he co-produced; Star Trek (2009); Die Hollywood-WG: Schmeiß die Loser aus dem Haus (2012); The Safe - Niemand wird verschont (2017); and the Oscar-winning Once Upon a Time In... Hollywood (2019).\n\nBeginning his life with the same flair for the dramatic that would come to define his career, Udo Kier was born in Köln, Germany near the end of the 2nd world war. The hospital was bombed and buried Kier and his mother in the rubble. Both survived, and Kier would later move to London as a young adult to study English. Kier was discovered in London by Michael Sarne, who cast him in his first role as a gigolo in \"Road To Saint Tropez\". Kier then starred in Michael Armstrong's extremely controversial \"Mark Of The Devil\". He would go on to work with Paul Morrissey in Andy Warhol's \"Flesh For Frankenstein\" and \"Blood For Dracula\", Dario Argento in \"Suspiria\", and Rainer Werner Fassbinder in \"The Third Generation\", \"Lili Marllen\", and \"Lola\".\n\nKier entered the American independent cinema scene many years later after meeting Gus Van Sant at the Berlin Film Festival. Van Sant offered Kier the role of Hans, the lamp-singing john in \"My Own Private Idaho\" with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. He would later have roles in Gus Van Sant's \"Even Cowgirls Get The Blues\" and \"Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot\" as well as such 90s Hollywood hits as \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", \"Johnny Mnemonic\", \"Barb Wire\", \"End Of Violence\", \"For Love Or Money\", \"Armagedden\", \"Blade\", and \"End Of Days\". Kier is probably best known for his collaboration with Lars von Trier, appearing in most of his films including \"Medea\", \"Europa\", \"Breaking The Waves\", \"Dancer In TheE Dark\", \"Dogville\", \"Manderlay\", \"Melancholia\", \"Nymphomaniac (Vol. II)\" and \"The Kingdom\" (Danish TV). Kier's recent renaissance has seen him play memorable roles in the Activision game \"Call Of Duty\", numerous television roles in North America and Europe, and in the films \"Iron Sky\", \"Brawl In Cell Block 99\", \"Downsizing\", \"American Animals\", \"Bacurau\", \"The Painted Bird\", \"The Blazing World\" and \"Swan Song\", among many others.\n\nKevin Smith called her an American Pop Icon and John Waters called her the ultimate bad girl. While her early notoriety brought her international fame, her determination, grit, and talent have garnered her respect in many areas of the entertainment industry. She has appeared in dozens of films and television shows such as Roger Corman's cult classic Not of This Earth, John Water's Crybaby, Marvel's Blade, Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno, to the award-winning Excision; from Melrose Place, Roseanne, Will & Grace to series regular roles on NBC's Profiler and Syfy's First Wave. Her memoir Traci Lords Underneath It All (HarperCollins) was a NY Times Bestseller, and her pioneering techno album 1000 Fires topped the Billboard Dance Chart and was featured on both the Mortal Combat and Virtuosity soundtracks earning double platinum status. Lords is an award-winning voice over artist and has a vintage inspired line of clothing. In 2020, she made her stage debut as Gloria in the revival of Tom Eyen's cult classic Women Behind Bar which is now streaming on Broadway World.\n\nLords is an Ohio native born to Patricia and Louis Kuzma. Young Nora Louise Kuzma spent her early days in rural Steubenville, Ohio shuttled between her divorced parent's houses. It was then that her mother began a relationship with a man named Roger Hayes and relocated to Southern California. Teenage Nora missed her father terribly and began to treat Roger as a father figure. Her mother eventually realized that Roger was not the man she had thought he was and ended the relationship but left Nora in Roger's care, claiming she was overwhelmed and couldn't provide for the teenager. In Traci's memoir Underneath It All, she states that Roger groomed her for nude modeling and sex trafficked her at that time. Porn agent Jim South has confirmed in various interviews that it was Roger Hayes who brought the 15-year-old to his office in Van Nuys, California in 1984. Armed with a fake ID, no one questioned the stunning woman-child who signed on as a figure model which eventually led to adult films. With her rebellious attitude and stunning looks, she shot to stardom quickly in the X-rated world.\n\nIn May 1986, the Traci Lords story broke. The media had a field day with the tale of the troubled bad girl who tricked the porn world. The FBI questioned Lords and announced that because she was a minor, she was not responsible and that all films that featured her must be destroyed. Lords was never arrested or charged with any crimes but was punished in other ways. She was forced to pay estimated taxes on her purported income. And has faced years of criticism and ridicule because of her history in adult movies but eventually carved an impressive body of work in mainstream Hollywood where she continues to thrive today. Lords' lives in Southern California with her husband and their son.\n\nJudson Mills was born in Washington, DC, and grew up in northern Virginia in a house built by George Washington. Washington was a young surveyor in the area and the home is a historical landmark. Mills grew up hunting and fishing, and was most interested in sports, particularly football.\n\nJudson attended High Mowing in Wilton, New Hampshire, a private school, for his junior and senior year. It is a Waldorf school and rich with history and the arts. Not until his senior year did he involve himself in the theater. He was pushed into performing in his first play and received a standing ovation for his relatively brief cameo.\n\nThis approval met Judson's liking and he began pursuing a career in acting. Judson first attended Barry University, a liberal arts college in Miami, Florida, but quickly realized that training in New York was what he needed if he really wanted to succeed.\n\nHe moved to Long Island with the intention of attending the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He auditioned and was accepted. Only 250 people are accepted for the first year of their program, and of those, only 60 are asked back to the second, final year. After two years at AADA, and only two weeks before graduation, Mills was thrown. His bold, reckless personality would prove to be an asset as well as a handicap throughout his career.\n\nWhile being made an example of for his tardiness and absences was humbling, it also fueled his drive. Two weeks later Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) called AADA looking for an actor for a summer romance storyline. They spoke to a faculty member who was a friend and fan who recommended him for the audition. Judson audition and gained the role\n\nMills spent two and a half years on the show, laying the foundation for the rest of his career. He was then signed for an episode of Law & Order (1990). Realizing California had more career options, he left everything behind and moved to Hollywood.\n\nThe cocky young actor landed a role in a made-for-TV movie starring Alyssa Milano and Jamie Luner shortly after arrival. But again, Mills brash attitude and wild personal life continued to be his worst enemies. Over the next decade, Mills appeared on upwards of 30 TV shows including New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993), J.A.G. - Im Auftrag der Ehre (1995), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993), and CSI: Miami (2002). He also broke into feature films, starting in independents like American Perfect (1997) with Paul Sorvino, Robert Forester, Amanda Plummer, and David Thewlis, Joyride (1997) starring Tobey Maguire, 'Benicio DelToro', and Adam West. Judson's first starring role was as surfer/pitcher Hog Ellis, in the third installment in the Major League trilogy, Zweite Liga - Die Indianer von Cleveland sind zurück (1998). He also went on to work with such greats as Cuba Gooding Jr., in Der Chill Faktor (1999), Sir Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser in the Academy Award-nominated Gods and Monsters (1998), and Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton in Disney's Mein großer Freund Joe (1998). He also spent two years in Dallas with Chuck Norris filming the last 52 episodes of Walker, Texas Ranger (1993). Connection with the Norris family (Chuck, his brother Aaron, and son Eric) proved to be valuable when after finishing Walker, they continued working together filming the movie of the week McCord - The President's Man II (2002). The movie drew 16 million viewers opposite the Golden Globe Awards. Talk of a spin-off series was shelved due to 9-11.\n\nJudson lives in Los Angeles with his two sons, Jagger with wife Morgan and Dalton with ex-wife Julie.
