There's no shortage of films these days and we all have our favorites: drama, horror, comedy, or even romantic movies.\n\nNow, you've probably heard or read about movies that were filmed in Idaho but how many movies take place in Idaho? Thanks to the folks over at IMDb, I was able to search and find as many movies as I could that take place in the Gem State and there's something for everyone! Do you want a horror movie that takes place in Idaho? Check out 'The Being' or 'Paranormal Prison'. Do you want to check out a movie that not only takes place in Idaho but was also selected for preservation by the Library of Congress? We've got that for you too.\n\nI'm not kidding you - I just spent the better part of my day verifying all of these movies took place in Idaho (in SOME capacity) and by the time I was done; I could not believe how much of a variety there is.\n\nThere is something for everyone on this list and now I'm excited to run through it just to see if I can learn something about Idaho or even spot certain landmarks.\n\nRead on and let us know how many of these 35 films you have seen that take place in Idaho."
