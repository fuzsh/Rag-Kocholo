It wasn't exactly the best but hey... they tried!

Let's take a look at some of the surprising films that were filmed in the Gem State that you may or may not have seen...\n\nOf course, how you experience a film is just as important as the film itself. Let's take a look at some of the drive-in theaters that Idaho has to offer..."
