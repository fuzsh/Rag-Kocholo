        "text": "After donning the Mask, it is now time to continue THE LEGEND OF ZORRO with our episode on Martin Campbell’s 2005 sequel, once again starring those damn fine sexy leads Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. But, coming some seven years after the original, something seems to have been lost along the way: the juice. To find out why this Zorro doesn’t quite whip like he used to, we enlist the help of podcaster MJ Smith of Let’s Jaws For a Minute fame to see if this follow up was just a case of too little too late - or if it is a greater miscalculation of appeal than that.\n\nYou can follow Harley on Twitter at @MJSmith891 and you can find his shows (Let’s Jaws For a Minute, Let’s Party with Marty and Reel Perspective) where you get this podcast.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

A special thanks as always to Emily Tatham for the artwork, and Robert J. Hunter-Clayton & Greg Sheffield for the theme music.\n\nWe finish the tub of Neopolitan Spielberg trilogy by saving the best (chocolate) for last: his 2005 adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS. Together with returning guest Harley Mumford (of the fabulous Fandomentals podcast), we talk through the various different interpretations of H.G. Wells’ 1897 classic—particularly Orson Welles’ (no relation) infamous 1938 broadcast and the 1953 movie—and chart how each acts as a response to its particular place and time. In this instance, we discuss Spielberg’s film as an explicit response to 9/11 (and its place as the final instalment of his Paranoid Sci-Fi Trilogy), the surprisingly dour tone for a summer blockbuster and what the changes to the source material say to the contemporary mindset. We also talk about Tom Cruise in deadbeat dad mode, draw some surprising connections with the Jurassic Park sequels and try to understand what the hell is going on with Robbie. Andy also talks about the musical. A lot. Brace yourselves.\n\nYou can follow Harley on Twitter at @HarleyMumford and his Fabdomentals Podcast at @FandomentalsPod.

A special thanks as always to Emily Tatham for the artwork, and Robert J. Hunter-Clayton & Greg Sheffield for the theme music.\n\nIt’s time to check in with Steven Spielberg’s 2004 comedy-drama THE TERMINAL, the second part in our Neapolitan Spielberg trilogy. The ‘vanilla’ section of the trio is a rare Amblin joint where we have quite different opinions on the movie, and to help us unpack our feelings is our guest; friend, musician and one half of the Ramblin-theme composing team Robert J. Hunter-Clayton. Together, we delve into the inspiration behind the Tom Hanks-starring tale, marvel at the scale of its production design, weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of its various subplots and despair at Hanks’ Whopper-eating technique. So, boarding tickets at the ready and hop aboard - we hope you have a pleasant flight.\n\nYou can follow Robert on Instagram and Twitter @RJHunterMusic and experience his musical stylings on Spotify: https://tr.ee/J3DdSljatd - You can also purchase physical copies of his latest album over on Bandcamp: https://robertjhunter.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-but-rust\n\nRead production designer Alex McDowell’s production diaries here: https://rb.gy/91x59x\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

A special thanks as always to Emily Tatham for the artwork, and Robert J. Hunter-Clayton & Greg Sheffield for the theme music.\n\nWe kick off the first chapter in our self-coined ‘Neapolitan Spielberg trilogy’ with the strawberry of the trio, the beard’s 2002 con-man caper ‘CATCH ME IF YOU CAN’, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. To join us in tracking down the tale of putting the story of Frank William Abagnale Jnr to the screen is film historian and musical expert Miles Eady. Together, we discuss the long line of filmmakers who couldn’t quite get their clutches on the story, try out a Christopher Walken impression or two, consider the difficulties of a broadway adaptation, and look at what depths lie beneath the stylish and breezy surface of one of Spielberg’s most surprising works. And we also grapple with the age old question: should you ever let the truth get in the way of a good story?\n\nYou can check out more of Miles’ work over on his website: https://mileseady.com/\n\nHere’s a link to the real Frank William Abagnale’s appearance on The Johnny Carson Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIYtKR24LQs&pp=ygUkZnJhbmsgYWJhZ25hbGUgb24gam9obm55IGNhcnNvbiBzaG93\n\nAnd a taste of the Broadway musical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zayv01x1QLs&pp=ygUcY2F0Y2ggbWUgaWYgeW91IGNhbiBicm9hZHdheQ%3D%3D\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

We’re checking in with the MIB franchise, investigating the bad case of sequelitius that seems to have infected the Barry Sonnenfeld directed follow up to the 1997 sci-fi comedy classic. Both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return from Amblin past, and so does our guest -critic and broadcaster Rihanna Dillon. Together, we dig into the film's dragged out road to production, stressful shooting schedule and try to put our finger on just what is missing from this misfire of a sequel. But always remember, when there’s an Amblin movie to discuss, the elite is here, so have no fear, just, let me see you, NOD YA HEAD.\n\nYou can follow Rhianna on Twitter @RhiannaDhillon and you can listen to her on BBC Radio 6 Music and catch PodPod (@podpodofficiak) wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Hunter-Clayton & Greg Sheffield for the theme music.\n\nThis Christmas, everybody runs - particularly everyone's favourite Hollywood cross country champ Tom Cruise. It is time to wave our hands in the hand and catch the red ball that is Steven Spielberg’s ‘MINORITY REPORT’ the sci-fi action-thriller based on the short story by Phillip K. Dick.\n\nTo join us in unpacking this vision of the future is our pal and fifth-time guest Dan Kelly. We get into the project’s origins as a retooled Total Recall sequel, reflecting on the film’s themes of free will and state surveillance, while also offering many Max Von Sydow impressions. Please listen and enjoy, as the precogs foretold - and a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all you Ramblers out there.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

The same could be said for the production of ‘JURASSIC PARK III’ - the third entry in the Jurassic franchise, directed by Joe Johnsotn. We get into its turbulent journey to the screen with returning guest David from Jurassic Collectables (@JurassicCollect), musing on the film that could have been, reminiscing about our first encounters with both the franchise and Johnston, as well as unpacking just what works and what doesn’t in the finished feature, Spinosaurus and all.

Socrates. Particle. Decibel. Hurricane. Dolphin. Tulip. Ramblin. Listener. Ramblin.\n\nNow we’ve got that out of the way, it’s time to get serious about Papa Spielberg’s first offering of the new millennium: 2001’s moody, existentially shattering A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Beginning as a short story in the pages of Harper’s Bazaar in the early-‘70s, the film started out as a Kubrick project before gradually, over the years, forging a bridge between the two master filmmakers and ultimately coming to fruition as a ghostly collaboration.\n\nWe talk about the extent to which the film represents the nexus of these two very (ostensibly) different sensibilities, the truly remarkable work done by Hayley Joel Osment in doing the impossible and making human this uncanny life form, and the wild (mis)interpretations that have led to people taking very different things from the conclusion. It’s heavy stuff, so we’ve brought out the big guns to help us wade through it. That’s right, for this episode we’re joined by the one and only Good Doctor himself, Mr. Mark Kermode, a man who famously reassessed the film (as well as his own reaction to it) in the years since, even going so far as to confessing to the director himself. We’re over the moon that he could join us and we hope you find this discussion (which begins at around the 40 minute mark) as rewarding as we did, instead of looking at us blankly and asking: ‘What were those words for, Mommy?’\n\nYou can listen to Mark Kermode every Friday on Kermode and Mayo’s Take, available on all good pod catchers of choice.

But will The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas have the same incendiary effect? We’re back in the podcastin’ business and back in Bedrock for Brian Levant’s prequel, swapping out the original crew for newer, younger, improved(?) models to see how Fred, Barney, Wilma and Betty all got together in the first place - with a little help from The Great Gazoo (may God have mercy on us all). To take the trip to Rock Vegas, we have cordially invited back two returning guests, Daisy Edwards and Clare Brunton - collectively the hosts of the W-Rated podcast - to take in the garish sights and sounds. What will we find under this turn of the century rock as we embark on a new decade for Amblin Entertainment?

Strap in as we gun it to 88 to cover such great topics as our biggest cry, the worst film of decade, best dog, favourite performance and of course, reveal the listener’s top five Amblin movies of the 90s. We also invite returning guest Emily Tatham to test our 90s knowledge to suitably zany results.

We at Ramblin wanted to give the 90s the send off it deserved, and boy did we ramble. So much so that there’s just too much good stuff to pack into one episode - so let’s spread the joy and celebrate the most prolific decade of Amblin’s history so far in two epic parts, with categories both old and new, from best score, to best surprise, and the most 90s of the 90s. So, hold onto your butts and enjoy part one, and make sure to come back next week to hear what the listener’s voted for as the top five movies of decade.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

That the film that sees us do this is Neil Jordan’s deeply bizarre supernatural psychological thriller IN DREAMS feels wholly appropriate for such a far-reaching, uneven and frequently unwieldy decade. Together we figuratively go bobbing for apples in an attempt to make sense of this tangled mess of a movie, wading through the giallo-esque narrative, the questionable performances and the truly stunning visual work en route to a conclusion that makes less sense the more you think about it.\n\nTW: IN DREAMS deals with instances of child abduction/abuse and suicide and, though our discussion mainly focuses on the ludicrousness of the film’s register, these elements do still factor into the conversation. If this sounds like it might be upsetting, we recommend skipping this episode.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Together we talk about the revolutionary portrayal of the D-Day landings, the contributions of the extensive cast and the reactions of veterans themselves. We also wade into some of the film’s more complicated elements, such as its relationship to jingoism, the impossibility of avoiding glamourising war and accusations of a propagandist bent. There are no easy answers, as with everything in life, but we had a great time searching for them, all the same.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

We get unapologetically lustful over what is one of the last great sexy blockbusters of recent memory, diving into the history of Zorro on screen, the sizzling star power of Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and feeling absolutely whipped by Anthony Hopkins silver locks.

The Ramblin boys draw up battle plans to face Joe Dante’s final - at least for now - Amblin joint, the 1998 action-adventure SMALL SOLDIERS. We assemble an elite unit made up of returning guests Rhys Edwards and Dan Kelly to assist in taking down the Commando Elite and aiding the peaceful Gorgonites, as we cover the film’s production history, Burger King tie-ins, its anti-military industrial complex sentiments and the uncanny similarities to Avatar.

To join us in dissecting this perfect blockbuster (as though it were an expired Arquillian ambassador) is self-professed ‘Queen of the Dead’ Anna Bogustkaya, critic/broadcaster extraordinaire and host of The Final Girls, Successionistas and Dead By Dawn podcasts.

A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, Ramblin! That’s right, it’s time to step through that scary door into the twilight zone of 1996 thriller THE TRIGGER EFFECT, screenwriter David Koepp’s feature directorial debut and an altogether overlooked entry in the Amblin canon.\n\nJoining Andy and Josh on their journey is newly-minted three-timer Dan Kelly (@DeekingAround), self-proclaimed Koepp-head and general appreciator of this kind of conceptual, slimline blockbusting. Together they talk about the film’s conception, the cast of Amblin all-stars and tonal reference points that range from the understandable (Spielberg!) to the unexpected (Shyamalan?).

Yes, that’s right, it’s time to hunker down and strap yourself to a pipe as the Ramblin team go chasing that fabled F5 by tackling Jan de Bont’s wacky 1996 disaster-ish thriller-ish, TWISTER. The boys are joined by fellow tornado enthusiast Charlotte Bailey, and together they delve into the bonkers production history, the chills and spills of repurposed CGI zebras and the film’s enduring legacy amongst extreme weather freaks.

It has been a rocky road for Spielberg’s attempt at tackling the animation market, but it tries to cut fresh tracks in the snow with the based-on-fact adventure BALTO, directed by Simon Wells and featuring the voice talents of Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins (no songs though). We head out on the trial of the movie, taking a look at its relationship with the true story of the great serum run to Nome Alaska in 1925, the undue pressure the failures of the previous two Amblimation films put on Balto and perhaps most importantly seek justice for Togo, the real hero of this story.

Old lovers learn the art of sewing shreds together and of seeing beauty in a multiplicity of podcast ramblings. In this Ramblin episode, we thread together the connecting stories of Jocelyn Moorhouse’s HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT, the 1995 adaptation of Whitney Otto’s novel, described by Amazon as a ‘gentle comedy’ We’ll determine just how gentle it is as we welcome our guest - critic and broadcaster Rihanna Dillon - to become a part of the Ramblin patchwork. We discuss Moorhouse’s background and the performances of a stacked cast that includes the likes of Winona Ryder, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Lois Smith, Alfre Woodard, and Maya Angelou. But most importantly, will we find out just how to make an American quilt?\n\nYou can follow Rhianna on Twitter @RhiannaDhillon and you can listen to her on BBC Radio 6 Music and catch PodPod (@podpodofficiak) wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

This time, we’re hitching a ride in a 1967 Cadillac Deville with drag queens Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze), Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) and Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) as we discuss Beeban Kidron’s comedy TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! JULIE NEWMAR. To tackle the longest title - in terms of letters that is - so far, we invite Sarah Buddery of Looper and Let’s Jaws For A Minute podcast fame. for the journey.

The make-shift ghostly trio get cosy and warm with their nostalgia as they recount their tales of meeting the friendly ghost for the first time, address the film’s ‘my first existentialism’ themes, its surprising emotional heft, its Harvey comics origins and praise the ever brilliant and incredibly missed James Horner.

Seeing as Andy and Josh's knowledge of NFL and American football is somewhat limited, the Ramblin boys call in assistant coach Rhys Edwards for their discussion to make a play that can rival the Annexation of Puerto Rico.

We’re back and this time we’re heading to the town of Bedrock through the courtesy of our two pairs of feet to meet The Flintstones. This 1994 adaptation of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon from the 1960s was much maligned by critics at the time of its release, but is the Brian Levant directed movie starring John Goodman and Rick Moranis really all that bad?

To help us in our examination of the film’s portrayal of the Holocaust, Jewish life and Oskar Schindler, we’re very lucky to be joined by Chief Executive of UK Jewish Film, Michael Etherton. Together we break down the film’s aesthetic choices, Spielberg’s motivations behind tackling this subject matter at this particular time and the ethics of trying to depict such an abhorrent moment in human history, let alone in a piece of popular entertainment. It’s an understandably difficult area to explore, but we hope that you find the discussion illuminating.\n\nYou can follow Michael on Twitter at @MichaelEth.

Yes, that’s right, we’re talking A DANGEROUS WOMAN, Stephen Gyllenhaal’s 1993 melodrama starring Debra Winger, Barbara Hershey and Gabriel Byrne. It’s a film that comes the closest to not actually existing out of any we’ve covered yet, but still provides plenty of fertile ground for discussion. Join us as we work through such questions as ‘isn’t Byrne a dish?’ and ‘who exactly is the dangerous woman?’ and ‘just how cack-handedly is this going to deal with the representation of neurodivergence?’ (Hint: About as well as you’d think.)\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

A DINOSAUR’S STORY. With a script by JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO’s John Patrick Shanley and multiple hands on the wheel, the final product needs to be seen to be believed, as our makeshift herd will attest. Join us as we welcome new guest, friend and fellow Warwick grad Lucy Ogilvie, and welcome back returning guest Jack Buckley to take the trip from the prehistoric era to early-90s New York City, as we roam the streets with Rex and pals and run away to the circus - now that’s a notion with some spice!\n\nNOTE: We, unfortunately, lost a chunk of Mr. Buckley’s audio, so if you’re wondering why he goes quiet for a period that would be why. If you’re looking for someone to blame, blame Stubbs the Clown.

That’s right folks, let us at Ramblin welcome you to JURASSIC PARK - the 1993 mega-blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg that became the highest-grossing movie of all-time. To excavate the mines of this cinematic milestone, we invite Jurassic expert Jack De La Mare - founder of the site Jurassic Outpost - to share his expertise, while being mindful of anything in mirrors that may be closer than they appear. It’s a suitably epic episode where we spare no expense, leaving no Barbasol Can untouched as we travel through the production and share our thoughts on this stone cold classic. Hold onto your butts.\n\nYou can follow Jurassic Outpost on Twitter @JurassicOutpost and find the work that Jack and the team do over at https://jurassicoutpost.com/.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

But on our way to JURASSIC PARK, we got a bit lost and ended up in A FAR OFF PLACE - the directorial debut of ALWAYS cinematographer Mikael Salomon and one of the earliest roles for future Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon. Released by Walt Disney Pictures, the coming of age adventure drama has fallen into obscurity, forgotten by most including, seemingly, Disney themselves. We dig into why that might be, all the while reflecting on where Amblin is at this juncture, while Josh reflects on his past as a high jumper.

For this episode we’re joined by our resident expert on the matter (she’s seen it three times in the theatre!) Emily Tatham, who helps bring the requisite amount of chaos to a discussion of a movie about a play that goes horribly wrong. Together we take a journey through Bogdanovich’s tumultuous career, pitch our own Roger Corman pictures, practise our Michael Caine impressions and try not to slip on the sardines. We also try to make time to talk about whether it’s possible to successfully adapt something so dependent on the live sage, what’s required when transitioning a work to the big screen and whether Michael Frayn’s play loves or hates actors. But will we remember to hit our marks on the night? Join us and find out!\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Together, we chart the map of development, discuss Spielberg’s own apathy towards the final product, the fairy dust of nostalgia, screaming housekeepers and Maggie Smith’s horny eyes.\n\nSo, don’t be a boil-dripping beef, fart-sniffing bubble butt - think happy thoughts, hit play and join us on our adventure to Neverland.

Sorry for the hiatus, one of your fine feathered hosts got struck down with dreaded ‘rona. Don’t sweat it though Ramblin’ fans, as we’re back on the saddle to continue our epic journey through the valley of Amblin Entertainment. That’s right we’re back in the Old West, this time with an animated mouse, with our look at sequel ‘An American Tail: Fievel Goes West’.\n\nWe’re joined by our old pal - film journalist Barry Levitt (@blevitt93) - to chart our travels on to the dusty town of Green River, home to even more nefarious cats and one gassy sheriff, old dog Wiley Burp (James Stewart in his final film role). We go deep into the creation of Amblimation, Spielberg’s very own animation house, and how a lot of hopes were hinged on the return of Fievel and the Mousekewitz family. But does the Don Bluth-less sequel match up to his heartfelt original? Join us and find out!\n\nJosh Glenn would also like to let everyone know that The Matrix Resurrections is out now on all home entertainment formats.\n\nYou can follow Barry on Twitter and Letterboxd @blevitt93 , and catch his writing over at Looper, i-D and SlashFilm.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to like and subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Pinafore but on Martin Scorsese’s impressionistic river ride into the dark underside of America. That’s right, we’re talking 1991’s CAPE FEAR! Along for the ride is multi-hyphenate film journalist Hanna Flint (@HannaFlint), who helps us unpack its strange production history, its relationship to the noirish original, and how Marty warped an Amblin blockbuster towards his particular sensibilities. Oh, and most importantly, Max Cady’s wardrobe. It’s a weird time for the Spielberg/Kennedy/Marshall production house, there’s no doubt, but this outlier certainly sends us to heaven before sending us to hell!\n\nYou can follow Hanna on Twitter @HannaFlint as well as listen to her Fade To Black and First Film Club podcasts whenever you get your podcasts!\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

In this episode, we take you on a journey from the deep jungles of Venezuela to Canaima, California, as we follow the adventures of Big Bob, a lovable previously unknown species of spider who has plans to make it big in the USA. On his way he finds love and starts a family, but quickly becomes the target of a community resistant to change and new ideas. Can Big Bob make them see that just because something’s different, doesn’t mean it’s bad?\n\nJoin us as we… wait, what do you mean that’s not what this is? Oh… strap in for thrills, creepy crawly chills and goofy guffaws as we untangle the web of Frank Marshall’s directorial debut - the ‘thrill-omedy’ ‘Arachnophobia’. From fang-tastic animatronics to Jimmy Buffet songs and a handsome Jeff Daniels, no dark corner or cereal box is left unexplored. We even tuck into some Amblin news with our thoughts on the first Jurassic World: Dominion trailer and more!

Fellow Warwick grad Robin Kerrison (@robinjames_) joins us on the proverbial locomotive, and together we ponder how adorable Doc and Clara are, how thrilling that steam train climax is, and how Jules and Verne are somewhat… unsettling. So don your ponchos, get your frisbees ready and pop on some ZZ Top – it’s time to say goodbye to our favourite time travellers.

The first in the unofficial Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan ‘meet cute’ trilogy, Joe is a stranger film than its appearance may lead you to believe. We won’t be making our voyage to Waponi Woo alone, as we are joined by BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra film critic Ali Plumb for our discussion.

So, before we hit the wilderness of the 90s, join us for a look back over the decade that was, as we reveal a number of categories that allow us to ramble once again about some of our favourite aspects of the journey so far. We explore characters, actors, music and dogs before culminating in our individual top fives, as well as revealing the results of the listener poll for best Amblin movie of the 80s. Is it all very self-indulgent? You bet it is, but we hope you enjoy it all the same.\n\nThanks again to everyone who voted in the listener poll, to all our guests so far and to you all for listening.

Climb aboard as we take off in our podcasting cockpit once again to fly over the rich canopy of Amblin Entertainment. In this episode, our attention turns to Steven Spielberg’s ‘Always’ from 1989, the last 80’s Amblin movie. Strap in as we battle the flames of this romantic drama, itself a remake of 1943’s ‘A Guy Named Joe’, trying our darndest to evaluate just why this isn’t one of Spielberg’s more widely discussed ventures. And as an extra game, try and count how many times Josh employs his distraction tactic of changing the subject to literally anything else.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Part II'! That’s right, gang, it’s time to load up Mr Fusion and set the time circuits to 1989 as the Ramblin boys return from their hiatus to talk about Robert Zemeckis’ looney sci-fi sequel. Returning guest Dan Kelly (@DeekingAround on Twitter) is also along for the ride, which covers such storied ground as the disappearance of Crispin Glover, the mistreatment of Jennifer, the under-rated talents of Thomas F. Wilson and the prophetic Trumpiness of alternate-1985 Biff.

A special thanks as always to Emily Tatham for the artwork, and Robert J. Hunter & Greg Sheffield for the theme music.\n\nAllow us to introduce you to ‘Dad’, the Amblin movie that very few seem to know exists. Despite starring Hollywood legend Jack Lemmon, ‘Cheers’ star Ted Danson and a young Ethan Hawke hot on the heels of ‘Dead Poets Society’, this multi-generational comedy-drama is a film that has very little cultural footprint (and a sparse IMDB trivia page). We take a look at how it came to be and offer our thoughts as to why this is one film in the Amblin canon that seems to have drifted into relative obscurity.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: The film and our conversation touch on emotionally loaded themes such as bereavement, terminal illness, dementia and parental relationships that some listeners may find sensitive.\n\nAs mentioned in the episode, check out the delightful video of the 'Dead Poets Society' cast taking New York City while auditioning for 'Dad': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1eOYkQpifk\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

Don Bluth’s second and final Amblin movie sees a group of young dinosaurs making an incredible journey to find the Great Valley, all within 59 minutes. We put together our own herd by inviting our two friends, Nicole Davis and Michael Perry to make the pilgrimage across Bluth’s prehistoric landscape with us. Along the way, we encounter a troubled production history, stumble over a crater of 13 direct to video sequels, and unearth Josh’s Irish brontosaurus impression.

Director Robert Zemeckis, along with producer Stephen Spielberg, somehow convinces Disney to bankroll a live-action/animation hybrid containing a plethora of characters from rival studios, lurid film noir plotting and the libido of a teenage boy. How did he do it? What was its effect on blockbuster cinema? And who did set-up that little cartoon leporid? All of this and more will be explored in this episode, as the Ramblin boys - joined by Anton film executive Jack Buckley - crack open the case file for ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’ and examine the gloriously bizarre delights within. So hop in Bennie, the cartoon taxicab, and join us for the ride!\n\nYou can follow Jack over on Twitter (@buckleyjack) and Instagram (also @buckleyjack) to keep up with his various film and Love Island-related witterings.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!

To check it out, we’ve invited our guest, writer and friend Steph Brandhuber (@StephBranded) to see what’s what. We discover some Amazing Stories within concerning a deeply lovable elderly couple, a wannabe artist with a milky beard who grinds everyone’s gears, and of course some incredible 'Fix It' flying machines.

Starring a young Christian Bale in a tale that offers a unique perspective of World War Two, we dive into the underrated Spielberg war epic, admiring its use of imagery and exploring its relationship with its source material to deliver a story about makeshifts community and a loss of innocence against the grand scale of worldwide conflict.\n\nFollow the podcast on Twitter (@RamblinAmblin) and be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode!
