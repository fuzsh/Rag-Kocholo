        "text": "One morning last month, Lady Antonia Fraser was stuck in a security line at the Toronto Airport and missed her plane. She didn’t mind, because she had a Kindle and spent the time reading a novel. When the next flight got her safely to New York, she checked into the Peninsula Hotel, ordered lunch from room service, then took a swim in the rooftop pool. Back in her room, she got dressed: ivory embroidered jacket, black crêpe skirt, patent-leather slingbacks, and a pearl necklace dangling a gold “A,” which Stella Powell-Jones, one of her eighteen grandchildren, had brought her from Istanbul. Her publisher, Nan Talese, picked her up in a chauffeured Mercedes. They rode down to the home of the Classic Stage Company, on East Thirteenth Street, where Lady Antonia had been invited to a dress rehearsal of two plays by her late husband, Harold Pinter, which were being put on by the Atlantic Theatre Company.\n\nKnown for best-selling historical biographies of Marie Antoinette and others, Lady Antonia, who is seventy-eight, has just published “Must You Go?,” a memoir of her thirty-three-year relationship with Pinter.* The book has drawn notice not just for its “Tolstoyan directness of feeling” (Financial Times), its gossip (Warren Beatty tried to pick her up), and its portrayal of a fading literary twilight (“Splendid party included twenty poets,” Lady Antonia noted in her diary) but also for tenderizing Pinter, whose characters tend to be virtuosos of verbal and emotional brutality. Lady Antonia’s memoir reveals the playwright as a devoted husband who wrote love poetry to his wife and held to their agreement never to go to bed angry.\n\nLady Antonia settled into an armchair in a room above the theatre. “I think people were expecting to find that our marriage was filled with morbid silences and pauses,” she said with a laugh, as she sipped white wine from a paper cup. “People thought they knew what Harold was like—this brooding menace.” She was in her forties, a successful writer married to a Conservative Member of Parliament, with six children, when she fell in love with Pinter, a left-winger who was married to the actress Vivien Merchant. The day she confessed the affair to her husband, Pinter came over and the two men had a drink and “discussed cricket at length, then the West Indies, then Proust.” Lady Antonia and Pinter married in 1980.\n\n“The first night we were actually together in the same house, Harold was reading to me, his own sketches, and I fell asleep,” she said. “The next morning Harold said, ‘At first, I was a bit disconcerted, but then I just carried on reading.’ ”\n\n“Grandma!”\n\nStella Powell-Jones bounded into the room. She is twenty-three, the daughter of Lady Antonia’s daughter Flora, and she is working as John Guare’s assistant on his new play, “A Free Man of Color.”\n\n“Stella! You look absolutely lovely!”\n\n“Mummy sat in on tech rehearsal today—it was so fun!” Powell-Jones said.\n\nSomeone announced that it was curtain time. The plays were “The Collection,” a dark tale of adultery, and “A Kind of Alaska,” inspired by Oliver Sacks’s “Awakenings.” Afterward, Lady Antonia pronounced the production excellent and posed with the cast for a photograph.\n\nShe went to dinner with Talese and Powell-Jones at a bistro around the corner. Talese said, “I remember a dinner Gay”—her husband—“and I gave for your book ‘Faith and Treason.’ There was a political discussion, and Harold said exactly what he thought to Abe Rosenthal and Henry Grunwald. No one ever, ever spoke to them straight out that way! And they got up and left! Gay was thrilled.”\n\nPinter died, of cancer, in 2008. The last poem he wrote to his wife begins, “I shall miss you so much when I’m dead.”\n\n“I’ll always remember my tears when he read it to me,” Lady Antonia said. “And Harold was so pleased with himself. He said, ‘But it’s so original, isn’t it!’ ”\n\nShe continued, “These love poems to me—Harold would say, ‘Well this is totally private, I shan’t offer it for publication.’ Next thing I knew, it was in the Guardian.\n\n“Harold was continuously interesting,” she went on. “You never knew what he was going to say. Now, if he could come back, what I’d really like to do is just go out to dinner with him at the local Italian restaurant we went to all the time and sort of chat about things. That’s what I would like best of all. More than a first night or anything.”\n\n“I remember how he was so unbelievably good at children’s party games,” Powell-Jones said. “Do you remember, Grandma, the way he could make noises?”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“And if he had you on his knee he was so fascinating, the way he could seem to control the whole world when you were small.” ♦"
