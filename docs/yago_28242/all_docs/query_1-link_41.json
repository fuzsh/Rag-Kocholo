        "text": "Jane Gray (b.1931)\n\nStained Glass Window Design for Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser (1980)\n\nWatercolour and pencil\n\n30.5 x 16 cm\n\nSigned lower right corner. Dated on backboard.\n\nHarold Pinter and Antonia Fraser married in London in November 1980, five years after they first met, and only a few months after Gray commenced designing this impressive stained glass window for their house at 52 Campden Hill Square in London. Her notes surrounding the design give insights into her process and the themes and imagery she wished the design to contain such as: Harold and Antonia’s initials, cricket, hollyhocks, butterflies, medallions of test matches.\n\nProvenance: the artist’s studio sale.\n\nCondition: very good.\n\nIf you are interested, please email info@manningfineart.co.uk or call us on 07929 749056."
