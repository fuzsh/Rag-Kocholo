        "text": "A memoir composed entirely of short diary entries, even one that starts in 1975 with a scandalous romance, doesn't naturally invite a reader. Even when it describes a famous British playwright and his biographer-paramour-turned-wife.\n\nBut such is Lady Antonia Fraser's straightforward style that she easily drew me into her memoir of her 33 years with Harold Pinter.\n\n\"Must You Go? My Life With Harold Pinter\" rises above arty, upper-crust gossip, elevated largely by Fraser's observational skills.\n\nThe married, middle-age Pinter asked the title question at a London party where he encountered Fraser, a mother of six wed to a member of Parliament. She lingered through the January night, and their intense attraction caught fire.\n\n\"There had been romances,\" writes Fraser, a Catholic curiously blas about the tenets of her faith. \"But I had never for one moment envisaged leaving my marriage.\"\n\nWithin weeks, Pinter confesses to his wife, the actress Vivien Merchant, who reacts with rage, and Fraser told her husband, Hugh. He and Pinter met calmly, over cocktails, and talked wives and cricket.\n\nThe author of \"Mary, Queen of Scots\" and \"The Wives of Henry VIII\" moved in with Pinter, as did her children when they weren't away at school. Five years later, they married, and remained together until his 2008 death from esophageal cancer.\n\nPinter's plays -- \"Betrayal\" being the best-known in the United States -- were marbled with cynicism, but Fraser paints him as an unremitting romantic with her. She touches on the circle of famous friends -- actor Robert Shaw, author Samuel Beckett (he and Pinter discuss who is gloomier) and Salman Rushdie, with his parade of wives.\n\nFraser writes that Pinter was especially shaken by Shaw's sudden 1978 death, because \"he died, in effect, of drink. Harold has promised me he won't.\" Pinter might have cut back, but we sense that the liquor continued to flow.\n\nThe diary can be tightly vivid: Princess Diana is a \"tall crimson streak\" at Kensington Palace. And when Fraser and Pinter both fall platonically in love with director Mike Nichols, she writes, \"We have become not only more intelligent and even witty (no one is funnier than Mike) but more glamorous.\" Hard to imagine.\n\n\"Must You Go\" also provides snippets of political activism. The couple crusade against the Pinochet regime in Chile and visit the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel to march in Czechoslovakia:\n\n\"I see Harold's and Havel's faces, close together, dark and fair, in the lighting of the street amid pools of darkness, like a picture by Rembrandt; both animated, and animated also by the human condition.\"\n\nAlso bracing are the glimpses of artistic inspiration. Pinter would spark to a sentence someone uttered, write it on a cocktail napkin, and enter a feverish state of writing. The house was always happiest when he was creating, she recalls.\n\nFraser is prolific, too, turning out some two dozen books. Sofia Coppola based her 2006 movie, \"Marie Antoinette,\" on Fraser's biography.\n\nAs Fraser writes of her diary -- which she allowed Pinter to read at times -- \"It's not about great writing. It's my friend, my record, and sometimes my consolation.\""
