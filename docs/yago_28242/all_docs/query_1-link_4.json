        "text": "It's the most eagerly awaited book of the year.Starting today, Lady Antonia Fraser tells the story of her secret affair with playwright Harold Pinter: How it ended two marriages, scandalised Britain - and brought her a lifetime of intoxicating passion.\n\nThree days before Christmas 2008, at 7am, Harold collapsed. All round us, as we left by ambulance for Hammersmith Hospital, were the preparations for a family Christmas lunch. There was the Christmas tree in the window and presents underneath it.\n\nIn the London square where we lived, people were already getting their houses ready for the traditional Christmas Eve ritual of candles in all the windows. (When I returned home, the square would be in darkness except for flickering candlelight, which seemed to be a salutation to Harold.)\n\nLiterary affair: Lady Antonia Fraser relaxes at the cricket with Harold Pinter\n\nThe ambulance took us through streets full of cheerful, busy people shopping urgently, holding parcels and children by the hand.\n\nHarold to me as he lay waiting for a bed: 'What are your plans,' pause, 'generally?'\n\nIt was our last real conversation. I replied: 'First of all, I'm going to have wonderful support from family and friends, but by the way, you're not dead yet. Secondly, I'm going to pop home for a short while to preside over Christmas lunch.'\n\nThe last word I heard him say was 'the key'. It seemed to be a question.\n\nBy the evening, he was unconscious.\n\nDECEMBER 24, 2008\n\nHarold very calm and still. In the late morning, all the grandchildren who were in England came to visit him and give him a last kiss. Their ages ranged from 21 to eight, all shapes and sizes. The scene was like a Victorian painting called Farewell To A Grandfather.\n\nAbout 7.20pm, I was sitting reading Tolstoy's Resurrection by Harold's bedside. He was breathing but with a strong rattling sound. The nurses were outside.\n\n'His dear body was already quite cool. Must you go? Yes, it was time. Before I left the room, after another, last kiss, I said: \"Goodnight, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing you to your rest.\"'\n\nThe children and grandchildren had dispersed for Christmas. I was alone in the room. I was happy like that.\n\nSuddenly the rattling stopped. Harold opened his black eyes very wide, almost staring, although he didn't respond when I spoke to him as before: 'It's me, Antonia, who loves you.'\n\nThen he went quite tense, his whole body. Finally he went still and silent. I leant forward and found no breath. He looked white and dead. I sat for a while. Then I kissed him. His dear body was already quite cool.\n\nMust you go? Yes, it was time. Before I left the room, after another, last kiss, I said: 'Goodnight, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing you to your rest.'\n\nI first saw Harold across a crowded room, but it was lunchtime, not some enchanted evening, and we did not speak.\n\nI was having lunch in the Etoile restaurant in Charlotte Street, Soho; my companion pointed to a trio of men lunching opposite us.\n\nThey were in fact Harold and the actors Robert Shaw and Donald Pleasence; and they were discussing Robert's play, The Man In The Glass Booth, in which Harold would be directing Donald.\n\nLovers: A candid snap of the couple together during their passionate romance\n\nMy companion admired Robert Shaw intensely: the handsome red-headed star who embodied machismo. Apparently, I said thoughtfully: 'I'll take the dark one.'\n\nOn the next occasion, I heard Harold's baritone voice before we met - at a recital about Mary Queen Of Scots, based on my biography, at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nHarold's wife Vivien Merchant took the part of Mary, an actor took all the male parts and I read the narrative.\n\nThese were professionals and I was intensely nervous; a friend told me afterwards that my knees were visibly shaking in my natty white trouser suit, which had perhaps been the wrong call as a costume.\n\nNevertheless things were running along smoothly - Vivien was an accomplished reader who gave Mary the correct Scottish accent - when suddenly there was some kind of interruption, a man's voice raised, at the back of the gallery.\n\nAfterwards I inquired rather crossly what had happened. 'Oh, that was Harold Pinter,' I was told. 'He attacked the attendant for opening the door in the middle of the recital.'\n\n'I didn't hear the door,' I muttered, having just learned that the projected LP of the recital would have to be abandoned due to the disturbance. Later, when I was introduced to Harold, I asked him if it had indeed been him.\n\n'Yes,' he replied with satisfaction, 'I do that kind of thing all the time.' (In similar situations in the future, I sometimes reflected wryly: 'I can't say I wasn't warned ...') And so to the evening of January 8, 1975, when I went to the first night of Harold's play The Birthday Party at the Shaw Theatre, directed by Kevin Billington, husband of my sister Rachel.\n\nThe author was of course there, and there was to be a dinner party afterwards at the Billingtons' house in Holland Park.\n\nBetrayal: The writer with her first husband Hugh Fraser\n\nAt this point, we - my husband Hugh Fraser and I, Harold and Vivien - had all been married for exactly the same period. It was 18 years since Harold and Vivien had got married in a register office in Bournemouth (they were in rep there), while I had dolled myself up as Mary Queen of Scots and Hugh had worn a kilt at the Catholic Church in Warwick Street, Soho, and had a full sung Nuptial Mass.\n\nNow Hugh and I had six children; Harold and Vivien had one son. Hugh had been a Conservative MP since 1945; Vivien was a celebrated actress. I was 42; Harold was 44.\n\nI considered myself to be happily married, or at any rate happy in my marriage; I admired Hugh for his cavalier nature, his high spirits, his courage, his independence, his essential decency and kindness.\n\nI even admired him for his detachment, although his lack of emotional intimacy - he once told me he preferred families to individuals - was with hindsight probably what doomed us.\n\nI, on the other hand, was intensely romantic and always had been since early childhood; the trouble with romantics is that they tend to gravitate towards other like-minded people, or people they choose to regard as such.\n\nSo there had been romances. But I had never for one moment envisaged leaving my marriage.\n\nHarold, I learned much later, did not consider himself to be happily married. He, too, had had his romances, perhaps more than the world, which cast him as the dark, brooding playwright, realised.\n\nLater, he also told me that he had never been in love before, but had once loved Vivien very much, her essential vulnerability inspiring him with a wish to protect her, before other matters drove them apart. They led essentially separate lives in a stately six-storey house in Regent's Park Terrace; but he, too, had never contemplated leaving his marriage.\n\nJANUARY 8, 1975\n\nA very enjoyable dinner party at Rachel and Kevin's house. I was slightly disappointed not to sit next to the playwright, who looked full of energy, with black curly hair and pointed ears like a satyr. Gradually the guests filtered away and some neighbours offered me a lift.\n\n'Wait a minute,' I said. 'I must just say goodbye to Harold Pinter and tell him I enjoyed the play; I haven't said hello all evening.'\n\nI went over to where Harold was sitting. 'Wonderful play, marvellous acting, now I'm off.' He looked at me with those amazing, extremely bright black eyes. 'Must you go?' he said.\n\nI thought of home, my lift, taking the children to school the next morning, the exhausting past night that I'd spent in the sleeper from Scotland, my projected biography of King Charles II . . . 'No, it's not absolutely essential,' I said.\n\nAbout 2.30am, we were the last guests. In the end, it was Harold who gave me a lift home, in a white car with a driver (he never drove at night, having once been found 'weaving' in Regent's Park).\n\nI offered him coffee. I actually gave him champagne. He stayed until 6am with extraordinary recklessness, but of course the real recklessness was mine.\n\nWe sometimes speculated later what would have happened if I had in fact answered: 'Yes, I really must go.' Harold, convinced by then that I was his destiny, would gallantly reply: 'I would have found you somehow.'\n\nHolidays: Fraser and Pinter visit New York in July 1976\n\nBut we had few friends in common: the novelist Edna O'Brien was one, and the film producer Sam Spiegel another. Fundamentally we lived in different worlds. The night of January 8/9 was our chance.\n\nSubsequently, much was made of our different backgrounds, the working-class Jewish boy from the East End and the Catholic aristocrat with her title. But we were a long way from our backgrounds.\n\nAlthough Harold was technically born into the working class - his father worked in a tailoring factory - ever since the success of his play The Caretaker in 1960, he had been extremely well-off by most standards.\n\nAgain technically, since my father was an earl and my mother a countess, I could be argued to be an aristocrat. But my father, born Frank Pakenham, only succeeded to the Earldom of Longford when I was nearly 30; my childhood was spent in a modest north Oxford house, my father, with no private income, teaching at the University.\n\nMy mother, being a Harley Street doctor's daughter, was in any case convinced that the middle classes were the salt of the earth, whereas the aristocracy was feckless, unpunctual and extravagant, an assumption that our beloved father's attitude to life did nothing to discourage.\n\nI had no inherited money and had earned my own living since the age of 21. After the publication of Mary Queen Of Scots, an unexpected bestseller in 1969, I found that for the first time in my life I had money to spend.\n\nMost of it went on the delightful task of renovating Eilean Aigas, our house in the Highlands.\n\nThe truth was that by the mid-Seventies, both in our different ways successful writers, Harold and I belonged to the same class: I will call it the Bohemian class.\n\nJANUARY 13\n\nWhile I was away, Harold apparently called home on the public line; on Monday morning he called on my private line - I'm not sure how he got the number. We met for a drink at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in Bayswater ('an obscure place' he said truthfully) at 6pm.\n\nThe bar was very dark and at first I couldn't see him. That made it all the more like a dream. But 'so it wasn't all a dream' was the verdict of us both at the end. Told me of numerous obsessional phone calls - no answer - often from the telephone box opposite my home in Campden Hill Square.\n\nSeparate lives: Harold Pinter with his first wife Vivien\n\nHarold has evidently told my brother-in-law Kevin Billington about the whole thing! Can't say I care. 'I am loopy about you: I feel 18' was the general theme; I said I preferred the word 'dippy'.\n\nThe truth is that Harold has mesmerised me. Kept waking all night on the subject of a) him b) my 14-year-old son Benjie's departure for boarding school at Ampleforth. But a) has quite taken my mind off the horrible sadness of b). .\n\nJANUARY 23\n\nMet Harold at 5.30 in the Royal Lancaster Hotel (he has telephoned daily). Parted at 11.30 to our respective matrimonial homes. We never left the bar, just talked and talked.\n\nDiscussed among other things No Man's Land, his new play - to open at the National in April - and how he started to write it. He had sent me the typescript after our first meeting.\n\nI am quite obsessed by him when I am with him. He tells me he is quite obsessed by me all the time - the days spent waiting to telephone, etc. Described his life as a kind of prison - how, when can we meet, ever?\n\nJANUARY 26\n\nThought of Harold. I suppose I'm in love with him, but there are many other things in my life. Yet: 'oh, oh, the insomniac moonlight' in the words of the Scottish poet Liz Lochhead.\n\nJANUARY 30\n\nHarold called. He asks: 'Does it make you happy that we met? You wouldn't rather we hadn't met?'\n\nCandid camera: The pair during their time in New York in 1976\n\nFEBRUARY 1\n\nI knew it would be a good day. Harold rang up in the morning and said: 'Tea is on', having said two days ago: 'The situation is fluid.' Went at 4pm, discreetly parking in another street.\n\nHis house in Regent's Park Terrace is vast and extremely sumptuous. A lot of large, beautiful, modern pictures in huge quiet rooms, apparently unlimited in number.\n\nHarold made tea. We went upstairs to the greeny-grey drawing room: vast pictures, few objects, greeny-grey light, enormous quantity of chairs and low sofas. 'I will show you my study presently.'\n\nAnd he did. To the top of the house, sixth floor in fact, we went up and up, like Tom Kitten. Windows overlooking Regent's Park. A desk. A chaise longue. A few chairs. Lots of books - novels and poetry. Harold presented me with his poems.\n\n'I would make a good secretary if you ever needed one,' I said. He said: 'The same thought had already crossed my mind.'\n\nFEBRUARY 9\n\nJoyous, dangerous and unavoidable - Harold's three words to Kevin Billington about us, quoted by Harold to me on the telephone. Not bad Pinteresque words.\n\nFEBRUARY 19\n\nOn Sunday, Harold called to say that Vivien is in Hong Hong, very ill (pneumonia), with the dreadful possibility of not being able to go on and film Picnic At Hanging Rock in Australia - something she really wanted to do. He is racked with guilt. Nevertheless, we met for drinks in the bar of the Churchill Hotel (twice).\n\nFEBRUARY 21\n\nBought works about Harold at Foyles to feed my obsession. Seems to be in the class of Shakespeare, judging by the nonsense that is talked... gave me a buzz all the same.\n\nFEBRUARY 22\n\nHarold is with Vivien in Hong Kong, and has written me two poems, one short, one very long, which he read to me twice.\n\nThis was the short one: I\n\nknow the place It is true.\n\nEverything we do\n\nConnects the space\n\nBetween death and me,\n\nAnd you.\n\nThis one became a favourite poem of Harold's to mark this stage in our lives and he often recited it. However, I protested about the comma after 'me', which divided us and left him on the side of death and it was eliminated (although not put immediately after 'death' as I wanted!).\n\nFEBRUARY 22, CONT.\n\n'I always wanted to be in love. Ever since I was a little girl. And I always wanted to know a genius, which I suppose Harold sort of is, but that did not lure me to him in the first place.'\n\nHe really seems mad with love. His love letters are extraordinary. From time to time, he writes in his large, clear unmistakeable handwriting: 'I'm calm. Calm', and then he bursts out again, now with a big love letter, now with an extravagant poem, accompanied by a note: 'This came out of the lonely middle of a desperate night thousands of miles from you, your image thudding in my skull. Don't be alarmed by it.'\n\nFEBRUARY 24\n\nMy brother-in-law came round and we had an extremely intense conversation; beginning of course with much embarrassment, as up to that point we were friendly but not close.'It's very serious for Harold,' he said, and added: 'I speak as Harold's friend and not because of our family relationship.'\n\nMe: 'It's quite different for me... I haven't known anything like this before - or perhaps once years ago, but ever since I have tried to guard myself.' Kevin: 'I'm very glad.'\n\nFEBRUARY 25\n\nDrink with Edna O'Brien, at her request. She looked like a beautiful fortune-teller in her shawl by the fire, me her client.\n\n'He's much enraptured,' she said. Then: 'I'm glad this is happening to him. Last summer when he was writing No Man's Land, I almost thought - well,' she hesitated.\n\n'He says he was waiting for death,' I replied.\n\nFEBRUARY 28\n\nLots of poems have arrived on banana-coloured hotel paper. I keep them in my handbag and read and reread.\n\nOne of them is the strongest love poem I have ever received.\n\nHarold came back, with Vivien, on March 10.\n\nMARCH 11\n\nEverything is now all right. A knock. He was there. He clutched me and we clutched each other. At first it was almost desperate, he had suffered so much. Finally, he said: 'I feel like a new man.'\n\nMARCH 13\n\nMet at the Stafford Hotel. We talked and talked. Where is all this passion leading? The trouble is - when I am with him, I don't care about anything, and when I am not with him I don't care much either as I am always thinking about him.\n\nMARCH 16\n\nToday Harold caused me a great deal of heart-beating terror by announcing he was going to tell Vivien: 'I don't want to pretend I'm on a lecture tour,' he said.\n\nI suppose I'm used to being on that 'lecture tour' and it seems a perfectly good way of life. But Harold's force is burning me up and fascinating me all at the same time.\n\nMARCH 22/23\n\nWeekend of considerable tension. Harold rang up Sunday evening and said he had told Vivien on Saturday: 'I've met somebody.' Her rage at his dishonesty in deceiving her. Vivien says about me: 'She's a very bonny lady.' But with whisky and nightfall, more rage at the deception.\n\nI did not know at this point that Vivien was on her way to being a serious alcoholic; a condition which would lead to her death in her early 50s.\n\nMARCH 24\n\nIn a way, it is unfair for Vivien to pick on the deception as opposed to Harold's feelings, as he has always wanted to tell her about us; he couldn't before she went away and certainly couldn't when she fell ill. But nothing is fair in love (or war), whatever they say.\n\nFor the first time, I faced up to what another life would be like and whether it could ever exist. Or would be right. Right for whom? Never right for some.\n\nI always wanted to be in love. Ever since I was a little girl. And I always wanted to know a genius, which I suppose Harold sort of is, but that did not lure me to him in the first place. I was lured, compelled by a superior force, something drawn out of me by him, which was simply irresistible.\n\nAPRIL 20\n\nHugh asked this morning: 'Are you in love with someone else?' I don't think he expected to get the answer 'Yes! I am madly in love with someone else.' After a bit I told him who it was.\n\nHugh, grimly: 'The best living playwright. Very suitable.' Then: 'How old is he?' Me: 'My age.' Hugh: 'Well, that's also very suitable.'\n\nThe next weeks were agonising for all concerned.\n\nAPRIL 23\n\nMet Harold for lunch and gave him my lucky agate to hold in his sweaty palm at the first night of No Man's Land. Went to the theatre with the Billingtons and my brother Thomas. Drink in the upstairs bar.\n\nSuddenly Harold walked in. Transfixed. Both of us. Could hardly speak or look at him. 'Hello, Antonia,' and hand outstretched: a very deep gravelly voice.\n\nLater Harold telephoned me from the first-night party at [the director] Peter Hall's flat in the Barbican.\n\n'I watched you when you walked across the front of the stalls going to your seat after the interval. I liked your dress. You looked so beautiful.'\n\nI still have the dress.\n\nAPRIL 24\n\nThis morning the Daily Mail blew the gaff, talking of 'a literary friendship'. So that's what they call it these days!\n\nAPRIL 25\n\nHarold is leaving Vivien and moving into Sam Spiegel's flat - 'So that murder shall not take place,' he says. It's difficult to comment on this because up till the other night, I had thought their marriage a happy one (albeit not perfect... because perfect marriages if they exist are immune from late-night romantic encounters).\n\nAPRIL 28\n\nHarold very low. The prospect of going to Paris together seems to cheer.\n\nMAY 5-15\n\nIn Paris at the Hotel Lancaster. We had our suite, Harold's famous emphasis on suites! A sitting room, tres charmant, a large bedroom and another one for me - I insisted on that for telephonic reasons.\n\nHarold met me at Charles de Gaulle Airport; I floated up in the new moving passageway as in a dream towards him. Chauffeurdriven car (another great obsession).\n\nThereafter we lived in our suite and went to restaurants and never really did anything for ten days. We did take small walks, ending rapidly in bars. Harold drinks a hell of an amount.\n\nMAY 16-17\n\nHarold in a terrible state about money although he seems to me to earn a fortune. I think worrying about money is a substitute for worrying about the future.\n\nMAY 22\n\nLong, long talk with Mummy [Lady Longford] about everything. She showed much brilliance in achieving her objective, which was to keep me approximately married to Hugh.\n\n'You note I am not talking about sanctity of family life.' Tells me meaningful stories of her friends whose lovers chucked them for younger women, and is annoyed when I smile.\n\nLater ... Harold: 'I want you to know that the way I am thinking is that I want to live with you.' Then: 'In 20 years' time, we wouldn't have this sort of crisis, because we would be 64 and 62.'\n\nMe, thinking of Lady Longford: 'What about younger women?' Harold (furious): 'I like mature women, doesn't she realise? I am a boy at heart, ever 18, so naturally I like mature women.'\n\nJUNE 2\n\nI love Harold, I adore him, but am I capable of uprooting myself for anyone? Do I have the courage? I am quite a cowardly person, I know. If only we could just go on and on being lovers... I fear for the effects of everyday life on love.\n\nJUNE 11\n\nCoffee at Grosvenor House with Harold. Very hot day. Wore new white pique dress with pink-and-blue stone necklace. Harold hugged me. 'I love you and want to marry you.' (He had not used those exact words before).\n\nAfterwards I question it, the whole idea. Harold: 'No, I like being married. I think we had better get married.'\n\nI said nothing although it is quite like being in a car of gathering speed going to the sea and still not quite making up my mind whether I intend to bathe or not. Exhilarating. And frightening. Later that evening, Harold said: 'I proposed to you today and you said you would think it over.'\n\nJUNE 12\n\nWent to Edinburgh for the launching of my anthology, Scottish Love Poems. In the lift on the way down from my hotel room I decided: 'Yes, I will do it.'\n\nJUNE 13\n\nHarold seems to have guessed that I will say 'Yes'. We went to the Belvedere Restaurant in Holland Park. I took a deep breath and with a kind of heat in my face rather than a blush: 'What I am trying to say,' I began, 'is that if you asked me to marry you now, I would accept you.'\n\nJUNE 14\n\nThe next day, I had to tell my husband. It was beyond anything ghastly, beginning with the moment when I fetched him inside from the thunderous garden where he was smoking and reading the FT.\n\nIn the end, I summoned Harold round. He drank whisky, Hugh drank brandy. I sat. In a surreal scene, Hugh and Harold discussed cricket at length, then the West Indies, then Proust. I started to go to sleep on the sofa. Harold politely went home. Nothing was decided.\n\nJUNE 19\n\nWrote my mother and father a long letter so that they would understand we could not discuss 'Whether', only 'Why?' and 'When?' One of my mother's dire predictions: 'You will never be accepted in theatrical circles,' made me laugh.\n\n(Later, there was a real friendship between my mother and Harold.)\n\nJUNE 24\n\nMummy says that she will now write me a letter to say that what I am doing is wrong. For Heaven's sake, I'm in my 40s! She never took so much interest in my love life when I was 16; it is a bit late to alter our relationship now.\n\nJUNE 26\n\nGave the prizes at St Philip's Sports Day. Saw my lawyer, who left me with some very sage words which I quoted to Hugh: 'If two sensible, educated, civilised people can't reach agreement about their own children, it is unlikely a court can.' Advice that Hugh and I took to heart.\n\nJUNE 26\n\nPat [wife of the novelist VS Naipaul] came to lunch. She said: 'Oh, poor Antonia! You will be married to a writer over 40 and past his best, of failing creativity.'\n\nVivien is continuing to alternate between rage and despair. In the evening, Harold says: 'In spite of all the grievousness, and it may sound like a woman's magazine, but with you I have found happiness.'\n\nJULY 3-6\n\nHarold pleased me by saying he was looking forward to living with a writer, not an actress, because first nights had been such a strain, the play and the leading lady competing for attention.\n\nJULY 26-27\n\nThese dog days, the dog days of the end of my marriage, are a strange experience of heat and night and telephone calls and frenzy. And also words of love."
