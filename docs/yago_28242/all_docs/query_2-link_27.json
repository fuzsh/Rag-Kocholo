        "text": "Mel Gussow is a drama critic for The New York Times. By Mel Gussow NTONIA FRASER LIVES ON A QUIET, TREE-SHADED square in the Kensington section of London in a large, airy house that she shares with her second husband, the playwright Harold Pinter. With them live the four youngest of her six children by her first marriage, to the late Sir Hugh Fraser. Sitting in her garden on a recent afternoon, Lady Antonia looked softly feminine, a portrait of gentility. A large white picture hat shielded her face from the sun. A wasp buzzed her ear, and she seemed unperturbed. ''I prefer to believe that nature's on my side,'' she said, ''but Harold gets worried,'' and she indicated, high overhead, his response to nature's sting - an electric bug catcher.\n\nLady Antonia is a serious gardener, growing amaryllis from bulbs and bringing them indoors in winter. Her fig tree was soon to be joined by an olive tree, a gift from her husband for her coming 52d birthday. But Lady Antonia at home - as wife, mother and gardener - represents only one aspect of a woman who seems to lead a dozen lives. She is a best-selling historian and biographer, as the author of ''Mary Queen of Scots,'' ''Cromwell,'' ''Royal Charles'' and her 14th book, ''The Weaker Vessel,'' published in America this month, a pioneering study of the suppression of women in 17th-century England. In recent years she has also become a writer of popular mystery novels (the Jemima Shore series, beginning with ''Quiet as a Nun''), which have been adapted to television. In England, her television and radio appearances have added to her celebrity.\n\nBecause she synthesizes beauty, intelligence and artistic talent, she is a kind of heroine to other women, provoking simultaneous feelings of admiration and envy. As one friend says, ''She's a formidable woman. She has a rather regal quality. Sometimes I think she's really the Queen, and the present Queen is the usurper. London would be a very much duller place without her.''\n\nOne might say that Lady Antonia is not so much prolific as generative - in her personal as well as in her professional life. She is devoted to her family and to her friends, and they return the devotion. As Lady Antonia suggests, were she to throw a stone from her garden she might strike any of three brothers, two sisters and several friends of 30 years' standing, all of whom live in the neighborhood.\n\nOf course, she is not about to throw stones, even at those academics who criticize her books as popularizations. One London book critic says that she has a genuinely ambiguous literary reputation. Her work receives respectful reviews - for her impressive research and readability. Her primary strength is her sense of narrative. At the same time some professional historians consider her approach a storybook view of history. She is at her best when dealing with subjects with which she has the greatest personal commitment, such as in ''Mary Queen of Scots'' and her current ''The Weaker Vessel.''\n\nThough she is not a theoretician with opinions about the changing tides of world economics and politics - and does not pretend to be - she is zealous about her need to know as much as can be known about her chosen area and adamant about accuracy. ''If I write that it was a cold day,'' she says, ''you can be sure I know it was a cold day because Pepys told us.'' In America, reviewers have been more willing to meet her on her own terms, as a writer, she says, of ''historical reconstruction.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
