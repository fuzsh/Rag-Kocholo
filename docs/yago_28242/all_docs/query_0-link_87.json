And everyone enjoys a love story, especially when the lovers are famous, adulterous, talented and glamorous. . . . [Must You Go?] is . . . entertaining and ultimately touching in its determination to recapture lost time, to portray a younger, more carefree self, and to bring back a lost loved one, if only on the page.\" --The New York Times",
