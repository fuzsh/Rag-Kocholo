        "text": "Harold Pinter (1930 - 2008)\n\nMr Harold Pinter (Male)\n\nNationality: British\n\nAuthor\n\nBorn: 10 October 1930\n\nDied: 24 December 2008\n\nPlaywright, director, actor, screenwriter and essayist, Harold Pinter was born on 10 October 1930 in Hackney, East London. He was the only son of Frances (née Moskowitz) and Jack Pinter, a Jewish dressmaker.\n\nHe married Vivien Merchant in 1956. They had a son together, Daniel, born in 1958. They were separated in the 1970s, and divorced in 1980, when Pinter married the writer Antonia Fraser, with whom he lived in Holland Park, London, until his death in 2008.\n\nPinter recalled a happy childhood, though he was evacuated from London during World War Two to Cornwall, and later shorter stays in Reading and Yorkshire. He was brought up in the Jewish faith, and studied for his Bar Mitzvah at the Lea Bridge Road shul in 1943, but indicated to his parents that he would not participate further in the religion in 1945. He was educated at the Hackney Downs Boys’ Grammar School, where he established what would be lifetime friendships with Henry Woolf, Mick Goldstein and others of a group remembered as ‘The Hackney Gang’. The schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had a profound impact on Pinter, and the two became friends. Brearley introduced Pinter to renaissance literature and cast him in his first acting roles, in the school plays Macbeth in 1947 and Romeo and Juliet in 1948.\n\nAfter school, Pinter enrolled for a year at RADA in 1948, but was disenchanted with the working methods of the establishment. He later continued his formal training for two terms at Central School of Speech and Drama in 1951. He got his first steady work as an actor in Anew McMaster’s repertory company, touring Ireland in the early 1950s before joining Donald Wolfit’s company at the King’s Theatre, Hammersmith in 1953 for a season.\n\nIn 1957, Woolf asked if Pinter might write a play for him to perform at University in Bristol, where Woolf was studying for an MA in Drama. Pinter responded with The Room. He began working on The Birthday Party later that year, which was performed in London in 1958, though it ran for less than a week. He received commissions to write for the BBC Third Programme, and the radio plays A Slight Ache and A Night Out were broadcast in 1958 and 1960 respectively. His play The Caretaker, which ran for most of the year in 1960, established his name on the London stage and his fame was consolidated by a string of television productions in the early 1960s: A Night Out (1960), Night School (1960), The Collection (1961) and The Lover (1963). In 1963, his first film, as screenplay writer and adaptor, was released (The Servant) initiating a a collaboration with director Joseph Losey which was to produce two other acclaimed films in Accident (1967) and The Go-Between (1969).\n\nHis reputation as a writer of uncompromising and challenging drama was consolidated with The Homecoming in 1965 and Old Times in 1971, both directed by Peter Hall and premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the 1970s he became an associate director of the National Theatre, where his plays No Man’s Land (1974) and Betrayal (1978) were premièred, both again directed by Peter Hall.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s he adopted the public role of political commentator, while turning to more overt political situations in his plays One for the Road (1984), Mountain Language (1988) and Party Time (1991).\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005. The award ceremony speech described his legacy: 'Between the lines of unresolved threats, it roils and stings. What we hear are signals for everything we do not hear. The abyss under chat, the unwillingness to communicate other than superficially, the need to rule and mislead, the suffocating sensation of accidents bubbling under the quotidian, the nervous perception that a dangerous story has been censored – all this vibrates through Pinter’s drama.'\n\nPinter died on 24 December 2008, succumbing to cancer at the age of 78. He left a legacy of twenty-nine dramatic works, numerous sketches, twenty-two screenplays and a significant body of poetry and prose writings, in addition to his one novel. His works are published by Faber and Faber in the UK and Grove Atlantic in the USA.\n\nTraining and Education\n\nSecondary education\n\nHackney Downs Grammar School (Training & Education | Est. 1876)\n\nPinter attended the Hackney Downs Boys' Grammar School between 1944 and 1948.\n\nDrama school\n\nThe Royal Central School of Speech and Drama (Training & Education | Est. 1906)\n\n62-64 Eton Ave, London NW3 3HY, England\n\nKnown at that time as the Central School of Speech and Drama, Pinter spent two terms here between January and July 1951. See Michael Billington, Harold Pinter, 2nd edn (London: Faber and Faber, 2007) p. 31.\n\nDrama school\n\nRoyal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) (Training & Education | Est. 1904)\n\n62-64 Gower St, Bloomsbury, London WC1E 6ED, England\n\nPinter joined RADA for a year in the autumn of 1948, but did not enjoy the ethos of the place. See Michael Billington, Harold Pinter, 2nd edn (London: Faber and Faber, 2007) pp. 20-1.\n\nOther Names\n\nDavid Baron (Stage name)\n\nProductions\n\nFocus on Libraries (1950)\n\nCreative | Presenter\n\nNotes:\n\nFocus on Football Pools (1950)\n\nCreative | Presenter\n\nNotes:\n\nOne Man's City -
