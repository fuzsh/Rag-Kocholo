        "text": "'MUST you go?' It's an inoffensive, social and often insincere phrase, but for Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser, those three words, uttered by him in 1975, were the start of a love affair, and later a marriage, which glowed like an ember for 33 years.\n\nBoth were married; had been in fact for the exact same amount of time -- 18 years. He had one child, she had six, and for both, there had been other affairs. Pinter had a romance with journalist Joan Bakewell for almost eight years while he was married, and was also involved with New York socialite Barbara Stanton, who recently outed their affair and revealed that she had a termination, at the same time. Antonia, something of a femme fatale, also had her romances. In fact Private Eye dubbed her 'Lady Magnesia Freelove' during the Sixties, but this, from the outset, was different. So overwhelming that there was never any real question of conducting it as a discreet extra-marital liaison. Their connection, writes Antonia in her new book, was \"a superior force, something drawn out of me by him, which was simply irresistible\".\n\nHarold Pinter was perhaps the most famous playwright in the world at the time. Born to working-class Jewish parents and brought up in the East End of London, he had been hugely successful since the very early Sixties. He was prolific -- acting, directing and writing screenplays as well as plays -- and, by the time he met Antonia, had wrought an irresistible change on both the English language and theatrical style; 'Pinteresque' had by then already entered the lexicon, although it was a phrase he found meaningless. He was, however, far from the stereotype of the weedy intellectual; rather, he was intense, irascible, vigorous, and masculine to the point of being macho, with a deep, resonant voice, once described as an \"awesome baritone\" by Arthur Miller.\n\nShe, meanwhile, was Lady Antonia Fraser, daughter of Frank Packenham, Seventh Earl of Longford -- he was an often-controversial champion of liberal causes, including the parole of Myra Hindley -- and had all the confident glamour and distant charm of the British aristocracy. Jonathan Aitken, the Conservative MP who served jail time for perjury and was once a close friend of Antonia's, described her as \"a sort of Lady Madonna of the tennis courts ... with a glory of golden hair tumbling over her shoulders, and beautiful Botticelli-like features\". She was also a successful writer -- her Mary Queen of Scots had been a surprise bestseller six years before the fateful meeting. At first, the media -- in a lather of excitement over the affair -- made a big deal about the great disparity in their backgrounds, casting the couple in a kind of 'Princess and the Pauper' relationship to each other, a latter-day, Catholic, Lady Chatterley, with her East End Jewish lover.\n\nIn reality, this was of course nonsense. By the time they met, she was 42, he 44, and both a long way from their backgrounds. Also, he had already made a lot of money through his writing, and this helped to close the gap. As Antonia says in her new book, Must You Go? My Life With Harold Pinter, based on the diaries she kept for all their years together, \"the truth was that by the mid Seventies ... Harold and I belonged to the same class: I will call it the Bohemian class\".\n\nAs part of this Bohemian class, their friends were like an honours list of the world's greatest actors, playwrights and authors, not to mention a fair smattering of high-profile Establishment figures. The diaries are stiff with names: Beckett, Michael Gambon, Simon Gray, Vaclav Havel, Arthur Miller, VS Naipaul, Helen Mirren, Sir John Gielgud, Steve McQueen, Robert Shaw, are all regulars within their circle; even Sarah Jessica Parker puts in a brief appearance, as a small child auditioning for the part of Flora in an adaptation of The Turn of the Screw. But there is little, if any, detail accorded to them, they simply flit in and out of the main action, which is the intense, romantic love affair between Harold and Antonia.\n\nA dinner party given by Antonia's sister Rachel and her husband Kevin Billington, then directing a production of Pinter's The Birthday Party at the Shaw Theatre, was the scene for their decisive encounter. Antonia was \"disappointed\" not to be seated next to Harold, with whom she had previously had a couple of glancing encounters, and who looked \"full of energy, with black curly hair and pointed ears, like a satyr\". When she was due to leave, she decided to go and say goodbye to him. \"Must you go?\" he responded. She thought of \"home, my lift, taking the children to school the next morning ... my projected biography of King Charles II ... \" and then said, \"No, it's not absolutely essential\". Long afterwards, they would both wonder what might have been had she answered differently.\n\nThey went back to Antonia's house in Campden Hill Square, where they drank Champagne and talked. \"He stayed until six o'clock in the morning with extraordinary recklessness, but of course the real recklessness was mine.\" Those were the words Antonia wrote the next morning, clearly already aware that something momentous had begun.\n\nHarold was married to Vivien Merchant, the pretty, doe-eyed actress who plays Lily in Alfie, and had appeared in so many of his plays. Initially attracted by her \"essential vulnerability\", he was later worn down by her volatility and insecurity and, by 1975, the couple were living virtually separate lives, though under the same roof. Vivien, although it was barely obvious by then, was already on the road to the acute alcoholism that would kill her in 1983, aged just 53.\n\nAntonia had married Sir Hugh Fraser, youngest son of Lord Lovat, and a Conservative MP, when she was just 20 (his mother never approved of the marriage, and indeed shocked everyone by wearing black at the wedding; after her death Antonia discovered a hat labelled \"the hat I wore at poor Hugh's wedding\") and, although she had discovered the essential incompatibility of her own romantic, passionate, aspirational nature, and his, more practical, detached, unemotional, theirs was a marriage based on respect and affection, in which the needs of their six children, three girls, three boys, were paramount.\n\nAfter that first meeting came phone calls, stolen meetings in dim pubs, love poems and letters, and constant flowers. Just two months later, Harold had decided to tell Vivien, because he was unable to dissemble or deceive over something which he described to Kevin Billington as \"joyous, dangerous and unavoidable\". Theirs was a classic coup de foudre, a passion that could not be denied and would not abate, that spilled over into the light of day despite the strict code of conduct of their era and class, which permitted such liaisons but frowned on the self-indulgence of rocking the status quo. Indeed, when Antonia -- who grandly likened their love affair to Ulysses and Penelope, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba -- told her mother, she tried to persuade her to stay with Hugh, telling \"meaningful stories of her friends whose lovers chucked them for younger women\". Harold's furious response, when she told him this, was: \"I like mature women, doesn't she realise, I am a boy at heart, ever 18, so naturally I like mature women.\"\n\nHer father, Lord Longford, also counselled discretion; \"I thought of trying to explain to him about passion, but what's the point?\" fumed Antonia: \"He only likes people like the convicted Moors murderess Myra Hindley who are apparently repenting of passion.\"\n\nIn a tailspin of rage and hurt, Vivien threatened to file for divorce and cite Antonia, while Harold, equally determined to action, asked her to marry him. By then, Hugh knew of the affair (when Antonia told him, his response was \"The best living playwright. Very suitable\"), however, the actual breach -- described by Antonia with rather typical polite understatement, as \"beyond anything ghastly\" -- was still a shock to him.\n\nEven more ghastly was the media frenzy that soon followed. Having filed her divorce petition, Vivien then called in the tabloids, who were already well aware of what they had coyly dubbed a \"literary friendship\" between Pinter and Fraser, and were now able to go to town on the salacious story, sending crowds of press to camp outside the house in Campden Hill Square. The story was more than a seven-day wonder, repeatedly fuelled by further revelations from the scorned and devastated Vivien, leaving Antonia to \"involuntarily shiver at the sight of a crowd of reporters and photographers jostling round a door\" for years afterwards.\n\nOn their first night of living together in the house they rented at Launceston Place, Harold had filled every room with a riot of flowers -- white, pink, yellow; his expression \"a mixture of excitement, triumph and laughter\". This kind of gesture -- expansive, romantic, reckless -- was typical of their relationship, in which demonstrations of love were ever abundant and highly visible. Theirs is the kind of affair that should really have ended badly -- too consuming, too scandalous, surrendered to too completely. In so many cases, where passion burns that brightly, it usually scorches all around it, leaving broken dreams, broken promises and bitter disillusion. Instead, Antonia and Harold, from that innocuous beginning -- \"must you go?\" -- were almost constantly together, until his sad demise from cancer on Christmas Eve 2008.\n\nThose years were often filled with momentous events. Like the IRA bomb placed under a car outside Campden Hill Square, intended for Hugh Fraser because of his supposedly hard line over Northern Ireland, which was accidentally detonated by a neighbour, Gordon Hamilton-Fairley, a cancer specialist, who was out for a walk with his dog. Alerted to something suspicious by the poodle, he poked under the car with his stick, and died in the subsequent blast. Caroline Kennedy was staying with Hugh at the time (Jackie was an old friend of his, and possible one-time girlfriend), and would have been an unexpected but wildly high-profile extra casualty. Later, there was the night Salman Rushdie, newly under fatwa and in fear of his life, asked could he spend the night at their house so as to meet his family, and duly arrived with a heavy Special Branch presence.\n\nTheir life together was busy, with both working hard at their respective careers, and almost dizzy with glamour. Their social engagements are intellectual and starry, involving trips to Paris to meet Beckett -- where Antonia once recorded the following hilarious exchange between the two writers: \"I'm sorry, Sam, if I sound very gloomy\", from Harold, to which Beckett courteously replies, \"Oh, you couldn't be more gloomy than I am, Harold.\" There were dinners with Laurence Olivier and Helen Mirren, who wears \"a white voile skirt, tatty high-heeled shoes, a white cricket shirt, a black leather jacket and looks fabulous\", and jaunts to New York, where Jackie Kennedy asks Antonia \"are you here for the Democratic Convention?\" There is a dinner with Princess Diana, where she says brightly to the guest of honour, the Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres: \"Yes, I'd love to come to Israel. Anything for some sun.\" And everywhere the couple stay in elegant suites, gracious country estates and large town houses. Details of who wears what, including her own fabulous-sounding wardrobe, are recorded by Antonia with all the precision of a genuine passion for clothes, so we get to hear about the \"ravishing outfit\" Harold buys her at Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, \"blue and white stripes, Tissot or maybe Renoir\", and the wedding outfit, by Jean Muir, \"a swirling white crepe number, high neck, scattered crystal new moons and stars ... I shall feel like Titania\".\n\nThere are many trips to Ireland, to Tullynally Castle in Westmeath, where Antonia's brother Thomas Packenham, author of the marvellous Scramble for Africa and Meetings With Remarkable Trees, lives in the ancestral home; also to Galway, to stay with actor Robert Shaw and his 10 children; and to Dublin, where Harold's plays were regularly performed. Harold had toured the countryside extensively when he was a young actor in repertory, and even nearly married a girl, Pauline Flanagan, here, when he was 21. And it was from Dublin he had just returned -- having attended the opening night of the Pinter Festival at the Gate, and celebrated his 75th birthday at The Unicorn -- when the news came through that he had won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2005.\n\nBut despite the intensity of the drama between Harold and Antonia, it is impossible not to hear the rustle of tragedy off-stage. The just-glimpsed character of Vivien, lonely, vindictive, steadily drinking herself to death, determined to be as much of a nuisance as possible to the lovers, is hard to ignore, as is Daniel, Harold's only son, who appears in the diaries briefly during the short period in which he lived with Harold and Antonia. He later became estranged, remaining so until Harold's death, and thus simply exits the book, quietly, without fanfare, not to be mentioned again.\n\nIn happy contrast, relations with Hugh remained cordial and affectionate; in fact, the day her divorce came through, Antonia went, alone, to La Boheme, \"and sat in a black velvet cloak and cried my heart and eyes out in the last act\". This, she wryly acknowledges, \"was pure self-indulgence as almost anyone I knew would have taken me out to dinner, including Hugh\". It was her own way of making peace with the breaking of her marriage vows, and of honouring a man for whom she had continued affection.\n\nHugh died just six years after the divorce, of lung cancer, and Harold seems to have occupied a kind of avuncular role in the lives of Antonia's children, joining in the sprawling family holidays and managing to cope, just about, with the pace of life in Campden Hill Square; although he did eventually buy the house that backed onto the garden, creating what he dubbed his \"super study\" there, in order to find peace enough to write. He bonded over cricket with the boys, and later gave Rebecca, Antonia's eldest daughter, away at her wedding.\n\nDespite his fearsome public reputation, Pinter was easy-going and undemanding at home; in the inversion of that classic German phrase, a 'house angel, street devil'. \"Harold has the lowest domestic expectations, which is perhaps just as well under the circumstances,\" wrote Antonia, who famously doesn't either cook or do housework. And even though the mood in the house was always particularly pleasant when his writing was going well, there were no tantrums or brooding silences when the opposite occurred. Although highly conscious of his brilliance -- as a writer, an actor, a poet, an orator -- Antonia was not overwhelmed by his personality, his reputation or his talent. The couple read each other's work, making notes, comments and suggestions, and her critical faculties were just as acute as his. After the first draft of the play that became Torcello, Antonia suggested, \"very tentatively\" that a scene was missing. Harold was initially \"very cross\", but then sat down and wrote the scene.\n\nAnd if the plays he wrote in the years before he met Antonia are his finest, better by a margin than anything he wrote afterwards, this is something he seems to have been perfectly well aware of himself -- \"happiness is not dramatic,\" he said, about a year after the couple finally married, in 1982. Instead, he became more and more politically active, travelling to South America, Turkey and Eastern Europe, to draw attention to political and human rights abuses there, giving lectures and appearing on TV debates during the Iraq war, even when he was very ill with cancer.\n\nThe final chapter of the couple's life together is like a benediction on the decisive, destructive steps they took in order to be together. As Harold's health fails him, in every painful, humiliating and infuriating way, Antonia is ever at his side, with love and admiration unabated. \"I shall miss you so much when I'm dead,\" begins the last poem he wrote her, those bleak 'Pinteresque' pauses and chilly sparsity of prose forever replaced by the warm rush of affection. \"Must you go?\" asked Antonia when the final hour came, answering herself, \"Yes, it was time.\"\n\n'Must You Go? My Life With Harold Pinter' by Antonia Fraser (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, €21.99) is out now"
