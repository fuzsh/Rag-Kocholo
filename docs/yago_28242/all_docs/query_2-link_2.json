        "text": "Sunlight is filtering into Lady Antonia Fraser’s cosy drawing room in Holland Park – one of the chicest areas of bohemian west London. Her house wears the long life of its resident on its sleeve. The photos in the downstairs lavatory range from a younger Fraser meeting Elizabeth II, when her late husband, the dramatist Harold Pinter, received the Companion of Honour award in 2002, to her wedding to Pinter in 1980. There is also a jumble of family photographs of the Fraser “clan” – her own six children and, at the present count, 19 grandchildren.\n\nFraser, wearing a lilac and blue floral coat and a striking dash of eyeshadow, her fine ash blonde-grey hair swept back, apologises that she can’t stand up to meet me. “Ninety is like this, alas,” she says, and makes room for me close beside her on a sofa. Her cat Ferdy takes up a sentinel position between us. We are surrounded by a pile of books, including her latest biography about Lady Caroline Lamb, a “born rebel who scandalised society”. It’s a theme which reflects Fraser’s own eventful life and independent streak.\n\nHer minutely-researched biographies range from her early bestseller hit Mary Queen of Scots, published over 50 years ago, to those covering decisive moments in British history, from the Cromwell era to the Great Reform Act, and her series of jaunty Jemima Shore detective novels.\n\nShe seems irresistibly drawn to women who broke convention. Lamb was a mistress of Lord Byron who often cross-dressed in a hussar’s jacket. “She called him ‘mad, bad and dangerous to know’, which does sound very modern when you hear it,” Fraser laughs. And she has dropped hints that this is her last full-length biography. “This book … can also be regarded as the culmination of an exciting and fulfilling life spent studying history,” she writes in the afterword.\n\nWhen she came round, she says it felt like “waking up from a sleep – the room was very light” and she chatted to a nurse from Ethiopia about a trip there in the past. “I loved Ethiopia when I visited, so I asked her about that. I think she got a surprise because, one minute I was lying there in all these wires and drips not doing anything at all, and the next thing, I was starting a conversation!”\n\nWeeks in hospital followed before she was allowed home. But it has been far from plain sailing since. In April, after a home-help noted that her speech was slurred, she was rushed back into hospital, diagnosed with a stroke, and a blood clot was removed from her brain in an emergency procedure.\n\nShe now has a tiny metal coil in her head – platinum wires which block the blood flow, preventing further rupture. “For the first time, I feel tired,” she confides. “It presses on my head and I get headaches. But it does the job, so I shouldn’t complain.”\n\nPost-recuperation, Fraser is bracingly factual. “Some things are difficult. Steps are a problem. But it’s an event isn’t it, being 90? I mean, it’s treated as an achievement which is lovely – but you didn’t do anything to earn it, apart from getting there!”\n\nShe is having to get used to going out in a wheelchair. “You have to be quite firm about where you want to stop and for how long,” she says. At a recent art exhibition she says she was at eye-level with the paintings. “[It meant] I could see pretty much all of the descriptions warning me that this was an image of ‘toxic masculinity’. Awful!”\n\nHers is a life which combines the privilege of birth and the hard slog of book writing and public appearances. Her six children have careers ranging from the high end of law to finance and fashion. “So I have to be very careful when I praise one that the other is not offended. Flora carries on the biography tradition [her book Pretty Young Rebel: The Life of Flora Macdonald has just been published] and I am so happy about that.”\n\nAs the eldest child of the seventh earl of Longford and his wife Elizabeth Harman, Fraser’s title is hereditary, though she greets visitors with “Call me Antonia”. It also plumbs her into an intriguing mix of political and literary dynasties – the Labour politician Harriet Harman is a cousin.\n\nBorn in London in 1932, she went to “what was still really a boys’ school” – The Dragon in Oxford. Her father, later best known as the campaigner Lord Longford, taught politics at Christ Church College, Oxford, and the household guests were the glittering names of the era: Isaiah Berlin, John Betjeman, Iris Murdoch. Before she went up to Lady Margaret Hall, she was one of the last generation of debutantes. She converted, along with her parents, to Catholicism as a teenager (hence the last rites a few months ago), but her family roots were in the unitarian church with its emphasis on individual responsibility and social reform. Does she still pray? “Oh yes, a lot. Not that He always listens. I have told Him I am grateful for being here.”\n\nHer freewheeling life also made her the fascination of newspaper diary columnists in the mid-1970s, after she left her marriage to Hugh Fraser, a war hero and prominent Scottish Conservative MP, for Harold Pinter. Now Pinter ranks as the foremost British dramatist of the latter half of the 20th century, but at the time, the focus was on the shock of a prominent woman leaving her first marriage and living with her lover. The match – Fraser’s aristocratic roots and Pinter’s background as the brilliant son of an East-End tailor – also contravened the social order of the time. Private Eye mockingly called her “Lady Magnolia Freelove”.\n\nDid she ever think of herself as a feminist ice-breaker? “Feminist? Hmm...” she says, brooding for a moment. “My mother was a great proponent of women’s education and I grew up debating with men, so I never felt inferior. In the case of Harold, I loved my first husband very much and continued to do so. But I’m also a devotee of Georgette Heyer and the idea that when you meet your great love, you just know. And that is what it was and I had to be with Harold. And once that was clear, I knew my own mind and my heart.”\n\nBut yes, the sticks and stones hurt. “Not so much me. I cancelled my Private Eye subscription, of course. But if it hurt my children – and it jolly well did – I felt responsible.” Pinter was in a fading marriage to the actress Vivien Merchant and equally lovestruck when he met Fraser after a first night of his play The Birthday Party. When she said goodbye, he replied, “Must you go?” – the title of her memoir of their relationship published after Pinter’s death from cancer in 2008. “And my mind went to everything I had to do the next morning, getting children off to school and shopping at Sainsbury’s. But I stayed. And even now, I wonder how my life would have been if, at that moment, I had said, ‘Yes. I have to go’.”\n\nThey spent the next few years living together before Pinter was granted a divorce in 1980, and that year the couple married in Kensington Register Office – an iconic image of a wedding, but also one that sealed her reputation as a society rebel.\n\nEven now she hovers between a carefree tendency to speak her mind and an insistence on “good manners”. The latter was the reason that, when her first husband Hugh Fraser asked to meet her new lover, she said, “Yes, of course” – though she recalls being so overwrought she fell asleep while the two men discussed cricket. Fraser predeceased Pinter in 1984, the longest serving MP of the era, beloved in Parliament, not least for an extraordinary war record as a parachute regiment hero, and an unsuccessful run at the Tory leadership against Edward Heath.\n\nThe Pinter marriage was exceptionally happy – a household “full of flowers” that he had bought her, the drink on the balcony at the end of the day, and the life of busy writers cohabiting. “I would leap out of bed bright-eyed, he sprang out at night time!” Telling these tales, you can see decades fall from her face. Her eyes shine and she laughs like a drain.\n\nI wonder how she coped with his death. “There is a part of you as a widow,” she says softly. “You keep it at bay – for the sake of others, for good manners. But it is always there and that is the case with me – for both of my husbands. You do not stop loving them. Never.”\n\nAs the executor of Pinter’s literary estate, she oversees the rights to the performance of his work and there are cast-iron provisions in place that no word of original text can be altered. That has run into sporadic problems, notably when she was asked if she would give permission to remove the Asian slurs in The Caretaker. She refused. But, given the more sensitive climate today, would she now agree?\n\n”Certainly not,” she bristles. “Why should it be changed? It is the way a character speaks and it was written like that for a reason. I promised Harold that not one word of his work would be changed – and I am certainly not breaking that promise.”\n\nDoes cancel culture make life harder for writers? She thinks that, of all her subjects, Charles II’s record with women might well have put him into the bracket of power-abuse now deemed “problematic”. “And fair enough,” she replies. “But it was lots of fun to be made a duchess and given lots of favours. Cancel me if you like!”\n\nFraser herself has enjoyed close ties with the Royal family. Her father attended the late Queen’s coronation (she skipped school to join the procession) and, later, she became friends with Princess Margaret. “She had a tough life – another independent woman – and she struggled. But she also did an enormous amount for the arts.”\n\nHow does it feel to be in the post-Elizabethan era? “For people of my era, it meant a lot when she died – she was a piece of all of us. But I am also a monarchist who knows the importance of succession and it is great that King Charles is there.” She is a “big fan” of the Prince and Princess of Wales; she adores “William and Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis – that’s what we like isn’t it?”\n\nDoes she reckon “The Firm” will be around in a few decades, given her knowledge of the eddies and swirls of history? “Why ever not? It is what the British people would choose, if we voted on it.”\n\nWhen Meghan joined the Royal family, Fraser wrote an encouraging note to Frogmore Cottage, though it came back stamped “not known at this address”. How does she feel now about the Harry and Meghan revenge tragedy? The reply is a zipped lip – with a mischievous twinkle. I note she can be reluctant to talk about certain things and she shoots back, “I am very keen to talk about some things. I’m just less keen on reading about myself talking about them!”\n\nDoes she have any regrets after nine decades? “I wish I had spent less time and money dyeing my hair blonde.” The house is brimful of photographic evidence to the contrary – her tumbling golden locks in the Sophia Loren-style up-dos are a key part of her old-fashioned glamour (even today, we have to time the interview so she can see her hairdresser first). “Well alright,” she concedes. “It was fun and you know, all that hairdo was really done with a huge wad of fake hair to make it look big. If you ever need one, I have them in a cupboard!”\n\nShe has met princes, playwrights and historians from across the Atlantic and beyond. Is there anyone missing from her social list?\n\n“I would love to meet ‘Queen’ Penny Mordaunt [the Tory MP and leader of the House who had a starring role at the Coronation]. Wonderful taste! That headdress – she was so elegant and strong and that is what I like in a woman. Can you bring her to lunch?” I promise to try.\n\nLife still seems to stretch before her, even as the clock winds down.\n\nIt doesn’t feel like the end will be any time soon. “Well I am very content with 90 and something, 100 might be pushing it. I have planned my funeral,” she tells me. “No memorial service, though. So expensive and too heavy going!”\n\nIt’s 12.20pm and time for a glass of wine on a silver tray (her habit of doling out glasses of good white wine with large rocks of ice have earned her the nickname of the “cold corruptor”).\n\n“I really am an incurable pleasure seeker,” she beams. “But you know Anne, I do rather like still being here.”\n\nAnne McElvoy is executive editor at Politico"
