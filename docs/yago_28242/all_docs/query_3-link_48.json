        "text": "In May 1975, Harold and I had an unofficial honeymoon in Paris. That is to say, we went on our first trip abroad together, having met for the first time in January. We were not yet living together so it was a time of great romantic excitement and adventure.\n\nHarold chose a discreet hotel In one of the back streets off the Champs-Elysées: discreet but incredibly luxurious by my somewhat low standards of family outings to the seaside. We revelled in the luxury and the privacy. Harold wrote the first of his many poems to me, appropriately titled Paris.\n\nSuddenly peace was disturbed by extraordinary and prolonged shouting, the sound of music including the La Marseillaise, and numerous other rousing tunes, bursts of clapping. Instinctively, we felt it was a thrilling sound, something wonderful was taking place.\n\nWe listened in silence, awestruck.\n\nThen Harold spoke: “It’s us of course. How could you not realise? They are celebrating us. The whole of France is celebrating our love.”\n\nAnd our silence ended in happy laughter at the ridiculous notion.\n\nThen suddenly things changed completely and got very serious. I rang the concierge and asked what the hullabaloo was all about. He told me it was the day the war ended: that war when the French, having been conquered by the Germans, conquered them in turn and threw them out of Paris.\n\nThe cheerful crowds were celebrating 8 May 1945, thirty years on. In short it was VE Day. And Harold and I started to talk about our wartime experiences for the first time.\n\nAt the beginning of the war Harold was nine and I was seven: so that both of us remembered the war vividly, those childhood memories which remain in clear colours forever, when later memories get misted over. We had very different wartime experiences. Harold, whose parents lived in the East End, was evacuated, first of all with his school to a castle in Cornwall and later to Yorkshire (where he discovered cricket and Len Hutton in no particular order).\n\nI remained the whole war in Oxford, my father being a don at Christ Church , after he was invalided out of the army early on. So we received evacuees and Harold was an evacuee; there were a few jokes about Harold being evacuated to our North Oxford house, which would have been a great deal less comfortable than his warm Hackney home.\n\nSuddenly, I heard myself say: “But what if the Germans had won? Supposing there had been a German occupation of Britain. We would never have met.” Harold was 100 per cent Jewish. He would have vanished along with his parents and thousands of others. There was silence between us.\n\nThen the swell of the noise and music from afar took over again. We decided to go outside and join the crowds in the Champs Elysées. There, amid chanting Frenchmen, we celebrated VE Day with even more fervour, even more gratitude."
