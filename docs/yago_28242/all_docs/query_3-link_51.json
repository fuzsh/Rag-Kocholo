        "text": "Like so many of us, Lady Antonia Fraser – “Please, just Antonia” – has spent most of the past year at home. Today, the sitting room of the house in Holland Park where she has lived for “62 and a half” years, is bathed in sunlight, streaming in through the French windows, but there is a hint of perturbation in the air.\n\nLast night, as she was watching television, the bulb in the lamp next to the sofa exploded, showering glass everywhere. An electrician has been summoned. Happily, the television remained on.\n\n“Do I have Netflix?” She feigns astonishment at my question. “Is the Pope a Catholic?” The delights of Netflix – or “Lady Nettie” as she calls it – are something the family talks about all the time. She is particularly fond of Shtisel, a subtitled Israeli soap opera set in a Hassidic community in Jerusalem. “Akive,” she sighs, recalling the good-looking, permanently bewildered young hero of the series. “I just want to tug those locks...”\n\nOn the sitting room walls hang lovely paintings, and exquisite drawings of various family members; fine silver objets are arranged on a side table. A cat sashays nonchalantly in, bell tinkling – Bella, after Queen Isabella of Castile. Its brother is named after King Ferdinand.\n\nFraser is 88, elegant, courteous and cultured, her countenance alive with amusement and curiosity. In her early life her looks were compared to Julie Christie’s, and it is easy still to see how she made men’s heads spin.\n\nA low table in front of her is piled high with books – biographies, novels, history. She has always been a voracious reader: she was four when she read Our Island Story: A Child’s History of England, which sparked, she says, her life-long love affair with literature and history. At seven, she “quickly knocked off” a story of her own, about Queen Matilda.\n\nHer first published book, written when she was 22, was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (1954), part of a historical series for children. It sold more than 50,000 copies. Her first major work, Mary Queen of Scots, was published in 1969. Since then she has written 23 further works of non-fiction, including biographies of Oliver Cromwell and Marie Antoinette and an account of the Gunpowder Plot.\n\n“History to me is a huge playground,” she says. “I’m not like an academic. If I know something, it’s not so interesting. I want to find out – and then tell you.” She laughs. “I’m a sort of liaison officer.”\n\nHer latest book, The Case of the Married Woman, tells the story of Caroline Norton, a now overlooked 19th-century novelist, poet and campaigner for women’s rights. At a time when many of the most successful authors were women – Jane Austen, at the start of the century, then later George Eliot and Norton herself – the copyright of their works, and thus their earnings, belonged by law to their husbands.\n\nMore distressing still, to Norton, was the fact that married mothers had no rights over their children. A husband “could take a child away from their mother and it would be legal – as happened with Caroline”, says Fraser, incredulous. “And a husband could live off the copyrights of his wife’s books.”\n\nShe pauses, lost for words. She imagines how she would have felt if her first husband, Sir Hugh Fraser – “He was a great gentleman, so it’s unthinkable” – had lived off the proceeds of Mary Queen of Scots. “It’s such an extraordinary concept!”\n\nNorton was the granddaughter of the Irish playwright, Richard Sheridan. Her father Tom, an actor, soldier and colonial administrator, died when she was 11. At the age of 17, she fell in love with Ralph Leveson Smith, a lawyer, who died tragically within a year of their meeting. At 19, she married George Norton, a magistrate and Tory MP.\n\n“She was very pretty, and she had an offer,” Fraser says, “and girls of her class didn’t do anything else. I think she was spurred on by the loss of the man she’d loved. She was a romantic.”\n\nFraser is momentarily distracted by the memory of her own first love, Patrick Lindsay, the younger son of the Scottish Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, when she too was “lost in rosy dreams. I was 17. He was very handsome and liked fast cars and things like that. I don’t like fast cars at all, but thought it was rather wonderful. But we were not meant for each other.” She went off to Oxford, and Lindsay married one of her best friends.\n\nIt was the kind of romance that, she says, “if you’re a girl of my generation, you’d read about” in the historical melodramas of Georgette Heyer, which Fraser adored. “Do you know, the other day, somebody came to see me and referred to Georgette ‘Higher’, because they’d never heard the name used? I nearly died of shock.” (Heyer pronounced it to rhyme with “hair”.) She addresses the cat: “Bella, isn’t it extraordinary? Regency Buck by Georgette Heyer is probably the greatest book ever written. Ha ha!”\n\nCaroline Norton was famed as a hostess for her sharp wit, free spirit and ability to say “stinging things”. Her salon attracted ambitious young politicians, among them Disraeli, but her closest friend was Lord Melbourne, the Whig home secretary, and later prime minister. Her flirtatious nature was grist for gossip, and her friendship with Melbourne became the talk of London society – and a dagger in the heart of her husband.\n\nGeorge Norton was physically abusive and, by today’s standards, guilty of extreme mental cruelty. The marriage was marked by separation and recrimination, culminating in Norton taking their children from his wife – as he was legally entitled to do. In 1836, matters came to a head when he sued Melbourne – who was then prime minister – under the law of crim con, or criminal conversation: effectively, an accusation of adultery. Norton had initially demanded £10,000, but Melbourne refused to be blackmailed, leading to the court action.\n\nThe case was a sensation. Crowds queued up to hear evidence from the servants of “kisses exchanged”, the “disordered” appearance of Caroline Norton’s hair and dress when Melbourne came calling, and the “marks” on her bed-linen. Since she had no legal existence outside marriage, she was not represented in court – even though it was her reputation that was on trial. As she wrote to her friend, Mary Shelley: “A woman is made a helpless wretch by these laws of men.”\n\nIn the end, George Norton lost his case, and Melbourne was acquitted. Having read the book, Fraser asks me, did I think Caroline and Melbourne had – as she puts it – “gone the whole hog”?\n\nIt seems likely, I say.\n\nInteresting, she says. When she asks that question, “On the whole, men say yes.” She thinks not. “Belonging to a pre-Pill generation, I think I understand how women were determined to preserve their innocence slightly more than [younger] generations that might think that’s nonsense.”\n\nIn her book, she gives another reason to doubt it. “Melbourne had an acknowledged taste for flagellation in the course of consensual sex. There is no suggestion that he ever indulged in this taste with Caroline Norton – who as the indignant wife of an abusive husband was unlikely to have welcomed it.”\n\nNorton herself maintained the relationship was never more than affectionately platonic. “I was not his mistress,” she wrote to a friend, when Melbourne died in 1848. “But I would rather have been what I was, his favourite companion, than any other man’s wife or mistress.”\n\nDenied access to her children, she devoted her energies to writing pamphlets and letters and petitioning her political friends. In April 1839 the Custody of Infants Act – which would later be described as the first feminist legislation ever to be brought before Parliament – became law. It would be followed by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, reforming the laws on divorce, for which Caroline Norton had also campaigned. And in 1870, Parliament passed the Married Women’s Property Act, which meant that wages and property that a wife earned or inherited would now be regarded as her own.\n\nGeorge Norton died in 1875. In 1877, Caroline remarried, to a widower William Stirling, becoming Lady Stirling-Maxwell. By then she was ailing fatally, and died three months after the wedding.\n\nFraser says she would have loved to have had her as a friend. “I don’t really have that kind of courage, so I particularly like it in other people.”\n\nCaroline Norton’s contemporaries attributed her rebellious spirit to her Irish blood. Fraser has Irish blood herself – not “lovely Sheridian blood,” she says, but Anglo-Irish, on her father, Lord Longford’s side. It was only when she was researching her book on Oliver Cromwell that she discovered an ancestor, Major Henry Pakenham, had acquired their family estate in Ireland as a soldier in Cromwell’s army: “An uncomfortable moment...”\n\nBoth her father and her mother, the historian Elizabeth Longford, stood, unsuccessfully, as Labour parliamentary candidates in the1940s. (“Very exciting!”, the young Fraser wrote in her diary. “Dada is going to abolish Want.”) But as a member of the House of Lords, Lord Longford went on to become one of the Labour Party’s longest serving politicians, famous for his anti-pornography campaigning and prison visits as part of his advocacy of penal reform.\n\nHer upbringing was, she says, “very eccentric” – not least because of her father’s “determined otherworldliness”, which she clearly adored. She tells a story of how every summer he would buy his wife a new dress. “He’d go into the shop and get it. Unlike me, my mother was quite small, and he regularly produced an enormous dress, with the sleeves too long. We used to think, obviously Dada still sees her as this noble beauty when they were at Oxford together. And then I discovered the reason it never fit was when he went into a shop and said, ‘I want to buy a dress for my wife’, the young lady would say, ‘What size?’ And out of politeness he’d always say, ‘Your size.’”\n\nHer father was evidently in mind when, at the age of 16, Fraser wrote a diary entry about her ideal husband: “Mine must be Catholic or convertible, a peer if possible, clever, intellectual and literary, interested in surroundings. Either Labour or amenable, having a house in town and an ancient family seat, fond of children and wanting them.”\n\nEight years later, notwithstanding the fact that he was a Tory MP, she married a Scottish Catholic, the Honourable Sir Hugh Fraser, son of Lord Lovat, getting both the town and country house, and eventually, six children. To which have been added 20 grandchildren and – she counts them – six great grandchildren.\n\nIn 1975, after 19 years of marriage, she embarked on an affair with the playwright Harold Pinter, who was married to the actress Vivien Merchant. In her memoir Must You Go? she describes how she had first noticed Pinter across a crowded restaurant. A few weeks later, at a dinner to celebrate the first night of his play The Birthday Party, she came to congratulate him as she was leaving. “He looked at me with those amazing, extremely bright black eyes. ‘Must you go?’ he said. I thought of home, my lift, taking the children to school the next morning, the exhausting past night in the sleeper from Scotland, my projected biography of King Charles II… ‘No, it’s not absolutely essential,’ I said.”\n\nFour months later she revealed the affair to her husband. “The best living playwright,” said a remarkably unperturbed Sir Hugh. “Very suitable.” When Pinter came to talk things over, she writes, “Hugh and Harold ­discussed cricket at length, then the West Indies, then Proust. I started to go to sleep on the sofa. Harold politely went home.” She and Pinter went on to enjoy 33 “very happy” years together until his death in 2008. (She and Hugh Fraser divorced in 1977.) Her father approved of the match. Like Pinter, he was fanatical about cricket.\n\n“Do you know the story about the poem?” she asks me. Pinter once wrote a two-line poem about his cricketing hero. “I saw Len Hutton in his prime/ Another time, another time.” He faxed a copy to his friend the playwright Simon Gray, and later phoned to ask what he thought of it. “I haven’t finished it yet,” Gray replied.\n\nAnother time... it reminds her of a younger relative’s perspective on the passage of time. “I was talking to one of my younger grandsons about living through the war,” she says. “And he said, ‘Was that World War One, grandma?’” She laughs. “It taught me quite a lesson.”\n\nShe was once being interviewed by Simon Jenkins at a literary festival, she says. “A question I wanted him to ask, because I wanted to dispose of it, was, ‘Didn’t you have a very privileged upbringing?’ And my answer is, yes, I had two privileges – and not the ones you think. One is that my parents adored each other and were married for 70 years. And the other is my mother believed in a girl’s education. Those two are much better than money – I say, hypocritically, because it’s lovely to have money.” She laughs.\n\nThe sun is casting pools of light on the carpet, and the electrician won’t be here quite yet. “Would you like a glass of wine?” she says.\n\nThe Case of the Married Woman is published by W&N at £25 on Thursday.
