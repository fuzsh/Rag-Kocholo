        "text": "Years after the death of loved ones, we may find ourselves dreaming that they are alive. How happy we are to see them, to hear their voices, to realize how absurdly mistaken we were to think them lost forever. Then we wake, remember the truth and feel a pang as sharp as any we suffered in the early days of mourning.\n\nThe longing to inhabit a dream of this sort is presumably the impetus behind Antonia Fraser’s decision to write “Must You Go?” a memoir of her 34-year relationship with the playwright Harold Pinter. In a preface, she quotes Shakespeare — “O! call back yesterday, bid time return” — to explain why she has culled her diaries and added explanatory notes to construct a chronological narrative of their affair and subsequent marriage.\n\nThe title refers to the fateful question Pinter asked Fraser, detaining her at a dinner party she was about to leave, after which they fell in love. Having served as a touchstone between them, the phrase assumed a sadder resonance when Pinter died of cancer in December 2008. In snippets, mostly jotted down soon after an event, Fraser recounts the secret trysts and public drama that set the paparazzi in pursuit of the pair when they left their spouses to live together. Fraser was 42, the mother of six and the wife of Sir Hugh Fraser, a Conservative member of Parliament. Pinter, 44, was married to the actress Vivien Merchant, with whom he had a son.\n\nFraser takes us behind the scenes at the plays Pinter wrote, acted in and directed, and recalls the moments when new works first took shape in his mind. We follow the couple on romantic visits to Paris and Venice, trips to Broadway and to locations where Pinter’s screenplays were being filmed, as well as on cultural missions to Eastern Europe before and after the fall of Communism. Meanwhile the thrum of history — the Thatcher years, the Iraq war, unrest in Latin America and Kosovo — grows louder as Pinter becomes more vocal in his view that artists should speak out on political questions. In the final section, we witness the horrific seven years of suffering Pinter endured as he succumbed to the illness that left him too weak to attend the Stockholm ceremony at which he was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize.\n\nA long parade of illustrious friends and acquaintances, from Samuel Beckett to Meryl Streep, Isaiah Berlin to Steve McQueen, make cameo appearances. Along with the well-connected couple, we witness historic occasions: the first weeks of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the massive demonstration in London protesting the invasion of Iraq. At a Buckingham Palace lunch to greet the newly elected Czech president, Vaclav Havel, Prince Philip complains to Fraser about the “wonderful military strategist” Henry VIII being remembered solely for his six wives. Referring to Havel’s career change from playwright to head of state, Queen Elizabeth asks, “But of course you were always working with your head?” And then, Fraser adds, “she sort of mimed it.”\n\nOften the book suggests an annotated engagement calendar, reporting on what people wore, ate and drank, and offering accounts that provide some of the fun of attending a reception or dinner without the strain of dressing up and making polite conversation. Fraser’s literary voice is amiable and chatty. Even when she’s recounting periods of worry and sorrow, her tone reflects a commitment to optimism, loyalty and a brisk, unsentimental courage. The more challenging parts of the narrative — Pinter’s contentious divorce, the controversies that swirled around the playwright’s public condemnations of the Bush and Blair governments — are handled with good sense, seemliness and tact.\n\nIt’s nice to hear about true love, especially after having read one too many memoirs that seem like barely disguised attempts to drive a stake through the heart of a corpse. The portrait of Pinter is affectionate and adulatory, nearly hagiographic. When, for Christmas 1978, Fraser gives him a mug inscribed, “You are a Genius,” one may feel that her gesture is only fractionally ironic. If the playwright had flaws — excessive drinking and a bad temper appear to have been among them — they seem hardly to have rippled the surface of their domestic bliss. At the same time, Fraser — who has enjoyed a successful career as a writer and whose biographical subjects have included Mary, Queen of Scots; Oliver Cromwell; and Marie Antoinette — makes it clear that, however awestruck she was by Pinter’s brilliance, she never slipped into the subservient role of handmaiden and art wife.\n\nThe pleasures of spending several hundred pages in the company of an intelligent woman and her gifted husband pale only when we stumble over certain passages that a dispassionate adviser might have counseled Fraser to omit. If Pinter, as we learn, felt that James Joyce’s privacy was violated by the publication of his love letters, would he have wanted us to overhear him saying, “I am loopy about you: I feel 18,” and Fraser’s comment, “I preferred the word ‘dippy’ ”? Doubtless Pinter, whose politics were left wing, was joking when, after a newscast, he told Fraser, “If Reagan and Gromyko make you happy, they’re my boys.” But it may not be the kind of joke one wants to share with the world.\n\nMore problematic are the sections that suggest a lapse in the sensitivity and sense of proportion so evident elsewhere. Given that Pinter and Fraser (who served as president of British PEN) were so outspoken about human rights and social justice, it seems odd that these tonal miscalculations so often take place on the border between the personal and the political. When Fraser’s cat vanishes, “I thought of what it must be like for the parents of ‘disappeared’ children.” Visiting a sympathetic priest, the Rev. Michael Campbell Johnston, Fraser impulsively asks if he would be willing to marry them. “Luckily Harold did not feel later that I had jumped the gun, perhaps because most of the rest of the conversation was about the murdered Jesuits in El Salvador.” Of course, the diary form prevents us from knowing if this is indirect dialogue or the diarist’s assumption, if Pinter or Fraser was the one who made the unfortunate mental leap from marriage to murder.\n\nIf, by the end, we feel we are left with a clearer picture of Fraser than of Pinter, we may want to consider a remark the poet Richard Howard made after one of those memorial services at which the speakers have so much more to say about themselves than about the deceased. “The eulogy,” Howard observed, “is the most autobiographical of forms.”\n\nIn her memoir of marriage, Fraser has given us a eulogy that is more than half autobiographical. It is also entertaining and ultimately touching in its determination to recapture lost time, to portray a younger, more carefree self and to bring back a lost loved one, if only on the page."
