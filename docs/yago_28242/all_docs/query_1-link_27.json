        "text": "Lady Antonia Fraser, CBE (born 27 August 1932), née Pakenham, is an English author of history and novels, best known as Antonia Fraser for writing biographies and detective fiction. She is the widow of Harold Pinter (1930–2008), the 2005 Nobel Laureate in Literature, and, when married to him, was also known as Antonia Pinter.[1][2][3][4]\n\nBiography[]\n\nFamily background and education[]\n\nBorn Antonia Margaret Caroline Pakenham on 27 August 1932, Antonia Fraser is the daughter of Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford (1905–2001), and his wife, Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford, née Elizabeth Harman (1906–2002). As the daughter of an Earl, she is accorded the honorific courtesy title \"Lady\" and thus customarily addressed formally as \"Lady Antonia\".[1]\n\nWhen she was a teenager,[5] like all her siblings she became a convert to the Catholic Church after the conversion of her parents.[1][6] Her \"maternal grandparents were Unitarians – a non-conformist faith with a strong emphasis on social reform ...\"; in response to criticism of her writing about Oliver Cromwell, she has said: \"I have no Catholic blood\"; before his own conversion in his thirties following a nervous breakdown in the Army, as she explains, \"my father was Protestant Church of Ireland, and my mother was Unitarian up to the age of 20 when she abandoned it.\"[5] She was educated at St Mary's School, Ascot, the Dragon School, Oxford[1][7] and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; the last was also her mother's alma mater.[5][8][9]\n\nMarriages and later life[]\n\nFrom 1956 until their divorce in 1977, she was married to Sir Hugh Fraser (1918-1984), a descendant of Scottish aristocracy 14 years her senior and a Conservative Unionist MP in the House of Commons (sitting for Stafford), who was a friend of the American Kennedy family.[10] They had six children: three sons, Benjamin, Damian, and Orlando; and three daughters, Rebecca, Flora, and Natasha (Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni), who are all also writers and biographers.[8][10] Benjamin works for JPMorgan, Damian is the managing director of the investment banking firm UBS AG (formerly S. G. Warburg) in Mexico, and Orlando is a barrister specializing in commercial law (Wroe).[8] Antonia Fraser has 18 grandchildren.[4]\n\nOn 22 October 1975, Hugh and Antonia Fraser, together with Caroline Kennedy, who was visiting them at their Holland Park home, in Kensington, West London, were almost blown up by an IRA car bomb placed under the wheels of his Jaguar, which had been triggered to go off at 9am when he left the house; the bomb exploded prematurely when it was examined and inadvertently set off by the eminent cancer researcher Gordon Hamilton-Fairley (1930–1975). Hamilton-Fairley, a neighbour of the Frasers, who had been walking his dog, noticed and inspected the device under the car, and died as a result of the blast.[5][10][11]\n\nIn 1975 Antonia Fraser began an affair with playwright Harold Pinter, who was then married to the actress Vivien Merchant.[1][8] In 1977, after she had been living with Pinter for two years, the Frasers' union was legally dissolved.[1][8] Merchant spoke about her distress publicly to the press, which quoted her cutting remarks about her rival, but she resisted divorcing Pinter.[1][8] In 1980, after Merchant signed divorce papers, Fraser and Pinter married.[1][5][8]\n\nHarold Pinter died on 24 December 2008.[4]\n\nSee also: Harold Pinter#Marriage and family life\n\nShe lives in the London district of Holland Park, within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, south of Notting Hill Gate, in the Fraser family home, where she still writes in her fourth-floor study.[1][3][12]\n\nCorrecting those who notice only her physical beauty—remarked upon both in her youth and well into her seventh decade—some commentators stress that, \"more than just a pretty face\", she is an accomplished historian and \"an intellectual\".[13]\n\nCareer[]\n\nShe began work as an \"all-purpose assistant\" for George Weidenfeld at Weidenfeld & Nicolson (her \"only job\"), which later became her own publisher and part of Orion Publishing Group, which publishes her works in the UK.[1][7]\n\nHer first major work, published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, was Mary, Queen of Scots (1969), which was followed by several other biographies, including Cromwell, Our Chief of Men (1973).[4][14] She won the Wolfson History Award in 1984 for The Weaker Vessel, a study of women's lives in 17th century England.[14] From 1988 to 1989, she was president of English PEN, and she chaired its Writers in Prison Committee.\n\nShe also has written detective novels; the most popular involved a character named Jemima Shore were adapted into a television series which aired in the UK in 1983.[8]\n\nIn 1983 to 1984, she was president of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club.[15]\n\nMore recently, Fraser published The Warrior Queens, the story of various military royal women since the days of Boadicea and Cleopatra.[2] In 1992, a year after Alison Weir's book The Six Wives of Henry VIII, she published a book with the same title, which British historian Eric Ives cites in his study of Ann Boleyn.[16]\n\nShe chronicled the life and times of Charles II in a well-reviewed 1979 eponymous biography.[14] The book was cited as an influence on the 2003 BBC/A&E mini-series, Charles II: The Power & the Passion, in a featurette on the DVD, by Rufus Sewell who played the title character. Fraser has also served as the editor for many monarchical biographies, including those featured in the Kings and Queens of England and Royal History of England series, and, in 1996, she also published a book entitled The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Faith in 1605, which won both the St Louis Literary Award and the Crime Writers' Association (CWA) Non-Fiction Gold Dagger.[14][17]\n\nTwo of the most recent of her thirteen non-fiction books are Marie Antoinette: The Journey (2001, 2002), which has been made into the film Marie Antoinette (2006), directed by Sofia Coppola, with Kirsten Dunst in the title role, and Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King (2006).[12]\n\nShe is represented by Curtis Brown Literary and Talent Agency, where her agent is Jonathan Lloyd, the Agency's CEO.\n\nRelated experience[]\n\nShe was a contestant on the BBC Radio 4 panel game My Word!.[18]\n\nShe serves as a judge for the Enid McLeod Literary Prize, awarded by the Franco-British Society, previously winning that prize for her biography Marie Antoinette (2001).[19][20]\n\nForthcoming work[]\n\nAccording to an anonymous news account published in the Mail Online on 8 April 2009, Lady Antonia Fraser confirmed to its author on 7 April that her next book is \"a memoir of her late husband Harold Pinter,\" but she also said, \"It is early days and I don't want to make any comment at the present time because I am still in mourning\"; although \"a source at her publishers Weidenfeld & Nicolson told the reporter, \"We have been sworn to secrecy about this,\" the writer speculates that the book is \"expected to be a touching love letter\" to Pinter.[21] This Daily Mail reporter speculates further that \"Some will even wonder if her intent is to pre-empt the possibility of another less agreeable biographer pitching up with the first book on Pinter's life and death.\"[21] Such speculation does not seem to take account of the fact that Pinter's official authorised biographer, Michael Billington, who is generally quite sympathetic to Pinter (\"agreeable\"), announced in January 2009 that a third edition of his book Harold Pinter (2nd ed., 2007) is being rushed to press by Faber and that it \"will take account of the international response to Pinter's death.\"[22] In June 2009, Bookseller.com announced that the title of Fraser's memoir is Must You Go? My Life with Harold Pinter and that the completed manuscript, to be published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson's imprint Orion Books, is due in July.[23] On 9 June 2009, the The Guardian stated that this memoir of a love affair and marriage would be published in January 2010.[24]\n\nShe is also working on a biography of Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland.[4][24]\n\nThe Lady Antonia Fraser Archive in the British Library[]\n\nFurther information: The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library\n\nLady Antonia Fraser's uncatalogued papers (relating to her \"Early Writing,\" \"Fiction,\" and \"Non-Fiction\") are on loan at the British Library (BL); there is a registry of this archive accessible via the British Library Manuscripts Catalogue online search facility, listing 19 boxes of materials.[25] Papers by and relating to Lady Antonia Fraser are also catalogued as part of the Harold Pinter Archive, which is part of its permanent collection of Additional Manuscripts.[26][27]\n\nAwards[]\n\nJames Tait Black Memorial Prize (1969), for her book Mary, Queen of Scots.[14]\n\nWolfson History Prize (1984), for her book The Weaker Vessel.[14]\n\nCrime Writers' Association Macallan Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction (1996), for her book The Gunpowder Plot.[14][28]\n\nSt Louis Literary Award (1996), for her book The Gunpowder Plot.[14]\n\nHistorical Association Norton Medlicott Medal (2000).[14]\n\nEnid McLeod Literary Prize (2001), from the Franco-British Society, for Marie Antoinette.[20][29]\n\nSelected bibliography[14][]\n\nNon-fiction works[]\n\nMary Queen of Scots (1969).
