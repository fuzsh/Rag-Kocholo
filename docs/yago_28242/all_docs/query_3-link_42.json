        "meta_description": "A moving testament to one of the literary world's most celebrated marriages: that of the greatest playwright of our age, Harold Pinter, and the beautiful and famous prize-winning biographer Antonia Fraser.   In this exquisite memoir, Antonia Fraser recounts the life she shared with the internationally renowned dramatist. In essence, it is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of their years together, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and mother of six, and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress. Over the years, they experienced much joy, a shared devotion to their work, crises and laughter, and, in the end, great courage and love as Pinter battled the illness to which he eventually suc&shy;cumbed on Christmas Eve 2008.   Must You Go?  is based on Fraser&rsquo;s recollections and on the diaries she has kept since October 1968. She shares Pinter&rsquo;s own revelations about his past, as well as observations by his friends. Fraser&rsquo;s diaries&mdash;written by a biographer living with a creative artist and observing the process firsthand&mdash;also pro&shy;vide a unique insight into his writing.  Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser lived together from August 1975 until his death thirty-three years later. &ldquo;O! call back yesterday, bid time return,&rdquo; cries one of the courtiers to Richard II. This is Antonia Fraser&rsquo;s uniquely compelling way of doing so.",
