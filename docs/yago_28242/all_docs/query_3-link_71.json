        "text": "The three words that make up the title of Antonia Fraser’s fond and affecting new memoir were spoken to her by Harold Pinter, the playwright, at a party in London in the winter of 1975.\n\nMs. Fraser walked up to Pinter, before leaving, to say that she liked his play, “The Birthday Party.” The two barely knew each other. He looked back at her with what she calls “amazing, extremely bright black eyes” and said, “Must you go?”\n\nShe was 42. He was 44. Each was smitten. Each was also married and had been for nearly two decades — Ms. Fraser to Sir Hugh Fraser, a Conservative member of Parliament (they had six children), and Pinter to the actress Vivien Merchant (they had one child). Both were well along in their careers, Ms. Fraser as a best-selling historian (“Mary Queen of Scots”) and Pinter as, well, Pinter, theater’s master of the anxious pause.\n\nBefore long they were a couple, and vinegary fodder for London’s tabloids, which ate up the story of, as Ms. Fraser puts it, “the working class Jewish boy from the East End and the Catholic aristocrat with her title.” In truth, Ms. Fraser says, by the mid-1970s they were successful and more alike than not. “Harold and I belonged to the same class: I will call it the Bohemian class.”\n\nHe called her his destiny and wrote her love poems, some of them later collected in a volume called “Six Poems for A” (2007). She loved his bristling mind, his “awesome baritone” and the way his “black curly hair and pointed ears” made him look “like a satyr.” They remained happily together (marrying in 1980) for 33 years, through his Nobel Prize in 2005 and until his death from cancer, at 78, in December 2008.\n\n“Must You Go?” is not a proper biography of Pinter, nor a remotely full account of Ms. Fraser’s own life. Instead it’s a book of glowing fragments, moments culled from Ms. Fraser’s diaries. The prose is not overly winsome. “My Diary: it’s not about great writing,” she admits. “It’s my friend, my record, and sometimes my consolation.” But there’s hardly a dull page.\n\nAt its most prosaic “Must You Go?” reads like a lightly annotated social calendar, albeit one of the most enviable and kaleidoscopic of the 20th century. “Supper with the two knights (Gielgud and Richardson)” is a bit of a typical entry. As are “Vidia and Pat Naipaul to lunch,” “Salman and Clarissa Rushdie come to dinner” and “party at Carl Bernstein’s.”\n\nA few more: “Dinner with Claire Bloom and Philip Roth,” “Harold had a drink with Beckett” and “Dinner at the discreet upper west side Carlyle Hotel with Steve McQueen.” All this apart from sometimes extended cameos by Alan Bates, Warren Beatty, Helen Mirren, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, Iris Murdoch, Nigella Lawson and dozens of others.\n\nMr. Rushdie and his security apparatus, after the fatwa was issued against him, arrive to spend the night. (It must be embarrassing, at this point, for a major British writer to admit that Mr. Rushdie did not ask to stay with him or her.) The writer Darryl Pinckney tells Ms. Fraser and Pinter one evening, “For scary people, you’re really a lot of fun.”\n\nPinter’s life force — he was mostly anything, it seems, but Pinteresque — comes through clearly here. Ms. Fraser details his love for cricket, tennis and bridge. He threw himself around recklessly on dance floors and swam “with a great splashing like a dog retrieving a ball.”\n\nHe loved hotel suites and chauffeured cars. He hated bugs. “It is impossible to exaggerate his hysterical hatred of flies: we nickname him the Moscophobe,” Ms. Fraser writes. When attacked by them, she reports one day, “he broke and ran like a horse, hooves stampeding, eyes rolling, back to the car.”\n\nHe was unhappy only when he wasn’t working. “He never wrote unless he had a sudden inspiration,” she notes. Once such an inspiration overtook him, he’d write all night, and through meals, to get his dialogue — for straight plays, screenplays, radio plays — down on paper. There are not a lot of deep insights into Pinter’s writing in “Must You Go?,” but we do witness him at work on major plays, including “Betrayal” (1978), and on screenplays for “The French Lieutenant’s Woman” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.”\n\nPinter voted for Margaret Thatcher in 1979, Ms. Fraser writes, an act he came to regret. This book charts his drift toward the left, and toward rambunctious political engagement. “Harold had a row with Joan Didion” about El Salvador, reads a typical report from 1981.\n\nAt times Ms. Fraser tired of his angry talk. After his death she found a dinner-party place card that he’d kept. On it, she had scribbled: “Darling — You are right. So SHUT UP.”\n\nThere are high moments in this couple’s final years, even after Pinter was found to have cancer of the esophagus in 2001. There are many far-flung holidays — “FamHols,” Ms. Fraser calls them — with endless grandchildren running about. The two witness Sofia Coppola make a film from Ms. Fraser’s book about Marie Antoinette. Pinter wins his Nobel. They thrill to Barack Obama’s election in 2008, only weeks before Pinter’s death. All the while he is coping with weight loss and wheelchairs and begins to resemble, Ms. Fraser writes, a “holy man-cum-skeleton.”\n\nInterviewed on the BBC a year or so before his death, Pinter was accused of being overly pessimistic about life and politics. He replied, Ms. Fraser writes, with a line that could stand as his motto: “Life is beautiful but the world is hell.”"
