The translation activities have an important channel of this transferring knowledge. We knew the most important translation activities started at the time of the Prophet Muhammad and was expanded during Abbasid Caliphate. Now, we will be stressing on the development of translation works with regards to Andalusia. As a result of the eagerness of Muslim to seek knowledge, institutions such as madrasah, libraries, elementary schools, research institutions grew rapidly in the 10th century and mosque schools had been upgraded into local universities. Andalusia became a famous translation centre in the region and it has known as the multilingual centre of learning and translation, gathering all people from different cultures and ethnicities who loved wisdom and knowledge. The light age of intellectual development of Islamic Civilization has reached its peak with beautiful cities of Almeria, Malaga, Cadiz, Hielva, Cordoba, Jean and Granada during 10th century. At the end of these developments, the translation became an art where it was dealing with languages, texts, and words. On the other hand, after a long period of time, it became a science. Translation also one of the school of science as it had become more systematic through time and the translated books must have undergone several tests of validity and precision in terms of its languages. In this article, translation activities in Andalus period which had a great influence on formation of Islamic philosophy were discussed.\n\nTwo contrasting approaches to the genesis of the Luzūmiyya rhymed in Ṭasmu serve as entry points into Abū al-ʿAlāʾ al-Maʿarrī’s (363 /973 – 449 /1058) double-rhymed diwan, Luzūm Mā Lā Yalzam.

The first takes the 7th/13th c. litterateur Ibn al-Qifṭī’s account of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walīd’s Damascus Mosque excavations, which was read before al-Maʿarrī, as the inspiration for the poem. This reading elicits the metaphorical connection, through the ubi sunt topos of the Arabic nasīb, between the extinct Arab tribe Ṭasm and the long-lost civilization unearthed in Damascus, and, further, the high irony with which the poem predicts the ineluctable annihilation of Islam itself. The second reading interprets the poem as the product of the extreme double-rhyme strictures al-Maʿarrī has imposed on himself—here the rhyme in -smu. The name/word Ṭasm/ṭasm (erasure, obliteration) inexorably drives the poem from the lore of tribal extermination to the lexical and motival world of the nasīb.\n\nThe newly loaded pdf is text-enabled.

Lutz Ilisch has long been regarded as an internationally recognized luminary in the field of numismatics. Just as he represents this research area in a considerable breadth, this publication on the occasion of his 70th birthday is also characterized by a great diversity of content and methodology of the included contributions. The volume contains articles with catalog character or on coin finds as well as others on the history of science and art, including an excursion into Islamic architecture. The timeframe in which coins, seals and weights are discussed ranges from the Sāsānian to the early modern period. With almost twenty authors, this volume, in English and German, brings together a circle of very different companions, friends and colleagues of Lutz Ilisch from no less than four continents, including coin dealers as well as professors. In addition, the Festschrift contains some personal words as well as a list of all publications by Lutz Ilisch from 1970 to 2020.\n\nhttps://wasmuth-verlag.de/shop/archaeologie-alte-kulturen/studia-numismatica-et-islamica-in-honorem-lutz-ilisch/\n\nDie Festschrift ehrt den herausragenden Wissenschaftler Dr. Lutz Ilisch, welcher von 1990 bis 2017 als Sammlungskustos an der Universität Tübingen die von ihm aufgebaute Forschungsstelle für Islamische Numismatik leitete und seit langem als international geschätzte Koryphäe dieses Fachgebiets gilt. So wie er die Münzkunde in einer beachtlichen Breite vertritt, zeichnet sich auch diese Publikation anlässlich seines 70. Geburtstags durch eine große inhaltliche und methodische Vielfalt der enthaltenen Beiträge aus, wobei der zeitliche Rahmen, in den die thematisierten Münzen, Siegel und Gewichte gehören, von der Sāsāniden- bis in die Neuzeit reicht und Beiträge mit Katalog-Charakter oder zur Fundnumismatik ebenso enthalten sind wie solche zur Wissenschafts- und Kunstgeschichte einschließlich der islamischen Architektur. Mit fast 20 Autorinnen und Autoren vereint der Band in deutscher und englischer Sprache einen Kreis ganz unterschiedlicher Weggefährten, Freunde und Kollegen Lutz Ilischs von nicht weniger als vier Kontinenten, darunter Münzhändler wie Professoren. Neben eher persönlichen Worten ist es natürlich auch ein Verzeichnis sämtlicher Publikationen Lutz Ilischs 1970–2020, das die Reihe der wissenschaftlichen Aufsätze ergänzt.\n\nAlso, see; \"Additions to the lead seals of the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula\" at, https: //www.academia.edu/17997940 & http://www.andalustonegawa.50g.com/Seals.html https://www.academia.edu/5751302/ ABSTRACT: This... more\n\nAlso, see; \"Additions to the lead seals of the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula\" at, https: //www.academia.edu/17997940\n\n&\n\nhttp://www.andalustonegawa.50g.com/Seals.html\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5751302/\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nThis article is a brief synopsis, of a larger unpublished work, which partially presents material that is largely unknown but fundamental to the understanding of the early days of the Umayyad-Arab coquest of the Iberian Peninsula. These are a series of lead seals, about 25 different types at the date of publication (now up to some 48 types since then), whose legends, though succinct, contribute largely unpublished information. This new evidence indicates that under the undeniable political turbulence, as strongly reflected in the narrative of the chronicles dealing with this period, there are institutions that are working effectively. Many of the seals included in the monograph could probably be closely linked to the extensive and high-quality Islamic coinage of that moment in what begins to look like a large and complex system of tax collecting and redistribution that was established practically from the very beginning by the Umayyad conquerors.\n\nThe work below has been superseded by a first corpus on the subject entitled, \"Los precintos de la conquista omeya y la formación de al-Andalus. 711-756.

Se trata de una serie de precintos de plomo, unos 25 tipos distintos, cuyas leyendas, aunque escuetas, aportan en su mayoría una información inédita. Con esta nueva evidencia se puede entrever que debajo de esa innegable turbulencia política, tan insistentemente reflejada en el relato cronista de ese periodo, hay instituciones que siguen funcionando eficazmente. Como se verá, muchos de los precintos que aquí recogemos debieron estar íntimamente ligados con las acuñaciones islámicas, formando parte ambos -monedas y precintos- del que comienza a vislumbrarse como un amplio y complejo sistema de recaudación y redistribución fiscal instaurado desde lo más temprano por los conquistadores omeyas.\n\nLos trabajos siguientes han sido superados por un primer corpus sobre el tema titulado, \"Los precintos de la conquista omeya y la formación de al-Andalus, 711-756\", publicado por Phillipe Sénac y el presente autor en el 2017.

The study also reveals the different meanings of the word “currency” in the Arabic language; the various kinds of monetary transactions and the kinds of currency that was rotated before the Umayyad era. In addition، it includes the explanation of the first attempts to mintage Islamic currencies in both the Umayyad and Rasheedy’s Era; the specification of the beginning of monetary reform; the discussion of the reasons that led Caliph Abdul-Malik Bin Marwan to take the decision to reform and the challenges which encountered him during this process. The study also illustrates the efforts made by his successors to secure the safety of the new Islamic and Arabic monitory basis، both gold and silver; investigates the forms of monetary reform by pointing out the original sources of the material of which the Arabic Islamic money was made of whether gold، silver or copper; and explains the methods by which the money was mintaged which also gave the currency its Arabic Islamic identification by adding Quranic verses، the Higra calendar and the name of the city where the money was mintaged. Models of the final forms and shapes of the Arabic Islamic currency that was rotated in the Islamic States is also given in the study ، with a follow up on the effects of the monetary reform on the economic progress in the Umyyad State agriculturally، industrially، commercially and administratively. The researcher followed the historical research method that depends greatly on collecting academic data from its original sources، in addition to using recent references that deal with the subject of the study with comparison and contrast based on neutrality and objectivity to achieve the academic goals of the study.\n\nThe lecture will be an update of the article: \"Nuevos documentos sobre la Conquista Omeya de Hispania: Los precintos de plomo, The new evidence for the Umayyad conquest of Hispania: the lead seals.\" احتام فتح الاندلس See at:... more\n\nThe lecture will be an update of the article: \"Nuevos documentos sobre la Conquista Omeya de Hispania: Los precintos de plomo, The new evidence for the Umayyad conquest of Hispania: the lead seals.\" احتام فتح الاندلس\n\nSee at: https://www.academia.edu/2324901/\n\nor at: http://www.andalustonegawa.50g.com/Seals.html\n\nThe objective of the lecture is to first correct some previous readings and some of the interpretations of function of the same and secondly to present some of the more important new seals that have been registered since the above article was published. We will try to argument their relation to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and the governors period of al-Andalus and to contrast them with the surprising number of new ones from the 'Greater Syria' area that have since appeared. The other objective of the talk is to publicly put to critical test, in front of a specialized audience, the readings and interpretations made of both sets of seals.\n\nFinaly, but urgently, to draw the attention of archeologist dealing with sites of the early Islamic period to the importance of these lead seals and the need to use electronic detection in their final cribs so as to avoid sending this vital information to the dump as had been done for many decades in Ruscino and most probably in many of the numerous other digs covering the vast area of the early Islamic period.\n\nGeneral opinion holds that architecture under the Umayyadcaliphs (661-750) developed in the Syro-Palestinian Levant, or Bilād al-Shām, and was indebted mostly to late Roman and early Byzantine traditions.

Despite the fact that a wealth of motives from Sasanian art was used in Umayyad decorative media, scholars have remained sceptical about the amount and nature of Sasanian elements in Umayyad architecture, perhaps because in the past »Sasanian influence« beyond the place and time of Sasanian rule has been argued in too sweeping terms. This contribution reviews the discussion and re-addresses the question, starting from the three-aisled halls in Umayyad palatial architecture, which are considered formal spaces for representation and audience and have been related to aMediterranean basilical scheme. Contesting the designation »basilical«, the discussion of formal and textual evidence brings to light specific characteristics and a distinct Umayyad spatial pattern. The three-aisled square columnar hall with an added axial room heightened by a powerful symbol of authority, a dome or an apse, is a formula unknown in Roman and Byzantine audience halls. Turning to Mesopotamian and Sasanian parallels, the discussion is extended to the Umayyad adoption of the aywān and of the triple portico with niche room, or T-shaped hall. This reconsideration of elements,from Mesopotamia under Sasanian rule, in Umayyad architecture is based on spatial analysis but may well be extended to architectural motifs\n\nThe earliest development of Arabic historical writing remains shrouded in uncertainty until the 9th century CE, when our first extant texts were composed.

This book demonstrates a new method, termed riwāya-cum-matn, which allows us to identify citation-markers that securely indicate the quotation of earlier Arabic historical works, proto-books first circulated in the eighth century.\n\nAs a case study it reconstructs, with an edition and translation, around half of an annalistic history written by al-Layth b. Saʿd in the 740s. In doing so it shows that annalistic history-writing, comparable to contemporary Syriac or Greek models, was a part of the first development of Arabic historiography in the Marwanid period, providing a chronological framework for more ambitious later Abbasid history-writing.\n\nReconstructing the original production-contexts and larger narrative frames of now-atomised quotations not only lets us judge their likely accuracy, but to consider the political and social relations underpinning the first production of authoritative historical knowledge in Islam. It also enables us to assess how Abbasid compilers combined and augmented the base texts from which they constructed their histories.\n\nThe arrival of the first Muslims in Palestine had profound effects for the country’s Jewish population.

The decline of Christian rule, and the\n\nappearance of a new religion by a monotheistic prophet from Arabia, initially\n\nled to close relations among the country’s Jews and first Muslims.\n\nMany Jews sought to explain the ministry of Muhammad (ca. 610-\n\n632 C.E.) through eschatology and viewed his message as a sign that\n\nthe end of days was near. Muslims, moreover, initially held a similar\n\ntheological understanding of the eschaton, which may have been influenced by their contacts with Jews. The Islamic reverence for the biblical Promised Land, and the construction of the Dome of the Rock—a shrine in which Jews played a major role—contributed to development of the eschatological views of both faiths in the early decades of Islam. This\n\nstudy explores some of the early literary and archaeological evidence of\n\nJewish and Muslim eschatological beliefs and contacts, as well as selected Christian accounts that also document this period. These writings include what are likely the earliest literary witnesses to Muhammad and the first Islamic dynasties at a time when the text of the Qur’an was still in flux. During this period, membership in the Muslim community was quite fluid and included those who embraced monotheism.\n\nThe paper discusses phenomena of continuity and inheritance in the Near East at the time of the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750), which had moved the political center of Islamic rule from Ḥiğāz to Šām (Greater Syria).

The creation of an immense empire did not happen in a vacuum. The setting up of a fiscal state apparatus, based on the prevailing taxation of an overwhelming majority of non-Muslim subjects, took place by continuing with many aspects of the Roman and Sasanid administrative systems. At the same time the caliphal institution reshaped itself as patrimonial (in the Weberian sense) and dynastic, along the lines of the Roman-Byzantine and Iranian imperialities, with an emerging rhetoric of ‘Muhammadian’ legitimacy. The new Islamic empire therefore reworked - with its own dose of originality – elements of more ancient political traditions, within what Neuwirth adequately defined the ‘epistemic space of late antiquity’.\n\nA new lead seal in the name of the Umayyad ruler 'Abd al-Malik b.

Marwān . Text, in three lines, can be translated as \"for (or to) 'Abd /al-Malik Emir / of the Believers.\" This rare Umayyad lead seal with legends only on one face is one of the earliest known that can be clearly dated as of the period of the prominent Umayyad Emir, ' Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān, 65-86 H / 685-705 CE. It puts light on the very important titular problem that of \"Emir of the believers\", that is of ALL the 'believers' inclusive of Ahl al-Kitab and others (Zoroastrians), versus that of \"Khalifat Allah\". This last only appears during the whole Umayyad period, and then solely as a generic, in just in a couple of years, never to reappear again, before the 77h monetary reform, and at that on scarce completely secondary type coins (in bronze and silver, NEVER ON GOLD!). These scarce bronze and silver coins both contain serious epigraphic errors in the actual word khalifa and the dates! These observations and the absolute scarcity of such secondary coinage indicate that they were not struck under any meaningful political or official administrative control. This should make one reasonably doubt the blanket use of \"Khalifate\" as it has retrospectively been put over the Rashidun and Umayyad rulers for which there is no contemporary material epigraphic evidence. It could very well be an accepted Abbasid period retrospective put over by the mainly classical Arabic Sunnie sources. Its near-infinite repetition has been taken up uncritically as factual by a long line of historians, including most modern ones.\n\nSee a complete discussion, still under construction, on this fundamental titular problem, with the due material references, p. 15-26.. in: https://www.academia.edu/34615447/SEALS_AND_COINS_OF_THE_UMAYYAD_CONQUEST_OF_HISPANIA_711-755.\n\nFor more on Umayyad seals: http://www.andalustonegawa.50g.com/Seals.html\n\nBlack Banners from the East tells the story of the first revolution in Islam which caused not merely the change of dynasties, but the end of the formative period of Islamic civilization.

It is the story of a messianic movement striving and succeeding in establishing the throne of its Caliph-Messiah. The two volumes of Black banners from the East describe the two stages of the revolution from its early Shī‘ī roots to the major military victories over the Umayyad army and the establishment of the ‘Abbāsid state. While the two volumes form a coherent study, each one of them is independent and can be read on its own.\n\nVolume I, The establishment of the ‘Abbāsid state - Incubation of a revolt, describes the clandestine activity of the movement that began after the collapse of al-Mukhtār's venture. It describes the methods, ideology, and system of activity which the members of the movement followed in order to prepare the hearts and minds and create the wide popular support for its goals. The mechanism of the incubation of this revolt is a fascinating story, describing in detail the development of a pure Shī’ī movement, the Hāshimiyya, into an ‘Abbāsī propaganda machine which prepared the revolt.\n\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE, its official name remained essentially unchanged for over a century, the Latin form Aelia merely being transliterated into the Arabic Īliyā.

This fact is attested on coins and seals dating from the Umayyad period. In the early 9th century CE, the name Īliyā fell out of use to be replaced by al-Quds, in recognition of the sacred status of Jerusalem. This study offers an explanation for delayed name change by examining the testimony of earliest surviving sources, including in particular the contemporaneous coins and the foremost Islamic monument that survives from Umayyad rule, the Dome of the Rock. New observations about this early Islamic shrine and its mosaic decoration are reported and analysed. The various strands of evidence are brought together and throw new light on the persistence of the name Īliyā for Jerusalem.\n\nبعد از اینکه اعراب در سال ۶۳۸ میادی ] ۱۶ یا ۱۷ هجری[ اورشلیم را فتح کردند، نام این شهر تا حدود یک قرن تقریبا دست نخورده ماند؛ با این تغییر کوچک که فقط عنوان لاتین آن که آئیلیا بود کمی عربی گردید و تبدیل به ایلیا شد. شاهد این مدعا -ثابت ماندن نام تا حدود یک قرن- سکه ها و مهرهایی است که از دوره اموی باقی مانده است. از سال های ابتدایی قرن نهم میادی ]اواخر قرن دوم هجری[ بود که عنوان ایلیا جای خود را به لفظ قدس ) )al-Quds داد، دلیل این نام گذاری هم جایگاه قدس یای بود که اورشلیم داشت. این پژوهش در نظر دارد تا با تکیه بر قدیم یترین منابع باقیمانده از دورهٔ اموی نظیر سکه های این عصر و همچنین قدیم یترین بنای باقیمانده از عصر حا کمان اموی، یعنی قب ةالصخره توضیحی برای این تأخیر در تغییر نام پیدا کند. همچنین مشاهدات و نظرات جدید دربارهٔ این بنای مقدس اسامی و نمای خاص موزاییکی اش آورده و تحلیل شده است. و در نهایت شواهد و مدارک مختلف را کنار هم چید هایم تا با نگاهی نو بقای یک صد سالهٔ نام ایلیا برای اورشلیم را بررسی کنیم.\n\nThe production of coins from the Taifa kingdoms is a reflection of the political fragmentation of al-Andalus in the fifth century AH.

Coin issues were irregular and the fineness of the coins was unstable. The interpretation of such a complex monetary policy required a numismatic treatise which would take into account all data related to the eleventh century coins. This is what this research is focused on. The methodology developed is explained below. It consists in analysing chronologically the production of coins from the different Taifa kingdoms, as well as in comparing them to each other. The metal composition of the coins has been taken into account, as the metallographic studies conducted over the last decades make it possible to clearly analyse this essential information. It is on the basis of this methodology that the results obtained have been varied and novel.\n\nThe following paper attempts to examine the process of narrowing of sacral space in churches during the Early Islamic period through the prism of urban changes in the cities of Jund al-Urdunn.

The study is also inspired by the recent works of KOKKONEN/SUNDELL (2012), who inspected if primogeniture influenced the durability of reigns in Europe in the period between 1000 and 1800 CE, and of BLAYDES/CHANEY (2013), who analysed for a big sample of polities the dynamics of ruler change for medieval Europe and the Islamic world before 1500 CE. The aim of the present study is more modest and does not include the creation of elaborate mathematical models as did KOKKONEN/SUNDELL and BLAYDES/CHANEY. With several statistical tools, a smaller sample of polities in the period 0-800 CE is inspected with regard to the sequence and duration of reigns, differentiated along the qualification if a reign was initiated “violently” or “non-violently”. Thereby, the general durability of reigns, the possible persistency of periods of frequent violent ruler-change and the temporal dynamics of these “games of thrones”, which not only affected rulers and dynasties as well as courts and nobilities, but also entire societies and polities, across longer periods of time will be illustrated. Differences and commonalities of polities from various regions of the early medieval world will become visible. At the same time, the value of such quantitative analyses for research on a period for which source evidence is often characterised as insufficient for such attempts will be highlighted.\n\nThis book is the first systematic collection and discussion of dwellings in the Umayyad ‘cities’ (madāʾin) and ‘palaces’ (quṣūr) of Bilād al-Shām.

Giuseppe Labisi offers an overview of the apartments within and identifies the architectural models that inspired Umayyad dwellings. This study also allows the precise identification of the origin of pre-Islamic dwelling models and their reinterpretation in Umayyad domestic architecture. Through classification, the author has been able to group the apartments of quṣūr chronologically by the reigns of the Umayyad caliphs. The identification of the dictates of Islamic domestic tradition and the characteristics of early Islamic Arabia and Late Antique houses offer original insight and allow us to situate the Umayyad residences of Bilād al-Shām in their wider cultural context. Additionally, Umayyad dwellings have been classified and presented in a rich catalogue as an appendix within the text.\n\nThe retreat of the Byzantine Army from Syria in around 650 CE, in advance of the approaching Arab armies, is one that has resounded emphatically in the works of both Islamic and Christian writers, and created an enduring motif: that of... more\n\nThe retreat of the Byzantine Army from Syria in around 650 CE, in advance of the approaching Arab armies, is one that has resounded emphatically in the works of both Islamic and Christian writers, and created an enduring motif: that of the Islamic-Byzantine frontier. For centuries, Byzantine and Islamic scholars have evocatively sketched a contested border: the annual raids between the two, the line of fortified fortresses defending Islamic lands, the no-man's land in between and the birth of jihad. In their early representations of a Muslim-Christian encounter, accounts of the Islamic-Byzantine frontier are charged with significance for a future 'clash of civilizations' that often envisions a polarised world. A. Asa Eger examines the two aspects of this frontier: its ideological and physical ones. By uniting an exploration of both the real and material frontier and its more ideological military and religious implications, he offers a more complex vision of this dividing line than has been traditionally disseminated. With analysis grounded in archaeological evidence as well the relevant historical and religious texts, Eger brings together a nuanced exploration of this vital element of medieval history."
