        "text": "Seville\n\nlast update: 12 January 2021\n\n\"Quien no ha visto Sevilla, No ha visto maravilla\"\n\nHe who Seville has not seen, has not seen a marvel great\n\nPopular Spanish saying\n\nA glance back in time…\n\nIn a book published in 1853 the author C.J. Gayley employed the term \"Sevillised Life\" to describe his winter stay in the city. It was a time when young English gentlemen 'presented letters', smoked cigars with the local Marques, visited gentlemen's clubs and the opera, took shelter from the rain in estancios de tabacos, read Don Quixote, breakfasted on chocolate and toast whilst smoking a cigarillo, and were ardent members of the \"drawing-room of Sevillian society\" - the afternoon walk along the pleasant shore of the Guadalquivir.\n\nThey would buy a corse capa (cloak), carry a porro (a long polished yew stick with a heavy knob), wear a faja (a kind of very long, scarlet woven scarf wrapped around the waist), learn to eat for breakfast eggs fried in oil and miga (bread-crumbs steeped in water and sprinkled with salt, with hot oil poured over it, and a touch of garlic added), and when venturing out alway replace the dagger in their faja with a loaded six-barrel revolver.\n\nA separate hand-book for travellers in Spain dated 1845 allocated three full pages to informing our young English gentleman how to wear properly a capa, noting that it covered a multitude of sins whilst giving the wearer an air of stately decency. The conclusion was that a genuine Spaniard \"would sooner part with his skin than his capa\".\n\n\"Courting at a Ring-Shaped Pastry Stall at the Seville Fair\" was painted in 1852 by the Sevillian artist Rafael Benjumea (1825-1887). The young man is dressed in what I think might be a Calaniés hat, and a coarse capa (cloak) of panno pardo (brown cloth), turned up with scarlet.\n\nThat same guide book of 1845 tells us \"Seville is one of the most agreeable towns in Spain for a lengthened residence. The shooting is first-rate, the theatre is tolerable, the masquerading at carnival time entertaining, … Seville is the alma mater of the bull-fight, … and the ceremonial of the Semana Santa is second in interest to that of Rome alone\". What's more Sevillians \"delight in cool repose and the cigar\", hate bustle, exertion, or being put out of their way, but enjoy the occasional pleasure \"with the rapture of children\".\n\nFirst things first…\n\nThe first thing to do in our hunt for \"Sevillised Life\" is to understand the map of the city (ciudad), with its 11 different districts (distritos) and 108 neighbourhoods (barrios). According to a Spanish law of 2003 (Ley de Grandes Ciudades), as capital of Andalucía, Seville decided in 2005 to create 11 districts. Each district has its own Junta Municipal de Distrito, and as a municipality (municipio) the city has its own town hall (ayuntamiento). Just to make things that bit more complicated, the city is also capital of a Spanish province (Provincia de Sevilla) with the same name, and which is the largest of the 8 provinces that make up Andalucía.\n\nSo Seville is a city, one of 106 municipality of the province of Seville, capital of the same province, capital of Andalucía, and Spains 4th largest metropolitan area.\n\nAbove we can see the 11 districts (distritos) of the city, surrounded by some of the municipalities that make up the province of Seville. Below we have the barrios that make up the Casco Antiguo, the old city centre.\n\nCasco Antiguo is the central area of Seville where the main shops and the principal tourist attractions of the city are located, including the Cathedral, the Giralda, the Alcázar, the Archivo General de Indias, the Torre del Oro, the Casa Consistorial de Sevilla (City Hall), the Palacio de San Telmo, the Museo de Bellas Artes, the Palacio de la Condesa de Lebrija, the Casa de Pilatos, and the distinctly modern Metropol Parasol.\n\nDistrito Sur is notable for the presence of the Plaza de España, the Parque de María Luisa, the Museo Arqueológico, the Prado de San Sebastián and the Museo de Artes y Costumbres Populares.\n\nTriana was historically split from the main city, and it was known as an arrabal, i.e. outskirts, or a small working-class town with its own houses, shops and businesses. Triana is placed on an almost-island between two branches of the Guadalquivir, narrowly linked to the mainland in the north. At the top of the district is the Monasterio de la Cartuja, the Isla Mágica amusement park, and the original site of Expo '92.\n\nMacarena is the name of the area of Seville located north of the city centre, and includes the Basílica de la Macarena and the Parliament of Andalucía (in the old Hospital de las Cinco Llagas).\n\nDistrito Norte includes the Cementerio de Dan Fernando and the former monastery of San Jerónimo de Buenavista.\n\nLos Remedios, south of Triana, derives its name from a Carmelite convent (Convento de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios) of the same name found in that area. It is also on the Isla de La Cartuja, and includes the Puente de San Telmo and the Museo de Carruajes.\n\nIn 2019 it was reported that the average income per person in Seville was € 11,056, considerably lower than that of Madrid and Barcelona (where it exceeds € 15,000). Variations across the city are quite substantial, with the average income per person in Los Remedios being € 15,910, but only € 7,334 in the district Cerro-Amate. Again for income per household, the highest is in Los Remedios with € 43,406, and the lowest in Cerro-Amate with € 19,821.\n\nAround the same time the average price per square metre in the Andalusian capital was € 1,631, but could easily exceed € 2,000 per square metre in Casco Antiguo (€ 2,516), Triana, Los Remedios and Nervión (€ 2,262). Price increases in excess of 10% annually have been seen in recent years. More markedly in Cerro del Águila-Amate, prices actually decreased by nearly 4%, to a low of € 915 per square metre.\n\nPre-history\n\nThe early and intense human presence in Andalucía is visible in the abundance and wide distribution of archaeological records, ranging from the most remote dates to the pre-Roman cultures of the final centuries of the 1st millennium BC. We can see below that Seville might not have been as popular with prehistoric man as the regions around Málaga or Jaén, but Seville is nevertheless known for the Dolmen de la Pastora at the famous Copper AgeValencina de la Concepción site. And around Seville there are other Neolithic sites dating back to ca. 4500 BC.\n\nAbout 6 km from the historic centre of Seville and located on the right bank of the Guadalquivir there is the archaeological site of Valencian de la Concepción (see this article).\n\nThe site was first studied in the late 19th century for its monumental megalithic constructions, but over time it has probably become the most intensively excavated prehistoric settlement in Spain (many were 'rescue interventions' due to urban developments). Above we can see a dolmen, on the site that has been called \"the Stonehenge of Sevilla\". Radiocarbon dating suggests that the site was occupied from the around 3000 BC to possibly as late as ca. 1500 BC, and the settlement covered between 3 and 4 million square metres (but probably not all at the same time). This was a Copper Age settlement, as evidenced by the large number of crucibles, crucible-furnaces, slag and minerals found. Most of the objects found were tools and weapon-tools, especially axes, although ornaments and some weapon-tools have been found in burial contexts.\n\nIn a site very near to Valencian de la Concepción is the Tholos de Montelirio, where a tholos is a kind of beehive tomb. It was probably built sometime between 2900 BC and 2800 BC. Numerous artefacts made of exotic materials such as ivory, gold or amber, as well as ceramic, lithic, bone and textiles were found there. In particular a total of 159 objects made of ivory were found, i.e. combs and numerous zoomorphic figurines. It is one of the most important ivory assemblages recovered so far from a Copper Age site. But in addition a collection of amber artefacts were found, considered to be \"the largest collection of amber objects from recent prehistory found on the Iberian Peninsula\". Another report noted that the amber found represented by weight 90% of all the amber objects found on the peninsula.\n\nIn a recent article two beads from a cave at La Molina (near Seville) were analysed in depth. They date from the 3rd millennium BC and the suggestion is that they were coated with a tree resin in an attempt to imitate the appearance of amber. Amber was already in the 4th millennium BC considered a rare, exotic and high prestige item with important symbolic properties. An outstanding question concerns the owners of these beads, did they know they were imitations, or are we looking at prehistoric fakes?\n\nIt is thought that around the 8th century BC, when iron took the place of bronze for the first time in Andalucía, the Turdetani (see the Tartessos culture) built a town (Spal or Ispal) on the banks of the Guadalquivir. This makes the city of Seville at least 2,700 years old. The area was very fertile, rich in natural resources, and accessible with the navigable Gualalquivir. In addition, the location offered abundant drinking water and was considered 'temperate' in the long, dry, hot summers. On the other hand, the land was 'swampy' and prone to flooding. The original town was (probably) on a long, narrow island (or dune about 450 m by 200 m) defined by two rivers (streams) flowing into the Gualalquivir, the Barqueta and the Tagarete. This meant that the town could be approached by ships arriving throughout the year. Both these rivers/streams have disappeared, with the Tagarete now being deviated by the Tamarguillo into the Corta de la Cartuja (which as far as I can see is artificial canal which, with the Guadalquivir, created the Isla de La Cartuja).\n\nBelow on the left we can see how the Corta de la Cartuja created the Isla de la Cartuja, and on the right Seville's major road infrastructure and bridges.\n\nThe first archaeological remains place man in this region sometime between 4500 BC and 3500 BC, when Lacus Ligustinus (Ligustino Lake) was still open to the Atlantic Ocean (it is thought to have remained open until about 1000 BC). Flooding regularly occurred along the lower Guadalquivir Valley (now known as the Doñana National Park) almost up to where Seville is located today. Sediment formed a system of islands or dunes, and it was there that the “mythical” port of Ispal was built between 1000 BC and 800 BC. The region gradually silted up, probably in part due to removal of forest cover.\n\nThe Guadalquivir floodplain is through to have evolved as follows. During the Neolithic period (say ca. 4400 BC), the last post-glacial sea level rise created a marine-estuarine environment (a) that fully occupied the bay but did not quite reach the future site of Itálica. During the Late Bronze Age (1150–750 BC), tide flats and sandy spits rapidly increased and the alluvial plain became a river delta (b) near Coria del Río. The river mouth was displaced towards the Atlantic in a gradual process of silting up. During the Turdetan-Iberian and Roman periods (i.e. late Iron Age to Roman times), supra-tidal marshes and alluvial plains were consolidated and the coastal spit and the dune system increased (370 BC–418 AD). The estuarine shore, created a multitude of floodplains behind it, including Lacus Ligustinus (c).\n\nSince the Late Bronze Age there was an intensive occupation of these lands. The Orientalising period and the Tartessian culture, which expanded in the Southwestern Iberian Peninsula, coincided with the arrival and settlement of the Phoenicians. The coastal settlements located from the Strait of Gibraltar to the mouth of Guadalquivir were connected to the Phoenician colony of Gadir (today Cádiz). Metals from the mining zone in the current province of Huelva were exported through the Guadalquivir and its tributaries, such as the Guadiamar River. This trade is presumed to have increased the population and the number of sites on the estuary banks, and Strabo (ca. 64 BC - 24 AD) wrote about the estuary zone with navigable waterways and densely populated shores.\n\nPoor agricultural soils are found on the northern side of the Lacus Ligustinus watershed, on the right bank of the Guadalquivir. Furthermore, the topography did not offer convenient high ground for the protohistoric settlement. A polynuclear-style pattern of settlement, characterised as numerous oppida (fortified Iron Age settlements), have been found on the southern side of the Lacus Ligustinus, especially from Los Palacios (Seville) to the mouth of the Guadalquivir. Some of the main locations became Roman cities, such as Nabrissa (indigenous place name Lebrija), Asta (Mesas de Asta, Jerez de la Frontera), Ebora (Cortijo de Évora, Sanlúcar de Barrameda) and Conobaria. They were positioned in elevated and well-defended positions, with fresh water supply, protection against the floods, and with navigational control from their ports.\n\nAt the end of the Tartessian period, during the transition to the Turdetan era (ca. 500 BC), the small sites disappeared and the population was concentrated in large sites with access to the sea or the estuarine waterways, as in the case of the city of Asta. The beneficial trade of metals declined after the fall of Tyre in the 539 BC, and the related Phoenician colonies and indigenous cities in the Iberian Peninsula also declined. During the 5th century BC, the main urban sites, surviving from the Tartessian period, were located in elevated positions beside the marshes. They exploited the agrarian hinterland and the sea resources, and they used the ports to trade their agrarian surpluses.\n\nAfter the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), Roman control of the region probably changed the relationships between the local civic powers. The defeat and punishment of Asta, one of the main territorial centres, is confirmed in written and epigraphic sources. It probably affected the political order on the Ligustinus banks to a considerable extent. Afterwards, the arrival of Italic peoples to this city will have been very influential to the economy of the zone. The record of Campanian pottery (black gloss tableware, types B and C) shows the intensity of the trade exchanges in the late Republican period (i.e. 146-31 BC). It will have continued during the Early Roman Empire (31 BC-193 AD), with the development of the viticulture (and despite the increasing enclosure of the Lacus Ligustinus). A transformation of the rural settlement pattern started in the 3rd century AD, as part of a general phenomenon in the Hispanic Roman provinces (to 472 AD). Trade and, consequently, navigation is supposed to have become reduced in the Lacus Ligustinus. The silting up of the estuary reduced the size of suitable channels for navigation, which became more dependent on tides. During this later period the alluvial landscape was widespread, the sandy spit augmented the enclosed feature of this space and the dunes expanded (d).\n\nThe early “dune/island” ran from Los Jardines de Murillo to Plaza del Salvador, so a small area south of the Casco Antiguo covering the barrio Santa Cruz (which in medieval times was the Jewish quarter of the city). Around the dune an island was built 550 m and 300 m wide, with a circumference of about 1.7 km. It ran from the corner of Calle Rosario with Calle Augusto Plasencia and over to Calle Gloria and Plaza de Doña Elvira, and from the corner of Calle de Placentines and Calle Francos, over to Calle Federico Rubio.\n\nExperts suggest that the original name Ispal was first Latinised to Hispalis, then Išbīliya with the Muslim conquest, and then finally Castellanised to Sevilla. It is thought that Ispal might have its origins in the Phoenician language. The meaning would be an island that supports, or an island that bears a pillar, thus the often suggested relationship with the legendary foundation of the city by Hercules. Later suggestions point to a more realistic reference to the palafitte construction of the early city. However the language root is also linked to lagoon or marshy land.\n\nThe legend of Hercules, son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmena, is that he must do twelve labours. The 10th labour was to find Geryon and steal his red cattle (Geryon was thought by the Greeks to live in Tartessos). The story goes that once Hercules had killed the 3-headed, 3-bodied monster he decided to found a city (Seville) as a place of peace and fertile fields. One story has him nailing together some sticks in a swampy area on the banks of the Guadalquivir, and another story has him marking the place with six stone pillars (on which later Julius Caesar would found the city). Hercules is also associated with the general region in that the Pillars of Hercules separate Europe from Africa and connect the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. Even within such a traditional story as that of Hercules, there are layers of even more ancient traditions. The Roman Hercules, was the Greek Heracles, to which they added some anecdotal details concerning the geography of the central Mediterranean. But Heracles has also been identified with Melqart, an earlier god of the Phoenician city of Tyre.\n\nSetting aside all the stories, archaeological evidence suggests that the region was occupied in the period between 4500 BC and 3500 BC, and there are indications that man was using wooden stilts or piles ca. 800 BC. Despite mythology and tradition, there appears to be no information on why the earliest town later disappeared, and was then successively replaced by the Turdetana, Iberian and Punic cultures.\n\nIt is suggested that Phoenicians (from the city of Tyre) established their first settlement at Cádiz in about 850 BC. They then ventured out in three directions, north up the Portuguese coast to tap deeper into the Atlantic bronze trade, south down the African coast, and back towards the east along the coast of Andalucía. They established numerous sites along the cost, all having one feature in common. All were built on previously unoccupied land but in the vicinity of indigenous settlements and shared other features such as occupying a promontory at the mouth of a river, having a necropolis on the far side of a river to the settlement itself, and having a natural harbour. Their first buildings were, apparently, large mud brick dwellings divided into separate rooms. Some rooms had hearths and they were connected by high thresholds, another Phoenician habit. The buildings were organised along streets that were terraced to follow the slope of the hill, and some areas were protected by a defensive ditch. Warehouses were built with storage containers, and the storage capacity appeared to exceeded local needs, suggesting that it played a role in trade.\n\nEvidence of metalworking also appeared from the 7th century BC. Large numbers of fish remains suggest that intensive fishing occurred from an early date. The period roughly 850 BC to 250 BC is sometimes known as the \"orientalising period\" implying that primitive native tribes embraced the architecture and standards of living of the more advanced civilisations from the east, including their ceramics, jewellery, clothing, beliefs and weapons. The Phoenicians were the dominant trading partners with the Tartessians and Iberians in Andalucía from the 9th to the 6th centuries BC. However growing competition from Greek traders and then the Punic colony of Carthage, combined with unrest back in Tyre was to prove fatal for them. In 539 BC Tyre was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire and Tyrhenians abroad effectively became stateless. The emerging Carthaginian Empire was poised to take advantage in the western Mediterranean. The Phoenician settlements in Andalucía had an option, become part of the Carthaginian sphere or cease trading.\n\nPhoenician merchants are said to have arrived in the region of Seville about 700 BC to take advantage of the local copper and silver mines in the area of Huelva, turning Ispal into a commercial colony (here we have the link to the Phoenician god Melqart). As with most ports, Ispal probably was built on a mix of cultures, with the Phoenicians (ca. 1500 BC - 539 BC), the Tartésicas (ca. 1200 BC - 500 BC), the Turdetani (ca. 500 BC - 206 BC), and the Carthaginians (814 BC - 146 BC). It has been suggested that with the collapse of the Phoenician Empire, the Carthaginians fought and defeated the Tartessos, destroying Ispal.\n\nOn 30 September 1958, a treasure of gold objects was found by workmen refurbishing a public building at the top of a hill overlooking the fertile Guadalquivir river valley. The Carambolo gold hoard consists of two sets of objects, representing a total of 21 ornaments, including 16 rectangular plaques, two pendants, a pair of bracelets, and a pendant necklace. They have recently been dated to a period around the 8th century BC, except for the necklace, which was probably Cypriot in origin and dated to around the 6th century BC, the period when the treasure was concealed. Initially the location was considered a Tartessian settlement occupied by an indigenous people whom the Phoenicians would have found when they appeared in the lower Guadalquivir area. Claiming the settlement as genuinely Andalusian was an attractive option, although some experts argued that Seville only really emerged as a Phoenician settlement. This idea was later strengthened based on the original place name of the city (Spal or Hispal), which shows Semitic links. But for at least half a century Carambolo was seen as an indigenous village that arose before the oldest Phoenician presence in the area, and if the objects found were sacred, then they must have come from a Tartessian temple within a Tartessian settlement.\n\nIn parallel, but especially since the end of 1990's, some experts continued to accumulate evidence suggesting that the entire Carambolo site could have been an eastern sanctuary, and not a settlement belonging to the autochthonous community. In this context, the area known as “Carambolo Bajo” would have been, in reality, a service district situated in the heart of the temple. Therefore, Carambolo would not have been a Tartessian town with a Phoenician temple. To deny the indigenous character of the Carambolo, it was necessary to offer a functional rereading of the set of jewels that since 1958 made the place famous. The change would be substantial, the treasure would cease to be the luxurious garb of a monarch, and become the sacred garments of some sacrificial bovids and the liturgical garb of the officiating priest.\n\nField work carried out at the site in the first decade of the 21st century confirmed the eastern character of the settlement and its sacred function, but some experts still preferred to see the site as an example of Tartessian architecture. Yet others suggested that the site might have had a temple consecrated to a Phoenician goddess, and the articles found might be associated with rites practiced there.\n\nTo cut a long story short, recent excavations have fully confirmed the second hypothesis, the one that saw a religious ceremonial complex on the hill (see the sanctuary above). The building began as a simple rectangular structure before being dismantled and expanded in the 8th century BC. For those readers who would like to know more about El Carambolo I would warmly recommend this extensive article in Spanish.\n\nThe Roman Period\n\nThe Punic (i.e. Carthaginian) colonisation of the region (and the implied destruction of Ispal), led to the creation of the myth of Ispavilia (about which I can find little factual evidence). There is evidence showing a military presence of the Carthaginians in 237 BC, and a town certainly existed in the region, because in 206 BC Roman troops captured it during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC).\n\nAfter their defeat in the First Punic War (264-241 BC), the Carthaginians, used the Southern and Eastern parts of the Iberian Peninsula to rebuild some sort of territorial and economic 'empire'. A big part of Spain became a logistical and military base, thousands of mercenaries were hired and local subjects and allies recruited, and by the time Hannibal (247-181 BC) marched on Italy, a sizeable part of his army was built around a hard core of African and Iberian or Celtiberian contingents (see Celtiberian horse fibula above). These troops were familiar with foreign warfare through their previous employment as xenoi in Sicily and Greece, i.e. free-born volunteers. They employed new types of weapons, such as the thureos (oval shield), the cut-and-thrust straight sword, and bronze Montefortino-type helmets.\n\nFrom ca. 550 BC until ca. 400 BC, soldiers still used heavy and costly iron weapons, and armour made of bronze plate over a felt backing. Swords were short cut-and-thrust infantry weapons with a wide blade. Excavations yielded some beautiful daggers with a wide triangular tapering blade, often decorated with intricate silver inlay designs, altogether more suitable for exhibiting status than for battle. However, the main offensive weapon was still the long, heavy thrusting spear, with spearheads up to 60 cm long. Protection was a leather helmet reinforced with a bronze or iron rim, and a round bronze breast- and back-plate over a felt backing designed to cover the neck and shoulders. This was a heavy and costly panoply, apt for hand-to-hand combat between aristocratic \"Homeric-type\" champions. These are not the sort of weapons useful for light infantry or guerrilla tactics. Poorer troops would have been less well protected, but they have left little trace in the archaeological record, i.e. no monuments or imposing burials for those of the lower classes of society. During this period a proper ‘cavalry’ did not yet exist, i.e. mounted units, fighting in a concerted way, employing recognisable tactics, and capable of playing a distinct role in the battlefield. Some leaders and distinguished warriors probably went into battle on horseback, but would have fought on foot, i.e. a horse was a status symbol associated with warrior aristocracies. By the early years of the 5th century BC a distinctive ‘peninsular’ panoply had developed. Basically, it was the result of a strong local impulse founded on Tartessian traditions, but it also owed much to external influences coming from both Italy (prototypes for the falcata) and north of the Pyrenees, where the first soliferrea and pila were probably forged (ca. 4th century BC).\n\nDuring this period ca. 400 BC to ca. 230 BC formal burial in cemeteries was extended to a wider stratum of the population (but not to everyone). Cemeteries with up to 500-600 burials were known, and those with 100-plus burials became common. Moreover, during the 4th century BC, anywhere between 35% and 60% of burials in Iron Age cemeteries contain weapons. Clearly weapons had become more accessible, but they had also been simplified and standardised. Armour became more functional and less conspicuous and expensive. Shields, now universally round and wooden, had a simple central iron handgrip with long triangular ‘wings’ to fix it to the shield body. During the 4th century there was no proof of bronze helmets or oval shields being used. As for offensive weapons, the curved pre-Roman style falcata became, during the first half of the 4th century BC, almost the only sword type used in Iberia. Iron spearheads and socketed iron butts for thrusting spears became shorter and had wider blades. Interestingly, arrowheads and sling bullets are completely absent in burials, and are never represented in art. Some experts have suggested that these types of long-range projectiles were rejected in warfare by the Iberians, as by other Mediterranean peoples during this period, as being considered cowardly and effete.\n\nOverall, grave goods showed a clear standardisation of weapons typical of infantry fighting in close order, but also capable of opening its lines to fight in skirmish if necessary. The basic panoply consisted of a heavy javelin, a thrusting spear, sword and shield, together with a leather helmet and some form of textile armour. In this orientalising period horse bits, spurs and other elements of horse harness were very rare in Iberian tombs, but often found in the so-called ‘princely’ burials. It shows that during the 4th century BC there was no true ‘Iberian’ cavalry fighting on horseback, or riding as military units. Less that 5% of warriors rode into battle as nobles and leaders of men, but all would have still fought on foot.\n\nIn a later period (ca. 230 to ca. 100 BC) a substantial number of actual weapons have been found in cemeteries, although admittedly in much smaller numbers than in the 4th century BC. On the other hand, there were now the vases with many images of fully armed warriors represented either fighting in battle, in gladiatorial funeral contests, or performing ritual dances. These images are also quite detailed, and can be compared with each other to provide a picture for the different regions. A wealth of sculptural evidence is also available, as are the many bronze warrior figurines found in sanctuaries in Andalucía. Coins, minted in quantity since the second half of the 3rd century BC, also provide information on weapons.\n\nAround 237 BC Iberia became an extremely important logistics base for Carthage in its struggle with Rome, providing silver, raw materials for the war effort, and soldiers. The peninsula quickly became a battlefield when the Romans landed in Empúries in 218 BC trying to sever Hannibal’s supply lines. An ever increasing number of Iberians and Celiberians took part in the war, fighting for both sides either as subjects, allies or mercenaries. During this phase, the traditional weaponry of the period was modified and adapted to the new situation of high-intensity warfare, i.e fighting to the death in big pitched battles.\n\nThe Carthaginians were expelled from Spain after the battle of Ilipa in 206 BC, but this victory was immediately followed by a war of resistance against the Romans, It was only at the end of the Celtiberian Wars (which ran from 181 BC to 133 BC), with a Roman victory at Numantia, that a lasting peace was found (at least until the Sertorial War in 80 BC to 72 BC).\n\nAfter the battle of Ilipa the Romans went on to build a new city of Italica, just 9 km from modern-day Seville. There is historical evidence indicating that Scipio Africanus (236-183 BC) settled there a contingent of wounded soldiers in 205 BC. The location was both strategically well placed to control the region around the Guadalquivir, and also became an important centre of the re-distribution of metals mined at Rio Tinto and Aznalcóllar in the Sierra Morena. It is thought that a small pre-Roman Italica existed as early as the 3rd century BC.\n\nSeville itself was renamed Hispalis, and developed into a large Roman city. Italica remained also an important Roman base, and was the birthplace of both Trajan (53-117 AD) and Hadrian (76-138). Hispalis was the Latinisation of Ispal, and Julio César renamed it “Colonia Julia Romula Hispalis”. It has been suggested that Italica was also built for the simple reason that, at that time, Seville being on dune islands could not easily be enlarged, and there was the constant risk of flooding. Archaeologists have found ceramic remains showing that the local styles slowly “fusioned” with those imported from Rome. There is a suggestion that the expansion of Hispalis only started after 150 BC, but there are texts showing that by 100 BC Hispalis rivalled Cádiz in importance and was a major port. There are later texts that reference the strong walls of Hispalis. So over time Hispalis became one of the most important industrial centres of Bética, whilst Italica evolved as a Roman residential city. Bética was one of the Roman provinces of Hispania, and took its name from the fact that the Guadalquivir was originally called the Baetis (the capital of Bética was Corduba). We should not forget that the region was known for its mines (gold, silver, copper and lead), and for its agriculture (cereal, olive oil and wine), as well as the famous garum or fermented fish sauce.\n\nOne report (from ca. 293 AD) placed Hispalis as the 11th most important Roman city, and there are records of at least two attempted invasions by the Mauri (Moors) during that period.\n\nChristianity arrived in Hispalis in the later 2nd century AD, and the Saints Justa and Rufina were martyred in 287 AD for refusing to worship the old Phoenician god Astarté.\n\nInitially Italica remained a Turdetanian settlement within which lived a growing community of Italians and Roman citizens, remembering that it was only granted municipal status under Augustus (63 BC - 14 AD). This was probably ca. 15-14 BC, since it was around then that the town minted a limited issue of low denomination bronze coins. But as Hispania Ulterior Baetica came to symbolise Roman power in the south-west, so Italica grew in importance. Excavations clearly show the existence of large public buildings, a temple to Apollo built from private and public subscription, substantial walls with at least one circular-plan tower, a large profusely decorated theatre and portico, and a large set of public baths. Italica under Hadrian grew considerably as it acquired colonial status, but most of the growth was residential buildings, some quite large and sumptuously decorated with mosaics (but few or no public tenement blocks). The baths (termas mayores) were probably the largest set of public baths in the Hispaniae.\n\nHere we have just two mosaics from Italica, above is Helios, a detail from the Planetarium Mosaic, and below a detail from the Bird Mosaic. Check out this webpage on the mosaics along the Roman Baetica route.\n\nThe Vandals and Visigoths\n\nIn 426 AD the city was captured by the Vandals of Gunderico (379-428), before later becoming a Visigoth city (the city was in the hands of the Suevos between 429 until ca. 450). There are claims that Seville was the Visigoth capital for the kings Amalaric (502-531), Theudis (ca. 470-548), and Theudigisel (ca. 500-549), whilst other Visigoth leaders preferred Toledo. In fact the last king was said to have been assassinated by a group of nobles Sevillanos during a candlelight dinner. Tradition has it that the cause was about his liking for prostitutes, but it probably had more to do with the running conflict between the Hispano-Roman and Visigoth communities.\n\nBy this time Hispalis had become known as Spali. One tradition has it that the Vandals caused so much destruction during their conquests that they always settled in provisional camps called Vandalen Haus, and that this became Vandalen Hause, which became Vandalaus, and then Andalaus, and finally Andalucía.\n\nIn 580 Hermenegild, son of the Visigoth king Liuvigild, rebelled and converted from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. He fled to Sevilla, and when that fell in 584 he went to Córdoba. Other stories say that Hermenegildo actually converted to Christianity in 585 in Sevilla and proclaimed himself king. His farther Leovigildo is said to have changed the course of the Guadalquivir, and the resulting drought was the downfall of the city.\n\nIt would appear that the Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting Hermenegild to Catholicism, and when the father Liuvigild died in 586 Leander also convinced the younger son Reccared I to renounce Arianism for Catholicism (see the Third Council of Toledo in 589 for more detail). Tradition has it that from then on Seville enjoyed a period of great prosperity.\n\nSan Leandro (ca. 534-601) and San Isidoro(ca. 560-636) were brothers, and both became bishops of Sevilla. Leandro was instrumental in converting the Visigoth kings to Catholicism, and Isidoro has been called “the last scholar of the ancient world” and was famous after his death for his Etymologiaeor encyclopedia (448 chapters in 20 volumes).\n\nThe story of Hermenegild given above is what might be considered the short-traditional version. But it's useful to delve a little deeper because it highlights how little we really know about events set in the distant past. The basic 'facts' are that Hermenegild (d. 585) was the eldest son of King Leovigild (r. 568-586). Hermenegild, from the seat of his authority in Seville, rebelled against his father and king. His rebellion lasted for only five years, with Hermenegild being defeated and captured in 584, and put to death in the following year.\n\nThe problem is that everything known about the rebellion and its aftermath is derived from four separate accounts written by bishops at various times in the forty years following the rebellion. Gregory of Tours (ca. 538-594), a Frankish bishop and chronicler, wrote parts of his Decem Libri Historiarum (Ten Books of History, but better known as the History of the Franks) contemporaneously with the rebellion, and thus his account follows the evolution of the rebellion over time. Pope Gregory the Great (ca. 540-604) wrote his Dialogues in the late 590's from his seat in Rome, and included the rebellion within his account, an event which occurred a decade before the beginning of his papacy. John of Biclaro (ca. 540-621), a Hispano-Roman bishop from Lusitania, was the first author of Spanish origin, and wrote his Chronicon in the early 7th century, nearly 30 years after the rebellion. Finally, Isidore, the Visigothic bishop of Seville, wrote both Etymologiae and his History of the Goths in 619, later revising and adding to it in 624, 40 years after the conclusion of the rebellion. While the four accounts agree on many parts of the rebellion, such as the general timeline and its outcome, they differ greatly in the details of the rebellion itself. One account may see religion as the primary motivation for Hermenegild's rebellion, while another may make no reference to religion at all, instead assigning his motivation to internal or external politics. This is the reality about what we think of as \"true history\".\n\nGregory of Tours portrayed Hermenegild and his rebellion in a positive light. In addition he wanted to promote the idea that widows should withdraw from public life upon the deaths of their husbands, and instead devote themselves to living a spiritual life. He thus assigned much of the blame for the rebellion squarely onto Leovigild’s wife, Queen Gosuintha, and her actions against Hermenegild.\n\nGregory the Great’s portrayal of Hermenegild is that of a hagiography, entirely focused upon the religious elements present within the rebellion. He painted a picture of Hermenegild as a martyr for his faith, and his rebellion as a holy war. He used this story of a Catholic fighting against an Arian to bolster anti-Arian sentiment, at a time when Arian Lombards were invading northern Italy. Hermenegild was seen as an example of an ideal ruler, who was willing to forfeit his life for his faith, and in doing so brought about the conversion of the entire kingdom.\n\nJohn of Biclaro wrote his Chronicon in the decade following one of the most important events in Spanish history, which defined the Catholic legacy of its people. In the Third Council of Toledo, held in 589, King Reccared formally converted the Kingdom of Toledo to Catholic Christianity. John's goal was to portray the Kingdom of Toledo as the successor of the Western Roman Empire. John directly paralleled the Kingdom of Toledo to Rome, with Reccared leading as the new Constantine. As a result John sought to emphasise the positive aspects of Leovigild’s rule, and argued against anything that might have disturb this view, including Hermenegild’s rebellion.\n\nIsidore of Seville, on the other hand, was writing approximately 30 years later, and following a period of instability. Isidore's writing strongly condemned rebellion under any circumstance, and emphasised family bonds. Thus Hermenegild’s rebellion was barely mentioned.\n\nThe Wikipedia article highlights the efforts of Gregory the Great to stress the martyrdom of Hermenegild in rebelling against the tyranny of his Arian father. The reality appears to be that Leovigild was an energetic monarch with an ambitious program of territorial, political and legal unification. He also fostered a court ceremonial of the majestic type. But Leovigild initially avoided a conflict with his rebel son Hermenegild, preferring to convene an Arian council in Toledo whose aim seems to have been to reach an understanding with the Catholics. Once his son had been defeated Leovigild was content to strip him of the royal insignia and remove him from the court, banishing him to Valencia and then to Tarragona. To some, Leovigildo acted more as a father would with a rebellious son. Many experts consider Leovigild's wife, Queen Gosuintha, a deeply Arian woman who was anchored in a past in which Visigoths and Hispano-Romans lived apart, each with their faith and also with their laws, customs and privileges. In any case it was finally the younger son, Reccared, who would bring both peoples to coexist under a single king and a single faith. There is a suspicion that Reccared was responsible for the death of his older brother, but it is also recognised that he achieved the eradication of heresy and the union of creed between Goths and Hispano-Romans. What is certain is that the Third Council of Toledo marked a turning point in the relations between the Gothic and Hispano-Roman peoples and was a landmark in the history of Spain. During the following centuries Reccared would be regarded as the model of a Christian prince.\n\nInterestingly one often sees and reads about Saint Isidore of Seville, but much less about the true patron saint of Seville, Saint Hermenegild.\n\nWhen Isidore became bishop of Seville, he brought about the conversion of Spain's Visigoth ruling class from Arianism to the Catholic observance. He also introduced important liturgical and administrative reforms in the Spanish church, clarified doctrine, and persuaded the church that every diocese should have a cathedral school or seminary. In portraits Isidore is traditionally pictured with a mitre, crosier, cope, and book. A curious legend had it that when Isidore was a boy his father saw him from afar amid a swarm of bees attracted by honey pouring from his mouth. Bees and beehives are now associated with the saint.\n\nSaint Hermenegild is usually presented with a axe, crown, sword, and cross. In some images of him he has an axe in his the skull, in others he is beheaded, also with an axe. His feast day is the day of his martyrdom, 13 April. The Royal and Military Order of San Hermenegildo was constituted in 1814. It is understood that the King, Ferdinand VII, identified his own life with that of Hermenegild. It is for this reason that the Military Order of San Hermenegildo rewards the military in the categories of General Officer, Officer and Non-commissioned Officer, “for their consistency in service and their impeccable conduct”. This means \"firmness and perseverance of mind in resolutions and purposes\", \"contributing to the preservation of good order, discipline and subordination\", and finally to having a \"spirit of sacrifice\".\n\nThe Moors\n\nAs one might expect, it is very difficult to unfold what life was like after the Islamic invasion. One expert note the difficultly as follows. Christian accounts are concise but often extremely brief, and they mirrored a society that feared the end of the world was near, i.e. an end that was part of God’s plan. Accounts were often taken from older narratives, and enriched by information that came to the ears of the authors. The Muslim chronicles were, on the other hand, full of rich details. Depiction of kings went beyond their physical appearance and virtues, and extended to their religious self. And there was much on a monarch’s ministers, wives, wars, and palace plots. The texts were sometimes bewilderingly vivid compared to the Christian versions, however they lacked geographic accuracy and were often driven by political agendas, so mixing historical details with fictional stories.\n\nAl-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik (ca. 674-715), the Umayyad Caliph, ordered Tāriq ibn Ziyād to invade Visigoth Hispania in 711-718. By 713 they had conquered Carmona, Seville, and Mérida. Seville was taken after a long siege, and until 716 it was the capital of Al-Andalus. Then Córdova became the capital, however many writers put the 'head' in Sevilla, and the 'heart' in Córdova (i.e. Seville was the administrative capital of Al-Andalus). The name of Seville was Arabised to Išbīliya, and concessions were extended to those who converted to Islam (Muladi) but not to those who remained Christian (Mozarabs). Mozarabs were legally required to pay the jizyah (a personal tax) and abide by a number of religious, social, and economic restrictions that came with their status. The main power base of the Umayyad was Syria, with Damascus as their capital. Rivalries between Arab tribes had forced a branch of the Umayyad to flee to Al-Andalus, where they established the Caliphate of Córdoba which lasted until 1031.\n\nOne element often overlooked is the taking of Seville by the Vikings in 844. According to one chronicle they arrived unexpectedly in 80 ships and resistance was disordered and ineffective. After pillaging and looting the city, they encountered a Muslim force which caused \"thousands of deaths in the barbarian lines\", captured four hundred alive, and burnt 30 abandoned ships. The hostages were beheaded \"before the eyes of the barbarians\", who then left. There was a second attack in 859, starting with the Northmen arriving like magicians from \"a country beyond the seas, close to the land of France\". They killed men, captured children, and looted property. In the battles the Northmen lost 500 men and four ships. They then sailed for Algeciras and burnt down the mosque, before leaving for the African coast. Today historians see the first attack in 844 as a continuation of assaults on the Aquitaine shores in 843-844, and where the Vikings probably stayed only 15-20 days in Spain. The second attack involving wintering in France in 858 before moving on to Spain in 858-859. It is said that a part of the Viking fleet (mainly Danes) remained in the Mediterranean for three years. Check out this article for a more in-depth look at the Viking invasion of Spain.\n\nFrom about 1023 through to 1091 Seville was the capital of a Taifa, a kind of independent principality ruled by the Dynasty Abadí (an old Arab family from Seville). However the Taifa were weak militarily, and in 1063 they were forced to buy peace and pay tribute to the Kingdom of Castile. In 1086 the Taifa princes invited the Almoravids to defend their territories from Alfonso VI (1040-1109). Being a Berber dynasty from Morocco, the Almoravids found it quite easy to return and annex the Taifa principalities in 1090.\n\nIn 1147 the Almohads (another, different Berber Muslim movement) conquered Marrakesh and by 1151 Seville had been absorbed into the Almohad Empire. The capital of Al-Andalus moved back and forth between Seville and Córdoba, but this did not stop Seville flourishing economically and artistically. In 1171 improvements to the outer walls were made to defend the city against floodwaters. Bridges were built, the Alcázar was enlarged, and the construction of a major new mosque was started (in the plot that is now occupied by the Cathedral). Over time Seville became the capital of the Almohad Empire.\n\nThe Almohad Empire absorbed Seville in 1151, thus began a time of cultural and social flourishing for the city. To reaffirm Islamic rule over the region, Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf (1135-1184) ordered the construction of a great mosque on the land currently occupied by a Christian cathedral. From March 1172 to April 1198, artisans and workers from all social classes collaborated in the construction of the site, which was inaugurated, despite not being completed, in 1182. Ahmad Ben Baso, renowned architect of Andalusian origin, had been commissioned to build the mosque. He followed the example of the Buhayra palaces, which he had built himself. For the mosque, he designed a rectangular ground plan measuring 113 m by 135 m, with a surface area of ​​more than 15,000 square metres (the prayer hall was designed for 16,000 people). The seventeen naves were decorated with horseshoe arches. The mosque, which was accessed through the current Puerta del Perdón, on the south façade, housed the extensive landscaped space today known as Patio de los Naranjos.\n\nIt was Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf who forced the use of the unfinished mosque in 1182 (above left), without the minaret being started, nor its immediate surroundings resolved. It was only in 1184 (above right) he decided to construct the minaret in the southeast corner. Upon his death it was his successor, Abū Yūsuf al-Mansūr (1160-1199), who ordered the building of the tower to continue, and it was completed in 1198 with the placement of four golden spheres on top (see below).\n\nIt is clear that the original prayer room, the patio and tower, were located on swampy land on which a group of houses, oratories, markets and gardens had been built outside the city walls. The Almohads had expropriated and demolished what was a sloping surface. The architect had to level the ground first to ensure the stability and regularity of the prayer hall. In part of the patio they also carved a dozen cisterns, as if extending the naves of the oratory to the north, which allowed them to have abundant water. It's also thought that the patio was left as earth, but without trees.\n\nThe great tower, whose square base is 13.61 meters on a side and today reaches a height of 94.70 meters, is the result of the superposition of two different constructions, but visually integrated thanks to the Cordoba architect Hernán Ruiz Jiménez. The first work, that of the Almohad, was a gigantic brick parallelepiped that appears to suggest solid foundations, but nothing could be further from the truth. The building starts from an ashlar plinth that is only 3.30 meters deep.\n\nAll is not what it seems, for example the black tiles used alongside the sculptural details throughout the belfry, were in fact some of 2,066 tiles purchased only in 1564. What's more, tiles on the exteriors of the Andalusian buildings from the Almohad period were never used. Otherwise, based upon written accounts of the period, we are sure that the appearance of the tower is almost identical to the original.\n\nRecently it has been discovered that the tower (the Giralda) was in fact painted red, but it is not clear when this was the case, and for how long it remained red (or when the colour disappeared).\n\nLife as a caliph could be quite challenging. The newly appointed Caliph Sulaymān ibn Abd al-Malik (ca. 675-717) once asked Mūsā ibn Nuṣayr (ca. 640-716), the commander of the victorious armies, about the Berbers. Mūsā replied, “They are the non-Arabs who most resemble the Arabs in their bravery, steadfastness, endurance and horsemanship, except that they are the most treacherous of people - they have no care for loyalty, nor for pacts\". By all accounts, Berbers, recruited during the long conquest of North Africa, had made up the overwhelming majority of the army that crossed the sea to Iberia. Subsequent decades brought waves of additional Arab settlers to Islamic Iberia, but Berbers remained an important demographic force in the Peninsula. Politically, however, they were out in the cold for long stretches of Andalusian history, and culturally their position was an ambiguous one. Indeed, in the literary sources of the time, Berbers were either members of the army, mercenaries, rebels, or semi-idolatrous ethnographic curiosities. Indeed, the very term 'Berber' is a problematic one, imposed upon a great diversity of peoples and languages ​​by hostile observers, i.e. an expression of contempt derived from the Latin barbarus (barbarian), and also associated with the verb barbara (to babble, speak nonsense) in Arabic.\n\nPerhaps an oversimplification, but it was said that Arabs lived in towns and Berbers in clans in remote or rural areas. This putative ethnic-territorial divide has sometimes been portrayed as a consequence of Arab chauvinism, driving the Berbers from political and economic centres, and from more fertile land. Arabs, and increasingly also the Hispano-Roman Muslim converts known as muwalladūn, dominated administrative posts and the cultural patronage associated with the Umayyad capital of Córdoba. But it is also possible that Berbers had compelling reasons to choose such lands, e.g. they were herders rather than farmers. Also living in remote places avoided centralised control, so they might have traded comfort for autonomy. Many of the regions most strongly associated with Berber settlement were frontier zones, where Córdoba’s reach was weak and where ambitious individuals and families could carve out autonomy or power for themselves.\n\nThe Berbers had fought the Byzantines from as early as the Battle of Mammes in 534, and appeared to have been in constant conflict with the Arabs from 647 through 703, so its not surprising that they revolted in 740-743. During the Umayyad conquest of Iberia, Berbers had formed their own military units based on tribal allegiances, with little contact with their Arab masters. With victory, Berbers were superficially Islamised, but in reality hung onto their traditions with varying degrees of religious assimilation to Islam. During the Taifa era, the petty kings came from a variety of ethnic groups, some of Berber origin. After the fall of the Caliphate in 1031, the taifa kingdoms of Toledo, Badajoz, Málaga and Granada had Berber rulers.\n\nStill today in Spain, mention of the year 711 causes intellectual convulsions that are echoed in popular debates whenever the subject is raised. In general everything relating to Al-Andalus is subject to controversy. Spanish Arabists and historians have split into two clearly divided camps, each with their respective followers periodically cheering them on. One group considers that the 'invasion' marked the start of a dark interregnum in peninsular history that only ended with the restoration of universal Catholicism in 1492. The other imagines that the period that began in 711 incorporated everything most advanced at the time, that is to say Islamic culture. Without doubt, 711 supposes a breach in peninsular history. Some are convinced that history itself was amputated at the time, while others contend that the arrival of Islam, with or without invasion and despite the inevitable conflict it engendered, gave rise to a Golden Age in the south of the peninsula (remembering that Al-Andalus actually referred to the entire peninsula, and not just todays Andalucía). Some writers focus on treachery and greed, others on romance, art and literature. I have no interest in getting involved in such a debate, but I would like to mention that some go to the extreme and highlight \"the Arab invasion nourished the Andalusians, above all, with a torrent of Arab and Berber blood\". Whereas a publication in 2001 found a striking result, that contemporary NW African and Iberian populations were found to have originated from distinctly different patrilineages and that the Strait of Gibraltar seems to have acted as a strong (although not complete) barrier to gene flow. In NW African populations, an Upper Palaeolithic colonisation probably had its origin in eastern Africa, whereas in comparison, about 78% of contemporary Iberian Y chromosomes originated in an Upper Palaeolithic expansion from western Asia, along the northern rim of the Mediterranean basin. A limited bidirectional gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar was detected. The genetic contribution of European Y chromosomes to the NW African gene pool is estimated at 4%, and NW African populations may have contributed 7% of Iberian Y chromosomes. The conclusion was that the Islamic rule of Spain, which began in A.D. 711 and lasted almost 8 centuries, left only a minor contribution to the current Iberian Y-chromosome pool.\n\nThe Reconquista\n\nThe Siege of Seville (1247-1248) lasted 16 months, and was both highly complex and a great success for Ferdinand III of Castile. He had already captured Córdoba in 1236 and Jaén in 1247, so the taking of Seville was a major step to dominating the Iberian Peninsula (Granada would finally fall in 1492).\n\nAttacking Sevilla was no easy problem, since the city had more than 6 km of walls. Ferdinand started by consolidating his logistics. Agreements had to be made with both James I of Aragon and the Nasridrulers of Granada. In 1246 he assembled an impressive army, it is said that such an army had never been seen in the Middle Ages. A naval force was created, and it has also been said that cannons were used (this is often said to be the earliest recorded use of gunpowder in the West). Pope Innocent IV issued a Papal Bull so that economic and military support could be provided by the French, Germans and Italians. The Pope also issued another Bull to ensure that the churches of Castile and Leon could apply a tax to cover the expenses of the war.\n\nIn fact it was the naval force that dealt the critical blow. In May 1248 it destroyed the pontoon bridge between Sevilla and Triana over which supplies were delivered to the city. The city capitulated due to famine in November 1248. Ferdinand III did not have a fixed capital but the court often lodged in Sevilla, and in 1252 he died and was buried in the Alcázar.\n\nThe story goes that in 1248 Femando III, after arduous negotiations, agreed that the Almohad's could leave the city with all their personal property. Houses, streets, squares, mosques, walls, the city itself, had to remain intact. The physical space of the city remained while its people undertook an exile without return. The king ordered that after the departure of the Almohads, the city should remain empty for three days. The king's troops waited impatiently to receive their reward and share a loot that was a whole city. We do not know the size of the Sevillian population at the time of the conquest. We don't know how many people were involved, but we do know that at the beginning of the 15th century the Sevillian population comprised about 50,000 inhabitants (Cologne, one of the most populated cities in Europe, only had 30,000 people during the same period). In any case, the Christian population that occupied Seville after the conquest was much smaller than the original Almohad population. Being that Seville was a border city with many resources, the Castilian kings favoured repopulation through emigration by donating properties and granting privileges. The initial beneficiaries were those knights, infantrymen and sailors who participated directly in the conquest. As might be expected, the Castilians made up the bulk of the immigrants, but other nationalities were also well represented in Seville, namely Italians, Catalans, Portuguese and French. Among the groups of foreigners, it was the Genoese that had the most influence and the one that left the most complete story of their time in the city.\n\nAfter the attacks of the Vikings, the Umayyad Emir had rebuilt the walls around the city, and despite them being destroyed and rebuilt several times, they were again reinforced in 1023 as a defence against Christian troops. After the Reconquista the same walls were kept, but the monarchs often took possession of the gates as symbols of their power. Still in 1836 the walls were practically intact, but after the 1868 revolution they began to tear them down. In the Almohad period the walls covered approximately 273 ha and more than 6 linear km. They were built almost exclusively with rammed earth, with the exception of some decorative brick courses in the towers and upper parts of the walls. The main wall was between 1.7 m and 1.8 m thick and an average height of 8 m. In addition there was a barbican 1.3 m thick and 5.0 m high, a ditch, and a moat.\n\nAbove we can see a model of a portion of the wall, and below a cross section of a still intact section of the wall with dimensions, etc. You can see where the cores were extracted to understand how the wall was built and how best to conserve and restore it.\n\nBetween the reigns of Alfonso X of Castile (1221-1284) and Pedro I (1334-1369) the court usually stayed in Sevilla. The Battle of Tarifa (1340) opened the Strait of Gibraltar to increased naval trade between southern and northern Europe. Sevilla became an increasingly important commercial hub, particularly for Italian and Flemish traders. However the city was hit hard by the Black Death (1348) and an earthquake in 1356.\n\nInterestingly the Black Death changed working practices for rural salaried worker. The charters of the 12th century and the first half of the 13th century defined the rights of the worker and the employer. A worker could quit a job without motive, but they were obliged to return the wages received until then and, even, to compensate the employer for possible losses. If dismissed by the employer, they only had to be paid for the work done. The employer established the quantity and quality of the work needed, and dismissal was at the employer's discretion. The duration of the working day was set for all workers, and generally indicated by the ringing of a bell. Normally the worker had to complete the work started before the bell rang. Regardless of whether the worker continued to work the next day or not, at the end of the day the employer had to pay for the work done. However, the situation changed as a result of the Black Death, and massive drop in population figures. Two changes were introduced. Firstly, the obligation to work, prohibiting a worker to remain idle. Workers were forced to go daily, at the crack of dawn, to the place where it was customary to hire workers. The authorities had to ensure that there were no workers wandering around and not working. Secondly, general rates were dictated for the entire kingdom, but each region was allowed to adjust the rate on a daily basis according to the price of meat.\n\nThese medieval regulations were later greatly diminished by the Crown, but they did renew the earlier laws mentioned above. However, in the agricultural labour market the insufficiency of the general legislation allowed the promulgation of municipal ordinances (ordenanzas) by local councils. Here the problem was that only a small number of families had access to local councils, and they were usually the largest farmers in the area. Whereas the tenants of land belonging to large landowners were usually absent. So the local oligarchies ruled the municipalities for their own benefit, both in terms of the rural labour market and access to communal lands. Most of the time priority was given to regulating the job offer and wage rates. Other aspects included the early termination of work, either by the worker or by the lord, where either could be punished if the cause was not just. The length of the day and breaks were also regulated, as was the issue of damage and theft of a harvest. In addition workers were not allowed to tie their animals near the grain sheaves, or carry sacks of grain \"with the master's license or without it\".\n\nWe know the regulation of wages for 1552 in Seville. The rate was established according to the tasks and the time of year in which they were carried out. Except in the case of vine pruners, wages were quoted on a monthly basis, depending on the number of days worked during the month (26 if the holidays were not worked and 30 if it was the full month). The highest wages were for the period between the end of May and the last days of June. Food was always included if the workers remained on the farm, although it is not specified what that meant. The salaries of workers related to cattle, shepherds, cowboys, pigs, etc., were established by month, season or year, and they also differed according to the season. Regulations varied, but all were concerned with wages and ensuring a regular supply of jobs, and in particular with the shortage of labour for sowing and harvesting. The penalties were very heavy, in 1,000's of maravedí for breaking the rules. For example no man over 16 years of age was allowed to pick olives during the sowing season (the work was reserved for children and women). If a farmer reaped the field of a neighbour they could be fined 2,000 maravedí. Any man not agreeing to the wages was fined 1,000 maravedí and 6 days in jail. Another rule was that workers could not be hired from a different village, and all farmers and reapers had to be present in the village centre to contract work. Everything seems to indicate that the ordinances were intended to smooth fluctuations in the supply and demand of labour from one agricultural season to another. In years of low demand for labour, farmers had to offer work to the local labour force, while in years when the demand was high, local workers were obliged to work in the village.\n\nEven in those medieval times in Baja Andalucía employment contracts signed before a notary were freely established between the parties, in particular for harvesting (but contracts could include seeding, olive harvesting, plowing, wheat harvesting, mowing, etc.). In part this was due to a shortage of labour supply at times of greatest demand, and explains the prohibition on worker to not go to work outside the municipality. In some cases wages were paid in instalments, or as an advance, or kept in part to the end of the work. All designed to create a dependency of the worker on the employer. This was explained by the fact that harvesting was an extraordinarily expensive task due to the high investment in labour and capital. In the case of cereal, the cost of just manpower could amount to a third of the total annual costs for an employer. This explains the diversity of formulas tested by farmers to carry out the harvesting of cereal or olives. The problem was that a fixed contract with a fixed salary was not the best way to ensure the needed productivity during harvest time. The piecework contract was fundamental since the employer could define the structure of the crew, the way in which the tasks were to be carried out, time limits, etc. The benefit for the workers was that they obtained employment contracts for several weeks with a guaranteeing income, despite the harsh conditions. What about migrant labour? It would appear that in some cases crews of outsiders developed a trusted relationship with an employer, and they would return knowing that they would be hired in the following years. In other cases the migrants were integrated into local crews. Migrants were often paid less that locals, in part because employers had greater confidence in local workers, and part because they had greater ability and dexterity in carrying out the tasks.\n\nIn 1767 there was a decree that established freedom of work, the result was that employment contracts disappeared from notarial protocols in the final decades of the 18th century, leaving parties to create their own agreements as needed. Interestingly an analysis of actual contracts showed that they were almost all offered by large tenant farmers, holders of municipal offices, members of local noble families and ecclesiastical institutions. More interestingly still, the workers were always part of a collective agreements, in which a handler (manijero or foreman) and a certain number of workers assumed responsibility and appeared as signatories of the agreement. Some contracts broke down the workers into reapers (sickle men) and riggers, and sometimes one or more trainees were included, generally paid half rates. Working conditions were often set in contracts for harvesting, etc. where quality and speed were essential. Words such as \"... no excuse, no delay\", and the work must continue \"hand over hand\" until it's completion, \"without raising a hand\". Usually the contracts included the rules on both the quality required and way to carry out the work, although some were left \"to the satisfaction\" of the farmer. Yet other contracts referred to the exact height at which the cut must be made and the proportion of stubble and sheaf that must be left. Other clauses referred to the way sheaves were to be tied in round bundles, tied with their tie and without interposing \"braid or brushwood\". And the focus on harvesting explains why there was a penalty of the early termination of the contract, if the work was not done to his satisfaction, the farmer could immediately employ new harvesters. In terms of pay, it was usually based upon a true price for a service, e.g. for piecework as in a payment based on the area to be harvested. Food was included and it was specified as to be a varied range of food. Mention was made of oil, vinegar, garlic and salt \"what is necessary\", a certain number of units of cheese, and meat, for example, in the form of one sheep or eventually in weight. Large farms also provided basins, pitchers, etc., whereas smaller farms might simply pay a \"dry\" salary, i.e. without food.\n\nThere are some very precise details concerning a farmhouse, property of the monastery Cartuja de Sevilla, which was located very close to the city of Seville. The accounts covered the period 1704 to 1740, and involved 350 hectares of rain-fed cereal (grown biennially), 100 hectares of olive groves and between 5 and 10 hectares of vineyards. The farmhouse work had a marked seasonality, the tasks being distributed very irregularly throughout the year, with very marked highs at certain times of the year, related to harvesting activities. During the forty to sixty days for harvesting, the average was 3.48 days work per hectare, while in the fallow months, from January to June, prior to the harvest, the average was 1.19 day per hectare, and slightly less at 0.90 days per hectare, in the months after the harvest, from August to December. For the olive harvest, the costs were 1,736 days on average per year, representing 80% of the total average annual cost of the olive grove. The highest wages were paid in the harvest period, 2 reales and 23 maravedí on average per day. During the rest of the year wages were 1 real and 10 maravedí before harvest, and 1 real and 19 maravedí after the harvest. The wages paid in the operation of the vineyard were 2 reales and 17 maravedí per day, whereas in the olive grove the average wage was 1 real and 18 maravedí per day.\n\nThe taking of Seville by the Christian troops of King Ferdinand III of Castile (1199-1252), in November 1248, caused a radical change in the metropolis of Seville. And for the mosque there was no exception, as it was adapted to be used in the Catholic liturgy. As such it remained until the second half of the 13th century, when the projects to demolish it began. The great Portuguese earthquake of 1356 considerably damaged the structure of the old Almohad mosque, but even so, no plans were presented to replace it. The custom of using the mosques of conquered cities as precincts for Christian worship still continued, but the tradition ceased to be used at the end of the 13th century. Finally, in 1401 the structure of the new Cathedral was designed. Sevillian tradition has it that the canons, when deciding the erection of the new cathedral, affirmed: \"Let us make a church so beautiful and so grand that those who see it carved consider us crazy\", and it was said that it had to be \"one such and so good that there is no other like it\".\n\nThe following year the works began. Alonso Martínez was, in all probability, the author of the original plans, dating from around 1386. Charles Gauter de Ruan (1378-1448) directed the works between 1439 and 1448. In the last stage after construction, towards the end of the 15th century, the post of master builder was taken by Alonso Rodríguez (d. 1513). The Gothic church turned out to be much larger and more majestic than had been originally planned, despite the fact that the builders made no significant changes to the original design. In principle, it was thought of demolishing the Giralda, a symbol of the Arab mosque, as indicated by the oldest known plan of the Cathedral, dated 1480. The idea was scrapped and, instead, it was decided to adapt the Giralda as a bell tower.\n\nIn 1391 there was an anti-Jewish revolt which started in Sevilla, and more than 4,000 Jews were massacred in the city. The foundations of the Spanish Inquisition had been laid. The Jewish community in Sevilla, one of the largest in Spain, disappeared almost overnight. The Spanish Inquisition started in Sevilla with six people being burned alive on 6 February 1481. All the remaining Jews were expelled from the city in 1483, but more than 2,000 Jewish converts to Christianity remained. In Granada on 30 March 1492, less than three months after the surrender of the Moors, the Catholic Kings put their signatures to an edict ordering the expulsion of all professed Jews from their kingdoms within the space of four months.\n\nBut this did not stop Sevilla growing in importance. Through 1400-1500 the city doubled in size, and became the largest city in Castile and Aragon. The city’s soap-producing industry, shipyards and Crown mint contributed between 15-20% of the all Castilian tributes. This was a time when a vigorous commercial community established itself in Seville, including within its ranks influential members of the Andalusian aristocracy who were attracted by the new prospects of mercantile wealth. By the 15th century the city had become an intensely active commercial centre with its thriving dockyards. It was a place where merchants from Spain and the Mediterranean lands would congregate to discuss new projects, form new associations and organise new ventures. It was Europe's observation post from which to survey North Africa and the broad expanses of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOnce Ferdinand III had captured both Seville and Córdoba, he knew he had to secure his position. So he decided to launch a military campaign into northern Africa. In order to do so, he required a fleet of ships. It was Alfonso X who decided to build the fleet in the Reales Atarazanas de Sevilla (Seville Shipyards).\n\nBuilt outside the city walls and close to the Guadalquivir, the shipyard covered about 15,000 square meters and consisted of 17 vaulted naves constructed entirely of brick, in a style now known as Mudéjar-Gothic, with vaulted ceilings and wide arches connecting the naves. Construction was similar to those found in a church or cathedral, e.g. the original mosque had 17 vaulted naves. Each nave needed to be large enough for the construction of a galley, with each section of the shipyard connected to the next via a series of arches. Experts have suggested that at the end of the 13th century it was the largest installation of its kind in Europe, although later l'Arsenale di Venezia would become substantially larger. The shipyards actually consisted of three main parts. Firstly the 17 naves perpendicular to the river designed to protect more than 35 combat galleys each about 40 meters long. Then there was the Atarazanas de los Caballeros, used as a store for weapons and supplies, and even as a prison. Thirdly, there was the so-called Resolana del Río, a portion of the river beach where most of the construction work was carried out in the open air (as was customary in riverbank shipyards). In total, the whole area covered about​ 62,000 square meters.\n\nBefore the end of 1253 ten galleys had been built in the shipyard, and it continued to produce fleets for subsequent Castilian kings. Between the mid-13th century and the mid-14th century, the galleys built in Seville fought to keep open the Strait of Gibraltar, for example in the Battle of the Strait (1274-1335). Galleys built in the shipyards were used throughout much of the remainder of the Reconquista, as well as during the Hundred Years' War against England. By the mid-15th century and the final stages of the Reconquista, orders for new ships began to decline and the ships began to be repurposed for other tasks. The reality was that galleys were not able to make transoceanic voyages, which constituted the new area of ​​expansion for Castile.\n\nIn 1493, a fish market was moved into the first nave. During the 16th century, other naves were reassigned as oil and wool warehouses, and three naves became the city’s customs warehouse. Finally the shipyard was too small for building larger, more modern ships, and soon it closed. In 1641, five naves were transformed into the Hospital de la Caridad. In 1719, five more naves were assigned for the storage of artillery material. The rest were largely used as commercial warehouses.\n\nThe next big change to the structure of the shipyard came in 1945 when five naves were destroyed to make way for the construction of a tax office building. Fortunately, no further destruction took place before the shipyard gained National Monument status in 1969, protecting it from further damage. However, for more than 20 years it has been off-limits to the public, despite various plans and proposals for its renovation, all of which have so far failed, generating much frustration. But the shipyards were used in season 7 of Game of Thrones, and it is now hoped that they will be open to the public in 2022.\n\nTo send a fleet of galleys to fight against the enemy, whether Muslim or Christian, needed three things to happen. Firstly, the shipyard needed to build, repair and keep the galleys safe. Secondly, they needed men, weapons and supplies. And, finally, they needed an Admiral to lead them into combat. In Spain, all three were under royal authority. Seville was a royal city, and within it, the great arsenal of the Guadalquivir galleys was made up of a set of buildings owned by the Crown and therefore under the supervision of a delegated authority of the monarch, and chosen directly by him. Through the 13th and 14th centuries virtually nothing is known about those who ran the shipyard. But we are sure of one thing. Until 1340, Muslim armies threatened Seville several times, and Sevillians protected themselves behind the city walls. However the shipyards were outside the city walls, and its defence was the responsibly of the shipyard warden. The warden also had exclusive jurisdiction over the shipyard prison, which it would appear was often used as gentlemen's quarters. Although it is said that the bones of a Florentine merchant, Jerónimo Rufalde, were found there in 1489, and he stilled owed 60,000 maravedís to the king. Whilst we don't know the name of the earlier wardens, we do know that they were considered \"tyrants\" by those who were obliged to supple coal and wood to the shipyard.\n\nRamón de Bonifaz (1196-1256), was probably the first Admiral of Castile, and there are suggestions that admirals had to controlled the work of the shipyards from the point of view of combat needs, i.e. to ensure that the galleys were ready at the beginning of each campaign. Generally admirals were of noble families, men of great prestige, who were also accorded many privileges and awarded lands and vassels. Whereas the warden of the shipyard was what has been called \"service nobility\", knights or members of the lower urban nobility, i.e. belonging to noble lineages that did not have power based upon strong family support and great resources in lands or vassals, but on personal services rendered to the monarch. Juan Mathe de Luna (1230-1299) and Fernán Pérez Maimón were both admirals in the late-13th century, and as admirals they had to raise funds for the fleets, pay the Castilian and Genoese crews contracted to fight in the Straits, plan the number of galleys they needed and, finally, act as commanders and take them to combat. At that time, not even a single name of the arsenal wardens has survived, whereas later we do know that powerful ministers also took responsibility for the shipyards. Later still, and throughout the 15th century, the institution of the admiralty ended up becoming a patrimonial right of the Enríquez family. Some of them had never seen a boat, and who, as courtiers with royal blood in their veins would never have been interested in staining their boots in the mud of a shipyard.\n\nAdmirals were at the top of the food chain, for example, in 1374 Fernán Sánchez de Tovar (d. 1384) had under his orders captains, committees, pilots (\"naucheles\" were said then), shipmasters, and in general all the men who navigated the seas and rivers, including fishermen, boatmen and, of course, sailors, whether they were in royal navies, commercial fleets or on vessels owned by private individuals. However, there were disputes of responsibility between admirals and shipyard wardens, namely concerning the right to monitor and repress the traffic of merchandise whose exportation was prohibited, or, as it was said at the time, to be \"the guardian of the removal of forbidden things\". It was, basically, to prevent products considered of high strategic value from leaving the kingdom, endangering its economy or its defence. It was a delicate matter with frequent and serious international implications, since more than once the peace or war between Castile and Granada depended on the Christians allowing the export of bread and cattle to the Nasrid kingdom. Furthermore, its control gave access to lucrative benefits through confiscations, some legal and others outside the law, but which the smugglers would not be in a position to report. The admirals, due to having under their supervision the docking, loading and unloading activities of the port traffic were used to be in charge of monitoring these illegal exports by sea, but in this work they had powerful competitors. Other authorities did not miss the opportunity to get hold of a part of that rich cake, either taking advantage of times of political turbulence or simply exploiting the weakness of a particular admiral who neglected his privileges. For example, a shipyard warden might be asked to prohibit the departure of wheat, cattle, horses and precious metals from the kingdom, yet also be asked to procure the needed naval construction materials. So plenty of opportunities to turn a quick profit on the side.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century and throughout the 16th century, Seville's shipyards began to cease being the great military shipyard of the kingdom and became a series of warehouses, very useful, but certainly not so decisive for the fate of the Crown. At the same time admirals gradually lost powers to, for example, new institutions such as the Casa de Contratación, and by the middle of the 16th century the admiralty was left to simply collect taxes.\n\nThe third person, in addition to the admiral and shipyard warden, was the so-called \"shipowner\" of the royal fleet (\"el armador\"). It is said that a certain Juan Martínez, was the first to take on this role in June 1384. He received money to assemble three galleys, i.e. prepare the galleys and take care of their weapons and ammunition and the provision of sailors for them. Previously this function was also performed by the shipyard warden, who still had to construct, repair and ensure the safety of the boats. It has been suggested that the \"shipowner\" was subordinate to the admiral, which appears sensible since selecting galley slaves and crossbowmen was a task of special importance for an admiral if they wanted to win battles. It seems logical to think that a good admiral would pay attention to the armaments of the galleys and would monitor the levies, weapons and food shipped, on whose quantity and quality the success or failure of the expedition could depend. Again logically, the \"shipowner\" appeared to be a collaborator of the admiral, taking charge of the administrative tasks. Later in the 15th century, there were no more references to this post of shipowner of the royal fleets, so it appears to have become a subordinate office in the admiralty (probably occupied by another member of the urban nobility).\n\nIt may surprise the reader that the last large-scale battle fought between rowed warships was the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, in which Spain participated on the side of the victorious Holy League. As one writer put it, this was not a \"land battle at sea\" and the victory of the Holy Alliance was not the simple result of brainless determination and religious fanaticism, but rather the product of intelligent tactics. It was a well fought tactical victory over a well trained and well prepared adversary. Just over half of the galleys in the combined Christian fleet which fought at Lepanto were Venetian, some 108 out of 206 or roughly 52%. Spain and her Viceroyalties of Naples and Sicily contributed 49 galleys, about 24%. Genoa, Savoy, and the Papal contingent contributed the rest. The Ottoman opponents had 222 galleys and 56 galliots.\n\nAbove we have a description of the Spanish war galley Lanterna, a flagship from ca. 1571. This was an over-sized galley, some 55 m long, with 200+ oarsmen, and transporting 200 soldiers. The key features of such a war galley was its speed and armament, and the reason why galleys had a very long shelf life was because they could move independent of the wind. War galleys were still successfully used by the Russians in the Battle of Gangue in 1714. Indeed, the last battle fought where galleys were brought out was at the Siege of Copenhagen (1807) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWith its complement of long-bore, forward-facing guns known as sakers, the lantern-type galley was often the most powerful ship on the water. A fleet of lantern galleys was fearsome, but only nations with a strong degree of centralised power could afford to employ professional rower corps (and impress when rowers became costly). Lantern galleys had powerful guns and could outstrip war cogs, but they had one enemy. That enemy was the fire ship, and so a fleet of war galleys had to have barque-type vessels on the flanks to protect them. Carracks, while outranged by a lantern galley's firepower, had the benefit of enhanced armour as well as more accurate multiple guns, thus making the odds between carracks and lantern galleys somewhat more evenly matched. For more information check out Renaissance War Galleys (1470-1590).\n\nThe reality was that it would have been difficult for the modern, untrained eye to distinguish at a distance between an ordinary galley of Spain, Malta, Venice, or their Muslim opponents without reference to flags, pennants, or other heraldic devices. All had hulls about 40 m long by about 5 m wide, topped by an outrigger assembly, the rowing frame, which spanned some 8 m. All carried a main centre-line bow gun on a forward firing mount which ran back between the foremost oarsmen's benches on recoil. There was typically a full battery of cannon, weighing from 1.7 to 3.2 tons exclusive of the mount, and firing a 20 kg cast-iron cannonball. This cannon was invariably flanked by a pair of smaller guns (they had to be considerably smaller since there was much less room for them to recoil). These generally weighed from 0.7 to 1.4 tons and fired projectiles weighing about 5-6 kg. They were flanked, in turn, by a second pair of cannons which were smaller still, typically firing a ball of about 3 kg, and weighing from as little as 300 kg to as much as 700 kg. The Ottoman Turks had cannon of about the same overall weight, designed to fire a cannonball of cut stone weighing about twice as much as its cast-iron equivalent. Standardisation was almost non existent, so Spanish cannon, on the whole, were longer and heavier than the norm, and Venetian guns were shorter. The cannon constituted the war galley's main battery, and all were fixed to fire forward and could be trained only by turning the ship. They were supplemented by a number of small swivel guns, mostly mounted in the bow, though some were also mounted at the stern and along the sides of the ship.\n\nIn the Battle of Lepanto, Venice wanted a short war and a quick peace, but the reality was that Mediterranean commerce meant little to Spain. Spain's vital trade with America was well out of the line of fire and Spanish commanders in the Mediterranean saw themselves as soldiers in an unending holy war with the Turks, a view shared by the Pope. The pressures on Spain were therefore more narrowly fiscal and military than those on Venice. As long as they kept the Turks at bay in the Eastern Mediterranean, far from their North African and Spanish Morisco allies, it justified the expense. However, as wages spiralled Spain were forced progressively to abandon free, salaried oarsmen in favour of cheaper slaves and convicts. The attendant loss in combat effectiveness and propulsive efficiency was in part counteracted by embarking increasing numbers of Spanish regular infantry.\n\nSpain's normal posture in the Mediterranean was basically defensive. Her Muslim enemies attacked her port cities and raided her coasts, and Spain reacted. The great expense of keeping a well-armed galley constantly in readiness during the campaigning season from late March through mid-October to combat the elusive and unpredictable Muslim raiders acted to keep the Spanish standing fleet small. The lack of numbers was balanced by a galley for galley superiority in raw combat power. The galleys of Spain carried more and better specialised fighting men than any others. The weight of men made Spanish galleys harder to row, a problem exacerbated by the fact that Spanish cannon were generally longer and heavier than the equivalent of the Venetians or Ottomans. In addition the galleys of Spain and Italy had acquired, by 1571, a permanent raised structure above the bow, the \"rumbada\". This served as a platform from which fire could be directed to cover the assault of infantry onto the low-lying deck of an enemy galley. It was highly effective tactically. But it also added weight, and adding weight was the antithesis of speed under oars, speed which had to be developed at all costs in the crunch of battle. The Spanish accepted these deficiencies and played to their strong suit. By packing the rowing benches with slaves and convicts, Spanish galleys at Lepanto could use 200 oarsmen on 24 banks of oars. Acceleration and dash speed were maintained, but the cost was in sustained rowing speed. At the end of the day the Venetian galley was a combat assault craft, whereas the Spanish galley was more like a transporter for Spanish infantry. For more information on the war galleys used at Lepanto check out this article.\n\nIn addition to the war galleys, the Iberian Peninsula saw the evolution of at least four different types of ship, dependent upon the coastal regions (e.g. different in the Bay of Biscay and on the Algarve and Andalusian coast) and equally dependent upon visitors and invaders who had established colonies and factories along the Iberian coastlines (e.g. Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Goths, and Arabs each left their mark). In 1915 a Portuguese admiral listed 167 different types of ships and boats mentioned in historical documents for Portugal alone (ranging from plank canoes to medieval cogs). It's generally accepted that northern Europe and the Mediterranean were two different worlds in terms of ship design. Late-medieval maritime trade in the Mediterranean was carried in both galleys and so-called round ships, which were frame-based, lateen-rigged, carrying one, two, or three masts. In contrast, the workhorses of the Baltic and North Atlantic trade were square-rigged, clinker-built vessels, sometimes referred to as keels, probably descending directly from the 11th-century short-sea traders.\n\nFrom the 11th century onwards, as cities grew and the trade between them intensified, clinker-built boats grew in size and became the hulks depicted on town seals and in historical sources. Hulks were partially replaced, in the early-15th century, by another type of trading craft, the cog. Cogs emerged sometime during the early-12th century and differed from hulks in that they were constructed from sawn planks, with a flat, flush-laid bottom and central rudder. Only the upper sides of the cog were lapstrake (i.e. clinker built). Also rigged with square sails, cogs may have influenced the development of a new type of vessel in the Mediterranean, commonly referred to as coccas. This design may be the direct ancestor of the Italian carracks (the Spanish nao). These had many characteristics of Mediterranean design, including integrated fore- or aft-castles and flush-laid planks nailed to a pre-existing frame structure, but unlike other Mediterranean designs, they mounted a square sail like their northern relatives.\n\nAround this time, at the beginning of the 14th century, the most common Mediterranean design was a two-masted round ship. This type was used continually from at least the 11th to the 20th centuries. During the 14th century, these ships appeared with a square sail on the foremast, and evolved into a full-rigged ship with the addition of a third mast before the foremast (starting in 1409). Three-masted vessels were adopted very quickly both in the Mediterranean and along the north-European coasts. Most European nations, including Portugal and Spain, adopted the three-masted ship, built on a framed-first design, during the 15th century.\n\nRegarding the design of larger oceangoing ships, they were conceived, designed, and built during the period after firearms helped consolidate state power and the geopolitical boundaries of the modern state. The monarchs that ordered these ships may have entertained a loose sense of their country’s geographical boundaries, but they quickly developed strict control of the monopolies of taxation and justice within a still-medieval world. Sudden access to distant resources generated by the changing geopolitical context triggered a number of shifts in public policy, technological advancement, and economics, including shipbuilding. Fifteenth-century ships were a product of the state’s will, not the private sector. At this time, states had the political capacity to enforce rules and the economic capacity to plan and launch war on a scale unmatched during the previous Middle Ages. During the late-16th century, the Iberian Peninsula was a cosmopolitan region harbouring the bureaucracies that ruled over two extensive empires, and it attracted foreign scholars, merchants, and intellectuals to its major cities. Based on naval power, both the Spanish and the Portuguese empires required a steady stream of larger and better ships, and historical information for this period, both documents and iconography, reveals that all Iberian oceangoing ships were conceived in a similar way, regardless of region, city, or shipyard. Following the Mediterranean shipbuilding tradition, ships were built empirically, based on proportion and scale, and did not require plans or drawings. Built in a carvel style with flush-laid planks fastened to the frames, Iberian oceangoing ships followed a construction tradition thought to date back to the time of oared vessels in the Mediterranean. Even the earliest of the hulls used a number of frames with predesigned curvatures. These frames were mounted over the keel prior to planning and thus defining the shape of the hull. But the reality was that despite certain regional differences in units of measurement (and other details), the overall style and basic design was the same everywhere. Most small or medium-sized oceangoing ships will have looked similar to the nonprofessional eye. In Spain there were three main types of sailing ships, the nao (carrack), galleon, and caravel.\n\nThe Spanish nao was a ship with two, three or four decks and fully integrated fore- and aft-castles, bearing three masts and a bowsprit, all rigged with square sails, except the mizzenmast (the aftmast). The mizzenmast, intended for steering, was rigged with a lateen sail. The three-mast, full-rigged ship first appeared in a Catalan drawing dating to 1409. The length-to-breadth ratio of the vessel in the Catalan drawing appears to have been around 3:1, a common ratio for Mediterranean round ships. The nao Victoria (see replica above) was the first ship to circumnavigate the world (1519-1522). It was the only ship of five to complete the voyage, and Magellan was killed in the Philippines. It was only around 18-21 m long, weighed 85 tons and carried 55 crew (only 18 returned alive).\n\nGalleons are mentioned in the first decade of the 16th century and primarily functioned as warships with two or three decks, fully integrated fore- and aft-castles, three or four masts, and a bowsprit. The fore and main masts were rigged with square sails, and the mizzen (aftmast) and bonaventure (forth mast) were rigged with lateen sails. The length-to-beam ratio appears to have been around 3.5:1. Galleons were much sturdier vessels with thicker masts, and the square stern allowed more deck space during military operations, specifically for the movement of stern guns. For example, the galleon San Martín was built as a Portuguese galleon, but became the flag-ship of the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armada. She was finished 1580 and was 55 m long, 12 m in the beam, and carried 48 heavy guns.\n\nCaravels were originally lateen-rigged ships with one or two masts. Generally thought to have developed in the Mediterranean during the 12th century, in the 13th century caravels were mainly employed for fishing in Portugal. They reappeared in the beginning of the 15th century as the preferred “Ships of Discovery”, sometimes bearing painted eyes on both sides of the bow, a trait paralleled in the Mediterranean since ancient times. No doubt, this preference reflected the vessel’s swiftness and manoeuvrability. Towards the end of the 15th century, there are references to three-mast caravels, and the 16th century witnessed the development of the caravela de armada (see above) with four masts and rigged on all masts with lateen sails, except the foremast, which bore square sails. Caravels were still in use in the 17th century, and they continue to be mentioned in the 18th century.\n\nAll vessels of the time were armed and travelled in fleets for added protection. A number of smaller vessels, such as patachos and zabras sailed regularly with the fleets, as supporting craft, and may have been conceived and built in the same way as the larger ships.\n\nThe late 14th and the 15th centuries were also a time of bitter conflict between Catalonia and Genoa for the control of the spice, cloth, and corn trades. This was a conflict in which the mastery of the entire trading system of southern Europe was at stake. While the war in the Mediterranean was waged indecisively throughout the 15th century, the Genoese won an early and lasting victory in another vital region. This was central and southern Spain, where the expansion of the Castilian market offered the successful contender an exceptionally rich prize. The growth of Castile's wool trade had created new commercial opportunities, which the Catalans, embattled on so many fronts, were in no position to seize. It was, instead, the Genoese who settled in Córdoba, Cádiz, and Seville, built up a solid alliance with Castile, and secured control of the wool exports from Spain's southern ports. Once they had obtained this foothold, the Genoese were well placed to entrench themselves at one strategic point after another in the Castilian economy, and so prepare the way for their future participation in the lucrative trade between Seville and Castile's colonial empire. This Genoese predominance decisively influenced the course of 16th-century Spanish development.\n\nIn a different doc"
