        "text": "By considering the building regulations of medieval Christian societies of the Iberian Peninsula with the ones contained in Islamic sources from al-Andalus, it is possible to verify how much the former were influenced by the latter. This legacy is, indeed, evident in the official responsible for applying these rules, whose purpose was to control various urban areas. In fact, the Portuguese almotacé, the Castilian almotacén or the Aragonese mustaçaf derive from the Islamic muḥtasib, which in turn has an ancient and complex history, as an authentic product of the Mediterranean. The transformation in medieval Christian building rules and their transmission to non-European territories, which have been in force for much longer, truly certify the evolution of an Islamic institution as a transtemporal and transcultural phenomenon.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis work is to investigate the cultural legacy of the al-Andalus period and its reception in contemporary Spain. To fulfill the research objective set, it was necessary to answer the following questions: How important is this period in the history of Spain? How much of its influence can be noticed today? How much historical and cultural knowledge do the Spanish have on this subject? The answers to these questions result from the analysis of an extensive source database and the realization of a series of semi-structured interviews with Spaniards, which were necessary to understand and develop the subject. The work is divided into three sections: the first describes the history of al-Andalus and some additional aspects of interest, such as the etymology and the idea of the myth of al-Andalus. In the next section, the topic of the Muslim legacy remained on the Iberian Peninsula is developed. It describes cities important during the Muslim rule, their architecture and well-known monuments, as well as visible influence in the following areas: language, music, literature and cuisine. The last part focuses more on practical aspects: it is based on interviews with Spaniards and it analyzes their attitude towards all the issues raised in the theoretical parts. The greatest number of conclusions can be derived from the research described in empirical chapter. According to the collected information, the Arab legacy in Spain is extensive and rooted in Spanish culture for so long that without its presence, Spain, as we know today, would not be the same. It may seem that more than 800 years (8th – 15th) of developing the Arab culture in Spain has still been very much alive, because this cultural legacy continues to be extremely impactful in areas such as: tourism, economy and social coexistence of different groups (convivencia).\n\nAs part of my undergraduate degree at the University of Malta I was required to write a dissertation. Being passionate about the medieval period and crusading I wanted to work on these principles. My Supervisor, Mr Charles Dalli, suggested working on a comparative study of two major cities/regions in the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista and, thus, ‘The Two Kingdoms of the Reconquista’ was born in the summer of 2021. After extensive secondary research of works by authors, such as, R. Burns and J. Hillgarth, Valencia and Granada were chosen as candidates. Granada was the perfect candidate for this kind of study, for, among other reasons, that it was the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia. This fact gave a perfect starting point for the cultural shift from Islamic to Christian culture to take place in a relatively short period of time (1238-1492). However, why choose Valencia over other regions, such as Toledo, Seville and Cordoba? The crusade against Valencia had the largest effect on the future expansion of the Aragonese Empire, and after its capture, the Christianisation process took time to take hold over the Islamic presence there, both in the regional and urban contexts. Therefore, Valencia was the perfect candidate to undertake a comparative study against Granada, which went through the process much faster and affected the future expansion of Castile-León. Therefore, the dissertation covered these points, noting how certain treaties and alliances affected the way the Christian Kingdoms dealt with the Islamic Taifas after their capture, how they affected the rate at which the Christianisation process unfolded and how this Christianisation process can be seen through the archaeological record today. It is through these factors that the eventual cultural shift can be seen and how two regions, which are relatively close together, evolved so differently from each other."
