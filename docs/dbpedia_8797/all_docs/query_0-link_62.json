Debbie Cordova and others allowed me the time to get this done, although their work, like that of the go-between, remains on the margins and yet holds the whole courtly world together. I would also like to thank the students who participated and contributed to the graduate seminars in which key portions of this study were developed—including on more than one occasion, Tiffany Shinbach. Clinton Armstrong’s help with medieval Latin and discussions on Classical culture and literature as well as Church traditions led to unexpected discoveries in the later stages of the study’s development. I would also like to acknowledge the support of the Dean of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine, for time off in the form of a sabbatical and a Faculty Career Development Award. I also received funding for this project from the Humanities Center at UCI. I would also like to acknowledge the National Endowment of the Humanities, who sponsored a Summer Seminar on the Libro de buen amor in 2003, during which important parts of this work were conceived. Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this book do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Thanks also to the University of California Humanities Research Institute for support in the form of a Residential Fellowship.

The go-between narrative of courtly seduction proved particularly appealing in medieval Iberia, where complex cultural, linguistic, and religious boundaries and constructions were in constant transformation, as historical and social events during the eleventh through the fourteenth centuries brought about a succession of significant changes in political power. The go-between was especially apt at moments of such change as she was the definition of instability itself. Like the exiled courtiers of Iberia, the go-between was always in motion, in a constant process of transformation, and as such she was the perfect vehicle for representing and redefining the changing boundaries of Iberian identity. The go-between’s activities in the in-between space of Iberian fiction (between lover and beloved and between Andalusi past and future) become the subject of Iberian narratives of courtly desire.2 In Representing Others I examine how not only the go-between, but also the narratives within which she moves, represent and are representative of Iberian others. The figure and her narratives underscore the nature of the other as an inhabitant of the in-between, exposing the indeterminacy of the medial, the hybrid, as a source of anxiety. The Iberian go-between and her tales not only embody and portray religious, ethnic, and linguistic others, but, from the vantage point of the contemporary Western literary/cultural critic, they are themselves intermediary others—being products of that “other” time (the Middle Ages, that medial space between the ancient and modern: the temporal other of the modern period into which contemporary thinkers, politicians, and pundits are fond of placing all that is evil, dark, and barbarous), that “other” space (the Iberian Peninsula, geographical\n\nI\n\n2\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nbridge between Europe and Africa and not clearly belonging to either) as well as those “other” peoples (medieval Iberians who inhabited the inbetween spaces in which different social, linguistic, ethnic, and cultural groups intermingle).3 In order to explore the “in-between” spaces of medieval Iberian literature, we must first reorient ourselves. This book requires us to reconsider what/who has become the Other in a post-Said, post-9/11 world—the Arab—as the center, the point of reference according to which the authors of these narratives define themselves and others. In the Iberian go-between tales that I examine in Representing Others, the Arab-Andalusi is the center, the ideal but often conflicted home that these displaced Iberian authors recreate in their fiction. My analysis in Representing Others is informed by Homi Bhabha’s concepts of hybridity and difference and Edward Said’s theories on exile and narrative and explores how the former complement Jaques Lacan, Felix Guattari, and Gilles Deleuze’s theories on desire and Mary Russo’s reading of the female grotesque. Such a selection of contemporary postcolonial and psychoanalytic theorists is particularly suited to analysis of medieval Iberian culture, which for so long has been left out not only out of discussions of Empire that privilege the modern, but also out of much of North American and European Medieval Studies, whose cultural and discursive models (constructed by eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century medievalists for the study of English and French medieval history and cultural production) are ill-suited to medieval Iberia. Spain is different, and medieval Iberia, too, is different in important ways from much of medieval Western Europe. Far from arguing that medieval Iberia is a postcolonial space avant la lettre, the complex social, cultural, and linguistic exchange and conflict that characterizes various groups on the Peninsula between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries can be productively analyzed using contemporary theories on exile, culture, and desire, with the caveat that such theories must be decentered, that is, extricated from the specificity of the modern (post)colonial situation. It is in eleventh-century Cordoba that the go-between emerges in Andalusi courtly discourse as a uniquely Iberian subject. Ibn Hazm, an exile from the last of the Umayyad caliphal courts that some hundred years earlier had been described as the “ornament of the world,” includes the old women he remembers from his youth roaming the streets of Cordoba as the ideal go-betweens of the courtly world.4 In a succession of Iberian gobetween tales these old women will repeatedly be evoked and transformed in the memories of Iberian exiles as the catalyst for and means of accessing the refined world of the lost Andalusi court. This court of memory is also perpetuated in Arabic and Hebrew erotic poetry composed by and lovingly\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nmemorized, recited, and elevated to the status of cultural icon by Andalusi exiles forced from the geographical, historical, and cultural spaces where such poetry and the go-betweens who trafficked in it had functioned. The Iberian authors whose go-between narratives I examine in the following pages, Muhammad al-Saraqusti, Judah al-Harizi, Judah ibn Shabbetai, and Juan Ruiz, are cosmopolitan intellectuals who share an Andalusi formation/ training, and who find themselves displaced from the courts, the centers of power and culture. These authors use the Andalusi go-between narrative to reinvent themselves in exile. For them the Other is what today we would describe as European; namely the Ashkenazi and Franco-Christian cultures from north of the Pyrenees. These go-between narratives offer us alternative constructions of what it means to be Western at a time when chroniclers across the Pyrenees such as Petrus Tudebodus and Raymond d’Aguilers were beginning to construct the Orient as Other.5 In his seminal work on the origins of the West’s construction of the Orient, Orientalism, Said conveniently remains silent on the topic of medieval Iberia—this space that is both “West” and “Orient.” He jumps from the eleventh-century French Chanson de Roland to fifteenth-century papal activity to argue that the seeds of Orientalism lie in the European Middle Ages, failing to address the complexity of medieval Iberian culture and society, in which hybrid cultural identities dominate and no facile statements about East and West, Arab and Christian can hold.6 The centuries during which the go-between tales I examine were produced, the eleventh through the fourteenth, and the very centuries Said elides, are witness to a variety of social and political changes on the Iberian Peninsula (as discussed in detail in the chapters that follow) that result in a shift from an Islamic dominated Arabic-speaking culture to a Christian one whose dominant languages became the Romance dialects of the Peninsula. Despite the dramatic advancements and reversals that unequivocally alter Iberian culture and produce a fourteenth-century Christian Castilian culture that would have been in many ways unrecognizable and incomprehensible to the Peninsula’s eleventh-century inhabitants, the go-between narrative continues to be used by learned Iberians to address issues of identity. The continued use and transformation of the go-between narrative in Iberian letters, although not teleological (there is no development from a primitive to a more developed narrative), is testimony to the tale’s ability to interrogate the relationship between power and desire. By contextualizing the go-between narrative within specific moments of Iberian history and by showing how different the social, political, and cultural contingencies were in each case, Representing Others problematizes modern readings of medieval Iberia and al-Andalus as a flat, unchanging site of harmonious coexistence between the three religious groups of the Peninsula, Muslims,\n\n4\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nChristians, and Jews, pointing instead to a more nuanced approach to specific moments and cultures of the eleventh-, twelfth-, thirteenth-, and fourteenthcentury Iberian Peninsula. Al-Andalus and Its Courts The arrival of the Muslims in the eighth century, most of whom were, at least initially, ethnically Berber, further increased the complexity of the religious, linguistic, and cultural landscape of the Iberian Peninsula, which had, since the time of the Phoenicians, been a geographical site of contact for a variety of cultures, including Greek, Celtic, Basque, Phoenician, Roman, and Germanic.7 The term al-Andalus was originally used by medieval Arab historians to designate the Iberian Peninsula under the Goths/Vandals and is generally used by contemporary scholars to designate “that part of the Iberian Peninsula in Muslim hands.”8 Al-Andalus looms large in contemporary approaches to Iberian history and culture that tend to focus either on the harmonious coexistence or the conflictive nature of relations between the three major religious groups—Muslim, Christian, and Jew— on the Iberian Peninsula before the Reconquest, the military advance of Hispano-Roman Christians south into Andalusi territories that took place over a period of several hundred years from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries. Such approaches often oversimplify a complex situation marked by periods of both cultural exchange and bitter, sometimes deadly intolerance.9 The use of the term al-Andalus among contemporary scholars creates an artificial break between Muslim al-Andalus and medieval Iberia, implying not only religious and cultural difference, but also historical and geographical displacement and incongruity. But al-Andalus is Iberia and Andalusis are Iberians. Modern constructions of al-Andalus and medieval Spain stress rupture and marginality, be it religious (al-Andalus is Muslim, Spain is Christian), linguistic (al-Andalus is Arabic-speaking, Spain is Romance-speaking), or cultural (al-Andalus is Other, Spain is European).10 This study, however, problematizes not only the modern constructions or classifications of medieval Iberians, but also examines how medieval Iberians themselves were wrangling with the complexity of self-definition across, and sometimes against, their own internal linguistic, sociocultural and religious definitions and models of identity. Although there were, undoubtedly, ideological differences among Muslims, Christians, and Jews in medieval Iberia, there were sometimes equally strong linguistic, philosophic, and cultural differences between factions within these groups as well. Cultural and social division present in the Baghdadi courts of the Umayyad and ‘Abbasid Empires (divisions between Syrian, Yemenite, and the Baghdadi Arabs, between Persians, Arabs, and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nJews, and between factions of Muslim religious-philosophical sects) made its way to the Iberian Peninsula, where it complicated existing ethnic and cultural divisions such as those between rival groups of North African Berbers, muwalladun (Muslim Iberians of Hispano-Roman families that converted), more recently arrived Eastern Arabs, Muslims of Slavic origin, Frankish and Basque captives from the northern Peninsula and northern Europe, and Hispano-Roman and Arabized Jews.11 In this book I use the term al-Andalus not just as a religio-political term used to distinguish Muslim from Christian Iberia or as a geographical term to identify a specific area of the Iberian Peninsula. I use the term to designate the complex geographical, socioreligious, cultural space in which Iberian intellectuals were formed and in turn within which they helped to create a cosmopolitan identity that cuts across many of the linguistic, religious, and ethnic boundaries that characterized medieval Iberian society. Though parts of the geographical or political al-Andalus fell into Christian hands during some four hundred years of conquest, it continued to live on as an imaginary ideal for several centuries among Andalusi exiles.12 Andalusi court culture is defined by a system of values and behaviors ideally enacted between the lover and the beloved. Literature plays a central role in the production of meaning within the Andalusi courts and within Andalusi models of courtly desire, which generated much of that court culture. Poetry is the most important of courtly discourses and the one used to channel desire and codify power in the courtly setting. According to this code, the courtier, like the sovereign, is represented as an ideal lover of refined literary and sentimental tastes.13 This courtly model of the ideal individual, designated variously as katib, zarif, nadim, or adib, is essentially a secular, cosmopolitan one based on the concept of adab, the Arab concept of social, cultural, and academic wisdom.14 The ideal courtier is not just well read in a variety of subjects, including poetry, philosophy, the natural sciences, and theology, he is a poet, a man of impeccable manners, a social wit, and a refined lover. He should also be an expert of rhetoric, possessor of excellent penmanship, knowledgeable in the art of hunting, gambling, and chess, as well as stylish and well groomed.15 The ambassador of this code of courtly knowledge and behavior, the Persian poet Ziryab, who came to al-Andalus from the ‘Abbasid court of Baghdad in 941 A.D., became the favorite of the Umayyad caliph ‘Abd al-Rahman II (822–852) because of the former’s mastery of the latest poetic trends in Baghdad. Just as Ziryab’s skill at composing poetry gained him entrée into the Andalusi court, several generations of Andalusi courtiers would also include among their ranks the best of Andalusi poets, including Ibn Zaidun, Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi, Ibn Darraj, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Shuhaid.16\n\n6\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nAn excellent knowledge of Arabic language and poetry was the foundation upon which most of the other aspects of the refined courtly character was built and served as the social glue for the Andalusi court. It was a lingua franca for the individual courtiers who came from the many different social, ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups of the Peninsula and became the language of literature among Iberian intellectuals. Non-Arab courtiers such as Moses ibn Ezra, Bahya ibn Paquda, and al-Harizi composed works in both Arabic and Hebrew, and other Jewish intellectual luminaries such as Maimonides composed many of their works in Arabic.17 Various taifa kings of Berber and Slavic origins maintained courts where the virtues of Arabs were attacked using refined learned Arabic and the conceits of Arabic poetry.18 Ibn García, a courtier for the Slavic kings of the taifa kingdom of Denia, Mujahid and his son ‘Ali, extols the virtues of the indigenous inhabitants of the Peninsula as being the descendents of civilized Romans and attacks Arabs as base camel herders in an eloquent Arabic that would have allowed him entry into any Arab court from the Maghrib to Baghdad.19 Members of the different ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups of the Peninsula such as Moses ibn Ezra and Ibn García, had access to Andalusi courts according to their mastery of Arabic, Arabic poetry, and the customs of adab (as privileged in that same poetry). These were the basis for a shared courtly identity and for the courtly discourse that these courtiers used to frame their own alternative models of identity. As the works I examine in the subsequent chapters show, the adoption of the Andalusi courtly ideal was not unproblematic, and the tensions between the courtly model and alternative or conflicting models and boundaries defined by the courtier’s other communal, ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic identities sometimes results in renunciation of the Andalusi courtly ideal (see especially chapters 3 and 4).20 Yet, according to different social and political circumstances, the Andalusi courtly model could also offer an attractive alternative to competing, less refined, less cosmopolitan definitions of community for the Andalusi intellectual in exile. The authors of the works studied in this book recognize the power of both courtier and go-between as negotiators and mediators, and as links to an Andalusi culture that becomes increasingly distant in both space and time. Secular Andalusi courts disappeared after successive attacks by both the religious and socially conservative Berbers of North Africa and by the Latinate Christians of northern Iberia. As the Andalusi courts disappeared, the model of the Andalusi courtier also begins to fade, although managing to survive for some time more in the imaginary of Andalusi exiles. The narratives studied in this book, in fact, trace the disappearance of the imagined court and courtier over the course of some four hundred years. Appropriately enough, the final work examined in Representing Others, the Libro\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nde buen amor (Book of Good Love) concludes with a eulogy. The passing of the go-between, who is praised by Juan Ruiz as the sacred companion to martyrs, is symbolic of the passing of the Andalusi courtier and the world/culture he both produced and represented. Going Between The go-between, like the courtiers and intellectuals who composed the texts studied in this book, gets around. She is portrayed in constant movement. In Ibn Hazm’s treatise (chapter 1) she goes from house to house and in al-Saraqusti’s maqamat (chapter 2) she races through an urban landscape— from public baths to private homes; in al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai’s Hebrew maqamat (chapter 3) she travels between hell and earth. Juan Ruiz (chapter 5) not only has her trotting between convent and monastery, frequenting the public areas as well as private homes, but also locates her in paradise with the sainted martyrs. The go-between’s constant motion, moving in the liminal, in-between space of the street, the underworld, or heaven, resembles the migrations of the exiled courtiers that incorporate her into their fiction: some of them exiled from the court and their community (Ibn Hazm, Ibn Shabbetai, and possibly Juan Ruiz), others wandering in self-imposed exile (al-Saraqusti, al-Harizi). The go-between shows how those displaced from, but with access to positions of power can manipulate the margin—the liminal, in-between spaces of exile, to create power. The go-between’s constant movement is destabilizing. And it is this very motion or action that defines her. She is defined not by what she is, a poor, ugly, old woman, but by her actions, her mediation. The Andalusi courtier and the Christian cleric are similarly defined by what they do, by their acts of mediation: the courtier mediates between sovereign and people and between sovereign and text as both translator and author, as the cleric mediates not only between God and sinner, but also between people and knowledge as translator and author.21 As courtier or cleric, the Iberian is not, or is only secondarily, Berber, Jew, Mozarab (Arabized Christian), or Toledano—he is defined not by his ethnicity, religious, or geographical origin, but instead by what he knows, how he expresses himself, and his role as mediator.22 This too is the role of the go-between in the courtly erotic that brings lover and beloved together by negotiating in the texts and discourses of courtly desire. Yet she is supposed to remain outside of this desire. She may visit the houses of the nobles and compose courtly poetry, but she is not noble or courtly. She may unite men and women, lover and beloved, but she is neither, being too old, too ugly, and too base to be a desiring subject. Her very inability to be fixed or bounded defines her. Similarly the courtiers and intellectuals composing these works destabilize\n\n8\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nany attempts at defining a fixed Andalusi or Iberian identity. It is not enough to say that al-Harizi is a Jew or Juan Ruiz is a Christian cleric; they are these things, but they are also Sephardi and Castilian, Andalusi and Iberian. The go-between, like the cosmopolitan courtier, smoothes over differences and successfully crosses linguistic, religious, cultural, and even temporal borders. She shows that borders and limits, especially those constructed to curtail her activities such as the convent walls, moral-didactic lessons, and the individual’s moral rectitude are artificial, porous, and constantly shifting. It is precisely this ability to “pass” and to transform that arouses not just admiration as is the case within the works of Ibn Hazm and Juan Ruiz, but also suspicion and fear as in the works of al-Harizi, Ibn Shabbetai, and the pseudo-Ovid. As mentioned, the space of the go-between corresponds in many ways to the in-between as defined by Homi Bhabha as that marginal, hybrid space between nations, peoples, and empires. The in-between spaces of the go-between are the exilic and frontier spaces of Iberia. Once exiled from the court, the courtiers and clerics trained in the courtly model reimagine the court from which they have been displaced as an idealized site of intellectual and sensual pleasures as well as of potentially threatening cultural assimilation. These go-between narratives are the products of these liminal spaces. In them their authors define new rules for the courtly subject as well as modify and alter the discursive strategies of the now lost court to better suit their own exilic needs, that is, to better represent their own models of diasporic or exilic identity. Part of this transformation or hybridization is the othering of the court. This is achieved by transforming the beloved, the courtly object of desire, into the monstrous other. Once the beloved is corrupted, courtly desire, the glue that held the Andalusi court together, has been effectively rendered as other as well. In these works the go-between not only brings diverse subjects together, she also mediates between the lover and his desire. Desire becomes the nexus of this construction of courtly power. In each of the narratives we witness the go-between’s manipulation of the courtier/cleric’s desire for the courtly ideal, the beloved described by and brokered through the go-between. The beloved, the object of desire in these texts, is not an individual, desiring subject, but a socially constructed fantasy. She is defined by and her body constructed in the poetry of the court. Once displaced from the courts in which beauty and knowledge were both created and trafficked as the discourse of power, the Andalusi courtly discourse unravels. As a result, the beloved’s beautiful features become monstrous, refusing “to respect the boundaries that are supposed to limit their form.”23 The discursive construction of the stable, idealized beauty used to seduce the author-cum-narrator belies the monstrously ambiguous, the “unhomely” that lies at the heart of courtly discourse\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nand represents all that is suppressed in the monoculture of the court.24 The monstrous women that the go-between exchanges for the ordered beauty in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Iberian works reveal the anxiety of desire that haunt the memories of the Iberian court. Appropriately these monstrous women, like the go-between herself, inhabit the in-between, the liminal spaces of far off lands, the spaces between genders, and the time between youth and old age. Just as the go-between moves in a shifting, mutable space in which language and discourse loses its stability, so too the constructed beloved. Once displaced from the courtly genres that created her, she becomes a shifting, mutable representative of courtly culture. As I explore in detail in chapters 3 and 4, the juxtaposition of discursive order and disorder, the stable and the grotesque, played out on the female body complement the constructions of the female grotesque that literary critics such as Mikhail Bakhtin, Wolfgang Kayser, and more recently Mary Russo have examined in the context of both Renaissance and classical Greek and Roman literature.25 The Judeoand Andalusi-Iberian grotesque beloveds that populate Iberian go-between tales force us to reconsider the theory of the grotesque as the product of Western European culture’s response to Greek and Roman aesthetics of order. In these Iberian texts the monstrous is a response to and product of the ordered, codified system of Andalusi court culture, particularly the poetic discourse of desire expressed in Arabo-Andalusi poetry. The Andalusi go-between will never fully shed her identity as agent of this Andalusi court culture, even as she crosses the borders of al-Andalus itself, north into Western Europe. As the works examined in this book reveal, this Andalusi cultural model and its chief representative, the gobetween, will outlive the courts of al-Andalus that created them. Whereas the members of these courts—caliphs, emirs, kings and their courtiers— struggle first against one another and then with the increasingly large and powerful foreign forces from both the south and the north, these old women from Cordoba keep the Andalusi court alive if only as a figurative/ imagined space of courtly desire. Each of the subsequent chapters traces the go-between as she is transported one step further away from the geographical, temporal, and cultural space of Ibn Hazm’s eleventh-century ideal al-Andalus. * * * Representing Others consists of five chapters, each of which examines how exiled cosmopolitan authors, trained in the Andalusi court model, use the go-between narrative to explore constructions of Andalusi identity. The earliest Iberian versions of the go-between narrative (discussed in chapters 1–3)\n\n10\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nhave received less critical attention, the last version I examine (chapter 5), that of the Spanish Libro de buen amor, has been the focus of a tremendous amount of modern Hispanic scholarship.26 Because the variants of this narrative appear in the different languages of the medieval Mediterranean world, including Arabic, Hebrew, Castilian, and Latin, critics working independently in each of these areas tend to focus on each narrative as unique within the literature of that particular language and/or literary tradition, and not as an Iberian narrative that roams freely across linguistic, religious, and political boundaries. This study breaks down the boundaries created by modern scholarship and asks the reader to focus not on Arabic, Hebrew, or even Spanish Literature (or on Muslims, Jews, or Christians), but on medieval literature produced by a cosmopolitan group of Iberian intellectuals who figuratively inhabited and represented the cultural space of the Andalusi court. Chapter 1, “Palaces of Memory,” deals with the earliest go-between narrative to appear in medieval Iberia, Ibn Hazm’s chapter on the go-between (as-safir) included in his treatise on courtly desire, The Dove’s Neck Ring.27 Ibn Hazm was an Andalusi courtier who witnessed the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate and the rise of the ‘Amirid usurper, the former courtier alMansur.28 Because of the political and social transformations of his native al-Andalus under the Berbers and taifa kings, Ibn Hazm could no longer participate in the caliphal court of his youth except through mediation— through the idealized lens of memory and the imaginary. In the midst of the ethnic and religious factionalism surging across al-Andalus, Ibn Hazm pens an ethical treatise that defines the Andalusi not according to his ethnic origins or religious affiliations, but according to his skills as a courtly lover. In this treatise Ibn Hazm instructs his reader on how to become the ideal lover, and in so doing the ideal Andalusi. Through the lens of courtly love, Ibn Hazm creates an Andalusi literary identity by adapting Eastern literary modes to the cultural context of al-Andalus, evident in the vivid anecdotes of the Andalusi courtiers’ love lives with which he peppers the work. The go-between becomes part of Ibn Hazm’s discourse of Andalusi identity. He defines the ideal go-betweens as those old, pious women who roamed the streets of Cordoba and gained entry to noble women’s homes on the pretext of selling baubles or beauty products. Ibn Hazm’s inclusion of the gobetween into this national discourse of love reflects Andalusi social mores, according to which many women of the upper classes would not have been allowed in public or to entertain suitors in their homes, as well as the prevalence and importance of mediators/courtiers involved in the most important affairs of state. Whereas Ibn Hazm, loyal but displaced courtier of the ‘AmiridUmayyad court, had faith that the lover and his desire could be faithfully\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nrepresented by the go-between, al-Saraqusti, a twelfth-century scholar trained in the taifa court of Saragossa, depicts go-betweens as opportunists who skillfully manipulate others’ desire and the rhetoric of courtly love for their own benefit. Just as Ibn Hazm had adopted Eastern models to express his notions of Andalusi identity, al-Saraqusti also turns to Eastern literary models, namely the maqamat, to address political and social tensions in Andalusi society. Chapter 2 traces the process by which courtly desire becomes a pretext for social criticism in al-Saraqusti’s maqamat. His twelfth maqama, “The Persian,” critiques the role of singing slave girls, women that form an integral part of Ibn Hazm’s courtly world and who were professionally related to the go-between in Andalusi cultural practices. The gobetween of al-Saraqusti’s ninth maqama, Umm ‘Amr, distorts courtly discourse to manipulate and ultimately rob the protagonist. The go-between expands her role from simple mediator or representative to author responsible for the production and representation of desire. Umm ‘Amr provides a description of the beloved that conforms to the Andalusi code of ideal beauty, but in the end the reader, like the protagonist, is left to wonder if any such woman existed, or if her description derived only from the idealized discourse of courtly poetry. In al-Saraqusti’s maqama, the discourse of courtly love is emptied of meaning, becoming simply a tool used by corrupt intermediaries to satisfy their own desires. Corruption and the grotesque become central themes in the two JudeoAndalusi go-between narratives analyzed in chapter 3. In the thirteenthcentury go-between tales of al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai, the go-between as transmitter and facilitator of Arabized, secular courtly poetry becomes an agent of assimilation, metaphorically represented as corrupt female flesh. Al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai were both trained in the Andalusi model of the courtier-rabbi; however both lived not among Arabs but among Christians in Castile and Provence.29 Both embody the transfer of cultural capital from south to north (from Islam to Christianity) that occurred in the wake of the Almoravid invasion. Al-Harizi worked as a Hebrew translator of Islamic and Jewish texts written in Arabic for the Jewish communities of Provence and France, to whom the intellectual achievements of the Iberian Jews were novel but suspect. The secular prose and poetry of Iberian Jews was suspiciously like that of the Arabs, and even their theology smacked of the rationalism that prevailed among medieval Islamic thinkers. In their gobetween tales both al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai address the conflict between the rationalistic, secular courtly discourse of the Judeo-Iberian courtier and the traditional Talmudic (Rabbinic and Tosafist) approach to Judaism that defined the Northern European Jew. As al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai adapt the go-between tale to changes in Iberian society, they give the go-between a more central position and\n\n12\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\ndistort and even reconfigure the message of courtly desire. The object of courtly desire, like the lost Andalusi court, is not as ideal as previously imagined. While al-Saraqusti’s maqama leaves us doubting whether the beloved ever existed, in chapter 3, the protagonist encounters the beloved’s fractured, grotesque body that belies the go-between’s idealized representation of her. Corrupt, dismembered diabolic bodies reflect the fracturing of Arab-Andalusi court culture in diaspora. Al-Harizi contrasts the decayed Andalusi beloved with a new symbol of unchanging beauty and truth for the diasporic Jew—the gendered embodiment of the Hebrew language and Jewish tradition. And both al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai show Hebrew as a language capable of expressing a unique Sephardi courtly desire. In chapter 4 the go-between and the grotesque body of the beloved are inscribed into ecclesiastical definitions of gender and enter into what we would today consider, thanks to Foucault, the history of Western sexuality. In this chapter I explore how, as Andalusi culture and knowledge is translated and disseminated (most likely by Iberian Jews in the Diaspora), the go-between reaches into Western Christian Europe. Once she is introduced into thirteenth-century clerical discourses, the go-between, as a vehicle for Andalusi courtly desire, becomes a catalyst for definitions of normative Western sexuality. In Christian Europe the go-between “passes” from the Arabic and Hebrew maqamat to the Latin elegiac comedy. This process entails significant transformation. As she is incorporated into the Western canon in the late-twelfth to early-thirteenth-century De Vetula, the go-between is cleansed of her Arabic and Hebrew lineage. She becomes the product not of Iberian Jews or Arabs, but of the Roman (pagan cum Christian by the High Middle Ages) erotic authority, Ovid. She is now ready for Christian consumption and her subversive and destructive potential is checked. De Vetula, like the Hebrew maqamat, is a hybrid text that introduces (translates) Arab philosophical, medical, and erotic knowledge into Latin for a scholastic audience. As in the Judeo-Iberian maqamat, the go-between functions as the ambiguous locus of this translatio. She is a master of courtly rhetoric who not only tricks the protagonist with her description of the ideal beloved but also replaces the beloved in bed. Her body becomes the aged, polluted flesh of the beloved. The anonymous author suggests that this corrupted flesh is not that of a woman, but that of a spadon or eunuch, further distancing the Andalusi erotic discourse that the gobetween embodies from the normative erotics/sexual desire of Christian Europe. As De Vetula shows, both the go-between and the discourse of Andalusi courtly desire translate poorly into the Latin, scholastic culture of Western Europe. The existence of this hybrid Andalusi go-between tale in Latin, though, does attest to the continued existence of the underlying\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nquestions of alterity, identity, and assimilation that the go-between is used to address, and that still figure prominently in the intellectual life of the Mediterranean world of the High Middle Ages. These issues, in fact, are at the heart of the Spanish masterpiece, the Libro de buen amor, the subject of chapter 5. This fourteenth-century Castilian work, composed by a Mozarab cleric, more likely than not the Juan Ruiz named in the text, brings us back to the Iberian Peninsula to interrogate the cultural border between Andalusi Iberia and Christian Reconquest Spain. In form the work is a maqamat, but it is composed in the Romance vernacular and, like the maqamat of Ibn Shabbetai and al-Harizi whose purpose was, in part, to prove the viability of Hebrew as a literary language on par with Arabic, the Libro de buen amor is part of a cultural project that showed that the Castilian language was a worthy contender, not just of Iberian Arabic, but also of the Latin of Christian Europe. The Libro de buen amor makes accessible to a Romance-speaking, European audience the translated and transformed literary conventions and topos of Andalusi Iberia, similar to the way al-Harizi introduced Judeo-Iberian material to Northern European Jews. The presence of the go-between, Trotaconventos, in the Libro underscores the work’s hybridity and intermediacy, having, as it does, one foot in the cultural patrimony of al-Andalus and another in the literary world of the Christian scholastic. Not surprisingly, the go-between is again crucial in negotiating these disparate traditions. Unlike the author of De Vetula, Juan Ruiz, the Mozarab cleric who wrote the Libro, is not suspicious of hybridity and translation, but instead celebrates them. Neither Trotaconventos nor the author-protagonist’s celebration of her makes sense from the perspective of European Christian Literature, but become recognizable in the context of earlier Iberian go-between narratives. Juan Ruiz’s go-between is the faithful and loyal representative Ibn Hazm imagined, as well as the desiring subjects al-Harizi and Ibn Shabbetai depict with such mistrust. Instead of being threatened by her agency, however, Juan Ruiz eulogizes it. Trotaconventos becomes the lover’s best friend and helper. Juan Ruiz, like the protagonists of the maqamat and Latin comedy, is unsuccessful in his own attempts at seduction through the use of the conventional erotic lyric. Whereas in the previous works, the go-between simply exploited the erotic lyric to her own advantage, in the Libro de buen amor Trotaconventos does something new: she creates a narrative of seduction. In her coercions and seductions Trotaconventos successfully translates and transforms the courtly discourse of the erotic lyric into narrative exempla and proverbs. As a hybrid text that grows out of the Arabic and Hebrew maqamat of medieval Iberia and incorporates other Christian European literary material, the Libro de buen amor, like the go-between, functions as a cultural intermediary at a moment of intense cultural interaction and exchange.\n\n14\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nRepresenting Others, like the go-betweens and exiled Andalusis it studies, gets around. In it I analyze works composed in four of the languages of medieval Iberia over a course of some four hundred years. The Iberian gobetween narrative proved to be a lasting and adaptable allegory for the condition of the Andalusi exile. In each chapter I examine how the gobetween figure in a specific work, composed within a particular historical context, functions in the fictional imaginary not only to unite lover and beloved, but also to return the exiled Andalusi author and/or reader, however briefly, to the lost culture of the Andalusi court. This passage—from lover to beloved, from present to past—may be welcome or dangerous, depending on the particular author, but it comes to have transcendent significance for exiles pushed geographically and temporally further from the Andalusi courts of the so-called Golden Age. The go-between used to access this courtly culture is either praised or vituperated; nevertheless, her tales have survived long after the courts and authors that produced them have vanished.\n\nCHAPTER 1 PALACES OF MEMORY: MEDIATION, COURT CULTURE, AND THE CALIPHATE\n\nO jewel of China, be far off! I am content with the red ruby of al-Andalus! —Ibn Hazm, The Dove’s Neck Ring\n\nhe Andalusi author ‘Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Hazm al-Andalusi (994–1064) included the above verses in his treatise on love, The Dove’s Neck Ring (Tawq al-hamama).1 Ibn Hazm wrote this work from exile during a bloody and divisive period of Andalusi history known as the fitna (1009–1031).2 This period of civil wars followed the relative stability of the Umayyad caliphate that had established the Iberian Peninsula as a center of AraboIslamic culture. The early Umayyad caliphs modeled their courts on ‘Abbasid models and their courtiers looked east for the latest literary and social trends. During the last phases of the Umayyad caliphate, however, Andalusi intellectuals and courtiers, such as Ibn Hazm, return their gaze to the Iberian Peninsula and begin to shape in their own work an independent al-Andalus that stands alone as a locus of culture. Whereas ninth- and tenth-century ‘Abbasid literature had responded to the literatures and cultures of the East that had come under Islamic domination, the Byzantine in Syria and the Persian in Iraq (and through the Persian those cultures of the even further East, such as India and China), Andalusi poets and theologians begin to adapt Iberian and Western forms to the official discourses of Arabic culture circulating in and defining the Andalusi courts. In The Dove’s Neck Ring, Ibn Hazm codifies this hybrid Andalusi discourse of love. He states unequivocally that he no desire for the jewels of China, for he has Andalusi rubies. Such a redefinition of the object of desire requires a remapping of the very\n\nT\n\n16\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nprocess of desire itself, and this is just what we find in The Dove’s Neck Ring. This treatise brings the Eastern rules of desire from Baghdad to the streets, public baths, and women’s quarters of al-Andalus. Here these Eastern erotic models must be refitted to suit the diverse Andalusi population of Berbers, muwalladun, Slavs, and slave women from all over the Islamic world. Adapting these Eastern models to Andalusi society requires the skills of a trained mediator. Such a mediator must, like the courtierauthor Ibn Hazm, be adept at observing and communicating the desires of others, but also capable of constructing original discourses of mediation that can bridge the religious, linguistic and ethnic differences separating Andalusis. Ibn Hazm’s Andalusi rubies remain hidden in women’s chambers and behind the closed doors of the court. The closed quarters and private spaces through which Ibn Hazm will take us in search of these jewels give us glimpses of eleventh-century Andalusi life, and also give us a model for Andalusi society. As Ibn Hazm is composing The Dove’s Neck Ring, this diverse society is falling apart and breaking into independent factions along cultural, linguistic, and ethnic lines. We see this factionalism behind the Andalusi landscapes described by Ibn Hazm—urban landscapes that affect the lives of the lovers (people separated into quarters, losing themselves in the crowd as they navigate the maze of streets) and landscapes of war that rupture the lovers’ happiness (the battlefields and camps where lovers join the enemy ranks and/or are separated by fighting and captivity). The physical and sociocultural landscapes of The Dove’s Neck Ring consist of boundaries—enemy lines, the closed doors of homes and palaces, and the confusing streets in which the furtive lovers wander. Like the factional and broken political landscape of eleventh-century al-Andalus, Ibn Hazm’s erotic landscape is similarly a landscape of division. The boundaries and divisions between lovers described in The Dove’s Neck Ring make the use of a mediator necessary. Such a figure is not necessary in the court poetry of the ‘Abbasids. It is in the civil war of al-Andalus that such a figure’s skills are needed: she is uniquely suited to overcoming the ethnic, linguistic, and social boundaries pulling al-Andalus apart. The Andalusi go-between knows where the rubies Ibn Hazm seeks are located and knows how to get them. Her knowledge of the streets of Cordoba and of Andalusi social realities allows her to mediate between lover and beloved: And after this there occurs in love, when confidence had been established and mutual acquaintance had become complete, the entry of the messenger. It is necessary to choose him, and select him, and pick him out carefully, and seek him cautiously, for he is an indication of a man’s wit, and in\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n17\n\nhis hand lies his life and death, his honor and shame—after God, Most High. It behooves that the messenger be ready and keen, for whom a sign is sufficient, who guesses right things hidden, is capable of doing things of his own initiative, and supplies from his own wit what the one who sent him has overlooked, and conveys to the person who sent him everything he witnesses precisely; (capable of) keeping secrets, observing agreements, faithful, contented with little, giving good advice. And if he does not come up to this description, the damage done by him falls back on the one who sent him in proportion to what above qualities he lacks. . . .The kind of people whom lovers use most as messengers to those whom they love are these: either a (low-class) servant. . .or a person of high standing to whom no evil opinion is attached on account of the righteousness he shows or of the high age he has reached. Oh! How many of this type are found amongst women, especially those who have staffs, prayer beads, and wear a double red garment. Indeed I remember that in Cordoba women of good breeding were cautioned against women fitting this description whenever they saw them.3\n\nIn this earliest recorded description of the go-between from al-Andalus, Ibn Hazm moves from an abstract ideal, the generic “he” of the first section, to the specific, the old women of Cordoba. He tells us that he remembers from his youth many women in Cordoba who conformed to his ideal of the trustworthy go-between. The go-betweens that inhabit Ibn Hazm’s memories become part of the Andalusi identity constructed in The Dove’s Neck Ring. These old women are absent from the Bedouin poetry Ibn Hazm refers to as Eastern and non-Andalusi. Whereas much of the rest of this treatise echoes beliefs and codes of love similar to those set forth by eastern Baghdadi authors, the chapter on the go-between is marked as Andalusi. Ibn Hazm evokes the ideal, trustworthy messenger from his own past.4 The Cordoba to which Ibn Hazm refers in this passage is that of the Umayyad caliphate—the Cordoba described by the tenth-century German nun Hroswitha as the ornament of the world.5 By the time Ibn Hazm pens The Dove’s Neck Ring, this Cordoba, populated by lovers, beloveds, and their go-betweens only exists in memories such as those of Ibn Hazm. In this chapter I explore how, in response to the ethnic and political divisions that erupted in the fitna, Ibn Hazm constructed a portrait of the lost eleventh-century Umayyad-‘Amirid Andalusi court, and of the gobetween and the courtiers that inhabit it. Ibn Hazm not only codifies what had become a ritualized form of public behavior among the courtiers of the Muslim world, but he makes it a uniquely Andalusi phenomenon—the courtly love of the courtiers of Umayyad and ‘Amirid al-Andalus.6 Ibn Hazm’s inclusion of the go-between into this courtly discourse reflects the central role of mediators in the recent Andalusi past.\n\n18\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nCourtiers and the Art of Mediation Mediators were an integral part of medieval Muslim sociopolitical structure in the Iberian Peninsula. Andalusi chronicles are replete with tales of both the betrayals of trusted courtiers and the hubris of courtiers who overstep their position. These tales are recorded by courtiers who self-consciously fashion their narratives according to the politics of their patrons.7 In the public sphere during the tenth and eleventh centuries, in both literature and collective memory/experience, there were ample examples of the skill, power, and sometimes threat associated with mediators and mediation. The courtiers and intellectuals in the royal courts were the gatekeepers who both produced and controlled Andalusi culture and identity, shaping it from the literature, art, philosophy, theology, and political theory of the Arab-speaking world. However, these same courtiers were often from a different religious or ethnic group from that of the ruler and dominant social group.8 The culture of the court was open to all, provided they had a mastery of adab, the proper behavior and knowledge of Arabic court culture.9 By the time of the ‘Amirids (976–1008), the ambitious courtier, even if he was not of Arab descent, could flourish and advance to the highest levels or power, becoming even sovereign, as long as he mastered the codes of this courtly culture and its literature. Al-Mansur, the usurper of the Umayyad caliphate, was proof of this. He gained entrée into the court because of his literary and cultural skills. He began as a scribe (katib), hired to tutor the caliph al-Hakam’s son, and quickly progressed up through the court hierarchy.10 In his capacity as prime minister, Al-Mansur composed and issued, in the name of the Umayyad caliph al-Hisham II, the very document that granted him effective control of the caliphate. Al-Mansur’s coup was, in fact, a coup of mediation. Al-Mansur, the patron of Ibn Hazm’s father, was a shrewd politician and courtier who used his skills to maintain his power for a period of some twenty years and then to pass control of the caliphate on to his sons. Despite the fact that the Umayyads were betrayed by a courtier trained in their own courts, subsequent Andalusi rulers continued to cultivate courts and maintain courtiers in imitation of the splendor and customs of the Umayyad court. Ibn Hazm, like al-Mansur, was proof that the Andalusi court was not populated exclusively by the Arab ruling classes. According to Emilio García Gómez and Miguel Asín Palacios, Ibn Hazm’s grandfather was a non-Arab and a non-Muslim, probably a native of Mount Lisham (Huelva).11 Ibn Hazm’s father, Ahmad, however, received an excellent education and became a courtier (vizier) in the court of the last Umayyad caliph. As vizier to al-Hisham II, Ahmad also served al-Mansur, who in his capacity as prime\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n19\n\nminister had by that time effectively usurped royal power. Al-Hisham, living under virtual palace arrest, retained the title of caliph, but al-Mansur, his prime minister, was the one who exercised control. After al-Mansur’s death, Ibn Hazm’s father continued to serve as vizier to al-Mansur’s sons, al-Muzaffar and Sanchuelo. Although Ahmad and his son made use of a false genealogy that traced their family history back to Persia in order to legitimate their inclusion in the court, what mattered most in the Andalusi courts, and what allowed access to those courts, was not genealogy but skill and knowledge. Genealogy could be faked, knowledge and skill could not. In order to break up the Arab hegemony over political and military matters that had characterized the Umayyad dynasty, al-Mansur had consciously diversified and professionalized his military by employing primarily Berbers and saqaliba, slaves of European origin.12 Hugh Kennedy points out that although there had been a saqaliba presence under the Umayyad caliphs, only in the tenth century “did they become a large professional military force as well as forming the most influential group among the palace servants.” The most influential group of servants at the ‘Amirid court no longer consisted of Arabs, or even Andalusis of Muslim origin, but servants brought as captives mostly from Christian lands, and in the tenth century those lands were increasingly the territory of northern Spain.13 Some of those palace servants would have come with ‘Abda, King Sancho of Navarra’s daughter, whom al-Mansur married, and with whom he had a son (‘Abd al-Rahman, known as “Sanchuelo”) in 983. Still more may have also come with the daughter of King Vermudo II of León whom al-Mansur took first as a concubine and later married.14 Thus we see that, because of al-Mansur’s political alliances and military policies, the ‘Amirid court was by no means a bastion of Arab culture, but, quite to the contrary, a hybrid space where Muslims and Christians of various ethnic backgrounds interacted socially and professionally.15 Even as al-Mansur and his sons diversified the Andalusi court and destabilized the Umayyad caliphate, courtiers such as Ibn Hazm and his friends reacted by turning to the Arabic language and “things Arabic” (‘arabiyya).16 As the political situation collapsed and al-Andalus was pulled apart by the different ethnic factions of Berber, saqaliba, and Arab, Ibn Hazm was among a group of intellectuals that sought to hold the culture together by emphasizing what had held together the ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse Umayyad court—adab (the Arabic language and traditions from which courtliness was formed). This group included Ibn Hazm’s friend, the poet Ibn Shuhaid, and other companions “united by their nobility, their intelligence, their education and—above all—their peerless dominion over that most noble tool of their trade, the Arabic language.”17 This group of young aristocrats and courtiers favored the use of Arabic over local dialects\n\n20\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nand paid special attention to Baghdadi literary and fashion trends with the goal of ultimately creating an independent Andalusi culture in Arabic based on Eastern models.18 This group’s Arabness is distinctly Andalusi. The language and especially the erotic poetry at the heart of their constructions of Andalusi behavior, though based on the remembered literary world of the Umayyad court, are designed for readers from (and in) the Andalusi courts of the former ‘Amirids and the emerging muluk at-tawa’if (taifa kings).19 Umayyad caliphate court culture had been highly ceremonial and it was designed to distance members of the court—courtier, public, and visitor alike—from the caliph, which it did by underscoring the latter’s elevated status as divinely ordained ruler.20 With the ascension to power of al-Mansur, an usurper who could not claim divine right, the ceremonial gave way to a more private and personal court culture focused not on projecting the absolute and divine power of the caliph to his subjects, but on intimate, personal contact between ruler and the most distinguished of courtiers, often in the context of pleasurable activities such as the garden wine party (majlis al-uns).21 These pleasure gatherings replaced the formal ceremonial court gatherings of the Umayyad dynasty, during which courtiers interacted with the caliph in a very limited capacity and only then as part of his official duties. At the majlis, in contrast, the ‘Amirid rulers participated with the courtiers in the pleasurable activities of wine drinking, composing poetry, and philosophizing on the nature of love.22 An entire ritual of behavior came to be associated with the majlis, and poetry had a central role in it, both reflecting and producing the themes of the garden wine party. The model participant was the zarif, the elegant and refined courtier who was characterized chiefly by his rhetorical abilities and by “his or her adherence to an elaborate and ritualized code of public behaviour which dictated everything from proper greetings for specific occasions to the elegant way to conduct a love affair to the sort of shoelaces one should sport while doing so, complete with the verses inscribed on their tips.”23 The love affair provided the zarif with a suitable pretext for showing off his elegant manners and literary skills. The object of the courtier’s affection could be another courtier, a slave women or even a young saqi, or cupbearer—all apparently part of both the literary and social world of the majlis and the court.24 “Courtly wine drinking and love customs may already have existed in Iraq and Persia before Islam,” but it is among eighth- and ninth-century ‘Abbasid poets that such customs make their way into the Arabic literature of the court.25 The Persian poet Ziryab, who brought the latest trends in Eastern adab to ninth-century al-Andalus, also brings the poetry of Abu Nuwas, whose poetry on drunkenness and sex with boys and girls was extremely popular in the ‘Abbasid court.26 Umayyad court poets adapted the forms and motifs of Abu Nuwas’s brand of erotic poetry to Iberian\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n21\n\nstrophic forms and to the Andalusi court, developing a hybrid poetry that reveals “an Andalusian nationalism of sentiment yet at the same time a servile imitation of the East.”27 The Dove’s Neck Ring reads as a manifesto for the new poetic conventions popular in al-Andalus. In it Ibn Hazm forges a unique brand of Andalusi court literature out of popular Eastern literary motifs. Though the classical qasida on the topic of love opens with a description of the lover’s abandoned campsite (the nasib) typical of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins of the Arabian Peninsula, Ibn Hazm asserts that such conventions no longer apply in al-Andalus; they are from a distinct tradition, “Excuse me from bringing up the tales of the Bedouins and the ancients, for their ways are different from ours. The tales about them are plentiful and it is not my principle to wear out anybody’s camel but mine, nor do I adorn myself with borrowed ornaments.”28 Here we see an example of how Ibn Hazm appropriates the subject of classical Arabic poetry and adapts it to his own needs, a changed court life and new role for the courtier. This appropriation is also reflected in the form of the work, for Ibn Hazm composes his treatise on love in the saj’ (rhymed prose) of the relatively new risala (epistle) form, interspersed with poetry, and not in the traditional verse form and the nasib to which he refers here.29 Ibn Hazm’s systematic reframing of Eastern motifs according to Andalusi models extends beyond the literary forms he uses. Instead of the conventional examples of model lovers (for example, Jamil wa Buthayna and Majnun wa Layla), Ibn Hazm opts to include Andalusi historical figures as examples of the model lover. Al-Andalus does not need Majnun wa Layla and the tales of the Bedouin when it has caliphs like ‘Abd al-Rahman I, II, and III, and al-Hakam I and II, who, according to Ibn Hazm, were not only great political leaders but also exemplary lovers. This hybrid courtly literature maintained the traditional legitimating function that poetry had had in earlier ‘Abbasid, Umayyad, and ‘Amirid courts. However, in The Dove’s Neck Ring erotic poetry is used to legitimate a court and a way of life that have been replaced by factional fighting and that continues to exist only in memory. Andalusi Love and Lovers Ibn Hazm’s treatise contextualizes desire in the recent Andalusi past—in the ‘Amirid courts and streets of the Umayyad capital, Cordoba. The first chapter of The Dove’s Neck Ring includes a list of Andalusi caliphs and their “men of state” that Ibn Hazm claims are model lovers: ‘Abd al-Rahman I, II, and III, al-Hakam I and II, ‘Abd al-Allah and al-Muzaffar.30 All but the last two are Umayyad caliphs. Ibn Hazm legitimizes the son of the ‘Amirid usurpur al-Mansur, al-Muzaffar, by including him in this list. Ibn Hazm is\n\n22\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\ncareful to point out here that love is not forbidden by religion. Using the Andalusi caliphs and sovereigns as exemplary lovers reinforces Ibn Hazm’s assertion that love is an ennobling and divinely inspired sentiment and legitimates it as the courtly discourse of power. Ibn Hazm sets forth in The Dove’s Neck Ring a guide to love designed not only to shape the perfect lover, but also to simultaneously create the ideal member of the Andalusi court. Once he has mastered the rules of love, the courtier is morally prepared to serve beloved and ruler (the caliphs, after all, being model lovers themselves) in the service of the nation. Part of this education includes instruction on how to avoid evil urges like passion and greed. Although Ibn Hazm refrains from naming al-Mansur or his son al-Muzaffar in the examples of evil behavior he gives, the eleventh-century reader would recognize in Ibn Hazm’s examples of failed and evil lovers the same desires and motivations that led the illegitimate ‘Amirid and taifa sovereigns to exploit their office for personal gain. The Neoplatonic love described by Ibn Hazm in The Dove’s Neck Ring is something that can affect all members of the court, caliphs and slaves alike.31 For Ibn Hazm, love is intimately tied to beauty, and beauty, like love, is divine in nature—an attribute given by God. Appreciation of a beautiful form is the first stage in divinely inspired love.32 Ibn Hazm is careful to distinguish the Neoplatonic love (hubb) that can ennoble even the caliphs, from other similar but much more nefarious urges such as desire (’ishq) and passion (hawa). Part of Ibn Hazm’s instructions to the readers on how to become an ideal lover involve warning them on how to avoid those other urges with which love can be confused. In chapter 29, entitled “Ugliness of Illicit Practices,” Ibn Hazm carefully distinguishes love, hubb, from passion, hawa, using Neoplatonic terminology to explain the spiritual nature of each: Many people obey their souls and disobey their reason(s), and follow their passions and abandon their religion; and keep aloof from what God, Most High, encourages (people to do) and what he puts into sound minds in the way of moderation, and forsaking sinful acts, and fighting passion successfully. They oppose God, their Lord, and please Iblis [the Devil] in what he likes in the way of ruinous passions, and practice (illicit sexual) aberrations in their love. We know indeed that God, Most High and Exalted, combined in man two opposite natures: one of them advises nothing but virtue, and incites to nothing but goodness, and nothing is conceived by it except whatever is agreeable: and this is reason and its guide is justice: and the other, its opposite, advises nothing but passions and leads only to perdition: this is the soul and its guide is passion, and God, Most High, says: “Verily, the soul is very urgent to evil.”33\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n23\n\nFor Ibn Hazm love and passion are two different types of desire—the first is good and the second is bad. Both involve different processes and different aspects of man’s nature. Love is divinely sanctioned and reinforces man’s relationship to God, whereas passion leads to evil, sin, and the abandonment of one’s religion. As we shall discuss below, for Ibn Hazm the ideal go-between, who is an expert observer, keeper of secrets, and giver of good advice, assists man in attaining good love, whereas the bad gobetween, the bad observer, blabber mouth, and source of bad advice, leads to passion and causes shame and damage to the lover’s social standing and spiritual health.34 Ibn Hazm gives examples of the types of lovers, both the good lover, who loves in moderation and according to reason, and the evil lover, who follows passion, as well as several concrete examples of such men in Andalusi society. In the following passage Ibn Hazm explains what distinguishes the good man from the bad: And the righteous man is he who does not mix with depraved people, and does not expose himself to sights which would bring forth passions nor does he lift his eyes to marvelously composed images; and the bad man is he who seeks the company of vicious people, and unfolds his sight to beautifully made faces, and applies himself to seeing evil sights, and loves solitary places which lead to ruin. . . . And as regards a neglected woman and a man who exposes himself, both are lead to ruin and perish. For this reason it was forbidden to a Muslim to take delight in hearing the melodious voice of a strange woman, because the first look would be made at you and the second against you.35\n\nThe good lover chooses not to put himself into compromising situations, whereas the evil lover deliberately seeks them out. Ibn Hazm identifies the strange/foreign woman as being particularly dangerous and as one of the experiences that the good/proper lover should avoid. The description of the evil lover who chooses depraved companions and superficial beauty in remote locales, particularly the beauty of strange women, could be a description of the lovers examined in Representing Others who tell their tales of beautiful women, seduction, and betrayal at the hands of the go-between from exile far from their homes. The Andalusi Go-Between Like the ‘Amirids who brought about the end of the Umayyad caliphate in al-Andalus from within the court they entered as courtiers and ran as prime ministers, the go-between lies at the heart of Ibn Hazm’s treatise on love as\n\n24\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\na destabilizing force with the potential to subvert the affair and to wreck havoc in the lover’s life. In the chapter on the messenger, Ibn Hazm instructs his reader on how to select the best type of go-between in order to seduce the beloved and to minimize damage to the lover: “It behooves that the messenger be ready and keen, for whom a sign is sufficient. . . And if he does not come up to this description, the damage done by him falls back on the one who sent him.”36 The best go-between is loyal and will faithfully represent the wishes of the lover: one whose wants and desires are as close to those of the lover he/she is serving as possible and someone “faithful, contented with little, giving good advice.” The eleventh-century Andalusi go-between would have had access to women that the male lover could never approach himself. Since in Andalusi society many women were sequestered in their homes, going out only with male family members and then well-covered, the male lover would have had no way of knowing first hand of their beauty.37 In such a case the go-between was needed to carry messages and to provide the lover with eyewitness accounts of her physical attributes. The Dove’s Neck Ring is littered with examples that help us specify the exact nature of the go-between’s mediation. Part of her job was to provide the lover not only with detailed and accurate descriptions of the beloved but also to deliver poems or statements designed to show the lover’s wit. In chapter 4, “Love from Description,” Ibn Hazm informs us that love can have its origins in a description of the beloved. The lover’s passion may be aroused by such a description without ever having seen the beloved. Once aroused by the description of the beloved, the lover then needs to proceed to the next step of exchanging messages with the beloved.38 Presumably it would be the go-between who provided the initial description—and thus Ibn Hazm’s emphasis on choosing a go-between who can convey all he/she observes precisely. Ibn Hazm further specifies in chapter 8, “About Allusion in Speech,” the types of messages and correspondence that love requires between the lovers, including poems, allegories, enigmatic remarks, or “some abstruse verse.”39 The go-between is entrusted with both communicating these poems, allegories, or remarks to the beloved and then giving the lover as accurate an account as possible of the beloved’s reaction. By establishing the go-between figure as essential in the different stages of the love process, Ibn Hazm opens up a space for mediation and for the mediator between lover and beloved. Though love may be a divine force capable of overcoming deep ethnic and political divisions, it is not a spontaneous phenomenon occurring between two persons, but instead a choreographed performance (or production) requiring at least three, but often more people, each with a specific role. In addition to the go-between, whose role, as described above, is delivering messages between lovers as well as providing\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n25\n\ndescriptions of the beautiful form of the lovers, Ibn Hazm also includes the helpful friend, the spy, and the slanderer. The performative and public nature of love as a public spectacle that involves so many set characters is similar to the function of the courtiers in the court—in each the characters have a set role that is based on the code of love as defined in Arab court poetry. In the chapter on the go-between, Ibn Hazm underscores the necessity of finding a trustworthy messenger (“It is necessary to choose him, and select him, and pick him out carefully”), stressing the harm that results from choosing poorly (“And if he does not come up to this description, the damage done by him falls back on the one who sent him in proportion to what above qualities he lacks”). Ibn Hazm’s description of the go-between, which includes loyalty, wit, intelligence, and the ability to keep secrets and to give good advice, could be the description of the ideal courtier, just the sort of person the ruler/lover would want to have on his side and in his court. The go-between’s primary function, as described by Ibn Hazm, is as a “sign, proof or guide to man’s intellect/reason” (dalil ‘aql al-mar’).40 Yet the go-between is something more, something better, in fact, for he/she fills in the gaps in the lover’s intellect/reason (‘aql) with his/her own.41 The go-between is adept at readings signs, discerning hidden motives, and recording and transmitting details of observation; in essence, the go-between is a trained exegete of experience. Ibn Hazm, courtier, intellectual, and trained Quranic and legal commentator has created the go-between in his own image.42 Both move in a world of signs and interpretation, and their performance, like the sword, can cut both ways.43 The go-between, like the courtier, is paradoxically both a subordinate representative of the one he/she serves, as well as someone who, in the very act of exercising his/her office, assumes control over the one he/she serves, for he/she has a part in determining their fate: “his life and death, his honor and shame.” This go-between, like the passions and justice that guide men’s soul and intellect, not only negotiates between the lover and the object of his desire, she also assists in constructing that desire and channeling it toward the appropriate object of desire. If the lover’s desire is good (hubb) and the gobetween faithfully represents his intellect (‘aql) to the beloved, then the love he receives will give him joy and life. However, should the go-between falter and lead him down the path of passion (hawa) by misrepresenting his desire or the nature of the beloved, the go-between will lead him to illicit desire. Ibn Hazm recognizes the dangers associated with the go-between when, upon remembering the specific sort of women perfect for this in Cordoba, he mentions that noble women were warned against them: Oh! How many of this type are found amongst women, especially those who have staffs, prayer beads, and wear a double red garment. Indeed I remember\n\n26\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nthat in Cordoba women of good breeding were cautioned against women fitting this description whenever they saw them. Women who have professions that cause them to circulate among various people are another type. Among women of this type there is the doctor, the cupper, the thief, the hawker, the hairdresser, the professional mourner, the songstress, the diviner, the instructress, the entertainer, the seamstress and the weaver.44\n\nThe juxtaposition of social class exposes the tension between those who might be go-betweens (lower-class working women) and potential beloveds (women of good breeding). In addition to hinting in this passage at the potential danger posed by women without breeding, Ibn Hazm ironically also invests the uncourtly workingwomen of the lower classes with a role in the production and creation of courtly meaning. Nothing can be more marginal to court erotics than the professional women listed here by Ibn Hazm—these women circulating outside of the courtly centers of power. In his treatise, Ibn Hazm brings these workingwomen, doctors, cuppers, thieves, hairdressers, curanderas into the company of caliphs. Just as love is a universal force felt by all, Ibn Hazm constructs an Andalusi love such that these displaced, voiceless women outside the purview of the beautiful and powerful desiring subjects of the court have a necessary function in its very production/construction. Like the courtier, these women are professionals who rely on skill and knowledge to fulfill their professional duties. The first of those listed, the doctor, cupper, the thief, the hawker, and the hairdresser, are women whose work brings them into contact with many people. Given the messenger’s duty to exchange verse and crafted prose between the lovers, it makes sense that Ibn Hazm also includes the nai’ha [professional mourner], mughniyya [songstress], kahina [diviner], mu‘allima [instructress], and mustakhiffa [entertainer]—all women whose professions entail a certain level of linguistic and poetic ability. The songstress and the entertainer recall their courtly counterparts, the so-called slave woman (jariya, plural jawari), or in cases in which the woman was especially trained as a poet and musician, the “singing slave women” (qayna, plural qiyan). Both songstresses and entertainers seemingly have some of the same professional skills as the qiyan, but unlike the slaves, they presumably received a salary for their skills and performance. The knowledge of these workingwomen, like that of the courtiers, can be used as cultural capital to fulfill their own desires. Unlike the professional women mentioned only once by Ibn Hazm in The Dove’s Neck Ring, slave women, both jawari and qiyan, figure prominently in Ibn Hazm’s tales as both lovers and beloveds and are mentioned often.45 The Dove’s Neck Ring is teeming with accounts of the relations between aristocrats, courtiers, and slave women.46 Having relations with\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n27\n\nthese women was part of Andalusi court culture and was not uncommon for men of the upper classes who felt such relations had certain advantages over marriage: “The natural outlet for extramarital relations was concubinage with a slave girl, which, in Islam was perfectly legal. The Christian and Jewish minorities had some difficulty in keeping this disturbance of family life away from their communities. Choosing a female according to one’s own taste and to have complete disposition of her could be preferable to a wife selected for the future husband by others and who was constantly watched and protected by her family.”47 And though there may have been no religious prohibition against concubinage with female slaves, relations with them did prove problematic, not only because they were domestic intruders but also because they were often ethnically, linguistically, and religiously different: To differences of nature were added differences of culture. All these concubines were of different races, ethnic groups, and “styles”: African, Sudanese, European, Iranian, Indian, Asiatic, Slav. . .Educated in the manners of their own countries, they brought with them an exotic perfume of eroticism and contributed to the acculturation at the base, so to speak. Under the Ommayads and above all under the ‘Abbasids, the value of a concubine increased with her beauty, but also with her “skill,” her good manners, her poetic gifts, her talent as a dancer or singer.48\n\nThese slaves may have brought native customs with them, but they also were quick to adopt those of their Arab owners, and their mastery of certain aspects of Arabic culture such as poetry and music determined their value and was part of their appeal.49 The education the slave women received, and which was part of their sex appeal, further distinguished them from free Arab women, wives, and sisters, who were usually not only segregated from the company of men, but also left uneducated, or perhaps, at best, given some religious lessons. “[T]he jawari were seen as a means of entertaining men. So those who exploited the jawari took it upon themselves to refine these entertainments in accordance with the demands of consumers. And since the jariya was all the more able to conquer men’s hearts in that she was skilled in letter writing (adiba), music and poetry, no effort was spared to satisfy this demand.”50 Such literary skills as described here—adiba, music, and poetry—will characterize the slave women represented in the fictional works examined in the following chapters of Representing Others, and show these slave women as pertaining to the same literary world as the courtiers. Their training and prevalence in Andalusi courts also reflects the constructed nature of the object of desire.\n\n28\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nAn even more detailed account of the nature of the skills taught to these Andalusi slave women, as well as insights into their method of training, is found in the Andalusi author Al-Tifashi’s treatise, Muta‘at al-Asma‘ fi ‘ilm al-sama‘ (Pleasure to the Ears, on the Art of Music): Today, this form of singing is especially prevalent, among Andalusian cities, in Seville, where there are expert old women who teach singing to slave girls they own, as well as to salaried half-Arab female servants of theirs. The [slave girls] are sold from Seville to all the kings of the Maghrib and Ifriqiya, and each of those slave girls is sold for one thousand Maghribi dinars; either more or less, according to her singing, not [for the beauty of] her face. She is never sold without an accompanying register containing all [of the songs] she has memorized, most of which consist, essentially, of those poems we have mentioned. Among them are rapid poems suitable for a beginning, and slow poems which experts in the art of music sing only at the end. . . For this reason, those [slave girls] are, among [Andalusians], sold with a warranty, the absence of which necessarily lowers the price of the sale. Among them, a singing girl is required to have an elegant handwriting, and to display what she has memorized to one who can certify to her mastery of the Arabic language. Her buyer reads what is in the register and shows her whatever part of it he wishes, whereupon she will sing it to the instrument specified in her sale. Sometimes she is an expert in all instruments, and in all kinds of dance and shadow play, and comes with her instrument, along with [an entourage of] slave girls to beat the drum and play the reed for her.51\n\nThe slaves that populate the pages of The Dove’s Neck Ring are often portrayed as this type of educated woman conversant in Arabic literature and capable of composing courtly poetry.52 And as in The Dove’s Neck Ring, in al-Tifashi’s account (as in the other narratives examined in subsequent chapters), wherever we find the singing slave woman we find the Andalusi go-between. In the above passage we discover that in Andalusi Seville old women owned and trained slave girls. Once the girls had been trained in singing and music, these old women seem to have resold the women for a profit. These slave women who al-Tifashi describes as trained in the culture of the court and who Ibn Hazm includes as participants in courtly love affairs exemplify the intersection of the discourse of courtly love and the discourse of Andalusi power. The slave women and courtiers were moving in the same courtly world and using the same courtly language to forge relationships. The system and language of love described and proscribed by Ibn Hazm, product in part of his own personal history in al-Andalus, was used in the courts for both beloveds and rulers, blurring the distinction between the social and the political relationship. In the Andalusi world of courtly\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n29\n\nlove constructed in Ibn Hazm’s treatise, however, jawari and qiyan are common, whereas there is only a single mention of these other professional women who mediate for them. The slave women had mastered the codes of love just as the courtiers did, but they could not profit to the degree that the courtiers did—still being subject to the vagaries of their owner’s fates and/or desires. The professional singers and entertainers that Ibn Hazm mentions in chapter 11 of his treatise, however, although most likely trained in the same adab as the slaves, can make a profit from their knowledge and can be more than simply beloved/desired object—they can act as go-betweens in the courtly production and performance of love. The go-between could also, as al-Tifashi’s text quoted above illustrates, actually traffic in more than just cultural capital. The old women of Seville worked as slave traders, trafficking in the very women Ibn Hazm uses to populate his Andalusi court. The professional songstresses and instructresses described by Ibn Hazm may in fact be a description of these slave traders who trained women to sing and memorize poetry in order to get a better price for them. This manipulation of the in-between spaces between public and private, between the court and the commercial life of the Andalusi street, and between the refined love of the court and the ugly reality of the Andalusi sex trade, may explain Ibn Hazm’s reluctance to include more about these professional women. The commercial relationship between gobetween and beloved does not figure in Ibn Hazm’s treatise on love. Where the jawari and go-betweens that enable courtly desire come from is not important for Ibn Hazm, and, in fact, cannot be discussed without causing the whole structure/performance of desire to unravel. Ibn Hazm, while recognizing the existence of these women and their professional activities on the margins, does not elaborate, focusing instead on the female slaves within the court who were appropriate objects of desire because of their welldefined role as slaves and because of their elaborate training in adab. Conclusion Ibn Hazm’s chapter on the messenger gives us a brief glimpse beyond the world of the Andalusi court—a glimpse out onto the streets of Cordoba and a glimpse back, to the Cordoba of Ibn Hazm’s youth. In this chapter Ibn Hazm subtly acknowledges the tenuous nature of his constructed site of love. Ibn Hazm simultaneously incorporates the uncourtly old women of the streets of his youth into the courtly adab of the Andalusi caliphate, as well as inscribing the go-between into the philosophical discourse of man’s ethical decision-making. The old women of Cordoba briefly break into this most refined and elaborate of courtly treatises. In fact, Ibn Hazm acknowledges the centrality of their role, claiming they are essential to the\n\n30\n\nREPRESENTING OTHERS\n\nwhole performance of love. However, their uncourtly reality—their services rendered in exchange for money—destabilize the courtly love and identity Ibn Hazm is so diligently constructing. These go-betweens are the Achilles heel of courtly desire. By stipulating that lovers must use go-betweens, Ibn Hazm admits an independent desiring subject into the most intimate of relations and assures that the desires and needs of the lover will always be subject to perversions. The go-between will always have the potential to control both lover and beloved. In the eleventh-century taifa courts of al-Andalus, love and the poetry of love continued to be the focus of courtly culture and to serve as the discourse of power. Ibn Hazm’s treatise on love is also a treatise on power. The ideal lovers are Ibn Hazm’s model Andalusis. Many of the examples offered in the work actually are his Andalusi friends—some living, some dead. The Dove’s Neck Ring is, in a sense, a work of mediation, an embodiment of the ideal messenger described in his chapter on the go-between. The work is designed to faithfully mediate between the now lost but not forgotten Umayyad dynasty and its ‘Amirid continuators—the Cordoba of Ibn Hazm’s youth, recreated and reimagined in the personal anecdotes of its now lost inhabitants and out of which the work is woven—and the future al-Andalus, no less imaginary than the Umayyad past. By reimagining the past, Ibn Hazm is providing a model for the future. He dismisses the older ‘Abbasid models, the traditional glories of Arabic language and tradition (the Bedouin, their tales and their mounts), for the Andalusis have their own traditions, their own stories. His treatise on love is not merely mimetic—it is not an imitation of Eastern treatises on love. The Umayyad caliphs and ‘Amirid usurpers of al-Andalus and their courts, the model lovers he names in the introduction, will be the new locations of culture for al-Andalus, their new center. The Andalusi go-betweens, like the Andalusi courtiers, functioned to make this love—this national identity— work. The lover, like the sovereign, had to make moral decisions, to choose between right and wrong. But he also had to hope that his go-between/ courtier was one of the just (an Ibn Hazm, for example) and not one led by Iblis. Once Ibn Hazm has opened up a space for the go-between in his world/text, in the court and in the lover’s intellect, she negotiates with and constructs for him the objects of his desire. Her activity, this production of meaning/channeling of desire, engages the very forces of good and evil behind that desire. Unfortunately neither the past nor the future was as ideal as Ibn Hazm envisioned. As al-Andalus fragmented into a multiplicity of taifa courts, several local and often conflicting Andalusi identities arose. Mediation, the courtier, and the love lyric—the core components of The Dove’s Neck Ring—however, remain central in the fragmentary new Andalusi courts.\n\nPALACES OF MEMORY\n\n31\n\nThe works examined in the subsequent chapters continue to explore what happens when the negotiation of love breaks down and the uncourtly world of the Andalusi street begins to infiltrate the refined atmosphere of the court. In chapter 2 we examine how a twelfth-century Andalusi author, ibn al-Ashtarkuwi al-Saraqusti, takes up the motifs of the slave woman and the go-between and uses them to destabilize further the Andalusi discourse of love/power. The maqamat that are the subject of chapter 2 address this fragmentary al-Andalus, and unlike Ibn Hazm, whose reimagined Umayyad past gave him a relatively fixed point from which to order his poetry and prose, al-Saraqusti provides us with nothing fixed, nothing sure. His go-between does not mediate, she tricks, and in the end we are not even sure she really existed at all.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER 2 “MANY A ZAYD AND ‘AMR”: MEDIATION AND REPRESENTATION IN AL-ANDALUS\n\nIt was forbidden to a Muslim to take delight in hearing the melodious voice of a strange woman, because the first look would be made at you and the second against you. —Ibn Hazm, The Dove’s Neck Ring\n\nhe go-between reemerges in Iberian letters some hundred years after Ibn Hazm created a space for her in the Andalusi courtly discourse of love elaborated in the Dove’s Neck Ring. The taifa courts, the inheritors of Umayyad splendor and culture, were in their infancy as Ibn Hazm was composing The Dove’s Neck Ring, but by the end of the eleventh century they have fallen to the Berber Almoravids. Unlike Ibn Hazm, whose Dove’s Neck Ring reflects a hopeful attitude that Andalusi caliphal splendor might be restored, Abu l-Tahir Muhammad al-Saraqusti, al-Andalusi, Ibn alAshtarkuwi (d. 1143) (al-Saraqusti) turns a critical eye to Andalusi splendor and its legacy—the literature of Andalusi Arab identity—exposing this cultural model as an illusion no longer viable in a changed Iberian cultural landscape. Mediation and mediators figure prominently in al-Saraqusti’s collection of fifty brief narratives, the Maqamat al-luzumiyah, both as characters within the narrative and in the very literary form he has chosen for such representation, the maqamat, which itself is defined by formal and stylistic conjuncture (discussed in detail below). In her new context the gobetween is no longer part of a codified courtly discourse. The go-between and the rhymed prose with which she was created have been displaced from the caliphal court and now begin to roam in a new Andalusi landscape, that of al-Saraqusti’s maqamat. In “Maqama 9” we witness as she\n\nT\n\n34\n\nREPRESENTING OTH"
