        "text": "Through this article we are going to delve into a historical epoch that most of us know superficially, Al-Andalus. Many of us have seen on televisión, or had the opportunity to travel to Spain and visit the Alhambra in Granada, the mosque in Cordoba or the Giralda in Seville, but few of us know details of this historical period. Javier Albarrán brings us closer to the Islamic world that erected these magnificent buildings, from the arrival of the Muslims to the Iberian Peninsula, to the influence that has survived until today. He clarifies the reasons for their arrival on the peninsula, and helps us to distinguish between what really is history and what has become a legend. Javier Albarrán paints some brush strokes about the relationship of the Islamic world with the medieval Europe of the time; the relationship with the peninsular Christian world; the controversial issue of whether or not there was a Reconquest; and finally, whether the Andalusian legacy can be used to build bridges between the Western world and the Islamic world of today.\n\nInternational diplomacy was an important phenomenon in the history of Islam with the states they established in both the eastern and western territories. Th e archaeological records of the Andalusian Umayyad State, which was established in the Iberian Peninsula as a continuation of the Umayyad dynasty who could not survive in Syria not only sheds light on the flamboyant Islamic history in this region, but also reveals the eff ective role of the diplomacy channel and the caliphate position in this diplomacy of its period. Abd al-Rahman III, the fi rst caliph of the Iberian Peninsula (891-961), after years of Islamic domination in Andalusia, stabilized his power politically and militarily in the Iberian Peninsula. He was recognized for his strong management and successful initiatives in international relations. Abd al-Rahman III transformed the emirate of Andalusia into a caliphate, he became the fi rst administrative to receive the title of the caliph in Andalusia. With its half-century domination, he left very important cultural and political footprints in the Iberian Peninsula. As a Caliphal construction of Abd al-Rahman III, the city of Medina’al Zahra in Córdoba was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018. In this study, how caliphal image was created will be investigated through archeological evidences in Andalusia.\n\nBy considering the building regulations of medieval Christian societies of the Iberian Peninsula with the ones contained in Islamic sources from al-Andalus, it is possible to verify how much the former were influenced by the latter. This legacy is, indeed, evident in the official responsible for applying these rules, whose purpose was to control various urban areas. In fact, the Portuguese almotacé, the Castilian almotacén or the Aragonese mustaçaf derive from the Islamic muḥtasib, which in turn has an ancient and complex history, as an authentic product of the Mediterranean. The transformation in medieval Christian building rules and their transmission to non-European territories, which have been in force for much longer, truly certify the evolution of an Islamic institution as a transtemporal and transcultural phenomenon.\n\nHow do Islamic art survey texts present the architecture of the Islamic West, and how does this presentation shape the perception of the Maghrib in university classrooms? Examining the Great Mosque of Qayrawān and the Great Mosque of Cordoba as they appear in four representative and widely used art history survey texts, this article argues that a common art historical narrative characterises the art of early medieval North Africa as ultimately derivative of and artistically inferior to the art of early Islamic Iraq, Egypt, and the Iberian Peninsula. The article points to a shared chronological moment, which witnessed the expansion of the Cordoba prayer hall during the reign of ‘Abd al-Raḥmān II and several building projects undertaken around the same time by the Aghlabid emirs of Ifrīqiya. Examining these two building programmes in relation to one another leads to different conclusions about these monuments of the Islamic West than are offered in the art history texts, which privilege formalist readings. The article proposes the utility of a pan-Straits approach emphasising specific contexts (historical, political, religious, social, and artistic) within the Islamic West in addressing the problematic issues raised by this narrative. Such an approach, especially if combined with critical studies of the colonial structures that informed early scholarship on the Islamic West, may offer a means for the discipline to re-evaluate the place of the Maghrib in the larger history of Islamic art. It may also provide a means to move beyond problematic inherited discourses of Islamic art history and its canon."
