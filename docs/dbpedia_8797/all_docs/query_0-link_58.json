The “power of identity,” to use the title of the second volume of the study of “The Informacion Age” by socio­logist Manuel Castells,1 has been strongly emphasized during the last decades. Different studies have been devoted to analyze the search for identity in our plural societies, the intertwining of various types and levels of identity, the risks around identity conflicts and, in any case, the rise of identity, with its different meanings, in the articulation of current society.2 Too often history has been used to justify real, recreated, or imagined identities. This is not our aim. Noticing the search for identity in individuals and collectivities throughout history, and looking for new perspectives to reach the core of precedent societies, we adopt identity as an object of analysis, that is, as a challenge to open new ways and tools for historians’ work. Certainly, this book places identity at the centre of a project to better understand medi­eval society. By exploring the multiplicity of personal identities, the ways these were expressed within particular social structures (such as feudalism), and their evolution into formal expressions of collective identity (municipalities, guilds, nations, and so on) we can shed new light on the Middle Ages. A specific legacy of such developments was that by the end of the Middle Ages, a different sense of collective identities, supported by the late medi­eval socio-economic structure, backed in law and by theo­logical, philosophical, and political thought, defined society. What is more, social structures coalesced across diverse elements, including language, group solidarities, and a set of assumed values. We understand that identity occupied that central position in defining medi­eval society with two allied concepts: memory and ideo­logy. The former served to ground identity, while the latter consolidated a coherent common memory and identity. For this reason, this book has two companions devoted to each of these concepts. We think that 1 Manuel Castells, The Information Age.

This holistic vision requires interdisciplinary approaches, as opposed to academic compartmentalization of history, art history, and the study of languages and literatures. With this in mind, we present a work structured in a particular way, beginning with a long introductory chapter (by Flocel Sabaté) on medi­eval identity. This introduction does not aim to map out identity in its entirety, but rather to provide insights into key aspects of the medi­eval understandings of identity. It frames ensuing discussions by exploring the various ways in which individuals affirmed their notion of identity, always involving the individual’s relation to a group with which they felt solidarity. A sense of one’s own identity involves notions of otherness, and therefore involves both external perceptions and an internal sensibility, and relates to ideas concerning “representativity” (the conditions of a representation, from the French word représentativité). In the Middle Ages, this generated various discourses and cultural displays in order to support particular identities, which generated specific collectively-held memories and descriptions of teleo­logical destiny, associated with particular societies and territories. Having established an overview of identity in the Middle Ages, the introduction is followed by twenty-one focused chapters by leading researchers which delve deeper into specific fields. They share a concern for illuminating medi­eval thought, focusing on concrete cases, and prioritizing examples from southern Europe, a region with a large amount of documentation, but which to date has occupied a relatively minor position in the overall spread of research into the Middle Ages. We acknowledge this emphasis in the title of this book, Identity in the Middle Ages: Approaches from Southwestern Europe, which is offered as a means of enriching study of the Middle Ages. The resulting chapters are organized into four domains representing the four parts in the book, offering, in our view, useful ways of exploring identity. The overall concept is part of a long historio­graphical journey, linked particularly to the return of cultural history in the search for new perspectives with which to develop historical research. That is why we invited Jaume Aurell to launch this volume with an overview of this historio­graphical development. Having provided the historio­graphical framework, we delve deeper into the function of identity in the Middle Ages through four blocks we consider axial: constructing individual identity; social identity; identity and territory; and forms of collective identity. Constructing individual identity is, in fact, one of the vital contributions of the Middle Ages, by defining the individual elements that allow a person to define himself or herself, and this continues today. For instance, adopting a name seems crucial in the perception and assumption of individuality. Igor Filippov provides here a fascinating study of baptismal names and self-identification in the Early Middle Ages. Moisés Selfa goes on to show how names reflect a specific identity in a particular social context. Ana Maria S. A. Rodrigues then shows how the personal identity that one accepts is fundamentally linked to the cultural model of gender. She presents varying degrees of acceptance, by different women, of specific ideals of femininities. At the same time, the awareness of one’s individuality, the struggle between individual and group, was evident for instance in twelfth-century literature, where shared memories might include autobio­graphical\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nexpressions, as Meritxell Simó shows. The assumption of an identity means the integration of a memory, and Maribel Fierro shows, in Islamic society, how this implies specific religious and legal values. Society supplies models into which individuality can fit, but it can also offer space for exceptions, as in the case of eunuchs in Islamic society, as shown in the chapter by Cristina de la Puente. People were never alone in the Middle Ages. They formed part of a group in which they felt integrated and protected. We therefore need to consider identity in terms of the social group. Given that the rules for social order were based on the majority religion, it was necessary to adopt specific status for minorities when Christians, Jews and Muslims shared a same space, as John Tolan analyzes. At the same time, social identity requires us to understand that appropriate models were generated for each social group. Paul H. Freedman shows us how a specific image of the peasant was created in line with the values of medi­eval society, and accepted by the members of that social group. At the same time, at the other social extreme, a clear chivalric identity was formulated, well enough assumed to be widely reflected in contemporary texts, as Noel Fallows demonstrates. And Flocel Sabaté sketches how the Late Middle Ages supplied the economic, ideo­logical, and cultural framework that gave rise to a specifically bourgeois identity. Social order was achieved by combining these units of collective identity. Conversely, we see these marks of identity in social outcasts in the chapter by Ricardo Córdoba that concludes the second part of this volume. Human activity takes place in a determined space, over which mutual influence is developed. Strong relations between people, territory, and identity arise almost naturally. Hence the third part of this book focuses on identity and territory at different levels: firstly, in the smaller space in which everyday life happens, as Raquel Torres shows when analyzing how medi­eval parishes supported individuals in forming a local community. We see another field for social identity within the lordships, a setting in which José Ramon Díaz de Durana and Arsenio Dacosta show us the rise and consolidation of factions (bandos) from lineage, with their solidarity connections. They were a powerful form of mutual identity, which became very complex and affected all relations, either with other powers or the sovereign, and determined the management of the territory and society. Another very different scenario is derived from the political will to promote identification between territory, population, and certain rulers. This led to interesting discourses in which a common identity tried to fashion a specific memory, as Luciano Gallinari shows for Sardinia. Also in Sardinia, Alessandra Cioppi presents the changes it underwent after its incorporation into the Crown of Aragon: the shaping of a specific identity through the implantation of a particular institutional model. Finally, the Late Middle Ages furnished identities based on representativeness, so much so that it is one of the great legacies of medi­eval society. The rise of the urban patriciate was accompanied by the promotion of a specific identification between the ruling elite, municipal government, and city, as Yolanda Guerrero demonstrates. The increasing assertiveness of cities gave them a dominant position over the surrounding territory and the ability to manage their own resources, not least through taxation. José Antonio Jara shows us how a city could portray a unifying discourse to reinforce its dominant position, which in turn meant the generation of a shared identity. Urban\n\nxii\n\nForeword\n\npower not only assumed a representativeness with which it could address the sovereign on behalf of the municipality, but this in turn affected the profile of sovereignty itself. Thus, urban identity helped model a specific definition of the country, apart from the sovereign, and became a counterpoint in defining a duality between the country and the monarch (a distinction, as Eloísa Ramírez presents, in the case of Navarre, that came to be made between the Kingdom proper and the King). In this framework, the construction of an identity for citizenship needed specific rituals, festivals, and symbols. Shared urban self-expression facilitated social cohesion within a common identity, as outlined in Paola Ventrone’s chapter. The cities then went on to strengthen an identity based on their own social cohesion and projected this over their hinterlands. As a result, urban identity could adopt a social, political, and even the sense of being a “state,” as Giorgio Chittolini shows from cases in central and northern Italy. These are the various of lines of enquiry on the theme of identity in the Middle Ages that have occupied the work of the Consolidated Medi­eval Studies Research Group “Space, Power and Culture,” based at the Uni­ver­sity of Lleida, especially through the research project Identity, Memory and Ideo­logy in the Middle Ages (HAR2009–08598/ HIST) financed by the Spanish government, to link the study of identity, memory, and ideo­logy in the Middle Ages. It was a challenge taken up from an earlier project: Historical Memory: Images of the Middle Ages. The Real World and Recreated Space (BHA2003–00523). Both projects aimed to advance new perspectives on the study of the Middle Ages. Close collaboration with the Institute for Research into Identities and Society (IRIS), based at the Uni­ver­sity of Lleida between 2009 and 2013, worked towards the same objective. The work of its research team and numerous wider scholarly meetings held at Lleida helped to consolidate these objectives. This was also made possible with the support of various complementary projects financed by the Spanish Ministry of Research: Identities (HAR2008–02766–E/HIST); Sacred Voices (FFI2008–03031–E/ FILO); Identities: A Definition (HAR2010–10915–E/HIST); Identities: Definition and Context: A Multidisciplinary Approach (HAR2010–10803–E/HIST); and Hybrid Identities: An Interdisciplinary Vision of the Social World (HAR2011–13084–E). Thanks to these projects, various co-authored books on the subject of identity in the Middle Ages have appeared, bringing together the work of leading researchers from varied fields of study related to the Middle Ages.3 This book builds on prior studies and is, to a large extent, a culmination of the work done previously.

He lies in wait for the beasts in the woods, killing them, and then eating the venison raw. Thus he dwelt in the forest like a madman or a savage, until he came upon a little, low-lying house belonging to a hermit, who was at work clearing his ground. When he saw him coming with nothing on, he could easily perceive that he was not in his right mind; and such was the case, as the hermit very well knew.1\n\nAccording to the twelfth-century tale by Chrétien de Troyes, the knight Yvain lived wild in the forest, naked, killing animals, and eating raw meat because he did not remember any of his previous acts and had gone mad. So, eating uncooked meat and going without clothes demonstrated behaviour inappropriate for a mentally healthy human being, and if someone adopted this behaviour it was because he had forgotten everything he had done throughout his life and had lost awareness of who he was. He would only revert to behaviour considered normal when he regained the knowledge of who he was, in other words, when he returned to his identity. The starting point is thus the individual’s own identity.\n\nIdentity of the Individual\n\nThe core of the medi­eval human being was thus identity; being aware of who one was and where one came from and so be able to adopt adequate behaviour and determine a future path in one’s life. Does this suppose an awareness of the individual in itself? It is highly significant that historians do not agree on the elements that indicate an assumption of an individual identity. In fact, there is a whole series of elements that, taken * This study focuses on the medi­eval West, without going into the analysis of societies and cultures like the Muslim or Jewish that, precisely given their importance, require specific treatment.\n\n1 “Porqant mes ne li sovenoit / De rien que onques e’st feite. / Les bestes par le bois agueite, / Si les ocit; et se manjue / La venison trestote crue. / Et tant conversa el boschage, / Com hom forsenez et salvage, / C’une meison a .i. hermite / Trova, mout basse et mout petite; / Et li hermites essartoit. / Quant vit celui qui nuz estoit, / Bien pot savoir, sanz nul redot, / Qu’il n’ert mie an son san del tot.” Cited from Chrétien de Troyes, Le chevalier au lion, MS H. vv. 2822–34, accessed July 28, 2013, http://www.uottawa.ca/academic/arts/lfa/activities/textes/chevalier-au-lion/NouvPres/A/ H2681-3334.html.

Firstly, there was the spread of Roman law around Europe in the twelfth century,3 arising from an academic artificiality that guaranteed it would be balanced and fair,4 and this supplied a homogenizing legal basis adaptable to every reality. This set out the legal elements for each unique individual, with his rights, duties, and responsibilities, under relevant legislative bodies, whilst not forgetting, at a lower level, the customs based on the “consent of the individuals themselves.”5 This legal approach forms part of the renewal movement that has become known as a twelfth-century “renaissance”6 and undoubtedly accentuated a perception of the individual, not as a rupture but rather as a development of earlier elements. That is why Nico den Bok insisted that the twelfth century witnessed the seed planted by Boethius in the sixth century come to fruition;7 we should add, though, with Chad Schrock, that the first step was settled by Augustine linking Christianity to a Neoplatonic ecstatic vision through which to reach personal consolation.8 At the same time, it is easy to see the link to the notion of person in Roman law and religion, from where it would easily pass into Christian theo­logy, as highlighted by José Maria Ribas.9 In any case, following Aron Gurevich, the path had already been signposted at the end of the eleventh century through both didactic exempla about experiences and allusions to one’s own knowledge.10 Colin Morris, too, situated a veritable “discovery of the individual” between 1050 and 1200, on the grounds that it was the moment when different aspects of culture and religion emphasized an interior perspective (Know Yourself was the title of a book by Peter Abelard) and the concern for self-awareness (“confession”), intimate feelings (affectio), their shared expression (friendship and love in the troubadours), and personal knowledge (“the portrait”). Likewise, at this period, religion focused on the person of Christ (“the Church was at pains to involve the people in the re-enactment of the cen2 Larry Siedentop presents an even longer evolution, from Antiquity to the Renaissance: Larry Siedentop, Inventing the Individual.

As César Raña notes, that would explain why, in the twelfth century, demands like those contained in penitentials reflected a concept of individual responsi11 Colin Morris, The Discovery of the Individual, 1050–1200 (New York, 1972), 96–157. 12 Peter Dronke, Poetic Individuality in the Middle Ages (Oxford, 1970).\n\n13 Robert W.

Very significantly, the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 imposed the obligation of annual confession on each Christian, a measure that both showed and encouraged the acceptance of a fully individual awareness of one’s acts and behaviour.22 In this sense, the Church’s desire for control and tutelage inherent in this measure provoked, in turn, a greater autonomy for individuals, because, to assume the duty imposed, they had to be responsible for their own acts, careful, and self-aware.23 This theo­logical development in the thirteenth century had a direct impact on the definition of the person as a unique individual, who had to take decisions in line with their own consciences and be responsible, in all its effects, for their actions. This was the conceptual maturity that became, in the words of Alain de Libera, “the epistemic basis on which the theory of man as the subject–agent of thought gradually formed.”24 Realism, culminating in the philosophy and theo­logy of Thomas Aquinas, defined the person, in their uniqueness and responsibility, a culmination of a line of Christian thought from the patristic era and Boethius,25 but one that also integrated the work of Aristotle and Averroes. 21 César Raña, “‘Scito te ipsum.’ La responsabilidad individual y los penitenciales del siglo XII,” Revista Española de Filosofía Medi­eval 18 (2011): 69–80.\n\n22 “All chrono­logies aimed at secondary school students should give great importance to the decision of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) that made annual confession obligatory.

St. Anselm, Alexander of Hales, St. Albert the Great and St. Bonaventure, among others, distinguished the person from mere nature and emphasized personal properties, like unity, singularity, incommunicability, dignity, substantiality, and rationality. However, the first to concern himself directly with the metaphysical basis of the person in his entity and dignity was Aquinas. He stands out among all the medi­eval writers for his speculative construction of a doctrine about the person, that synthesizes and continues earlier ones” (Los grandes escolásticos medi­evales, siguiendo la tradición de la filosofí�a cristiana y especialmente el pensamiento de San Agustí�n y de Boecio, trataron la problemática de la persona, especialmente al ocuparse del misterio de Cristo, el Hombre-Dios. San Anselmo, Alejandro de Hales, San Alberto Magno y San Buenaventura, entre otros, al distinguir la persona de la mera naturaleza insistieron en las propiedades personales, como la unidad, la singularidad, la incomunicabilidad, la dignidad, la substancialidad y la racionalidad. Sin embargo, el primero\n\nThis led to:\n\nIdentity in the Middle Ages\n\n5\n\nthe concept of the person with whom all the theo­logical and philosophical tradition has continued to explain since then: an individual substance of a rational nature, having control of his actions (dominium sui actus), who is not simply acting like the others, but by himself, because actions are in the singular.26\n\nThe predominance from the thirteenth century of an explanation of religion and the world based on Aristotelian realism continued and, so, according to Aristotle’s hylomorphism, each individual being (ousia) was conceived as a compound of matter and form.27 The full integration of the body and soul of each individual,28 uniting gesture and appearance,29 assumes individual uniqueness, equally expressed in all cultural aspects.30 François-Xavier Putallaz describes the awakening of the individual: “Late thirteenthcentury philosophies all converged on the sense of an irresistible increase of the notion of individuality.”31 This convergence brings together Aristotelian Scholastic Thomism with its opponent, the spiritualism promoted especially by Franciscan authors who aimed at direct knowledge of the soul for themselves, without philosophical intermediaries considered alien to the Christian spirit.32 Concern for spiritual paths to knowledge led to the perception of one’s own individuality with inherent capacity and responsibility. Late medi­eval mysticism has been defined as a personal interior search33 and the religious approaches at the end of the Middle Ages, built around the Devotio Moderna, emphasized personal responsibility and practice.34 Christian religion of this era adopted personal traits for all aspects: the personal life of saints should be imitated and one que se ocupó propiamente de la fundamentación metafí�sica de la persona en su entidad y dignidad fue Santo Tomás.

It can be seen in literary creation, for example, by Petrarch in the care he took to take responsibility for his texts.41 It is not much different in both aspects of artistic expression: the creator and the portrayed. An artist can be satisfied with his work, although in the Early Middle Ages this valuation was considered little more than a mechanical or manual task of limited value. In contrast, we see increasing recognition, from the end of the eleventh century and more so in the Late Middle Ages, that an artist’s work could be useful for the discourse promoted by the holders of power.42 Daniel Russo explains this by contrast35 Sergi Gascón, “Retrat de Jesucrist en les obres d’Eiximenis,” in Miscel·lània ‘in memoriam’ Alfons Serra-Baldó (1909–1993) en el centenari del seu naixement, ed.

There was a clear will to capture, hold, and display a unique personal image.46 In 1443 in Barcelona, the painter Lluis Dalmau was given instructions to paint with full realism, In correct proportion and measure [...] the image of our Lady, St. Mary sitting in a sumptuous chair with the baby Jesus in her arms [...], the image of the Virgin St. Eulalia patron and unique advocate of the said city taking in her hand the eculeus from her martyrdom [and the] honourable councillors, namely Lord Joan Llull, Lord Francesc Lobet and Lord Joan de Junyent, who have to be represented according to real proportions, and their dress and their respective faces according to those they have.47\n\nEarlier, in the fourteenth century, King Peter IV of Aragon and III of Barcelona (Peter the Ceremonious) had the physical traits of his predecessors investigated in order to reproduce them faithfully, while adapting their clothing to what was supposed to have been worn at the time of the person portrayed.48 These portraits of the dead were designed to endorse the present through historical continuity, emphasizing that individual identity was strengthened when rooted in continuity, in other words, in a present group built on solid precedents. 43 Daniel Russo, “Le nom de l’artiste, entre appurtenance au groupe ete écriture personnelle,” in L’Individu au Moyen Âge, ed.

The Meio di Betto e Benedetto suo figlio, a book started in Italian by a father and continued by his son between 1450 and 1489, is an economic collection from the Tuscan countryside, one that sometimes takes on a descriptive tone but continued and preserved the express wish of the son of the original author.56 More explicit is a Catalan book from the barony of Eramprunyà, written over the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries by members of a lesser noble urban lineage from Barcelona. It includes highly personal details for the record, like the parts written in the fifteenth century about the births and birthdates of children and their godparents, or the testimony of their participation in the civil war in the 1460s.

Attitudes might show an awareness of being accepted but also of what one shared with the family or other individuals of note. However, an individual was not dependent upon sovereign power, unlike those citizens who came to the fore in the French Revolution and were dependent on the state infrastructure in the nineteenth century. The medi­eval individual, by contrast, only made sense inside the group to which he or she belonged.\n\nIdentity and Group Solidarity\n\nIn the early decades of the thirteenth century, King James I of the Crown of Aragon took military action against the Count of Urgell,58 supporting the claims against him by a girl, a minor and orphan, daughter of a previous count. In doing so, he showed no desire to reinforce royal power but rather justified himself claiming that “God wants there to be kings in this world, and established that this office includes an obligation to defend the rights of those in most need and especially widows and orphans.”59 This Christian duty to protect the poor and weak could invoke justifications from the Church Fathers and the need to help fellow Christians,60 although it was really a mechanism to consolidate royal power by extending the sovereign’s protection to those who lacked any other support; in other words, those who fell outside any solidarity group under which they could seek protection. In reality, in the Middle Ages, nobody was alone. Everyone perceived themselves and was perceived by others to be part of a solidarity group. Thus, the warning by Caroline Walker Bynum when she notes that all historio­graphical talk of the rise of individualism from the twelfth century should be understood as a quest to find one’s own peer group.61 Robert Hanning saw an evolution from the individualizing approaches of the twelfth century to the assumption in the thirteenth of elements that would give cohesion to late medi­eval society: 57 Elena Cantarell, Mireia Comas and Carme Muntaner, eds., El llibre de la Baronia d’Eramprunyà (Lleida, 2011).\n\n58 Flocel Sabaté, “Guerau, Conde de Urgel, vizconde de Cabrera (IV) y de Á� ger (III),” in Diccionario Biográfico Español (Madrid, 2011), 24: 824–26. 59 “Déus volc que en est segle fossen reis, e donà.ls-hi, per aquest ofici, que tinguessin dretura a aquells que mester l’haurien, e especialment a ví�dues e a òrfens.” Cited from Jaume I, Crònica o Llibre dels feits, ed.

Moreover, everyone was considered to belong to a family group in both a broad and narrow sense.68 It was through cousinage that the early medi­eval aristocracy was strengthened69 and this continued even when cousinage gave way to agnatic lineage (i.e., through the male bloodline) in the central centuries of the Middle Ages.70 All the rhetoric about what constitutes a good knight, so popular in twelfth- and thirteenth-century literature, 62 Robert W.

The tensions in recognizing emerging local representation facilitated interpretations that are projections of the nineteenth and twentieth-century historians who first studied these phenomena.76 This has hindered the path to understanding them as forms of representativeness and taxation between local elites and their respective lords.77 Developing the Roman ius gentium,78 which led from the twelfth century towards the recognition of municipal government, lords came to accept forms of representation of local groups because these were good interlocutors for demands, especially fiscal ones, from 71 “The theme of the unknown youth prepared to make his name as a knight and to establish a position in society on the basis of his own exploits, without the help of a known and well established familiy reputation, is therefore here combined with a strong emphasis on heredity.” Cited from Elspeth Kennedy, “The Quest for Identity and the Importance of Lineage in Thirteenth-Century French Prose Romance,” in The Ideals and Practice of Medi­eval Knighthood, II: Papers from the Third Strawbery Hill Conference 1986, ed.

Also, grievances against members of the urban entity were responded to collectively. For instance, the clameur d’haro was a call whereby in the case of a flagrant crime a victim demanded help from all the neighbours, and this was really a call for collective mobilization and action.80 Similarly, if the accused fled and took refuge in a jurisdiction different from the one where the crime was committed, the person affected would demand the backing of the group to which he or she belonged, whether an administrative unit or municipal government, from whom they expected to receive the corresponding legal and, if needed, armed support.81 Such collective responses mobilized an urban group together against other jurisdictions, to reclaim, protect, or avenge the rights and common assets of a member of the group. However, each town was fragmented internally into factions, which had a great impact, because the people trusted this more than the official jurisdiction, which was considered slow (thanks to the development of the Romanist system of guarantees), expensive (through the need to have legal support), and subject to political pressures and influences (if an accused had enough money, he could get changes to the law, exemptions, and remissions).82 In this way, group solidarities clashed with the strengthening of sovereign power under Roman legal models, because people came to question and ignore the ordinary administrative officials and the sovereign authority that justified them and even the divine order that backed them. Accordingly, both the sovereign and the Church countered with arguments to justify attempts to limit acts of vengeance between factions and encourage the population to use official channels of justice. They did not hesitate to invoke God’s will and the role of lords and the purpose of their taxes, to defend and offer justice to their subjects. This was explained as follows in the Catalan town of Valls in 1357: This is the reason why the lords are in towns and castles and why taxes are given to them, because they defend their subjects and give justice against wrongdoers. In reality, the world would quickly fall apart if some could take revenge on others without waiting for the lord to do so.83\n\n79 Max Turull, “‘Universitas,’ ‘commune,’ ‘consilium’: Sur le rôle de la fiscalité dans la naissance et le développement du Conseil (Catalogne, XIIe–XIVe siècles),” in Excerptiomes iuris: Studies in Honor of André Gouron, ed.

Accordingly, the municipal and legal authorities encouraged arbitration, truces, and agreements between parties.84 It was easier to agree collective responses with the ordinary courts at another level, so that from the twelfth century, in the case of a denial of justice, legislation envisaged that the victim’s jurisdiction would be able to proceed against anyone from the jurisdiction of the person to blame, either taking action to seize the assets of anyone from the other jurisdiction85 or, in more serious cases, mobilizing the urban militia, which was always formally convened by the holder of the ordinary jurisdiction.86 In reality, this was a way to combine circles of solidarity, on a case-by-case basis: everyone owed allegiance to their feudal lord, and thus participated in a higher allegiance to the sovereign; or you could look to your faction against opponents within the town, whilst all the townspeople could come together against a neighbouring town from another jurisdiction. The scale of group solidarities could be broadened. In the 1280s, the King of France invaded Roussillon, then under the jurisdiction of the king of Mallorca. Some monks living in Argelers but born in France helped the invaders because, as the abbot told the French monarch, “I and those other monks are from your land and are your subjects, so, lord, we would be upset if you returned (to France) having suffered a great dishonour.”87 A decade later, the Catalan–Aragonese monarch invaded the kingdom of Murcia, a territory under the jurisdiction of the king of Castile but repopulated by Castilians and Catalans. The origins of the people there conditioned their attitude to the invasion, as explained in the chronicle of the Castilian King: The king of Aragon with his host moved and went to the kingdom of Murcia and from advice from those who were from there, who were Catalans, handed over all the towns and castles except Lorca, which was inhabited by Castilians, and also Alcalá and Mula.88\n\n84 Flocel Sabaté, “Les factions dans la vie urbaine de la Catalogne du XIVe siècle,” 356–65.\n\n85 Joaquim Miret i Sans, “Les represàlies a Catalunya en l’edat mitjana,” Revista Jurídica de Catalunya, 30, no. 31 (1925): 289–417. 86 Flocel Sabaté, El sometent a la Catalunya medi­eval (Barcelona, 2007).\n\n87 “Jo e aquests altres monges som naturals de vostra terra e naturals vostres, per què, senyor, a nos dolria molt que vós vos en tornassets ab tan gran deshonor.” Cited from Ramon Muntaner, Crónica, ed.

As Genicot has written, at that time, “the nation was, then, a growing sentiment.”89 Francesc Eiximenis, the most influential writer in the Crown of Aragon in the fourteenth century,90 given his access to both the royal court91 and the bourgeois elites,92 compared the Catalan nation with others to praise its excellence, focusing on such mundane aspects as drinking or table manners.93 The nation was based on a sum of everyday cultural traits, that King Peter the Ceremonious of Aragon defined as “our manners,”94 among which a shared language stands out,95 as also done in other places in Europe.96 The perception of the nation existed in the classical sense, which enabled a people to be grouped according to birth. Church Fathers and later authors continued this use: for example, the Venerable Bede in the eighth century identified the Angli or gens Anglorum with “our nation” (nostra natio) and expressed a clear sentiment of belonging, uniqueness, and an ability to describe its features, outlining a historical path from its origin to its destiny, and differentiating it from other neighbouring nations, like the natione Saxonum of inhabitants of Sussex.97 In this way, the nature of each nation could be defined, which is why, in the ninth century, Regino of Prüm explained that each nation had its own language, customs, and laws: “the people of the diverse nations are distinguished from each other by their kind of customs, language and law.”98 Mutual contact facilitated 89 “La nación era, pues, un sentimiento naciente.” Cited from Léopold Génicot, Europa en el siglo XIII (Barcelona, 1976), 130. 90 Antoni Riera, ed., Francesc Eiximenis (c. 1330–1409): el context i l’obra d’un gran pensador català medi­eval (Barcelona, 2015).\n\n91 David J.

In their desire to build a superior position, thirteenth-century monarchs worked to articulate power as a pyramid in which they occupied the vertex in each of their domains. Nations fitted perfectly into this pyramid, as Bernard Guenée stated in the case of France.100 In 1369, Peter the Ceremonious of the Crown of Aragon clearly referred to “loving the nation.”101 In so doing he acknowledged the existence of affective motivations for the people,102 who experienced happiness as a single body for successful events like the first ever appointment of a Catalan cardinal—“to our honour and that of our nation.”103 Such a group was prepared even to shed its blood, as a nation, in loyally following the king, as the Catalan bishop Joan Margarit expressed it in the fifteenth century.104 However, in this medi­eval approach to power, the sovereign liked to rule over multiple nations: witness Ferdinand II of Aragon and V of Castile at the end of the Middle Ages,105 or the way the German Empire was very clearly defined in 1356: “The Sublime Sacred Roman Empire has diverse nations, with distinct customs, life and languages, and governments to be controlled.”106 99 Benoî�t Grévin, “Les stéréotypes ‘nationaux.’.

In scholarly discourse, the medi­eval nation could be ignored while believing that “the medi­eval mind did not think in terms of the ‘nation’ and ‘nationalism.’”111 In fact nineteenth-century discourses of national cohesion112 granted a specific113 and essentialist sense114 to a pre-existing reality with a sense that was more descriptive and collective than determinist.115 In the eighteenth century, Rousseau called for society to be based on this reality because he understood it to be more natural to build social cohesion around belonging to a group with similar traits than on alternatives such as dynasties.116 It could not be otherwise if we appreciate the role of collectives in the Ancien régime: whether guilds,117 participatory municipal governments justified by a sense of universitas,118 social constructions to manage the different estates, such as the parlia107 “It is surprising to see such an essentialist and reified notion of the cohesion of Catalan national identity in the thirteenth and fourteeth centuries.” Saúl Martí�nez Bermejo, “Review: Flocel Sabaté and Luis Adâo Fonseca, eds., ‘Catalonia and Portugal: The Iberian Peninsula from the Periphery,’” European History Quaterly 47, no. 1 (2017): 135. 108 Eric Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism since 1780.

The medi­eval concept of community was at the base of the social structure126 and the identity of the individual only made sense within their respective group. As Janet Coleman has emphasized, seventeenth and eighteenth-century thinkers looked to their roots in medi­eval thought when establishing the equation between the “Individual and the Medi­eval State.”127 However, in fact, the medi­eval perception was far from a political community as an agreement by individuals, as was generally repeated after 119 Bertie Wilkinson, The Creation of Medi­eval Parliaments (New York, 1972), 59–109.\n\n120 Antony Black, El pensamiento politico en Europa 1250–1450 (Cam­bridge, 1996), 130–297.\n\n121 Michel Hébert, Parlementer.

That is why Alain Boureau remarked: In the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, one can see a remarkable development of systems of individuation, which at the same time and in a single action establish the status of the individual and of the community.130\n\nBoureau’s observation explains how municipal governments could justify themselves in function of the common good.131 This was backed by legal,132 political,133 philosophical,134 and theo­logical reasoning,135 all showing the ideal society as a collective with a pretence of harmony. Notably, the late medi­eval celestial paradise was no longer imagined as a kind of Garden of Eden but rather as an idealized city.136 In this same line, proposals for ideal—utopian—cities flourished and took shape at the end of the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance137 either as a theoretical proposal or as an experiment in the New World.138 They testify to a conception of collective social identity, where the individual only made sense in the group to which he or she belonged.139 In the Middle Ages, identity was, to a great extent, collective, but that does not contradict the perception and worth accorded to the individual, because the latter accepted his or her responsibilities within a collectively assumed framework.

The profile of the group defined one’s limits, always porous but sufficiently clear to mark the bounds of the collective identity. In other words, the assumption of a collective identity also meant recognizing otherness.\n\nIdentity and Otherness\n\nThe earlier reference to “our manners” as a synonym of “our nation” by King Peter the Ceremonious of the Crown of Aragon in 1369140 implied a set of features of the shared identity, defining implicitly or explicitly the “manners” that characterized those who did not belong to the group: in other words, the Other. The perception of otherness forms an intrinsic part of the definition of one’s identity. To identify oneself against other ways of doing things means being different. It is a characteristic that can even encourage curiosity. At the end of the fourteenth century, when Viscount Ramon de Perellós narrated his journey to St. Patrick’s Purgatory, entering by Station Island on Lough Derg in County Donegal, he wanted to explain how the Irish lived, precisely because their customs and manners were so different and therefore surprising: “Given that their customs and manners are very strange for us, I will tell you, as briefly as I can, something of their characteristics and manners from what I have seen.”141 Similarly, journeys to the East supposed the draw of getting to know surprising places, such as the famous journeys by Marco Polo or William of Rubruck. The latter accepted a commission from Louis IX of France in 1253 to travel to the Orient, invoking a biblical charge: “In Ecclesiasticus it is written about the Wise Man: ‘He travels among the peoples of foreign lands.’”142 Otherness did not mean rejection: quite the contrary, it could suppose an exoticism that made it attractive. This was similar in both Christian and Muslim cultures: Sinbad was encouraged to leave his quiet home because he ardently desired to travel around countries and isles.143 In the twelfth century, Al Zuhrī� explained that, of the seven climates the world is divided into, the first was the centre of what is inhabited, while the others advanced towards the extremes.144 In these distant places fantastic human and non-human beings were found. Through their strangeness, the description of their char140 Flocel Sabaté, “‘Amar la nostra nació,’” in Sardegna e Catalogna “officinae” di identità riflessioni storiografiche e prospetttive di ricerca.

Traditional historio­graphy has resorted to France and England in the Hundred Years’ War as an example where their respective national identities were reinforced.147 In reality, in this case, the conflict accentuated traits of cohesion, whereby each side emphasized its own language, and led to English becoming accepted as a language precisely when, in the fifteenth century, its “island mentality,” in Gwilym Dood’s words, was being constructed.148 This could lead to criticism of the character of the others, as in Contamine’s discussion about coolness between the French and the English: As for the French, they were depicted in varied colours which were far from flattering. Foreigners traditionally reproached them for their pride, lightness, carelessness, their love of pleasure. Other grievances were added in the fourteenth century: they explained their failures by their cowardice [...]. By contrast, the English were deemed violent beings, gluttonous, greedy, and coarse, swollen with beer, thirsty for gold and blood, living in a sad, distant, and depressing country.149\n\nDistinguishing between groups was part of the game of identity. Francesc Eiximenis compared the Catalan nation with groups nearby— the French, German, English and Italian, Castilian, and Portuguese—to conclude that among them all, the Catalans had the best table manners: “the Catalan nation was [an] example for all other peoples.”150 This type of confrontation lent itself to political manoeuvres.

This is very clear in the conflict caused by the conquest of Sardinia by the Crown of Aragon in the fourteenth century. The opposition to the conquest led by the judge of Arborea did not invoke a conflict between lords but between peoples, between the Sard nation and the Catalan nation. Both sides accepted this concept: in the city of Sassari it was explained that, “the king with the Catalans, in an evil and perverse way, seized the city, taking advantage of the good faith of the Sards, and expelled them with great betrayal, from which damage and destruction have followed”153 while, on the other side, the aim was to “annihilate and destroy the detestable and smug rebellion of the Sard nation.”154 The war-cry repeated by the Sard rebels was “Arborea!, Arborea! Death to the Catalans,”155 thus linking the Catalans to the dynasty that by taking over Arborea claimed legitimacy over Sardinia. However, while the Crown of Aragon expanded across the Mediterranean and others saw them as Catalans, as documents in different countries show, the soldiers who spearheaded these conquests went into combat shouting the name of their dynasty: Aragó! Aragó!156 This was the same in earlier centuries: feudal troops called out the name of the lineage under which they were grouped.157 What led groups into conflict was not their difference, but a specific political or social circumstance, and 151 “El nostre poble és franc e no és així� subjugat com és lo poble de Castella.” Cited from Pere el Cerimoniós, Crònica de Pere III el Cerimoniós, ed.
