These tournaments include the 2013 French Open, and the 2011 and 2012 Wimbledon. Let’s proceed with how to bet on Azarenka on BetDSI.\n\nVictoria Azarenka: Early Career\n\nAzarenka made her debut in November 2003, during the ITF Junior Circuit in Israel. She won one doubles title against Olga Govortsova in that competition. Victoria Azarenka reached the Wimbledon girls’ tournament semifinals. She gave a strong performance throughout the tournament. However, she lost to Ana Ivanovic in the semifinals despite earning two match points in the third set. Azarenka kept playing in ITF competitions in 2004. By the end of that campaign, she was ranked №508 in the world on the WTA Tour.\n\nAzarenka was more successful in 2005. She won the Junior Grand Slam twice that year, including the Australian Open and the US Championships. The tennis star ended the campaign as the world’s junior №1 tennis player. Azarenka was named world champion at the 2005 ITF, making her the first Belarusian to receive such an honor. Additionally, she also reached her first semifinals during the main tour in Guangzhou, China, in 2005.\n\nVictoria Azarenka: Professional Career\n\nAzarenka got to the fourth round of the US Open in 2022 with victories against Martic and Kostyuk. However, she lost against Karoline Pliskova after three sets. Victoria Azarenka reached the semifinals of the 2022 Guadalajara Open Akron.\n\nRivalries\n\nSince she began playing professionally, Azarenka has had rivalries with other top WTA tennis players. Her main rivals are Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams. The three of them have played against each other 15 times. However, we will only focus on Azarenka’s rivalry with Williams. The pair have played against each other 23 times, including eleven Grand Slams. Williams is leading head-to-head (18–5, 10–1) in Grand Slams and in Finals (5–4). They first met at the Australian Open. At the time, Williams was the defending champion, and she won the game in straight sets.\n\nAzarenka’s First Victory\n\nThe next time they came up against each other was at the 2009 Australian Open. Williams won in the fourth round after Azarenka retired from the tournament due to illness. Although she initially won the first set, she later started to trail 2–4 in the second set. Azarenka’s victory was close. Soon after, she defeated her rival in the Sony Ericsson Open two and a half months later. She won the game in straight sets in the finals of the competition. Williams fought back during Wimbledon, winning two games against her rival in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe ladies met in the quarterfinals of the 2010 Australian Open once more. This time, Azarenka won the first set and even led the second set for a period before Williams bounced back to claim victory. Williams won 2–3 on her way to the title for the second consecutive season. She continued to dominate games against Azarenka with straight victories at the 2011 US Open and Rogers Cup. Despite dropping to world number 175 after Wimbledon, Williams won these matches. However, their rivalry peaked in 2012, when the pair met five times. Williams was victorious on each occasion.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nAzarenka’s style of play is aggressive. She prefers to hit the ball hard early in the rise. She’s an aggressive baseliner who hits the ball flat. Azarenka hits many winners per match despite her aggressive style of play. She also hits far fewer errors, and she is successful because she builds her game around controlled aggression. Azarenka hits groundstrokes relentlessly with great depth and power. The tennis star aims to alter the position of her opponents during games. She also counterpunches until an opportunity to play a low-risk winner presents itself. The Belarussian uses her strongest groundstrokes to dominate her opponents on the court.\n\nAzarenka has one of the greatest backhands of all time. She is also known for her signature shot, which is her backhand down-the-line attack. Moreover, Azarenka possesses a strong forehand. She uses this ability to rally efficiently and hit winners. However, her forehand is her vulnerable attack point. No wonder rivals who know her style target her weaker hand. She also has a powerful first serve. Azarenka can reach as high as 179 km/h. However, despite having a high first serve, her second serve is usually volatile. She commits errors in large numbers when under pressure.\n\nVictoria Azarenka: Professional Career Statistics\n\nNote that these career stats encompass 2006–2022.
