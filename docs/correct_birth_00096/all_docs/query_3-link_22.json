        "text": "Victoria Azarenka has confirmed she will play the ASB Classic in January, seemingly bringing an end to the childcare issue that saw her miss the US Open and Fed Cup final.\n\nAzarenka gave birth to her son Leo in December 2016 and only returned to action at Wimbledon â€“ where she made the fourth round.\n\nHowever, after separating from Leo's father, Azarenka was forced to miss two major events as she would have had to leave her son at home in California to enable her to play.\n\nAzarenka explained the \"custody situation\" was behind her absence for the Fed Cup final in her home city of Minsk, the former World No. 1 unable to help Belarus as the United States lifted the title.\n\nThat issue appears to have reached its conclusion, though, after the 28-year-old confirmed she would be travelling to Auckland to take her place in the main draw.\n\n\"I am very much looking forward to getting back on the court to compete in January and I can't think of a better place to start the 2018 season than in Auckland,\" she said.\n\n\"I've worked extremely hard with my team over the last few months and continue to do so for the new season, and with my goal in mind to get back to world number one and compete for grand slam titles.\n\n\"My expectations remain high as always. I personally haven't been to Auckland for a very long time and everyone says such wonderful things about the tournament and the city.\n\n\"I am really excited to experience it and be back.\""
