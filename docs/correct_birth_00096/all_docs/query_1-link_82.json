        "text": "Belarusian tennis star Victoria Azarenka has shut down a reporter’s question about the pressure she felt playing Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska at the Australian Open.\n\nThe former women’s world No. 1 was facing the media having just lost 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in the fourth round on Monday.\n\n“Did you have any additional pressure because the opponent was Ukrainian? How do you feel about the atmosphere of the fans?” a reporter asked.\n\nAzarenka ignored the first part of the question and said: “The atmosphere was good. I always enjoy playing in Australia. I think it was great. The stadium is always fun. I always have so much support here.\n\n“Yeah, I wish I could have played just longer here, but it wasn’t meant to be.”\n\nThere was then an inaudible question, which the two-time Australian Open champion replied with: “I don’t care.”\n\nThe reporter didn’t stop there, asking again: “Did you feel any additional pressure because the opponent is Ukrainian?”\n\nAzarenka simply said “next” and turned away as the moderator asked for the next question.\n\nIt is the second year players from Russia and Belarus are only allowed to compete at Melbourne Park as neutral players and not under the name or flag of their country to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn the graphics on the TV coverage, a blue space where the flag of a player’s country is usually displayed is being used for Russian and Belarusian players.\n\nTennis Australia also introduced a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian flags in Melbourne Park last year, after a Russian flag was displayed courtside during a match featuring a Ukrainian player.\n\n“The AO has a long tradition of fans supporting players by flying their national flags, it brings colour and excitement to the event,” Tennis Australia told news.com.au in a statement.\n\n“The Russian and Belarusian flags are banned, as per 2023 and the international agreement signed by the Federal Sports Minister and representatives of more than 30 countries around the world.”\n\nWhen Belarusian tennis star Aryna Sabalenka won the 2023 Australian Open, her name was engraved on the Daphne Akhurst Memorial trophy.\n\nBut unlike previous champions’ names on the trophy, Sabalenka’s country was not written in brackets like it was for Ash Barty (AUS) or Naomi Osaka (JPN)."
