        "text": "Victoria Azarenka has begun her grass-court preparations on an auspicious note. Earlier today, she defeated Zeynep Sonmez to enter the quarterfinals in Berlin. One of the outside contenders for the Wimbledon Championships title, Azarenka, is back to enjoying her game. Additionally, she has also been helped by a kind schedule and has an off day tomorrow. The former World Number 1 wants to spend some personal time in Berlin on her day off.\n\nAzarenka has traveled to Berlin along with her son, Leonard. He was also present along with Azarenka while she was involved in the post-match interview after her pre-quarterfinal victory. During that conversation, Azarenka was asked how she intended to spend her off day.\n\nLooking toward her 7-year-old son, Azarenka asked, “What are we going to do? What do you think? Maybe Legoland?” With a smile on his face, Azarenka’s son responded with “maybe,” signaling that he enjoyed the amusement parks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFurther, Azarenka went on to add, “We’ve been watching a lot of football, obviously. We went to the Croatia-Spain game at the Olympic stadium here in Berlin, which was amazing atmosphere. So we’re going to try to find something. Berlin is great for art, and we kind of are into art right now.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nA year after Leonard was born, Azarenka had a bitter separation with her ex-boyfriend, Billy McKeague. A legal custody battle ensued for Azarenka’s son, and the tennis star eventually won it. As a result, Leonard can often be seen traveling with his mother to tennis tournaments all across the globe.\n\nWhen Victoria Azarenka’s son took away the spotlight from his mother\n\nFollowing her opening-round victory at the Charleston Open earlier this year, Victoria Azarenka sat down with Tennis Channel for an interview. To everyone’s surprise, Azarenka’s 7-year-old son, Leonard, was also present, along with his mother. Like every fan, Leonard was also elated by Azarenka’s successful transition to the clay court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nExpressing his joy, Azarenka’s son stated, “Mom won, so I like that! Effort is non-negotiable,” a proud Leonard stated. Azarenka’s son’s adorable gesture won fans’ hearts, and the clip went viral on social media, with many fans left in awe after Azarenka’s son took the spotlight away from his mother.\n\nMeanwhile, Azarenka will look to keep her jolly mood going. She will take on the winner of the match between Elena Rybakina and Veronika Kudermetova in the quarterfinals. With the form she is in, do you see Azarenka as a contender for the Wimbledon title?
