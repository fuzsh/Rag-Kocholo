        "text": "Victoria Azarenka was born July 31, 1989 in Minsk, Belarus. She was introduced to tennis at the age of 7 by her mother, Alla. Early in her career she played on the ITF Junior circuit winning one ITF Singles title, three ITF Doubles titles, two Junior Grand Slam Singles titles, and four Junior Grand Slam Doubles titles. From 2007-2008 she made breakthroughs in doubles capturing the 2007 US Open Mixed Doubles title, 2008 French Open Mixed Doubles title, as well as reaching the finals of the 2007 Aussie Open Mixed Doubles and 2008 Aussie Open Women's Doubles. Her singles game stepped up from 2012-2013 where she captured the 2012 and 2013 Australian Open Women's Singles titles as well as reaching the Women's Singles Semifinals at the other three grand slams. She took some time off to recover from injury, give birth to her son Leo, and fight custody battles from 2017-2018. Now she's worked her way back towards the top 50 rankings and competing for more titles. She speaks Belarussian, Russian, and English. She loves rock, hip-hop and R&B music. Her favorite shot is her backhand and her best surface is hard courts. She spends most of her time training and living in Monaco, and she's a great admirer of Roger Federer."
