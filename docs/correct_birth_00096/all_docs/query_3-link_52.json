        "text": "Roger Federer has four, Novak Djokovic two (if you count the bump) and Andy Murray one. But the leading women have not introduced a child to the tour since Kim Clijsters – with 18-month-old Jada in tow – came out of retirement to win the 2009 US Open.\n\nAll that is changing rapidly this year. Not only through Serena Williams’s high-profile pregnancy – which won maximum exposure this week with her naked photoshoot on the cover of Vanity Fair – but via Victoria Azarenka’s return to the court, which began a fortnight ago in Majorca.\n\nAzarenka stepped back from tennis after last year’s French Open, readying herself for the arrival of Leo on Dec 19. Just over six weeks later, she began hitting balls again, and embarked on an intense programme of reconditioning under the supervision of Birmingham-born fitness trainer Ashcon Rezzadeh.\n\nSo does she support the argument – posited by endurance athletes from Paula Radcliffe to Liz McColgan – that pregnancy can improve athletic performance?\n\n“Compared to my physique before pregnancy, yes, I do feel different. I have worked really hard and changed a few things – not only my fitness regime but also my nutrition. When I think about it, being pregnant definitely helped my physique.”\n\nAzarenka is in London with a bigger family group than ever, including not only Leo but her boyfriend, Billy McKeague, and her mother Ala. In both cases, she says, their presence is a blessing.\n\nMcKeague has taken time out from his own career – he was working as a golf pro at some of Hawaii’s most glamorous resorts when they met – to accompany Azarenka on tour for the foreseeable future. “I have a nanny but she is not here at the moment,” she said, “so obviously my boyfriend has been helping out. He loves being a dad and spending time with Leo. It’s fun.”\n\nAla, meanwhile, was diagnosed last year with stage four breast cancer. Azarenka learnt the news in January – another emotional knockout in what was a turbulent year all round. But after treatment in the family’s home town of Minsk, Ala was declared free of the disease in March.\n\n“It was amazing,” says Azarenka of that happy news. “It was a very emotional time, leading up to it. It’s tough until you hear the result. Yes, we have driven over some bumps in the road. But that’s life, right?”\n\nThe All England Club authorities were delighted to see Azarenka return on grass, but also a little surprised. She is at her most comfortable on hard courts – the surface on which she won her two Australian Open – and had thus targeted the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford for her comeback, immediately after Wimbledon.\n\nBut her new coach, Michael Joyce – who is best known for spending seven years as part of Maria Sharapova’s team – encouraged her to be bolder. And Azarenka herself acknowledges that she was becoming impatient as the year wore on.\n\n“While I was away,” she said, “I didn’t miss the travelling from week to week. But I missed going on the match court. I was tired of practising, of just going through drills. I needed competition.”\n\nThe results in Majorca were less than sensational. Azarenka squeezed past world No 74 Rita Osaki in the first round before being thumped 6-1, 6-3 by heavy-hitting Croatian Ana Konjuh. But what she has not previously admitted is that she was suffering from the aftermath of chicken pox when she started the tournament, having contracted the illness when she arrived on the island.\n\n“It was not a great time,” she says, “especially before the first match and coming back and not being able to practise. But it was helpful that my body is pretty strong, and I was able to fight off the virus in such a quick time. Some people have it for three weeks or so, whereas mine only lasted for a week.”\n\nOne suspects that this tournament may have come a few weeks too early for Azarenka. Her consistency is usually her strength, deployed in a baseline pressing game that makes her the female equivalent of Novak Djokovic.\n\nIn the long run, though, she believes that she will be stronger for the presence of what she calls “an extra member of my team”.\n\n“It used to be that you practise, you play, and then you go back to your hotel room and you still think about tennis. Now it’s kind of impossible to think about tennis when I come home.\n\n“I think that’s great. I have help when I play, when I go to practise and stuff. Then everything that is off court and in between, I honestly feels so much better and happier.\n\n“It’s true that being in an individual sport, you have to be a little bit selfish. So it’s a little bit of a mind trick. I have to feel OK with taking some time for myself, not feeling guilty that I don’t spend my every free second with my son, which is sometimes tough."
