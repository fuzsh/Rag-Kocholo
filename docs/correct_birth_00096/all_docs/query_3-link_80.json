        "text": "Montreal, June 26, 2018 — Tennis Canada announced on Tuesday that Victoria Azarenka of Belarus is the recipient of a wild card for the 2018 Rogers Cup presented by National. This will be her first time playing in Montreal since 2014, she was expecting her first child during the 2016 tournament.\n\n“I am very much looking forward to returning to Montreal this summer. It has been a few years since I was in this beautiful city, and I can’t wait to be back and see the amazing fans in Quebec. I have some fond memories of playing in Montreal in the past so I hope to add to that this summer!”\n\nAzarenka, who has been ranked World No. 1 and has won two Grand Slam titles, is currently ranking no. 87 and will be looking to regain her place at the top of the rankings after her absence from the tour. The 28-year-old athlete gave birth to her first child in December of 2016. After attempting a comeback in 2017, it was actually in March of 2018 that she was able to make a full return to competition. Her best result came when she reached the semi-finals at the tournament in Miami.\n\n“We are very pleased to be able to announce the participation of Victoria Azarenka in our tournament by awarding her a wild card,” stated Eugène Lapierre, Tournament Director of Rogers Cup presented by National Ban. “She has been a major figure on the WTA tour in the last ten years and tennis fans are very happy to see her back in action playing in various tournaments after her absence. Victoria is showing us that it is possible to be a mother and a professional tennis player at the same time, which is already quite an accomplishment. I am certain that the Montreal fans are looking forward to seeing her back on court.”\n\nAzarenka will be looking for her first Rogers Cup title after reaching the semi-finals on three occasions, including twice in Montreal in 2008 and 2010. The WTA wild card that she has received is reserved for players who have previously been ranked No. 1 in the world, who were ranked in the Top 20 in 2017 or who have won a Grand Slam title, a WTA Finals title or a Premier Mandatory tournament during their career. The complete list of players entered in the 2018 Rogers Cup presented by National Bank will be unveiled on Thursday, June 28."
