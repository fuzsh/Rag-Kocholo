        "text": "2-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka said that she is delighted to see female tennis players ‘breaking stereotypes’ and returning to play the game after giving birth.\n\nBack in 2017, Serena Williams made her return after becoming a mother. Last year, Ukraine’s Elina Svtolina returned and also went on to beat World No.1 Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon.\n\nRecently, Angelique Kerber returned to playing tennis, after which it’s time for Naomi Osaka, who has been out of the game since September 2022.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAzarenka said that she is happy to see players feeling ‘comfortable’ and ‘confident’ about making returns despite going through the rigours of giving birth.\n\n“I'm very excited to see players are coming back. I've said it a few years ago already. I think we broke the stereotype that you become an athlete and have family. This definitely has been broken. It's actually evolved more and more. The testament of that is how many players are feeling comfortable and confident coming back and continue being on tour,” Azarenka was quoted as saying in Brisbane Press.\n\nAzarenka, who became a mother to a baby boy back in 2016, said that athletes need to be made more secure so that they can keep alive their dreams of playing tennis despite time away from the game.\n\n“I believe that we still have a lot more growth to do in that space to continue to push forward being a women's leading sport, how we can make our athletes feel more secure, more comfortable at all levels, not just top level, but also lower levels where they have that stability, financial security to keep coming back. I think we have an opportunity to do that in women's sports like maybe not before. I hope we put the right resources into that,” she added.\n\nAzarenka is set to take part in the Brisbane International where she got a first round bye and fill face Russia’s Anna Kalinskaya in the Round of 32."
