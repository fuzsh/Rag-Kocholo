        "text": "Naomi Osaka said it would be “life-changing” for female players on the WTA tour to receive maternity pay.\n\nThe 26-year-old recently returned to the professional tennis circuit after giving birth to her daughter last year.\n\nThe Japan player is fully behind fellow former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who firmly believes the WTA Tour should introduce financial support for female players.\n\n\"I think it would definitely be life-changing and I feel like having a kid shouldn't feel like a punishment,\" Osaka said.\n\n\"For most female athletes, I think there's a discussion that your career is going to change dramatically or going to finish because you have a kid.\n\n“Just appreciating them more and giving more options is something that is very necessary.\"\n\nDue to rule changes since the 2019 season, it is easier for players to return following pregnancy because they have a protected ranking.\n\nFemale players are now allowed to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period after giving birth.\n\nZverev beats De Minaur, books battle against Alcaraz - Indian Wells highlights\n\nAzarenka returned to tennis following maternity leave in 2016 and earlier this year said that “a lot has to change” and that she hoped the sport was “on the right track to do it\".\n\n\"I think the important part is to change the financial part of maternity leave,” Azarenka said, who believes the next step is for the WTA to introduce maternity pay.\n\n“I think that would be a huge win for women in general, so I hope we find the resources to be able to do that. I think that would be incredible.\n\n\"I have, I'm guessing, more financial security than some players who may be outside the top 100, and maybe have the same desires and ambitions to have a child and continue to do their job.\"\n\nTatjana Maria is one of seven mothers playing in the main draw at Indian Wells this year and believes maternity pay is long overdue.\n\n\"I think it's completely correct to do this,” Maria said, who feels she did not have significant career earnings when she took her first break from the WTA Tour 11 years ago.\n\n“Other jobs you have worldwide it's the same rule - when you get pregnant, you get paid - and I think why not in tennis?\n\n\"There are more mums on tour and we are coming into a generation where you can play much longer than before, and it will be more in the future.\n\n“It's something the WTA has to see, that we have more mums on tour, and change it.\"\n\n- - -\n\nStream the 2024 French Open live and on-demand on discovery+"
