        "text": "Country\n\nBelarus\n\nBorn\n\nJuly 31, 1989\n\nKnown for\n\n2-time Australian Open winner\n\nVictoria Azarenka (born July 31, 1989) is a Belarusian tennis player. She won two Grand Slams, both at the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013. One of her career highlights include multiple Grand Slam finals and winning the Indian Wells/Miami double in 2016 that put her back in her 2012/2013 form.\n\nShe was ranked No.1 in 2012 because of the points Caroline Wozniacki couldn't defend during the Australian Open. Her only Olympic medals to date were bronze in women's singles in 2012.\n\nCareer\n\nBeginning\n\nShe won junior Grand Slams in 2005. She started to rose in the WTA rankings after the 2006 US Open.\n\n2007: Top 30\n\n2008\n\n2009: Top 10 debut and breakthrough\n\n2010\n\n2011: Top 5 debut\n\n2012: World No.1\n\n2013: Third Top 3 season\n\n2014-2015: Decline and injuries\n\n2016: Sunshine Double winner and back to top 5\n\nAzarenka started 2016 outside the top 20. She won the title at Brisbane. After the title, she came back to the top 20 in the top 20 in the tennis world for the first time since at least the 2015 US Open. She also won titles in the March US hard-court swing, at Indian Wells and Miami to put her back in the form that she was in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAzarenka had a knee issue at the French Open forcing her to a shock retirement against Italian Karin Knapp. This eventually saw her withdraw from the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nDue to her announcement about her pregnancy, she withdrew from every tournament she entered from Montreal until the end of the season. Azarenka played only nine tournaments in a season that was marred by the knee injury, and will finish the year likely outside of the top ten; but eventually she did. She withdrew from the 2016 Swiss Open in December with the same reason. As she gave birth to Leo, Azarenka became a mom.\n\n2017\n\nAzarenka eventually retuned at Wimbledon, where she made the fourth round."
