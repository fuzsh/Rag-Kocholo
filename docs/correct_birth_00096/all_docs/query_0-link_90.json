        "text": "Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka will be on opposite sides of the net in the women's semifinals almost five years after teaming up on the same court in a Fed Cup semifinal against Australia.\n\nAustralian Open champion Sabalenka ensured the matchup when she extended her winning streak Down Under to 14 with a 6-1, 6-4 win over fifth-seeded Daria Kasatkina on Friday night.\n\nShe won a title in Adelaide last year before her Grand Slam breakthrough at Melbourne Park, the start of a 2023 season that also included a run to the U.S. Open final and the semifinals at the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nSabalenka was utterly dominant in the first set of her night match in front of a Pat Rafter Arena crowd that included actor Jude Law, pinning Kasatkina on the baseline with her deep, powerful ground strokes.\n\nShe peeled off 32 winners and dropped just one service game in 1 1/2 hours.\n\nSabalenka and Azarenka have both won the Australian Open title and both have been ranked No. 1. They were both born in Minsk, Belarus, albeit about nine years apart, but have played only four times previously at the elite level. Sabalenka leads their head-to-head encounters 3-1.\n\n\"Sheâ€™s an amazing player. I was growing watching her,\" Sabalenka said of her 34-year-old compatriot. \"It's going to be a great battle. I'm really looking forward for that.\"\n\nAzarenka, a two-time champion at both the Australian Open (2012 and '13) and in Brisbane (2009 and '16) , had a tougher run in the opening match of the day, needing 2 1/2 hours to advance 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 over a hot-and-bothered former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nSecond-seeded Elena Rybakina only needed to play seven games in her quarterfinal match.\n\nRybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022 and was runner-up at the Australian Open last year, won the first set 6-1 before 11th-seeded Anastasia Potapova retired from their match with an abdominal injury.\n\nShe'll next play Linda Noskova, who beat 16-year-old Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-3.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis"
