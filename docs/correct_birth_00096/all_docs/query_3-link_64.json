        "text": "Victoria Azarenka has officially withdrawn from the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I am sadly unable to compete in this year's US Open due to my ongoing family situation that I am working through,\" she said in a statement released Monday. \"While I will dearly miss being in New York and playing in one of my favorite tournaments where I have enjoyed some of the best moments in my career, I am already looking forward to being back next year.\"\n\nLast week Azarenka penned a heartfelt note about motherhood and her ongoing custody battle with her ex-boyfriend Billy McKeague. Their son Leo was born in December.\n\nRelated: Victoria Azarenka on being a working mom, possibly missing U.S. Open\n\n\"Shortly after Wimbledon, Leo's father and I separated and as we work to resolve some of the legal processes, the way things stand now is that the only way I can play in the US Open this year is if I leave Leo behind in California, which I'm not willing to do,\" Azarenka wrote on social media Thursday.\n\nA former world No. 1, Azarenka is now ranked 204 in singles after taking time off. She reached the finals of the 2013 U.S. Open.\n\nIn her post on social media last week, Azarenka wrote that she's optimistic the situation will be resolved soon. \"No parent should have to decide between their child or their career,\" she wrote.\n\nWith Azarenka's withdrawal, Misa Eguchi of Japan moves into the main draw."
