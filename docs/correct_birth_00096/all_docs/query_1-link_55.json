        "text": "Victoria Azarenka probably has as many friends in Melbourne this weekend as Lance Armstrong has kept in the past week but she is here to win the Australian Open, not a popularity contest. No matter how poor were her judgment and manners in the semi-final against Sloane Stephens, she is in the mood to deliver. Whether her allegedly bruised body has healed we will discover in the final against Li Na on Saturday.\n\nAzarenka is not quite as angry as she was in an interview 18 months ago when, responding to criticism for another act of gamesmanship, she said: \"Screw them, I am what I am.\" But neither is she a shattered shell. She has survived what was a mugging of a kid, in the tennis sense, by stretching the rules to the limit with a nine-minute medical timeout after being broken when serving for the match. She came back apparently no longer feeling like she was \"going to have a heart attack\" because of a blocked rib. Stephens had been lulled and Azarenka got the win.\n\nTrying to hustle the 19-year-old American out of her first grand slam semi-final might well have had its origins in genuine stress but the timing was nakedly opportunistic. Stephens's coach, David Nainkin, called it \"cheating within the rules\" and, \"unsportsmanlike\".\n\nAzarenka has tried to clear the air but does not admit culpability. \"All I can do is try to give my best. What I can control is come to you guys and tell my side of the story. I can't control what you will write or what people will think, because that is out of my hands.\n\n\"I'm here sitting honestly, it's what I wanted to do, to clear the air. I can see [it through] the public eye, I can see [it through] the journalist's eye but I know my own thing – that is why I'm here to explain, to drop it and to be open. I hope we can move on for the final.\n\n\"It's not going to cause any problems because it was not intentional. I think [Stephens] didn't take it personal, and that is great for her. I think she is terrific girl [they share the same agent]. I'm going to send a message just to make sure that we are OK but I know we are fine and that is it.\"\n\nSo that train would appear to have left town. The final, meanwhile, presents the defending champion (whose problematic ribs are healing, apparently) with a tougher and more seasoned adversary in Li, who thrilled Melbourne when she reached the final here two years ago to inspire hope that China would react deliriously to the arrival of a standard bearer with hope of winning a grand slam. Not quite. She broke through definitively in Paris and we await the next wave of players from China with keen anticipation.\n\nLi would not be drawn into criticising Azarenka. \"I'm not her,\" she said, \"so I didn't know the truth. I mean, also I wasn't on the court to see, so I couldn't say anything.\"\n\nIn a quick and wholly unscientific trawl of opinion beyond the locker room, as the throng filled Melbourne Park on a cooler but not unpleasant day, it was obvious sentiment will not be with the Belarusian. Li is their darling, anyway, a quirky and talented individual whose tennis is grounded in hard work and growing belief. \"Gotta be the Chinese girl, mate,\" said one spectator. \"Azarenka totally got it wrong.\"\n\nBut she may totally get it right on the court. While she has betrayed vulnerability here in the past – succumbing to the heat and being carried from the court on a stretcher – on her day, she is capable of the most rugged and nagging tennis. Her strength is in her muscle but her tennis brain is acute too.\n\nThe suspicion is that the controversy has galvanised her. She holds their title but not – for the moment – the affection of Australians. So she must show them that the real Azarenka is a champion not a cheat.\n\nShe has already secured the world No1 ranking, so her self-esteem will be intact and victory would put her alongside Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova as the only active players with two or more grand slam titles. Those numbers and the title matter more to her than opprobrium that will be forgotten soon enough."
