        "text": "Victoria Azarenka is a former world No. 1 tennis player. She stepped away in 2016 due to pregnancy and just announced the birth of her first child.\n\nVictoria Azarenka had happy news on Monday.\n\nVia her social media accounts, the star tennis player announced the birth of her son.\n\nMore from Lob and Smash\n\nAzarenka seemed in high spirits Monday and included a picture of her with her newborn son. The Belarusian tennis star is a fan favorite and regularly interacts with her fans.\n\nThe former world No. 1 had this to say via her Instagram and Twitter accounts: “Today I had my hardest fight and my very best victory! Our son was born healthy and happy! So thankful and blessed! Thank you.”\n\nIn recent interviews, Azarenka stated that she is planning to return to tennis soon. Although there is no timetable for her return to the court, the tennis world can speculate that she will remain away from the WTA Tour for the next few months. Azarenka continued to stay in tennis shape throughout her pregnancy and it is well known the Belarusian player is a fierce competitor.\n\nEven if she spends the next several months at home with her newborn son, there is no doubt that Victoria Azarenka will return in fine form, hopefully midway throughout the 2017 WTA Tour.\n\nWant your voice heard?
