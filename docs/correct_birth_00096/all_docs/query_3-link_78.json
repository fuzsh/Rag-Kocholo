        "text": "London: Victoria Azarenka stepped up her bid to become the first mother to win Wimbledon in 37 years as the former world number one defeated Russian 15th seed Elena Vesnina on Wednesday.\n\nAzarenka cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory in the second round of her first Grand Slam since taking a year off to have her first child in December.\n\nIn just her second tournament following son Leo’s birth, the 27-year-old Belarusian hopes to become the first mother to lift the Wimbledon women’s singles trophy since Evonne Goolagong in 1980.\n\nOnly Goolagong, Margaret Court and Kim Clijsters have won a Grand Slam singles title after having a child.\n\nHaving been made to wait around all day to play her first round match against CiCi Bellis on Monday, Azarenka had complained that the scheduling wasn’t helpful for a new mum.\n\nAll England Club officials heeded her advice and Azarenka was given the opening match on Court Three.\n\nVesnina reached the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, but Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, extended her winning streak against the Russian to eight matches with a powerful performance.\n\nAzarenka, twice a Wimbledon semi-finalist, will play British wild card Heather Watson for a place in the last 16.\n\nWatson hammered out a statement of intent, swiping aside 18th seed Anastasija Sevastova 6-0 6-4 to reach the third round.\n\nOn a roasting Court Two, the Briton was in the hottest of form in the first set, bashing big forehand winners past her Latvian opponent to clinch it in less than 20 minutes.\n\nAlthough Sevastova stabilised in the second set, twice going a break ahead, she was unable to arrest the Briton’s momentum as Watson became the first player — man or woman — to reach the last 32.\n\n“Starts are very important, but I’m really happy with the second set because she raised her level,” smiled Watson.\n\n“The first set I just felt great, pretty flawless. It’s always going to change. I’ve got to expect her to raise her level and to try something new, and she did. I was pleased with how I remained calm and just kept doing what I was doing.”\n\nWatson said of Azarenka: “I look forward to playing her. I know she has only just come back, but I expect her to be playing really well because I know she will have put in the hours and the work.\n\n“You don’t get to where she’s got to in her career without, you know, being a really good player.”"
