But she only played six matches this season and is currently ranked 208th.\n\nShe cited the custody dispute when she pulled out of the U.S. Open in August, saying then that it wasn't possible for her child to travel with her to New York for the Grand Slam tournament.\n\nU.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, who is ranked 13th, leads the American team, along with No. 10 CoCo Vandeweghe, a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist. Shelby Rogers and Alison Riske are the other members of U.S. captain Kathy Rinaldi's roster."
