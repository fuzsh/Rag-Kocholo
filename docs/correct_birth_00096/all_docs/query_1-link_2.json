        "text": "What is Victoria Azarenka’s stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?\n\nAzarenka posted a statement on social media on March 2, calling for an end to the war and for peace everywhere. “My heart is with everyone directly and indirectly impacted by this war that is causing such pain and suffering for so many. I hope and wish for peace and an end to the war.”\n\nwhat happened between azarenka and ostapenko?\n\nAt the 2024 Qatar Open, Jelena Ostapenko refused to shake hands with Azarenka after losing to the Belarusian in the quarter-finals, instead offering a racquet tap at the net which Azarenka refused.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Ostapenko did this, but it was later revealed that the Latvian government had recently passed a law stating Latvian would not participate in sporting events against Russians or Belarusians. As such, Ostapenko did not shake hands with Azarenka.\n\nCan Victoria Azarenka continue to play on the WTA Tour and at Grand Slams?\n\nYes. Players from Russia and Belarus are allowed to continue to compete on the WTA Tour, but not under their country’s flag. Players from Russia and Belarus are banned from all team competitions, including the Billie Jean King Cup, because of the war.\n\nWhen was Victoria Azarenka born?\n\nVictoria Azarenka is 32 years old. She was born July 31, 1989, in Minsk, Belarus.\n\nWho are her family?\n\nHer mother’s name is Alla (and she’s an incredible cook, according to Azarenka), her father’s name is Fedor. She has one brother, Max. Her mother introduced her to tennis when she was 7 years old. She has a son, Leo, who was born on December 9, 2016.\n\nWhat did Victoria Azarenka do in 2020?\n\nAzarenka returned to top form at the 2020 US Open and reached her first Grand Slam final in seven years. She defeated Serena Williams in a three-set semi-final, which was her first ever win over Williams at a Grand Slam. It was Azarenka’s first Grand Slam final since her son Leo was born in 2016.\n\nHow did Victoria Azarenka perform in 2021?\n\nAzarenka began the year well, reaching the semi-final in Qatar and then again in the summer in Berlin. But her Grand Slam showings were disappointing, with her fourth-round run at the French Open her best. But she bounced back in style when she reached the final of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells in October, only losing out to Paula Badosa.\n\nWho is Victoria Azarenka’s coach?\n\nAzarenka is currently coached by Maxime Tchoutakian. Previously, she has been coached by Dorian Descloix, a former French tennis player. Wim Fissette and Sam Sumyk are among her previous coaches. Her time with Descloix came to an end at the end of 2021, with the Frenchman now working with Monica Puig.\n\nHow tall is Victoria Azarenka?\n\nVictoria Azarenka is 6ft 1in (1.85m) tall according to her official profile on the WTA Tour website.\n\nHow good was Victoria Azarenka as a junior?\n\nVery. Azarenka was the world’s top-ranked junior and won two Grand Slam junior titles in 2005, at the Australian Open and US Open.\n\nWhat are her career highlights so far?\n\nVictoria Azarenka has won two Grand Slam titles, picking up back-to-back wins at the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013. She became world No 1 on Jan 30, 2012 and has spent 51 weeks in total on top of the WTA rankings. She also won an Olympic gold medal in mixed doubles in the 2012 Games in London and the bronze in singles.\n\nAzarenka’s most recent Grand Slam appearance was at the 2024 Australian Open, where she reached the fourth round, losing to Dayana Yastremska in two sets.\n\nHow much money has Victoria Azarenka earned on tour?\n\nAzarenka has earned more than $34.9 million in her career, as of January 2, 2023, having won 21 titles, including two Grand Slam titles.\n\nWhy was Azarenka in the news in 2021?\n\nAzarenka released a new podcast, called “Think About It”. The show is described as such:\n\n“Former WTA World No.1 Victoria Azarenka hosts intimate and honest conversations with inspiring high level guests from various walks of life and business.”\n\n“My goal was to learn and take the audience on that learning experience,” Azarenka told WTA Insider. “The other goal was to show conversations between people who are in different fields being real and authentic.\n\nIs Victoria Azarenka active on social media?"
