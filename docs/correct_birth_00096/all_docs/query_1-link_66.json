        "text": "What does one do after losing a tough opening set?\n\nWhile Victoria Azarenka was busy resetting Thursday against an in-form Taylor Townsend, son Leo turned to dessert for his coping mechanism.\n\nâI needed an ice cream break. I really needed it. I was too hot,â he told Steve Weissman.\n\nâI went to the bathroom and took the ice cream break, too,â joked his mom.\n\nAzarenka would eventually turn the match around in her favor for a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4 victory over the left-hander. A phenomenal match point saw Azarenka use every bit of her reach in sliding defensive shots, eventually outfoxing Townsendâs final volley with a charging backhand pushed into the open court to cap a 13-point rally.\n\nâIt just probably sums up the whole match. It was so dramatic,â said Azarenka.\n\nâTaylor played great, she hit so many lines. Her serve was really tough. I feel like especially in the second set, I got a really important break and got a little better energy, better rhythm there.â\n\nThe former world No. 1 went four for 18 on her break point chances during the hard-fought battle.\n\nâJust to be able to create those opportunities, itâs really important. I feel like it does apply pressure on my opponent,â she assessed. âIn the important moments, I still kept positive. It was really tough conditions to feel the rhythm. Iâm happy I was able to fight through that.â\n\nHow did Leo sum up the latest performance?\n\nâAmazing.â\n\nTo use his word, an amazing quarterfinal showdown awaits the 34-year-old, as Azarenka will take on Jessica Pegula. The world No. 5 rolled over Magda Linette, 6-2, 6-2. Earlier in the week, Pegula gave Azarenka something to think about.\n\nâWe practiced here the first day I got here. She kicked my ass!â laughed the No. 12 seed. âSo Iâm going to try to get my revenge.\n\nâJessie is a great player. We always have tough battles.â\n\nJaqueline Cristian eliminated an American opponent for the third consecutive round. Following wins over Sachia Vickery and No. 8 seed Madison Keys, Cristian downed 10th-seeded home favorte Emma Navarro, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, to line up a last eight clash with former champion Daria Kasatkina. The No. 4 seed dispatched Anhelina Kalinina, 6-1, 6-4, capitalizing on nine of her 11 break points.\n\nLater, Danielle Collins notched her 10th successive winâand second of the dayâafter defeating Sloane Stephens, 6-2, 6-2, in the third round. She previously ousted reigning champion Ons Jabeur in the early afternoon."
