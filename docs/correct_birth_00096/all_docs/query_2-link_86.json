She defeated Azarenka weeks after she was forced to retire due to injury in the previous WTA Master's Tournament, the Western & Southern Open.\n\nOsaka, 22, was ranked 20th in the WTA rankings prior to the U.S. Open. Born in Japan and currently based in the U.S., Osaka has been playing professionally since 2016.\n\nSaturday's final took place in an empty Arthur Ashe Stadium in the Flushing Meadows neighborhood of Queens, New York. The entire tournament took place without spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic."
