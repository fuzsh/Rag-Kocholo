        "text": "Victoria Azarenka says she wants to continue to be a good role model for her son, as she seeks a third title at the Qatar Open, live on Sky Sports.\n\nAzarenka, who won in Doha in 2012 and 2013, gave birth in 2016 and returned to tennis seven months later.\n\n\"I love that I'm able to communicate with Leo and with my nephew, who also plays tennis, when you can't talk too much, they see it and you explain it to them in those deep conversations that we have, even though he's seven.\n\n\"It's priceless to me and tennis plays such a big part of that. I'm very grateful for it.\"\n\nHaving reached the semi-finals of last year's Australian Open, Azarenka could only make the fourth round of this year's tournament where she was beaten by Dayana Yastremska.\n\nThe former world No 1 got off to a winning start in Doha on Monday, claiming a three-set victory over Magdalena Frech.\n\nStream live tennis and more with NOW I Get Sky Sports\n\nHow can I watch Sky Sports Tennis? Everything you need to know\n\n\"On the court I'm a fighter. I've always said I play with my heart and when my heart is wounded you will definitely see that on the court as well because it's hard for me to fake it,\" Azarenka told Sky Sports Tennis.\n\n\"I've had few heart-breaking moments on the court and the whole world witnessed that but I would never change it because it made me grow.\n\n\"It made me become more aware because when as a young girl coming on the tour and I was so focused on myself. But now I'm much more aware of my surroundings, about what's going on, I pay a lot more attention to the sport and outside it. I want to be a good role model to my son.\n\n\"It's hard for me sometimes when you want to let those emotions out, I feel like I need to control myself and sometimes it actually works against you.\n\n\"But I've kind of learned that I would rather have those tough conversations with him. If something happens on the court, Iâ€™ll explain that sometimes things happen and you deal with that.\n\nHow to watch play on Sky Sports Tennis\n\nSky Sports has confirmed a new home for tennis in the UK and Ireland, with Sky Sports Tennis on Sky and NOW, making tennis content available all day, every day for fans.\n\nSky Sports will broadcast more live tennis than anywhere else, bringing over 4,000 matches from more than 80 tournaments a year on the ATP and WTA Tours, as well as full coverage of the US Open, all exclusively live.\n\nNon-Sky subscribers can stream live matches with a NOW Sports Day and Month Membership, via Sky Sports Tennis, Sky Sports Arena, and Sky Sports Mix channels.\n\nFor further access, fans will also be able to follow their favourite players and gain deeper insights from both Tours via Sky Sports News, the Sky Sports app, on SkySports.com and via Sky Sports social channels.\n\nFrom giant slalom skier to Grand Slam champion: Why Jannik Sinner is a born winner\n\nDownload the Sky Sports App I Follow @SkySportsTennis\n\nGet Sky Sports on WhatsApp!\n\nYou can now start receiving messages and alerts for the latest breaking sports news, analysis, in-depth features and videos from our dedicated WhatsApp channel!\n\nFind out more here"
