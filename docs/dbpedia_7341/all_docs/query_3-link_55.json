And I’m not going to put a kid who’s really ready to make a push for our team — (who) wants to hit everything that moves — in that situation.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“Suddenly, he’s faced with Smiddy? If he hits him and gets in trouble — or doesn’t hit him and still gets in trouble — it’s a no-win situation.”\n\nHartley plans to grant Smid permission next week to join the group sessions. Which is only the start.\n\nUncertainty surrounding the veteran rearguard, who is recovering from neck surgery, surely cracks opens the door for three grizzled gents here on professional tryout offers.\n\nDouglas Murray, Aaron Johnson, and Ryan Wilson would all embrace the seventh-defenceman role. (The top six spots are spoken for.)\n\nHowever, they were unfazed by Smid’s absence.\n\n“The way this league works, numbers don’t really matter,” said Murray, 35. “When you first started playing as a young guy, you looked at numbers — ‘This guy has played so-many seasons. And this guy has scored so-many goals last year.’ This business is all about winning. (So) if you show enough where you can help the team put up wins, it doesn’t matter who’s here right now — or not.\n\n“Obviously, if it was five one-way contracts (instead of seven), would my odds be better? Of course. You just come in and try to perform your best — the rest is out of your control. Once you start trying to think about what the GM or the coach thinks, you’re in trouble.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJohnson’s take was no different.\n\n“I’m not looking too far ahead,” said the 32-year-old. “It’s just a matter of playing well and preparing for the season — wherever that is.\n\n“We all kind of hang out, the three of us (defencemen on tryouts), at the hotel. We’re all in the same pot, same situation.”\n\nJohnson, a member of the Flames before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers, with a third-round pick, for Steve Staios in March 2010, isn’t overwhelmed by his standing.\n\nA no-guarantee audition? Better than nothing.\n\n“The way my career’s gone, I think I’ve been in this situation for 12 years,” said Johnson, grinning. “You don’t really think too much about the PTO. You think of it almost like you have a contract. Just play the same way and focus.”\n\nThis fall, more veterans than ever are attending camps without deals.\n\n“(Teams) don’t want to give away those last contracts — the 48th, 49th, 50th (NHL) contracts,” said Johnson. “They want to be able to make moves.”\n\nNot that he — or Murray or Wilson — is shying away.\n\n“As a hockey player, you love that challenge,” said Johnson. “You’re in an opportunity where you really have to show everything you’ve got — that’s kind of way I look at it. Go out and enjoy it and show that you can still play.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe past two winters, Johnson has turned in full campaigns in the American Hockey League — 2013-14 in Hartford, 2014-15 in Binghamton. In 2012-13, he got into 10 games with the Boston Bruins — his most recent taste of the NHL.\n\nJohnson would happily take a two-way pact.\n\nMurray, however, wants to stick in the NHL.\n\n“That’s the only way you’ve got to think about it,” said Murray, who skated in the 2014 playoffs with the Montreal Canadiens. “I go into every season thinking I’m going to win the Stanley Cup — it doesn’t matter what team you’re on.\n\n“Once you start reaching shorter than the stars, you’ll be in trouble. My goal is to get an NHL contract. If that doesn’t happen and something else (like a two-way deal) shows up, that’s a conversation for then.”\n\nFor the Bromma, Sweden, native, this is the last chance.\n\nSomething he acknowledged, admitting that, ill-advisedly, he had taken his status as an NHLer for granted.\n\n“The game was changing and I didn’t change myself as far as weight and speed and all that,” said Murray, a veteran of more than 500 games. “Now we’ll find out if it’s too little too late.”\n\nIn his prime, the 6-foot-3 bruiser played at 248 pounds.\n\nNow he’s 18 pounds lighter.\n\n“When I was 17 or 18,” said Murray, with a chuckle, “that’s the last time I weighed 230.”\n\nscruickshank@calgaryherald.com\n\nTwitter/CruickshankCH\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
