        "text": "Oct. 2, 2015\n\nWindy City Live Scoring / GolfWeek Rankings\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The eighth-ranked Purdue women's golf team heads to Chicago this weekend for the eighth-annual Windy City Collegiate, hosted Northwestern at Westmoreland Country Club on Monday and Tuesday. The Boilermakers are three-time champions of the event, looking to follow-up their season-opening win at the Minnesota Invitational.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThis year's event boasts another star-studded field, topped by top-ranked, two-time defending event champions, Southern California. Five of the top-10, and eight of the top-20 teams in the nation will be in attendance.\n\nTeamGolfWeekUSC1Arizona3Georgia5Northwestern6Purdue8Iowa State13Florida19Oklahoma State20Minnesota29Ohio State35Arizona State45UC-Davis57Virginia Tech60Tulane71Wisconsin78\n\nTHE COURSE: Westmoreland Country Club\n\nWestmoreland Country Club will play host to the Windy City Collegiate for the second straight season, hosting on a par-72, 6,219-yard course Monday and Tuesday. Founded in 1911, it has played host to the Western Open, the Western Amateur and both the Chicago District Golf Association's Women's Championship and USGA Women's Amateur Championship. The original 1912 course design by William Watson has undergone several renovations, most recently by Arthur Hills in 1993.\n\nAT THIS EVENT\n\nThis is the first-ever setting for the NIU Invitational, serving as a select preview for next year's national championships, while this is the eighth edition of the Windy City Collegiate, dating to 2008. Purdue has competed in six of the seven previous events, hosted by Big Ten Conference rival Northwestern, winning the first three events, and placing ninth in an elite field last season. August Kim was the Boilermakers' top finisher in 2014, tying for 13th place at five-over, 221, for the event. USC has won the last two Windy City Collegiates, including the 2014 individual title as well.\n\nTHE PLAYERS (Career Stats)\n\nPLAYERHOMETOWNRDS.AVG.TOP 10LOW 18LOW 54Linn AnderssonJonkoping, Sweden1875.8170215Anna Appert LundBromma, Sweden9575.21466209August KimSt. Augustine, Fla.6676.7369215Marta MartinMadrid, Spain3775.0269217Melati PutriDenpasar, Bali375.3-74226"
