        "text": "The Hockey Hall of Fame (HHOF) was established in 1943, with the first players inducted in 1945. There is a misconception about the HHOF because most players enshrined have had illustrious careers in the NHL. The HHOF is for international players, too; however, only a few players outside of North America get recognized for their contributions to the game on the world stage.\n\nVladislav Tretiak, from the Soviet Union/Russia, was the first player inducted into the HHOF without a Canadian or American passport. Often considered the most outstanding goalie ever, he remained the only non-North American player in the HHOF until 1996, when Sweden’s great Börje Salming earned induction.\n\nEventually, the gates opened to superstars born and trained in Europe who either jumped the pond to play in the NHL or earned recognition for their achievements in international competitions. However, Salming remained the only player from his Nordic homeland with a plaque in Toronto. He finally got some company with a few new players, earning their ticket to immortality in 2012, 2014, and 2015.\n\nRelated: 3 Stanley Cup Winning Goalies Not in the Hockey Hall of Fame\n\nAs of the Class of 2023, there are 306 players in the HHOF, just 22 of whom were born outside North America, with eight from Sweden. When Salming was inducted in 1996, he was alone for almost two decades. Still, as more Swedisb-born established themselves as elite players in the NHL and international competitions during the 21st century, the country’s inclusion into the HHOF has gone from one to eight in just 11 years.\n\n1996 HHOF Class – Börje Salming (Kiruna, Sweden)\n\nSalming was one of the first European-born and trained players to come to North America and succeed in the NHL.\n\nHe started his professional hockey career in Sweden’s Division 2 in 1967 as a member of Kiruna AIF. After three seasons, Salming advanced to the top division in 1970 and won the league championship in 1971 and 1972 with Brynäs. On May 12, 1973, he signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs after being discovered by scout Gerry McNamara. On Oct. 10, 1973, Salming made his NHL debut, earning an assist in a 7-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres. Moreover, after 39 points in 75 games, he finished third in the Calder Trophy voting and fifth in the Norris Trophy voting.\n\nOver the next six seasons, Salming set career highs in points (78 in 1977) and games played (80 in 1978), earning an All-Star selection yearly. He never won the Norris Trophy, but during this stretch, he never finished lower than fourth in the voting and was runner-up in 1977 and 1980.\n\nRelated: Remembering Borje Salming: “King” of Maple Leafs’ Defensemen\n\nSalming played 1,099 games with the Maple Leafs (third all-time), scoring 148 goals and adding 620 assists (a franchise record) for 768 points (fourth). He never shied away from contact and racked up 1,292 penalty minutes (fifth). When his time in Toronto ended, he signed as a free agent with the Detroit Red Wings, suiting up for 49 games in 1989-90.\n\nUpon retirement, Salming received several accolades, including enshrinement into the Hockey Hall of Fame (1996) and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame in 1998. The Hockey News listed him as No. 74 in the top 100 Greatest NHL Players, and the Maple Leafs retired his No. 21 jersey in 2006. In 2008, the IIHF named him a member of the Centennial All-Star team.\n\nSalming made headlines in July 2022 when he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease. Months later, he made his first public appearance, informing the world that he could no longer speak and had to receive his meals through a feeding tube. Before his passing on Nov. 22, 2022, his family created the Böjre Salming ALS Foundation, a lasting tribute to all those who continue to fight the incurable disease.\n\n2012 HHOF Class – Mats Sundin (Bromma, Sweden)\n\nMats Sundin became the first European-born player to be selected first overall in an NHL Entry Draft when the Quebec Nordiques called his name on Jun. 17, 1989. As of 2022, he remains one of only two Swedish players (Rasmus Dahlin, 2018) drafted from the top spot.\n\nIn 1989, as a member of Djurgårdens IF in Sweden, Sundin won a league championship before moving to North America in 1990. He debuted on Oct. 4, scoring a goal in his first game. Two seasons later, in 1992-93, he set a career-high with 114 points before Quebec dealt him to the Maple Leafs at the 1994 Draft.\n\nRelated: NHL Draft History: Ranking Sweden’s Best First Rounders\n\nWhen he landed in Toronto, Sundin was already a star on the rise. During his 13 years with the Maple Leafs, he became a Hall of Famer, 10 as team captain. Although he only won one award during his time with the club, he did become the franchise’s leader in goals (420) and points (987). Considered one of the best players in the illustrious history of the Maple Leafs, Sundin never led his club to a Stanley Cup Final appearance, making him one of the game’s best never to lift the Silver Chalice.\n\nUpon retirement in 2009, Sundin remained the only Swedish player to score 500 goals (564) and collect over 1,300 points (1,349). He ranks second in games played (1,346), third in assists (785), and sixth in penalty minutes (1,093) amongst Sweden-born players. Internationally, Sundin was captain of the Sweden team that won Olympic Gold at the 2006 Turin Games. He also earned gold medals at the World Championships in 1991, 1992, and 1998, along with silver medals in 1990 and 2003.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, 2012, the HHOF welcomed Sundin before the IIHF called in 2013. The Maple Leafs retired his jersey No. 13 in 2011, and the NHL named him one of the 100 Greatest Players in league history.\n\n2014 HHOF Class – Peter Forberg (Örnsköldsvik, Sweden)\n\nPeter Forsberg began his professional hockey career with MoDo Hockey in Sweden, first at the junior level and then as a senior player. The Philadelphia Flyers drafted him as the sixth overall pick in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, the highest European player selected that year. Before the superstar even made his NHL debut, the Flyers traded him to the Nordiques in a package for Eric Lindros, who refused to sign with Quebec.\n\nWhile in Sweden, Forsberg’s reputation grew after winning a gold medal at the 1992 World Championships and back-to-back silver medals at the 1992 and 1993 World Junior Championships. Furthermore, at the 1993 tournament, Forsberg set an IIHF junior record with 31 points in seven games, a mark untouched over 30 years later. However, his crowning achievement internationally occurred a season later, when he scored the decisive goal in the shootout to help Sweden to their first gold medal at the Winter Olympics.\n\nRelated: Revisiting Sweden’s World Junior Championship History\n\nAfter all that success, Forsberg finally came to North America to play with the Nordiques. He won the Calder Trophy in his rookie season (1995) before winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche, who moved from Quebec in 1996. Five seasons later, he would lift the Cup again (2001) despite not finishing the playoffs after having his spleen removed.\n\nIn 2003, he became the first Swedish-born player to win the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer) and Hart Memorial Trophy (Most Valuable Player). Three years later, Forsberg became a member of the Swedish team that won the Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Winter Games, adding to his international medal count (nine). By this time, he was already a member of the Triple Gold Club (Stanley Cup, Olympic Gold Medal, and World Championship). Still, he enhanced his legacy by becoming just the third hockey player to earn the honors twice.\n\nInjuries plagued Forsberg’s career, which cut into his playing time and final career statistics. Regarding his ranks amongst Sweden players all-time, he sits eighth with 885 points in just 708 games and 12th overall in penalty minutes with 690. His final career plus/minus rating is plus-238, second to Niklas Lidstrom’s plus-450. In NHL rankings, Forsberg’s 1.25 points-per-game average ranks 12th all-time.\n\nForsberg retired from the NHL in 2011, and the Avalanche raised his jersey No. 21 to the rafters later that year. In 2013, he was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame before earning his place in the HHOF (2014) in his first year of eligibility. Later, in 2017, Forsberg was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players.\n\n2015 HHOF Class – Nicklas Lidström (Vasteras, Sweden)\n\nThe Red Wings found their franchise defenceman, Nicklas Lidström, with the 53rd pick in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. After playing in the Sweden Elitserien and winning a World Championship in 1991, he made his NHL debut on Oct. 3, 1991. For the next 20 seasons, he would patrol the blue line for Detroit, advancing to the playoffs every season of his career, an NHL record for a player with one team.\n\nLidström won four Stanley Cups in 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008, becoming the first European-born and trained captain to hoist the Cup in 2008. Between 2001 and 2011, he would win the Norris Trophy seven times, with three-peats from 2001-2003 and 2006-2008, with his last one in 2011. He ranks second all-time in wins behind Bobby Orr, who won the award eight times from 1967-1975.\n\nDuring his career, Lidström earned NHL All-Rookie honors in 1992, played in 12 All-Star games, and was named to 10 first All-Star team selections. In 2002, he became the first European to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. As a defenceman, Lidström ranks fourth all-time in Red Wings history with 1,142 points, just one of four players with over 1,000 points. He is second behind Gordie Howe in games played (1,687), third in assists (878), and 11th in goals (264).\n\nRelated: Swedish-Born Players With the Most Stanley Cups\n\nInternationally, Lidström earned four medals, earning his place in the Triple Gold Club, thanks to a 1991 World Championship and 2006 Olympic Gold Medal. He is credited with the winning goal in 2006 and earned an Olympic All-Star team selection.\n\nLidström holds at least 13 records with the Red Wings and 18 NHL records. In 2014, the Red Wings retired his jersey No. 5, and the IIHF welcomed him into their Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame before the HHOF honored him with a plaque in 2015. Several years later, the IIHF named Lidström to the All-Time Sweden Team in 2020.\n\n2022 HHOF Class – Daniel Alfredsson (Vasteras, Sweden)\n\nDaniel Alfredsson is undoubtedly the best skater in the history of the Ottawa Senators, leading every major category, goals (426), assists (682), and points (1,108). On top of that, he was the franchise’s longest-serving captain, wearing the “C” on his sweater from 1999 to 2013. Unfortunately, he didn’t play his entire career in Canada’s Captain City, signing with the Red Wings for one season in 2013-14.\n\nAlfredsson’s rookie season, 1995-96, saw him win the Calder Trophy with 61 points in 82 games, becoming only the second Swedish to win the award after Forsberg the previous year. In addition to the Calder, he also won the King Clancy Award in 2011-12 and the Mark Messier Leadership Award in 2012-13. Moreover, he represented the Senators at six All-Star Games.\n\nRelated: NHL Awards History: Sweden Has Seen Success\n\nOn the international stage, Alfredsson was a standout player during his era with Sweden, winning two World Championship Silver Medals (1995, 2004), two World Championship Bronze Medals (1999, 2001), and an Olympic Gold (2006) and Silver Medal (2014). During the lockout in 2004, he played in the Elitserian with Frölunda HC, scoring the most goals (12) and points (18) en route to a Le Mat Trophy win.\n\nBecause of his contributions on and off the ice, Alfredsson was inducted into the IIHF Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018, followed by the HHOF in 2022. Regarding his place among Sweden-born players, he ranks second to Sundin in goals (444) and points (1,157) while sitting behind Lidstrom, H. Sedin, Sundin, and Nicklas Backstrom in assists (713).\n\n2022 HHOF Class – Henrik Sedin (Vasteras, Sweden)\n\nHenrik Sedin was drafted third overall at the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, one spot after his twin brother Daniel. As the set-up artist of the two, it’s no surprise that Henrik ranks first in every major scoring category with the Vancouver Canucks except goals. As of 2024, his place in team history includes the most games played (1,330), assists (830), and points (1,070).\n\nHenrik also had the privilege of serving as team captain, a role he held from 2010 to 2018. Under his leadership, the Canucks won the Presidents’ Trophy in back-to-back years (2011, 2012), eventually losing in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final in 2011. His list of NHL achievements includes an Art Ross Trophy (2010) and the Hart Trophy (2010). Additionally, Henrik won the King Clancy Trophy twice (2016 and 2018) and skated in three All-Star Games.\n\nRelated: Swedish-Born Captains in NHL History – The Hockey Writers\n\nUnfortunately, Henrik did not win the Stanley Cup during his playing days, preventing him from joining the Triple Gold Club. But, he won an Olympic Gold Medal (2006) and a World Championship (2013). Henrik won a TV-Pucken Gold Medal (1995) and Best Forward (1996) in Sweden. In Elitserien, he was voted the league’s best player in 1999 when MoDo Hockey lost in the championship series. In his second season, he was an All-Star, voted Sweden’s Junior Player of the Year, and won another Silver Medal after another loss in the Elitserien Final.\n\nAs of 2024, Henrik has yet to be inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame. But with several international accolades, including two World Championship Bronze Medals (1999 and 2001), leading the U20 WJC tournament with 13 points in 2000, and winning Sweden’s Best Player Award in 2010, his induction into the HHOF only furthers his case to be in the IIHF Hall of Fame someday.\n\n2022 HHOF Class – Daniel Sedin (Vasteras, Sweden)\n\nDaniel Sedin is the Canucks all-time leading goal scorer, with 393 tallies, while ranking behind his brother Henrik in every other category. Today, the twins remain the only players in Vancouver history to collect more than a thousand career points.\n\nDuring his 17-year career, Daniel won an Art Ross (2011) and Lester B. Pearson Award (2011) and claimed a King Clancy Award in 2018. He participated in three NHL All-Star Games. Because he was almost inseparable from his brother, their achievements are identical. However, their international resumes are a little bit different.\n\nIn 1995, Daniel won a TV-Pucken Gold Medal, and in 1998, he was voted Best Forward in the U18 EJC, winning a Gold Medal and leading the tournament with the most points. Daniel was the Elitserien Best Player within a year, winning a silver medal and being named Swedish Junior Player of the Year.\n\nRelated: All-Time Sweden-Born NHL Lineup\n\nThe following season, he started in the league’s All-Star Game, scored the most goals in the playoffs, and won a Silver Medal for the second consecutive season. Meanwhile, he scored the most goals at the U20 WJC tournament and was named to the Sweden All-Star Team.\n\nLike Henrik, Daniel’s trophy case includes Olympic Gold and Silver Medals, two World Championship Bronze Medals, and a Gold Medal. He is not a member of the IIHF Hall of Fame but has a resume worthy of induction. The Sedin brothers rank in the top five in terms of points among Sweden players, while Daniel ranks fifth in goals and Henrik 21st. As playmakers, Henrik is second, and Daniel is sixth.\n\n2023 HHOF Class – Henrik Lundqvist (Vasteras, Sweden)\n\nHenrik Lundqvist is the latest Swedish-born player inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. As arguably the greatest European-born netminder in professional hockey history, he is undeniably the best goalie to play in the NHL and never win the Stanley Cup. The one-time Vezina Trophy winner (2012) came close in 2014, leading the New York Rangers to the Final, only to lose in five games.\n\nHenrik, known as “The King,” played his entire 15-year career on Broadway with the Blueshirts. He ranks first among netminders in games played (887), wins (459), losses (310), shutouts (64), minutes played (51,615:51), and points (27). Regarding Lundqvist’s place in NHL history, he is ninth in games played, sixth in wins, 15th in losses and 17th in shutouts.\n\nDespite only winning the Vezina Trophy once in his career, he was a top-three finalist on four occasions and ranked among the top 10 from 2005 to 2015. He played in five NHL All-Star Games and was named to the league’s All-Rookie Team in 2006.\n\nRelated: Top 10 Swedish-born Goalies in NHL History\n\nAs another legendary player from Sweden who never won the Stanley Cup, Lundqvist’s work in his native country and international hockey ranks among the best of all time. His lengthy resume includes an Olympic Gold (2006) and Silver Medal (2014), plus a World Championship, which he won with his twin brother Joel in 2017.\n\nBefore taking his act to North America, Lundqvist was a two-time J20 SM Gold Medalist (2000 and 2001), plus won a U18 WJC Bronze Medal, a Viking Cup Top Goaltender Award, and was named Swedish Junior Player of the Year. In Elitserian, he was a two-time league champion (2003 and 2005), voted the Swedish Goalie of the Year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, while becoming the Elitserian Most Valuable Player in 2005. He was an All-Star numerous times and led the league in GAA and SV% twice.\n\nBy getting inducted into the HHOF in 2023, Lundqvist became the first Swedish netminder to receive the honor and is only one of three goalies born outside North America besides Tretiak and Dominic Hasek to have a plaque in Toronto. He was forced into early retirement in 2020 after learning he required heart surgery and would not be capable of handling the everyday routines of a professional hockey player. He documented his journey and recovery in Open Heart.\n\nThe 2025 Hockey Hall of Fame Class and Beyond\n\nRight now, the top five highest-scoring Swedish-born players are all in the HHOF. Backstrom is the only active player (currently on a leave of absence with the Washington Capitals) from his home country with 1,000 points (1,033). When he retires, the debates will begin on whether he earns a plaque, too.\n\nRelated: Top 10 Swedes in the NHL Today\n\nMeanwhile, the next player with a solid chance of getting a call someday is Henrik Zetterberg, who is seventh all-time in points and has a lot of hardware in his trophy case. Should these two make it in, the country’s top-eight players, based on points, would all be together in Toronto.\n\nA handful of players, including Erik Karlsson (San Jose), Victor Hedman (Tampa Bay), Mika Zibanejad (New York), Filip Forsberg (Nashville), and William Nylander (Toronto), are still working on their HHOF resumes."
