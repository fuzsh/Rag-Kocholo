        "text": "Swedish ice hockey player\n\nIce hockey player\n\nDouglas Thomas Lars Murray (born 12 March 1980), nicknamed \"Crankshaft\",[1] is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman. He was drafted in the 8th round, 241st overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMurray's Swedish mother is a daughter of Lasse Björn, an ice hockey defenceman, two-time world champion and Olympic bronze medalist. His father's ancestors originate from Scotland. While his cousins all have Swedish names, his parents gave their children Scottish or English names. Murray's brothers are named Charles and Ted, and a sister is named Roseanna.[2]\n\nMurray attended Portledge School in Locust Valley, New York, for his junior and senior years of high school, and played for the New York Apple Core in nearby Long Beach, before attending Cornell University. He graduated from Cornell in 2003 with a B.S. degree in hotel administration.[3]\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1999–2000 to 2002–03, he played for Cornell University. While at Cornell, he served as captain his senior year and was twice named a first team All-American. He was nominated to the Hobey Baker Memorial Award Final Ten in 2003. In the 2003–04 and the locked-out 2004–05 season he played for San Jose's minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Barons, and contributed both offensively and defensively, leading the team in plus/minus and being second on the team in points for a defenseman. He also served as an alternate captain. He was awarded the Cleveland Barons Rubbermaid \"Player of the Year\" (along with Josh Gorges) in 2005.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 NHL season, he was called up to San Jose, due to various injuries plaguing the team's defense. In his short time there that season, he gained praise for his physical presence, as well as solid defense, from such San Jose organization members as TV color commentator Drew Remenda.\n\nMurray renewed his contract with the Sharks in June 2006, signing a three-year deal worth US$1.65 million. Part of that deal was a $150,000 signing bonus.[citation needed] In late September 2008, he agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Sharks supposedly worth US$10 million.[4]\n\nHis first NHL goal was scored in his 115th career game on 21 February 2008, against Martin Biron of the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nIn the pre-season game of 26 September 2009, Murray performed a hat trick, scoring 3 even strength goals against the Anaheim Ducks, leading to the 6–0 shutout victory, though it was unofficial due to it being in the pre-season. If it had been in the regular season, it would have been his first and only career NHL hat trick.\n\nIn 2010, he was chosen as the 16th-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News.[5]\n\nOn 25 March 2013, the Sharks traded Murray to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Pittsburgh's second round pick in the 2013 draft and a conditional second round pick in 2014. The Sharks later received the conditional pick due to Pittsburgh's progression through two rounds in the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs.[6]\n\nOn 22 August 2013, Murray signed as a free agent to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million with the Montreal Canadiens.[7]\n\nHe was not re-signed by the Canadiens at the end of his contract and unable to attract NHL interest, signed a one-year deal with Kölner Haie of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga on 20 January 2015.[8] In the 2014–15 season, Murray was limited to just 8 appearances with the Kölner Haie before suffering injury. On 13 March 2015, Murray returned to North America and signed a professional try-out contract to practice with the Calgary Flames.[9]\n\nMurray announced his retirement on 21 October 2016.[10]\n\nInternational play\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2008 IIHF World Championship, Murray checked Russian player Aleksey Morozov out of the game. Morozov suffered a severe concussion,[citation needed] while Murray received a match penalty.[11]\n\nMurray represented Sweden in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the fourth season of the Parneviks reality show in 2018, Murray was in a relationship with Penny Parnevik (born 1997), daughter of professional golfer Jesper Parnevik. On 1 February 2019 the couple were engaged.[12] Their son, named Atticus, was born in 2019.[13] The couple married in June 2022. [14]\n\nMurray is the co-founder and managing partner of Uber Dispensing Co, which manufactures the UberTap, a hands-free three-spout keg tap invented by Murray and several friends from Cornell. Coincidentally, while Murray represented Sweden in ice hockey at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, another of the company's co-founders, Jamie Moriarty, represented the U.S. in four-man bobsled at the same Olympics. He rang the bell at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the summer of 2006.[15]\n\nAs of 24 April 2019 Murray was pursuing several business ventures in Northern California and serving as president and director of the Sharks Alumni Foundation.[12]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1996–97 Djurgårdens IF J20 4 0 0 0 6 — — — — — 1998–99 New York Apple Core EJHL 60 17 47 64 62 — — — — — 1999–00 Cornell Big Red ECAC 32 3 6 9 38 — — — — — 2000–01 Cornell Big Red ECAC 25 5 13 18 39 — — — — — 2001–02 Cornell Big Red ECAC 35 11 21 32 67 — — — — — 2002–03 Cornell Big Red ECAC 35 5 20 25 30 — — — — — 2003–04 Cleveland Barons AHL 72 10 12 22 75 9 3 0 3 37 2004–05 Cleveland Barons AHL 54 6 17 23 56 — — — — — 2005–06 Cleveland Barons AHL 20 1 7 8 37 — — — — — 2005–06 San Jose Sharks NHL 34 0 1 1 27 — — — — — 2006–07 San Jose Sharks NHL 35 0 3 3 31 — — — — — 2006–07 Worcester Sharks AHL 5 2 1 3 8 — — — — — 2007–08 San Jose Sharks NHL 66 1 9 10 98 13 1 1 2 2 2008–09 San Jose Sharks NHL 75 0 7 7 38 6 0 0 0 9 2009–10 San Jose Sharks NHL 79 4 13 17 66 15 1 6 7 8 2010–11 San Jose Sharks NHL 73 1 13 14 44 18 0 1 1 8 2011–12 San Jose Sharks NHL 60 0 4 4 31 5 0 0 0 19 2012–13 Djurgårdens IF Allsv 14 1 2 3 36 — — — — — 2012–13 San Jose Sharks NHL 29 0 3 3 26 — — — — — 2012–13 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 14 1 2 3 9 15 2 1 3 32 2013–14 Montreal Canadiens NHL 53 0 2 2 42 3 0 0 0 0 2014–15 Kölner Haie DEL 8 0 1 1 24 — — — — — NHL totals 518 7 57 64 412 75 4 9 13 78\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 2008 Sweden WC 4th 5 0 0 0 27 2010 Sweden OG 5th 4 0 0 0 0 Senior totals 9 0 0 0 27\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team 2001 All-ECAC Hockey First Team 2001–02 AHCA East First-Team All-American 2001–02 ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team 2002 All-ECAC Hockey First Team 2002–03 AHCA East First-Team All-American 2002–03 ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team 2003\n\nRecords\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Jose Sharks record for hits in a game – 9 (tie) – set 2 April 2011[16]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Eurohockey.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database\n\nCornell Big Red profile\n\nUber Dispensing Company home page"
