        "text": "1. Tandem Lift Operation Study Presented By Pier-side Services Section of Operation Department,YICT\n\n2. The aim To Study Tandem Lift Operation VOC From 150 to 200boxes/h; Speed up the operation procedure; Enhance the crane operation rate. According to the study of handling box weight: The Probability of 2 X 40� XF combination: 99.97% Probability of 2 X 40� IF combination: 52.23%\n\n3. The Schedule We are on the test state now; It began on Nov.2004; The equipments were installed on July,2005; The fist QC was launched to use on Aug.2005; The second QC was fixed tandem on Oct.2005,and was put into test on Nov.2005.\n\n4. The Brand of Tandem Spreader We introduced two different tandem spreader brands :RAM and BROMMA; RAM Tandem Spreader System are fixed on QC38; BROMMA Tandem Spreader System are fixed on QC33;\n\n5. The RAM Tandem System\n\n6. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system structure: 1 Head block+2 new type spreaders; The head block suit to RAM and BRAMMA spreader; The two spreaders are connected to the head block by pins; The head block can hang 1 and 2 same spreader;\n\n7. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system functions: Using two units of existing RAM2420/BROMMA: Single 20ft/40ft/45ft capacity:(Same to normal) 1 X 20ft: 41T 1 X 40ft/45ft: 41T Tandem lift capacity (designed according to twin move): 2 X 20ft/40ft: 2 X 24T\n\n8. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system functions: Using two units of Light Weight Spreader to load: Single 40ft/45ft capacity: 1 X 40ft/45ft: 41T Tandem lift capacity (designed according to twin move): 2 X 40ft/45ft: 2 X 24T\n\n9. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system functions: Handling the hatch cover: using one spreader of Tandem lift to handle: 1 X 40T(Maximum weight) Hoist speed:20% Trolley speed:50%\n\n10. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system functions: Gap Adjustment between two spreader:0�1300mm; Skew Angle of:+/-5 degrees; Longitudinal Offset of:+/-300 mm; Vertical float of:500 mm; Tilting Angle of:+/-3 degrees; Listing Angle of:+/-5 degree.\n\n11. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system functions limits: Using two units of Light Weight Spreader to operate :prohibit to handle 20ft box Gap Adjustment between two spreader:0�1300mm is inadequate, cause the two tractors alinement difficult. The rating load is 2X24T,the allowance weight of container operation range is limited.\n\n12. The RAM Tandem System RAM tandem system operations performance Till now: We have tested 20 times using RAM tandem system the even GCR is: 45.48MPH\n\n13. The BROMMA Tandem System\n\n14. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system structure: 1 Head block+2 sel-carried spreaders; The head block suit to RAM and BRAMMA spreader; The two spreaders are connected to the head block by chains; The head block can carry 1 and 2 same spreader;\n\n15. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system functions: Using two units of sel-carried BROMMA spreaders: Single 20ft/40ft/45ft capacity:(Same to normal) 1 X 20ft: 41T 1 X 40ft/45ft: 41T Tandem lift capacity: 2 X 20ft/40ft: 2 X 30.5T\n\n16. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system functions: Gap Adjustment between two spreader:0�1300mm; Skew Angle of:+/-3 degrees; Longitudinal Offset of:+/-300 mm; Vertical float of:380 mm; Trim Angle of:+/-3 degrees.\n\n17. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system functions: Handling the hatch cover: using one spreader of Tandem lift to handle: 1 X 41T(Maximum weight) Hoist speed:100% Trolley speed:100%\n\n18. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system functions limits: The existing spreaders can not be fixed on the tandem head block (because the different connection method) Gap Adjustment between two spreader:0�1300mm is inadequate, cause the two tractors alinement difficult. The head block is wider than the cell pin lead to can not handle the 20ft container in hold\n\n19. The BROMMA Tandem System BROMMA tandem system operations performance Till now: We have tested 4 times using RAM tandem system the even GCR is: 44.77MPH\n\n20. The Mode of Tandem Operations Tractor alinement mode Using �Smart Cone� alinement system; Tractor aline to the midline on the lane separation area;\n\n21. The Mode of Tandem Operations Discharge the twist-lock procedure Set up Twist-lock Unlock Area; Tractor need to be sent to Twist-lock Unlock Area discharge twist-lock first; Prohibit to unlock twist-lock under the crane.\n\n22. The Tandem Operation Test"
