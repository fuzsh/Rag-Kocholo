        "text": "Feb. 12, 2016\n\nLive Scoring / GolfWeek Rankings / GolfStat Rankings / Season Stats / LPR Record Book\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The 19th-ranked Purdue women's golf team opens its spring slate this weekend, hosting the 14th-annual Lady Puerto Rico Classic at the Rio Mar Country Club River Course Sunday through Tuesday. The Boilermakers finished fifth at the star-studded event last season, shooting 22-over par, 890, led by August Kim's sixth-place individual finish of one-over, 217.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe 2016 Lady Puerto Rico Classic field features another collection of the nation's best, including five teams from last season's NCAA Championships, six of the current top-25 ranked teams and 11 of the top-50. The field should also boast eight of the top-25 individually ranked players, including four of the top-10. Arkansas returns to the tournament, looking to win its third straight Lady Puerto Rico Classic, while Auburn returns to the mix after winning the event title in 2005 and 2007. Other standout teams in the field include 2015 Big Ten Champions Northwestern and 2015 MAC Champions Kent State.\n\nTeamGolfWeekGolfStatGeorgia48Northwestern55Kent State77Arkansas84Iowa State1716Purdue2024Texas Tech2626Clemson2927North Carolina State3030Louisville3332Michigan3941TCU4549Augusta State5253Auburn6257Indiana7066Maryland----\n\nTHE COURSE: Rio Mar Country Club: River Course\n\nThe Lady Puerto Rico Classic will be played in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico for the eighth straight year, moving there from San Juan in 2009, and will be hosted by the Rio Mar Country Club's River Course for the sixth straight year, after moving from the Trump International Championship Course in 2011. PGA legend Greg Norman designed the Rio Mar Country Club River Course along the Mameyes. Married with the lay of the land, the island itself dictates the holes. The result is a course for all skill levels, full of native foliage, generous fairways and shallow bunkers.\n\nAT THIS EVENT\n\nPurdue has won the Lady Puerto Rico Classic just once, taking the title in 2009, and has finished in the top-five six other times, including a runner-up showing in 2006 and a fifth-place effort last year. Then-sophomore August Kim was their top individual, tying for sixth-place at one-over, 217, while Anna Appert Lund and Marta Martin were just outside the top-25 at seven-over, 223. Kim had the Boilermakers' top individual round marks, shooting even-par, 72, on each of the first two days.\n\nTHE PLAYERS (Career Stats)\n\nPLAYERHOMETOWNRDS.AVG.TOP 10LOW 18LOW 54Linn AnderssonJonkoping, Sweden2475.7170215Anna Appert LundBromma, Sweden10175.11566209August KimSt. Augustine, Fla.7276.3368214Marta MartinMadrid, Spain4375.0269217Melati PutriDenpasar, Bali978.0-72226Covi SanJuanAviles, Spain-----------"
