        "text": "Women's Basketball Starts Three-Game Home Stand on Thursday\n\nThe Warriors will host Lake Erie on Thursday and No. 4 Ashland on Saturday.\n\nWomen's Basketball | 1/20/2016 5:09:00 PM\n\nDETROIT -- The Wayne State University women's basketball team (7-9 overall, 2-8 GLIAC) begins its second three-game home stand of the month on Jan. 21 as the Lake Erie Storm visit the Matthaei. Ashland travels to Detroit on Jan. 23 for a 1 p.m. tip-off with the Malone contest on Jan. 28 concluding the six home games in a seven-game span. WSU will then play six of its next seven on the road, before completing regular-season play at home vs. Walsh (Feb. 20) and Findlay (Feb. 25).\n\nThe Ashland contest will be sponsored by the Athletic Alumni Association. There will be a silent auction as well as 50/50 raffle tickets available for purchase. All donations collected will benefit the women's basketball program.\n\nIN THE RANKS\n\nThrough games of Jan. 20, WSU was ranked in the top-75 nationally in five statistical categories. The Warriors were 51st in total steals (159), 57th in steals per game (9.9), 59th in scoring offense (72.2), 67th in field-goal percentage (42.2%) and 73rd in opponent three-point field goal percentage (29.1%). Individually, sophomore Shannon Wilson was 16th in assist/turnover ratio at 2.54, while senior Brittany Streetman was 39th in total steals (40) and 40th in steals per game (2.50).\n\nIn GLIAC games through Jan. 16, the Warriors are second in both opponent three-point field goal percentage and field-goal attempts per game (64.8), third in both offensive rebounds per game (13.8) and opponent field-goal percentage (39.2%) and fourth in field-goals made per game (27.3).\n\nLAST WEEK'S RECAP\n\nThe Warriors ended a four-game losing streak with a 72-69 triumph over Tiffin on Jan. 14. Seniors Brittany Streetman and Ashley Wilson each scored 17 points in the win over the Dragons, while Shannon Wilson chipped in 10 points to go with six rebounds and six assists. Wayne State lost 111-106 in double overtime on Jan. 16 at Ohio Dominican in the highest scoring league game in GLIAC history. The 106 points by the Warriors were the most-ever by a losing team in GLIAC history (previous was 101 by Grand Valley State in a 106-101 loss to Ashland on Jan. 23, 1997, in the previous highest scoring game in the GLIAC). WSU had three end of the quarter buzzer-beating shots in the contest as Kristen Long grabbed a loose ball and made a jumper from just beyond the foul line as the first quarter clock expired. Shannon Wilson connected on a long three just before halftime after the Warrior defense forced an over-and-back and she took the in bounds pass with 3.4 seconds left. Long hauled in a long in-bounds pass from Streetman and banked in an off-balance three to send the game into overtime. Ashley Wilson scored a season-high 26 points, while playing 41 minutes off the bench. She also had nine defensive rebounds. Payton Birchmeier notched her first collegiate double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds, including 3-of-4 from long range. Shannon Wilson contributed 18 points, while Streetman added 14 points with both hitting three triples.\n\nCENTURY MARK IN GAMES PLAYED\n\nOn Jan. 3, seniors Brittany Streetman and Kristen Long became just the eighth set of teammates in school history to reach the 100-game played plateau in the same season. The last duo was Deanna Crumpton and Phaebre Colbert three years ago. The first set was WSU Hall of Famer Pearly Cunningham and Ann Roy in 1985-86. The 1994-95 squad had three teammates in Wendy Winter, Missy Cochran and Jennifer Berrios to reach the century plateau.\n\nWSU has played 108 games over the last four seasons compiling a 75-33 record. Streetman and Kristen Long both played in every game as freshmen, their junior season and this year. They each missed games as a sophomore -- Long (1/9 vs. Hillsdale, 1/11 vs. Findlay) and Streetman dressed but did not play (12/18 at Ashland). Last Sunday's game at Ferris State was the 100th game they both had played in together.\n\nAccording to the NCAA Division II women's basketball active career leader stats, Streetman is tied-for-21st in games played and Long is tied-for-25th. The WSU school record is 113 by Lisa Gentry (1981-85). If Streetman doesn't miss any of the upcoming games, she will equal Gentry's record on Feb. 6 vs. Ohio Dominican at home.\n\nLong became the 31st player in school history to play 2,000 minutes in the Tiffin contest on Jan. 14, while Streetman was the 32nd Warrior to meet this feat against the Dragons.\n\nStreetman is eighth in school history with 117 made three pointers, while Long is 23rd with 169 assists.\n\nSCOUTING THE STORM\n\nLake Erie ended a seven-game conference losing streak with a 52-46 home court win over Malone on Jan. 14. Sophomore guard Kayla Gabor is leading the Storm in scoring (14.6 points per game), rebounding (5.5 rpg) and three-pointers made (21), while playing over 30 minutes a contest. Senior guard Shelby Carpenter has a team-high 49 steals and is second in scoring (8.8 ppg). Sophomore center Christine Dawson leads the squad in blocked shots (28), while senior guard Sami Narducci has a team-best 46 assists.\n\nSCOUTING THE EAGLES\n\nAshland is ranked fourth in the Jan. 19 WBCA Division II Coaches Poll with an undefeated record of 16-0. The last time, the Eagles were unbeaten this last in the season was their national championship tem of 2012-13, which began the year with 24 straight wins. Sophomore duo Andi Daugherty and Laina Snyder both lead the Eagles in scoring (15.2 ppg), while senior guard McKenzie Miller records 10.3 points a game. Snyder ranks fifth in the GLIAC with 8.8 rebounds per contest, while Miller is first in assists a game (4.7) and third with a 44.7 three-point field goal percentage.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES\n\nWayne State has a 6-2 advantage in the all-time series against LEC, including a 3-1 mark both at home and on the road. After losing the series opener at the Matthaei, the Warriors have won the last three meetings in Midtown Detroit.\n\nThe Warriors trail 15-33 versus Ashland in the all-time series which began in Nov. 1983. WSU broke a five-game losing stretch with a 87-78 victory on the road in 2013. Wayne State lost both contests against the Eagles last season.\n\nSTREETMAN HITS A MILESTONE\n\nPlaying in her 100th career game on Dec. 30, senior Brittany Streetman moved into ninth place on the WSU all-time list for three-pointers made with three triples against Cedarville.\n\nStreetman passed Beth Wilson (1988-92) and trails Julie Filpus (1990-94) by 15 for seventh place.\n\nThis season, Streetman is averaging a team-best 12.8 points per game and is shooting 33.8 percent (26-for-77) from beyond the arc. She has scored in double figures 11 times this year and tallied a career-high 26 points against Lewis. The Cedarville contest marked her fourth game this year of at least 20 points. Streetman ranks 12th in school history (min. 30 made) with a 33.3 career three-point field goal percentage (117-351).\n\nCONSISTENT LEADERSHIP\n\nHead coach Carrie Lohr is in her fifth season and has an 87-46 (.654) record at WSU, along with 253-152 (.625) career mark. The Jan. 2 game at Grand Valley State marked her 400th as a collegiate head coach (272 at SC4 and 127 currently at WSU). Lohr is the second coach to lead the Warriors to the NCAA Tournament, but the first coach to have its squad earn an NCAA Tournament bid three straight seasons, including a trip to the Midwest Regional Championship game in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSHARETA MAKING A STATEMENT OVERSEAS\n\nFormer Warrior All-American and WBCA Division II Player of the Year, Shareta Brown (2013-15) signed a professional contract with Alvik (Bromma, Sweden) earlier in December.\n\nIn her first game on Jan. 13, Brown led the team with 16 points and 12 rebounds, including going 6-for10 from the field and 4-for-6 from the charity, in a 73-65 win over third-ranked Telge.\n\nBrown chipped in a team-high 23 points and dished out four helpers in a 90-66 victory over second-ranked Udominate on Jan. 17.\n\nCOMCAST/XFINITY\n\nEvery women's basketball home game in 2016 will be broadcast live throughout the state of Michigan on Comcast CN900. Sean Baligian, Rod Beard, and Joe Abramson will call the action.\n\nWARRIOR ALL-ACCESS\n\nAll Wayne State home women's basketball games can be watched via Warrior All-Access for a $5.95 per game fee. All nine home contests in 2016 will be available on All-Access from the Comcast feed.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nWayne State will conclude its three-game home stand with a 5:30 p.m. tip against Malone on Jan. 28 before traveling to North Canton, Ohio to take on Walsh on Jan. 30 for a 1 p.m. start.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
