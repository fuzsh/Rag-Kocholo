How to create want variable?

Note:Want is new character variable It should be in right side.

It IS right-aligned. Just take a short look at the result I posted. Note that most output destinations apart from LISTING will automatically left-align all character values, and discard any leading blanks. But that does NOT change the value stored in the variables. If you want further proof, run this:

data want; set have; length char $8; char = right(put(number,best8.)); char_hex = put(char,$hex16.); run;

and you will see the blanks (hex 20) in the variable.

Please state exactly what you are aiming for.

Hi @thanikondharish

I agree with @Kurt_Bremser

Don't rely on the viewer to assess the alignment (the font has not the same size for all characters : a dot is "smaller" than a digit, ..)

As an alternative to the right function, you can also use the '-r' modifier in the put statement:

char=put(number, best8. -r);

Best,

In the code example I gave you, you can see in the hex display that there are NO trailing spaces stored AT ALL.

If you run different code, show us.

There is no correct alignment as my point of view

In my occasionally humble opinion the alignment of values in a data set is completely irrelevant.

Since alignment really only affects people reading the data for most cases then when the data is written out in a report is when any alignment becomes important. And the reporting procedures have a number of methods to adjust alignment.

Of if the data is to be written to a text file read by another program then use appropriate syntax to align things at the time the text file is created.
