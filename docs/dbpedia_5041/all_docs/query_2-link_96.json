        "text": "While learning a new program, it is often quite exciting to explore the extensive capabilities at your fingertips; however, it can also be a little overwhelming at times when there is a lot to take in. But, don't worry. Today, I will share a few easy tips and tricks for all those beginning their journey with Adobe Illustrator.\n\nSo, what does it take to make graphics attractive? Good design? Vibrant colors? Exciting 2d animation? Did I miss anything? What about the alignment or distribution between two or more objects?\n\nImagine a graphic with distorted alignment and non-uniform distribution. Did that impress you? No, right?\n\nTherefore, to make the graphics more attractive, it's quite essential to manage the alignment and distribution between the objects. And that's why we should have a good knowledge of alignment and distribution.\n\nAdobe Illustrator allows for very precise control while aligning and distributing objects. Find out how to use the Align and Distribution panel to align objects and distribute them uniformly.\n\nSo, Let's get started!\n\nWhy do you need Alignment and Distribution?\n\nWhile working with a variety of objects, you will often need to align them regularly or distribute them across a specific distance. However, you no longer need to try and figure out the math on your own and then move each object manually.\n\nInstead, you can simply apply the Alignment and Distribution functions that Illustrator's Align palette offers to align and distribute objects precisely.\n\nCool, right?\n\nGetting started with Alignment\n\nGetting Started with Distribution\n\nYou can distribute functions that appear in the bottom half of the Align palette to distribute multiple objects evenly. Illustrator takes the objects at the two extremes of the selection and uses them as the distribution boundaries. All objects between the two shapes at the extreme corners are distributed evenly, based on the specific distribution function you have selected.\n\nLet’s learn how to distribute the objects in Illustrator.\n\nWatch this video to see alignment and distribution in action.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThat's it, folks! I hope you find these Illustrator alignment and distribution tips and tricks helpful. Adobe Illustrator has a lot of exciting features in store for you. So, keep experimenting, and try out new things.\n\nRemember, both Alignment and Distribution play a very significant role in the graphics world. So, knowledge of the two will surely boost your productivity and make some challenging tasks easier for you. It entirely depends on how you use these tools to make your work easy.\n\nI hope you enjoy learning and exploring this great tool!
