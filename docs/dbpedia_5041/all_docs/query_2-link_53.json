        "text": "Text alignment\n\nThe alignment feature lets you align your content to the left or right as well as center or justify it.\n\n# Demo\n\nClick inside a paragraph or a header and use the toolbar dropdown to change the alignment of the element.\n\nThe three greatest things you learn from traveling\n\nLike all the great things on earth traveling teaches us by example. Here are some of the most precious lessons Iâve learned over the years of traveling.\n\nAppreciation of diversity\n\nGetting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging. While itâs also nice to learn about cultures online or from books, nothing comes close to experiencing cultural diversity in person. You learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences while you become more culturally fluid.\n\nThis demo presents a limited set of features. Visit the feature-rich editor example to see more in action.\n\n# Installation\n\nâ ï¸ New import paths\n\nStarting with version 42.0.0, we changed the format of import paths. This guide uses the new, shorter format. Refer to the Packages in the legacy setup guide if you use an older version of CKEditor 5.\n\nAfter installing the editor, add the feature to your plugin list and toolbar configuration:\n\nimport { ClassicEditor, Alignment } from 'ckeditor5'; ClassicEditor. create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), { plugins: [ Alignment, /* ... */ ], toolbar: [ 'alignment', /* ... */ ] } ) .then( /* ... */ ) .catch( /* ... */ );\n\n# Configuring alignment options\n\n# Defining available options\n\nIt is possible to configure which alignment options are available in the editor by setting the alignment.options configuration option. You can choose from 'left', 'right', 'center', and 'justify'.\n\nYou should always include the 'left' option for the LTR content. Similarly, you should always include the 'right' option for the RTL content. Learn more about configuring language of the editor content.\n\nFor example, the following editor will support two alignment options: to the left and to the right:\n\nClassicEditor .create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), { alignment: { options: [ 'left', 'right' ] }, toolbar: [ 'heading', '|', 'bulletedList', 'numberedList', 'alignment', 'undo', 'redo' ] } ) .then( /* ... */ ) .catch( /* ... */ );\n\nThe three greatest things you learn from traveling\n\nLike all the great things on earth traveling teaches us by example. Here are some of the most precious lessons Iâve learned over the years of traveling.\n\n# Using classes instead of inline style\n\nBy default, alignment is set inline using the text-align CSS property. If you wish the feature to output more semantic content that uses classes instead of inline styles, you can specify class names by using the className property in config.alignment.options and style them by using a style sheet.\n\nThe following configuration will set .my-align-left and .my-align-right to left and right alignment, respectively.\n\nClassicEditor .create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), { alignment: { options: [ { name: 'left', className: 'my-align-left' }, { name: 'right', className: 'my-align-right' } ] }, toolbar: [ 'heading', '|', 'bulletedList', 'numberedList', 'alignment', 'undo', 'redo' ] } ) .then( /* ... */ ) .catch( /* ... */ );\n\n# Configuring the toolbar\n\nYou can choose to use the alignment dropdown ('alignment') or configure the toolbar to use separate buttons for each of the options:\n\nClassicEditor .create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), { toolbar: [ 'heading', '|', 'alignment:left', 'alignment:right', 'alignment:center', 'alignment:justify' ] } ) .then( /* ... */ ) .catch( /* ... */ );\n\nThe three greatest things you learn from traveling\n\nLike all the great things on earth traveling teaches us by example. Here are some of the most precious lessons Iâve learned over the years of traveling.\n\n# Related features\n\nCKEditor 5 has more features that can help you organize your content:\n\nDocument title â Clearly divide your content into a title and body.\n\nHeadings â Split your content into logical sections.\n\nBlock indentation â Organize your content into visually separated blocks, indent crucial paragraphs, etc.\n\nBlock quote â Include block quotations or pull quotes in the rich-text content.\n\nRemove format â Easily clean basic text formatting.\n\n# Common API\n\nThe Alignment plugin registers:\n\nDropdown: 'alignment'.\n\nButtons: 'alignment:left', 'alignment:right', 'alignment:center', 'alignment:justify'.\n\nThe number of options and their names are based on the alignment.options configuration option.\n\nCommand: 'alignment':\n\nYou can align the currently selected block(s) by executing one of these commands:\n\neditor.execute( 'alignment', { value: 'center' } );\n\nWe recommend using the official CKEditor 5 inspector for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.\n\n# Content compatibility\n\nThe Alignment plugin provides support for the deprecated align attribute.\n\nBlock elements such as <p> with the align attribute are accepted by the plugin, but the editor always returns the markup in a modern format, so the transformation is one way only.\n\n# Contribute\n\nThe source code of the feature is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/tree/master/packages/ckeditor5-alignment.\n\nEvery day, we work hard to keep our documentation complete. Have you spotted outdated information? Is something missing? Please report it via our issue tracker.\n\nWith the release of version 42.0.0, we have rewritten much of our documentation to reflect the new import paths and features. We appreciate your feedback to help us ensure its accuracy and completeness."
