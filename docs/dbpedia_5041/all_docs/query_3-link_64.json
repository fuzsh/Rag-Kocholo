        "text": "When you get new tires for your vehicle, it's important to do everything you can to extend their lifespan. But, do you need a wheel alignment if you've just put new tires on your car? Let's discuss.\n\nWhat Is A Wheel Alignment?\n\nOne thing that you should know is that a wheel alignment is also known as a tire alignment. A wheel alignment means your mechanic will adjust your vehicle's suspension system, which connects the wheels to the vehicle. A wheel alignment does not mean that your mechanic actually adjusts the wheels or tires.\n\nProper alignment depends on adjusting the tires' angles. Those angles have a direct effect on how the tires of your vehicle touch the road. A wheel alignment has several benefits for your vehicle, which is why you should get wheel alignments fairly regularly. You should bring your vehicle in for a wheel alignment once or twice a year.\n\nI Just Got New Tires, Do I Need An Alignment?\n\nThere are a number of instances in which it is a good idea to get a wheel alignment for your vehicle. You should get a wheel alignment for your vehicle if you have just had new tires installed. Doing so is important so you can get the most out of your vehicle's new tires. Technically speaking, it is not necessary to get a wheel alignment after getting new tires installed.\n\nHowever, it is a good idea to do so. A wheel alignment with new tires ensures that your vehicle's new tires are properly aligned. This means that you can enjoy a smoother ride in your vehicle and your vehicle's new tires will last longer as a result of the wheel alignment. You will save money because you won't have to replace your vehicle's tires as quickly as you would otherwise if you get new tires properly aligned shortly after their installation.\n\nWhy Are Alignments Important?\n\nWheel alignments are important for several different reasons. The first reason that wheel alignments are important is that they help your vehicle's tires last longer, as previously mentioned. Additionally, wheel alignments allow you to enjoy a smoother ride in your vehicle. You should get regular wheel alignments if you want to enjoy a smooth ride.\n\nPoorly aligned tires can actually worsen your car's gas mileage, as well. According to data from Investopedia, wheel misalignment can decrease your vehicle's gas mileage by a maximum of 10%. This means that you are spending more money on gas than you need to without proper wheel alignment. As a result, you can save money on gas and conserve fuel by getting regular wheel alignments for your vehicle.\n\nRelated Blog: Dangers of Driving a Car With a Bad Alignment\n\nSigns You Might Need An Alignment\n\nAs you might expect, you will notice various signs if your vehicle is out of alignment. Some of these signs that your vehicle might need an alignment include noisy steering, rapid or uneven tire wear, and squealing tires. However, there are other signs as well, such as pulling to the left or right and a crooked steering wheel when you are driving the vehicle straight. Every vehicle is different, so you may notice only one of these signs or you may notice several of them at the same time.\n\nIn any case, if you notice any of these signs, you should bring your vehicle to your local United Tire location. Our team will be able to properly assess your vehicle's alignment and move forward from there. We can properly align your vehicle so that you can get back on the road as soon as possible.\n\nVisit A United Tire Auto Shop For Your Next Wheel Alignment"
