        "text": "Alignment of object on build plate\n\nI would use this option frequently\n\nI could see myself using this from time to time\n\nI have no preference about this feature\n\nI can’t see a use-case for my 3D Printing needs\n\n0 voters\n\nIf you’ve ever used PowerPoint or a drawing program, you’ve probably encountered the ability to select a group of objects and align them either to the left, right, middle, top, or bottom edges.\n\nI don’t mean to imply that this software should replace CAD, but I think it could benefit from expanding the existing “center object” feature to enable alignments based on the positions of multiple objects relative to each other.\n\nHere’s the scenario: Imagine I have two objects that I want to align together to create an assembly or Boolean object. Currently, I have to do this manually or attempt to center the objects, which restricts me to concentric alignment where all edges are equidistant.\n\nHere’s how it might work.\n\nPlate is put into top-down mode(CTRL-1)\n\ntwo or more objects are selected using the shift-mousedrag or CTRL-Mousclick\n\nRight-click on any of the objects and provide a drop-down menu with alignment options.\n\nAlso, I’d like to propose a “snap to grid” function. This could work by enabling it as a preference setting. When it’s active and you’re using a click-drag action, objects would automatically align with grid points on the plate layout. Alternatively, alignment guides could appear as objects approach alignment with each other, much like how PowerPoint handles it, as shown in the example below.\n\nFor me it would even be helpful to just choose left/center/right alignment because i get it all placed in the spot near the edge i want. Then i change the text to something longer or shorter and it throws off the alignment that i just created! If i could do left aligned for example instead of center being the default it would solve a lot of my problems.\n\nI would also like to vote for alignment for objects. For example you split a model to make one of the sections thicker, it’s nearly impossible to get them to line up and be able to move the thicker item up to stack on top again. The only way I’ve been able to do this is to export each part as an STL then in Tinkercad do a realignment. Then export that to an STL and back to Bambu Studio.\n\nThanks\n\nM1"
