        "text": "One of the most underrated features in Adobe creative apps are the various object alignment tools (left align, right align, align top edges, horizontal align middle, etc.) If you’re anything like me, you use these tools regularly. And while they are conveniently — and sometimes even dynamically — located in multiple locations, you may find yourself moving your cursor back-and-forth from your artwork to the alignment panel more often than you’d like. This can slow down — or even disrupt — your workflow. The solution? Keyboard shortcuts!\n\nIn this guide we setup keyboard shortcuts for the most common alignment actions. I also include notes about variations you can explore on your own.\n\nAdobe apps come chalk full of keyboard shortcuts (see official keyboard shortcuts lists for InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop and XD), so finding a combination of keystrokes that are not already designated to a shortcut can be tricky, and you’ll likely need to press several keys to employ any new shortcut. In this guide, most of our shortcuts will involve only three keys, but, luckily, they don’t require years of finger yoga to be able to get your hands in the positions required to press them all at the same time.\n\nWe’re going to start with Adobe InDesign.\n\nFor our keyboard shortcuts we’ll consistently press Control+Command and then add a modifier key.\n\nNote: for ease of research, writing and reading this tutorial, I’ll be using Mac keys only, Windows users willl need to adjust accordingly. I.e. Command on MacOS = Ctrl on Windows.\n\nAs much as I tried to get directly into the setup of these shortcuts, there is at least one more thing that needs clarification.\n\nAdobe uses different names for the same action, in different locations within the same app. Here’s what I mean. When you position your cursor over the first button in the Alignment panel, the tooltip says “Align left edges,” but, when you setup your keyboard shortcuts, the name for this action is “Horizontal Align Left.” Why Adobe would use two names for the same action is beyond me, but this is what we have to work with. And, if that isn’t bad enough, these same alignment actions get different names in different Adobe apps. For example, the tool tip in InDesign and Photoshop is “Align left edges,” but in Illustrator it is “Horizontal Align Left” and simply “Align Left” in XD.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies, while writing this guide, I nearly created a keyboard shortcut for inserting the face palm emoji.\n\nSo, in the lists of the shortcuts we’ll create, I include the action’s name (from the shortcut creator dialog box), then the tooltip, then the shortcut itself.\n\n*I use the letter M for the Vertical Align Center shortcut to differentiate between C for Horizontal Align Center and M for Vertical Align Center Middle. I find it helpful to think that you can find the shape of the letter V (for vertical) in the shape of the letter M.\n\nSetup keyboard shortcuts in Adobe InDesign\n\nSelect Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts…\n\nRecommended but optional: Create a new set, just in case something goes wrong you can revert to the default set. Or, like in the case of the latest InDesign release, when settings don’t migrate, you can simply select your set to restore all of your keyboard shortcuts!\n\nSet Product Area: to Object Editing\n\nUnder Commands: Scroll to and click on Horizontal Align Center\n\nNote: this list is alphabetical, so this will be the first of our shortcuts to create).\n\nClick in the New Shortcut: text box and press down the following keys: Control + Option + Command + C\n\nClick Assign\n\nRepeat for all the other shortcuts in the list above.\n\nClick Save\n\nClick OK\n\nUse your new shortcuts!\n\nAnd, you’re done!\n\n… Kind of.\n\nTo create shortcuts in other Adobe apps, keep reading.\n\nAdobe Abnormalities\n\nUnderstanding that Adobe apps are developed by app-specific teams helps us understand why each app handles very similar tasks so differently. Organizations the size of Adobe cannot have an entirely flat org. structure, so silos exist, and this affects how we interact with their apps. In this section, we’ll uncover some of these dissimilarities and how to overcome them.\n\nAdobe InDesign\n\nAdobe InDesign doesn’t list the object alignment actions anywhere in the app’s menus, which is why, when setting up the shortcuts you must find them in Product Area: Object Editing. This isn’t bad, it’s just different than the rest of the apps we cover in this guide.\n\nAdobe Illustrator\n\nThe Adobe Illustrator shortcut setup is a bit different than that of InDesign. One of the reasons for this is that the alignment actions can be found in the app’s menus, so that’s where you find the actions in the keyboard shortcut setup process.\n\nAdobe Illustrator does not let you use the Control key or the arrow keys in keyboard shortcuts, so I’ve substituted the Option key for the Control Key and letter keys for the arrow keys.\n\nSetup keyboard shortcuts in Adobe Illustrator\n\nSelect Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts…\n\nSelect Menu Commands\n\nUnder Command: Twirl open the arrow next to Object, then Align\n\nNote: this list is kind of alphabetical, it appears in the same order as it does in the menu.\n\nClick twice in the Horizontal Align Left row and the Shortcut column\n\nPress down the following keys: Option+Command+L\n\nRepeat for all the other shortcuts using the list below as a guide.\n\nClick OK\n\nYou will be prompted to save the Set of keyboard shortcuts. Name it, save it and you’re good to go.\n\n* Remember M is for Middle\n\nAdobe Photoshop\n\nAdobe Photoshop does allow you to use the Command key, but doesn’t allow you to use Arrow keys in keyboard shortcuts. So, similar to Adobe Illustrator, my solution is to use the first letter from each action’s directional component. I.e. C for Center, L for Left, R for Right, etc. as the modifier key in the shortcut.\n\nThe shortcut setup is a bit different in Photoshop, too.\n\nSetup keyboard shortcuts in Adobe Photoshop\n\nSelect Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts…\n\nSet Shortcuts For: to Application Menus\n\nUnder Application Menu Command: Scroll to Align > Top Edges and click in the right half of the Top Edges row.\n\n• Note: this list is not alphabetical, it appears in the same order as it does in the menu\n\nPress down the following keys: Control+Option+Command+T\n\n• Repeat for all the other shortcuts using the below guide.\n\nClick OK\n\n* Remember M is for Middle\n\nAdobe XD\n\nAdobe XD doesn’t allow you to create custom — or modify existing — keyboard shortcuts. (It has been a feature request since 2018.) This limitation is one of the reasons we used the specific shortcuts key combinations that we did — they are the defaults in XD, so no additional setup is necessary … in XD.\n\nThat’s not to say that XD is perfect. XD does its part in confusing all these alignment matters. XD is the only app that lists the vertical alignment options before the horizontal options.\n\nXD also groups the horizontal distribution action with the vertical alignment actions and the vertical distribution action with the horizontal alignment actions. I really gotta think Adobe is just screwing with us in this case. But, it appears that XD is going by the wayside, so maybe I shouldn’t include this section at all.\n\nFurther customization\n\nIn InDesign, each of the alignment actions can be modified further by setting the Align to: option in the Align panel. We created our shortcuts based on the default option: Align to Selection, but you may find yourself aligning objects to Key Object, Margins, Page or Spread more often than Selection. In this case, you can change your designated actions and/or setup additional shortcuts for multiple Align to settings. I find I use Selection, Key Object and Page most often. Key Object alignment doesn’t require additional keyboard shortcuts, you just have to define the key object before you use the shortcuts we’ve already set up, and it will work as expected — the alignment action will determine its position based on the key object.\n\nAlign to Page\n\nTo setup additional keyboard shortcuts for Align to Page, I’ve simply added the Option key to the shortcut.\n\nAlign to Margin\n\nTo setup additional keyboard shortcuts for Align to Margin, I’ve simply added the Option and Shift key to the shortcut.\n\nDistribute spacing\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room. All these Adobe apps’ alignment panel also include Distribute Spacing actions. Let’s set up some shortcuts for these actions as well.\n\nOkay, now you’re done.\n\nI hope you learned a thing or two and that these shortcuts prove as useful to you as they have to me.\n\nRemember, give yourself time and grace to learn these new skills. Soon enough you’ll get the hang of them and be glad you did.\n\nHappy creating,\n\nNick\n\nNick Saemenes 🗣\n\nP.S.\n\nSome third party apps allow you to setup app-specific keyboard shortcuts, which allow you to create more consistent keyboard shortcuts for like actions across multiple Adobe apps. I have used BetterTouchTool for such. I have no affiliation with BetterTouchTool. I am a paying customer and find it useful for MacOS customizations."
