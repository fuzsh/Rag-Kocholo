        "text": "What I'm looking for is auto numbering in multiline text with with aligning the number to the right.\n\nIn word you can create your own format, but this isn't possible in Acad as far as I know.\n\nSee here the auto numbering as I want it:\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\nSomeone here who knows the answer?\n\nHello TRogers,\n\nThat's autonumbering, but not autonumbering with alignment at the right.\n\nThe idea is to align the dots of the numbering\n\nI want it like this (but for now it's all single line text)\n\nYes, that's an option\n\nBut it's for work and editting should be easy as well.\n\nAnd if I have to choose between ugly alignment or difficult tables + changing numbers everytime my answer will be ugly alignment.\n\nNow some colleagues always explode the multiline texts to align it\n\nThe plain and simple fact is:\n\nLists have been a part of design work for centuries. Nine spaces to insert is not a deal breaker when using lists. You can insert them before the numbers 1-9 instead of after the \".\", if that is the format you desire. Most designers use the normal convention for lists. Which has been around longer than what is supplied by auto-numbering. If it were normal protocol to do it any other way, it would be that way.\n\nThe possible solution of using a table is an alternative but as stated has its limitations too.\n\nThis may not be an answer you want to hear, but just sayin'. You wouldn't change the protocol for dimensioning would you? Maybe a designer feels the arrows should align along the extension lines, instead of the dimension lines? Just becasue you can explode a feature object and change the configuration doesn't always mean it would be good paractice or correct?\n\n\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. \"-Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nThere is another slight workaround, but you would have to put the numbers in yourself\n\nWhen you first draw a Mtext box do you notice that L to the left of the box. That's your tab, you can drag it onto the ruler and a tabstop will appear there.\n\nIt can also be changed. click on it until you get the one which looks like an upside down T with a dot to the right. That is your decimal tab.\n\nTo put in your decimal number you first need to press tab then put in your number and you will note all the numbers line up on the decimal point.\n\nHoward Walker\n\nDid you find this post helpful?
