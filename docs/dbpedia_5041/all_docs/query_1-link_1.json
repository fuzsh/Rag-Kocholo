        "text": "This neither a bug in flex nor anything to do with margin is there not not. You can always any content with a margin, but what happens here is,\n\nIn case 1 (with display: flex):\n\nIn simple the flex alway expect a filled container, so it will fill the remaining space with margin. Here you have give margin: 0 0 0 auto. So you have mentioned top to be 0, right to be 0, bottom to be 0 and left to be auto. Since you specify left to be auto, the flexbox fills the elements left with margin, so the element is appearing to right. But the better way to do this is by giving a specific margin-left instead of auto, and use justify-content property to the container\n\ndiv { justify-content: flex-end; display: flex; width: 400px; background: #eee; } span { margin: 0 0 0 0; //can be 0 or 10px or any exact value. }\n\nIn case 2: You have'nt mentioned any display type, so by default it will be block, in block it won't expect the container to be filled like in flex. So the auto in the margin: 0 0 0 auto is taken as 0. So the content is placed in left itself. There is no direct way to align in block like justify-content in flex. But can be done with many ways, like using float, setting position to absolute and right to 0.\n\nI personaly like using flex when it comes to play around with alignments."
