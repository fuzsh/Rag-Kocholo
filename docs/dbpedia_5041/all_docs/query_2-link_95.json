This is not like saying \"center to the page\".\n\nIt always works (like in word or any other text editor) - but sometimes you have CSS conflicts or (most of the time) you trying to align an element to the right (but you declare this as inline!! or inline block) - and this is an issue (endless tricks to solve this - flex/float/position/and so on) **H1-6, P are block level elements"
