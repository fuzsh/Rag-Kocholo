        "text": "15 Alignment, font styles, and horizontal rules\n\nThis section of the specification discusses some HTML elements and attributes that may be used for visual formatting of elements. Many of them are deprecated.\n\n15.1 Formatting\n\n15.1.1 Background color\n\n15.1.2 Alignment\n\nIt is possible to align block elements (tables, images, objects, paragraphs, etc.) on the canvas with the align attribute. Although this attribute may be set for many HTML elements, its range of possible values sometimes differs from element to element. Here we only discuss the meaning of the align attribute for text.\n\nDEPRECATED EXAMPLE:\n\nThis example centers a heading on the canvas.\n\n<H1 align=\"center\"> How to Carve Wood </H1>\n\nwhich, with CSS, would be:\n\n<HEAD> <TITLE>How to Carve Wood</TITLE> <STYLE type=\"text/css\"> P.mypar {text-align: right} </STYLE> <BODY> <P class=\"mypar\">...Lots of paragraph text...\n\nWith CSS, the text-align property is inherited from the parent element, you can therefore use:\n\n<HEAD> <TITLE>How to Carve Wood</TITLE> <STYLE type=\"text/css\"> DIV.mypars {text-align: right} </STYLE> <BODY> <DIV class=\"mypars\"> <P>...text in first paragraph... <P>...text in second paragraph... <P>...text in third paragraph... </DIV>\n\nTo center the entire document with CSS:\n\n<HEAD> <TITLE>How to Carve Wood</TITLE> <STYLE type=\"text/css\"> BODY {text-align: center} </STYLE> <BODY> ...the body is centered... </BODY>\n\nThe CENTER element is exactly equivalent to specifying the DIV element with the align attribute set to \"center\". The CENTER element is deprecated.\n\n15.1.3 Floating objects\n\nImages and objects may appear directly \"in-line\" or may be floated to one side of the page, temporarily altering the margins of text that may flow on either side of the object.\n\nFloat an object\n\nThe align attribute for objects, images, tables, frames, etc., causes the object to float to the left or right margin. Floating objects generally begin a new line. This attribute takes the following values:\n\nleft: Floats the object to the current left margin. Subsequent text flows along the image's right side.\n\nright: Floats the object to the current right margin. Subsequent text flows along the image's left side.\n\nSome alignment attributes also permit the \"center\" value, which does not cause floating, but centers the object within the current margins. However, for P and DIV, the value \"center\" causes the contents of the element to be centered.\n\nFloat text around an object\n\nAnother attribute, defined for the BR element, controls text flow around floating objects.\n\n15.2 Fonts\n\nThe following HTML elements specify font information. Although they are not all deprecated, their use is discouraged in favor of style sheets.\n\n15.2.1 Font style elements: the TT, I, B, BIG, SMALL, STRIKE, S, and U elements\n\nStart tag: required, End tag: required\n\nRendering of font style elements depends on the user agent. The following is an informative description only.\n\nTT: Renders as teletype or monospaced text.\n\nI: Renders as italic text style.\n\nB: Renders as bold text style.\n\nBIG: Renders text in a \"large\" font.\n\nSMALL: Renders text in a \"small\" font.\n\nSTRIKE and S: Deprecated. Render strike-through style text.\n\nU: Deprecated. Renders underlined text.\n\nThe following sentence shows several types of text:\n\n<P><b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <b><i>bold italic</i></b>, <tt>teletype text</tt>, and <big>big</big> and <small>small</small> text.\n\nThese words might be rendered as follows:\n\nIt is possible to achieve a much richer variety of font effects using style sheets. To specify blue, italic text in a paragraph with CSS:\n\n<HEAD> <STYLE type=\"text/css\"> P#mypar {font-style: italic; color: blue} </STYLE> </HEAD> <P id=\"mypar\">...Lots of blue italic text...\n\nFont style elements must be properly nested. Rendering of nested font style elements depends on the user agent.\n\n15.2.2 Font modifier elements: FONT and BASEFONT\n\nFONT and BASEFONT are deprecated.\n\nSee the Transitional DTD for the formal definition.\n\nThe FONT element changes the font size and color for text in its contents.\n\nThe BASEFONT element sets the base font size (using the size attribute). Font size changes achieved with FONT are relative to the base font size set by BASEFONT. If BASEFONT is not used, the default base font size is 3.\n\nThe base font size does not apply to headings, except where these are modified using the FONT element with a relative font size change.\n\n15.3 Rules: the HR element\n\nStart tag: required, End tag: forbidden\n\nThe HR element causes a horizontal rule to be rendered by visual user agents.\n\nThe amount of vertical space inserted between a rule and the content that surrounds it depends on the user agent.\n\nDEPRECATED EXAMPLE:\n\nThis example centers the rules, sizing them to half the available width between the margins. The top rule has the default thickness while the bottom two are set to 5 pixels. The bottom rule should be rendered in a solid color without shading:\n\n<HR width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"> <HR size=\"5\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"> <HR noshade size=\"5\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\">\n\nThese rules might be rendered as follows:"
