There are a variety of causes to this problem, but the most common one is that the latest products are collected with higher accuracy and improved processing techniques. In previous work, we developed techniques to automatically correct the alignment of vector data with orthoimagery using a technique called conflation. However, in applying our technique to real-world datasets provided by USGS, we discovered that these techniques failed in some areas. In this paper, we describe some refinements to our original approach that provide consistently better results in aligning the vector data with the orthoimagery.\n\nPublication type Conference Paper Publication Subtype Conference Paper Title Automatic alignment of vector data and orthoimagery for the national map DOI 10.1145/1146598.1146680 Volume 151 Year Published 2006 Language English Larger Work Title ACM International Conference Proceeding Series First page 303 Last page 304 Conference Title 7th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research, Dg.o 2006 Conference Location San Diego, CA Conference Date 21 May 2006 through 24 May 2006 Google Analytic Metrics Metrics page Additional publication details"
