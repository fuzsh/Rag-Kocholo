The RTL property is intrinsic to the language. Playing with alignment is nonsense.\n\nFirst thing is to enable the specific menus by setting Complex Text Layout in Tools>Options, Language Settings>Languages. Next, modify Default Paragraph Style, Font tab to set your preferred non-Western language.\n\nIf you want these changes to be persistent, save then in a new template file and make it your default.\n\nBut this is not enough. You’ll still start in default Western language. To switch to another script, press:\n\nCtrl+Shift+D when you want the paragraph in RTL mode\n\nCtrl+Shift+A when you want the paragraph in LTR mode\n\nI have not found how to record this is a style.\n\nHi\n\nIndeed I write with Hebrew.\n\nWon’t it be simpler to just uninstall LibreOffice and then re-install it in Hebrew?\n\nThen if the program is in Hebrew from the very start, I won’t have to create templates, switch modes for almost each document, etc. Am I wrong?\n\nNo, simply because this will keep your current profile (this is no bug, but a feature). But you may try uninstall, remove profile (create a backup before, profile contais also macros, user defined dictionaries, database connections etc.), then re-install.\n\nDepends how quick you can set a document as default template used for new files.\n\n.\n\nKeep in mind: Whatever way you use, older files will keep the template they used before.\n\nNo, simply because this will keep your current profile (this is no bug, but a feature). But you may try uninstall, remove profile (create a backup before, profile contais also macros, user defined dictionaries, database connections etc.), then re-install.\n\nI agree that someone who has set a LibreOffice Writer profile should backup it before uninstalling, but I never set any profile in LibreOffice Writer; I don’t have any macros or any special configurations to save so I just don’t have any such profile to backup.\n\nHow would you suggest me to proceed?\n\nYes, you’re right - you didn’t do it. Office did this for you when you first started it. Here is a picture - a small part from Wiki (click to see the full article)\n\nI am quite confused about what I should do to get automatic RTL directionality.\n\nAgain, my current profile is all default, no special configurations, no macros so there is no profile data to backup. Thus, I think I need to ask this:\n\nHow to delete my current profile and what should I do afterwards?"
