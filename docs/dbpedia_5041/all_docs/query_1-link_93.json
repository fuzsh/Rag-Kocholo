In this case, there's nothing relevant in the apps/nautilus section.\n\nThis issue was queried on launchpad a couple of years ago : https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/48705, but there was no bug filed subsequently.\n\nYour only option is to manually align your icons.\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to do this on GNOME. It has been requested in a bug report and on Ubuntu Brainstorm, but no traction has been made on it.\n\nYou would have to manually align the icons, or move your dock.\n\nThe only thing you can do to move icons on the right side of the deskop (Mac style) is to install screenlets and start \"folderview\" and set it to show the desktop folder, then you can adjust the screenlet on the right side of your desktop.\n\nI wrote iconic you could modify the script to reorder the icons from right to left. Additionally iconic will:\n\nAllow you to move icons to any of three monitors\n\nNot suffer the \"lost icon syndrome\" that occurs when monitors of multiple resolutions are used\n\nSort icons alphabetically, alphabetically with \"Link to\" prefix ignored, sort by modified date ascending or date descending\n\nAllow different grid size (columns x rows) depending on monitor, EG more on 4K monitor than 2K monitor\n\nInstant Test button for quick experimentation on column x row changes or reserved space changes for monitor left, top, right or bottom areas\n\nTest button will last for x seconds defined by you, clear all windows before test and restore them after test\n\nBash script for easy modifications\n\nYou can get the script on github.\n\nHere's the main screen:\n\nVisit the github page for iconic to see all the other screens, explanations and a copy of the script."
