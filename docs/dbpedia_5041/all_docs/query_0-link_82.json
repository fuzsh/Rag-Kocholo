For the content above and below that sections I have the content in a container, but in the middle section I want to have the right column image go all the way to the edge of the screen. My challenge is I’m not sure how to make the text in the left align with the container, while the image on the right go full scree. What do you suggest? thanks\n\nHere is my site Read-Only: LINK\n\n(how to share your site Read-Only link)\n\nthanks for looking! I’m not going to share the read only for NDA reasons. The image I uploaded before is from Photoshop. Here is the What I’ve got in Webflow. I want the “Outdoor Antenna” section to line up with the text above, which is within a container. If I put the Outdoor Antenna text in a container, I can’t have the photo stretch to the edge of the browser window. Does that make sense?\n\nYes it does. That’s kinda why I never use containers. And honestly, they hinder your css growth skill set.\n\nThe “Outdoor Antenna” on the far left - in the middle section right?\n\nOkay gotcha, the best option is - first make that it’s own section - under the booster strength, coverage area, outdoor signal. I would structure the foundation with 4 layers.\n\nLayer 1. Section: Set to Block, no sizes or anything, just class name to designate for identify purposes\n\nLayer 2. Div 1 (wrapper for all): Set to Flex, center center\n\nLayer 3. Div 1 (text wrapper):\n\nLayer 4. Div 2 (photo wrapper): Set to Block initially\n\nFor the NDA purposes, I understand. But I can’t get in to see, so off the top of my head. It looks like you may have it something like this, but try this setup. Now when you put everything in, you’ll have 2 options. Manage alignment with display settings (flex, block, etc) OR margins & padding. But with this setup, you’ll be able to test without fiddling with individual divs.\n\nFrom the .jpeg, you can take Layer #2 and use: Left & Right even inner padding. You can reduce the padding on smaller devices. The photo will auto-resize.\n\nLet me know how that works."
