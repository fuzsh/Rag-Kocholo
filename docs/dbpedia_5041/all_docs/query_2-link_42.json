You can align objects with each other and with parts of the drawing page, such as the center, edges, and grid. When you align objects with objects, you can line them up by their centers or by their edges.\n\nYou can align multiple objects horizontally or vertically with the center of the drawing page. Single or multiple objects can also be arranged along the edge of the page and to the nearest point on a grid.\n\nDistributing objects automatically adds spacing between them based on their width, height, and center points. You can distribute objects so that their center points or selected edges (for example, top or right) appear at equal intervals. You can also distribute objects so that there is equal space between them. You can distribute objects over the extent of the bounding box surrounding them or over the entire drawing page.\n\nScattered objects (left) are vertically aligned and equally distributed (right).\n\nTo align an object with another object\n\n1.\n\nSelect the objects.\n\nIf you select the objects one at a time, the last object selected is the reference point for aligning the other objects. If you marquee select the objects before you align them, the object that is positioned in the upper-left corner of the selection is used as a reference.\n\n2.\n\nClick Arrange Align and distribute Align and distribute.\n\n3.\n\nClick the Align tab.\n\n4.\n\nSpecify vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, or both:\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the vertical axis, enable the Left, Center, or Right check box.\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the horizontal axis, enable the Top, Center, or Bottom check box.\n\n5.\n\nFrom the Align objects to list box, choose Active objects.\n\nIf you are aligning text objects, choose one of the following from the For text source objects use list box:\n\n•\n\nFirst-line baseline — uses the baseline of the first line of text as a reference point\n\n•\n\nLast-line baseline — uses the baseline of the last line of text as a reference point\n\n•\n\nBounding box — uses the bounding box of a text object as a reference point\n\nYou can also align objects with another object quickly, without using the Align and distribute dialog box, by clicking Arrange Align and distribute and clicking any of the first six alignment commands. The letter next to a command name indicates the keyboard shortcut that you can use to align objects. For example, the letter L next to the Align left command shows that you can press L to align objects with the leftmost point of the object that is used as a reference point.\n\nYou can also open the Align and distribute dialog box by selecting the objects and clicking the Align and distribute button on the property bar.\n\nTo align an object with the page center\n\n1.\n\nSelect an object.\n\nIf you want to align multiple objects, marquee select the objects.\n\n2.\n\nClick Arrange Align and distribute, and then click one of the following:\n\n•\n\nCenter to page — aligns all objects with the page center, both vertically and horizontally\n\n•\n\nCenter to page horizontally — aligns objects with the page center along a horizontal axis\n\n•\n\nCenter to page vertically — aligns objects with the page center along a vertical axis\n\nYou can also align all objects with the page center, vertically and horizontally, by pressing P.\n\nTo align an object with the page edge\n\n1.\n\nSelect an object.\n\nIf you want to align an object group, select the group.\n\n2.\n\nClick Arrange Align and distribute Align and distribute.\n\n3.\n\nClick the Align tab.\n\n4.\n\nSpecify vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, or both:\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the vertical axis, enable the Left, Center, or Right check box.\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the horizontal axis, enable the Top, Center, or Bottom check box.\n\n5.\n\nChoose Edge of page from the Align objects to list box.\n\nYou can also open the Align and distribute dialog box by selecting the objects and clicking the Align and distribute button on the property bar.\n\nYou can align an object with the grid by choosing Grid from theAlign objectsto list box.\n\nTo align an object with a specified point\n\n1.\n\nSelect an object.\n\nIf you want to align an object group, select the group.\n\n2.\n\nClick Arrange Align and distribute Align and distribute.\n\n3.\n\nClick the Align tab.\n\n4.\n\nSpecify vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, or both:\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the vertical axis, enable the Left, Center, or Right check box.\n\n•\n\nTo align objects along the horizontal axis, enable the Top, Center, or Bottom check box.\n\n5.\n\nChoose Specified point from the Align objects to list box.\n\n6.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nThe pointer changes to a crosshair pointer.\n\n7.\n\nClick in the drawing window to define the reference point for alignment.\n\nTo distribute objects\n\n1.\n\nSelect the objects.\n\n2.\n\nClick ArrangeAlign and distribute Align and distribute.\n\n3.\n\nClick the Distribute tab.\n\n4.\n\nTo distribute the objects horizontally, enable one of the following options from the top-right row:\n\n•\n\nLeft — evenly spaces the left edges of the objects\n\n•\n\nCenter — evenly spaces the center points of the objects\n\n•\n\nSpacing — places equal intervals between the selected objects\n\n•\n\nRight — evenly spaces the right edges of the objects\n\n5.\n\nTo distribute the objects vertically, enable one of the following options from the column on the left:\n\n•\n\nTop — evenly spaces the top edges of the objects\n\n•\n\nCenter — evenly spaces the center points of the objects\n\n•\n\nSpacing — places equal intervals between the selected objects\n\n•\n\nBottom — evenly spaces the bottom edges of the objects\n\n•\n\nExtent of selection — distributes the objects over the area of the bounding box surrounding them\n\n•\n\nExtent of page — distributes the objects over the drawing page\n\nTop row: Options for distributing objects horizontally. 1) The Left option evenly spaces the left edges. 2) The Center option evenly spaces the center points. Bottom row: Options for distributing objects vertically. 3) The Top option evenly spaces the top edges. 4) The Center option evenly spaces the center points.\n\nCopyright 2012 Corel Corporation.
