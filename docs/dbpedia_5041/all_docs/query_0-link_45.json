        "text": "The alignment operators are applied to a cell’s specifier and allow you to horizontally and vertically align a cell’s content.\n\nHorizontal alignment operators\n\nContent can be horizontally aligned to the left or right side of the cell as well as the center of the cell.\n\nFlush left operator (<)\n\nThe less-than sign (<) aligns the content to the left side of the cell. This is the default horizontal alignment.\n\nFlush right operator (>)\n\nThe greater-than sign (>) aligns the content to the right side of the cell.\n\nCenter operator (^)\n\nThe caret (^) centers the content horizontally in the cell.\n\nA horizontal alignment operator is entered after a span or duplication operator (if present) and in front a vertical alignment operator (if present).\n\n<factor><span or duplication operator><horizontal alignment operator><vertical alignment operator><style operator>|<cell’s content>\n\nAlign the content of a cell to the right\n\nTo align the content in a cell to its right side, place the > operator in front of the cell’s separator (|), but after a span (<n>`) or duplication (`<n>*+) operator (if present). Don’t insert any spaces between the | and the operators.\n\nExample 3. Right align the content of a cell\n\n|=== |Column Name |Column Name >|This content is aligned to the right side of the cell because the cell specifier includes the `>` operator. |There isn't a horizontal alignment operator on this cell specifier, so the cell falls back to the default horizontal alignment. Content is aligned to the left side of the cell by default. 2+>|This cell spans two columns. Its content is aligned to the right because the cell specifier includes the `>` operator. The `>` operator must be placed directly after the span operator (`+`). |===\n\nThe table from Example 3 is rendered below.\n\nResult of Example 3 Column Name Column Name\n\nVertical alignment operators\n\nContent can be vertically aligned to the top or bottom of a cell as well as the center of a cell. Vertical alignment operators always begin with a dot (.).\n\nFlush top operator (.<)\n\nThe dot and less-than sign (.<) aligns the content to the top of the cell. This is the default vertical alignment.\n\nFlush bottom operator (.>)\n\nThe dot and greater-than sign (.>) aligns the content to the bottom of the cell.\n\nCenter operator (.^)\n\nThe dot and caret (.^) centers the content vertically.\n\nA vertical alignment operator is entered after a horizontal alignment operator (if present) and in front of a style operator (if present).\n\n<factor><span or duplication operator><horizontal alignment operator><vertical alignment operator><style operator>|<cell’s content>\n\nCenter content vertically in a cell\n\nTo vertically center the content in a cell, place the .^ operator in front of the cell’s separator (|). Don’t insert any spaces between the | and the operator.\n\nExample 6. Center the content of a cell vertically\n\n|=== |Column Name |Column Name .^|This content is vertically centered because the cell specifier includes the `+.^+` operator. |There isn't a vertical alignment operator on this cell specifier, so the cell falls back to the default vertical alignment. Content is aligned to the top of the cell by default. |===\n\nThe table from Example 6 is rendered below.\n\nResult of Example 6 Column Name Column Name\n\nApply horizontal and vertical alignment operators to the same cell\n\nA cell can have a vertical and horizontal alignment operator included in its cell specifier. The horizontal operator always precedes the vertical operator.\n\nExample 7. Align cells horizontally and vertically\n\n|=== |Column 1 |Column 2 |Column 3 ^.>|The specifier for this cell is `^.>`. The content is centered horizontally and aligned to the bottom of the cell. |There aren't any alignment operators on this cell's specifier, so the cell falls back to the default alignments. The default horizontal alignment is the left side of the cell. The default vertical alignment is the top of the cell. >.^|The specifier for this cell is `>.^`. The content is aligned to the right side of the cell and centered vertically. 2.3+^.^|The specifier for this cell is `pass:[2.3+^.^]`. It spans two columns and three rows.
