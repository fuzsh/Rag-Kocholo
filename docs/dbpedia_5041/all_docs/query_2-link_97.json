        "text": "Have you ever spent hours trying to make your design elements in Canva line up just right? Have you used a template you didn't love just because the little boxes and images were spaced out just so?\n\nWith these tips on how to use positioning and grouping tools in Canva, you'll be creating the intricate and complicated designs of your dreams in no time at all! Let's learn how to align objects in Canva.\n\nPositioning\n\nInstead of moving boxes, icons, or images around manually using guide lines in Canva, you first should duplicate or copy/paste your item in the amount you need. Then, highlight all of the items and choose \"align elements\" and they'll line up to the left or right. You can also space them out evenly vertically or horizontally. One or two clicks and you're done!\n\nGrouping\n\nIf you want to group together say, a text box and a checkbox like in this example, it's pretty simple with just a few clicks. First, align the text boxes with each other using the Positioning tool you learned about in the above section. Now, before you can use the \"space evenly\" function, you first need to pair up each text box to its corresponding checkbox. Select the text box and checkbox (or whatever items you're working on) together and click \"Group\" - or ctrl+G. You can now resize, rotate, or space them together as a single unit.\n\nTidying\n\nNow that you've grouped items you want to stay together, you can use the Positioning function to tidy everything up at one time with a single click. Highlight all your groupings, and position them how you like. While they're all highlighted together, you can also center them or place them where you prefer.\n\nYes, it's that simple!! Now, you can create beautiful and intricate designs in Canva with just a few clicks, instead of spending hours nudging boxes and elements around the page."
