        "text": "I am not having any problems, but am wondering when the Auto Z-Level should be checked? If I understand correctly, the SV04 will use this function to adjust the Z axis stepper motors so they are properly aligned relative to the current bed position. Is this correct?\n\nWhen following the document - SV04 Bed Leveling Guide, the guide indicates to auto align the Z axis right after auto-home completes.\n\nSince leveling the bed comes afterwards, what good would the auto-Z align do if the bed was out of level. It seems that the auto-Z align should come more toward the end of the leveling guide. It could be done after completing the left extruder or after finishing up with the right extruder.\n\nThanks in advance for clarity on this feature.\n\nOh, that is an interesting one - it seems that Sovol left two implementations of G34 in their firmware. The one I had a look into seems to compare & adjust the current of both Z-motors, but there is an other one that is named “G34_M422.cpp”. Maybe I’ll have time to look into that source code in the weekend…\n\nThank you for your post @Max_Powerr .\n\nI am wondering if the Auto Z-Align is available just the make sure the two Z axis motors are still in sync? If one motor lost a few steps somehow, the Auto Z-Align would correct this without re-leveling the bed-to-extruder tip relationship?\n\nIf using the plastic shims for initial setup and then run Auto Z-Align, that will affect the tramming. If you go through the tramming first, that will change the reference for Auto Z-Align. So, if the shim setup is close, running Auto Z-Align after tramming, would be best and the run Auto Z-Align periodically to ensure there were no lost steps that occurred during past prints.\n\nDoes this sound like the best-practice routine(s)?"
