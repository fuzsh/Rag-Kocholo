        "text": "Pitch gives you a few easy ways to keep the content on your slides aligned. You can align text, image, and other types of blocks with other elements on a slide, or along our built-in guides. The guides are the yellow lines that appear when you drag a block close to the vertical and horizontal centers or the edges of the slide, or the edges of nearby blocks.\n\nThe easiest way to align a block is to click on it, hold it, and drag it closer to the element(s) you would like to align it with. This also works with multiple blocks: Simply press Shift or Command to select multiple blocks at once, and drag them across the slide to activate the guides.\n\nðŸ’¡Press Command (or Control on Windows) if you want to hide all guides and move blocks freely.\n\nYou can also nudge selected blocks along the built-in guides using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Select the blocks you want to move and then:\n\nIf youâ€™re using a Mac, press Command + â–² â–¼ â—„ â–º\n\nIf youâ€™re looking for more control over how your blocks are aligned on your slide, select multiple blocks and right-click. Choose Align or Distribute and select your preferred option:\n\nSmart formatting features in Pitch are designed to do the heavy lifting for you and allow you to quickly rearrange your blocks. Learn about smart formatting in this article."
