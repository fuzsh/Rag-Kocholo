        "text": "Align multiple shapes to left, right, top, bottom, middle (horizontally) or center (vertically) on your PowerPoint slide.\n\nThese features let you quickly access alignment buttons to align selected shapes in PowerPoint. Align objects on your PowerPoint slide in less clicks. Use the alignment features to align text boxes, shape, images or other objects. Align objects in PowerPoint relative to each other or to the position on the screen (e.g. center text box will anchor it to the horizontal center of your slide).\n\nDefault behavior for this feature is to align to the most extreme positioned shape, consistent with Microsoft's default in PowerPoint. However, you can temporarily or permanently override the default and force alignment to the first shape you select using PPT Productivity's Align to first selected feature.\n\nGroup by Row and Group by Column are features that were requested by our McKinsey alumni users. If you're a McKinsey alumni, read more about the many other features we think you'll love.\n\nIf you find that you need to group by row in PowerPoint frequently, use the PPT Productivity Customizable PowerPoint Shortcuts feature to add a PowerPoint shortcut for group by row\n\nGroup by Row and Group by Column are features that were requested by our McKinsey alumni users. If you're a McKinsey alumni, read more about the many other features we think you'll love.\n\nIf you find that you need to group by column in PowerPoint frequently, use the PPT Productivity Customizable PowerPoint Shortcuts feature to add a PowerPoint shortcut for group by column\n\nThe send backward and bring forward shortcuts may not always appear to be working but this is because PowerPoint is sending them back or bringing them forward relative to all elements on the slide, not just the immediately surrounding elements (you can see this in the video above by watching the Selection Pane shown to the right of screen). You can turn on the Selection Pane from the PPT Productivity ribbon."
