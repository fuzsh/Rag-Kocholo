        "text": "When I first started to write about alignment, I assumed I’d find the same comfortable rhythm as when I expressed my love of semantics and my hatred of buzzwords in a post about ambiguity. This Buzzword Bingo series exists because I find the lifecycle of everyday words moving from common vernacular into the business world fascinating. There’s a lovely irony to our attempts at specificity — and let’s be honest, sounding smart — that end up muddling the meaning of a word so badly that it’s almost like saying nothing at all.\n\nBut I don’t have the same issues with definitional misuse of alignment as I did with ambiguity. To be clear, if alignment isn’t on your buzzword bingo card, it still should be. I have flashbacks of hearing it said so many times in a meeting that I started to suffer from semantic satiation. But the challenge with it is something completely different.\n\nThe more I researched, the more I started to regard alignment in a negative way. I thought about all the “alignment meetings” I’ve been to, and I realize now that most of them were either status updates or “get with the program” meetings. At first I thought this was just a case of misuse, overuse, or being lazy, but could it be possible that it’s not quite as innocent? We all know that alignment literally means lining things up. It’s like ensuring the tires on your car point perfectly in the right direction individually so that the car propels forward smoothly.\n\nSo when meetings or emails have a subject line with the word alignment, the expectation seems very obvious and well-known. It conjures something participatory, a call for attendees to inquire and critique as though they have a say in the outcome. But the one-way communication of a status update or the description of an already-decided plan is most certainly not alignment.\n\nMaybe alignment isn’t always good.\n\nForced alignment is a great example of disagree and commit. (This is commonly seen as a good management principle, but if the culture of your organization tends to honor decisions based on the HiPPO, the disagreeing part becomes a waste of energy.) “Coercion dressed up like collaboration” is my new favorite way to describe it, as ranted about here.\n\nThe example I’ll use is a really common experience for me. I have often worked somewhere between technology and “the business” (I’ll have to write something about that ridiculous delineation at a later date.) Everything including the pace of work, the way decisions are made, the level of empowerment and ownership individuals have, the way goals are set, the value of outcome and output, definitions of words, general knowledge, etc. are different. Basically, they rarely walk into a situation with a quality shared understanding.\n\nWhen we try to align these groups — especially on strategy — we automatically presuppose that business and technology strategies are separate. We generally wait for the business strategy to exist before tackling technology plans as though one exists only to support the other. Any alignment meeting is going to be dictatorial, not collaborative. The teams need a shared strategy, something they agree on, not the “alignment” of two separate strategies.\n\nSometimes what you really need is agreement.\n\nIf alignment isn’t as collaborative as we’ve long believed it to be, I propose looking for situations in which we actually need agreement.\n\nTwo people — or maybe a small group — having the same viewpoint is an agreement, and it’s even more challenging and coveted than alignment. This article provides a great perspective on why agreement is more important than alignment. Basically, alignment isn’t enough. It’s like saying, “I don’t think I’d do the same thing myself, but I can get behind it.” Agreement is being on the same page as if you’d have come to the same conclusion on your own.\n\nThe level of trust required to create true agreement is a rarity, but it’s what we should strive for, and it starts with figuring out if you need agreement or alignment. It’s about deciding which one of these statements is how you want to describe a situation:\n\n“We agree this is the right direction.”\n\n“We’re aligned that we’re going this direction.”\n\nThe first statement with its hands together, heads nodding, confident affirmatives all around is much more empowering. It’s unbreakable. It means that everyone involved believes the same thing. It’s a shared understanding and alignment of values, not strategy.\n\nThe latter is committed participation. It sounds like a very business-appropriate way of passively expressing disagreement. I’m not discounting the value of alignment in many situations, but I am challenging the notion that it’s the ultimate status of harmony. Perhaps we should spend less energy trying to garner coerced alignment and put that effort into building the kind of trust that inspires agreement.\n\nWhen to use agreement vs. alignment\n\nAs I mentioned, this isn’t about semantics as much as it is about practice. Alignment is necessary to keep a business moving forward, to create and accomplish goals, and to keep employees from losing their minds over ineffectual efforts. The problem is aligning the right things with the right people at the right level of responsibility. The most egregious mistake — in my opinion — and one I’ve seen a lot, is the tendency of organizations to align on day-to-day processes at the leadership level without the input of the people that do the actual processes. But that’s just one example. Ideally, good alignment — and agreement — might look more like this:\n\nThe macro-level agreement is focused on things like vision, strategy, and objectives. The entirety of the business’ mission needs to be a full agreement, not just an alignment. This agreement spans leadership across major functions. (Think of this pattern as repeating from the company level into each group.)\n\nTop-to-bottom/bottom-to-top alignment is built on a foundation of shared understanding that should be focused on expectations, with information delivered in both directions. This requires high-quality communication more than anything else. Working teams need to understand the strategy and business objectives, and leadership needs to understand progress and outcomes. But in a hierarchical organization, this doesn’t really need to be agreement. Sometimes someone just has to make the decision.\n\nCross-team alignment needs to account for dependencies and milestones, where all the working groups have goals that are a mix of shared and independent. This is literally about aligning work to other groups’ work and ensuring that the goals of each group can be achieved in harmony.\n\nWithin working groups — in addition to participating in and benefiting from the other alignments and agreements — is where people can agree on the kinds of processes and standards that will best help them achieve their goals.\n\nBecause agreement is more challenging to achieve, it makes sense to strive for it within smaller groups with similar levels of responsibility. At the higher leadership levels, agreement — more than alignment — will be genuine and prevent deviation. Within working groups, the day-to-day activities of working together are everything. Feeling aligned is only temporarily satisfying. People feel and work better when they have a sense of ownership, and that’s accomplished with agreement. But alignment is enough across teams that may have only sporadic shared needs.\n\nOverall, there’s less reason to be concerned with the use of the word alignment than there is to be concerned about how we actually align and why."
