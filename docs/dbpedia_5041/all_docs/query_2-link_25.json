        "text": "Hi, I’m a relatively new user and have been searching for an answer to this and have come up short because others asking it are only asking about alignment without different angles being involved. Here’s the simple example: Say you have a model of a skylight and the model is level; in other words its parallel to the red/green (x/y) plane. You have a roof (that’s obviously sloped) and want to place the skylight on the roof so that the skylight is angled exactly as the roof is. Of course the pitch of the roof is known, and from that there is a known angle. And of course the rotate tool could be used to rotate the skylight. But, is there any way to ‘acquire’ the angle from the roof geometry itself? In other words, you wouldn’t have to even know the slope of the roof, you’d just get the points and it would be exact. AutoCAD has a command that will do this called ‘align’ and it does ask you if you want to scale the object but you can decline. It essentially forces one object to be aligned with another merely by choosing points and that’s it. The numerical position or angle of the object being used as the ‘alignment target’ doesn’t have to be known.\n\nI tried to experiment in Sketchup and came up empty. I created a box and then angled the top. Then I created a cylinder. I then wanted to rotate the cylinder so that it would match the slope of the box. I tried using the rotate tool on the cylinder and attempted to get the angle of rotation by using points along the top slope of the box. I came close but was off a bit. Was I on the right track, trying to use the acquired points to define the angle OR was this entire approach completely wrong? Just wondered if I had the right idea with bad execution OR completely going in the wrong direction. Thanks for any tips. -jonR\n\nI find it tends to be easiest to draw parts in place, that way you don’t tend to run into these kind of problems.\n\nBut in answer to your question: If you make the skylight a component ,you can change it to a “glue to” component with several choices. I chose “any” to demonstrate a little more potential, but there is also an only “sloped” option. Click the component in the “in model” tab of the components browser window and you can place a fresh copy of the component to glue to any face.\n\nI made a quick gif to explain a little better:\n\nIanT, Thanks gain; played around with this and found it extremely useful. I did notice one issue with this feature that takes away from it’s ‘intelligence’ as it makes assumptions about the state of the geometry you are turning into the component with the ‘glue to’ feature. Unless I’m making a mistake, it seems the component geometry has to be parallel with the red/green axis (i.e. flat ‘on the ground’), otherwise ‘glue to’ mis-calibrates. It assumes ‘flat to the ground’ and adjusts from that. It does this rather than not making the assumption and using the difference between what angle the component actually is and the sloped surface it’s being glued to. Obviously more of a nit-pick but it is something I noticed. I noticed that you stressed ‘fresh copy’ of the component and for a reason. I found it interesting that you can’t use the geometry in the scene that was newly edited to use the ‘glue to’ functionality. It has to be a fresh copy.\n\nChanging the type of ‘Glue to’ has no influence on component instances in the modeling space (to avoid confucion you shouldn’t say “already in the scene”. The term “scene” is reserved for something else).\n\nWhat is important is the gluing plane of the component, its own red/green plane which you can change at any time. Doing so means that you in fact reposition the component’s geometry for the local (component’s) axes.\n\nSo it will affect all the component instances of that component, whether already glued to or not.\n\nYou can copy a ‘Glue to’ component to another face and it will also ‘Glue to’. If that particular property for an (just that one) instance somehow gets broken, the others still keep that status. It can be restored for that instance by using a plugin. Or just replace it by a fresh one from the component library or by using a copy of one that still has the ‘Glue to’ property.\n\nI wanted to thank everyone here for answering my question. I have to say, I’ve only been in this forum a few weeks or so and am very impressed by the kind generosity people here exhibit with regards to helping others and exchanging info. Not only that, but most everyone here is excellent at explaining things; are you guys professional teachers? I’m saying all of this as a veteran user of other types of forums that people use to exchange info, and I am specifically talking about skill-based forums such as for programming/coding, music, building design, and other software applications (other than Sketchup). Many of those that I’ve been a member of have been great sources of info and help from others but as great as they have been, it seems that this place here is even better. Thanks again! jonR"
