        "text": "Searching the website I found plenty of similarly related questions, such as this, this or this one. Nevertheless none of the answers to the questions I found so far addressed precisely this issue.\n\nAs it happens, I have a series of equations and some of them are too long to fit a line. I would like to break them in two parts, with the upper part being aligned to the $=$-sign and the bottom part being aligned on the right margin. The output, in this case obtained using \\hspace, should look like this\n\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article} \\usepackage[english]{babel} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{document} Here I write a line to be sure of the precise and exact extension of the margin. \\begin{align*} \\mathrm{HTr}K^\\Gamma_{\\overline{M}_{-k}}(t) = & \\sum_{\\gamma \\in H(\\Gamma)} \\int_X \\sum_{[\\kappa] \\in \\Gamma\\backslash\\Gamma_\\gamma} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty j(\\kappa^{-1}\\gamma^n\\kappa,z)^k\\times{} \\\\ & \\hspace{4.6cm} \\times K_{-k,\\text{hyp}}(t;\\kappa^{-1}\\gamma^n\\kappa(z),z) \\mu_\\text{hyp}(z) \\intertext{Now I comment on the next step,} = & \\sum_{\\gamma \\in H(\\Gamma)} \\int_X \\sum_{[\\kappa] \\in \\Gamma\\backslash\\Gamma_\\gamma} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty j(\\kappa^{-1}\\gamma^n\\kappa,z)^k\\times{} \\\\ & \\hspace{4.6cm} \\times K_{-k,\\text{hyp}}(t;\\kappa^{-1}\\gamma^n\\kappa(z),z) \\mu_\\text{hyp}(z) \\intertext{And finally it simplifies} = & \\; 0. \\end{align*} \\end{document}\n\nIs there a way to automatically align the second line to the right margin? I imagine something like flushright that works inside the align environment, or, as the present answer seems to suggest, a way to realign the equations into a multline-environment.\n\nThank you!"
