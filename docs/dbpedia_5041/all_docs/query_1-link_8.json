        "text": "Hi Stephanie,\n\nAs already suggested it really depends on what you are trying to centralise, if you are looking to have your headers i.e h1, h2, h3 centred, or you \"p\" tags centred then use text align this is what is designed from without then having to worry about block inline-block or inline elements.\n\nMargin auto would be used to centralise the parent element that holds the text content on the page and to do this you would have to specify a width for both the parent and child. For example:\n\n<body> <div class=\"text-wrap\"> <div class=\"center\"> <h1>Center Heading</h1> <p>All my text in this section would be aligned left as default</p> </div> </div> </body>\n\n.text-wrap { width: 100%; } .center { width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } h1 { text-align: center; }\n\nThe above is how I would use both properties to achieve the end goal you would be looking for.\n\nHope this is helpful! Craig\n\nIt really depends on what you are trying to achieve.\n\nIf you are trying to center a element with a known width then you should be using margin: 0 auto;.\n\nIf you are trying to center the content of an element ( text, images etc.) then you should be using text-align: center.\n\nAlthough it's possible to center block elements with text-align: center by settings it's display to inline ( or inline-block ) and using text-align: center on the container you probably shouldn't."
