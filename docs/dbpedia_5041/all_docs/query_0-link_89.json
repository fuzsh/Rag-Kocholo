I’ll definitively give it a try.\n\nit’s complicated, but you have controls of everything.\n\nUse regular expression rather than pre-defined delimiters.\n\nOptions to control left/right/center alignment.\n\nMaximum number of splits.\n\nhi,\n\nis it possible to specify multiple characters to align on?\n\nFor example open and closing braces.\n\nfrom\n\nfoo(bar) foo1(bar1)\n\nmake\n\nfoo (bar) foo1 (bar1)\n\nRegards\n\nNo idea what you mean… You must specify a regular expression, not a character.\n\nIsn’t (.*?) working for this example ?\n\nhi,\n\nthanks, yes your regex is working for the example above. However, I want to align also on all closing braces (sorry, i forgot that in the example above).\n\nThus, from\n\nfoo(bar) foo1(bar1)\n\nmake\n\nfoo (bar ) foo1 (bar1)\n\n\\(|\\)/l1c0l0c0\n\nNot sure it works.\n\nThis plugin give me headaches every time I use it\n\nIts working! Thanks a lot!\n\nI have updated the plugin to make it more friendly to new users.\n\nCheck it out~\n\ngithub.com/randy3k/AlignTab\n\nThank you very much for such a great plugin!\n\nI love this plug in! But one small hiccup with any == found. They become = = when aligning to first =\n\nso this:\n\n$fieldAutoPopulate == (\"true\") ? $autoPop = \"checked\" : $autoPop = \"\";\n\nbecomes\n\n$fieldAutoPopulate = = (\"true\") ? $autoPop = \"checked\" : $autoPop = \"\";\n\nand it doesn’t work anymore.\n\ntry\n\n(?<!=)=(?!=)/f\n\nhowever, if you use this, it will align the equal sign in $autoPop = \"checked\"\n\nAuto line detection will become not reliable in this situation.\n\nIn this case, you may want to highlight the piece of code before applying the alignment.\n\nFWIW – I outlined a useful (?) use case for tabular data in Markdown here: viewtopic.php?f=2&t=12606&start=10#p49982\n\n[quote=“bizoo”]\\(|\\)/l1c0l0c0\n\nNot sure it works.\n\nThis plugin give me headaches every time I use it [/quote]\n\nThat’s why you can save the regexp as a predefined pattern, so your head only will ache once.\n\nI am now opening a wiki page for examples.\n\nSo, it would be nice if you can provide your examples to the wiki~\n\ngithub.com/randy3k/AlignTab/wiki/Examples\n\nAwesome plugin, thank you! But how do you turn off Table Mode?\n\nwhile you are in table mode, you can press to escape table mode\n\nWould you mind removing the context menuitems and place these in commands instead? These take the place of Cut, Copy and Paste\n\nCurrently maintain the ontology of the menus, is complicated, because we lack some sort of organization… and mutations(features)… but everyone can help…\n\nnot works. Text is still aligned and statusbar still shows “[Table Mode]”\n\nP.S: Using Regex is very slow when aligning large table (painful when in Table Mode). This makes SublimeTableEditor superior in speed.\n\nMaybe an option to disable Regex possible?\n\nshould exit the table mode. could you tell me what version of st and platform you are using?\n\nSublimeTableEditor is definitely superior in a lot of aspects in table editing as aligntab aims for general purpose.\n\nHowever, i am working in a way to improve the speed."
