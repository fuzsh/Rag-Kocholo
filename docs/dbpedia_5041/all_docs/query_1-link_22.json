We have the option to align text to the left, the center, and the right. In a less explicit manner, we can allow gt to automatically choose the alignment of each column based on the data type (with the auto option).\n\nDetails\n\nWhen you create a gt table object using gt(), automatic alignment of column labels and their data cells is performed. By default, left-alignment is applied to columns of class character, Date, or POSIXct; center-alignment is for columns of class logical, factor, or list; and right-alignment is used for the numeric and integer columns.\n\nExamples\n\nLet's use countrypops to create a small gt table. We can change the alignment of the population column with cols_align(). In this example, the label and body cells of population will be aligned to the left.\n\ncountrypops |> dplyr::select(-contains(\"code\")) |> dplyr::filter(country_name == \"San Marino\") |> dplyr::slice_tail(n = 5) |> gt(rowname_col = \"year\", groupname_col = \"country_name\") |> cols_align( align = \"left\", columns = population )"
