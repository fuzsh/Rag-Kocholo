        "text": "You can align layers using the six alignment buttons in the top row of the Design tab in the Inspector.\n\nThe following video shows the basic alignment options for a single layer on an Artboard. You won’t be able to use the alignment tools if you have selected a single layer outside of an Artboard.\n\nHovering over any of the alignment buttons previews how your selected layers will align. This can be particularly useful if you have selected multiple layers.\n\nLayers will always align to their parent. An example of a parent is an Artboard containing a single layer - in this case, the Artboard is the parent. However, if you have an Artboard with a group that contains the layer you want to align, the group is the parent.\n\nIn the example below, the Artboard is the parent of all of the layers within it, so selecting the green circle and aligning it to the top left will align it to the top left of the Artboard.\n\nIn this next example, the green circle, pink rectangle and orange triangle are part of a group within the Artboard, so aligning the green circle will align it within the group’s bounds, rather than to the edge of the Artboard.\n\nArtboards, groups and combined shapes are all parents to any layer they contain.\n\nTo align a single layer to an Artboard rather than its parent group or combined shape, select the layer and hold down ⌥ and click the alignment button you want to use.\n\nHow to align multiple layers\n\nIf you select two or more layers and apply alignment options, their alignment will be based on the edges of your selection’s bounds. For example, if you choose to align layers to the left, all layers will be aligned to the leftmost edge of the layer that is furthest to the left, and vice versa for right alignment. Using the Center option will calculate the central point of all the layers combined and align them along it.\n\nIn the example below, all of the layers are selected and then aligned top left. This aligns all the layers to the top and left extent of the original selection, not the Artboard:\n\nTo override this behavior and align multiple selected layers to the Artboard they are on, select your layers, hold down ⌥ and click the alignment button you want to use.\n\nAligning to a reference layer\n\nTo align objects to a specific reference layer, select all the layers you want to align (including the reference layer). Click again on the reference layer — which will show thicker outline — then use the align option you want.\n\nDistributing layers horizontally and vertically\n\nYou can evenly distribute layers horizontally or vertically using the first two buttons in the top row of the Design tab in the Inspector. To do so, select more than three layers then select a distribute layers option.\n\nWhen you distribute layers and you’re using Pixel Fitting there will be occasions when Sketch cannot place the layers evenly while still adhering to the pixel level alignment. In these cases, you’ll have the choice to:\n\nDistribute Unevenly: maintain alignment at the pixel level, which may cause slight variations in how the layers are distributed\n\nPlace on Sub-pixels: make the distribution exact, which means placing the layers with sub-pixel level alignment\n\nThe following example shows a preview of four horizontally distributed layers.\n\nUsing Tidy to align layers\n\nYou can quickly align multiple layers into a neat grid of evenly distributed rows and columns using the Tidy button, which you’ll find on the top right of the Inspector, in the Design tab.\n\nSelect the layers you want to align and click on the Tidy button — or first hover over the button for a preview of how the changes will look. Your grid will fill the space of your selection and Sketch will attempt to arrange layers evenly in rows and columns. Tidy works on both the horizontal and vertical axis.\n\nIf the layers are roughly in a single column or row you can also enter your preferred vertical or horizontal spacing in the fields next to the Tidy button without having to use Tidy first.\n\nMake Grid\n\nTo make a grid, select a layer and head to Arrange > Make Grid — or drag the handle in the bottom-right corner — to edit the number of columns and rows in your grid. Use the handles to edit the spacing between layers. You can also use the controls in the Inspector to edit the number of cells and spacing in your grid.\n\nYou can make grids out of several layers. Make sure your layers are evenly aligned, select them and drag the bottom-right handle to make your Grid.\n\nMoving multiple layers with Smart Distribute\n\nWith Smart Distribute you can quickly adjust even spacing between multiple layers, horizontally or vertically. To do this, select two or more layers, then click and drag on the handle that appears between them. If you have layers arranged in a grid, you can adjust the spacing between each layer in a horizontal row, as well as the vertical spacing between rows themselves.\n\nSmart Distribute won’t appear if your layers aren’t evenly distributed. To fix this, you can either evenly distribute your layers manually or use the Tidy button.\n\nFor very small selections, or when you’re zoomed far out from your selection, Smart Distribute handles will be hidden, making it easier to see the layers. Try zooming in if you can’t see a set of Smart Distribute layers for your selection.\n\nReordering layers within a Smart Distribute selection\n\nWhen you’ve selected a set of layers with even spacing between them, you can click and drag on the circular handle that appears in the centre of any layer to move it within that selection. The layers around it will automatically reorder to accommodate the one you move.\n\nThis also works for entire Artboards, making it handy for rearranging entire flows on the Canvas.\n\nReordering layers in grid-like layouts\n\nYou can reorder layers in your grid layouts without changing the number of rows or columns in your grid. Select all the layers in your grid, then drag on the circular handle that appears in the centre of any layer to swap it with another.\n\nWhen you select a single layer which is part of a group with even spacing, you can move it with the Smart Distribute controls and adjust the spacing.\n\nPositioning layers relative to the Artboard’s edge"
