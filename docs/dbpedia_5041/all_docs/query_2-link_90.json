        "text": "I've got FactoryTalk View Studio v7.0 and I'm finding the behavior of the alignment commands (align left, right, center, top, bottom, middle) very frustrating. In every other platform I've ever worked on, either the first or last control you select is the anchor and all the other controls align to it; a sensible way to do things. However, FactoryTalk seems to align to the one farthest in the alignment direction (alight left always chooses the control farthest to the left, for example). Center and Middle alignment seems to either choose a random control for the anchor (possibly always the longest/tallest control) or a random point that is almost but not quite the average center position with all controls moving to it. There also seems to be no way to align to the display (centering a header seems to always require me to manually calculate the left offset).\n\nGiven the far flung and limited documentation, I'm wondering if some of you guys have some tips. Ideally, I'd like a way to use a control of my choosing as the anchor and align the other controls to it like every other HMI creation tool on the planet. At the moment, I'm using snap to grid or manually calculating positions. Also, there seems to be no function for setting a selection of controls to the same height or width, is that hidden somewhere?\n\nI have managed to discover I can hold shift and use the arrow keys to move controls 1 pixel at a time. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to shrink/grow a control 1 pixel at a time.\n\nI've gotten used to the alignment tool and I am actually pretty happy with it.\n\nAs for setting controls to the same height and width, open the property panel and just leave that window open on the side of your screen. Then go select each object you want to change (using the CTRL key) and make your changes in the Property Panel.\n\nUnfortunately Rockwell has been reluctant to change something they have done one way for twenty years. You see it in the Logix software as well as in FactoryTalk View (previously RSView32, which was previously ControlView). That consistency is nice in some ways, and frustrating in others.\n\nAlthough I do wish there was a Center on Page, Center Horizontally/Vertically on Page. I will often draw a horizontal line off the usable screen across the top and a vertical on the edge to which I can align objects on the screen.\n\nKeep in mind that \"Snap to Grid\" will potentially throw off some of the center type alignments.\n\nIt definitely needs a nudge type option with the keyboard arrow keys. What passes for a nudge is not terribly useful.\n\nOG\n\nOne way to \"align to page\" workaround that I've found is to create a panel that's the exact size as your page (located at 0,0 of course). Align to center and middle of this panel as needed. Having the panel the full size of the screen \"forces\" other objects to align to it. You can always delete the background panel when finished if necessary.\n\nYou're absolutely right, though, the alignment tools leave much to be desired. After 5 years of working with FT View, I'm no more fond of them now than I was when I started out. In contrast, the controls in Crimson are intuitive and effective. Very shallow learning curve.\n\nI think what I'm about to say is similar to what the others have said...\n\nif you open the property panel and select a horizontal \"line\" of misaligned numeric displays, there will likely be no entry on the \"top\" property.\n\nIf you click on that property, a number will appear... I don't know exactly what it is... an average \"top\" or what... but anyway, once you leave that entry, they will all be aligned to that number... which you can alter, of course\n\nleft, and other properties work similarly."
