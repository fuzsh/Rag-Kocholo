        "text": "If you own a car, you’ve probably heard about the importance of wheel alignment and wheel balancing. Both services extend tire life and improve steering/handling performance, but they shouldn’t be confused for the same thing!\n\nSo, what is the difference between wheel alignment and balancing? Keep reading to find out.\n\nWhat is wheel alignment and balancing?\n\nWheel Alignment\n\nA wheel alignment refers to an adjustment of your vehicle’s suspension (the system that connects a vehicle to its wheels) to make sure the wheels are positioned correctly relative to the road.\n\nThere are three types of angles adjusted during a wheel alignment:\n\nCamber: The inward or outward angle of the tire when viewed from the front of the car.\n\nToe: The inward or outward angle of the tire when viewed from above the vehicle.\n\nCaster: The angle of the steering axis when viewed from the side of the vehicle.\n\nDon’t underestimate the importance of a tire alignment. Without proper alignment, your wheels resist steering commands and your tires wear unevenly. Regular alignments help your tires perform to the best of their ability and last longer.\n\nWheel Balancing\n\nIn contrast, wheel balancing refers to an adjustment of any weight imbalances in a tire/wheel. An out-of-balance tire causes a shaky, uneven ride. If left untreated, the uneven distribution of weight and pressure leads to excessive tire wear and tear, forcing you to replace your tires more often than should be necessary.\n\nTo balance your tires, a technician will dismount the wheels from the vehicle and put them onto a special balancing machine. The machine spins the tire at high speeds to determine where there are imbalances. Then, the technician mounts small wheel weights to the tire and wheel assembly to correct the imbalances.\n\nWhat causes misalignment or unbalanced tires?\n\nWheel Alignment\n\nPotholes\n\nJarring impacts (hitting a curb, fender-benders)\n\nNormal wear and tear\n\nAggressive driving\n\nHeavy loads\n\nWorn/replaced suspension parts\n\nMismatched tires\n\nWheel Balancing\n\nNormal tire wear and imperfections\n\nWorn-out suspension parts\n\nSudden impacts (hitting a curb, fender-benders)\n\nRead: What Pothole Damage Can Do to Your Car\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nWheel Alignment\n\nYour vehicle drifts/pulls to one side when you’re driving on a straight, level road with little to no wind.\n\nYou feel your steering wheel vibrating.\n\nYou are driving straight but your steering wheel isn’t centered.\n\nYou notice uneven tire wear:\n\nSawteeth: Feel your tire. Does the sensation remind you of saw teeth?\n\nFeathering: Do you notice scuffing across your tire tread, or smooth sides alternating with sharp sides?\n\nOne-sided shoulder wear: If you notice that one side of your tire is wearing down faster than the other, this is one-sided shoulder wear.\n\nWheel Balancing\n\nYou experience vibrations that increase as the vehicle speeds up.\n\nIf you feel the vibration mostly in the steering wheel, the problem is most likely in the front wheels.\n\nIf the vibration is mostly in the seat, the problem is probably in the rear wheel.\n\nYour notice that your tires have an irregular tread wear pattern. The most common patterns we see on unbalanced tires are scalloped or cupped tire wear patterns.\n\nHow much do they cost?\n\nWheel Alignment\n\nHow much a wheel alignment costs varies depending on the repair shop and the vehicle, but it’s typically between $100-$200. At Virginia Tire & Auto, we use cutting-edge technology from Hunter Engineering to accurately evaluate and adjust the angles of your vehicle’s wheels.\n\nA Computerized Alignment service at Virginia Tire & Auto costs $119.99, and a Premium Alignment service costs $179.99. Both services come with a 6-month, 6,000-mile warranty.\n\nMost cars need a Computerized Alignment, but a Premium Alignment is required for European cars because of their complex steering, suspension and computer systems.\n\nWheel Balancing\n\nA typical wheel balance service costs anywhere from $15–$50 per tire.\n\nAt Virginia Tire & Auto, we offer two types of tire balancing: standard balancing and Road Force balancing. Standard balancing costs $20 per tire and comes FREE with any tire purchase at Virginia Tire & Auto. It addresses any up-and-down imbalances and comes with a 6-month, 6,000-mile warranty.\n\nRoad Force balancing uses specialized equipment to solve balancing issues that a standard balance cannot fix. It costs $40 per tire, but, barring any damage to the wheel assembly, you’ll only need to get a Road Force Balance once in the life of the tire.\n\nHow often should you get it done?\n\nLike most car maintenance services, there is no absolute answer to how often you should get an alignment or tire balance. There are a lot of factors to consider, including\n\nhow frequently you drive your vehicle\n\nthe quality of the roads you drive on\n\nthe quality of your tires\n\nYou should check your vehicle’s owner’s manual to find out what the manufacturer recommends. But generally, wheel balancing is typically required more often than wheel alignment.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to have your wheel alignment and balance checked every 12,000–15,000 miles or once a year (unless you’ve had a Road Force Balance service). You should also get your alignment checked and your wheels balanced anytime you install new tires. Doing so will help cut down on repairs and fuel costs and give you peace of mind on the road.\n\nAlignment & Balancing Services at Virginia Tire & Auto\n\nEvery tire purchase at Virginia Tire & Auto comes with tires&, our easy-installation and worry-free driving package, which helps you save on wheel alignment and balance services. Tires& includes our standard balancing service as well as a FREE alignment check."
