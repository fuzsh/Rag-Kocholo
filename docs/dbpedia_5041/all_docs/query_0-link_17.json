For example:\n\nA mobile header with a page title at top center with a back/close/home button on left/right.\n\nI know I can align everything left or right, then use the spacing to push the innermost object toward the center, but at best I’m just eyeballing it. Rather, I’d like it to be placed dead center every time, while the second object is a specific distance from the edge every time.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHi Eric!\n\nThere is a way to do that in Figma, although it is a bit tricky.\n\nYou would have to create 2 frames for the left object and center one.\n\nThen in the parent frame (which contains both), you need offset the left object by its width (which you should have set as fixed). The center object will be filled (so it fills the width of the container and set to middle in auto layout.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n@Nate_G Your example works but I believe he is looking for something else.\n\nIn his case, he is only looking to center the 2nd object and he only has another object either to the left or right of it (not one or more on EACH side as your example shows).\n\nMy example should work for his case."
