        "text": "A client is asking me to replicate an email they used to have which I don’t have access to. I have literally no idea how this was previously done as saying it out loud sounds impossible.\n\nAt the bottom of their email signature they have a blue line then a disclaimer that conforms perfectly to the line. Both the left and right side of the text align perfectly.\n\nHowevever, when I try to replicate this in Word this is my result.\n\nI can’t get the right side of each sentence to align and I have no idea how to do this. Does anyone know?\n\n@larryg-profile ​ I tried to take the existing paragraph I had and selected Justify but nothing changed. I then started a new paragraph and made sure Justify was selected and then manually entered in the paragraph which resulted in the picture I provided earlier.\n\n@markross0326 ​ I just tried to adjust my margins but it didn’t have any effect either. Ended up needing to make left/right 4.6 cm to be able to fit the full sentence, but it just looks the same as it did at the start\n\n@spiceuser-jb9a5 ​\n\nI’m not sure which mode I’m in…I’m able to edit the doc though. I turned on rulers and slided them over and it’s still not working.\n\n@markross0326\n\n​Yes, in the actual Word 2019 document. I created a new doc and tried to copy the text in to notepad per @solomint ​ suggestion then in to the doc and then justified it. As per above imagine, still not working the way it should. At this point it has to be something wrong with my program right?"
