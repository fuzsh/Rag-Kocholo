        "text": "Alignments help keep your wheels pointed in the right direction. When your wheels are misaligned, you may experience a few uncomfortable and potentially dangerous symptoms, such as reduced fuel economy, premature tire wear, and difficulty steering.\n\nHere’s why wheel alignments are an important part of vehicle maintenance and how to tell when it’s time to schedule your wheel alignment service.\n\nWHAT IS A WHEEL ALIGNMENT?\n\nDespite the name, a wheel alignment (also known as tire alignment) isn’t an adjustment of the wheels and tires themselves. A wheel alignment service is done by adjusting your car’s steering and suspension, which connects your vehicle to its wheels. Proper alignment is achieved by adjusting the angles of your tires, which impacts how they make contact with the road. Every vehicle’s optimal alignment angles are dependent upon the make, model, and manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nDO I NEED A WHEEL ALIGNMENT?\n\nWheel alignment is necessary for the best possible driving experience. Every vehicle comes preset with specific tire angles and positioning. In order for your vehicle to travel the way it’s supposed to, your wheels need to be precisely aligned to OEM specifications. Misalignment can lead to uneven tire wear, poor handling, and shorter tire life. Keeping your tires properly aligned can help them last longer.\n\nHOW OFTEN DO YOU NEED A WHEEL ALIGNMENT?\n\nHow often you need a wheel alignment depends on your typical road conditions and how you drive your vehicle. It's important to note that bad roads can often be the cause of alignment issues. If you frequently ride over potholes, drive down poorly maintained roads, or even hit a curb, your alignment can be affected.\n\nThe general recommendation is to have your alignment checked at the first signs of misalignment or around every 6,000 miles. Your vehicle manufacturer may also recommend an alignment inspection as part of the vehicle’s ongoing maintenance.\n\nHOW WILL A WHEEL ALIGNMENT HELP MY VEHICLE?\n\nA tire alignment ensures optimal drivability. From helping your tires last longer and keeping your vehicle driving smoother to ensuring your wheels are pointed in the right direction, regular wheel alignments provide many great benefits. Alignment issues can also cause your car to guzzle gas more quickly, so an alignment can potentially lead to a more efficient ride as well.\n\nWHAT DOES TIRE WEAR MEAN TO MY CAR’S ALIGNMENT?\n\nPoor alignment is a common cause of uneven tire wear. Ideally, you should see even wear across your tires’ treads if you also keep up with tire rotations. If you notice excessive wear, you may need an alignment adjustment or have too much junk in your trunk.\n\nPoor alignment can shorten your tires’ lifespan by thousands of miles. Enjoy better fuel economy and longer-lasting tires by having your alignment checked at least at the first sign of uneven or premature tire wear.\n\nHOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED A WHEEL ALIGNMENT?\n\nThere are a few noticeable signs you need an alignment. Just use your eyes, ears, and hands. Here are some common signs that you may be dealing with poor alignment:\n\nYour vehicle pulls to one side\n\nUneven or rapid tire wear\n\nYour steering wheel is crooked when driving straight\n\nSquealing tires\n\nShaking or vibrating steering wheel\n\nYour steering wheel feels loose or unresponsive\n\nIf you’re noticing any of these alignment symptoms, schedule an alignment check at Firestone Complete Auto Care to get your ride pointed in the right direction.\n\nWHAT CAN I DO TO HELP MAINTAIN MY ALIGNMENT?\n\nWhile wheel alignments require professionals and professional equipment, there are steps you can take to help maintain your alignment. Here are some tips:\n\nRemove heavy, bulky items from your trunk. If you have too much weight loading down your back end, it can temporarily throw off your alignment. Remove what you don’t need.Maintain correct air pressure in your tires. If one corner of your vehicle is running lower due to underinflation, it can temporarily throw off your alignment.Slow down and try to avoid potholes and curbs. Embracing conservative driving habits can help place less strain on steering and suspension components, which are key to maintaining proper alignment.\n\nLET FIRESTONE HANDLE YOUR ALIGNMENT ISSUES\n\nFirestone Complete Auto Care offers different alignment service options so you can choose the one that best fits your needs: standard wheel alignment and lifetime wheel alignment.\n\nDuring a standard alignment service, a technician will inspect your vehicle's camber, caster, and toe angles (when applicable), tire wear and condition, suspension system, and more. We'll also make adjustments where needed.\n\nWith our lifetime wheel alignment service, you'll enjoy all of the benefits of standard service. Plus, you'll be eligible to receive alignments every 6 months (or every 6,000 miles), free of charge, for as long as you own the vehicle*.\n\nTire misalignment can be so subtle you may not even realize it. If you are unsure about your current alignment, call on your local Firestone Complete Auto Care. Why wait? Trust our precision equipment and expertise to check your alignment and fix it if needed today!"
