I've been trying with align=right and align=left, but it has no effect.\n\nI have this in my header:\n\n!ABC:Business^Logo.png|width=300, vspace=4, align=left!\n\nI've been trying and trying, but with no luck. I've tried changing the size of the picture (which works), but it still centers. I've also tried changing stuff I have no clue about, like vspace=1, hspace=1, etc.\n\nCan anyone help me before I go mad? :(\n\nThanks in advance!"
