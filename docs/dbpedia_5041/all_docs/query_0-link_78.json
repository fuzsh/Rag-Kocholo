        "text": "Center Align Elements\n\nTo horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;\n\nSetting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.\n\nThe element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:\n\nThis div element is centered.\n\nNote: Center aligning has no effect if the width property is not set (or set to 100%).\n\nCenter Align Text\n\nTo just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center;\n\nThis text is centered.\n\nTip: For more examples on how to align text, see the CSS Text chapter.\n\nCenter an Image\n\nTo center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element:\n\nLeft and Right Align - Using position\n\nOne method for aligning elements is to use position: absolute;:\n\nNote: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.\n\nLeft and Right Align - Using float\n\nAnother method for aligning elements is to use the float property:\n\nThe clearfix Hack\n\nThen we can add the clearfix hack to the containing element to fix this problem:\n\nCenter Vertically - Using padding\n\nThere are many ways to center an element vertically in CSS. A simple solution is to use top and bottom padding:\n\nI am vertically centered.\n\nTo center both vertically and horizontally, use padding and text-align: center:\n\nI am vertically and horizontally centered.\n\nCenter Vertically - Using line-height\n\nAnother trick is to use the line-height property with a value that is equal to the height property:\n\nI am vertically and horizontally centered.\n\nCenter Vertically - Using position & transform\n\nIf padding and line-height are not options, another solution is to use positioning and the transform property:\n\nI am vertically and horizontally centered.\n\nTip: You will learn more about the transform property in our 2D Transforms Chapter.\n\nCenter Vertically - Using Flexbox\n\nYou can also use flexbox to center things. Just note that flexbox is not supported in IE10 and earlier versions:\n\nI am vertically and horizontally centered.\n\nTip: You will learn more about Flexbox in our CSS Flexbox Chapter.\n\nTest Yourself With Exercises\n\nExercise:\n\nUse the margin property to make sure that the <div> element is center aligned according to its parent element.\n\n<style> .intro { width: 200px; : ; } </style> <body> <div class=\"intro\"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n\nconsectetur adipiscing elit.\n\nPhasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum,\n\nnisi lorem egestas odio,\n\nvitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. </div> </body>\n\nStart the Exercise"
