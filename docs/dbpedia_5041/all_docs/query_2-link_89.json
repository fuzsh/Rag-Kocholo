Just take a short look at the result I posted. Note that most output destinations apart from LISTING will automatically left-align all character values, and discard any leading blanks. But that does NOT change the value stored in the variables. If you want further proof, run this:\n\ndata want; set have; length char $8; char = right(put(number,best8.)); char_hex = put(char,$hex16.); run;\n\nand you will see the blanks (hex 20) in the variable.\n\nPlease state exactly what you are aiming for.\n\nHi @thanikondharish\n\nI agree with @Kurt_Bremser\n\nDon't rely on the viewer to assess the alignment (the font has not the same size for all characters : a dot is \"smaller\" than a digit, ..)\n\nAs an alternative to the right function, you can also use the '-r' modifier in the put statement:\n\nchar=put(number, best8. -r);\n\nBest,\n\nIn the code example I gave you, you can see in the hex display that there are NO trailing spaces stored AT ALL.\n\nIf you run different code, show us.\n\n@thanikondharish wrote:\n\nNote tralaing.\n\nThere is no correct alignment as my point of view\n\nIn my occasionally humble opinion the alignment of values in a data set is completely irrelevant.\n\nSince alignment really only affects people reading the data for most cases then when the data is written out in a report is when any alignment becomes important. And the reporting procedures have a number of methods to adjust alignment.\n\nOf if the data is to be written to a text file read by another program then use appropriate syntax to align things at the time the text file is created."
