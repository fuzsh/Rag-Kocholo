        "text": "You have probably heard of a Front-End alignment, but you might not be as familiar with what it is or why it is so important. When you own a vehicle, routine maintenance is critical for keeping it in good condition and preventing larger issues from happening. This service is a part of the routine maintenance that all vehicles require to ensure that they remain in working order.\n\nHow Does a Front-End Alignment Compare to a Wheel Alignment?\n\nIn most cases, the primary difference between the two services is that a Front-End alignment focuses on the front two wheels while a wheel alignment is on all four wheels. Overall, the services are mostly the same in terms of the process, its importance and when the service should be performed. Your technician can help you determine if you only need your front wheels aligned or if it is a good idea to take care of all four when you go in for an inspection.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of a Front-End Alignment?\n\nThe purpose of a Front-End alignment is to ensure that your suspension components are adjusted to the proper angles. It is important to make sure that you can drive your vehicle safely. When your wheels are within the proper alignment, it can save your tires and reduce their overall wear, and it might also help to enhance your gas mileage. This decreases steering column wear and helps to ensure that your vehicle has the right level of handling so that it is easier and more comfortable to drive.\n\nThere are many reasons why your Front-End might fall out of alignment.

It is important that someone with the right experience carries out the process to make sure that it is done properly. Every vehicle has its own set of alignment specifications that must be met in order for the job to be successful. Many places utilize an alignment machine to help ensure that the job is completed properly and to the exact vehicle specifications.\n\nWhat Is the Time Requirement for This Service?\n\nHow long does a front-end alignment take? For most vehicles, it takes approximately one hour to perform this service. However, your vehicle, how much aligning it requires, and how busy the service center is, plays a role in how long you might wait for the job to be completed.\n\nWhat Is the Average Cost of This Service?\n\nHow much does a front-end alignment cost? Ultimately, the best option for determining the cost is to contact your car service center and request a quote. You might need to take your vehicle in for the quote to be as accurate as possible. On average, you might expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 for the service. Sun Devil Auto front-end alignments start as low as $59.00.
