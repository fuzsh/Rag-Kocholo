Sometimes I need this behavior and instead it selects multiple objects, like that:\n\nI fear that because they are both the same shortcut there may be some hidden rule telling which case will work when, but it’s really p*ssing me off that I can’t figure it out.\n\nWhich is the correct way to move objects using the gshift] shortcut and trigger auto align?"
