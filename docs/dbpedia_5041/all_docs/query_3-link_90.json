        "text": "Proper motor pump alignment helps ensure your equipment has longer life spans while requiring fewer repairs and costly downtime. Here we’ll explain what motor/pump alignment is, why it’s so important, and why your maintenance staff need alignment training.\n\nWhat is Motor Pump Alignment?\n\nA motor/pump combination requires the shafts of both pieces of equipment join at a coupling point. The two shaft centerlines must be aligned so they rotate on a common, or collinear, axis.\n\nBenefits of Motor Pump Alignment\n\nMaintaining motor pump alignment offers multiple benefits, including:\n\nMinimizing the force on the seals and bearings of both machines,\n\nReducing coupling wear,\n\nLower energy costs,\n\nIncreased life cycle of motor and pump components,\n\nLess downtime for repairs,\n\nReduced parts expenses,\n\nReduced inventory parts requirements.\n\nConsequences of Misaligned Motor / Pump Shafts\n\nMisalignment of motor/pump shafts increases the rate of wear and tear on your equipment, while increasing the amount of energy the motor/pump system consumes by up to fifteen percent. In addition, misalignment increases the risk of a number of mechanical issues, including:\n\nCoupling overheating and extreme wear,\n\nDry element coupling fatigue,\n\nPump and driver shaft failure,\n\nPump and driver bearing overload,\n\nDamaging machinery vibrations.\n\nRepairs related to misaligned motor/pump shafts result in system downtime and a corresponding loss of productivity. Proper maintenance by staff trained in hydraulic troubleshooting helps keep motor/pump shaft’s aligned, reducing the risk of costly repairs.\n\nWhen to Align Motor/Pump Shafts?\n\nAligning motor/pump shafts is not a “fix it and forget it” task. Alignment is required:\n\nDuring initial pump / motor installation,\n\nAfter servicing motors and pumps,\n\nWhenever operating temperatures change,\n\nAs part of scheduled preventative maintenance.\n\nAligning shafts during installation is a multi-step process, with alignment checked before the baseplate is grouted, after grouting, after connecting piping, and after the equipment’s first run.\n\nHow to Align Motor/Pump Shafts\n\nWhen aligning motor/pump shafts it’s important to think in three dimensions. Shaft misalignment may be expressed in terms of offset (the two shafts do not match together but are still parallelly aligned) and angularity (the shafts meet at different angles at the coupling site). This creates four types of misalignment:\n\nHorizontal offset,\n\nHorizontal angularity,\n\nVertical offset,\n\nVertical angularity.\n\nIn most cases, the pump is permanently or semi-permanently installed, while the motor is the movable machine. Alignment, therefore, requires moving the motor in relation to the pump shaft.\n\nThe motor may be aligned vertically by shimming the motor feet. To align the motor horizontally, tools such as jacking bolts, pry bars, and hammers are required.\n\nMotor/Pump Alignment Tools\n\nBefore physically aligning motor/pump shafts, the amount of offset and angularity needs calculating. Three alignment calculation methods are most often used:\n\nStraight Edge and Feeler Gauges: Used mostly for smaller motor / pump setups or in environments too cramped for other alignment methods, straight edge and feeler gauges rely on estimated shim changes, achieving alignment through the process of trial and error. One of the least expensive but least accurate alignment methods.\n\nIndicator Dial Indicators: A single dial indicator is laid on the pump shaft to read the level of the motor shaft, allowing maintenance crews to calculate shim changes to motor feet height. In the more complex reverse indicator method a dial indicator also reads from the motor shaft to the pump shaft. Mathematical formulas are then used to calculate alignment changes.\n\nLaser-optic Devices: By far the most accurate way to calculate motor/pump alignment, pulsating laser devices determine shaft positions, relaying the information to a microprocessor that calculates needed alignment changes. While expensive, laser-optic devices offer a degree of accuracy that other alignment tools lack and are easily mastered by employees after short periods of training.\n\nWhy Your Employees Should be Trained on Motor/Pump Alignment\n\nCost savings are the primary reason to train employees in pump maintenance. A well-maintained motor/pump combination has a longer lifecycle and fewer failures than unmaintained systems. Fewer system repairs mean less downtime and fewer interruptions in production. Motor/pump alignment issues are responsible for many pump-related issues—issues you can avoid with a few days of training."
