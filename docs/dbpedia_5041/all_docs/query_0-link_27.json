If the cross-size of the item is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.\n\nbaseline, first baseline, last baseline\n\nSpecifies participation in first- or last-baseline alignment: aligns the alignment baseline of the box's first or last baseline set with the corresponding baseline in the shared first or last baseline set of all the boxes in its baseline-sharing group. The fallback alignment for first baseline is start, the one for last baseline is end.\n\nstretch\n\nIf the combined size of the items along the cross axis is less than the size of the alignment container and the item is auto-sized, its size is increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by max-height/max-width (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size of all auto-sized items exactly fills the alignment container along the cross axis.\n\nanchor-center\n\nIn the case of anchor-positioned elements, aligns the item to the center of the associated anchor element in the block direction. See Centering on the anchor using anchor-center.\n\nsafe\n\nIf the size of the item overflows the alignment container, the item is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were start.\n\nunsafe"
