        "text": "Alignment basics\n\nWhen your alignment is off, your tires are not pointing in the same direction. This will affect 4 things:\n\nSteering\n\nSuspension\n\nSafety\n\nDurability of tires\n\nAre there any warning lights to indicate alignment problem?\n\nNo, there aren’t. The best solution is to get it checked regularly.\n\nToe\n\nThe vehicle’s toe is the most critical alignment settings that affect tire wear. A slight misalignment of the toe will result in a reduction in tire life.\n\nFor minimum tire wear and power loss, the wheels of a vehicle should be pointing straight ahead. So why most vehicles have their front wheels toe-in? This is to ensure directional stability\n\nIncrease toe in can reduce oversteer, steady the car and enhance high speed stability\n\nIncrease toe out will reduce understeer and free up the car\n\nWhat’s the relationship between alignment and tire wear?\n\nIdeally, tires should wear evenly across the thread. Poor alignment causes uneven wear and can shorten a tire’s life by thousands of kilometers. Crucial steering and suspension parts might be affected as well. To minimize the frequency of tire change and better fuel efficiency, have your wheel alignment checked.\n\nHow often should you get your alignment checked?\n\nWe recommend an alignment check with every other oil change. A lot happens over the course of 10,000 km. With the vast amount of potholes on the road in Massachusetts, your alignment would be thrown off even faster. The longer you wait for an alignment, the more damages will occur.\n\nDo vehicles have different types of alignment specifications?\n\nDifferent car models have different alignment specifications which are determined by the manufacturers. We use a special computerized alignment machine that is pre-loaded with every vehicle’s alignment specifications. Once the vehicle type is determined, the high tech and precise measuring begins.\n\nWhy is it so hard to determine if the alignment is off?\n\nWe cannot view a misalignment purely by the naked eye. With technology, we are able to diagnose the symptoms and signs of a misalignment which will have a huge impact on tire life.\n\nSymptoms of misalignment\n\nHowever, there are some noticeable signs of misalignment:\n\nVehicle pulling to the left or right\n\nUneven or rapid tyre wear\n\nSteering is crooked when driving straight\n\nCapability of the wheel alignment machine\n\nMeasure and set all 4 tyres to the settings of the manufacturer\n\nProvide the most accurate reading available\n\nSettings of all vehicles are pre-loaded in the system\n\nProcess of wheel alignment\n\nInspect steering and suspension system, including tyre condition and air pressure\n\nPlace vehicle on alignment rack, mount and calibrate sensors\n\nPrint out initial alignment settings\n\nAdjust camber, caster & toe angles\n\nPrint out final alignment readings\n\nRoad test vehicles to make sure alignment is not off"
