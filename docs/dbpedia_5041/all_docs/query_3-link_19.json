        "text": "How does translation alignment work?\n\nTranslation alignment works by using an alignment tool to compare source and target language files side by side. This tool identifies and pairs corresponding segments, aligning them to establish connections between the original content and its translation. Within the tool, you can review the alignments and make amendments, if necessary, before importing the translation units into a translation memory. Translation memories store your previous translations for future use, helping you translate even faster.\n\nWhat are the benefits of translation alignment?\n\nWith translation alignment, you can:\n\nAccelerate translation memory creation: Translation alignment eliminates the need to start a translation memory from square one. Instead, you can use your pre-existing translated documents to create a translation memory.\n\nSave time and effort: The toolâ€™s automation eliminates the need to manually identify corresponding segments, saving time and reducing the manual effort required in building translation memories.\n\nIncrease consistency: By aligning previously translated content, you avoid duplicating translation efforts for identical or similar sentences, leading to efficient resource utilization. Aligned translation units can be repurposed across various projects, ensuring the consistent use of terminology and phrasing.\n\nIs it possible to align several translated documents?\n\nYes, within the alignment tool, you can choose whether to align a single file pair or multiple files.\n\nAlign single file pair: Suitable when you want to pair one source document to its corresponding target document and generate one single alignment result file. You can then send the translation units resulting from the aligned source and target documents to your specified translation memory.\n\nAlign multiple files: For when you want to align several pairs of files at the same time. This generates an alignment result file for each pair of source and target documents. You can then send the translation units that result for all the generated alignment result files to the same translation memory."
