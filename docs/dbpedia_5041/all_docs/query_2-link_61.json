        "text": "Align Dates and Locations to the Right Using Tab Stops\n\nYou know that your resume often serves as your first impression.\n\nAs a result, it’s important to pay attention to seemingly minor details (such as how your dates are aligned).\n\nWe’ll show you how to perfectly align dates on your resume every single time – without having to hit the “space” bar over and over!\n\nHow to Align Dates on Your Resume Using Tab Stops\n\nThe easiest way to align your dates is to use tab stops.\n\nIn this example, we’ll show you exactly how to do so in Microsoft Word.\n\nLet’s imagine you’re looking to right-align the dates highlighted in yellow below.\n\nStep 1\n\nDrop the cursor right before the “M” in “March 2016,” as shown in the blue circle.\n\nStep 2\n\nOpen Paragraph Settings by clicking the icon circled in red above.\n\nStep 3\n\nUnder Paragraph Settings, select Tabs.\n\nIf you haven’t used them before, tab stops are simply a way to align text with one click using the tab key on your keyboard.\n\nStep 4\n\nOnce you have the Tabs window open, you’ll need to make three selections:\n\n1) Tab stop position\n\nThe tab stop position tells Word where you want text aligned on the page. In our example, the right-most position falls at 7.5 inches (see green circle below), so we input 7.5 (as shown in the red circle).\n\nYou may need to adjust your tab stop position depending on how big your margins are, however.\n\n2) Alignment\n\nSelect Right to make sure the text is aligned right, as shown in the blue circle.\n\nThis setting will ensure your text is flush right at the 7.5-inch mark where you place the tab.\n\n3) Leader\n\nThe leader option allows you to insert a series of dots, dashes, or a line between the “Head of Customer Experience” title and the dates.\n\nWhile these leaders may work well when creating a table of contents for a report, for example, we’ll select None.\n\nOnce you have the correct inputs, click OK.\n\nStep 5\n\nWith the cursor still in front of the “M” in “March 2016,” press the tab key on your keyboard.\n\nYour dates should now be right-aligned correctly!\n\nYou’ll know you have a tab in place when you see the symbol in the red circle above.\n\nIf you need to adjust your tab, you can double-click on this symbol or simply drag it along the ruler to the desired position.\n\nStep 6\n\nRepeat the process.\n\nTo quickly recreate existing tab stops, you can copy and paste the paragraph with the tab stop onto another line.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the format painter option to apply the same settings to a new paragraph.\n\nWhy it’s Important to Align Dates on Your Resume\n\nIf your date alignment is messy or inconsistent, it can signal a lack of attention to detail to recruiters.\n\nIt can also make them assume that you don’t have a strong command of Microsoft Word, which is expected in today’s hiring market.\n\nSimply put, it’s worth investing a bit of extra effort to avoid the risk of leaving such an impression.\n\nIn Summary\n\nBy following the steps outlined above, you’ll not only save time on formatting but also ensure that it is consistent 100% of the time.\n\nIf you prefer to start with a resume template that already has tab stops in place, use one of our executive resume templates.\n\nAbout Resume Pilots\n\nResume Pilots is an award-winning executive resume writing firm and a proud member of the Professional Association of Resume Writers and Career Coaches.
