The standard verse environment would just break automatically and indent the second line. I am not so happy with that solution, and anyway I want to use the quoting environment for its flexibility. I would now actually like to try the following: Manually break the line, and right align its second half. But I don't quite get it working the way I want, I don't think I understand yet how \\raggedleft works, see the following example:\n\n\\begin{document} Some text here. \\begin{quoting} Here some metrical text, longer than one line, and I want the {\\raggedleft second line to be right aligned.\\quad 1\\par} %The result of the two lines above looks about what %I want, but curiously \"second\" remains in the first line. Here some metrical text, longer than one line, and I want the\\\\ {\\raggedleft second line to be right aligned.\\quad 1\\par} and another line. %And if I force a line break, the first line gets indented oddly. \\end{quoting} \\end{document}"
