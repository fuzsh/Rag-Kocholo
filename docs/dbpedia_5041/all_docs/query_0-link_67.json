        "text": "Looks like it relates to Right To Left language support. Try hitting:\n\nLeftShift+LeftControl\n\nat the same time to see if it resolves.\n\nIf you want to align to left then simply hold \"CTRL\" and then press \"LEFT SHIFT\"\n\nIf you want to align to right then simply hold \"CTRL\" and the press \"RIGHT SHIFT\".\n\nOkay, none of the above worked for me and i think i found a solution which works well on my Chrome for Windows 10. Holding Ctrl and then pressing the right Shift button moves the text in address bar to right. Holding Ctrl and then pressing the left Shift button moves it back to the left. Hope this solves your problem.\n\nI've done this so many times to myself you'd think I'd know it by heart... but I don't. I don't even have access to a Windows machine right now to give more exact details. But essentially, you should be able to right-click the address box and somewhere in the context menu there should be right-to-left and left-to-right alignment options...\n\nAs for what keys were pressed to do that? I don't know. I've yet to figure that one out myself.\n\nI am using Chrome on a Mac, the only way I found how to change text alignment (when typing) is to right click on the text box - 'writing direction' - RTL\\LTR.\n\nto view a page in a different alignment I use this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switch-direction/fldkjfjmcadcklboajlnclnfjpdopcce\n\nif someone can tell how to change text alignment using a shortcut key that will be great!"
