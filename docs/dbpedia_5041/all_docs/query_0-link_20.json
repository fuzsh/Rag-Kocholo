You can also indent the first line of paragraphs to create a visual break that helps readers scan text.\n\nSelect the text whose margins you want to modify.\n\nDo any of the following:\n\nIn the ruler, drag the margin marker (the blue triangle) and the first line indent marker (the blue rectangle) to where you want them. If you donâ€™t see rulers, click in the toolbar, then choose Show Rulers.\n\nClick the Style button near the top of the sidebar, then click one of the default indent buttons in the Alignment section to increase or decrease the indent of an entire paragraph.\n\nClick the Text tab at the top of the sidebar, click the Layout button below the paragraph style, then click the disclosure arrow next to Indents."
