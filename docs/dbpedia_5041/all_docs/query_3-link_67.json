        "meta_description": "d accurate 3-dimensional (3D) planning of orthopaedic surgery, automatic calculation of the lower-limb alignment from 3D bone models is required. The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and apply a method that automatically quantifies the parameters defining lower-limb alignment from computed tomographic (CT) scans.\r\r\nMethods: \r\r\nCT scans of the lower extremities of 50 subjects were both manually and automatically segmented. Thirty-two manual landmarks were positioned twice on the bone segmentations to assess intraobserver reliability in a subset of 20 subjects. The landmarks were also positioned automatically using a shape-fitting algorithm. The landmarks were then used to calculate 25 angles describing the lower-limb alignment for all 50 subjects.\r\r\nResults: \r\r\nThe mean absolute difference (and standard deviation) between repeat measurements using the manual method was 2.01 ± 1.64 mm for the landmark positions and 1.05° ± 1.48° for the landmark angles, whereas the mean absolute difference between the manual and fully automatic methods was 2.17 ± 1.37 mm for the landmark positions and 1.10° ± 1.16° for the landmark angles. The manual method required approximately 60 minutes of manual interaction, compared with 12 minutes of computation time for the fully automatic method. The intraclass correlation coefficient showed good to excellent reliability between the manual and automatic assessments for 23 of 25 angles, and the same was true for the intraobserver reliability in the manual method. The mean for the 50 subjects was within the expected range for 18 of the 25 automatically calculated angles.\r\r\nConclusions: \r\r\nWe developed a method that automatically calculated a comprehensive range of 25 measurements that defined lower-limb alignment in considerably less time, and with differences relative to the manual method that were comparable to the differences between repeated manual assessments. This method could thus be used as an efficient alternative to manual assessment of alignment.\r\r\nLevel of Evidence: \r\r\nDiagnostic Level III.

        "text": "Surgical correction of a lower-limb malalignment typically consists of an osteotomy in the femur and/or tibia. For surgical planning, the malalignment is quantified using predefined landmarks and angles, such as the center points of the femoral head, knee, and ankle, which define the mechanical hip-knee-ankle (mHKA) angle. Paley1 described these angles, and the methods to restore the alignment, for almost all types of malalignments.\n\nConventionally, these angles are measured on 2-dimensional (2D) radiographs to define the malalignment in the frontal and sagittal planes. The introduction of 3-dimensional (3D) imaging and planning now enables more accurate quantification of bone geometry, in particular the tibial and femoral torsion2,3. Additionally, it enables the use of image-based guidance technologies and personalized surgical cutting guides and implants that could increase surgical accuracy and efficiency4–7.\n\nReproducible landmark placement is essential for accurate alignment assessment. Studies of intraobserver and interobserver reliability showed that standardized definitions for each landmark were crucial to obtaining reproducible alignment parameters8,9. Differences were found between measurements performed on 2D and 3D images, both due to the difference between the natures of these measurement modalities10 and the difference in limb loading between patients in the supine and standing positions10,11. Fürmetz et al.9 proposed definitions for the manual placement of 24 different landmarks, such as the points on the femoral head, the femoral and tibial condyles, and the tibial plafond, to establish standardized protocols for alignment measurements.\n\nVarious methods to automate anatomical landmark placement have been proposed to reduce both time and interobserver variation. Subburaj et al.12,13 proposed methods that used the bone surface curvature. Several studies used alignment of the axis of inertia, model cross-sections, or shape-fitting14–16. Other authors matched statistical shape models (SSMs) of bones annotated with predefined landmarks to the bones of new patients17–20. All of these methods required initial manual segmentation of the bones. Furthermore, none of these methods provided all of the landmarks and angles defined by Paley.\n\nIn this study, we introduced a fully automatic method for lower-limb malalignment assessment from computed tomography (CT). We employed this method twice: first, to validate the automatic approach by comparing manual, semi-automatic, and automatic landmark and angle calculations for 20 subjects and to compare the time needed for the different methods; and second, to automatically quantify the variation in lower-limb alignment for 50 subjects and to compare the results to the normal variation.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFigure 1 shows the step-by-step manual and automatic workflows for assessment of lower-limb alignment. The steps are explained in detail below.\n\nData\n\nBilateral, non-weight-bearing, lower-limb CT scans of 50 subjects in the supine position were obtained retrospectively from the UMC (University Medical Center) Utrecht as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) data and were used without reformatting. Detailed scan parameters have been previously described by Kuiper et al.21. The subjects had no previous clinical indication of lower-limb malalignment and had undergone a CT scan because of unrelated medical reasons (e.g., vascular indications). The study was judged not to be subject to the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) by the Medical Ethical Committee, as described in institutional review board protocol number 16-612/C.\n\nManual Segmentation\n\nThe femur and tibia were labeled as such and segmented in each scan by 2 operators with 2 years of experience, using both the CT Bone Segmentation module and manual editing available in Mimics (Mimics Medical 21.0; Materialise). Each operator performed the segmentation of 25 subjects.\n\nAutomatic Segmentation\n\nAn artificial intelligence-based workflow was used for automatic segmentation. The details of this method have been described by Kuiper et al.21. The workflow used a neural network to segment 6 different bones: the femur, tibia, fibula, hip, talus, and calcaneus. Only the femoral and tibial segmentations were used in this study. The differences between the manual and automatic segmentations were quantified by 4 commonly used metrics22: the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the mean absolute surface distance (MASD), the Hausdorff distance (HD), and the 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95). Both manual and automatic segmentations were converted to triangulated 3D models using the marching cubes algorithm23.\n\nManual Landmarks\n\nThirty-two landmarks based on the methods proposed by Fürmetz et al.9, but adapted to include all landmarks defined by Paley1, were positioned twice on each of the 3D bone models of 20 randomly chosen subjects by 1 trained observer (R.J.A.K.), using the open-source software 3D Slicer24, to establish the intraobserver reliability. A 1-week interval between the 2 measurements was introduced to reduce memorization bias. The acronym and definition of each landmark are summarized in Table I and are shown in Figure 2. Landmarks were defined using a single point, with the exception of the following.\n\nTABLE I - Definition of All Landmarks Necessary to Calculate the Lower-Limb Alignment Angles as Defined by Paley1\n\nThe femoral head center (FHC) and the femoral neck center (FNC) were each positioned using 3D data (Fig. 3). The FNC was defined as the center of the femoral neck circumference in the plane separating the femoral head from the rest of the femur (the plane corresponding to the smallest circumference)18. The FHC was defined as the center of a sphere fitted to the femoral head25.\n\nThe femoral condyle center (FCC), tibial medial condyle center (TMCC), tibial lateral condyle center (TLCC), tibial center spine (TCS), and tibial center condyle (TCC) were each defined as the mean of several other landmarks (Table I). Eight additional landmarks along the medial axis of the femur (FA1-FA4) and the tibia (TA1-TA4) were never placed manually, but were defined as the midpoint of the femoral or tibial cross-section in the transverse plane at 15%, 30%, 65%, or 75% of that bone’s length. Bone length was measured from the most proximal point to the most distal point of the bone model. These percentages were empirically found to closely correspond to the landmarks defined by Paley1.\n\nMean Bone Model Construction\n\nFifty manually segmented femora and tibiae were used to construct the mean bone models in 4 steps. First, 1 subject was randomly chosen to serve as the template. Second, the template femur and tibia were remeshed to obtain approximately isotropic meshes with a 1-mm edge length. Third, for all other subjects, the mesh was rigidly registered and scaled using an iterative closest point (ICP)26 algorithm to align it to the template. Fourth, the template was nonrigidly registered to the new subject using an adapted version of the nonrigidICP algorithm26 developed by Audenaert et al.27, which is available online28. After registration, the deformed template was used as a substitute for the original mesh of that patient. The mean coordinates of each vertex in all transformed template meshes then defined the corresponding vertex of the mean femur or mean tibia.\n\nAutomatic Landmarks\n\nAutomatic landmark positioning was performed by fitting the mean bone model to a new patient, using the combined rigid and nonrigid ICP algorithms. The bone models were first split into a proximal part and a distal part along the transverse plane at 50% of the length, to improve registration in case of large deformations. After registration, the vertices of the mean bone model corresponded to the geometry of the bone model of the new subject. For each subject, a mean bone model based on the other 49 subjects was used to avoid bias.\n\nLandmarks were automatically found by averaging the locations of the manual landmarks on the fitted mean bone model. In the cases of the FHC and FNC, the mean of the corresponding vertices was used to construct a new plane, from which the points were calculated as described earlier. For the automatic landmarks of the 20 manually annotated subjects, only the manual landmarks of other subjects were used to avoid bias.\n\nAlignment Parameters\n\nBoth manual and automatic landmarks were used to calculate the angles described by Paley1. Before angle calculation, the legs were first rotated to align the FHC-to-tibial center plafond (TCP) line with the proximal-distal axis and align the femoral medial condyle posterior (FMCP)-to-femoral lateral condyle posterior (FLCP) line with the medial-lateral axis.\n\nTable II shows the angle definitions and their normal range of variation. A visual overview of the angles is shown in Figures 4 and 5. The angles were separated into 3 groups that are reflected by their prefix. Anatomical partial (ap) angles were calculated using the anatomical bone axis close to the joint, anatomical total (at) angles were calculated using the total anatomical bone axis, and mechanical (m) angles were calculated using the mechanical axis.\n\nTABLE II - Definitions of All Angles That Were Used to Describe the Lower-Limb Alignment*\n\nAngle Acronym Definition Plane Normal Range (deg) Line 1 Line 2 Anatomical partial Anterior distal tibial angle apADTA TA4-TA3 TAP-TPP Sagittal 78 to 82 Anterior neck shaft angle apANSA FNC-FHC FA1-FA2 Sagittal 165 to 175 Lateral distal femoral angle apLDFA FA4-FA3 FMC-FLC Coronal 79 to 83 Lateral distal tibial angle apLDTA TA4-TA3 TMP-TLP Coronal 86 to 92 Medial neck-shaft angle apMNSA FA1-FA2 FNC-FHC Coronal 124 to 136 Medial proximal femoral angle apMPFA FA1-FA2 FGT-FHC Coronal 80 to 89 Medial proximal tibial angle apMPTA TA1-TA2 TLCC-TMCC Coronal 85 to 90 Posterior distal femoral angle apPDFA FAP-FPP FA4-FA3 Sagittal 79 to 87 Posterior proximal tibial angle apPPTA TA1-TA2 TAC-TPC Sagittal 77 to 84 Anatomical total Anterior distal tibial angle atADTA TA1-TA4 TAP-TPP Sagittal 78 to 82 Lateral distal femoral angle atLDFA FA4-FA1 FMC-FLC Coronal 79 to 83 Lateral distal tibial angle atLDTA TA4-TA1 TMP-TLP Coronal 86 to 92 Medial neck-shaft angle atMNSA FA1-FA4 FNC-FHC Sagittal 124 to 136 Medial proximal femoral angle atMPFA FA1-FA4 FGT-FHC Coronal 80 to 89 Medial proximal tibial angle atMPTA TA1-TA4 TLCC-TMCC Coronal 85 to 90 Posterior proximal tibial angle atPPTA TA1-TA4 TAC-TPC Sagittal 77 to 84 Mechanical Anterior distal tibial angle mADTA TCCsag-TCPsag TAP-TPP Sagittal 78 to 82 Hip-knee-ankle angle mHKA TCS-TCP TCS-FHC Coronal 176 to 182 Joint line convergence angle mJLCA FMC-FLC TMCC-TLCC Coronal −2 to 2 Lateral distal femoral angle mLDFA FCC-FHC FMC-FLC Coronal 85 to 90 Lateral distal tibial angle mLDTA TCP-TCC TMP-TLP Coronal 86 to 92 Lateral proximal femoral angle mLPFA FHC-FGT FHC-FCC Coronal 85 to 95 Medial proximal tibial angle mMPTA TCC-TCP TLCC-TMCC Coronal 85 to 90 Posterior distal femoral angle mPDFA FAP-FPP FCP-FHC Sagittal 79 to 87 Posterior proximal tibial angle mPPTA TCCsag-TCPsag TAC-TPC Sagittal 77 to 85\n\n*Each angle is defined as the smallest angle between the 2 lines formed by the landmarks shown in Table I. Angles were calculated from a 2D perspective in the coronal, sagittal, or axial plane.\n\nEvaluation\n\nWe performed the first part of the study on 20 subjects using the manual, semi-automatic (semi-auto), and fully automatic (full-auto) workflows to study the impact of the automatic steps on landmark positioning and angle calculation. The manual workflow used manual segmentation and manual landmark positioning. The semi-auto workflow used manual segmentation but automatic landmark positioning. The full-auto workflow used automatic segmentation and landmark positioning. The time needed for each method was measured in minutes.\n\nThe absolute intraobserver differences in landmarks and angles were defined as the differences between the repeated manual measurements. The semi-auto and full-auto differences were compared with the mean of the 2 manual measurements.\n\nThe second part of the study was only performed using the full-auto workflow and compared the parameters of the study population of 50 subjects with the normal variation as summarized in Table II.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the intraobserver difference in each angle was calculated using a 2-way mixed effects, absolute agreement, single-rater model. The semi-auto and full-auto ICCs were calculated using a multiple-measurements model29. The distribution of the differences between the values determined with the full-auto and manual methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. The equivalence of each angle calculated using the full-auto method and the manual method was tested using paired two 1-sided tests (pTOST), which checks whether the mean difference falls within a predefined limit-of-agreement margin. This test used the intraobserver limit of agreement, defined as 1.96 × σintra, where σintra is the average of the standard deviation for each pair of repeated manual measurements. As the pTOST requires independent data, the tests were performed on the left and right legs separately. Measurement of the 25 angles in left and right legs separately resulted in a total of 50 comparisons. With the Bonferroni correction applied, significance was set at p < 0.001.\n\nSource of Funding\n\nThis study was supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO/TTW), grant number 15479.\n\nResults\n\nFifty subjects, 41 male (mean age, 61 years [range, 30 to 76 years]) and 9 female (mean age, 51 years [range, 34 to 76 years]), were included in this study.\n\nValidation\n\nThe differences between the manual and automatic segmentations of the 50 subjects are shown in Table III. Further analysis of the segmentation accuracy can be found in the study by Kuiper et al.21. The operators who performed manual segmentation of the bones reported mean segmentation times of approximately 40 minutes per leg. The mean time (and standard deviation) for manual landmark positioning was 20.3 ± 3.2 minutes per leg. The mean times for the automatic workflow were 10.1 ± 2.2 minutes for segmentation and 2.2 ± 0.2 minutes for landmark positioning.\n\nTABLE III - Similarity Between the Manual and Automatic Segmentations for the Femur and Tibia*\n\nThe mean differences between the repeated manual assessments and between the manual and full-auto methods are illustrated for each landmark on the bone model in Figure 2. Figure 6 shows the corresponding distribution of differences in each landmark for the 3 methods. The mean difference averaged over all landmarks was 2.01 ± 1.64 mm between the repeated assessments with the manual method, 2.12 ± 1.38 mm for the semi-auto method compared with the manual method, and 2.17 ± 1.37 mm for the full-auto method compared with the manual method. The difference between the full-auto and manual methods ranged from 0.36 ± 0.19 mm for the FHC to 3.63 ± 2.21 mm for the femoral greater trochanter (FGT).\n\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of the angular differences for the manual, semi-auto, and full-auto methods. The mean absolute angular difference was 1.05° ± 1.48° between repeated assessments using the manual method, 0.98° ± 1.15° for the semi-auto method compared with the manual method, and 1.10° ± 1.16° for the full-auto method compared with the manual method. The difference for the full-auto method ranged from 0.21° ± 0.15° for the mHKA to 2.75° ± 1.71° for the mechanical posterior distal femoral angle (mPDFA).\n\nReliability Assessment\n\nThe results of the ICC analysis of the angular measurements are shown in Table IV. Both the intraobserver reliability for the manual method and the reliability of the full-auto method compared with the manual method were good to excellent for 23 of the 25 measured angles. However, the Bland-Altman plots in Appendix Figure S.1 expose systematic bias between the full-auto and manual values for the remaining 2 angles, the apPDFA and mPDFA. The mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between these methods for each angle, and corresponding p value calculated using a pTOST test, are summarized in Appendix Supplemental Table 1.\n\nTABLE IV - ICCs for Repeated Measurements Using the Manual Method and for the Semi-Automatic and Fully Automatic Methods Versus the Manual Method*†\n\nPopulation Variation Assessment\n\nTable V shows the alignment parameters of all 50 subjects as calculated using the full-auto method. The mean fell outside of the expected normal range for 7 of the 25 angles1. These were the anatomical partial anterior neck shaft angle (apANSA) and the 3 variations (ap, at, and m) of the anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA) and lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA).\n\nTABLE V - Mean of Each Automatically Calculated Angle Describing Lower-Limb Alignment Across 50 Subjects, Compared with the Normal Range Reported by Paley\n\nAngles Mean*(deg) Normal Range†(deg) Anatomical partial apADTA 85.6 ± 3.09 78 to 82 apANSA 161.6 ± 8.16 165 to 175 apLDFA 80.4 ± 1.60 79 to 83 apLDTA 84.6 ± 3.42 86 to 92 apMNSA 128.6 ± 5.14 124 to 136 apMPFA 83.7 ± 5.46 80 to 89 apMPTA 85.0 ± 2.41 85 to 90 apPDFA 84.7 ± 0.97 79 to 87 apPPTA 82.3 ± 2.04 77 to 84 Anatomical total atADTA 83.6 ± 3.20 78 to 82 atLDFA 80.0 ± 1.84 79 to 83 atLDTA 85.6 ± 3.63 86 to 92 atMNSA 127.5 ± 4.90 124 to 136 atMPFA 82.6 ± 5.40 80 to 89 atMPTA 86.0 ± 2.97 85 to 90 atPPTA 81.8 ± 2.63 77 to 84 Mechanical mADTA 83.5 ± 3.21 78 to 82 mHKA 179.0 ± 2.64 182 to 176 mJLCA 0.28 ± 2.93 −2 to 2 mLDFA 85.7 ± 1.81 85 to 90 mLDTA 85.8 ± 3.50 86 to 92 mLPFA 92.1 ± 5.25 85 to 95 mMPTA 86.2 ± 2.55 85 to 90 mPDFA 80.2 ± 1.49 79 to 87 mPPTA 81.7 ± 2.28 77 to 85\n\n*The values are given as the mean and the standard deviation. Angles outside of the normal range are shown in bold.\n\n†This is the normal range of angles as reported by Paley.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we developed a method that automatically calculated a comprehensive range of measurements that defined lower-limb alignment. By comparing manual and automatic measurements for both landmark placement and angle calculation in 20 subjects, we found that our method achieved results that closely corresponded to those of manual assessment (with differences that were generally comparable with the intraobserver reliability for the manual method). Additionally, the automatic workflow required approximately 12 minutes, compared with approximately 60 minutes for the manual workflow. We applied the automatic method to a data set of 50 subjects and found that the mean of most measurements fell within the expected range.\n\nA benefit of fitting deformable bone models is that adding more landmarks is trivial, as positioning the landmark once is sufficient to find it in all subsequent subjects. This enables inclusion of landmarks without easily discernible morphological features, in contrast to methods that use specific bone morphology features12–16. Further research using the proposed method could focus on defining better 3D measurements to assess the bone morphometry.\n\nThe mean of 20.3 ± 3.2 minutes necessary for manual landmark positioning was similar to the time reported by Fürmetz et al.9 (17.22 ± 4.0 minutes). Additionally, the intraobserver reliability over all angular measurements was similar between our study (mean, 1.05° [range, 0.15° to 4.68°]) and those in the study by Fürmetz et al.9 (mean, 1.26° [range, 0.18° to 4.64°]).\n\nThe mean differences between the full-auto and manual methods were 0.05 mm larger for landmarks and 0.12° larger for angles than the differences between the semi-auto and manual methods, indicating that automatic segmentation had only a small negative impact on the accuracy. The mean differences between the full-auto and manual methods were also only 0.11 mm larger for landmarks and 0.05° larger for angles than the intraobserver differences, showing that the accuracy of the manual and automatic workflows also closely corresponded.\n\nFor most angles, the intraobserver and intermethod ICCs were similar and indicative of good or excellent reliability. Only the apPDFA and mPDFA showed poor or moderate reliability for both repeated manual assessments and the differences between the full-auto and manual methods.\n\nThe Bland-Altman analysis showed that the 95% CIs for the differences between the full-auto and manual methods were similar to the intraobserver limit of agreement. The plots exposed no systematic bias except in the apPDFA and mPDFA, which showed a greater difference between those methods for more extreme angles. A qualitative inspection of these subjects showed that this was caused by a bias in the automatic method toward a more conservative estimate of the angle, by placing the femoral anterior point (FAP) and femoral posterior point (FPP) landmarks at approximately the same height along the distal femur.\n\nThe pTOST analysis showed statistical equivalence between the manually and automatically calculated angles, as the latter were within the intraobserver limit of agreement of the former for all angles except for the anatomical partial medial proximal tibial angle (apMPTA) of the left leg (p = 0.0018). This was slightly higher than the p < 0.001 threshold, which was required due to Bonferroni correction.\n\nAssessing the mean angles on all 50 subjects, we found that the LDTA, ADTA, and ANSA fell outside the expected normal ranges1. This could be due to differences in axial alignment between 2D and 3D scans, which could affect alignment measurements30. It could also be due to a difference in demographic characteristics between the populations in this study and the previous studies, as age, sex, and race and/or ethnicity could influence the mean alignment parameters31–33.\n\nA limitation of the study was that the CT scans were made with the patient in the supine position rather than in a weight-bearing state. Roth et al.11 noted significant differences of 2.1° ± 1.7° and 2.0° ± 1.6° for the mHKA and mechanical joint line convergence angle (mJLCA) between supine and weight-bearing scans. However, only the mHKA and mJLCA were influenced by this effect. Solutions could be to perform a standing CT scan34, use an EOS imaging scanner35, or combine information from standing leg radiographs and CT scans to create a virtual standing CT scan36.\n\nAnother limitation was that the subjects in this study did not have indications of lower-limb malalignment or pathologies such as osteoarthritis, which could influence the accuracy of both manual and automatic measurements. The inclusion of symptomatic patients who had malalignment to study the relationship between the morphometric parameters and clinical measures and the inclusion of cadaveric samples for the direct measurement of these parameters are therefore subjects for further research.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the proposed method closely corresponded to those of manual assessment, based on both segmentation accuracy and landmark and angle calculations. The method performed all steps fully automatically and in considerably less time. It would therefore be a valuable tool for fast and accurate assessment of lower-limb alignment.\n\nAppendix\n\nSupporting material provided by the authors is posted with the online version of this article as a data supplement at jbjs.org (https://links.lww.com/JBJS/H465).\n\nNote: The authors acknowledge the efforts of Dr. Vahid Arbabi for providing us with the manual segmentations of the femora and tibiae of the 50 included subjects.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
