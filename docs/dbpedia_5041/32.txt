The individual alignments of columns (which includes the column labels and all of their data cells) can be modified. We have the option to align text to the left, the center, and the right. In a less explicit manner, we can allow gt to automatically choose the alignment of each column based on the data type (with the auto option).

Details

When you create a gt table object using gt(), automatic alignment of column labels and their data cells is performed. By default, left-alignment is applied to columns of class character, Date, or POSIXct; center-alignment is for columns of class logical, factor, or list; and right-alignment is used for the numeric and integer columns.

Examples

Let's use countrypops to create a small gt table. We can change the alignment of the population column with cols_align(). In this example, the label and body cells of population will be aligned to the left.

countrypops |> dplyr::select(-contains("code")) |> dplyr::filter(country_name == "San Marino") |> dplyr::slice_tail(n = 5) |> gt(rowname_col = "year", groupname_col = "country_name") |> cols_align( align = "left", columns = population )
