        "meta_description": "Background: The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is currently the primary prognostic tool used in patients with infections to predict sepsis and mortality, although its predictive role remains debated. Serum albumin values have been recently found to correlate with the severity of sepsis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of albumin dosage on SOFA score prediction in infected patients. Methods: This prospective single-centre observational study was performed in 2021. We used the net reclassification improvement (NRI) technique to evaluate the additional prognostic value of serum albumin used together with the SOFA score in infected patients. The discriminatory abilities of the SOFA score alone, of albumin levels alone, and of the albumin levels together with (but not incorporated into) the SOFA score was evaluated by comparing the area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: We included 949 patients with an infectious status; 8.9% (84/949) died within 30 days of ED admission. The AUROC for the SOFA score was 0.802 (95% CI: 0.756–0.849) and the albumin level was 0.813 (95% CI: 0.775–0.852). The NRI found that serum albumin improved SOFA score predictions of 30-day mortality by 24.3% (p < 0.001), yielding an AUROC of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.848–0.912; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Using serum albumin values together with the SOFA score can improve prognostic prediction in patients with infections evaluated in the ED.",
