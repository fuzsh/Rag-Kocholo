All discussions related to actor's/actress performance, looks, style and personality can be confined to ATs. Please don't use the AT's as a forum to bash/mock/discuss other celebrities/members/characters, discuss what is happening on the forum or elsewhere on IF or other social networking sites, basically keep it related to what the AT is about.\n\nThe word \"Appreciate\" itself means to have a highly favorable opinion of someone or something. You are supposed to appraise the value of the work of the actors and express them in a positive light.\n\nA thread where all the fans of the Actor/Character/Couple gather to discuss what they liked. In essence, Constructive criticism/Positive Outlook towards Actors/Characters/Jodi must prevail in these threads.\n\nMembers must understand discussions are restricted in ATs.ATs are safe zones for the Actor/Jodi fans to exchange information without being subject to negativity. You have the main forum to present opinions negatively and debate.So Discussion of actors/ characters/ performances and story tracks that do not directly relate to the show or whom the AT is dedicated to should be kept to a minimum, in particular when they imply stating negative opinions.\n\nDo not discuss Niti Taylor/Hina/KSG separately or in any jodis - you can posts updates related to the show or episode only no lengthy discussion\n\nNo swearing at all\n\nDo not discuss couples/fan groups unrelated to the show.\n\na. Chatting: We do allow minimum chatting in ATs, provided it is related to this AT alone. Additionally, Do not spam with just emotions/numbers to increase post count/pages. Do not quote long quotes. Quoted posts should be small.\n\nATs are open for everyone, however, do not invade the AT with the purpose to rile up the fans or instigate them. Everyone has their right to voice out their opinions and should NOT be judged/generalized based on their likes/dislikes.\n\nIf any of your fellow members/friends fails to follow the rules, kindly ask them to edit out or tell them its wrong rather than joining them and aggravate the issues further and equally responsible for carrying forward an unfavorable situation. Hence be responsible and take responsibility because that way you may prevent action taken against your AT thread.\n\nATs/discussions threads can NOT be used to target other members and NO pinpointing activity/mock or taking digs here toward other fan groups. Any derogatory references or name callings against actors /characters/AT admin/members/Dev team members are strictly PROHIBITED here.\n\nb. Report: If you see anyone breaching the rules in any of the threads in the main forum, you will not come here and rant it out about it and snowball the issue further! Instead, make use of the \"REPORT\" button and report the thread by stating the reason clearly. As soon as the Dev Team comes online they would take the necessary action.\n\nWe can assure you guys that we only take action where it's a legit reason.\n\nBashing of other Jodi/Actors/Characters in ATs is NOT permitted at all. If members of an AT are caught discussing other actors/couples negatively, then AT will be held liable for it and may be subject to warnings & eventual closure/Ban\n\nc.Mythological references: Strictly refrain from using mythological references/names to any of the characters in the show, Calling any character as \"Ram/Sita/Ravan\" to mock/discuss, other characters, directly or indirectly, in the ATs or elsewhere in the forum will NOT be tolerated . Please do not use mythology to defend any character .\n\nHaving said that members must strictly refrain from any sort of name calling characters in the forum, which are used to mock and provoke other fandoms. Please remember, if you name call a character, your favorite will also be name called , which you will not like, so to keep it simple, please confine to the names used in the show.\n\nd.Name calling: of other fandoms/members will not be tolerated on any level and members involving in such will be dealt with severity\n\nWhile criticizing something, there are times when members tend to go overboard and use certain derogatory and downright offensive words which shouldn't be used for any celebrity/member/DT member. Please remember that any derogatory references, comparing celebrity/member to animal or name calling any person [celebrity/member/DT member] is against forum rules, and strict action will be taken against those who indulge in it. Name calling is allowed only and only if it is used to describe a character or his/her behavior. Also, names used in the show can also be used given it is used in context of the show or particular scene it was used for and not otherwise to take dig/mock the character. Any abusive names are not allowed and will be edited or removed at the DT's discretion.\n\nPlease avoid name-calling of any Characters, Members, DTs, CVs or Actors. Here is the modified list of names which are used to mock generally in the forum. We will keep updating it. It doesn’t mean that you can use any mock names which aren’t in the thread, it’s just to clear things for members.\n\nMata for Ekta Kapoor\n\nHaddipie or similar derogatory term for AnuPre's Kid\n\nGober\n\nDoormat\n\nBuzurg\n\nShawlmate/Chawlmate\n\nNanny for Prerna\n\nTRP Aunties\n\nPolyester Pajama\n\nFlopre\n\nDumb\n\nWeirdo\n\nNote : 06-03-2020\n\nWe had restricted the use of dumb and weird for character earlier. Some members had PMed us and we realised we have not explained it completely and it restricted character criticism. It is okay to use dumb/weird to describe something characters did.\n\nWhen you are calling a character dumb, kindly justify why do you think his/her actions are dumb/weird/idiotic. Don't just use it to mock characters or instigate fights.\n\nFor example : it was so dumb of xyz to do something.\n\nthis is also allowed xyz seems dumb because...\n\nxyz is a dimwit because\n\nxyz's actions seemed idiotic\n\nWhat is not allowed :\n\nCalling other characters dumb/weird/dimwit in ATs for other couple.\n\nCalling any member/creative/actor/DT as dumb/weird\n\nPlease dont use these on kids.\n\nRefer to rules at Rules and explanations. ||06/03|| and KZK Rules and Regulations as on 29.01.20. *IMPORTANT*\n\nIf the DT sees more than 3 people breaking the AT rules constantly for a week, the effects of violations will kick start, which go as follows:\n\nFirst Violation - Warning Note\n\nSecond - Another Warning Note\n\nThird - Another Warning Note\n\nFourth - Close the AT for 24 hrs (1 Day)\n\nFifth - Close AT for 72 hrs (3 Days)\n\nSixth - Close AT for 1 week (7 Days)\n\nSeventh - Get rid of AT completely from the forum/Shift it to Celebrity Fan Club Forum.\n\nThe rules are applicable for multiple violation and not a single post as it will be dealt with individually!\n\nDT will go through the reports and only if we find the report valid based on the above rules, then we will speak to the Admins of the AT and action will be taken accordingly as stated above.\n\n･ ･ﾟ*｡★･\n\n･ *ﾟ｡ * ･ ﾟ*｡･ﾟ★｡\n\n☆ﾟ. ﾟ* ﾟ｡·*･｡ ﾟ* *\n\n☆ ｡.｡ * *\n\n｡ ･ ﾟ ｡\n\n- It is okay to discuss either of the actors to a certain point.

Constant criticism will not be tolerated since its an appreciation thread.\n\n- Name-calling is strictly prohibited. Usage of Mythological names/animals/derogatory names will strictly face consequences.\n\n- Do not report one post more than one time.\n\n- DT decides what action to take and when to take until then don’t indulge yourself into fights inside or outside AT.

However, here is a little catch for the stalkers who just want to report in order to get the AT closed down\n\n- If you report any post/comments that have no legit reason, you will be reliable for action against you for stalking.\n\n- DTs will be constantly monitoring all ATs of this forum for some time. They will also be alternating amongst themselves, which will be informed to AT Admins from time to time. Please note that your first point of contact will always be AT Admins and AT Admins will have direction from DTs. So if they inform you something there are chances that they are being directed by the DTs. However, if you have any issues regarding that PM the designated DT of the AT instead of indulging yourself in any fight with the Admin.\n\n- You are not allowed to bring other post issues in the AT. If we close a particular post you are not allowed talking about it in the AT. And it goes the other way as well if DT note is posted in the AT it should not be discussed or talked in any other thread. If found we will increase the WL without warning.\n\n- Limited chitchats are allowed in the AT. Further, if you wish to continue you can use Chat Club for that. Chatting just to increase AT pages will not be entertained and will be trashed or shifted to chat thread without notice. So don’t be surprised to find your posts elsewhere.\n\nRefer here Appreciation Thread Rules as on 29.01.2020"
