        "text": "This is my first time reading children’s literature classic The Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. I have, of course, seen the 1939 film starring Judy Garland, so was familiar with the story. As part of my 2024 reading challenge, I’m attempting to read the ten Puffin classic children’s books from the box set I gifted my sons.\n\nOpening sentence: Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife.\n\n‘We’re off to see the Wizard!’\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is my February and therefore second read from the box set (my plan is to read one a month until I run out).\n\nQuick story recap: Dorothy Gale finds herself whisked to the magical land of Oz during a hurricane, killing the Wicked Witch of the West in the process. She’s then on a mission to find her way home. To do that she must visit the great and powerful wizard, Oz in the Emerald Kingdom – he’s the only one who can grant her wish. On her way she makes friends with a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman and a Lion and they have many adventures before making it to the Emerald Kingdom.\n\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\n\nThere are some elements in the story that don’t appear in the film – the land of delicate china, for example – so it was nice to read about those along with all the classics such as the munchkins, yellow brick road and flying monkeys…\n\nSlight segue here but the surprising thing for me about The Wizard of Oz was that it gave context and sympathy to the flying monkeys. These characters literally terrified me as a child, although more from their portrayal in the 1985 film Return to Oz, which abandoned the childhood-magic of the original in favour of film-making guaranteed to leave children traumatised. (Between the flying monkeys, wheelers and the queen with her many heads, nightmares were had.)\n\nMorals at its core\n\nBut back to the original material – The Wizard of Oz tells a wonderful moral story about self-worth, friendship, trust and not believing everything you see. I think a strong moral message is such a positive in a children’s read, so big tick here.\n\n‘I shall take the heart,‘ returned the Tin Woodman, ‘for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.‘\n\nOverall, I enjoyed The Wizard of Oz. I found it quite simplistic in its writing style, so it would be good for young readers. Due to this, it does lack a little sophistication in the adult reading experience compared to my January Puffin classics challenge read, Peter Pan, for example, which, although I didn’t love it, works a little harder with its delivery.\n\nWould I read it to/with my boys? Yes, it’s a fantastical romp with a strong moral message and lighthearted feel."
