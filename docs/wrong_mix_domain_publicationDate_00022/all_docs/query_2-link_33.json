        "text": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by author L. Frank Baum. It is the first novel in the Oz series of books. A Kansas farm girl named Dorothy ends up in the magical Land of Oz after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their home by a tornado. Upon her arrival in Oz, she learns she cannot return home until she has destroyed the Wicked Witch of the West. The book was first published in the United States in May 1900. In January 1901, the publishing company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000 copies, which quickly sold out. It had sold three million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956. As the artists of Anderson Design Group, we enjoy using our talents to celebrate culture and encourage adventure into the great literary classics of humankind’s best writers and authors. While our Travel Poster Art commemorates special destinations, our Literary Classics Art celebrates our favorite imaginary journeys. This classic design and art deco illustration, fashioned after vintage poster art, is available as a canvas, a framed art piece, poster, print, metal sign, or even as a postcard or set of notecards. For the ultimate reader’s guide to the great literary classics, check out the website for the Tea and Ink Society."
