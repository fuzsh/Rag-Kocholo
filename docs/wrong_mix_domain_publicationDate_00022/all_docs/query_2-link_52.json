        "text": "The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz\n\nAuthor: L. Frank Baum\n\nGenre: Children's Books / Fiction and Literature\n\nLanguage: English\n\nDescription:\n\nOne of the true classics of American literature, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has stirred the imagination of young and old alike for over four generations.\n\nOriginally published in 1900, it was the first truly American fairy tale, as Baum crafted a wonderful fantasy out of such familiar items as a cornfield scarecrow, a mechanical woodman, and a humbug wizard who used old–fashioned hokum to express that universal theme, \"There's no place like home.\"\n\nFollow the adventures of young Dorothy Gale and her dog, Toto, as their Kansas house is swept away by a cyclone and they find themselves in a strange land called Oz. Here she meets the Munchkins and joins the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion on an unforgettable journey to the Emerald City, where lives the all–powerful Wizard of Oz.\n\nIn The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum developed his vision of a socialist paradise, it is the original book that started the wonderful series (that includes 14 books) and inspired the famous movie."
