In this new rendition of Baum's familiar story, the wisdom and truths in Shakespeare's plays have been overlaid onto the tale of Dorothy's adventure in the Land of Oz. Baum's aim was not to lecture or impart a particular moral, but to entertain and amuse. Yet The Wonderful Wizard of Oz does more, and O Wonderful, Wonderful Wizard of Oz does more as well. It demonstrates the intrinsic value of the foundational virtue of kindness and introduces young readers to hundreds of Shakespeare's most famous lines, truths, and bits of wisdom as Dorothy travels along the yellow brick road. Hopefully, readers of all ages will come to the end of the beautifully illustrated O Wonderful, Wonderful Wizard of Oz and think, \"Shakespeare is fun!\" and so anticipate their next encounter of the Bard of Avon with eagerness and positivity. Perhaps, as well, readers will reflect on how Dorothy changed lives, and even Oz itself, by her choice to be kind to those she meets who are hurting or alone, and to offer them what help she can, with no thought of what she might receive in return. For kindness stands in stark contrast to rudeness or indifference. It has the power to connect us and surprise us, and to inspire friendship, loyalty, gratitude, hope, and even love to make our lives a little happier and a little easier.
