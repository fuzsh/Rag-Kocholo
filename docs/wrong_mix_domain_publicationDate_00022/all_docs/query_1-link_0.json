        "text": "British writer and editor (1874–1965)\n\n\"Sydney Wright\" redirects here. For the Australian footballer, see Syd Wright.\n\nSydney Fowler Wright (6 January 1874 – 25 February 1965) was a British editor, poet, science fiction author, writer of screenplays, mystery fiction and works in other genres, as well as being an accountant and a conservative political activist.[1] He also wrote as Sydney Fowler and Anthony Wingrave.\n\nWright was born in Holly Street, Smethwick (then in the Kings Norton registration district), England on 6 January 1874.[2][3][4] Wright left school at eleven, and spent his adolescence studying literature when not working.[5] From a young age, Wright deliberately adopted a healthy lifestyle; he did not smoke or eat meat, and rarely drank alcohol. Wright also took regular exercise by hiking or cycling in the countryside.[5]\n\nHe was married twice. His first wife was Nellie (Julia Ellen) Ashbarry, whom he married in 1895. After Nellie's death in 1918, Wright married Truda (Anastasia Gertruda) Hancock in 1920. Wright had ten children.[5][6]\n\nIn 1917, Wright helped found the Empire Poetry League and edited the League's journal, Poetry. Wright used Poetry to publish his translations of Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio.[5]\n\nWright began writing science fiction in the 1920s. The book Science-Fiction: The Early Years describes Wright as \"the major British writer of genre science fiction between Wells and the moderns\".[1] His first science fiction novel was The Amphibians (1924), set in a future where humanity has been succeeded by the titular beings.[5] His 1928 novel Deluge, about a flood which devastates Britain, was a success and was later adapted into a Hollywood film of the same title.[7] The Island of Captain Sparrow (1928) was inspired by H. G. Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau. Wright's novel features a race of satyr-like beast men persecuted by humans.[5]\n\nWright was critical of modern industrial civilization, and his 1932 collection The New Gods Lead contained several stories attacking trends Wright disagreed with, including birth control and the motor car (The \"New Gods\" of the book's title were described by Wright as Comfort and Cowardice).[5][8] The New Gods Lead includes several stories of note, including \"The Rat\", about a doctor who discovers an immortality serum, and \"P.N. 40\", which is set in a repressive future controlled by supporters of the eugenics movement.[5] \"The Choice:An Allegory of Blood and Tears\" is a satire on the Christian conception of Heaven.[5]\n\nIn 1934, Wright visited Nazi Germany to write a series of newspaper articles. Alarmed at what he saw, he wrote three novels about a future war in Europe: Prelude in Prague: The War of 1938, Four Days' War, and Mediggo's Ridge.[5]\n\nThe Amphibians (1924)\n\nThe World Below (1929) [sequel to The Amphibians]\n\nDeluge (1928)\n\nDawn (1929) [parallel and sequel to Deluge]\n\nDream, or the Simian Maid (1931) [first novel in the Marguerite Cranleigh Series]\n\nThe Vengeance of Gwa (1935) [second novel in the Marguerite Cranleigh Series]\n\nSpiders' War (1954) [third novel in the Marguerite Cranleigh Series]\n\nPrelude in Prague: The War of 1938 (1934)\n\nFour Days War (1936) [sequel to Prelude in Prague]\n\nMegiddo's Ridge (1937) [sequel to Four Days War]\n\nThe Island of Captain Sparrow (1928)\n\nBeyond the Rim (1932)\n\nPower (1933)\n\nThe Screaming Lake (1937)\n\nThe Hidden Tribe (1938)\n\nThe Adventure of Wyndham Smith (1938)\n\nThe Adventure of the Blue Room (as Sydney Fowler) (1945)\n\nElfwin (1930) (Novel about Ethelfleda of Mercia)[9]\n\nLord's Right in Languedoc (1933)\n\nDavid (1934)\n\nLast Days of Pompeii (1948) (Redaction of Lord Lytton's novel by S.F.W.).\n\nMarguerite de Valois (1946) (Translation of Alexander Dumas père novel).\n\nThe Siege of Malta, Part One: St Elmo (1942)\n\nThe Siege of Malta, Part Two: St Angelo (1942) (Completion of Walter Scott's unfinished novel)[10]\n\nThe King against Anne Bickerton (1930, vts REX v Anne Bickerton and The Case of Anne Bickerton)\n\nBy Saturday (1931)\n\nThe Bell Street Murders (1931)\n\nCrime & co.
