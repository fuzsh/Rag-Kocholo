        "text": "Ged was the greatest sorcerer in Earthsea, but in his youth he was the reckless Sparrowhawk. In his hunger for power and knowledge, he tampered with long-held secrets and loosed a terrible shadow upon the world. This is the tumultuous tale of his testing, how he mastered the mighty words of power, tamed an ancient dragon, and crossed death's threshold to restore the balance.\n\nWinner of the 1969 Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for Fiction\n\nWinner of the 1979 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award\n\nOne of TIME’s 100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time\n\nOriginally published in 1968 by Parnassus Press, Ursula K. Le Guin’s A Wizard of Earthsea is the first of the six beloved Earthsea titles. It is currently available from Clarion Books.\n\nPraise\n\n\"The magic of Earthsea is primal; the lessons of Earthsea remain as potent, as wise, and as necessary as anyone could dream.\"\n\n—Neil Gaiman\n\n“It is wholly original, but it has the conviction of a tale told by a writer whose roots are deep in great literature of many kinds, including traditional lore and fantasy. She is at home in the ancient world of rites and runes and ‘true names,’ the knowledge of which gives supernatural power; of mage, wizard, and sorcerer, of feats of illusion and spells of changing. Her way with words results in prose beautiful to read and to listen to. .... Unusual allegory or exciting quest, it is an unforgettable and a distinguished book.”\n\n—Ruth Hill Viguers, The Horn Book\n\n“A Wizard of Earthsea is one of the most beautifully written books in the English language. It’s also one of the very few fantasy novels that succeeds in feeling like a legend.”\n\n—Jo Walton, Tor.com\n\n“Le Guin would go on to win the Hugo, Nebula, Locus and World Fantasy awards (each more than once) later in her career, but it was the seminal book A Wizard of Earthsea that broke down barriers and provided a blueprint for countless beloved fantasy properties to come.\"\n\n—Megan McCluskey, TIME"
