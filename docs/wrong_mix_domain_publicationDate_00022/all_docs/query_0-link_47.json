        "text": "I heard of this concept awhile ago - read one million pages in your lifetime. It sounded doable, but then I did some math. If I read 40,000 pages a year, it will take me 25 years to read 1,000,000 pages! It sounds a bit overwhelming. Oh, well. I'm going to go for it anyway!\n\nI joined the Goodreads group for this, and then started searching for a picture to display along with my page count. I couldn't find one in the blogosphere, so I created my own!\n\nIf anyone else wants to join me in the quest, feel free to sign up with the Linky below. I'd love some company!\n\nAnd if you do decide to join me, here's the button I made. Copy and paste the hyperlink below to use it on your blog.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smilingshelves.com/1/post/2013/11/read-one-million-pages-challenge.html\"><img src=\"http://www.smilingshelves.com/uploads/8/3/4/5/8345014/8556634.png?264\"/></a>\n\nThis weekly meme is hosted by Sheila at Book Journey.\n\nWinter has arrived! While there still isn't much snow to speak of, the temperature is struggling to climb above 25 degrees. Looks like it may be a white Thanksgiving on Thursday!\n\nMy Recent Posts\n\nReviewlets - One for the Books by Joe Queenan & Sixpence House by Paul Collins\n\nFollowing the Sun by John Hanson Mitchell - Review\n\nBooks About Books Challenge - Complete! (Reading challenge #2 finished!)\n\nWhat I Read Last Week\n\nThe Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein (Has anyone else read this one? What was your opinion of having a dog as the narrator? I'm curious what others thought.)\n\nThe Year of Living Biblically by A.J. Jacobs\n\nWhat I'm Reading Now\n\nThe Laird's Inheritance by George MacDonald (This has been on my TBR pile for a long time. It's taking awhile to get into it, but I'm interested enough to stick with it.)\n\nWhat's Coming Up Next\n\nLike any bibliophile, I love reading books about books. This challenge was right up my alley! When I joined it, I had already reached the second level of Short Story, which was to read 6-10 books. So I decided to aim for the next highest - Novella (11-15 books). And I just made it! Here are the eleven books I read for this challenge:\n\nThe Reading Group by Elizabeth Noble\n\nBook Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade by Marvin Mondlin\n\nReading Like a Writer by Francine Prose\n\nThe Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things by Paula Byrne\n\nMr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan\n\nThe Cherry Cola Book Club by Ashton Lee\n\nEx Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader by Anne Fadiman\n\nEscape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library by Chris Grabenstein\n\nOne for the Books by Joe Queenan\n\nThe Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession by Allison Hoover Bartlett\n\nSixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books by Paul Collins\n\nI would love to read many more, but I'm running out of time in the year, and I have other challenges to finish up. I'm sure there will be more books about books in my future once 2014 hits!\n\nFollowing the Sun is the story of John Hanson Mitchell’s journey from Spain to Scotland. On a bicycle. He begins in Spain on the vernal equinox and ends in Callanish on the summer solstice. Along the way, he encounters many interesting characters and stories – and a lot of flat tires.\n\nMitchell tells the story of his bicycle journey in a laidback fashion. Even when he’s battling against wind and rain, it doesn’t seem to faze him much. His descriptions of some of his meals made my mouth water. And who wouldn’t want to travel around to little villages all over Europe, staying in bed & breakfasts (a.k.a., a very nice person’s spare bedroom), and sampling local delicacies at the town café (or pub)?\n\nThis was also an educational book. Mitchell is a lover of the sun and sun lore. He intersperses stories from his journey with stories from world cultures. He covers everything from mythology to the development of the heliocentric view of our solar system. Most of this was interesting. Some of it I could have lived without (there’s a lot of sacrificing to the sun god in world history). And as a Christian, I didn’t really appreciate him lumping Biblical events in with world myths and trying to explain how these stories evolved over the past five million years.\n\nA minor pet peeve – his writing style really bugged me at the beginning. He is a great user of run-on sentences. For example: “They wore wide-brimmed straw hats held in place with white bandannas tied beneath their chins, and they all had round, nut-brown faces, with rosy cheeks and white teeth, and many of them wore full-cut blue or brown skirts and heavy shoes.” Seriously? Why isn’t that three separate sentences? After awhile, though, he either stopped writing like this or I stopped noticing, because eventually it no longer annoyed me.\n\nAs an armchair traveller, I like being able to learn as I read. But in my opinion, this book could have used more travel narrative and less history lesson, especially since his worldview didn’t agree with mine. I picked it up because the idea of riding a bicycle from Spain to Scotland intrigued me. That’s the story I was hoping to read. It was in there, but there was a lot of other stuff that got in the way.\n\nThis is a book about books. Queenan wrote eight essays, covering everything from public libraries to keeping books you know you will never read. It’s usually fun to hear another bibliophile’s take on these topics. Queenan is a witty writer, but he’s also, well, snarky (in the words of his local librarian). He’s been a voracious reader since his youth, reading mostly classic literature and nonfiction on obscure topics. And somehow those reading choices make him a better person – or at least, reader – than I am. Or you are. He comes across as a bit of a reading snob, even looking down his nose at classics like To Kill a Mockingbird. I enjoy reading about others’ reading tastes, but not if it makes me feel like less of a person because I read fiction books that people have actually heard of. I enjoyed Queenan’s take on some bookish things, but I would have been just fine without having ever read this book.\n\nPaul Collins has fallen in love with the town of Hay-on-Wye in Wales. Who wouldn't? It's a town with 1,400 residents and 30 bookstores. Every book lovers' heaven! Collins loves it so much, however, that he decided to move there - taking along his wife, young son, and many, many boxes of books. And we get to embark on his adventure along with him. Sixpence House follows him in and out of the bookstores and unstable piles of books. It chronicles his family's search for the perfect house in Hay-on-Wye (\"perfect\" being defined as level-ish floors and not too much mold). It introduces us to some of the residents of the town. Bibliophiles galore! Collins also intersperses amusing quotes from obscure books that he has read. These were some of my favorite parts, since I know I would never have come across these quotes in any other way. Collins writes with wit and humor. His adventure in this bookish town in Wales is well worth your time. You will most certainly add Hay-on-Wye to your list of places to go someday, just as I have!\n\nVoice\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThis weekly meme is hosted by Sheila at Book Journey.\n\nI made it through my stack of library books just in time to return them on Wednesday. Now I'm onto the books that I own - I'm racing to finish up the Mount TBR Challenge before the end of the year!\n\nMy Recent Posts\n\nWhat I Read Last Week\n\nThe Masque of the Black Tulip by Lauren Willig (I won't include the list of things I didn't do because I wanted to finish this book!)\n\nGatsby's Girl by Caroline Preston\n\nGone: The Last Days of The New Yorker by Renata Adler\n\nWhat I'm Reading Now\n\nWhat's Coming Up Next\n\nThe Year of Living Biblically by A.J. Jacobs (And then I'll be done with my A-Z Reading Challenge!)\n\nI love books. And I love owning books. And I most certainly love old books – the smell, the look of them lined up on my mahogany bookshelves. But as much as I admire the look and the smell, I also have every intention of reading them someday. Unlike most of the people in The Man Who Loved Books Too Much.\n\nThe person referenced by the title is a book thief with a penchant for rare books. He steals credit card numbers and then orders rare books with them. It’s a scam that worked amazingly – and scarily – well. He “acquired” hundreds of books, but not for the pleasure of reading them. Simply for the pleasure of owning them, accompanied by the impressed opinion that others would have of him upon seeing his taste in books. As beautiful as old books are, that’s the one thing I don’t understand about those who collect rare books. Why would you own hundreds or thousands of books with no intention of reading them?\n\nAllison Hoover Bartlett does a great job of introducing us to the world of rare books. She traces the parallel journeys of John Gilkey, the book thief, and those bookstore owners who are desperately trying to catch him. She explores the reasons behind collecting rare books – both legal and illegal. And she finds herself being drawn into the realm of rare book collecting.\n\nThe Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a fascinating look at rare books and the people that love them to the point of obsession."
