        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\n“The Castle of Terror” was first published in Conan of Cimmeria, Lancer Books, 1969. It is a rather generic story so here is a rather generic scan to represent it.\n\n“The Castle of Terror” was adapted to comics in Marvel’s Conan the Barbarian #105.\n\nRoy Thomas, in Barbarian Life Volume 3, Pulp Hero Press, 2021, says, “It’s a very minor story, even by de Camp/Carter standards, and serves mainly to chronicle Conan’s divorce from the Bamulas.” Later Roy says that artist John Buscema was “as uninspired by this phase of Conan’s career as I was.” I’m in agreement. I’m also glad “The Vale of the Lost Women” was the only story where Conan led the Bamulas.\n\nRobert M. Price, in Lin Carter: A Look Behind His Imaginary Worlds, Starmont House, 1991 talks about this story, “… the description of the steppes recalls that in de Camp’s The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate, the castle and its dead zone of parched grass is right out of Carter’s “The Keeper of the Emerald Flame.” And I think we see Carter’s hand, not de Camp’s, in the use of Lovecraftian oddly-angled masonry and the mention of King Kull and the Serpent-Men of Valusia.”.\n\n“The Castle of Terror” is the seventh story in Conan of Cimmeria. It follows “The Vale of Lost Women.”\n\nI don’t know whether it was chance or fate or strategic planning but this story is lucky to have followed “The Vale of Lost Women.” Of course de Camp and Carter planned it to follow the events from “Vale” and tossed in some narration to cover that but the basic plot of Conan being chased by lions and finding refuge in a haunted castle could have occurred anywhere in the series. By immediately following one of REH’s weakest stories “Castle” doesn’t seem all that bad.\n\nIt really isn’t all that bad but it has a hackneyed title and plot. Conan really only gets to show his stuff in a sword fight at the end of the story.\n\nConan is described as a “young giant, strongly built. With gliding thews that swelled under a sun-burned hide scored with the white traces of old wounds. Deep of chest and broad of shoulder and long of limb was he; his scanty costume of loincloth and sandals revealed his magnificent physique.”\n\nConan is being tracked by lions. In the first story in the Lancer series, “The Thing in the Crypt,” Conan was being chased by wolves. I wish it had been bears so I could write a story with Conan being chased by tigers; to complete the trilogy. Lions, tigers, and bears! Oh my!\n\nWe all know Conan has said it is useless to pray to Crom. But the narration states, “He prayed to his savage gods for the moon to emerge from the dense, stormy clouds that veiled most of the sky. He prayed for a hillock or a tree to break the gently rolling flatness of the plain, or even a boulder against which he could set his back to make a last stand against the pride.” Being chased by lions seems to meet that “there are no atheists in foxholes” exception. (If you’re too pacifist to relate to foxholes then think about your “check engine” light coming on while miles from home.) In any case, as Conan has said before, Crom doesn’t help, his prayers (he should have known better) just lead him to another doom.\n\nConan finds refuge in a castle that the lions avoid. The castle or fortress has a Lovecraftian architecture. “The eye followed mind-twisting curves that seemed subtly wrong, weirdly distorted. The huge structure gave the impression of a chaotic lack of order, as if its builders had not been quite sane.”\n\nConan thinks the place gives off a snaky vibe and remembers his Valusian history lessons. “Conan had heard the legend of Kull, the Atlantean King …”\n\nConan goes to sleep and his dreams tell him about the castle’s ghostly residents pretty much the same way things were explained to him, while unconscious, in “Queen of the Black Coast.” Thunder wakes Conan and he notices that some Stygian slavers have also come into the castle. The amorphous monster formed by the castle’s ghostly residents attack the slavers (a bigger meal) and Conan escapes. One of the Stygian slavers avoided the monster’s clutches but has went crazy from the weirdness and gives Conan a pretty good sword fight.\n\nConan prevails and then takes the man’s armor and horse to head toward new adventures.\n\nOnce the story gets going it is entertaining. Reusing elements from “The Thing in the Crypt” and “Queen of the Black Coast” was lazy though. It makes the reader realize the story is pure filler. A kinder interpretation is imagining it as one of those vignettes that start James Bond movies. Immediate action with immediate results. A sort of prelude to more involved stories.\n\nDe Camp Including his (and Carter and Nyberg’s) stories into the Conan series bothers some but it was a wildly popular idea at the time. Robert M. Price, in the same paragraph quoted above correctly says, “De Camp’s passion was to knit the Conan stories into an integrated “saga” …”\n\nBelieve it or not, for me anyway, that was the appeal of the series. And the unevenness of the stories gave me things to think about. I actually did charts keeping track of the gods, monsters, and countries Conan visited. I did charts ranking the stories! This was before floppy disks and hard drives. Those badly typed, eventually wrinkled, and scribbled up sheets of paper, that 13 year old me created, are long gone. These blogposts 50 years later are my new scribblings.\n\nIt’s still fun."
