        "text": "9/10\n\nAmongst the most-read and most-influential children's books of all time.\n\nDorothy Gale and her little dog Toto are in for the ride of their lives when a tornado drops them off in the Land of Oz. Can Dorothy and her new friends survive the perils of Oz to reach the Wizard and find a way home?\n\nDorothy, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man. Few are unable to immediately identify these names, so ingrained are they in the minds of children, parents and grandparents around the world. This modernised fairy tale is heavily influenced by the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen but with the author removing the heartache and nightmares, as he explains before the story begins:\n\n\"Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvellous and manifestly unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\n\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as \"historical\" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\n\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\"\n\nL. Frank Baum, April, 1900\n\nThere are very few fantasy authors today who are not influenced by The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Its strongest theme is self-contradiction and how the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion all lack self-confidence. The Scarecrow believes that he has no brains, though he comes up with clever solutions to several problems that they encounter on their journey. The Tin Woodman believes that he lacks a heart, but is moved to tears when misfortune befalls the various creatures they meet. The Cowardly Lion believes that he has no courage even though he is consistently brave through their journey.\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz is as much loved today as it has ever been and the advent of the ebook has led to the book being free to those who able to read them. First published in 1900 when it became an international bestseller it is a relevant today as it was then.\n\nAmongst the most-read and most-influential children's books of all time. And you can read it for free."
