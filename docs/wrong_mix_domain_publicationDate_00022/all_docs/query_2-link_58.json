        "text": "L. Frank Baum’s novel The Wizard of Oz had by 2005 spawned 39 official sequels, more than 100 unofficial sequels, nearly 40 films, several television series, music videos, commercials, computer games, radio shows and more. It has received a number of different interpretations: an African-American slant, a Turkish low-budget fantasy, Japanese anime, and American pornography, among others.\n\nThis book provides synopses and basic bibliographical information for the forty Oz books in the original series and a number of related books by the Royal Historians of Oz; synopses and credits for live performances (videos and made-for-television performances are included here) based on the Oz books and on Baum’s non–Oz fantasies; comic book and comic strip adaptations of Oz; synopses and credits for radio shows and dramatic performances on audiobook or vinyl records; synopses and credits for theatrical films and shorts; documentaries and educational films; synopses and credits for television series and episodes based on Oz; video and computer games; useful websites; and short scenes on television or in movies that have an Oz element.\n\nAcknowledgments vii\n\nPreface 1\n\nIntroduction 3\n\n1.
