        "text": "Geographic, historical and political context of the study\n\nThe republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina forms a triangle with an extension of 51,129 km2 located in the western Balkan Peninsula. Bordered to the north, west and south by Croatia (border length 932 km), to the east by Serbia (302 km), and to the south by Montenegro (225 km), Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost landlocked, except for the short Adriatic coastline of about 26 km near the town of Neum in the outermost south-west.\n\nThe country of Bosnia and Herzegovina is dominated by mountains and hills covering approximately 66% of the total area. Nature is highly diverse as demonstrated by the occurrence of 3,572 different vascular plant species, 3,000 species of algae, and 3,000–5,000 fungi and lichen species. Considering the relative small size of the country, these numbers make Bosnia and Herzegovina one of the five richest countries in Europe in terms of species diversity [6].\n\nThe eventful history of Bosnia and Herzegovina exposed the country to numerous cultural influences by different nations, starting with the Illyrians and Romans, followed by the Slavs and finally the Ottomans who occupied this territory in 1463 and made it part of their Empire for the following four centuries [7]. In 1878 the Congress of Berlin put the Ottoman provinces Bosnia and Herzegovina under the rule of Austria-Hungary It were the Austrian public officers who eventually coined the compound name Bosnia-Herzegovina, which remained the name of the country till today [8]. Following World War I Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the South Slav Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (soon renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The history and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as member of socialistic Yugoslavia after World War II and until 1992 was then closely bound to the politics of this federal republic under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito [8]. In the early 90ies a war with Serbia shaked Bosnia and Herzegovina killing more than 200,000 people. In 1995, according to Dayton’s peace agreement, two separate governing entities were established, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, but still joined under one roof, the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina [8].\n\nAccording to a census, in 1991 Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,033 composed of the following ethnical groups: 1,902,956 (43%) Bosniaks, 1,366,104 (31%) Serbs, 760,852 (17%) Croats, and 242,682 (6%) Yugoslavs. The remaining 3% of the population – numbering approximately 104,439 people – consisted of various other ethnicities [9]. According to unofficial data of 2,000, Bosnia's largest ethnic groups are the Bosniaks (48%), Serbs (37%) and Croats (14%) [10].\n\nPractices and values of traditional medicine in the Village of Prokoško Lake\n\nThe healers usually worked as a team, they conferred with each other and worked jointly. They also specialised on particular aspects and activities. Some were responsible for consulting the patients (usually six older ladies), others for preparing needed medicines (4 younger ladies) and some were experts in collecting plants (2 older man). The healers unified the abilities of a doctor, pharmacist and botanist.\n\nInstead of written prescriptions, patients either got preparations ready to use like macerates, tinctures, sirups, balms from the doctors or – if requested – received a single plant or mixture along with an orally delivered instruction providing details on the preparation procedure and the proper application of drugs. Most of the preparations had to be made freshly as they otherwise would spoil soon – especially in summer – outside of a refrigerator which is not available without electricity. Only time-consuming and stable preparations like macerates or tinctures were prepared in larger amounts and stored in dark rooms. Many patients, therefore, had to wait for their medicines to be finished and often stayed over night in cottages reserved for tourists and guests. One night in such a cottage costs approximately moderate 2,50 € per person. The healers themselves had separate cottages, but consulting and preparation of medicines took place in one particular house with two separate rooms and slightly bigger than the other cottages. In the bigger room the healers consulted the patients and – in a compartment separated by a canvas – made the preparations. The second, smaller room served as storage for preparations and other products like self-made honey as well as for the purpose to dry plants.\n\nQuite interesting appeared the way of payment, as healers didn’t charge fixed prices for their efforts, but left this decision with the patients. The system built on mutual trust and honesty. It relied on the judgment and satisfaction of the patients and on the abilities and readiness of the healers. This attitude went well with the practiced custom, that healers didn’t wish to get the money put into their hands, but instead asked the patients to secretly hide it under a cloth lying on a table nearby.\n\nThe needed utensils were self-made from wood or sheet. Mortars and pestles used to grind and mix substances were made out of wood, different cups and dishes for cooking, on the contrary, from sheet. Hoppers consisted of both wood as well as of sheet, whereas rakes used to collect berries, as an exception, were also cut from plastic (usually from used plastic bottles). Finished preparations were always stored in glass vessels including cups, bottles and other forms. Depending on the bottled substance, clear or dark glass was preferred. Glass utensils were cleaned in hot water and then sterilized by heating in an oven before use.\n\nMedical care was ensured in particular for people who didn’t have access to treatments by academic or “modern” doctors. The “traditional doctors” thereby enjoyed such a good reputation, that people from all over the country were visiting in search of alternative ways to cure their ailments and diseases. Patients came from quite different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some of them (3 out of 18 in 2 days) arrived even from neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The ethnicity or occupation of the patients accordingly differed and it seemed that it didn’t matter that some of the preparations included Muslim prayers. Visits were motivated by various goals. Tourists came by while relaxing and enjoying the nature of the area. Some just wanted to satisfy their curiosity and usually bought a “feel good” tea, a relaxing bath mixture or a mild sedative. Patients who came purposeful for medical reasons had very different health problems. Among them were even people plagued by serious diseases and symptoms like a bad blood picture after a chemotherapy or young women with sterility problems.\n\nEven today, superstition played a dominant role in the beliefs of the healers. They separated their belief in God (healers were in general religious) from superstition, which has been passed over from generation to generation since ages just the same way as they handed down their medical knowledge. Superstitious and non-superstitious aspects, however, interwove with each other in the medical treatments. A good example for the importance of superstitious beliefs in healing were nervous system disorders which were considered “bad luck” or “devils work”. Interestingly, the treatment of such diseases was exclusively up to two old ladies. “Saljevanje strave” was the name of the healing method practiced, actually a ritual carried out by these women. Melted lead was poured into a bowl of water placed above the patient’s head. The causes underlying the nervous system disorders were than inferred from the appearance of the solidified lead. This procedure was at the same time supposed to free the patient from the identified bad influences. Amulets made of small pieces of paper with prayers written on them were also used to deal with these kinds of mental problems.\n\nOther stories persisting in the village and defying logic or scientific knowledge at least were on medicinal herbs. The beliefs in the origin of formic acid in stinging nettles of the genus Urtica can serve as an example: The locals reported, that stinging nettles obtained their healing power from visiting ants as a reward for protection by these well-fortified plants (formic acid means also ant’s acid). We also recorded different sayings concerning plants supposed to have supernatural properties as vividly expressed in the following example: “Trava Iva od mrtva pravi živa”, (“Mountain germander [=Teucrium montanum] makes a dead man alive”).\n\nPlant species, preparations and medicinal use\n\nIn this study 82 prescriptions applied in human therapy could be collected in scope of the 12 interviews performed. All prescriptions constituted traditional knowledge as in the past they have been delivered verbally from one generation to the other, usually from mother to daughter, some reaching back as far as to 1817 [11]. Forty-three species used by the informants are listed in together with their scientific names, affiliation to the botanical family, local common names, English names, the plant parts used as well as the medical indications and preparation procedures. Of particular interest appeared species which are unknown or rarely used by traditional medicine in Central Europe (cf. Austrian traditional medicine; [30]) as for instance species endemic to the Balkans. More attention should be paid to these plants as some of them may be of therapeutic value. Out of these we would like to mention in particular Achillea nobilis, Artemisia laciniata, Teucrium montanum, Picea glauca, Urtica galeopsifolia, and the endemic species Teucrium arduini, Satureja montana, and Satureja subspicata [4].\n\nTab. 1.\n\nBotanical taxa & FamilyLocal namePlant part usedPreparation & Medicinal useAbies alba Mill.

The most frequent ones were gastro-intestinal tract ailments (mentioned 41 times by the informants), blood system disorders (mentioned 36 times), skin (mentioned 35 times), respiratory tract (mentioned 23 times) and urinary-genital tract ailments (mentioned 20 times). Less commonly treated were rheumatism (mentioned 20 times), disorders of the metabolism and the nervous system (both mentioned 10 times) as well as disorders of senses, cardio-vascular system, gall and musculoskeletal system, each of which were reported less then 10 times by the informants.\n\nThe most frequent preparation was an infusion (tea, about 35% of the recorded preparations), mostly used internally. In a couple of cases only, the tea was used externally as a flushing fluid. Infusions were followed in frequency of appliance by ointments or balms as well as by decocts each used in about 18% of the cases. All other preparations were found to be less important as they were mentioned less then 11 times by the informants (approx. 5.5%). These preparations were directly applied fresh plants or freshly pressed juices, tinctures, powders, sirups, macerates, oils and collars. Water, alcoholic fluids (red wine, white wine and hard liquor, so called Bosnian “šljivovica”), vinegar and milk served as solvents. Honey played an outstanding role in traditional medicine of this people. It was applied as preservative agent or as an additive of cosmetic products as well as a sweetener in teas [4].\n\nThe special Bosnian balms known as “mehlems” were prepared from freshly chopped or freshly pressed herbal parts of various plant species. Warmed resins from Abies or Picea species, raw cow or pig lard, olive oil and honey served as basis. The plants most frequently used for these balms were species of the genera Arctium, Carlina, Euphrasia, Hypericum, Plantago, Teucrium and Urtica [11]. The balms were applied to cure skin and other external injuries or against rheumatism, and in the case of Euphrasia rostkoviana to treat eye injuries."
