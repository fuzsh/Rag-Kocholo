Flowers in the first year and ongoing. Source of taxodione, a diterpenoic compound that has antiinflammatory and tumour reducing effects. The plant attracts and feeds bees, both native bees and honeybees. The flowers are showy and may be used in cut flower arrangements. Space plants 2 to 3 feet apart.\n\nPotted plant, Certified Organically Grown"
