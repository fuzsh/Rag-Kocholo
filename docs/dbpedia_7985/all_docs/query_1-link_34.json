        "text": "Evidence from the collection of various letters (Variae epistulae) of the Italo-Roman aristocrat, Ostrogothic official of highest order and scholar Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator (fifth - sixth c.) that refer to conditions on the eastern Adriatic coast in the first half of the sixth century is already well-known in scholarship. From the first comprehensive economic-historical analysis in Croatian historiography of Cassiodorus’ information about Istria in an 1988 article by Robert Matijašić „Kasiodorova pisma kao izvor za poznavanje kasnoantičke povijesti Istre (Cass. Var. XII, 22, 23, 24)“ [Cassiodorus’ letters as a source for knowledge of the history of Istria in Late Antiquity (Cass. Var. XII, 22, 23, 24)], more than three decades have passed, so it is appropriate to reconsider them, particularly after they had also been discussed by Andrej Novak in his 2007 book L’Istria nella prima età bizantina and, more recently, by Rajko Bratož in his 2016 paper \"La produzione e il consumo di alimenti nella provincia della Venetia et Histria al tempo de Goti orientali\". The aim is to recontextualize the information within the broader area of the eastern Adriatic and problematize the previous conclusions. Starting from the existing results, the intention is to produce a relevant research addendum that can contribute to better appreciation of the economic situation in Late Antique Istria and be a basis for understanding the medieval conditions.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze and interpret the literary and archaeological evidence relating to the rule of the Ostrogoths in late antique southern Pannonia, i.e. the late Roman provinces of Pannonia Savia and Pannonia Secunda (known in the Ostrogothic times as Pannonia Sirmiensis). The study is centred around two distinctive chronological periods into which, according to narrative sources, the Ostrogothic presence and rule in southern Pannonia can be divided: first, from the collapse of the Hun dominance in the Middle Danube region to the departure of the Ostrogothic groups from Pannonia (454-473), and second, from the establishment of the Ostrogothic rule in Italy to their withdrawal from the region between the Sava, the Drava and the Danube at the onset of the Byzantine-Ostrogothic war (493-535). The second period was introduced by a brief Ostrogothic stay in southern Pannonia on their way from the Lower Danube area to Italy (488-489), as well as extended by a temporary reappearance of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia Savia when they mustered troops from among local barbarian groups (537). One of the main purposes of the study is to bring the historical record into a meaningful and methodologically sound correlation with archaeological evidence bearing in mind the limitations with regard to precise dating of the material and its attribution to specific groups of peoples.\n\nThe book under review offers a complete English translation of Cassiodorus' Variae, a work which-undeservedly-has played little role in the scholarly debate about late antique letter collections and the way they shape (and are shaped by) the political, cultural, and social landscape of the so-called 'successor states' in the Mediterranean. The twelve books of the Variae contain 468 official letters mainly issued by the rulers of Ostrogothic Italy (507-537). Five books were written in the name of Theoderic the Great (Cassiod. var. 1-5), three in that of his successors Athalaric, Amalasuintha, Theodahad, and Vitiges (Cassiod. var. 8-10). Books six and seven contain template letters (formulae); the last two books (Cassiod. var. 11-12) were written in Cassiodorus' own name in his capacity as praefectus praetorio. The letter collection is complemented by a philosophical treatise on the soul (De anima), which Cassiodorus intends to be understood as the thirteenth book of the Variae (pp. 16-17). Michael Shane Bjornlie's book is the first full English translation of all letters of the Variae. It does not include the treatise entitled De amina.\n\nThe fate of Cassiodorus’ Variae during the Early Middle Ages is largely unknown, since the manuscript tradition begins with the eleventh century and long quotations taken from them are attested only from this period. However, words or expressions reminiscent of the Variae occur more than once in Charlemagne’s letters to Byzantium, in the works of Paschasius and in the Donation of Constantine. The author of the epistles sent by Charlemagne’s to the East Roman emperor was aware of the ideological context of Variae 1.1 and the same is true for the Donation of Constantine. On the other hand, Paschasius used Cassiodorus as a source of elegant words and expressions, thereby treating him like a classical author. It is impossible to ascertain whether Carolingian writers had access to all books of the Variae or to a substantial selection of letters (similar for instance to the manuscript containing the Epistolae Austrasicae), but there is a high degree of likelihood that they knew quite a few epistles of Cassiodorus and were able to appreciate the political messages conveyed by them.\n\nOne of the fundamental events in the formation of the medieval European continent was the transition to more complex organisational structures, even for the inhabitants of the territories beyond the Roman limes. The historical-social transformation movement of the western European world and the new multiethnic composition of the new Roman-Germanic societies were only two of the consequences of the collapse of the division between the highly-developed Mediterranean world and the areas not directly controlled by Rome where, however, stable socioeconomic organisational forms had still developed, involving both the steppe and the Germanic populations. Even if it never was an insuperable boundary for all those who lived in the areas not under Roman control , the limes forever lost that ideological concept of barrier and border between two diverse and opposing worlds. The mechanism that caused such consequences involved very complex processes that, as they occurred, affected the environmental geographic conditions as well as the local traditions and ethnic affinities. The populations that continued to live in the areas beyond the Pannonian border introduced themselves into the stream of cultural transformations that arose in that part of the post-Roman European territories between Late Antiquity and the early medieval centuries. It would still be several centuries before this change would complete its natural cycle. In the end, the tribal societies disappeared and new social and cultural structures arose. This helped to spread new ways of using nature, new standards for social coexistence and a new vision of the world. 1. THE BALKAN AREAS AS THE CROSSROADS OF CULTURES In 364, following Jovian's death in Ancyra, the commanders of the regiments and other high-ranking imperial officials chose Valentinian, a Pannonian officer and a Christian, to succeed him as emperor; in turn, Valenti-nian personally proclaimed his brother Valens Augustus on 28 March of that year. 1 The end of the Constantine dynasty led to a return to the system of the 'military monarchy' of the third century and, as was the case under the Tetrarchy, to the division of East and West into two areas, assigning the pars ori-entis to Valens and the pars occidentis to Valentinian. Given that they had to deal with the problem of defending the imperial boundaries, the emperors lived more and more frequently at their residences near the borders – Treviri, Antioch and Constantinople – rather than Rome. 2 In the western areas, Valentinian had to deal with constant raids by the Alamanni in Gaul, the Picts and the Scots in Britannia, and the Sarmatians and the Quadi along the Danube. Valentinian died in Pannonia in 375 and was immediately succeeded by his son Gratian and half-brother Valentinian II, although the latter was appointed upon the advice of the magister militum per Illyricum, the Frank Merobaud, solely to garner the loyalty of the imperial regiments. 3"
