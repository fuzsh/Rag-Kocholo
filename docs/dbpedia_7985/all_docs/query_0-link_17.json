        "text": "The international exhibition project Avars and Slavs is presented through two exhibitions: the Croatian exhibition Avars and Slavs south of the Drava river, and the Slovak exhibition Avars and Slavs north of the Danube. The exhibitions display the archaeological material from Croatian museums, private collections, also including a group of items found during recent archaeological excavations, as well as the items from Slovak museums and institutions. The aforementioned period is presented through carefully chosen jewellery items, warrior equipment, agricultural tools, pottery, and bone items.The exhibitions are the center of communication and interaction of the two distant, yet close Slavic countries, and show incredible similarities among the material found in Croatia and Slovakia.\n\nIt hаs long been known that after the year 568 parts of the Germanic population were to be left within the limits of the newly-formed Avar Khaganate. This is best confirmed on large and thoroughly excavated sites, particularly in the cemeteries and the settlement at Kölked-Feketekapu. In the south of the Avar Khaganate, present-day northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, there is only a limited number of finds to testify to that effect. In this article, we are going to discuss a group of very interesting finds from Aradac (Aradka), and to list other finds of Germanic origin from this territory, coming from Bečej (Óbecse) and Bogojevo (Gombos). A special emphasis will be placed on the dating of these grave-finds.\n\nIn this article we present some of the most characteristic possessions (and status symbols) of sixth-century Germanic foederati in the Upper Moesian limes – their weapons. According to archaeological dating and historical records, the finds from the Jakovo, Batajnica, Singidunum, Margum and Viminacium cemeteries may be first ascribed to the Heruli, settled in the area from c. 512. The article studies weapon combinations in graves and recapitulates Herulic military practices. Our evidence reveals a clearly differentiated and internally stratified community with a privileged position, derived from its role in the defence of the border and engagement in numerous military campaigns of the Empire.\n\nIn the course of rescue excavations in 2011 a grave was found at the Davidovac-Gradište site. Th e locality is situated in the southernmost part of present-day Serbia, in the South Morava valley, on the route of the Roman Via publica. In the grave, a 30–40 year old male was buried with his belt and a battle axe. Th e belt consists of pressed bronze sheet strap-ends and a cast bronze buckle. Alongside them there was a purse buckle, also a characteristic early seventh-century Byzantine product. The anthropological analysis indicates that the deceased had military training. Such graves are rarely found throughout the Byzantine Empire. Being very diff erent from the sixth-century Roman burials, they were commonly attributed to migratory mercenaries of the Empire. Having surveyed similar burials of that date from Corinth, Pergamon, present-day Albania and Sardinia, we are in favour of interpreting them in the context of social changes which occurred at a time of crisis in the Empire, and not in ethnic terms.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze and interpret the literary and archaeological evidence relating to the rule of the Ostrogoths in late antique southern Pannonia, i.e. the late Roman provinces of Pannonia Savia and Pannonia Secunda (known in the Ostrogothic times as Pannonia Sirmiensis). The study is centred around two distinctive chronological periods into which, according to narrative sources, the Ostrogothic presence and rule in southern Pannonia can be divided: first, from the collapse of the Hun dominance in the Middle Danube region to the departure of the Ostrogothic groups from Pannonia (454-473), and second, from the establishment of the Ostrogothic rule in Italy to their withdrawal from the region between the Sava, the Drava and the Danube at the onset of the Byzantine-Ostrogothic war (493-535). The second period was introduced by a brief Ostrogothic stay in southern Pannonia on their way from the Lower Danube area to Italy (488-489), as well as extended by a temporary reappearance of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia Savia when they mustered troops from among local barbarian groups (537). One of the main purposes of the study is to bring the historical record into a meaningful and methodologically sound correlation with archaeological evidence bearing in mind the limitations with regard to precise dating of the material and its attribution to specific groups of peoples."
