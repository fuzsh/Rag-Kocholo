        "text": "Murghab at Pul-i-Khishti. In March 1885 when the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission should have been engaged in settling the boundary-line, this portion of it was in dispute between the Afghans and the Russians. A part of the Afghan force was encamped on the west bank of the Kushk, and on the 29th of March General Komarov sent an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal. On their refusal the Russians attacked them at 3 a.m. on the 30th of March and drove them across the Pul-i-Khishti Bridge with a loss of some 600 men. The incident nearly give rise to war between England and Russia; but the amir Abdur-Rahman, who was present at the Rawalpindi conference with Lord Dufferin at the time, affected to regard the matter as a mere frontier scuffle. The border-line subsequently laid down gives to Russia the corner between the Kushk and Murghab rivers as far as Maruchak on the Murghab, and the Kushk post has now become the frontier post of the Russian army of occupation.\n\nPANNA, or Punna, a native state of Central India, in the Bundelkhand agency. Area, 2492 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 192,986, showing a decrease of 19% in the preceding decade due to famine; tribute £33,000. The chief, whose title is maharaja, is a rajput of the Bundela clan, descended from Chhatar Sal, the champion of the independence of Bundelkhand in the 18th century. The maharaja Lokpal Singh died in 1898, leaving an only son, Madho Singh, who, in 1902, was found guilty by a special commission on the charge of poisoning his uncle, and was deposed. The diamond mines, for which the state was formerly famous, are now scarcely profitable. There are no railways, but one or two good roads. The town of Panna is 62 m. S. of Banda. Pop. (1901), 11,346. It has a fine modern palace and several handsome temples and shrines.\n\nPANNAGE (O. Fr. pasnage, from Med. Lat. pasnagium, pasnaticum for pastionaticum, pascio; pascere, to feed), an English legal term for the feeding of swine in a wood or forest, hence used of a right or privilege to do this. The word is also used generally of the food, such as acorns, beech-mast, &c., on which the swine feed.\n\nPANNIER (Fr. panier, Lat. panarium, a basket for carrying bread, panis), a basket for carrying bread or other provisions; more especially a broad, flat basket, generally slung in pairs across a mule, pony or ass for transport. The term has also been applied to an over skirt in a woman's dress attached to the back of the bodice and draped so as to give a “bunchy” appearance. At various times in the history of costume this appearance has been produced by a framework of padded whalebone, steel, &c., used to support the dress, such frameworks being known as “panniers.” At the Inns of Court, London, there was formerly an official known as a “pannier man,” whose duties were concerned with procuring provisions at market, blowing the horn before meals, &c. The office has been in many of the inns long obsolete, and was formally abolished at the Inner Temple in 1900. At the Inner Temple the robed waiters in hall have been called “panniers,” and apparently were in some way connected with the officer above mentioned, but the proper duties of the two were in no way identical.\n\nPANNONIA, in ancient geography a country bounded north and east by the Danube, conterminous westward with Noricum and upper Italy, and southward with Dalmatia and upper Moesia. It thus corresponds to the south-western part of Hungary, with portions of lower Austria, Styria, Carniola, Croatia, and Slavonia. Its original inhabitants (Pannonii, sometimes called Paeonii by the Greeks) were probably of Illyrian race. From the 4th century B.C. it was invaded by various Celtic tribes, probably survivors of the hosts of Brennus, the chief of whom were the Carni, Scordisci and Taurisci. Little is heard of Pannonia until 35 B.C., when its inhabitants, having taken up arms in support of the Dalmatians, were attacked by Augustus, who conquered and occupied Siscia (Sissek). The country was not, however, definitely subdued until 9 B.C., when it was incorporated with lUyria, the frontier of which was thus extended as far as the Danube. In A.D. 7 the Pannonians, with the Dalmatians and other Illyrian tribes, revolted, and were overcome by Tiberius and Germanicus, after a hard-fought campaign which lasted for two years. In A.D. 10 Pannonia was organized as a separate province — according to A. W. Zumpt (Studia romana), not till A.D. 20; at least, when the three legions stationed there mutinied after the death of Augustus (A.D. 14), Junius Blaesus is spoken of by Tacitus (Annals, i. 16) as legate of Pannonia and commander of the legions. The proximity of dangerous barbarian tribes (Quadi, Marcomanni) necessitated the presence of a large number of troops (seven legions in later times), and numerous fortresses were built on the bank of the Danube. Some time between the years 102 and 107, which marked the termination of the first and second Dacian wars, Trajan divided the province into Pannonia superior (ἡ ἅνω), the western, and inferior ( ἡ κάτω), the eastern portion. According to Ptolemy, these divisions were separated by a line drawn from Arrabona (Raab) in the north to Servitium (Gradiska) in the south; later, the boundary was placed farther east. The whole country was sometimes called the Pannonias (Pannoniac). Pannonia superior was under the consular legate, who had formerly administered the single province, and had three legions under his control: Pannonia inferior at first under a praetorian legate with a single legion as garrison, after Marcus Aurelius under a consular legate, stll with only one legion. The frontier on the Danube was protected by the establishment of the two colonies Aelia Mursia (Esse) and Aelia Aquincum (Alt-Ofen, modern Buda) by Hadrian.\n\nUnder Diocletian a fourfold division of the country was made. Pannonia inferior was divided into (i) Valeria (so called from Diocletian's daughter, the wife of Galerius), extending along the Danube from Altinum (Mohacs) to Brigetio (Ó-Szöny), and (2) Pannonia sccunda, round about Sirmium (Mitrovitz) at the meeting of the valleys of the Save, Drave, and Danube. Pannonia superior was divided into (3) Pannonia prima, its northern, and (4) Savia (also called Pannonia ripariensis), its southern part. Valeria and Pannonia prima were under a praeses and a dux; Pannonia secunda under a consularis is and a dux; Savia under a dux and, later a corrector. In the middle of the 5th century Pannonia was ceded to the Huns by Theodosius II., and after the death of Attila successively passed into the hands of the Ostrogoths, Longobards (Lombards), and Avars.\n\nThe inhabitants of Pannonia are described as brave and warlike, but cruel and treacherous. Except in the mountainous districts, the country was fairly productive, especially after the great forests had been cleared by Probus and Galerius. Before that time timber had been one of its most important exports. Its chief agricultural products were oats and barley, from which the inhabitants brewed a kind of beer named sabaea. Vines and olive-trees were little cultivated, the former having been first introduced in the neighbourhood of Sirmium by Probus. Saliunca (Celtic, nard) was a common growth, as in Noricum. Pannonia was also famous for its breed of hunting-dogs. Although no mention is made of its mineral wealth by the ancients, it is probable that it contained iron and silver mines. Its chief rivers were the Dravus (Drave), Savus (Save), and Arrabo (Raab), in addition to the Danuvius (less correctly, Danubius), into which the first three rivers flow."
