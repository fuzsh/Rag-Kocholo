        "text": "Family: Mint (Lamiaceae)\n\nHardy to Zones 4 to 9\n\n(Austrian Sage) Herbaceous perennial native to highlands of Russia and Eastern Europe, flowering white to pale yellow to a height of 3 feet–multiple upright racemes from a large, incredibly flat, malodorous basal rosette of coarse leaves. Flowers in the first year and ongoing. The plant attracts and feeds bees. Traditional use: Source of taxodione, a diterpenoic compound that has anti-inflammatory and tumor reducing effects. The flowers are showy and may be used in cut flower arrangements. Sow seed in warm soil (circa 70 degrees F). Barely cover, tamp well and keep evenly moist until germination, which is rapid. Work plants up in pots and transplant out to a spacing of 2 to 3 feet between the plants.\n\nPacket contains 30 seeds\n\n1 gram contains ~400 seeds\n\n5 grams contains ~ 2,000 seeds\n\n10 grams contains ~ 4000 seeds\n\ncertified organically grown"
