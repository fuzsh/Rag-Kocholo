        "text": "Pannonia, province of the Roman Empire, corresponding to present-day western Hungary and parts of eastern Austria, as well as portions of several Balkan states, primarily Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia (Vojvodina). The Pannonians were mainly Illyrians, but there were some Celts in the western part of the province.\n\nThe Roman conquest of the area began in 35 bce under Octavian (who later became the emperor Augustus) and was completed in 14 bce with the capture of Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Vojvodina), the key town of the Sava River valley. The Pannonian tribes, joined by the Dalmatians, revolted in 6 ce, posing the gravest threat to Italy since Hannibal’s invasion. After the revolt was put down, Pannonia was organized as a separate province in 9 ce and garrisoned with three legions.\n\nThe emperor Trajan divided the province about 106 ce. The western and northern districts constituted Pannonia Superior, which was the focal point of the Roman wars with the Marcomanni in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161–180), who died at Vindobona (Vienna). The southern and eastern districts were organized as Pannonia Inferior under Diocletian (284–305). Pannonia Superior was divided into Pannonia Prima and Pannonia Ripariensis (or Savia), and Pannonia Inferior was divided into Valeria and Pannonia Secunda."
