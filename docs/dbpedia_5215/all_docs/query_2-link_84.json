        "text": "Lou pichot tresor (French-Provençal dictionary) - R.P. Xavier De Fourvières, canon, with the collaboration of his colleague R. P. Rupert.\n\nAfter the Great Dictionary, \"Lou Tresor dóu Felibrige\" of the illustrious Frederic Mistral, who showed himself in this work the Littré of the Provencal language, demand was demanded and Lou Pichot Trésor du Félibrige was demanded from everywhere. Well ! Here it is. Take it and browse it at leisure. This is our preface. We could, no doubt, explain how useful, in the composition of this work, have been our familiar and assiduous associations with the people, and, on the other hand, what precious help has brought us the dictionaries of Mistral, Honorat , Doujat, Avril, Piat and niçard Pellegrini, as well as the other lexicons or vocabularies of the Langue d'Oc, Languedociens, Gascons, Limousins, Dauphinois, etc. We could also bring out the practical side of our little dictionary: first, from the linguistic point of view, which made us group together, and in separate paragraphs, the words of the same family, as well, of course, as the alphabetical order Included -; Then from the historical and ethnographic point of view ... (translation from the Preface, original edition of 1902).\n\nConstantly \"reprinted\" (identical to the 1902 edition) for more than a century, no publisher had dared to attack the complete reconstruction of the work in two volumes (French Provencal and Provençal- French). It is now done. Here's the new Pichot Tresor!\n\nThe author:\n\nXavier de Fourvières (1853-1912), born in Robion (Vaucluse), was a canon of the Premonstratensian order. He emigrated to England from 1903 to 1912, after the Law on the Congregations and became superior of the priory of Storrington in Sussex. Author of numerous works in Provencal (of which the most famous remains his Pichot Tresor), he was majoral of the Felibrige."
