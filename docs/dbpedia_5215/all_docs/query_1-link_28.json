        "text": "In the ecclesiastical language, the term canon (κανών) was introduced to indicate the practical rule of the teaching of faith and to differentiate it from the concept of law (lex – νομος). This term therefore identifies any rule of the Church that puts into practice the doctrine of faith, defined by dogmas. The expression \"holy canons\" defines the collection of canons approved and received by the Church. Over time, some authors have made various proposals on the role of holy canons in the Church, oscillating them to be canceled as unsubstantiated until they say that their text would have been revealed. According to the doctrine and practice of the Church, the holy canons apply pastorally to ecclesial life, customized for each individual situation. Therefore, in the Church, it is necessary for all activities to take into account the fundamental principles contained in the holy canons, so that the life of the Church conforms to the teaching of christian-orthodox faith.\n\nThe paper is dedicated to the issue of conceptualization of understanding (and confessing) of Church as a Catholic one and the role of universalism. This theme is provoked by a remark of Metropolitan of Pergamo John (Zizioulas) in his Being as Communion. Three moments could be identified in the historical process. The first is the implementation of the adjective καθολικὴ to the ἐκκλησία. The second one is the symbiosis and the overlapping of two kinds of universalism – the Imperial (progressive) and the Church one (eschatological) and the beginning of conceptualization. The third moment is the translation of καθολικὴ as sȃborna in the language of Slavs and the multiplication of the Byzantine political philosophy in the new “forms”. At the end is evaluated the last transformation of imperial Catholicity in local autocephalous churches and the consequences of this process on today’s confession and practice of Catholicity.\n\nAbstract The study presents the Interpretation of Canon 3 of the 1st Ecumenical Synod in Nicaea (325). The Fathers of the 1st Synod in Nicaea, by strengthening the moral life of the clergy, condemned the concubinage with hidden women, but they did not support celibacy over marriage. The cohabitation with legal wife is not mentioned, but this lack of mentioning does not automatically mean that the separation from wives or the celibacy were introduced in the Church legislation and practice. Wife is considered to be a full member of the category of legitimate women; but here, the canonical disposition refers to non-married or widow members of the clergy, who may cohabitate only with mother, sister, aunt or other women connected through physical kinship and who are beyond any doubt. The intention of the participants to the Synod was not to introduce celibacy as mandatory for clergy, but the text of the canon is very clear, as it aims to strengthen the discipline of the clergy, the moral life, through confirming the custom and condemning the abuses. In fact, we don’t even find references to such a rule that supports celibacy. Keywords Clergy, Concubinage, Celibacy, Monastic state\n\nBorn, educated and living in the multilinguistic and multiconfessional space of the Austrian Monarchy, Andrei Şaguna has been able to fructify both the cultural and the patristic heritage of Orthodoxy, and the modern and liberal spirit of the second half of the 19 th century, cultivating good relationship with Bishop Georg Daniel Teutsch and friendships with Alois Sentz and Jakob Rannicher. His correspondence and the historiographic evidence reveal these contacts as having been marked by respect, due to the function his acquaintances had in the academic staff, the imperial and local administrative and educational mechanism, but especially by reverence and appreciation. The life, activity, and works of Metropolitan Andrei Şaguna, make him a European figure, because of his formation, his pastoral mission, his strong dedication to education and to bringing the culture closer to the Transylvanian Romanians, and his part in the inter-confessional dialogue before the initiation of the Ecumenical Movement and the official contacts between the Orthodox and the Lutheran churches."
