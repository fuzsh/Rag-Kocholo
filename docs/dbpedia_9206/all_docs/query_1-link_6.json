The traditional currencies competently discharged the functions of money, however, and it required fifty years before the pre-colonial currencies, attacked by the colonial authorities and unrecognized as legal tender, gradually lost standing and proved worthless to their last holders. Theoretical implications of these developments are discussed.\n\nType\n\nArticles\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of Economic History , Volume 39 , Issue 3 , September 1979 , pp. 623 - 654\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022050700092949 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © The Economic History Association 1979\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

The Administration's insistence on collecting revenues only in British currency was due to the fact that the bulk of the revenue was remitted to the Crown Agents in London, and held or invested there. Only funds sufficient to meet the small demands of the government in Africa—such as the payment of wages to laborers, and the purchase of small quantities of food, clothing, hardware, and building materials—were kept in the local Treasury. The salaries of officials were paid in London. In Africa they lived off their generous allowances, and in virtually free housing.\n\n39\n\n39 CO/520/8, Moor to Colonial Office, 12/6/01.\n\n40\n\n40 CO/520/8, Leslie Probyn to Colonial Office, Aug. 13, 1901.\n\n41\n\n41 These included the brass rod and the Perekule or Awonawo manillas valued at 3d.

Plank.” Plank was convicted on two counts of falsification of accounts and forgery; he was at the time the Niger Company's station agent at Idah. The John Holt firm went one better, using the “measure” to fleece even their own locally-recruited staff, who were given contracts “of the usual native type, given to all our clerks in charge of stations—accepting responsibility for all goods entrusted to their care, etc…. They are paid in goods—thirty shillings per month—charged at native prices, the cost of which would be twenty shillings; goods are sent to them at Native prices also. For instance, we dispatch 50 measures of goods (each measures 5s., interior selling prices) and in return we expect 50 bushels of kernels.… The prices paid for kernels in these interior places enables us to pay all expenses and get the kernels down to Asaba at the same price paidfor them Asaba itself.” (Italics are mine.) Holt Papers, Box 1, file 6, extract from Mr. Drewett's letter dated Onitsha, July 5, 1905. For a description of “sortings,” “the ounce,” the “measure,” and the “Good For” see Hopkins, West Africa, p. Ill; Walter Ofonagoro, “The Opening Up of Southern Nigeria to British Trade,” pp. 168-71; and Clough, Oil Rivers Trader, p. 38.\n\n50\n\n50 Similar adjustments had been made by European traders over the years in other areas of West Africa. Examples include the “bar” in seventeenth-century Senegambia and Eastern Nigeria; the “sorting” used in the seventeenth century between the Gold Coast and Cameroons; and the “ounce” of eighteenth-century Gold Coast. See Johnson, Marion, “The Ounce in Eighteenth-Century West African Trade,” Journal ofAfrican History, 7 (1966), 197–214CrossRefGoogle Scholar; , Hopkins, West Africa, pp. 111–12Google Scholar.\n\n51\n\n51 On July 11, 1896, The Lagos Weekly Record drew attention to this problem: “The fart should not be lost sight of that in proportion as the interior natives learn the value of gold and silver as money, in like proportion will they be inclined to hoard it up. The majority of the native producers only come to the colony to exchange their produce for specie which they carry back and hoard up. Their wants in respect of European goods for actual consumption are very small.” In 1922 Lugard indicated that the local people were indeed hoarding their money rather than spending it on high-priced British imports; Lugard, The Dual Mandate, p. 264.\n\n52\n\n52 CO/446/24, F.
