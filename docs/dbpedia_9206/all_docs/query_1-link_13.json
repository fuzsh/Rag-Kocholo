        "text": "How did colonialism impact African monetary systems? There is now a substantial literature debating the impact of colonial policies which were intended to impose single currencies linked to metropolitan monetary systems within colonial boundaries.Footnote 1 Such policies served a number of purposes for colonial governments, ranging from a reduction in transaction costs for merchants and governments to a physical and symbolic demonstration of colonial control (Helleiner Reference Helleiner2002). However, the slow and uneven displacement of precolonial currencies by colonial coins and notes also revealed the limits of that control. Africans not only continued to use indigenous currencies such as cowrie shells and kissi pennies, but also retained long-standing practices of negotiating values between multiple currencies (Guyer Reference Guyer2004).\n\nThis literature has focused primarily on the opening decades of the colonial period and on the relationship between colonial and indigenous currencies. It has, however, generally neglected the fact that the colonial period as a whole was one of significant monetary instability affecting metropolitan states and, by extension, the African economies linked to them through colonialism. During the period of colonial conquest in Africa, European currencies (and the colonial currencies linked to them) enjoyed stable rates of exchange through the collective enforcement of the pre-war gold standard. This stability vanished with the outbreak of World War I, when imperial powers first abandoned the gold standard and then attempted unsuccessfully to revive it. This instability makes this period, as Barry Eichengreen puts it, one with “an exceptionally rich menu of international monetary experience” (Reference Eichengreen1990:1–2). While this menu has been widely explored for Europe and North America, the impact of this interwar monetary instability on colonial economies remains neglected. How did fluctuations in the exchange rates of colonial currencies impact the monetary systems which had emerged in Africa during the early colonial period? To what extent were colonial states able to manage this instability? And how did producers, merchants, and other stakeholders respond to the rapidly changing global economic situation?\n\nThis article explores these questions through a discussion of three different crises for African states during the 1920s and 1930s which were directly tied to fluctuations in the exchange rates of colonial currencies. These include the demonetization of the franc in The Gambia, the rupee crisis in Kenya, and independent Liberia’s shift from using British West African currencies to the US dollar. Together, these incidents illustrate three points about the impact of colonialism and globalization on African monetary systems. First, they go beyond existing arguments about the limits of colonial power to show the degree to which African governments struggled to adapt to changing global economic conditions. All three crises originated in some way in policies adopted during the era of gold standard stability which later became untenable. Second, they show that Africans’ facility with managing multiple currencies extended to the colonial currencies in circulation, and Africans responded readily to opportunities for arbitrage profits created by exchange rate fluctuations—marginal gains for the colonial era. Finally, they suggest that any comprehensive history of interwar monetary instability and the collapse of the gold standard needs to look beyond Europe to consider the impact on economies linked to European monetary systems through colonialism."
