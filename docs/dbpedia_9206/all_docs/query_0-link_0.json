        "text": "1821–1888 colonial entity of Britain in West Africa\n\nBritish West Africa was the collective name for British settlements in West Africa during the colonial period, either in the general geographical sense or the formal colonial administrative entity. British West Africa as a colonial entity was originally officially known as Colony of Sierra Leone and its Dependencies, then British West African Territories and finally British West African Settlements.[1]\n\nThe United Kingdom held varying parts of these territories or the whole throughout the 19th century. From west to east, the colonies became the independent countries of The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria. Until independence, Ghana was referred to as the Gold Coast.\n\nHistorical jurisdiction\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish West Africa constituted during two periods (17 October 1821, until its first dissolution on 13 January 1850, and again 19 February 1866, until its final demise on 28 November 1888) as an administrative entity under a governor-in-chief (comparable in rank to a governor-general), an office vested in the governor of Sierra Leone (at Freetown).[1]\n\nThe other colonies originally included in the jurisdiction were the Gambia and the British Gold Coast (modern Ghana). Also western Nigeria, eastern Nigeria and northern Nigeria were included.[2]\n\nAfrica's present makeup includes Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Western Nigeria, Eastern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria. These countries and areas are artifacts of the post-colonial period, or what the Ghanaian writer Kwame Appiah dubs neo-colonialism.[citation needed]\n\nBritish West Africa was originally founded at the urging of the prominent abolitionist Fowell Buxton, who felt that ending the Atlantic slave trade required some level of British control of the coastline.[3] Development was solely based on modernization, and autonomous educational systems were the first step to modernising indigenous culture. Cultures and interests of indigenous peoples were ignored. A new social order, as well as European influences within schools and libraries [4] and local traditions, helped mould British West Africa's culture. The British West African colonial school curriculum helped play a role in this. Local elites developed, with new values and philosophies, who changed the overall cultural development.[5]\n\nAftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nEven after its final dissolution, a single currency, the British West African pound, was in effect throughout the region—including Nigeria—from 1907 to 1962.[6]\n\nNigeria gained independence in 1960. Sierra Leone was self-governing by 1958 and gained independence in 1961. Gambia gained independence in 1965. In 1954, the British Gold Coast was allowed by Britain to self-govern and in 1957, the Gold Coast was given independence from Britain, under the name Ghana.[7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish colonisation in Africa\n\nBritish Togoland\n\nColonial Nigeria\n\nGambia Colony and Protectorate\n\nGold Coast (British colony)\n\nRoyal West African Frontier Force\n\nSierra Leone Colony and Protectorate\n\nEuropean colonisation in Africa\n\nBrandenburger Gold Coast\n\nDanish Gold Coast\n\nDutch Gold Coast\n\nPortuguese Gold Coast\n\nSwedish Gold Coast\n\nScramble for Africa\n\nWest Africa cricket team\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
