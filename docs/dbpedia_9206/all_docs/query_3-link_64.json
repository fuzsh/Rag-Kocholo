        "text": "Area: 923,768 kmÂ² Capital: Abuja Population: approx. 231 million Official languages: English Currency: Naira (NGN)[1]\n\n1. Brief overview of Nigeria\n\nNigeria is a country located on the west coast of Africa, bordering Niger to the north, Chad and Cameroon to the east and Benin to the west. The southern border is formed by the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa,[2] with more than 250 ethnic groups speaking over 500 languages.[3]\n\nNigeria is rich in natural resources and has large oil and gas reserves in particular.[4] The majority of the country's export revenue comes from the oil sector. In the first half of 2022, oil revenues accounted for 29 per cent of total government revenue; the share of gross domestic product (GDP) was 5.6 per cent (as at Q3 2022).[5] The main reason for this is the fact that Nigeria, despite being Africa's largest producer of oil and gas, has to import almost all of its fuel needs as the four state-owned refineries have become dilapidated and unproductive due to mismanagement.[6] Other important raw materials are natural gas and hard coal.[7] Nigeria is also the fourth largest seller of diamonds in Africa.[8]\n\nThe borders of present-day Nigeria were established in 1914 when the two British protectorates of Northern Nigeria and Southern Nigeria were merged to form the colony and protectorate of Nigeria. On 1 October 1960, the country became independent, and in 1963, a new constitution made the transition to a republic.[9] At the time of independence, Nigeria was divided into three major regions - the Eastern, Western and Northern regions. In 1963, the Western Region was divided and a new region - the Midwest Region - was created.[10]\n\nThe first decades after independence were characterised by several government overthrows, starting with the military coup in 1966 and the civil war of 1967-1970, which broke out after the eastern region declared itself independent under the name \"Republic of Biafra\". Further military rule from 1983 ended in 1999 with the return to civilian rule.[11]\n\nNigeria is currently divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, which are grouped into six geopolitical zones (South-West, South-South, South-East, North-West, North-Central and North-East). The states are further divided into 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs), each of which is governed by a council responsible for the provision of basic services and receives monthly payments from a national federation account for this purpose.[12] A map showing the current federal states (as of 2015) can be viewed here.\n\n2. Ethnic and religious groups\n\nThe three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria are the Hausa living in the north of the country, the Yoruba living in the west and the Igbo in the east.[13] According to 2018 estimates, around 30 per cent of the population are Hausa, 15.5 per cent Yoruba and 15.2 per cent Igbo (also known as Ibo). Smaller groups include Fulani (6 per cent), Tiv (2.4 per cent), Kanuri/Beriberi (2.4 per cent), Ibibio (1.8 per cent) and Ijaw/Izon (1.8 per cent). 24.9 per cent of the population belong to other ethnic groups.[14]\n\nHausa and Fulani have integrated into a common group over time and are predominantly Muslim. Fulani living in the city enter into inter-ethnic marriages and speak Hausa, while Fulani living in the countryside as pastoralists generally marry within their own group and speak Fulani. The greatest diversity of ethnic groups - more than 180 - is found in the so-called Middle Belt of Nigeria, with the Tiv and the Nupe as the largest ethnic groups in this region. [15]The term Middle Belt refers to North-Central Nigeria and includes the states of Benue, Plateau, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Kwara and the Federal Capital Territory. The population living here is predominantly Christian, but there is a significant Muslim population .[16]\n\nEnglish is the official national language; the indigenous languages Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Fula as well as Pidgin English are widely spoken. Hausa is the most widely spoken language in the country,[17] and is also the language of the Sharia courts in northern Nigeria.[18] The constitution states in Article 55 that the business of the National Assembly shall be conducted in English, but also in Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba if adequate provision has been made for this.[19] The National Education Guidelines of 2013 also contain provisions on the use of national languages as languages of instruction.[20]\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the Pew Research Centre in 2015, 49.3 percent of the population nationwide are Christian and 48.8 percent are Muslim (as of 2010). Just under 2 per cent belong to another religious community or none at all.[21] In another survey from 2010, 38 per cent of Muslims described themselves as Sunni and 12 per cent as Shiite; 42 per cent identified themselves as \"just a Muslim\". Of the Christians surveyed, around 37 per cent were Catholic and around 60 per cent belonged to a Protestant church.[22] Islam dominates in the North-West and North-East geopolitical zones, Christianity in the Southern zones. In the North-Central zone, the proportion of Muslims and Christians is roughly equal. However, there is no clear geographical division between the religious groups: Christians also live in the regions dominated by Islam, and conversely there are Muslim populations in the southern regions, which are predominantly inhabited by Christians.[23] The constitution (Article 10) prohibits the introduction of a state religion at national or federal level and guarantees individual freedom of religion, including the right to change religion or belief (Article 38).[24]\n\nIn October 1999, the state of Zamfara was the first to introduce Sharia law. Eleven other states[25] with a majority Muslim population, including the states of Kano and Kaduna, followed suit, despite protests from Christians. Clashes broke out in which several thousand people, both Christian and Muslim, died.[26] According to a report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), although non-Muslims are not subject to Sharia criminal laws, they are already subject to some Islamic authorities, such as the censorship authority in Kano state or the Hisbah, an authority responsible for enforcing Sharia law. This is particularly evident in the enforcement of the ban on the sale of alcohol in the state, but there are also reports of discrimination regarding access to land. Not only Christians, but also Shiites and atheists are affected by discrimination.[27] Conversely, Muslims in Christian-dominated regions and followers of traditional religions also report experiences of discrimination .[28] See also the overview of laws on Nigeria compiled by ACCORD.\n\n3. Political situation - #EndSARS protests & elections\n\nIn October 2020, there were nationwide protests against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a special police unit accused of widespread human rights violations. The unit was disbanded by President Buhari a few days after the protests began, but the protests continued.[29] The protests, which became known under the hashtag EndSARS and took place between 7 and 20 October 2020 in the states of Ogun, Oyo and Lagos as well as in Abuja, were violently suppressed by security forces. Firearms, water cannons and tear gas were used at close range.[30] An investigation by Amnesty International (AI) showed that 12 people were killed by the Nigerian army and police during the protests in Lagos on 20 October 2020. Detained protesters were also tortured and denied immediate access to a lawyer.[31]\n\nFurther information on the #EndSARS protests can be found in the following response to the enquiry:\n\nACCORD - Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation: Query response on Nigeria: End-SARS protests in Lagos (timing, armed clashes, situation of participants and organisers) [a-11918], 3 August 2022\n\nhttps://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2078848.html\n\nAs well as in this featured topic (that is no longer updated):\n\nACCORD - Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation: ecoi.net featured topic on Nigeria: Security Situation, 21 December 2021\n\nhttps://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2106381.html\n\nAfter the protests ended, the federal government set up judicial commissions of enquiry to investigate reports of police violence, including killings. Their work came to a halt after some of the victims received compensation payments.[32] Of those arrested during the protests, at least 15 people were still in custody three years later, in October 2023.[33] (â ecoi.net search for #EndSARS)\n\nPresidential and National Assembly elections were held in Nigeria in February 2023, followed by gubernatorial and state assembly elections on 18 March. The elections reportedly took place against the backdrop of a difficult security situation, rising poverty, fuel and cash shortages. The latter was caused by the fact that the central bank had announced the issue of new banknotes at the end of 2022, but these were not available in sufficient quantities.[34] This also led to protests and social unrest.[35] In the presidential elections, Bola Tinubu, candidate of the previously ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), emerged as the narrow winner with 36.61 per cent of the vote.[36] The electoral law stipulates that the presidential election is won by the candidate who (i) receives the most votes and (ii) receives at least 25 per cent of the votes in at least 24 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Only if no candidate fulfils this requirement will there be a run-off between the candidates with the most or second most votes.[37] Bola Tinubu received at least 25 per cent of the votes in 27 federal states and was therefore the only candidate to fulfil both requirements for an election victory.[38] The election process was accompanied by problems, polling stations opened late and the election results were not published in real time during the first phase of counting, as promised by the electoral authorities. According to the final report of the EU Election Observation Mission, there was a \"critical failure of the entire election process\" during the evaluation. When the election results were announced, a quarter of the forms could not yet be found on the electoral authority's electronic platform and a significant proportion of the documents that could already be viewed were illegible.[39] In addition, voter turnout was at a \"record low\" of just 27 per cent.[40] The two losing candidates - Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Peter Obi of the Labour Party - had challenged the results of the presidential election in court. However, their appeals were finally dismissed as unfounded by the Supreme Court in October 2023.[41]\n\nThe International Crisis Group points out that the presidential election in February 2023 exposed existing ethnic and religious fault lines: Particularly in Lagos State, ethnic tensions had arisen between Yoruba, who supported Bola Tinubu, and supporters of Peter Obi, an Igbo. Peter Obi would have been the first Igbo president since 1966. The feeling of continued political exclusion and tensions with other ethnic groups could strengthen support for the call for an independent Biafra among the large Igbo population in the south-east and intensify separatist endeavours. In addition, many Christian groups rejected the election result after not only another Muslim was elected president, but Bola Tinubu also appointed a Muslim as vice president (instead of, according to unwritten rules, electing a Christian president after a Muslim president and appointing a vice president of the other denomination).[42]\n\nThe APC also received the most votes in the National Assembly elections and remains the strongest party in both chambers of parliament, albeit with fewer seats than in the last legislative period, ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party, the Labour Party and smaller parties.[43] (â ecoi.net search for the 2023 elections)\n\n4. Conflicts\n\nThe security situation in many parts of the country remains challenging, with the Islamist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the north-east, conflicts between herders and sedentary farmers in the north-west and north-central geopolitical zones, the separatist movement for an independent Biafra in the south-east and criminal groups in the Niger Delta. [44]\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP have been weakened by government military counter-offensives and internal rivalries, and more than 83,000 members and their families surrendered to the army between mid-2021 and the end of 2022. Nevertheless, the two groups remain active in the north-east, especially in the eastern part of Borno state. ISWAP has also expanded its activities into the north-west zone and parts of the north-central zone together with Ansaru, a splinter group of Boko Haram linked to Al-Qaeda. Criminal groups are also active in this region, attacking government security personnel and facilities,[45] but also kidnapping civilians for ransom, extorting protection money, looting or stealing livestock. In the last three months of 2022 alone, 1,090 kidnappings are said to have been recorded in Zamfara State, but a much higher number of unreported cases can be assumed. More than 100 gangs (in Nigeria, armed rural gangs that commit cattle rustling, looting, kidnapping and extortion in villages are called \"bandits\") are said to be active in the north-west.[46] In this region, the Middle Belt, there is also a long-standing conflict between sedentary farmers and nomadic pastoralists, which is basically about land use rights, but is increasingly linked to ethnic/religious identities - with mostly Christian farmers and Muslim Fulani pastoralists.[47] However, there are indications of links between Boko Haram and shepherdess militias.[48] (â ecoi.net search Herder) (âecoi.net search Boko Haram)\n\nIn the south-east, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, are fighting for an independent Biafra that would encompass the South-East geopolitical zone and parts of the South-South zone. Since 2021, there have been numerous attacks on government security personnel and facilities for which these two groups are blamed. IPOB rejects these allegations and states that it is only taking action against Fulani herdswomen and criminal groups.[49] (âecoi.net search Biafra)\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] CIA - Central Intelligence Agency: The World Fact Book - Nigeria, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/nigeria/\n\n[2] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - Country, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria#ref55281\n\n[3] BBC: Nigeria country profile, 28 July 2023, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13949550\n\n[4] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - Introduction & Quick Facts, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria\n\n[5] ITA - International Trade Administration: Nigeria - Country Commercial Guide: Market Overview, last update 5 June 2023, https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/nigeria-market-overview\n\n[6] DW - Deutsche Welle: Nigeria: Will ending fuel subsidies boost the economy?, 6 July 2023, https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-will-ending-fuel-subsidies-boost-the-economy/a-64668321\n\n[7] Merkur.de: Nigeria: Geschichte, Politik, BevÃ¶lkerung und Geografie, 9 September 2022, https://www.merkur.de/welt/nigeria-geschichte-politik-bevoelkerung-und-geografie-91782803.html\n\n[8] Merkur.de: Nigeria: Geschichte, Politik, BevÃ¶lkerung und Geografie, 9 September 2022, https://www.merkur.de/welt/nigeria-geschichte-politik-bevoelkerung-und-geografie-91782803.html\n\n[9] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - Introduction & Quick Facts, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria\n\n[10] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - Government and Society, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria/Government-and-society\n\n[11] BBC: Nigeria country profile, 28 July 2023, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13949550\n\n[12] Nigerian Embassy Germany: Ãber Nigeria â Regierung und Politik, 29 April 2019, https://nigeriaembassygermany.org/regierung---politik.htm\n\n[13] BBC: Nigeria country profile, 28 July 2023, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13949550\n\n[14] CIA - Central Intelligence Agency: World Factbook - Nigeria, last update 17 January 2024, https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/nigeria/#people-and-society\n\n[15] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - People, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria/Climate#ref55288\n\n[16] The Conversation: Violence is endemic in north central Nigeria: what communities are doing to cope, 23 June 2021, https://theconversation.com/violence-is-endemic-in-north-central-nigeria-what-communities-are-doing-to-cope-157349\n\n[17] Encyclopaedia Britannica: Nigeria - People, last updated 17 January 2024, https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria/Languages\n\n[18] USCIRF - United States Commission on International Religious Freedom: Shari'ah Criminal Law in Northern Nigeria, December 2019, https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/2024440/USCIRF_ShariahLawinNigeria_report_120919+v3R.pdf, p. 5\n\n[19] Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, 29 May 1999, http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm\n\n[20] USAID: Language of Instruction Country Profile: Nigeria, April 2021, https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00XH27.pdf, p. 6;
