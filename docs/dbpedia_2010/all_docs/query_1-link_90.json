        "text": "Framework Addendum – March 2021\n\nThe State Water Board DDW staff has prepared an Addendum to the Framework, which consists of an early draft of the anticipated criteria for direct potable reuse that was developed using information from the recommended DPR research as required by section 13561.2 of the Water Code. The State Water Board is seeking public comment, and soliciting stakeholder input from water agencies, wastewater agencies, local public health officers, environmental organizations, environmental justice organizations, public health nongovernmental organizations, and the business community as required by section 13561.2(a)(1).\n\nDownload the Framework Addendum (PDF)\n\nPublic Comments\n\nState Water Board staff is seeking feedback from the public and interested parties on the addendum to the Framework (Framework Addendum). Written public comments will be accepted during the public comment period. DDW staff will review all comments received but may not be able to provide an individualized detailed response. The State Water Board will provide an opportunity for the public to present oral comments at a public workshop. Information on the workshop will be provided in a separate notice.\n\nPublic Comment Period\n\n22 March 2021 – 25 June 2021\n\nDDW staff received a total of 21 comment letters by June 25, 2021. To request electronic copies of the comment letters, please send an email to DDWrecycledwater@waterboards.ca.gov.\n\nDownload the Notice of Public Comment Period (PDF)\n\nCommenters Submitted by IDEXX Jody Frymire Self Sheryl Hamlin Self Paul Beswick Agua Via Ltd Brian Allum University of New Mexico Kerry Howe Vallecitos Water District James Gumpel Irvine Ranch Water District Paul Cook CA-NV AWWA Sue Mosburg Inland Empire Utilities Agency Shivaji Deshmukh San Diego County Water Authority Kelley Gage WateReuse CA, ACWA, CA-NV AWWA, CUWA, CASA Jennifer West et al City of Santa Monica Sunny Wang Metropolitan Water District & LA County Sanitation Districts Mickey Chaudhuri & Martha Tremblay City of San Diego John Stufflebean Golden State Water Company Sunil Pillai California Coastkeeper Alliance Sean Bothwell Valley Water Rick Callender City of Los Angeles (LASAN and LADWP) Traci Minamide & Richard Harasick Danielson Applied Consultants LTD Richard Danielson Citizens Coalition for a Safe Community, Sierra Club CA Angeles Chapter Tom Williams Orange County Water District Michael Markus\n\nStaff Workshop\n\nState Water Board DDW staff held an online public workshop in April 2021 to provide an opportunity for the public to present oral comments on the Addendum.\n\nDownload the Workshop Notice (PDF).\n\nRecorded video of the Workshop (presentations start at the 00:03:40 minute mark, public comments start at the 1:10:00 minute mark).\n\nResearch to Support Criteria Development for Direct Potable Reuse\n\nThe State Water Board is coordinating with the Water Research Foundation (WRF) to provide scope and direction, provide technical review, and oversee the completion of five research projects by scientific and technical experts convened by WRF. Completion of the research is expected by March 2021. Funding is provided by Proposition 1.\n\nDPR-1 Probabilistic Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA)\n\nThis research project is to conduct a literature review on QMRA, develop a QMRA tool, and develop a guidance document on how to evaluate data inputs and assumptions, how to review and evaluate QMRA assumptions and their outputs, and how to use the QMRA tool. The State Water Board DDW will consider probabilistic QMRA to assist in developing required pathogen log removal values as part of criteria development for DPR. The QMRA tool is anticipated to enable assessment of the performance of DPR treatment trains, provide an opportunity to identify additional effective DPR treatment trains, and contribute to the development of DPR criteria that further ensure that public health protection is paramount in DPR projects. Building a robust library of treatment plant performance data for a probabilistic assessment of treatment plant performance would be a benefit to further use of the QMRA tool.\n\nWRF project website for DPR-1\n\nThe QRMA tool, DPRisk, is a Shiny web-based application, available at cawaterdatadive.shinyapps.io/DPRisk.\n\nDPR-2 Conduct Pathogen Monitoring of Wastewater\n\nThis research project is to conduct pathogen monitoring in wastewater in order to gather more information on their concentrations and variability, and to provide additional pathogen data for the QMRA and other evaluations. The research project includes a literature review of previous pathogen monitoring studies and analytical methods used, an evaluation of the pathogens that are appropriate for monitoring, and identification of analytical methods that could be used. The research team developed a quality assurance project plan that describes the sampling plan for five participating wastewater treatment plants, describes analytical method optimization, and provides the analytical method standard operating procedures (SOPs) based on the method optimization work for wastewater matrices. The sampling campaign began in October 2019 and will continue through January 2021. In March 2020, the State Water Board DDW approved expanded sampling to include SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The research team updated the SOPs for processing and enumerating viruses in wastewater to add procedures for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWRF project website for DPR-2\n\nDPR-3 Feasibility of Collecting Pathogen Data in Wastewater During Outbreaks of Disease\n\nThis research is to investigate the feasibility of collecting raw wastewater pathogen concentration data associated with community outbreaks of disease. This research is important because pathogen concentrations in wastewater may increase significantly during disease outbreaks in the community, and the QMRA and other public health-focused evaluations must consider the full range of pathogen concentrations possible in wastewater, in order to accurately characterize the infection risk and ensure sufficient advanced water treatment is provided to protect public health. This research includes a literature review of disease outbreak monitoring and surveillance programs. The research team will investigate possible metrics that could be used to indicate outbreaks of disease, recommend what partnerships should be established or reinforced for DPR, what communications protocols are needed, and what pathogen monitoring plans could look like, in order to capture peak pathogen concentration data during outbreaks of disease.\n\nWRF project website for DPR-3\n\nDPR-4 Addressing Chemical Peaks in DPR\n\nThis research will identify suitable options for additional treatment processes that can provide some “averaging” with respect to potential chemical peaks, that is, rapid, short-lived increases in concentration, particularly for chemical contaminants that have the potential to persist through advanced water treatment. The research includes a literature review on the types and frequency of chemical peaks observed, characterization of chemical peaks (sizes and shapes of chemical peaks), and options for treatment. The research also includes small study to better understand whether online total organic carbon analyzers can detect the types of chemical peaks that persist through advanced water treatment.\n\nWRF project website for DPR-4\n\nDPR-5 Non-Target Analysis\n\nThis research is to evaluate potential analytical methods that can be used to assess unknown chemical contaminants, such as non-targeted analysis (NTA), to identify contaminants not presently detected by current monitoring approaches, particularly low molecular weight compounds that may occur in wastewater and may not be removed by advanced water treatment. The limited DPR-5 budget only allowed for completion of a White Paper that describes several analytical methods that may be applicable to NTA to address the knowledge gap in assessment of unknown chemical contaminants. In addition, the White Paper proposed a $1.2 million, five-year research plan to fully evaluate the analytical methods. The plan would include completing the scope of the research by evaluating the methods described in the White Paper, identifying the most appropriate methods for analysis of non-targeted low molecular weight compounds, developing standard operating procedures (SOP) for those methods, including quality assurance/quality control provisions, and validating the methods with a broad spectrum of commercial and municipal laboratories.\n\nThe DPR Feasibility Report to the Legislature indicates that the recommended research, including DPR-5, \"must be addressed in order to be able to successfully adopt a set of uniform water recycling criteria for DPR.\" However, the State Water Board is also statutorily mandated on or before December 31, 2023, to adopt uniform water recycling criteria for direct potable reuse through raw water augmentation. State Water Board DDW is confident that this statutory deadline can be achieved through conservative regulatory requirements that minimize the potential health risks associated with low molecular weight compounds while concurrently pursuing funding and completion of the next phase of the research.\n\nWRF project website for DPR-5\n\nWRF Presentations at Conferences and Webcasts\n\nWRF has held panel discussions with the DPR research teams at the WateReuse California annual spring conferences and at WateReuse annual fall symposiums over the last three years, which were held throughout the state (Monterey, Garden Grove, San Diego, and virtually in 2020). Additionally, WRF and the DPR research teams participated in two webcasts held to provide updates on the DPR research projects. Links to the presentation slides for these webcasts are provided below.\n\nJune 12, 2020 WRF DPR Virtual Research Workshop – presentation slides\n\nNovember 7, 2019 Water Environment Federation Webcast - Research to Ensure Sound Potable Reuse Regulations: CA Water Board Partners with The Water Research Foundation"
