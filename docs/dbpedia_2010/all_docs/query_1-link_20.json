They are typically due no later than 90 days before the end of the current reporting budget period of a project.\n\nAnnual project reports cover that year's activities related to the funded project as well as broader impacts work which may not be intrinsic to the research.\n\nFor reporting timeline specifics and other information about the annual reporting process refer to PAPPG VII.D.1.a.\n\nAnnual project reports must be submitted in Research.gov.\n\nYour final annual project report should only refer to the final funded year of your project â€” it is not a cumulative report. It is due no later than 120 days following the end date of your NSF award.\n\nThe guidelines in PAPPG VII.D.1.b outline what should be included, as well as the timeline for submitting your final annual project report.\n\nFinal annual project reports must be submitted in Research.gov.\n\nThis report serves as a summary of no more than 800 words on the nature and outcomes of your project, written for a public audience. It is due no later than 120 days following the end date of your NSF award.\n\nThis report will be posted publicly by NSF exactly as it is submitted. It should not contain confidential or proprietary information.\n\nFull details of what should be included in your project outcomes report and when it should be submitted can be found in PAPPG VII.D.2.\n\nProject outcomes reports must be submitted in Research.gov."
