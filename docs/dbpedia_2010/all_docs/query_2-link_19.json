        "text": "For each type of source in this guide, both the general form and an example will be provided.\n\nThe following format will be used:\n\nIn-Text Citation (Paraphrase) - entry that appears in the body of your paper when you express the ideas of a researcher or author using your own words. For more tips on paraphrasing check out The OWL at Purdue.\n\nIn-Text Citation (Quotation) - entry that appears in the body of your paper after a direct quote.\n\nReferences - entry that appears at the end of your paper.\n\nInformation on citing and several of the examples were drawn from the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).\n\nAPA Citation Style does not have a separate category for government publications. According to APA, government documents can be considered Books, Technical/Research Reports or Brochures.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n\nTreat a government document as a book, report, or brochure.\n\nIf a person is named on the title page, use her or him as author.\n\nIf no person is named, use the government agency, department, or branch as a group author.\n\nGive the name of the group author exactly as it appears on the title page. If the branch or agency is not well known, include its higher department first.\n\nIf the group author is also the publisher, just use the word Author after the location.\n\nIf there is a series or report number, include it after the title.\n\nThe manual refers to the GPO (U.S. Gov. Printing Office). Canadian equivalents may be: Queenâ€™s Printer, Ministry of Supply and Services, Canadian Government Publishing, etc.\n\nGeneral Format\n\nIn-Text Citation (Paraphrase):\n\n(Author Surname OR Name of Government Organization, Year)\n\nIn-Text Citation (Quotation):\n\n(Author Surname OR Name of Government Organization, Year, page number)\n\nReferences:\n\nAuthor Surname, First Initial. Second Initial. OR Government Name. Name of Government Agency. (Year). Title: Subtitle (Report No. xxx [if available]).
