        "text": "No. Form I-94 and Form I-20 do not establish employment authorization for reverification in the case of F-1 students seeking employment under optional practical training (OPT), STEM OPT extension, or off-campus employment based on severe economic hardship. If employment authorization is granted in these cases, USCIS issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as evidence of employment authorization.\n\nThe student’s expired OPT EAD, together with an endorsed Form I-20, are considered an acceptable List A document for a student who is participating in OPT and whose F-1 status and employment authorization have been automatically extended as a result of a timely filed H-1B change of status petition (cap-gap).\n\nAn expired OPT EAD with an endorsed Form I-20 is also an acceptable List A document in the case of the F-1 OPT student with a pending STEM extension application. The student is authorized to work until USCIS makes a decision on their application, but not more than 180 days from the date of the initial OPT EAD expiration date.\n\nFor more guidance on reverification and F-1 STEM OPT extensions and cap-gap for students, see the Guidance for Completing Form I-9 Handbook (PDF).\n\nForm I-9 regulations allow employers to choose whether to keep copies of documents employees submit to complete their Form I-9. Therefore, you may choose to begin or end the practice of keeping copies of documents at any time, as long as you do so for all employees, regardless of national origin or citizenship status, or you may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nDo not shred previously retained copies of documents. DHS regulations state that once you make copies of documents, you must retain them with the Forms I-9 or store them with the employee's records.\n\nAdditionally, if you use an alternative procedure to remotely examine documents, you must retain copies of the front and back (if two-sided) of the documentation the employee presents to verify their identify and work authorization.\n\nYou may accept a document with a different name than the name entered in Section 1 provided that you resolve the question of whether the document reasonably relates to the employee. You also may wish to attach a brief memo to Form I-9 stating the reason for the name discrepancy, along with any supporting documentation the employee provides. An employee may provide documentation to support their name change, but is not required to do so. If, however, you determine that the document with a different name does not reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the employee, you may ask that they provide other documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents on Form I-9.\n\nA refugee may choose to present any applicable documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents. DHS provides refugees electronic or paper Forms I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, as evidence of their status and employment authorization. A refugee's electronic Form I-94 contains the admission code of \"RE\" and a paper Form I-94 has a refugee admission stamp. A refugee may use their unexpired Form I-94 as a receipt for a document establishing both employment authorization and identity for 90 days. After issuance of Form I-94, USCIS will process an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) for a refugee. If an employee presented a Form I-94 with an unexpired refugee admission stamp as a receipt, before the end of 90 days, the employee must present either an Employment Authorization Document or a combination of a List B document and an unrestricted Social Security card.\n\nA refugee's Department of State-issued Transportation Boarding Letter is an acceptable List B #2 identity document if it contains a photograph or identifying information (name, date of birth, gender, height, eye color and address) and appears to be genuine and to relate to the person presenting it.\n\nAn employer may not correct errors or omissions in Section 1. If an employer discovers an error or omission in Section 1 of an employee’s Form I-9, the employer should ask the employee to correct the error. The best way to correct the error is to have the employee:\n\nDraw a line through the incorrect information;\n\nEnter the correct or omitted information; and\n\nInitial and date the correction or omitted information.\n\nEmployees needing assistance to correct or enter omitted information in Section 1 can have a preparer and/or translator help with the correction or omitted information. The preparer or translator should:\n\nMake the correction or note the omitted information or help the employee make the correction or note the omitted information. The employee or preparer or translator should draw a line through the incorrect information and enter the correct information or note the omitted information;\n\nHave the employee initial and date the correction or omitted information if able; and\n\nInitial and date the correction or omitted information next to the employee’s initials.\n\nIf the preparer and/or translator who helped with a correction or noted omitted information completed a certification block of Supplement A, Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1 when the employee initially completed the Form I-9, they should not complete the certification block again.\n\nIf the preparer and/or translator did not previously complete a certification block, they should:\n\nComplete a new certification block in Supplement A, Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1.\n\nIf the employee is no longer working for the employer, the employer should attach to the existing form a signed and dated statement identifying the error or omission and explaining why corrections could not be made (e.g., because the employee no longer works for the employer).\n\nAn employer may only correct errors made in Section 2 or Supplement B of the Form I-9. The best way to correct the form is to:\n\nDraw a line through the incorrect information;\n\nEnter the correct or omitted information; and\n\nInitial and date the correction or omitted information.\n\nAn employer should not conceal any changes made on the Form I-9—for example, by erasing text or using correction fluid, nor should the employer backdate the Form I-9. An employer that made multiple errors in Section 2 or Supplement B of the form may redo the section(s) containing the errors on a new Form I-9, and attach it to the previously completed form. An employer should attach an explanation of the changes made to an existing Form I-9 or the reason a new Form I-9 was completed, and sign and date the explanation."
