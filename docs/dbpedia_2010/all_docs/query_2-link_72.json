We’ve been using CP’s content for over 50 years and without it, we wouldn’t be able to fill our newspaper. Their wide reach offers a variety of in-depth content, from elections and disasters to NHL, recipes and entertainment.”\n\nGuy Bertrand, Managing Editor at Trail Daily Times\n\n“Our newsfeed subscription with The Canadian Press is essential to our digital news and lifestyle site, especially for breaking news. For a fraction of the price of hiring a full-time reporter, I get a staff of full-time reporters. What we get from CP is incredibly valuable. It’s one piece to the puzzle that’s a perfect fit.”\n\nBob Kronbauer, Editor-in-Chief at Vancouver is Awesome\n\n“Thanks to The Canadian Press’ photography and videography experience, they quickly understand what I’m looking for without a lot of explaining or hand-holding. That’s very valuable to me. Plus, their people are always delightful to deal with and their whole process is very smooth from start to finish.”\n\nCarla Hindman, Head of Corporate Communications & Financial Education at VISA\n\n“Having The Canadian Press news and photos front and centre on our website adds value by letting our members know what’s going in Canadian golf in English and French. It’s the perfect tool for timely news when you need to get updates posted quickly and their customer service is fantastic.”\n\nTyler Costigan, Manager, Corporate Communications & Social Media at Golf Canada"
