        "text": "COVID-19 Therapeutics Program Background\n\nThis guide is intended to provide direction as the U.S. government (USG) prepares to wind down the current distribution of USG-procured COVID-19 therapeutics and transitions the COVID-19 oral antiviral (OAV) treatments (nirmatrelvir packaged with ritonavir [Paxlovid] and molnupiravir [Lagevrio]) to the commercial market. This guide aims to help jurisdictions and providers (1) plan for the transition away from USG ordering; (2) understand the impact of this transition on ordering mechanism; (3) understand how to manage inventory of USG-distributed OAV products, including continued reporting requirements for remaining USG inventory; and (4) provide summary information about programs to provide access for uninsured and underinsured individuals as COVID-19 OAVs become commercially available. This guide is for planning purposes only and will be updated as additional details become available.\n\nCOVID-19 Treatments Transition\n\nThe following summary table provides a sequence of events based on OAV manufacturers' commercialization plans.\n\nProjected Timeline\n\n(All subject to change) Action/Event Product 10/2/2023 HHS switched Lagevrio threshold/replenishment to a request-based approach using an out-of-cycle (OOC) process. Lagevrio 11/1/2023 Commercial Lagevrio launch by Merck (unique NDC relative to USG-procured supply). Lagevrio available for purchase. Lagevrio 11/1/2023 Commercial Paxlovid launch by Pfizer, NDA-labeled, unique NDC relative to EUA-labeled, USG-procured supply. Paxlovid available for purchase. Paxlovid (standard and reduced dose packaging) 11/10/2023, 3:00 PM ET Last day for awardees to submit orders for Lagevrio USG product. (Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA], Department of State [DoS], Indian Health Service [IHS], Peace Corps [PC], Bureau of Prisons [BOP], Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE], and the National Institutes of Health [NIH], can continue to order USG supply.) Lagevrio 11/27/2023 HHS switched from the Paxlovid threshold/replenishment to a request-based approach using an OOC request process. Thresholds for all entities were set to zero. Jurisdictions, federal entities, and other partners can order additional Paxlovid supply from USG by submitting an OOC request. Paxlovid (standard and reduced dose packaging) 12/15/2023, 3:00 PM ET Last day for awardees to submit orders for Paxlovid USG product. OOC orders are made against OOC requests. Because OOC requests require up to 48 hours to process, requests should be submitted 48 hours ahead of time so that orders can be placed by 3:00 PM ET Dec. 15.\n\n(HRSA, DoS, IHS, PC, BOP, ICE, NIH, Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of Defense (DoD) can continue to order USG supply.) Paxlovid (standard and reduced dose packaging) 12/15/2023 Ordering paused for Lagevrio for HRSA, DoS, IHS, PC, BOP, ICE, and NIH to determine thresholds based on remaining USG inventory. Lagevrio 11/15/2023 – 2/29/2024 Providers with excess USG-distributed, EUA-labeled Paxlovid are encouraged to return product through the Pfizer returns process to facilitate a credit to USG. All returns should be initiated mid-February 2024, to ensure the product is received by February 29, 2024. Paxlovid (standard and reduced dose packaging) 01/08/2024 Lagevrio ordering reopened for HRSA, DoS, IHS, PC, BOP, ICE, and NIH until USG supply is depleted or expires in early 2025. Lagevrio 03/09/2024 EUA-labeled Paxlovid is no longer authorized for emergency use after March 8, 2024. All EUA-labeled Paxlovid must be returned by March 15, 2024, or disposed. The Paxlovid EUA continues to authorize use of the NDA-labeled Paxlovid for eligible pediatric patients.\n\nOrdering and Distribution Timelines\n\nLagevrio (molnupiravir)\n\nUSG stopped the traditional threshold/replenishment ordering mechanism for Lagevrio on October 2, 2023, by setting ordering thresholds to zero for all awardees.\n\nUSG closed ordering for Lagevrio for all jurisdictions, pharmacy, and other partners on November 10, 2023, at 3:00 PM ET. Federal entities, other than DoD and VA, can continue to order USG supply beyond November 10. Jurisdictions and other partners should work with their providers/sites to deplete the USG supply in the field and replace inventory with commercial supply as needed.\n\nIMPORTANT On November 1, 2023, Lagevrio commercial product became available for purchase through commercial channels. Partners should manage USG product and the commercial product, with the following expectations:\n\nUSG distributed product inventory should be used until it is depleted or expires or is no longer usable, whichever comes first.\n\nUSG distributed product shall continue to be dispensed at no cost to patient.\n\nUSG distributed product cannot be returned unless expired (first expiry is February 2024); please refer to searchable database to determine product expiry: COVID-19 Therapeutic Product Expiration (hhs.gov).\n\nExpired product can be disposed of on site in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations or returned. For sites that do not have an established returns process, visit www.merckorders.com and select “Return Merchandise” or call the Merck Order Management Center at 800-MERCK-RX (800-637-2579).\n\nReporting of USG inventory is required until all delivered product is reconciled for the provider site/central awardee.\n\nThe Merck Patient Assistance Program (a 501c3 Foundation) provides Lagevrio free of charge to eligible patients who, without assistance, could not otherwise afford the product.\n\nMerck is also operating a Lagevrio Co-Pay Savings Program. Through this program, eligible privately insured patients may save on their out-of-pocket costs for their prescriptions for Lagevrio.\n\nLagevrio NDC USG-distributed Lagevrio (EUA) 0006-5055-06 Commercial Lagevrio (EUA) 0006-5055-09\n\nPaxlovid (nirmatrelvir packaged with ritonavir; standard and reduced dose packaging)\n\nUSG stopped the traditional threshold/replenishment ordering mechanism for Paxlovid products (standard and reduced dose packaging) on November 27, 2023, by setting ordering thresholds to zero for all awardees.\n\nProviders were encouraged to place necessary orders prior to the cutoff date of November 27, 2023. If a provider required additional supply to be responsive to demand after USG transitioned away from that mechanism, Paxlovid continued to be available for ordering via the already established OOC request process until December 15, 2023. Requests received after November 27, 2023, were processed as they were received.\n\nUSG closed ordering for Paxlovid products (standard and reduced dose packaging) for all jurisdiction, pharmacy, and other partners on December 15, 2023, at 3:00 PM ET. Federal entities can continue to order USG product beyond December 2023.\n\nIMPORTANT On November 1, 2023, Paxlovid commercial NDA-labeled dose packs became available for purchase through commercial channels. Partners should manage USG EUA-labeled Paxlovid packaging and the commercial NDA-labeled packaging with the following expectations:\n\nTo ensure maximum value of the USG-purchased inventory, sites were encouraged to return EUA-labeled Paxlovid. As of November 15, 2023, USG-distributed, EUA-labeled product with an expiration date of December 2023 or later became eligible to be returned via the Pfizer return process. Returns were accepted through February 29, 2024. All returns needed be initiated by mid-February 2024 to ensure the product was received by February 29, 2024, to be accepted for credit to the federal inventory.\n\nThe EUA-labeled Paxlovid was only authorized for use through March 8, 2024. All EUA-labeled Paxlovid must be disposed of or returned, regardless of the expiration date. Product can be disposed of on site in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations or returned for disposal. If your site does not have a standard pathway for product returns, please visit Inmar at https://returns.healthcare.inmar.com for returns information.\n\nFor each course of EUA-labeled Paxlovid with an expiration date of December 2023 or later that was returned and received by Pfizer by February 29, 2024, Pfizer provided the USG with a credit for an NDA-labeled course. A similar \"refresh/replenishment\" was completed for all USG inventory that had not yet been distributed.\n\nThese \"refreshed\" courses now supply a USG PAP operated by Pfizer and to supply federal entities.\n\nThis \"refreshed\" inventory includes all current formulations of Paxlovid and will bring in any upcoming formulations that may be developed by Pfizer and authorized or approved by FDA. This will ensure that individuals receiving Paxlovid under the USG PAP operated by Pfizer will have access to the same formulations of Paxlovid available outside of the USG PAP operated by Pfizer.\n\nUSG PAP operated by Pfizer is available for eligible patients (Note: Additional information on this program and the Paxlovid Co-Pay Savings Program can be found on Pfizer's Paxlovid website):\n\nThrough December 31, 2024, individuals covered under federal programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and uninsured patients are eligible for the USG PAP operated by Pfizer and can receive Paxlovid at no cost. Health care providers and dispensing locations can provide information to patients regarding eligibility and how eligible patients can enroll in the PAP to obtain free product. Through this program, participating dispensing sites will be reimbursed for any product dispensed, along with a dispensing fee. Retail pharmacies that would like to learn more about participating can contact the program vendor at PharmacyNetworkContract102101@assistrx.com.\n\nPfizer is also operating a Paxlovid Co-Pay Savings Program for eligible commercially insured patients.\n\nFederal entities can continue to order USG-procured treatment courses through the Health Partner Order Portal (HPOP) to provide free, USG-procured Paxlovid to their patients.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, a limited quantity of additional USG-procured Paxlovid may also be requested in Tiberius using the Request Paxlovid for Targeted Program request form to support state, local, tribal, or territorial special programs targeting vulnerable populations that are unable to access the product through the USG PAP. Any questions can be sent to COVID19.therapeutics@hhs.gov.\n\nAny distributed USG-procured, NDA-labeled supply must be dispensed at no cost to the patient. Please note that USG-procured, EUA-labeled Paxlovid is no longer authorized for use after March 8, 2024.\n\nReporting of USG inventory distributed to providers is required until all USG-delivered product is reconciled for the provider site/central awardee.\n\nPaxlovid NDC USG distributed Paxlovid (EUA-labeled)\n\nNote: EUA-labeled Paxlovid is no longer authorized for dispensing as of March 8, 2024 Carton: 0069-0345-30; 0069-1085-30; 0069-1101-20;\n\nBlister: 0069-1085-06; 0069-0345-06; 0069-1101-04 Commercial Paxlovid (NDA-labeled)\n\nNote: USG-procured Paxlovid distributed after December 15, 2023, will be NDA-labeled Paxlovid Carton: 0069-5321-30; 0069-5317-20;\n\nBlister: 0069-5321-03; 0069-5317-02\n\nGuidance on Inventory and Disposal Management\n\nProviders should use the following guidelines for their inventories of USG-distributed therapeutics:\n\nDisposal Management Guidelines USG Distributed Product Guideline Lagevrio USG product should be dispensed to patients until depletion or expiration, whichever comes first. Product cannot be returned/disposed of unless expired. First expiry is February 2024. (ASPR searchable expiry database). Once expired, product should be disposed of on site in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations or through the manufacturer's return process. To return to the manufacturer, visit www.merckorders.com and select “Return Merchandise” or call the Merck Order Management Center at 800-MERCK-RX (800-637-2579).\n\nAll disposal or returns of USG-distributed product need to be recorded in HPOP. Paxlovid (standard and reduced dose packaging) As of March 8, 2024, EUA-labeled product is no longer authorized for use. All remaining EUA-labeled Paxlovid, regardless of expiration date, must be disposed of on site in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations or returned for disposal. Sites that do not have disposal options can contact Pfizer’s returns vendor, Inmar https://returns.healthcare.inmar.com for more information about returns. All disposal or returns of USG-distributed product need to be recorded in HPOP.\n\nFor up-to-date information on expiration dates of all products: ASPR searchable expiry database.\n\nData Reporting Requirements\n\nIn accordance with the COVID-19 Therapeutics Provider Agreement, providers are responsible for adhering to all requirements outlined in the agreement until full reconciliation of USG-distributed product. Providers are expected to report all USG courses that they received and should report inventory, administration/dispensing, and disposal data until the provider’s USG product inventory is fully reconciled. USG supply used to support PAP programs are not subject to provider agreement reporting requirements.\n\nUSG has developed a mechanism for providers to report commercial treatment location data voluntarily that is now visible in an expanded treatments locator tool. As of November 27, sites can voluntarily upload commercially acquired inventory data for Paxlovid, Lagevrio, and outpatient Veklury via HPOP. HPOP users can leverage their existing accounts to note product availability, while non-HPOP users can use the HPOP volunteer reporting website. Sites only need to note that the product is available – not the number of treatment courses – once every 60 days, although more frequent updates provide more accurate information to patients and providers.\n\nSeparately, USG-distributed product should continue to be entered in the appropriate HPOP reporting fields.\n\nPatients and health care providers may use the ASPR Treatments Locator to search for sites with commercial COVID-19 therapeutics inventory in addition to remaining USG inventory and Paxlovid PAP sites. This website has replaced the Test to Treat and Therapeutics Locators.\n\nReimbursement and Programs for Uninsured and Underinsured Individuals\n\nIndividual programs will provide and manage assistance plans to ensure COVID-19 treatments will be available to uninsured and underinsured individuals once COVID-19 therapeutics transition to commercial availability.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, with an update on February 20, 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued Part D Coverage of Oral Antivirals for COVID-19 in the context of the transition of OAVs for COVID-19 to the commercial market. OAVs for COVID-19 that meet the statutory requirements at section 1860D-2(e) of the Social Security Act and are not otherwise excluded from coverage must be covered by Part D plans, either as a formulary product or through the formulary exception process consistent with 42 CFR §423.578(b). Consistent with the November 4, 2022, memorandum CMS continues to encourage Part D sponsors to add at least one OAV for COVID-19 that meets the definition of a Part D drug to their Contract Year 2024 formulary on a preferred or $0 cost-sharing tier, as available in the plan benefit structure."
