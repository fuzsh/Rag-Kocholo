        "text": "Independent expenditures\n\nIndividuals and groups may support or oppose candidates by making independent expenditures. An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate and which is not made in coordination with any campaign, candidate, political party committee, or with an agent of any campaign, candidate, or political party committee.\n\nIndependent expenditures are not subject to any contribution limits, but may be subject to reporting requirements. (The campaign of a candidate benefiting from an independent expenditure has no reporting obligation.) An independent expenditure must display a disclaimer notice.\n\nPersonal services\n\nAn individual may help candidates and committees by volunteering personal services. For example, a volunteer may want to take part in a voter drive or offer skills to a political committee. Volunteer services are not considered contributions as long as the volunteer is not paid by anyone. (If services are compensated by someone other than the committee itself, the payment is considered a contribution by that person to the committee.)\n\nA volunteer may spend unlimited money for normal living expenses.\n\nHome events\n\nIndividuals may use their homes and personal property for activities benefiting a candidate or political party without making a contribution. For instance, an individual might want to hold a fundraising party or reception in his or her home. Costs for invitations and for food and beverages served at the event are not considered contributions if they remain under certain limits. These expenses on behalf of a candidate are limited to $1,000 per election; expenses on behalf of a political party are limited to $2,000 per year. Any amount spent in excess of the limits is a contribution to the candidate or party committee.\n\nCorporate or union facilities\n\nIndividuals who are employees, stockholders or members of a corporation or labor union may use the organization's facilities—for example, the phone—in connection with personal volunteer activities, subject to the rules and practices of the organization. The activity, however, cannot prevent an employee from completing normal work, nor can it interfere with the organization's normal activity.\n\nIf volunteer activity exceeds \"incidental use\" of the facilities—one hour a week or four hours a month—a volunteer must reimburse the corporation or union the normal rental charge within a commercially reasonable time. If a volunteer uses the organization's equipment to produce campaign materials, reimbursement is required regardless of how much time is spent. Any reimbursement for use of facilities is considered a contribution from the individual to the political committee that benefits.\n\nAn uncompensated individual or group of individuals may engage in internet activities for the purpose of influencing a federal election without restriction.\n\nThis exemption applies to individuals acting with or without the knowledge or consent of a campaign or a political party committee. Possible internet activities include, but are not limited to:\n\nSending or forwarding email\n\nProviding a hyperlink to a website\n\nCreating, maintaining or hosting a website and paying a nominal fee for the use of a website.\n\nPlease note that these exemptions apply regardless of whether the individual owns the computer he or she is using.\n\nUsing a work computer for online political activity\n\nPersonal use of computers and internet access is allowed, subject to the employer’s rules and so long as the individual is not compensated for the activity.\n\nSending personal emails regarding political topics or federal elections\n\nIndividuals may send unlimited emails on any political topic without identifying who they are or whether their messages have been authorized by any party or campaign committee.\n\nPosting comments to a blog in connection with a federal election\n\nUncompensated blogging, whether done by individuals or a group of individuals, incorporated or unincorporated, is exempt from regulation, even in those cases where a nominal fee is paid.\n\nPaying to place an ad on someone else’s website\n\nInternet communications placed on another person’s website, digital device, application or advertising platform for a fee are considered \"general public political advertising,\" and are thus \"public communications\" under the law. As such, these payments may result in contributions or expenditures. Other regulations regarding coordinated communications and disclaimer requirements would also apply. Refer to the previous section on public communications for more information."
