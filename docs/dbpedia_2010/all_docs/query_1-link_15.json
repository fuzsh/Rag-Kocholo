During the month of February, the NISRM is edited and assembled by the staff at the NICC, and on March 1st posted for publication and distribution. All proposed changes for a publication year, should be submitted by December 31st to make the annual March 1st posting date.\n\nThe process for suggesting modifications to the publication are submitted through the online form on this website and routed through one of the following for approval and submission to the NICC staff.\n\nYour Signatory Agency\n\nYour Geographic Area Coordination Center\n\nInteragency Organizations, Established Interagency Groups, and Functional Areas\n\nThe signatory agencies for NISRM are the following:\n\nUS Forest Service\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs\n\nBureau of Land Management\n\nNational Park Service\n\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nUS Fire Administration\n\nNational Association of State Foresters\n\nEntities that are considered a contracted resource can submit change requests through their sponsoring agency.
