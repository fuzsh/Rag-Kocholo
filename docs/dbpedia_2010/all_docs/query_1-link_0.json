        "text": "The Tongue & Quill has provided generations of Airmen a standardized format for Air Force documents such as Official Memorandums, Point Papers, Personal Letters, and many more. Standardized communication guidelines provided by the Tongue & Quill have improved the sharing of ideas, information, and messages with others by providing readers a familiar set of formats. The static format examples within the Tongue & Quill have been transformed into official digital templates which allow Airmen to focus on creating better Content; instead of creating the right Format. When an Airmen downloads an official template from this site, they can rest assured that they're starting with an approved format.\n\nAirmen successfully accomplish more missions with fewer people than ever before and there is a constant battle to cover the bases with limited resources. Time is a resource. In the context of Great Power Competition, every moment counts. These official templates will help give time back to Airmen and allow them to focus on the mission.\n\nTEMPLATES\n\nTemplate User Guide\n\nPersonal Letter Template_10nov2020\n\nOfficial Memorandum Template_10nov2020\n\nBackground Paper Template_10nov2020\n\nUSAF Official Bio Template_25March2024\n\nUSSF Official Bio Template_25March2024\n\nPosition Paper Template_10nov2020\n\nBullet Background Paper Template_10nov2020\n\nPoint Paper Template_10nov2020"
