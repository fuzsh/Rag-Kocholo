Prior to 2016, penalty adjustments were required every few years. However, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 required these adjustments on an annual basis, beginning in 2016. Similarly, but separately, EPA amends its penalty policies to account for inflation. Note that only the 2024 Penalty Inflation Adjustments and a portion of the 2013 Penalty Inflation Adjustments are in effect (as explained in Part II of the 2024 guidance); all other penalty adjustments have been superseded and are retained here for reference purposes.\n\n2024 Penalty Inflation Rule Adjustments\n\nAmendments to the EPA’s Civil Penalty Policies to Account for Inflation (effective January 15, 2024) and the Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Rule (pdf)\n\n2024 Revised Penalty Matrix for CERCLA § 106(b)(1) Civil Penalty Policy\n\n2024 Revised Penalty Matrix for RCRA § 7003 Civil Penalty Policy\n\n2023 Penalty Inflation Rule Adjustments\n\nCivil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Rule (01/06/2023)\n\n2022 Penalty Inflation Rule Adjustments\n\nCivil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Rule (01/15/2022)\n\nAmendments to EPA’s Civil Penalty Policies to Account for Inflation (effective January 15, 2022) and Transmittal of the 2022 Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Rule (pdf) (01/12/2022) - The 1/12/2022 memorandum that amended EPA’s penalty policies to account for inflation is no longer in effect.
