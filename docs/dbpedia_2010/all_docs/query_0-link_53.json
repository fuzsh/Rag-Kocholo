        "text": "2016 Request for Interest\n\nIn January 2016, BOEM received an unsolicited request for a commercial lease from Trident Winds LLC (Trident Winds). In order to determine competitive interest, BOEM published a notice in the Federal Register, \"Potential Commercial Lease for Wind Power on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Offshore California - Request for Interest (RFI)” in Docket No. BOEM-2016-0051 on August 18, 2016. Based on responses to the RFI, BOEM determined that competitive interest existed offshore California and BOEM and the State of California initiated the competitive planning and leasing process for possible future leasing for offshore wind development.\n\nTrident Winds LLC lease request (public version)\n\n2018 Call for Information and Nominations\n\nOn October 19, 2018, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a Call for Information and Nominations (Call) to obtain nominations from companies interested in commercial wind energy leases within the proposed areas off central and northern California. In addition to nominations, BOEM sought public input on the potential for wind energy development in the Call Areas. This includes site conditions, resources, and multiple uses in close proximity to, or within, the Call Areas that would be relevant to BOEM’s review of any nominations submitted, as well as BOEM’s subsequent decision whether to offer all or part of the Call Areas for commercial wind leasing.\n\nBelow are documents related to the 2018 Call:\n\nPublic Comments Received\n\nFederal Register Notice (October 19, 2018)\n\nDocket Number: BOEM-2018-0045\n\nNominations of Interest\n\n2018 Call Maps\n\nHumboldt Call Area\n\nHumboldt Call Area, NOAA Chart\n\nMorro Bay and Diablo Canyon Call Areas\n\nMorro Bay and Diablo Canyon Call Areas, NOAA Chart\n\nGIS/Shape Files for Mapping\n\n2018 California Call Areas\n\n2021 Call for Information and Nominations\n\nOn May 25, 2021, the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the state of California announced their agreement to advance areas for wind energy development offshore the northern and central coasts of California, enabling a path forward for the Humboldt Call Area and areas within and adjacent to the Morro Bay Call Area.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, BOEM published the Morro Bay East and West Extensions – Call for Information and Nominations in the Federal Register, which initiated a 45-day public comment period. BOEM accepted industry nominations and public comments until September 13, 2021.\n\nThe Morro Bay Call Area East Extension and the Morro Bay Call Area West Extension offshore the central California coast consist of approximately 90,025 acres (141 square statute miles).\n\nBelow are documents related to the 2021 Call:\n\nPublic Comments Received\n\nFederal Register Notice: Call for Information and Nominations for Morro Bay Extension Areas\n\nDocket Number: BOEM-2021-0044\n\nNominations of Interest\n\n2021 Area Identification Memos\n\nOn July 28, 2021, BOEM announced the designation of the Humboldt Wind Energy Area (WEA). The Humboldt WEA is located approximately 20 miles offshore the northern California coastline and comprises 132,369 acres (206.8 square miles). The analysis and rational used to develop the Humboldt WEA are described in the Area Identification Memo for the Morro Bay WEA. The full Area Identification Memo can be found here:\n\nNorthern California Area Identification Memo Pursuant to 30 C.F.R & 585.211(b).\n\nOn November 12, 2021, BOEM announced the designation of the Morro Bay WEA. The Morro Bay WEA is located approximately 20 miles offshore the central California coastline and comprises approximately 240,898 acres (376 square miles). The analysis and rational used to develop the Morro Bay WEA are described in the Area Identification Memo for the Morro Bay WEA. As described in the Area Identification Memo, the Morro Bay WEA includes the 2021 Call West Extension and a portion of the 2018 Call Area, while omitting the 2021 Call East Extension. The full Area Identification Memo can be found here:\n\nCentral California Area Identification Memo Pursuant to 30 C.F.R & 585.211(b).\n\nCalifornia Wind Energy Areas (WEAs)\n\nThe Humboldt WEA and Morro Bay WEA were each subject to an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act to consider the environmental consequences associated with issuing commercial wind leases and associated site characterization activities (i.e., biological, archeological, geological, and geophysical surveys and core samples) and site assessment activities (i.e., installation of meteorological buoys). For more information on the WEAs and environmental reviews, please follow the links below.\n\nHumboldt Wind Energy Area\n\nMorro Bay Wind Energy Area\n\nBiological Assessment & Concurrence\n\nBiological Assessment of Endangered and Threatened Species and Essential Fish Habitat Assessment for Offshore Wind Lease Issuance, Site Characterization, and Site Assessment for Central and Northern California (July 2022)\n\nEndangered Species Act Concurrence Letter and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act Essential Fish Habitat Response for the Morro Bay and Humboldt Wind Energy Areas (September 2022)\n\nProposed Lease Sale\n\nOn May 26, 2022, the Department of the Interior announced proposed auction details and lease terms for offshore wind energy development in the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area and Humboldt Wind Energy Area, located offshore central and northern California, respectively. The California Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) which included a 60-day public comment period, provided detailed information about potential areas that could be available for leasing, proposed lease provisions and conditions, auction details (e.g., criteria for evaluating competing bids and award procedures), and lease execution. The proposal included up to five lease areas within the two WEAs off California for potential commercial wind energy development. The proposed lease areas in the Humboldt and Morro Bay WEAs consist of approximately 373,268 acres (583 square miles) and have the potential to unlock over 4.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy, powering more than 1.5 million homes and supporting new jobs.\n\nMaterials related to the proposed lease sale are below.\n\nProposed Sale Notice (PSN)\n\nNorth Coast (Humboldt) Proposed Leases\n\nCA Proposed Lease OCS-P 0561\n\nCA Proposed Lease OCS-P 0562\n\nCentral Coast (Morro Bay) Proposed Leases\n\nCA Proposed Lease OCS-P 0563\n\nCA Proposed Lease OCS-P 0564\n\nCA Proposed Lease OCS-P 0565\n\nOverview Map of the California Proposed Lease Areas\n\nBidder's Financial Form\n\nBidder's Financial Form Addendum\n\nQualifications Guidelines\n\nCalifornia Proposed Lease Areas Shapefiles\n\nPublic Comments Received\n\nDocket Number: BOEM-2022-0017\n\nCalifornia Auction Seminar\n\nBOEM held an auction seminar on June 16, 2022 for prospective bidders in the proposed Pacific Wind Lease Sale 1 (PACW-1) for commercial wind energy leases offshore California.
