The Illinois Department of Public Healthâ€™s (IDPH) Immunization Section conducts programs and initiatives designed to make sure each child in your family has up-to-date immunizations.\n\nReview the CDC vaccination schedules for infants and children, preteens and teens, and adults found under Resources.\n\nIllinois state law requires certain immunizations for children and adults enrolled in child care, school, or college. State law also mandates immunizations for adults in specific fields of work (healthcare).\n\nBeginning fall of 2014, all students entering, transferring, or advancing into kindergarten through 12th grades will be required to show proof of receipt of 2 doses of mumps and 2 doses of rubella vaccine. In addition, students entering, transferring, or advancing into kindergarten, 6th, or 9th grades are required to show proof of receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine. Most students likely have already received the vaccine and simply need to provide the school with verifying documentation from their healthcare provider. To learn more, see Fall 2024 School Immunization Requirements.\n\nPlease refer to the Resources, Forms, and Publications sections for important information that ensures that the immunization needs of patients throughout the State of Illinois are met. Such information includes immunization schedules and immunization health education material request forms.\n\nFor recommendations for handling and storage of selected biologicals, see Vaccine Management.\n\nFor child entry to licensed daycare facility or school, see Child Health Examination Form.\n\nFor more information or a list of printed promotional material from the state, please contact the Immunization Section."
