        "text": "About\n\nAsya Geisberg Gallery opened in Chelsea in late 2010 with a mission to create a space conducive to intellectual inquiry and cultural cross-pollination, where ideas about art, and art about ideas, were at the forefront. After 10+ years, the gallery has relocated to 45 White Street in the heart of Tribeca and joined its vibrant arts community. Our program is visually eclectic and conceptually focused, encompassing work in all media. We represent young emerging artists as well as international artists otherwise unrepresented in the US, many of whom work across multiple media such as ceramics, textiles, painting, photography, and sculpture, with an interest in world history, archaeology, and cultural politics from a non-US perspective. Our artists have been reviewed in the New York Times, Artforum, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, and international publications. The gallery has shown at art fairs including UNTITLED Miami, UNTITLED San Francisco, ExpoChicago, NADA NY, ZONAMACO, Photofairs, Future Fair, and Art Los Angeles Contemporary (ALAC).\n\nAsya Geisberg Gallery is a proud member of the New Art Dealers Alliance (NADA) and ArtTable."
