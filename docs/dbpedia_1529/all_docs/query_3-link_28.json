She has been very active in the community, having served on the BJ board, the board of the Hebrew School, and on various BJ committees and volunteer programs to this day. She was honored as Kallat Torah in 2004. Asya holds a BA from Pembroke College (Brown University) and MA and MPhil degrees in musicology from NYU. After 25 years at NYU, she retired as Director of what is now the NYU Center for the Humanities, where she oversaw academic programs highlighting the University’s research and teaching in the humanities. She won the NYU Distinguished Administrator Award in 2010. Now, in her retirement, she devotes more time to her piano studies and the music she loves."
