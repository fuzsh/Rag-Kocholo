        "text": "I read The Bastard of Istanbul because I heard Elif Shafak, the author, speak at a debate on whether if we are citizens of the world we are citizens of nowhere. I’d never heard of her, but I see that she was a perfect choice for the debate because she is a citizen of Turkey who has lived in the US and London and who writes her books, which are best-sellers in Turkey, in English. She then has her books professionally translated into Turkish, and she then polishes that version.\n\nThe debate in which she spoke boiled down to whether you could have more than one identity. She and Simon Schama, who was on her side, argued that to say that you had to be either a citizen of somewhere or a citizen of nowhere was a false dichotomy. Shafik says in an interview at the end of the novel: “I have never understood this either/or mentality. All I know is the more they want me to fit in, the more my soul resists. I refuse to make a choice between English and Turkish: in truth, it is the commute back and forth between the two that fascinates me to this day.” She continues: “Separation can be a form of connection. Writing in English creates a cognitive distance between me and the culture I come from; paradoxically, this enables me to take a closer look at Turkey and Turkishness.” (I think of how Joyce left Ireland to write about Ireland, one of many exiles who did the same, and a quote I read this morning from Jules Renard: “It is in the heart of the city that one writes the most inspired pages about the city.”)\n\nThis book, which is her biggest seller, got her prosecuted for “insulting Turkishness,” which could have led to a three-year prison sentence. She wasn’t convicted, but it’s ironic that she should even be charged as I see this book being mainly about reconciliation.\n\nThe two central characters are women of 19, one of whom, Asya, is the Turkish bastard of the title and the other, Armanoush, an American Armenian ( called Amy by her American mother) who has a Turkish stepfather, Asya’s uncle. Asya lives with four “aunties,” one of whom is her mother but is called “auntie,” a grandmother, and a great-grandmother, while Armanoush also has an Armenian family with multiple aunts and a grandmother and only one weak uncle. There is a symmetry in their families, and they turn out to be even more intermingled as the plot develops.\n\nThis symmetry and intermingling is showing how we can and do have multiple identities, and how Turks and Armenian are much more similar than dissimilar. Their food is the same, and food is central to the book, with each chapter named after an ingredient in Turkish/Armenian cooking. There are several references to how Turks, Armenians, Jews, Greeks, and others lived together easily during most of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nArmanoush belongs to an online chatroom of American Armenians condemning the Turks for the genocide of 1915. She belongs to a family most of whom were killed in the genocide, but she is also caught between her mother who has never been outside the US and her Armenian family, making her confused. She travels to Istanbul, letting each party think she’s with the other, to “find herself” and find out about her history. She finds that she likes the Turks that she meets, that they are hazy about the genocide, and that they certainly don’t hate Armenians. Istanbul is her city in many ways.\n\nWomen completely dominate this book, to the point of not having one strongly-drawn male. Even the male who is central to the plot is thinly drawn, which upset at least one critic. But it didn’t bother me. Nor was I bothered by the novel starting in several places and taking some time to come together; nor by the family relationships becoming very complicated. But these were two other criticisms of the novel.\n\nI found that I read the novel quickly, sympathised with the characters, enjoyed the evocation of Istanbul, and liked the magical realism. I will read more of her books.\n\nHere are quotes I took from the book:\n\nThough books were potentially harmful, novels were all the more dangerous. The path of fiction could easily mislead you into the cosmos of stories where everything was fluid, quixotic, and as open to surprises as a moonless night in the desert.\n\nImagination was a dangerously captivating magic for those compelled to be realistic in life, and words could be poisonous for those destined always to be silenced.\n\n[Signs that you are Armenian]: If deep inside you feel like there is always more about your past than you will ever be allowed to learn\n\nShe had to make a journey to her past to be able to start living her own life.\n\nHe was gifted with something barred to many in this world: the ability to love another human being more than you love yourself.\n\nWomen enjoy taking care of one another’s wreckages.\n\nIrrationality is part of the everyday rationale. I feel like I am in a Gabriel García Márquez novel.\n\nThey acted and talked as if no matter what they said or how they said it, one could not really fully express the innermost self and, in the end, language was only a reeking carcass of hollow words long rotten inside.\n\nFamily stories intermingle in such ways that what happened generations ago can have an impact on seemingly irrelevant developments of the present day. The past is anything but bygone.\n\nI have never understood this either/or mentality. All I know is the more they want me to fit in, the more my soul resists. I refuse to make a choice between English and Turkish: in truth, it is the commute back and forth between the two that fascinates me to this day.\n\nLanguages shape us while we are busy thinking we are in charge of them.\n\nSeparation can be a form of connection. Writing in English creates a cognitive distance between me and the culture I come from; paradoxically, this enables me to take a closer look at Turkey and Turkishness."
