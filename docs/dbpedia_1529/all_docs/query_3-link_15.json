        "text": "Asya Grechka is a Robotics student and a Professional Rock Climber from Paris, France.\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior[]\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior 7[]\n\nGrechka first competed in Orlando in American Ninja Warrior 7, where she failed the Double Tilt Ladder in qualifying. She did get a wildcard spot into Vegas, but she failed the Propeller Bar during her run on Stage 1.\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior 8[]\n\nGrechka returned to compete in Oklahoma City in American Ninja Warrior 8 where she failed the Log Runner in qualifying. She did get another wildcard but she once again fell victim to the Propeller Bar on Stage 1. Both of those runs got cut from broadcast.\n\nOther Appearances[]\n\nShe competed on seasons 1 and 2 of Team Ninja Warrior as a part of Noah Kaufman's Think Tank.\n\nOn Team Ninja Warrior, she won both of her individual races by outracing her competitors, despite not completing the course. However, she got hung up on the Log Grip in the relay showdown, causing her team to lose against Team Ronin.\n\nOn Team Ninja Warrior 2, she failed to win an individual leg, falling on the Floating Tiles in her first race, and getting beaten to the Warped Wall on her second race. The team eventually made it to the playoffs, but Grechka continued to struggle on her own. She lost both her races to Tiana Webberley and Allyssa Beird, respectively. Think Tank was eventually eliminated after losing to Storm Team in the Knockout Round.\n\nGrechka has not competed on either show ever since, due to her poor performances, and she was replaced by Leila Noone on Think Tank for American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja.\n\nTeam Ninja Record[]\n\nSeason Episode Round Heat Opponent Team Opponent Result Notes Individual Record Team: Think Tank 1 4 (Qualifying) Round One 2 Wild Bunch Rose Wetzel Win Rose fell at the Dancing Stones. 1-0 1 4 (Qualifying) Round Two 2 Karsonic Boom Beth Higginbotham Win Both of them failed at the Warped Wall after 3 attempts.
