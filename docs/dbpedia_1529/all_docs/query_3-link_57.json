        "text": "After completing my fellowship at Fox Chase, Iâ€™m delighted to continue my career here, joining the collaborative team of outstanding clinicians and researchers, dedicated to providing best care to our patients. My philosophy of care is to treat every patient like family. This means educating them fully about their treatment options and helping them make the right decision for the best possible outcome. A diagnosis of cancer can be challenging to deal with, but with a caring, experienced team behind a patient, the journey can feel less stressful.\n\nPooja Ghatalia, Chad H.
