        "text": "Tsubasa1 Â· 20/05/2019 19:29\n\nWe had chosen the name Aylin pronounced 'Eileen' for our second baby. Baby is half-turkish and as we live in Turkey we need a Turkish name. I really want the name to work in English too and I feel Aylin works better than Asya (pronounced aseeya, not eysiya)\n\nInitially we had chosen Ayla pronounced \"Isla\" but its too similar sounding to our other daughters name.\n\nWhat are your opinions on Aylin/Asya?\n\nDo you have any other ideas?\n\nPurely from a non Turkish point of view.....Aylin reminds me of 'ailing and I think the sound Eileen is a bit grannyish. Asya is lovely.\n\nWhat about Azra? That's Turkish isn't it?\n\nThanks for your suggestions. I love the name Aylin but I realise its very unpopular!! Im glad you like Asya and the suggestions you made are also good!\n\nThanks they are lovely but I think my husband will think those names arent \"real Turkish\" names. I also haven't heard either of them here before!\n\nQuite honestly the names you suggest look lovely written down, and Asya particularly has a nice sound too, but they do not translate to the U.K. Whichever you choose she will have to correct the prononciation outside Turkey. People will say \"Ey-lin\" for Aylin (or \"Eye-lin\" at a push) and probably \"Ey-see-ya\" for Asya.\n\nIt depends how bothered you are about this. Plenty of people have names that people mispronounce and need to correct them, it's not necessarily a big deal.\n\nFwiw Asya seems the prettier option.\n\nThanks for all your comments, I see Asya is waaaay more popular than Aylin.\n\nI'm not too bothered about people mispronouncing/mispelling the name, as we don't spend that much time in the UK. I really want my UK family to like the name though! It sounds like Eileen is not a name people like at all over there."
