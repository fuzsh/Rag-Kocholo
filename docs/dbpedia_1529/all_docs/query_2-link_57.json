We spoke lots before I came and she answered all my questions and made me feel really at ease before I travelled. She sent a vip car to the airport to collect me and gave the driver a big bag of snacks and drinks and sweets for me which was so nice of her. I arrived to my hotel which was beautiful 5 star, the staff were so nice and didn‚Äôt let me lift a finger. The next morning Linda sent another VIP car to collect me and bring me to the hospital where she was there to meet me with her lovely kind smiling face. She stayed with me all day until I had my operation in the evening, she knew how anxious I was and tried to take my mind off it by sitting chatting laughing with me, it really worked! The nurses in the hospital were so kind and helpful, although they‚Äôre was a language barrier this didn‚Äôt matter they understood me as a human and took great care of me. One of the nurses even ordered me a kebab when I woke from my operation as I could not do it from my phone I tried to give her the money but she refused I will never forget this girl she was so nice. Linda came to collect me the next day and i returned to my hotel to rest, i told her that i had poor sleep in the hospital and she got me some medication to help with this along with lots of other medication and essentials from the pharmacy she really did think of everything. On these next few days i continued to have support from Linda, she came to my hotel with the doctor to remove my bandages and also helped me to wash my hair as I wasn‚Äôt able to do it alone. I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would have got through the whole process without Linda, she is an amazing lady and deserves a lot of credit for what she does. She has such a kind caring nature about her and I instantly knew that I could trust her. I spoke with her about some other procedures I would like done and she took my photos to discuss with the doctors and Is preparing a plan for me at the moment, I honestly could not ask for better care this time so I will 100% be returning for my other treatments later in the year. I trust Linda with my life and I would recommend Asya hospital for any treatment. Thankyou so much to all the doctors nurses and people behind the scenes that made this all possible, I finally have my confidence back and I‚Äôm looking forward to my future (something I wasn‚Äôt able to do for a long time) I‚Äôm forever grateful to you all ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThe care that I received, doctors expertise, nurses in the hospital were amazing, the hotel, food.\n\nThere was nothing negative in my experience, it all went completely well.\n\nJTrinh Trinh ‚Ä¢ Cheekbone reduction\n\nGermany\n\nVerified review.\n\nLinda has been wonderful to work with, being extremely kind and attentive\n\nI got rhinoplasty done. Linda has been wonderful to work with, being extremely kind and attentive. Though the night immediately after the operation was a bit rough, most of the pain subsided quickly the following days. Operation itself and healing went smooth. Results are also satisfactory, still waiting for the nose to fully heal and see final results though. Good impression of the hospital with clean rooms. Working with the clinic, Oguz and booking.com has been flexible and a pleasure. No surprise bills. Would honestly recommend üëç\n\nFriendly staff\n\nMore details and available option would be great\n\nAnonymous ‚Ä¢ Rhinoplasty (nose job)\n\nSpain\n\nVerified review.\n\nI am very happy with the results of my surgery\n\nI am very happy with the results of my surgery.

The translators did their best and made sure to reply to every inquiry. The Dr was Soo skilled, gave clear directions and informations and I think did an amazing job with my surgery I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. On the other hand, The room was old and my partner couldn‚Äôt fit in the sofa bed . I had bruises on my arms after surgery. It seems that they tried to put in a needle/injection but couldn‚Äôt find a vain. It would have been appreciated if they explained after the surgery. Also it would have been good to see the dr after the surgery just to explain how the surgery went instead of the translator delivering a message . Also it would have been appreciated to see the surgeon last day before flying back to home to remove the fluid drainage tubes instead of a nurse I had never met before. Lastly the gauze,tape and dressing cleaning tools were not exactly enough. We had to purchase more 2 days after the surgery. I had no pain to minimal pain all through. I think the discomfort level wasn‚Äôt expected when it comes to sleeping on the back and how to,How to go to toilet, energy level after the surgery. After all this said , I would do it all over again for the results I had got . And would recommend 100%\n\nL\n\nReply from Linda NUROL\n\nrepresentative of Asyaesthetic Clinic\n\nThank you so much Shaima for good review , we appricate to met with you , wish you healty and lovely year"
