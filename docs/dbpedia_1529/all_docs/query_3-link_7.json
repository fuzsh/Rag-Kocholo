        "text": "Asya Branch, a former Miss Mississippi, is a remarkable individual known for her accomplishments in beauty pageants and beyond. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Branch grew up in the north Mississippi town of Booneville and has made a name for herself as a model, activist, and public speaker. After graduating from Booneville High School, she made her way to Oxford to study Integrated Marketing Communications with an emphasis in Public Relations at the University of Mississippi’s School of Journalism and New Media.\n\nBranch won her first pageant in 2016, when she was named Miss Historic Crossroads. She was crowned Miss Mississippi in 2018, earning the opportunity to represent her state in the Miss America competition. She made history in 2020 becoming the first African-American to be crowned Miss Mississippi USA and also the first African-American woman to win the Miss USA pageant. Her dedication, talent, and commitment to service were evident throughout her reign, inspiring many with her platform focused on empowering children of incarcerated parents. Her passion and determination took her to the White House, where she served on a criminal justice reform roundtable.\n\nBranch’s life after pageantry has been laser-focused on her platform. After competing in the 2020 Miss Universe competition, she launched “Finding Your Way: Empowering Children of Incarcerated Parents.” Part of this initiative is the “Love Letters” program that aims to increase communication between incarcerated parents and their children. The program has reconnected some inmates with estranged children, showing evidence of success.\n\nBranch continues to be an influential figure, using her voice to inspire others and create positive change. Her story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance, determination, and the belief in oneself to overcome challenges and achieve greatness."
