        "text": "The purpose of this study is to examine the significance of the studies of the Hungarian composer and ethnomusicologist Bela Bartok, which became a basis for the ethnomusicology studies in Turkey during the nation state formation process starting with the establishment of the Republic in line with Turkish music revolution ideology. Nationalism, preservation of the traditional music, emphasizing the dominant ethnic identity, including folk music in the training music gained a place in the Turkish music life with the help of Bartok's studies. Thus, the aspects of the relationship of Bela Bartok's Turkey compilations to the music revolution in Turkey and the national music ideology, the importance of Bartok and his compilation styles in revealing the national and local music and his field researches' forming a basis for the ethnomusicology studies will be discussed in the scope of folk music studies in line with this purpose.\n\nThis paper investigates the uses and functions of Turkish folk music in contemporary Turkey. Twenty-six musical events, occurring in a broad range of social and regional contexts, have been ethnographically studied in a systematic way. The data, collected by means of participant observation and interviews with performers, listeners and commissioners, were analysed according to the qualitative inductive approach. The analysis showed that Turkish folk music plays a role in different kinds of events: artistic training and dance education, variants of the “concert” concept such as festivals and café concerts, celebrations of life cycle events, official openings and other important events, religious services, and formal and informal social gatherings. Turkish folk music also turned out to adopt a variety of functions, which can be situated in different fields: a psychological function and an aesthetic function (personal field); the communication of emotional, cultural or historical content and the preservation or transmission of cultural heritage (cultural field); a professional function, inducing dance, and communicating emotions and thoughts (personal-social field); creating or strengthening social ties and expressing political views (social field); the expression or construction of (cultural) identity (social-cultural field); inducing a mystical or a religious experience or evoking feelings of solidarity, humanity or philanthropy (philosophical-spiritual field); and the accompaniment of life cycle events and other important events (ritual field). These results illustrate the potent and varied role of Turkish folk music in contemporary Turkish society.\n\nSummary of the presentation: 1. Short introduction to the Turkish musical traditions. The Turkish musical landscape can be structured into different fields. A first field concerns art music or Ottoman classical music, theoretically underpinned and associated to courtly and Sufi contexts. A second field, Turkish folk music, consists of secular songs and dances, liturgical Alevi music, and bardic (aşık) traditions. A third field concerns Islamic religious music, performed in Turkish and Arabic. Turkish popular musics, contemporary classical music using traditional Turkish material, and to a lesser extent Ottoman military music, constitute hybrid Eastern-Western post-traditional fields. The different fields share characteristics regarding tone system, time system, texture, modality, and manner of creation, transmission and performance, while certain ambiguities persist regarding perceived ‘rules’ and boundaries. 2. Discussion of the official corpus of Turkish folk music. The concept of ‘folk music’ is ideologically-politically charged in Turkey, since it has been put forward by Atatürk as the musical repertoire representing the Turkish identity and nation. The TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) archive is an extensive collection of recordings and notations of Turkish folk and art music. The folk music repertoire builds on collecting expeditions undertaken since the first years of the Turkish Republic, and is still in further expansion. It has become the canon upon which almost all urban folk music practice and discourse is based in Turkey and the diaspora. A ‘modern’ conception of folk music has emerged, which is canonised and standardised, not orally transmitted, not embedded in a rural context, and has often lost its primary function. 3. Brief overview of the transmission contexts of Turkish folk music in Ghent. De Centrale’s World Music School comes closest to formal education in Turkish folk music, and offers three collective courses involving Turkish folk music: bağlama, Turkish music ensemble, and (partially) darbuka. Non-formal education takes place in the context of collective bağlama lessons in music cafés and associations, individual lessons in private or semi-public locations, jam or tune learning sessions in music cafés, and spontaneous educational moments (including in musician-families). Informal, non-intentional learning occurs during live performances and conversations with musicians. The integration of the bağlama in education can be approached in a culture-independent way or in a way that takes cultural contexts into consideration. Thus, it either adds to and facilitates the creation of a broad range of genres and styles, or conveys particular indigenous Turkish traditions, especially Alevi and aşık repertoires and styles. A combined approach generates ‘grounded creativity’ based on organic, thoughtful, informed developments. The instrument’s present-day iconic cultural function is relatively recent. Turkish folk music is more than the bağlama, and more than the TRT repertoire and style – both are standardised instruments of the Turkish state’s cultural policy. While Turkish folk music in contemporary Turkey has taken on ‘classical’ dimensions, I make a case for the reconsideration of artificial boundaries between genre categories in favour of an integrated approach, validating different urban and rural, historical and contemporary, Turkish and non-Turkish expressions.\n\nHungarian prehistory displays a peculiar duality of language and music: the language belongs to the Finno-Ugric family, while several pre-Conquest strata of the folk music are connected to Turkic groups. Intrigued by this phenomenon, Hungarian folk music researchers launched thorough comparative examinations quite early; to mention but the most important scholars: Zoltán Kodály [10] demonstrated Cheremis and Chuvash analogies in the first place; Béla Bartók [1, 2] drew still valid conclusions about the folk music of Anatolia from a relatively small material; Lajos Vargyas [36, 37, 38, 39] carried out the comprehensive historical investigation of the folk music of the Volga-Kama region; Bence Szabolcsi [30–35] demonstrated even broader international musical connections after surveying an enormous material; Katalin Paksa [12] studied the eastern relations of our narrow-range tetra- and pentatonic tunes; László Dobszay [5, 6] and László Dobszay – Janka Szendrei [4, 8] – applying a novel approach to the Hungarian folk music material – reviewed the international material in regard to the lament and psalmodic styles, among other things. In keeping with the noblest traditions of Hungarian folk music research, investigations authenticated by fieldwork have been going on to this day parallel with theoretical research. Most important among them for my present dissertation are Béla Bartók’s Anatolian collecting in 1936, László Vikár’s and Gábor Bereczki’s areal field research in the territory designated by the Volga, Kama and Belaya in 1957–1978 [Vikár 40–49; Vikár – Bereczki 50–53] and my field research activity among Turkic ethnicities since 1987 [14–29]. At the beginning, the main goal of this research series was to explore the eastern relations of the Hungarian folk music, which gradually broadened into the areal folk music research of the multi-ethnic Volga-Kama-Belaya region. I further expanded it into the comparative investigation of diverse Turkic-tongued groups living over the vast Eurasian territory. In the meantime, the study of Hungarian prehistoric connections was also going on.\n\nThe Turkish Five (Türk Beşleri) is a name given to a group of composers whose works set out the direction for modern Western-style Turkish art music. After the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new generation of musicians trained in Europe had been given the task to establish a new musical tradition for the modern Turkish society. It was supposed to replace the Ottoman musical tradition. According to outlines given by the Turkish government, the new “National Music” (Millî Musiki) should encompass ele-ments of Western-style art music and melodies of Turkish folk music. Five composers were especially successful in fulfilling this task, Necil Kâzım Akses, Hasan Ferit Alnar, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun and Cemal Reşit Rey. By their compositions, they brought to live music that was appreciated by Kemal Atatürk himself. Although they were supposed to avoid any elements of the Ottoman musical tradition, even in the most popu-lar works of this period, one can hear influences that were not to be heard in the Millî Musiki. In this paper, the author presents the main guidelines and historical overview of the “musical revolution” which took place in Turkey of the early-republican period (1923–1938). Next, provides a list of compositions which prove her thesis that com-posers born in 1904–1908, as the youngest generation of the Ottoman Empire’s elite, did not completely reject the Ottoman musical heritage in which they were raised and brought some of its elements into 20th-century Western-style Turkish classical music."
