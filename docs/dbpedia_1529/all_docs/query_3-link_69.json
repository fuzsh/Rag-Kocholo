        "text": "Asya Kazantseva has left Russia due to what she describes as a \"wave of hate\" from pro-war groups and government officials over her anti-war views. Kazantseva has faced repeated harassment for taking part in anti-war protests, including being briefly detained when she was nine months pregnant. The rising pressure against her is the latest example of the escalating state crackdown on dissenting voices within Russia. The Coalition For Women In Journalism and Women Press Freedom fervently condemns the persistent and relentless repression of critical media in Russia. We urge the international community to do all in its power to pressure the Russian government to end its persecution of journalists.\n\nAcclaimed science journalist and author Asya Kazantseva has been forced to leave Russia to seek refuge in Georgia following escalating threats from Russian officials and pro-war groups. She asserts authorities are making deliberate efforts to \"cleanse the media landscape from disloyal elements\" ahead of the upcoming presidential elections, in which Vladimir Putin is seeking his fifth term in office.\n\nIn a January 21, 2024, Facebook post, Kazantseva detailed the challenges she faced, saying authorities sought to discredit her, instill fear, and ultimately force her out of the country.\n\nThe gravity of the situation deepened when State Duma deputy Andrei Lugovoy labeled Kazantseva a \"traitor\" and publicly disclosed her past home addresses. Although Lugovoy later deleted his post, the damage was done, and the journalist's safety was jeopardized. The Duma’s ethics committee, despite the severity of the incident, found no violations and defended Lugovoy's actions under the guise of freedom of speech guaranteed by the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe impact of these actions was exacerbated by the cancellation of her book presentations and lectures in December 2023. These events were allegedly scrapped due to pressure from pro-war figures. The journalist says organizers of her Moscow lecture received a number of calls with threats and decided to cancel the event “so as not to worry about the safety of staff and audience.” Kazantseva noted that the cancellations made it difficult to earn a living in Russia.\n\n“I am a Russian science journalist,” wrote Kazantseva. “As soon as the wind changes and I can work in Russia again, I will be back on the first flight.”\n\nOn April 13, 2024, the Russian Ministry of Justice labeled both Asya Kazantseva and BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov as \"foreign agents.\" The term \"foreign agent\" carries negative implications in Russia, reminiscent of Soviet-era campaigns against dissenters. The designation is used to marginalize those challenging Kremlin policies and has been repeatedly assigned to independent journalists at home and abroad.\n\nTwo months later, on July 11, 2024, the Khoroshevsky District Court in Moscow opened an administrative case against Kazantseva for not submitting the reports required for \"foreign agents.\"\n\nKazantseva’s fear that the state will intensify its attacks against her is wholly justifiable, considering the increasingly hostile environment for journalists in Russia. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russians who oppose the war or have reported facts from the conflict that challenge the Kremlin’s narrative have been harassed, detained, and imprisoned. Siberian journalist Maria Ponomarenko is serving a six-year sentence for an Instagram post about civilian deaths in Mariupol, Ukraine. US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, languishing in pre-trial detention since October 2023, is also facing bogus charges.\n\nUnfortunately, Kazantseva’s decision to leave Russia does not mean the Russian state will end its harassment. In 2023, CFWIJ documented 15 cases of transnational repression perpetrated by Russian authorities against women journalists abroad. Ten of these incidents involved the harassment of exiled Russian journalists critical of the government. The Kremlin has attempted to poison journalists, imposed absurd sentences in absentia, and intimidated the families of exiled journalists still living in the country.\n\nThe Coalition For Women In Journalism and Women Press Freedom is dismayed that Asya Kazantseva has been forced into exile. She understandably no longer feels safe in her home country. The persistent attacks on journalists critical of the Kremlin are decimating any resemblance of press freedom within Russia. We call on the international community to condemn these actions and to apply pressure on the Russian government to stop its crackdown on the media."
