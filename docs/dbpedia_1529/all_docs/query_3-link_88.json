        "text": "Asya Kozina is a creative focused on exploring the possibilities of modern paper sculpture. Her interest as a professional artist lies in the field of cultural research, archiving and plastic expression of various historical, traditional and artistic representations. Unique and intricate designs require trying on, insisting on telling your story through limited edition photographs and prints.\n\nThe universal white paper is used not only as a tool, but also as a concept to help symbolize the historical process. The images of the Mongolian, African, Scythian, Venetian, Baroque, Modern cultures are easily recognizable and at the same time metaphorical. A paraphrase of the modern understanding of history as a set of events, cleared of the signs of epochs, but often filled with modern emotions and value judgments. Since then, the artist has left a blank paper surface to be eaten by the viewer’s perception.\n\nThe plain white sheet works have become the artist’s signature mark. Asya believe that white paper allows for them to accent form and conceal secondary details. All of their pieces are crafted by hand, each unique in its own right, never to be replicated. This individuality forms an opposition to multiplying media images created with the help of digital tools, a representation of modern visual culture. At first glance, one may suspect some of Kozin’s works to be graphically designed through digital means. Happily enough, these projects have been left unaltered by present-day technology, a true representation of craftsmanship."
