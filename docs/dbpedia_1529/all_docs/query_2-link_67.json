        "text": "İki binli yıllar Türkiye'de iç politika, ekonomi ve toplumsal konularda olduğu kadar dış politika ve dip-lomasisi de büyük dönüşümlerin yaşandığı bir dönemdir. 1990'lı yıllarda Türk insanın dışa açılması suretiyle dış dünya ile girmiş olduğu etkileşim Türkiye'nin dönüşümünde önemli bir rol oynamıştır. Bu dönemde, kültürel etkinliklerden insani yardım faaliyetlerine Türk eğitim kurumlarının, yerel yö-netimlerin ve çeşitli sivil toplum kuruluşlarının insandan insana yürüttüğü paralel diplomasi Türk dış politikasının görünmeyen gücü niteliğinde olmuştur. Dünyaya anlatacağı özgün ve evrensel boyutta hikayesi bulunan Türkiye'nin, kendini doğru ve etkin bir şekilde ifade etmesinin yolu bireysel hak ve öz-gürlükleri geliştirmek, vatandaşlarına taşımaktan gurur duyacakları bir aidiyet kazandırmak suretiyle sivil toplumun yürüttüğü kültürel diplomasiyi desteklemekten geçmektedir. Kültürel diplomasi yürüten sivil toplum örgütlerini yönlendirmek ve onlara kaynak sağlamak suretiyle geliştirilecek bir strateji, ül-kenin demokratik yapısını güçlendireceği gibi, küresel düzeyde bir kültürel diplomasi girişimine öncülük eden Türkiye'nin yumuşak gücünün daha da etkin bir şekilde hissedilmesini sağlayacaktır. Bu çalış-mada dünyadaki değişime paralel olarak Türkiye'de diplomasinin kurumsal ve uygulama açısından geçirdiği evrim ve kültürel diplomasi incelenmektedir. \" The 21st century is a period in which Turkey is going through deep changes not only in domestic policies , economic and social issues but also in foreign policies and diplomacy. The opening-up of Turkish people to the world in the 1990ies paved the way to their interaction with other countries which, in turn, played a major role in the transformation of the country. In this period, the parallel diplomacy practiced on a one-to-one basis by Turkish educational institutions, local governments and various NGOs through activities ranging from cultural events to humanitarian aid, has been the invisible power of Turkish foreign policy. As a country which has a universal narrative story of its own to tell the world, Turkey's way to expressing itself in a correct and efficient way, goes through the development of individual rights and freedoms, the granting of a sense of belonging to its citizens which they will be proud of as well as the support of cultural diplomacy carried out by NGOs. Thus, a strategy to be developed by leading NGOs which are the main actors of cultural diplomacy, and providing them the resources they need, will not only strengthen the democratic structure of the country. Above all, through such a strategy, Turkey's soft power which plays a leading role in the practice of cultural diplomacy on a global scale will become all the more so efficient and perceptible. Taking into consideration the changes currently occurring in the world, this article dealing with cultural diplomacy aims at shedding a light on the evolution which Turkish diplomacy is going through in terms of its enforcing institutions and practice.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze the soft power impact of the European Union, a supra-national body exerting its power in the economic sphere rather than in the military field such as nation states, in establishing its inspiring and appealing exceptional structure and the soft power of Turkey in a comparative perspective. For the purpose of this analysis, the soft power of the EU is examined and evaluated with a holistic approach besides dwelling on the soft power activities of the EU’s Big Four, namely Germany, United Kingdom, France and Italy. We already know that Turkey, as a candidate for EU membership, has been affected by such activities for a long time. In this respect, the point that should be inquired is how much the EU is affected from Turkey. That is why we believe that this study will shed light on the soft power and public diplomacy dimensions of EU-Turkey relations.\n\nIn this study, the concepts of soft power and public diplomacy notions will be analyzed in the context of Balkan countries. The objctive of this paper is to reveal the the public diplomacy and sof power policy in Balkan countries. The researchers will analyze the soft power and public diplomacy policies are implemented by Turkish Foreign policy for Balkan Countries. The role of Turkish foreign policy is examined by the researchers in this study. The researchers try to reveal how Turkey uses soft power and public diplomacy in Balkan countries in today's world. The researchers focus on positive effects of soft power and public diplomacy in Balkans. This study tries to express the notions of soft power and public diplomacy according to international relations literature and the researchers try to investigate soft power and public diplomacy activities of Tukey in Balkan countries. The terms of \" public diplomacy and soft power \" are questioned in this present study. This is significant because the notions of soft power and public diplomacy play a significant role in order to maintain and construct the communication with international communities. In today's world cultural attraction plays an important role for constructing and establishing the public opinions in communities. The researchers use qualititative method and they try to describe and explain the effects of soft power and public diplomacy under the scope of Balkan countries. As a result, the researchers find out that Turkey follows effective soft power and public diplomacy and cultural based activities in Balkan countries in other words in Balkan region."
