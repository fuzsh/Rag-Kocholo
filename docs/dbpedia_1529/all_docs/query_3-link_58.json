        "text": "From an early age, I gravitated to the theatre. The ability to work together as an ensemble to build worlds in real time captivated me. I started as Munchkin #9 in a small, local production of the Wizard of Oz, my part consisting of a single line of dialogue, but soon graduated to lead roles before following the natural progression of theatre to backstage. I no longer wanted to just star in productions, I wanted to create them, writing and directing anything from one acts to cabarets.\n\nHowever, a love of math was brewing in me. When I discovered Physics, the field of study that used mathematics to explain and predict the behaviors of the physical world, a new love affair began and I quickly recognized the ability to positively impact and improve people's lives through engineering. I went on to attain my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, but I never lost my love of theatre or storytelling.\n\nUpon graduation, I began working for the fabled Walt Disney Imagineering, the design house for the Walt Disney Company's Parks and Resorts, as a Ride Engineer, cutting my teeth as an engineer on Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance where I led the Trackless Vehicle System and Onboard Animated Prop. From there, I spread out. I have worked in Research & Development rapid prototyping interfaces between human performers and articulated costumes to bring larger than life characters to life. I have written worlds into existence, creating original characters that inhabit the immersive environments we create. I have led Blue Sky teams to find compelling ways to apply cutting-edge technology to tell stories in new and unexpected ways. I have embraced my duality, acting as the lead engineer for a new attraction while simultaneously using my in-depth knowledge of the ride system to write the show and experience the physical system delivers. And, that's just what I do at my day job.\n\nIt's been my pleasure to collaborate with a host of talented individuals and companies on numerous projects from working with ESPN Creative Works on branded content to developing my own screenplays and children's books. I look forward to sharing them with you!"
