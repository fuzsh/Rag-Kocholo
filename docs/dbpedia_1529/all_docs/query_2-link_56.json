        "text": "Famous actor Demet Evgar has been announced as the first National Goodwill Ambassador of UN Women Turkey. Besides being an actor, Demet Evgar is a strong defender of women's rights and gender equality and she advocates through her TV series and movies.\n\nUN Women Turkey has announced the famous Turkish actor Demet Evgar as its new and first National Goodwill Ambassador. The announcement was made at a launching event in Istanbul, gathering the press, civil society, youth and UN Women on March 7. The event announced the details of the collaboration with Demet Evgar and kicked off #IamaWoman/#BenKadınım Campaign, which will be co-run by UN Women and Demet Evgar covering different activities in the coming two years.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Demet Evgar shared her feelings about becoming UN Women’s National Goodwill Ambassador and the happiness and honor it brings to her, “It gives me a great honor to become a Goodwill Ambassador of UN Women. I have been supporting women’s rights both in my private and professional life. Being selected for this title shows me that I am on the right path. The title comes with a great honor but also an important responsibility. Being aware of this responsibility, I aim to strengthen my efforts to empowering women and support achieving gender equality in collaboration with UN Women. I would like to make the real-life stories of women visible and inspire other women through creating a women’s solidarity.”\n\nEmphasizing the importance of art to transform the society, UN Women Turkey Country Director Asya Varbanova pointed that collaboration with Demet Evgar is a key step to reach women from different corners of Turkey, and bring visibility to their stories, “As an influential role model and an actor with strong belief in equality, Demet Evgar will play an important role in our aim of empowering women and achieving gender equality. Together with her, we will make the real-life stories of women visible. Women should not take the supporting roles but be the lead actors of their own lives. When more women realize their potentials, speak up for their rights, use available mechanisms against inequalities and further demand, we become closer to the equal future we aim for.”"
