        "text": "Alaa Dallah\n\n1/1/2023\n\n4.0\n\nThe hospital is renewed but still simple. We did an operation and had to stay for 3 nights. They served meals to the patient's caregiver. The cleaning ladies are very humble and sweet. The toilet and the room were cleaned multiple times aday when required. The only problem is (the nurses) they are not cooperative nor show any empathy. I hope they were more considerate.\n\nNancy Swyers\n\n10/22/2019\n\n5.0\n\nI am an American who had traveled to Nepal for a few months. When I left Nepal I landed in Istanbul to do a little sightseeing. Little did I know that the slight cold and cough I had was severe pneumonia. After having been taken to two other different hospitals I was transferred here. I can not say enough about the wonderful and compassionate. Everyone went out of their way make a foreigner feel welcome. Thanks to Google translate we were able to communicate fine. I know I would not have received just compassionate, caring yet professional care even in America. I literally owe my life to all the doctors, nurses,nurseâ€™s helpers, etc. who took care of me. I would come back here anytime. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your great care and compassion."
