        "text": "Hi, I am happy to see you here!\n\nI am one of those people who started taking pictures before social media appeared ðŸ™‚ I got my first (analog) camera when I was 6 and have kept my love of photography till now.\n\nI moved to California in July 2018, and now, together with my husband Ben, we are traveling around our state, the USA, and the world, taking pictures of all the inspiring things we see.\n\nThrough my blog and social media channels, I inspire others to travel and discover hidden gems. Itâ€™s all about exploring unique places and experiences, along with a love for nature and photography.\n\nI love working with brands, creating unique content carefully tailored for each campaign.\n\nI hope you are enjoying your visit! Feel free to message me, I am looking forward to connecting with you!\n\nGear: Canon R5, DJI Mini 3 Pro, Insta360 X4, husband."
