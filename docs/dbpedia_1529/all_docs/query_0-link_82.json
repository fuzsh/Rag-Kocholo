        "text": "She was, according to Western media, a poster-girl for her people, admired as much for her striking good looks as her military prowess.\n\nBut for her fellow fighters, Asia Ramazan Antar's portrayal in the press and social media came as both a surprise and disappointment.\n\nThe 19-year-old, from the Syrian Kurdish city of Qamishli, was killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Syria last month.\n\nFocusing their stories on her looks, some Western media said she was known as the \"Angelina Jolie of Kurdistan\" after the glamorous Hollywood actress.\n\nSome compatriots have decried these comparisons as sexism and objectification.\n\nThe Kurdish Women's Protection Units (YPJ), to which Asia Ramazan Antar belonged, say their philosophy is simplicity and modesty.\n\nNo-one is judged based on his or her appearance, shape or size. Individuals, they say, make personal sacrifices for the collective good.\n\nLast year, despite resistance from conservative religious groups, female fighters pushed Syrian Kurdistan to pass progressive laws that make violence against women, forced marriage and polygamy illegal. An all-women police unit was created to implement the law.\n\nAfter completing her military training, she went to the frontline to fight IS militants.\n\nAsia Ramazan Antar took part in five battles before she was killed around Manbij near the Turkish border on 30 August.\n\nShe was a team leader and machine-gunner. Over the past two years, six of her cousins and uncles were also killed in the fight against IS.\n\nJust like Asia Ramazan Antar, hundreds of other Kurdish fighters have been killed. Most of them were young, in their late teens and early 20s - but none garnered the kind of publicity showered on Viyan."
