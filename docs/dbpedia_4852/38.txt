Prague is a fantastic destination for senior rugby tours as it offers countless bars and clubs to explore in the evenings, hospitable clubs to play and some great landmarks to visit. Ollerton RFC had a great long weekend in the city, with a match and a sightseeing day.

On the first day Ollerton played local team Praga Praha RFC. Ollerton lost on the pitch but found the club to be extremely good hosts, with plenty of food and beers after the game!

After the post match hospitality the team had the night to explore all the wonders Prague has to offer! The following day was free for them to explore some of Pragueâ€™s most famous landmarks, such as the Charles Bridge, Castle district and the Astronomical Clock.
