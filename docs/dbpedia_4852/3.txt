USA Rugby South Tour Interviews & Prague

The USA Rugby South Panthers took eight months to prepare for their Central European tour to Hungary, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Finally, the tour began a reality and the team departed on August 25 and left Prague on September 2.

The team defeated the 68th ranked Hungarian National team 35-12 on August 26 and then won against the 75th ranked Austria National team 51-0 on August 29 in Vienna. Their final match was on September 1 against the 32nd ranked Czech Republic National team at the Rugby Club Mountfield Říčany. The team faced it’s the greatest challenge of the tour losing 24-10 and ending the tour with a 2-1 record.

Prior to the team leaving the extended USA Rugby South squad was published. The articles included photos and interviews, along with some of the cultural aspects of the tour.

This article is the concluding one of the tour and includes rugby tour interviews along with cultural aspects of the tour as seen through photos.

For team members and the coaching staff, the tour will have lifetime memories. That certainly can’t be captured in an article or through photos, but a glimpse of what was experienced should be of interest to many.
