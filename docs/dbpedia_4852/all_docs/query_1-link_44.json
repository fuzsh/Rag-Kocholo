        "text": "Chicken wings and the Super Bowl. Strawberries and Wimbledon. Beer and the Rugby World Cup.\n\nSome pairings in sport are so synonymous that they have become an industry-standard measurement of scale, the consumption of one having come to signify the magnitude of the other.\n\nAt the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, an estimated 1.9 million litres of beer were drunk inside match venues and fan zones. Four years later, local organisers in Japan took special measures to prepare for an influx of pint-guzzling rugby fans who are said to consume about six times more beer than their soccer counterparts. And this year in France, a record 2.5 million litres of beer – roughly five million pints – were sunk over the course of the seven-week tournament.\n\nSuch figures speak to the opportunity at hand for the Rugby World Cup’s official beer partner, even if the challenge of meeting demand is equally sizeable.\n\n“This is one of those events where the supporters mix, they can sit together, they have fun, it’s very sociable,” says Grant McKenzie, the chief marketing officer at Asahi Europe & International (AEI). “It fits perfectly with beer.”\n\nSpurred by the success of the 2019 edition in its native Japan, Asahi Group signed up as a worldwide partner of this year’s Rugby World Cup back in April 2021. Replacing Heineken as the official beer of the tournament, the Tokyo-based brewer became the first Asian company to acquire top-tier sponsorship rights to rugby union’s pinnacle event.\n\nFor AEI, sponsorship of the Rugby World Cup added to an existing sports partnership portfolio that included a multi-year deal with the Aston Martin Formula One team, which centres on the group’s Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0% brand of alcohol-free beer. Those agreements have since been complemented by another multi-year deal with City Football Group (CFG), for whom Asahi Super Dry, the group’s flagship brand, serves as a global partner and the official beer of four CFG-owned clubs: Manchester City, Melbourne City, Yokohama F Marinos, and Sichuan Juiniu.\n\nFor McKenzie, a Scot who operates out of AEI’s headquarters in Prague, there are two main justifications for such high-profile sports partnerships – and neither has much to do with the number of pints consumed by fans during the live event.\n\n“One is the fragmentation of what we would call traditional media: it’s very hard to reach as many people on one or two channels and sport does that,” he tells SportsPro, speaking in Paris shortly before England’s semi-final showdown with eventual winners South Africa. “And the second thing is the passion – it’s a cliché but it’s true – the passion people have for sport.\n\n“There’s a lot of divisiveness now in society, and sports unite. As a beer brand, where your messaging is ‘you should all just talk things over a beer, we should all get together and build social connection’, then it’s actually a very powerful platform.”\n\nAEI, which operates 19 production facilities in eight countries across Europe, owns several of the world’s best-known beer brands, including Grolsch, Kozel and Pilsner Urquell, as well as Asahi Super Dry and Peroni. Employing more than 10,000 people, it exports to 90 markets around the world, distributing millions of litres of beer every day.\n\nWith such a widespread international presence, sponsoring a global event like the Rugby World Cup makes perfect sense on paper, yet it is the profile of rugby union’s fanbase that carries particular appeal for AEI. Aside from its beer-thirsty yet generally good-natured following, the sport’s heartlands are found in several of the group’s key target markets, namely the UK and Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\nAs such, consumer-facing activations, such as point-of-sale promotions and ticket competitions, were largely geared towards those markets, in addition to the host country of France. And while the full impact of those activities will only become clear in time, the early signs are positive. In the UK, according to AEI’s own figures, sales of Asahi Super Dry hit a record high in the month of September, while market penetration rose two percentage points year-on-year, equivalent to 460,000 beer drinkers.\n\nAEI also saw record numbers of consumers enter to win match tickets and merchandise through on-pack promotions in all activating markets.\n\n“I think we had 100,000 people in the UK take part in the promotion to win tickets, which is not just a record for us, but I think it’s a record in the beer industry,” says McKenzie (above).\n\nWith a range of marketing rights at its disposal, AEI activated its Rugby World Cup sponsorship through digital channels, too. Presenting sponsorship of the first-ever official tournament podcast helped strengthen the connection and proved to be what McKenzie calls “the biggest social media touchpoint”; across 21 episodes over the course of the tournament, the podcast was downloaded over 830,000 times and generated 13.2 million views via online platforms. Asahi Super Dry also sponsored the tournament’s venue finder app, enabling spectators to find the nearest pubs televising live action – and serving the official beer, of course.\n\nWithin the nine host venues dotted throughout France, AEI served its eponymous lager brand as well as its alcohol-free offshoot, Asahi Super Dry 0.0%, which debuted internationally in early 2023. Sales in tournament venues were permitted after an exemption was granted by authorities in France, where a longstanding law prevents alcohol consumption and advertising inside sports stadiums. There were, however, supply issues early in the tournament, with disgruntled fans complaining of beer shortages and long wait times – a situation local organisers put down to unexpectedly high demand, even by rugby’s standards, and a historic heatwave that engulfed France during the opening matches.\n\nPresenting sponsorship of the first-ever official Rugby World Cup podcast helped strengthen Asahi’s connection with the event\n\nReflecting on those early challenges, McKenzie chooses his words carefully. He describes World Rugby as a “collaborative” partner that did its utmost to find a solution but notes that the global governing body remains “on a journey” towards becoming a commercial operation at the level of CFG, an organisation he says is “the most professional I’ve ever worked with”.\n\n“We find [World Rugby] supportive but there are learnings, there are things in this tournament that could have been done differently,” he adds. “I think they know that and we know that. Genuinely speaking, the fans have been happy, but there have been issues with some of the serving. There have been areas where the organisation wasn’t good enough.”\n\nNevertheless, once the service delivery issues were resolved, fans gulped Asahis with customary relish. Beer sales records were broken in seven of the host venues and attendance at fan zones, where Asahi Super Dry was also the only brew on tap, surpassed 1.15 million across the tournament. Those figures, coupled with the global exposure delivered by match broadcasts, only underlined the value of a large-scale sponsorship like the Rugby World Cup, which McKenzie says had two key objectives: to boost overall brand awareness and to increase consumer purchase consideration.\n\n“We put more value on the longer term with these large partnerships, versus other events which are more short term and you need to have a more short-term ROI,” he explains.\n\n“In beer, people have a repertoire of six to eight brands – you want to get in there. And we hope that by doing this a lot more people – rugby fans or people that have bought the beer – will put it in their repertoire next year, so that it will become a more regular purchase, which will raise the baseline sales. We would measure it next year with an expectation that the baseline sales of the brand have grown.”\n\nAround 1.15 million people attended the tournament’s official fan zones, where Asahi Super Dry was the only beer being served\n\nThat longer-term sales objective is a universal KPI across every partnership within AEI’s sports marketing portfolio, but its activations are dependent upon the core messaging at the heart of the brand being promoted. As McKenzie explains, alignment with pinnacle properties like Formula One and golf’s Ryder Cup, where Peroni served as an official supplier this year, is intended to position that brand as a premium accompaniment to “elevated experiences”, whereas Asahi Super Dry’s positioning is altogether different.\n\n“With Asahi, it’s more of an introduction to the world that Asahi is a social brand,” he continues. “We want people to come together and the Japanese heritage gives it a high degree of distinctiveness, particularly in Europe. If you think outside technology brands like cars or manufacturing, there are not too many consumer good Japanese brands which are scaled.\n\n“We want to focus on team sports, because the Japanese culture is very much about team as opposed to individual. And I think that socialising and respect is very important, which is also why rugby works. Rugby players beat the hell out of each other and then when it’s over, there’s a high degree of respect, which reflects Japan.”\n\nLooking ahead, McKenzie says the prospect of the next men’s Rugby World Cup taking place in Australia is an exciting one that warrants renewal talks. He also notes that the next two women’s editions – in England in 2025 and in Australia four years later – are set to be held in two of AEI’s core distribution markets, making the prospect of an extension all the more appealing.\n\nSo will Asahi return for another round?\n\n“We’ll sit down with World Rugby right after this tournament,” McKenzie says. “It’s definitely a consideration – I’d be lying if I said no.”"
