        "text": "It's been eight years since Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui told the media she'd had her period.\n\nFu, who had just missed the podium in the 4x100-metre medley relay women final at the 2016 Rio Games, coming in fourth, told China's state-run broadcaster CCTV (new window): Actually, my period started yesterday evening.\n\nThat's why I feel very weak and tired, but this is not an excuse. At the end of the day, I simply did not swim very well, Fu said, breaking taboos (new window) and the internet as she became an overnight social media sensation (new window) for her frankness.\n\nWATCH | Fu talks about her period:\n\nToday, the Paris Olympics touts itself as the first to achieve full gender parity (new window), with an equal number of female and male competitors. The Olympic Village has its first official nursery, and is also stocked with menstruation products (new window). The brand Always has been named the Games' 2024 official period product. Multiple marketing campaigns (new window) are encouraging athletes to talk about menstruation.\n\nMany athletes are, including U.S. rugby player Ilona Maher — who, in a TikTok video she posted Tuesday (new window), said she's not even expecting her period, but still brought like, 50 tampons, and five pairs of period panties to Paris.\n\nAnd then there's Canadian wrestler Linda Morais (new window), who recently told CTV (new window) that this year's Team Canada singlet has a dark red bottom, which she called a great idea, so that way girls are less self-conscious in case they're ever worried about a leak.\n\nBut even with more athletes talking about periods, we're still a long way from de-stigmatizing them and the challenges people who menstruate face in sports, Allison Sandmeyer-Graves, CEO of the national organization Canadian Women & Sport, told CBC News.\n\nThe stigma around periods is so strong, and it is so pervasive, that it is a really hard thing to change, Sandmeyer-Graves said.\n\nBut one of the only ways to change that is through conversation and really moving it from this thing that has for so long felt secret, and in some cases very shameful, into the light.\n\n'Rolling around on the floor in pain'\n\nPeriods in general have historically been taboo, and in sports they just weren't talked about — unless the conversation was about amenorrhea in young, female athletes, (new window) like gymnasts, due to a low body fat percentage, Michele Donnelly, a sport management associate professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., told CBC News.\n\nIt's kind of astonishing that it took until the 2020s to realize, 'Oh, it might be uncomfortable for women athletes to be in a sport where they're expected to wear white shorts or white bottoms while they're competing while they have their period,' Donnelly said.\n\nThere's a distraction of athletes thinking, 'Oh my gosh, will people know? Will I bleed through my shorts?'\n\nLISTEN | Speed skater Susan Auch talks periods (new window)\n\nSusan Auch, 58, a former national team Olympic speed skater and three-time Olympic medal winner, told CBC Radio's Information Morning Manitoba (new window) earlier this week that, in her past sport experience, it was super rare for athletes to talk about periods, even with each other.\n\nIt is an issue, right? It's difficult as an athlete, Auch said. I think it's great that a conversation is happening.\n\nFemale Olympians are often judged on their looks. Now, some are taking control of their image (new window)\n\nSome still think periods can sync up. That's why it's so important to debunk menstruation myths (new window)\n\nAuch, who represented Canada in speed skating for 17 years, says there were times her period affected her as an athlete. Once, at a Canadian championship, she says she pushed herself so hard in a race that she saw stars. Adding her period on top of that physical exertion was too much, she said.\n\nI was rolling around on the floor in pain. It was shocking to me.\n\nIn recent years, more athletes have started speaking out about menstruation, including French Olympic handball champion Estelle Nze Minko (new window)and Israel marathon runner Lonah Chemtai Salpeter, who said her cramps were so bad (new window) at the Tokyo Olympics that she had to stop to take a break during her race.\n\nWomen — we struggle sometimes with this kind of situation. Not every day is good for us because every month we receive this period and some ladies, they're OK with it, and some are not good with it, she said, according to Runners World (new window).\n\nWATCH | Why periods shoudn't be taboo:\n\nPeriods limit participation\n\nMost sports research has focused on men (new window). As such, there aren't a lot of studies that look specifically at the impact of menstruation on sports performance.\n\nOne study (new window), published in 2022 in the journal Science and Medicine in Football, found menstruation had a clear negative impact on performance in the 15 elite players the researchers interviewed, including fatigue and focus.\n\nIn another 2022 study (new window), Canadian Women & Sport found that 25 per cent of the 4,500 people surveyed said menstruation limits their sport participation. Studies also show (new window) that girls drop out of organized sport at more than twice the rate that boys do, and that menstruation is one of the biggest obstacles.\n\nTo adapt, some sports are making changes. For instance, women's soccer teams have been swapping out white shorts, as new research shows (new window) that women's teams who play in white perform worse. Last year, Team Canada's game kit (new window) at the Women's World Cup featured a new Nike product (new window) with a liner designed to limit period leaks.\n\nWhy period-proof kits could be a 'story within a story' at Women's World Cup (new window)\n\nExpert calls for better supports around menstrual health in youth sports (new window)\n\nAnd Wimbledon recently changed (new window) its white clothing rule for female tennis players, allowing black or dark-coloured undershorts to help players focus purely on their performance by relieving a potential source of anxiety.\n\nEven though Sandmeyer-Graves says she thinks it's unrealistic that the Paris Games will finally smash period taboos completely, she acknowledges that sports can play a huge role in making it more acceptable for people to acknowledge that they have periods and talk about what they need to be supported.\n\nWATCH | Not just a period:\n\nPart of that needs to be dismantling the pervasive belief among some female athletes that it's optimal to train so hard and eat so little that you stop having periods altogether, she said.\n\nThat condition, sometimes called exercise-induced amenorrhea, has been linked with (new window) cardiovascular disease and decreased bone health.\n\nWe know that sport can shift culture in really important ways, she said.\n\nA healthy period is part of a healthy body.\n\nWith files from CBC Information Morning Manitoba"
