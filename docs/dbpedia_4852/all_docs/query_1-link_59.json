A Czech anthology of his webcomic ‘The Sorrowful Putto of Prague’, the collection was published to critical acclaim and drew praise from Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson. Stafford is the author of the bestselling ‘Illustrated History of Rugby’ trilogy and the chart-topping ‘How Wales Best the Mighty All Blacks’. In 2023 he co-authored ‘Ragby’ (which was shortlisted for several prestigious Czech literary awards) and ‘Bleddyn’ a comic book retelling of Cardiff’s defeat of the 1953 All Blacks. In 2024 Stafford will publish ‘Unbelievable Underdogs and Rebellious Role Models: Sporting Heroes Who Defied the Odds and Shocked the World’. The book takes young readers on an emotional roller coaster through some of the greatest upsets and shocks in the history of world sport. Founder of cult rugby website The East Terrace, Stafford has written on sport for a wide range of print and online publications.\n\nRead full bio"
