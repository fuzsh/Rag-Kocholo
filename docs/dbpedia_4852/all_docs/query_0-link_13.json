        "text": "By Ryan Keating-Lambert\n\nPrague born KateÅ™inaâ€™s lust for life and appetite for experience is inspiring and addictive. She gives off a kind of infectious energy and is an essential drug for the dark winter months of Prague.. AND, sheâ€™s also the captain of a womenâ€™s rugby team. Check out the interview below to delve into her travels and the growing rugby scene in the Czech Republic. Take a moment to watch their kick-ass promo video tooâ€¦\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were a kid?\n\nA journalist or some kind of traveling job. I spent hours on my special little pink chair pretending I was on a train or plane.\n\nWhat sports did you do back then? How did you discover rugby?\n\nI played tennis for my entire childhood, my mum is a tennis trainer. I wanted to start playing some team sports and being a teenager I also wanted to play a sport that my parents didnâ€™t choose for me. And then I read an article about the first rugby club in Prague. It was very random when I think about it..\n\nYou recently went to Switzerland for the European trophy, tell me about that.\n\nWe went to the Swiss tournament not to win but to try our best against much better and older teams and get the experience of high level 15s rugby. But we found out that itâ€™s actually possible for us to win after intensive preparation! We trained together just a couple of times before going to Switzerland and that was our biggest problem, especially in the technical parts of the game like in line-outs or scrums where you need to spend a lot of time and training. However, the tournament was great motivation for us and a kick off for (hopefully) a brighter future for Czech womenâ€™s 15s rugby.\n\nHow do Czechs generally respond to rugby? Is it becoming more popular?\n\nRecently rugby is gaining popularity due to the Rugby World Cup that is broadcasted by CT. Rugby is a very attractive sport to watch and even people that donâ€™t know the rules can watch and learn something. People are usually either curious or totally freaked out when I tell them that I actually play rugby. I usually try to postpone that info until later in a conversation, just because people never look at me the same way after they find out Iâ€™m a womenâ€™s rugby player.\n\nI heard you also studied in the US for some time?\n\nYes, I studied film production in Santa Monica College and spent two years on the west coast. I had my dream beach life, but it is good to be back in Prague ðŸ™‚\n\nFilm production sounds cool, do you have a favourite movie?\n\nWritten by Ryan Keating-Lambert. Photos from KateÅ™ina PokornÃ¡"
