Their final match was on September 1 against the 32nd ranked Czech Republic National team at the Rugby Club Mountfield Říčany. The team faced it’s the greatest challenge of the tour losing 24-10 and ending the tour with a 2-1 record.\n\nPrior to the team leaving the extended USA Rugby South squad was published. The articles included photos and interviews, along with some of the cultural aspects of the tour.\n\nThis article is the concluding one of the tour and includes rugby tour interviews along with cultural aspects of the tour as seen through photos.\n\nFor team members and the coaching staff, the tour will have lifetime memories. That certainly can’t be captured in an article or through photos, but a glimpse of what was experienced should be of interest to many.\n\nInterviews\n\nKevin Kitto, President USARS\n\nRene Daniel, Head Coach USARS discusses the Czech Republic match & tour with Pete Redmond\n\nAlexandra Zitkova, Czech Republic Women’s National Team\n\nDavid Coleman, Fullback/Wing USARS\n\nHein Eramus, Captain USARS\n\nFavorite USARS Song\n\nPhotos\n\nGuillermo Baistrocchi Photos Below\n\nOther Articles"
