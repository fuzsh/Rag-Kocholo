        "text": "Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola will hate the idea, but the Premier League may have missed a trick failing to arrange a High Noon kick-off this Sunday.\n\nDarwin Núñez demonstrated why Erling Haaland is not the only gunslinger in the north west, his two stunning goals in the Czech Republic whetting the appetite for what the sharpshooters might produce at Anfield.\n\nIf Haaland considers himself the sheriff among modern day strikers, Núñez embraces being an outlaw; feted and wanted by many, still viewed suspiciously by others. His rebellious streak in front of goal certainly disregards the rules of orthodoxy.\n\nThe latest exhibit for the Núñez museum of the weird and wonderful built the kind of commanding 5-1 lead which means Sparta Prague will need a miracle to prevent Klopp reaching his sixth European quarter-final as Liverpool manager.\n\nNúñez’s evening began by missing a sitter, fluffing a one-on-one after dribbling around the keeper and miskicking towards goal. What made the performance ‘typical’ Núñez is what followed.\n\nHis first on 25 minutes was a vicious dipper from 25 yards, catching goalkeeper Peter Vindahl so off guard he had begun diving to the west as the ball landed in the east.\n\nThat was eclipsed by a gorgeous Núñez volley on the stroke of half-time, the pass from Alexis Mac Allister ensuring the striker never broke stride before pistolling past Vindahl in the one corner of the net beyond his reach.\n\nHaving celebrated at the corner flag, Núñez turned to acknowledge his supplier, who had earlier stroked Liverpool ahead on five minutes after earning a penalty.\n\nWhere Haaland has Kevin De Bruyne loading those bullets, Núñez is developing the same relationship with Mac Allister, an intuitive understanding which means only a nod and a wink is required for the midfielder to weight the perfect delivery. They are the Smith and Wesson of Liverpool and Manchester.\n\nIn their strategy meetings, Klopp and Guardiola know that stopping the manufacturer is the best prevention of the end product.\n\nNúñez is improving by the week. He has been Haaland’s considerable shadow in terms of the weight of goal numbers, but not in the fashion in which they come. Asked for the secret of the last few weeks’ improvement, Klopp offered a pointed response.\n\n“You mean months,” he said. “Wonderful guy, wonderful boy. He has quality coming out of his ears to be honest. Is he at his absolute peak in general? Not now for us. But can he develop? Yes. Is he a threat all the time? Yes. When he’s not scoring he for us is incredibly important as he is a constant threat and gives us spaces in areas and options.”\n\nGiven the wild, end-to-end nature of the first leg, it was probably inevitable a free spirit such as Núñez would leave his mark. That guaranteed the ideal build to Sunday’s showdown.\n\n“The priority is always the next game,” suggested Klopp beforehand. True, but when your final meeting with City as Liverpool manager is on the horizon – a fixture monumentally consequential to the title race – you can be forgiven for thinking ahead.\n\nKlopp’s management screamed of forward planning; Mohamed Salah returned for 15 minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai played most of the second half and scored the fifth; Virgil van Dijk replaced Ibrahima Konaté shortly after half-time, too, although in more worrying circumstances.\n\nEvery game seems to bring another injury and this was no exception, Konaté pulling up in the build up to what ultimately proved a late consolation when Conor Bradley sliced a cross past Caoimhin Kelleher. Klopp later said Konaté’s immediate withdrawal was more of a precaution, albeit further checks will be needed.\n\nDespite the emphatic final score, Liverpool were vulnerable in the first half, requiring three world-class Kelleher saves.\n\n“Yes, the result is much better than the performance,” Klopp acknowledged. “We were not coming here thinking it would be a walk in the park. Sparta took risks and we punished them and scored wonderful goals.”\n\nThe difference – as has so often been the case all season – was the brutality of their finishing, Luis Díaz snuffing out any chance of a Sparta comeback.\n\nNúñez, so often ridiculed for the chances he missed, is instead representative of the prowess in the final third. He has sixteen already this season – one more than his debut campaign – transforming himself from wild card to ace in Klopp’s pack.\n\nJust like Haaland, he is proving himself worth every penny and maybe a few dollars more."
