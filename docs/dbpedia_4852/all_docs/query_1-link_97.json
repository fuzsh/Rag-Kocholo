        "text": "Czech President Petr Pavel said he was “shocked” by the violence and expressed “deep regret and sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the victims”.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen denounced “the senseless violence of the shooting that claimed several lives today.”\n\nThere are more than 800,000 firearms of all categories registered among 300,000 gun permit holders in the country, which has a population of about 10.5 million people, writes Ella Nunn.\n\nIt is one of the only nations in the world - and the only one in Europe - that provides the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nConcealed-carry permits for self-defence can be obtained by Czech citizens without presenting specific reasons and recreational shooting is one of the most popular sports in the country.\n\nPetr Nedoma, director of the Rudolfinum Gallery at a concert hall across Palach Square, told Czech TV he saw the shooter.\n\n“I saw a young person on the gallery who had some weapon in his hand, like and automatic weapon, and shooting toward the Manes Bridge. Repeatedly, with some interruptions, then I saw as he shot, put hands up and threw the weapon down on the street, it lay there on the pedestrian crossing,” he said.\n\nPolice with submachine guns were seen outside a family home in the village of Hostouň, in the Kladno region, northwest of Prague, writes James Crisp.\n\nOfficers in the area, some 13 miles from the Czech capital, announced they were hunting a man in connection with the violent death of another man at the address.\n\nLocal media have linked the incident to the shooter in Prague, which police have not denied, and suggested he went to the capital from the village before launching his attack.\n\nA newlywed British couple have told the Press Association of the moment a police officer ordered them to stay down during a mass shooting in central Prague.\n\nTom Leese, 34, a video producer and his wife Rachael, 31, an account director, who are on their honeymoon in the country, were having a drink in the Slivovitz Museum, close to where the shooting occurred.\n\nMr Leese said: “A policeman came in and started shouting loudly in what I assume was Czech. I asked for it in English and he said there was an active shooter and to stay inside and stay down.”\n\nHe added: “The staff were very calm, turned all the lights off very quickly and urged us to stay calm, the restaurant was relatively quiet. The policeman left urgently and we stood in the corner of the restaurant.”\n\nThe couple, from Merstham in Surrey, were kept in the the museum for over an hour, hearing sirens outside.\n\nMr Leese said: “Rachael is still in shock. With everyone else being so calm it didn’t seem real to me.”\n\nPrague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda has told broadcasters:\n\n“The thing is, of course, a tragedy, it is a tragedy that occurs in the modern world. We know very well that for a number of years we have been hearing from the United States that there has been an excess of some shooter shooting in a school or on the street or somewhere. We have always thought that this is a matter that does not concern Europe and us, that this is a matter that is also a given in the United States due to the fact that everyone there is armed, etc.\n\n“Now, unfortunately, it turns out that our world is also changing and we have the problem of the individual shooter whose reasons for what he does are not entirely clear. And the worst thing about it is that these are things that cannot be solved preventively,”\n\nPavel Nedoma, the director of Rudolfinum Gallery, which also is located in the square, told Czech public television he saw from a window a person who was shooting from a gun toward the nearby Mánes bridge across the Vltava River.\n\nHe said: “Upstairs on the walkway of the Faculty of Arts, I saw a man standing with a gun in his hand and shooting towards the Mánes bridge. Then he put his hands up and threw the gun towards the road, it remained lying by the philosophy faculty. Then a lot of people appeared upstairs, I don’t know if it was the police. I left the window and watched the police evacuate people from the Faculty of Philosophy, taking them away with their hands behind their heads in different directions, a large number of cars, people running around.”\n\nThe Czech president Petr Pavel has said he is “shocked” by Prague university shootings.\n\n“I am shocked by the events... I would like to express my deep regret and sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the victims claimed by the shooting,” Mr Pavel, who is winding up a two-day visit to Paris on Thursday, said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAn email to staff at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University, seen and reported by Reuters, had said a shooter was in one of its buildings and had told staff to “stay put”.\n\n“Don’t go anywhere, if you’re in the offices, lock them and place furniture in front of the door, turn off the lights,” the email said.\n\nPrague police say several people are dead following the shooting, adding the gunman has been “eliminated”.\n\n“The gunman was eliminated!!! The building is currently being evacuated and there are several dead and dozens of wounded people on the scene,” police said on X, formerly known as Twitter."
