        "text": "A group of Holocaust survivors have travelled to Prague to recreate a photo that was taken of them back in August 1945, when they were just children.\n\nThe original photo - known as 'The Boys' - shows 732 children who survived the Holocaust, but who lost their parents.\n\nThis is the original picture...\n\nThe group of 732 survivors became known as 'The Boys', even though there were in fact 80 girls in the group as well.\n\nThey were photographed next to the Jan Hus Memorial in Old Town Square in Prague, Czech Republic, where the memorial still stands to this day.\n\nThis is the recreation, taken 74 years later on 12 May 2019...\n\nIt features around 250 people - seven of whom appeared in the original picture as young children and who are now in their 80s and 90s.\n\nAfter 'The Boys' was taken, the youngsters were flown to the UK on RAF planes from Prague to start new lives in Britain, beginning at a hostel near Windermere in the Lake District\n\nAfter World War Two, the British government had agreed to allow 1,000 orphaned child survivors of the Nazi concentration camps into the UK, but only 732 could be found.\n\nOne of the children said: \"We came from hell to paradise.\"\n\nThe children stayed in touch with each other throughout their lives and reunited in the exact spot where they gathered 74 years ago having survived World War Two.\n\nWhile on this return visit to Prague, the group made an emotional trip to Theresienstadt concentration camp, from where many of 'The Boys' had been liberated at the end of World War Two. A special dinner was also held to honour them."
