        "text": "😎 First, I just think it's incredibly cool seeing Snoop Dogg in my LinkedIn feed 🤙 📷 Many have said that seeing Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg together, at the Olympics, is surprising, but to me, it makes perfect sense. While they may seem like an unlikely pair to some, their friendship and collaboration reveal deeper commonalities that I think many people overlook. 💥 Both Martha and Snoop are self-made founders/entrepreneurs who have built their brands from the ground up. Martha👩🍳 transformed her passion for cooking and homemaking into a media empire – in fact she’s about to publish cookbook number 100! Snoop💿 turned his music career into a diverse business portfolio. Their stories about both success and failure demonstrate resilience, creativity, and the ability to reinvent themselves, key traits for any successful entrepreneur. 🦄 The Martha and Snoop friendship shows us that successful entrepreneurs often think outside the box and see potential where others might not. They embrace collaboration, innovation, and the breaking down of traditional boundaries. It's not about fitting into a mold; it's about creating your own path and finding synergy in unexpected places. 🙌 So, next time you think you see an unlikely pairing, consider the hidden similarities that might drive their success. Entrepreneurs like Martha and Snoop demonstrate that with the right mindset, diverse backgrounds and skill sets can come together to create something amazing. #venturecapital #innovation #startups #creativity #digitalmarketing Portola Valley Partners\n\nWhat’s that rhyme ‘Rain Rain go away come back another day’ might as well have started to build the ARK, what a week of it, anyway enough of the British weather. Last Saturday saw Richard and I ride our current longest bike ride, all 128miles of it, quite the ride and great preparation for what we have coming up at the end of the month. All in the aid of celebrating a certain person’s 50th (You know who you are, the guilty party) I could think of better ways to celebrate but riding round Belgium seems to be what we are doing, at least we can share a few beers made by those mad Belgium monks who see nothing more than about 15% proof like water. Lessons learnt from that ride and endurance sports as a whole, and defiantly pliable to your life and work, you have dark/bad moments call them what you will but they happen, you question why the hell you are doing these stupid things/the purpose of your job etc, and then a smiling face comes back for you with good will and cheer, it takes a little while but you gradually get back to some sort or semblance and back at it you are. You need these people, that person in your life, the genuine ones that have your back. This week’s message is ‘Sometimes you’re the HAMMER and sometimes you’re the NAIL’. But trust me a majority of the time you’ll be the HAMMER! Let’s hope we see some sun as all this rain is making Jack a dull boy. Enjoy whatever it is you are up to. #experience #health #life #WORK #helpinghand #salesandmarketing #marketresearch #mentaltoughness\n\nI was up in Koscozco National Park today to run the Kosci Ultra (50km). The video link below is of the start. 3000 runners, and their supporters drove thousands of kilometres (me) and poured many thousands of dollars into the Jindabyne community, in their off season, when they normally don't make any money. And on a Thursday, with everyone needing to take multiple days off work. 3000 runners, and their families, took a whole week off work to attend the event, in the middle of nowhere. The event offers 27km, 50km. 100km and 100mile, so it is spread over 5 days. I have mentioned this before but events, and especially extreme events, are taking over and capturing a large percentage of the Australian population, at least those that are attracted to extreme events. They blend a great product, with amazing scenery, often in national parks. Event managers, and operators, have become expert at providing a high quality product for participants. You get your fix, and you get to drive away with no requirements. I have said it before, but physical activity events are taking over from what sports clubs used to offer. Society has morphed into something else, and in my opinion the sports model hasn't been able to adapt (in most cases) to what people want. Events have done that. #events #running Brad Billett Martyn Hancock Rochelle Eime Dr Lindsey Reece John Tower https://lnkd.in/gq2E8S-w\n\nIn a world often focused on winning at all costs, this story of true integrity stands out. During the Burlada Cross Country race in Spain on December 2, 2012, Kenyan runner Abel Mutai was leading the race when he mistakenly stopped short of the finish line, thinking he had already crossed it. Spanish runner Iván Fernández, who was right behind Mutai, saw what had happened. Instead of seizing the opportunity to take first place, Iván chose to do something extraordinary. He shouted at Mutai to keep going, but Mutai didn’t understand Spanish. Realizing this, Iván gently guided Mutai to the finish line, ensuring he secured the victory he rightfully earned. When asked why he didn’t take advantage of the situation, Iván replied, “He was going to win. The race was his.” He added, “What would be the merit of my victory? What would be the honor in that medal?” Iván Fernández’s actions remind us that true victory isn’t just about crossing the finish line first. It’s about integrity, respect, and helping others to achieve their best. This story teaches us that the values we pass on—honesty, ethics, and compassion—are far more important than the accolades we might gain. As the world turns its attention to the Olympics and sports are a hot topic, let’s remember and share stories like these that highlight the essence of true character. This isn’t just about sportsmanship; it’s about the values that define us as human beings. Let’s inspire each other to build a community where we push and help each other to succeed. Because in the end, true winning is about lifting others up. #Olympics #Compassion #Integrity #Inspiration #Values #Running #Kindness #TrueCharacter\n\n⁠Annette's journey as an equestrian is a tale of passion, ambition, and resilience. Born and raised in the Netherlands, she found herself drawn to the world of horses, despite her parents not sharing the same interest. Her natural affinity for equestrian sports quickly turned into a competitive pursuit. ⁠ ⁠ Driven by her fierce competitive spirit, Annette excelled in local competitions, demonstrating her talent and dedication.⁠ ⁠ However, the transition to the international arena presented unforeseen challenges for Annette. Holding dual nationality, Dutch and Greek, she seized the opportunity to compete internationally for Greece. ⁠ ⁠ This leap into a larger, more competitive field proved to be a significant turning point. The shift from local to international competitions was daunting, leading to a drastic drop in her results. ⁠ ⁠ These challenges, however, did not dampen Annette's spirit. Instead, they became a catalyst for self-reflection and growth. Here are three tips on how self-reflection can help tackle such challenges:⁠ ⁠ Understanding Your Weaknesses: Through self-reflection, Annette gained insights into areas where she needed improvement. Acknowledging weaknesses is the first step towards turning them into strengths 🌱.⁠ ⁠ Setting Realistic Goals: Reflecting on her experiences allowed Annette to set more realistic and achievable goals for her international competitions. This approach helps in maintaining motivation and focus, even in the face of setbacks 🎯.⁠ ⁠ Learning from Failures: Annette used self-reflection to analyze her failures, not as defeats, but as learning opportunities. Understanding what went wrong and how to improve for the next competition is crucial for growth and development 📈.⁠ ⁠ @annette_paterakis⁠ ⁠ #Bridl #BuyWithBridl #ShowJumping #FairTrade #Ethical #Trust #Business #Transparency #Equestrian #EquestrianLife #Equine #HorseLife #HorseLover #Horses #HorseLove #BuyAHorse #BuyAHorseWithBridl\n\nI am fond of analyzing the Japanese food diet, more seafood than red meat. Is this the winning diet of the Japanese Men Volleyball Team? They placed 3rd in the Volleyball Nation League Tournament last year. A Third placer in Global ranking in sports which is dominated by 2 meter tall players, the Japanese middle blocker are the only 2 meters in height, the rest can jump a 3 meter height attack, Yuki, Nishida, Ran and Miyaura. Special mention for Yamamoto, the Libero warrior who is not afraid to weaponize his shoulders, chest and arms to face the ball speed of 100 km/hr. Of course, I will NOT tell you my observation of the game strategy of the Japanese Team but they love their Foreign Coach, Sensei. Sekita is the Brain of the Team, The Setter. In the absence of our Team in the VNL, most Asians are fans of Japanese Volleyball Men's Team. We are Japanese too. Je' sui Japan. How does it feel to be a Fan? You are possessive, obsessive and ready to defend against bashers. A Fan has invisible rights, do you know what is? The right to be imposter, the Players who just won the game or championship. Therefore, I want to support our National Team so I can be a Fan. But, I want to advise our Philippine Volleyball Team, Men and Women, please take lessons from Master Hiro. We eat like Pigs, no wonder gravity pulled your weight mass even harder. You can't jump too high because of the weight of the fat mass dragging you down quickly, you can't block taller players as well. There is a timing in blocking, those who can jump higher have the speed to capture that timing aftet the ball was hit at a certain elevation and the distance of the ball to the net. *** Thai, Indonesians and Vietnamese eat lots of veggies. Fishes have Omega 3 which is good for the brain. By eating Octopus tentacles, your arms and hands may reach and stretch-out to the ball no matter the distance between. Diet matters for Sports Men/Women. Sacrifice your desires to eat roasted lechon, lechon kawali, crispy pata, steak and so on. Only when you win a game that you are permitted the luxury."
