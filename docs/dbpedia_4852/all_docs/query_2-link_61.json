We visited during the day for food and was so nice. We decided to return for the band and so glad we did. They were just amazing. We had so much fun! Would 100% recommend here.\n\nmessie\n\nLively bar - good fun Very lively bar. Some great music and a good craic. We were very much looked after by our favourite Irish barman Tom. Thank you for the interesting shots ü•¥üç∫\n\nNeil K\n\nGreat guinness In Prague over the Christmas period and with the snow falling heavily my twin brother Stephen and I dropped into The Dubliner Irish Bar ,been here many times over the years ,always had a great time and so it proved on our latest visit.I love the look of this bar ,it's quite a big ,multi roomed bar ,a solid wood serving bar dominates the main room,pubby decor and furnishings ,sports memorabilia adorns the walls,pool tables and big screens to enjoy the sport plus lots of seating options ,it's a great bar to chill out in.We were here on a bitterly cold December night ,this bar was absolutely packed ,standing room only ,we ordered and were served pints of guinness ,these were poured in the correct manner even allowing time for the all important settle ,we chilled out and soaked up the great vibe in this busy and popular bar.My guinness was really good ,a thick ,creamy and most importantly iced cold guinness and bursting with taste ,it was just so good being in such a great bar enjoying a quality guinness.We both really enjoyed our guinness in here and the great vibe so much so that we ended up staying for another guinness each before we moved on and as on every other visit to here we had a marvellous time.The Dubliner Irish Bar is easy to locate on Tyn,just off Old Town Square ( Staromestske Namesti ) Opening hours are;Monday to Thursday,9am till 2 am.Friday to Sunday,9am till 3am.A wonderful pub in a great location and well worth checking out if you're in the area.\n\nErika S\n\nBellissimo locale in pieno centro storico Locale fantastico, personale accogliente e birra ottima! Tra i pi√π bei locali di Praga in pieno centro. Abbiamo soggiornato li vicino per qualche giorno, sempre pieno di musica e giovani.\n\nmichelle m\n\nWell worth a visit Excellent food live music every night brilliant atmosphere great staff close to astronomical clock in old town\n\nDarles Chickens\n\nAn oasis of warmth in a desert of division In my opinion Cormac is the jewel in the crown that is The Dubliner. His bartending skills and attentiveness to customers are only matched by his good-humour and top-shelf banter. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He even agreed to put a dash of cassis in my Guinness (although as he is a Cork native he felt the need to let me know that he thought this was sinful). When I eventually left The Dubliner (refreshed but able) it was Cormac who ran after me to return my travel copy of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs De Profundis, which had fallen out of my coat pocket on my way to the exit. He is a true gent and I hope to spend time in his company again soon.As Mr Wilde would say - when you really want to feel like you are welcome and belong, you will find it waiting for you at The Auld Dubliner. Solid 9 out of 10, would attend again\n\nMaria M\n\nProper Irish Pub Went here for dinner on our first night in Prague. I had the dubliner burger with cheese and fries which was very tasty. My mum had the spaghetti bolognese, that she found a bit dry and could have used more sauce.\n\nCarmel205\n\nLoved it! üáÆüá™ Went here for lunch and to watch the Ireland/Italy rugby match. Lovely food, you won't be hungry afterwards! Great atmosphere, lovely staff! I would definitely recommend!\n\nFredrik G\n\nIf you are looking for a place to spend a few hours Great place! Good food and awesome serviceüëå fair prices for being in that part of town. Live music as well!If you go make sure to try a shot called green tea üëç"
