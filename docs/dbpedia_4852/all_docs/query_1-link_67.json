        "text": "Jake Paul has predicted a \"scary\" and \"violent\" fight when he meets Mike Tyson in the boxing ring in November.\n\n'The Problem Child' has racked up an impressive 10-1 record since switching YouTube for pugilism in 2020, beating a number of former UFC contenders and champions like Nate Diaz, Tyron Woodley, Anderson Silva and Ben Askren. The 27-year-old was initially set to fight Tyson last month, but medical concerns on the 58-year-old legend's behalf forced the bout to be delayed until November 15.\n\nStill eager to fight in July, Paul instead faced BKFC star Mike Perry, securing a sixth-round TKO victory and adding to his almost flawless record. With a bout with Tyson now green-lighted once more, Paul expects fireworks in the ring when the two finally clash.\n\nAsked about if he's going to try to knock Tyson out by barber Vic Collins on his Deepcut YouTube channel, Paul said: \"Yeah 100%. I mean, if he has the opportunity to do it to me then he's going to take it. He doesn't give a f*** about me - I'm sure he likes me but at the end of the day, when the bell rings and we're in a real pro fight in front of 80,000 people. If you think for one second that Mike Tyson's not trying to rip my head off, you're crazy.\n\n\"You don't play boxing, I'm not in there to mess around. And that's what he wanted, and so if that's what the legend wants, and he wants to end me in a vicious way, then I'm going in there with that same mindset and I want to be tested. I know that's going to happen, it's not going to be easy.\"\n\nHowever, Paul doesn't expect to see either man finished when the two meet in the squared-circle, insisting that it's going to be 'violent' for the distance. He added: \"And I don't see a world where I knock him out or her knocks me out, I think it's going to be violent the whole way through. I think there's going to be a lot of close rounds and I think it's just going to come down to on the night who wants it more.\"\n\nPaul also noted that while 'Iron Mike' \"has the advantage\" in a number of areas, he'll be able to capitalise in areas where he feels stronger. He went on: \"In terms of experience and power and weight he has the advantage, but in terms of youth, speed and I guess my footwork - being on the outside - my athleticism currently, I have the advantage. So to me it's really an even match-up and that's scary but also exciting at the same time.\"\n\nArguably one of history's greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, Tyson became undisputed by retaining his WBA and WBC belts and winning the IBF strap after beating Tony Tucker via unanimous decision in August 1987 - defending his collection six times before being shockingly bested by Buster Douglas in 1990.\n\nAfter two decades of wars with the likes of Frank Bruno, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Michael Spinks, Tyson retired from the professional scene with a record of 50-6 in 2005, with 44 knockouts to his name. His last outing came in the form of a 2020 exhibition bout with Roy Jones Jr which was scored as a split-draw after eight rounds."
