        "text": "It’s our highly personalised approach to learning that helps foster ambition and achievement in every student.\n\nWe take great care over the quality of education we provide and have robust systems in place to ensure our students achieve outstanding exam results, opening pathways to the universities and careers of their choice. In fact, Nord Anglia students consistently outperform those from other schools in every international examination.\n\nAlso, the curricula we offer are respected all over the world, from the International Early Years Curriculum to GCSEs and the International Baccalaureate Diploma and others. This means your child has access to a world-leading education and can go on to study anywhere in the world.\n\nGreat teachers want to work at Nord Anglia schools – so we’re able to choose from the very best.\n\nAt Nord Anglia, we attract and hire the world’s best teachers – and support them in their development and in teaching exciting, innovative learning materials that challenge and intrigue our students. To refine their skills, our teachers carry out annual professional development programmes, learning about the latest discoveries and educational practices from subject experts. They also take classes and courses offered through our unique collaborations with MIT and The Juilliard School, so they’re always ready to bring something new to the classroom.\n\nOur global education team and advisory board are led by world-renowned academics and pioneers to ensure our offering inspires young minds. We continually invest in our teachers and offer development programmes that are second to none. All of this makes sure we’re always innovating, and that our quality assurance and safeguarding measures are first class.\n\nIn our schools, your child’s learning goes far beyond the classroom. Our transformative programmes, collaborations, and experiences nurture our students’ talents, unlock their potential, and inspire them to go further than they ever thought possible.\n\nOur expeditions are designed to broaden our students' perspectives and expose them to different cultures, people, and ideas. Your child will have access to global, regional, and local opportunities – and the chance to dig deep within themselves to find resilience and develop their leadership capability. At the same time, they’ll make lifelong friendships with people from all over the world.\n\nEach year, about 2,000 Nord Anglia students travel to our camp in Arusha, Tanzania, to work on the practical tasks of building and maintaining school and village accommodation. At our centre in Les Martinets, Switzerland, students undertake a week’s mountaineering and outdoor activity in self-led teams to overcome basic challenges such as cooking and navigation. Experiences like these – and many others – help to develop self-reliance and teamwork as well as an understanding of the lives and challenges of others.\n\nEducation has the power to change the world, which is why we help our students develop the creativity and resilience they need to make the world a better place. We’re dedicated to encouraging students to become global change-makers – ready to take on the world’s most pressing problems.\n\nWe know our students want to make their mark on the world, and we work hard to help empower them. Our global partnership with UNICEF helps open our students’ eyes to the world around them and encourages them to develop their own sense of purpose. Each year, our students support hundreds of local causes through activities with UNICEF and on the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn top of that, we encourage our students to deliver meaningful change through local outreach activities through our Share A Dream programme, where they can join fundraising and volunteering activities on issues they truly care about.\n\nWhen you choose a Nord Anglia school, you and your child become part of a global community of students, parents, teachers and alumni, opening up a world of opportunities.\n\nFrom Boston to Beijing, Hanoi to Hyderabad, and Dubai to Dublin, our diverse global community stretches across borders. We make sure that every child learns alongside students from different cultures and can make friendships that last a lifetime.\n\nThrough Global Campus, our online learning platform, students work together across the globe. They develop a broader perspective on life and learn to appreciate different points of view. It’s just one of the ways our students become responsible global citizens who are confident in our diverse, multicultural world. Students from our schools can meet up at regional events, connect through shared interests and experiences, and embrace diversity as a normal part of life.\n\nWhen your child joins a Nord Anglia school, you become part of the community, too. All our schools value their parent community and work to make sure parents are a key part of school life. That includes making sure parents are kept closely in touch with their child’s learning and development. We stay in regular contact to make sure that your Nord Anglia experience is the best it can be.\n\nOur network of alumni are also ready to share their experiences to inspire those who come after them. As they transition from school to university or the first years of their career, your child will be able to draw on the pathways and connections of our Nord Anglia alumni to support them in whatever they want to do in the future.\n\nWe bring your child’s learning to life with both world-class technology-enabled learning and school facilities that ignite their imagination. Our learning spaces and technology are designed to give students the best education possible – one that’s fit for the future.\n\nEach of our schools can seamlessly offer a Virtual School Experience, so there’s a smooth transition between class-based and ‘home or away’ learning if need be. Virtual schooling is safe and secure, ensuring your child’s learning will be uninterrupted. It also benefits from a wealth of curated content drawing on the shared expertise of our 10,000 world-class teachers.\n\nIn this world of rapid change, we’re always looking for new ways of unlocking students’ learning. That’s why we’re reimagining education as we know it by creating a teacher-led, technology-enabled school environment that will allow us to personalise the learning journey like never before."
