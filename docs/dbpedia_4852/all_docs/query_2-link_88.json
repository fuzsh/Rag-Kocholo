        "text": "Foreign minister Penny Wong said she is \"shocked and saddened\" after a lone gunman opened fire in a university building in central Prague.\n\nThe gunman killed at least 14 people and injured more than 25 in the Czech Republic's worst mass shooting, police and the city's rescue service said.\n\nThe bloodshed took place in the philosophy department building of Charles University, where the shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said.\n\nThe gunman - a 24-year-old student - also died, authorities said.\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by the mass shooting at Charles University in Prague,\" Wong said on X.\n\n\"I send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, their loved ones and the Czech people.\n\n\"Hoping for a speedy recovery for those injured.\"\n\nVondrášek had previously said that at least 15 people had died.\n\nHe said that of the 25 injured, 10 were in a serious condition.\n\nWhat we know about shooter\n\nNamed as David K, the 24-year-old behind the killing of more than 15 people is said by police to have left the village of Hostoun 20 kilometres west of Prague, after shooting his father, the BBC reports.\n\nHe had been a student at Charles University's Institute of World History based at the arts faculty.\n\nPolice say he was due to attend a lecture on Thursday afternoon in a separate university building just off Prague's Old Town Square. Officers had gone there looking for him before the shooting took place.\n\nVondrasek said he had gone to Prague to take his life and that he was \"inspired by a horrific event, a similar event, abroad\".\n\nVondrasek said that based on a search of his home, the gunman was also suspected in the killing of another man and his two-month-old daughter December 15, in the east of Prague.\n\nThere are reports he was inspired by a December 7 shooting in Russia, when a 14-year-old girl took a shotgun into her school and killed a fellow student before turning the gun on herself.\n\nCzech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said a large cache of weapons have been found at the university building.\n\n\"We could have had high tens of victims without a quick police response,\" Rakusan added.\n\nAustralian describes shooting horror\n\nOne Australian expat who lives in London and was visiting central Prague at the time of the attack and told Today this morning how he and his partner fled after panic unfolded.\n\n\"My partner and I were just sitting in a bar not too far. 100m, 150m down from the university.\n\n\"We actually didn't hear anything or see anything at first. But after we saw people scurrying away and paying their bills we didn't feel right.\n\n\"That is when we quickly realised there were some people quickly leaving the area and we noticed that something wasn't okay.\n\n\"I had just received a message from a good mate of mine in London at the moment and he said: 'Are you OK? 'We heard there is a shooting in Prague\".\n\n\"That is when we hit the panic button and scurried back to the hotel and flipped the news on and it kicked in from there.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese told Today Australians who had friends or relatives visiting Prague should contact the Department of Foreign Affairs for details on their wellbeing.\n\n\"It is such a wonderful city, Prague, to see those devastating scenes will a real concern for those Australians who have family or might have friends and family members travelling to Prague at this time.\"\n\nAustralians can get information if they have family or friends in Central Europe by contacting the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1300 555 135.\n\nPolice received tips about gunman\n\nAuthorities received tips about a 24-year-old philosophy student at Charles University who they suspect was responsible for the deadly mass shooting, Vondrášek said in a news conference.\n\nThe police chief said the information he has received so far indicates that the shooter took his own life after the attack, but that this is not yet confirmed. He said the suspect has not been formally identified because of the severity of his injuries.\n\nVondrášek said authorities had information about the student prior to the incident, saying they received a tip saying he was travelling from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague with the intention to take his own life. Shortly after that, they received information that a man believed to be the suspect's father was found dead in Hostouň.\n\nVondrášek said police were aware the suspected shooter had a lecture at 2pm. local time (12am Thursday AEDT) and had evacuated the building where the lecture was meant to take place.\n\nPolice then received a call about a shooting in a different building on campus, according to the police chief.\n\nThe shooter had a gun permit and owned several weapons, according to Vondrášek.\n\nStudents hid on ledge of university\n\nStudents at Charles University climbed out of classroom windows and hid on the ledge of the Faculty of Arts building during the shooting.\n\nSome jumped from the ledges to lower levels before they were rescued by police.\n\nOthers locked themselves in rooms and some barricaded the doors with large desks.\n\nOne academic described the desperate scenes to local media.\n\n\"We stayed inside, stayed the door with all the - you know, away from the doors. We barricaded the door .\"\n\nTourist heard 'rifle shots'\n\nBritish tourist Simon Godwin, a former soldier and police officer, told Today this morning he was walking with his wife on the nearby Charles Bridge with other visitors to the Czech capital when the shooting unfolded.\n\nHe said he heard loud bangs he initially thought were fire crackers but later identified as rifle shots.\n\n\"What my concern was that if it had been a terrorist attack .. if there had been on either side of the bridge, the only escape route was jumping to the river.\"\n\nTerrorism link not suspected\n\nPolice previously said they have not formally identified the deceased shooter due to the severity of their injuries, but that they are suspected to be a 24-year-old student at the school.\n\nCzech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said investigators did not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups.\n\nPavel Nedoma, the director of the nearby Rudolfinum Gallery, said he saw from a window a person standing on a balcony of the building and shooting a gun.\n\nPolice were still searching the area, including the building's balconies, for possible explosives.\n\nThe building, which was evacuated, forms part of the square and faces a bridge across the river with a view of Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency.\n\nPresident Petr Pavel said he was \"shocked\" by what happened and offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims.\n\nWhere tourists, students and others would normally be enjoying the view of the iconic monument instead reflected chaos and terror yesterday afternoon (early this morning AEDT).\n\nPolice vehicles and ambulances sped across the bridge with their sirens wailing to reach the empty square, which was sealed off by officers.\n\n- With AP, CNN"
