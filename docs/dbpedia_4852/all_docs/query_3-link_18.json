The organiser cannot be held liable for any injury and / or material damage or immaterial damage that the visitors of the location and / or the tournament might experience.\n\nOther situations\n\nIn situations where the house rules do not provide, the organisation decides on possible measures to be taken. The decision of the organisation on this matter is binding.\n\nIN FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE HOUSE RULES, ACCESS WILL BE DENIED.\n\nPlaying rules\n\nAll Games will be played in accordance with the laws of the Czech rugby union (ČSRU) and of the World rugby (WR) including the SEVEN-A-SIDE VARIATIONS\n\nAll games will have a playing duration of 7 minutes each way with a one minute interval at half time, including the final.\n\nExtra Time. In all knock-out matches where the scores are equal at the end of playing time, SIX-A-SIDE extra time will be played. The first team to score (try, free throw, DG or PK) during extra time wins the match (sudden death or „Golden Score“) and the match ends. The referee will organize a coin toss at the start of extra time and the team that wins the toss decides which direction they will play or to kick-off. Extra time is played in 5 minute halves, after which teams switch sides without a halftime break.\n\nSubstitution of players. During any game a maximum of five players on each side may be replaced through injury or interchange. Replacements are made only when the ball is dead and only with the permission of the referee. Replaced players may return to play only under the condition stipulated by WR laws of the game – seven-a-side variations.\n\nRed Cards and Yellow Cards. A player sent off by a referee will not play again during the same day. It will be at the discretion of the Tournament Organising Committee to exclude him from playing following matches. A yellow card will result in the player being excluded from the pitch for 2 minutes.\n\nLate Arrival. When a team arrives too late for the kick-off the match they will forfeit the match. The referee will decide when the team is “too late”. The team that fails to arrive on time will be deemed to have lost the game 35-0 (5 converted tries).\n\nMatch Ball. Each team must provide a match ball for each match.\n\nTouch Judge. Each team must provide a touch judge for each match if there are no touch judges supplied by the organisation.\n\nPlayer registration\n\nAge Limit. All players must be 18 years old or older at the time of the tournament unless permission is given by, the organising committee.\n\nOnly Registered Players can play. Up to 12 players can be registered for a team. Players must be registered by presenting a filled form before the tournament starts. For each player the name and date of birth must be filled in. No player can be registered for more than one team at a time. The list of registered players will be available to the referee on the match card. This can be checked by either team captain.\n\nAdditional Registered Players. When a team has less than 12 players registered they can register an Additional Player or Players during the tournament by an application presented to the Tournament Organising Committee. Players already registered for one team cannot register as an Additional Player for another team. Any transfer of players has to be approved by the Tournament Organising Committee before the player can play.\n\nIf a team suspects that the opposition is playing an unregistered player it is their duty to report this to the referee immediately and not wait for the result of the game. If the challenge is upheld (the referee has a list of the registered players for each team on his match card) then the referee will ensure the player does not take any further part in the match and report it to the organising committee.\n\nFormat of the tournament\n\nEach team plays 5 matches.\n\nIn the pools the standing is determined upon the following criteria (in the given order):\n\nHighest number of points. In the pools a victory is worth 2 points, a draw worth 1 point and a defeat no point.\n\nHigher number of tries scored.\n\nLower number of tries conceded.\n\nMore points scored (including kicks).\n\nLess points conceded.\n\nLess red cards.\n\nLess yellow cards.\n\nToss of coin.\n\nOrganising committee\n\nThe committee makes the schedules for the referees.\n\nIf a situation arises where neither the laws of the game nor the regulations of the tournament above provide a solution the Tournament Organising Committee will decide.\n\nLiability"
