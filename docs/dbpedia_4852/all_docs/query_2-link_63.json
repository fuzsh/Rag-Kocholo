        "text": "Family of a Brit who has gone missing in Prague a week ago have called in private investigators to find him.\n\nJoop Sparkes, 29, hasn't been seen for a week after going overboard on a party boat in the Czechia capital in the early hours of Sunday, April 27. The construction worker from Galashiels, Scottish Borders, is reported to have jumped from the boat in the River Vltava, with no trace of him since.\n\nNow Joop's family have called in extra help to find him after scouring the streets and river, with searches by both them and police both fruitless. Devastated sister Jodie Wilson, Joop's girlfriend Charley Maben and his aunt Gillian have all been in the city trying to find him, even following the same party boat he travelled on.\n\nBut despite their efforts, Joop's whereabouts remain unknown. The family say they have taken on a private investigator to help the search for Joop in a desperate bid for answers.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Record, sister Jodie said: \"We're just as confused as ever. The boat seemed to be further downstream than the point it's believed Joop jumped on Friday night. There must have been about 100 people onboard, it travels very slowly, and a lot of the time it's just floating. It could only have travelled about half a mile or so. It was a very short distance.\n\n\"We still continue to walk the length of the river banks, checking out buildings, checking the homeless people who are wrapped in sleeping bags pulling clothing from the river to check if it's not Joop's.\n\n\"Yesterday we walked 24 miles along the riverbanks and the marina. We are also checking along the boats to make sure he's not either on or in the water nearby. We have spoken to people and asked if they have seen him, some are lovely and some unfortunately are very evil.\"\n\nJodie said the family were \"all emotionall and physically exhausted\" but added \"we've got to keep going\". \"We just don't know what to do anymore and we need answers,\" she said.\n\n\"It just doesn't seem real. We haven't seen police on the water since Tuesday and haven't has any answers so we've called private investigators and we're in discussions with them about drone searches as well as if they can bring divers in.\"\n\nCzech Police said they were also searching after a report was made of a tourist going missing, while the Foreign Office said they were supporting the public investigation. A spokesperson for th Czech Republic Police said: \"I can confirm that since early Sunday morning the Prague police have been searching for a 29-year-old foreigner who, according to the announcement, jumped from a party boat near the Charles Bridge in Prague 1 and has not been seen since.\"\n\n\"In the place where the missing person was last seen, several search operations took place, in which policemen from the river department were also involved, but the foreigner has not been found anywhere yet.\" It's understood Joop was wearing a black T-shirt when he went overboard on the boat between 1 and 2am on Sunday last weekend.\n\nHis family launched a fundraiser to help cover their costs while they stay in Prague and so far over Â£11,000 has been donated. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson also said: \"We are supporting the family of a British man who has gone missing in Czech Republic and are in contact with the local authorities.\""
