        "text": "Samel Arslanagic i awarded the medal on the basis of his excellent dissemination of science through research and teaching, collaboration with industry through projects and guest lectures, as well as diligent authorship.\n\nThe medal is presented at an event on 25 October 2021 in the H.C. Ørsted Building, Auditorium 1, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen and begins at 19.30 with a lecture by Samel Arslanagic with the title ”How to Control Electromagnetic Waves by Simple Water-Based Devices?”. Everyone is welcome to the event.\n\nOle Mørk Lauridsen, member of the assessment committee, about the medal recipient;\n\n”Samel Arslanagic is first and foremost a passionate and committed teacher. Secondly, he is an excellent researcher, which ensures that his teaching is always based on the latest findings in electromagnetism.\n\nSamel embraces students, international collaboration as well as projects with Danish industry; all supported by a long list of publications, whereby he in the finest way communicates Ørsted's science for the benefit of society as a whole.\n\nSamel stands today as a beacon within the dissemination of electromagnetic science; He is therefore a worthy recipient of the 2021 H.C. Ørsted silver medal, in H.C. Ørsted’s spirit of dissemination and utilisation of science in society”.\n\nThe recognition of research dissemination\n\nIn addition to being a teacher and researcher, Samel is also actively engaged in industrial collaboration. He is the acting head of the Section for Electromagnetic Systems at DTU Electrical Engineering, which houses DTU's upcoming Electromagnetic Test Centre (ETC) that opens in 2022 and will provide, among other things, the mobile phone and radar industry significantly better opportunities for characterisation and optimisation of antenna and microwave conditions in their products.\n\n”It is with great joy and humility that I receive this recognition from SNU. It not only sheds light on the important work we researchers and educators do on a daily basis, but certainly also provides an immense motivation to continue our efforts,\" says Samel Arslanagic.\n\n\"I am also deeply grateful to DTU for entrusting me with part of the teaching and research in this central area of electrical science and technology, which electromagnetism undeniably is. The recognition also reflects to a very high degree the great atmosphere at DTU Electrical Engineering, and the colleagues among whom I have had the opportunity to develop, and not forgetting all the engaged students who with their critical sense ensures that we stay up to date”.\n\nSynergy between research and industry\n\nThe opportunity to be able to focus on the synergy between research and industry with the award ceremony is due to a collaboration between SNU and the TICRA foundation.\n\n”We are delighted to initiate our collaboration with TICRA Fond and have the opportunity to focus on the important synergy between the research and the industrial communities. It was with precisely such synergy in mind that H.C. Ørsted in 1824 founded the Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science. He wanted the industrial community to gain access to the results of the newest research and use it for the benefit of the wider community,” says SNU's President Dorte Olesen."
