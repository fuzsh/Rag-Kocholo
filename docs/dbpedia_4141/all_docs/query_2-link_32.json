        "text": "For the first time in 30 years, H.C. Ørsted is awarded the medal in gold. The selected recipient, who is the medal in the very good research company, is chemistry professor Karl Anker Jørgensen from Aarhus University. He receives it for his international groundbreaking research in catalytic chemistry and its excellent abilities to disseminate scientific results to a wider audience in full compliance with Hans Christian Ørsted's own visions, for example. Through the creation of the company for the spread of nature in 1824.\n\nThe gold medal and the travel grant of DKK 75,000 to Karl Anker Jørgensen have been made possible on the basis of support from the energy company Ørsted.\n\nKarl Anker Jørgensen's Research field is asymmetric catalysis. Based on the chemistry of nature, he has developed catalysts that can control the three-dimensional formation and building of molecules that appear as mirror images of each other, so, for example, only one of the mirror image molecules is formed. In living organisms, there appears to be only one mirror image form of a given molecule, so research into the formation of these molecules extends far beyond the chemistry to humans, animals and plants and is the foundation of all living. Karl Anker Jørgensen's Research has, among other things, found industrial use for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products under more sustainable conditions.\n\nThe gold medal and prize was presented by Her Majesty the Queen of the Royal Danish Science company on 16 October 2019.\n\nThe H.C. Ørsted Medal in Gold is awarded for excellent scientific work in the fields of physics and chemistry. The medal is rarely awarded. Most recently, in 1989, it was awarded to Professor Thor A. Bak. The first recipient was the inventor of Phskalaen, Professor S.P.L. Sørensen in 1909. In total, it has so far been awarded 17 times in 110 years, and among the beneficiaries are also two Nobel laureates, Niels Bohr (1924) and Aage Bohr (1970)."
