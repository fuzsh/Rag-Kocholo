As the founder and director of Club Ability, she instituted a transformative approach to teaching technology. She began her journey working with children with disabilities. From there, Club Ability expanded to fill a void in providing STEM education to girls and women and their families, especially those in Hispanic families that are sorely underrepresented in the field, where Latinos make up only 7% of Utah tech jobs despite being 15% of the Utah population. She has served nearly 1,000 K-12 students, primarily from low-income families. Since Club Ability’s 2019 inception, the educational programs have served a Utah population that’s 93% low-income, 98% Latinx, and 20% have a disability.\n\nAcademic/Research\n\nCornelia Ulrich\n\nPh.D., M.S., Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah\n\nDr. Cornelia Ulrich is an internationally recognized cancer epidemiologist/cancer prevention scientist and an accomplished leader.

Valentine, Ph.D., RN, SANE-A, FAAN\n\nAssociate Dean, Undergraduate Studies and Research, Brigham Young University – College of Nursing\n\nDr. Julie Valentine’s groundbreaking research on sexual assault has driven Utah’s improvements in addressing sexual violence.\n\nDr. Valentine’s collaborative research study with the Utah Bureau of Forensic Sciences, starting in 2011, captures data on sexual assault cases to help reduce sexual violence. This growing dataset of approximately 10,000 sexual assault cases in Utah is the largest database of its kind, tracking information from evidence collection through sexual assault kit submission rates to DNA analysis findings.\n\nDr. Valentine’s research has informed national standards in sexual assault evidence collection and kit submissions. Her research has been foundational for several legislative bills, including House Bill 200 Sexual Assault Kit Processing Amendments mandating the submission and testing of all sexual assault kits resulting in statewide submission rates improving from 38% to 98%.\n\nDr. Valentine was the primary author of Utah’s original Sexual Assault Kit Initiative grant and District Attorney of New York grant, which awarded about $3.2 million to Utah to fund testing of over 11,000 backlogged sexual assault kits and identification of over 2,000 suspects.
