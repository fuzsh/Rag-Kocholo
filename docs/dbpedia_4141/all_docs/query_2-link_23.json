        "text": "Hans Christian Ørsted (born August 14, 1777, Rudkøbing, Denmark—died March 9, 1851, Copenhagen) was a Danish physicist and chemist who discovered that electric current in a wire can deflect a magnetized compass needle, a phenomenon the importance of which was rapidly recognized and which inspired the development of electromagnetic theory.\n\nIn 1806 Ørsted became a professor at the University of Copenhagen, where his first physical researches dealt with electric currents and acoustics. During an evening lecture in April 1820, Ørsted discovered that a magnetic needle aligns itself perpendicularly to a current-carrying wire, definite experimental evidence of the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science"
