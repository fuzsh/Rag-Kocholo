        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series. Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory and how you grew up?\n\nI grew up middle class in the heart of Silicon Valley when it was full of orchards. As a daughter of educated immigrants, work ethic and education were ingrained in me. I watched my engineering dad solve any sort of problem, electrical or mechanical, and I watched my mom start two non-profits to serve those that needed help.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nThe interesting stories happen within start-ups. They usually revolve around me giving up some difficult situation to God and seeing Him move in miraculous ways. For example, in my previous startup we were within weeks of not being able to make payroll with no investors in sight, and yet before that happened, he answered prayers and we were able to close a round with a bunch of investors very quickly.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nI started Elidah with my husband, Eric. We both have engineering and business backgrounds, and so we overlap and complement each other. He excels where I don’t. He encourages, challenges, and is honest.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nIt changes. But in the season I’m in right now, I have to remind myself it’s about “grace over grind” (phrase by Shae Bynes). Running my company is not about hustling and grinding it out, but about being smart, trying my best and leaving the rest up to God’s grace.\n\nYou are a successful business leader. Which three character traits do you think were most instrumental to your success? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nOptimism — As an entrepreneur, you can get beaten down fast if you are not optimistic. This goes hand in hand with hopefulness too.\n\nThankfulness — I try to appreciate all the little wins and the people who helped them to happen.\n\nPersistence — I once had a boss that told me I didn’t follow up with people/projects as much as I should. I just thought I was always bothering people. I now know that sometimes people need reminders, or they honestly didn’t see your message, or simply the squeaky wheel gets the grease. It pays to be persistent.\n\nOk super. Let’s now shift to the main part of our discussion about the tech tools that you are helping to create that can make a positive impact on our wellness. To begin, which particular problems are you aiming to solve?\n\n1 in 3 women have bladder leaks. It’s embarrassing and no one talks about it. However, common it is, the treatment options have been really poor. Doctors tell you to do pelvic floor exercises and then there is a big gap between that and surgery. Everything in between requires a vaginal device, which requires dedicated private time on your back. We have a better way.\n\nHow do you think your technology can address this?\n\nELITONE is a truly non-intrusive device that is easy to use. It is non-intrusive both physically as well as on your time. You simply wear it like a pad, then get dressed and do whatever you need to do while getting a treatment. It tones the pelvic muscles the correct way, longer and stronger than you could do yourself.\n\nCan you tell us the backstory about what inspired you to originally feel passionate about this cause?\n\nThat’s easy. I had a 9.5lb baby girl and 13lbs of twins after that. I was looking for something for myself and was dismayed by what was available.\n\nHow do you think this might change the world?\n\nNot only do 1 in 3 women worldwide have leaks, but it starts to greatly affect their lives. At first, it’s a nuisance, but it always gets worse, and then women stop being active. For example, one policewoman had to quit because she couldn’t run without leaking, another woman stopped playing tennis and hiking with her friends, and a grandmother stopped hugging her grandchildren for fear they would smell urine on her. Incontinence is largely reversible, and we want to help women get back to living life leak-free!\n\nKeeping “Black Mirror” and the “Law of Unintended Consequences” in mind, can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about?\n\nELITONE does the Kegel exercises for women, which is helpful because a quarter of women do them incorrectly. But perhaps one unintended consequence is that people in general can get too dependent on a device to do something that they really can do themselves.\n\nHere is the main question for our discussion. Based on your experience and success, can you please share “Five things you need to know to successfully create technology that can make a positive social impact”? (Please share a story or an example, for each.)\n\nThe need/problem has to be real, not just a perceived problem, and not just a better gadget. We knew this but were forced to validate it through I-Corps program by interviewing hundreds of women and doctors.\n\nI highly encourage a STEM-field background. You can always hire, but when you need to troubleshoot, it helps to understand the science.\n\nStay in touch and constantly get feedback from the potential users/customers during the design process. In my previous company, we got the design inputs and then didn’t talk to the customer again until the product was on the market, only to find that there were problems with perception or usability.\n\nHire smart people that you can really work with. The biggest emotional drain is when a team is not functioning well.\n\nA great technical product does not necessarily make a great company. It has to sell well, and so the market size needs to be very large\n\nIf you could tell other young people one thing about why they should consider making a positive impact on our environment or society, like you, what would you tell them?\n\nNever let fear of not succeeding prevent you from trying — — your idea could be a game-changer and could help so many people.\n\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would like to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\n\nReese Witherspoon: Also a mom of 3, an entrepreneur, and a Stanford alum who is just so fantastically talented — I think she would be so fun to chat with.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nThe best way is to get on our mailing list, through https://elitone.com. We can also be found on Facebook @elidahinc and Instagram @elitone1."
