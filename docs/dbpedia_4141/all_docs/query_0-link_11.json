        "text": "COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nDANIEL KLEPPNER, Co-Chair, is professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and co-director of the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms. He has made fundamental contributions to atomic physics and quantum optics. His research encompasses spectroscopic tests of extreme precision and novel quantum phenomena. He was director of the MIT-Harvard Center for Utracold Atoms from 2000 to 2006, and from 1987 to 2000 he was associate director of the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics. In 1960, along with Norman Ramsey, he developed the Hydrogen maser, later used as an atomic clock of unprecedented stability. Applications of this early work range from coordination of radio signals in long-baseline radio astronomy, to satellite-based global positioning systems.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dr. Kleppner was a pioneer in the physics of Rydberg atoms, demonstrating the inhibition of spontaneous emission from them. This was a pioneering step in the development of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the study of the radiative properties of atoms in confined spaces. Kleppner’s investigations of Rydberg atom spectra in high electric and magnetic fields provided deep physical insight into the implications of classical chaos for quantum systems.\n\nProfessor Kleppner and MIT colleague Professor Thomas Greytak were among the first to search for quantum degeneracy effects in ultra-cold gases. After a 20-year-long quest, in 1998, they achieved Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in hydrogen. In the meanwhile, they developed tools instrumental to the 1995 discovery of BEC in alkali atoms by MIT alumni Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman, and MIT’s Wolfgang Ketterle. These include the technique of evaporative cooling, developed in collaboration with Harald Hess. Bose-Einstein condensates and fermionic degenerate samples of cold atoms represent a new form of matter at the lowest temperatures ever achieved. These species are now the subject of intense investigation in laboratories around the world.\n\nIn addition to these research achievements, Dr. Kleppner has been a dedicated teacher at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and has served on numerous national committees charged with investigating key scientific or social issues. His honors include election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Academies of Science (Paris), and the Davisson-Germer Prize, Leo Szilard Lectureship Award and Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society, the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers, the Frederick Ives Medal of the Optical Society of America, the Wolf Prize, and the 2006 National Medal of Science.\n\nPHILLIP A. SHARP, Co-Chair, is Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Much of Dr. Sharp’s scientific work has been conducted at MIT’s Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute), which he joined in 1974 and directed from 1985 to 1991. He subsequently led the Department of Biology from 1991 to 1999 and the McGovern Institute from 2000 to 2004. His research interests have centered on the molecular biology of gene expression relevant to cancer and the mechanisms of RNA splicing; his landmark achievement was the discovery of RNA splicing in 1977. This work provided one of the first indications of the startling phenomenon of “discontinuous genes” in mammalian cells. The discovery that genes contain nonsense segments that are edited out by cells in the course of utilizing genetic information is important in understanding the genetic causes of cancer and other diseases. Dr. Sharp’s research opened an entirely new area in molecular biology and forever changed the field. For this work he shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Dr. Richard Roberts who did work in parallel at Cold Spring Harbor.\n\nDr. Sharp has authored more than 350 scientific papers and serves on many scientific committees, including the National Cancer Institute’s Advisory Board, which he chaired for two years (2000–2002). His work has been honored with numerous awards including the Gairdner Foundation International Award, General Motors Research Foundation Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize for Cancer Research, Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, and Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nA native of Kentucky, Dr. Sharp earned a B.A. degree from Union College, Kentucky, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 1969. He did his postdoctoral training at the California Institute of Technology, where he studied the molecular biology of plasmids from bacteria in Professor Norman Davidson’s laboratory. Prior to joining MIT, he was senior scientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nDr. Sharp is co-founder of Biogen, Inc., 1978, chairman of the Scientific Board (to 2002) and member of the board of directors. He is also co-founder of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (2002), where he serves as chairman of the Scientific Board and as a member of the company’s board of directors.\n\nMARGARET A.

The National Academy study Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos, which he led, identified opportunities at the intersection of astronomy and physics and has shaped the science investment in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Turner is currently the chair of the Physics Section of the National Academy of Sciences and the chair-elect of the Division of Astrophysics within the American Physical Society.\n\nJ. ANTHONY (TONY) TYSON is Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of California at Davis and the director of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). LSST will look wide, fast, and deep, scanning the entire night sky every three nights for 10 years. Its mission will be to map the mysterious “dark matter” and “dark energy” that physicists say make up 95 percent of the universe. His research interests are in cosmology, dark matter, dark energy, observational optical astronomy, experimental gravitational physics, and new instrumentation. He received his Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin in 1967 and was a member of the technical staff at Bell Laboratories from 1969 to 2003. His honors include election to the American Philosophical Society and the National Academy of Sciences, the Aaronson Memorial Prize, and fellowships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Physical Society."
