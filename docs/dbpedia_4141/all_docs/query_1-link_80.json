        "text": "The purpose of this Resource Letter is to provide an overview of research on the learning and teaching of physics. The references have been selected to meet the needs of two groups of physicists engaged in physics education. The first is the growing number whose field of scholarly inquiry is or might become physics education research. The second is the much larger community of physics instructors whose primary interest is in using the results from research as a guide for improving instruction.\n\nWelcome to the international conference, “Physics for All,” that has brought together many teachers of physics from all over the world. As physics educators, many of us have had the experience that our students do not seem to be learning physics very well, not all of them, anyway. It used to be that it was all right to only worry about the few percent that were able to learn well when we taught physics in our traditional way. But now, in these increasingly technical times, it is essential for us to pay more attention to more of our students. This is what we mean by “Physics for All.” As a result of this shift in view, a few decades ago, a number of physicists began to treat the teaching of physics as a scientific problem, and to use their skills as scientists to solve the question of how we can teach more students more effectively. This is not a trivial problem. It is harder than nuclear physics and it is harder than rocket science. Physics education researchers around the world now treat these issues as scientific research problems and ask a series of important questions: What is actually going on in our classes? How can we better accomplish our goals? How can we better understand what our real goals are for our students?"
