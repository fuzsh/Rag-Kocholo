        "text": "The Hans Christian Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers “recognizes those who have had an outstanding, widespread, and lasting impact on the teaching of physics,” and is often regarded as the highest recognition of achievement in the field of physics education. Of the 87 recipients of the Oersted Medal:\n\n12 have been appointed to MIT’s Faculty,\n\n5 held visiting faculty appointments,\n\n12 were MIT physics graduates (7 undergraduate degrees, 10 graduate degrees),\n\nand 7 were members of the MIT Radiation Laboratory during WWII.\n\nThe Physics Education Group is proud to participate in the legacy of these extraordinary educators who both sprang from and helped create the environment of excellence in education in the MIT Department of Physics."
