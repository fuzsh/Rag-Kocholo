Prof. Kolb has presented public lectures on dark energy and dark matter all over the world. He has appeared in several television productions, such as interviewing Stephen Hawking for the Discovery Channel; he can also be seen in the IMAX film The Cosmic Voyage.\n\nIn addition to over 200 scientific papers, he is a co-author of The Early Universe, the standard textbook on particle physics and cosmology, and Blind Watchers of the Sky which received an Emme Award from the American Aeronautical Society. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society."
