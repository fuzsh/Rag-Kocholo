He traveled all the continents looking for the immortal master and found him. Even though the master would teach no one, he taught the monkey the secrets of transformation. The story then continues when the Monkey King meets the Turtle, Dragon King of the Easter Ocean, the Heavenly Maiden, the Heavenly Warriors, Green Dragon and White Tiger.\n\nThe performance is split into two parts. Part one consists of a review of the tradition, techniques and characters of the Beijing Opera, which will include a lecture and demonstration with some audience participation. Part two consists of the performance of \"The Monkey Knows No Walls.\" A question-and-answer session will be held at the end of the performance.\n\nThe Beijing Opera Monkey Troupe's version also incorporates traditional-style shadow puppetry not found in the Chinese stage performances. This troupe, true to form, portrays all the characters in masks that mimic the traditional face-paint makeup of Chinese opera.\n\nTicket holders for this performance also will be admitted to a special reception and advance viewing of the \"Chinese Maximalism\" exhibition in the UB Art Gallery in the CFA. The reception will begin at 7 p.m. (See story on page for more details about the \"Chinese Maximalism\" exhibition.)\n\nTickets for \"Excerpts from The China Beijing Opera 'The Monkey Knows No Walls'\" are $10 for the general public and $5 for UB students.

But in 1903, the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates challenged the Boston Americans to a play-off, which he was sure his team would win. It didn'tand that wasn't the only surprise during what became the first World Series. In \"Autumn Glory,\" Masur tells the story of two agonizing weeks in which the stars blew it, unknown players stole the show, hysterical fans got into the act and umpires had to hold on for dear life.\n\nProfessor of history at City College of New York and editor of \"Reviews in Amercan History,\" Masur also is the author of \"1831: Year of Eclipse.\"\n\nKolb to deliver Rustgi lecture\n\nEdward W. \"Rocky\" Kolb, founding head of the NASA/Fermilab Astrophysics Group at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, will speak on \"The Quantum and the Cosmos\" during the 11th annual Moti Lal Rustgi Memorial Lecture, to be held at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in 114 Hochstetter Hall, North Campus.\n\nThe Rustgi lecture, presented by the Department of Physics, will be free of charge and open to the public.\n\nA native of New Orleans, Kolb received a doctorate in physics from the University of Texas and performed postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology and Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he was the J.

His book for the general public, \"Blind Watchers of the Sky,\" received the 1996 Emme Award of the American Aeronautical Society.\n\nThe field of Kolb's research is the application of elementary-particle physics to the very early universe. In addition to more than 200 scientific papers, he is a co-author of \"The Early Universe,\" the standard textbook on particle physics and cosmology.\n\nHe also teaches cosmology to non-science majors at the University of Chicago and participates in Fermilab's Saturday Morning Physics Program for high-school students and the Department of Energy's high-school physics program for gifted students,\n\nFor further information on the Rustgi lecture, contact the Department of Physics at 645-2017, email Michael Fuda at fuda@buffalo.edu, or go to the Department of Physics Web site at http://www.physics.buffalo.edu .\n\nTheatre and Dance to present \"Forum\"\n\nThe Department of Theatre and Dance will present a student production of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" Oct. 16-19 and Oct. 23-26 in the Black Box Theatre in the Center for the Arts, North Campus.\n\nShows are at 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and at 2 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nMedia sponsor for this production is WBFO 88.7 FM, the National Public Radio affiliate operated by UB.\n\nThe production of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" is based on the book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gilbert, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It is directed by Lynne Kurdziel-Formato, assistant professor of theatre and dance.\n\nThe story, which takes place in ancient Rome, is set in motion when a middle-aged couple, Senex, and Domina, leave for vacation. Their slave-in-chief, Hysterium, is left to take care of the household while their only son, Hero, is in charge of their other slave, Pseudolus.\n\nThe plot revolves around Pseudolus, who will do almost anything to gain his freedom. When Pseudolus is left in the care of his owner's young son, who has fallen madly in love with a beautiful courtesan, the fun begins. The young boy promises Pseudolus his freedom if he can arrange a marriage before his father returns. Pseudolus, of course, agrees. But not even the conniving slave can foresee the tangled web that he is about to weave.\n\nTickets for \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" are $15 for the general public and $6 for UB students. Tickets are available at the CFA box office from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and at all Ticketmaster locations.\n\nFor more information, call 645-ARTS.\n\nCFA to present Gov't Mule\n\nThe Center for the Arts will present Gov't Mule, with special guest Chris Robinson & New Earth Mud, at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Mainstage theater in the CFA, North Campus.\n\nThis show is sponsored by the Student Association; media sponsor is WBUF-FM.\n\nGov't Mule was formed in 1994 by guitarist Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody, both from the Allman Brothers Band, along with drummer Matt Abts. The influence of the Allman Brothers Band is apparent in their music, as well as the incorporation of the psychedelic, bluesy power-trio feel of the band Cream.\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album reached no. 5 on the Billboard album charts. In 1998, they released their major label debut, \"Dose,\" under Capricorn Records, with a follow-up double live release in 1999, \"Live With a Little Help From Our Friends.\"\n\nSince 1994, Gov't Mule has toured relentlessly, gaining fan bases around the world. The band has toured with Dave Matthews Band, Black Crowes, Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jethro Tull and Steve Miller.\n\nWoody died unexpectedly in August 2000, and the band's future was uncertain. Rather than replace Woody, the surviving members elected to gather many of their favorite bassists and those who had the most influence on Woody to collaborate together on their next two albums, \"The Deep End Volume I\" and \"The Deep End Volume II.\"\n\nGov't Mule since has added keyboardist Danny Louis to its full-time lineup. A replacement bassist is expected to be announced soon.\n\nFormer Black Crowes lead singer Chris Robinson and his band, New Earth Mud, will open the concert. After reaching great success with the Black Crowes in the 1990s, Robinson began to feel burned out as a result of conflict and constant touring, and started to work on his own. In 2002, he teamed up with guitarist Paul Stacey and he completed his solo debut album, titled \"New Earth Mud.\"\n\nTickets for Gov't Mule, with special guest Chris Robinson and New Earth Mud, are $27. Tickets are available at the CFA box office from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and at all Ticketmaster locations.\n\nFor more information, call 645-ARTS.\n\nLecture to examine good, bad and ugly aspects of digital capitalism\n\nDistinguished communications historian Daniel Schiller, of the University of Illinoisthe scholar who coined the term \"digital capitalism\"will speak at UB on Oct. 16 on an issue that experts say is of increasing importance for democratic societies.\n\nIt is the economy-wide network developed to support a growing range of intracorporate and intercorporate business processesa network that Schiller says is of utmost importance to the architects of global capitalism. Schiller says the pursuit of this goal has produced a flagrant crisis in the communications sector that is the result of in an orgy of speculative and highly irresponsible network building brought about by what he calls a \"sweeping metamorphosis of the structure and policy of existing telecommunications.\"\n\nSchiller's talk, \"Digital Capitalism: The Corporate Commonwealth of Communications and Information,\" will take place at the 7 p.m. in the University Archives, 420 Capen Hall, North Campus. It is open to the public and free of charge, and will be preceded at 6 p.m. by a public reception.\n\nThe School of Informatics, the UB Libraries' Archives and Poetry/Rare Book Collection, and other campus groups will sponsor the event."
