        "text": "The EECS Student Awards are presented to undergraduate and graduate students annually in the spring at the Student Awards Ceremony. Recipients of these awards are selected from the pools of nominees by the department's Student Awards Committee. Many nominations are solicited from the EECS community at large, but some awards have special requirements that call for more specialized nominations. Descriptions of the awards are below.\n\nACM SIGDA Doctoral Dissertation Award\n\nDesign automation has gained widespread acceptance by the VLSI circuits and systems design community. Advancement in computer-aided design (CAD) methodologies, algorithms, and tools has become increasingly important to cope with the rapidly growing design complexity, higher performance and low-power requirements, and shorter time-to-market demands. To encourage innovative, ground-breaking research in the area of electronic design automation, the ACM's Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) has established an ACM award to be given each year to an outstanding Ph.D. dissertation that makes the most substantial contribution to the theory and/or application in the field of electronic design automation.\n\nThe award consists of a certificate and a check for $1,000 and is presented at the Design Automation Conference, which is held in June/July of each year. The award is selected by a committee of experts from academia and industry in the field and appointed by ACM in consultation with the SIGDA Chair.\n\nEach department of any university may nominate at most two Ph.D. dissertations whose final submission date is between July 1st of the previous year and June 30th of the current year. Each nomination package must be emailed by November 30 and should consists of:\n\nThe PDF file of the Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nA statement (up to two pages) from the nominee explaining the significance and major contributions of the work.\n\nA nomination letter from nominee's department chair or dean of the school endorsing the application.\n\nOptionally, up to three letters of recommendation from experts in the field. These letters may be included in the nomination package or sent separately to the address below.\n\nAwardees\n\nDemetri Angelakos Memorial Achievement Award\n\nPresented annually to an Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences graduate student who is beyond the preliminary examination and is proceeding to a doctoral degree. The purpose of the award is to recognize students who, in addition to conducting research, unselfishly take the time to help colleagues beyond the normal cooperation existing between fellow students. The award was established in 1979 in memory of Demetri Angelakos, a UC Berkeley student working toward his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the time of his death.\n\nThe altruistic attitude of the recipient may be evidenced in the following ways: volunteering to conduct laboratory procedure sessions attended by colleagues, explaining intricate equipment usage, promoting greater research cooperation, etc. Because of the primary interests of the EECS graduate student in whose name the award was established, the general areas of solid state, optical electronics, electromagnetics and semiconductor electronics will be given first consideration.\n\nAwardees\n\nTimothy B. Campbell Innovation Award\n\nThis award is presented to a Computer Science or Electrical Engineering undergraduate or graduate student who demonstrates a spirit of innovation, collaboration, and creativity through their research and personal life. This award honors the memory of Tim Campbell, a CS PhD Student who was widely known for his innovative spirit, creativity, and cross-functional collaboration.\n\nAwardees\n\nLeon O. Chua Award\n\nThe Leon O. Chua award is presented annually to an undergraduate or graduate student, or to a recent alumnus, for outstanding achievement in an area of nonlinear science from any discipline, including biological, engineering, mathematical, physical and social sciences. It was made possible by a donation in 1999 from Professor Sung-Mo âSteveâ Kang, a student of Professor Chua and former Chancellor of U.C. Merced.\n\nAwardees\n\nDepartment Citation\n\nThe Department Citation is presented annually in recognition of outstanding undergraduate achievement within the department.

Eaton Memorial Scholarship\n\nThe James Eaton Memorial Scholarship is awarded to EECS undergraduate students who have demonstrated a keen sense of creativity and inventiveness. The award is named in honor of James Eaton, a 1962 EE PhD, who spent a short period of time on the UC Berkeley EE faculty. He then spent 40 years directing research and pioneering technologies at IBM, making special accomplishments in the magnetic tape data storage areas. Late in his career, suffering from MS, he left the East Coast and returned to California where he pursued his interest in designing new products. He received an IBM Corporate Award in 2001 and the title of Master Inventor (with 24-25 patents) shortly before his death. James H. Eaton was known by all as an original thinker, coming up with practical, unique and patentable ideas.\n\nAwardees\n\nEECS Major Citation\n\nThe EECS Department Citation is presented annually in recognition of the most outstanding undergraduate achievement within the department. The Major Citations are awarded for outstanding contributions in the EECS and the L&S Computer Science majors. The Student Awards committee makes its selection among the students with the highest average grades while also considering other qualities and accomplishments.\n\nAwardees\n\nArt and Mary Fong Undergraduate Scholarship\n\nThe Fong Award is given to a student completing their junior year who has demonstrated both high scholastic achievement and financial need.

(Formerly called IT Award, name changed in 2008.)\n\nAwardees\n\nEECS Outstanding TA Awards\n\nWe invite the faculty to nominate approximately the top nine percent of our GSIs and TAs from Spring, Summer and Fall semesters of the previous calendar year. From these, our Student Awards committee selects a subset for our departmental Outstanding TA awards. The remainder will be considered for nomination for the campus award. We have a large department with hundreds of GSIs/TAs per semester. These students serve roles of administration; support design content; support diversity, equity and inclusion; support struggling students; author and support projects; create course innovation; go above-and-beyond in answering questions online, and more. Faculty are encouraged to surface the roles TAs play on their staff website, so that if an experience is truly wonderful, students know whom to thank. Recommenders are encouraged to look beyond the traditional roles when recommending their TAs, and to be explicit in their nomination letter to highlight the things the TA did that were noteworthy.\n\nStudents selected for the campus award are recognized by the campus in their Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Awards. Those selected for the EECS Outstanding TA Award are recognized at the EECS Student Award Ceremony.\n\nAwardees\n\nGlobal Young Scientists Summit\n\nThe GYSS@one-north is a gathering of young scientists and researchers (PhD students and post-docs) from all over the world, with eminent international science and technology leaders ('speakers') in Singapore.
