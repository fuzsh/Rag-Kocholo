Speech Title and Abstract

Title – The Quantum and the Cosmos

Abstract – Quantum laws rule the microscopic world. In the Big Bang era our world was subatomic and governed by quantum phenomena which generated all the cosmic structures, from galaxies to light, around us today. This connection between the quantum and the cosmos may explain the nature of dark matter holding together our galaxy and the mysterious dark energy tearing apart our universe.
