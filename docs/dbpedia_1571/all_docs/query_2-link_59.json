        "meta_description": "<div>The proper design of the UAV will enable the system to meet its service and</div><div>functional requirements. It will also promote its availability and reliability, thereby</div><div>extending its useful life in service. This work focuses on the development, sizing of an</div><div>engine, and simulation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), including the assembly</div><div>of the whole propulsion system in the UAV. The mission of the developed UAV is for</div><div>short range (25-100 km). The propulsion system consists of the following: the engine,</div><div>muffler, electronic ignition system, fuel tank, engine servos, propeller, firewall, and</div><div>battery. These components assembled together give the UAV its required thrust for</div><div>flight. The design calculations were done, and simulations for the design were carried</div><div>out using Solid Works and AutoCAD. The developed UAV was constructed using local</div><div>materials such as Styrofoam and wood. It was driven by a two stroke internal</div><div>combustion engine (gas engine) and an electric motor controlled by an electric speed</div><div>controller (ESC). The performance evaluation of the developed UAV was carried out</div><div>using the virtual X-Plane flight simulator. The results obtained indicated that that the</div><div>developed UAV can be deployed for the short-range missions. This work provides</div><div>design data for the development of the UAV. Hence, it is envisaged that the outcome of</div><div>the study will be of immense guide to industries, which specialize in the development</div><div>of UAV.</div>",
