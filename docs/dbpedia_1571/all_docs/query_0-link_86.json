        "text": "In this paper, we present nonlinear modeling and autonomous flight control system for a typical ducted fan unmanned aerial vehicle, which is characterized by highly coupled nonlinear dynamics. A nonlinear six-degree of freedom desktop simulation model is implemented in MATLAB using modular approach. A dynamic inversion based controller for autonomous take-off and translational flight are proposed to handle nonlinearity and unknown disturbances. Simulation studies are conducted under nominal flight condition and the results clearly indicate that the proposed dynamic inversion based controller handles the highly coupled nonlinearity efficiently. We also conduct simulation studies under moderate gust and sensor noise to examine the disturbance rejection ability. The study results indicate that the controller performs quite well in even in the presence of external disturbances.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in aviation is the design of transitioning vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Thrust-borne flight implies a higher mass fraction of the propulsion system, as well as much increased energy consumption in the take-off and landing phases. A good VTOL design will offset this disadvantage by transitioning to conventional forward flight, thus travelling at much higher efficiency than a comparable rotorcraft, for an overall improvement in mission performance. This paper intents to support the configuration designer of VTOL aircraft by giving a review of some of the available configuration possibilities, considering the latest advancements in technology. While VTOL aircraft can use the conventional wing-fuselage-stabilizer configuration, much of new development efforts involve unconventional planforms. The advent of distributed propulsion and electric- or hybrid-electric propulsion systems offers additional opportunities to optimize the vehicle layout and improve flight performance. This review considers propeller driven designs, lift fans and ducted fans, as well as jet lift and hybrid configurations that use a mix of propulsion methods.\n\nThis thesis investigates the ability of a hovering bicopter to be self-stabilized in pitch and roll without the use of electronic sensors in those directions. A mathematical model of aircraft dynamics is developed in which the non-cyclic proprotors are allowed to precess freely as gyroscopes since these are known to embody stabilizing elements. In the prior art of bicopter oblique active tilting (OAT), the proprotors generate gyroscopic control moments only when forcibly tilted, and stabilization in pitch and roll requires electronic attitude sensors and actuator servos. A self-stabilized system, however, would reduce cost, stresses and energy consumption, and could be scalable without limit. Through analysis of the characteristic equations it is found that aircraft angular positions cannot be so stabilized, but their velocities can be, maintaining the benefits listed above. This stability is similar to that due the flybar damping system of early Bell helicopters and still useful in small models today."
