        "text": "1 Faculty Of Architecture, Planning & Surveying, Universiti Teknologi MARA Seri Iskandar Campus, Seri Iskandar, 32610 Perak, Malaysia\n\n2 School of Technology Management and Logistic, Universiti Utara Malaysia\n\nAbstract\n\nAdoption of new technology in building inspection works has proven to be very crucial and has improved efficiency and effectiveness in this regards. Tools and techniques in building inspection and condition survey continuously evolved trough times. The tools and techniques adopted mostly first has been successfully applied by others technical field such as civil engineering, manufacturing etc.. As UAS has been successfully adopted by many technical professions such as geotechnical engineering, land surveying, civil engineering etc. a practical use of UAV for building surveying and facilities management yet to explored. The present paper intend to explore the viability of UAS application for building inspection with the advantage it has especially in inspecting and collecting data at difficult to reach area such as roof, ceiling, gutter and recording data for large building complex. With the accurate and comprehensive inspection data collected, perhaps it could guide building surveyors or facilities managers in diagnosing building defect effectively, suggesting possible remedies, solving issues and making decision precisely. The present paper provides a comprehensive review of possible application of small UAS in building inspection and facilities management related uses by reviewing the similar application and identifying their features that suits facilities managementâ€™s nature of practice. Challenges faced by building and facilities management organisation to apply UAS in their building condition survey routine that are identifying suitable tools other than normal visual tools to be attached, finalising arrangement on site during inspection and limited skill of existing personnel to deal with the equipments."
