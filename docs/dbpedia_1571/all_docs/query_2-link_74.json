        "text": "Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have already started making an impact in fields like pesticide application and aerial photography. As UAS continue to develop, the technology could find its ways into areas ranging from disaster monitoring and other public-use applications to infrastructure maintenance, parcel delivery, and other new commercial applications.\n\nBy researching and developing basic technologies for improving the operational safety and mission capabilities of small UAS, JAXA is helping expand the scope of the technology and contributing to the realization of a safe and prosperous society.\n\nJAXA is also conducting research and development on operation technology, focusing on optimizing the efficiency and environmental compatibility of UAS as demand grows, to make a difference in the economic and social dimensions, as well."
