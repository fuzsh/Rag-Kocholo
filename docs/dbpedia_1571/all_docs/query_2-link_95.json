        "text": "MILO Range simulators are designed to help military units with counter UAS missions prepare for and improve their current operational capability with SKYNET drone threat defense ammunition by meeting their training requirement in full fidelity. Units engaging in MILO simulation training with their own shotguns can accomplish combat proficiency without the requirement of having to take aim over or shut down an airfield. By providing a flexible, scalable, and immersive environment for trainees to practice using their shotgun to deploy nets to disable unmanned drones, instructors can create tailored lessons to ensure practice is effective and skills remain current without having to expend any SKYNET ammunition, deploy a drone, or shut down an airfield to train.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the USAF Global Strike Command, the ‘C-UAS Takedown’ skill-builder includes full UAS representational fidelity and simulates accurate SKYNET™ ballistics with laser precision. Trainees can use their own shotgun with MILO laser insert with or without recoil. MILO software engineers incorporate UAS physics into programming so that movement incorporates realistic drone flight patterns and behaviors. MILO’s GraphX CGI technology incorporates multiple scenery and environmental conditions to reflect every locale and changing weather conditions, day or night. The C-UAS Takedown is exclusively available on MILO Range simulators, for use on single screen and multi-screen systems.\n\nAdvanced Training Solutions for Non-Standard Training\n\nMILO simulators are instructor-controlled, with full audio/video capture and advanced logging, debriefing, and scenario developmental tools. CGI GraphX skill builders can be made more intense and challenging (or eased off) at any time, even mid-scenario. Our simulator solutions provide a sensory-rich environment, designed to mimic real-world environments and situations that military members are likely to encounter.\n\nMILO’s trainee-centered after-action debriefing process actively engages officers in mining each of their sessions for every teachable moment and opportunity for reflection. Trainees learn by seeing how they appear on camera before, during, and after shooting and are able to use that information from the AAR to modify their reaction and improve proficiency when they do it again.\n\nExpand Close"
