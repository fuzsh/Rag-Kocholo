        "text": "Within aerospace, the ability to transmit and receive information is paramount. People and equipment must have reliable, robust, and always-on systems that exchange data at high speed. Predicting how these systems will perform in changing weather conditions, over different terrain morphologies, and/or with interference is a complex task.\n\nAltair’s AI-powered solutions enable your team to optimize the entire communications system, including electronics, antennas, cables, energy sources, radomes, ground stations, and beyond. Our tools can handle very large radio frequency and electronic domains. Overall, users can maximize their systems’ reliability and range while reducing dimensions, weight, and energy consumption.\n\nThe convergence of technological innovation and urbanization is reshaping the landscape of air mobility. From unmanned vehicles to e-VTOLs, industry leaders must use new materials, implement new propulsion systems, incorporate batteries, reduce noise, build novel infrastructure, and demonstrate the safety required for both certification and public acceptance.\n\nAltair’s simulation and data analytics solutions enable fast exploration and validation of design concepts. Our tools enable digital performance and safety testing of airframes, motors, avionics, and batteries, speeding up certification and supporting shorter go-to-market cycles.\n\nFrom fuel efficient, lighter, and reusable rockets to small satellites built with COTS components, the space industry has transformed. No longer the domain of a few government agencies, space is now a resource open to organizations of nearly any size. Launch slots are widely available, and the cost of putting sensors into orbit has become affordable. The challenge now is to push these boundaries further by increasing production rates, sensor capacity, data transmission rates, and analysis capabilities.\n\nAltair helps users test new designs, materials, and production technologies that reduce weight, size, and energy consumption and make products that survive the harsh conditions of launch, orbit, and landing — or even operate on the surface of a distant celestial body.\n\nOrganizations including NASA, Boeing, and more have long depended on Altair® HPCWorks®, our HPC and cloud platform, for robust, efficient workload management and more. Altair’s tools are built for a broad spectrum of HPC and cloud workloads plus efficient, high-throughput computing for EDA applications — and trusted to manage, optimize, and measure mission-critical aerospace workloads. Lives depend on quality and precision throughout products’ design, development, and manufacturing; HPC supports some of the most important projects on (and off) the planet and keeps them running at maximum efficiency.\n\nRolls Royce: Convergence of Engineering and Data Science\n\nThe traditional engineering processes ensure that safe and robust products are being developed. However, the growing demand for innovative solutions in short time scales drives the need for a cultural change in the way we work in engineering. Looking at the traditional product life cycle we see that important design decisions tend to be made early during the concept design phase before detailed analysis or test data are available. Data analysis techniques in combination with classical engineering tools can practically help to resolve that conflict by making more useful information available earlier in the process. Consequently the entire process can become more effective.\n\nGlobal ATC\n\nBuilding Reliable Space Products 10x Faster - Altair SimSolid Streamlines Product Development Cycles for Rocket Launch Systems\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing innovative aerospace technologies, the product development and analysis process can be long and tedious. As part of their new generation launch vehicle and spacecraft engine product offerings, Astra was looking for a way to streamline their product development life cycle. While they intended to improve speed and efficiency, it was important that Astra’s team not lose accuracy within their data and remain consistent with their pre-existing test results. With Altair SimSolid, Astra was able to build and analyze better, more reliable products faster. It allowed Astra to perform the expected workload they needed, producing robust results and accurate reporting in a tenth of the time it took other in-house tools currently in use.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nCustomer Stories\n\nFly High with Optimization - Optimizing Camcopter® S-100 Design at Schiebel\n\nUnmanned aerial systems (UAS) are a rapidly evolving technology and used for a variety of civil and military purposes. To ensure airworthiness, UAS manufacturers rely on advanced simulation and manufacturing techniques to create efficient designs. Aerial systems active throughout Europe and operating with diverse payloads for different missions require a reliable vehicle architecture and fuel supply. To ensure perfectly tuned architecture and a lightweight design while increasing stiffness and strength, Schiebel used Altair solutions in combination with 3D printing. The engineers performed various simulations to optimize the design of AM engine parts. Using Altair’s topology optimization structural design tool, Schiebel reduced the weight significantly while maintaining high stiffness. Subsequently, the system was evaluated by laminar and turbulent flow simulation as well as conjugate heat transfer simulation using Altair CFD™. Contacts, NLFE and complex dynamic systems were modeled with Altair® MotionView® and Altair® MotionSolve®. Schiebel also took advantage of APA solutions.\n\nCustomer Stories"
