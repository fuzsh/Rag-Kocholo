        "text": "JDA\n\nUAS / UAM\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft are the fastest-growing sectors in aviation. UAS or “drones,” are being used daily to inspect infrastructure, provide emergency response support, survey agriculture and deliver supplies and to places that are dangerous or hard to access. UAM solutions can help lower the millions of hours wasted on congested highways and roads everyday worldwide. Cities are growing rapidly and traffic congestion is increasing at alarming rates. It’s even worse for the biggest cities. By 2030 there will be 40 megacities that cover less than one-tenth of a percentage point of the surface area of the earth yet are home to 60% of the population and 20% of the global GDP. Traffic isn’t an inconvenience. It’s a mobility crisis.\n\nUAS and UAM are changing how people and goods get from one site to another. The shift is driven by emerging technology, social trends and the viability of electric and hybrid power plants and other alternative systems in connected and autonomous aircraft. Making UAS more viable and UAM a reality takes more than just an aircraft. It takes a systems approach to implementing these innovative aircraft platforms into the national airspace system. UAS and UAM need to address certain regulatory and operational requirements including:\n\nAir Operator Certification (AOC) under 14 CFR Part 135\n\nCommunications and Data Security\n\nConcept of Operations\n\nDetect and Avoid Technology\n\nHeliport/Vertiport Qualifications\n\nOperational Risk Assessment\n\nSafety Management System\n\nType Certification (TC) and Production Certification (PC)\n\nUAS/UAM Air Traffic Management (ATM)\n\nJDA has extensive experience with both small and large scale systems integration including certification of pilots, facilities, ATM, operations, maintenance and aircraft. The most critical item is that safety cannot be compromised for any commercial UAS and UAM operation so “safe but economical” will require a unique approach. Aviation regulatory and safety principles be instilled from the onset, then equivalent but more commercially viable criteria be developed as the system matures and experience grows.\n\nUAM

aviation infrastructure modernization act, advanced air mobility is defined as an air transportation system that transports individuals and property between points using aircraft, such as remotely piloted, autonomous, or vertical take-off and landing aircraft, including those powered by electric or hybrid-electric propulsion, in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace.\n\nThe boeing and wisk conops extends existing airspace concepts and covers uncrewed uam aircraft, fleet operations centers, third-party service providers, vertiports and vertiport managers, and airspace infrastructure.\n\nAirspace link developed airhub, a system to connect cities, states, drone operators, and the faa into a single space to map out the safest routes for autonomous drones using publicly available flight data.\n\nIn the same month, volocopter demonstrated its first public flight of an electric air taxi in france along with remote-controlled flight of its evtol, the volocopter

in the uam aircraft market are vertical aerospace, volocopter, lilium, joby aviation, ehang, aeromobil, pal-v, airbus, xpeng, and opener.\n\nAs further uam aircraft come to fruition and accurate acoustic measurements are gathered for drones and uam aircraft alike then the data necessary to identify relationships between aircraft configuration, phase of flight and noise may be established and embedded within existing or new community noise impact tools.\n\nAirbus urban mobility designs, develops and builds the critical infrastructure necessary to allow new aircraft, including air taxis and delivery drones, to safely enter and share the skies of our future.\n\nAdvancements in battery technology, distributed electric propulsion and automation are driving innovation in this field.\n\nAside

infrastructure for navigation and communications, how would passenger services align with ground, rail, and commercial air services, would there be no-fly zones — such as schools or hospitals — for certain types of aircraft? How can air traffic management handle electric and hybrid air taxis in urban areas?\n\nA future fuel for aviation? Will uam resemble modern airports that host many aircraft, or will passengers and cargo hail drones like a taxi or an uber? Making safe aircraft is part of our professional dna at airbus, and our commitment to providing support for the safety of airbus aircraft in operation applies for as long as an aircraft is in service. The faa issued its first-ever air carrier authorization to an operator utilizing unmanned aircraft systems for package delivery, establishing a foundation supporting future aircraft operations that hold promise in business aviation applications.\n\nWith drones and uam aircraft incorporating multiple and distributed propulsion units, there by multiplying the number of flight control parameters that can be adjusted such as rotor speed or thrust vectoring, the same flight condition may be achieved through different aircraft configurations. Nasa describes advanced air mobility as including small drones, electric aircraft, and automated air traffic management among other technologies to perform a wide variety of missions including cargo and logistics. Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models.\n\nAam encompasses the evolution and safety of aircraft systems, flight operations, airspace, infrastructure, and community engagement. A number of companies are focusing their efforts on hybrid aircraft that can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, fly forward like an airplane, and are powered by quiet, low-emission, electric propulsion systems. Hybrid aircraft, air taxis, evtol, etc. And the recommended safety standards contained in the draft guidance are only applicable to vertiports used by this composite aircraft or by any aircraft within the range of performance characteristics as this composite aircraft.\n\nNbaa was part of a special moment june 28, 2023, when joby aviation received an faa special airworthiness certificate for the first aircraft built at its pilot production line in marina, ca, allowing flight testing to begin. When it comes to established aircraft players like airbus and boeing competing with startups like archer aviation inc. And evtol aircraft among commercial aviation and recreational aviation for the next decade.\n\nHowever, before the first evtol air taxi lifts off, a lot of engineering, technological innovation, and infrastructure development must occur. Additionally, the aircraft would be automated to reduce the load on air traffic controllers and pilots, and they would fly day or night under visual or instrument flight rules, and be supported by automated onboard and ground-based systems. Because evtol aircraft must spend maximum time flying on the wing, it means both evtol and estol aircraft will have a similar approach and departure path, as shown in the diagram below. Major players such as airbus, boeing, and uber are actively investing in uam technology and partnerships to develop and deploy these aircraft. Model used for rotary wing aircraft, do not encompass the performance data for drones and uam aircraft.\n\nWe also appreciated the risky and expensive efforts to design, test, certify, and manufacture evtol aircraft, having just finished a successful development and test program with the airbus vahana technology demonstrator. Emerging evtol vehicles are limited by the relatively low energy density to weight ratio in current battery technology, as well as the lack of infrastructure required for recharging stations. Discover how airbus is driving its development for future aircraft. With tailbeaconx, your evtol or uam aircraft will be globally compliant with airspace regulations for mode c, mode s, or ads-b airspace. Honeywell, pipistrel, vertical aerospace, lilium and other companies are collaborating to create new flight controls for a variety of evtol aircraft.\n\nPresented by sae international and aerospace and defense technology magazine, the inaugural uam and unmanned aircraft summit offers insights into the future development of automated and unmanned aircraft.\n\nuam aircraft solutions\n\nPart 135 AOC\n\nAny UAS organization that plans to operate beyond visual line of site and/or conduct revenue operations carrying cargo must have an operating certificate under Part 135. UAM operators that carry revenue passengers and /or cargo, whether it is piloted or an autonomous must also have an operating certificate under Part 135. JDA has assisted numerous new applicants obtain their Part 135 operating certificate and are supporting both UAS operators and applicants planning future UAM operations.\n\nConcept of Operations (Con Ops) and Operational Risk Assessment (ORA)\n\nEssential for both UAS and UAM operators as well as the aircrfat manufacturers. JDA has developed Con Ops and supported ORA for both operators and manufacturers.\n\nVertiports Design and Qualification\n\nPrimarily a UAM requirement, certification of Heliports/Vertiports is necessary. Electric battery recharging must be considered at all stations, safety requirements, passenger considerations, lighting and refueling stations for hybrid aircraft are just some key issues that must be addressed. JDA’s rotorcraft and heliport design experts know the requirements and safety considerations from their past FAA careers.\n\nUAS and UAM Type Certification (TC) and Production Certification (PC)\n\nFAA 14 CFR Part 21 and Part 23 or EASA Special Conditions serve as the basis for a UAS and UAM TC. JDA team members are well versed and have vast experience in all aspects of both the TC and PC requirements from their time with the FAA and industry, including the new FAA fast track TC process for UAS and the regulatory performance requirements for a UAM TC. Detect and Avoid and other systems unique to UAS and UAM are part of the TC. Production certification is a critical consideration for the design holder. Production may be licensed to a third-party certificated Production Approval Holder (PAH) or the Type Certificate (TC) holder may be the PAH.\n\nCommunications and Data Security\n\nMore the ever communications and data security for UAS and UAM is a very serious and critical requirement that must be addressed. A combination of 5G LTE networks and data encryption technology that “hides” data transmissions and disguises the signal and making it un-hackable is an essential part of the system requirements. JDA has the technology partner to provide the perfect security for your digital communication requirements.\n\nSafety Management System (SMS)\n\nSMS should be implemented at the onset of your UAS or UAM program to ensure continuous hazard identification, risk analysis and mitigation of hazards. The SMS should address the entire program and all stakeholders. JDA is a qualified SMS training and implementation organization and can assist with developing and implementing your SMS.\n\nUAS/UAM ATM\n\nAnother critical system component with technical requirements, operating protocols, and supporting infrastructure and technologies required for an effective system of traffic management. Issues like, community and zoning assimilation, noise, altitude and airspace integration, infrastructure, flight procedures and cyber security all need to be addressed as part of the System JDA experts in flight procedures, Air Traffic Control and ATM can address the full spectrum of operating and managing UAS/UAM air traffic requirements."
