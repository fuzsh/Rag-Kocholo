        "text": "Drones, also known as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), are becoming increasingly popular due to the advancement in digitization. Using a UAS, organizations can capture useful data such as 3D mapping of an area, construction management monitoring, marketing footage, etc.\n\nThankfully, COVID-19 hasn’t negatively impacted the process of getting certified or made it less desirable. Actually, an argument can be made that it will pay off more to get certified due to companies and other individuals being discouraged to travel.\n\nThe purpose of this guide to give a consolidated step-by-step process for becoming certified. Usually, navigating most government-owned websites can be a challenge. However, the FAA does an okay job of laying out the steps, it just requires jumping back and forth through a few websites. Hopefully, this guide makes the overall process a lot easier.\n\nSo, the real questions are:\n\n1. “Why should you consider getting certified?”\n\n2. “How do you get certified?”\n\nWhy should you consider getting certified?\n\nCertifications are always appealing as they are indicative of the worth of an individual to people who don’t know you personally. Becoming UAS certified grants the ability to:\n\n1. Legally charge for commercial UAS work such as construction monitoring, air-view data area modeling/mapping, weddings, commercials, and other work requiring drones as a service (Daas).\n\n2. Request Air Traffic Control (ATC) approval to fly in restricted airspace.\n\n3. Prerequisite for using UAS(s) for automation (delivery, monitoring, agriculture data mapping, etc.)\n\n4. Monetize videos on YouTube. (Generally, this isn’t that heavily moderated, however, it still is technically illegal to use personally recorded drone footage in your monetized videos.)\n\nHow do you get certified?\n\nTo be certified to operate a UAS, you must do the following:\n\n1. Register through the Federal Aircraft Aviation’s (FAA) Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) website for an FAA Tracking Number (FTN).\n\n2. Using that FTN, register for the “Unmanned Aircraft General — Small (UAG)” provided by the FAA through PSI Exams.\n\n3. Pass the UAG test with at least 70%.\n\n4. Submit testing scores to the IACRA website using the FAA form 8710–13.\n\n5. In about 1–2 weeks, you will receive your temporary license and 6–8 weeks you’ll receive your real pilot license.\n\nOfficial UAS Pilot License\n\nRegister for the UAG test.\n\nBelow you will find each step required with a corresponding link of what you need to do to ensure you are ready to go, come test day, and after.\n\nApply for an FTN.\n\nThis is an important first step. Please keep this FTN handy and written down in a convenient place. Without it, you will not be able to register for an exam, nor will you be able to take the exam on your scheduled test day.\n\nChoose a testing center.\n\nYou are no longer allowed to just call up any nearby testing center and schedule an exam. It must be done through the PSI Exam website. The exam has a registration fee of $96. Unfortunately, most official PSI testing centers are closed due to COVID-19. Which just means that you must schedule at a third-party location. Usually, these locations charge a test center fee of $64. Total = $160. My recommendation is to sign up for the most affordable option available and schedule it around 2 weeks out. Having a set test date will force you to study come test day. Check the photos below for the correct test name and examples of what scheduling a test looks like.\n\nTest Description\n\nThe Part 107 exam is relatively easy if you study properly and look at the right information. The test characteristics are as follows:\n\n60 questions\n\n120 minutes\n\nMultiple choice with only 3 options to choose from (A, B, or C)\n\nTopics include:\n\nAirspace classifications and operating requirements\n\nUAS operating laws\n\nWeather and how they affect UAS performance\n\nMETAR/TAF weather reports\n\nEmergency procedures\n\nCrew resource management\n\nRadio communication\n\nPhysiological effects of drugs and alcohol\n\nAirport operations\n\nUAS decision-making and judgment\n\nMaintenance and preflight inspection\n\nAn important question that I am sure many people wonder:\n\n“What happens if I fail?”\n\nThankfully, the ramifications are very low. The worst-case scenario is you lose out on the original testing fee and are required to wait 2 weeks to take the test again. I am more than confident that 99% of all test takers pass on the first try.\n\nStudying\n\nStudying for the test is relatively straight forward. You memorize the topics above and answer a variety of randomized questions on each topic. Below you will find all the resources I used to study for the test.\n\nEstimated study time: 15 hours minimum\n\nVideos: Yes\n\nReading: Yes\n\nPractice test: Yes\n\nResources:\n\nVideo: Tony’s Free Drone Certification Study Guide: FAA Part 107 sUAS Test\n\nWebsite: FAA Part 107 Test Questions (65 Questions Explained) [2020]\n\nDoc: Fact Sheet — Small Unmanned Aircraft Regulations (Part 107)\n\nDoc: AC 107–2 — Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS)\n\nDoc: Remote Pilot — Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Study Guide\n\nMy strategy was to:\n\nWatch Tony’s YouTube video once at 1.5 speed to get the gist of UAS laws and procedures.\n\nTake a practice test.\n\nCategorize by importance the areas of the practice test I did not do well on.\n\nWatch the video a second time note-taking and paying special attention to what I didn’t do well on in the practice test.\n\nTake the practice test again and repeat until I score 100 on the test.\n\nLastly, listen to the video on my way to the testing center at 1.5 speed again as an audiobook.\n\nIn retrospect, this wasn’t the best strategy because a lot of the info has changed from Tony’s video. However, I still was able to pass on my first try.\n\nSo, if you follow this guide, I am sure you will pass on your first try too! Reference the photos above to see a screenshot of Tony's YouTube video and a screenshot of the practice test.\n\nShould you pay for an online school or class?\n\nThe answer to this question is very dependent on you as an individual. Some people may not have the discipline to study this content on their own or they absorb more information with a facilitator. I believe most people will be able to pass without an online school or tutor. However, if you would like to increase your chances of passing or your company/organization pays for it, by all means, the links below are great choices.\n\nDart Drones Certification Program\n\nDrone Pilot Ground School\n\nPilot Institute Part 107 Made Easy\n\nTest Day\n\nI can’t speak for all locations, but the location I went to located in Houston, TX was a very smooth experience. At the testing center, check in with the front desk as their rules could be different. They will ask for your ID and FTN and will set up your workspace. Respecting all social distancing guidelines, they tell you what the rules for testing are. For me, they asked for me to place all of my devices in a basket, said I was able to use the bathroom in the middle of the test if needed, and provided me a calculator.\n\nThe exam software was very simple. You begin with a tutorial that shows you question types, how to answer them, how to mark questions for review, and how to verify you answered all questions. The test took me about 1 hour to finish and the results were immediate.\n\nI was handed 2 sheets of paper. 1. Showed my grade and the general topic areas I missed (which is good for reviewing) and a very important 17-digit knowledge test exam ID. 2. Instructions for what to do with that information.\n\nAfter the test\n\nAs soon as you can, register your results through the IACRA website. You want to complete the FAA Form 8710–13. To do this click on start new application and follow below.\n\nApplication type: “Pilot”\n\nCertifications: “Remote pilot — Initial”\n\nOther path information: “SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM”\n\nClick: “Start Application”\n\nWhen prompted, enter the 17-digit knowledge test exam ID and sign the application for processing (reference screenshot above). There will be a TSA security background check that takes about a week. Shortly after, a temporary remote pilot certificate will be available through IACRA. Finally, your real license will be mailed to your address in about 6–8 weeks. That’s it! You are now certified. Just remember to always keep your license on you when flying and to register your drone if it weighs more than 250g (8.8 ounces) with the link below.\n\nClick here to register your drone with FAA Drone Zone.\n\nOverall\n\nSo, was the process easy? Was it worth it? Yes, and Yes.\n\nIf you follow this guide, the process should go nice and smooth. You’ll be officially flying before you know it.\n\nConnect with these UAS groups and follow these resources to stay in the community and keep your knowledge abreast of any new changes to UAS laws or procedures.\n\nI hope this guide has helped and if you need more help, the information in this guide doesn’t line up, or you want to share your experience, please reach out or connect with me on social.\n\nMore Resources\n\nDrone Webinars with the FAA on YouTube.\n\nDrone/UAS/UAV Community Networking Group.\n\nDrone Pilots and Business Owners.\n\nFAA UAS Symposium\n\nHot Topics in Unmanned Aircraft provided by the FAA.\n\nSocial"
