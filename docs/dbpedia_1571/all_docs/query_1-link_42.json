It will take approximately 6-10 weeks to process and send your permanent certificate.\n\nIf you hold a Part 61 certificate, you can have a representative sign your application and issue you a temporary airman certificate. You will get your permanent certificate via U.S. mail within a few weeks.\n\nMake sure to have your Remote Pilot Certificate readily available whenever you operate your drone.\n\nObtaining your commercial drone pilot certificate is a significant milestone that involves navigating a formal application process with the FAA.\n\nBy diligently following the outlined steps and submitting a complete and accurate application, you can become a certified commercial drone pilot, enabling you to safely and legally operate drones for commercial purposes in full compliance with FAA regulations.\n\nThe Guidelines You Need to Follow as a Commercial Drone Pilot\n\nEarning your part 107 is just the beginning. The onus is upon you to fly responsibly complying with local, state, and federal regulations.\n\nCheck out our Safe Drone Operations course to learn flying skills that will take you from a beginner to an expert drone pilot.\n\nHere are the guidelines for drone operators under Part 107:\n\nYou can fly during daylight (30 minutes before official sunrise to 30 minutes after official sunset, local time) or in twilight if your drone has anti-collision lighting.\n\nMinimum weather visibility is three miles from your control station.\n\nDo not operate your drone from a moving vehicle unless you are flying your drone over a sparsely populated area and it does not involve the transportation of property for compensation or hire.\n\nAlways avoid manned aircraft.\n\nNever operate your drone carelessly or recklessly.\n\nKeep your drone within sight. If you use First Person View or similar technology, you must have a visual observer and always keep your drone within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).\n\nYou cannot be a pilot or visual observer for more than one drone operation at a time.\n\nDo not fly a drone over people unless they are directly participating in the operation.\n\nDo not operate your drone from a moving aircraft.\n\nRelated Reading: Check out “New Drone Laws in the USA” to get more information on the regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\nNOTE: If you are a recreational drone pilot, you need to pass The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST).\n\nTRUST Certificate | Source: Reclaimdrone.com\n\nEssential Considerations for Commercial Drone Pilots\n\nAs a commercial drone operator, it’s crucial to be aware of the special considerations that come with the territory. From insurance requirements to airspace restrictions, these factors can significantly impact your operations.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at a few of these considerations to ensure safe and compliant drone operations.\n\n1. Part 107 Waivers and exemptions for specific operations:\n\nNote: You do not need a waiver to fly a drone following Part 107 rules. You do need a waiver when you want to operate a drone contrary to the rules in Part 107 under the waivable operations listed below.\n\nTo You need a waiver from Fly a small UAS from a moving aircraft or a vehicle in populated areas § 107.25 – Operation from a Moving Vehicle or Aircraft Fly a small UAS at night without anti-collision lighting § 107.29(a)(2) – Operation at night Fly a small UAS during periods of civil twilight without anti-collision lighting § 107.29(b) – Operation at Night Fly a small UAS beyond your ability to clearly determine the position, altitude, attitude, and movement of the sUA, with unaided vision. § 107.31 – Visual Line of Sight Aircraft Operation Use a visual observer without following all visual observer requirements § 107.33 – Visual Observer Fly multiple small UAS with only one remote pilot § 107.35 – Operation of Multiple Small UAS Fly over a person with a small UAS which does not meet conditions of operational categories 1, 2, 3, or 4 § 107.39 – Operation over human beings. Fly a small UAS:\n\nOver 100 miles per hour groundspeed\n\nOver 400 feet above ground level (AGL)\n\nWith less than 3 statute miles of visibility\n\nWithin 500 feet vertically or 2000 feet horizontally from clouds\n\n§ 107.51 – Operating Limitations for Small Unmanned Aircraft Fly over moving vehicles with a small UAS which does not meet conditions of operational categories 1, 2, 3, or 4 § 107.145 – Operations Over Moving Vehicles\n\nRequest a waiver for only what you need to fly your mission. Additionally, you can review the criteria to evaluate waiver applications: Part 107 Waiver – Section Specific Evaluation Information (PDF)\n\n2. Airspace Authorizations\n\nOperations in Class G airspace are allowed without air traffic control (ATC) permission. Class B, C, D, and E airspace operations need ATC authorization.\n\nThe Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) uses desktop and mobile apps designed to support the volume of drone operations with almost real-time airspace authorizations. It is now live at more than 530 FAA ATC facilities covering over 726 airports throughout the country. any authorizations are granted within seconds of being submitted.\n\nCurrently, LAANC only applies to FAA ATC facilities and does not yet include contract or Department of Defense ATC facilities.\n\n3. FAADroneZone\n\nFAADroneZone is a one-stop, online shop for drone registration and for requesting waivers or airspace authorizations (where LAANC is not available).\n\nFAADroneZone Drone Registration\n\n4. B4UFLY App\n\nThe B4UFLY app provides situational awareness to recreational flyers and other drone users, including interactive maps that show where recreational flyers can and cannot fly.\n\nThe B4UFLY app is available for free download on the App Store for iOS and the Google Play Store for Android. In addition to the mobile app, B4UFLY also offers a desktop version for preflight planning and research.\n\nCheck out this video to address any concerns and get clarification about the FAA Part 107 certification:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Do you need a drone pilot license to fly a drone in the USA?\n\nTo operate your drone under the FAA’s Small UAS Rule (Part 107), you must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. If you intend to fly for recreational purposes, you must pass The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST).\n\n2. How do I get FAA approval for drones?\n\nTo fly under Part 107 rules, there are 3 main steps.\n\nStep 1: Learn the Rules\n\nStep 2: Become an FAA-Certified Drone Pilot by Passing the Knowledge Test\n\nStep 3: Register your Drone with the FAA\n\n3. What is the validity of a remote pilot certificate?\n\nThe Remote Pilot Certificate is valid for two years. After that, you’ll need to complete a recurrent training course and pass a knowledge test to renew your certificate.\n\n4. What should I study for the Part 107 aeronautical knowledge test?\n\nStudy materials are available online. Applicants can review the Airman Certification Standards (ACS) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PDF), the Remote Pilot Study Guide (PDF), and the online sample questions (PDF) available on the FAA website."
