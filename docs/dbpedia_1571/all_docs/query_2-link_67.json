Test planning and controls module performance in object-level simulations across thousands of relevant virtual scenarios, varying actors, vehicles, and obstacles, and trace each test scenario back to program requirements.\n\nThe future fight will involve multiple heterogeneous unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) collaborating to achieve mission objectives. Integrate autonomy from multiple vendors or programs to understand how they will interact and collaborate when deployed side-by-side and faced with a battlefield scenario.\n\nâ\n\nUse scenario-based and integration testing to validate the interoperability of distinct systems across thousands of potential scenarios before moving on to real-world testing."
