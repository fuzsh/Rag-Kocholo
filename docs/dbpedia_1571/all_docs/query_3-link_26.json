        "text": "4\n\nResearch Agenda\n\nPRIORITIZATION PROCESS\n\nIncreasingly autonomous (IA) systems will require research and technology development in many areas. In some cases, that research has been and will continue to be motivated for applications other than civil aviation, and there is no need for aviation-specific research in those areas, which include computing, digital communications, sensors, and open-source hardware and software.\n\nThe committee identified a set of high-priority research projects that, if implemented, would address technological issues directly related to the development and application of IA systems in civil aviation. Many of the issues addressed by these projects are related, and many of the research areas included in each project touch on issues of interest to one or more of the other projects. Thus, progress in autonomy research as a whole would be achieved most efficiently by proceeding in a coordinated fashion across multiple areas. Because the identified high-priority projects and the barriers they must overcome are so challenging, they will require government, industry, and academia to perform rigorous and protracted research.\n\nThe committee considered a variety of flight crew interaction scenarios ranging from the existing flight deck and remote pilot options that are available today to optionally piloted, unmanned, and unattended (autonomous) operations. Because progress in research tends to be incremental, the committee anticipates a progressive introduction of IA systems into air traffic management (ATM) systems, crewed aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Similarly, the progressive introduction of UAS operations into shared airspace will also be paced by progress in addressing the high-priority research projects.\n\nTable 4.1 lists the eight high-priority research projects identified by the committee and the barriers addressed by each. A multistep process was used to converge on the eight projects. Committee members were initially briefed by experts in the field and held informal discussions related to these briefings. Each committee member then individually created a list of top research priorities. The compiled list was distributed to the group, organized, and discussed. The committee reached consensus that all of the eight research areas listed in Table 4.1 are a high priority.\n\nThe committee could have ranked the projects based on how effectively they improve individual elements of the Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop or on the extent to which each project contributes to realizing the potential benefits of IA systems described in Chapter 2. However, the contributions of many or most of the research projects are not limited to individual elements of the OODA loop or to the individual benefits that IA systems can provide.\n\nTable 4.1 Mapping of High-Priority Research Projects to the Barriers\n\nNOTE: Black squares indicate that a research project will make a vital contribution to overcoming the corresponding barrier. Circles indicate that the research project will make an important but less vital contribution. Empty cells indicate that the research project will make at best a minor contribution.\n\nAlternatively, the committee could have decided to rank the research projects based on how many barriers they address. However, as the shown in the table, all eight projects address multiple barriers, and the collective research agenda addresses all barriers to some extent. Also, outputs from all of the research projects are ultimately required to allow introducing advanced IA systems into the National Airspace System (NAS).\n\nThe committee concluded, accordingly, that level of difficulty and degree of urgency would be the most suitable bases for categorizing the high-priority research projects, because it is those criteria that are most directly related to (1) the extent to which the current state of the art must be advanced; (2) the time and resources needed to make those advances; and (3) the time-phased application of research project results in the overall scheme of developing ever-more-capable IA systems, bringing them to market, and deploying them operationally.\n\nBased on the committee’s perception of level of difficulty and urgency, research projects 1 through 4 were determined to be particularly urgent and difficult to accomplish. Projects 5 through 8 are also to be given high priority, but they were determined to be less urgent and/or less difficult. The committee did not rank the research projects within each group of four; instead, they are listed alphabetically.\n\nMOST URGENT AND MOST DIFFICULT RESEARCH PROJECTS\n\nThis section describes the four most urgent and most difficult high-priority research projects. The first project addresses the fundamental need to better characterize and bound the behavior of adaptive/nondeterministic systems. The second describes research in system architectures and technologies that would enable increasingly sophisticated IA systems and unmanned aircraft to operate for extended periods of time without real-time human cognizance and control. The third calls for the development of the theoretical basis and methodologies for using modeling and simulation to accelerate the development and maturation of advanced IA systems and aircraft. The fourth calls for research to develop standards and processes for the verification, validation, and certification of IA systems. For each research project, background information is followed by a description of specific research areas and how they would support the development of IA systems for civil aviation.\n\nBehavior of Adaptive/Nondeterministic Systems\n\nDevelop Methodologies to Characterize and Bound the Behavior of Adaptive/Nondeterministic Systems over Their Complete Life Cycle\n\nAdaptive/nondeterministic properties will be integral to many advanced IA systems, but they will create challenges for assessing and setting the limits of their resulting behaviors. Advanced IA systems for civil aviation operate in an uncertain environment where physical disturbances, such as wind gusts, are often modeled using probabilistic models. These IA systems may rely on distributed sensor systems that have noise with stochastic properties such as uncertain biases and random drifts over time and under varying environmental conditions. Adaptive/nondeterministic IA systems take advantage of evolving conditions and past experience to improve their performance. As these IA systems take over more functions traditionally performed by humans, there will be a growing need to incorporate autonomous monitoring and other safeguards to ensure continued appropriate operational behavior.\n\nThere is a tension between the benefits of incorporating software with adaptive/nondeterministic properties in IA systems and the requirement to test such software for safe and assured operation. Research is needed to develop new methods and tools to address the inherent uncertainties in airspace system operations and thereby assure the safety of complex adaptive/nondeterministic IA systems.\n\nSpecific tasks to be carried out by this research project include the following:\n\nDevelop mathematical models for describing adaptive/nondeterministic processes as applied to humans and machines. New mathematical models for describing adaptive, nondeterministic, and learning processes as applied to humans and machines are desirable to support the design and testing challenges of IA systems. Current approaches often rely on linearized models with simple normal probability distributions to characterize uncertainty. These simplified representations often do not adequately capture the complexities of IA systems. More complex models create challenges to the design community as their tools commonly assume the same linearized, normally distributed characterizations. The potential behaviors of complex and adaptive/nondeterministic systems operating in environments with many sources of random inputs can quickly overwhelm the conventional tools used in exhaustive deterministic simulation testing. The desired mathematical models would support the goals for effective testing over the wide range of operational conditions as well as support the community that designs algorithms with the desired performance and robustness properties.\n\nDevelop performance criteria, such as stability, robustness, and resilience, for the analysis and synthesis of adaptive/nondeterministic behaviors. Performance criteria for such systems, including operational mission envelopes, stability margins, robustness in the face of uncertainty, and resilience to unanticipated events, are needed so that both the design and test communities can effectively account for adaptive/nondeterministic behaviors. These performance criteria would apply and scale to various levels and applications of IA systems, including basic flight performance, onboard aircraft operational decision making, and ATM. Tools to\n\nsolutions. For example, detect-and-avoid systems should be able to handle deconfliction scenarios with other aircraft that are not equipped with ADS-B and with aircraft whose pilots who respond inappropriately to traffic alerts.\n\nInvestigate airspace structures that could support UAS operations in confined or pre-approved operating areas using methods such as geofencing. Aircraft performing missions such as agricultural or pipeline inspections typically operate over unpopulated areas at low altitudes. Such missions pose little risk to people or property on the ground but may pose risk to other aircraft. IA systems for geofencing can ensure a vehicle operates within a given airspace volume designated by constraints on altitude ceiling, latitude, longitude, and, in some cases, time. Such a geofencing system will likely need to be matured and certified even if other systems on the geofenced aircraft are not. For geofencing to be useful, IA systems would also need to support dynamic allocation of (low-altitude) airspace to geofenced flight operations. Such IA systems can reduce collision risk for both geofenced and legacy aircraft.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has invested substantial effort in technologies related to this research project. Areas of interest include autopilots for fighters that can execute and recover from maneuvers that may induce pilots to lose consciousness, unmanned aircraft that can continue a mission or return home following loss of the communications link to ground operators, and UAS ground stations from which one operator is responsible for multiple unmanned aircraft. NASA has studied IA systems for airspace management and loss-of-control prevention and has successfully demonstrated that unattended operation of orbiting spacecraft can reduce mission costs. Numerous researchers and commercial vendors are developing and demonstrating IA systems with the potential to eliminate the requirement for continuous human cognizance and control for robotic system applications, including small unmanned aircraft and automotive applications. DOD, NASA, and industry have the expertise to pursue efforts in this research direction. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has historically presumed continuous human cognizance and control, would need to expand its expertise and engage the community in this research task to efficiently establish standards and policies to authorize the operation of unmanned aircraft without continuous human oversight.\n\nModeling and Simulation\n\nDevelop the Theoretical Basis and Methodologies for Using Modeling and Simulation to Accelerate the Development and Maturation of Advanced IA Systems and Aircraft\n\nModeling and simulation capabilities will play an important role in the development, implementation, and evolution of IA systems in civil aviation because they enable researchers, designers, regulators, and operators to understand how something performs without real-life testing. Civil aviation has leveraged modeling and simulation throughout its history. Examples include computational fluid dynamic models and human-in-the-loop simulations to test operational concepts and decision support tools. Modeling and simulation enable insights into system performance without necessarily incurring the expense and risk associated with actual operations. Furthermore, computer simulations may be able to test the performance of some IA systems in literally millions of scenarios in a short time to produce a statistical basis for determining safety risks and establishing the confidence of IA system performance.\n\nResearchers and designers are likely to make use of modeling and simulation capabilities to evaluate design alternatives. Developers of IA systems will be able to train adaptive (i.e., learning) algorithms through repeated simulated operations. Such capabilities could also be used to train human operators.\n\nModeling and simulation capabilities will be a tool leveraged in addressing several of the other projects identified in this report, such as characterizing the behavior of adaptive/nondeterministic systems; generating the data and artifacts needed for VV&C; generating data for determining how IA systems could enhance the safety and efficiency of the civil aviation system; providing a mechanism to evaluate stakeholder roles and responsibilities and human–machine interfaces of IA systems; and producing data to inform rulemaking and policy changes.\n\ndeveloping them in a manner that allows them to be integrated through established standards. These elements also need to be readily accessible. A mechanism could be established that would allow organizations involved with researching and developing IA systems to share modeling components. This would facilitate reuse of previously developed components, saving time and resources.\n\nDevelop standards and methodologies for accrediting IA models and simulations. Given the importance of modeling and simulation capabilities to the creation, evaluation, and evolution of IA systems, mechanisms will be needed to ensure that these capabilities perform as intended. Just as computational fluid dynamic models are validated with wind tunnel tests, and wind tunnels are validated with flight tests, a means to validate the modeling and simulation capabilities for IA systems will be needed.\n\nVerification, Validation, and Certification\n\nDevelop Standards and Processes for the Verification, Validation, and Certification of IA Systems and Determine Their Implications for Design\n\nThe high levels of safety achieved in the operation of the NAS largely reflect the formal requirements imposed by the FAA for VV&C of hardware and software and the certification of personnel as a condition for entry into the system. These processes have evolved over many decades and represent the cumulative experience of all elements of civil aviation—manufacturers, regulators, pilots, controllers, other operators—in the operation of that system. Although viewed by some as unnecessarily cumbersome and expensive, VV&C processes are critical to the continued safe operation of the NAS.\n\nExisting VV&C standards and processes are inadequate for the development and regulation of advanced IA systems with attributes such as nondeterministic outcomes, emergent behaviors, vehicle teaming, and software and/or system changes arising from machine learning. Current practice involves a comprehensive examination of all system states in all known conditions. This approach is neither practical nor feasible from the standpoints of timeliness and affordability for adaptive/nondeterministic IA systems. Fixed-logic models that contain closed-world assumptions, where all system interactions are predetermined and known, are unable to account for unplanned events falling outside the conditions that were considered in the reasoning process. Given the inevitable uncertainty of the real-world environment, current safety methods rely heavily on the human operator to mitigate system anomalies and unanticipated events. With IA systems, a portion of this responsibility would shift to the IA system.\n\nSpecific tasks to be carried out by this research project include the following:\n\n• Characterize and define requirements for intelligent software and systems. The issue of trust resides in trust verification and trust validation5 for both the software-based “intelligence” and the systems in which it is embedded. The ability of such systems to function acceptably in real-world conditions requires the development of trust in the IA system. Thus, it will be important to identify and characterize the attributes, characteristics, and metrics required to enable trust verification of the intelligent software used by advanced IA systems through interaction with testers and/or examiners in a manner analogous to how human performance is assessed in civil airspace today.\n\n• Improve the fidelity of the VV&C test environment. To ensure that the VV&C processes for IA systems can substantiate the intended requirements to effectively manage unplanned events, novel new verification and validation (V&V) tools, criteria, and evaluation methodologies need to be developed, including representative test cases and trust metrics that fully identify and characterize the capabilities of IA systems. This will require significant research in V&V methodologies, focusing on the full range of uncertain behaviors and environmental conditions expected to be encountered in the airspace system. Stress testing of this underlying IA system logic will assess the extent to which nominal, off-nominal, and even unanticipated\n\n___________________\n\ncases can be accommodated. Confronting the full IA system with as-yet-to-be-experienced situations in realistic scenarios (e.g., detecting taxiing aircraft on a runway during final approach) is key to identifying shortcomings in the capabilities of an advanced IA system. Using objective measures within this evaluation process is intended to lead to greater predictability and trust in the logic of the IA system. To maintain an equivalent level of safety, it is incumbent on the developers to assure that IA systems have undergone these rigorous V&V processes, including safety risk assessments. Mission diversity and complexity create design challenges, because the decision making, sensing, and experience level required may vary significantly from mission to mission. This complexity and diversity will require the system to be completely reconfigurable to ensure safe and successful mission execution, creating challenges for the VV&C process. Elements of this research include the following:\n\n—Integration of modeled and actual subsystems, such as sensors, reasoning algorithms, hardware components, and human operators.\n\n—Simulation of low- and high-fidelity tests.\n\n—Research into VV&C processes for interoperability frameworks that allow rapidly configurable trust verification and trust validation.\n\n—Investigation of the impacts of system- and mission-level disruptions in the human-hardware-software system, such as the loss of Global Positioning System inputs, control links, and sensors.\n\n• Develop, assess, and propose new certification standards. In addition to the development of rigorous new V&V processes, new certification standards and practices will need to be written with guidance for the regulatory authorities on understanding how IA systems function and what it will take to establish a means of compliance with the yet-to-be-established certification processes for advanced IA systems. Once certified, it may be necessary to continually monitor IA system compliance with requirements and to assess the performance of nondeterministic IA systems as they learn and adapt. Elements of this research include the following:\n\n—Establishment of criteria and standards uniquely focused on the emergent behaviors of nondeterministic IA systems and approaches for assuring continual adherence to these standards.\n\n—Identification of critical pass-fail boundaries that can be used to assure safe operation of IA systems for different mission sets in civil airspace.\n\n—Exploration of novel certification approaches that would take place concurrently with the design and development of advanced IA systems, as well as novel techniques to enable continuous retest of nondeterministic IA systems.\n\n• Define new design requirements and methodologies for IA systems. In the course of setting a clear path to certification and eventual deployment, unique design requirements could be created for IA systems so that they can interoperate with other elements of the NAS. Emergent behaviors could lead to fundamental changes to the design methodologies and design characteristics required of the IA systems. For example, to understand and accept an IA system’s actions as reasonable and predictable, it will be critical to understand the underlying logic of the decision-making process. Understanding the logic enables the stakeholders within the airspace to infer intent, which adds to the system’s predictability, credibility, and trust. New design frameworks need to address mission diversity and complexity while simultaneously simplifying the VV&C process for IA systems. Elements of this research include the following:\n\n—Investigation of new and agile system design approaches and methodologies to enable integration into civil airspace and trust in IA systems.\n\n—Enabling transparency for the rationale and decision making of an IA system for given situations.\n\n—Development of high-level intelligent software tools to reveal an IA system’s underlying logic in situ and, if required, alter it.\n\n—Creation of design frameworks (interoperability, complex networks, plug and play, and so on) that address mission complexity and diversity while simplifying VV&C processes.\n\n• Understand the impact that airspace system complexity has on IA system design and on VV&C. The effectiveness of IA systems will depend significantly on how they interact with the NAS. Real-world operational\n\nissues such as system latency, degraded sensor performance, and intermittency of communications will be amplified by mission and environmental conditions. Elements of this research include the following:\n\n—Developing design methodologies that effectively and comprehensively address IA system requirements over a broad range of intended operating conditions, encompassing geographical complexity (e.g., rural versus urban), mission complexity (e.g., single vehicles used for agriculture versus multiple high-precision aircraft), and environmental changes (e.g., weather anomalies).\n\n—Developing the ability to leverage the maturation of IA systems over time with regard to airspace complexity, such as acquisition of experiential knowledge of operations at diverse classes of civil airspace and analysis of incidents, accidents, and other anomalies involving IA systems.\n\n• Develop VV&C methods for products created using nontraditional methodologies and technologies. Some new civil aviation products will be developed using nontraditional methodologies and technologies (see the discussion below of the research project of the same name). The deployment and operation of products such as consumer electronics provide large amounts of user data that can be used for validation and verification when the technology is applied to civil aviation. Although the information generated from deployment in one application or industry is not complete, it could nevertheless be considered in the overall certification process. Furthermore, unconventional techniques such as crowd sourcing6 can increase levels and volumes of testing, including the diversity and uniqueness of test scenarios that could not or would not be achieved by traditional methods. These or similar test techniques might be used in conjunction with more traditional test methodologies to accelerate the acceptance process.\n\nADDITIONAL HIGH-PRIORITY RESEARCH PROJECTS\n\nThis section describes four additional high-priority research projects. They are distinguished from the four already discussed by their lower degree of urgency and/or difficulty. The first of these final four research projects would develop methodologies for accepting technologies not traditionally used in civil aviation in IA systems. The second focuses on how the roles of key personnel and systems, as well as human–machine interfaces, should evolve to enable the operation of advanced IA systems. The third would analyze how IA systems could enhance the safety and efficiency of civil aviation. The fourth would investigate processes to engender broad stakeholder trust in IA systems for civil aviation. For each research project, background information is followed by a description of specific research areas and how they would support the development of IA systems for civil aviation.\n\nNontraditional Methodologies and Technologies\n\nDevelop Methodologies for Accepting Technologies Not Traditionally Used in Civil Aviation (e.g., Open-Source Software and Consumer Electronic Products) in IA Systems\n\nMany key elements of IA systems have their roots in the commercial world of information technology, which has long tended toward increasing capability at decreasing cost. The same cannot be said of aircraft avionics. Civil aviation in general and IA systems in particular can benefit directly and indirectly from a broad variety of technologies developed through other nontraditional methods in areas that include low-cost, high-capability computing systems; digital communications; miniaturized sensor technology; position, navigation, and timing systems; open-source hardware and software; mobile communications and computing devices; and small unmanned aircraft developed for personal or hobbyist use. Furthermore, IA technologies have the potential to spawn new nontraditional uses, applications, and industries. Methodologies are needed that would enable IA systems that incorporate these nontraditional technologies to be integrated in the NAS.\n\nEnabling the acceptance of nontraditional technologies, methods, and uses can have a variety of immediate and future benefits. For example, the large and growing community of hobbyists who work on UAS is currently\n\n___________________\n\nRoles of Personnel and Systems\n\nDetermine How the Roles of Key Personnel and Systems, As Well As Related Human–Machine Interfaces, Should Evolve to Enable the Operation of Advanced IA Systems\n\nEffectively integrating humans and machines in the civil aviation system has been a high priority and sometimes an elusive design challenge for decades. Human–machine integration may become an even greater challenge with the advent of advanced IA systems. Although the reliance on high levels of automation in crewed aircraft has increased the overall levels of system safety, persistent and seemingly intractable issues arise in the context of incidents and accidents.\n\nThe very nature of IA systems dictates the need for new methods to interface and interact with their human operators and other counterparts. The prospect of shared human–machine intelligence presents daunting challenges ranging from technical to infrastructural to ethical. The emergence of advanced IA capabilities in civil aviation will also require changes to the definition and management of operations within the NAS. The role of key personnel and systems will evolve in response to these changes. In some instances new roles may be added while others become less significant or cease to add value. Advanced IA systems may reduce the number of air traffic controllers, pilots, and other human operators needed by the NAS, while the need for IA system management and supervision might actually increase. Some of today’s active control roles will transition to monitoring functions and may ultimately become extinct. In any case, the roles of these key personnel will have to be revisited in relation to their contribution to and impact on the NAS and the requirements imposed by the adoption of emerging technologies.\n\nMuch of the research to be conducted revolves around the roles that human beings currently play and the roles that they should play in interacting with intelligent machines. There is no simple answer. In fact, the answer depends on the nature of the system intelligence and can be expected to change over time as technologies and machine capabilities evolve. As an example, in contrast to the nearly continuous interaction that a pilot has with a highly automated flight control system, which is now the case on commercial transports, interactions between an intelligent, autonomous mission management system and its human supervisor could be highly intermittent. As it now stands, the flight control system executes its decision cycle an order of magnitude (or more) faster than the pilot, who issues input commands via manual ergonomic means (e.g., stick or yoke, rudder pedals, throttle) and specifies the coordinates of way points. In the not-too-distant future, advanced IA systems may be able to assume primary responsibility for functions such as hazardous weather avoidance.\n\nMore capable IA systems will offer opportunities for reallocation of functions within the integrated human–machine system. Where practical, humans and machines could each be allocated the functions for which they are best suited while maintaining a secondary capability in functions assigned to the other one. Individual and systemic resilience would be enhanced by maintaining this degree of dual functionality. However, many of the functional issues ascribed to today’s automated systems can be traced to some combination of overlapping capabilities (manual operation vs. automated function), insufficient integration of these functions, and deficiencies in system design and/or training that impede the smooth transition from one mode to the other under some operating conditions.\n\nThe allocation of functions between humans and machines could be dynamic, allowing role changes based on evolving factors such as fatigue, risk, and surprise. Regardless, new methods are and will be needed for advanced IA systems to assure that human operators smoothly transition to a more proactive command-and-control mode, as needed. As the intelligence of IA systems advances, new opportunities for improved decision making and task execution by the human-machine system will arise, and additional research will be needed to determine how best to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nThe human–system integration problem becomes even more complex with the hierarchical control imposed by flight in managed airspace. This system-of-systems problem, involving onboard pilots, remote UAS operators, intelligent machines, air traffic controllers, and an intelligent ATM network, is perhaps the most daunting human–system integration challenge that civil aviation will face, and overcoming it will require research in relevant technical disciplines and social sciences.\n\nto be developed to enable the required situational awareness. It could also explore sensor options that can reproduce the value added from the pilot’s seat-of-the-pants experience for both the onboard IA system and the remote operator, if warranted. Sensor research could also explore the cuing required for off-board operators to remain effective during remote operating conditions.\n\nSafety and Efficiency\n\nDetermine How IA Systems Could Enhance the Safety and Efficiency of Civil Aviation\n\nAs with other new technologies, poorly implemented IA systems could put at risk the high levels of efficiency and safety that are the hallmarks of civil aviation, particularly for commercial air transportation. However, done properly, advances in IA systems could enhance both the safety and the efficiency of civil aviation. For example, IA systems have the potential to reduce reaction times in safety-critical situations, especially in circumstances that today are encumbered by the requirement for human-to-human interactions. The ability of IA capabilities to rapidly cue operators or potentially render a fully autonomous response in safety-critical situations could improve both safety and efficiency. IA systems could substantially reduce the occurrence of these classes of accidents, which are typically ascribed to operator error. These benefits could be of particular value in those segments of civil aviation, such as general aviation and medical evacuation helicopters, that have accident rates much higher than commercial air transports.\n\nWhether on board an aircraft or in ATM centers, IA systems also have the potential to reduce manpower requirements, thereby increasing the efficiency of operations and reducing operational costs.\n\nWhere IA systems make it possible for small unmanned aircraft to replace crewed aircraft, the risks to persons and property on the ground in the event of an accident could be greatly reduced owing to the reduced damage footprint in those instances, and the risk to air crew is eliminated entirely.\n\nSpecific tasks to be carried out by this research project include the following:\n\nAnalyze accident and incident records to determine where IA systems may have prevented or mitigated the severity of specific accidents or classes of accidents. A wealth of historic accident and incident data, including causal information, is archived and available for study. Research could focus on understanding if root causes could have been countered by an IA system and, if not, if an IA system could have mitigated or prevented the consequences of the incident or accident. This research could also explore other methods for avoidance and mitigation to achieve balance and reduce any bias toward IA approaches. Such research could be broad based, assessing the risk to people and property posed by aircraft of widely varying sizes, weights, performance characteristics, and missions, and by various types of operations (ramp, ground, transport, etc.), affording a comprehensive perspective on the value proposition for IA systems and capabilities in this regard.\n\nDevelop and analytically test methodologies to determine how the introduction of IA systems in flight operations, ramp operations by aircraft and ground support equipment, ATM systems, airline operation control centers, and so on might improve safety and efficiency. This task would develop quantifiable methods of assessing the value of IA capabilities for various elements of the NAS. Methods of interest could include measures of merit and key performance parameters that map onto safety and efficiency metrics. For example, this research element could develop guidelines and methods to allow current safety methodologies, including nonpunitive incident reporting programs such as the Flight Operations Quality Assurance program and the FAA’s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing system, to help assess the impact of operational IA systems on safety and efficiency. The analysis tools would be able to model the effects, both positive and negative, of IA systems on other portions of the NAS. This research could also determine the training, education, and experience requirements for systems safety personnel, such as accident investigators and airworthiness and operations inspectors, who are involved with IA systems operations.\n\nInvestigate airspace structures and operating procedures to ensure safe and efficient operations of legacy and IA systems in the NAS. The introduction of IA systems will increase the complexity and diversity of the NAS, which is already struggling with legacy systems and high traffic volumes. The introduction of\n\nlarge numbers of UAS by hobbyists, farmers, law enforcement agencies, and others would bring new complexities and place additional stress on the NAS. Airspace partitioning is one of the fundamental tools of risk management used in the current aviation system. Various categories of airspace are defined based on a great variety of factors, including weather, terrain, time of day (day vs. night), traffic type, traffic density, aircraft equipage and performance, and crew qualifications. These factors determine which operations are permitted in a particular region of airspace at any given time. Advanced IA systems might present an opportunity and/or an incentive to redesign some regions of civil airspace, operating conditions, and rules. For example, IA systems might make it feasible and beneficial to dynamically reconfigure some airspace to improve the safety and efficiency of airspace for selected applications.\n\nStakeholder Trust\n\nDevelop Processes to Engender Broad Stakeholder Trust in IA Systems in the Civil Aviation System\n\nIA systems can fundamentally change the relationship between people and technology. Although increasingly used as an engineering term in the context of software and security assurance, trust is a social term and becomes increasingly relevant to human–machine interactions when technological complexity exceeds human capacity to fully understand its behavior. Trust is not a trait of the system; it is the system status in the mind of human beings based on their perception of and experience with the system. Trust concerns the attitude that a person or technology will help achieve specific goals in a situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability.9 It is the perception of trustworthiness that influences how people respond to a system.\n\nTrust in technology is different from trust between people, but there are similarities. Increasing levels of autonomy can blur the distinction from trust in people and trust in technology, because the advanced IA systems might behave in ways that are hard to differentiate from the ways of a person. The basis of this trust includes experience with the system, an understanding of the underlying process, and knowledge of its purpose. Trust can also be based on the recommendation of third parties based on their experience or on their formal certification of a system, or it can reflect informal information sharing that defines the reputation of the trustee. Importantly, the trust engendered by a technology depends in part on an analytic assessment of its capabilities, but it also depends on an intuitive assessment of its behavior.\n\nFostering an appropriate level of trust in IA systems is critical to overcoming barriers to adoption and acceptance by the broad stakeholder community, which includes operators, supervisors, acquirers, patrons, regulators, designers, insurers, the operating community, and the general public. An individual operator who interacts with an IA system but harbors unwarranted skepticism about the reliability and performance of autonomous systems in general might fail to capitalize on their capabilities and instead rely on less efficient approaches. At the societal level, unwarranted skepticism might cause patrons to seek other services, and the public might even push for legislation that unnecessarily limits the pace of innovation. On the other hand, excessive trust could lead to failures to adequately supervise imperfect IA systems, potentially resulting in accidents and a loss of trust that could be very difficult to regain. Trust influences how people respond to IA systems across various organizational levels, circumstances, and timescales.\n\nAlthough closely related to V&V and certification, trust warrants attention as a distinct research topic because formal certification does not guarantee trust and adoption. A significant component of this project could be cybersecurity and related issues. Trustworthiness depends on the intent of designers and on the degree to which the design prevents both inadvertent and intentional corruption of system data and processes.\n\nSpecific tasks to be carried out by this research project include the following:\n\nIdentify the objective attributes of trustworthiness and develop measures of trust that can be tailored to a range of applications, circumstances, and relevant stakeholders. A central challenge in supporting effective\n\n___________________\n\nFor each of these organizations, it will be important to involve researchers with relevant expertise who might not normally see themselves as addressing civil aviation issues. For example, most research and development activity related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics is not taking place in the context of IA systems for civil aviation, but it will be essential to draw on the latest research and development in these areas to most effectively carry out some of the research projects.\n\nEach of the high-priority research projects overlaps to some extent with one or more of the other projects, and each would be best addressed by multiple organizations working in concert. There is already some movement in that direction.\n\nThe FAA has created the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Office to foster collaboration with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including DOD, NASA, industry, academia, and technical standards organizations. The FAA is working with this broad community to support safe and efficient integration of UAS in the NAS. Key activities include the development of regulations, policies, guidance material, and training requirements. In addition, the FAA is coordinating with relevant departments and agencies to address related policy areas such as privacy and national security, and in 2015 it will establish an air transportation center of excellence for UAS research, engineering, and development.11,12\n\nThe Senior Policy Committee that oversees the work of the NextGen Joint Planning and Development Office is chaired by the Secretary of Transportation and includes representatives from the FAA, NASA, DOD, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The NextGen Program is executing a multiagency research and development plan to improve the NAS. The Senior Policy Committee views the integration of UAS into the NAS as a national priority and, to that end, in 2012 it published the NextGen Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research, Development and Demonstration Roadmap Version 1.0. As the title suggests, this document describes an approach for coordinating UAS research, development, and demonstration projects across the agencies involved in NextGen.\n\nThere are also positive indications of coordination in the recreational or hobbyist unmanned aircraft community. There are many websites that share open-source software and hardware, with open forums that enable widespread sharing of ideas, techniques, and methods for achieving IA operations of small, amateur-built UAS. However, these activities are largely undertaken without consideration of issues such as certification and thus are generating designs and approaches that might be technologically advanced but could be certified for use in the civil aviation system only with great difficulty, if at all. Since these systems are not verified or validated for qualities such as robustness, completeness, and fault tolerance, the ultimate contribution of this sector to the advancement of IA systems in the NAS remains to be seen.\n\nThe collaborative interagency and private efforts described above are necessary and could be strengthened to assure that the full scope of IA research and development efforts (not just those focused on UAS applications) are effectively coordinated and integrated, with minimal duplication of research and without critical gaps. In particular, more effective coordination among relevant organizations in government, academia, and industry would help execute the recommended research projects more efficiently, in part by allowing lessons learned from the development, test, and operation of IA systems to be continuously applied to ongoing activities.\n\nThe recommended research agenda would directly address the technology barriers and the regulation and certification barriers. As noted in Table 4.1, although several research projects would address the social and legal issues, the agenda would not address the full range of these issues. In the absence of any other action, resolution of the legal and social barriers will likely take a long time, as court cases are filed to address various issues in various locales on a case-by-case basis, with intermittent legislative action taken in reaction to highly publicized court cases, accidents, and the like. A more timely and effective approach for resolving the legal and social barriers could begin with discussions involving the Department of Justice, FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, state attorneys general, public interest legal organizations, and aviation community stakeholders. The discussion of some related issues may also be informed by social science research. Given that the FAA is the federal govern-\n\n___________________\n\nment’s lead agency for establishing and implementing aviation regulations, it is in the best position to take the lead in initiating a collaborative and proactive effort to address legal and social barriers.\n\nExecuting the research agenda set forth in this report would require significant resources from multiple federal agencies and research organizations. However, substantial advances could be achieved using currently available resources. In large part, the primary responsibilities of specific agencies for given elements of the research agenda will be determined by the resident expertise and specialized research facilities. For example, as noted above, there is one critical, crosscutting challenge that must be overcome to unleash the full potential of advanced IA systems in civil aviation: How can we assure that advanced IA systems—especially those systems that rely on adaptive/ nondeterministic software—will enhance rather than diminish the safety and reliability of the NAS? Executing the research projects that will overcome this critical challenge would require a broad mix of expertise, analytic capabilities, and specialized facilities that are resident at research, development, test, and manufacturing organizations within NASA, the FAA, DOD, industry, and academia. It would also require an ongoing commitment of resources and expertise and a willingness to work together toward a shared goal.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nCivil aviation in the United States and elsewhere in the world is on the threshold of profound changes in the way it operates because of the rapid evolution of IA systems. Advanced IA systems will, among other things, be able to operate without direct human supervision or control for extended periods of time and over long distances. As happens with any other rapidly evolving technology, early adapters sometimes get caught up in the excitement of the moment, producing a form of intellectual hyperinflation that greatly exaggerates the promise of things to come and greatly underestimates costs in terms of money, time, and—in many cases—unintended consequences or complications. While there is little doubt that over the long run the potential benefits of IA in civil aviation will indeed be great, there should be equally little doubt that getting there, while maintaining or improving the safety and efficiency of U.S. civil aviation, will be no easy matter. Furthermore, given that the potential benefits of advanced IA systems—as well as the unintended consequences—will inevitably benefit some stakeholders much more than others, the enthusiasm of the latter for fielding such systems could be limited. In any case, overcoming the barriers identified in this report by pursuing the research agenda proposed by the committee is a vital next step, although more work beyond the issues identified here will certainly be needed as the nation ventures into this new era of flight."
