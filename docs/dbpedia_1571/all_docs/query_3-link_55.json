        "meta_description": "Accurate predictions of wildfire spread are critical for effective wildfire management to support decision makings of fire managers and to ensure safety of firefighters. However, the lack of real time wildfire and wind data, both of which change in space and time, makes it difficult to achieve operational wildfire spread prediction. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) is emerging in many civilian applications and shows great potential in wildfire management. This project aims to develop and evaluate a collaborative human-UAS wildfire spread prediction and situational-awareness system for wildfire management. The UASs will work side-by-side with fire managers and ground firefighters to perform collaborative tasks. This new paradigm brings new research challenges from multiple aspects. First and foremost, the UASs must achieve sufficient autonomy in their mission so that they can autonomously collect the most useful information in dynamic wildfire environments. Besides wildfire sensing, the UASs also need to pay close attention to firefighters",

Nothing Reported\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? We report our accomplishments for each goal separately, as below. 1. Fire sensing, wind estimation, and data assimilation to enable data driven wildfire simulation. 1.1 Designed, built, flight tested two low-cost UAS for fire sensing applications, called KHawk-Thermal fixed-wing UAS and KHawk CarbonQuad multirotor UAS. Both UAS are equipped with a thermal camera. 1.2 Achieved system identification of small fixed-wing UAS using frequency domain methods and performed model-based innerloop controller design 1.3 Developed a UAS based fire perimeter sensing system, which is guided by a human operator. Multiple fire RGB/NIR maps have been generated at preset time intervals after each flight test. 1.4 Developed a new method for measurement of fire line location and rate of spread (ROS) based on sequential UAS thermal maps. The method is validated using the October 2019 Welda KS prescribed fire data (IJRS 2022). 1.5 Proposed a new method for spatiotemporal representation of grass fire evolution using time labeled UAS NIR orthomosaics generated from aerial images with limited footprints. (JSTARS 2022) 1.6 Performed a systematic comparison between thermal and NIR aerial imagery for grass fire detection using the generated GRAFFITI data set (MS thesis). 1.7 Provide a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for wind sensing and estimation using small fixed-wing UAS (JAIS2021). 1.8 Developed a 9-state-Extended Kalman Filter which uses UAS GPS/inertial/pressure measurements for mean wind estimation at the flame height (SciTech). 1.9 Generated preliminary results for the prevailing wind and turbulence estimation using UAS flight data collected when flying through fire-generated plumes (AMS). 1.10 Developed the capability of prescribed fire ignition modeling for symmetrically modeling different ignition techniques of prescribed fires, and applied it to simulating the prescribed fire event of Welda, Kansas in October 2019. Simulation results were compared with real data collected from UAS. A journal paper has been published based on this work. 1.11 Developed a prototype map-based prescribed fire simulation system. The system allows users to define ignition procedures and simulate the fire growth using a map-based tool. 1.12 Developed a data assimilation algorithm for assimilating real-time and noisy fire location data extracted from UAS' monitoring into the fire spread simulation. 2. UAS path planning 2.1. Developed and analyzed a real-time on-board path planning algorithm for UAS-based wildfire monitoring with uneven importance. With this path planning algorithm, the UAS more frequently visits the regions that have more active spreading behaviors. 2.2. Extended the previous algorithm to support multi-UAS path planning for fire front monitoring. 2.3. Added the capability of displaying fire perimeter location data in the Mission Planner map user interface. This capability allows a UAS pilot to see the real time fire shape on the map while planning a UAS' flying path in real time. 2.4. Developed several path planning algorithms to guide multiple UASto collect fire information more efficiently, including: 1) Designed a path planning algorithm based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), for a simulated wildfire in which multiple UAS can track multiple fire spots autonomously to maximize the sensing coverage; 2) Designed a path planning algorithm for a group of UASto track multiple spreading wildfire zones. Due to limited observable information, the fire evolution is hard to model. A regression neural network is online trained with real-time UAS observation data and applied for fire front prediction. A Q-learning-based path planning algorithm was designed to track the fire fronts effectively and collect the most useful information, which is in turn utilized to better retrain the fire front prediction model. Various practical factors are taken into account by cost function designs such as moving target tracking, field of view of UAS, spreading speed of fire zones, collision/obstacle avoidance, and maximum information collection. 3. Evaluation 3.1 Flight test of KHawk fixed-wing UAS, Hexcopter,and CarbonQuad for system test, wind estimation, and fire sensing. 3.2 Multiple flight sessions have been performed over 11 prescribed fire burns in Kansas for the test of the developed fire and wind sensing system. 3.3 Collected prescribed grass fire data using low-cost thermal camera,NIR camera and wind sensing payload. The collected data is used for validation of the proposed fire and wind sensing algorithms.\n\nPublications\n\nType: Conference Papers and Presentations Status: Published Year Published: 2023 Citation: X.

Collection of a high quality UAS fire data set with another reference in fire front location measurement. Develop a new method for real time fire front sensing and visualization based on low-cost thermal UAS imagery. Develop new methods and system to support autonomous fire boundary tracking using Quadcopter UAS. Develop a method to construct the dynamically-changing fire perimeter in real time based on noisy fire location data extracted from UAS monitoring. Develop fully automated fire monitoring using a single UAS. The UAS should be able to collect data, pass data to a ground station for processing or carry out on-board processing, and plan its flying path in a fully automated way. Develop data assimilation method that works with UAS-detected fire location data. Develop a prototype web-based prescribed fire ignition and fire spread simulation system allowing users to define prescribed ignition plans and simulate prescribed burning events. We have already started some initial work on this task. Develop an AI and vision-based tracking algorithm to support autonomous path planning for fire front tracking using a single UAS and/or multiple UASs.\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? 1. Fire sensing, wind estimation, and data assimilation to enable data driven wildfire simulation. Developed a new method for recapturing the grass fire evolution using time labelled orthomosaics collected by a smallfixed-wing UAS at low altitudes. Developed a new method for UAS thermal imagery based grass fire metrics measurement including fire front location andfire rate of spread. Developed a new and low-cost method for UAS NIR imagery based grass fire metrics measurement including fire frontlocation and fire rate of spread. Started to develop the capability of real-time fire monitoring using low-cost thermal data from KHawk Quadcopter UAS. Started to develop a new UAS model based algorithm for estimation of vertical wind velocity during fire smoke encounters. Developed the capability of prescribed fire ignition modeling for symmetrically modeling different ignition techniques ofprescribed fires, and applied it to simulating a real prescribed fire event. Started to develop a data assimilation method for assimilating real-time and noisy fire location data extracted from UASmonitoring into the fire spread simulation. 2. UAS path planning Developed and analyzed a real-time on-board path planning algorithm for UAS-based wildfire monitoring with unevenimportance. With this path planning algorithm, the UAS more frequently visits the regions that have more active spreadingbehaviors. Started to add the capability of displaying real time fire perimeter location data in the Mission Planner map user interface.This capability allows a UAS pilot to see the real time fire shape on the map while planning a UAS' flying path in real time. Designed a path planning algorithm for a group of UASs to track multiple spreading wildfire zones. Due to limitedobservableinformation, the fire evolution is hard to model. A regression neural network is online trained with real-time UASobservation data and applied for fire front prediction. To track fire fronts effectively, a UAS path planning algorithm isproposed by Q-learning. Various practical factors are taken into account by cost function designs such as moving target tracking, field of view of UASs, spreading speed of fire zones, collision/obstacle avoidance, and maximum information collection. 3. Evaluation Flight test of KHawk fixed-wing UAS and Quadcopter for system test and real-time fire sensing. Worked on the data collected from the 2019 prescribed fire data for validation of the proposed methods on grass fire metrics measurement and fire evolution reconstruction.\n\nPublications\n\nType: Journal Articles Status: Published Year Published: 2021 Citation: P.

Enable two-way communication and data transfer between flying UASs and the base station (a laptop) so that UASs can be controlled through a path planning algorithm instead of being controlled manually. More comprehensive simulation study of a selected prescribed fire using data collected from UAS. This would prepare the simulation model for data assimilation using UAS data. Develop data assimilation method that works with UAS-detected fire location data. Develop a robust path planning algorithm to support autonomous path planning for fire front tracking using a single UAS and/or multiple UASs. Organize the outreach workshop in Year 2 of the project to foster collaborations between research and UAS application in wildfire management.\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? The deadly and catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and the recent Australia wildfire signify the urgent need of advanced technologies and tools for operational wildfire spread prediction and situation awareness for firefighters and people in and near wildfire areas. Accurate prediction of wildfire spread for active burning wildfires is critical for effective and safe wildfire management. However, the lack of real time wildfire and wind data, both of which change in space and time, makes it difficult to achieve operational wildfire spread prediction. This project will develop innovative research that can transform wildfire management by enabling operational wildfire spread prediction and situation awareness for firefighters using a team of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). The interdisciplinary nature and prior experiences of the research team provide great potential for producing fruitful outcomes that will benefit this important societal issue of wildfire management. The team's collaboration with KBS on field tests over prescribed fires will enable validation and transfer of the resulting knowledge to real wildfire management.The results of this research will also have great impact on other civilian and defense emergency response applications where humans and UASs increasingly work together.Under the four major goals of this project, the following has been accomplished in this report period. 1. Fire sensing, wind estimation, and data assimilation to enable data driven wildfire simulation. 1.1 Developed initial UAS based fire line sensing system, which is guided by a human operator. Multiple fire RGB/NIR maps have been generated at preset time intervals after each flight test. 1.2 Developed a 9-state-Extended Kalman Filter which uses UAS GPS/inertial/pressure measurements for mean wind estimation at the flame height. 1.3 Carried out simulations for the prescribed fire of Welda, Kansas in October 2019 using data collected from UASs and obtained preliminary results. 1.4 Published a journal paper that summarized the Particle Filter-based Data Assimilation method for discrete event systems. The data assimilation method will be used in this project to assimilate UAS data into the wildfire spread simulation model. 2. UAS path planning 2.1. Developed a multi-UAS path planning algorithm for fire front monitoring. The new algorithm takes into consideration the uneven spreading rates of different segments of a fire perimeter when dividing the fire monitoring task. 2.2. The proposed path planning algorithm, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has been tested for some simulation scenarios in which multiple UAVs can track multiple moving targets. 3. Human-UAS collaboration 3.1. Directed an undergraduate student to develop a proof-of-concept mobile App demonstrating a human-UAS interaction interface. 4. Evaluation 4.1 Two flight sessions have been performed over two prescribed fire burning in Kansas for the test of the developed fire and wind sensing system. Fire maps and mean wind can be estimated offline.\n\nPublications\n\nType: Journal Articles Status: Awaiting Publication Year Published: 2020 Citation: Jia, B., and Xin, M., Data-Driven Enhanced Nonlinear Gaussian Filter, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, Accepted in 2019 and in Press, 2020."
