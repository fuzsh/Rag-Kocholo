The major difference between Hayek and Marx is 'epistemic' or rather in the assumptions they make about the possible progress of human knowledge … Few others have … engaged in such a detailed and enlightening comparison.\" — Karen Vaughn, author of Austrian Economics in America\n\n\"This is a shockingly original piece of work, closely and cleverly argued, skillfully organized, and scholarly in the extreme … It is a very tolerant work, open to and looking for the strengths in both traditions.\" — Bertell Ollman, author of Dialectical Investigations\n\n\"Sciabarra's work is interesting and challenging and ultimately an important source for thinking about the nature of political radicalism.\" — Radical Philosophy Review of Books\n\n\"This intriguing book crosses a gulf between two camps in social philosophy that rarely address one another … Sciabarra should be praised for forcing us to give up our comfortable caricatures of Marx and Hayek as figures in absolute 'dualistic' opposition.\" — Canadian Philosophical Reviews\n\n\"…with Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical, as well as Marx, Hayek, and Utopia now under his belt, Sciabarra has emerged as one of the most provocative, and enjoyable, writers on the history of ideas of the twentieth century.\" — Reason Papers\n\n\"Sciabarra's book … makes a valuable contribution by presenting [Hayek's] ideas in an anti-utopian context.\" — Choice"
