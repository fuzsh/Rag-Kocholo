        "text": "Writings\n\nBranden, Nathaniel (1930-2014), The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism, 15 Aug 2008\n\nBiographical essay\n\nNathaniel Branden (born Nathan Blumenthal) is known to many as \"the father of the self-esteem movement.\" Branden is the author of 20 books that explore the philosophical, psychological, and cultural foundations of individualism and the free society. Having developed a close personal relationship with novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand ... in 1958 [he] started Nathaniel Branden Lectures ... In his clinical practice, Branden stresses a variety of techniques â[t]o honor the selfâto honor mind, judgment, values, and convictionsâ as âthe ultimate act of courageâ and the ultimate prerequisite for human freedom.\n\nDialectics and Liberty, The Freeman, Sep 2005\n\nWritten ten years after publication of the first two of Sciabarra's \"Dialectic and Liberty\" trilogy, discusses Hayek's and Rand's dialectical analysis approaches and suggests that such context-keeping analysis is important in radical libertarian theory\n\nTen years ago the first two books of what has become known as my \"Dialectics and Liberty\" trilogy were published. Those books ... together with the culminating work ... constitute a defense of dialectical method in the service of a libertarian social theory ...\n\nWhat is required is a more fully developed critique of the system that generates such social problemsâand a corresponding vision for social change ... A genuinely radical project beckons, one that integrates the explanatory power of libertarian social theory and the context-keeping orientation of dialectical method.\n\nHerbert Spencer - Hero of the Day, The Daily Objectivist, 2000\n\nBiographical profile published by The Daily Objectivist; argues that Spencer was a pioneer of \"dialectical\" (context-keeping) libertarianism; based on article in Aug 1999 Liberty\n\nHerbert Spencer, Libertarian Dialectician? Yes, by God! For years, Marxists derided liberals as thoroughly \"undialectical\" ... because their allegedly \"atomistic\" approach reduced social analysis to an abstract mental gymnastic on the life and times of Robinson Crusoe ... In his conception of the social world, \"whatever produces a diseased state in one part of the community must inevitably inflict injury upon all other parts.\" It is a \"salutary truth\" of the ideal community \"that no one can be perfectly free till all are free; no one can be perfectly moral till all are moral; no one can be perfectly happy till all are happy.\"\n\nHow I Became a Libertarian, 19 Dec 2002\n\nAutobiographical essay describing Sciabarra's influences on his road towards libertarianism, primarily Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, New York, born to a Greek and Sicilian family, I had some conservative predilections as a young high school student. One of my earliest high school teachers had a big influence on me; his name was Ira Zornberg. He was a faculty advisor of a social studies newspaper called Gadfly that I edited ... I'm only sorry that Murray didn't live to see my published work on Rand, which greatly interested him, or my Total Freedom, which devotes half of its contents to a discussion of his important legacy. And so: that's not only how I became a libertarian... but also how I've become a libertarian scholar.\n\nRand, Ayn (1905-1982), The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism, 15 Aug 2008\n\nBiographical and bibliographical essay, also examining Rand's relationships with several leading thinkers\n\nAyn Rand, a controversial novelist and philosopher, was born in Russia, but emigrated to the United States when she was 21. \"For the record,\" she declared in her monthly periodical, The Objectivist, \"I disapprove of, disagree with, and have no connection with, the latest aberration of some conservatives, the so-âcalled 'hippies of the right.'\" ... Although Rand died in 1982, her legacy lives on in many segments of the libertarian intellectual movement. That her legacy has finally sparked the interest of scholars worldwide is proof of its enduring quality.\n\nInterviews\n\nInterview with Chris Matthew Sciabarra, by Chris Matthew Sciabarra, Peter Jaworski, 22 Apr 2002\n\nTopics discussed include: Ayn Rand as a dialectical thinker, dialectics (context-keeping), Murray Rothbard, Russia, Mauritania, Rand's feminism, the future of Objectivism and Sciabarra's 2001 cyberseminar \"Dialectics and Liberty\"\n\nIs there a resurgence of sorts in Randian studies? If there is, and I wager this is true, then the most prominent of the neo-Randian scholars, Dr. Christopher Sciabarra, should take a tremendous amount of credit for it. Dr. Sciabarra, a visiting scholar at New York University, took an interest in Ayn Rand (and libertarianism by extension) early on in his academic career. ... In this, Chris Sciabarra explains his positions on Randâs dialectical side, her views on feminism, the importance of context-keeping, & his relationship with the 'official' Objectivists headed by Leonard Peikoff.\n\nInterview with Nathaniel Branden, by Nathaniel Branden, Karen Reedstrom, Full Context, Sep 1996\n\nIn two parts; topics range from David Kelley, objectivism, Ayn Rand, his memoir Judgment Day, Barbara Branden, Leonard Peikoff, homosexuality, self-esteem and more\n\nQ: You have expressed admiration for Dr. Sciabarra's book, Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical. What do you see as the chief importance of this book?\n\nBranden: He has brought Ayn Rand into the history of philosophy. He has attempted to place her in a historical context. Whether or not he's right in all his hypotheses is not the most important point. So far, his is the book most likely to gain the interest of the academic community, and that interest is essential if one is thinking long-range about the spread of Objectivism. You've got to get the teaching of Objectivism into the universities."
