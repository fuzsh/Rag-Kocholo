I invite those interested to read DOL. The invitation is not limited to practitioners. The book covers a variety of subjects. There is something to interest virtually anyone.\n\n— The Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy\n\n\"This stimulating collection maps out exciting new directions in the philosophy of liberty. The essays are authored by some of the best minds in scholarly libertarian thought today. Whether you are a libertarian or not, you will find many important -- and challenging -- ideas developed here. An important and lively book.\"\n\n— Mario Rizzo, New York University\n\nThe Dialectics of Liberty is a remarkably wide-ranging study of libertarian ideas, conducted by writers of great authority but of different views and approaches. Mature yet lively, it is full of surprises. If you want to know the state of libertarian thought right now, you will need to read this book.\n\n— Stephen Cox, University of California, San Diego\n\nThis book of original essays by thinkers from a very wide array of disciplines opens the fascinating possibility of recasting the libertarian and classical liberal points of view in terms of 'dialectical libertarianism.' This way of looking at the matter promises to lay to rest once and for all the charge that these points of view are atomistic and ahistorical. I hope it inspires further research along these lines.\n\n— Lester H. Hunt, University of Wisconsin-Madison"
