        "text": "The principal criticism Roderick T. Long (2001) makes of Chris Matthew Sciabarra’s dialectical thesis is a complex one. He says that Sciabarra fails to clearly draw certain important distinctions (metaphysical vs. epistemic categories, logical vs. causal relations, and abstraction vs. idealization) and, as a result, fails to “extricate himself from internalism.” As consequences of the latter, Sciabarra overstates his cases (a) against Rothbard’s version of libertarianism, (b) for the closeness between Hayekian-Randian dialectics and Hegelian-Marxian dialectics, and (c) for the overall applicability and usefulness of dialectics (406).\n\nThis brief essay will not address all of these points, but will instead focus on what seems to be the linchpin of Long’s case: the allegation that Sciabarra fails to sufficiently distance himself from internalism. The roots of this supposed failure (not drawing certain distinctions clearly enough) and the further results of this failure (misjudging Rothbard, Hegel-Marx, and the scope of dialectics) are thus outside the scope of these remarks. The aim here is merely to show that Sciabarra has maintained a consistent position regarding internalism from the very outset, and that Long has failed to read Sciabarra carefully enough to detect that consistency.\n\nVindicating Sciabarra’s Dialectics\n\nTo start at the present and work backward: in Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism (henceforth abbreviated as TF), Sciabarra (2000) defines dialectics as “an orientation toward contextual analysis of the systemic and dynamic relations of components within a totality” (173; emphasis added). Compare this with Long’s claim that dialectics is one-sided because it is integrative and synthetic, lacking the balance provided by analytic philosophy with its differentiative (distinction-drawing) and analytic nature (426–27). In other words, Long says, dialectics isn’t truly dialectical—nor can it be! Because of its one-sided integrative, synthetic emphasis, it is not a “full blown methodological orientation” (426) and can only become so by giving up its identity and forming a hybrid approach that also uses the “precise conceptual tools of analytic philosophy” (427).\n\nLong has not accurately portrayed Sciabarra’s view. The definition just cited includes analyzing how components are related within a totality. In other words, Sciabarra defines dialectics as being both synthetic (of one-sided perspectives into a fuller, less distorted perspective) and analytic (of relations among components of a totality).\n\nAlso, Sciabarra thoroughly discusses the truly one-sided perspectives in regard to synthesis and analysis and in regard to internal relations and external relations, and he identifies these as “strict organicism” (synthetic, internal relations) and “strict atomism” (analytic, external relations). Thus, it is not the Sciabarran dialecticians, but the organicists (aka Absolute Idealists) who embody what Long objects to as a one-sided focus on internal relations and synthesis. It is these latter with whom Long and the analytic community (aka Realists) must pool perspectives, in order to transcend their respective limited viewpoints and arrive at something approximating Sciabarra’s model of dialectics.\n\nIn both Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical (1995b; hereinafter RR) and TF, Sciabarra explicitly disavows an internalist view of relations. He says that whether a given relation is external or internal depends upon context, and that an exclusively internalist (or externalist) commitment rests on begging the question, cosmologically speaking (RR, 59–61, 175–76; TF, 182). Yet, Long (2001) says, Sciabarra earlier seemed to suggest that dialectics was essentially “wedded” to the doctrine of internal relations (398). In support of this claim, Long first quotes from Sciabarra’s Marx, Hayek, and Utopia (1995a, hence forth MHU): “A dialectical perspective . . . focuses not on external connections between static elements, but on dynamic internal relations. . . . Dialectical analysis views things as internally related. Dualism views things as externally related” (24).\n\nUnfortunately, Long overlooks a crucial distinction, possibly because of the ambiguity in the word “as.” It is true that dualism and atomism view things as being externally related, rather than internally related. However, it should also be noted that organicism and monism view things as being internally related, rather than externally related. Dialectics, by contrast, views things insofar as they are internally related—and it also views things insofar as they are externally related.\n\nIn the context specifically of Sciabarra’s comparison of dialectics and dualism, then, the relevant point is that dualism fails to acknowledge internal relations, while dialectics acknowledges them. In a contrast between dialectics and organicism (or monism), the appropriate relevant point would be that organicism fails to acknowledge external relations, while dialectics acknowledges them. Long, in his haste to categorize dialectics as a synthetic, integrative, internalist doctrine, misses this point entirely. Indeed, as Long notes in his reference to RR, Sciabarra sees internal relations as contextual, as an aspect of something’s nature, which also includes its being externally related to certain other things.\n\nSecond, Long quotes Sciabarra’s 1995 interview with Full Context (1995c): “[Dialectics has] an emphasis on Internal Relations. . . . [A]s a consequence of all of this, dialectics rejects formal dualism [which] stresses not integration and organic unity, but separation and opposition between spheres, and external relations between parts” (5).\n\nWhat Long misses here is the reason for the stress on internal relations: it is to correct the atomistic and dualistic tendency to view parts as being non-integrated and separate from the whole of which they are parts."
