        "text": "Author of The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand (1905â1982) is one of the most widely read philosophers of the twentieth century. Yet, despite the sale of over thirty million copies of her works, there have been few serious scholarly examinations of her thought. Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical provides a comprehensive analysis of the intellectual roots and philosophy of this controversial thinker.\n\nIt has been nearly twenty years since the original publication of Chris Sciabarraâs Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical. Those years have witnessed an explosive increase in Rand sightings across the social landscape: in books on philosophy, politics, and culture; in film and literature; and in contemporary American politics, from the rise of the Tea Party to recent presidential campaigns. During this time Sciabarra continued to work toward the reclamation of the dialectical method in the service of a radical libertarian politics, culminating in his book Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism (Penn State, 2000).\n\nIn this new edition of Ayn Rand, Chris Sciabarra adds two chapters that present in-depth analysis of the most complete transcripts to date documenting Randâs education at Petrograd State University. A new preface places the book in the context of Sciabarraâs own research and the recent expansion of interest in Randâs philosophy. Finally, this edition includes a postscript that answers a recent critic of Sciabarraâs historical work on Rand. Shoshana Milgram, Randâs biographer, has tried to cast doubt on Randâs own recollections of having studied with the famous Russian philosopher N. O. Lossky. Sciabarra shows that Milgramâs analysis fails to cast doubt on Randâs recollectionsâor on Sciabarraâs historical thesis."
