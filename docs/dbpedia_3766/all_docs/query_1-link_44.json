I am also the co-editor, with Mimi Reisel Gladstein, of Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand (Penn State Press), and have written quite a few essays that have appeared in magazines (such as The Free Radical), newspapers, encyclopedias, and scholarly journals. I'm the author of two monographs: Ayn Rand: Her Life and Thought (The Atlas Society) and Ayn Rand, Homosexuality, and Human Liberation (Leap Publishing, A SOLO Initiative). I am a founding co-editor of The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, and a regular \"blogger\" for the Liberty & Power Group Blog (my cyberspace contributions are regularly updated at my \"Not a Blog\").\n\nWhen I'm not doing all this, I'm listening to great music (which, for me, runs the gamut: from film scores to jazz to dance), watching great films, rooting for the New York Yankees, playing with my dog Blondie, and indulging in several hundred other activities that constitute My Favorite Things."
