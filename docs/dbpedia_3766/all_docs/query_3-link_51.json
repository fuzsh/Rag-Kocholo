        "text": "Volume 21, No. 1 – July 2021 (Issue #41)\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION, pp. v-viii\n\nCHRIS MATTHEW SCIABARRA\n\nThis introduction celebrates the progress of The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, the only interdisciplinary, double-blind peer-reviewed, university press–published periodical devoted to the study of Ayn Rand and her times. It notes the expansion of the journal’s readership and the creation of the new Scholarly Publishing Collective that will further expand the accessibility and visibility of the journal as it enters its third decade of publication.\n\nBEYOND “THE MONEY-MAKING PERSONALITY”: NOTES TOWARD A THEORY OF CAPITALIST ORTHOPRAXY, pp. 1-15\n\nROGER DONWAY\n\nAyn Rand’s 1963 article “The Money-Making Personality” implied both the concept of a capitalist orthopraxy and the idea that it had an opposite. Robert Bradley Jr.’s multivolume history of Enron’s rise and fall coined the term “contra-capitalism” to describe a business syndrome that forms a stereotypical opposite of capitalist orthopraxy. This essay offers a formal definition of “contra-capitalism” as a development of Rand’s insight.\n\nHEGEMONIC CHANGE AND THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUAL IN ATLAS SHRUGGED: A GRAMSCIAN STUDY, pp. 16-30\n\nSYED HAROON AHMED SHAH\n\nThis article focuses on the hegemonic shift portrayed by Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged. The book focuses on the conflict between producers and those who exploit them. The protagonist, John Galt, leads a strike of the producers, which undermines the society’s looters and puts an end to the hegemonic control of the left. Neoliberalism—used here as a synonym for contemporary libertarian thought—rescues the world from the havoc wreaked by statism. This shift is studied in the light of Antonio Gramsci’s theory of hegemony, focusing on the role of intellectuals.\n\nRAND ON THE ATONEMENT: A CRITIQUE, pp. 31-41\n\nAMOS WOLLEN\n\nIn March 1964, Ayn Rand sat down for an interview with Playboy. In it, Rand argued that Christ’s atoning sacrifice—if it happened—was morally wrong. The author contends that Rand made a bad argument. Depending on how her words are interpreted, Rand’s argument for the immorality of Christ’s atonement was based on (a) at least one false premise or (b) a “bait-and-switch” fallacy. Either way, the argument fails and should be abandoned.\n\nSELFISH VERSUS SELFISH, pp. 42-55\n\nMERLIN JETTON\n\nAyn Rand’s controversial use of “selfish” and “selfishness” has arguably done as much or more to supply “grist” to her critics and drive people away from her philosophy than to persuade people to adopt it. This article is about her meaning of “selfish” and the common, popular meaning. Succinctly, the former is a high-level abstraction, philosophical, and mainly a way of thinking, whereas the latter is a low-level abstraction, not philosophical, and mainly a way of acting. They also have different contrast terms.\n\nMENTAL INTEGRATIONS AS FUNCTIONAL WHOLES, pp. 56-64\n\nABHIJEET MELKANI\n\nIt is argued that a mental integration is formed only if the result is a functional whole. This idea is then used to clarify the definition of a concept and discuss problems in which an instance may belong to different conceptual classes depending on the context. The same idea is also applied to the rules for dealing with an entity when it is formed out of sub-entities. Specific examples of how such rules are frequently violated in literature as well as colloquially are discussed.\n\nEXISTENCE, WE, pp. 65-104\n\nSTEPHEN BOYDSTUN\n\nThe new metaphysics presented in this article is more indebted to the metaphysics of Ayn Rand than to any other. The author’s system is a transfiguration of hers at the deepest level. The differences and commonalities with Rand’s fundamentals are explicated and argued. Her fundamentals and the author’s are set in their relations to others, ancient to modern.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nRE-READING RAND THROUGH A RUSSIAN LENS, pp. 105-10\n\nMIKHAIL KIZILOV\n\nThis article reviews a new book (Khudozhestvennoe tvorchestvo Ayn Rand v russkom kontekste) by a Russian scholar, Anastasiya Grigorovskaya, which places Ayn Rand’s fiction into its Russian context. Grigorovskaya comes to the conclusion that Ayn Rand’s imagery and fiction were heavily influenced by Russian philosophy and literature. Paradoxical it may seem, but written in America in the English language, her novels and plays contain hidden references to ideas and tendencies that preoccupied the minds of many Russian thinkers and writers in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nA MULTILAYERED WORK, pp. 110-14\n\nMIMI REISEL GLADSTEIN\n\nIn this posthumously published novel, Layers, Nathaniel Branden exhibits his talent as not only a philosopher and psychotherapist, but also a writer of fiction. The plot primarily involves the story of Nicholas Holland, a published author and leading therapist, as he interacts with Andrew Berringer, to whom he has come for therapy.\n\nA JOURNEY TO FULFILLMENT, pp. 114-17\n\nSTEPHEN MARVIN\n\nThe Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand, by Peter Saint-Andre, is a guide to personal development. He begins with the theme of youthful discovery in The Fountainhead and its protagonist, Howard Roark, progressing through forty-eight “variations,” familiar to close readers of Rand’s novel: principles, virtues, and evaluations, which begin with reason and the integration of emotions. This is the intellectual and emotional journey of the author, shared, to inspire the reader.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nREPLY TO ROGER E. BISSELL: A MORE SCIENTIFIC COMPATIBILISM, pp. 118-26\n\nGEORGE LYONS\n\nThe entity causation argument for compatibilism of free will and determinism presented in this journal by Roger Bissell is critiqued, along with Hobbes’s classical compatibilism as begging the question of volition. The author offers more scientific support for compatibilism.\n\nREJOINDER TO GEORGE LYONS: ONTOLOGICAL, ETHICAL, AND METHODOLOGICAL COMPATIBILISM AND THE FREE WILL CONTROVERSY IN OBJECTIVISM, pp. 126-40\n\nROGER E. BISSELL\n\nThe author explains that his previous philosophical arguments for compatibilism (“the logical harmony of determinism and volition,” which he explicates as value-determinism-plus-conditional-free-will) provide a robust basis for ethical and legal responsibility. He defends entity causation, arguing that no coherent model of the universe, including human action, can be formulated that rejects entities as the nexus of identity and causality. Finally, he contends, ontological compatibilism (of determinism and free will) and ethical compatibilism (of determinism and personal responsibility) are both best supported by a more fundamental methodological compatibilism of philosophical and scientific approaches to seeking truth.\n\nCONTRIBUTOR BIOGRAPHIES\n\nROGER E.

Gould, Kirsti Minsaas, Aeon J. Skoble, and Edward W. Younkins — as well as a new Associate Editor: Roger E. Bissell. This issue is dedicated to the memory of Advisory Board member and JARS contributor, the late Steven Horwitz.\n\nTHE RAND TRANSCRIPT REVEALED, pp. 141-229\n\nCHRIS MATTHEW SCIABARRA AND PAVEL SOLOVYEV\n\nIn this essay, the authors analyze and interpret facsimiles of important original documents — published here for the first time — that are deeply relevant to the education of the young Ayn Rand at the University of Petrograd. This definitive reading of source material provides significant documentation of Rand’s courses, teachers, and textbooks — and what she might have learned from them. Other original source materials are revealed to advance further investigations of this key period in Rand’s life. Recent commentary on Rand’s education in Gary H. Merrill’s book, False Wisdom, is also considered.\n\nTHE LADY AND THE STAMP, pp. 230-39\n\nAMOS WOLLEN\n\nIn 1999, the U.S. Postal Service issued the Ayn Rand commemorative stamp, an out-of-place addition to their long-running Literary Arts series. This article tells the story of the stamp — how it came to be and why.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nFLOURISHING IN A RISKY WORLD, pp. 240-44\n\nWINTON BATES\n\nThe reviewer discusses how Kathleen Touchstone’s book, Freedom, Eudaemonia, and Risk, raises the big question of why a person would rationally choose to risk their life, as well as prompting readers to think deeply about other issues including the natural rights of children, the point at which human life begins, the virtue of parenting, rules of thumb for charitable giving, and the bequest motive in risking death. He considers that Touchstone makes an important contribution in explaining the role that a person’s concept of identity plays in principled risk-taking and by emphasizing that life is not riskless.\n\nTHE FIRST RUSSIAN BIOGRAPHY OF AYN RAND, pp. 244-47\n\nANASTASIYA VASILIEVNA GRIGOROVSKAYA\n\nThis article reviews the first book in Russian to reflect on Rand’s life and work in the context of her native land (Ayn Rand, by Ludmila L. Nikiforova and Mikhail B. Kizilov). It publishes some key documents from Rand’s Russian past for the first time and presents one of the most important independent and objective analyses of Rand’s legacy.\n\nHUNTING THE PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHER: PERILS AND PITFALLS, pp. 247-88\n\nRODERICK T. LONG\n\nIn False Wisdom, Gary H. Merrill develops criteria for distinguishing genuine from pseudo-philosophy, and then applies his criteria to several case studies, including Ayn Rand, all of whom he finds to be pseudo-philosophers. While offering a mostly helpful overview of better and worse ways of doing philosophy, Merrill fails to motivate adequately his way of distinguishing pseudo-philosophy from mere philosophical vices, errors, or failings. He is inconsistent in his characterization of the criteria for pseudo-philosophy and his application of those criteria, harbors a narrow conception of what counts as philosophy, and displays a lack of interpretive charity toward several thinkers.\n\nCONTRIBUTOR BIOGRAPHIES\n\nWINTON BATES\n\nWinton Bates is an Australian economist. Over the last thirty years, he has developed a strong interest in broad issues concerning human flourishing. Prior to that, his career focused on public policy relating to economic development, international trade, productivity growth, and technological progress.\n\nANASTASIYA VASILIEVNA GRIGOROVSKAYA\n\nAnastasiya Vasilievna Grigorovskaya is a Ph.D. in philology, an associate professor in the Department of Russian and Foreign Literature at Tyumen State University, and a doctoral student of Kazan Federal University (Department of Russian and Foreign Literature).
