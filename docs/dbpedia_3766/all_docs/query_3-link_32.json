(2000) Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism,\n\nUniversity Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 467pp + xii.Chris Sciabarras Total Freedom is subtitled Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism, which\n\nsuggests why it might be of interest to some working in the Austrian tradition. But the title\n\nand subtitle might obscure the fact that what awaits the reader inside is of even greater\n\ninterest to Austrians than it might first appear. There is a reason that Menger, Mises, and\n\nRothbard appear on the front cover (along with Aristotle and Ayn Rand). What Sciabarra\n\noffers inside is a dual reinterpretation of both dialectic philosophy and radical libertarianism\n\nthat weaves the two together to formulate the subject matter of the subtitle: a dialectical\n\napproach to libertarianism.1 In doing so, he relies a great deal on the Austrian scholarship of\n\nthe last 10 to 15 years to establish the dialectical underpinning of a theory of the market. The\n\nbook offers a new way to think about the applicability of Austrian theories of the market to\n\nbroader questions of social theory, and in turn challenges Austrians to be more consciously\n\naware of those connections. The result is a book that is a major contribution to both liberal\n\nsocial theory and, as a by-product, Austrian economics.The book is divided into two major sections, with the first being the reconstruction of\n\ndialectics from Aristotle through contemporary thinkers, and the second being the reconstruction of libertarian political thought, which could be seen as variations on themes of\n\nRothbard. Given that the latter half is likely of more interest to the readership of this journal,\n\nthat argument will get more space below.The first two chapters trace the development of dialectical thinking from the early Greeks\n\nup through Hegel. Sciabarra early on defines dialectics as the art of context-keeping and\n\nargues that it is the only methodological orientation that compels scholars toward a comprehensive grasp of the many factors at work in a given context (2). Part of the challenge\n\nfor him in the first half of the book is defending this view against an opponent who argues\n\nwhat sort of orientation doesnt mind context? Chapter four is..."
