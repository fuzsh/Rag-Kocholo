Duane Carter, a founder of the United States Auto Club and a former race car driver whose career included 11 starts in the Indianapolis 500, died Sunday. He was 79 and had been suffering from cancer.

His best performance as a starter at Indianapolis was in 1952, when he drove the Belanger Motors Special to a fourth-place finish. He was third in 1953 as a relief driver for Sam Hanks. He drove in the race for the last time in 1963 at the age of 50.

Mr. Carter also excelled in sprint and midget car racing and co-founded U.S.A.C. after the American Automobile Association pulled out of racing in 1955. While with U.S.A.C., Mr. Carter instituted a driver's insurance plan and benevolent fund and had the organization pay funeral bills for drivers killed in racing.

He is survived by a son, Pancho, a racing driver who was named rookie of the year at the Indianapolis 500 in 1974, and a daughter, Cheryl.
