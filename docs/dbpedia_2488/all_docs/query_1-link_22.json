        "text": "May 30, 1964 - The 48th running of the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" - The Indianapolis 500. This page begins in October 1963 and offers\n\na chronological accounting of the 1964 Indianapolis 500.\n\nIn the summer of 63 racer Dave MacDonald had agreed in principle to run Mickey Thompsons low slung \"superskates\" in the 1964 500.\n\nMickey's cars were designed around tiny 12 tires and had run in that fashion in 63 race. The deal between Mickey & Dave just needed\n\nCarroll Shelbys approval but at a time when Carroll's Cobra movement was soaring and gaining worldwide attention he wasnt keen on\n\nthe idea of losing his top driver for long periods of Indy testing. Mickey enlisted the help of Ford executives and Carroll eventually agreed.\n\nMickey and Dave signed a two-year Indy contract for 1964/1965.\n\nThen a few weeks later USAC delivered a crushing blow to Mickey Thompson and his low-slung racers mandating that all cars run a\n\nminimum 15 tire. This rules change impacted only one team, Thompsons, and effectually banned the tiny 12 tires his cars were wholly\n\nand completely designed to run on. There was now and urgent need to put Mickey's racers on the track to see the effects of the larger tires,\n\nComplicating matters though was the fact Mickey had just signed a deal with Sears to provide the team with the 12 tires for the 64 race.\n\nSears along with Armstrong engineers had already begun production of the 12s when news of the USAC ban hit the wires in Oct 63 so\n\nthere were no 15s available for testing. Sears immed stopped production on the 12s and went to work designing a larger 15 tire. Mickey\n\nanxiously awaited availibility of the first tires. Dave's first break in his Cobra schedule would be in late November just prior to running\n\nthe King Cobra at the Nassau Speed Weeks on Dec 1. Mickey got word Sears/Armstrong could have 15\" tires available for that period\n\nand arranged a five-day test session at the Brickyard beginning Nov 26. (NOTE: Article mentions one of Mickey's rollerskates finishing\n\n9th in the '63 500 but it was actually Al Miller in a rear engine car with traditional size tires.) This photo is from the garage area during the 1963 Indy 500 and shows the dramatic difference between Mickey Thompson's 12\" slicks\n\nthat USAC banned after 1963, and some of the larger traditional Indy tires. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford] Another comparison photo from 1963 practice, Mickey's 82 car. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford]\n\nPhotos below are from the November 1963 tire test session at the Speedway. Testing scheduled for five days beginning on the 26th with\n\nDave MacDonald, Masten Gregory and Duane Carter on hand. These crucial first laps with the larger 15 tires would either ease or confirm\n\nthe teams fears that the cars taller stance would have a negative effect on handling. Below MacDonald sits in the 82 car with compliant 15\"\n\nrubber while Thompson checks the scales. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford]\n\nWith the Thompson 82 fired up Dave MacDonald is pushed to the track for the moment of truth. Notice the crude air intake mod taped to the\n\nnose of the car. Mickey ran these cars with Chevrolet powerplants in '63 and while hed contracted with Ford to run the new (and heavier)\n\n64 DOHC engines in '64 they were not available at the time of these tests. Mick at LR tire helping push. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford] Dave MacDonald back in after just a few laps in the 82 and the teams fears are realized. The larger tires increased the car's roll center and\n\nMacDonald said the car was lifting and floating, especially in the turns. Mickey searching for a fix. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford] Duane Carter takes his turn in the 82 car and is back in with a similar report, the car is lifting. A low center of gravity was a critical design\n\nelement in Mickeys cars and now the team must search for an on-track solution. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford] Day two of November testing was much colder. MacDonald (in his Shelby Anmerican Cobra helmet) prepares to head out in the 82 while\n\nDuane Carter sits behind him in the 83 car. Also on hand for these critical tests were Ford execs and Sears tire engineers. [Friedman/THF] Duane Carter waiting for Dave MacDonald to return before setting out in Thompson's 83 car. [Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford] Bottom line is the November tests were nothing short of disaster and Mickey cancelled the five day session after day two and headed home\n\nto Long Beach California to search for a solution. Below is a November 63 blurb from Motor Trend writer George Moore's Indy Diary. Some backgrtound on the change to new 15\" rubber With the November tests cut short Dave had an unexpected break before his scheduled arrival in the Bahamas on 12/1 to run the King Cobra\n\nfor Shelby. He figured he'd fly home to California and spend the rest of Thanksgiving with his family. Ford had different plans and rerouted\n\nhim to Daytona to join Fred Lorenzen and the Holman Moody team running tire tests on the new 64 Ford Galaxy. He left Indy on the\n\n28th aboard an Eastern Airlines flight for Miami and then puddle hopped to Daytona. Dave (seated on wall by driver's door w/Shelby shirt underneath his sweater) met up with Fred Lorenzen (behind car) and the Holman Moody\n\nteam at Daytona Speedway and ran tire tests that evening and the next morning. On Nov 29th Dave left Daytona for Miami and the Bahamas. Meanwhile Mickey Thompson had trailered both cars back to his Long Beach California speed shop and began chassis and suspension mod-\n\nifications in an effort to resolve handling issues posed by the larger tires. Photo courtesy Mickey & Danny Thompson Dec 6, 1963 - Mickey Thompson describes the disappointing November test session to Los Angeles Times writer Bob Thomas. \"The cars\n\njust wouldn't handle, there was too much body roll due to the higher center of gravity\". Mickey also says the cars are currently in a wind\n\ntunnel. (Wind tunnel testing was certainly a crude art in '63?) Mickey Thompson was not only a hard charger and brilliant innovator, but a charismatic salesman as well. Just a sophomore at Indy but\n\nnonetheless able to secure three of Ford's powerful new double overhead cam engines - a hot commodity in the Ford camp. This from\n\na man who ran Chevrolet engines in the 1963 Indy 500. Courtesy Los Angeles Times Sherry MacDonald's notes from March 1964. Dave MacDonald flies back to the Brickyard for additional testing on the Thompson racers.\n\nIt will be a three day test session. Dave and the Thompson team are on the track early on March 17th, Sears tire people were back too for a first hand look at hopeful progress\n\non Mickey's racers. The car were fitted with the new experimental aero modifications; which included side skirts and a rear wing but USAC\n\nofficials denied the use of those mods (Wings & sides skirts are commonplace today). Drivers present for these tests were Graham Hill,\n\nMasten Gregory and Dave MacDonald. Only one new '64 DOHC Ford engine was made available for these tests and it went in the 82 car.\n\nDave's 83 still ran with a Chevy powerplant. After only a couple laps in the 83 Hill brought it in and parked it, calling it \"diabolical\". He\n\nleft Indy for Europe and did not return\n\nSears tire engineers performing tests after Masten Gregory's run. Gregory and MacDonald agreed with Graham Hill that handling issues\n\nremained but both drivers felt there was an improvement and at this point decided to stay committed to the effort.\n\nSherry's notes show Dave & Masten only managing low speeds at these March tests. Dave 135 mph with the lighter Chevrolet engine and\n\n136 mph for Masten in the 82 car with a heavier Ford DOHC engine but also with newly installed lighter titanium suspension pieces. Tests\n\nwere not encouraging but Mickey promised significant changes once he had the cars back at his Long Beach California speed shop. Changes indeed! Mickey assembles the press on April 21 to show off his newly redesigned Ford Sears Allstate Special. He'd completely\n\nredesigned the body to include a new full fendered aerodynamic shell designed to counteract lifting and floating caused by the larger 15\"\n\ntires. Remarkably Mickey and his team accomplised this in a mere 30 days! [Bruce R Craig] Dave MacDonald and Mickey Thompson. Photo Dave Friedman Driver Dave MacDonald (C) and car owner Mickey Thompson (R) with the newly designed Thompson #83 car. On April 22, 1964 the LA Times gives readers a first glimpse at Mickey Thompson's new full fendered aero design Indy car. Four days later the El Monte Herald runs a photo and the southland is buzzing about Thompson's futuristic Indy car May 1, 1964. The Brickyard officially opens for practice.\n\nAll eyes on Mickey Thompson's exotic full-fendered superskate as the team begins practice at the brickyard. Bright and early on May 1, the\n\nThompson #83 car (MacDonald's car) and Chuck Rodee's #87 are pushed out for some track time. In addition to the aero skins, there were\n\nmany other modifications made to the cars since the March tests, including major chassis & suspension adjustments all in an effort to\n\nresolve instability issues. Mickey's rear wing attachments were still ruled out by USAC officials. Photo courtesy IMS.\n\nMickey Thompson's new design was a dramatic departure from the traditional open wheel Indy racer. Thompson was a brilliant innovator\n\nand his aero kits were far ahead of their time but still unproven on these cars, and at the Brickyard. To date only wind tunnel testing had\n\nbeen performed but now the team would find out whether or not the aero skins would counteract the lifting and floating caused by the 15\"\n\ntires. Dave MacDonald's #83 racer pushed to the pit area and readied for initial testing. [The Henry Ford]\n\nDave MacDonald is pushed out in the #83 for its initial run. On return Dave would tell Mickey anything above 145 mph and the front end\n\nlifts. Photo courtesy of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nOut next was Masten Gregory in Duane Carter's #82 car. [First Turn Productions] Gregory returns from his practice run in the 82 and tells Mickey the car is not only not sticking in the corners but lifting in the straights too,\n\nto the point where the steering was so light he didn't have control of the car. Mickey braced for a long month. #97 is Parnelli Jones in\n\nJC Agajanian's rear engined car. On Dec 10 Jones made the decision to stick with the front engined #98. Photo The Henry Ford. Throughout the day on May 1 the Thompson team made adjustments to the cars of Masten Gregory and Dave MacDonald and here the\n\nteam changes the setup on MacDonald's #83 car before sending him out again. The cars were far from where they hoped they'd be at\n\nthis point and the entire team realized it was going to be a trying month. Not many happy faces in this Dave Friedman photo. Crowd favorite Eddie Sachs takes his American Red Ball Express Ford out for practice laps on May 2nd. Dave MacDonald in the Thompson\n\n83 in the background will run practice laps too in preparation the first stage of his rookie tests later in the day. Late in the afternoon on May 2nd it was time for Dave MacDonald to perform his rookie test. The cars remained a work in progress and\n\nfortunately the rookie test was not at full speed. The test required drivers to run 10 consecutive laps around the track at a moderate, con-\n\nsistent speed. A drivers speed isnt supposed to vary by more than half a mile an hour and is increased in increments of 5 mph: 120 mph,\n\n125 mph, 130 mph and 135 mph. Many drivers have been sent home for more seasoning after failing to impress officials during their test.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nAfter successfully completing his two day rookie testing Dave MacDonald removes his rookie stripe as Mickey Thompson and track safety\n\ndirector Paul Johnson look on. Johnson and veteran USAC Director Jim Thompson were overseeing the testing process and both said they\n\nwere impressed with Dave. He laid em in there very consistently, said Thompson, Hes a very good looking boy. Photo IMS.\n\n[Dave Friedman/THF].\n\nJimmy Clark (L) and Dan Gurney congratulate Dave MacDonald on being the first rookie eligible for the '64 Indy 500.

The motorcycle company had\n\njust begun making cars in 1963 and contemplated a move into Indy car racing. Mr Honda was at Indy in 1964 gathering information.\n\nRookie test aside, the crew knew that running at 130 mph is far different from side by side racing at 180 so they continued to look for a\n\nsetup that would provide speed as well as control. The Thompson crew would work on MacDonald's car while he flew back to California\n\nto run a race for Carroll Shelby. Dave Friedman photo from the The Henry Ford Collection\n\nDave was becoming a Ford \"Works\" driver and having signed a 20-race NASCAR contract with factory member Bill Stroppe was scheduled\n\nto run the Stroppe #17 Merc in the Yankee 400 at IRP on May 3rd. However having already skipped the Pensacola USRRC race in favor\n\nof the Atlanta 500 NASCAR race Dave lost his lead in the USRRC Drivers standings to Pensacola winner Jim Hall. Carroll Shelby pulled\n\nrank to get Dave rerouted to Laguna Seca and run the King Cobra against Hall. Rodger Ward filled in for Dave and ran the Stroppe 17 to\n\na 7th place finish with Daves yellow rookie bumper and all! Dave at the track with JC Agajanian & Parnelli Jones on May 2 prior to leaving for the US Road Racing Championships at Laguna Seca.\n\nBy now everyone in Dave's universe, friends, fellow racer had urged him to back out of the ride, the car was not safe. Dave was staying\n\nloyal to Mickey but also concerned that if he pulled out Mickey would cancel his contract and he'd never be offered another. Agajanian\n\ntold Dave not to worry, he'd give him a ride in the 1965 500. (Carroll Shelby also offered to build a Lotus for the '65 race and crew it\n\nwith Shelby guys so Dave did have options should he back out. But he was a loyal man So on May 2nd Dave left Indy for California to run King Cobra against Jim Hall's Chaparrals. Courtesy Indianapolis Times 5/3/64 Dave ran a strong race at Laguna Seca but came up a bit short, finishing 2nd sandwiched between the Chaparrals of Jim Hall & Roger Penske.\n\nHall would extend his lead over MacDonald in the 1964 United States Road Racing Championship for Drivers Dave flew back to the Brickyard immediately after the Laguna Seca race and resumed testing the Thompson #83 car on May 4th.\n\nMasten Gregory had his #84 car out as well. Friends Dan Gurney and Jim Clark sitting on the wall by Dave's car.

(Dave Friedman)\n\nAnother late afternoon run for Dave MacDonald in the 83. Colin Chapman (far left) over for a look see. [Bruce R Craig]\n\nAdding further controversy to Mickey's cars was Colin Chapman's discovery of a radical third-wheel steering arm connected to the right\n\nrear wheel of Mickey's racers. This went completely unnoticed by track officials during car inspections. When this news hit the wires any-\n\none who wasn't already talking about the Thompson superskates, was now. Mickey was a brilliant innovator, and while many of his con-\n\ncepts were revolutionary they didn't always receive proper development time. This was more of an experimental solution Mickey concocted\n\nto help resolve the handing issues. By all accounts it was disconnected by race time.\n\nStill searching for a reliable setup Mickey brought in several different nose cone configurations from his Long Beach California speed shop\n\nDave MacDonald's #83 car gets fitted with a new front aero shell and is pushed from the garage to the painter to be numbered. A new rule\n\nrequired all cars to be properly numbered before being put on the track. Mickey continued to believe USAC was trying to make his life\n\nmore difficult and says the impromptu ruling was aimed directly at him. Dave Friedman photo from the The Henry Ford Collection Sign Mickey Thompson hung in his Indy garage. Mickey was already unhappy with USAC for banning his tiny 12\" tires, and later for\n\ndisallowing the use of his rear wing and aero side skirts. He felt the Indy establishment was wholly against him and he was not shy about\n\nexpressing his feelings, often openly blasting USAC officials for costing him $250K in development costs. Photo The Henry Ford\n\nMay 6 blurb from Motor Trend writer George Moore's \"Indy Diary\" talks about the Thompson crew out running yarn tuft tests with\n\nMacDonald's #83 car. The crew stationed cameras at several points throughout the track to monitor and film the movement of the tufts.\n\nMickey cut air vents into the tops of the front shells and was experimenting with various configurations in an effort to improve handling.\n\nMay 5 photo of Dave MacDonald in the 83 running air tuft tests with a new aero front shell; a freshly painted #83 to satisfy new Indy\n\nregulations requiring all cars practice with race numbers.

(Mickey Thompson far left and Dave MacDonald on pit wall to the right).

Photo First Turn Productions Sherry's notes told to her by Dave on May 6 Through at least May 7, Mickey had Dave do additional testing with the 82 car trying to sort the handling issues. They could only run a top\n\nspeed of 120 mph though as anything beyond that and the car was gone. After hitting just 120MPH in the 82 car Dave MacDonald brings it back in and explains the problems to Mickey.

But same situation as the previous week and Carroll Shelby pulled rank and instead rerouted Dave to the US Road\n\nRacing Championships at Kent Washington in an attempt to recapture the USRRC Drivers Championship lead from Jim Hall\n\nDave hops a 5:30PM flight to Kent WA to run Carroll Shelby's King Cobra in the May 10 United States Road Racing Championships\n\nAt Kent Dave ran King Cobra CM/3/63 to victory outdueling Jim Hall and his mighty Chaparral - Dave invited Jim to share in the victory\n\nlap. While at Kent, Dave confided to friends that Mickey's Indy car still was not right. Ken Miles, Bob Holbert, chief mechanic Wally Peat,\n\nSAI photog Dave Friedman and Corvette legend Dick Guldstrand all urged him not to go back to Indy. Carroll Shelby told Dave that others\n\nwere telling him the car needed more development with too little time. Carroll urged Dave not to run telling him he'd build him a Lotus for\n\n1965, even offering to call Mickey personally to tell him Dave wasn't coming back. (In interviews Carroll has said Dave Would not hear it,\n\nany of it, he was a loyal man and he felt obliged to Mickey for giving him the ride). Dave told Carroll the crew was working hard on the\n\ncars and was confident theyd be sorted by race day. After the race Carroll sent Wally Peat to Indy to get a firsthand account of the situation.\n\n[Dave Friedman/The Henry Ford]. Dave MacDonald's victory in USRRC Championships propelled him into a tie with Jim Hall atop the leaderboard in the Drivers standings.\n\nKent would be Dave's final race before the Indy 500 Business at hand so no time to enjoy the USRRC victory. Four hours after the race Dave is on a flight back to Indianapolis and bright and\n\nearly on the 11th he's back on the track running practice laps in the 83 - and with a new nose configuration The Thompson garage was always bustling as the crew continuously worked on all three race cars throughout the month of May.

Wally was perhaps Dave's closest friend and felt strongly he should walk away from the Thompson car, laying out\n\nhis concerns one by one. Dave was adamant that he would stay on and see it through. The two friends argued and Wally packed his bags\n\nand left Indy. It would be the last time the two would speak and an encounter Wally regrets to this day. Gregory true to his word leaves the Thompson team and takes an open spot with the Dean Van Lines team. He begins to openly criticize\n\nMickey's race cars in the press. Mickey Thompson responds to Gregory's criticism of \"trapped air\" by grabbing a file & hacksaw and cuts fender channels in MacDonald's\n\n#83 car. Dave watches from inside the racer.

(Dave Friedman) Mickey sent Dave back to the track with the fender channels and Dave promptly clocked his fastest laps of the month - a four lap average\n\nof 155 mph. Unorthodox modification aside, MacDonald reported that it did improve the car's stability.

Sherry notes this in her personal calendar. May 16th, Pole Day! Dave MacDonald learns that Mickey Thompson has changed his mind and decided to attempt a qual run in the #83\n\ncar. The crew worked throughout the night and Mickey feels it's worth a shot. He wants to take advantage of first day qualifying benefits\n\nand says if speeds aren't where they need to be he'll decline the attempt and try again on Sunday.

He rounds turn 2 and the engine on\n\nhis Sears Allstate Ford gives out. The Thompson team tows Dave back to the garage. The team had no more engines available and a Ford\n\nengineer told Mickey it would be days, maybe a week before Detroit could send another. Mickey was not allowed to use an engine from\n\nthe #82 & 84 cars as Detroit made it clear the priority was to keep those cars running and get them in the field too. MacDonald wanted the\n\ntrack time but with nothing to do he flew back to California later that evening to be with his family.

Eddie planned to qualify on day 1 but during practice that morning he crashed into\n\nthe outside wall damaging his car. He credited his crew's round the clock efforts for having it ready for day 2. (Eddie's run was ultimately\n\ngood for the middle of row 6). Dave Friedman photo from the The Henry Ford Collection\n\nStill down a racer after Gregory's departure, Mickey Thompson put word out he was looking for an available driver. Bobby Unser brought\n\nyoung 24 yr old Mario Andretti by the Thompson garage and Mickey immediately offered him the ride. Andretti agreed to come by the next\n\nday and test the car but never showed. Thompson then turned to 15-time Indy 500 competitor Eddie Johnson and invited him to the team.\n\nJohnson accepted but during his initial runs with the 82 car he was only able to get into the mid 140's.\n\nLater in the day as Johnson ran considerably faster as he continued to familiarize himself with the Thompson 82 car. Mickey was pleased.\n\nMeanwhile over in the Van Lines camp Masten Gregory was having trouble getting the Offy up to speed.

Veteran racer Chuck Arnold was out of a ride after his Chevy powered MRC Special failed to make speed. After seeing Johnson qualify\n\nThompson's #84 car he went to the Mickey's garage to check the availability of his third racer - the #82 car. Thompson told Arnold his\n\nteam hoped to have the car ready for Bump Day on Sunday and offered Arnold a shot at qualifying. Arnold took it.

Getty Images Peter Bryant knew the crew didn't have time to prepare the #82 car for a Sunday qual run and he told Thompson as much. Mickey,\n\nunder intense pressure from Ford to get all 3 cars in the race allegedly made the descion to \"bend\" the rules. Closing the garage doors he\n\nreportedly instructs the crew to quickly remove body panels from the #82 car and place them on MacDonald's already qualified #83 racer.\n\nRisky move for sure but Mickey figured track inspectors wouldn't be thoroughly checking the cars at this late stage.

Photo Lloyd Masing Typical Bump Day at the Brickyard, fast paced car hopping was in full swing. Drivers and car owners frantically searched each other out\n\nin hopes of getting an available car into the field. Bobby Johns was one such driver after crashing Smokey Yunick's unique \"sidecar\" racer\n\n(shown below). After hearing Chuck Arnold had walked away from the Thompson team Bobby headed straight to Mickey's garage to check\n\non the #82 car before the final gun on qualifying went off. But after sititng in the #82 car (actually MacDonald's #83 car) he decided \"The\n\ncar just didn't feel right\" and passed on the opportunity. Dave Friedman photo from the The Henry Ford Collection With less than an hour left in qualifying Mickey Thompson went looking for of all people, Masten Gregory, who was at the Brickyard to\n\nwatch Bump Day festivities. Mickey asked him to give one last chance at qualifying the #82 car (which was really MacDonald's #83 car).\n\nGregory agreed to try to qualify the car but said he would not drive it in the race. Mickey had no other options and agreed. Gregory was\n\nonly able to muster a 147 mph average in the car but with several other cars in line to qualify Thompson had to accept the run. It was\n\nultimately good for the 34th position, the first alternate should a car not be able to run. Photo courtesy First Turn Productions. Bump Day excitement and the joy of Eddie Johnson qualifying ended quickly for Dave MacDonald when he learned good friend Glenn\n\nFireball Roberts is hospitalized after a serious crash in NASCAR's World 600 on 5/24.
