        "text": "An icon of racing in New Zealand - and beyond - is under threat\n\nWestern Springs speedway was opened for motorcycling in 1929, with cars joining in eight years later. Apart from a three-year wartime break, it has been going ever since. All NZ’s great speedway men - on two wheels and four - raced here, and Brits, Australians and Americans as well. Names in the last group range from Duane Carter through A J Foyt and Mel Kenyon to Jeff Gordon and many more.\n\nIn 2004 an atttempt by the Auckland City Council to close the track brought a huge protest march and a 56,000-strong petition. The Council relented, and allowed the venue to continue.\n\nHowever a new Council is now making a second attempt to close the speedway. An online petition has been set up to collect signatures, on this site:\n\nhttp://www.speedwayc...ignpetition.php\n\nIf you care about motor racing heritage - anywhere in the world - please show your support\n\nWhile not wanting to be negative about Western Springs Speedway (I support the retention of speedway there and started attending when I was a boy) I think some balance on this matter is appropriate.\n\nThe Auckland City Council efforts to stop the iconic Western Springs speedway are unacceptable but on the other hand the petition looks to increase the noise level controls from 85 dBA, increase the number of meetings held each season, introduce mid week meetings including two per week during the international season and extend the last event cut off time.\n\nIt appears that the petition is not just about retention of the speedway but to increase activity at louder noise levels. While I hope the speedway can stay at Western Springs I don't know if it is tactically smart to try and combat Council actions to have it removed by advocating increased activity and noise.\n\nThe most spectacular use of the cycle track was in 1979 when Western Springs was used as the opening stage of the Motgard Rally. The cars ran two at a time for five laps. Hannu Mikkola in a Masport Escort RS1800 and Pentti Arikkala in a Chevette 2300HS were first up on a very wet track.\n\nMikkola did what was expected and hugged the inside line around the soggy track but Arikkala took the Vauxhaul up onto the banked cycle track and held it sideways all the way around to power into the lead. The crowd went wild.\n\nAirikkala doing his thing\n\nYes he did.\n\nThe most spectacular use of the cycle track was in 1979 when Western Springs was used as the opening stage of the Motgard Rally.
