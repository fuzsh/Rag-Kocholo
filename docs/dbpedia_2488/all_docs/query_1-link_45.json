        "text": "One of the fastest 100-meter runners in Texas is transferring to sprint powerhouse Duncanville. He could become part of a 4x100 relay team that could challenge the high school national record next season.\n\nJayden Finley said in a direct message on X on Tuesday that he is leaving Richland and transferring to Duncanville for his senior year. He said he will just be running track after also playing football at Richland.\n\nFinley placed third in the 100 in Class 5A at the state meet as a sophomore in 2023, running 10.41, and he also ran a wind-aided 10.20 that season. He ran a wind-aided 10.58 this past season, but a hamstring injury prevented him from competing at regionals after he placed second at the area-round meet.\n\nFinley has been at his best this summer, running a wind-aided 10.11 and a wind-legal 10.25. The 10.25 is tied for the sixth-best wind-legal time in the nation for 2024, according to MileSplit.\n\nFinley said his mother’s divorce forced them to move. UIL rules state that students aren’t allowed to transfer for athletic purposes, and a district executive committee meeting would be held if a coach or administrator from his previous school checked on his Previous Athletic Participation Form that they thought he was recruited or transferred for athletic reasons.\n\nDuncanville graduated just one runner — LSU football/track signee Caden Durham — from its 6A state runner-up 4x100 team that ran 39.47, now the fourth-best time in national history. The other runners on that team were Brayden Williams, Ayson Theus and five-star Oregon football pledge Dakorien Moore, but Moore said in May that he was considering graduating after the upcoming football season so he could start college early.\n\nWilliams ran the fastest 100 meters in Dallas-area history with a wind-legal time of 10.14 seconds at the USATF National Junior Olympics on July 28, winning a race in which Finley ran 10.31 and placed fourth. Williams’ time is the third-fastest wind-legal mark in state history behind the 10.11 run by Houston Strake Jesuit’s Matthew Boling in 2019 and the 10.13 run by Galveston Ball’s Derrick Florence in 1986.\n\nDuncanville will be looking to dethrone 4x100 state champion Humble Atascocita, which broke the national record by running 38.92 this past season. Duncanville broke the national record in the 4x200 relay as Williams, Durham, Theus and Moore won the 6A state title in 1:22.25.\n\nFind more high school sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."
