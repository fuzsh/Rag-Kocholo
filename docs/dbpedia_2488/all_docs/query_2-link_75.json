The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \"Indy Car Racing\". The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500.\n\nThe event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000.\n\nThe inaugural running was won by Ray Harroun in 1911. The race celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. Alexander Rossi is the defending champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser, and Rick Mears, each of whom have won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is Hélio Castroneves, with three. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of Team Penske, which has 16 total wins and 17 poles.\n\nList of Winners\n\nOfficial NameDateWinnerWinner's Make 1972 Race Information & Results International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1911Ray HarrounMarmon1911 Race Information International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1912Joe DawsonNational1912 Race Information International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1913Jules GouxPeugeot1913 Race Information 4th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1914René ThomasDelage1914 Race Information 5th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race31 May 1915Ralph DePalmaMercedes1915 Race Information 6th International 300-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1916Dario RestaPeugeot1916 Race Information 7th Liberty 500-Mile Sweepstakes31 May 1919Howdy WilcoxPremier1919 Race Information 8th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race31 May 1920Gaston ChevroletFrontenac1920 Race Information 9th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1921Tommy MiltonFrontenac1921 Race Information 10th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1922Jimmy MurphyDuesenberg-Miller1922 Race Information 11th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1923Tommy MiltonMiller1923 Race Information 12th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race30 May 1924Lora L.

At $50,000, the race purse is nearly double that of 1911.\n\nOut of 29 original entries, 24 qualify for the race by sustaining a speed faster than a minimum of 75 mph (120.7 km/h) for a full lap, an increase from the quarter-mile qualifying distance of the inaugural year. David L. Bruce-Brown runs fastest at 88.45 mph (142.35 km/h), but starting positions are again determined by entry date. Lining up five cars to the first four rows and four to a fifth, a change from the previous year's starting method is movement of the pace car, a Stutz, from the inside of the first row to out in front of the field.\n\nUpon wave of the then-red starting flag, Teddy Tetzlaff takes the lead in a Fiat from the third starting position in the center of the first row, and leads for the first two laps before being overtaken by the grey # 4 Mercedes of Italian-born Ralph DePalma.\n\nDePalma's domination of most of the event is total, as he builds an eventual five-and-a-half lap, eleven minute advantage over second, and leads uncontested for the next 194 laps...before suffering one of the most confounding mechanical failures in motorsport history at the beginning of lap 197, as his Mercedes begins misfiring, and slowing on the mainstretch at the conclusion of the lap. Nursed on the 198th lap by DePalma at reduced speed, the car finally loses all power at the end of the backstretch on lap 199, as a broken connecting rod rips a hole in the crankcase.\n\nWith the car's momentum carrying it around to the fourth turn, DePalma and riding mechanic Rupert Jeffkins then enter themselves into motor racing lore, as well as inspire the cheers of the more than 80,000 in attendance, as they climb from the vehicle and begin pushing it down the five-eighths of a mile mainstretch toward the start-finish line.\n\nIndianapolis driver Joe Dawson, running in the second position for most of the race in his blue and white National Motor Vehicle Company entry, finally passes DePalma midway down the mainstretch to assume the lead for the concluding two laps, the fewest led to date in either a single race or an entire career by a race winner, following DePalma's 196 laps in the lead being the most ever in a race by a non-winner. Finishing more than ten minutes ahead of newly-second place Tetzlaff, Dawson completes another two laps for good measure upon fear of a scoring miscue. Sometime thereafter, DePalma and Jeffkins finally bring their car across the line, but in twofold futile endeavour: Speedway rules, requiring that all entries move under their own power, mark DePalma's final number of circuits at 198, and the push across the line, even if to be counted, bringing them only to the beginning of the final lap.\n\nDawson's run in the American-manufactured, four-cylinder National, with a winning time of 6:21:06 and averaging 78.719 mph (126.686 km/h), is twenty-one minutes two seconds faster than the previous 1911 record; he garners $20,000 and additional contingency awards.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the field, only the top ten finishers earn prize money, rules stipulating all entries complete the 500 miles to collect. Ralph Mulford, involved in the controversial finish the year before, and being forced to stop numerous times due to clutch problems in his Knox, finds irritation with the requirement and proceeds to drive on, long after all others are presented the chequered flag...and even after Speedway president Carl Fisher and starter Fred Wagner leave the grounds (the latter after getting into an argument over whether to flag Mulford off before he had completed the distance, Wagner in favor and Fisher against).\n\nThrough numerous accounts of the run, including his reportedly changing shock absorbers for a gentler ride, as well as stopping for a dinner-on-the-go of fried chicken and ice-cream with his riding mechanic, Mulford's finish finally arrives, amid deserted grandstands and a setting sun over the mainstraightaway, 8:53:00 after the start, and with an average speed of 56.285 mph (90.582 km/h), which remains a record: the slowest finishing speed to date in 500 history.\n\nNotes\n\nRace field average engine displacement:\n\n491.46 in³ / 8.05 L Race field average qualifying speed:\n\n81.762 mph / 131.583 km/h Finishing entries average time and finishing speed:\n\n6:57:25 (-8:02 from previous year and previous record)\n\n72.457 mph / 116.609 km/h (+1.717 mph / +2.763 km/h, from previous year and previous record)\n\nReferences\n\nIndianapolis 500 Chronicle, 1999, Rick Pope\n\n2006 Indianapolis 500 Official Program\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Wikipedia.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

Frame, with mechanic Jerry Houck riding beside him, won the \"500\" at 104.144 mph, a speed that broke the seven-year-old record set by Peter DePaolo.\n\nIt was the second Speedway victory for car owner/builder Harry Hartz.

No. 2 starter Billy Arnold wrested the lead from pole-sitter Lou Moore on the second lap, but Arnold and mechanic Spider Matlock rlled over on lap 60, handing the lead to Bob Carey.\n\nFred Fame still holds the record for winning the Indianapolis 500 from the lowest starting position, have begun the race in 27th place.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Wikipedia.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

As with other Indy 500s of the 1950s, it was counted as a round of the World Drivers' Championship.\n\nThe 1956 race would be the first 500 to be governed by the United States Automobile Club as the American Automobile Association withdrew the previous August. Another change would have a more immediate effect on the current race. The track had been resurfaced with asphalt with only a small line of bricks still remaining on the main stretch. With the new surface, a new track record was expected. Pat Flaherty did not disappoint with a pole speed of 145.596mph, over 4.5mph faster than the 1954 record. 29 drivers qualified opening weekend. The second weekend saw heavy rain that completely canceled Saturday and left only a small window on Sunday for 4 drivers to fill the field. Nino Farina was one of the drivers left out when he didn’t get a chance to qualify his Bardahl-Ferrari.\n\nThe early part of the race turned into a three man duel between Russo, O’Connor, and Flaherty. Russo was the first to retire when his tyre failed and his car crashed and caught fire. At quarter distance due to yellows and the pit stops, Parsons took the lead followed by Freeland. By the 200 mile mark Flaherty took over the lead followed by Freeland, Sweikert, and Parsons but Hanks was working his way through the fields after sustaining some damage in the Russo crash, eventually taking second. Flaherty had built up such a lead that he was able to make his last pit stop and remain in front. He crossed the finish line with Hanks the only other car on the lead lap. The only real change in the top cars toward the end was both O’Connor and Jim Rathmann having to drop back with mechanical problems while both drivers were in the top 5.\n\nNotes\n\nPole position: Pat Flaherty - 4:07.26 (time over four laps)\n\nFastest Lead Lap: Paul Russo - 1:02.32\n\nShared Drive: Car# 10: Ed Elisian 123 laps and Eddie Russo 37 laps\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Wikipedia.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

The event was part of the 1958 World Drivers' Championship.\n\nIt is best known for a massive first lap incident that resulted in the death of fan-favorite driver Pat O'Connor.\n\nDick Rathmann and Ed Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row. Elisian spun in turn 3 of the first lap, and collected Rathmann, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup.\n\nAccording to AJ Foyt, O'Conner's car hit Reece's car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames. Although O'Connor was incinerated in the accident, medical officials said that he was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull.\n\nWidely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC for the accident (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by many in the racing community. Allegedly, drivers prevented firefighters from reaching Elisian's burning car the following August at Milwaukee, and Elisian died in the fire.\n\nFollowing the accident, race officials announced that they would change the starting procedure, abandoning the single-file trip down pit lane that was used in 1957 and 1958. Also, for the 1959 Indy 500, metal roll bars welded to the frame behind the driver's head were mandated, and helmets were required to pass safety certification by Speedway medical officials.\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ Indy 500 deadly accidents, 1958 2. ^ we feel the blues when we lose\n\nNotes\n\nFastest Lead Lap: Tony Bettenhausen 1:02.370\n\nA 15 car pileup accident on the opening lap involved and dealt fatal injuries to Pat O'Connor,who had appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in the week leading up to the race and had finished 8th in the previous year's Indy 500.\n\nLast Appearances: George Amick (killed in 1959 USAC race at Daytona)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Wikipedia.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

It was a rear-engined car that first raced in 1963, updated with a streamlined body for 1964. The car was designed to start with enough fuel to run the full race, housed within a rubber bladder in an enclosed tank that ran between the tires on the left side. The car also featured Sears tires. It was far ahead of its time, but was badly designed, poorly built and difficult to drive. It handled badly, a condition made worse when the body was modified to accommodate the USAC-mandated 15 inch tires. Graham Hill tested the vehicle before Indy, but refused to drive it in 1963. Masten Gregory crashed earlier in the month due to aerodynamic lift. Other drivers took the advice of Gregory, and stayed away from the Thompson cars. Jim Clark told MacDonald on Carb Day, \"Get out of that car mate, just walk away.\" The ride also offered to Mario Andretti, who turned it down due Andretti's concerns over his lack of experience and the fact that the ride was only for Indy. According to long-time motor sports journalist Chris Economaki, MacDonald never practiced with a full load of fuel due to Thompson's focus on high speeds.\n\nIn the first lap of his first Indy 500 race in 1964, MacDonald passed at least 5 other cars. As MacDonald passed Johnny Rutherford and Sachs, Rutherford noticed that MacDonald's car was very loose, even throwing grass and dirt up from the edge of the track. Rutherford later said that, watching the behavior of MacDonald's car, he thought, \"Whoa, he's either gonna win this thing or crash.\"\n\nOn the second lap, MacDonald lost control coming off the fourth turn. As the car began to slide, he came across the track and hit the inside wall, igniting the gasoline in his fuel tanks (approximately 70-100 gallons) which caused a massive fire. His car then slid back across the track, causing seven more cars to be involved. Ronnie Duman crashed, spun in flames and hit the pit lane wall, and was burned. Bobby Unser hit another car, and Johnny Rutherford's car on its left rear tire, and crashed into the outside wall. Chuck Stevenson and Norm Hall also crashed.\n\nSachs, blinded by the smoke, hit MacDonald's burning car, and died in the fire before he could be freed. According to eye-witnesses, he was burned alive. His car, including his body, was covered by a tarp before being towed away during the cleanup. A lemon that had been on a string around Sach's neck was found inside of Rutherford's car after the crash.\n\nMacDonald was pulled from the wreck and taken into the infield hospital, burned beyond recognition. His lungs were seared from flame inhalation, causing acute pulmonary oedema. He died at at 1:20 in the afternoon.\n\nThe crash was well-documented in film and still images, and shown world-wide. For the first time in its history, a red flag stopped the Indy 500. Partially in response to media pressure, USAC mandated that cars carry less fuel, a change that also led every team to switch from gasoline to methanol prior to the next year's Indy 500.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Wikipedia.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
