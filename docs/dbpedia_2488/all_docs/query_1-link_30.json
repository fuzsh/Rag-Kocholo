        "text": "Lindsey Hopkins commissioned Lugie Levosky to build this car for the 1951 AAA National Championship season. The driver would be the defending National Champion, Henry Banks. Finished too late for the 1951 Indy 500, the car made its debut at Milwaukee on June 10th. An eleventh place was the result of its maiden voyage. Banks finished inside the top 10, twelve out of the next 13 races and scored a second in the final standings for 1951.\n\nBanks drove the car in its only appearance in the Indy 500 in 1952, coming home 19th. Henry once again showed amazing consistency the rest of the season, with top-10s in nine out of 11 races. Banks retired from driving early in the 1953 season and several drivers including, Mike Nazaruk, Duane Carter, Pat O”Connor, Al Keller and Buster Warke tried the car with some much success.\n\nTowards the end of the 1956 season Little George Amick jumped in the car and scored a big win in the 100-mile championship race at Phoenix. He then won at Atlanta in 1957 and ended the season third in the season point standings.\n\nFollowing the 1957 season Hopkins sold the car and it bounced around until landing with the Stearly Motor Freight team. Jim Packard, Wayne Weiler, Len Duncan, Rex Easton, Allen Crowe, Ronnie Duman, Cotton Farmer, Jim Hurtubise and Ralph Ligouri. Packard won the 1960 Tony Bettenhausen 100 at Springfield, IL, in this car. It finished its career having scored more championship points than any other single car in history.\n\n​\n\n​ Henry Banks was born in England, but brought up in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was the son of an early European race-driver. Henry began competing in 1932, when he was 19 years old, and became successful in the midget cars.\n\nHenry Banks was the first driver to pass the newly installed qualifying \"rookie test\" at the Indianapolis 55 in 1936. He also drove as a relief driver in 1937, 1939, and 1940, with a 21st-place finish in 1938.\n\nHe won the 1941 American Racing Drivers Club (ARDC) championship in New England.\n\nAfter a break during the war, when he worked at Ford’s aero-engine division, Banks’ career took off. In 1947 he won 30 midget car races. In 1950, he was the AAA National Champion and, in the same year, came second in the National Midget points.\n\nBanks later retired from racing and became USAC Director of Competitions, and was also inducted in the National Midget Racing Hall of Fame in . He died at Indianapolis in 1994."
