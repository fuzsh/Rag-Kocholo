        "text": "The track consisted of two semicircular curves with a radius of about 320 meters joined by two straights of 875 meters each, for a total length of the circuit of 4250 meters. The maximum inclination of the corners was 80% and would have allowed the riders to reach 300 km / h .\n\nA few years later, the interpretation of the concept of speed took two directions. In Europe, it was intended as a search for technical performance, in America, as a performance of speed. This split led to the abandonment of the track and only from the end of the 90s did he return to interest in his destiny. Committees and petitions began to promote its conservation as the Elevated Tower had been and had to continue to be a protagonist of the history of world motoring .\n\nLuciano Dal Ben set up in 2002 a committee for the conservation and enhancement of the Elevated Curves which aimed to avoid the demolition of the structure by promoting its maintenance, structural arrangement and the possibility of creating a tourist route for visitors and using it for promotional and advertising purposes. Through the Committee and through a petition accepted by thousands of aficionados, the municipalities of Milan and Monza were asked to evaluate the relationship between the abatement costs and those of restructuring and to make a serious commitment to preserve the integrity of the structures."
