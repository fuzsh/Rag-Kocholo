        "text": "Nick Bonino '07 played varsity hockey at Avon Old Farms under Coach John Gardner, and we had the good fortune of witnessing the perfect definition of a \"winner\" and a champion. In his senior year, Bonino was a captain and a force on a New England Championship team. From Avon, Nick went on to play for Boston University, during which he helped lead the team to a NCAA National Championship. Nick was always a \"difference maker.\" Case in point: in Boston University's NCAA championship game vs. Miami of Ohio, Nick produced an assist and a goal in the final minute of regulation play, making the impossible possible, and leading to a dramatic \"come from behind\" victory for BU. A similar story continues with Nick's professional career in the National Hockey League. Nick competed impressively for the Vancouver Canucks and Anaheim Ducks before joining the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016. It was there that he provided the catalyst on an offensive line that drove the Penguins to the playoffs and ultimately a coveted Stanley Cup. In typical Nick Bonino fashion, he scored the winning goal against the San Jose Sharks in game one of the Stanley Cup finals. In the summer of 2016, Bonino remembered his roots, and when it was his turn to have a day with the famous Cup, he brought it to Avon Old Farms to share it with his community.\n\nInducted: May 13, 2017\n\nWhile visiting prep schools as an eighth grader, 5-foot-5 inch, 115-pound, Chris Higgins walked into Coach John Gardner’s office and was discouraged from playing varsity hockey at Avon Old Farms. Coach Gardner knew that he had a tremendously skilled athlete but feared that Chris might get injured because he had not yet filled out into the six foot, 190 pound athlete that would become one of the most dominant all-around athletes in prep school athletics over the next four years.\n\nIn his senior year, Chris was the captain, Most Valuable Player and All New England leader of Avon’s varsity soccer team. As a member of the track team, he became one of the top javelin throwers in the Founders League. It was in hockey, however, that Chris made his mark as one of the top players to ever put on the Crimson and Navy sweater. After spending his freshman season on the junior varsity, Chris made a three-year transition and became a top NHL prospects. During this same time he was Avon’s leading scorer during his sophomore, junior and senior seasons. Chris led the team to two consecutive New England Championship games, and in his final prep school contest, scored the decisive overtime goal against Deerfield to capture the Division I title.\n\nChris then matriculated toYale University in 2001, where he spent his next two seasons. While at Yale, he was named the ECAC Co-Player of the Year, an NCAA first–team All-American, and a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, the top individual award in college hockey. After his sophomore year, Chris became the first player from Yale to be selected in the first round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. He was chosen by the Montreal Canadiens, where he remained until 2009. After short stints with the New York Rangers, Calgary Flames, and the Florida Panthers, he joined the Vancouver Canucks in 2011. While there, Chris came to within one game of winning it all as the Canucks fell to the Boston Bruins in the 2011 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFour Americans in the history of the National Hockey League have won the Conn Smyth Trophy, awarded to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and two of them came to Avon OldFarms: Brian Leetch ’86 of the New York Rangers in 1994 and Jonathan Quick ’05 of the Los Angeles Kings\n\nJonathan Quick ’05 Four Americans in the history of the National Hockey League have won the Conn Smyth Trophy, awarded to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and two of them came to Avon Old Farms: Brian Leetch ’86 of the New York Rangers in 1994 and Jonathan Quick ’05 of the Los Angeles Kings in 2012. Jonathan has been a “difference maker” at every level of hockey and on every team where he is minding the net. “Quickie” led Avon Old Farms to two straight Division One New England Prep School Championships during his junior and senior seasons (2004 and 2005) as well as Avon’s two best back-to-back seasons in its history with a combined record of 52-3. Jonathan posted a remarkable nine shutouts during his senior year at Avon in 2005.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Avon Old Farms, Jonathan competed for the University of Massachusetts, Amherst where he led the Minutemen to their first NCAA Men’s Ice Hockey Championship appearance. In the first tournament game, Jonathan shut out Clarkson University, stopping all 33 shots he faced. He continues to hold many records in UMass Amherst hockey history. A two-time Olympian, Jonathan competed for the USA in 2010 in Vancouver (Silver medal) and 2014 in Sochi where he was the starting goalie.\n\nJonathan’s achievements with the Los Angeles Kings speak volumes. In 2012, he was awarded the covetedConn Smyth Trophy following the Kings first Stanley Cup victory over the New Jersey Devils. In the playoffs, he posted a 16-4 record with a 1.41 GAA, a 0.946 save percentage, and 3 shutouts. Then, in2014, Jonathan won his second career Stanley Cup when LA defeated the New York Rangers. He had two playoff shutouts, including one in Game 3 of the Finals, and a save average of 0.911. In that year, Jonathan became the all-time leader in shutouts for the LA Kings and was awarded, separately, the William M.Jennings Trophy presented to the goalkeeper for the NHL team “with the fewest goals scored against it.”It is a given that in any game that involves an outstanding goalie, players in front of that goalie play better and the team has its best chance to win. This is why, wherever Jonathan Quick has played, his teams win and championships result.\n\nJeff Hamilton enrolled at Avon as a freshman coming from Englewood, Ohio. While at Avon, Jeff earned recognition in soccer and baseball, but it was his accomplishments as a hockey player that provided the foundation for a distinguished career on the ice.\n\nAvon Coach John Gardner comments, “Jeff improved so much from his sophomore to his senior year as a hockey player. Through intense dedication, he matured into a special athlete. His development is an example of what is possible when young players are committed.” Jeff enjoyed a tremendous career at Avon on the ice, highlighted by his 52 points (in just 24 games) during his senior year.\n\nAfter Avon, Jeff enrolled at Yale University and became one of the college game’s best players. In his first year at Yale, he collected 23 points and was elected to the ECAC All-Rookie Team. During his sophomore year, he scored 47 points and was an All-Conference and All-American selection. In his last two years at Yale, Jeff scored 104 points, was a two-time Hobey Baker finalist, and again was recognized with All-Conference and All-American honors. Jeff finished his college hockey career as Yale’s all-time points leader. He was also named to ECAC Hockey’s All-Decade first-team. During his career at Yale, Hamilton netted 80 goals and added 93 assists, for 173 points in 127 games.\n\nAfter Yale, Jeff enjoyed a successful professional hockey career. He played in the NHL, the AHL, and in the professional hockey leagues of Europe.\n\nInducted: May 21st, 2011\n\nChris Hetherington is a successful leader, an amazing athlete, and an incredible competitor. He came to Avon Old Farms as an undersized 14-year-old 9th grader from North Branford, Connecticut. While at Avon, Chris distinguished himself as a scholar, a leader in the community, and as a phenomenal athlete. While Chris is a uniquely gifted athlete, it is his relentless work ethic and intense competitive spirit which has earned him athletic achievements that few people ever attain.\n\nWhile at Avon Old Farms, Chris competed in varsity football, hockey, baseball, and golf (his 9th grade spring term). Chris enjoyed many accomplishments at Avon, including being a leader on the undefeated football team his senior year (8-0), captaining the baseball team in 1991, and participating in varsity hockey for two years. Chris was recognized as the best athlete in the school his senior year, earning the prestigious George A. Murray Cup on graduation day.\n\nAfter Avon, Chris enrolled at Yale University. Chris served as a team leader at Yale, and ran the offense as quarterback of the Bulldog football team. Quarterback was a new position for Chris, but his athleticism, determination, and competitive drive resulted in Chris being one of Yale’s best ever at the position. While playing for Yale, Chris attracted close attention from NFL scouts because of his size, speed, strength, intelligence, and toughness.\n\nChris Hetherington enjoyed a remarkable career in the NFL. He was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals upon graduating from Yale, and went on the play in the NFL for 11 seasons. He played for the Indianapolis Colts in 1996 and 1997 and was recognized as their Most Valuable Special Teams Player. He went on to earn the starting fullback position for the Carolina Panthers, St. Louis Rams, Oakland Raiders, and San Francisco 49ers during his career.\n\nInducted May 8th, 2004\n\nWhile at Avon Old Farms, Bill Norcross distinguished himself as an elite, three-sport athlete. He started for the football, basketball, and baseball teams as a junior and was voted captain of each sport his senior year. In football, his rare combination of size, speed, and athleticism earned him a scholarship to play tight-end at national powerhouse, Boston College. As a senior on the basketball team, he was the team's leading scorer (averaging 15.7 points per game) and rebounder (averaging more than 11 per game), and garnered All-Tri-State league honors. In baseball, he earned Most Valuable Player honors by leading the team in pitching victories, striking out 51 batters in just 47 innings pitched, and also serving as the team's most productive hitter. In the spring of 1989, he led the team in batting average (.458), hits, and RBI. He also struck out just one time in over 50 at-bats. On graduation day in 1989, Bill was awarded the prestigious George A. Murray Cup, given to the best athlete in the school.\n\nBill's extraordinary athletic achievements at Avon set the tone for an impressive collegiate and professional career. He played football for Boston College from 1989-1994, participating in the Hall of Fame Bowl and the Carquest Bowl for the Eagles. He also played baseball at Boston College. In 1993, the Eagles won the Beanpot Championship and Bill was named to the All-Tournament Team. After college, Bill continued to play baseball, signing a professional contract with the Texas Rangers organization in the Texas-Louisiana League in 1995. He was a league all-star in 1996 and continued to play professional baseball until 1999.\n\nUpon retirement from professional baseball, Bill channeled his impressive sports knowledge and passion into coaching and scouting. In 2005, Bill was honored as the Boston Globe Massachusetts Baseball Coach of the Year after leading St. Mary's in his hometown of Lynn, MA to a 23-1 season record. He moved on to scouting in 2005 with the Pittsburgh Pirates and, in 2009, is employed by the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau.\n\nInducted: May 16th, 2009\n\nCal Ingraham is a scorer. His ability to score goals in hockey - along with his fierce determination, extraordinary skill, and intense competitive drive - has made him a winner, too. His athletic career is special and his accomplishments in the game are amazing.\n\nIn 1989, Cal led the Avon hockey team in goals scored (tied with Steve Flomenhoft) and helped the team earn a 22-3 record, a Founders League Championship, a Christmas Classic title, and Avon's first, Division I New England Hockey Championship. In his senior year at Avon, he was named Most Valuable Player of the Christmas Classic (8 goals in the tournament), shared Most Valuable Player honors for the season with fellow captain Dave Roberts, and had 2 goals and 6 assists in the New England Championship game, leading Avon to a 11-5 victory over Cushing Academy.\n\nAfter Avon, Cal's excellence continued at the University of Maine and his performance in 1993 resulted in a historic season both for him and for the Black Bears. Cal led the nation in goals scored - his 46 goals in just 45 games was tops in all of collegiate hockey. He collected 85 total points that season and his prolific performance earned him All-American honors and helped the team to a NCAA Division I National Championship. With 187 career points (compiled in just three seasons), Cal currently ranks 6th on Maine's list of all-time leading scorers.\n\nAfter his brilliant career at the University of Maine, Cal played professionally for seven seasons. He led his team in scoring all three years while playing for the Tallahassee Tiger Sharks and he earned league, all-star recognition in 1995-96 and 1997-98. From 1998-2002, he played for the Idaho Steelheads in the WCHL where he became the only player to total three, consecutive seasons with 50 or more goals. He is the Steelheads' all-time leading scorer, was a league all-star in 1998-99 and again in 2000-01, and he had his jersey retired by the team in 2002.\n\nHockey is a family obsession in the Roberts family. David grew up the son of a college coach and former NHL player, Doug Roberts. Doug was an All-American at Michigan State University, before going on to play professionally for 14 seasons. David's uncle, Gordie Roberts, played professionally for 22 years and was the first American to play 1,000 games in the NHL. While David was born into a family with an established tradition of hockey achievement, he left his own legacy of excellence everywhere he played the sport. In high school, he was captain of Avon's first, New England Championship team in 1989; in college, he was an All-American at the University of Michigan; and after college, he was a United States Olympian before playing professionally in the NHL.\n\nCompiling 62 points in just 25 games, David was the leading scorer on Avon's championship team in 1989 and he shared Most Valuable Player honors for the season with fellow captain Cal Ingraham. He was drafted by the St. Louis Blues after Avon, but accepted a scholarship to play at the University of Michigan before beginning his professional career. David's brilliance on the ice continued at the University of Michigan, as he led the team in scoring as a freshman, was named to the All-Rookie Team, and was recognized as the Rookie of the Year in the conference. His success continued over his collegiate career and he went on to lead his team in scoring for three seasons, make the All-Conference team, and twice lead his Michigan Wolverines to the Frozen Four.\n\nDavid's talent and determination on the ice resulted in an opportunity to compete in the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Later that year, David signed an NHL contract with the St. Louis Blues and played in the NHL from 1994-1998, first with St. Louis, then with Edmonton, Vancouver, and Dallas. He continued to play professionally both in the United States and Europe until he retired in 2004-05.\n\nInducted: May 16th, 2009\n\nAlthough James Patten played football and hockey while at Avon, lacrosse was his passion. He played three years on the varsity team, and was elected captain for the 1988 season. In his senior year, he was selected as First Team All-league and was named a Western New England All-Star. He was also voted to play in the East/West All-Star game in 1988, which is reserved for the top prep-school players in New England.\n\nAfter Avon, James enrolled at Hobart College and contributed significantly to their tradition of excellence in lacrosse. In fact, James was a leader in the program for four years and helped Hobart earn three National Championship titles (1989, 1990, 1991). While at Hobart, James was selected as an All-American in 1991 and 1992. In 1992, he collected more impressive honors: he was recognized as the NCAA Midfielder of the Year, Hobart College’s Athlete of the Year, and he was selected to play in the prestigious North/South All-Star game, earning the game’s Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn that same year, he was also honored with the William H. Dobbin Award at Hobart, which is reserved for the player who “through his contributions to the team best reflects the skills of Hobart Hall-of-Famer Bill Dobbin.” Put simply, James Patten achieved the highest levels of success for a college lacrosse player.\n\nJames’s accomplishments in lacrosse did not end after graduation. He was drafted by the New York Saints organization of Major League Lacrosse in 1993, but he did not sign, instead choosing to pursue a career as a college coach. That same year, he won the Patriot League Coach of the Year honors for his efforts at Colgate University. In 1994, James returned to playing; he competed for Team England in the World Games.\n\nBecause of the considerable distinction he has earned as a lacrosse player and coach, Avon is proud to recognize James Patten ’88 in the Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nBrian Leetch came to Avon Old Farms as an 11th grader in the fall of 1984. As a student at Avon Old Farms, Brian excelled in athletics and as a community leader. He was captain of the 1986 hockey team that achieved an undefeated regular season. During his senior year he collected 92 points for the hockey team, and is currently the leading scorer in Avon Old Farms history with 169 points – in just two seasons! Brian was also a remarkable baseball pitcher for Avon Old Farms. Leetch earned All-New England status in hockey and was awarded the Jennings and Murray Cups, given to the top underclassman and senior athlete, respectively. In his senior year, Brian served as Vice Warden of the Student Council, and on graduation day 1986, was a recipient of the Order of Old Farms (the highest student award for character, community service, and leadership).\n\nAfter his time at Avon Old Farms, Brian Leetch enjoyed a distinguished career in hockey at every level. He attended Boston College, and was a Hobey Baker Award nominee as a freshman. Brian next played for the USA Olympic team, and soon after, the National Hockey League. Leetch played on three United States Olympic teams (1988, 1998, 2002), and led the team to a silver medal in 2002. He served as team captain of the 1988 and 2002 teams. In his professional career, he has earned the Norris Trophy twice (1992, 1997), which honors the NHL’s best defenseman. He also was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1994, awarded to the most valuable player in the NHL playoffs, when he led the New York Rangers to a Stanley Cup championship. Leetch played in 11 NHL All-Star games, and is the second highest leading scorer in New York Rangers history with 981 points.\n\nLeetch retired from professional hockey in 2006 after 18 seasons in the NHL. His number 2 was retired by the New York Rangers on January 24, 2008, and he is known by many as not only the “greatest Ranger ever,” but also as the greatest American-born hockey player.\n\nInducted May 8th, 2004\n\nFew athletes have had as much success and have done more to enhance the athletic tradition at Avon Old Farms than Carl Valimont. He not only had professional talent, fierce determination, and natural leadership qualities, but he also was able to perform at an elite level in three sports. Carl's contributions helped to define Avon's athletic success and his influence during the 1981-1984 years in soccer, hockey, and lacrosse is truly remarkable.\n\nCarl Valimont was captain of both the varsity soccer and hockey teams in his senior year. In soccer, he led the team to one of its finest seasons ever. The team outscored its opponents 44-15 and Carl led the team in scoring with 21 points in just 15 games. He earned the team's Most Valuable Player award and achieved recognition as both an All-State and All-Western New England performer. In hockey, too, he was recognized as the Most Valuable Player (sharing the award with Peter Fish) and led the team to a 22-2-2 record. Carl also played with distinction in lacrosse, serving as a leader on a team that has earned a place in the Athletic Hall of Fame for its success in the spring of 1984. Carl was recognized as the best athlete in the school in both his junior and senior years, earning the prestigious Jennings and Murray Cups respectively.\n\nAfter his senior year at Avon, Carl was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL. He elected to enroll at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell and delay a professional hockey career. While in college, Carl served as his team's captain, was honored as a Hockey East All-Star, earned a Most Valuable Defensive Player Award, and led his team to their first ever NCAA Division I tournament appearance.\n\nAn 11-year, professional hockey career followed college for Carl where he played in both the United States and in Europe. Still a passionate athlete and competitor, Carl now channels those qualities as a successful coach in Wisconsin.\n\nInducted: May 16th, 2009\n\nJack Sebastian made an extraordinary impact at Avon Old Farms in just one year as a postgraduate student in 1983-1984. While at Avon, Jack excelled in many areas, including soccer and lacrosse. He was a standout on a very talented soccer team and earned the team's Most Valuable Defensive Player award in the fall of 1983. He also played a critical role on Avon's lacrosse team in 1984, helping the team enjoy a celebrated season. He earned the Henry E. Flanagan Award for Excellence in Lacrosse that spring.\n\nAfter Avon, Jack enrolled at the University of New Hampshire and continued to be a force in athletics. He played both soccer and lacrosse and was named captain of both teams his senior year. While his contributions to the soccer program were impressive (being named captain and starting each year he played), Jack's impact in collegiate lacrosse was particularly remarkable. He earned All-New England honors in both his junior and senior seasons and was named to the All-American team as a senior. He played in the prestigious North/South game, which, at the time, invited only the top 30 Division I collegiate lacrosse players to participate. He also helped to lead his team to their first ever NCAA tournament appearance in 1986.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Jack spent six years playing professional lacrosse in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League. He played two seasons for the New England Blazers and four seasons for the Detroit Turbos. He earned All-Pro honors for Detroit and, along with the legendary Gait brothers, helped lead the team to a championship.

He continues to serve the lacrosse community by serving on the board of the Metro Lacrosse Organization in Boston.\n\nInducted: May 16th, 2009\n\nIn the fall of 1981, Perry Bromwell entered Avon Old Farms for his senior year. It did not take long for the community to realize that we had in our midst not only a magnificent athlete, but a hard working student and, most importantly, a perfect role model and exceptional young man. Perry made an immediate impact on the Avon Old Farms basketball program after transferring from Don Bosco High School in Boston, Massachusetts. He led the Crimson and Navy in scoring and helped catapult the team to a 15-8 season record. In 1982, Perry was elected captain and named the Most Valuable Player on Avon’s basketball team.\n\nUpon graduation Perry entered Manhattan College where he quickly made a name for himself as the 1983 MAAC Conference Rookie of the Year. The following season Perry transferred to University of Pennsylvania where he led the Quakers in scoring, blocked shots, and field goals. For his efforts, he received several awards including All-American Honorable Mention and First-Team All-Ivy. Additionally, Perry was named co-MVP by his teammates. During his time at Penn, Perry led the Quakers to two Ivy League Championships and two trips to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nOver the course of his career, Perry only missed four of his 80 scheduled games. He scored in double figures in 76 contests and is only one of five players to have been a three-time recipient of the Arthur Kiefaber Most Valuable Player Award at Penn. Further, he also finished his career as a two-time Best Defensive Player Award winner.\n\nFollowing graduation from Penn in 1987, Perry was drafted by the New Jersey Nets and enjoyed a professional career playing in England, Norway and the Philippines. He has coached at the University of Nottingham in England, Ursinus College, Frostburg State, and his beloved University of Pennsylvania. He has also authored a book for student-athletes preparing for college, The Student Athletes Handbook: The Complete Guide for Success.\n\nJuan Nieves spent three years at Avon Old Farms, from 1980 to 1983. While at Avon, Juan distinguished himself as a hard-working student, a strong community leader, and an outstanding athlete. He captained three teams while here: cross-country in the fall, basketball (one of Avon’s best teams in 1982-83, finishing 19-3), and of course, baseball. He was a monitor in the residential life program, an honor student in the classroom, and earned both the Jennings and Murray Cups in his junior and senior years as the school’s best athlete. Juan also was awarded the Order of Old Farms on his graduation day, which is the top award presented at Avon Old Farms for character, leadership, scholarship, and community service.\n\nDuring his senior year at Avon Old Farms, Juan was accepted to a number of universities (who offered him baseball scholarships) including USC, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Vanderbilt. Yet, in the midst of extensive Major League interest, Juan opted to sign a professional contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in June of 1983. Juan was the top high school “free agent” signee that year, as in 1983 Puerto Rican players were not eligible for the major league draft.\n\nIn his first outing as a professional in Single “A” ball during the summer of 1983, Juan pitched a no-hitter. Juan pitched another no-hitter later, this time with the Brewers’ major league club, in April of 1987. He is the only Brewer to have pitched a no-hitter and the second youngest pitcher in the history of major league baseball to have done so. Juan’s no-hitter is recognized in the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown. Juan Nieves is currently the pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox organization.\n\nInducted May 8th, 2004\n\nRoger Nicholas graduated from Avon Old Farms in 1976 and stands as one of the finest multi-sport athletes to have attended the School. Though born in Pennsylvania, Roger grew up in South Windsor, Connecticut. At Avon, he excelled as a citizen, student, and athlete. He was voted the top athlete in the school during his time at Avon and served as captain for both the hockey and lacrosse teams in 1976. He was a hard-working student, a dormitory monitor, and also played varsity football. In his senior year, he was the leading scorer on the hockey team (41 points in 21 games) and earned the Most Valuable Player award. He was also awarded the team’s Most Valuable Player award in lacrosse, and was the highest scoring midfielder in Western New England Prep School competition during his senior year. Roger also earned All-New England honors in lacrosse in 1976.\n\nFollowing graduation from Avon, Roger matriculated to Middlebury College and continued to excel in athletics. He earned varsity letters in both hockey and lacrosse in each of his four years in college. In the 1978-79 season, he led Middlebury to an E.C.A.C. hockey championship as a leading scorer on the team. In lacrosse, he broke all previous individual season scoring records in Middlebury College history; his 93 points (59 goals) in 1980 is still the all-time single season scoring record at Middlebury in lacrosse. He was recognized as a collegiate All-American lacrosse player in 1980.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Middlebury with a degree in Economics, Roger found his way to the professional hockey leagues in Europe. There, he enjoyed a 14-year professional career that included several top-ten season individual scoring performances and several league championships. In 1990-91 Roger was voted the best left wing in German professional hockey by a committee of coaches in the league.\n\nRoger Nicholas’s success and lifetime accomplishments are unique and incredibly impressive. He is an important part of the tradition of athletic excellence at Avon Old Farms, Middlebury College, and professional hockey in Europe. Further, his passion and commitment to participate in multiple sports as an amateur is inspiring for student-athletes who might choose to specialize in one sport only.\n\nInducted May 13th, 2006\n\nRaymond E. Godbout, Jr. was a swimmer for four years at Avon and co-captain of the swimming team. By the time he graduated in 1969, he had set records and achieved milestones that no other swimmer has ever accomplished in the history of Avon swimming—either before or since! Ray’s signature event was the butterfly, the most demanding stroke in competitive swimming. In that event he was virtually unbeatable. Ray went undefeated in dual-meet competitions in the 100-yard butterfly for all four years at Avon and, during his junior and senior years, Ray was simply the best prep school butterflier in New England. He won the 100-yard butterfly at the New England Prep School Swimming Championships back to back in 1968 and 1969, beating swimmers from Williston, Deerfield, Andover, Exeter, Mt. Hermon, and Hotchkiss, among others.\n\nRay set Avon school records in the100-yard butterfly, 200-yard individual medley, 400-yard freestyle, and was a member of the record-setting medley team. His butterfly record lasted nearly 20 years before it was finally broken. He also set Connecticut Independent School Swimming Association records in those same events as well as in the 100-yard freestyle. In addition to swimming, Ray was a member of the varsity cross country and track teams, and was recognized as Avon’s “Most Outstanding Athlete” in 1968.\n\nRay continued his stellar swimming career at the University of New Hampshire, where he co-captained the swimming team and established school records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly, the 200-yard individual medley, and was a member of UNH’s record-setting medley relay teams. Once again, Ray never lost in the 100-and 200-yard butterfly in four years of dual-meet competition. In 1972, as a junior, Ray broke the New England collegiate record in the 100-yard butterfly and, in 1973, he was named to the Yankee Conference All-Star Team in the 200-year butterfly and 200-yard individual medley after winning both events at the Conference Championships in record times.\n\nRay became Avon’s “Greatest Swimmer of All Time” not because of his physical talent, although that was clearly evident. It was due to his drive, his competitiveness, his will to succeed, and his work ethic. Ray aspired to be the best and he simply outworked everyone else—on every lap, in every practice, and in every dual meet or championship competition. As Ray himself once said: “Whenever I got to the starting blocks, I believed I could win. If I didn’t win, I’d work harder so I could beat him the next time.” That winning mindset and work ethic carried Ray to a successful business career as well. He earned his MBA with highest honors and then, over a 30-year career in human resources, held senior-level positions with a number of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nJack was a three-sport, varsity athlete at Avon Old Farms where he excelled at football, baseball and wrestling. He played fullback and linebacker in football and was a pitcher and first baseman in baseball. Following his Avon graduation, he became an All-American 2-way lineman for the Purdue Boilermakers. During his senior year, he was the left tackle for future, football Hall of Famer quarterback Bob Griese. In 1967, Purdue defeated USC in the Rose Bowl by the score of 14-13.

His greatest joy was to spend time with his family and friends at home, the café, or on a golf course. Jack passed away in 2008, leaving a legacy of tremendous accomplishment in both his professional and personal life. Jack's success in athletics enriched his life and his commitment to excellence was a hallmark of his character.\n\nInducted: May 16th, 2009\n\nIn 1959, a young Bill David first stepped onto the campus of Avon Old Farms School and very quickly the entire school came to realize that a very special person had joined the Avon Old Farms Brotherhood. The 1961 yearbook best describes the attributes Bill brought to Avon: \"reserved, authoritative, and versatile.\" He became one of the most respected members of the class in his two years at Avon. He excelled in leadership and athletics as evidenced by his being elected captain of the varsity football, hockey, and baseball teams. His prowess on the athletic fields was equally matched by his excellence in the classroom– where he was on the Honor Roll or Dean's List. Bill served as a monitor for two years – a role that would further establish him as a leader.\n\nWhen Bill graduated in 1961, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University and continued to excel in and out of the classroom. His exploits on the football filed were many and secured for him a legendary status in the proud history of Washington and Lee football. Bill was elected co-captain of the 1964 team and his accomplishments on the gridiron were rewarded by the many accolades he received as a standout two way player for the Generals. In 1963, he received the C.J. Harrington Memorial Football Award for the Outstanding Defensive Football Player of the Year. The following year, Bill would be named to the College Athletic Conference, All Conference Team. He was chosen as the Outstanding Virginia Small-College Player of the Year, earning him a spot on the All-State team Further outstanding play and leadership would cement his legendary status as he was named to the 1964 Little All-America team.\n\nEvery now and then there come to campus young men who by way of mind and body coupled with the indomitable will to win earn the enduring title of 'great athlete' – Bill David is one of these. His experience at Avon Old Farms School under the guidance of many great coaches and mentors helped shape his skill and attitude in his pursuit of excellence. We are pleased to recognize Bill: the Hall of Fame is made all the better with his inclusion.\n\nInducted November 7, 2015\n\nJorge Consuegra graduated from Avon in 1951 where he excelled as a student, football player, swimmer, and baseball player. At Old Farms, he won the “Buckley Cup” signifying excellent team leadership and athletic ability. Following his graduation from the University of Havana in 1956, political upheaval in Cuba forced Jorge and his family to exile to Miami in 1960. In 1963, Jorge returned to Avon to teach Spanish. He headed the language department for many years and also served as head of Eagle Dormitory. He dedicated his professional life to the educational mission of Avon Old Farms.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1981, Consuegra guided his varsity swim team to numerous winning seasons and league championships. Many of his swimmers still hold school records and many went on to stunning collegiate careers. During the mid-seventies, his swim teams won three Connecticut Independent School Swimming Association Championships. The 1975-76 squad was the first undefeated swim team in school history (12-0) defeating traditional powerful swim programs such as Loomis Chaffee, Suffield, and Hotchkiss. In addition to varsity swimming, Jorge used his magic touch and infectious winning attitude to produce an outstanding won-loss record in the Avon Old Farms football and baseball programs.\n\nInducted May 7th, 1994\n\nRetired from Avon: 1981\n\nInducted: May 7, 1994\n\nDr. Henry “Skip” Flanagan came to Avon Old Farms in 1972, and quickly distinguished himself as an outstanding teacher, coach, and school administrator. In his 10-year career at Avon Old Farms Skip was the chief architect of the outstanding lacrosse tradition at Avon Old Farms. Skip’s understanding of the game and phenomenal ability to work with young people resulted in the establishment of one of the most well-respected lacrosse programs at the prep school level. Skip coached many outstanding teams and players, but his 1979 team was undefeated and earned the New England Division I Prep School title. Thanks to the firm foundation fashioned through Skip’s hard work, skill, and perseverance, Avon Old Farms lacrosse remains one of the premiere programs in the country.\n\nIn addition to writing a book on lacrosse (Basic Lacrosse Strategy for Young Players), Skip was one of the first to start a summer camp for young, talented, and enthusiastic players. The camp was held here at Avon Old Farms School, and Skip is personally responsible for introducing and advancing the game to thousands of young people.\n\nSkip Flanagan is an educator. Whether at Avon Old Farms in a variety of different capacities over the years, or while he was Headmaster at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, he brings passion, skill, and incredible knowledge to his work. He has done much for the sport of lacrosse through his efforts to teach, promote, and inspire enthusiasm for the game.\n\nInducted May 8th, 2004\n\nPeter Evans grew up in southern California, but became a New Englander when he attended Amherst College in the 1960s. As a high school and collegiate student-athlete, Peter not only excelled in the classroom, but also distinguished himself as a basketball and baseball player. In fact, he earned a starting position on both the basketball and baseball teams at Amherst College. After graduating from college and serving as an officer in the Navy, Peter joined the faculty at Avon in 1971. Over his four decades at the school, he has had a transformative influence on Avon Old Farms in virtually every area of school life. In addition to being a master classroom teacher, Peter has an impact as an admission officer, athletic director, college counselor, dean of students, assistant headmaster, and director of development. Peter Evans’s leadership in so many critical areas has helped to define Avon as an institution.\n\nWhile Peter has achieved impressive success in guiding the institutional development and advancement of Avon as a school, his leadership in the athletic area, particularly the baseball program, occupies a special place in his legacy. He led the baseball program for 30 years, and, by any measure, he accumulated a remarkable record of success. His 355 wins and 18 league championships make him one of the most accomplished Avon coaches of all time and one of the best in New England, as well. His ability to attract interested student-athletes and to teach them to develop their abilities resulted in dozens of Avon players transitioning smoothly to become impact players at the college level and beyond. In this regard, most notable of Evans’s former players is Juan Nieves ’83, who, after graduating from Avon, pitched the only no-hitter in Milwaukee Brewers history before coming a coach at the major league level. Perhaps more important than the impressive win totals, championships collected, and accomplishments of alumni, Peter created an environment on the baseball field that served to teach young men to be successful people. One of his former players comments, “Coach Evans is a wonderful man who taught me how to respect people and the game, how to work hard to achieve goals, and how to be a better person. He is not only the best coach I have ever had, but he is also one of the best people I have ever met. When I was playing for him, he cared more about me as a person than me as an athlete, and I am truly grateful to have him in my life.” Another alumnus comments, “I played college baseball and have been involved in professional baseball for more than 20 years. I have never had more fun or been in a better learning environment than when I played for Peter Evans at Avon Old Farms.”\n\nInducted: May 21, 2011\n\nHenry R. Coons ’71, P’07 played varsity football, basketball, and baseball at Avon. He was captain of varsity football and varsity baseball.

On graduation day, he was awarded the Buckley Cup given to the best senior athlete.\n\nAt Division III Muhlenberg College, he was a four year letterman in football as a defensive halfback and wide receiver and baseball as an outfielder. In 1973 the Mules Football team went 7-1-1 and beat Widener College, a team that featured two future all pros Joe Fields and Billy “White Shoes” Johnson.\n\nIn 1976 he became a member of the faculty and during his 43 years at school he coached a variety of sports including, football, basketball, wrestling, baseball, and tennis. He was very fortunate to have coached outstanding young athletes and work with talented assistant and head coaches during his tenure. Even more important, was the amazing support of his wife Marie and children Christina, Brittany, and Casey.\n\nAs a head JV and assistant varsity football coach over 22 years he had a record of 112 wins and 34 losses, and 5 undefeated seasons. As head varsity tennis coach for 39 years, his overall record was 307-228 in a very competitive Founder’s League. During those years there were two notable winning eras (1992-1995) 44-11 and (2001-2005) 65-9. In 2003, the team went 13-0 in the regular season and lost to Milton Academy in the New England Championships in the semi-finals 4-1. Milton then swept Deerfield in the finals.\n\nIf Coach Coons were to be asked about his overall coaching philosophy it would be: “Practice for precision and perfection, play for keeps.”\n\nBeginning the year as the reigning New England Champs, the 2004-2005 Varsity Hockey team knew that it would be the target of every opponent, all of whom were trying to make a statement. However, when the final buzzer sounded at season's end, it was Avon Old Farms that had made the statement! This team went \"two in a row\" in each major category–winning the Avon Christmas Classic, the Founders League title, and finally the New England Division One Prep School Championship. The \"Avon Army\" was there in force supporting the team game in and game out and especially at the New England tournament in Salem, New Hampshire. Behind a formidable defense anchored by spectacular goal-tending (9 shut-outs), this team outscored its opponents over the course of the season, 138 goals to 33. A powerful senior-dominated team, Avon Old Farms overwhelmed its opponents on a regular basis and ultimately produced an amazing 25-2 record.\n\nCoaches\n\nJohn Gardner\n\nBrian Doyle\n\nUlf Samuelsson\n\nRoster\n\nSean Backman '05\n\nChristopher Davis '05\n\nJoseph DeBello '05\n\nAugusto DiMarzo '05\n\nJeoffrey Jarnot '05\n\nJohn Mori '05\n\nJonathan Quick '05\n\nDillon Rioux '05\n\nJoseph Sides '05\n\nMatthew Smalley '05\n\nRobert Tesar '05\n\nBrian Warner '05\n\nTrevor Bradley '06\n\nStephen Driscoll '06\n\nBrendan Mahoney '05\n\nDonald McCarthy '05\n\nRyan Mero '05\n\nMark Pohlman '05\n\nEric Quinlan '05\n\nCoursen Schneider '05\n\nWilliam Siers '05\n\nNicholas Demopoulos '06\n\nJames Kerr '06\n\nThomas Atkinson '07\n\nBrian Malchoff '07\n\nKenneth Trentowski '07\n\nCameron Atkinson '08\n\nManagers\n\nChristopher Malloy '05\n\nMatthew Blaine '07\n\nBy any measure, the 2003 varsity tennis team was one of the most outstanding tennis teams in school history going back to 1953 when interscholastic competition began at Avon. The team went 14-1 with impressive wins against traditional tennis powers Andover, Hotchkiss, Taft, and Westminster. This achievement included a record number of shutout wins (7), a record number of away victories (11), first undefeated regular season (13-0) in thirty years, first Founders League Championship, first quarterfinal victory in the New England Prep School Championships over a strong Andover team, and a top four ranking in New England for the season.\n\nSenior captain and #1 Jonathan Hoak ’03 was “The Man.” He went undefeated 42-0 over three seasons in team matches and 38 and 5 in doubles’ competition. His only loss was in the finals of the New England Singles Championships in 2002. He was the #1 seed in the 2003 New England Championships that, unfortunately, were cancelled because of rain.\n\nWhile the numbers are impressive, the enduring legacy of this team was its daily focus, consistency, and hard work. But most importantly, the boys played with integrity and respect for the game of tennis. Whenever this team found itself down and almost out, it ALWAYS found a way to persevere.\n\nCoaches\n\nHenry Coons '71\n\nGregory Cooper\n\nRoster\n\nTyler Conant ’03Jonathan Hoak ’03 (Captain)Andrew Baris ’04James West ’04Matthew Jones ’05 David Rothschild ’05Sam Schindler ’05Sam Schindler ’05Andrew Schultz ’05Joon Sung ’04 (Manager)\n\nThe 1991 Varsity Football Team set many standards of excellence that remain cornerstones of the Avon Old Farms winning tradition. Led by two very strong captains, Bill Austin '92 and Ryan Hankard '92, this group of Winged Beavers played like a team on a mission for every game by outrunning, outmaneuvering, and outplaying the top prep schools in New England. Many members of this team were part of a 19 game winning streak, after completing the prior season with an unblemished record. These young men came to Avon Old Farms not only wanting to win a lot of football games and the Erickson League Championship, but to leave their perfect mark on a flourishing program. Like the classes and teams before them, this team laid the bricks and mortar that has won the Avon Old Farms football program the respect, admiration and national recognition as one of the top prep schools in the United States.\n\nInducted: May 13, 2017\n\nThe powerhouse reputation of today's Avon Old Farms football program was built on the backs of the 1987 varsity football team with their desire to live and play by the school's motto: Aspirando et Perseverando. After an impressive 7-1 season record, the team captured the Erickson League Football Championship for the first time in the history of the school. Led by Captain Brian Regan, the 1987 football team brought the school into the limelight and set the stage for Avon to become one of the most competitive and nationally ranked high school programs in the country. The offense scored often with a successful passing attack coupled with a powerful ground game. The Old Farms defensive uint was the finest in the league and built an unwavering barrier against the opposing offense with an aggressive line of effective players. The 1987 Avon Old Farms varsity football team helped elevate the recognition of the school as a competitive force and encouraged future generations of football players and athletes to continue the tradition of sportsmanship at Avon. The 1988 Avon Old Farms varsity football players are a historic group of men and their commitment as a team continues to serve as an example of excellence for generations of Avon men.\n\nInducted November 19, 2012\n\nThe 1984 varsity lacrosse team enjoyed an extraordinary season. Not only did they celebrate much success on the field and earn a reputation as one of the best teams in all of New England, but they also boasted a brilliant roster of remarkable talent. They finished with a 14-2 season record and outscored their competition by a 107-55 margin.\n\nSeveral members of the team went on to play at colleges and universities with top lacrosse programs such as Syracuse, Johns Hopkins, University of North Carolina, Harvard, University of New Hampshire, University of Pennsylvania, Bucknell, Franklin and Marshall, and Dartmouth. Furthermore, some members of the 1984 team made an impact at the professional level of lacrosse following college. The 1984 lacrosse team is a collection of some of the best athletes to ever wear the Avon colors and they enjoyed a historic season in the spring of 1984.\n\nInducted: May 16, 2009\n\nDespite the flooding of the fields during the early part of the football season, the 1955 varsity football team became the first team in Avon Old Farms School history to win a Connecticut State Championship. Under the leadership of co-captains Charles Scaglione and John Murphy, the team boasted a powerful offensive and defensive line, and a backfield that was considered to be the top in New England, and sophomore quarterback Al Nesbitt led the team in scoring.\n\nMany of the starters played both offense and defense. After a tough loss to Hopkins, a powerhouse program in the 1950s, the team bounced back against four much larger schools to win their final four games of the season and claim the Connecticut State Championship. The 1955 team will be remembered as one of the best in school history, but more importantly, as pioneers of the outstanding tradition of Avon Old Farms football."
