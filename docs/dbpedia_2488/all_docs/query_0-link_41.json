        "text": "By: Richie Murray – USAC Media\n\nSpeedway, Indiana (April 2, 2023)………Jim Rieder, a longtime team owner, builder and mechanic whose cars won a total of 15 USAC National events throughout the 1970s and 1980s, multiple ARDC Midget title and earned induction into the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame, passed away on April 1, 2023, in Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nRieder, a New Jersey native whose given last name was Riemenschneider, owned cars that won some of the most marquee events and championships in open wheel auto racing, including the Night Before the 500 on three occasions in 1972-85-87, plus the 1972 Hut 100 and the 1977 Hoosier Hundred.\n\nMost notable early on for his association with driver Duane “Pancho” Carter Jr., Rieder and Carter teamed up to capture the USAC National Midget title in 1972. While Carter captured the driving championship that year, Rieder’s Sesco-powered machine took a career best third in the final entrant standings.\n\nRieder’s first USAC Midget win as a car owner was a biggie as Carter claimed the Night Before the 500 at the Indiana State Fairgrounds dirt mile in May of 1972. Later that season, the two notched the Hut 100 at the Terre Haute (Ind.) Action Track half-mile dirt track. Along the way, the Rieder and Carter combo scored a total of nine USAC Midget victories between 1972-73.\n\nIn that same time frame, Rieder put together a dirt championship car to compete in what is now known as the USAC Silver Crown series. The success translated from the little cars to the big cars seamlessly with Carter tallying wins for Rieder during the 1976 Salt City 100 at the New York State Fairgrounds followed by a dominant performance in the 1977 Hoosier Hundred at the Indiana State Fairgrounds where the team won the pole, then led all 100 laps en route to the victory. That year, Rieder’s team finished a career-best sixth in the USAC Dirt Championship standings.\n\nRieder reemerged with USAC in 1983 on the Regional Midget level with driver John Jenkins, then hired Nick Fornoro Jr., which kickstarted a renaissance period for the Rieder Racers team. In 1985, “Nokie” and Rieder were a triple threat, winning the American Racing Drivers Club (ARDC), Super Midget Racing Association and Eastern States Midget championships all within a single season.\n\nAlso, in 1985, Fornoro and Rieder scored the Night Before the 500 on the pavement at Indianapolis Raceway Park, then went indoors to pocket a big payday during the winter at the Hoosier Dome Invitational in Indianapolis, Ind. In 1986, the pairing won 23 times in total while repeating as ARDC champs and added an All Star Outlaw Midget crown to the mantle. In 1987, the team came back to win a third Night Before the 500 at IRP, once again with Fornoro at the wheel.\n\nIn all, Rieder owns 46 ARDC Midget victories and 16 triumphs with USAC as a team owner between the Silver Crown and Midget divisions. In later years, Rieder migrated from his native east coast to Danville, Ind. Among the accolades and awards he’s been bestowed are ARDC’s Ken Hickey Award as well as USAC’s Regional Midget Mechanic of the Year in 2007 and induction into the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nRieder’s involvement in the sport of auto racing spans over half a century. He served as ARDC President in 1971 and began building racecars in his home’s basement in 1974. In addition to midgets, he constructed TQ Midgets, even of the rear-engine variety.\n\nRieder Racers has always been a devoted family race team and the tight-knit unit was always supportive of the efforts with his wife, Diane Riemenschneider, and daughter, Judy Riemenschneider Arteaga, by his side. Jim’s work on racing teams continued well into the 2000s, serving as a mechanic and mentor for son Matt Riemenschneider’s racing ventures and was supportive of many drivers as both a crewman and mentor."
