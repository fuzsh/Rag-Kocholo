        "text": "Los Angeles, CA. - Retired USAC Midget driver/car owner Don Weaver telephoned me during February 2006 with a request. Weaver, the founder/organizer of the annual Legends of Ascot at Perris Auto Speedway (PAS) was preparing a program for the October 21, 2006 fourth annual Legends of Ascot luncheon/induction ceremonies from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm in a huge, 18,000 sq. ft. tent near the PAS grandstand. All 700 tickets to the Legends of Ascot affair were sold weeks before the event. The Legends of Ascot event has raffles, awards, auctions, display of vintage open-wheel racing cars, food and bench racing during the afternoon. It is followed that evening by a USAC/CRA Sprint Car point race on the outstanding, clay half-mile PAS track. This year a guest will be 1963 Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli Jones. Special guest honoree will be four-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser, Sr. Both Indy champions and retired CRA champion Jimmy Oskie will drive exhibition laps that evening in three of the 50+ vintage racing cars on display October 21 at The PAS.\n\nAscot Park, a renowned half-mile clay track in Gardena, California, operated 34 years from 1957 through 1990. The current Legends of Ascot affair celebrates the people who were involved in some capacity at the historic Ascot track. The 19 past inductees into the Legends of Ascot Hall of Fame were: 2003 - (5) - J. C. Agajanian, Sr, Allen Heath, Parnelli Jones, Ray Scheetz and Harry Schooler; 2004- (9) - Bruce Bromme, Sr. and Jr, Rusty Espinoza, Ed Hudson, Johnny Moorhouse, Ron Shaver, Dean Thompson, Ron \"Sleepy\" Tripp and Billy Wilkerson; 2005 - (5) - Ted Halibrand, Bob Hogle, Danny McKnight, Hal Minyard and Alex Morales. This year the eight honorees will be Jack Brunner, Ed Donovan, Walt James, Jack and Wilda Kindoll, Lealand McSpadden, Jimmy Oskie, and Wally Pankratz. Glenn Howard will receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50+ years of devotion to auto racing in many capacities.\n\nWeaver wanted me to compile an accurate list of midget and/or sprint car drivers who raced at Ascot Park and also in the Indianapolis 500. They could have raced at Ascot either in their formative years before they raced in the Indy 500 of after they raced in the Indy 500. I accepted Don's challenge because it was the winter season and I had time to dig into this project with gusto. I checked my old Floyd Clymer Indianapolis 500 Yearbooks, USAC annual yearbooks, old issues of National Speed Sport News and my Ascot race programs from 1962-1990. My initial research listed 67 midget or sprint car drivers who raced at Ascot and in the Indy 500. More research brought my list to 77 drivers. Subsequent review of my race programs and early compilation of midget and sprint car results surprised even me and brought my final list of drivers who raced at\n\nboth tracks to 90.\n\nAlphabetically, here are the 90 drivers who raced midgets or sprint cars at Ascot and who also raced in the Indianapolis 500. I have added more data on the 78th through 90th drivers on my list because they are the drivers I uncovered during my more extensive discovery phase. Their racing experience at Ascot surprised other racing historians and yours truly.\n\nA - George Amick (ran # 15 Harold Guidi Offy midget in 12/28/58 Ascot 100-lap race seven weeks before he was killed on the final lap of a USAC Champ Car race at the new 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway); John Andretti; Mario Andretti; Frank Armi - ran four USAC midget races at Ascot 4/61 (#20 Ward Offy), 4/62 (# 99jr Eddie Meyer Offy), plus 4/63 and 8/64 (# 35 A.
