        "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas – Johnny Rutherford, the winner of three Indianapolis 500s, is relaxing on the couch in his living room, where trophies and photographs illustrate a racing life gone exceptionally well.\n\nThis is also a man of eloquent storytelling, whose rich and gentlemanly delivery has made him one of the easiest listens motor sports has ever known.\n\nThe story he’s telling is an old favorite.\n\n“It’s early May 1963 (at Indianapolis Motor Speedway), and we’re pushing the car out to pit lane to do the final phase of my rookie test,” Rutherford begins. “I was carrying my helmet and when we got to where we’re supposed to (park the car), I dropped the helmet in the seat.”\n\nThen he looked up toward the infield bleachers.\n\n“And this cute little blonde is standing at the fence,” he says, smiling.\n\nAt this point, versions of the story differ slightly. Rutherford maintains an exchange of winks. The woman has challenged that account over the years, insisting they only waved.\n\n“Nevertheless,” he stresses, “I saw her.”\n\nFrom there, Rutherford climbed in the roadster and drove out for his mandatory test, running low on the track early on as USAC officials directed. Upon being allowed to proceed to the test’s final phase, Rutherford drifted the car up into the fast lane reserved for the most experienced. That's when Indy bit him.\n\n“I yodeled it in there on the second or third lap and got in too high,” he said. “Being a sprint car driver, I kind of sawed that (steering) wheel and she got away from me and spun. Didn’t hit anything, but I stalled and stopped.”\n\nThe rescue truck came to retrieve him, and the ride back to the pits counts as one of the most nerve-wracking of Rutherford’s career.\n\n“I just knew (chief steward) Harlan Fengler was going to send this young kid back to Texas to get more experience,” he said. “Sure enough, Harlan was standing there in the pits wearing his red-snapped brimmed hat, and he asked me if I knew what I did wrong. I said, ‘Yes sir.’ ”\n\nFengler apparently approved of the fact Rutherford’s story matched that of veteran driver Duane Carter, who had been observing the rookie. Rutherford was told to take the rest of the day off, think about his mistake overnight and return the next day to try again.\n\n“Whew, boy!” Rutherford remembers of his relief.\n\nEspecially in those dangerous days of racing, drivers needed short memories to move past an accident, and Rutherford, then 25, obviously had mastered that because history shows he stopped thinking about Fengler seconds after walking into Gasoline Alley. It was there, in the doorway of the first aid station, that he noticed “the cute little blonde” standing with her friends.\n\nMore than a half-century later, Rutherford still remembers his line.\n\n“Haven’t I seen you somewhere else before?”\n\nThe next day, after Betty Hoyer of Osgood, Ind., decided she could confirm Rutherford wasn’t married, she agreed to have dinner with him, although she brought along a fellow nurse to make sure no funny business occurred. It didn’t there, but the two Indy newbies were soon on a fast track. A month later they were engaged. A month after that they were married.\n\nThursday was their 53rd wedding anniversary. It was their most bittersweet.\n\n* * *\n\nJohnny Rutherford, 78, has hundreds of photographs of his driving career, many of them framed. One stands out.\n\nHanging above the couch where he’s sitting on this warm summer afternoon is a large portrait of him with the Borg-Warner Trophy. As is Rutherford's custom, his eyes focus on neither of those elements, preferring to see Betty standing between them.\n\n“It was taken last year,” he said, proudly.\n\nIt wasn’t taken this year because for the first time in Rutherford’s life, he didn’t spend May in Indianapolis with Betty. She has been suffering from severe memory loss, forcing his decision to move her to a nearby care center in early May. That made Thursday's anniversary unlike any other in their storybook marriage. Instead of waking up with her in their home of the past 43 years, he had to drive a few miles to see her.\n\n“It was the hardest thing I ever had to do,” he said of the move. \"But it was the right thing to do, and they really take care of her and the other nice women who are there. They get three meals a day, and the other day they went to the zoo.\"\n\nWhile Johnny visits her daily, the ache in his heart pours out in his actions. A motion to the other end of the couch notes her place where for years they watched television and talked through current events. They bought this two-story house in River Oaks in 1973, raising two children, John and Angela. Family portraits hang along the stairway's wall. In many ways it's as if Betty will be home this evening.\n\nOf all the visits with Indianapolis 500 winners during IndyStar’s Trip Down Victory Lane series, this is the closest to Americana. The home is stately without being overstated. Betty's collectibles are showcased as nicely as Johnny's trophies.\n\nThe visit was scheduled for an hour, but it spanned five as Johnny seemed to appreciate the diversion of racing talk. There was dinner at the Mexican restaurant he and Betty favored, where they were as regular and authentic as the enchiladas. Appropriately, their table sat empty, which their usual waitress noted.\n\nBack at the house, Johnny gave a tour of the race shop he built – his place to tinker with the midget that first drew him into racing. That, too, is a diversion for him on these long, sometimes lonely days.\n\nBefore Johnny’s father moved the family to Texas in the early 1950s, they lived in Tulsa, Okla., where midget racing was – and remains – a big deal. Johnny can still rattle off the names of the drivers he was captivated by. The cars of those Saturday nights drew him in, too, particularly a yellow one bearing the designation “7 Jr.”\n\nThe car was owned and often raced by Clarence Merritt of Chelsea, Okla., and one night Johnny was standing with his box camera when the car came rolling past with St. Louis’ Mel Wainright at the wheel.\n\n“I walked up to the wood fence, leaned over and yelled, ‘Hey, Mel,’ and I snapped the picture,” he said.\n\nAn 8x10 version of that black-and-white photograph hangs in Johnny’s workshop. Until recently, the car built from a Kurtis Kraft kit, a gift from Merritt himself, was there, too, but it’s being refurbished.\n\n“That’s how I got hooked in racing,” Johnny said of the car with a Ford V8-60 engine built by the brother of the 500’s first three-time winner, Louis Meyer. “It was something to see those little midget cars going around a quarter-mile dirt track, all the bright paint jobs, the chrome, everything.\n\n“It was the sounds and the smells. It was something.”\n\n* * *\n\nHanging high above Rutherford’s trophy case is a painting of him dueling A.J. Foyt at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1965.\n\nThat day, Rutherford led 69 of the 167 laps for his first champ car win, but the kicker is, Rutherford wasn’t the owner’s choice to be in the seat.\n\nBob Wilke, the founder of Leader Card Racers, preferred Chuck Hulse, but Wilke was in Europe on business that week and left chief mechanic A.J. Watson to make the driver decision. Watson preferred Rutherford, and Watson didn’t tell the boss of his choice until a telephone call after the 250-mile race.\n\n“That was a big moment for me, and I won the national sprint car championship that year, too,” Rutherford said. “That really put me on the map.”\n\nThe next April, the map changed directions. In the second sprint car race of the ’66 season, a rock struck Rutherford in the head at Eldora Speedway in Rossburg, Ohio. His car flipped high off the track. Rutherford broke both of his flailing arms, suffered a bad concussion, missed the rest of the year and thought his career was derailed.\n\n“Because owners thought once you crashed like that you’re probably not as good afterwards,” he said.\n\nRutherford eventually was, of course, and while he didn’t win another champ car race until 1973, he had stirring moments, including battling Al Unser’s Johnny Lightning for Indy’s pole in ’70. Rutherford was driving a 4-year-old Eagle with a front end modified by chief mechanic Mike Devin.\n\n“Al and I ran the closest pole time – one one-thousandth of a mile per hour,” Rutherford said. “(USAC’s) Bob Laycock said they plotted it and had we started together and done our four (qualifying) laps, Al would have beaten me by 2½ feet.\n\n“That put me back on Broadway, so to speak.”\n\nRutherford finished his career with 27 IndyCar victories, including Indianapolis 500 wins in 1974 and ’76 for Bruce McLaren and in ’80 for Jim Hall. Rutherford’s most famous ride is the one he used to win the 1980 race, a Pennzoil-sponsored Chaparral known as the Yellow Submarine.\n\nImages of that car are plentiful here, too. That it’s yellow like the midget of his youth adds to the synergy of his racing life.\n\nAfter retiring from driving in 1994, Rutherford began driving the pace car first for CART, then for the fledgling Indy Racing League and finally the unified IndyCar series. He also oversaw scores of rookie tests over the years.\n\nRutherford could have maintained his professional pace, but Betty is his priority, and he needs to be home, even as she can't be. Thus, the recent 500 became Rutherford’s final drive.\n\n“You cross bridges as they come to you,” he said.\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Curt Cavin on Facebook and Twitter: @curtcavin.\n\n• Scott Dixon a Hoosier at heart and home\n\n• Eddie Cheever still outspoken\n\n• Sam Hornish's life vastly different\n\n• 'Champion Cave' tells Bobby Rahal's story\n\n• Gordon Johncock prefers talking lumber\n\n• Tony Kanaan may be moving into a neighborhood near you\n\n• Tom Sneva still on the gas\n\n• Helio Castroneves racing toward future\n\n• Ryan Hunter-Reay at home on the water\n\n• Life at the top fits Juan Pablo Montoya\n\n• Gil de Ferran is a designer\n\n• Bobby Unser's house of fame\n\n• Al Unser Jr. faced demons, looks forward\n\n• Arie Luyendyk long on collectibles, not hair\n\n• Buddy Lazier's need for Speed\n\n• Danny Sullivan's spin to success\n\n• Success still shows in Parnelli Jones' office"
