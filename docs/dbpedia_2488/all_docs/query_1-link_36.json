        "text": "According to The Athletic, San Jose Sharks fans' confidence in Mike Grier and the front office has significantly improved from the Summer of 2023.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nIn 2023, the Sharks' front office's confidence level was ranked 29th. This season, the Sharks' new ranking is 13th. In the survey, fans were required to give grades to six categories: roster building, cap management, drafting and development, trading, free agency, and vision.\n\nThe Athletic quoted some fans about what changed from last season to this season.\n\n\"Generally happy with the team's direction and drafting. Too soon to know on player development â€” none of Grier's picks have played an NHL game yet, but all reports say the picks have been strong and most picks from 2022 and 2023 would go higher in a re-draft today,\" one fan said.\n\nDrafting Macklin Celebrini first overall certainly helps fans and the public see a brighter future in San Jose. However, after last season's 19-win season, roster building remains unknown for Mike Grier.\n\nSigning Tyler Toffoli and Alex Wennberg are excellent additions to a young roster, but in 24-25, the Sharks will need to see the team mesh on the ice. Grier also wasn't shy about making a change behind the bench with Ryan Warsofsky. San Jose underwent a minor \"surgery\" this summer, and now it's time for Grier to continue to prove that his vision will bring the Sharks success.\n\nRelated: Mike Grier Isn't Concerned With Amount Of Forwards; Expects Sharks Training Camp To Be Most Competitive Since Taking Over\n\nMake sure you bookmark THN's San Jose Sharks site for the latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nWhat Is Macklin Celebrini's Rookie Season Ceiling?\n\n49ers Media Personality Invited To Sharks Game By Team President\n\nOne Year Later: Sharks Trade Erik Karlsson To Penguins\n\nCould The Sharks Add Another Eklund?\n\nFormer Oilers First-Round Pick Could Add To Sharks Forward Competition\n\nSharks Prospect Opens Eyes At World Junior Summer Showcase"
