NICOSIA, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci agreed to meet for the first time after many months, government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said on Wednesday.

He said in a written statement that Anastasiades, who is both President of Cyprus and the leader of the Greek Cypriot community, had a telephone conversation with Akinci, during which they agreed to meet in the second half of February.

Anastasiades said on Monday that he wanted to meet with Akicni to talk on how to move forward on a deal to restart the stalled peace negotiations for the reunification of Cyprus.

The eastern Mediterranean island was partitioned when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of Cyprus in 1974, in response to a coup by the Greek military rulers.

Jane Holl Lute, a United Nations official tasked by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to draft the terms of reference for the resumption of negotiations, left Cyprus on Tuesday without announcing an agreement.

Prodromou said that she would visit the guarantor powers, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom, for talks before deciding when to return for Cyprus.

Prodromou on Wednesday urged Turkey to display political will during contacts with Lute by making a positive proposal on the termination of guarantee rights it obtained when Cyprus was granted independence by Britain in 1960 and on its alleged intervention rights, which it invoked as an excuse for its 1974 military operation.

He noted that Greece and the United Kingdom told the Secretary General at a conference in Switzerland in July, 2017, that they did not want to be guarantor powers any more.

Guterres also said that Turkey told him it was ready to discuss abolishing guarantee and intervention rights during the conference. However, its foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said publicly later that Guterres did not understand well, leading the conference to a breakdown.
