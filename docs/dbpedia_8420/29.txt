Centre-right leader Nicos Anastasiades has won the Cypriot presidential election with 57.5% of the vote.

It was a comfortable victory over Communist-backed Stavros Malas on 42.5%. Mr Malas has admitted defeat.

Mr Anastasiades takes power as Cyprus stands on the brink of bankruptcy, hit by the knock-on effect of Greece's economic woes.

He favours a quick deal with foreign lenders to finalise a bailout of the Cypriot economy.

"My first priority is to reinstate Cyprus' credibility,'' Mr Anastasiades, 66, said in a victory speech in front of his jubilant supporters in the capital Nicosia.

"I'm determined to work together with our EU partners, and - at the same time - fulfil our responsibilities to the utmost. I am committed to making all the necessary measures to steer our country out of the economic crisis.''

Supporters of Mr Anastasiades's Democratic Rally party waved Cypriot and Greek flags and set off firecrackers across the island.
