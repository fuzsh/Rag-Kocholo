        "text": "The president, who serves as both head of state and head of government, is elected by popular vote for up to two five-year terms. President Nicos Anastasiades of the center-right Democratic Rally (DISY) party won a second term with 56 percent of the vote in a 2018 runoff against Stavros Malas, who was backed by the left-wing Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL). The two had outpolled seven other candidates in the first round. International observers found that the overall election process adhered to democratic principles.\n\nThe next presidential election was set for February 2023, and Anastasiades said he would not seek a third term, quieting a debate on whether a 2019 constitutional amendment imposing the two-term limit should apply retroactively.\n\nThe unicameral House of Representatives has 80 seats filled through proportional representation in six multimember electoral districts. Members serve five-year terms. In practice, only 56 seats are occupied, as the 24 seats reserved for the Turkish Cypriot community have been left unfilled since Turkish Cypriot representatives withdrew from the chamber in 1964.\n\nIn the 2021 legislative elections, which were held in accordance with international standards, DISY led the voting with 17 seats, down one from 2016, followed by AKEL with 15, also a one-seat decline. The centrist Democratic Party (DIKO) received nine seats, the far-right National Popular Front (ELAM) received four, the Movement for Social Democracy–Citizens’ Alliance (EDEK-SYPOL) also took four seats, and the Green Party (KOSP) secured three seats. The liberal centrist Democratic Alignment (DIPA) won parliamentary representation for the first time, receiving four seats.\n\nAlso in 2021, the parliament voted to postpone that year’s municipal elections until the 2024 implementation of structural reforms that would, among other changes, reduce the number of municipalities. The incumbent municipal councils would remain in place while the reforms were pending.\n\nThree recognized Christian minority groups—the Armenians, the Latins (Catholic), and the Maronites—each have one nonvoting representative in the parliament. Members of these communities vote in special elections for their representatives, as well as in the general elections. The 24 seats reserved for the Turkish Cypriot population remain unfilled. However, in the 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections, AKEL’s Niyazi Kızılyürek became the first Turkish Cypriot to be elected to the EP or to win office in the Republic of Cyprus since 1964.\n\nWomen in Cyprus have equal political rights, but sexism and patriarchal attitudes discourage them from playing a more active role in politics. No parliamentary party is led by a woman, and parties have failed to meet internal quotas mandating that 30 to 35 percent of their candidates be women. Only eight women were elected to the parliament in 2021, a decline from the 2016 results. Nevertheless, that year Annita Demetriou of DISY became the first woman to be elected as speaker of the Cypriot parliament.\n\nThe interests of the LGBT+ community, which still faces significant discrimination from some sectors of society, are not always well represented in the political system.\n\nImmigrants have some access to naturalization procedures and the political rights associated with citizenship, generally requiring several years of legal residency to apply. Separately, many Cyprus-born residents with one Turkish and one Turkish Cypriot parent have faced lengthy delays in their citizenship applications, leaving them stateless in some cases.\n\nCyprus has strong anticorruption laws that are, for the most part, adequately enforced. However, there have been a number of high-profile corruption scandals in recent years, and the government has faced criticism for early releases and pardons of individuals convicted on corruption charges.\n\nIn 2022, the authorities continued to revoke passports that had been granted illegally under a flawed citizenship-by-investment program. The program was terminated in 2020 following revelations that passports had been improperly issued to individuals with criminal records or links to foreign governments.\n\nReligious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and generally protected in practice. Nearly 90 percent of those living in government-controlled Cyprus are Orthodox Christians, and the Orthodox Church enjoys certain privileges, including religious instruction and some religious services in public schools. Non-Orthodox students may opt out of such activities. The government also constitutionally recognizes and subsidizes non-Orthodox Christian and Muslim religious institutions, and it facilitates crossings to and from Northern Cyprus for the purpose of worship at religious sites. Unrecognized religious groups can receive tax exemptions by registering as nonprofit organizations.\n\nMuslim groups have occasionally faced obstacles in the operation of their religious sites or discrimination by the general public. Muslims have criticized the hours of access to Hala Sultan Tekke, an important holy site in Larnaca that is administered by the Department of Antiquities. The site’s mosque is generally open for only two of Islam’s five daily prayers for most of the year, though extended hours are granted during Ramadan and at other times upon request.\n\nNGOs are generally free to operate without government interference. However, the government has used regulatory rules to harass specific organizations in recent years. A 2020 amendment to the law on associations empowered the Interior Ministry to swiftly deregister NGOs that it deems inactive or noncompliant with the law’s filing requirements. The ministry then deregistered Action for Equality, Support, Antiracism (KISA), which was known for its advocacy on behalf of migrants and asylum seekers, on the grounds that it failed to file documents with the Registrar of Associations within the required deadline. The necessary information was submitted after the deadline, but in 2021 the ministry ordered banks to freeze the organization’s assets, and the Administrative Court rejected KISA’s appeal of the deregistration. An appeal to the Supreme Court was still pending at the end of 2022. Also during the year, several NGOs had their bank accounts temporarily frozen under indiscriminate policies related to addresses in Northern Cyprus or protections against money laundering.\n\nDespite government efforts to combat prejudice and inequality, members of non–Greek Cypriot minority groups, including migrants and asylum seekers, face discrimination and occasional violence.\n\nA total of 21,565 new asylum applications were filed in Cyprus during 2022, a 63 percent increase from the 2021 total. Partly as a result of this rise, there were some 30,000 asylum applications pending at the end of 2022, up from nearly 19,000 at the end of 2021. A specialized administrative court began operating in 2019 to handle appeals. In 2021, the government simplified procedures for hiring asylum seekers, though they were permitted to work only in certain sectors and categories of employment. Most asylum seekers arrive by land through the TRNC, prompting allegations from the Cypriot government that Ankara is encouraging irregular migration. Cypriot authorities have engaged in controversial maritime pushbacks to Lebanon to prevent arrivals by sea.\n\nOvercrowding and other poor conditions at the Pournara reception center have been exacerbated by the rise in new arrivals, prompting periodic protests by the residents. The center, built in 2014 as an emergency reception facility for up to 400 people, was later expanded to accommodate 1,000. By 2022 it reportedly hosted more than 2,000 people, with authorities struggling to properly house unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups.\n\nGender discrimination in the workplace remains a problem, including with respect to hiring practices, salaries, and sexual harassment; laws against such discrimination have not been adequately enforced.\n\nAntidiscrimination laws generally prohibit bias based on sexual orientation, and there are legal protections for transgender people on some issues. However, the LGBT+ community continues to face societal discrimination in practice.\n\nProperty rights are generally respected in Cyprus.\n\nA 1991 law stipulates that property left by Turkish Cypriots after 1974, when a Turkish invasion divided the island, is administered by the Interior Ministry. Under the law in the north, Greek Cypriots can appeal to the Immovable Property Commission (IPC), which has been recognized by the European Court of Human Rights as a responsible authority for the resolution of property disputes. However, its work has been seriously impaired in recent years by a lack of funding from the TRNC and Ankara.\n\nIn September 2022, the government confirmed that many Turkish Cypriot properties had been illegally sublet by Greek Cypriots who exploited the low rents charged by the Interior Ministry’s management agency. Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot owners continued to be denied access and restitution.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 4 to 3 because Turkish Cypriot property managed by the Interior Ministry has been regularly subjected to illegal subletting by Greek Cypriot residents."
