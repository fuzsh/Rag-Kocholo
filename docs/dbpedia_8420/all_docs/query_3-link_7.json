        "text": "Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades says he is battling against eurozone demands that all bank customers pay a one-off levy in return for a bailout.\n\nMr Anastasiades said he shared people's unhappiness with the terms, whereby all bank customers would pay a levy of 6.75% or 10% on their bank deposits.\n\nThe EU and IMF have demanded the levy in return for a 10bn-euro ($13bn; Â£8.6bn) bank bailout.\n\nAn emergency session of parliament has been postponed until Monday.\n\nMr Anastasiades said it was the worst crisis since Turkey invaded in 1974.\n\n\"I fully share the unhappiness caused by a difficult and painful decision,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why I continue to fight with the eurogroup to amend their decisions in the coming hours to limit the impact on small depositors.\"\n\nThe president said Cyprus had had to choose between stabilising its finances or the eventual collapse of its financial system and exit from the eurozone.\n\nUnder the bailout's terms, people in Cyprus with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts would have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75%. Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9% in tax.\n\nDepositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks, and Mr Anastasiades promised that those who kept deposits in Cypriot banks for the next two years would be given bonds linked to revenues from natural gas.\n\nCyprus announced the discovery of a field containing between 5 and 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 but Turkey disputes its drilling rights.\n\nIt is believed that eurozone leaders, particularly in Germany, insisted on the levy because of the large amount of Russian capital kept in Cypriot banks, amid fears of money-laundering.\n\nThe speaker of the European Parliament, Germany's Martin Schulz, has called for the levy to be revised to protect small-scale bank customers.\n\nIt is now clear that negotiators of the bailout in Brussels drastically underestimated the reaction in Cyprus, says the BBC's Mark Lowen.\n\nA tiny eurozone economy feels it is being blackmailed by the most powerful, and the growing resentment will do nothing to foster European solidarity, our correspondent adds.\n\n\"I bear the political cost for this, in order to limit as much as possible the consequences for the economy and for our fellow Cypriots.\"\n\nThe vote in parliament has been postponed to Monday afternoon. If the deal is defeated, state media say banks could be closed on Tuesday so as to avoid mass withdrawals.\n\nThe Cypriot president's Democratic Rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly - needs support from other factions to ratify the bailout.\n\nA spokesman for one of its coalition partners, the Democratic Party, told BBC News they wanted assurances that the deal would resolve the problems facing Cyprus before voting in favour.\n\nOpposition leader George Lillikas, an independent, said the president had \"betrayed the people's vote\".\n\nThe speaker of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for savers, for example, who had less than 25,000 euros in their accounts."
