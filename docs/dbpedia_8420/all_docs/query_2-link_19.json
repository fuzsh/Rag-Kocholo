        "text": "A week into his presidency, Nicos Anastasiades can already claim one distinction: of the seven men who have served as Cyprus’s president since the island gained independence from the UK in 1960, he is the first to be elected mainly for reasons other than the ‘national question’ – the island’s division between its ethnic Greek and Turkish communities.\n\nThe impact of the financial crisis in Greece coupled with Cypriot banks’ disproportionately high exposure to Greek debt, economic recession, record unemployment, and the previous administration’s reluctance to pursue a timely solution to structural economic problems all combined to make February’s election predominantly about who the voters think is the man most likely to steer Cyprus to calmer waters.\n\nThe 66-year-old lawyer, a member of parliament since 1981 and leader of his party – the centre-right Democratic Rally (DISY) – since 1997, will first and foremost have to finalise with a troika of international creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank – the terms of a bail-out roughly equivalent to the country’s €17.8 billion gross domestic product. He will then have to deliver on those terms while boosting economic growth.\n\nHis main advantage is that he is perceived to have credibility in Europe. His party has engaged consistently with the European People’s Party (EPP) in recent years, and Anastasiades himself has ensured that communication channels with Europe’s decision-makers – including German Chancellor Angela Merkel – have stayed open and active. The EPP’s president, Wilfried Martens, said last week that “Cyprus now has a reliable president that inspires confidence in Europe”. And, thanks mainly to his pro-market position and the negative record of outgoing President Demetris Christofias, most commentators had declared him to be the only credible candidate to deal with the bail-out negotiations.\n\nHowever, that kind of endorsement also heads the list of his (domestic) disadvantages. The troika has already indicated that it expects at least some of the country’s semi-state enterprises to be privatised, which could trigger strikes and other industrial upheaval. Another contentious issue is Anastasiades’s determination to apply for Cypriot membership of NATO’s Partnership for Peace, which is linked to his second major challenge: to revive the stalled process for resolving the ‘Cyprus problem’, defined – certainly – as Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island since 1974, and – arguably – as the Republic’s flawed 1960 constitution.\n\nThose challenges are compounded by pre-conceptions about him. Cypriot politics tend to be tribal and parochial, and many have not forgotten the role that Anastasiades’s father, Chrysanthos, played in the 1974 right-wing coup that served as a catalyst for Turkey’s invasion and subsequent 38-year occupation. (Chrysanthos Anastasiades agreed to be police chief in Limassol under Nicos Sampson’s abortive, week-long government.) This might not have been an issue had Nicos Anastasiades not publicly referred to the strong influence his father had on him.\n\nAlso, during the presidential election campaign, opponents repeated old criticism of Anastasiades’s support in 2004 for the United Nations plan for re-unifying the divided island. That support earned him pariah status for a number of years (and a grenade attack on his house at the time), and rancour lingers within his own party and his main election ally, the Democratic Party (DIKO). Conversely, his decision not to go for the easy option in 2004 and his ability to tough out the backlash may have helped convince some voters that he would make a good president in these trying times.\n\nHow Anastasiades dealt with criticism – including some mud-slinging – during the campaign is indicative of the man himself. A sharp and rousing public speaker with a no-nonsense style, he refused to respond to provocative statements, preferring to argue his case without mocking or badmouthing his rivals. Reputed to have a quick temper and an autocratic streak in the past, the general view is that age and experience have mellowed his behaviour. When supporters jeered on election night after Anastasiades expressed his appreciation of the other candidates, he was quick to scold them, saying: “Show respect. I respect them absolutely, and I expect you to show the same respect.”\n\nSomeone who has known Anastasiades since his student days says: “It’s rubbish to suggest that he doesn’t listen to opposing views and loses his temper easily. He is decisive, sets targets and plans methodically how he will achieve them – so he has a programme. He is tenacious, dynamic and has the courage of his convictions.”\n\nThe question now is how Anastasiades will approach his new job. An advocate of neo-liberal policies who believes in breaking the power of trade unions, he fought the election on a platform of cross-party support for a bail-out programme in the form of a “government of national unity”. The Cypriot constitution provides for an executive presidency, so Anastasiades – who has never held a ministerial position – was free to pick his own team to maximise his chances of success in delivering on the bail-out terms. However, his main electoral ally, DIKO, got four out of 11 cabinet posts, and with the exception of the finance ministry, the other main positions went to senior DISY members. Eyebrows were also raised at the lack of women in the cabinet.\n\nIn his first formal statement as president-elect, Anastasiades addressed Cyprus’s long history of political cronyism and clientelism, pledging to restore public confidence in the political process by modernising the state and promoting meritocracy. In a clear signal to the EU, he said: “We will implement an ambitious programme of structural changes and reforms both in the state and in our economy: a new model of government and a new model of economic growth.” He also emphasised that on his watch Cyprus will be consistent and will honour all its commitments, with the express aim of restoring credibility and trust.\n\nBut does he genuinely intend to be a root-and-branch reformer of the state and the economy, using the memorandum of understanding with the troika as a catalyst? And, if so, to what extent will he be shackled by his power-sharing deals and the traditional party trade in influence and favours? Culling civil servants affiliated with the previous administration would ease the task of hitting budget-reduction targets, but would do little to convince Cypriots that merit is now the main political criterion.\n\nSo the €17.5bn question therefore remains: will the Anastasiades presidency mark a new beginning in terms of governance, economic model and popular attitudes, or will it be business as usual, with a few ideological tweaks?\n\n1946: Born, Pera Pedi\n\n1969: Gained law degree, University of Athens"
