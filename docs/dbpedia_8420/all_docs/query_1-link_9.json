        "text": "Purpose of elections As in the previous elections, no party secured an outright majority and only two parties won more than 10 seats. The Democratic Rally (DISY), led by the present President of the Republic Nicos Anastasiades, remained the largest force in the House of Representatives and won 18 of the 56 seats at stake (see note 1). The AKEL (Left) New Forces, led by AKEL leader Andros Kyprianou, came second. The National People's Front (ELAM), led by Mr. Christos Christou, entered parliament for the first time.\n\nThe 2016 elections were the first to be held under President Anastasiades, who succeeded Mr. Demetris Christofias (AKEL) in 2013. Following the 2013 bailout received from the European Union, the IMF and the ECB, the country implemented a series of reforms and austerity plans. Both President Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci, elected in April 2015, have been advocating for reunification of the island as a federated State (see note 2). During the election campaigning, the major parties focused on reunification with Northern Cyprus and economic issues.\n\nNote 1:\n\nElections were held for the 56 members of the House of Representatives representing the Greek-Cypriot community. The remaining 24 members are elected by the Turkish-Cypriot community. Those seats have been vacant since 1985.\n\nNote 2:\n\nA coup d'Ã©tat in Cyprus on 15 July 1974 by Greek Cypriot and Greek elements favouring union with Greece was followed by military intervention by Turkey, whose troops established Turkish Cypriot control over the northern part of the island. A de facto ceasefire came into effect on 16 August 1974. Negotiations aim to achieve a solution for the unification of Cyprus based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and political equality in accordance with pertinent resolutions of the United Nations. Date of previous elections: 22 May 2011\n\nTiming of election: Upon normal expiry\n\nExpected date of next elections: May 2020\n\nNumber of seats at stake: 56 (full renewal)*\n\n*Elections were held for the 56 members of the House of Representatives representing the Greek-Cypriot community.\n\nThe remaining 24 members are elected by the Turkish-Cypriot community (seats currently vacant).\n\nNumber of candidates: 493 (385 men, 108 women)\n\nPercentage of women candidates: 16.2%\n\nNumber of parties contesting the election: 18\n\nNumber of parties winning seats: 8\n\nAlternation of power: No\n\nDate of the first session of the new parliament: 2 June 2016\n\nName of the new Speaker: Mr. Demetris Syllouris (Democratic Rally, DISY)"
