        "text": "On December 4, 2021 local time, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades met with Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi in Nicosia.\n\nYang Jiechi said, President Xi Jinping and Mr.âPresident have reached an important consensus on further development of China-Cyprus relations during theirârecent phone conversation, and jointly decided to upgrade China-Cyprus relations to a strategic partnership, charting the course for bilateral relations. Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two countries, both sides should take this opportunity to strengthen strategic mutual trust, firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns, actively expand the cooperation inâsuch areas as economy and trade, telecommunications, transportation and clean energy, and promote cultural and educational exchanges, so as to promote greater development of China-Cyprus ties from a new starting point. China supports all parties to strictly abide by the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,âand promote a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue. China is confident to host a streamlined, safe and wonderful Beijing Olympic Winter Games, and China welcomes Cypriot athletes to participate in the event.\n\nYang Jiechi pointed outâthat, China stands ready to work with all European countries, including Cyprus, to uphold mutual respect, make efforts to expand cooperation, and promote the sound and stable development of China-EU relations.\n\nAnastasiades said, my recent phone conversation with President Xi is very successful and the establishment of the Cyprus-China strategic partnership marks a new milestone in bilateral ties. Cyprus firmly pursuesâthe one-China policy, and will remain committed to the concepts of mutual respect, equal treatment and mutual benefit to deepen bilateral relations. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, Cyprus stands ready to work with China to further enhanceâhigh-level exchanges as well as exchanges and cooperation in areas such as economy and trade, culture, tourism and education,âso as to promote further progress of Cyprus-China relations. Cyprus is willing to actively play a constructive role inâsupportingâthe EU in strengthening dialogue and cooperation with China.\n\nOn the same day, Yang Jiechiâalso met with Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides."
