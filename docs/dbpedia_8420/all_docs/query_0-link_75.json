        "text": "Happy to meet an iconic Zambian businessman, Mark O'Donnell, \"the man who built Lusaka\". Mr O'Donnell is a titan in the Zambian business scene, revered for building an empire that spans hospitality, construction, real estate, distribution and retail. His success story has been 40 years in the making and is still unfolding. Zambia Tourism Matongo Matongo MARTHA Nanyangwe Agness Ilukena Barbara Dietrich Alberto Turkstra Marion Fromlet-Bruins Diplomatic World Institute Diplomatic World\n\nFeeling the weight of history. Today we toured the Oliver Tambo Heritage House in Lusaka, the former home of exiled South African anti-apartheid activist and African National Congress leader Oliver R. Tambo. He spent 22 years of his 30 years of exile living in this house before returning to South Africa in 1990. H.E. Hon Rodney Sikumba - MP Zambia Tourism Matongo Matamwandi MARTHA Nanyangwe Agness Ilukena Barbara Dietrich Alberto Turkstra Marion Fromlet-Bruins Diplomatic World Institute Diplomatic World\n\nA great piece of history in Lusaka! The Land Rover belonging to Zambia's father of the nation Kenneth Kaunda, which he used during his political campaigns and official duties in the years leading to the country's independence in 1964. The Land Rover has became synonymous with Kaunda‚Äôs grassroots approach to politics. The use of the Land Rover during political campaigns was a deliberate choice to connect with the ordinary citizens. It symbolized his accessibility and his willingness to be among the people.

The award winning Tongabezi eco-lodge leans into the tranquillity of its hidden location on the banks of the Zambezi River. A combination of romance and luxury a few kilometres upstream of the Victoria Falls.
