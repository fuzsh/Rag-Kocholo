        "text": "NEW YORK-Anadolu Agency\n\nPresident of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) Ersin Tatar on Sept. 25 met with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the 76th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe two exchanged views on the Cyprus issue, according to a statement by the U.N.\n\nTatar on Sept. 27 will attend a tripartite meeting and will meet with Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades at a luncheon to be hosted by the U.N. secretary-general.\n\nCyprus has been mired in a decades-long dispute between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, despite a series of diplomatic efforts by the U.N. to achieve a comprehensive settlement.\n\nEthnic attacks starting in the early 1960s forced Turkish Cypriots to withdraw into enclaves for their safety."
