        "text": "Outgoing head of State Nico Anastasiades (Democratic Assembly, DISY) won the Cypriot presidential election on 4th February in the 2nd round with 55.99% of the vote. He beat Stavros Malas, who was running as an independent candidate with the support of the Progressive Workers' Party (AKEL), who won 44.01% of the vote. In the 1st round organised on 28th January the latter won 30.24% of the vote and Nicos Anastasiades, 35.51%.\n\nNone of the 7 candidates eliminated in the 1st round of voting spoke in support of the two finalists.\n\nLess than three quarters of the Cypriots went to ballot - turnout totalled 73.97% i.e. 7.61 points less in comparison with the 2nd round of the previous presidential election on 17th and 24th February 2013 in Cyprus. We should recall that it is obligatory to vote in Cyprus.\n\n\"A new era starts tomorrow. The people are asking for cooperation and unity which we need in order to settle the challenges we face,\" declared Nicos Anastasiades when the results were announced.\n\nThe electoral campaign was dominated by economic issues. The outgoing president, who chose the tagline \"Progressing in Stability\" for his campaign, stood as a man of experience, the saviour of the Cypriot economy and the guarantor of the country's economic stability. He promised to establish a fund to help pay back a share of his countrymen's savings that were seized in 2013.\n\n\"Nicos Anastasiades' asset is to have enabled Cyprus to recover from a serious economic crisis. Many voters doubt that he can solve the issue of the island's reunification, but in the end they voted with their purses. Stavros Malas was deemed partly responsible for the economic crisis at the beginning of 2010. The fact that the Democratic Party (DIKO) chose not to support either of the two finalists also helped Nicos Anastasiades, because voters are closer to the Democratic Assembly than the Progressive Workers Party,\" indicated Fiona Mullen, Director of Sapienta Economics. \"The reunification of our country is our greatest challenge. I shall work towards it with the same determination as before so that we can achieve our common goal: the end of foreign occupation and the reunification of our country. There will be neither victors nor losers, only Cyprus counts,\" declared Nicos Anastasiades.\n\nHe promised to revive negotiations that are notably stalling over the presence of more than 40,000 Turkish soldiers in the Northern party of the island (Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan is asking for the upkeep of the Turkish military base, whilst the Republic of Cyprus is demanding the departure of all troops presently stationed in the north), territorial adjustments and guarantees of security.\n\nAged 71 and from Pera Pedi (south-west), Nicos Anastasiades is a law graduate. He was elected as an MP to the Vouli antiprosopon, the only house in parliament, continuously between 1981 and 2013. In 1997 he took the leadership of the Democratic Assembly of which he was a founder. Elected for the first time as President of the Republic on 24th February 2013 he won on 4th February, with the Cypriots preferring him once more, and, as five years ago, in preference to Stavros Malas."
