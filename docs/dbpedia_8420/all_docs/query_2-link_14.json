        "text": "A resolution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the values of the Council of Europe, respecting liberties and human rights, is a sine qua non condition for stengthening democratic security in Europe and the south-eastern Mediterranean region, said Nicos Anastasiades, President of Cyprus, addressing the Assembly.\n\nHe also highlighted the decisive role played by the Parliamentary Assembly, as the only forum in which democratic dialogue takes place between the 47 member States of the Council of Europe, a bridge between the people of Europe, embracing cultural diversity, promoting mutual understanding and forging consensus, on the basis of common principles.\n\nMr Anastasiades also welcomed the PACE initiative #NoHateNoFear, which is of particular importance in a current context where xenophobic and other kinds of hate speech, populism and extremism are on the rise."
