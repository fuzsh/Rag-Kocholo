Ergün Olgun and Greek Cypriot Negotiator Menelaos Menelaou.\n\nMr Stewart, who praised the “number of achievements” between the two Sides in the past year, thanked President Tatar and Mr Anastasiades for attending the social event, and also thanked the co-chairs and coordinators of the technical committees, who were also present at the reception, “for their perseverance in seeking common ground across a wide range of areas of mutual benefit”.\n\nMr Stewart said that there has been an increase in Green Line Regulation trade volume which he added is expected to reach record levels in 2022. He said the two Sides have this year started to trade non-animal processed food for the first time, which he said is important to women who work in the agri-food sector. Stating that work is continuing with regards to banking-related issues, Mr Stewart added that the positive impacts of a Joint Contact Room opened in the village of Pile is addressing criminal activity there, whilst pointing to a multi stakeholder website on the environment.\n\nMr Stewart stated that the two Sides have put forward cooperation proposals/trust building ideas, adding that he is in the process of talking to the Special Representative of President Tatar and Greek Cypriot Negotiator as to how to move forward.\n\nThe Head of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus acknowledged that this is the last End of Year Reception being attended by Mr Anastasiades. Mr Stewart ended his speech by wishing the Turkish Cypriot People and Greek Cypriot People a Happy New Year."
