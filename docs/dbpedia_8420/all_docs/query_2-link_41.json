        "text": "On April 25, 2019, President Xi Jinping met with President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nXi Jinping pointed out that China and Cyprus enjoy a long history and civilization, and have set an example of equal treatment and mutually beneficial cooperation between big and small countries in the international community. Under the new historical conditions, the two sides should continue to support each other's core interests and major concerns, expand bilateral cooperation areas and tap into the potential of people-to-people and cultural cooperation. Located at the hub of Europe, Asia and Africa, Cyprus is an important participant in joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese side is ready to deepen cooperation with the Cypriot side in various areas including port, maritime transportation and infrastructure construction and discuss exploring trilateral cooperation in the Mediterranean region. It is hoped that the Cypriot side can continue to play an active role in promoting the development of China-European Union (EU) relations.\n\nNicos Anastasiades said that the Cypriot side thanks the Chinese side for its long-term and valuable support, and will adhere to the one-China policy and actively participate in the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, in a bid to promote Eurasian connectivity and realize mutual benefit and win-win results. The Cypriot side will continue to be an important partner of China in the EU, and hopes the Chinese side can support the United Nations peacekeeping force in continuing operations in Cyprus.\n\nAfter the meeting, the two heads of state jointly witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents including that of jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nDing Xuexiang, Yang Jiechi, Wang Yi and He Lifeng attended the meeting."
