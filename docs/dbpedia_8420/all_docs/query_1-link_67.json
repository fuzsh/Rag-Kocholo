        "text": "Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades won reelection to second five-year term Sunday, promising to continue economic recovery and the island's reunification efforts.\n\nThe conservative Anastasiades beat his leftist challenger Stavros Malas 56 to 44 percent. The two also faced-off in the 2013 election.\n\n\"I will continue to be president for all Cypriots,\" Anastasiades told cheering supporters in Nicosia. \"Tonight, there are no winners of losers. There is only a Cyprus for all of us.\"\n\nMalas told his backers they can be disappointed, but said \"the battle\" does not begin or end with a single election. He said he telephoned Anastasiades and told him to \"take care of our Cyprus.\"\n\nAnastasiades is credited with helping the Greek Cypriot economy bounce back from a severe recession that required a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut there has been little progress in U.N.-sponsored reunification talks with the Turkish Cypriot north.\n\nAnastasiades promises to resist Turkish demands to keep a military presence on a reunified Cyprus and continue oil and gas exploration off the Greek Cypriot coast â€“ an enterprise that also angers Turkish Cypriots.\n\nCyprus has been split between a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since 1974, when Turkish forces invaded in response to a military coup aimed at unifying the entire island with Greece.\n\nOnly Turkey recognizes an independent northern Cyprus while the southern half enjoys international recognition and the economic benefits of EU membership."
