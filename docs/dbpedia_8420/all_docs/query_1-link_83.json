        "text": "President elect Nikos Christodoulides greets his supporters during his inauguration ceremony after being elected as a new President of Cyprus, in the capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Feb 12, 2023. (PHOTO / AP)\n\nNICOSIA - Former Cypriot foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides was elected president on Sunday in a runoff vote, promising a unity government tasked with breaking a deadlock in peace talks with estranged Turkish Cypriots.\n\nOfficial results showed Christodoulides, 49, taking 51.9 percent of the vote, compared with runoff rival Andreas Mavroyiannis, 66, who took 48.1 percent.\n\nChristodoulides ran as an independent with the backing of centrist and right-of-centre parties which typically take a hard line on solving the long-running division of Cyprus.\n\nHe broke ranks with his own party, the right-wing DISY, causing fissures in the dominant Cypriot political grouping which had backed its leader who was eliminated in the first knock-out race last weekend.\n\nNikos Christodoulides has frequently been in the public eye in the past decade, either as government spokesman or as foreign minister until early 2022\n\n\"I look you in the eyes and give you a promise - I will do everything to be worthy of your trust,\" Christodoulides told an indoor stadium in the capital Nicosia packed with cheering supporters and accompanied by his wife and four daughters.\n\n\"I will be president of all Cypriots,\" he said.\n\nALSO READ: Cyprus presidential election goes to runoff\n\nHeavy metal music from Joan Jett and Lenny Kravitz blared out of loudspeakers earlier.\n\nChristodoulides has frequently been in the public eye in the past decade, either as government spokesman or as foreign minister until early 2022, with the persona of a young, energetic politician offering fresh ideas.\n\nThe next president faces problems ranging from a deadlock in reunification talks with Turkish Cypriots on the ethnically divided island, and labor disputes amid runaway inflation, to the fallout from corruption scandals and a spike in migration that has left authorities coping with thousands of asylum applications.\n\nPresidential elections are held once every five years. Nicos Anastasiades, a conservative of the ruling DISY party, has been in power since 2013, having been re-elected in 2018. By law, he could not seek a third term. He was widely reported as having favored Christodoulides, causing discontent in DISY ranks.\n\nALSO READ: Cypriot diplomats face off in cliffhanger presidential vote\n\n\"This election symbolizes a continuity of the Nicos Anastasiades government,\" said Hubert Faustmann, a Professor of History and Political Science at the University of Nicosia.\n\nThe more than half-century partition of Cyprus loomed large over the campaign. The island has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion, triggered by a coup instigated by Greece's then-ruling military junta, though the seeds of division were sown earlier.\n\nThe last round of peace talks collapsed in disarray in mid 2017. Christodoulides says he wants to resume talks, but says a United Nations framework governing talks, issued in 2017, should be renegotiated.\n\nThere were hiccups along the way for Christodoulides. His inaugural appearance as a candidate last year went off-key after it came to light that his launch speech was very similar to one made by another presidential hopeful in 2008.\n\nALSO READ: Cyprus poll draws record 14 candidates, clear winner unlikely\n\nThe race was also marred by claims that Christodoulides was busy laying the groundwork for his campaign long before his departure from public office in January 2022.\n\nBut he was, as the opposition Cyprus Mail daily put it on Sunday, the \"Teflon candidate\" on whom - despite everything thrown at him - nothing stuck."
