        "text": "Leveraging his recent ascent to prominence as the preeminent emerging British celebrity, comedian Sid Field secured a leading role in London Town, a comedy/musical scheduled for Technicolor filming at Shepperton Studios in the fall of 1945. J. Arthur Rank was persuaded that a big, dazzling, million-dollar musical was just what the glamour-starved nation needed and desired. Rank brought in the American director Wesley Ruggles to oversee the musical, and at great expense, engaged songwriters Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke. It was a strange decision because Ruggles had no prior experience with the genre and his two most well-known films were more than ten years old: the Mae West comedy I’m No Angel and the Oscar-winning Western epic Cimarron.\n\nIn the screenplay, Sid Field’s character, comic Jerry Sanford, is essentially an understudy in a huge theatrical musical. Still, upon arriving in London, he thinks he has been cast as the lead. He eventually gets his big break because to his daughter Peggy (Petula Clark, who was just thirteen at the time), who destabilizes Charlie de Haven (Sonnie Hale), the revue’s star."
