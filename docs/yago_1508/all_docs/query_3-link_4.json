        "text": "I found Rex Harrison's memoir - \"A Damned Serious Business: My Life In Comedy\" in a special bookstore. It was published in 1991 shortly after his death in 1990 at age 82.\n\nI was surprised to see how many well known movies he made including Dr. Dolittle and My Fair Lady with Audrey Hepburn. His first love was the stage where he performed many plays including the famous Broadway play My Fair Lady costarring a newcomer named Julie Andrews.\n\nHe gave Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money and married 6 times! (But only producing 2 children out of all the unions).\n\nWhat is your take on Rex Harrison and his career?\n\nHe was horrible to Julie Andrews during the rehearsals of My fair lady, and referred to her as 'tyhat stupid cunt\" loudly so she could hear.\n\nTo be a little fair that's not as bad a word in the UK as it is in the US, and also everyone wasz extremely frustrated becausze 9in a bizarre reversal of the plot of the musical), Andrews simply could not learn how to speak with a Cockney accent, so drilled had she been in her youth in proper prounciation. Finally Moss Hart made her stay in the theater for him for two days on a weekend and told her he would either teach her how to do a proper Cockney accent, or she would have to be replaced--and she did it. So Harrison was really frustrated by her.\n\nEven so, he treated her so badly she was probably glad when she didn't get the movie role not to have to work with him again.\n\nCarole Landis committed suicide after Harrison refused to lave his wife for her; he has long been suspected of hiding details from the police about her death (including destroying a suicide note she left him).\n\nRachel Roberts also killed herself after her attempts to win back Harrison proved fruitless. She died in the same bizarre way that her character in the film \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" dies (a suicide attempt that succeeds because she's sliced to ribbons by falling through greenhouse glass).\n\nClearly Harrison had a predilection for troubled women, and his abusive behavior to other women (like Andrews) shows he probably had seriously damaged both women's self-esteem. But the death of Kay Kendall two years after they married was just bad luck--it had nothing to do with any sort of \"fatal way he had with women.\"\n\nDepending on your viewpoint Rex Harrison, along with Richard Burton, made a groundbreaking film in 1969 about an aging gay male couple called \"Staircase.\" It got mixed reviews with some being able to see through the seeming campy stereotypes to see 2 real gay men living their lives together in that particular era. It wasn't meant to be homophobic but rather a comedy/drama that sometimes got derailed by the seeming camp content. Not really a bad movie if you remember that this was done in1969, years before a more enlightened time, and it's a miracle that the gay themed movie got made in the first place with 2 big stars. Worth watching for a gay blast from the past.\n\n[quote]I once saw a video on Youtube of the first orchestra rehearsal for MFL on Bway. When he first heard the xylophone/glock in \"\"...Let a Woman in Your Life\" he exploded. He asked the conductor what the hell it was, he replied \"it's called orchestrations Mr. Harrison\".\n\nHarrison had already done MFL in London, so would be familiar with the orchestration.\n\nI do remember a video of Julie Andrews being rather diplomatic about how often Harrison would blow a gasket. I think he tried to get her fired.\n\n[quote]I once saw a video on Youtube of the first orchestra rehearsal for MFL on Bway. When he first heard the xylophone/glock in \"\"...Let a Woman in Your Life\" he exploded. He asked the conductor what the hell it was, he replied \"it's called orchestrations Mr. Harrison\". Rex then screamed, demanding that they be removed immediately. It was a telling glimpse of his personality. It must have been scrubbed as I haven't been able to find it since.\n\nOh fer pity's sake, that film is a TOTAL set-up , and it has not been \"scrubbed\" from YouTube. Here it is. One would think the fact that word \"rehearsal\" is in quotes in the title might have cued you in that it isn't real documentary footage, plus the fact that the video is from 1960, and is also clearly labeled as a \"recreation\" of the first rehearsal of MFL. Amazing that you and some others (as per the comments on YouTube) actually don't get it.\n\nThat said, from all accounts, Harrison was very badly behaved during MFL rehearsals, apparently referring to Julie Andrews as a \"bitch\" and to Moss Hart as \"that Jewish cunt.\" Horrible man.\n\nWhen young, I mixed him up all the time with Noel Coward. They did both had that posh old queen way of speaking a little too loudly and and enunciating a little too obviously, and seemed always to be speaking to an audience, to the last row in the theatre, sharing their amusing anecdotes (which might have been more amusing if they hadn't warned us they would be so.)\n\nCoward was the more interesting man, even if he turned out mediocre work, and Harrison made everything mediocre sound like it might be more important than it is. Harrison seemed like a dickhead and usually made whatever character he was playing into a dickhead, the same dickhead as the last one he playedâ€”and the next, too.\n\nRex Harrison was a BIG ham who truly believed he was the only attraction in any play or film he appeared in.....\n\nRachel Roberts timed her LA suicide to coincide with the opening of the MFL revival with Rex that was in LA.......unfortunately for her - her body wasn't discovered until the Monday after the opening.....\n\nTiming is everything, Rachel.\n\nI do like the story of the out of town tryout of MFL in Connecticut, I think. It was snowing and the audience was small in number but got there at risk of life and limb. Rex refused to go on - the theatre manager told him if he didn't go on that he would announce to the audience exactly WHO was causing the trouble.\n\nRex went on.....and when the chandeliers for the ballroom scene were lowered in place - they were dropped a bit too low. When they were adjusted - they took Rex's toupee with them......\n\nWooden tit be loverly, indeed.\n\nHe was nice to me and I was rude to him. If I had known how miserable he could be I would never have done what I did. Excuse: I was very young. Waited at the stage door after The Kingfisher on Broadway(also with Colbert.) I had brought the film souvenir book of My Fair Lady for him to sign. He quickly came out of the stage door and went into his limousine without acknowledging me at all. So I did what I needed to do. His window was open and I shoved the program in front of his face in a here sign this motion. Instead of calling me a cunt(which I certainly was being) a broad smile came over his face as if he hadn't seen it in quite a while(didn't he have stacks of these all over his house?) and he started looking through it. He then signed it and handed it back to me.\n\nI strongly recommend the 50th anniversary edition of the bluray(not the first one) done by film restorer Robert Harris. It is spectacular. Watch it on as large a screen as possible and revel in the textures of the fabrics of Beaton's beautiful costumes.\n\nR85 Op here. Hello - you're very observant. I often put stars around my caption of a thread, especially an actor's name, to make it stand out more and get more attention. I guess the reason I gave Diana Rigg more stars than Rex Harrison is because I'm more familiar with her and like her better. And lo and behold, here is a photo of them together in an acting engagement. I also did a recent thread on Michael York - I guess I love those English actors for some reason. Hope you enjoyed the threads!\n\nThe photo of Harrison with Rigg is from the London production of Heartbreak House, which I saw and was marvelous.\n\nHarrison later did the play on Broadway with a different director (Anthony Page; John Dexter had done the London production) and a different cast, with one exception: Rosemary Harris. However Harris played the older sister, Lady Utterword, in London but played the younger sister Hesione (Rigg's role in London) on Broadway.\n\nI didn't see the Broadway production, but I doubt it was better. Dexter was a nasty piece of work sometimes but he was a fine director most of the time. Page was very uneven.\n\n[quote]When young, I mixed him up all the time with Noel Coward. They did both had that posh old queen way of speaking a little too loudly and and enunciating a little too obviously, and seemed always to be speaking to an audience, to the last row in the theatre, sharing their amusing anecdotes (which might have been more amusing if they hadn't warned us they would be so.)\n\nNoel Coward's way of speaking was very, very different from Rex Harrison's. The only thing their speech had in common was that both had what could be broadly classified as upper-class British accents.\n\n[quote]He couldn't sing.\n\nHarrison actually had a lovely, light tenor singing voice, and he had sung full-out in one or two movies long before MY FAIR LADY. You don't know what you're talking about.\n\nI just watched Doctor Dolittle a few nights ago on a sparkling Blu-ray transfer. I had seen it as a child and barely remembered what it was about and now I know why. It's slow and Harrison has a hard time hiding the prick he was but some of the songs hold some charm for me, especially When I Look in Her Eyes. Samantha Eggar looks gorgeous even if she didn't have that \"it\" thing and Newley is at least better than he was playing Heironymus Merkin.\n\nLilli Palmer (neÃ© Peiser) was a tough cookie. She used Harrison as a stepping stone to Hollywood.\n\nShe got experience handling men when she worked as a professional taxi-dancer.\n\nI always think her steely German off-screen persona seem to dominate over any empathic ability she tried to use when playing a fictional character on screen. Noel Coward, the director of her last stage production was exasperated that she spent more time polishing her appearance than learning the script.\n\nThough you make me think I must re-view two of her more interesting films. 'Oedipus' (1966) where sheâ€™s obliged to fornicate with her son (Christopher Plummer) and that quite confusingly frigid film called â€˜Beware of Pityâ€™ (1946).\n\n'Beware of Pity' was by the morbid Stefan Zweig.\n\nHe said 'there are two kinds of pity. One, the weak-minded, sentimental sort is really just the heartâ€™s impatience to rid itself as quickly as possible of the painful experience of being moved by another personâ€™s suffering. It is not a case of real sympathy, of feeling with the sufferer, but a way of defending yourself against the suffererâ€™s pain.\n\nThe other kind, the only one that counts, is unsentimental but creative. It knows its own mind, and is determined to stand by the sufferer, patiently suffering too to the last of its strength and even beyond. Only when you go all the way to the end, the bitter end, only when you have that patience, can you really help people.'\n\n[quote]M Blakemore claimed Plummer had a percentage on SOM and made a fortune off of it but I'm surprised he got that. I thought that even Andrews got a flat fee of something of 200K. Anybody know what their original salaries were and if they got a percentage?\n\nI don't remember the details or numbers, but I know Andrews has said she made far more money off of the phenomenal sales of the soundtrack recording of THE SOUND OF MUSIC than she did from her salary for the film itself, because she had royalties for one but not points for the other. I wonder if Plummer got any royalties from the album, since his voice is not actually heard on it.\n\nLilli Palmer was Rex Harrison's second wife and bore him his second and last son during World War II. She was of Jewish descent and left Germany when Hitler began to rise to power with his anti-Jewish political movement. She was a very ambitious person and more than happy to accompany Rex Harrison to Hollywood and stake her claim there. When Rex fell in love with Kay Kendall and wanted to marry and take care of her because she was ill he asked Lilli for a divorce - and she said yes. She had already fallen in love with someone else and taken a lover on the side. When Kay Kendall died Rex had planned to marry Lilli again but she had remarried and stayed with her second husband until her death, whereas Rex married 3 more times. It was like a Hollywood soap opera.\n\nI thought the dialogue in 'Staircase' was tremendously witty when I saw it years ago as a gayling. Now the whole thing seems pathetic.\n\nPathetic in that the 2 characters were pathetic. Pathetic in that Gladys Cooper and Cathleen Nesbitt were shown in a horrible state of geriatric helplessness. Pathetic in that Burton's wig looks so fake when in fact it was Rex who had been wearing excellent wigs for the last decade. And pathetic that the Anglophile/Francophile Stanley Donen who showed so much promise in Hollywood musicals had abandoned the US for England during the Swinging Sixties but his career was grinding back downwards into a string of second-rate failures.\n\nR158 Well, I have re-watched The Honey Pot to find out why it was such a mess.\n\nFirst Problem. The producer Charles K Feldman was making big money with frothy, star-filled sex comedies such as â€˜What's New Pussycat. He also owned that woman named Capucine; he pushed her into 12 projects wanting her to be Another-Audrey-Hepburn.\n\nSecond Problem. The script doesnâ€™t know if itâ€™s a frothy comedy or a murder drama. One of the four writers was an Englishman who wrote â€˜Dial M for Murderâ€™.\n\nThird Problem. The director Joseph L. Mankiewicz couldn't stop himself from rewriting it so we have four different writers messing up the thing. Mankiewicz had already done one movie with Susan Hayward and three with Rex Harrison\n\nFourth Problem. Mankiewicz loves to talk and it's tedious listening to all this chatter claustrophobic studio set in a fake terraced garden.\n\nFifth Problem. The cast was supposed to include Anne Bancroft to play the third woman but for some reason she doesn't appear and she was replaced by a non-entity who I won't bother to mention.\n\nBiggest Problem. Maggie Smith and Rex Harrison have some chance to shine with some accomplished, nuanced light comedy banter. But the biggest problem arises when Rex Harrison is killed off and the movie switches from comedy to drama. Itâ€™s dominated by the hopeless person called Cliff Robertson who speaks like a robot. Completely without expression or charm.\n\nIt is a mess!\n\n[quote] Rex went on.....and when the chandeliers for the ballroom scene were lowered in place - they were dropped a bit too low. When they were adjusted - they took Rex's toupee with them......\n\nThis story was told by Alan Jay Lerner in his autobiography ON THE STREET WHERE I LIVE. I'm not sure it's true.\n\nIf a heavy piece of scenery landed on an actor's head it would probably send him crashing to the ground. Didn't that happen to Ann Miller, who later claimed her lacquered hairdo saved her life?\n\nHart threatened Harrison before the Drury Lane London MFL opening with being fired because Rex wouldn't come to all the rehearsals. I assume Hart would have too because Harrison fell in line and came to all required of him. I believe there was talk of Gielgud, Coward or Olivier replacing him. Pretty daring of Moss to risk losing him but I guess at that point MFL was practically a legend and he felt he didn't have to have him.\n\nHarrison was 3rd choice for the movie. If Hepburn had refused the movie I wonder who would have gotten it. Warner was definitely not going to give it to Andrews.\n\nAs long as we're telling MY FAIR LADY stories, Mary Martin was originally considered for Eliza Doolittle. Aside from her Texas twang, she was too old at 43, but she was a big name (and her being too old didn't seem to matter in THE SOUND OF MUSIC three years later).\n\nLerner and Loewe played some of their songs for Martin and her (gay) husband Richard Halliday in their home. The Hallidays politely thanked them and they left. As the story goes, Martin turned to her husband and said 'Those poor boys have lost their talentâ€™ .\n\nAs for who could've played Higgins on Broadway, how about Alfred Lunt? He was certainly well known at the time, and had done a radio broadcast of PYGMALION with his wife Lynn Fontanne earlier in the decade. But maybe like Roz Russell, he wasn't interested in yesterday's stew.\n\nBesides Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor (!) was considered for Eliza; also Deanna Durbin was possibly approached for a comeback (she was asked to be in the original on Broadway as well), plus musical ladies like Shirley Jones and Jane Powell could have done it. Warner didn't want Julie Andrews. Maybe that's why she didn't do \"Camelot\" (also a Warner picture) after she was a big movie star?\n\nRex did a lot of theater in the 1970s and 1980s in NY. I saw him in the \"My Fair Lady\" revival, \"Aren't We All\" with Claudette Colbert, but really the leads were the wonderful Lynn Redgrave and Jeremy Brett, plus saw Rex in \"The Circle\" with Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger, and in \"Heartbreak House\" with an excellent Amy Irving and Philip Bosco. Rex was a wonderful actor, but apparently not a nice man off-stage.\n\nHe indeed was displeased with Julie Andrews during rehearsals of \"My Fair Lady\", but then again, she was having a hard time, not just with the Cockney dialect, but with the acting in general. She hadn't done much beside music hall and \"The Boy Friend\", and though she was doing great with the songs in \"My Fair Lady\", she was on the verge of being fired. So Moss Hart shut down cast rehearsals for a weekend and basically deconstructed and reconstructed Andrews and drummed into her the role of Eliza. Apparently when she returned, she became \"the Julie Andrews\" much improved and even Harrison immediately saw the difference. Harrison was not nice to Tony Newley when they made \"Dr. Dolittle\"; he was jealous that Newley had a great singing voice and made some anti-Semitic comments about Newley apparently. That film did have a terrible time getting filmed, with really bad weather, lots of animals, Rachel Roberts acting crazy around the set, and other problems, and Harrison wasn't the nicest guy to begin with....\n\nNo, R249, I donâ€™t consider \"Midnight Lace\" as a serious drama.\n\nIâ€™d call it a melodrama. A melodrama designed for womenâ€”with Doris getting the chance to display a different expensive gown in every scene and Rex and all the other characters reduced to one-dimensional cyphers.\n\nThe â€˜Timeâ€™ critic said Doris is the â€œall-American missusâ€¦wearing a lot of expensive clothes, and â€¦ behaves like such a silly, spoiled, hysterical, middle-aged Lolita that many customers may find themselves less in sympathy with her plight than with the villain's murderous intentions.\n\nMidnight Lace (unlike some of The Man Who Knew Too Much) wasn't shot on location. It has lots of well known English actors, but they seem fake-English. It's supposed to be London in 1959-60 but seems more like it's trying to recreate MGM England from the 40s. Very Ross Hunter. Most of the great Ross Hunter dramatic pictures always had something in common - directed by Douglas Sirk. This one isn't, and Sirk retired in 1959.\n\nHarrison was mainly a great comedian, but he could do drama effectively. Cleopatra, and The Agony And The Ecstacy come to mind.\n\n[quote]And Yul Brynner had enough Mongol ancestry to be visible in his face and to color his sensibilities, Miss Know Nothin at [R267].\n\n\"Color his sensibilities\" lol What the fuck is that? He was a Russian with a fraction of vague Mongol ancestry, but I'm not sure why that qualifies him to play a Thai person. I'm talking about acting ability, jackass. Harrison gave a better performance. His personal life is (or should be) irrelevant to a discussion of his acting. There are a lot of film and music stars today whose antics would make Rex look like Shirley Temple, but go off.\n\n[quote] Anna And The King Of Siam\n\nI forced myself to watch this movie last night and I'm reminded of the statement at R95 that 'he was an excellent performer within a limited range'.\n\nPlaying Siamese is beyond his range. He had voice coaching but â€”as he said in his memoirâ€” heâ€™s two foot too tall for the role. I happen to have met a few people from that country and their overriding characteristic is their smallness.\n\nIt seems James Mason was the first choice for the role and I think he might have been able to get away with it. James Mason had a kind of feline beauty and he had that odd Oxford/Yorkshire odd speaking voice. He was also four inches shorter than Rex Harrison.\n\nI can understand why 20th century Fox was embarrassed by this when they made their third version of this story in 1999."
