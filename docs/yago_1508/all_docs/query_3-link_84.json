        "text": "The Australian entertainment industry received an unexpected fillip of glamour and pizzazz when the British actress Googie Withers moved here permanently in 1959. She was 42, a mother of two, with a third not far away, and 25 years of British stage and film work behind her.\n\nFilm stars and West End marquee names just did not leave for the other side of the world in the days before the jet engine shrank the globe. Withers’s step into the relative unknown was to make the Australian theatre, film and television industries all the better for her brave decision.\n\nShe was dubbed ‘‘the best bad girl in British films’’ thanks to her ability to portray women of a haughty sexuality. She left home to accompany her husband, the Australian actor John McCallum, who had been appointed managing director of the theatrical firm J.C. Williamsons.\n\nBy then the pair were already darlings of the Australian theatre-going public.\n\nActor husband and wife teams were a post Second World War money tree, with audiences around the British Empire eagerly lining up to see the likes of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer appear in their West End and Broadway hits.\n\nWithers and McCallum had toured Australia in 1955 with a two-part production: The Deep Blue Sea, a drama about a woman trying to hang on to an unreliable lover and the comedy Simon and Laura, as idealised television stars whose home life is less idyllic. The British film version of the comedy starred another Australian, Peter Finch and Kay Kendall.\n\nIn a 2007 ABC interview, Withers said she had no problem moving to Australia. ‘‘Most people said to me, ‘What do you want to go to Australia for? What work is there for you?’ I said, ‘Plenty.’ And there was never any problem at all about work here. Never. Especially as John was heading one of the biggest companies in the world! I thought, ‘He better give me a job’.’’\n\nBorn Georgette Lizette Withers in Karachi at the height of the British Raj, her father was a commander in the Royal Indian Navy, an Anglo-Irishman, her mother of Dutch, German and French extraction.\n\nHer christian name was a source of endless publicity during her ingenue days: her Bengali nurse nicknamed her ‘‘Googie’’. For years it was thought the nurse called her ‘‘Clown’’ until somebody told the actress it meant ‘‘Dove’’ in Punjabi and ‘‘turn in the road’’ in Tamil. By the time McCallum told her it was Australian slang for ‘‘Egg’’ she was beyond caring.\n\nThe family left Karachi when she was eight and while her father floundered in an attempt to run a foundry after leaving the navy, she was sent to boarding school, and, according to a 1948 BBC press release, given dancing lessons, in her parents’ belief that bandy legs would be straightened by acrobatics.\n\nAt 12, Withers made her professional debut at London’s Victoria Palace in The Windmill Man. A fall during dancing class permanently weakened an arm and demanded a less arduous dance form, so she started cabaret at the Mayfair hotel and the Kit Kat Club. At 16 she was the youngest chorine in Nice Goings On. She was dancing in a West End show when a film talent scout spotted her and offered a contract. She made The Love Test (1934) with Louis Hayward and All at Sea (1935) with Rex Harrison.\n\nWithers was to appear in more than 60 films and television productions, including some of the finest British movies of her time: One of Our Aircraft is Missing (1942),They Came to a City (1944, from the JB Priestley novel); Miranda (1948), in which Glynis Johns played the mermaid and Withers the all-too-normal woman; and Jules Dassin’s Night and the City (1950), with Richard Widmark.\n\nShe supported Dolores Del Rio in Accused (1936), was with Ann Todd in Action for Slander (1937), and in Paradise for Two (1937) with Patricia Ellis, Kate Plus Ten (1938) with Genevieve Tobin, She Couldn’t Say No (1940) with Greta Gynt, Busman’s Honeymoon (1940) with Constance Cummings, and On Approval (1944) with Bea Lillie.\n\nThe grim It Always Rains On Sunday (1947) is regarded by some as one the best British films. In the Ealing Studios drama, Withers’s disdainful immorality was perfect pitch for the bored wife sheltering an ex-lover, now a murderer on the run, played by McCallum. The lovers were shown so unsympathetically it might have been a French film noir. She had met McCallum the year before when they appeared in the film The Loves of Joanna Godden.\n\nTheir marriage, in January 1948, was not unlike an Ealing romance, taking place at London high society’s marriage hot spot, St George’s in Hanover Square.\n\nChildren arrived, daughters, Joanna and Amanda, and a son, Nicholas. Television then started to erode film, and Withers began alternating between stage productions in southern and northern hemispheres, including Broadway. Then came McCallum’s JCW offer.\n\nWithers would later joke that antipodean visits resulted in the birth of two children, but even before she moved permanently she displayed a mischievous understanding of the path ahead.\n\n‘‘John tells me that in the little Queensland town where he was born ... if you stand at the street corner for more than a few seconds, someone comes along and leans on you,’’ she told a journalist with the now defunct Truth newspaper.\n\nWithers continued to play in adventurous work in Britain, including Ionesco’s Exit the King and a production of Somerset Maugham’s The Circle toured the UK and Canada. Her 1979 turn as Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest stepped out of Edith Evans’s high-camp shadow without losing impact.\n\nIn 1971 she starred in Nickel Queen, a film produced and directed by McCallum and set in the heady days of the Poseidon nickel boom. Its main success was in Western Australia. Rude British reviewers thought it made Barry Humphries’s opus the following year The Adventures of Barry McKenzie look like a refreshing can of beer.\n\nIn the 1970s, Withers’s high security women’s prison television series Within These Walls reminded the English she was still around. Not the people who make Coronation Street though. They had to apologise in 2004 after a character dropped the clanger: ‘‘Googie Withers would turn in her grave’’.\n\nTwo films awaited: Country Life (1994), directed by Michael Blakemore, was a version of Uncle Vanya set in 1919 Australia, showing what was on the collective newly federated mind as Chekhov had shown what was on the minds of a fading Russian social class; Shine (1996) was based on the career of the Australian pianist David Helfgott, and Withers played the writer Katharine Susannah Prichard, who helped Helfgott realise his ambition.\n\nAt 85 she appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in a West End production of Lady Windermere’s Fan.\n\nIn 1980 she was appointed AO, and in 2001 CBE. Her husband died last year, and she is survived by her children."
