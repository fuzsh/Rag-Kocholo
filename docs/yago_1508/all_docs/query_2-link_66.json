        "text": "The Reluctant Debutante is refreshing and prettily dressed, a colorful, saucy film version of the William Douglas Home stage trifle.\n\nDebutante is the story of London’s social ‘season’, a time when bright and not-too-bright 17-year-olds make their debuts in society, carrying on at one deb’s ball after another. Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall, as newly married on screen as off, invite his American daughter (by a former marriage) for a British visit that results in the girl’s coming out socially.\n\nAs played by Sandra Dee, the teenager is bored with English stiffs but falls madly for an American drummer (John Saxon) who’s tabbed with a most dubious reputation. Mixed-up telephone calls, embarrassing situations and advances – both wanted and unwanted – follow with rapidity.\n\nHarrison is suavely disturbed as the father. Dee proves a rather good actress who maintains a lively character throughout, and Saxon lends a fine boyish charm to the proceedings. But it’s really Kendall’s picture, and she grabs it with a single wink. She’s flighty and well-meaning, snobbish and lovable."
