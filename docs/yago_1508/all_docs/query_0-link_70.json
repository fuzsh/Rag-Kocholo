        "text": "Sir Reginald Carey \"Rex\" Harrison (5 March 1908 – 2 June 1990) was an English actor of stage and screen. Harrison began his career on the stage in 1924. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. He won his first Tony Award for his performance as Henry VIII in the play Anne of the Thousand Days in 1949. He won his second Tony for the role of Professor Henry Higgins in the stage production of My Fair Lady in 1957. He reprised the role for the 1964 film version, which earned him both a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn addition to his stage career, Harrison also appeared in numerous films, including Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), Cleopatra (1963), and played the title role of the English doctor who talks to animals, Doctor Dolittle (1967). In July 1989, Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1975, Harrison released his first autobiography. His second, A Damned Serious Business: My Life in Comedy, was published posthumously in 1991. Harrison was married six times and had two sons: Noel and Carey Harrison. He continued working in stage productions until shortly before his death from pancreatic cancer in June 1990 at the age of 82.\n\nYouth and stage career[]\n\nHarrison was born at Derry House in Huyton, Lancashire,[1] the son of Edith Mary (née Carey) and William Reginald Harrison, a cotton broker.[2] He was educated at Liverpool College.[3] After a bout of childhood measles, Harrison lost most of the sight in his left eye, which on one occasion caused some on-stage difficulty.[4] He first appeared on the stage in 1924 in Liverpool. Harrison's acting career was interrupted during World War II while serving in the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant.[5] He acted in various stage productions until 11 May 1990. He acted in the West End of London when he was young, appearing in the Terence Rattigan play French Without Tears, which proved to be his breakthrough role.\n\nHe alternated appearances in London and New York in such plays as Bell, Book and Candle (1950), Venus Observed, The Cocktail Party, The Kingfisher and The Love of Four Colonels, which he also directed.[6] He won his first Tony Award for his appearance at the Shubert Theatre as Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson's play Anne of the Thousand Days and international superstardom (and a second Tony) for his portrayal of Henry Higgins in the musical My Fair Lady, where he appeared opposite Julie Andrews.\n\nLater appearances included Pirandello's Henry IV, a 1984 appearance at the Haymarket Theatre with Claudette Colbert in Frederick Lonsdale's Aren't We All?, and one on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre presented by Douglas Urbanski, at the Haymarket in J. M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton with Edward Fox. He returned as Henry Higgins in the revival of My Fair Lady directed by Patrick Garland in 1981, cementing his association with the plays of George Bernard Shaw, which included a Tony nominated performance as Shotover in Heartbreak House, Julius Caesar in Caesar and Cleopatra, and General Burgoyne in a Los Angeles production of The Devil's Disciple.\n\nIn film[]\n\nHarrison's film debut was in The Great Game (1930), other notable early films include The Citadel (1938), Night Train to Munich (1940), Major Barbara (1941), Blithe Spirit (1945), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), and The Foxes of Harrow (1947). He was best known for his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in the 1964 film version of My Fair Lady, based on the eponymous Broadway production (which in turn was based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion), for which Harrison won a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nHe also starred in 1967's Doctor Dolittle. At the height of his box office clout after the success of My Fair Lady, Harrison proved a domineering and demanding force during production, demanding auditions for prospective composers after musical playwright Leslie Bricusse was contracted[7] and demanding to have his singing recorded live during shooting, only to agree to have it rerecorded in post-production.[8] He also disrupted production with incidents with his wife, Rachel Roberts and deliberate misbehaviour, such as when he deliberately moved his yacht in front of cameras during shooting in St. Lucia and refused to move it out of sight due to contract disputes.[9] Harrison was at one point temporarily replaced by Christopher Plummer, until he agreed to be more cooperative.[10]\n\nHe starred in the 1968 comedy The Honey Pot, a modern adaptation of Ben Jonson's play Volpone. Two of his co-stars, Maggie Smith and Cliff Robertson, were to become lifelong friends. Both spoke at his New York City memorial at the Little Church Around the Corner when Harrison died in 1990.\n\nHarrison was not by any objective standards a singer (his talking on pitch style he used in My Fair Lady would be adopted by many other classically trained actors with limited vocal ranges); the music was usually written to allow for long periods of recitative, or \"speaking to the music\". Nevertheless, \"Talk to the Animals\", which Harrison performed in that film, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1967.\n\nDespite excelling in comedy (Noël Coward described him as \"The best light comedy actor in the world—except for me.\"),[11] he attracted favourable notices in dramatic roles such as his portrayal of Julius Caesar in Cleopatra (1963) and as Pope Julius II in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), opposite Charlton Heston as Michelangelo. He also acted in a Hindi film Shalimar alongside Indian Bollywood star Dharmendra as well as appearing as an ageing homosexual man opposite Richard Burton as his lover in Staircase (1969).[12]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nHarrison was married six times. In 1942, he divorced his first wife, Colette Thomas, and married actress Lilli Palmer the next year; they later appeared together in numerous plays and films, including The Four Poster.[13]\n\nIn 1947, while married to Palmer, Harrison began an affair with actress Carole Landis. Landis committed suicide in 1948 after spending the evening with Harrison.[14] Harrison's involvement in the scandal by waiting several hours before calling a doctor and police[15] briefly damaged his career and his contract with Fox was ended by mutual consent.[16] Harrison and Palmer divorced in 1957.\n\nIn 1957, Harrison married the actress Kay Kendall. Kendall died of myeloid leukaemiadisambiguation needed in 1959.[17] Terence Rattigan's 1973 play In Praise of Love was written about the end of this marriage, and Harrison appeared in the New York production playing the character based on himself. Rattigan was said to be \"intensely disappointed and frustrated\" by Harrison's performance, as \"Harrison refused to play the outwardly boorish parts of the character and instead played him as charming throughout, signalling to the audience from the start that he knew the truth about [the] illness.\"[18] Critics however were quite pleased with the performance and although it did not have a long run, it was yet another of Harrison's well-plotted naturalistic performances.\n\nHe was subsequently married to Welsh-born actress Rachel Roberts from 1962 to 1971. In 1980, despite his having married twice since their divorce, Roberts made a final attempt to win Harrison back, which proved to be futile; she committed suicide that same year.[19]\n\nHarrison then married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, divorcing in 1975, and finally in 1978, Mercia Tinker, who would become his sixth and final wife.[20] Harrison's eldest son Noel Harrison became an olympic skier, singer and occasional actor; he toured in several productions including My Fair Lady in his father's award-winning role. Noel died suddenly of a heart attack on 19 October 2013 at age 79. Rex's younger son Carey Harrison is a playwright and social activist.\n\nHarrison's sister Sylvia was married to David Maxwell Fyfe, a lawyer, Conservative politician and judge who was successively the lead British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Home Secretary and Lord Chancellor (head of the English judiciary); after his death she married another Cabinet minister, Lord de la Warr.\n\nChronology of Harrison's six marriages:\n\nColette Thomas, 1934–1942 (divorced); one son, the actor/singer Noel Harrison, (29 January 1934 – 19 October 2013)\n\nLilli Palmer, 1943–1957 (divorced); one son, the novelist/playwright Carey Harrison\n\nKay Kendall, 1957–1959 (her death)\n\nRachel Roberts, 1962–1971 (divorced)\n\nElizabeth Harris, 1971–1975 (divorced); three stepsons, Damian Harris, Jared Harris, and Jamie Harris\n\nMercia Tinker, 1978–1990 (his death)\n\nGrandchildren:\n\nGranddaughters: Cathryn, Harriott, Chloe, Chiara, Rosie, Faith\n\nGrandsons: Will, Simon, Sam\n\nHarrison owned properties in London, New York City and Portofino, Italy. His villa in Portofino was named San Genesio after the patron saint of actors.[citation needed]\n\nLater career and death[]\n\nHaving retired from films after A Time to Die, Harrison continued to act on Broadway and the West End until the end of his life, despite suffering from glaucoma, painful teeth, and a failing memory.[21] He was nominated for a third Tony Award in 1984 for his performance as Captain Shotover in the revival of George Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House. He followed with two successful pairings with Claudette Colbert, The Kingfisher in 1985 and Aren't We All? in 1986. In 1989, he appeared with Edward Fox in The Admirable Crichton in London. In 1989/90, he appeared on Broadway in The Circle by W. Somerset Maugham, opposite Glynis Johns, Stewart Granger, and Roma Downey.[22] The production opened at Duke University for a three-week run followed by performances in Baltimore and Boston before opening 14 November 1989 on Broadway.[23][24]\n\nHarrison died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Manhattan on 2 June 1990 at the age of 82. He had only been diagnosed with the disease for a short time. The stage production in which he was appearing at the time, The Circle, came to an end upon his death.[25]\n\nHe was cremated and some of his ashes were scattered in Portofino and the rest were scattered at his second wife Lilli Palmer's grave at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in the Commemoration section, Map 1, Lot 4066, Space 2.[26][27]\n\nHarrison's second autobiography, A Damned Serious Business: My Life in Comedy (ISBN 0553073419), was published posthumously in 1991.\n\nHonours and legacy[]\n\nOn 25 July 1989, Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace as an orchestra played the music of songs from My Fair Lady.[citation needed]\n\nRex Harrison has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one at 6906 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to films, and the other at 6380 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to television. Harrison is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame. He was inducted in 1979.[28]\n\nDue to his association with the checked wool hat, which he wore both in the Broadway and film versions of My Fair Lady, that the style of headware was often named \"The Rex Harrison.\"[citation needed]\n\nSeth MacFarlane, creator of the animated series Family Guy, modelled the voice of the character Stewie Griffin after Harrison, after seeing him in the film adaptation of My Fair Lady.[29][30]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1930 The Great Game George The School for Scandal Bit Part Uncredited 1934 Get Your Man Tom Jakes Leave It to Blanche Ronnie 1935 All at Sea Aubrey Bellingham 1936 Men Are Not Gods Tommy Stapleton 1937 Storm in a Teacup Frank Burdon School for Husbands Leonard Drummond 1938 Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane Harley Prentiss The Citadel Dr. Frederick Lawford 1939 Over the Moon Dr. Freddie Jarvis The Silent Battle Jacques Sauvin 1940 Ten Days in Paris Bob Stevens Night Train to Munich Gus Bennett 1941 Major Barbara Adolphus Cusins 1945 Blithe Spirit Charles Condomine I Live in Grosvenor Square Major David Bruce Journey Together Guest Uncredited The Rake's Progress Vivian Kenway 1946 Anna and the King of Siam King Mongkut Nominated – New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor 1947 The Ghost and Mrs. Muir Captain Daniel Gregg The Foxes of Harrow Stephen Fox 1948 Escape Matt Denant Unfaithfully Yours Sir Alfred De Carter 1951 The Long Dark Hall Arthur Groome 1952 The Four Poster John Edwards 1953 Main Street to Broadway Himself 1954 King Richard and the Crusaders Emir Hderim Sultan Saladin 1955 The Constant Husband William Egerton 1958 The Reluctant Debutante Jimmy Broadbent 1960 Midnight Lace Anthony \"Tony\" Preston 1961 The Happy Thieves Jimmy Bourne 1963 Cleopatra Julius Caesar National Board of Review Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama\n\nNominated – Laurel Award for Top Male Dramatic Performance 1964 My Fair Lady Professor Henry Higgins Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nDavid di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor\n\nGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\n\nLaurel Award for Top Male Musical Performance\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role The Yellow Rolls-Royce Lord Charles Frinton – The Marquess of Frinton 1965 The Agony and the Ecstasy Pope Julius II Nominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama\n\nNominated – Laurel Award for Top Male Dramatic Performance 1967 The Honey Pot Cecil Sheridan Fox Doctor Dolittle Dr. John Dolittle Nominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy 1968 A Flea in Her Ear Victor Chandebisse / Poche 1969 Staircase Charles Dyer 1977 Crossed Swords The Duke of Norfolk 1978 Shalimar Sir John Locksley 1979 Ashanti Brian Walker The Fifth Musketeer Colbert 1982 A Time to Die Van Osten\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1952 Omnibus Henry VIII episode: The Trial of Anne Boleyn 1953 The United States Steel Hour Raymond Dabney episode: The Man in Possession 1957 DuPont Show of the Month Mr. Sir episode: Crescendo 1960 Dow Hour of Great Mysteries Cyril Paxton episode: The Dachet Diamonds 1971–1973 Play of the Month Mikhail Platonov, schoolmaster\n\nDon Quixote 2 episodes 1983 The Kingfisher Cecil TV film 1985 Heartbreak House Captain Shotover TV film 1986 Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna Grand Duke Cyril Romanov TV film, (final film role)\n\nRadio Year Title Role Notes 1952 Philip Morris Playhouse episode: The Gioconda Smile[31] 1952 Theatre Guild on the Air episode: An Ideal Husband[32]\n\nStage roles[]\n\nDate[33] Production Role Notes 4–25 March 1936 Sweet Aloes Tubbs Barrow 8 December 1948 – 8 October 1949 Anne of the Thousand Days Henry Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play 14 November 1950 – 2 June 1951 Bell, Book and Candle Shepherd Henderson 13 February – 26 April 1952 Venus Observed Hereward 15 January – 16 May 1953 The Love of Four Colonels The Man 15 March 1956 – 29 September 1962 My Fair Lady Henry Higgins Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical 8 December 1959 – 20 February 1960 The Fighting Cock The General 28 March – 28 April 1973 The Living Mask Henry IV 10 December 1974 – 31 May 1975 In Praise of Love Sebastian Cruttwell 1976 Monsieur Perichon's Travels Eugène Labiche & Edouard Martin 24 February – 5 March 1977 Caesar and Cleopatra Julius Caesar 6 December 1978 – 13 May 1979 The Kingfisher Cecil 18 August – 29 November 1981 My Fair Lady Henry Higgins 7 December 1983 – 5 February 1984 Heartbreak House Captain Shotover Nominated – Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play\n\nNominated – Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play 29 April – 21 July 1985 Aren't We All?
