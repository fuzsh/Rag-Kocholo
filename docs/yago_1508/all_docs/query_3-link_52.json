        "text": "The same director’s grace that allowed Spencer Tracy shine in 1950’s Father of the Bride was conjured again by Vincente Minnelli eight years later for The Reluctant Debutante, this time in the service of British star Rex Harrison, an actor who could convey charm and class while being silly like no one else. Charm, class and silliness, not coincidentally, are about all Minnelli seems to have been interested in with this dreamy, easygoing filmed play.\n\nThe story is a simple bit of fluff about an American girl (half-British in the film’s reality, but that’s just so that Sandra Dee could play her without changing the English setting), Jane, arriving in London to stay with her wealthy banker father (Harrison) and his new wife Sheila (Kay Kendall, Harrison’s actual wife at the time). Jane is forced by Sheila to take part in aristocratic London’s “debutante season”, in which young girls are paraded around at lavish balls and coaxed into dancing with eligible bachelors, in hopes that they’ll be married off. She has little interest in the cartoonishly dippy David Fenner (Peter Myers), a boy with the kind of pedigree she’s supposed to be attracted to, but takes an immediate shine to David Parkson (John Saxon), an impossibly handsome and suave young man who has the apparent misfortune of being a lowly jazz drummer hired to play the debutante balls, ostensibly putting him out of the running to be Jane’s mate. When the two fall in love anyway, the real action of the story, which revolves around the pratfalling machinations of Harrison and Kendall to marry Jane off to the right boy, kicks in.\n\nThere is zero doubt from the get-go that the young lovers will wind up together by story’s end, and little attempt is made by Minnelli, his cast or playwright/screenwriter William Douglas-Home to disguise the fact that the setup is a simple ruse to justify an elegantly plotted series of set-pieces in which Harrison and Kendall show off their chops with lightning dialogue and expert comic timing. Everyone before and behind the camera seems to be eminently at ease, which gives the movie a calming quality that, if you look at it the right way, is a bit startling within the fairly chaotic comedy-of-errors that zips across the screen.\n\nReally, all Minnelli did with Douglas-Homes’ play was orchestrate things so that they fell into the right place. Harrison and Kendall have the facility of old pros, Dee and Saxon are impossibly good-looking and sweet, the script floats on charm and the magical logic of theatrical plotting and the general feel-good-at-the-movies aura that we like to associate with big-name comedies from Hollywood in the ‘50s is reliably reinforced. Minnelli was a consummate showman even when he wasn’t terribly interested in being an artist; here he showed that he had the good taste to sit back, design fluid camera movements to fill his beautiful sets, and let a stacked deck work in his favor."
