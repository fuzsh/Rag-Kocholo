(Rolf Orthel)\n\nOur guide is a woman who visits a bookstore in search of Anthologie du Cinéma Invisible, a collection of one hundred unfilmed screenplays published to commemorate the first centenary of cinema. From these unrealized works, the essence of ten projects are selected and given life. Inserting clips from Chaplin and Clouzot, Zazie dans le métro, Battleship Potemkin and more, this documentary is a playful fantasy that pays homage to all of cinema.\n\n[Director’s Statement] The style of the film maneuvers a difficult course between the world of René Clair’s The Italian Straw Hat and Zilah, the last work by K. Schippers. The book is in actuality a poem disguised as a novel. It is a quest for purity—the way children discover the world through the games they play, the way they take in letters literally in their imagination, the way they conjure with concepts or landscapes. It is the last moment when they create their own world before they have to accept the reality of the world of adults. That is what we feel in the screenplays from the book Anthologie du Cinéma Invisible. This film pays homage to the desires and the aims of the writers of these scripts.\n\nThe structure is like that of a fan: the variety with which different people tackle the film medium means that the sequences have to be as different as possible, each with their own identity. Yet they form a unity in a strange way—think of the repeated “documentary” introductions that precede each sequence, for instance. In addition, typical cinema tricks are not avoided. The wad of paper, reminiscent of The Red Balloon, will float around town—elegant, cheerful and curious, forming a playful unity."
