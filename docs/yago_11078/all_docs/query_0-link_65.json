        "text": "Virtual Choir 5 featured in Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of our Universe. The film is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between composer & conductor Eric Whitacre, producers Music Productions, scientists and visualizers from the Space Telescope Science Institute and multi award-winning artists 59 Productions. The film paints the incredible story of the Hubble Deep Field. Turning its gaze to a tiny and seemingly dark area of space (around one 24-millionth of the sky) for an 11-day long period, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed over 3,000 galaxies that had never previously been seen, each one composed of hundreds of billions of stars.\n\nThe soundtrack features a Virtual Choir 5 representing 120 countries: over 8,000 voices aged 4 to 87, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Eric Whitacre Singers.\n\nDeep Field will be seen in presentations in museums, galleries, at festivals and science & music events worldwide. It will also be projected at concert performances, with the score performed live, with orchestra and chorus."
