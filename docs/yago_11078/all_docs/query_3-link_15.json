The documentary Glas by Bert Haanstra contrasts human glassblowing labor with automated bottle production in a factory. It uses minimal dialogue and focuses on visual and musical storytelling. Through close-ups and seamless integration of jazz music, it depicts the glassblowers' craftsmanship and precision in a tender, buoyant manner. Meanwhile, scenes of the factory machinery emphasize a lack of human touch and emotion. The documentary powerfully illustrates the significance of human work through its creative cinematography and soundtrack.",
