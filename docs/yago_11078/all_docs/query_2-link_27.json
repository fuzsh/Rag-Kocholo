        "text": "Movies had been something my parents used as a babysitter, of sorts, to keep me and my younger brother occupied while they shopped in Webster City in the very early 1950s.\n\nI don’t remember much about them, except when the feature attraction on a Saturday morning dealt with some of my cowboy heroes of the day. I also remember one Saturday morning my brother and I were entertained by one of the old Ma and Pa Kettle movies.\n\nSoon after, my parents and three kids moved away to the tiny town of Alleman. I soon learned that, in Alleman, everybody knew everybody. In fact, at one time, I could tell you who lived in every house in town, all 140-or-so people who called Alleman “home.”\n\nImagine my excitement when I learned that Alleman would host an outdoor movie one warm evening. The “theater” was a white wall downtown and it seems to me it was the side of a building, although that could be wrong.\n\nAll the kids in town gathered early. At that time, there were only three kids in my class who lived in Alleman and one of those was a girl, so she didn’t count.\n\nMy classmate and I arrived early, as did most of the kids in town. We sat on a makeshift bench on the grass and watched “The Babe Ruth Story” on the big outdoor screen.\n\nEven as a 10-year-old, I could tell this was a real flop as a movie. William Bendix, who played Babe Ruth in the movie, couldn’t even swing a bat properly, yet there he was on the big screen in the lead role. It was a pretty poor movie, but it was done just a few years after Ruth had died an American baseball hero.\n\nThere was a big crowd assembled that night in “downtown” Alleman. If memory serves, there was nothing but gravel streets in town at that time. I’m sure that Main Street wasn’t paved for some time after that because I remember a big town-wide celebration held to commemorate that occasion.\n\nThe black and white film, naturally, took us through the life of “The Babe,” from his time growing up in an orphanage in Baltimore to his time as a pitcher with Boston to his ultimate trade to the Yankees where he became known as the “Sultan of Swat.”\n\nIn reality, the movie took far too many liberties with the truth to be a true biography of Ruth. But, like all the kids in Alleman, I was entertained and thought my family had moved to a great new home. After all, nothing like that had ever happened in Duncombe.\n\nAnd, the excitement of living in Alleman only grew from that point. Just a year or so later, another big city-wide celebration was held on the new paved downtown Main Street and that was followed again by a celebration in the brand-new Quonset hut built by the Alleman Co-op. Both of those celebrations even had city-wide dances.\n\nMy friends and I used to make fun of some of those events, thinking that they proved that Alleman was really “Hicks-ville” when it came to entertainment.\n\nNow, however, when I look back on some of that small town entertainment, it’s with a type of melancholy that similar events aren’t held often enough.\n\nThey may not have meant much to outsiders. But, to those of us living in Alleman, they brought us all closer together. We were proud, if only in the moment, to be a part of something special."
