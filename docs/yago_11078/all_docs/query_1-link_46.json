        "text": "George Sluizer began his career as an assistant to Michael Anderson, Sacha Guitry and Bert Haanstra and started producing and directing award-winning short films and documentaries, primarily for TV, in the early 1960s. A number of Sluizer's films document travels in Europe or Brazil; some were produced for the National Geographic Society and saw widespread international distribution. Continuing this work into the 70s, he also expanded into feature films, producing, among others, Werner Herzog's \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982)."
