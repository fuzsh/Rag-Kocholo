He worked for six months In the various departments of ﬁlm production that made up what was the leading documentary ﬁlm unit In the country, and since the documentary movement was started In England by John Grierson, and since It was John Grierson who started the Shell Film Unit, one can say - the world. Ronnie settled In the camera department, and became a lighting cameraman - and then a director. During his eighteen years at Shell Film Unit, Ronnie was exposed to a wide range of subjects, locations and talented ﬁlm makers on a day-to-day basis. One of the Interesting things about making sponsored ﬁlms, is that one Is always In contact with the top expert in the subject, whether It Is the Head of Research, Chief Test Pilot, Rally Driver, Scientist, Chemist, whatever the subject, the sponsor and the ﬁlm maker need and get the best advice/consultancy available.\n\nSome of the ﬁlms Ronnie worked on at Shell Film Unit Included; 'MILLE MIGLIA' the famous thousand mile race around Italy on roads open to the publlcl •RIVAL WORLD' a film shot In Africa about man's fight against Insects. Directed by Bert Haanstra, Ronnie ﬂew through locust swarms ﬁlming attempts to control these Insects by spraying with Insecticide from the air.

Ronnie ﬁlmed from a car driven by Dean Delamont of the RAC Competition Department. 'SONG OF THE CLOUDS' A John Armstrong ﬁlm about the romance and excitement of the dawning age of International air travel. Shared credit for photography. 'HIGH SPEED FLIGHT' a series on the theory of sub-sonic trans-sonic and super-sonic ﬂight.

For the 'HIGH SPEED FLIGHT SERIES' Sidney Beadle and Ronnie Whitehouse developed colour schlleren, a ﬁlm technique for showing super-sonic shock waves In colour in the wind tunnel. This ﬁlm, photographed by Ronnie, explains how It works.\n\nSome of the ﬁlms written and directed by Ronnie Whitehouse; •THE MAPLIN PROJECT' for Shell International.

'DEAD SAFE' was a ﬁlm sponsored by IMI about safety In handling guns. For this ﬁlm, Ronnie received the 'ZITA PLAQUE' award - by the Screen Writers' Guild of Great Britain. 'THE CHOICE' sponsored by ICI. This ﬁlm on the environment, takes the view, that conservation Is not a ﬁght In which there will be winners and losers but one that we shall all win - or all lose. 'THE CHOICE' is ours. This ﬁlm received the GOLD AWARD for Outstanding Achievement In the Creation of Visual Communication at the United States Industrial Film Festival In Chicago, USA. \"I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH BABIES\", a ﬁlm for the BBC.
