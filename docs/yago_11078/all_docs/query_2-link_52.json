        "text": "Luke Alleman is quarterback from Thibodaux High School in Thibodaux, La. The 6’2 186 pound class of 2021 recruit has the ability to beat defenses with his arm and his feet. Moving in the pocket, Alleman constantly keeps his eyes down field, and when the pocket collapses has the ability to get outside the pocket and scramble for extra yardage or find an open receiver down field for a big play. Luke tells me he has a 235 pound bench, 385 pound squat, 205 pound clean, and a 355 pound dead lift. He is currently carrying a 3.0 GPA.\n\nCHECK OUT HIS FILM HERE.\n\nWhen did you start playing football?\n\nI started playing when I was about six, they only allowed you to play seven and eight year olds back then. But, I have a twin brother, and my dad figured we were so tough that we could play with the older kids. So I ended up playing three years instead of two. I played bantam football for the Thibodaux Vikings.\n\nDid you play any other sports growing up?\n\nYes sir, I played baseball, football, and basketball up until my eighth grade year. Then up until my sophomore year I played just football, and baseball. Then I just concentrated on football year round to get schools to look at me.\n\nDid you always play quarterback or did you play any other positions?\n\nI played linebacker and safety growing up, but when I got to my eighth grade year my coach asked me if I wanted to try out for quarterback and I said yeah. I got to have the ball in my hands every play. I learned how to read defenses and growing up like that it felt natural so when I got to high school I stuck with it.\n\nGoing back to last season, what were some of your top goals?\n\nI wanted to make it to the playoffs. My sophomore year we actually missed the playoffs. So my main goal was just making the playoffs, I knew we had a good receiving corps, I was just trying to win as many games as possible I guess. Just win every game and make it to the playoffs.\n\nWho would you say some of your biggest influences are?\n\nMy dad, of course my dad is one of my biggest influences because I live with him. He wakes up every morning to go to work at six o’clock and works until five o’clock every day. He has taught me, and I’ve grown up with the mentality that there’s no excuses. You wake up and do what you have to do. He is probably one of the biggest influences in my life.\n\nWho is your favorite NFL player?\n\nDrew Brees, just from watching him with my dad, and the way he gets out of his stance. Even though he is a smaller guy, he plays with a big guy mentality. I like how he can make every throw and make every read. Yeah, definitely Brees is my favorite player.\n\nWhat motivates you the most?\n\nMy dad, my dad motivates me the most. He wakes up every morning and does what he has to do to provide for me and my family. The fact that he wakes up every morning and does all that for me and my family, I just know I have to go play DI ball and make it to the NFL and give it back to him.\n\nGoing into this season, what are your expectations?\n\nMy expectations this season are very high. Going in all the guys know what they have to do, we’ve been going over it. We’ve had a lot of spring ball, I’ve had my offense together, going over plays, going over reads. Looking at coverages, sending out game film. So my guys should know what’s going on when we finally get out there. So, expectations are high, make it to the semi-final make it to the state championship that’s my expectations going into the season this year.\n\nSpeaking of spring ball, and not really having summer ball, what have you been doing to keep yourself in shape during quarantine?\n\nI get up at 630 every morning and get our team lift in and field work. Then I have a trainer that I go do conditioning with around noon, and then at night I’ll get another lift in and I’ll get some throwing in at night. We have a lift day every two days, so on Mondays we have a lift day, then on Tuesdays it’s a position day, then a lift day and so on. So some days I’ll throw and some days I’ll lift.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 what would be your ideal game day performance number?\n\nI would say a 10. You’re trying to prepare the whole week to play the game, and they’re going to throw at you every blitz package, every coverage, man coverage, zone coverage. You try to be prepared as much as possible before you go into the game, so you can have something in the back of your mind to throw at them to go against what they throw at you. So you try to prepare for a 10 type game.\n\nAt the end of this year, what would you like your coaches and teammates to say about you?\n\nI want them to say that I was the hardest working guy in the room. I want them to know when I walk on the field, that won’t give any excuses. That I was the guy that got it done.\n\nDo you think attitude is a factor in winning?\n\nAttitude affects a lot. Because, if you go into a game being timid or scared, or walk out of the locker room with doubt, of course you are going to lose the game. But if you go into the game knowing you prepared for this team, I know their tendencies. Your odds are going to be way better heading into that game.\n\nIf you weren’t playing football, what sport do you think you would be playing?\n\nProbably baseball, I was a pretty good pitcher. I was throwing high eighties low nineties when I was pitching off the mound."
