        "text": "CHAMBERSBURG - Corey Alleman plants trees.\n\nIt’s really that simple.\n\nThe Chambersburg psychotherapist has planted more than 900 trees in less than three years.\n\n“I definitely enjoy being outside,” Alleman said. “I find it to be very enjoyable and rewarding to plant things.”\n\nHe doesn’t dig too deep into his psyche to find the source of his passion. Or is it a compulsion?\n\n“It’s just a hobby, something I enjoy doing,” Alleman said. “Even though I’m a psychotherapist, I always enjoyed working with my hands.”\n\nMore: Black bear spends the night up a tree in Shippensburg-area housing development\n\nHe tried woodworking for a while.\n\n“I started seeing spots for trees,” he said. “I started asking neighbors if I could plant one. Some took me up on it, and before I knew it I was getting bigger and bigger.”\n\nSome projects call for reforestation with bare-root seedlings. Others need saplings from gardening shops.\n\nHe brainstorms in nurseries about trees. No, he doesn't talk to plants.\n\nOne recent morning he found a northern catalpa, called his friend, Curtis Shoup, and they planted it by early afternoon. Alleman tamped the soil around the tree with his bare hands.\n\nShoup helped dig the hole for the tree. He is renovating a 1900-era stone farmhouse in Chambersburg. The two men’s wives had been college classmates.\n\n“We made a connection with the same place,” Shoup said.\n\nAlleman scanned Shoup’s grassy acre. He is planning serviceberry, black gum, oaks and maybe maples as a way to absorb water running off from a neighboring development.\n\n“We basically have a clean canvas to work with,” Alleman said.\n\nMore: Heckmans say goodbye to Christmas tree farm\n\nHe and Shoup have already cut down the ailanthus, also known as the tree-of-heaven or Chinese sumac. They have painted the stumps with herbicide, the first step in eliminating the stand of aggressive invasive plants.\n\nAlleman has planted in the snow and in the heat, along streets and beside creeks. He’s worked with Wilson College, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Chambersburg Shade Tree Commission. His 16-month-old son helps.\n\nHe recently explained the benefits of trees to the Franklin County Commissioners – cleaner air, noise reduction, increased property values and reduced crime. A tree-lined street slows vehicle traffic by about 10 mph, he said. Trees must be a default part of the design.\n\nCommissioners surprised Alleman with a certificate of appreciation for his efforts.\n\n“How do you do this?” Commissioner Bob Thomas asked him. “Is it like Johnny Appleseed? More people need to understand.”\n\nAlleman was at a loss with his simple philosophy. Replay: Chance the Gardener, played by Peters Sellers in the 1979 film \"Being There.\"\n\nAlleman eventually came around to: “The answer to the question is: A tree.”\n\n“I’m a product of a movement that has been advancing our country before I was born,” he said. “I don’t have any specific goals. I don’t think we’re going to get to the point where we have too many trees.”\n\nIf he owned 100 acres, Alleman said, he probably would still be planting trees on his own property. He ran out of space for his hobby. He has a Facebook page “Trees by Corey.”\n\nMore: County unemployment rate at the lowest level in 10 years\n\nTrees can be planted anytime, he said, but they must have adequate water.\n\nHis avocation is distinct from his vocation.\n\n“There is discussion of being outside and nature being good for your wellbeing and health, but I don’t specialize in that,” Alleman said. “I don’t know if I’d call it therapy. It sure does make me feel good. I can’t wait to get out and plant my next tree.”\n\nJim Hook, 717-262-4759"
