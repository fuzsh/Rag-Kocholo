        "text": "Alleman (The Human Dutch)\n\nPortrait of Dutch society, captured using a hidden camera. This Dutch classic portrays the day-to-day life of the Netherlands and its inhabitants, presenting a range of different lifestyles in both a comical and serious light. Peter Ustinov was used as for the foreign-language voice-over. The film is regarded as unique, since it was produced just before the rise of hippie-culture, but with the drama of war still very palpable. Premiere of the restoration by Beeld & Geluid. The Human Dutch holds the box-office record for documentaries in the Netherlands, and ranks among top-10 films in Dutch cinema. Internationally the film has won various awards, such as the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Adelaide Film Festival, and has been nominated for both a BAFTA award and an Oscar®.\n\nGlas (Glass)\n\nOscar winning documentary, restored by Beeld en Geluid. In Glass, we see the art of glassblowing portrayed as a rhythmic interplay between the hot glass and the precision of the craftsmen. An intricate ballet of hand movements demonstrates the art of traditional glassblowing, contrasted against a factory where everything is strictly ordered. Glass is a visual spectacular, clearly characterized by an eye for detail and a keen sense of humor. Add jazz music by Pim Jacobs, and the resulting composition is one completely in line with the Dutch tradition of the “cinematic poem”. (Text: Beeld en Geluid)"
