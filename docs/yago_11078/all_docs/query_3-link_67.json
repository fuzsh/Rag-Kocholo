Bert Haanstra's 1958 documentary Glas contrasts the handcrafted production of glassware in a workshop with the mechanized mass production of bottles in a factory. Through montage and juxtaposition, it argues that factory production renders products impersonal and lacking sentiment or value beyond utility. Scenes of skilled glassworkers blowing, shaping, and crafting glass by hand with music are presented with tenderness, transforming their labor into a soulful orchestra. In contrast, images of the factory assembly line feature glass fragments rushing restlessly in complex tangles to jarring electronic music, questioning the dehumanization of industrial production.",
