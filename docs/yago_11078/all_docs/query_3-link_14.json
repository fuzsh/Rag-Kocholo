        "text": "This is a short film by Dutch filmmaker Bert Haanstra — his first, incredibly. Beautiful images woven around a theme so simple it can be stated in the two-word title: EVERYTHING FLOWS.\n\nI like this and I like KOYAANISQATSI. I met Godfrey Reggio in Telluride last year — he was very nice and he was eighty-seven feet high, which is probably what gives his films the lofty sense of perspective. He looks down at us and we are as ants scurrying about the earth. Now, some don’t care for KOYAANISQATSI, and I guess I sort of understand — the Monthly Film Bulletin summed its message up as an old hippy axiom, “Nature good, cities bad.” Which is pretty banal, I admit, but not quite what I get from the film — some of the city images in it are outstandingly beautiful — it is only some ASPECTS of the city that are bad. And that may be banal but it is also true, and it seems unfair to fault Reggio for the banality of the universe, especially when he expresses it so beautifully.\n\nI admit — we have all seen too much time-lapse and heard too much Philip Glass since then.\n\nBut seeing and hearing them in such abundance and for the first time made a big impression on me. I was hypnotised. When I showed my college friend Simon he remarked halfway through that he’d just realised he’d been frozen in position for forty-five minutes. Since it large excludes regular people activities in medium shot, the movie offers no cues for the viewer to relax along with the characters.\n\nSo yes, I like KOYAANISQATSI, but the Reggio owes a debt to the Haanstra, which is even more beautiful.\n\nSeeing the film, Pudovkin remarked that he always thought Holland had people in it. Haanstra modestly said he wasn’t quite ready for people.\n\nHaanstra is probably best known for TRAFIC, on which he tried to collaborate with Jacques Tati but got silently elbowed out. SOme of his footage did make it in — by this time, Haanstra had started making observational docs with people in, and his eye for behaviour had convinced someone that he was a natural partner for the great French clown, a man with no partner and no place for partners. Let’s all get to know Haanstra’s own work.\n\nTelluride is such a lovely festival, located in the most spectacularly beautiful place I’ve ever been — as Ferris Bueller says, “If you have the means, I highly recommend it.”\n\nSuch a place shouldn’t really require a survival guide, and indeed it doesn’t — it’s Cannes that you have to watch out for — Cannes wants you dead — but I thought that in the guise of such a guide I could get away with waxing lyrical about my six days of cinematic bliss —\n\nThe weather guide for the place told us it’d be warm, but that it could be cold at night. That’s true as far as it goes, as was my friend and editor Timo’s description of “proper shorts weather,” but you had best bring an umbrella too, or acquire one (the Festival’s own official umbrella is $30 but the design is beautiful). We had thunderstorms every day but one, I think, and corruscating hail that bounced down the street after you like Rover from The Prisoner only 80,000 times faster. None of this spoiled the pleasure, indeed the distant rumbles from the mountains added a touch of Tolkein. I was in La Pierre waiting for a screening and so missed the week’s most acclaimed meteorological event — a rainbow across the mountains bisected by a lightning bolt — but I certainly saw plenty of raw-nature-as-backdrop. I didn’t go trekking because I fear bears. It’s the cuddly killers you have to watch out for in this life.\n\nThe hell of every film fest is that as you see one movie you’re probably missing four more. You just have to relax, target things you fancy that might not get a release, but mix it up with things everybody’s excited about, and see live stuff that’ll never come back too.\n\nGodfrey Reggio, no less, described Telluride as like an ocean liner — you walk up, then down, and meet the same people three or four times a day. Although sometimes you miss them because you’re in films when they’re out and about, and vice versa.\n\nThe festival feeds its guests once a day, and well. A spectacular brunch in the mountains, a picnic in the park (“It was no more a picnic than he was a man,” as Welles says in LADY FROM SHANGHAI — what I mean is that this is a huge outdoor banquet with marquees and movie stars and people congratulating you on your film (which you had best get used to if you go with one), parties at fabulous houses. Go to any of these you get invited to, each is memorable and unmissable.\n\nIf, like me, you have a certain level of vertigo, journeying from your hotel to the town, or from the town to the Chuck Jones Theater, may prove emotionally taxing. You are dangled on a wire in a little booth seating six, and trundled through the sky above the treetops. The ominous drone of the machinery occasionally varies as the contraption pauses for no discernible reason (a delay caused by someone having difficulty dismounting at the other end, apparently).\n\nIn daylight the view is so incredible it serves to distract nicely: I likened the resulting combination of beauty and terror to having Halle Berry come at you with an axe. At night the gondolas are pitch black, though the starscapes, fuzzed by perspex, still add awe. I recommend Diazepam if you think you may need it, but don’t hide on the floor: the scenery is your best tonic/distraction/sedative.\n\nThe gondolas are also the best place to practice your pitch. Tell people about your film and they will go. I couldn’t believe this at first, and missed many chances to persuade people to attend. By the end I had it down cold and managed to nearly pack our cinema for a last-minute bonus screening at 9am on a Monday morning. Telluride is a word-of-mouth film festival — there’s been very little press about our film, but people seemed to hear about it alright.\n\nLeave the brunch early to avoid a huge wait. But stay and enjoy it and you can find yourself chatting to interesting people in line. It’s win-win, like so much at Telluride.\n\nSee the smaller films: MUSIDORA: THE TENTH MUSE by Patrick Cazals studied the life and work of Feuillade’s great star, revealing much I hadn’t known: did you know Musidora directed several films? Now I want to see them, as they look very good, and as star she is always compelling. I left with even more respect for her acting, which magnetically pulls focus from her co-stars without any visible effort, and runs the gamut from startling naturalism to savage pantomime. This ran alongside NATAN at the bonus screening and made a perfect mate for it (almost too perfect: it uses all the same techniques, only better — apart from not having a papier mache main character). Cazals has made docs on figures as diverse as Paradjanov and Mamoulian, which I now crave to see.\n\nCoppola was in attendance with RUMBLE FISH, subject of a new doc (LOCATIONS: SEARCHING FOR RUSTY JAMES) — Paul Duane approached him at a party to voice his admiration: “He didn’t look very interested, but the acoustics weren’t good at that party, so while I was telling him that RUMBLE FISH had always been a great cult film in Ireland, he was probably hearing ‘Blah blah blah I’m a boring cunt.'”\n\nFestival co-founder Tom Luddy informed us that Chris Marker actually shot background plates for RUMBLE FISH — some of that time-lapse stuff — which raised our eyebrows. Also that Marker’s last major work was on Second Life. He wasn’t interested in spending time restoring his earlier films as he was too excited by new media. “I can’t waste time on that — the tools I need are finally here!”\n\nBe sociable! I regret not telling Coppola what a big cult item RUMBLE FISH always was in Scotland, but I had great chats with Philip Kaufman, John Ptak, Patrick Cazals, and formed the kind of intense friendships with fellow filmmakers that festivals are really good for. I want to see Esther Julie-Anne, Battiste Fenwick and Dario Naldi again soon. Dario takes a good picture —\n\nTo give you an idea —\n\nI descend into Telluride each day in what they call a gondola, though it comes without a man singing Italian opera while wielding a punt — it’s a cable car that dangles you above the deer and bears and trees and afford a spectacular, gently lurching view, the perfect combination of beauty and terror, a bit like being attacked by Halle Berry with a hammer.\n\nIt’s impossible to choose from the wealth of stuff on show so I’ve been trying to repay the nice filmmakers who have attended NATAN by seeing their films. We met Battiste Fenwick and Esther Julie-Anne and hit it off and so I dragged myself to their films at 9.20 am Friday — if not for insomnia I’d never have managed it. And I was SO glad I did.\n\nIn a day that included Pierre Rissient screening MUSCLE BEACH and an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Don DeLillo reading from Underworld as accompaniment to the Zapruder Film, stories read aloud/performed by Jason Reitman, Buck Henry, Gregory Nava, Teller, Tamara Jenkins, Joyce Maynard, Salman Rushdie and Michael Fitzgerald, Battiste and Esther’s films, documentaries produced at UCLA, were still probably the highlight.\n\nThey’re a husband-and-wife team, each having directed one movie and edited the other. And their wedding forms a part of one of the movies, and they now have their first kid very much on the way. The films were submitted separately to Telluride but the smart programmers realized that the two movies make a perfect double feature, being wildly different yet underneath, if not similar, certainly mutually complimentary in all kinds of ways.\n\nQ&A chaired by Godfrey Reggio, left. Photo by Richard Parkin.\n\nThe screening was sparsely attended: it must have been crushing to see those empty seats — but everyone who was there had an unforgettable experience. Unforgettable. And we were privileged. These films deserve a HUGE audience.\n\nBattiste has made UNA CHANZA MAS (ONE MORE CHANCE) about Pedro, a former LA gang member attempting to build a new life, and Esther has made OUT OF LOVE, a film about her much-married father, his “harem” of ex-wives, and his relationship with his kids, in an attempt to discover whether love can last. Two very different films which resonate beautifully with each other. I rarely cry at movies (well, fairly rarely), and certainly not more than once per movie, but I was a mess here, and fully expected to be bursting into tears all through the rest of the day. Fortunately the other entertainers listed above kept me distracted, but I may go weep into my pillow now. It’s 01:36 am and I’m pretty tired. I want to write more about these movies soon and I urge everyone to see them.\n\nHappy endings department — word spread — Telluride is a word-of-mouth film festival — Godfrey Reggio likens it to an ocean liner where you stroll around and meet the same people again and again. For their second screening, Esther and Battiste had a huge full house, and again an amazingly enthusiastic response. Another of the magic Telluride stories everyone seems to have, and well-deserved. These are filmmakers to watch, and they are now well and truly LAUNCHED."
