Partly with the aid of a hidden camera he observes people in the most diverse situations. He shows the unusual in the usual and the usual in the unusual. The harsh years of the post war era of reconstruction have passed and for most people life is better than before.",

The editing is brisk and the images crisp - there‚Äôs genuine artistry, idiosyncrasy and borderline lunacy to this portrait that adds up to a thoroughly delightful watch.\n\nWindmills, canals, and a brilliant though underachieving football team, check. They are all here, in passing. But there‚Äôs much more than lazy caricatures of‚Ä¶\n\nOver the course of two years, Bert Haanstra tirelessly shot, cut and edited more than 40,000 metres of film. The result was Alleman: a wholly unique masterpiece of observational cinema; endearing, impressive, magnificently shot and composed, and over all a work of art of the highest order.\n\nAmsterdam residents commenting on a bust of Hitler on the Jewish quarter market, an ice-skating toddler intercut with a slipping swan, football players smashing into the grass face-first accompanied by a faltering version of a classic Louis Davids tune... the number of highlights is endless.\n\nThe original commentary by newspaper columnist (and national icon) Simon Carmiggelt is fitting and at times rather brilliant, steeped in his unique kind of endearing irony, much of which is‚Ä¶\n\nTHX 04 | SvdW film reviews\n\nDate Watched: Monday, June. 6, 2022 | How I Watched: YouTube on tv\n\nFinally decided to sit down for this one.

I found the 4K remastered version on YouTube and it looks amazing.\n\nAlleman is directed by Bert Haanstra. His directing is fine. It is quite visible he really put a lot of work in capturing everything. The screenplay [is it a screenplay if it a documentary though? Okay, I mean the script] by Simon Carmiggelt, Bert Haanstra and Anton Koolhaas [the latter two got uncredited] is‚Ä¶"
