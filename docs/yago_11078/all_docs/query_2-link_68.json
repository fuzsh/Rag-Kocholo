        "text": "Reed Alleman is a New Orleans singer/songwriter who has entertained crowds along the Gulf Coast for over two decades with his locally inspired, well crafted songwriting.\n\nReed has performed at the New Orleans French Quarter Festival’s BMI Songwriters Stage two years in a row. He has also performed at BMI’s Key West Songwriter’s Festival and the Mississippi Songwriter’s Festival. Reed has played live on the air at New Orleans radio station WWOZ. He performed live at the Louisiana Music Factory and has been interviewed on WWL radio about his music, and his travels to NYC after Sept. 11th with the Gumbo Krewe. This trip is the subject of his song “Operation Gumbo Drop.” He also traveled with the Gumbo Krewe to Camp Lejeune N.C. to play a live show for the troops returning from Afghanistan, which inspired his song “You Don’t Even Know Me.” The stories of these travels and songs were covered by Time Magazine and Inside Northside Magazine.\n\nReed has released three CDs over the last decade. Many of his songs are written about the South Louisiana that he grew up in, tackling subjects like marsh and swampland destruction, Mississippi River refineries and the events surrounding hurricane Katrina. Reed also writes about characters like radio personality Don Dubuc, fisherman Deadly Dudley, and the Gumbo Krewe, using small Louisiana towns like Chipola, Sorrento and Cocodrie as backdrops. Reed easily changes gears into songs like “Fortunes Of War,” about the soldiers who are off at war protecting our country, and other songs about real life.\n\nReed has played the Gulf Coast music scene for many years as a solo artist and with the Reed Alleman Band. He has played the Hard Rock Casino, IP Casino, and The Grand Casinos in Biloxi, MS. Before that he played a long stint at Margaritaville in the historic New Orleans French Quarter.\n\nReed wrote the theme song for the Don Dubuc Radio Show, which airs every Saturday morning on WWL 870 AM and is broadcast in over 30 states.\n\nRecently, his song “Life’s A Strange Game” (from the CD of the same name) was featured in a documentary called “The Sojourners” by Ghost Rider Pictures. This film was submitted to the Sundance Music Festival and is gaining interest in theatres across the country.\n\nHis song “Katrina” was featured on the CD Hurricane Hymns, a compilation of songs by New Orleans artists about hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Hymns helped raise money for New Orleans residents hit hardest by the storm.\n\nReed is also a member of the songwriters group Voices Of New Orleans, featuring established and up-and-coming Louisiana songwriters. He continues to perform in and around the greater New Orleans and Gulf Coast area."
