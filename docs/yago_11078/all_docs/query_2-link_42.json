IN MEMORY OF SARAH ALLEMAN With heavy hearts, we ask that you please take a moment to read this blog post, which honors the life of Sarah Joann Alleman.\n\nNEW SONG, \"FUN SIZE\" FILM Pleased to announce that I have a new song in the upcoming Paramount/Nickelodeon movie, \"Fun Size\" which hits theaters Oct. 26th. The song is a bit different for me, it's called \"Masquerade\" and like the movie, it's a Halloween love story. It was so fun to write - in fact I'd call it the most lighthearted, fun song I've ever written. It releases on iTunes on Oct. 23rd. The film is a teen comedy starring Victoria Justice, Directed by Josh Schwartz (Gossip Girl, The OC, Chuck.) Learn more about the film, here.\n\nJON FOREMAN COLLABORATION Excited to pull the cover off of another one of the \"secret projects\" I've been working away on this year. Privileged to have contributed to 4 songs on the upcoming Jon Foreman (Switchfoot) solo record. The release date has yet to be announced, but I am so thrilled to have contributed to these gorgeous songs. Read a bit more about the project here.\n\nThanks for reading!! Hope to see you at one of the remaining Fall Tour dates!\n\nMuch love, Ryan - Sleeping At Last P.S."
