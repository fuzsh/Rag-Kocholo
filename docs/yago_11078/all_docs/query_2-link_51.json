        "text": "The Southdown Plantation House has an exhibit celebrating Cajun craftsmanship and compiled primarily by the late artisans' families.\n\nAt the center is Ebdon Alleman, a pirogue-maker from Pierre Part who caught the attention of two filmmakers in the 1940s.\n\nDirector Robert Flaherty used a pirogue Alleman made in his film “Louisiana Story.” The movie was nominated for an Oscar in 1948.\n\n“He was looking for authentic artisans down the bayou who could contribute,” said Rachel Cherry, the plantation museum's director.\n\nAnother storyteller, Arnold Eagle, was on set taking photographs of Flaherty when Alleman caught his eye. Eagle later made a short film about Alleman called “The Pirogue Maker.”\n\nYou can view the tools Alleman used and watch “The Pirogue Maker” as part of the “Art of the Edge Tool” exhibit at the plantation house, Cherry said.\n\nThe exhibit's grand opening is Jan. 27. A reception, which will run from 2 to 4 p.m., is open to the public. You can also visit www.folkstreams.net/film,188 to view “The Pirogue Maker.”\n\nThe exhibit celebrates the bygone era of Cajun artisans.\n\n“We're showing different kinds of artisans from that era and how they used hand tools, specifically as opposed to computers, to create the art they create,” said Cherry, pointing out that many of the crafts were made “out of necessity, but have become art.”\n\nAlthough there is a pirogue on display at Southdown, the one he built in “Louisiana Story” was exhibited at the World's Fair in New Orleans in 1984 before ending up on display at the Smithsonian.\n\nThat pirogue was likely one of the last to be made using the old methods and tools, beginning with sawing a tree down, Cherry said.\n\nMarylin Porche, 63, one of several members of Alleman's family who contributed to the exhibit, said she likes the idea of preserving the tools for a younger generation.\n\n“It's an appreciation for what our grandparents did,” said Porche, who lives in Dularge. “Life was a lot harder back then.”\n\nPaula Kane, 58, who runs an antique store on La. 311, donated some of the other tools on display.\n\nHer grandfather Murphy Breaux was a laborer in Plaquemine, as well as a butcher and a plant-operator, Kane said.\n\n“I couldn't use the tools, but I didn't want to sell them — they were Paw Paw's,” she said.\n\nSome of the tools on display, mostly Alleman's, include a homemade wooden mallet, an adze used for smoothing or carving rough-cut wood and a plane used for shaping the wood.\n\nStaff Writer Katie Urbaszewski can be reached at 448-7617 or katie.urbaszewski@dailycomet.com."
