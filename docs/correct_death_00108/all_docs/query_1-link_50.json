        "text": "Death can be seen all throughout life, and all deaths can be for different reasons, whether those reasons be noble, villainous, or, in most cases, simply neither. Throughout both A Tale of Two Cities, written by Charles Dickens, and Slaughterhouse-Five, written by Kurt Vonnegut, death can be seen as a common topic betwixt both novels at one point or another, albeit each topic of death can be very different at times. Charles Dickens is a beloved author, responsible for many classic works such as A Tale of Two Cities. He was born February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England. He was the second oldest child of eight total, living most of his early life in Chatham, Kent, and Camden Town. When Dickens was 12 years old, his father, John Dickens, was …show more content…\n\nIn Slaughterhouse-Five, death is taken in a light manner, and is seen by the main protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, shows death throughout his experiences in the book as an impermanent and weightless event, which is the complete opposite of how Dickens portrays death. Throughout Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut places the words ‘So it goes.’ after every death, or multiple deaths seen at roughly the same time, eventually explaining this phrase as something the Tralfamadorians say after somebody because everyone is alive forever, even if at different times, so therefore death is meaningless in the eyes of those in Slaughterhouse-Five. The message about death that Slaughterhouse-Five attempts to bring is far different than the message A Tale of Two Cities attempts to bring. While Slaughterhouse-Five tries to tell us that death is meaningless and holds no weight, A Tale of Two Cities tries to tell us that death holds a lot of weight in the world, and that in some cases can be the most meaningful thing in the world. Vonnegut throughout his book takes a tone that is aloof or uncaring when it comes to death, a tone that tells us that he thinks death is meaningless, or weightless, whereas we can see that Dickens takes a more serious tone when it comes to death, showing that he has a deep respect for meaningful death, albeit when when he thinks that there is a pointless death, his tone changes to one of frustration or chastising. Vonnegut, on the other hand, keeps the same tone about death throughout the entire book, never changing his tone when an important death happens, or when a meaningful death occurs, but always keeps the same tone that says that he believes death holds no weight, in complete contrast to Dickens, who, no matter the circumstance, whether the death is important or meaningless, always seems to keep some level of respect for death in the way he talks about it."
