        "text": "Vonnegut’s writing beckons to me when I am at my most miserable. This is his genius, and his legacy: No author will ever be more adept at extracting comedy out of the inevitable suffering of the human race. Because of this, no matter how awful you felt, no matter how bleak your life may have seemed, Vonnegut made you feel connected. You could be living in a bunker in Kazakhstan, but in reading him you were no longer alone in your misery.It was fitting, then, that I had discovered Vonnegut when I was 23 years old and living in Akron, Ohio. He was a Midwesterner, after all, born in Indianapolis, and Akron is a Midwestern town that has seen its share of hardships. Vonnegut survived the firebombing at Dresden. Akron survived the death of the Rust Belt, not to mention Jeffrey Dahmer. It was in Akron that I began reading the copy of Cat’s Cradle that I was supposed to have finished during my freshman year of college. I never did, of course — I never read anything in college except the sports pages. Which was ironic on some level, I suppose, because up until then, I knew Vonnegut only as the bushy-haired man who made a (seemingly) inexplicable cameo in the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back to School. You know the scene, everybody does: Dangerfield’s character, the tacky millionaire Thornton Mellon, calls in the author to help him write a term paper about himself.\n\nMe, I used the Cliff’s Notes instead.\n\nAfter I read Cat’s Cradle, I read Slaughterhouse-Five. After I read Slaughterhouse-Five, I read Breakfast of Champions. I had spent my whole life cowering in fear of literature. I grew up reading MAD Magazine and the backs of cereal boxes. I read the first 20 pages of Jane Eyre and thought my head might explode. But Vonnegut didn’t write like that. And like me, he had an older brother who studied chemistry at M.I.T. Like me, he charted his own path by being willfully stupid, and by not paying attention in school. Like me, he largely studied drinking in college. Like me, he had worked a menial job, as a public-relations man for General Electric in Schenectady, New York.\n\nThe only unassailable advice about writing that I’ve ever heard in the years since I read Cat’s Cradle, since I began attempting (often unsuccessfully) to write fiction, came from Vonnegut, in an interview with the Paris Review.\n\nThe advice was this: Make a character want something."
