        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nKurt Vonnegut's books, a reviewer once wrote, are \"like nothing else on Earth.\" Several generations of readers agreed.\n\nKnown for his dark humor and often compared to Mark Twain for his social bite, the mustachioed, chain-smoking Vonnegut created alternate, fantastic worlds for his characters, many based on his own life.\n\nBeginning in 1952 with \"Player Piano,\" Vonnegut wrote 14 novels, including \"Cat's Cradle,\" \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\" and \"Breakfast of Champions.\" The last, \"Timequake,\" was published in 1997. He also wrote plays and nonfiction.\n\nVonnegut was born in Indianapolis in 1922 and served in the Army during World War II. He was held as a prisoner in the German city of Dresden during the allied firebombing of the city in which many thousands were killed. It was an experience that shaped his strong anti-war views.\n\nVonnegut spoke on the NewsHour on the 40th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nKURT VONNEGUT, Author:\n\nMy brother was with me. And when we heard the news, he was able to gauge the enormity of this news because he was a physicist. He is Dr. Vonnegut.\n\nAnd he understood immediately that a new, absolutely intolerable dimension of weapon had come into the world. And so he brought that home to me very quickly. And I had seen devastation, not at all on that order, but tending in that direction, of course, in the firebombing of Dresden.\n\nKURT VONNEGUT:\n\nIt distresses me deeply that ideas are not to be circulated freely in this country if certain persons have their way. One of the things that was great about this country was that I could say anything and that everyone else could say anything and we would compare all possible ideas and arrive at opinions.\n\nKURT VONNEGUT:\n\nWhat he found objectionable about human beings was they never noticed it when they were really happy.\n\nSo whenever he was really happy, you know, he could be sitting around in the shade, in the summertime, in the shade of an apple tree, and drinking lemonade and talking, you know, just sort of back-and-forth buzzing like honey bees. And Uncle Alex would all of a sudden say, \"If this isn't nice, what is?\" And then we'd realize how happy we were, and we might have missed it.\n\nAnd the bad Uncle Dan was when I came home from the war, which was quite painful. He clapped me on the back and said, \"You're a man now.\" I wanted to kill him."
