        "text": "Date of Birth November 11, 1922 Date Of Death April 11, 2007 Age 83 Years Death Cause Complications From Brain Injury\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr. was a famous American writer and comedian who was born on November 11, 1922, to mark a literature milestone. He gave American literature a unique and thought-provoking voice. With his sharp wit and keen social commentary, he challenged traditional standards. Sadly, he died on April 11, 2007, because of complications from a brain injury he got when he fell at home.\n\nVonnegut’s writing career, which lasted from 1951 to 2007, was marked by a unique mix of satire, dark humour, and science fiction that fit with the postmodernist trend in literature. As for his personal life, he got married to Jane Marie Cox in 1945, but they split up in 1971. He then married Jill Krementz in 1979. He adopted four additional children, including Steve Adams, in addition to his three biological children, which included Mark and Edith.\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s writing was refreshingly honest. When you read his work, you get the feeling that he saw through all the fake stuff in the world. He didn’t have a very high opinion of people, including his main characters and the bad guys. He seemed constantly let down by humans, including himself, and he expressed this feeling with a mix of really dark humour and deep sadness. He could have turned into a grumpy person, but he was too smart for that. He could have become a cynic, but he had a soft side he couldn’t hide. And even when he felt really down, he always found a way to keep his readers entertained with drawings, jokes, weird stories, and all sorts of things.\n\nHello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind ! (Kurt Vonnegut).\n\nThe Passing Story of Kurt Vonnegut\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s public speaking and lectures were just as popular as his books. Scholars and common readers alike admired his knowledge and sense of humour, making him a major figure in American intellectual and cultural circles. Like, in 2006, he made a famous joke about suing the tobacco company that made the Pall Mall cigarettes he had been smoking since he was a youngster. He said that the packaging of the cigarettes said that they would “kill” him. He said this when he was 83 years old.\n\nSadly this lively soul, died in Manhattan, New York City, on the night of April 11, 2007. His death was caused by brain damage he got when he fell at his brownstone home a few weeks before. His wife, Jill, told people that he had died. He had lived for 84 years. At the time of his death, Vonnegut had written fourteen novels, three collections of short stories, five plays, and five nonfiction books. He had made an indelible mark on the world of writing.\n\nThe last thing I ever wanted was to be alive when the three most powerful people on the whole planet would be named Bush, Dick and Colon! (Kurt Vonnegut).\n\nEven after he died, Vonnegut’s influence on writing was still being felt. In 2008, his son Mark put together and released a book called “Armageddon in Retrospect” that was made up of his unpublished writings. Other writers, like Josip Novakovich, have liked how he can tell stories that are both deep and short. Vonnegut was often praised for being a social critic with a dark sense of humour and a major counterculture novelist. He left a lasting mark on American literature."
