        "text": "Last night, at the age of 84, Kurt Vonnegut died in his Manhattan home from complications related to a brain injury he'd sustained in a fall weeks before. This is one of those moments where I am overwhelmed by the gravity of other peoples' losses, because I have never read a Vonnegut novel.\n\nThere is something especially tragic about an author you love dying. Writers are intellects and personalities; their story-soaked brains are the meats on which millions of book lovers anonymously feed. When a writer you love dies, it's personally tragic, because you'll never, ever know the thrill of reading something new. On the other hands, readers can comfort themselves with the knowledge that they loved that writer when he was alive.\n\nAs such, it's hard not to read Cory Doctorow's startled sentences announcing Vonnegut's death on Boing Boing and, as someone who can not share the experience, feel the personal loss of not having loved Vonnegut while he lived:\n\nMy first Vonnegut was Breakfast of Champions. I'd never read anything like it. It was a novel that was so easy, everything just happening, one thing after another. The book almost read itself. That was his gift, I think: to tell you things that were hard to hear, without you even noticing it. Like a nurse who can slide a needle into your vein without making you wince.\n\nStill, I can comfort myself with the knowledge that I have 14 Vonnegut novels that I can experience for the first time. As someone who has mourned over the deaths of authors I've known and loved, it's an experience I know Vonnegut fans would envy me. Why don't you guys tell me where I ought to start.\n\nThere will be many heartfelt Vonnegut tributes on the Internet today. Every newspaper will do an obituary. Here's the few that are up so far:\n\nKurt Vonnegut: RIP [Boing Boing]\n\nKurt Vonnegut, Novelist Who Caught the Imagination of His Age, Is Dead at 84 [NY Times]\n\nNovelist Kurt Vonnegut Dies at Age 84 [Forbes]\n\nHis popular novels blended social criticism, dark humor [LA Times]\n\nGallery of NY Times Vonnegut Reviews and Features Dating Back to 1952 [NY Times]\n\nKurt Vonnegut Entry [Wikipedia]\n\nSix-Word Sci-Fi: Stories Written by You\n\nHere's this month's prompt, how to submit, and an illustrated archive of past favorites.\n\nThe 21 Best Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nFancy Dance, Argylle, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Blade Runner 2049 are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nSemaglutide for the People\n\nThis week, we learn how easy it is to buy cloned Ozempic on the internet, and we explore what the latest research is revealing about how GLP-1 drugs affect our bodies.\n\nThe 61 Best Movies on Disney+ Right Now\n\nJim Henson: Idea Man, Taylor Swift: The Era’s Tour (Taylor’s Version), and Let It Be are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nAI Is Rewriting Meme History\n\nTikTok’s latest trend involves videos of people traveling back in time to interrupt the viral memes of yore.
