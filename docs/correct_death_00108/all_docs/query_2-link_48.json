        "text": "“I will say anything to be funny, often in the most horrible situations,” Vonnegut once told a gathering of psychiatrists.\n\nControversial success\n\nDespite his commercial success, Vonnegut battled depression throughout his life, and in 1984, he attempted suicide with pills and alcohol, joking later about how he botched the job.\n\nCritics ignored him at first, then denigrated his deliberately bizarre stories and disjointed plots as haphazardly written science fiction. But his novels became cult classics, especially Cat’s Cradle in 1963, in which scientists create “ice-nine”, a crystal that turns water solid and destroys the earth.\n\nMany of his novels were best-sellers. Some also were banned and burned for suspected obscenity.\n\nVonnegut took on censorship as an active member of the PEN writers’ aid group and the American Civil Liberties Union. The American Humanist Association, which promotes individual freedom, rational thought and scientific scepticism, made him its honorary president.\n\nVonnegut once said that of all the ways to die, he would prefer to go out in an airplane crash on the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. He often joked about the difficulties of old age.\n\n“When Hemingway killed himself, he put a period at the end of his life. Old age is more like a semicolon,” Vonnegut told The Associated Press in 2005."
