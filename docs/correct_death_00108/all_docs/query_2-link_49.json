        "text": "Background\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr. was born on November 11, 1922, in Indianapolis. He was the youngest child of Edith and Kurt Vonnegut Sr., with an older brother and sister. His father and grandfather were architects, and his mother was from a wealthy brewery-owning family. Vonnegut discovered his affinity for writing while in high school, becoming co-editor of the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper. He began to attend Cornell University in 1940, majoring in biochemistry, while working as a staff writer and editor of “The Cornell Daily Sun.” He then left university to join the U.S. Army in January 1943. During training, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Tennessee.\n\nHe was one of the American soldiers sent to Europe to fight in World War II, and he was taken prisoner by the Germans there during the Battle of the Bulge. He made it through the war despite being imprisoned. Upon returning to the U.S., Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, a high school sweetheart. As soon as they both registered for classes at the University of Chicago, he started working as a night reporter for the “City News Bureau.” Together, they had three kids: Mark, Edith, and Nanette. After his sister died from cancer and her husband was fatally injured in a railway accident, he adopted her sons in 1958.\n\nIn 1952, Vonnegut published his first novel “Player Piano.” During the next 20 years, he published several books and short story collections. Although positively reviewed, “Player Piano” was not commercially successful at the time of being published. “The Sirens of Titan” (1959) and “Cat’s Cradle” (1963) were well received and nominated in their respective years for a Fantasy Novel Hugo Award. In 1968, he published a short story collection titled “Welcome to the Monkey House.” His sixth novel, “Slaughterhouse-Five” (1969), was his breakthrough, and it was commercially and critically successful and plunged him into fame. Released amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, readers related to the book’s anti-war sentiment. The book topped “The New York Times” bestseller list. Vonnegut Jr. was the recipient of many awards and honors and was invited to deliver numerous lectures and addresses around the country. In 1970, he served as a correspondent during the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nIn the same year, he briefly taught creative writing at Harvard University. From 1973 to 1974, he taught at the City College of New York and was later elected vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Many institutions and colleges gave him honorary degrees. Even though he started writing science fiction short tales and novels, he eventually shifted his attention to political writings and painting. In addition to autobiographical essays like “Palm Sunday” (1981), he also released various short story collections such as”Fates Worse Than Death” (1991) and “A Man Without a Country” (2005).\n\nFollowing his divorce from his first wife in 1971, Vonnegut remarried in 1979. He and Jill Krementz, his second wife, to who he was married until his death, adopted a daughter named Lily. On April 11, 2007, Vonnegut passed away because of injuries sustained a few weeks earlier after falling. He is regarded as one of the most significant modern authors and a darkly humorous commentator on American society and has gained a lot of acclaim after his passing.\n\nSome prestigious awards he received include the Hugo Award for ‘Best Dramatic Presentation,’ the Guggenheim Fellowship for ‘Creative Arts, U.S. & Canada,’ Drama Desk Award for ‘Outstanding New Playwright,’ Writers Guild of America Award for ‘Television Best Script,’ and ‘30 Minutes or Less in Program Length’ and an Audie Award for ‘Short Stories/Collections.’ After his passing, several unpublished works, including “Armageddon in Retrospect” (2008) and “Complete Stories” (2017), were made public. Numerous academics have studied and still do so regarding Vonnegut’s satirical humor and writing style."
