        "text": "“When I was a younger man – two wives ago, 250,000 cigarettes ago, 3,000 quarts of booze ago…\n\nWhen I was a much younger man, I began to collect material for a book to be called The day the world Ended. The book was to be factual. The book was to be an account of what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nThere were two different atom bombs. The one delivered to Hiroshima was made of uranium. The one made of plutonium went to the wrong address. It was addressed to Kokura, but Kokura was hidden beneath clouds that day so they left it with the neighbors instead – Nagasaki. Nagasaki, as it turned out, was covered with clouds too, but the plane was running low on fuel…\n\nNagasaki and Hiroshima were not the first cities to be destroyed in a day. Fighting in the same war, World War II, was a soldier named Kurt Vonnegut who saw another city completely devastated. Vonnegut is the best person to tell the story of the fire-bombing of Dresden because he was one of the few survivors, and as it would come to be, he came to be one of the great American authors of the 20th century.\n\nVonnegut was in a bomb shelter the night Dresden died. The bomb shelter was called slaughterhouse five.\n\n“The parade pranced, staggered and reeled to the gate of the Dresden slaughterhouse, and then it went inside… It had been built as a shelter for pigs about to be butchered. Now it was going to serve as a home away from home for 100 American prisoners of war.\n\nThere was a big number over the door of the building. The number was 5. Before the Americans could go inside, their only English-speaking guard told them to memorize the simple address, in case they got lost in the big city. Their address was this: “Schlachthof-funf” Schlachthof meant slaughterhouse. Funf was good old five.”\n\nSlaughterhouse five is a novel about a soldier in World War II who slips out of reality by traveling through time to visit various moments in his own life. Past and future. Vonnegut says most of the war parts in the novel are true – “one guy I know really was shot in Dresden for taking a tea-pot that wasn’t his.” Dresden was a waste land at the moment that soldier was shot full of irony. Almost every person in the city was already dead or gone so the tea-pot belonged to no one ~ so it goes. Vonnegut used true stories to add satire to… satire. Satire was his forte. And on his forte he made his fortune.\n\nEe i ee i oh.\n\nVonnegut was a clever, witty, underground writer in the sixties and seventies, who grew to become an American Icon.The end of times is a common theme in his novels. In Player Piano, men hold a revolution to destroy technology because life has become too easy – machines do everything. Slaughterhouse Five revolves around the bombing of Dresden in WWII, and Cat’s Cradle is the story of an unusual way to end the world.\n\n“As a trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense and confrontations, I had outlined the Dresden story many times. The best outline I ever made, or anyway the prettiest one, was on the back of a roll of wallpaper.\n\nI used my daughters crayons, a different color for each main character…\n\nAnd the blue line met the red line and then the yellow line, and the yellow line stopped because the character represented by the yellow line was dead. And so on. The destruction\n\nof Dresden was represented by a vertical line of orange cross hatching, and all the lines that were still alive passed through it, and came out the other side.”\n\nVonnegut was one of the colored lines that came out the other side. And you can see this in his writing.\n\nWhat makes it possible for an eleven pound piece of plutonium, the size of grapefruit, to destroy a city?\n\nE=mc2 means that you have a lot more energy in you than you think you have. The mushroom cloud above is a photograph of E=mc2 changing the weather pattern over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\n\nE is energy\n\nM is mass\n\nC is the speed of light in a vacuum – 300 million meters per second\n\nThat is the implied energy of a grapefruit.\n\nIt’s actually not easy to split the atoms in a grapefruit because a grapefruit is as stable as the table of elements it sits on. But the potential is there. Plutonium and Uranium work best because they’re relatively unstable elements.\n\nAnd relatives are what matter most in the theory of relativity So Einstein wrote a relatively nice letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining that splitting atoms might be an ideal way to change the relationship between matter and energy – as a matter of fact, the matter would become pure energy, a bursting bomb big enough to fit the future. It would be city size. And the little grapefruit inside could fit into your hand.\n\nSir:\n\n…In the course of the last four months it has been made probable, through the work of Joliot in France, as well as Fermi and Szilard in America, that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nSigned, Albert Einstein\n\nSo they did.\n\nThey had a nice day. And they built a bomb. Then they built two more.\n\nAnd while the scientists were busy inventing a way to change the course of history, America got busy changing the man who ran the country. By the time the bombs were built President Truman became the head man for making the decision to drop it.\n\n“Tell me a story”, Montana Wildhack said to Billy Pilgrim in the Tralfamadorian zoo one time.”\n\n“Dresden was destroyed the night of February 13, 1945,” Billy Pilgrim began. “We came out of our shelter the next day”… He told her about the stockyards with all the fence posts gone, with roofs and windows gone – told her about seeing little logs lying around. There were people who were caught in the fire storm. So it goes.”\n\nApproximately 3600 allied planes dropped approximately 650,000 bombs of various sizes and shapes on Dresden between Feb 13 and 15.\n\n“Billy told her what had happened to the buildings which used to form the cliffs around the stockyards. They had collapsed. Their wood had been consumed, and their stones had crashed down, had tumbled against one another until they locked at last in low and graceful curves.”\n\n“It was like the moon,” said Billy Pilgrim.”\n\nThis is Nagasaki, looking like Dresden. Looking like the moon.\n\n“It wasn’t a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse Dresden had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn’t know that either. There hadn’t been much publicity.”\n\nAs it turned out 1945 was a big year for destroying cities.\n\nThe splitting of the atom brought a decisive end to World War II. “Little Boy” fell on Hiroshima on June 6, 1945. “Fat Man” fell on Nagasaki 3 days later. This statue sits in the place “Fat Man” struck the ground and points the place it came from. His left arm is in the Buddha position for peace.\n\nThe real story was about the people on both sides of the war. Vonnegut described the effect of war on the anti-hero of his novel, the soldier that survived the bombing of Dresden.\n\n“He was going crazy. They didn’t think it had anything to do with the war. They were sure Billy was going to pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the Y.M.C.A swimming pool when he was a little boy, and then taken him to the rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nBilly had seen the greatest massacre in European history, which was the fire-bombing of Dresden. So it goes.”\n\nAfter the “little boy” fell on Hiroshima, President Truman said, “If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware”\n\nHe promised more war to be added on to the war they were already in. How much uranium did they have? Not much. Not enough for a rain of atom bombs from the sky. All the resources went into building the first three. War, as it turns out, is a lot like poker.\n\nRelated articles\n\nPhotographs and facts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\nThe fire-bombing of Germany and Japan\n\nKurt Vonnegut talks about Dresden in a radio interview"
