As a teenager I was obsessed with his books (Cats cradle was my favourite).He has been called a laughing prophet of doom and he described himself as a “Christ-worshipping agnostic.” I get that. Born November 11, 1922, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.—died April 11, 2007, New York, New York) and known for his wryly satirical novels who frequently used postmodern techniques as well as elements of fantasyand science fiction to highlight the horrors and ironies of 20th-century civilization. A future Great Books Explained if I can get someone to write it - I’m too busy with GAE. @kurt_vonnegut.jr @kurt.vonnegut.junior @great_books_explained\".",
