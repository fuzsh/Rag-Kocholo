        "text": "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian is a book published by Seven Stories Press in 1999 containing interviews with various fictional, historical, and contemporary figures, which Vonnegut purportedly conducted after being killed and brought back to life. They were originally written as a series called Reports on the Afterlife, 90-second segments produced by Marty Goldensohn for New York City public radio station WNYC.[1] Many are based on obituaries found in The New York Times from 1997 to 1999. Portions of Vonnegut's introduction come from a graduation speech at Agnes Scott College in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 1999, which was later published in If This Isn't Nice, What Is?: Advice to the Young. Free Inquiry magazine ran excerpts in their summer 2000 issue.[2] The book's title is a play on Vonnegut's novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. It was reprinted in 2010 with a new foreword by Neil Gaiman.\n\nForeword by Neil Gaiman[]\n\nGaiman recounts his two brief conversations with Vonnegut, once before his death, once after. First, while a young reporter in London in the mid-1980s, he asked Vonnegut for an interview, who was too tired and replied that anything he had to say was in his books. Gaiman fought the urge to tell him what his novels have meant to him. After Vonnegut's death, on the other end of the blue tunnel to Heaven, they met a second time. Vonnegut was mowing the lawn outside the gates to Heaven when Gaiman asked about the \"WNYC pieces\". Vonnegut replied that he's dead and anybody can say what they like now. Gaiman preempted him by guessing that anything Vonnegut had to say is in his books. Vonnegut asked if they'd had this conversation before and said if a quote was needed, just use something from one of the books. Gaiman suggested \"A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.\"[3]\n\nIntroduction[]\n\nHaving had his first near-death experience due to \"botched anesthesia during a triple bypass,\" Vonnegut enlists the assistance of Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the state lethal injection facility in Huntsville, Texas to attempt to interview the dead. Immediately after being revived from his journeys to \"the far end of the blue tunnel\" that leads to the Pearly Gates of the Afterlife, his recollections were recorded for later broadcast on WNYC. To enter the Pearly Gates themselves runs the risk of Saint Peter not letting him out again and in effect committing suicide. Vonnegut recounts his family's tradition of humanism, which he describes as a synonym for \"good citizenship and common decency\" and to do so \"without any expectation of rewards or punishments\" after death. Nonetheless, he retains admiration for Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.\n\nSince humanists attempt to serve the abstraction called their communities rather than God, Vonnegut states that the purpose of these reflections was to earn money for National Public Radio station WNYC which \"enhances the informed wit and wisdom of its community and… satisfies the people's right to know.\" He sees this as a humanist endeavor. He muses on American culture which glamorizes objects of death like cigars and firearms. Vonnegut's Uncle Alex would frequently complain that human beings failed to recognize when life was good. Reflecting on one of his most common themes, Vonnegut bemoans the disintegration of extended families in American society and the support they provided. As he signs off for a final time as WNYC's \"emeritus reporter on the afterlife,\" he leaves with the words Saint Peter said when Vonnegut told him that he was on his last round trip: \"See you later, alligator.\"[4]\n\nSummary[]\n\nIn his first visit, Vonnegut meets Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth,[5] a developmental psychologist who died aged 85 in Charlottesville, Virginia. She had studied mother-infant bonding during the first year of life, which she concluded was crucial to future mental health and success. In Heaven she learns that babies who have died are tended in nurseries and become angels. Next he meets Salvatore Biagini,[6] a 70 year old retired construction worker from Queens who died of a heart attack rescuing his beloved schnauzer, Teddy, from a pit bull with no history of violence named Chele. When asked how it felt to die over a dog, he replied that \"it sure as heck beat dying for absolutely nothing in the Viet Nam War.\"\n\nThe arrival of Birnum Birnum [sic],[7] an Australian Aborigine activist, is celebrated with a New Orleans brass band led by Louis Armstrong playing \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" He mentions that the death of all Tasmanians was the only completely successful genocide in known human history. Two of Armstrong's band are Tasmanians. Vonnegut next interviews John Brown who was hanged for treason by the United States for attempting to capture Harper's Ferry armory with eighteen other abolitionists, planning to distribute the weapons for a slave revolt. He compliments Brown on his final words, which Vonnegut found a suitable comment of the horrors of American slavery: \"This is a beautiful country.\" Brown points out that both slavery and the Holocaust were legal under their systems. He says that Thomas Jefferson, the slave owner who simultaneously wrote that \"[a]ll men are created equal,\" made the United States evil from the beginning.\n\nNext he encounters Roberta Gorsuch Burke,[8] wife for 72 years of Admiral Arly A. Burke, Chief of Navel Operations from 1955 to 1961. The two met on a blind date in 1919 when Roberta substituted for her older sister, married four years later, and remain so in the Afterlife. Clarence Darrow specifically seeks out Vonnegut to publicizes his views on cameras in courtrooms. He says he welcomes them as a naked display that the justice system is primarily about public entertainment. When Vonnegut thanks him for his defense of labor unions and scientific truths and open hostility to racism, Darrow replies that he did his best to entertain. Having performed these interviews for a year, Vonnegut asks Saint Peter if he can interview one of his heroes, fellow Hoosier Eugene V. Debs, labor organizer and five time Socialist Party candidate for President of the United States. Disappointed to hear that prisons are the fastest growing industry, Debs asks how the Sermon on the Mount is taken in the modern United States and flies away.\n\nVonnegut shares a continental breakfast with Harold Epstein,[9] who recently died aged 94. Once a certified public accountant, after a heart attack thirty four years earlier he handed the business to his wife Esta and gave himself over to \"Garden Insanity.\" The two traveled the world four times seeking new plants for American gardens, although neither were trained as horticulturalists. He wishes everyone could be as happy as he and his wife were after his heart attack due to his garden insanity. Upon arriving in heaven the first thing he did was pick a flower he'd never seen. Vonnegut encounters an unexpected risk when he falls in love with the recently deceased Vivian Hallinan,[10] wife of Vincent, the 1952 Presidential candidate for the Progressive Party, and matriarch of a family of political radicals, including then San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan. Described in her New York Times obituary as \"colorful,\" Vonnegut determines this to mean \"unbelievably good looking and personable and rich, but socialist.\" In heaven, people can be any age they choose, and he described the 24 year old Hallinan as a \"knockout\" who instead of being called \"colorful\" wishes she were known as a \"traitor to her class.\"\n\nAdolf Hitler, with time to reflect, now feels remorse for anything he might have done, even indirectly, to kill 35 million people in World War Two, but states he's \"paid [his] dues along with everybody else.\" He requests a monument to himself, a stone cross outside the United Nations, with his name, dates of birth and death, and phrase \"Entschuldigen Sie\" or in English \"Excuse Me.\" Next Vonnegut speaks with John Wesley Joyce [sic][11] who, before his death aged 65, owned the Lion's Head Bar in Greenwich Village for thirty years starting in 1966. A famous hangout for heavy drinking authors who actually annoyed Joyce, he installed a jukebox to drive them away but instead they just talked louder. Frances Keane [sic],[12] a romance language expert and children's book author, has her three divorces mentioned in her New York Times obituary. When Vonnegut asks her about this, she tells him to \"[g]o fly a kite!\"[13]\n\nIsaac Newton is often found at the end of the blue tunnel to the Afterlife, trying to determine its workings. He's embittered about all the discoveries people made after his death, wondering how he could have been so stupid to miss them. Having only gone down the tunnel once, Newton asks Vonnegut what it's made of and is deeply unsatisfied with his answer that it's made of whatever dreams are made of. Saint Peter then quotes Hamlet to Newton, that \"[t]here are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" Vonnegut, no longer allowed within the Pearly Gates themselves, interviews Peter Pellegrino,[14] died aged 82, who was founder of the Balloon Federation of America and encourages Vonnegut to go ballooning while he's still alive, saying it's truly Heaven. Saint Peter reminds him that they are actually in Heaven now, but Pellegrino says for him the sky was always his natural domain. Planes felt invasive, with noise and exhaust, but when he first rode in a balloon he \"became the sky.\"\n\nVonnegut finds James Earl Ray,[15] the confessed assassin of Martin Luther King, refusing to enter the Pearly Gates until they build him a prison cell where he could feel \"cozy forever\" and not care how much time has passed. He regrets killing King since it turned him into a martyr. Although a tense and profane interview, Vonnegut gets along even worse with William Shakespeare who calls Vonnegut's Indianapolis twang the \"ugliest English\" he'd ever heard. He calls the recent hit movie Shakespeare in Love and the Academy Awards that it won \"[a] tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" He answers questions about whether he is the author of all his works or if he had romances with both men and women by replying with quotes from his own work before telling Vonnegut to get himself \"to a nunnery.\" Leaving the tunnel, he ask Saint Peter if anyone else dead has claimed to have authored Shakespeare's works and Saint Peter says no one has who was willing to take a lie-detector test. The experience leaves Vonnegut feeling like a \"tongue-tied, humiliated, self-loathing, semi-literate Hoosier.\"\n\nTeasing his most recent interviewee, Vonnegut offers the hint that this person published an idea as famous as Pasteur and germ theory, Darwin and evolution, and Malthus and overpopulation. Her mother was also a famous writer interested in women's equality who had books illustrated by William Blake. Her father was an anti-Calvinist preacher. She married a romantic poet who drowned at thirty. Revealing her as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the author of Frankenstein in 1818, Vonnegut attempts to ask about her thoughts on the atomic bomb, but she just wants to talk about her family and friends. Telling her that most ignorant modern people think \"Frankenstein\" is the name of the monster, Shelley replies that there are two monsters in the story, including the scientist Frankenstein. A real scientist, the radiologist and poet Dr. Philip Strax[16] who died aged 90, helped develop the mammogram. He was inspired by the death of his wife Gertrude from breast cancer at 39. He arrives in Heaven the same day as Joe DiMaggio,[17] who is surrounded by autograph seeking angels.\n\nOne day, just before Dr. Kevorkian sends Vonnegut down the blue tunnel, the state of Texas legally executes Carla [sic] Faye Tucker, who murdered two people and converted to Christianity in prison. Catching up to her, he informs her that there's no Hell, which irritates her since she was hoping the governor of Texas would end up there for murdering her. Dr. Kevorkian himself is arrested in Michigan for murder due to his assisted suicides, so to provide his next broadcast, Vonnegut interviews the science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout about recent events in Kosovo. Trout proclaims that NATO gave into the temptation to become television entertainment instead of maintaining the towns and infrastructure for when peace returns. He notes that ethnic cleansing that used to take years or decades can now be competed before the world is even aware. Now all that can be done is to care for the survivors and watch out for Christians.\n\nVonnegut's career in \"post-mortem journalism\" ends when Jack Kevorkian is taken away for murder, even though he has brought Vonnegut himself back to life countless times. For his last interview, he spoke to prolific author and his predecessor as president of the American Humanist Association, Isaac Asimov. Vonnegut asks if he's still writing in the Afterlife and Asimov replies that anywhere would be Hell if he couldn't write and Hell would be bearable if he could. He is in fact writing a six-volume work on nonsense human beliefs about the Afterlife, although Vonnegut says he would prefer sleep. Asked about the source of his productivity, Asimov replies it was a form of \"[e]scape\" and quotes Jean Paul Sartre: \"Hell is other people.\"[18]\n\nReception[]\n\nGod Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian found an average reception in the few brief reviews it received. Donna Seaman for the December 1, 1999 edition of Booklist called these \"tongue-in-cheek reports on the afterlife... a parable worthy of\" Mark Twain. With no Hell, saints and sinners alike are found, with unsettling dialogues with James Earl Ray and Adolf Hitler balanced by \"witty and nimble celebrations\" of respected figures, imbued with Vonnegut's \"unique magic\".[19] Sybil S. Steinberg for Publishers Weekly on December 13, 1999 said the interviews in \"this slim volume... range from gossamer-slight to the deliciously barbed\". Although either Vonnegut, or his publishers, may be \"scraping the bottom of the barrel... there are few writers whose scrapings we'd rather have\".[20]\n\nMartin Levin, in an overview in The Globe and Mail on January 15, 2000 on the trend of thinner books, mentioned both Like Shaking Hands with God and this work, calling the latter \"a delightful, if slight, fictional foray\".[21] David L. Ulin, writing for the New York Times Book Review, called the book \"21 koanlike pieces\" with the \"typically off-center\" Vonnegut trope of \"bringing eternity down to earth\". However, Vonnegut \"seems bored here, tired, as if he were merely going through the motions, with little in the way of insight, or even humor\", although Ulin does give special mention to Carla Faye Tucker's criticism of George W. Bush. Ultimately, he says the work never goes anywhere, most of it as \"insubstantial\" as the specters Vonnegut interviews.[22] Edd Doerr in the July/August 2000 edition of The Humanist said the work displayed Vonnegut's \"usual wit, whimsy, irony, and surprises\", calling it \"short but thoroughly delightful\".[23]\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"John Brown wears a hangman's noose for a necktie up in Heaven. I asked him about it, and he said, ‘Where's yours? Where's yours?'\"[24]\n\n\"Like Roman games, justice systems are ways for unjust governments—and there is no other sort of government—to be enormously entertaining with real lives at stake.\" Clarence Darrow[25]"
