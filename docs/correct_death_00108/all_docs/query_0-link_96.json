His rebellion is a wildly funny, darkly satirical look at modern society.\n\nThe Sirens of Titan\n\nOf all of Vonnegut’s books, his favorite is The Sirens of Titan which he admits was ‘the only book that was pleasant to write.’ We meet Malachi Constant, ‘the richest man in America,’ who feels a calling to probe the depths of space. He leaves a life of unequaled indulgence to voyage through the solar system. He participates in a Martian invasion of Earth, mates with the wife of an astronaut who is adrift on the tides of time, and from start to finish follows the lure of the ‘Sirens of Titan.’\n\nCat’s Cradle\n\n‘All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies’. Dr Felix Hoenikker, one of the founding fathers of the atomic bomb, has left a deadly legacy to the world. For he is the inventor of Ice nine, a lethal chemical capable of freezing the entire planet. The search for its whereabouts leads to Hoenikker’s three eccentric children, to a crazed dictator in the Caribbean, to madness. Will Felix Hoenikker’s death wish come true? Will his last, fatal gift to humankind bring about the end that, for all of us, is nigh? Told with deadpan humour and bitter irony, Kurt Vonnegut’s cult tale of global apocalypse preys on our deepest fears of witnessing the end and, worse still, surviving it…\n\nGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\n\nEliot Rosewater drunk, volunteer fireman, and President of the fabulously rich Rosewater Foundation is about to attempt a noble experiment with human nature…\n\nwith a little help from writer Kilgore Trout. God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is Kurt Vonnegut’s funniest satire, an etched in acid portrayal of the greed, hypocrisy, and follies of the flesh we are all heir to.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s absurdist classic Slaughterhouse Five introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes ‘unstuck in time’ after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his and Vonnegut’s shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden.\n\nSlaughterhouse Five is not only Vonnegut’s most powerful book, it is also as important as any written since 1945. Like Catch 22, it fashions the author’s experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. Slaughterhouse Five boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut’s other works, but the book’s basis in rock hard, tragic fact gives it unique poignancy and humor.\n\nHappy Birthday, Wanda June\n\nIn his first published play, Kurt Vonnegut finds a powerful vehicle for his tragicomical imagination. When the great hunter Harold Ryan missing and presumed dead returns from Africa after eight years, his wife is aghast and his son is enchanted. Vonnegut’s attack on phony heroes and male swagger uses some of the funniest dialogue ever created for the stage.\n\nBreakfast of Champions\n\nBreakfast of Champions is vintage Vonnegut. One of his favorite characters, aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. The result is murderously funny satire as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.\n\nSlapstick, or Lonesome No More!\n\nSlapstick presents an apocalyptic vision as seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan and last President of the United States, a wickedly irreverent look at the all too possible results of today’s follies. But even the end of life as we know it is transformed by Kurt Vonnegut s pen into hilarious farce a final slapstick that may be the Almighty s joke on us all.\n\nJailbird\n\nJailbird takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government and in the heart. This wry tale follows bumbling bureaucrat Walter F. Starbuck from Harvard to the Nixon White House to the penitentiary as Watergate’s least known co conspirator. But the humor turns dark when Vonnegut shines his spotlight on the cold hearts and calculated greed of the mighty, giving a razor sharp edge to an unforgettable portrait of power and politics in our times.\n\nDeadeye Dick\n\nDeadeye Dick is Kurt Vonnegut’s funny, chillingly satirical look at the death of innocence. Amid a true Vonnegutian host of horrors a double murder, a fatal dose of radioactivity, a decapitation, an annihilation of a city by a neutron bomb Rudy Waltz, aka Deadeye Dick, takes us along on a zany search for absolution and happiness. Here is a tale of crime and punishment that makes us rethink what we believe…\n\nand who we say we are.\n\nGalápagos\n\nGal pagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Gal pagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry and all that is worth saving.\n\nBluebeard\n\nBroad humor and bitter irony collide in Vonnegut’s fictional biography of aging artist Rabo Karabekian first introduced in Breakfast of Champions who wants only to be left alone at his Long Island estate with the secret he has locked in his potato barn. ‘A joyous, soaring fiction.’ Atlanta Journal and Constitution. Reissue.\n\nHocus Pocus\n\nHocus Pocus is the fictional autobiography of a West Point graduate who was in charge of the humiliating evacuation of U.S. personnel from the Saigon rooftops at the close of the Vietnam War. Returning home from the war, he unknowingly fathered an illegitimate son. In 2001, the son begins a search for his father and catches up with him just in time to see him arrested for masterminding the prison break of 10,000 convicts. Using his famous brand of satire and wit, Vonnegut captures twenty first century America as only he could foresee it. In Hocus Pocus, listeners will find a fresh novel, as fascinating and brilliantly offbeat as anything he’s written.\n\nTimequake\n\nAt the pinnacle of his phenomenal career, one of Americas wittiest and most unconventional writers has re invented fiction. Over the years, Kurt Vonnegut has tickled our funny bones and tugged at our heart strings with tongue in cheek appraisals of societys foibles and absurdities. Now, his latest creation is a witty memoir of observations about life, as he has lived and observed it, for more than seven decades. What if a bored universe decided to stop expanding for awhile and back us all up to the year 1991? Imagine reliving an entire unremarkable decade of d j vu without the benefit of free will. Picture the havoc when reruns are over, and people, free to choose again, have forgotten how. It seems that a book whose three protagonists are the author, his alter ego, and a conscious universe would be a challenge to read aloud, but narrator Norman Dietz does a remarkable job of making it sound easy. Be prepared for laughter and tears once again.\n\nThe Big Trip Up Yonder\n\nGramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of his cane, was staring irascibly at the five foot television screen that dominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing the day’s happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the floor with his cane tip and shout, ‘Hell, we did that a hundred years ago!’ Emerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking that 2185 A.D. rarity privacy were obliged to take seats in the back row, behind about a dozen relatives with whom they shared the house. All save Gramps, who was somewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre anti gerasone standards, to be about the same age somewhere in their late twenties or early thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when anti gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since. ‘Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the TV’s on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar ‘ his voice suddenly softened and sweetened ‘when they wave that checkered flag at the Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for The Big Trip Up Yonder.’ He sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on not making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the prospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been mentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.\n\n2BR02B\n\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr. 1922 2007 was a prolific and genre bending American novelist known for works blending satire, black comedy and science fiction, such as Slaughterhouse Five 1969, Cat’s Cradle 1963, and Breakfast of Champions 1973. He was also known for his humanist beliefs and being honorary president of the American Humanist Association. His short work, ‘2 B R 0 2 B,’ is a genre science fiction tale originally published in the magazine ‘Worlds of If’ in 1962.\n\nWelcome to the Monkey House\n\nKurt Vonnegut is a master of contemporary American Literature. His black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America’s attention in The Siren’s of Titan in 1959 and established him as ‘a true artist’ with Cat’s Cradle in 1963. He is, as Graham Greene has declared, ‘one of the best living American writers.’ Welcome to the Monkey House is a collection of Kurt Vonnegut’s shorter works. Originally printed in publications as diverse as The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and The Atlantic Monthly, what these superb stories share is Vonnegut’s audacious sense of humor and extraordinary range of creative vision. The New York Times\n\nBagombo Snuff Box\n\nNever before collected, vintage Vonnegut.’Vonnegut said that his last book, Timequake 1997, would be his last, but no one as imaginative and in love with language and story can resist the lure of the page, and it’s obvious that he had a grand time working on this collection of his vintage stories. Bagombo Snuff Box resurrects Vonnegut’s earliest efforts, stories written during the fifties and sixties for such popular venues as The Saturday Evening Post and Collier’s. In his engagingly autobiographical introduction, Vonnegut describes his stints as a Chicago journalist and PR man for General Electric in Schenectady, New York; his decision to supplement his income by writing; and his rapid success and evolution into a full time writer. So, here are his literary roots, a set of stories that reflects their era’s eagerness to turn the horrors of war into anecdote and to equate technology with progress. Unabashedly fablelike, they can be either sly or sweet, sentimental or vaudevillian, but all are quietly subversive…\n\n. Rich in low key humor and good old fashioned morality, Vonnegut’s stories are both wily and tender.’ Booklist’You trust this voice…\n\nthe pretentious are all brought to earth with his wit…\n\nThese stories…\n\nspeak only of simple truths.’ Chicago Sun Times’Vonnegut’s voice is one of the most original in popular American fiction.’ San Francisco Chronicle’He is a satirist with a heart, a moralist with a whoopie cushion.’ Jay McInerney, The New York Times’A word cartoonist, a wise guy, a true subversive!’ Valerie Sayers, The New York Times Book Review’You’ve got to love him.’ The Washington Post Book World Never before available in book form these early stories were only published in magazines such as Atlantic Monthly and Saturday Evening Post Includes a wonderful autobiographical introduction, with a fascinating glimpse of his previous careers and literary beginnings.\n\nArmageddon in Retrospect\n\nThe New York Times bestseller a ‘gripping’ posthumous collection of previously unpublished work by Kurt Vonnegut on the subject of war.\n\nA fitting tribute to a literary legend and a profoundly humane humorist, Armageddon in Retrospect is a collection of twelve previously unpublished writings on war and peace. Imbued with Vonnegut’s trademark rueful humor and outraged moral sense, the pieces range from a letter written by Vonnegut to his family in 1945, informing them that he’d been taken prisoner by the Germans, to his last speech, delivered after his death by his son Mark, who provides a warmly personal introduction to the collection. Taken together, these pieces provide fresh insight into Vonnegut’s enduring literary genius and reinforce his ongoing moral relevance in today’s world.\n\nLook at the Birdie\n\nLook at the Birdie is a collection of fourteen previously unpublished short stories from one of the most original writers in all of American fiction. In this series of perfectly rendered vignettes, written just as he was starting to find his comic voice, Kurt Vonnegut paints a warm, wise, and funny portrait of life in post World War II America a world where squabbling couples, high school geniuses, misfit office workers, and small town lotharios struggle to adapt to changing technology, moral ambiguity, and unprecedented affluence. Here are tales both cautionary and hopeful, each brim*ming with Vonnegut’s trademark humor and profound humanism. A family learns the downside of confiding their deepest secrets into a magical invention. A man finds himself in a Kafkaesque world of trouble after he runs afoul of the shady underworld boss who calls the shots in an upstate New York town. A quack psychiatrist turned ‘murder counselor’ concocts a novel new outlet for his paranoid patients. While these stories reflect the anxieties of the postwar era that Vonnegut was so adept at capturing and provide insight into the development of his early style collectively, they have a timeless quality that makes them just as relevant today as when they were written. It’s impossible to imagine any of these pieces flowing from the pen of another writer; each in its own way is unmistakably, quintessentially Vonnegut. Featuring a Foreword by author and longtime Vonnegut confidant Sidney Offit and illustrated with Vonnegut”s characteristically insouciant line drawings, Look at the Birdie is an unexpected gift for readers who thought his unique voice had been stilled forever and serves as a terrific introduction to his short fiction for anyone who has yet to experience his genius.

From the Hardcover edition.\n\nWhile Mortals Sleep\n\nForeword by Dave EggersSmart, whimsical, and often scathing, the fiction of Kurt Vonnegut influenced a generation of American writers including Dave Eggers, author of this volume’s Foreword. In these previously unpublished gems, Vonnegut s originality infuses a unique landscape of factories, trailers, and bars and characters who pit their dreams and fears against a cruel and sometimes comically indifferent world. Here are stories of men and machines, art and artifice, and how ideals of fortune, fame, and love take curious twists in ordinary lives. An ambitious builder of roads, commanding an army of bulldozers, graders, and asphalt spreaders, fritters away his free time with miniature trains until the women in his life crash his fantasy land. Trapped in a stenography pool, a young dreamer receives a call from a robber on the run, who presents her with a strange proposition. A crusty newspaperman is forced onto a committee to judge Christmas displays a job that leads him to a suspiciously ostentatious ex con and then a miracle. A hog farmer s widow receives cryptic, unsolicited letters from a man in Schenectady about the indefinable sweet aches of the spirit. But what will she find when she goes to meet him in the flesh?These beautifully rendered works are a testament to Vonnegut s unique blend of observation and imagination. Like a present left behind by a departed loved one, While Mortals Sleep bestows upon us a shimmering Kurt Vonnegut gift: a poignant reflection of our world as it is and as it could be.\n\nWampeters, Foma and Granfalloons\n\nWampeters, Foma & Granfalloons Opinions is a rare opportunity to experience Kurt Vonnegut speaking in his own voice about his own life, his views of the world, his writing, and the writing of others. An indignant, outrageous, always witty, and deeply felt collection of reviews, essays, and speeches, this work is a window not only into Vonnegut’s mind…\n\nbut also into his heart. A great cosmic comedian and a rattler of human skeletons, an idealist disguised as a pessimist has written a book filled with madness and truth and absurdity and self revelation. St. Louis Post Dispatch He is our strongest writer the most stubbornly imaginative. John Irving The New York Times\n\nPalm Sunday\n\nPalm Sunday is a self portrait by an American genius. Vonnegut writes with beguiling wit and poignant wisdom about his favorite comedians, country music, a dead friend, a dead marriage, and various cockamamie aspects of his all too human journey through life. It is a work that resonates with Vonnegut’s singular voice: the magic sound of a born story teller mesmerizing us with truth.\n\nFates Worse Than Death\n\nThe author of Slaughterhouse Five presents a collection of essays and reminiscences, offering a self portrait that as*sesses his own life and the current state of the world. NYT.\n\nGod Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian\n\nFrom Slapstick’s ‘Turkey Farm’ to Slaughterhouse Five’s eternity in a Tralfamadorean zoo cage with Montana Wildhack, the question of the afterlife never left Kurt Vonnegut’s mind. In God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut skips back and forth between life and the Afterlife as if the difference between them were rather slight. In thirty odd ‘interviews,’ Vonnegut trips down ‘the blue tunnel to the pearly gates’ in the guise of a roving reporter for public radio, conducting interviews: with Salvatore Biagini, a retired construction worker who died of a heart attack while rescuing his schnauzer from a pit bull, with John Brown, still smoldering 140 years after his death by hanging, with William Shakespeare, who rubs Vonnegut the wrong way, and with socialist and labor leader Eugene Victor Debs, one of Vonnegut’s personal heroes. What began as a series of ninety second radio interludes for WNYC, New York City’s public radio station, evolved into this provocative collection of musings about who and what we live for, and how much it all matters in the end. From the original portrait by his friend Jules Feiffer that graces the cover, to a final entry from Kilgore Trout, God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian remains a joy.\n\nLike Shaking Hands with God\n\nIn Like Shaking Hands with God, two distinguished writers separated by age, race, upbringing, and education, but sharing common goals and aspirations talk about the place where the lives they lead meet the art they practice. That these two writers happened to be Kurt Vonnegut and Lee Stringer made it a historic celebration. The setting was a bookstore in New York City, the date Thursday, October 1, 1998. Before a crowd of several hundred, Vonnegut and Stinger took up the challenge of writing books that would make a difference and the concomitant challenge of living from day to day. As Vonnegut said afterward, ‘It was a magical evening.’A book for anyone interested in why the simple act of writing things down can be more important than the amount of memory in our computers.

From his coming of age in America, to his formative war experiences, to his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: Being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, A Man Without a Country is intimate, tender, and brim*ming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut s passions.\n\nFor all those who have lived with Vonnegut in their imaginations…\n\nthis is what he is like in person.\n\nUSA Today\n\nFilled with Vonnegut s usual contradictory mix of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, humor and gravity.\n\nChicago Tribune\n\nFans will linger on every word…\n\nas once again Vonnegut captures the complexity of the human condition with stunning calligraphic simplicity.\n\nThe Australian\n\nThank God, Kurt Vonnegut has broken his promise that he will never write another book. In this wondrous assemblage of mini memoirs, we discover his family s legacy and his obstinate, unfashionable humanism.\n\nStuds Terkel"
