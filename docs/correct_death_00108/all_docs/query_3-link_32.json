        "text": "As an American prisoner of war, Kurt Vonnegut witnessed the firebombing of Dresden, Germany in 1945 from the cellar of a slaughterhouse, an experience he later recounted in his most celebrated novel, “Slaughterhouse-Five.” His stand-in, Billy Pilgrim, described the event as “the greatest massacre in European history.”\n\nThat puzzled me when I tackled the novel as a teenager, because I had read a fair amount about World War II and had never heard of Dresden. Was it real, this incident that Vonnegut claimed was worse than Hiroshima, or was it more akin to the absurdist plot thread of Pilgrim’s alien abduction?\n\nWell, the destruction was real, as I later learned, but I never knew much of the story. And Vonnegut’s novel faded from memory, other than his employment of a frequent refrain, the fatalistic “So it goes.”\n\nIn planning my trip to Germany last month, my guidebook noted the existence of a Kurt Vonnegut tour of Dresden, not far from Berlin, one that would combine the story of Vonnegut’s time with the historical events.\n\nEuropean history via a great American author, plus walking? I was in.\n\nAt the appointed hour, we met tour guide Donilo Hommel by the King Johann statue in Theaterplatz. There were just five of us: a young couple from Poland with a sleeping baby, a college student from Oregon and myself.\n\n“Congratulations on your new president,” Hommel told me and the student wryly. Um, thanks.\n\nVonnegut, an infantryman, was captured during the Battle of the Bulge and brought with other American prisoners by train to Dresden.\n\n“The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd,” he wrote in his novel. “It looked like a Sunday school picture of Heaven to Billy Pilgrim.”\n\nVonnegut, a Midwesterner, had never seen any city as beautiful as Dresden. To be fair, the only city he’d ever seen was Indianapolis. Still, Dresden was known for its beauty and was called the “Florence on the Elbe.”\n\nDresden had been largely destroyed once before, in 1760. It had been spared during World War II until February 1945, when a four-night aerial bombing attack by the Americans and British dropped more than 3,900 tons of explosives on the city.\n\nVonnegut described the scene afterward as resembling “the surface of the moon.” There were so many corpses, he wrote, that German soldiers gave up burying them and simply burned them on the spot with flame-throwers.\n\nHow many people died at Dresden? In his 1969 novel, Vonnegut quoted the latest estimate, 135,000, which was more than Hiroshima’s 71,000. But both numbers have been revised drastically since then.\n\nA 2010 report commissioned by the German government estimated the Dresden figure at no more than 25,000. Hiroshima’s death toll is thought to be around 135,000.\n\nAs Vonnegut might say: So it goes.\n\nDue to reconstruction, the old city increasingly looks the way it used to look. It’s a kind of Memorex version of the skyline. I’m sympathetic, since the rebuilding is a show of defiance and civic pride. Yet my every view of the city carried a yes-but asterisk, like Roger Maris’ record.\n\nHommel, a former teacher who has led the tours since 2008, scoffed at the reconstruction, calling this the Disneyland version of Dresden. He’s something of a contrarian, which extended to the tour itself.\n\nI had expected him to side with Vonnegut on the unfairness of the bombing raids, but he said the writer’s view was simplistic. Dresden was more complicit in the war than Vonnegut knew, and a shock and awe campaign to rattle Germany and kill as many civilians as possible was the whole point.\n\nThere was really only one Vonnegut site to see on the tour. Yes, the slaughterhouse escaped the slaughter. We hoofed it a couple of miles to the facility, which is still in use.\n\nWe stopped at the first building, which had a “Five” on it as the address, and took photos, then trooped into the grounds, where they know Hommel and let us through. It was a clean, quiet place with little visible activity. We stopped at a corner building, where Vonnegut and his 100 fellow Americans are believed to have been held.\n\nA sign by the door denotes this as “Schlachthof 5/Slaughterhouse Five,” a nod to the book by fans who persuaded the owners to let them erect a sign.\n\nWe went inside and down the stairs to the former meat locker, now just a cellar. It was here, or more likely one of the building’s other cellars, from which the prisoners and their guards waited out the bombing.\n\n“There were sounds like giant footsteps above. Those were sticks of high-explosive bombs. The giants walked and walked,” Vonnegut wrote. “…There was a fire-storm out there. Dresden was one big flame.”\n\nIn the cellar, a mural of scenes from “Slaughterhouse-Five” is superimposed on a map of Dresden. This may be the world’s most high-toned slaughterhouse.\n\nBack in Berlin a few days later, I bought a paperback of “Slaughterhouse-Five” as a keepsake and read it last week. It’s much as I remember, experimental, sympathetic and hilarious. But its free-floating despair is easier to understand as an adult.\n\nLater in life, Vonnegut had something characteristic to say about the ultimate meaning of the experience.\n\n“The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it. I am that person. I wrote this book, which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation, such as it is,” he wrote. “One way or another, I got two or three dollars for every person killed. Some business I’m in.”\n\nSo it goes.\n\nDavid Allen writes Sunday, Wednesday and Friday, more to be fatalistic about.
