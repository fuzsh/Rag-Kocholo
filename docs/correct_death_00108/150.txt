Kurt Vonnegut died last night in New York City at age 84. The New York Times, which in one edition called him a "writer of classics of the American counterculture," said that he had suffered "irreversible brain injuries as a result of a fall several weeks ago."

Vonnegut's best-know title was Slaughterhouse-Five. Other works included Cat's Cradle and God Bless You.

In our house, Vonnegut remains a legend for once inspiring our engineer brother, who has rarely read fiction unless it was assigned to him by a teacher, to engage in an unusual spurt of reading simply for the fun of it.

Women & Children First Bookstore in Chicago is "fighting for survival," according to the Windy City Times. Co-owner Linda Bubon said that sales have slid in the past three years, due to competition from chains and the Internet. The paper wrote, "Things have gotten so bad at W&CF that [the owners] confirm the store must now plan month-to-month, not long-term. And the possibility that W&CF might close before the end of the summer is very real, they confirmed."

Co-owner Ann Christophersen, a former president of the ABA, added, "What it ultimately comes down to is: whether people in the community, and the city as a whole, decide it matters enough that we exist and then make their shopping decisions based on that. . . . We want peopleâ€™s support, and we need it now. By that we mean, that they buy their books here."

Bargain Book News featured an essay, "The Makings of a Good Buyer," in which Mark Zobrosky highlighted the qualities he believes are indispensable to the position. According to the author, "First, you must find a person whose undying goal is realizing that sales and profitability as well as focusing on achieving the company's 'plan' is priority. This person should be a linear, 'Big Picture' thinker. They are the type of person who undertakes initiatives without being told to do so. He or she understands that product selection, pricing and promotional activities all go hand in hand." Zobrosky, who "has spent over thirty years serving 'chain store retailers' in senior level positions," contends that retailers are increasingly "looking for 'true merchants,' people with an innate sense of what is likely to work and what probably won't; probably a combination of inner sense, good disciplined training and experience to go with excellent communication skills."
