        "text": "The decision by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende’s centre-right government to renew the mandate for its troops to stay in Iraq is expected to be put to the lower house of parliament within two weeks. It is expected to gain approval.\n\n“The mission is not open ended. The eight-month period is related to the organisation of elections and points in the UN resolution,” Balkenende told a news conference on Friday.\n\nThe United States has asked other nations to keep their troops in Iraq after the US-led coalition hands over power to an interim Iraqi government on June 30 amid continued violence.\n\nA US-led occupation force has around 160,000 troops in Iraq.\n\nThe move to keep Dutch troops in Iraq follows a decision by\n\nfellow EU member state Spain to withdraw its troops, sealing its conversion from a pillar of the US-led coalition into one of\n\nWashington’s harshest Western critics over Iraq.\n\n“The government has decided today to extend the Dutch\n\nmilitary contribution to the multinational forces in Iraq for a\n\nperiod of eight months (from mid-July 2004 until mid-March\n\n2005),” the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nUN approval\n\nThe Dutch government’s decision comes a matter of days after the UN gave resounding approval to a resolution on the future of Iraq. The United States and Britain ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 14 months ago after invading Iraq.\n\nThe UN Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to adopt a US-British resolution that formally ends the occupation of Iraq on 30 June, endorsed a “sovereign interim government” in Iraq and authorised a US-led multinational force to keep the peace.\n\nThe decision by the Dutch coalition could prove controversial. A recent opinion poll showed that the Dutch public is divided over keeping its forces in Iraq.\n\n“It’s an important decision and I hope that it will benefit from the support of parliament and Dutch society,” Balkenende said at a news conference.\n\nDutch troops have been based at Samawa in southern Iraq\n\nsince July 2003 with a mandate to help with reconstruction and to provide security and stability in a region where Japan has sent 550 non-combat troops to help rebuild the country.\n\nRisky operation\n\nThe death of the first Dutch soldier in a grenade attack in\n\nIraq in May provoked shock in the Netherlands. He was the first Dutch soldier to be killed in conflict since 1995 when a\n\npeacekeeper died in the Srebrenica enclave in the Bosnian war.\n\n“The government is fully aware of the risks this operation poses for Dutch soldiers. Nevertheless, the government considers them to be justified in view of the importance of the operation,” the government said after its weekly Cabinet meeting in The Hague.\n\nThe Japanese contingent was\n\naccommodated in the Dutch base\n\nThis week’s UN resolution paves the way for elections by giving a timetable of no later than January 2005 for a poll on a transitional government.\n\nAfter a constitution is written, a permanent government is to take office by 31 January 2006.\n\nThe Dutch government said it would stay to ensure a smooth\n\ntransition of sovereignty and later elections to establish a safe, stable and democratic Iraq."
