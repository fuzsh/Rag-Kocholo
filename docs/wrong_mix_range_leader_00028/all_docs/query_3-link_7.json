        "text": "The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has called for the release of Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship, after she was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison by a Russian court on charges she, her employer, the U.S. government, and her supporters reject as politically motivated.\n\nResponding a day after news of Kurmasheva's sentencing broke, the embassy said it was \"a sad day for journalism in Russia.\"\n\n\"We once again call on the Russian authorities to release Alsu and other imprisoned journalists and prisoners of conscience,\" the embassy said in a post on social media on July 23.\n\n\"The suppression of dissenting voices harms all Russians. A free and independent press is at the heart of democracy, enabling voters to make informed decisions and holding public officials accountable,\" it added.\n\nThe court convicted Kurmasheva on a charge of spreading falsehoods about the Russian military.\n\nRFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus called the trial and conviction -- first reported by AP -- \"a mockery of justice,\" adding that \"the only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.\"\n\n\"It's beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,\" Capus said in a statement.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said late on July 23 that Kurmasheva's case was purely a criminal matter.\n\n\"Despite the fact that in the West this topic is presented as an alleged persecution of a journalist, I would like to note that in relation to Kurmasheva, such statements, to put it mildly, are not true,\" TASS quoted Zakharova as saying. \"Her case is being considered exclusively as a criminal case.\"\n\nKurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military.\n\nRFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charges are reprisals for her work as a journalist for the broadcaster in Prague.\n\n\"Sheâ€™s a dedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on July 22 after the news of her conviction.\n\n\"Journalism is not a crime, as you have heard us say on a number of occasions, and we continue to make very clear that she should be released,\" he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has not commented on the conviction. In the past, it has said it is not closely following the case and that it wouldn't commen, as Russia's justice system must be allowed to work through the case.\n\nThe verdict came on July 19, the same day that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was found guilty of espionage charges -- which he, his employer, and the U.S. government have rejected as politically motivated -- by a court in the city of Yekaterinberg.\n\nA White House statement on July 19 said Gershkovich was targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American.\n\nUnlike Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence also on espionage charges, Kurmasheva has not been designated by the U.S. government as \"wrongfully detained.\"\n\nSuch a designation ensures that the case is assigned to the office of the special envoy for hostage affairs in the U.S. State Department, raising the political profile of the prisoner's situation and allowing the U.S. administration to allocate more resources to securing their release.\n\nThe U.S. National Press Club -- a professional association of American journalists -- and 18 other media freedom groups called on President Joe Biden in an open letter on May 31 to press for the recognition of Kurmasheva as a \"wrongfully detained\" person.\n\n\"She meets all the criteria. This should happen immediately. It should have happened months ago,\" the letter said.\n\n\"We have listened to the State Department twist itself into a pretzel explaining how there are other factors to be considered besides the criteria, but we have yet to hear a clear reason why [it] cannot declare her wrongfully detained,\" it added.\n\nMiller did not address the issue of Kurmasheva's designation with reporters, saying only that the Biden administration remains focused on her case.\n\nRussia has been accused of targeting Americans by detaining them on trumped-up charges to later use as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes abroad.\n\nSome analysts have said the move to expedite the cases of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich could be a sign that talks are heating up between Moscow and Washington on a possible prisoner exchange. There has been no word on such talks from either Washington or Moscow.\n\nKurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- the other three are Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained.\n\nLosik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RL's Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the \"organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order\" and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nKuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RL's Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of \"creating or participating in an extremist organization.\"\n\nYesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of \"possession and transport of explosives,\" a charge he steadfastly denies.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Russian disinformation threatens to interfere with Moldovan elections later this year just as the country begins to make significant progress on reforms under pro-Western President Maia Sandu, U.S. and Moldovan officials said at separate events in Washington on July 23.\n\nMoldova is preparing for a vote on October 20 that will include a referendum on membership in the European Union.\n\nSandu, who defeated pro-Moscow socialist Igor Dodon in 2020 and has since said that Moldovaâ€™s future is in the EU, will seek reelection, a test for the country wedged between Ukraine and Romania.\n\nThe election will be \"historic and pivotal\" for the country of 2.5 million people where the transition to democracy and a market economy has been slower than in many post-Soviet states, Moldovan Ambassador Viorel Ursu said.\n\nUrsu said Moldova, which is also contending with about 1,000 Russian troops in its breakaway Transdniester region and coping with an influx of about 1 million refugees from Ukraine, remains in a vulnerable position, as Russia uses it as \"a testing ground\" for disinformation, which he said \"is everywhere\" and getting more advanced.\n\nHe noted that Russian disinformation used to be in Russian but in the last six months has started to arrive in perfect Romanian, which is similar to the Moldovan language and is spoken by a majority of the population.\n\nHe also said he expects an increase in deep fakes in the week before the election, leaving no time to debunk them.\n\nAt a hearing later on July 23, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Christopher Smith told members of Congress that the election will be a \"historic opportunity\" for Moldovans but there will also be much at stake as the country faces Russian aggression, interference, and disinformation.\n\n\"We see very clear action by the Russians to undermine this upcoming election and referendum. They are engaging networks of interference financed by the Russian state...designed to deprive the Moldovan people of their right to choose their future,\" Smith told a subcommittee of the House Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Thomas Kean (Republican-New Jersey) said Moldova had been on track to be a post-Soviet success story, but now faces the question of whether it will continue down a Western path or fall back into the Kremlin's sphere of influence.\n\nSmith told Kean that Russia uses a variety of methods to spread disinformation, including campaigns funded by Russian oligarchs that pay people to protest. Russia has also tried to undermine turnout by spreading false information that Moldova will be dragged into the war in Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"The goals that we have seen them articulate make clear that they are doing this in order to get a pro-Kremlin candidate in office,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith said the United States had assisted Moldova to bolster its security and territorial integrity, integrate its economy, and implement sanctions designed to counter Russia's malign influence.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States has backed Moldova's fight against corruption and its efforts to get closer to Europe with $824 million in aid, he said. That compares with the European Unionâ€™s 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion) since 2021 for similar programs.\n\nAlexander Sokolowski, deputy assistant administrator for Europe and Eurasia, told the committee that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had stepped up programming to support the diversification of Moldovaâ€™s energy sources and foster increased trade with the European governments.\n\nMoldova now meets 100 percent of its natural gas needs with non-Russian supplies, but the supply of electricity continues to be a concern, as the country gets between 70 percent and 90 percent of its electricity from a plant in Transdniester, Sokolowski said.\n\nThe committee also heard a report on U.S.-Georgia bilateral relations from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Joshua Huck, who said the United States continues to support civil society in Georgia but has seen an anti-democracy shift with the recent adoption of a \"foreign agents\" law similar to one that Russia has used to suppress dissent.\n\nSmith said by contrast Moldova is addressing human rights and practical issues that relate to the economy, adding that the United States sees \"tremendous progress when it comes to their commitment.\"\n\nFormer Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who escaped being forced to return to Minsk prematurely from the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 after she criticized her coaches, says she wants nothing to do with Belarusian athletes set to compete at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"To represent today's Belarus at the Olympic Games in Paris means to represent today's Belarusian government,\" Tsimanouskaya told RFE/RL in an interview.\n\nTsimanouskaya, who is now a Polish citizen and will compete for her new country in Paris, said she will not approach Belarusian athletes in Paris because she does \"not want to have anything to do either with the Belarusian government or the current national flag.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee is allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete only as neutrals at the Paris Olympics and as such they will not be allowed to display flags or emblems and their anthems will not be played. They also will be barred from taking part in the parade of athletes at the opening ceremony on July 26.\n\nIn addition, no teams from the two countries will be allowed, and no Russian or Belarusian government or state official has been invited or accredited. The number of Belarusian athletes at the games is expected to be very small.\n\nTsimanouskaya took refuge in August 2021 in the Polish Embassy in Tokyo after refusing to allow Belarusian team officials to force her onto a flight to Minsk after she voiced criticism of their coaching decisions.\n\nShe was granted a humanitarian visa by Poland and boarded a plane to Europe and reached Warsaw. She said at the time that she feared for her safety if she returned to Belarus.\n\nShe told RFE/RL that the current national flag of Belarus would not be the one that she would raise if she were competing at the Olympics for her native country.\n\n\"I would like to raise the national flag of Belarus,\" she said, referring to the historical white and red flag that has been used by opposition groups for decades.\n\nThe flag, whose origins are in the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918-1920, was reinstated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka replaced it one year after he came to power with a flag similar to the one used in Soviet times.\n\nTsimanouskaya said that after Russia launched its ongoing invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she stopped any contacts with the majority of Belarusian athletes, as they supported the war.\n\n\"There are only two people among the Belarusian national team with whom I can keep communicating,\" Tsimanouskaya said.\n\nThe Crisis In Belarus\n\nRead our coverage as Belarusian strongman Alyaksandr Lukashenka continues his brutal crackdown on NGOs, activists, and independent media following the August 2020 presidential election.\n\nTsimanouskaya also said that she is very grateful to Poland for everything the country has done for her and her family but emphasized that it's not easy for her to feel completely at home in Polish society due to peculiarities of culture and language.\n\nTsimanouskaya's plight at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 drew international attention to repression in Belarus a year after massive protests erupted when Lukashenka claimed victory in the presidential election in August 2020. The Belarusian opposition and many Western government say the election was rigged.\n\nLukashenka has moved to align Belarus closely with neighboring Russia, including allowing the Kremlin to stage military operations from Belarusian territory since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn addition to Tsimanouskaya, other Belarusian athletes and coaches have left the country.\n\nIn August 2021, a coach of the Vitsyaz handball club in Minsk, Kanstantsin Yakauleu, fled to Ukraine weeks after he served 15 days in jail for taking part in an anti-government rally.\n\nBelarusian heptathlete Yana Maksimava and her husband, Andrey Krauchanka, who won an Olympic medal in 2008 in Beijing, also announced in 2021 that they had decided to stay in Germany with their child due to the ongoing crackdown in Belarus.\n\nSOFIA -- Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has acknowledged blocking the appointment of a pro-Western former defense minister as Sofiaâ€™s ambassador to Kyiv, underscoring a long-running division between the head of state and successive governments over support for Ukraine in its battle against invading Russian forces.\n\nRadev's July 23 statement followed reports that the caretaker government of Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev used a workaround that doesn't require the president's signature to plug a diplomatic gap that had existed since the early months of the 29-month-old full-scale war in Ukraine.\n\nRadev, a 61-year-old retired general and two-term president whose critics accuse him of holding pro-Kremlin positions, alleged that the government circumvented the constitution to appoint Nikolay Nenchev as the envoy to Kyiv.\n\nGlavchev, who was appointed prime minister on a caretaker basis by Radev in April and also serves as foreign minister, responded that Nenchev's appointment as temporary ambassador was conducted in accordance with Bulgarian law.\n\nRadev said the previous prime minister, Nikolay Denkov, had been \"insistent\" on Nenchev's appointment to the Kyiv post in their final regular cabinet meeting in April.\n\n\"I firmly refused because the candidate does not have the required professional qualities or expertise for this important post,\" Radev said.\n\nRadev has clashed with multiple Bulgarian governments amid two years of inconclusive elections in the EU and NATO member state over Sofia's provision of military aid to Kyiv. He has referred to supporters of such aid as \"warmongers.\"\n\nNenchev, who was defense minister in 2014-17, is a generally pro-Western figure who has publicly argued in favor of military aid for Ukraine.\n\nRFE/RL's Bulgarian Service requested comment from the Foreign Ministry and from the cabinet, but those requests went unmet by the publication of this article.\n\nNenchev did not return RFE/RL's phone calls.\n\nSofia temporarily closed its embassy in Kyiv as a precaution after Russian troops invaded in February 2022, and former Bulgarian Ambassador Kostadin Kodzhabashev's mandate expired before the mission was reopened in September 2022.\n\nThe Bulgarian ambassadorial post has remained vacant ever since.\n\nA former Bulgarian foreign minister who heads a think tank in Sofia that advocates for transatlantic defense and security ties, Solomon Passy, sparked the public spat when he disclosed the Nenchev appointment on July 22.\n\nVice President Iliana Iotova, a Radev ally, said Passy's revelation had \"presented us all with a fait accompli, because I understand that this appointment must become a reality within days.\" She said it risked \"lowering\" Sofia's representation in Kyiv.\n\nTensions between Radev and Nenchev reportedly date back to Radev's days as the commander of the air force, with Nenchev serving as defense minister.\n\nRadev boycotted this month's NATO summit in Washington, reportedly over his exclusion from talks on a final communique laying out alliance members' positions on the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Moscow City Court has annulled the conviction and sentence of former police officer Sergei Vedel (aka Klokov) who was handed seven years in prison in April 2023 on a charge of distributing \"fake information\" about Russia's armed forces involved in Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe court's collegiate on appeals ruled on July 23 that Vedel's case must be sent back for retrial and ordered him to remain in custody at least until September before his case is retried.\n\nVedel was the first Russian citizen to face the charge in 2022 right after Russia adopted a law criminalizing any expression of opinion about the war in Ukraine that differs from official statements by Moscow. The law has been used to stifle even minor expressions of dissent.\n\nVedel's defense team has insisted the charge is illegal as it came about from recordings of private telephone conversations he had with friends, relatives in Ukraine, and colleagues, and therefore cannot be defined as distributing information.\n\nInvestigators say that the Ukrainian-born Vedel in three private telephone conversations said that Russian military losses in Ukraine were much higher than official statistics showed. He also said that Russia's military was killing civilians and that Ukraine's government was not led by Nazis, as Russian officials and propaganda have said in justifying the war.\n\nVedel, who was born and raised in the town of Irpin near Kyiv, was arrested on March 18, 2022, after his telephone conversation with a Ukrainian police officer in Kyiv, who is his 67-year-old father's friend, was intercepted.\n\nDuring the conversation, Vedel asked the police officer in Kyiv to get information about his friends and their families residing in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv.\n\nVedel admitted to making the statements and offered apologies to the court.\n\nRussian troops were forced to leave Irpin and Bucha in late March 2022 after they failed to capture the Ukrainian capital, leaving behind the bodies of hundreds of dead civilians in the streets.\n\nKyiv, rights groups, and the United Nations have described the Russian military's actions in Bucha, Irpin, and some other towns as war crimes.\n\nRussia has denied targeting civilians in its attacks on Ukrainian targets, and has repeatedly denied its forces have committed any war crimes even with mounting evidence that it has targeted hospitals, residential areas, cultural centers, and other nonmilitary installations.\n\nWith reporting by Setevyye svobody\n\nThe European Union has approved opening talks with Armenia on visa liberalization and has offered 10 million euros ($10.9 million) in military aid to the Caucasus country, the bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has announced.\n\n\"These two decisions were long awaited by Armenia,\" Borrell said in remarks to a meeting of the EU foreign ministers on July 22.\n\nA traditional ally and partner of Russia, Armenia recently has turned toward improving its ties with the West and putting on ice its relations with Moscow, which Yerevan has blamed for failing to support it in its conflict with longtime archfoe Azerbaijan.\n\nThe EU announcement was hailed by Yerevan, with Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan calling it \"a very important milestone in the deepening partnership between Armenia and the EU, based on shared values and principles.\"\n\nThe decision to open visa liberalization talks with Yerevan was initially made by the European Council on July 17 when the 27 EU ambassadors approved the proposal, with the council saying Armenia would have to meet commonly agreed benchmarks.\n\nOnce negotiations -- a process that could take several years -- are concluded, Armenians would be able to travel visa-free to EU countries and the Schengen Zone -- where border controls have been generally abolished -- for a period of 90 days within any 180-day period.\n\nSeveral other former Soviet republics such as Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia's fellow Caucasus neighbor Georgia have been granted visa-free travel to the bloc.\n\nThe second decision regarding military aid was adopted under the European Peace Facility.\n\n\"The aim of this assistance measure is to enhance the logistical capacities of the Armenian Armed Forces, and to contribute to improved protection of civilians in crises and emergencies,\" the council said in a separate statement.\n\nAzerbaijan's Foreign Ministry, however, protested the EU decision.\n\n\"We strongly object to this decision by the Council of the European Union and expect transparent information about the aid to be provided,\" Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aykhan Hajizadeh told the media.\n\n\"[This decision] is a very wrong and dangerous step and serves to increase tension in the region,\" said Hajizadeh.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have fought several wars in the past three decades over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been a majority ethnic-Armenian enclave since the Soviet collapse and is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory.\n\nAfter Baku took full control over the region as the result of a one-day military operation in September 2023, nearly 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has arrived in Beijing for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion for talks geared toward finding a possible Chinese role in ending the war.\n\nThe three-day visit began on July 23, with Ukraine's top diplomat traveling at the invitation of Wang Yi, his Chinese counterpart.\n\nUpon arriving in Beijing, Kuleba said in an Instagram post that he would use his trip to develop contacts between Chinese and Ukrainian leaders and that he would be having \"extensive, detailed, [and] substantive negotiations\" with Wang over how to reach a peace settlement for the grinding war that is now in its third year.\n\n\"We must avoid competing peace plans. It is very important that Kyiv and Beijing conduct a direct dialogue and exchange positions,\" Kuleba said.\n\nThe trip is Kuleba's first visit to China since Russia's war in Ukraine began in February 2022 and is seen as unexpected by many observers given Beijing's close relationship with Moscow and diplomatic maneuvering that has often seen Chinese diplomats keep their distance from high-level Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe meeting also comes as various peace initiatives have emerged in recent months against the backdrop of prolonged fighting and uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November that could see the return of former President Donald Trump, who has threatened to limit aid flows to Ukraine and push for talks between Kyiv and Moscow that could quickly end the war.\n\nIn June, Kyiv held an international summit without Russian representation in Switzerland to promote its vision of peace. The gathering hosted delegations from 100 countries, and Ukraine has since said that it hopes to be ready to hold another one in November that would feature envoys from Moscow.\n\nChina, which did not attend the Swiss summit, published a separate six-point peace plan with Brazil in the weeks leading up to the gathering where they called for a separate international peace conference to be held that would have both representation from Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nThis alternative diplomatic track led to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy offering his most vocal criticism yet of Beijing since the war began, where he said that China's efforts were undermining the Swiss peace talks by pushing some countries to not attend and others to not sign the final communique.\n\n\"China, unfortunately...is working hard today for countries not to come to the peace summit,\" Zelenskiy said in Singapore on June 2.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nDespite expressing neutrality toward the war in Ukraine, China has emerged as the Kremlin's leading international supporter by supplying Russia with key components that Moscow needs for its production of weapons and as a vital consumer for oil and gas that has helped boost the Russian economy.\n\nWestern governments have also accused China of providing crucial support to Russia during the war, with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg saying Beijing's assistance to Moscow has made it a \"decisive enabler\" of the war.\n\n\"Allies have stated clearly that China cannot enable the largest conflict in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting their interests and reputation,\" Stoltenberg said on July 11 at the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nChina, meanwhile, says its ties with Russia are built on the basis of non-alliance and do not target any third party.\n\nKuleba's trip is also on Moscow's radar, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledging the news on July 22.\n\n\"For us, our relations with China are the main thing,\" he said in comments to reporters. \"We intend to continue following the path of developing Russian-Chinese relations in all areas.\"\n\nIn February 2023, Beijing released a 12-point paper calling for a \"political settlement\" to the war.\n\nThe document was dismissed at the time by Western countries and Kyiv, who warned that the Chinese proposal would enable Russia to retain much of the territory it had seized in Ukraine.\n\nIn the years leading up to Moscow's full-scale invasion, Kyiv tried to build strong economic ties with Beijing as it reoriented its economy away from Russia, and found itself frustrated with some Western policy moves.\n\nDespite Beijing's deepening ties with Moscow since the outbreak of the war, Kyiv has been hesitant to criticize China, with Zelenskiy often encouraging the country to play a role in reaching a peace settlement."
