        "text": "In the German chancellery, a junior minister once complained that “in many cases, there was no complete clarity about the precise jurisdictions of the ministries” (Hoffmann, Reference Hoffmann2003, 28). Although just anecdotal, this complaint is at odds with the stylized standard notion of coalition governance, which rests on a clear and exclusive allocation of ministerial competences. From a ministerial government perspective, the executive's structure and design shape a government's policy legacy. As the task of policy design is commissioned to the responsible ministry—and thus indirectly the party furnishing the respective minister—the allocation of ministerial portfolios to parties is crucial and formative for the design of future coalition policies (Laver and Shepsle, Reference Laver and Shepsle1996). Hence, any sort of coalition agreement is essentially void, because, once in power, parties cannot enforce those parts of the deal that fall outside their portfolios. This corollary sparked a line of research on how parties in coalitions can nevertheless “keep tabs on partners” (Thies, Reference Thies2001). These studies unraveled a toolkit of instruments coalitions can use to ensure the enactment of policy deals. Within the executive, parties can deploy junior ministers in “hostile ministries” to curb the informational advantage of the minister in charge (Thies, Reference Thies2001). Farther down the line of legislation, parliamentary amendment rights (Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2004, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011) and scrutinizing parliamentary committees (Kim and Loewenberg, Reference Kim and Loewenberg2005; Carroll and Cox, Reference Carroll and Cox2012; Fortunato et al., Reference Fortunato, Martin and Vanberg2017) can be effective in reeling back in politically biased bills toward the initially agreed compromise.\n\nThese commonly researched ex-post controls of ministerial discretion are largely reactive. Instruments of parliamentary review can only be used to scrutinize and amend bills after the government has already set their general course. Junior ministers ring the alarm bells after they have spotted their bosses going native. Even hierarchy within the government, be it the PM or any sort of “inner cabinet,” is mostly used to react to policy initiatives drafted by the responsible minister. In contrast, the perspective presented here is qualitatively different from other coalition governance tools, as it is not built upon monitoring ministerial policy proposals. Rather, it contents that coalitions motivate and exploit inter-ministerial coordination during the phase of policy formulation to curb ministerial discretion. In other words, incumbent parties in coalition governments do not need to rely on ex-post policing of policy bargains but, drawing on shared responsibility, can directly coordinate among each other while policy initiatives are being drafted by the ministerial bureaucracy. Hence, whenever incumbent parties disagree on salient policy issues, responsibility ought to span across ministries run by different parties.\n\nTo this end, the paper explicitly breaks with the assumption of exclusive ministerial portfolios, which denotes the idea that ministers do not interfere in their colleagues’ affairs (Andeweg, Reference Andeweg2000). This assumption both underpins the work by Laver and Shepsle (Reference Laver and Shepsle1996) and characterizes the broader theoretical mindset of the ensuing streak of coalition governance research. However, as this paper shows, the empirical reality of portfolio design, that is, the mapping of policy responsibilities to ministries and, thus, incumbent parties, is considerably untidier than usually assumed. Parties in coalitions can exercise joint ministerial responsibility for policy issues, which manifests itself in overlapping portfolios and, hence, often extensive ministerial cooperation. Addressing this idea, this paper echoes previous work on the strategic assignment of neighboring ministerial portfolios (Fernandes et al., Reference Fernandes, Meinfelder and Moury2016); however, it goes considerably further by not just assuming overlapping policy responsibilities between defined pairs of ministerial portfolios, but directly modeling the extent to which ministerial responsibility for policy issues transgresses party boundaries within coalition governments.\n\nThe theoretical claim is tested on newly elicited data about ministerial policy responsibilities of five Danish, four German, and seven Dutch governments, covering from 1995 to 2013. Based on charts of the organizational structure of individual ministries, a sequential data collection pipeline consisting of optical character recognition, a supervised classifier, human review, and final automated consistency checks was developed to both extract and content-code about 30,000 policy responsibilities assigned to ministerial working units at the lowest hierarchical level according to the Comparative Agenda Project's codebook (Baumgartner et al., Reference Baumgartner, Breunig and Grossman2019; Bevan, Reference Bevan2019). The resulting dataset shows how policy responsibility is distributed across ministries, and therefore also parties, in coalition governments. The analysis largely supports the theoretical expectation and suggests that incumbent parties in the analyzed coalition governments share responsibility for highly salient, contentious policy issues to curb ministerial discretion.\n\n1. Curbing ministerial discretion through ministerial coordination\n\nMinisterial discretion describes the potential for ministers to deviate from the government's preferences. This can be particularly hurtful to coalition governments, as incumbent parties can (ab)use the ministerial bureaucracy to advocate their own policy ideas, regardless of whether they conform with any sort of policy compromise struck at the onset of a coalition. In the absence of coalition management devices, ministers are powerful gatekeepers with the ability to control the flow of information between their own civil servants and the government as such. Unable to interfere with or monitor the internal procedures of single departments, the cabinet relies on the expertise the minister in charge presents to it. Thus, ministers can rather easily bias information or withhold it from the cabinet to nudge the final policy outcome toward their own or their party's preferences (Timmermans, Reference Timmermans1994; Laver and Shepsle, Reference Laver and Shepsle1996).\n\nThe idea of ministerial discretion essentially relies on the assumption that “ministerial jurisdictions are mutually exclusive” (Andeweg, Reference Andeweg2000, 378). Although country experts provide some illustrative evidence throughout the numerous case studies in Laver and Shepsle's main contributions to this topic (Reference Timmermans1994; Reference Laver and Shepsle1996), showing that governments claim to allocate policy responsibilities tidily among their ministries, this perspective does not pay due credit to the abundant episodes of inter-ministerial coordination reported in many governments. For instance, the Danish Jørgensen III cabinet (1978–1979) and many Austrian governments explicitly team up ministers from different parties and require them to reach an agreement before decisions can be made (Christensen, Reference Christensen1985, 131; Müller, Reference Müller1997, 135) and Swedish key portfolios are often allocated to different cabinet ministers to keep parties at bay (Bergman, Reference Bergman1997, 274). In the Westminster system, the idea of dividing ministerial responsibility is well documented as a tool of strengthening the position of the prime minister (Dewan and Hortala-Vallve, Reference Dewan and Hortala-Vallve2011). Harold Wilson's incoming Labour government of 1964 is a case-in-point. Having won the party leadership, prevailing against his inner-party rivals George Brown and James Callaghan, the prime minister was suspicious about them plotting a coup within his government. Hence, he deliberately recast Brown's and Callaghan's departments—economic affairs and the treasury—to stimulate tensions between the two contenders and thereby deflect their attention from mobilizing against him (Heppell, Reference Heppell2011).\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, overlapping responsibility among ministries creates (semi-)formalized venues or incentive structures, which encourage ministers to consider their colleagues’ preferences or even collaborate during the process of designing legislation. Formalized venues explicitly speak to instances of positive coordination, that is, situations where actors seek solutions to policy problems while simultaneously trying to resolve distributive problems (Scharpf and Mohr, Reference Scharpf and Mohr1994, 18). In their study on the German federal bureaucracy, Mayntz and Scharpf (Reference Mayntz and Scharpf1975) frequently identified this mode of coordination, whenever solutions were to be found for problems that transgressed the jurisdictions of ministerial portfolios (see also: Wegrich and Hammerschmid, Reference Wegrich and Hammerschmid2018). The working groups that were established in response to these problems were tasked to both provide innovative and effective solutions, while at the same time protecting the interests of their home ministries and the responsible party.Footnote 1 In Denmark, the government regularly leaves the precise coordination of policy proposals between ministries to two standing committees, chaired by permanent secretaries from the PM's office and the Ministry of Finance (Greve, Reference Greve2018). These bodies—the coordination committee and the economy committee—seek solutions to important policy problems that crosscut ministerial boundaries and coordinate the day-to-day business between the members of government. The existence of these committees results in frequent inter-ministerial coordination and cooperation that has transformed decision-making into a reconciliatory process, in which contentious issues must be resolved among those ministries upon whose stakes they touch (Bo Smith-udvalget, 2015, 85–86).\n\nWhereas positive coordination was found to be the preferred mode of inter-ministerial cooperation (Mayntz and Scharpf, Reference Mayntz and Scharpf1975), for lower-profile cases governments rather opt for a cheaper alternative. Ministries can use negative coordination, which resembles a form of voluntary self-restraint, to avoid negative externalities a decision might induce (Scharpf and Mohr, Reference Scharpf and Mohr1994). Similar to the idea of deferential adjustment (Lindblom, Reference Lindblom1965, 45), it describes a situation in which decision-makers seek to avoid inducing a response from other stakeholders (read: other affected ministries) by avoiding impinging on their values and preferences. Cabinets often deliberately amplify this behavior by being unwilling to act upon ministerial initiatives that stir up conflict (Mayntz and Scharpf, Reference Mayntz and Scharpf1975, 145–50). This form of cooperation only requires minimal to no active coordination among the involved ministries, as initiatives are pre-emptively designed to be mutually acceptable, which makes it the most prevalent form of inter-ministerial coordination.\n\nBoth forms of inter-ministerial coordination lend themselves to curbing ministerial discretion, and, hence, coalitions can use them as a governance device. However, this requires a slight change of perspective. As coordination has been described so far, it speaks to diverging preferences among ministries, while coalition governance is generally concerned with how ministerial discretion can be exploited to implement preferences of incumbent parties (e.g., Thies, Reference Thies2001; Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011). In order to turn inter-ministerial coordination into a coalition governance device, the focus needs to move from interests of single ministries to preferences of parties represented by the ministries they direct. From this perspective, speaking of inter-ministerial coordination refers to employing coordination tools between ministries to sort out disagreements among the coalescing parties.\n\nIf coalition governments want to use either form of inter-ministerial coordination to rein in ministers, they must ensure that potentially contentious legislation indeed touches upon the jurisdiction of ministries that belong to different incumbent parties. Put differently, ministerial jurisdictions must overlap in policy areas that are contentious within the coalition. Effectively, this implies that incumbent parties must share responsibility for such policy issues. If this is given, parties can use coordination mechanisms to either jointly cooperate on prospective legislation (positive coordination) or have the ministries in charge voluntarily exercise self-restraint (negative coordination). In both cases, the suggested policy that emanates from the ministerial bureaucracy mirrors the coalition's agreed policy objectives much closer than if it had been drafted unilaterally by one ministry or different ministries belonging to just one party. This governance tool is qualitatively different from ex-post controls that parties can use to ensure the enactment of the coalition compromise (Thies, Reference Thies2001; Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2004, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011; Carroll and Cox, Reference Carroll and Cox2012; Fortunato et al., Reference Fortunato, Martin and Vanberg2017). Instead of actively obtaining policy expertise to level the informational advantage of ministers and thereby facilitating more detailed scrutiny of policy proposals, involved parties can rely on negative or positive coordination to jointly collaborate on contested policies that are designed inside the executive.\n\nYet, coalitions may not always prefer shared ministerial responsibility to curb ministerial autonomy. First, as the purposeful sharing of ministerial responsibility requires a certain degree of redundancy in the administrative structure, this coalition governance mechanism entails comparatively high fixed costs. Second, given the transaction costs that positive inter-ministerial coordination inflicts upon the involved parties (Mayntz and Scharpf, Reference Mayntz and Scharpf1975), it is conceivable that, on balance, amending legislation within parliament (Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011) is cheaper and, hence, preferable to having differences being sorted out within the executive in a ping-pong-like procedure. Furthermore, relying on parliamentary review shifts the burden of coalition management from the executive to the legislative branch of government. Since the same party elites who often form a coalition, design its portfolios, and negotiate its policy agreement are regularly rewarded with a ministerial office, it might be that they rather have their fellow partisans in parliament taking care of curbing ministerial dominance. Given these considerations, the benefits of shared responsibility—direct collaboration on policy proposals and the containment of biased proposals before they even see the light of day—may only outweigh the costs for highly salient issues.\n\nIn terms of the empirical implications that follow from this line of thought, it is important to note that the argument put forward here only stipulates that a coalition's desire to curb ministerial discretion motivates the allocation of issue responsibility across the ministries of different incumbent parties. More precisely, this implies that governments who deem a policy issue salient advocate curbing ministerial autonomy via ministerial collaboration in the context of policy conflict. Translated into language of effects, the argument thus predicts\n\n(1) a positive multiplicative effect of the conflict around and the salience of a policy area within a coalition government; and\n\n(2) a positive effect of policy conflict on the extent to which responsibility is shared among incumbent parties for salient policy issues.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nBased on novel data of ministerial responsibility for individual policy issues, this paper shows that responsibility for policy issues regularly transgresses partisan boundaries. Only for very specific issues like defense, ministerial responsibility is concentrated within one incumbent party's ministries. Besides making the case that ministerial responsibility for policy issues cannot be assumed to be concentrated and, thus, ministerial portfolios can overlap, this paper asserts that parties share responsibility for salient and contentious policy issues to reduce the potential for ministers to bias policy according to their preferences. As a coalition management tool, this mechanism is conceptually different from those discussed in most previous studies on coalition governance (a notable exception is Fernandes et al., Reference Fernandes, Meinfelder and Moury2016). Whereas institutions like junior ministers (Thies, Reference Thies2001), legislative review (Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2004, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011), and parliamentary committees (Carroll and Cox, Reference Carroll and Cox2012; Fortunato et al., Reference Fortunato, Martin and Vanberg2017) suggest that information is gathered to ex-post amend a ministerial policy proposal, shared ministerial responsibility creates the opportunity for parties to cooperate already during the process of drafting legislation and, hence, ex-ante limit the need for later policing. Using a series of fractional logistic regressions, this reasoning is largely corroborated. The analysis shows that incumbent parties are willing to create the administrative redundancies that underpin shared responsibility only for policy issues that are vital to them.\n\nImportantly, the argument put forward here only stipulates that the observed allocation of issue responsibility across ministries of different parties is conducive of curbing ministerial discretion. In this light, it welcomes the push toward portfolio malleability advocated by the growing body of studies of portfolio design, that is, how and why governments recast their portfolio structures, and acknowledges that portfolios are, empirically speaking, much more malleable than commonly assumed (Fleischer et al., Reference Fleischer, Bertels and Schulze-Gabrechten2018; Sieberer et al., Reference Sieberer, Meyer, Bäck, Ceron, Falcó-Gimeno, Guinaudeau and Hansen2021). While generally studied within single countries, like Denmark (Mortensen and Green-Pedersen, Reference Mortensen and Green-Pedersen2015), Germany (Sieberer, Reference Sieberer2015), or the UK (White and Dunleavy, Reference White and Dunleavy2010; Heppell, Reference Heppell2011), Sieberer et al. (Reference Sieberer, Meyer, Bäck, Ceron, Falcó-Gimeno, Guinaudeau and Hansen2021) employ a comparative cross-national focus and find that frequently changing portfolios are a recurring phenomenon in most European countries. These re-designs suggest that coalitions are not restricted to allocate fixed ministerial portfolios whose jurisdictions may happen to overlap in crucial policy areas but are free to tweak the precise allocation of policy responsibilities to ministerial portfolios. However, the extent to which governments indeed deliberately overhaul ministerial structures to create overlapping portfolios is a different and inherently longitudinal question, which is outside the scope of this paper. The reason is that the data on which the findings draw consist of snapshots of the distribution of ministerial responsibility taken at the onset of coalition governments. Hence, the analysis is blind to potential changes in the ministerial responsibility structure that happen after a coalition government started operations.\n\nMoving forward, it is an open question whether and how the sharing of ministerial responsibility integrates with other, more established tools of coalition management and seek to study how different devices can complement or substitute each other. Given the high costs that positive inter-ministerial coordination inflicts upon the involved parties (Mayntz and Scharpf, Reference Mayntz and Scharpf1975), it is conceivable that coalitions in some countries may prefer to resort to different coalition governance mechanisms. For example, at least for the executive, having legislation amended in parliament (Martin and Vanberg, Reference Martin and Vanberg2005, Reference Martin and Vanberg2011) may be cheaper and, hence, preferable to having differences being sorted out between ministries in a ping-pong-like procedure. Such reasoning is in line with both the comparatively low number of policy issues in the present sample for which incumbent parties properly share ministerial responsibility and the finding that policy conflict only drives responsibility-sharing if the stakes are high. Furthermore, coalitions might be generally less reliant on shared ministerial responsibility, the more governance tools they have at their disposal. The Netherlands are the textbook example of how coalitions employ hostile junior ministers to control whether “real” ministers remain faithful to the coalition's policy goals (Thies, Reference Thies2001). This frequent deployment of junior ministers may explain why shared responsibilities are markedly less frequent in the Netherlands as compared to Denmark and Germany.\n\nAs mentioned before, all three countries constituting the present sample feature rather powerful parliaments, which is why they are a hard test for the stipulated theoretical expectations. In contrast, countries with fewer available management tools, such as Ireland or Spain, should be more prone to use inter-ministerial coordination and have conflicts resolved directly within the government, as parties cannot rely on ex-post devices to curb ministerial discretion. In the same vein, it is telling that the mechanism of shared ministerial responsibility was first discussed in the context of the British Cameron-Clegg government and the—in comparative perspective—weak House of Commons. In parliamentary systems featuring majoritarian representation, such as the UK, single-party governments may equally use overlapping policy briefs to stifle not inter-, but interparty competition (Dewan and Hortala-Vallve, Reference Dewan and Hortala-Vallve2011; Heppell, Reference Heppell2011). However, probing into these arguments, both about the interaction of different control mechanisms and the question of how well the mechanism of shared responsibility travels, can only be achieved by expanding the data collection as to increase the institutional variation beyond the present sample."
