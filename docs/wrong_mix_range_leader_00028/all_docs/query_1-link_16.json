        "text": "(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2005-04-13 08:53\n\nDutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende criticized his country's collaboration with its Nazi occupiers during World War II on Tuesday, shortly before commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the country's main deportation camp.\n\nBalkenende said government authorities at the time \"worked on the horrible process whereby Jews were stripped of their rights,\" Dutch public broadcaster NOS reported.\n\nYoung people attend a commemoration ceremony in the former Nazi deportation camp Westerbork in the Netherlands, Tuesday, April 12, 2005. Most Dutch victims, including teenage diarist Anne Frank, were held temporarily at camp Westerbork, near the German border. They later were sent to death camps in Germany and Poland. Westerbork was liberated by Canadian troops 60 years ago. [AP]\n\nThousands of camp survivors, soldiers and students gathered for a solemn ceremony at Westerbork camp, in the eastern Dutch countryside, where Jews and others considered enemies of the Nazi regime were detained before being deported to death camps in Poland and Germany.\n\nMany of those present Tuesday laid flowers at the camp's memorial â a short length of railroad tracks with one end twisted up skyward.\n\n\"It's a wonder that I exist,\" said Eveline Hertzberger, whose grandparents were interned at Westerbork.\n\nShe said she and other descendants of survivors were living proof that the Nazis had failed. \"We're still here. The suffering wasn't for nothing. We bring honor to our history and our race.\"\n\nMore than 100,000 Dutch Jews â 70 percent of the country's Jewish community â were deported from the Netherlands after Germany occupied the country in May 1940, with the efficient help of Dutch authorities.\n\nWesterbork was run with minimal guidance from the Nazis; Dutch policemen handled security and a council of internees determined who was selected for deportation.\n\nMost Dutch victims of the Holocaust, including the German-born teenage diarist Anne Frank, were held temporarily at the camp, about 100 miles northeast of Amsterdam and not far from the German border. It was destroyed after the war.\n\nDeportees were sent to death camps in Germany and Poland and most died in gas chambers, among the 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi genocide. Frank died in Germany of typhus.\n\nWesterbork was liberated by Canadian troops 60 years ago Tuesday, and 876 prisoners were freed."
