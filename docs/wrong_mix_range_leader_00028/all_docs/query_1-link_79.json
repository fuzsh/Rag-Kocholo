Three new documents were presented: Part I - paragraphs agreed in the Vienna setting; Part II - paragraphs agreed in ministerial meetings, and Part III - paragraphs agreed in the ministerial meeting dealing with sustainable development in a globalizing world. Chair Kumalo opened the floor for technical corrections. Several delegations proposed minor changes, which were agreed. At 12:10 pm Chair Kumalo gavelled and the text was adopted by acclamation.\n\nChair Kumalo noted that outstanding issues on paragraphs 6(d), 58(a) and 47 would be addressed in the evening session of the Main Committee. While not allowing discussion on outstanding issues, the Chair gave a developed country an opportunity to present its proposal, for information purposes, on promoting women’s equal access to health care and related services (6(d)). Kumalo requested delegations preparing interpretations for inclusion in the final report to transmit them in writing to the Secretariat within a week.\n\nKumalo adjourned the Vienna setting at 12:30 pm.\n\nMAIN COMMITTEE\n\nChair Emil Salim (Indonesia) convened the Main Committee at 12:45 am to consider and endorse the draft Plan of Implementation.\n\nSouth African Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma presented a \"package\" on the outstanding paragraphs relating to health. Paragraph 6(d) promoting women's access and participation, eliminating violence and discrimination, and improving their status, was presented without the Canadian amendment relating to delivery of basic \"health services\" \"in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\" Paragraph 47 on strengthening the capacity of health care systems was amended such that it would deliver \"health-care services\" rather than \"health services,\" and this would be \"in conformity with human rights and fundamental freedoms, consistent with national laws and cultural and religious values.\" Paragraph 58(a) was amended such that it would promote \"equitable access to health-care services\" rather than \"health-care and services.\" The package was adopted as presented.\n\nAfter the Secretariat presented minor edits to the draft Plan of Implementation, the Chair presented it for endorsement. Delegates endorsed the draft Plan of Implementation at 1:15 am, which will be presented to the closing Plenary for formal adoption. Numerous countries recorded their desire to enter declarations and/or statements to the draft Plan of Implementation at the closing Plenary.\n\nThe Secretariat read out a statement from the Contact Group on Means of Implementation reflecting their understanding that Paragraph 45ter regarding corporate responsibility and accountability refers to existing international agreements. ETHIOPIA pointed out that the terms of 45ter that refer to the \"full development and effective implementation of intergovernmental agreements\" were incompatible with this statement. NORWAY added that an informal contact group does not possess the authority to present an interpretative statement. Chair Salim decided to retain 45ter as is, and noted that the statement would not alter the nature and spirit of 45ter.\n\nDelegates sought guidance on whether the draft Political Declaration would be considered in the Main Committee or in the closing Plenary. Minister Zuma promised that the draft Political Declaration would be available in the morning of 4 September, and Nitin Desai, WSSD Secretary-General, added that a decision would be taken after consultations with the Presidency, and delegates would be informed thereafter.\n\nIN THE CORRIDORS\n\nWith the Plan of Implementation out of the way, delegates’ attention has focused on the Political Declaration, \"The Johannesburg Commitment on Sustainable Development.\" The South Africans quietly continued to solicit views from key players on the paper, submitted officially on 2 September by the President of the Summit, as document A/CONF.199/L.6. Clearly this was not to be the last version. There were indications that friendly coaxing was in progress throughout the day to put across coveted positions, from adding gloss to language on globalization to airbrushing the text to a deeper shade of green. As one delegate observed, the paper would stand a better chance of being whisked through by acclamation if it embraced points that had evolved in the Plan of Implementation, rather than slipping in partisan views so late in the day. The authors are playing a deft game against a tight deadline and will offer a new text on Wednesday morning.\n\nTHINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY\n\nPLENARY: The Plenary will start at 9:00 am in the Plenary Hall to resume addresses by Heads of State and Government and senior officials.\n\nROUND TABLE: The final Round Table on the theme, \"Making It Happen,\" will meet at 10:00 am in Ballroom 3.\n\nPOLITICAL DECLARATION: Check the Journal for information on whether the revised draft Political Declaration will be discussed in the Plenary or the Main Committee."
