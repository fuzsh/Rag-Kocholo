        "text": "I wrote an op-ed on the importance of the federal government's Strategic Examination of R&D for our future prosperity, published in the Aus online yesterday (paywall, link to full article in comments). This review can address some of the shortcomings of the Accord, and needs to be both broad and bold to ensure that we can remain competitive in the 21st century in a world that is increasingly driven by innovation systems rather than natural resources. I can only hope that it gets the attention and focus that it needs. IP Group plc Vicki Thomson Ed Husic MP Jason Clare MP The Group of Eight https://lnkd.in/gX3_-RBM\n\nWe are Adelaide University ‚Äì a new university for the future, focused on making a transformative impact in our world, and yours üåè Built on the legacies of the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia, we are Australia's first new major university in a generation. Together, we will launch bright futures. We will rise to the occasion as a member of The Group of Eight (Go8) by delivering contemporary and nation-leading curriculum, exceptional student experience, excellence and equity, and future-making research of scale and focus with impact that will transcend borders around the world. Through powerful partnerships with industry, government and the broader community ‚Äì locally, nationally and internationally ‚Äì we will break new ground and unlock new ways of thinking and doing. Today, we launch a new university and driving force for good. We are ready to take Adelaide University to the world, including our exciting new brand and first suite of educational programs ready for international application to start in 2026 üéì Find out more about Adelaide University here üëâ adelaideuni.edu.au\n\nIt was a great pleasure to welcome University of Exeter Vice-Chancellor and President Lisa Roberts and her team to The University of Queensland for the annual QUEX International Symposium. The QUEX Institute is the flagship initiative of the partnership between our two universities, enabling us to bolster our joint global research impact. An international cohort of students, academics and industry professionals considered the pressing opportunities for research to support healthy living, environmental futures, digital worlds and disruptive technologies, and mineral security and sustainability. A particular highlight was the QUEX 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) which showcased the innovative ideas of 12 students from our joint PhD program. This was a fitting way to mark the agreement to continue our joint PhD program for another 5 years, alongside Professor Virginia Slaughter from UQ and Professor Stacey Hynd from Exeter. The new agreement will give more students the opportunity to study at both institutions to gain different perspectives, skills and knowledge in their field of research. A special thank you to the Symposium‚Äôs keynote speaker, UQ Professor Matt Sanders AO, founder of the Triple P Parenting Program, and to all panellists who shared their knowledge. #UQResearch #GlobalPartnerships Brett Lovegrove Rongyu Li"
