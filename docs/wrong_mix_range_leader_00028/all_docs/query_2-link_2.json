        "text": "Great recognition to be invited by H.E. Ã“lafur Ragnar Grimsson, former President of Iceland, now Arctic Circle President to moderate a distinguished panel on 'The THREAT of ARCTIC MELTING and SEA-LEVEL RISE' during Japan's G7 Presidency: https://lnkd.in/e9uTutB6 Panelists comprised former Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, former UK Climate Envoy Sir David King, Japanese Ambassador for Arctic Affairs Keizo Takewaka, Operaatio Arktis representative Viktor Jaakkola and myself as co-founder of the BLUE COOLING INITIATIVE: https://lnkd.in/egYsAdjs The NETHERlands, Kanto (Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki) and Kansai (Osaka, Kobe) have in common that they are densely populated, flatland river deltas, at risk of flooding by sea-level rise. Of course ALL low lying coastal areas are exposed to this risk. Due to the detour the plane had to make over #Greenland, it flew 1.5hrs from one end to the other at 900 km/h. When all the water - currently stacked up as 2 km high ice - will have melted, this water will increase sea levels worldwide by several meters! The upper left graph shows which cities will disappear at what sea-level rise. The melting of #Antarctica will flood even more coastal areas. This is the result of the geological tilting of the rotation axis of our planet. It shifts between the most vertical position with 'max ice' resulting in the LOWEST OCEAN LEVEL and the most tilted 'no ice' position resulting in the HIGHEST OCEAN LEVEL. The difference in sealevel between both extremes is 140 METERS! 70m of water has already been added since the last ice-age, creating a.o. the North Sea and the Channel. A further 70m will get added. Shorelines have always been dynamic. What's new is that never before Billions of People & Trillions of Capital Assets were located close to the shorelines. The important issue our panel discussed was how Anthropogenic Climate Change has accelerated Arctic Melting (Climate Change happens 4x faster than average in the #Arctic) and thus accelerating sea-level rise. Just like we were capable of accelerating sealevel rise - which agencies all over the world are now confirming - we are also capable to slow it down. Whilst MARINE CLOUD BRIGHTENING, as way of cooling the planet, cannot stop sea-level rise, it can BUY MORE TIME to conduct the unavoidable transformation and physical move in a civilised & peaceful way. Few leaders are aware, but we are at the eve of the biggest moves in history as we have to move away from the receding coasts. Such moves will take the larger part of a century. Some cities, like Jakarta, will already be uninhabitable by mid-century. Other cities will face the same challenge by the end of this century or in the course of the next century. To prepare for this is a challenge for Democracies, which act like a single INTEREST GROUP of the CURRENTLY LIVING. Yet compensating action now - to avoid severe problems for next generations - is precisely what the Brundtland Convention requires us to do."
