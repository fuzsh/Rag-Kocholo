He also chairs the International Advisory Board of Rotterdam, the Major Alliance, and the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition. The Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition (DSGC) unites Dutch multinationals AkzoNobel, DSM, FrieslandCampina, Heineken, KLM, Philips, Shell and Unilever. The coalition aims to promote sustainable growth business strategies in The Netherlands and abroad.

He subsequently worked at the Netherlands’ Universities Council, the Research Institute of the political party CDA and as a part-time professor at VU University Amsterdam.
