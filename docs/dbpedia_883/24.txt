As we move closer to delivery, we're happy to share a status update for the #TheResidences, Dorchester Collection located in Business Bay â€“ Dubai (UAE). After topping out the construction of the main structure in Q1 2020, we have now achieved a major safety milestone clocking over 10 million man-hours with zero Lost Time Injury (LTI) since the project commencement. The 32-storey waterfront development project launched in 2017 and designed by the iconic architects Foster + Partners was awarded to a joint venture between Impresa Pizzarotti & C. S.p.A. and Australian firm Roberts Constructions. The project involves the construction of two towers, one housing a 5-star Dorchester Collection hotel and the other consisting of only 39 ultra-high-end fully serviced residences with bespoke interiors by Parisian design house Gilles et Boissier Kudos to the whole team #impresapizzarotti #dubai #future #safetymanagement #constructionindustry #hospitalityindustry
