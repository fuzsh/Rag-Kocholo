        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPreface This book is intended to serve as a legal commentary to the law and directives of the European Union on public procurement. Public procurement can be defined as the process whereby public authorities or other public entities purchase goods, works and services. The aim of the procurement process is to obtain the purchases through methods that optimize the cost/benefit value of such procurement to the benefit of the public. While as it is described below in the introduction the EU treaties provide a number of principles and provisions which are of obvious relevance to the handling of public procurement the quintessence of EU law in this field is provided through the adoption throughout a period of almost fifty years of a number of central directives providing a rather stringent and detailed regulation which must be observed by the Member States and implemented in their national law. The development toward an ever closer regulation within this field of law began in 1971 when a directive on procurement of public works was adopted. It took a rather long time before, in 1977, the directive on supply of goods was adopted, Then it was not until 1990 that the next procurement directive, the so-called utilities directive, arrived and in 1992, a directive on procurement of services followed suit. Along the way two so-called remedy directives were adopted in order to safeguard the possibilities of taking action against violations of the procurement rules. After a major overhaul of the procurement directives in 2004 including consolidating the classic directives within the public sector in one public sector directive a second and just as comprehensive amendment of the previous directives and an additional directive on concessions took place in 2014. In between these two generations of procurement directives the first procurement directive directed at the defence and security sector was adopted. The aim of the 2014 legislation was, broadly speaking, to make the directives more flexible, clear, transparent and less bureaucratic. The “modernisation” has also served to incorporate important case law by the Court of Justice into EU procurement legislation. The new directives have brought with them a number of important and practical amendments. That is the case, e.g., with regard to allowing for more flexibility in the use of competitive dialogue and negotiated procedures. New is also the possibility of entering into so-called innovation partnerships which is a new form of procurement process meant to promote the development and eventually subsequent purchase of new types of products. The rules on framework contracts have been clarified and the access of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) to public contracts has also been improved in a number of ways, e.g. through rules promoting the splitting up of contracts into smaller parts and rules on a maximum requirement regarding the turnover of tenderers. New rules on the use of environmental certification requirements have become less burdensome with regard to documentation and it has become possible to apply lifecycle considerations. The introduction of the so-called European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) constitutes an attempt to simplify bureaucratic burdens. Also the development with regard to the application of internet based technologies has made its imprint on the directives and that to the extent that it has been made mandatory to handle procurement procedures through electronic means only. As a major step the new directives have eliminated the former categories II A and II B which provided for exceptions from applying the main mechanisms for procurement (in particular prior publication) with regard to certain groups of services. The present directives contain fewer such exceptions and instead of excepting certain services they introduce a new form of procurement: the so-called “light procedure” based on simpler procedures. The method can be applied to certain services in the social and health sectors\n\nV\n\nPreface\n\nand the fields of hotel and restaurant services and some legal services etc. In this connection, the introduction of special rules with regard to so-called reserved services should also be mentioned. The new directives contain highly relevant provisions regulating how to deal with procurement with regard to mixed contracts. The same goes for so-called in-house procurement and the possibility of amending a contract after its conclusion. Rules on dynamic purchasing as well as the methods of joint purchasing have been amended. The rules concerning mandatory/voluntary exclusion have been subject to amendment and the concept of self-cleaning which makes it possible for tenderers to make use of a method allowing them, as the case may be, to refute that they should be excluded form tendering, has been introduced. Generally procurement procedures already found in the directives from 2004 have been subject to more intensive and detailed regulation in the directives adopted in 2014 which, notwithstanding the benefits that that may entail, also has led to more complicated regulation than before. It cannot be overlooked that, over time, the bulk of EU legislation on public procurement has grown to an extent that has made it ever more complicated to apply the law of those directives. It has therefore become even more crucial than before, in particular for civil servants and practitioners, to consult the procurement directives and in so doing have the benefit of a legal commentary. We believe that this book in spite of its heavy weight provides a commentary that is easy to consult and use in everyday practice. We (NOMOS and the editors) have found that, given the size and complexity of the area of public procurement, our intention of achieving the best possible result would be best served by making use of experts on the specific issues of public procurement. With authors from different Member States the contributions will to a certain extent reflect different approaches and references just as the knowledge of national case law, ways of transposing the different directives and legal literature (in English or in any other language) will play a part as we find that this approach will enrich the book. However, we have sought harmonisation with regard to language and format of the book whereas the personal writing styles have been kept and therefore will differ between contributions. The book contains a part describing how to use the book. It is found just below. The very volume of this book and of the directives which are reprinted in it mirror that European Union law in the field of public procurement bear testimony to the fact that EU procurement law has come a long way when compared with the modest beginnings and after a period of progress spanning almost fifty years. The relevance of EU procurement law is also reflected in the fact that the number of cases ending before the EU courts have risen considerably over the years. The practice of the European Court of Justice has, of course, not only led to the solution of a number of more or less intricate cases but also to the adoption of amendments or entirely new provisions in the procurement directives. The areas of free movement of goods and harmonisation of national laws, the rules on State aids and competition as well as the significant body of EU procurement law constitute interdependent corner stones of the Single Market and those fields of law have, of course, brought about important legal contributions in the form of textbooks and commentaries. This books adds one more to the list, and it is the hope of NOMOS and of the two editors, professor Dr. Michael Steinicke and Dr. Peter L. Vesterdorf, as well as the various authors contributing to this commentary that their work will come to serve as a valuable multinational instrument of assistance to the many public authorities and other public entities as well as economic operators and assisting lawyers. It is not VI\n\nPreface\n\nforeseen that the directives in force at the present time will be undergoing major reform or amendment in the foreseeable future. It is thus likely that, if well received, the book may come to be solidly placed on the law book shelves in relevant offices all over the EU and in neighbouring countries in which the EU rules on public procurement are or will be applicable. The editors are both affiliated to the lawfirm of Publicure, Denmark and would like to thank the colleagues for interesting discussions on public procurement and the inspiring professional atmosphere. Finally, we thank Dreyers Fond for supporting the translation of parts of the book. The book is updated until second quarter of 2017. Michael Steinicke Silkeborg November 2017\n\nPeter L. Vesterdorf Copenhagen November 2017\n\nVII\n\nHow to use the commentary The book is structured in one introductory chapter and five parts each containing an area of public procurement regulation. The introductory chapter covers the context of public procurement including the EU background, primary law, general principles, other related areas of law, and international rules pertaining to the subject of the commentary. The five different parts of the commentary are the following: Part I: Part II: Part III: Part IV: Part V:\n\nPublic Sector Directive (2014/24) Utilities Directive (2014/25) Concessions Directive (2014/23) Defence and Security Directive (2009/81) Enforcement Directives (1989/665 and 1992/13)\n\nThe first four parts cover the substantive directives, i.e. the directives establishing the procedures to be used when public entities are purchasing from the market. The four directives are to a large degree built on the same skeleton, using the same concepts, principles, covering the same phases etc. and therefore issues like e.g. using the economic thresholds are regulated similarly in the four directives. To gain benefit from these structural similarities as well as to avoid repetition we have structured the commentary with a primary focus on the Public Sector Directive since this is the directive with the most general content and the directive with the largest and most general application. In practice this means that all the provisions in the Public Sector Directive are subject to an extensive commentary. The specific provisions in the other three substantive directives (the Utilities Directive, the Concessions Directive and the Defence and Security Directive) are commented on only in the event that this is not the case in the Public Sector Directive. An example is the open procedure. This procedure is explicitly applicable in two of the directives (the Public Sector Directive and the Utilities Directive). The commentary to the open procedure is therefore extensive in Part I covering the Public Sector Directive but consists primarily of a reference to the Public Sector Directive in the relevant provision in the Utilities Directive. In cases where there are some similarities but also some differences we have tried to balance the reference back to the Public Sector Directive while also describing the points of difference in the relevant article of the specific directive. We have made an effort to describe any differences between the directives where such differences are subtle and where the differences might lead to confusion in practice. This could be the case for entities sometimes subject to the Public Sector Directive and sometimes subject to the Defence and Security Directive (depending on the subject-matter of the contract). If, e.g., the contracting authority wants to apply the procedure competitive dialogue it is imperative that the contracting authority is aware of the differences between the two versions of this specific procedure in the two directives. The index will show the different parts and will make it easier to find the relevant information.\n\nVIII\n\nAbbreviations AG Art. C cf. CFREU Chap.

About the book This book on the public procurement directives is structured as a commentary with 1 the commensurate characteristics. In order to gain an insight into the universe of the procurement directives, it is necessary to introduce a number of other rules which also influence the public sector’s award of contracts and which therefore might or could be used as an alternative to or together with the procurement directives.\n\n0.2. History During the first years of the European Community (now the EU) there were no spe- 2 cific rules on public procurement. The handling of public purchasing was covered by the EC Treaty’s rules alone. The reason for not adopting any rules on public procurement was that the Member States did not regard public procurement from a common market perspective. Many countries saw public procurement as an issue to be determined by the individual Member States, since by its nature procurement is not a regulatory activity and something that was considered to belong to the autonomy of the Member States. It was widely accepted that public authorities could without restrictions choose the specific collaborator or tender the authority wanted – irrespective of the contracting entity’s reason for the choice. At that time contracting entities were already covered by the Treaty and the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality, but there was not much focus on the tendering procedures now covered by the procurement directives. The first public procurement directive was adopted in 1970. In general it had a broad 3 scope and aimed to create transparency about public contracts.1 Shortly thereafter the\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n1\n\n0. Introduction\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nfirst Public Works Directive was passed, Council Directive 71/305/EEC. Almost six years later the next directive saw the light of day (Council Directive 77/62/EEC – the Public Supply Directive). It took almost an additional ten years before the procurement area once again was in focus. In connection with the Community’s comprehensive plan of completing The Single European Market, a White Paper on this ambitious project, COM (85) 310 was passed in the middle of the 1980 s. Public procurement was emphasized as one of the focus areas by the Commission, and the process culminated with the adoption of four public procurement directives in the beginning of the 1990 s: one in 1992 (services) and three in 1993 (goods, works and utilities). During the 1990 s, the Commission continuously worked on improving the public procurement regulatory scheme and a major step was taken in 1996 with the Green Paper on public procurement, COM (96) 583. The Green Paper included a number of areas which the Commission wanted to improve, including topics like: more flexible procedures, possibilities for including social and environmental conditions in the procurement rules and possibilities for making electronic procurement. In 1998, the Green Paper was followed by COM (98) 143 which introduced several specific improvements of the public procurement directives. At first they resulted in minor amendments of the directives then in force with the introduction of directives 97/52/EC and 98/4/EC. A further minor amendment of the directives was implemented in 2001 with directive 2001/78/EC on the use of standard forms in connection with regulations on public procurement. In 2000, the efforts to pass two new public procurement directives started: a consolidated classic directive (The Public Works Directive, the Services Directive and the Procurement Directive combined in one directive), hereinafter called the Public Sector Directive (Directive 2004/18), and the Utilities Directive (2004/17). These public procurement directives were first drafted in connection with COM (2000) 275 and COM (2000) 276 (the Utilities Directive), respectively and were adopted on March 31 st 2004. Compared to the previous directives the most significant amendments of the directives included the merging of the three previous directives (construction works, goods and services now in one directive), more express regulation of electronic communication in connection with procurement (as a result of the technical development), improved possibilities of specifying the subject-matter of the contract, requirements on weighting of award criteria, introduction of several new procurement procedures (competitive dialogue, dynamic purchasing systems and electronic auctions), express regulation of suspension of so-called non-economic conditions in tendering procedures and rules on framework contracts. A major issue in procurement regulation had previously been how to handle works, goods and services within the defence and securities sector. Defence procurement was regulated in the two directives but merely by a reference to TFEU Articles 346 and 347 excluding defence purchasing from the scope of the directives. With the purpose of not missing out of the large potential found in the defence sector the EU legislator adopted a procurement directive on defence and security procurement in 2009 (Directive 2009/81/EC the Defence and Security Directive). For more on the Security and Security Directive, see part IV of this commentary. The last step in the ongoing development of secondary procurement legislation in the EU is formed in what could be called the most comprehensive round of procurement legislation yet. The formal process was initiated by submitting proposals for a Public Sector Directive, a Utilities Directive and – as something quite new – a Concessions Di1\n\n2\n\nSee directive 71/304/EEC – the so-called Liberalizing Directive.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nrective.2 The three directives were adopted in February 2014 with a deadline for implementation by April 2016: Public Sector Directive 2014/24/EU, Utilities Directive 2014/25/EU and Concessions Directive 2014/23/EU. The new directives are basically continuing the majority of the basic principles, lines and provisions from the previous directives. The basic model for how to conduct a procurement has not been changed, but a number of amendments has been made in order to observe certain practical and policy considerations. In the preamble to the Public Sector Directive recital 2 the overall scope for the policy changes is presented in the following way: “Public procurement plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy, set out in the Commission Communication of 3 March 2010 entitled ‘Europe 2020, a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’ (‘Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’) as one of the marketbased instruments to be used to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth while ensuring the most efficient use of public funds. For that purpose, the public procurement rules adopted pursuant to Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council should be revised and modernised in order to increase the efficiency of public spending, facilitating in particular the participation of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in public procurement, and to enable procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals. There is also a need to clarify basic notions and concepts to ensure legal certainty and to incorporate certain aspects of related well-established caselaw of the Court of Justice of the European Union.”\n\nThese considerations have led to several new initiatives in the directives among others: the introduction of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD – a new and intended less burdensome and bureaucratic way of documenting the qualification requirements set forth by the contracting authority), introduction of the new procedure called innovation partnership (allowing a comprehensive contractual set- up including an innovation process as well as a delivery phase), a number of different rules intended to improve the access to public contracts for SME’s, and (yet again) increased focus on the possibilities of observing non-economic considerations (environmental, social, etc), as well as a new system for services (from a distinction between A- and B-services to a distinction between services and social and other specific services). On a path running parallel to the various substantive procurement directives there 9 has been a development of the regulatory regime of enforcing the procurement rules. Public procurement is characterized by a particular process which gives rise to a number of very specific challenges in regards to enforcement which is why there was a need to introduce enforcement tools directed at these very particular enforcement issues. The first enforcement directive saw the light of day in 1989 – Directive 1989/665 on enforcement of the public procurement directives (the Remedies Directive) and in 1992 – Directive 1992/13 on enforcement of the Utilities Directive (the Utilities Remedies Directive). Both directives were amended through Directive 2007/66 which introduced new sanctions and a standstill period following the award of contract. Afterwards the provisions on enforcement have been harmonized across the procurement directives (through the Defence and Security Directive 2009/81 Articles 55-64 – enforcement rules – and the Concessions Directive 2014/23 Articles 46-47 – which amends the Remedies Directives). The Remedies Directives are subject to commentary and analysis in Part V. 2 The proposals were presented on the basis of COM(2010) 608 Towards a Single Market – For a highly competitive social market economy. They were set forth in proposal for a Directive on public procurement – COM(2011) 896; a proposal for a Directive on procurement by entities in the water, energy, transport end postal services sector – COM(2011) 895, and a proposal for a Directive on the award of concession contracts – COM(2011) 897.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n3\n\n0. Introduction\n\n0.2.1. The purposes behind the public procurement directives 10\n\nThe background for the procurement directives appear from several of the recitals in the preambular considerations of the different directives. The public procurement directives have their legal basis in the TFEU rules on free movement. On the basis of this, the primary purpose of the directives is to implement the internal market. 3 In continuation hereof the purpose is to optimize the competition for public procurement, thereby providing the companies in the internal market with the possibility of participating in tendering, so that all participants get an equal chance in the competition. This appears from C-243/89, the European Commission v Denmark (the Storebaelt case), and the purpose is based on the 9th recital of the preamble to the first Public Works Directive (71/305/ EEC). In the 1st recital to Directive 2014/24 is stated that the general principles of the TFEU must be complied with and to ensure this “for public contracts above a certain value, provisions should be drawn up coordinating national procurement procedures so as to ensure that those principles are given practical effect and public procurement is opened up to competition.” (Our italics) The purpose is furthermore to limit the public sector’s expenses and limit the risk of corruption and criminal fraud with public means, cf. COM (96) 583, The Green Paper on public procurement, paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4. Although not expressed as an actual purpose of the public procurement directives, the consideration for the contracting entity to gain favorable contracts must also be seen as a consideration behind the directives. The consideration for competition, however, plays a more prominent part within procurement law, and the possibilities to gain favorable contracts must be considered an advantageous side-effect from the efforts to generate competition.\n\n0.3. The legal framework 11\n\nFor national public authorities, the joint legal basis for public procurement consists of partly European, partly national, partly international rules. Below the rules outside of the public procurement directives are introduced. 0.3.1. The Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union\n\n12\n\nThe Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union is the primary basis for public procurement at a European level. The principal provisions are the rules on freedom of movement. They constitute the basis for the legal authority for the procurement directives. The relevant provisions are Article 34 (free movement of goods), Article 45 (free movement of workers), Article 49 (right of establishment), Article 56 (freedom to provide cross-border services) and Article 63 (free movement of capital). In addition, Article 18 of the TFEU is also significant (the prohibition of discrimination based on nationality). The provisions of the TFEU are important in two different situations involving procurement. Firstly, the TFEU provisions covering public procurement apply where the public procurement directives do not apply. In such situations, the TFEU provisions are 3 See also case C-237/99, the Commission v French Republic, in which the Court of Justice pointed out that the purpose is to remove the obstacle to the free movement of services and free trade movement and to protect the interests for the economic actors which have been established in a Member State and who wish to offer goods and services to contracting entities in other Member States. In continuation hereof the purpose of the directive is both to remove the risk of granting national tenderers or applicants a preferential position on award of public contracts and the possibility that a body financed by the state, local authorities or other public law bodies are guided by other considerations than economic considerations.\n\n4\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nthe primary rules of the European Union’s legal basis in combination with the general EU-principles. Secondly, the TFEU provisions apply on public procurement also where the public procurement directives apply. In this situation it is necessary to observe the interaction between the TFEU and the public procurement directives, see for example below regarding the interaction between the rules of the directives on technical specifications and TFEU Article 34 on free trade movement (see section 42.4). The rules on freedom of movement primarily contain a prohibition against discrimination between foreign and domestic enterprises, persons, products and services. In addition, the provisions also include a prohibition against certain non-discriminating measures. The Court of Justice has ordered several decisions regarding the use of the TFEU provisions in connection with public procurement, both within and outside the scope of the provisions. In case 45/87, the Commission v. Ireland (Dundalk), the Court of Justice held that it was a violation of Article 34 of the TFEU that an Irish standard was stated as a specification instead of an international standard. The Court of Justice found that it was a violation of (then) the EC Treaty that “or equivalent” was not added in connection with the indication of the Irish standard, so other contractors than Irish contractors could have had their quality evaluated. In the cases C-275/98, Unitron and C-324/98, Telaustria, the Court of Justice has considered the scope of the contracting bodies’ obligations in connection with public procurement outside the scope of the directives. In the Telaustria-case the Court of Justice determined that “notwithstanding the fact that, as Community law stands at present, such contracts are excluded from the scope of Directive 93/38, the contracting entities concluding them are, nonetheless, bound to comply with the fundamental rules of the Treaty, in general, and the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality, in particular. As the Court of Justice established in … [Unitron]…, that principle implies, in particular, an obligation of transparency in order to enable the contracting authority to satisfy itself that the principle has been complied with. That obligation of transparency which is imposed on the contracting authority consists in ensuring, for the benefit of any potential tenderer, a degree of advertising sufficient to enable the services market to be opened up to competition and the impartiality of procurement procedures to be reviewed.”4 It is established in case law that there is no de minimis level for the TFEU rules on 13 free movement – in contrast to e.g. the competition rules and the public procurement directives which both contain de minimis rules. This was established in C-59/00, Vestergaard, where the Court of Justice had to consider an inquiry from the Danish Complaints Board for Public Procurement. The obligation which is established in Unitron and Telaustria has practical significance for the contracting authority. Unfortunately, the exact scope of the obligation has not been determined. The obligation must be assumed to be fulfilled to the extent that the contracting authority contacts a number of enterprises with a view to establishing a competitive situation and where the awarding process itself is of such nature that participating enterprises and regulatory authorities can survey the process. The obligations which are imposed on the contracting authorities according to the TFEU depend on the size of the task which is put out for tender. Thus, more comprehensive requirements will be made to the establishment of the transparency in connection with large excluded con4 See Telaustria, paragraphs 60-62. For more information about the later case law on use of the principles and the rules on free movement outside the scope of the public procurement directives, see section 0.3.2.4.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n5\n\n0. Introduction\n\ntracts than to procurement of goods below the limits of the threshold values as the first contracts mentioned are presumed to be more interesting for the community. Although this practice seems quite clear, a few decisions could highlight the Court of Justice’s use of de minimis evaluation in some cases. On the specific level, the decision in C-231/03, Coname may be an expression of such an assessment in relation to the free movement of services. However, there is reason to distinguish between the various free movements in this respect. This is due to the fact that in relation to the free trade movement and freedom of movement for persons it has clearly been rejected to establish a de minimis limit. The question of de minimis is narrowly related to the question of when a certain public contract can be expected to have a European relevance. The two assessments are primarily conceptually separated by the fact that the de minimis evaluation is based on whether there is enough European interest where the assessment of whether there is cross-border interest is based on whether there is any European interest at all. Only a level of degree separates the two. See also section 0.3.2.4. 14 In addition to the provisions on free movements, the contracting entities and the procurement situation in general are also potentially subject to the TFEU competition rules. The most important provisions are Article 101 (agreements restricting competition), Article 102 (prohibition of abuse of a dominant position), Article 106 (public enterprises and enterprises which have been granted special or exclusive rights) and Article 107 (State aid prohibition).5 Usually, Articles 101 and 102 do not apply to the relationship between contracting entity and tenderer (i.e. the traditional relation involving the procurement rules), but primarily apply to the relationship between the tenderers.6 This is because the public authorities are units which carry out exercise of authority, i.e. activities not subject to the competition rules. In order to apply the competition rules, it must be undertakings, which, according the Court of Justice, includes all types of entities engaging in economic activity, regardless of the organization and formal framework of the activity.7 Decisions from the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance have assessed whether public procurement in itself implies an economic activity. The primary case is C-205/03 P, Federacion de Empreses de Instrumentacion Clentifica Media Technical y Dental (FENIN) issued on 11 July 2006. In this decision, first the General Court (T-319/99) and later the Court of Justice had the opportunity to consider whether a contracting authority and its purchasing activities could be regarded as an economic activity in the understanding found in the competition rules. The Court of Justice affirmed the General Court’s decision and thus found that a purchasing activity in itself is not an expression of an economic activity in the sense of the competition rules. The decisive factor was that a link was made between a purchase and the later use of the purchased goods or services. In cases where the subsequent application of the good was not a resale or use in connection with commercial activities, the purchase itself did not constitute an economic activity. In other words: If a contracting authority makes purchases or services to be used in connection with the contracting authority’s ordinary\n\n5 The literature has just in recent years started to show interest in the intersection between competition law and public procurement law. The most prominent contribution to this field has been given by Albert Sanchez Graells who gives a thorough and interesting (and somewhat debatable) perspective on the relation between the two areas of law in his book: Public Procurement and the EU Competition Rules. 6 Typical non-compliances between tenderers in connection with call for tenders are the so-called bid riggings or agreements on coordination of call for tenders. The tenderers pre-fix the prices on tenders and thereby also those who are going to be awarded the contract in question. 7 See i.e. the decision of The Court of Justice in C-41/90, Höfner.\n\n6\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nactivities as a public authority, the purchasing activity will not be regarded as an economic activity and thus not be included by the competition rules. The Court of Justice has confirmed this line of thinkning in subsequent cases, see C-113/07 P, Selex. The decisions have been thoroughly critisised by numerous commentators mentioning different arguments in support of their critique. Following arguments for leaving the FENIN reasoning and result have been advanced (among others): that the FENIN case fails to focus on the effect of the measure established through public purchasing, that the result in the FENIN case law makes poor economic sense8 and that the FENIN case is unnecessarily formalistic). On the other hand it could be argued that the critics have neglected to consider the overall balance in the internal market regulation between the rules directed at the private undertakings (competition rules) and the rules directed at public authorities (free movement rules). Through this balance the primary regulation of public authorities’ activities (including procurement) is the free movement provisions – and these provisions also constitute the legal foundation for the procurement directives. The public procurement directives include rules on exclusive rights, namely the situa- 15 tions where a special or exclusive right is awarded, and situations where a unit, which holds such a right, makes procurements. Within this field the public procurement directives supplement Article 106 of the TFEU on special and exclusive rights. The State aid rules have been cited in a few cases, and it is established in practice that 16 public procurement may not be qualified as “hidden” state aid. This was established in case 21/88, Du Pont de Nemours. Italy adopted a law which decided that all public bodies and administrations had to make 30% of their procurement of radiological films and liquids from industrial producers, farming and craft industries with plants and factories in Southern Italy (the Mezzogiorno) where these products were to be produced wholly or partly. During a case between Du Pont de Nemours Italiana SpA and Unità sanitaria locale no. 2 di Carrera, the ECJ was presented with questions regarding the Italian law’s compliance with the (then) EC Treaty’s State aid provisions.9 The Court of Justice laid down that the Treaty’s provisions on State aid under no circumstances could serve as basis for repealing the consequences of Article 28 of the Treaty (now: Article 34 TFEU). This is substantiated by the fact that both sets of rules aim at ensuring the free movement of goods between the Member States on normal competitive conditions. In C-94/99, Arge, it was determined that it did not conflict with the procurement rules that a tenderer receives State aid. The result of this decision is incorporated into the public procurement directive as Article 55 (now: Directive 2014/24 Article 69) on the handling of abnormally low tenders now includes a rule on the possibilities of rejecting abnormally low tenders from enterprises which have re-\n\nAlbert Sanchez Graells, Public Procurement and the EU Competition Rules, p. 163. Regarding the intersection between tendering procedures (and the procurement rules) and the State aid rules there are a large number of contributions from the literature, see (among other contributions): Mihalis Kekelekis & Kine Neslein, Public procurement and state aid, in Bovis (ed.), Research Handbook on EU Public Procurement Law, Chapter 15; Albert Sanchez Graells, Public Procurement and State Aid: Reopening the Debate?, in PPLR, 2012, p. 205, Battista, The respect of State Aid rules in PPPs, EPPPLR, 2007, p. 70, Michael Steinicke, Competitive neutrality – critical remarks, in Hartig Danielsen, HagelSørensen, Heide-Jørgensen & Nielsen (eds.): Festskrift til Jens Fejø; Michael Steinicke, Public contracts through procurement – can there still be state aid?, in Pros and Cons of Competition in/by the Public Sector, Konkurransverket, 2009; Sue Arrowsmith, The Law of Public and Utilities Procurement, p. 302 et seq.; Pernille Edh Hasselgård, The Use of Tender Procedures to Exclude State Aid: The Situation under the EU 2014 Public Procurement Directives, in EPPPL, 2017, p. 16. 8\n\n9\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n7\n\n0. Introduction\n\nceived State aid. For further information, see the comment on Article 69, part I, chapter 69. Apart from the above-mentioned situations, there are a number of cases where tenders (or public procurement) influence the use of the State aid rules. First of all it could be State aid in breach of Article 107 of the TFEU if a public unit pays overprice for a service bought from a private supplier which is then favored by a pecuniary benefit. Secondly, the call for tenders is expected to involve a presumption that the agreement is based on market price and thus that no overprice for the service occurs, cf. for example C-280/00, Altmark.10 Thirdly, it is furthermore determined in i.a. T-116/01, P&O European Ferries that the condition that call for tenders which are basically not needed may be an advantage resulting in State aid even though the price which is paid for the service does not differ from the market price and even though the agreement has been entered into on market conditions.11 The advantage which results in aid is thus not overprice but, on the contrary, tendering of services which the contracting authority does not need. 0.3.2. The general principles Based on the rules of the TFEU, a number of general principles have been established with regard to public procurement specifically in connection with procurement outside the scope of the public procurement directives. Within the scope of the public procurement rules, especially the principle of equal treatment and the principle of transparency are important (for further information, see the comment on Article 18). 18 A general EU legal principle can be defined as a general proposition of law of some importance from which concrete rules derive and also that a principle determines some considerations which point in a specific direction but which does not necessarily lead to a specific result.12 Thus, a principle is very often less specific that concrete and detailed rules. A thorough analysis of the general principles within EU law shows several types of such principles and that they vary very much in terms of purpose and content. In this context, it is therefore not appropriate to try making a general definition of general principles apart from what can be derived from the above. The 1st recital of the preamble of the Public Sector Directive has indicated that the general EU legal principles, which are derived from the provisions on free movement, such as the principles on non-discrimination, equal treatment, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency, shall apply as regards public authorities’ award of contracts. The principles of equal treatment, transparency and proportionality are explicitly regulated in Article 18. Those principles will not be subject of detailed mention in this chapter. For a thorough analysis, see the commentary to Article 18. 17\n\n10 An apparent discrepancy exists between the two first situations. But the first situation only looks at the contract and the services exchanged, not whether the agreement was awarded via tender. The Altmark decision may indicate that the Court of Justice in general will consider the award of public contracts as an expression of exchange of services at market price. It may well be that the Altmark decision primarily should be viewed in the light of the specific situation and the specific evaluation which were needed in this situation. Thus, it may well be that if it, in connection with a specific tender, can be ascertained that the tender procedure has been faulty, it cannot unconditionally be cited that the purchase price is an expression of the real market price. Here the fact that the contract was awarded via a tender may very well not exclude that an enterprise has got an advantage (via overprice) in the sense of article 107 of the TEUF. 11 About this, see Jens Hillger, The award of a public contract as State aid within the meaning of Article 87 (1) EC, Public Procurement Law Review, 2003, p. 109 et seq. 12 Takis Tridimas, The General Principles of EC Law, p. 1.\n\n8\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\n0.3.2.1. The non-discrimination principle One of the most important principles within EU law is the principle on non-discrimi- 19 nation. This principle is found in explicit form in Article 18 of the TFEU and the principle is the conceptual framework for the TFEU’s provisions on free movement of goods, persons, services and capital and these provisions therefore contain more specific versions of the principle.13 The provisions in question are applicable to all Member States and public bodies in the Member States. Thus, the rules on, e.g., free movement of goods must be obeyed in connection with public procurement. The provisions of the TFEU are primarily directed towards discrimination based on nationality but do also include specific rules with prohibition against discrimination based on other conditions, including gender discrimination. The concepts discrimination and differential treatment are used synonymously in the following.14 In legal terms EU defines discrimination as cases where equal situations are treated unequally or cases where unequal situations are treated equally. There is not much difference between the non-discrimination principle and the perhaps most important principle within public procurement law: the principle of equal treatment. Basically, the principles express a negative respectively a positive emphasis of the same requirement: all tenderers are subject to the same terms and conditions in connection to tendering procedures. For a more thorough description, reference is made to the comment on Article 18 (Part I, chapter 18). Contrary to these specific prohibitions against discrimination, the prohibition in Article 18 of the Public Sector Directive is general, i.e. it is not directed towards discrimination based on special conditions (for example nationality or gender) but on all other types of discrimination. 0.3.2.2. The proportionality principle 0.3.2.2.1. The proportionality principle in general The proportionality principle is a general EU legal principle which aims to ensure 20 that the decisions made and the measures initiated are proportionate compared to the desired goals. The proportionality principle is relevant in many different situations. But a special example is the judgment of whether the Member States’ measures, which may have a trade barrier effect, can be accepted because the trade barrier effect is an acceptable side-effect from the handling of a legitimate consideration, e.g. the consideration to the environment or social conditions. The proportionality principle consists of three elements: 1) an assessment of the spe- 21 cific measure’s ability to handle the consideration which is the aim of the measure, 2) an assessment of the necessity of the measure and, finally, 3) a weighing out of opposite considerations based on an additional determined value of the considerations. The ability assessment consists of a judgment of whether the measure in question is suitable for handling the consideration which the contracting authority invokes. The assessment of necessity consists of an assessment of whether the consideration in question could have been handled with less intrusive means than the measure chosen. If\n\nSee Article 34, Article 45, Article 49, Article 56 and Article 67 of the TFEU. The concepts are often used synonymously in the literature, although formally speaking discrimination sometimes is said to be unfair discrimination implying that other types of discrimination is fair. This difference is not regarded to have any significance in this connection and therefore there is no distinction between the concepts. 13\n\n14\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n9\n\n0. Introduction\n\nthis is the case, the measure is not proportional compared to the consideration attended to. The final weighing, or the proportionality principle strictly speaking, consists in weighing the opposite considerations against each other. Extensive trade barriers or non-compliance with the procurement rules cannot be legitimated by all types of considerations. Or in other words: Substantive breaches of prohibitions could only be legitimized in essential or significant considerations. To some extent, the type of considerations which legitimize the deviation from the public procurement directives can be different from the considerations which legitimize the deviation from the TFEU’s prohibitions. While only non-economic societal breaches can be legitimized in the last-mentioned case, there has been no delimitation of the types of considerations which are considered legitimate according to the public procurement directives. Legitimate considerations according to the public procurement directives could also be considerations related to the possibilities of reaching an appropriate agreement, for instance that a contract cannot be defined in a satisfactory manner, or that a call for tenders must be made in such a hurry that the normal deadlines cannot be obeyed. 0.3.2.2.2. The proportionality principle in relation to the public procurement situation Proportionality is a general EU legal principle, and as such it will also apply to public procurement. The principle was previously mentioned in the preamble but is now explicitly part of the provision on the general principles. The principle of proportionality has not been the explicit subject of cases before the court. The reason might be that the principle of proportionality within the area of the free movement which forms the foundation of the procurement rules has the function of balancing opposing interests and is therefore not subject to individual scrutiny. Another reason maybe that the principle has not been explicitly included in the provision relating to general principles until the 2014 directives. In relation to the public procurement directives, the proportionality principle will be applied in a way that differs from what is the case in connection with the trail of the breach of the provisions on free movement. The contracting entity must especially be expected to comply with the proportionality principle when it comes to the handling of negotiated procedures. The use of the proportionality principle is particularly required here as the contracting entity is not subject to any procedural limitations by the directive in connection with this procedure. The contracting entity must determine the procedure. The contracting entity is subject to a proportionality obligation so the contracting entity must prepare the procedure in such a way that it is possible to maintain and control the competition in connection with the negotiations. Therefore the principle of equal treatment and the principle of transparency are the pivotal principles, but the proportionality principle can have a supplementary role. Likewise, the proportionality principle must be observed in connection with the limitation of the service, on the specification of the service, in connection with the assessment of the candidate’s aptitude, in connection with the assessment of the compliance of the specifications and in all the other situations where the contracting entity determines procedures or is entrusted with autonomy. 23 Contrary to the other general principles which apply to public procurement, the proportionality principle also has a protective meaning directed at the contracting entity. The principles on equal treatment, transparency and mutual recognition all aim to ensure maintenance of competitive situations and that the contracting entity does not limit 22\n\n10\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nthe enterprises’ possibilities of being eligible for a specific task. Contrary to this, safeguarding proportionality also protects the contracting entity from requirements which impose inordinate obligations on the contracting entity with the result that these obligations may impede the possibilities of the contracting entity of getting an adequate, applicable procedure of being awarded a contract. Like this, and in this context, the proportionality principle could be an essential counterweight compared to the other principles regarding requirements. Basically, all the contracting entity’s dispositions are subject to the proportionality principle. However, the proportionality principle is not always important; examples where the proportionality principle is not used or is less important could be cases where the contracting entity could change to negotiated procedure based on the fact that there are not (enough) admissible tenders. Practice from the Court of Justice, however, indicates that the contracting entity may also annul, cf. the Metalmecanicca case. It could be stated that as starting point, where possible, the contracting entity ought to choose the most competitive solution instead of a solution which induces less optimization of competition. Or: the least extensive (the most proportional) solution would not be annulment of the tender but rather using a more lenient solution (negotiated procedure). Although this solution seems to conform best with the proportionality principle the contracting entity will probably not be directly obliged to choose the negotiated settlement. The considerations which normally have to be balanced are, on the one side, the desire for competition through the tender and, on the other side, the objective of the contracting entity, meaning the intention to obtain a flexible and practical award of contract with the best possible contract as the result. 0.3.2.2.3. The applicability of the proportionality principle in public procurement outside the scope of the directives The proportionality principle has a two-tier application regarding public procure- 24 ment outside the scope of the directives. Firstly, the proportionality principle must be generally applied to problems involving procurement law which arise out of public procurement. Secondly, the proportionality principle is part of the review regarding the free movements which most often is the primary applicable law in connection with public procurement contracts awarded outside the scope of the directive. There is a difference between the two reviews which may have a practical significance. Before the proportionality review pursuant to the provisions on the free movements, the Court of Justice assesses the underlying objectivity of the considerations. Only societal considerations can be handled legitimately pursuant to the Treaty’s provisions on the free movements. All other considerations, including considerations which are due to purely commercial conditions or practical conditions regarding award of contract, cannot legitimate non-compliance of the prohibition against, i.a., trade restrictions. Regarding a general application of the proportionality principle in connection with public procurement, there are no limits as to which considerations are legitimate. This is also understood from the directive’s escape clauses which for in most cases concerned are of a practical nature. In connection with the general weighing of proportionality in public procurement, it is thus not the nature of the consideration but primarily its weight which is assessed. Regarding the contracts which, as a rule, are subject to the directives, but which nevertheless as a result of explicit exceptions in the directives are not covered by the procedural rules of the directives the principles also apply.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n11\n\n0.

The principle of mutual recognition 0.3.2.3.1. Generally about the principle of mutual recognition 01. The principle of mutual recognition has been established in connection with the rules on freedom of movement.15 The principle implies a Member State’s obligation to recognize qualifications obtained in another Member State even though the enterprise or person, who claims to possess the qualifications, does not hold the documentation otherwise required in the first Member State. The principle shall be used in all cases where qualifications are sought to be recognized in other Member States than the one where the qualifications have been obtained. 0.3.2.3.2. The principle of mutual recognition in connection with public procurement The principle is a general EU principle and therefore it is also going to be applied in connection with public procurement. In this context, the principle has a primary scope which covers the assessment of the applicant’s qualifications and the assessment of the qualifications and certifications underlying the submitted tenders.16 As mentioned above, the principle is one of the general principles to be applied with regard to public procurement, cf. the 1st recital of the preamble of the Public Sector Directive. The principle on mutual recognition concerns all types of documentation of qualifications in connection with the two evaluation phases: the (pre-)qualification and the award.17 26 In regard to the prequalification or selection, the directives lay down a range of qualifications or conditions which the contracting entity requires to be documented by means of evidence. These conditions are the applicant enterprises’ economic, financial and technical standing. Any other characteristics than the before-mentioned are not allowed to be used as background for the evaluation of the enterprises.18 In relation to the award, the contracting entity may require, e a, in principle, non-exhaustive list of requirements to be met and take the view that a, in principle, non-exhaustive range of conditions may be applied to the award of the contract. It is only to a limited degree that there are requirements to the documentation of the prequalification and the award,19 and the principle of mutual recognition is very important when it comes to public procurement. 20 Contrary to the qualitative selection (see section 58 et seq.), the quantitative selection 21 (see section 65) includes the option of selecting the enterprises on the basis of a propor25\n\nIn regard to the free movement of goods, see case 120/78, Cassis de Dijon. A range of the public procurement directives’ specific rules on presentation of requirements and criteria are thus connected to the principle of mutual recognition, see for example the rules on technical specifications in the comment on Article 42. 17 An example of the application of the principle of mutual recognition, see case 45/87, the Commission v Ireland (Dundalk). 18 The principle is also applied on documentation to be examined in order to prove that an enterprise is not in bankruptcy, has not committed criminal acts, has no debt to the public, etc. pursuant to Article 57. See the comment on this provision. 19 In relation to the documentation of technical capacity of the enterprises, see the comment on Article 58. 20 Pursuant to Article 57 specific options are listed to document compliance with the requirements. 21 Qualitative selection covers that part of the pre-qualification which concerns evaluation of whether the enterprises comply with the minimum requirements they are required; quantitative selection covers a situation, where the contracting entity is obliged to limit the number of enterprises. 15\n\n16\n\n12\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\ntional compliance of the selection criteria. In such cases, the principle of mutual recognition is less important as the principle is primarily relevant when making an absolute comparison (i.e. do the enterprises meet fixed requirements?), and not, as is the case in connection with the quantitative selection, when making a relative comparison (i.e which of the enterprises survive the absolute comparisons, which meet the requirements in the best way?). The principle on mutual recognition has already played a role in product evaluation 27 in the case of public procurement in several cases for the Court of Justice. In cases regarding comparison of products, the principle of mutual recognition forms the implicit basis for the comparison.22 The TFEU (and to a lesser degree the public procurement directives) allow reference to trade marks, as long as they are followed by the wording “or the like”.23 The wording indicates a comparison between the reference product and the products upon which the tenderers base their tenders. There should be a distinction between an actual and a formal recognition. The actual recognition is for example expressed by product comparison, i.e. it means that the actual qualities of the products are recognized. The formal recognition is expressed in connection with recognition of documentation, i.e. it is another type of documentation (e.g. foreign accounting standards or the like) which is recognized instead of the documentation which is required by the contracting entity. It must be assumed that it is the actual recognition which primarily needs to be ensured. This is due to the fact that the entire EU procurement law is based on a system of references and that specific assessments of actual qualities make the basis for the evaluation phases. In cases where it is certain that a formal recognition provides a security as regards compliance with the actual qualifications, this is adequate. However, it is not possible to require more than a formal recognition in cases where the documentation consists of European standards. In such cases, the contracting entity does is not permitted to require actual recognition. As a rule, there are no limits regarding which qualifications are subject to an evaluation of recognition. It may concern different types of documentation of accounting, documentation for linguistic qualifications, certificates, product features and the like documented by standards, authentication requirements etc. Regarding the free movements, it is especially certificates and other types of qualification documentation which have forced the application of the principle of mutual recognition. Within procurement law this category is supplemented with recognition of the physical characteristics and design of products. 0.3.2.3.3. The principle of mutual recognition outside the scope of the directives As is the case with the other directives, the principle of mutual recognition also ap- 28 plies outside the scope of the directives. This means that the principle must be observed regarding procurement which either has a contract value below the threshold value or is exempt from the directives due to other reasons. As practice also shows, there will probably not be any real difference between the evaluation of recognition within or outside the scope of the directives. The considera-\n\n22 See the Dundalk case mentioned above, and the cases C-395/93, Commission v the Netherlands (UNIX I) and 328/98, Commission v Austria (UNIX II). 23 Within the framework of the public procurement directives only trademarks can be used as reference products if the contracting entity cannot sufficiently precisely and intelligibly describe the subject-matter of the contract, see section 42.4.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n13\n\n0. Introduction\n\ntions mentioned above also apply for the principle on mutual recognition where the TFEU is the primary legal basis. On the application of the principle of mutual recognition in thr case of award of concession contracts, see the Commission’s interpretative communication EU Official journal 2000 C 121, p. 2. 0.3.2.4. Application of the principles outside the scope of the directive One of the questions of recent years which have attracted much attention within procurement law concerns the obligations resulting from the general principles and provisions laid down in the TFEU when procurement is made outside the scope of the public procurement directives.24 The number of procurement contracts outside the scope of the directives is large and covers a great variety of situations. A lot of questions arise in regard to purchasing procedures outside the scope of the directives. The question with most merit is: which obligations follow from the principles and provisions on free movement. Another question is whether the contracting entity in these different situations must be subject to identical obligations compared to the directives. This is answered in the following sections. The situations which are primarily legally based on the TFEU provisions and the general EU principles are partly those situations where the contracting entity is completely outside the scope of the directives and partly the situations where the contracting entity to some degree is outside the scope of the directives’ specific obligations. Previously, the most common situations outside the directives were concession contracts, B-services, contracts subject to specific exemptions, and contracts below the economic thresholds. With the recent adjustments of the procurement regime concession contracts are now subject to the procedural requirements laid out in the Concessions Directive (2014/23 – see the commentary in Part III). The distinction between Aservices and B-services has now been removed and most B-services are now subject to the full procurement procedure – only a few services are exempt through the so-called “light regime”.25 This leaves only contracts below the thresholds and contracts subject to specific exemptions outside the scope of the directives. 30 In all of these situations there is a potential for the use of the general EU principles. The basic condition is, however, that specific contracts represents a “certain cross-border interest”. In contrast to the (fairly) easily applicable economic thresholds found in the directives the assessment of when a contract has a “certain cross-border interest” is very complex and includes numerous potential elements, e.g. the subject-matter of the contract, the estimated value of the contract, the sector of the purchase and the geographical place for performing the service or works or delivering the goods.26 31 It has been argued that these different situations must be subject to different norms and obligations. See, i.a., Advocate-General Sharpston’s opinion in C-195/04, the Commission v. Finland where the transparency obligation in connection with contracts 29\n\n24 Cf. the literature about this, including e.g. Peter Braun, A Matter of Principles, in Public Procurement Law Review, 2000, p. 39; Rhodri Williams, Contracts awarded outside the scope of the public procurement directives, Public Procurement Law Review, 2007, NA, p. 1; Totis Kotsonis, The Extent of the transparency obligation imposed on a contracting authority awarding a contract whose value falls below the relevant threshold, Public Procurement Law Review, 2007, NA, p. 71; Adrian Brown, Transparency obligations under the EC Treaty in relation to public contracts that fall outside the procurement directives, Public Procurement Law Review, 2005, NA p. 153; Carina Risvig Hansen (now: Hamer), Contracts not covered or not fully covered by the Public Sector Directive; Dacian Dragos & Roberto Caranta (eds.), Outside the EU Procurement Directives – Inside the Treaty?; Sue Arrowsmith, The Law of Public and Utilities Procurement, chap. 4. 25 The Public Sector Directive Articles 74-77 only requires a minimum level of procedural rules and thereby leaves room for the use of the general EU principles.\n\n14\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nwhich fall below the relevant threshold seems to present a special role, and Rhodri Williams,27 who seems to suggest that there may be a difference between (previous) appendix II B services on the one side and service concessions and contracts of minor economic value on the other side. However, the obligations cannot be assumed to differ depending on whether or not the exception is based on one reason or another in the public procurement directives. If, pursuant to the TFEU, the obligations differ, then this is due to the fact that within the application of the TFEU provisions there is basis for differentiating, not because a given contract according to secondary regulation (the public procurement directives) coincidentally is classified as an exception. Examples of such a situation are cases where only one economic operator can deliver the service in question. According to the public procurement directives, there is allows for excluding the most restrictive provisions of the directives in these situations and choose a more flexible type of procedure, i.e. the negotiated procedure.28 Under the auspices of the TFEU there is also basis for an exemption from the strictest TFEU obligations, but this is due to the independent or per se condition stating that there is no reason to establish a competitive situation if only one enterprise can be provider. The TFEU and the general principles have a significantly different character com- 32 pared to the detailed public procurement rules. Thus, it is unclear which exact obligations follow from these general rules. In recent years, the Court of Justice has been presented with a number of cases where exactly this theme has been in focus. These cases have provided some clarification regarding which specific obligations rest with the contracting entity when it comes to procurement outside the scope of the public procurement directives. However, the decisions still leave a number of questions unanswered. The following sections provide an analysis of the relevant decisions in order to determine which obligations rest with the contracting entity in this connection. As the Court of Justice’s interpretation of the obligations resting upon the contracting entity pursuant to the TFEU has only to a limited degree resulted in a clarification to the benefit of the contracting entities, the rulings of the Court of Justice’s have been dealt with by different interpretative sources. These have been partly provided by the literature, but primarily by different interpretative communications from the Commission. The most important ones are the Commission’s interpretative communication on community law which applies to the award of contracts which are not or are only partly included in the public procurement directives (OJ 2006/C 179/02), the Commission’s Green Paper on public-private partnerships and community law on public contracts and concessions (COM(2004)327), and the Commission’s interpretative note on concessions in OJ 2000 C 121, p. 2. Most of the decisions of the Court of Justice regarding this question have affected the 33 determination of what is the basic requirement to the contracting entity. The first significant statements on the duties of the contracting entities were presented in C-324/98, Telaustria, in which the Court of Justice determined that where the public procurement directives do not apply\n\n26 See C-113/13, Spezzino, para. 49. A number of cases before the EUCJ has dealt with the issue of certain cross-border interest, see among others C-231/03, Coname, C-458/03, Parking Brixen GmbH, C-507/03, Commission v Germany, C-147/06 and C-148/06, SECAP SpA, T-258/06, Germany v Commission, C-91/08, Wall, C-95/10, Strong Seguranca, C-278/14, Enterprise Focused Solutions.

Introduction “… the contracting entities concluding them are, none the less, bound to comply with the fundamental rules of the Treaty, in general, and the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality, in particular. As the Court held in Case C-275/98 Unitron Scandinavia and 3-S, paragraph 31, that principle implies, in particular, an obligation of transparency in order to enable the contracting authority to satisfy itself that the principle has been complied with. That obligation of transparency which is imposed on the contracting authority consists in ensuring, for the benefit of any potential tenderer, a degree of advertising sufficient to enable the services market to be opened up to competition and the impartiality of procurement procedures to be reviewed.”29\n\nThe following debate firstly concerned a further delimitation of the transparency obligation. This obligation is discussed in, i.a., the cases C-458/03, Parking Brixen, C-231/03, Coname, and C-410/04, Comune di Bari.30 34 In the majority of these cases, the general principles (including the principle of transparency) as well as the TFEU’s provisions have been relied upon and used. Although the distinction between the application of the general principles and the TFEU’s specific rules are somewhat unclear in these cases, the distinction is nonetheless significant. This is primarily due to the fact that in cases where the Treaty’s rules are applied, there is a possibility to legitimate any breaches by referring to the exceptions belonging to the Treaty. In part these exceptions involve some explicit exceptions, for example Articles 51 and 52 in relation to the freedom of establishment (Article 49) and services (Article 56). In addition, it is also possible to legitimate breaches through certain exceptions made by the Court of Justice, see for example C-55/94, Gebhard, and case 120/78, Cassis de Dijon. Breach of the free movement rules in connection to public procurement can be seen in two different ways. On the one hand, it can be argued that the TFEU’s specific provisions to ensure the free movement traditionally include a restriction of action, i.e. restrictions against implementing conditions which could have limited the effect of the free movement. The restriction of action does not, however, seem to suffice in connection with public procurement because such infringements do not often consist of acts, i.e. call for tenders or call for competition, but, on the contrary, consist of not initiating (the right) activities. Thus, there was a need for expansion of the traditional frame of restrictions to also including a restriction of omission, i.e. a restriction against staying passive in cases where it is necessary to act in order to ensure the free movements. This duty to act is a consequence of the transparency obligation: transparency with regard to a tender cannot be established unless action takes place. Regarding the public procurement directives, this is just a natural and necessary part of the rules, but in relation to the TFEU’s provisions on free movement, the duty to act is new.31 It is clear that the provisions on free movement are less suited for judging omissions than actions. This is also confirmed in the case law of the Court of Justice which will be examined on the following pages. On the other hand it could be argued that the use of the free movement rules are basically just using the traditional discrimination test when applied to public procurement. In this light the infringement basically works as follows: if a contracting authority does not ask all relevant economic operators to enter the competition some of these will be discriminated against, since they are not given the possibilities given to those invited to join the competition. Therefore, the test is merely one of discrimination. 32 It could be C-324/98, Telaustria, paras 60-62. See furthermore the pending cases in C-507/03, the Commission v The Republic of Ireland, and C-195/04, the Commission v the Republic of Finland. 31 The duty to act is primarily seen in relation to public procurement, but also in a few other situations the Court of Justice has imposed an obligation to act, see for example C-265/95, the Commission v France and C-112/00, Schmidberger. 29\n\n30\n\n16\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nargued, that regardless of which view is chosen the practical problems seem to be identical in regard to applying the free movement rules to public procurement. 0.3.2.4.1. General considerations The following sections introduce the obligations which are derived from different 35 sources. But firstly an overview of some basic conditions which are significant for the application of the TFEU’s provisions and the general principles is provided. Overall, the TFEU’s provisions apply to all procurements (and other transactions) on a market,33 including (and maybe particularly) procurement outside the scope of the public procurement directives. Basically, there is no difference as to which treaty obligations are imposed on the contracting entity irrespective of the reason for a given contract not to be subject to the public procurement directives. One of the most important instruments for determining the scope of application of 36 the public procurement directive is the threshold values indicating the lower level indicating when a public contract (in the context of the directive) is interesting at a European level. In continuation hereof it has sometimes been considered whether there was (or should be) a de minimis threshold for the contracting entity’s obligations in relation to the TFEU’s rules so far as the application on public procurement is concerned. It is obvious that a de minimis threshold could be needed in relation to public procurement. In connection with, e.g., a procurement at the value of Euro 10,000.00, a contracting entity might otherwise be obliged to initiate a competitive procedure resulting in a level of cost which could easily exceed the value of the contract value thus causing a disproportionate administrative burden as a result of the procurement. Unfortunately, there have not been any signs of such a de minimis threshold until recently. In case C-231/03, Coname,34 the Court of Justice found: ”With regard to the case in the main proceedings, it is not apparent from the file that, because of special circumstances, such as a very modest economic interest at stake, it could reasonably be maintained that an undertaking located in a Member State other than that of the Comune di Cingia de’ Botti would have no interest in the concession at issue and that the effects on the fundamental freedoms concerned should therefore be regarded as too uncertain and indirect to warrant the conclusion that they may have been infringed.”35 In its interpretative communication on public procurement outside the scope of the 37 Public Sector Directive, the Commission refers to Coname’s reservation about applying the Treaty’s rules in certain situations stating that this assessment must be made involving the circumstances significant for that specific situation, such as the subject-matter of the contract and expected value and the special conditions which are in evidence for the sector in question (for example the size, structure, commercial practice of the market) and the geographical place to execute the contract.36 According to the Commission, it is the contracting entity itself which has to assess whether there is a European interest in the specific procurement.\n\n32 See C-324/98, Telaustria, paragraph 60 and 61, C-231/03, Coname, paragraph 17, and C-119/06, the Commission v Italy, paragraphs 63 et seq. 33 See, however, Articles 346 and 347 of the TFEU and art. 15 of the Public Sector Directive (see comment on this in Part I). 34 The case concerned a service concession which was excluded from the previous services directive. 35 Paragraph 20. 36 Interpretative communication on award of public contracts outside the scope of the public procurement directive, section 1.3.\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n17\n\n0. Introduction\n\nThe Commission furthermore states that if the contracting entity concludes that the contract in question is important for the internal market, it must award it in accordance with the basic norms derived from community law. 38 Another question of significant relevance for the application of the rules on free movement is whether a contract is awarded to another unit or whether it is just an internal organization of the execution of the assignment. In case of the last-mentioned situation, corresponding to the extended in-house doctrine, the rules on free movement cannot be used. This is determined in C-458/03, Parking Brixen. With regard to the assessment of when an internal transfer is taking place the assessment will be the same as the one used within the scope of the directive, cf. C-107/98, Teckal. Thus decisive is whether the TFEU’s provisions are applied, whether the contracting entity assigns a task to a unit which it exercises control over just as it exercises control over its own departments and where the unit in question handles the majority of its activities together with the contracting entity.37 With the new procurement directives the issue of in-house awarding of contracts is now explicitly regulated in the provisions (e.g. Directive 2014/24 Article 12). The comprehensive case law of so-called extended inhouse awards (the Teckal-case) and the exception for horizontal agreements (the Hamburg-case law) are still applicable to public contracts outside the scope of the directives (and for the Defense and Security Directive, 2009/81, since this directive does not contain any specific rules on in-house awards). 0.3.2.4.2. The basic principles 39\n\nAs mentioned above, the Telaustria case determines that the contracting entities are obliged to observe the TFEU’s basic rules in general and the principle of prohibition of discrimination based on nationality in particular. The same case indicated that this especially implies the obligation to ensure transparency in connection with all contracts concluded (“for any potential tenderer”) and at the same time to ensure transparency in the procedure itself. References are made to the general principles, including the principle of transparency and the principle of prohibition of discrimination based on nationality. Whereas it was clear that these principles apply to procurement outside the scope of the directive, it is less clear regarding the principle of equal treatment. Although the public procurement directives do not apply directly below the threshold values, it must be assumed that the principle of equal treatment to some degree does. This is so because the principle of equal treatment is a general EU (procurement) principle and thus must in general apply to procurement in the Member States even though the contract value is below the threshold value and even though other exceptions from the public procurement directives apply. The EU general principles reflect so important and basic conditions that, in areas regulated by EU law, it would not be correct to dispense with the rules just because you find yourself below a specific economic limit. Although not quite clarified whether the principle of equal treatment in its present shape as reflected in the public procurement directives is applied below the threshold values,38 the contracting body is obliged not to discriminate enterprises in connection with public procurement below the threshold values, cf. C-324/98, Telaustria. The public procurement directives include a range of provisions containing explicit exemptions. This, for example, is the case with regard to Article 15 of the Public Sector C-458/03, Parking Brixen, paragraph 62. Based on the opinion of the Court of Justice in Parking Brixen, paragraph 28, it must be assumed to be the case. 37\n\n38\n\n18\n\nMichael Steinicke\n\n0. Introduction\n\nDirective on defence exception and Article 32 on negotiated procedure. While in the latter case the principle of equal treatment is applied it is more doubtful whether the same applies in the former case. The following deals with the most important questions regarding the application of the TFEU’s rules and the (other) general principles reviewed primarily on the basis of the case law of the Court of Justice. Case law has focused very much on transparency. This case law is divided into two groups: the first one concerns the question about disclosure of the procurement process while the other group concerns requirements with regard to the procedure of award as such. The cases before the Court of Justice have primarily belonged to the first category. 0.3.2.4.3. Transparency of the tendering process The principal element of one part of the case law, which, i.a., is evident in Telaustria is 40 the need to ensure transparency about the procurement phase. Even after several decisions from the Court of Justice it is unclear exactly which requirements are necessary in order to establish transparency. Whereas the statements by the Court of Justice statements have been unclear the Commission’s statements have added clarity regarding the contracting entity’s obligations outside the scope of the public procurement directive. 39 Overall, the legal status can be summarized as follows: Basically, identical obligations apply to creating transparency of the procurement irrespective of whether it concerns specific exemptions or contracts that fall below the threshold values. The contracting entity must make preliminary assessments to find out whether the procurement is of interest to economic operators from the other Member States. Based on this assessment, the contracting entity must choose the model appropriate for the specific contract in order to establish transparency. The contracting entity’s specific obligations to create transparency has not yet been determined with certainty, likewise the lower limit for the creation of transparency has not been clearly outlined. The overall spectrum for the TFEU obligations probably covers activities ranging from an obligation to make an EU adequate publication to a duty to contact a number"
