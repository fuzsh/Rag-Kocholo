The facility will also have 228 labour, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) rooms.\n\nThe hospital will include antenatal and gynaecology, maternal and foetal assessment and early pregnancy assessment outpatient units. There will be an education and training centre, and several public retail and dining venues.\n\nThe project is part of a plan by the Ministry of Health to expand nine hospitals to improve the provision of public health services in Kuwait."
