        "text": "Another milestone for this year!üì¢ #RailBaltica announced tenders for the construction of nearly 53 kilometers of the railway mainline in #Estonia. üí¨The construction of the Rail Baltica mainline is undoubtedly a priority for us in 2024 and the following years. One year from now, we aim to see active railway infrastructure construction on more than a third of the Estonian part of the future high-speed railway. This will allow us to stay on schedule to commence rail traffic in 2030,‚Äù said Anvar Salomets, the Chief Executive Officer of Rail Baltic Estonia. üößTogether with upcoming contract sections, construction activities are expected to take place on 74 kilometers of the Rail Baltica Estonian route within a year, constituting over a third of the entire length of the Estonian mainline. In Harju County, the railway construction will extend from the √úlemiste terminal to the county border. #CEFTransport #RailBaltica More information üîç https://lnkd.in/dU9_xYtJ\n\nQuang Ngai province requests to adjust the capital structure of a 3,500 billion VND project Quang Ngai province is seeking to adjust the capital structure of the Hoang Sa - Doc Soi road project, a key infrastructure initiative. The total investment for the project is 3,500 billion VND, with the central budget portion proposed to be increased from 500 billion VND to 1,300 billion VND. The Provincial People‚Äôs Committee has proposed the Ministry of Planning and Investment to submit to the Prime Minister for consideration, support for additional investment capital of 800 billion VND from the increased central budget source in 2022. The National Assembly has agreed to supplement the capital source for the project, allowing to continue completing the procedures. However, capital will only be allocated when fully meeting the conditions as prescribed by law. The Government has directed to complete the procedural dossier and submit it to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly for consideration before December 31, 2023, to timely allocate capital. The Hoang Sa - Doc Soi road project is expected to clear the bottleneck, forming an important vertical traffic axis of the province, and reduce vehicle flow on National Highway 1 during peak hours. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project is expected to be held on December 22, 2023. #QuangNgai #HoangSaDocSoiRoad #Infrastructure #Investment\n\n#BNCUpdate: Breaking Boundaries: The Morocco-Spain Undersea Railway Tunnel The Morocco-Spain Undersea Railway Tunnel initiative represents a groundbreaking endeavor poised to transform transportation between the two nations.

Key Features: üöá Constructing a 38-kilometer-long undersea railway tunnel beneath the Strait of Gibraltar. üåä 27 kilometers submerged at depths of up to 475 meters, promising unprecedented connectivity. üìà Expected to accommodate 13 million tonnes of goods and 12.8 million passengers annually, enhancing trade and travel. üîç Comprehensive feasibility assessments and safety studies, ensuring technical robustness and adherence to standards. üí∞ Providing updated cost estimates for the entire endeavor, including infrastructural developments on the Moroccan side, to enhance logistical and financial transparency. https://lnkd.in/dQ2kuEWX üîó To learn more about the consultant behind this vision, click the link! üåê Register for free to get exclusive updates on this initiative. #MoroccoSpainRailTunnel #TransnationalTransport #UnderseaRailway #Connectivity #Infrastructure #CrossBorderLink\n\n#WA Budget // Last Thursday, the Western Australian Government released its 2024-25 Budget, which included a total of $11.8 billion of transport related transport infrastructure projects over the next four years. The key highlight for rail was an additional $254 million investment in the transformative METRONET project. It is expected that the Yanchep Rail Extension and the Morley-Ellenbrook Line will be completed this year, with a further three major rail projects expected to be delivered in 2025. Completion of these five major METRONET rail projects will see the delivery of: ‚ñ™ 17 new train stations ‚ñ™ 61.5 kilometres of new tracks ‚ñ™ 5.5 kilometres of new elevated rail ‚ñ™ six hectares of new public open space, and ‚ñ™ the first east-west connecting rail between the Mandurah and Armadale Lines. Also of relevance to rail is the investment of $116 million for Westport, including for early marine, civil and road works to transition container trade from Fremantle to Kwinana, unlocking future trade opportunities and economic capacity. This is in addition to the Federal Government's recent pledge of an additional $33.5 million towards the development of Westport as part of their 2024-25 Budget. The Westport project is the linchpin for future trade growth in Western Australia. It includes planning a new port and the connected road, rail and logistics operations required to move container trade from Fremantle to Kwinana. #WA #rail #investment #majorprojects #metro\n\nüöÇüáªüá≥ Off the rails ‚úÖ üéØ China Railway Construction Co., Ltd. and POWERCHINA show strong interest in joining #Vietnam's infrastructure endeavours, especially the proposed Lao Cai - Hanoi - Haiphong railway project. ü§ùüèº On his visit to China's Guangxi, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on September 16 had important meetings with key stakeholders from China's major corporations.
