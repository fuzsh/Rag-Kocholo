That is what we are good at.\n\nImproving both the bulk and surface properties of steel wire products since almost 140 years. That is what we do better, every day.\n\nOffering innovative solutions that add value to our customers and help them grow their business. That is what makes us better together.\n\nWe purchase approximately 3 million tons of wire rod per year as our basic material. Depending on our customers’ needs, we draw wire from it in different diameters and strengths, even as thin as ultrafine fibers of one micron. We group the wires into cords, ropes and strands, weave or knit them into fabric, or process them into an end product. Depending on the application, we apply coatings which reduce friction, improve corrosion resistance, or enhance adhesion with other materials.\n\nHistory\n\nSince 1952 Cotti&Marchi has been operating in the field of electrical systems with the design and the installation of industrial, residential and technological systems, and with the construction of transformer substations for any need (containerised for large construction sites, armoured for tunnels, etc.). The Company has both its own technical office responsible for designing and order management, and its own operational teams working in construction sites in order to provide maintenance services at a later time when system installations are completed.\n\nThe design and installation of the electrical systems also extends to tertiary industry as office buildings, with normal and emergency lighting systems, structured wiring systems and building automation.\n\nCotti&Marchi has created a specific area related to building electrical transformer transportable substations, both containerised for large construction sites, that armoured tunnel substations for use in tunnel during construction and also when the work is realized.\n\nNowadays the evolution of the technology involves also traditional heating and air-conditioning systems, water and sanitary systems, air/water exchange and treatment systems, gas plants: in each of these systems the electronic component plays an important and essential role managing the systems, if necessary, also with remote control.\n\nFor these reasons, we have enlarged our field of activities including the mechanical installations, ranging from those at the service of industrial processes, such as the cooling and heating systems for industrial machinery and process tanks, the plants for the production and distribution of necessary fluids to the various processes (chilled water, hot water, superheated water, steam for technological purposes, compressed air for technological and instrumental uses), to the gas and fluids distribution systems.\n\nWe also realize the waste water collection systems, residential or industrial, installing treatment systems of industrial waste water resulting from the various processes.\n\nThe activities also include the installation of dedusting and smoke reduction systems, in addition to air conditioning systems for the machines and process equipments, offices, workshops and CED areas. To improve significantly the environmental comfort and to reduce energy consumption, we design and install heating and cooling systems, using radiant panels, floor and ceiling, attached with a system for the environmental humidity control.\n\nSo in order to provide, if well accepted, our customers with the opportunity of a single company in charge and to guarantee better services, in addiction to the production of electrical and mechanical systems, we provide a global service both for new systems that for the maintenance of existing systems.\n\nIn this way our customers can enjoy a post-sales service, concerning technical assistance, management and maintenance of systems: this service is realized by a simple work schedule of maintenance with periodic maintenance works to check the correct functioning of the systems and replace the components worn-out.\n\nAchieving your goal with precision\n\nThroughout the entire duration of the project, our experienced employees are available to you both as consultants and at an operative level for carrying out measurements and evaluations even under the most difficult conditions.\n\nOur services in the area of surveying range from planning and constructing geodetic networks to precise tunneling control and construction surveying up to as-built documentation. The execution of control measurements during all project phases underground and above ground is also part of our scope of services. For this purpose, we use the latest technologies and partly self-developed systems which guarantee the greatest possible degree of efficiency and accuracy. In order to provide you with the necessary information and the basis for decision-making in a clear and timely manner, we have developed customized software solutions.\n\nReferences SIROCCO\n\n2017-2018 Traintunnel Infrabel Brussels, Belgium – Engineering, production & delivery of fan shut off dampers\n\n2017-2018 Metro Warszaw, Poland – Engineering, production, delivery and mounting of fan shut off dampers, smoke extraction and ventilation dampers\n\n2017-2018 Tunnel Amberg, Austria – Engineering, production, delivery & mounting of crosscut ventilation system\n\n2015-2018 Tunnel Neuchâtel, Switzerland – Engineering, production & delivery of fan shut off and butterfly dampers, installation in the tunnel ceiling for concentrated air suction during regular and event operation\n\n2016-2017 Tunnel Scheibengipfel, Germany – Engineering, production, delivery & installation of machinery located in the tunnel ceiling for concentrated air exhaustion during regular and event operation\n\n2015-2017 Tunnel Landwasser, Switzerland – Engineering, production, delivery and installation of escape tunnel ventilation system\n\n2012-2018 Tunnel Eyholz, Switzerland – Engineering, production, delivery & installation of machinery located in the tunnel ceiling for concentrated air exhaustion during regular and event operation\n\n2014-2016 Tunnel Küblis, Switzerland – Installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire\n\n2015-2016 Cross Rail, Great Britain – Engineering, production & delivery of pressure relief dampers\n\n2015-2016 Tauerntunnel, Austria – Refurbishments of installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire\n\n2013-2016 Seelisbergtunnel, Switzerland – Installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire\n\n2015-2017 Tunnel Mont Terri & Russelin, Switzerland – Installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire\n\n2014-2016 Metro Baku, Azerbaijan – Engineering, production & delivery of fan shut off dampers, smoke extraction and ventilation dampers\n\n2014-2016 Tunnel Biel-Längholz, Switzerland – Installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire\n\n2014-2015 Karawankentunnel, Austria – Installations in the tunnel ceiling for local exhausting in standard operation and case of fire – reinstallations and refurbishments\n\nFor more than 25 years, Strata Worldwide has dedicated its business to developing advanced safety solutions for mines all over the world.
