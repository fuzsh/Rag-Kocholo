        "text": "The construction industry plays a critical role in the Italian economy, employing over 3 million people and contributing over £110 billion to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Notwithstanding the obstacles presented by the epidemic, the industry has demonstrated resilience and growth. Indeed, the construction company in Italy is currently placed sixth globally, and data from recent years indicates that the sector is expanding once more.\n\nU.S. exporters are very interested in Italy, which has the 12th largest global construction market outside of the United States. Although they may not always meet Italian requirements for aesthetic design—which is crucial even for materials and components that end users do not often see—U.S. building products are known for their quality and dependability in Italy. Because the construction company in Italy views itself as a global leader on par with the US industry, it is open to considering novel or innovative goods and solutions.\n\nEnd users, the public sector, and Italian businesses are becoming more and more interested in sustainability. Products with high “green” performance characteristics have opportunities in areas like improving indoor air quality and saving energy and water. The LEED guidelines of the Green Building Council, which have their roots in the United States, are becoming increasingly popular in Italy and are being considered by many architects when designing new, energy-efficient buildings. The goal of the European Green Deal is to increase the energy efficiency of both public and private buildings. Another factor driving the demand for more energy-efficient buildings is the rise in the number of Italian businesses applying ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards.\n\nConstruction Company in Italy Segmentation by Sectors\n\nCommercial construction, industrial construction, infrastructure construction, energy and utilities construction, institutional construction, and residential building are the main segments of the Italian construction market.\n\nCommercial Construction: This industry’s project types include office buildings, retail stores, outdoor recreation centers, leisure and hospitality structures, and other commercial developments. Throughout the projection period, investment in retail, office, data center, and leisure and hospitality facilities will propel the expansion of the commercial sector.\n\nIndustrial Construction: This field includes waste processing facilities, manufacturing facilities, chemical and pharmaceutical plants, and facilities for the production and processing of metals and other materials. Growth in the sector will be driven by the development of automotive manufacturing projects starting in 2025.\n\nInfrastructure Construction: The project types in this sector include rail infrastructure, road infrastructure, and other infrastructure projects. The nation’s transportation infrastructure will be developed with funding from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). Throughout the projection period, this will help the sector’s growth.\n\nConstruction Related to Energy and Utilities: Project categories in this field include telecommunications, sewage and water infrastructure, oil and gas, and electricity and power. The expansion of the sector between 2024 and 2027 will be propelled by the government’s emphasis on the building of energy infrastructure, especially renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nInstitutional Construction: This industry encompasses research facilities, religious buildings, educational buildings, healthcare buildings, and institutional buildings. From 2025 to the end of the forecast period, investments in projects related to education, healthcare, museums, and research buildings will drive the expansion of the institutional construction sector.\n\nResidential Construction: This industry consists of both single-family and multi-family dwelling projects. Investments in housing developments by the public and private sectors will propel the sector’s expansion starting in 2026.\n\n7 Top Construction Company in Italy\n\nHere is a list of 7 top construction companies in Italy worth knowing about:\n\n1. Saipem\n\nThe industry leader in oil and gas construction is the Italian engineering and construction firm Saipem.
