        "text": "As MAPIC once again draws hordes of retail real estate professionals from all over the world to Cannes on 14-16 November, it does so for the 24th time. With over 8,600 participants expected this year – including 2,100 retailers and 1,000 investors – MAPIC is the undisputed leading retail leasing platform.\n\nAnd while the event is staying true to its roots by offering a packed conference programme featuring top retail experts, exhibition stands displaying the latest and greatest projects worldwide and unparalleled networking opportunities, MAPIC 2018 has been given somewhat of a facelift.\n\nIn a time where factors such as changes in demographics, technological advances and shifts in consumer behaviour have put retailers and landlords alike under great pressure, one could say that the retail industry has entered a new paradigm. This new paradigm is one where lines between online and physical are becoming increasingly blurred – the physical store is by no means dying, but its role is evolving – and where innovation is key as brick-and-mortar retailers are constantly having to reinvent themselves in order to stay relevant to an increasingly fleeting consumer. The theme of this year’s MAPIC has been chosen to reflect these changes in the industry, with the event being headlined ‘Transforming Reality: Physical in the Age of Digital’. A major topic of the conference will be the convergence of physical and digital – something we have seen numerous examples of in past years. Not only are physical retailers increasingly investing in their online channels – now considered equally important as having high street or shopping centre flagship locations – but traditionally online-exclusive brands are now moving into the physical space by opening bricks-and-mortar stores. Recent examples of this include UK-based fashion retailers Missguided as well as American brands such as Glossier and Everlane.\n\nSeveral panel sessions on this topic will run on Wednesday the 14th, including an opening keynote by Christophe Cuvillier, Group Chief Executive Officer of Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, who will speak about the importance of bricks-and-mortar, analyse the omnichannel model and give his views on changing consumer expectations. To reflect the ever-increasing importance of e-commerce – e-commerce now represents 8.8 per cent of total sales in Western Europe, 47.7 per cent in the Asian-Pacific region and close to hit 20 per cent in the UK market – this year’s MAPIC will feature a whole new set of speakers traditionally not present at these types of events. Alongside experts from traditional retail players such as Zara, Uniqlo, Nike and Burberry, will be heavyweight e-commerce players such as Amazon, Zalando, MADE.com and vente-privée entertainment, all keen to share their experiences and discuss future projects.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the main conference programme, we will be hosting three thematic summits, each one reflecting a specific movement in the industry: leisure, outlets and international-scale retail partnerships. A newcomer this year is the Leisure Summit, taking place the day before the main event (13th November). In the wake of e-commerce, shopping centres and other retail destinations are increasingly being transformed into places where customers come not just to shop, but to dine, socialise and experience new things, making leisure an intricate part of the retail offering. The summit will focus on various experiential concepts including location-based attractions, leisure pop-ups and wellness centres, and speakers include experts from companies such as EuropaCity and IMAX. Furthermore, the main event will feature a leisure exhibition zone and several ‘Leisure Talks’ throughout the two days. Back for a second consecutive year is the Outlet Summit and it is more relevant than ever, with recent figures showing that the outlet market has grown by six per cent per year over the last three years. The growth makes it one of the most dynamic segments of the commercial property market, but outlets are increasingly transforming into something more than just sales channels – while offering price-sensitive customers great deals, they can also be tourist attractions and lifestyle destinations. Topics at the summit include the interconnection between outlets and brand strategy and ways to improve the outlet shopping experience for the consumer.\n\nThe Global Retail Partner Summit also returns for a second edition, highlighting the increasingly important strategy of working with well established local partners across different target markets. This invite-only matchmaking event has been designed to allow participants to make the most of an afternoon of intense networking, for example by allowing attendees to book meetings in advance based on geography. Finally, joining the usual line-up of country pavilions – including France, Italy, the Nordics, Turkey and India – is the UK, which will have its own dedicated area for the first time. The pavilion aims to bring together the best in breed of each region and comes with a dedicated programme. The UK pavilion have partnered with leading retail property industry advocate Revo, as well as The Completely Group, operators behind some of the UK’s largest retail deal-making events. We are convinced that this 24th edition of MAPIC will be a highlight for this rapidly changing industry – and are looking forward to welcoming all the delegates to Cannes.\n\nRetailoring The Industry\n\nMAPIC is the leading international retail real estate event for key property players to build the ultimate retail and leisure mix in order to become a complete lifestyle destination. The 24th edition of the event will this year take place on the 14-16 November at its usual home of Palais des Festivals in Cannes.\n\nMAPIC is the leading international retail real estate event for key property players to build the ultimate retail and leisure mix in order to become a complete lifestyle destination.
