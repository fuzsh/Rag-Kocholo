        "text": "Associated Press\n\nMILAN (AP) — Barely two years before the start of the 2026 Winter Olympics, the local organizing committee signed a contract on Friday to rebuild a century-old bobsled track in Cortina d’Ampezzo, putting \"a full stop” on a saga that has Italy’s Finance Minister starting to regret backing the bid.\n\nThe contract is with Parma-based construction company Impresa Pizzarotti & C., which has offered to rebuild the Cortina track for 81.6 million euros ($88 million). It has said work will start on Feb 19.\n\nThe committee for the Milan-Cortina Games announced on Tuesday its decision to move forward with plans amid a standoff with the International Olympic Committee, which wants an existing foreign venue in neighboring Austria or Switzerland used instead to cut costs. But the Italian government does not want to finance a foreign venue.\n\n“The choice puts a full stop on it and attests to the extreme determination of this government to finish all the woks for the Games in the best way and in Italy,” a statement read.\n\n“Transport Minister Matteo Salvini and Sports Minister Andrea Abodi confirm that with great satisfaction.”\n\nNext Tuesday will mark exactly two years before the opening ceremony in Milan, but the Cortina track has to be ready before then. There is less than a year before IOC-mandated test events, and the Milan-Cortina committee is aware that “under no circumstances” can the new track be certified after March 2025.\n\nNo sliding track has been built recently in such a short timeframe and organizers are continuing negotiations for an eventual Plan B — likely in a neighboring country — that would require added budget.\n\nThere is the risk that if it is not ready in time the committee will have to spend more, while still paying to rebuild the Cortina track that would not be used for the Olympics.\n\n“The Olympics don’t come every two years, they’re coming in 2026 and then they won’t come again, and I’m beginning to regret backing it, because I feel the responsibility,” Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said.\n\nGiorgetti was speaking at a meeting in Sondrio, in the Valtellina valley that is also home to Bormio where the men’s skiing is slated to take place.\n\nHe added that an electronic sign should be placed “at the entrance to Valtellina that shows how many days are left to make us understand the necessary urgency.”\n\n___\n\nAP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"
