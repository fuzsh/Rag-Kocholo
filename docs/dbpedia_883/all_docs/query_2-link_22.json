        "text": "We go on discovering Parma Fans club outside Italian borders by reading Dejan description of Parma Club Crociati Balkan, born from historical Facebook group PARMA BOYS BALKAN.\n\n“Our story began in 2009 when some guys from ex Yugoslavia met on social network. Next year the page PARMA BOYS BALKAN was born.\n\nDon’t get shocked with this part: my brother was Asprilla and “Parma” fan, we both were. He died in car accident on New Year’s Eve 1995 and I burried him in white jersey with blue Parmalat logo on it. 20 years later I decided to visit Tardini for the first time, in honor of him. I came in the same shirt to see defeat from Sampdoria. It was the beginning of the Parma’s hardest time, but I felt in love with the club and the city anyway.\n\nI started to search for other gialloblu fans on Facebook then. Surprise was that I discovered PARMA BOYS BALKAN and their admin Hrvoje who lived 100 meters from me! He is the most passionate and dedicated fan I know. He ran the fan page completely alone and he can give any information from the past of Parma Calcio. After that we started to cooperate and to go to Parma together, we made a banner, polo shirts and we’ve been present with our group on almost every important day: farewell with Serie A on home match against Hellas Verona, winning Serie D against Delta Rovigo, Derby with Reggiana, Lega Pro Final in Florence, four games in Serie B and return in Serie A (Udinese) this summer. We can be proud of journey to Pordenone (Lega Pro) when there was 12 of us and this season against Juventus with the record of 14 Croatians, Slovenians and Bosnians connected with P.B.B. in Tardini.\n\nOur mission is to bring on Parma stadium tifosi from every part of Slav’s countries in Balkans. It is not easy, dealing with money, will and sometimes lack of confidence, but thanks to Parma Fans Worldwide we approached CCPC and this made us first official Parma Club from Balkans, that gave us new energy. We decided to cut the word “Boys” not to be confused with ultras and became Parma Club Crociati Balkan.\n\nWe are closer than the other foreign fans, but it is hard to drive 1.000 km in one day and go to the job directly sometimes… However, we can’t stop doing this.”\n\nPARMA BOYS BALKAN Facebook group: www.facebook.com/BoysParmaBalkan\n\nThe most of you already know we are quite boring talking about our mission of creating a Parma fans worldwide network. We won’t talk to much now but just post some pictures from last weekend when we had the pleasure to share our passion together with fans from all over Europe in the Parma vs Lazio week-end.\n\nFirst of all thanks to all of you, guys (and girls), for making such a long journey and for giving us authorization in publishing this photos. And thanks to Centro Coordinamento and the people in Parma that are always so kind with us. The network will endure until your passion is alive.\n\nIn two days we joined Greek, Macedonian, Croatian, Polish, Scottish, Austrian, Lithuanian fans and had a wonderful time together. Meeting some player, yes, but most of all staying together and realizing that maybe we are few in our birth places but that in Parma there is also a family for us all.\n\nParma Club Greece made a big article on their experience that you can traslate with google. Here is the link. They – and Lukasz from Parma Club Poland – were also nominated on Gazzetta di Parma by journalist Matteo Scipioni in his weekly report on Parma match from Curva Nord.\n\nThanks for the picture to: Parma Club Greece, fcparma.com.pl, Dejan of Parma Boys Balkan (Parma Club Crociati Balkan), Doug (SoloParma) and Nikica.\n\nWe are supporters, not journalists. Our mission is to bring Parma Calcio and Parma closer to abroad fans and, hopefully, vice versa, but we think all you outside Italy would like to know more about what happened yesterday: the Nuovo Inizio back at the helm of Parma Calcio.\n\nNuovo Inizio – a 7 parmesan businessmen group composed by Guido Barilla, Giampaolo Dallara, Capital B in the person of Mauro Del Rio, Marco Ferrari, Erreà in the person of Angelo Gandolfi, Giacomo Malmesi and Impresa Pizzarotti in the person of Pietro Pizzarotti – refounded together with Parma Partecipazioni Calcistiche, Parma Calcio 1913 after the failure. Nuovo Inizio had the intent to save Parma football team, restart football passion in Parma and entrust it in the hands of a reliable football specialized businessman that was found in Chinese Jihang Lizhang and Link International. Almost one year and an half ago they sold majority quote to the Chinese group, keeping the 30% (10% still in the hand of PPC, as you already know) and the promise of being the guarantee for Parma town and fans that they would intervene incase of need.\n\nThis happened yesterday. After Link International agreement non-fulfillment, due probably to Chinese government restriction on football investments, Nuovo Inizio exercised their rights and retook 60% of Parma Calcio. In their official statement and press conference they underlined intention of a capital increase and to keep being a guarantee for the Club future and, maybe future transfer to some real trustable investor, if there will be ever condition to. Parma Partecipazioni Calcistiche will still have his role of citizenship representative and will keep having a member inside the board.\n\nJust a quick overlook on who composes Nuovo Inizio. We will talk about them on WikiParma soon. A huge thank you to Facebook page Parma-Reggiana #maistatastoria, for conceding us to use their pictures.\n\nGuido Barilla: Italian businessman and the chairman and CEO of Barilla Group, the world’s largest pasta company, which is 85% owned by Guido, his brothers Paolo and Luca, and a sister.

(from ParmaLive)\n\nAngelo Gandolfi: founder and president of Erreà, sport equipment company supplier.\n\nGiacomo Malmesi: lawyer and former Parma Calcio vice-president.\n\nPietro Pizzarotti: member of the Mipien board, the holding owner of 94,5 % of Impresa Pizzarotti & C. S.p.A., the construction company founded by his family more than 100 years ago. (from Pizzarotti.it)\n\nWe are not used to suggest merchandise but we think that someone could be interested in this. Nostalgia Cases – UK company specialized in nostalgic jersey phone cases – realized this one inspired to most iconic Parma Jersey, due to our summer poll the Parma Calcio best kit ever.\n\nNostalgia team offer a 10% discount for our followers with the code PARMAFANSWORLDWIDE that is not limited to Parma Calcio cases.\n\nTheir cases are available in 100 different phone models (iPhone, Samsung, Huawei, Sony…) and they ship worldwide (free shipping in UK).\n\nYou can also request any Parma kit you like and they’ll produce it for you at the same price as the cases listed on their site.

He is supposed to buy a flight, reserve a hotel, rent a car without being sure that he could watch a football match together with his/her club mates. And, if he will arrive, for example, the day before the match in Orio al Serio airport – one of the few italian airport with dozens of cheap flights destinations – he is supposed to move outside the Bergamo province, look for a listicket box office, and buy the ticket hoping that who is in front of him/her will understand some English.\n\nWe are miles away from giving back football to fans. Damn.\n\nIf some of you is in the awful situation we just described write us an will do our best to provide you the ticket you need. Or at least to suggest you an english speaking listicket box office. This is a joke.\n\nWrite us. The fans network will help you."
