        "text": "In the entire last year, an income of about 800 million euros is expected from tourism, as well as 1,75 million tourists, 15 percent more than in 2014, announced the Minister of Sustainable Development and Tourism, Branimir Gvozdenović.\n\nHe said that the Ministry expects over 11 million overnight stays.\n\n\"I appreciate that it is important to emphasize that this growth trend was not focused exclusively on the season, but continued in the postseason. In October alone, there was an increase in the number of tourists of 7,14 percent, or 16,15 percent when it comes to overnight stays. So, some of the main characteristics of the period behind us were both the increase in traffic and the extended season,\" said Gvozdenović in an interview with the Mina-business agency.\n\nHe said that the focus was not exclusively on the coast and the sun and sea concept, so from the beginning of last year until November, the National Parks recorded an increase in the number of visitors by as much as 30 percent.\n\n\"These figures are an indication of exceptional efforts to promote and improve the offer. Therefore, I must also mention that last year we received a great recognition from Lonely Planet, when Kotor was on the first place in the list of ten cities that should be visited during this year\", announced Gvozdenović.\n\nIn previous years, Washington, Paris, San Francisco, London and New York received this award.\n\nGvozdenović said that better connections with, among other things, Western and Central Europe and Scandinavia will continue to be among the Ministry's priorities.\n\n\"Ryanair continues to fly to Brussels and London, and the announced arrival of EasyJet with flights to Manchester and London this year is also of great importance. Discussions are underway with several interested airlines from the Middle East, including Fly Dubai, with the same goal , and their final results will be known in the upcoming period,\" stated Gvozdenović.\n\nHe reminded that the visa regime has been significantly improved, while the infrastructural development of the airport is a special subject of attention.\n\n\"I have already announced that, according to the analyzes of the World Travel and Tourism Council, it is expected that tourist arrivals in the Mediterranean will grow by around ten million new arrivals per year until 2030, so we have an opportunity that should be used wisely, leading the development of Montenegro as a tourist destination towards high quality accommodation and service, diversified offers and good connections\", Gvozdenović assessed.\n\nCommenting on the expectations for this year's winter tourist season, Gvozdenović said that significant efforts have been made to ensure that as many ski centers as possible are in operation.\n\n\"This year, tourists will have at their disposal Savin kuk and Javorovača in Žabljak, Kolašin 1450 in Kolašin, Vučje in Nikšić, Turjak in Rozaje. In addition to the ski resort, there are also baby lifts at Ivani Koriti, near Šavnik, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Žabljak,\" said Gvozdenović.\n\nHe said that the winter tourist season is often mistakenly identified with two S's - Snow, Skiing.\n\n\"One of our strategic goals is precisely that the complementary facilities provide caterers and hoteliers with as much independence as possible from weather conditions, but also be a quality addition to the offer even when there is snow,\" explained Gvozdenović.\n\nOne of the good examples, he said, is the Vučje Ski Center with its Snow Dance festival event.\n\n\"This is precisely why we will concentrate on the development of the incentive program for the construction of complementary contents in the following action. At the same time, as the tourist offer must be richer with numerous manifestations and events in progress, but also out of season, it is planned that significant funds will be allocated to support manifestations, above all in the period before and after the main tourist season\", Gvozdenović announced.\n\nHe said that as part of the extension of the season, a novelty for schools and caterers is the organization of ski schools during February and March in Žabljak, Kolašin, Vučje and Ivanovi Koriti, and, as he announced, there will be increased inspection supervision during the season.\n\n\"An important element of support is the encouragement of financial institutions to define favorable credit funds for tourism companies, which would enable tourism operators to define the offer at reduced prices,\" believes Gvozdenović.\n\nWhen it comes to accommodation facilities in the north, he added that one of the possible models and courses of action is that the facilities that are currently not in operation are given to the management of hotel companies, which have the ability to organize the operation of these facilities.\n\n\"Finally, the already mentioned planned development of tourist zones in the northern region can represent a serious chance for a more dynamic development of this part of Montenegro. Prerequisites for the formation of tourist zones are amendments to the Law on Tourism, as well as the provision of adequate support from the budget of Montenegro,\" said Gvozdenović.\n\nHe reminded that last year the construction works started on the construction of facilities within the Luštica Bay tourist resort.\n\n»\"Uštica Development is in negotiations with several hotel operators and it is planned that the construction of the first hotel within the complex will begin in the first months of this year. We are in intensive communication with the investor with the aim of speeding up the construction of the golf course\", announced Gvozdenović.\n\nHe added that last year, the first building permit was issued for the construction of the Portonovi settlement in Kumbor, and the renowned Italian company Impresa Pizzarotti was chosen as the main contractor.\n\n\"It is expected that work on the construction of the One and Only hotel complex will begin soon, and work on the construction of the marina has also begun. It is worth reminding that this will be the first One and Only hotel in Europe, which is of great importance for further promotion of our tourist product and attracting renowned investors\", assessed Gvozdenović.\n\nAccording to Gvozdenović, the Porto Montenegro project, with the luxurious Regent Hotel, which in the last year and a half alone has won 17 international awards and hosted almost ten thousand tourists, already has its own life on the domestic and international tourist scene.\n\n\"According to the data of the Adriatic Marinas company, the total investments so far are estimated at close to 420 million euros, and the total number of employees last year, including seasonal workers, is close to 1,4 thousand. And this project shows that Montenegro is leading a good policy, which relies on a favorable business environment and the top quality of our country's tourist offer\", stated Gvozdenović.\n\nHe reminded that the Ministry has also launched a number of projects aimed at the successful valorization of the space included in the spatial plan for Bjelasica and Komov, and the development of two ski resorts, Kolašin 1600 and Cmiljača in Bijelo Polje, has been designated as a priority.\n\nGvozdenović added that funds have been allocated for their development.\n\nAlso, as he said, the Government has allocated funds for the development of existing and new ski resorts in the capital budget, with an emphasis on Žarska, Savin Kuk and Hajla.\n\n\"Aware of the need to further increase efforts to valorize the north, we are working on developing special tourist zones in which the infrastructure necessary for the development of tourist content will be provided through the incentive policy,\" said Gvozdenović.\n\nThe implementation of the above, as well as the highway construction project, as he assessed, are an important prerequisite for ensuring the feasibility of projects in that part of the country.\n\n\"It is quite expected that, in a large number of investment contracts, there are those whose realization, due to internal or external circumstances, is not realized according to the planned dynamics. Our role here is to speed up the processes if it is possible, or to end them if it is not, in a way that, to the maximum possible extent, will reduce the negative effects\", announced Gvozdenović.\n\nHe added that some of the biggest investments in tourism are being realized with the planned dynamics.\n\n\"Public invitations for a number of tourism projects are also underway, and I appreciate that we can really be satisfied with what has been achieved. At the same time, of course, we have to keep in mind that development and competitiveness strengthen or weaken, depending on whether all relevant parties make a full contribution to these processes,\" said Gvozdenvić.\n\nWhen it comes to the activities of the Ministry in the tourism sector this year, Gvozdenović said that the supervision and control of privatization contracts is one of the important segments of generating quality in that area.\n\n\"With the aim of further improving the infrastructure and quality preparation of the seasons, we are planning to prepare a model proposal for the formation of the joint-stock company \"Skijališta\" of Montenegro\", said Gvozdenović.\n\nAs part of activities to improve air accessibility, he said that the arrival of the British company EasyJet has already been announced.\n\n\"Based on the communications with several interested airlines and tour operators, during this year we can expect the introduction of new airline routes to the markets of central, western and northern Europe, as well as Israel and the countries of the Middle East\", stated Gvozdenović.\n\nHe said that a great deal of work is expected this year to further improve the business environment through amendments to relevant laws in the field of tourism, hospitality, and building construction.\n\n\"What I would single out is the expectation of the adoption of a new law on spatial planning and construction of buildings. I am convinced that with it we will create an excellent basis for further improvement of the business environment, but what we have emphasized with these changes is the visual arrangement and integration of buildings into the space.\" , Gvozdenović believes.\n\nHe added that absolute transparency of the planning, design and construction process is foreseen, given that all planning documents, urban-technical conditions and permits, as well as reports on the revision of planning documents, will be public.\n\n\"For us, an important issue that will be treated by this law and that requires significant improvement is access to facilities in public use by persons with reduced mobility and with disabilities,\" said Gvozdenović.\n\nHe explained that the aforementioned amendments to the law foresee the introduction of an electronic system in the process of planning and construction of buildings, which would enable monitoring of the entire process, as well as reducing the time of issuing permits by half compared to the previous deadline.\n\n\"Of course, work on the adoption of planning documentation is a prerequisite for high-quality valorization of space, and we will also treat this issue seriously and dedicatedly,\" added Gvozdenović.\n\nHe said that this year it is planned to continue the implementation of numerous projects in the environment and climate change.\n\n\"This year, we expect the completion and commissioning of a significant number of projects related to the construction of sewage networks, waste water treatment plants and sewage sludge treatment,\" announced Gvozdenović.\n\nHe also said that the protection of the Ulcinj Saltworks, as a particularly valuable ecosystem on a European scale, is expected through the achievement of formal protection at the international level as a Ramsar area, the adoption of the Protection Study and the Spatial-Urban Plan for the Municipality of Ulcinj."
