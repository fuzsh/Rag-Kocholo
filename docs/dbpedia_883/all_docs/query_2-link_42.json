        "text": "Railway tunnel through the Swiss Alps\n\nThe Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT; German: Gotthard-Basistunnel, Italian: Galleria di base del San Gottardo, Romansh: Tunnel da basa dal Sogn Gottard) is a railway tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland. It opened in June 2016 and full service began the following December.[9][10] With a route length of 57.09 km (35.5 mi),[5] it is the world's longest railway and deepest traffic tunnel[11][12][13][note 1] and the first flat, low-level route through the Alps.[14] It lies at the heart of the Gotthard axis and constitutes the third tunnel connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.\n\nThe GBT consists of a large complex with, at its core, two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld (Uri) with Bodio (Ticino) and passing below Sedrun (Grisons). It is part of the New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA) project, which also includes the Ceneri Base Tunnel further south (opened on 3 September 2020) and the Lötschberg Base Tunnel on the other main north–south axis. It is referred to as a \"base tunnel\" since it bypasses most of the existing vertex line, the Gotthard railway line, a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the Saint-Gotthard Massif, which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT. The new base tunnel establishes a direct route usable by high-speed rail and heavy freight trains.[15]\n\nThe main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier, especially for freight on the Rotterdam–Basel–Genoa corridor, and more specifically to shift freight volumes from trucks to freight trains. This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks, and reduces the environmental damage caused by heavy trucks. The tunnel also provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland, as well as between northern and southern Europe, cutting the Basel/Zürich–Lugano–Milan journey time for passenger trains by one hour (and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes).[16]\n\nAfter 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum, the first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996. Construction began in November 1999 at Amsteg.[17] Drilling operations were completed in March 2011. The final cost is projected as CHF 9.560 billion.[18]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gotthard Base Tunnel, with a length of 57.09 km (35.5 mi) and a total of 151.84 km (94.3 mi) of tunnels, shafts and passages, is the longest railway tunnel in the world,[note 2] with a geodetic distance of 55.782 km (34.7 mi) between the two portals.[5][12] It is also the first flat route through the Alps or any other major mountain range, with a maximum elevation of 549 m (1,801 ft) above sea level,[5] corresponding to that of Bern. It is the deepest railway tunnel in the world, with a maximum depth of 2,450 m (8,040 ft),[5] comparable to that of the deepest mines on Earth. Without ventilation, the temperature inside the mountain reaches 46 °C (115 °F).[5]\n\nLike the two other tunnels passing below the Gotthard, the Gotthard Base Tunnel connects two Alpine valleys across the Saint-Gotthard Massif: the Urner Reusstal in the canton of Uri, in which flows the river Reuss, and the Valle Leventina, the largest valley in the canton of Ticino, in which the river Ticino flows. Unlike most other tunnels, the Gotthard Base Tunnel passes under several distinct mountain massifs, two of them being major subranges of the Alps, the Glarus Alps and the Saint-Gotthard Massif, with the valley of the Anterior Rhine, the Surselva in the canton of Graubünden, between them. The tunnel passes under these two ranges more than 2,000 m (6,562 ft) below the Chrüzlistock (2,709 m or 8,888 ft) and the Piz Vatgira (2,983 m or 9,787 ft, near the Lukmanier Pass). While the cantons of Uri and Ticino are part of the German- and Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland respectively, the Surselva is mainly Romansh-speaking.\n\nThe Alps strongly influence the European climate – and that of Switzerland in particular – and there can be substantially different weather conditions at each end of the GBT, described by the Ticinese architect Mario Botta: \"The light changes at the Gotthard: that of the Mediterranean Sea is not the same as that of the continent, that of the central lands, that of Europe far away from the sea.\"[19] On average, the temperature is about 3 °C (5 °F) higher on the south side than the north side, but on some days, temperature differences are well over 10 °C (18 °F).[note 3]\n\nThe north portal lies in the north of the municipality of Erstfeld at an elevation of 460 m (1,510 ft), east of the Reuss. There, the tunnel penetrates the western slopes of the Bälmeten and Chli Windgällen (although only marginally) before passing below the valley of the Chärstelenbach, a creek in the Maderanertal. From there, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of Etzli, below the Witenalpstock. The main crest of the Glarus Alps, which is the watershed between the Reuss and the Anterior Rhine, is crossed below the Chrüzlistock, the crest having an elevation of about 2,700 m (8,900 ft) at this point. From the crest and border, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of the river Strem (Val Strem) before passing below Sedrun and the Anterior Rhine. From the bottom of the valley, the tunnel proceeds towards the valley of the Rein da Nalps (Val Nalps) and passes east of Lai da Nalps, before crossing the Gannaretsch range below the western summit of Piz Vatgira (2,981 m (9,780 ft)). This is the deepest point of the tunnel, with a rock layer of 2,450 m (8,040 ft) above it. The tunnel then passes below the valley of the Rein da Medel (Val Medel) and west of Lai da Sontga Maria. After a few kilometres the tunnel crosses the watershed between the Anterior Rhine and the Ticino, just north of Pizzo dell'Uomo (2,525 m (8,284 ft)). This point corresponds to the main chain of the Alps, and is the main drainage divide between the Rhine and the Po. For a few kilometres, the tunnel passes below two western tributaries of the Brenno in the Valle Santa Maria before crossing the last range, west of the Passo Predèlp (about 2,500 m (8,200 ft)) and east of Faido. It then follows the eastern slopes of the large Valle Leventina, the valley of the Ticino, for about 18 km (11 mi) to the south portal at Bodio, at an elevation of 312 m (1,024 ft), just 3 km (1.9 mi) before Biasca, where the Brenno converges with the Ticino.[note 4]\n\nThe closest railway stations to the portals are Altdorf and Biasca. The first regularly served railway stations on the base line (as of 2016/17) are those of Arth-Goldau (Schwyz), a railway node with links to Lucerne and Zürich, and Bellinzona (the \"Gate of Ticino\"), with links to Locarno, Luino and Lugano (via the Monte Ceneri Rail Tunnel). The journey from Arth-Goldau to Bellinzona takes not more than an hour. The station of Altdorf is planned to be served by 2021. There also have been talks of using that of Biasca. The travel between Altdorf and Biasca would last less than 25 minutes.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Gotthard Pass and Gotthard Railway\n\nSince the 13th century, the 2,106 m-high (6,909 ft) Gotthard Pass has been an important trade route from northern to southern Europe. Control of its access routes led to the birth of the Swiss Confederacy. The Gotthard Pass is located halfway between Lake Lucerne and Lake Maggiore. It is the shortest link between the navigable Rhine and the Po. Before modern transport, the traverse of the pass took days, and snow makes it a challenge in winter.[20]\n\nQuite late, compared to other current top-importance routes through the Alps (e.g. Simplon, San Bernardino, Brenner, Mont Cenis), namely in 1830, the first Saint-Gotthard Pass road was established after centuries-long usage of a bridle path. From 1842 onwards, a daily course by the Gotthard Post, a stagecoach drawn by five horses with ten seats, still took about 23 hours from Como to Flüelen. It would last until 1921.\n\nHistoric routes on the Gotthard\n\nIn 1882, with the inauguration of the Gotthard Railway Tunnel, the travel time between Altdorf and Biasca was reduced dramatically to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in large Fin de siècle-hotels, for example in Biasca. In those days, it was still an adventure and it was only affordable to the rich. Electrification of the railway line in 1922 significantly reduced travel time again. Refilling water boilers of steam locomotives was no longer necessary. There were also the technical advantages of electrical engines and future technical improvements.\n\nFrom 1924, car transport on trains through the railway tunnel began. The road between Göschenen and Airolo over the summit of the pass, comporting notably the Schöllenen ravine and the Tremola, had countless hairpin turns and serpentine curves, dropping 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in altitude. It posed a huge challenge for automobiles of those days. From 1953 onwards, the pass road was sequentially improved and expanded at several sections along the Gotthard route, finally ending in 1977 with the opening of an expressway fully circumventing the Tremola. In winter, however, due to the snow, cars could only cross the Gotthard on the train.\n\nTransit time was further dramatically reduced with the opening of the Gotthard Road Tunnel and the finalization of the northern part of A2 motorway through the Urner Reusstal (in close proximity to the railway), with many additional tunnels (then leading from Basel to the Gotthard Road Tunnel), in 1980. With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the Valle Leventina, the main valley leading from Airolo down to Bellinzona, and the surmounting of the Monte Ceneri between Bellinzona and Lugano in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in Basel to the southern border in Chiasso, or the shortest motorway route from North-German Hamburg as far as South-Italian Sicily, bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line.[21] Passenger speed was also increased on the railway line with the use of tilting trains, notably the ICN, although maximum speed remaining far lower than on a modern straight high-speed line. Both modern motorway and historic railway rely on heavy rockfall and avalanche protection equipments and are exposed to harsh weather condition in winter.\n\nAfter the opening of the auto tunnel, in 1980, traffic increased more than tenfold. The existing tunnel was at its capacity by 2013.[22] A second tunnel will be built next to the first, following a national referendum.[23][24] Construction started in 2021 and is scheduled to finish in 2027.\n\nAs early as 1947, engineer Eduard Gruner imagined a two-story base tunnel from Amsteg to Biasca, both rail and road, with a stop at Sedrun, to provide a faster and flatter passage through the Swiss Alps. Similarly to Gruner's idea, the GBT cuts through the Gotthard Massif some 600 m (2,000 ft) below the older tunnel. On the historic track only the Gotthard Railway trains up to 1,300 t (2.9×10^6 lb)[25] when using two locomotives or up to 1,500 t (3.3×10^6 lb) with an additional bank engine at the end of the train are able to pass through the narrow mountain valleys and through spiral tunnels climbing up to the portals of the old tunnel at a height of 1,151 m (3,776 ft) above sea level. Since the GBT is in full service, standard freight trains of up to 3,600 t (7.9×10^6 lb) are able to pass this natural barrier.\n\nBecause of ever-increasing international truck traffic, Swiss voters chose a shift in transportation policy in September 1992 by accepting the NRLA proposal. A second law, the Alpine Protection Act of February 1994,[26] requires a shift of as much tonnage as possible from truck transport to train transport.\n\nThe goal of both the laws is to transport trucks, trailers and freight containers through Switzerland, from Basel to Chiasso, and beyond by rail to relieve the overused roads, and that of the Gotthard in particular, by using intermodal freight transport and rolling highways (where the entire truck is transported). The GBT substantially contributes to the requirements of both laws and enables a direct flat route from the ports of the North Sea (notably Rotterdam) to those of the Mediterranean Sea (notably Genoa), via the Rhine corridor.\n\nAlthough the technical maximum speed is 250 km/h (155 mph) through the GBT, the maximal authorized speed has been reduced to 230 km/h (145 mph) for ecological and economical reasons, while the operating speed of passenger trains is restricted to 200 km/h (125 mph) in order to accommodate the freight traffic, with the possibility to accelerate up to 230 km/h (145 mph) in case of delay.[6][7][8] At opening the GBT reduced travel times for trans-Alpine train journeys by about 40 minutes, and by one hour when the adjacent Zimmerberg and Ceneri Base Tunnels were completed. This is viewed as a revolution, especially in the isolated region of Ticino, which is separated from the rest of the country by the Alps and the Gotthard. The two stations of Bellinzona and Lugano (respectively named \"Gate of Ticino\" and \"Terrace of Ticino\") were entirely renovated for the opening of the GBT, among other improvements.[citation needed]\n\nAs of 2016, the Gotthard Base Tunnel is the longest railway tunnel in the world. It is the third Swiss tunnel to bear this title, after the Gotthard Tunnel (15 km or 9.3 mi, 1882) and the Simplon Tunnel (19.8 km or 12.3 mi, 1905).[27] It is the third tunnel built under the Gotthard, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.\n\nConstruction\n\n[edit]\n\n2004–2011 tunnel excavation[28][29] Year Month Total excavated (kilometres) (miles) Of planned (%) 2004 July 52.34 32.52 34.1 2005 June 74.59 46.35 48.6 2006 June 94.10 58.47 61.3 2007 June 103.67 64.42 67.6 2008 March 108.02 67.12 70.4 April 109.00 67.73 71.0 July 113.20 70.34 73.8 August 115.20 71.58 75.1 October 118.40 73.57 77.2 2009 January 124.00 77.05 81.6 March 127.30 79.10 83.9 May 131.00 81.40 86.3 June 133.00 82.64 87.6 July 134.80 83.76 87.9 August 136.60 84.88 90.0 September 137.30 85.31 90.4 October 138.60 86.12 91.3 November 140.00 86.99 92.2 December 141.38 87.85 93.0 2010 January 141.82 88.12 93.4 February 142.48 88.53 93.8 March 143.80 89.35 94.7 April 144.80 89.97 95.4 May 145.40 90.35 95.8 June 146.10 90.78 96.2 July 146.60 91.09 96.6 August 147.33 91.55 97.0 September 147.98 91.95 97.5 October 149.10 92.65 98.2 November 149.90 93.14 98.7 December 150.40 93.45 99.0 2011 January 150.49 93.51 99.1 February 150.77 93.68 99.3 March 151.26 93.99 99.6 April 151.70 94.26 99.91 May 151.75 94.29 99.94 June 151.82 94.34 99.99 July 151.82 94.34 100[30]\n\nAlpTransit Gotthard AG was responsible for construction. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS).\n\nTo cut construction time in half, four access tunnels were built so that construction could start at four different sites simultaneously: Erstfeld, Amsteg, Sedrun, and Faido. A fifth at Bodio was added later. The two tunnels are joined approximately every 325 m (1,066 ft) by connecting galleries. Trains can move between the tunnels in the two multifunction stations at Sedrun and Faido. These stations house ventilation equipment and technical infrastructure and serve as emergency stops and evacuation routes.[15]\n\nAccess to the Sedrun station site is by a level access tunnel 1 km (0.6 mi) long from the valley floor near Sedrun. At the end of the access tunnel, two vertical shafts lead 800 m (2,625 ft) down to the base tunnel level. A proposal to construct a functioning railway station, called Porta Alpina (from Romansh, \"Alpine Gate\"), at this site was evaluated, but the project was put on hold in 2007 and definitively cancelled by the federal authorities in 2012 as uneconomical.[31]\n\nThe final breakthrough in the east tube occurred on 15 October 2010 at 14:17 +02:00.[32] The final breakthrough in the west tube occurred on 23 March 2011 at 12:20.[33][34]\n\nOn 30 August 2013, the tunnel was entirely traversed for the first time from Bodio to Erstfeld in six hours, by diesel train, buses and by foot.[35]\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the operational test phase started on a 13-kilometre (8.1 mi) stretch in the southern section of the west tube between Faido and Bodio. Its purpose was to test the infrastructure and any ancillary systems.[36]\n\nOn 31 October 2014, the railway track installation was completed. A gold sleeper on the very last part of the track was installed during the event to mark this milestone of progress.[37][38]\n\nOn 1 October 2015, following permission by the Federal Office of Transport, the first tests on the entire length of the GBT were performed, with steadily increasing speed. On 8 November, a train reached the top speed of 275 km/h (171 mph).[39]\n\nAllocation of work\n\n[edit]\n\nThe contracts were awarded in sections:\n\nErstfeld (the 7.7 km (4.8 mi) section from Erstfeld to Amsteg), with two tunnel boring machines (TBM) boring the two tubes. The break-through of the east tube between Erstfeld and Amsteg took place on 15 June 2009. The portal area was surface-mined.\n\nAmsteg (the 11.3 km (7.0 mi) section from Amsteg to north of Sedrun), ARGE AGN (Strabag and Züblin Murer) received the contract for work in this sector.[40] On 9 December 2009, the Amsteg section was officially delivered to the owner for fitting-out,[41] with civil engineering, construction, concrete and lining work completed in early 2010.[42]\n\nSedrun (the 8.6 km (5.3 mi) East tube and 8.7 km (5.4 mi) West tube in the section immediately north and south of Sedrun), along with work performed by Transco (Bilfinger SE, Implenia, Frutiger and Impresa Pizzarotti).[43][44] The final breakthrough in the west tube occurred in March 2011.[45] The northbound tubes from Amsteg to the Sedrun multifunction station (north) were handed over to the railway systems contractor Transtec Gotthard on 15 September 2011, the date specified in the construction schedule.[46]\n\nFaido (13.4 km (8.3 mi) East tube and 13.6 km (8.5 mi) West tube in the section from south of Sedrun to Faido), with Consorzio TAT (Alpine Mayreder Bau, CSC Impresa costruzioni, Hochtief and Implenia and Impregilo).[47]\n\nBodio (15.9 km (9.9 mi) East tube and 15.6 km (9.7 mi) West tube in the section from Faido to Bodio), with work performed by Consorzio TAT (Alpine Mayreder Bau, CSC Impresa costruzioni, Hochtief, Implenia and Impregilo).[47] Civil engineering construction, concrete and lining works were completed in early 2010.[42]\n\nDeaths during construction\n\n[edit]\n\nNine workers died during construction; one in the Amsteg section, two in the Sedrun section, and three each in the southernmost Faido and Bodio sections.[48]\n\nDate Nationality Details 8 June 2000 German Hit by a boring bar that fell 700 m (2,300 ft).[49] 12 March 2002 South African Buried by excavation material.[50] 3 April 2003 German Hit by a rock.[51] 11 September 2003 Austrian Crushed by a toppling cable drum.[52][53] 21 January 2005 Italian (1)\n\nItalian (1) Hit in a mine train collision.[54][55] 23 November 2006 German Crushed by a mine train.[56] 24 June 2010 German Catapulted from an inspection train.[57] 16 July 2012 Italian Fell from a scaffold.[58]\n\nInauguration and commissioning\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, several events, including festivities and special exhibitions, were held around the Gotthard, culminating in the inaugurations in early June, dubbed Gottardo 2016. Public institutions joined the celebrations: Swiss Post issued a special stamp commemorating the Gotthard Base Tunnel,[59][60] and Swissmint issued gold and silver coins dedicated to the opening.\n\nOn 31 May 2016, a day before the inauguration, the nine people who died during construction were commemorated in a ceremony at the north portal in Erstfeld that was led by a Catholic vicar general, a vicar of the Evangelical-Reformed Church of Uri, a Jewish rabbi, and a Muslim imam. A bronze memorial plaque with their names — four coming from Germany, three from Italy, and one from each of South Africa and Austria – was unveiled by AlpTransit Gotthard AG CEO Renzo Simoni.[48] A Catholic shrine to Saint Barbara, the patron of miners, stands inside the tunnel as a memorial.[61]\n\nThe tunnel was officially inaugurated on 1 June 2016.[61] At the northern entrance in Erstfeld, President of the Confederation Johann Schneider-Ammann spoke of a \"giant step for Switzerland but equally for our neighbours and the rest of the continent\", while a live relay carried a speech given by Transport Minister Doris Leuthard at the southern entrance in Bodio. The first journey carried hundreds of Swiss citizens who had won tickets in a draw, while the assembled guests in Erstfeld, including the Federal Council in corpore, heads of state and government from neighbouring countries and transport ministers from European countries, attended the opening show Sacre del Gottardo by Volker Hesse featuring 600 dancers, acrobats, singers and musicians celebrating Alpine culture and myths around the Gotthard.[61] On the following weekend, popular festivities and special exhibitions, attended by more than 100,000 visitors, were held.\n\nFrom 2 August to 27 November 2016, the Swiss Federal Railways ran a special train service through the tunnel called \"Gottardino\" which was open to the public. It was a once-daily service from Flüelen railway station to Biasca railway station and in reverse. The trains made a stop inside the tunnel, to allow passengers to visit an exhibition inside the underground multifunction station in Sedrun which would normally be used in emergency only.[62]\n\nRegular services\n\n[edit]\n\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nDuring 2016, the GBT was tested extensively[63][64] before its integration into the regular schedule on 11 December.[65] On 5 December, the Swiss Federal Railways were granted permission from the Federal Transport Office to use the new base line. While the base tunnel is used for InterCity trains (ICN) and EuroCity trains (EC), the vertex line remains in use for regional trains.[63] Since 2019, the Gotthard axis is served by the Stadler EC250 (Giruno) high-speed train and future flagship of the SBB fleet.\n\nFrom the Amsteg portal, guided tours are organised inside the Gotthard Base Tunnel complex. A window allows visitors to watch the trains running in the tunnel.\n\n2023 derailment and closure\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 10 August 2023, a freight train derailed while traveling through the tunnel, causing extensive damage to the tunnel infrastructure.[66] The incident occurred near the multi-functional station of Faido, in the canton of Ticino. No one was injured, and no hazardous materials were released. The derailment caused significant damage to the tunnel, prompting its closure to both passenger and freight traffic. The incident led to the derailment of around 30 wagons, and the train damaged the concrete sleepers for approximately 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) before coming to a stop.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the tunnel operates with a single tube, giving priority to freight trains. Most passenger trains are rerouted through the mountain route and the old Gotthard Tunnel.[67] The complete reopening of the base tunnel is expected on 2 September 2024.[68]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe realization of the GBT, as the centrepiece of the NRLA, is also a prototypical example of direct democracy in Switzerland. In order to accomplish this mega-project the political institutions also had to overcome many parliamentary sessions and several major popular votes, including the following:[69]\n\n27 September 1992, NRLA proposal (mandatory referendum): The final proposal by the Federal Council was accepted by 63.6% yes votes (declined by 1+2/2 cantons, turnout 45.9%)[70][71]\n\n20 February 1994, Alps Initiative (federal popular initiative): Initiated by a few private people with the goal to protect the Alpine environment from the negative impact of traffic was accepted[72] by 51.9% yes votes (declined by 7 cantons, turnout 41%).[73][74] The initiative was accepted despite the recommendation by the Federal Council from 12 February 1992 to decline the initiative without any counterproposal,[74][75] and despite the parliamentary recommendation (both chambers) from 18 June 1993 to decline the initiative.[74][76]\n\n29 November 1998, Public Transport Funding (mandatory referendum): A total budget of CHF 30 billion for several public transport projects was accepted by 63.5% yes votes (declined by 1+3/2 cantons, turnout 38.3%); \"the NRLA is to receive CHF 13.6 billion\"[77][78]\n\n21 May 2000, Bilateral EU Agreements / 40-tonne Trucks / Heavy Traffic Fee (optional referendum): As part of a whole package of several bilateral agreements with the EU the Swiss also accepted by 67.2% yes votes (declined by 2 cantons, turnout 48.3%) the shift of an upper limit for trucks from 28 tonnes (62 thousand pounds) to 40 tonnes (88 thousand pounds), but at the same time the EU agreed to a new heavy-traffic fee, which would also be used to finance the NRLA[79][80]\n\n17 December 2003, Ceneri Base Tunnel (parliamentary session): The controversial funding of the Ceneri Base Tunnel was finally passed by parliamentary approval only; the possibility for an optional referendum was not raised by any political groups, nor by the public. The then-in-charge transport minister, Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger, was quoted as saying \"This is the only way to make the railway [the Gotthard axis] a flat line between Basel and Chiasso.\"[81]\n\nFigures\n\n[edit]\n\nDiameter of each of the single-track tubes: 8.83–9.58 m (29.0–31.4 ft)[5]\n\nDistance between cross passage tubes: ca. 325 m (1,066 ft)[5]\n\nNumbers of cross passage tubes: 178[5][7]\n\nMaximum rock overlay: 2,450 m (8,040 ft) (at Piz Vatgira)[5]\n\nStart of construction: 1993 (sounding drills), 1996 (preparations), 4 November 1999 (official start, first blasting), 2003 (mechanical excavation)\n\nBreakthrough: 15 October 2010 (Eastern tube), 23 March 2011 (Western tube)[5]\n\nCommissioning: May 2016\n\nInauguration/opening: 1 June 2016\n\nStart of daily passenger service: 11 December 2016 (see public transport timetable#Switzerland)[82]\n\nTotal cost: CHF 9.560 billion[18] (as of December 2015 )\n\nTravel time: Passenger trains – 20 minutes[7]\n\nAmount of excavated rock: 28,200,000 t (31,100,000 short tons; 27,800,000 long tons),[5][83] 13,300,000 m3 or 17,400,000 cu yd, the equivalent of 5 Giza pyramids\n\nNumber of tunnel boring machines (TBM): Four Herrenknecht Gripper TBMs. Machine numbers S-210 and S-211 operated northbound from Bodio to Faido and Sedrun and were nicknamed Sissi and Heidi respectively; Machines S-229 and S-230 operated southbound from Erstfeld to Sedrun and were known as Gabi I and Gabi II.\n\nTotal length: 440 m (1,440 ft) (including back-up equipment)\n\nTotal weight: 3,000 t (3,300 short tons; 3,000 long tons)\n\nPower: 5 MW\n\nMax. excavation daily: 25–30 m (82–98 ft) (in excellent rock conditions)\n\nTotal excavation length by TBM: about 45 km (28 mi) (for each tube)\n\nManufacturer: Herrenknecht, Schwanau, Germany\n\nIntegration of the portals into the landscape\n\nThe new 4-kilometre-long (2.5 mi) open-air section from Rynächt to the north portal\n\nStart of the new 7-kilometre-long (4.3 mi) open-air section from Giustizia to the south portal\n\nThe Pollegio Control Centre (near the south portal) with one of the four used TBM cutter heads on display\n\nOperation\n\n[edit]\n\nReduced travel times\n\n[edit]\n\nReduced travel times by passenger trains Shortest journey time by train Time saved vertex route through GBT 2006 2016 2022 Milano – Zürich 4:26 (EC) / 3:41 (CIS)[84] 4:03 (EC)[85] 3:17 (EC)[86] 1:09 / :24 / :46 Lugano – Zürich 2:56 (EC/IC) / 2:42 (CIS)[84] 2:41 (ICN)[85] 1:53 (IC2/IC21)[86] 1:03 / :49 / :48\n\nSafety\n\n[edit]\n\nThe safety requirements on the rolling stock are similar to those of other long Swiss tunnels, including the ability for the emergency brake to be overridden.\n\nIncidents\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 10 August 2023, a freight train heading north derailed inside the tunnel causing it to be shut. Trains scheduled to use the tunnel were either cancelled or redirected via the \"panorama route\" which added around one to two hours to journeys, and reduced passenger capacity by around two thirds. According to an SBB press conference, around 8km of tracks, 20,000 concrete sleepers and a lane change gate in the tunnel were severely damaged. The gate is needed to separate the two tunnel tubes which is why the second tunnel could not initially be used to run trains.[87][88] When the incident first happened, authorities stated the tunnel would be shut for at least 6 days but later announced that passenger trains would not be able to use the tunnel for several months. Freight trains have been allowed to use the east tunnel from 23 August due to a temporary maintenance gate replacing the damaged one.[89][87]\n\nExperts from the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB) were dispatched to the site to preserve and document evidence of the crash. Investigators found fragments of a wheel and signs of derailment several kilometers before the crash site. At the Faido station, they discovered a pile of derailed wagons. The STSB's mission is to determine the causes of accidents to ensure or improve safety, rather than to assign guilt or responsibility.[90] The STSB believes that the derailment was likely caused by a broken wheel tread inside the tunnel. All fragments of the wheel were found, consisting of several large pieces.[90] The cause of the breakage has not yet been determined. External influence or fatigue fracture are possible explanations. The wheel fragments will be subjected to metallurgical analysis to determine the cause. Despite the broken wheel, the wagon was dragged by the train for several kilometers. At the switching point of the multi-functional station, where trains can switch between the two tubes of the tunnel, the wagon derailed, pulling more than 20 following wagons off the tracks.[90]\n\nRepair work on the tunnel is expected to be extensive. Initially projected to last until the end of 2023, in November 2023 it was announced that the extensive repairs would not be complete before September 2024, and the tunnel will operate in reduced capacity until at least that date.[91] This is due to repairs requiring a complete replacement of seven kilometers of railways, including 20,000 sleeper blocks and their concrete foundations, a damaged lane-change gate, two high-speed switches and many other safety and operationally relevant parts.[92] Repairs are expected to cost between 100 and 130 million Swiss Francs. In the meantime, trains have been rerouted over the panorama route. Since the alternate route is unable to accommodate bi-level equipment, passenger capacity has been reduced by around two thirds. The undamaged east tube of the tunnel is set to resume freight traffic from 23 August 2023, while passenger trains will remain rerouted.[93] As of 16 August, the Swiss Federal Railways are evaluating, in conjunction with the Federal Office of Transport, the possibility of operating some passenger trains on a single track in the east tube, similar to the planned freight traffic. In case of emergency, passengers would be evacuated through the other tunnel tube. However, this option is still under consideration.[94] It is expected that on 10 December, coinciding with the yearly timetable changes, freight capacity within the tunnel will be increased for freight vehicles during the week, and for passenger vehicles during weekends.[95]\n\nTraffic\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the opening date on 1 June 2016, between 130 and 160 trains on an average working day operated through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, which in March 2019 marked the 100,000th transit. Around two-thirds of the passages were freight trains and the remaining quota were passenger trains, both national and international.[96]\n\nProjections\n\n[edit]\n\nThe number of projected trains per day was 180–260 freight trains and 50 (65 from 2020) passenger trains.[7]\n\nPassengers\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the opening of the tunnel there was an increase in passengers crossing the trans-alpine line, with 2.3 million passengers in the first 8 months, an increase of 30% over the previous year.[97]\n\nIn August 2017, an average of 10,400 people crossed the tunnel daily. Train services from Italy to Switzerland through the line are expected to become faster from 2020,[needs update] with the opening of the Ceneri Base Tunnel, with an expected further increase in passenger numbers.[98] There are plans for a train service between Zürich and Milan with a journey time of 2:45 hours, down from 3:50 hours.[97]\n\nFreight\n\n[edit]\n\n67,000 tonnes (150 million pounds) on 120 trains passed through the tunnel each day during the first half year of operation.[99]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBrenner Base Tunnel – Railway under construction through the Alps\n\nMont d'Ambin Base Tunnel, a planned base tunnel that will be slightly longer than the GBT.\n\nRail transport in Switzerland\n\nHigh-speed rail in Switzerland\n\nList of tunnels in Switzerland\n\nList of tunnels in the Alps\n\nList of tunnels by country\n\nList of transport megaprojects\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website\n\nGotthard Tunnel Experience, Uri Tourism\n\nGottardo 2016, official inauguration website\n\nSRF Gotthard – Die Eröffnung, official coverage and background information by SRF Swiss Radio and Television (in German)\n\nRTS Gothard – L'inauguration du tunnel, official coverage and background information by RTS Radio Télévision Suisse (in French)\n\nAlptransit Gotthard AG official website[permanent dead link]\n\nGotthard Base Tunnel at Structurae\n\nAGN Erstfeld Amsteg Constructors Web Site (many photos and designs)\n\nFaido Bodio Constructors Web Site (many photos and designs)\n\nPublications by and about Gotthard Base Tunnel in the catalogue Helveticat of the Swiss National Library\n\nVideos\n\nAerial views of the works (by AlpTransit AG): 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015\n\nJourney through the GBT (SRF DOK)\n\nFlight over the GBT (SRF DOK)\n\n17 years of construction (NRLA)\n\nCorporate videos: AlpTransit Gotthard AG (main contractor), Herrenknecht (TBM), ABB (ventilation), Thales (railway signalling), Transtec Gotthard (railway technology)\n\nRoutes\n\nGotthard-Basistunnel (6283450)"
