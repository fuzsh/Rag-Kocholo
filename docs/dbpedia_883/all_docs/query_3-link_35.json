        "text": "Company offers to reconstruct century-old Cortina track for $89M US\n\nThe local organizing committee for the 2026 Winter Olympics decided Tuesday to move forward with rebuilding a century-old bobsled track in Cortina d'Ampezzo but will also keep open a \"Plan B\" in case the new venue is not ready by March 2025.\n\nThe committee said following a board meeting its plans hinge on signing a contract with Parma-based construction company Impresa Pizzarotti & C., which has offered to rebuild the Cortina track for 81.6 million euros ($89 million US).\n\nIf the contract for the sliding centre is signed \"it would confirm the original masterplan\" for the Olympics, the Milan-Cortina committee said, adding that the new venue \"would revive Cortina's long tradition in these sports and help future generations.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid a standoff with the International Olympic Committee, which wants an existing foreign venue in neighbouring Austria or Switzerland used instead to cut costs. But the Italian government does not want to finance a foreign venue.\n\n\"It is not acceptable for the bobsled races to take place outside Italy,\" Deputy Premier Antonio Tajani said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. \"We will do everything to achieve the goal.\"\n\nConstruction would start with less than two years to go before the Milan-Cortina Games, and less than a year before IOC-mandated test events.\n\nNo sliding track has been built recently in such a short timeframe and test events have taken on even greater importance following the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.\n\n\"Considering the negative views of the IOC and the international federations, which are concerned about the timeframe that the project would require, and considering advice from SIMICO [the company in charge of infrastructure for the games], the board has decided not to interrupt dialogue with other existing and functioning venues,\" the local organizing committee said.\n\nThe committee has also asked chairman Andrea Varnier \"to continue negotiations or an eventual Plan B that would require added budget.\"\n\nUnder no circumstances, the Milan-Cortina committee pointed out, can the new track be certified after March 2025."
