The selected projects challenge new approaches to design that are beyond the envelope of the everyday, while providing cities with key civic building that celebrate and harmonize architecture as a high art while finding answers to the complicated problems of environment, social context, improving quality of life, and sustainability.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE AWARDS 2007\n\nAnd the list of this year’s winning schemes is impressive drawn by some of the world’s most talented thinkers from large and small architectural practices around the world. The glossary of entries is a “Who’s Who” in international architecture today.\n\nFor the 2007 International Architecture Awards, the Museum received hundreds of submissions from design firms in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The submissions ranged from the latest new corporate high-tech headquarters to smaller planning projects, bridges, memorials, sacred spaces, and private residences. All submitted projects were designed by architects in their countries of origin or abroad for both built and unbuilt projects alike, as of January 1, 2003.\n\nThis year’s jury for awards took place in Moscow and was organized by the Union of Architects of Russia at the end of February and included some of the most important young and established Russian architectural practitioners employed today:\n\n• Yury Gnedowskiy, President, Union of Architects of Russia, People’s Architect of the\n\nRussian Federation and Chair of the Jury\n\n• Vladimir Yudintsev, Architect, Moscow\n\n• Georgiy Solopov, Architect, Moscow\n\n• Alexander Larin, Architect, Moscow\n\n• Andrey Kaftanov, Architect, Council Member, Union of International Architects (UIA)\n\n• Dimitriy Serebryakov, Architect, Moscow\n\n• Andrey Osokin, Architect, Moscow\n\n• Maria Kiernan, Architect, Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland\n\nThe International Architecture Awards is curated and organized by Christian K. Narkiewicz-Laine, President, The Chicago Athenaeum and assisted by Lary L. Sommers, Director of Administration/Marketing and Ioannis Karalias, Museum Vice President, The Chicago Athenaeum, and Kieran Conlon from the European Centre for Architecture, Art, Design, and Urban Studies.\n\nThe geographic range in this year’s Awards Program attests to the global significance of this program organized by The Chicago Athenaeum.\n\nOut of the fifty-seven (57) project selected for awards, Japan received the highest number of nine (9) awards with Germany and Italy at six (6) awards followed by the United Kingdom with five\n\nINTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE AWARDS 2006\n\n(5) awards and Spain with four (4) awards. The United States, Mexico, and Austria had three (3) awarded buildings with Switzerland, China, and Saudi Arabia for a total of two (2) awards. Ireland, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Australia, India, Denmark, South Korea, Egypt, South Africa, Singapore, Sweden, and Israel/Jordan each had one (1) awarded project. The total number of countries with awarded projects was twenty-four (24).\n\nThe Austrian firm of Coop Himmelb(b)lau won four (4) awards for projects in South Korea, Germany, Egypt, and Spain while Skidmore, Owings & Merrill won a total of five (5) awards for projects in Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Israel/Jordan, and the USA.\n\nOne of the boldest and largest projects awarded in 2007 is the new Madrid Barajas Airport by Richard Rogers Partnership in Madrid, Spain, which is a poetic marvel of form and function married to state-of-the-art technology. Staggering and expressive are the words for the Berlin Central Station by gmp-von Gerkan, Marg und Partner Architects in Berlin and for the high-art exposition facility, Nuovo Polo Fiera Milano, by Massimilano Fuksas Architect in Rho-Pero, Italy.\n\nTwo urban bridges of the highest caliber were awarded: the Sean O’Casey Bridge by Brian O’Halloran & Associates in Dublin and the Lugner Suspended Bridge in Glass by Architekturstudio Bulant & Wailzer in Vienna. Both bridges are brilliant aesthetic performances of engineering and far-reaching design skill. A new Danish prison was also awarded in East Jutland by Friis & Molke A/S, which might signal a new trend that tomorrow’s prisoners might be housed in awarded design and a far cry from the nightmarish days of gulags and Alcatrazes of the past.\n\nThe majority of awarded projects for 2007 displayed a dizzying, almost hypnotic sense of geometric contortions. The Space of Contemporary Artistic Creation by Coop Himmelb(l)au in Cordoba, Spain is indicative of the continuing trend to stretch the box into an enthralling geometric labyrinth. Also overpowering in form are the mesmerizing shells of the Wellness Center “Bergoase” by Studio arch. Mario Botta in Arosa, Switzerland. A hard-edge abstraction is the giant cube for ARB Bank Headquarters by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. The St. Andrew’s Beach House by Sean Godsell Architects in Victoria, Australia is total sculpture as a house. All of these awarded hard-edge geometric designs are destined to become icons of our time and place in architectural history.\n\nThe architecture of the memorial had a priority in this year’s awards with most of them commemorating the highest of human tragedies and disasters. The most austere are the Sachsenhausen Memorial\n\n“Station Z” by hg merz architekten museumgestalter in Oranienburg, Germany and the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Memorial by Mathew Ghosh Architects Pvt. Ltd. in Bhospal, India. The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Foundation symbolizes something entirely different memoralizing the life of a humanist in the most humane form. Bridging the Rift by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill on the Israel/Jordan border demonstrates that good architecture could and should be the instrument of world peace.\n\n“The Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design and Metropolitan Arts Press Ltd. have organized this annual Museum program, The International Architecture Awards, as a way in which to draw significant world\n\nattention to new buildings and urban planning projects being built and designed globally by the best and most prestigious international architecture offices and design firms,” states Christian K. Narkiewicz-Laine.\n\n“The wide geographic distribution of these awards attests to the importance of the program,” Mr. Narkiewicz-Laine adds. “There is no one, single architecture program in existence today that brings together the latest cutting-edge international architecture today as one cohesive universal representation or platform for world design. The Museum is honored to provide a focus that allows an exploration and analysis for current stylistic directions and philosophical thinking that is apparent in contemporary design today.”\n\n“The program has a unique educational mission and public profile with the intent of promoting and celebrating the latest, most cutting-edge international design to a national and international audience,” Mr. Narkiewicz-Laine continues.\n\nThe awarded projects for 2007 and other selected works will form an exhibition, “New World Architecture” to open as an exhibition in 2007. (Location to be announced.) Also shown will be the winning projects selected from the Museum’s annual “American Architecture Awards” for 2007, which recognizes the best new building design in the United States.\n\nAll Awarded Projects for 2007 can be seen on the Museum’s website at www.chi-athenaeum.org. The 2008 deadline for submissions for “The International Architecture Awards” is DECEMBER 1, 2007 for buildings designed and/or built between 2004-2007.\n\nInternational Architecture Awards : main page, current news\n\nINTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE AWARDS 2007\n\nCheck List\n\nSOKA-BAU COMPLEX\n\nWiesbaden , Germany\n\nArchitects: Herzog + Partner\n\nClient: SOKA-BAU\n\nSEAN O’CASEY BRIDGE\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\nArchitects: Brian O’Halloran & Associates\n\nClient: Dublin Docklands\n\nDevelopment Authority\n\nContractor: John Mowlem\n\nConstruction Ltd.\n\nSACHSENHAUSEN MEMORIAL “STATION Z”\n\nOranienburg, Germany\n\nArchitects: hg merz architekten\n\nmuseumsgestalter\n\nClient: Stiftung Brandenburgische Gedenkstätten\n\n“MOTENASHI” DOME\n\nKanazawa, Japan\n\nArchitects: Shirae Associates\n\nAssociate Architects: Nihon\n\nUniversity\n\nClient: Kanazawa City Office\n\nContractor: Sihmizu Corporation\n\nBERLIN CENTRAL STATION\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nArchitects: gmp-von Gerkan, Marg und Partner Architects\n\nClient: Deutsche Bahn AG\n\nNEW REGIONAL\n\nHEADQUARTERS SÜDWESTMETALL\n\nHeilbronn, Germany\n\nArchitects: Dominik Dreiner,\n\nArchitect\n\nClient: Südwestmetall\n\nTHEATRE STUDIO FOR\n\nUNIVERSITY\n\nBrno, Czech Republic\n\nArchitects: ARCHTEAM\n\nAssociate Architects: RADArchitekti\n\nClient: JAMU\n\nSIEEB SINO ITALIAN\n\nECOLOGICAL AND ENERGY\n\nEFFICIENT BUILDING\n\nBeijing, Peoples’ Republic of China\n\nArchitects: Mario Cucinella Architects\n\nClient: Italian Ministry for\n\nEnvironment and Territory (Italy) and Ministry for Science and Technology (Peoples’ Republic of China)\n\nAGC MONOZUKURI QUALITY\n\nMANUFACTURING TRAINING CENTRE\n\nKanagawa, Japan\n\nArchitects: Takenaka Corporation\n\nClient: Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.\n\nContractor: Takenaka Corporation\n\n222 RESIDENCE\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA\n\nArchitects: Elliott + Associates Architects\n\nClient: Withheld\n\nContractor: Lingo Construction\n\nRECTORIA DE LA UNVERSIDAD\n\nDE MONTERREY\n\nMonterrey, N.L., Mexico\n\nArchitects: Bernardo Hinojasa Rodriguez\n\nClient: Universidad de Monterrey\n\nHORIZON HOUSE\n\nAtami, Japan\n\nArchitects: Shinichi Ogawa & Associates\n\nAssociate Architects: Wada Structural\n\nEngineer Consultant\n\nClient: Withheld\n\nContractor: Daido Kogyo Co., Ltd.\n\nCHOKKURA PLAZA & SHELTER\n\nTochigi, Japan\n\nArchitects: Kengo Kuma & Associates\n\nClient: The City of Shioya-gun, Tochigi\n\nContractor: P.T.
