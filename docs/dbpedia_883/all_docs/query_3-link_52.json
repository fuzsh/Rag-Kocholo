According to a statement from the firm, work on the project has already begun and is due for completion in 2020.\n\nThe project was designed by architectural firm Foster + Partners and includes two towers, which will house the Dorchester Collection’s first five-star hotel in the region, as well as high-end, exclusive residences known as Private Residences by Dorchester Collection.\n\nMark Phoenix, managing director at Omniyat commented, “We always select the best partners that help us execute our vision. I have no doubt that this joint venture will yield immaculate results.”\n\nThe project includes high-end F&B retail outlets and will be surrounded by a mixed-use precinct. The total development package is said to be around $2bn.\n\n“Omniyat is known for creating bespoke developments of the highest quality, with relentless attention to detail when it comes to luxury finishes and appointments. We are also honoured to deliver this project for such an esteemed brand as Dorchester Collection,” said Graeme Robson, chief executive, Roberts Constructions.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Omniyat organised a black-tie event to celebrate its partnership with Dorchester Collection. The event showcased the first images of what the high-end project would look like once it was completed."
