The Tunnel forms <strong>the</strong> centrepiece of <strong>the</strong> Swiss government’s policy to switch transit freight from road to rail, but fur<strong>the</strong>r measures are needed if <strong>the</strong> target of reducing <strong>the</strong> number of lorries passing through <strong>the</strong> Swiss <strong>Alps</strong> is to be met. In <strong>the</strong> meantime, Swiss voters have opted to build a second Gotthard motorway tunnel … <strong>the</strong> story is far from over. Photo: AlpTransit Gotthard"
