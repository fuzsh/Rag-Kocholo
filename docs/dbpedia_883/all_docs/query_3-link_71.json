        "text": "Cities Identities in Arts and Architecture (CITAA) – 6th Edition 2022\n\nWhat gives a certain place its unique identity? What makes a city stand out and be incomparable to other cities? What allows different monuments and historical buildings, for instance, to deliver different messages and narrate different stories?\n\nArts and architecture are among the factors that shape the history of civilizations and allow ancient and modern cities to flourish. These factors do not stop only at buildings and constructions but also include traditions, cultural beliefs, and communal arts. By cherishing our traditions and civilizations that left behind various architectural miracles, we will pave the way for future generations to develop and preserve their identity.\n\nWith this in mind, various organizations have taken actions to preserve cities' identities by maintaining their architectural heritage. IEREK, a long-time advocate of architectural development, has organized the 6th international conference on \"Cities' Identity Through Architecture and Arts.\"\n\nThe conference will discuss various topics like the techniques used to preserve cities' architecture and arts and the effect of modernity on historical cities. Moreover, the impact of contemporary arts and architecture on the identity of cities will be studied.\n\nIEREK, through this conference, will help increase the awareness of architecture and arts enthusiasts of the importance of new techniques in preserving architectural identities. This conference will gather researchers from around the globe to exchange knowledge and experiences on protecting and sustaining cities' identities through architecture and to discuss urban development.\n\nFollowing the success of the previous editions of \"Cities' Identity Through Architecture and Arts,\" the 6th edition of the conference will be an opportunity to benefit from and exchange knowledge with experts in this field.\n\nSelected papers of the conference will be published in a book series entitled Advances in Science, Technology, & Innovation (ASTI) by Springer. Other papers will be published in the ARChive journal byIEREK Press.\n\nAll accepted submissions to the conference, after a rigorous double-blinded peer-review process by the respective and a highly-extinguished Editorial Board, will be published in one of the following:\n\nAdvances in Science, Technology and Innovation (ASTI), an IEREK Interdisciplinary book series published by Springer Nature. (Scopus indexed)\n\nAbout ASTI\n\nAdvances in Science, Technology & Innovation (ASTI) is a series of peer-reviewed books based on important emerging research that redefines the current disciplinary boundaries in science, technology and innovation (STI) in order to develop integrated concepts for sustainable development. It not only discusses the progress made towards securing more resources, allocating smarter solutions, and rebalancing the relationship between nature and people, but also provides in-depth insights from comprehensive research that addresses the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) as set out by the UN for 2030.\n\nThe series draws on the best research papers from various IEREK and other international conferences to promote the creation and development of viable solutions for a sustainable future and a positive societal transformation with the help of integrated and innovative science-based approaches. Including interdisciplinary contributions, it presents innovative approaches and highlights how they can best support both economic and sustainable development, through better use of data, more effective institutions, and global, local and individual action, for the welfare of all societies. The series particularly features conceptual and empirical contributions from various interrelated fields of science, technology and innovation, with an emphasis on digital transformation, that focus on providing practical solutions to ensure food, water and energy security to achieve the SDGs. It also presents new case studies offering concrete examples of how to resolve sustainable urbanization and environmental issues in different regions of the world. Read More.\n\nThe ASTI series is fully indexed in Scopus and any chapter/ paper published as part of this series will be seen on the Scopus database.
