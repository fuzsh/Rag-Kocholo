Salini Impregilo, which heads a joint-venture with Impresa Pizzarotti & C with a 51% stake, won the contract from Bane NOR, the state-owned company responsible for Norway’s railway infrastructure.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, set to be completed by 2022, Salini Impregilo and its joint-venture partner will design and build a double-track line, including two bridges, three tunnels totalling some 5km in length, and a station near the town of Skoppum.\n\nThe project is on the Vestfold Line, which is being modernised to reduce travel times and increase railway passenger capacity. Once completed, travel time between Oslo and Tønsberg will be about an hour, with a frequency of up to four trains an hour in either direction.\n\nThe contract is the latest effort by the Group to expand in countries that are investing in infrastructure and carry a lower risk profile, such as Australia and the United States."
