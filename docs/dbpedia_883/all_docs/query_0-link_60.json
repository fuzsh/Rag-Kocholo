After enjoying boom years from 2012 to 2014, the bubble burst, leaving international contractors scrambling. This stagnation has created a severe buyer’s market that has had negative, and in some cases final, consequences for firms.\n\nThe table below shows only rankings and firm name. For the complete data list see the following links.\n\nCompanies are ranked according to construction revenue generated outside of each company’s home country in 2018 in U.S. $ millions. Firms not ranked last year are designated **. Some markets may not add up to 100% due to omission of \"other\" miscellaneous market category and rounding. NA=Not available. †=Includes revenue of subsidiaries, the names of which now are available through www.ENR.com.\n\nENR’s 2019 Top 250 International Contractors"
