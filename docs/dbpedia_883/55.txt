The Italian contractor Impresa Pizzarotti has been awarded a contract by Dubai-based developer Elwan Group for the main construction package on its estimated AED450m ($122m) hotel resort in Al-Aqah, Fujairah.

The five-star hotel will have 288 rooms, large terraced pool, 1,320 square metres of conference facilities and six food and beverage outlets. The resort will also contain landscaped gardens and parking facilities for more than 300 cars.

Pizzarotti will start construction work in the second quarter of 2011, and the hotel is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2013.

Foundation work was completed previously, but Elwan decided to suspend work during the downturn of 2008 and 2009.

The hotel resort was designed by US-based Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum (HOK).

The developer is hoping to achieve Leed (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for the project by the US Green Building Council by using photovoltaic panels on the roof to increase energy efficiency. Elwan is also expected to use treated wastewater for irrigation and cooling to increase efficiency.The developer is the majority owner of Tanqia, a wastewater collection and treatment system in Fujairah.
