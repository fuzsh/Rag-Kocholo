(GRAND ISLAND, NE) - Enjoy an outdoor adventure with family or friends and experience Nebraska parks by joining The Great Park Pursuit (GPP) for a chance to win over a dozen prizes. Three sites are located in the tri-city area: the Outdoor Learning Area at the Nebraska State Fairgrounds/Fonner Park in Grand Island, Windmill State Recreation Area in Gibbon and Sandy Channel State Recreation Area in Elm Creek.

The goal of GPP, a partnership between the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the Nebraska Recreation and Park Association, is to promote active lifestyles while increasing awareness of the state's nature-rich outdoor recreation opportunities.

This is done by encouraging participants to visit up to 20 GPP sites located across Nebraska until September 18, 2015 and follow clues that will lead them to a GPP post, where they use a pencil to make an impression of the post to prove that they were there. Prizes and entry into drawings are based on the number of impressions collected. All participants will be entered into a drawing for an I-pad. The grand prize is an outdoor recreation package with a retail value of $1,500.

Other participating parks are: Sherman Reservoir in Loup City; Sandy Channel in Elm Creek; North Park in Holdrege; Ashfall Fossil Beds in Royal; Willow Creek in Pierce; Crystal Cove Park in South Sioux City; Benson Park in Omaha; Louisville State Rec Area in Louisville; Two Rivers in Venice; Prairie Queen Recreation Area in Papillion; Parade of Flags in Seward; Veterans Memorial Park in Beatrice; Chadron State Park in Chadron; Wildcat Hills State Recreation Area in Gering; Laing Lake Park in Alliance; Lake Ogallala; Sutherland Reservoir; Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park in North Platte.
