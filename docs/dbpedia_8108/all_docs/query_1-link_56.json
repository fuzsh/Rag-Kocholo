        "text": "A productive work day can really go south when your stomach starts growling to let you know that the salad you had for lunch wasn’t enough to keep you full until dinner. You need a snack…stat. But instead of reaching for whatever snack is in your fridge, you should really try to pack protein into your mini meal to actually satisfy those grumblings.\n\n“Having protein in your snacks helps keep steady blood sugar levels during the day and keeps you full longer,” Emily Van Eck, RDN, an Austin-based dietitian nutritionist, tells SELF. “Pairing protein with complex carbohydrates (like whole wheat crackers or fruit) or healthy fats (like avocado or nuts) can further enhance protein's benefits, keeping you satisfied, full, and energized longer.” The best part? “You should feel energized right away, or as soon as the food hits your bloodstream,” Van Eck says. “Then, in the hour or two after your snack, you should notice the sustained energy increase and feel full.”\n\nEating a snack in the afternoon can actually help you avoid that dreaded mid-day slump. “Instead, you’ll feel comfortably full and fueled until your next meal,” Leah Gorham, RDN, a registered dietitian and the co-founder of Love & Grits Nutrition Therapy, tells SELF. It’s also a good idea to keep a protein-filled snack in your gym bag on busy days. “If you have worked out and are not planning to eat a meal within an hour or so of finishing, grabbing a snack with a good source of protein will help with muscle building and recovery,” Estee Glikman, RDN, a registered dietitian and the co-founder of Love & Grits Nutrition Therapy, tells SELF. “Having enough protein is so important for muscle recovery and growth, along with rest and hydration, of course!”\n\nYou don’t need to stress about the exact amount of protein in your snack, but about 7 to 15 g is great to strive for, Gorham says. Hitting that goal might seem tricky, but if you stock your cabinets or work bag ahead of time with tasty, energizing options, you’re more likely to reach for them.\n\nLucky for you, we’re big snackers here at SELF, so we leaned on our Pantry Awards and advice from registered dieticians to come up with a list of the best protein snacks.\n\nIn this article\n\nShop the best bars\n\nShop the best nuts\n\nShop the best meat and fish\n\nShop the best beans\n\nShop the best cheese\n\nShop the best yogurt\n\nShop the best drinks\n\nBars\n\nThink! Protein Bars\n\nCourtesy of think!\n\nThink!\n\nProtein Bars (10-Pack)\n\nPros: Lots of flavors, easy to pack, no added sugar\n\nCons: Some Amazon reviewers think they’re a little dry\n\nSome protein bars taste great at first, but quickly earn a spot in your trashcan a few bites in. These 2024 Pantry Award–winning bars don't have that notorious chalky texture or chemical aftertaste. They’re made with a blend of pea, whey, and milk proteins, plus they offer 2 grams (you want about 28 grams per day) of fiber. “There's compelling research that says having sufficient fiber from a variety of plant sources can help keep [your blood sugars, cholesterol, and blood pressure] low,” Maya Feller, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in Brooklyn, tells SELF.\n\nProtein per serving: 20 g\n\nBarebells Protein Bars\n\nPros: Great texture, no added sugar\n\nCons: They can melt in warm temperatures\n\nIf I stick with the same protein bar for more than a few weeks, I’m probably going to get the ick—still, I always come back to these Barebells ones. They’re mild-tasting and not overly chewy, but the best part is that a bunch of flavors are coated in crispy rice or nuts (Salty Peanut and Creamy Crisp are my favorites) for a satisfying crunch. While most are made with a mix of milk and whey protein, some plant-based versions use soy and pea proteins instead. Each bar keeps sugar low (just 1 gram) and has about 3 grams of fiber as an added plus.\n\nProtein per serving: 20 g\n\nGoMacro MacroBars\n\nPros: Easy for on-the-go, tons of flavors\n\nCons: Includes added sugar\n\nMacroBars aren’t far off from the granola bars you had as a kid, but they’re beefed up with plenty of protein. They come in a variety of flavors, including oatmeal chocolate chip, maple sea salt, and banana and almond butter. “It’s always easy to have a bar in your bag when you’re on the go, and with 11 to 12 g of protein per bar, these fit the bill,” Glikman says. All of the flavors have actual pieces of fruit, seeds, or nuts to make the texture more appealing and add nutrients like fiber and potassium, a mineral that helps your body stay hydrated and stabilize blood pressure.\n\nProtein per serving: 12 g\n\nPromix Protein Puff Bars\n\nPros: Great texture, good for post-workout\n\nCons: Difficult to find in stores\n\nFinding a protein bar with a good texture is half the battle, and this one is reminiscent of a Rice Crispy Treat, according to one SELF editor. “It’s a perfect mix of chewy and crispy, so it's super satisfying, and doesn't have the vibe of a standard protein or cereal bar. These bars, especially the Snickernoodle flavor, hit the spot when I'm craving something sweet, and it’s just 3 grams of added sugar,” she says.\n\nThe bar gets its protein from whey isolate, which has all nine essential amino acids your body needs to synthesize protein—a process that’s important for building and maintaining muscle mass, as SELF previously reported. That makes this a great snack to slip into your gym bag for after a workout.\n\nProtein per serving: 15\n\nFrooze Balls Plant-Powered Energy Balls\n\nFrooze\n\nBalls Plant-Powered Energy Balls (16-Pack)\n\nPros: Great sweet treat, easy for on-the-go, no added sugar\n\nCons: Can be a little dry, according to Amazon reviewers\n\nThese bite-sized energy balls are a great source of plant-based protein and healthy fats, both of which come from peanut butter, peanuts, almonds, cashews, and hazelnuts. “I love a snack that's fun to eat and these really satisfy that for me,” one 2023 Pantry Award tester wrote. “These are a perfect snack in between meals if you want a bite of something sweet, or a great after-dinner healthy dessert,” another tester added.\n\nProtein per serving: 7.5 g (per pack)\n\nNuts\n\nMatiz Valencia Almonds Herbed\n\nCourtesy of Matiz Espana\n\nMatiz\n\nValencia Almonds Herbed\n\nPros: Lots of sweet and savory flavors, good source of fiber\n\nCons: Some flavors are messy\n\n“Nuts are a great high-protein snack, as they are also fiber- and nutrient-rich,” Gorham says. “They contain vitamins E and B, as well as minerals like magnesium, zinc, calcium, and potassium. These vitamins and minerals are directly involved in fluid balance, heart health, and nervous system and immune system support.”\n\nIf you tend to crave a snack after dinner, we recommend picking up these seasoned almonds, which come in both savory and sweet flavors. “These were, by far, the best thing I tried [during the Pantry Awards]. I got a ton of flavors and really liked them all, but my favorites were corn nuts (who knew I like corn nuts?! not me!!!), the rosemary almonds, and the candied valencia almonds,” one tester wrote.\n\nProtein per serving: 8 g\n\nSahale Snacks Honey Almonds Glazed Mix\n\nSahale Snacks\n\nHoney Almonds Glazed Mix (6-Pack)\n\nPros: Good source of fiber and healthy fats, great for dessert\n\nCons: Pricey\n\nHave a mega sweet tooth? Try this nutty mix. Dry-roasted brown and blanched almonds are coated in honey and topped with sesame seeds, dried cranberries, and sea salt. “They’re delicious and one four-ounce individual bag packs 7 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber, along with healthy fat, making it a solid snack,” Glikman says.\n\nProtein per serving: 7 g\n\nMeat and fish\n\nVermont Smoke & Cure Uncured Turkey Pepperoni Sticks\n\nVermont\n\nSmoke & Cure Uncured Turkey Pepperoni Sticks (24-Pack)\n\nPros: Easy to eat on-the-go, great texture\n\nCons: Higher in sodium and cholesterol, zero fiber\n\nMeat sticks are the ultimate portable snack—and because they’re animal-based, they’re an example of a complete protein source, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids we referenced earlier. “This specific brand and flavor makes a convenient snack a truly enjoyable one, too. It's savory but not too salty, and has a really satisfying snap when you bite into it (it isn't tough or too chewy, which is such a common problem with jerky-type snacks),” one SELF editor says. Her tip: “Gradually unwrap them while you eat, so you can keep your hands from smelling all meaty.”\n\nThe ingredient list is super simple, starring vegetarian-fed turkey and a few seasonings, like sea salt, paprika, and garlic powder. Worth noting: A single stick is relatively high in sodium (390 mg) and cholesterol (25 mg) for a small snack. That’s fine every once in a while, but eating too much salt regularly can raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. Eating foods high in cholesterol can also raise your blood cholesterol levels—and when those are elevated, it can lead to high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, or peripheral artery disease.\n\nProtein per serving: 9 g\n\nBrooklyn Biltong Original Air Dried Beef\n\nBrooklyn Biltong\n\nOriginal Air Dried Beef\n\nPros: Tasty flavor, great texture, easy to eat\n\nCons: Higher in sodium and cholesterol, lacking fiber\n\nIf snacking on jerky sounds more appealing than chomping on a stick, this one nails the texture and taste. “It is so, so tender and light—kind of the antithesis of standard jerky—and it doesn't leave my lips feeling pruned up from too much salt,” one SELF editor says. “The flavors are nice and subtle, though I prefer the naked/original varieties.”\n\nThis jerky is an easy way to eat straight-up protein with very little fat or carbohydrates, if that’s what you’re aiming for. That said, “pairing protein with complex carbohydrates, like whole wheat crackers or fruit, or with healthy fats, like avocado or nuts, can further enhance protein’s benefits and keep you satisfied, full, and energized longer,” Van Eck says. Like the meat stick, this snack is also higher in sodium (380 mg) and cholesterol (40 mg).\n\nProtein per serving: 16 g\n\nBumble Bee Lemon & Pepper Seasoned Tuna\n\nBumble Bee\n\nLemon & Pepper Seasoned Tuna (12-Pack)\n\nPros: Comes in several flavors, can be made into a meal\n\nCons: Not great for eating on-the-go\n\nOh, you didn’t know tuna is cool now? “I think tuna is highly underrated!” one SELF editor says, setting the record straight. “The Lemon Pepper packets are my favorite because I can eat them plain on crackers or use them to make better tuna salad.” If citrus isn’t your vibe, you can choose from a bunch of other flavors, like Mediterranean herbs and spices, jalapeño, tomato and basil, spicy Thai chili, and more.\n\nFish is another complete protein source, so you know you’re getting the amino acids your body needs. Plus, this tuna is a great way to get vitamin B12 (which regulates your body’s blood and nerve cells) into your diet if you don’t eat meat often. It’s also high in selenium, a mineral that plays a role in your thyroid’s hormone metabolism and reproduction. Based on Van Eck’s advice about pairing proteins with complex carbs or healthy fats, we recommend serving it with some whole wheat crackers to load up your snack.\n\nProtein per serving: 17 g\n\nPescavore Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip\n\nCourtesy of Pescavore\n\nPescavore\n\nAhi Tuna Jerky Strip (10-Pack)\n\nPros: Easy to eat while out, mild but tasty flavors, not smelly\n\nCons: Higher in sodium, expensive to buy in bulk\n\nYou get the convenience of jerky and a boost of umami flavor in Pescavore’s 2024 Pantry Award–winning Ahi Tuna Strips. SELF staff tested these in the office, and we’re happy to share that they won’t stink up your desk area. “This was flavorful without going too hard with the seasonings,” one tester wrote. They come in three sweet and savory flavors: Caribbean Jerk, Island Teriyaki, and Smokey Poké.\n\nThis tuna jerky is a solid source (7 mcg) of vitamin D, a nutrient that plays several roles in your body, including calcium absorption, bone growth, and inflammation reduction. If you’re watching your salt intake, just note that this has 380 mg, which is relatively high for a snack.\n\nProtein per serving: 15 g\n\nFreshé Gourmet Canned Tuna Sicilian Caponata\n\nFreshé\n\nGourmet Canned Tuna Sicilian Caponata (10-Pack)\n\nPros: Comes in lots of flavors, easy to make into a meal\n\nCons: Expensive to buy in bulk, not easy to eat on-the-go\n\n“I love these bougie tunas from Freshé—you can eat it right out of the can or make great salad toppers with it,” one SELF editor says. Each can has a variety of ingredients besides fish—Sicilian Caponata includes butternut squash, fire-roasted vegetables, shaved almonds, and vibrant herbs to pack more flavor into one tiny tin. These add-ins also boast complex carbs (from the veggies) and healthy fats (from the almonds) to make your snack more well-rounded. And each tin gives you essential nutrients like 379 mg of potassium and 48 mg of calcium, both of which can contribute to your heart health, among other benefits.\n\nProtein per serving: 11 g\n\nBeans\n\nBiena Chickpea Snacks\n\nPros: Great crunchy texture, good source of fiber, can be easily added to meals\n\nCons: A little dry\n\nIf you’ve ever tried roasting chickpeas in the oven, you know that it can be hard to avoid over- or under-cooking them. But these from Biena have the perfect texture and are a delicious snack, whether you pack on the seasoning or leave them pretty plain. “They are very crunchy and equally tasty when I eat them by the handful or add them to salads or bowls,” one SELF editor says.\n\nBonus: “Chickpeas are a plant-based protein that are also high in fiber, making them a great choice for heart health,” Gorham says. These also offer a bit of calcium (20 mg) to support your bone health and iron (1.1 mg) to keep your body oxygenated and boost energy levels.\n\nProtein per serving: 6 g\n\nEnlightened Bada Bean Bada Boom Crunchy Broad Beans\n\nEnlightened\n\nBada Bean Bada Boom Crunchy Broad Beans (24-Pack)\n\nPros: Satisfying crunch, flavorful seasoning, good source of fiber\n\nCons: A little dry\n\nOn their own, broad beans (a.k.a. Fava beans) have a mild taste, but these are extra mouth-watering with flavors like buffalo wing, spicy wasabi, sweet onion and mustard, and zesty ranch. “I am obsessed with these because of how crunchy and flavorful they are. The sea salt version is my favorite, but the cinnamon ones are my go-to when I want something a little bit sweet,” one SELF editor says. They also have almost the same amounts of calcium and iron as the Biena Chickpeas do—a nice plus.\n\n“Any kind of bean-based snack is going to be pretty balanced because beans naturally contain protein, carbs, and fiber, which is awesome,” Van Eck says. “I would personally like to pair them with something more tart and hydrating, like fruit, since they're pretty dry on their own. Remember that satisfaction and enjoyment of food is also really good for you.”\n\nProtein per serving: 6 g\n\nThe Only Bean Crunchy Roasted Edamame Beans\n\nThe Only Bean\n\nCrunchy Roasted Edamame Beans (10-Pack)\n\nPros: Good source of fiber, no added sugar, very few ingredients\n\nCons: Some Amazon reviewers say they’re too salty\n\nThese edamame beans are perfect for tossing on a salad or eating by the handful. “I've tried other brands of crunchy edamame, but these are the only ones I've found that have the right amount of salt and a solid crunch,” one SELF editor says. “Plus, the single-serve bags are large enough to satiate me in the middle of the afternoon.”\n\nYou’ll get 4 grams of fiber in these for your heart health and blood pressure, along with a combo of calcium (46 mg), iron (1 mg), and potassium (183 mcg)—all minerals your body needs to function properly.\n\nProtein per serving: 11 g\n\nSaffron Road Bombay Spice Crunchy Chickpea\n\nCourtesy of Saffron Road\n\nSaffron Road\n\nBombay Spice Crunchy Chickpea (4-Pack)\n\nPros: Great source of fiber, comes in lots of flavors\n\nCons: Some Amazon reviewers say they’re too crunchy\n\nHere’s another take on crunchy chickpeas that, as one Pantry Award tester put it, is “perfect for when you’re at your desk working and you just need a fix.” Another tester adds: “I find myself reaching for them in the afternoon when I need a pick-me-up. They are filling, crispy, and seasoned to perfection.” They come in a bunch of flavors, including Bombay Spice, Buffalo, and Korean BBQ.\n\nWe appreciate that they’re packed with a great amount of fiber (about 5 mg), healthy fats, and minerals like calcium and iron. And the ingredient list keeps things simple, with just chickpeas, oil, and seasoning.\n\nProtein per serving: 6 g\n\nCheese\n\nSargento Natural String Cheese Snacks\n\nSargento\n\nNatural String Cheese Snacks\n\nPros: Easy to eat quickly, great texture and taste\n\nCons: Target reviewers say it’s difficult to get out of the wrapper\n\nString cheese is not just for elementary schoolers, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. “When I'm trying to get more protein into my diet, there are truly only so many cardboard-y, fake-tasting bars and shakes I can stomach,” one SELF editor says. “I've been snacking on mozzarella string cheese since I was a kiddo, so it never feels ‘diet-y,’ and a single one contains a hefty amount of protein for the amount. Wrap it in some deli turkey with hot sauce...yum!”\n\nDairy is also a great source of vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, Gorham says. “Vitamin D is important for bone health and needed for cells to function. Calcium and potassium are important minerals that are needed to promote bone and heart health.” To balance out your snack, Van Eck recommends pairing this cheese with some nuts, fruit, or pretzels.\n\nProtein per serving: 7 g\n\nMoon Cheese Cheddar Believe It\n\nMoon Cheese\n\nCheddar Believe It (3-Pack)\n\nPros: Fun texture, very cheesy flavor\n\nCons: Higher in sodium, higher in saturated fat, makes your hands greasy\n\n“Picture that astronaut ice cream you had as a kid, then make it cheese—now you have Moon Cheese,” one SELF editor says. “It comes in bite-size pieces that have a nice crispy-crunchy texture and extremely concentrated cheese flavor.” Fair warning: “They definitely make your hands greasy, so be prepared for that. In my opinion, it's worth it,” she adds. You can grab these in a few flavors, like cheddar, gouda, pepperjack, and garlic and parmesan.\n\nMoon Cheese is a fun way to get calcium (349 mg) into your diet. Note: This is another snack that’s on the high-end for sodium at 350 mg, and it’s also high in saturated fat, which you should consume in moderation (as with most foods) because it can impact your cholesterol levels.\n\nProtein per serving: 11 g\n\nSargento Balanced Breaks Cheese & Mini Triscuit Crackers\n\nSargento\n\nBalanced Breaks Cheese & Mini Triscuit Crackers (3-Pack)\n\nPros: Well-balanced snack, great flavor\n\nCons: Higher in saturated fat, needs to be refrigerated\n\nThis isn’t exactly an all-out charcuterie board, but it’s a whole lot more convenient. “This grown-up Lunchable is usually easy to find at airports, so I often grab one at the Hudson News before boarding my flight to make sure I have protein on-hand when I'm in the air,” one SELF editor says. Plus, “the individual serving, with whole grain crackers, is super convenient and easy for kids and adults alike,” Gorham adds.\n\nYou don’t have to do any work pairing your protein source (cheese, in this case) with a complex carb (mini Triscuits) because the work is already done for you. Plus, this duo gives you fiber (2 g), calcium (190 mg), and iron (0.8 mg). That said, it has 6 grams of saturated fat, which you may want to take into account—most experts recommend aiming for around 22 grams per day.\n\nProtein per serving: 8 g\n\nYogurt\n\nSiggi's Nonfat Vanilla Icelandic-Style Skyr Yogurt\n\nSiggi's\n\nNonfat Vanilla Icelandic-Style Skyr Yogurt\n\nPros: No artificial sweeteners, contains probiotics\n\nCons: Needs to be refrigerated\n\nYogurt is more than just a no-cooking-required breakfast option—it’s also an easy way to sneak protein into your snack, and you can doctor it up however you want. “The live active cultures found in this yogurt can support gut health,” Gorham says, referring to probiotics like Bifidobacterium that provide immune system support and slow the growth of bad microbes in your gut, as SELF previously reported.\n\nLike all dairy products, this yogurt also contains plenty of calcium (140 mg). If you want to add a boost of fiber, Gorham recommends topping it with a handful of berries or a spoonful of chia seeds.\n\nProtein per serving: 16 g\n\nClio Snacks Original Greek Yogurt Bars\n\nClio Snacks\n\nGreek Yogurt Bar\n\nPros: Contains probiotics, creamy texture\n\nCons: Needs to be refrigerated\n\nThese yogurt bars can go in the fridge or freezer, depending on your texture preferences. You’ll get the protein you’re after, along with calcium and probiotics, in one chocolate-covered package. One tester swooned over a fruity flavor: “The dark chocolate coating complemented the tart strawberry yogurt inside, making it a really interesting combo.”\n\nProtein per serving: 9 g\n\nGood Culture 2% Low-Fat Classic Cottage Cheese\n\nGood Culture\n\n2% Low-Fat Classic Cottage Cheese\n\nPros: Includes probiotics, easy to make sweet or savory\n\nCons: Needs to be refrigerated\n\nWe’re throwing cottage cheese into this category because, like yogurt, you can make it sweet with berries and a drizzle of maple syrup. Or you can go the savory route: “I love whole wheat crackers or toast with Good Culture cottage cheese, sliced tomatoes, olive oil, and salt as a wonderful snack, breakfast, or add-on to a lunch salad,” Van Eck says. “It’s high protein and perfectly tasty, especially in summer when tomatoes are at their peak.” Like the yogurts above, this has probiotics in it that’ll support your gut, and it’s a good source of calcium too.\n\nProtein per serving: 14 g\n\nDrinks\n\nChobani Complete Protein Mixed Berry Vanilla Yogurt Drink\n\nChobani\n\nComplete Protein Mixed Berry Vanilla Yogurt Drink\n\nPros: Easy to eat quickly, no added sugar, good source of calcium\n\nCons: Needs to be refrigerated\n\nI was genuinely shocked the first time I tried this slurpable yogurt because I assumed it would taste chalky when I saw how much protein is in it. It packs a solid 20 grams of milk protein, and has a silky, light consistency that’s easy for me to sip even after my nerves kick in on travel days.\n\nIts blend of blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries provides antioxidants, which can help prevent inflammation disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and have been linked with lowering your risk of cancer. It’s also high in calcium, at 320 mg, and has 3 grams of fiber that, together with protein, gives you the energy boost you want from a snack.\n\nProtein per serving: 20 g\n\nFairlife Nutrition Protein Shakes\n\nFairlife\n\nNutrition Protein Shakes (12-Pack)\n\nPros: No chalky taste, no added sugar, lactose-free\n\nCons: Can be difficult to find online and in stores, needs to be refrigerated\n\nMilk is already high in protein, but this creamy shake is made with ultra-filtered milk, which goes through a filtering process to concentrate protein and lose some lactose (the sugar found in milk). It’s not lacking in sweetness, though, thanks to sucralose and stevia leaf extracts, two artificial sweeteners.\n\n“I like the Fairlife chocolate shakes because they’re lactose-free and don’t have the chalky taste you sometimes get with protein stuff,” one tester says. “They’re super easy to take with you as a snack on the go.” (Just make sure you don’t wait too long to drink it after you take it out of the fridge.)\n\nProtein per serving: 30 g\n\nGet more of SELF’s great product recommendations delivered right to your inbox (for free!).\n\nRelated:\n\n14 Best Protein Bars in 2024, According to Dietitians and Editors\n\n9 Veggies, Fruits, and Herbs You Can Grow on Your Balcony or Patio\n\nThis 2-in-1 Water Bottle Is My Secret to Staying Hydrated"
