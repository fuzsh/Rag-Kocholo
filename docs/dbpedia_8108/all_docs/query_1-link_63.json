        "text": "First let me say that I forgot to mention that we had a problem with the TV lift in the Caravan while we were in Greeley. Basically the TV wouldn't pop up out of the cabinet...that's a problem in my world. We did research on the Internet but weren't able to solve the problem so we will call the factory on Monday.\n\nAnyway, we decided to check out Buffalo Bill Ranch State Recreation Area for camping even though the reviews said it was closed earlier in the season due to flooding. Upon arrival the camp ground was open so we got setup and checked things out.\n\nThe 23 sites are level and gravel with electric, picnic table, grills and fire rings. There is no dump station/showers or water at your site but is available at two locations. It was obvious that the campground had been under water due to the flooding of the North Platte river which is right next to the CG. This is a basic CG but it is nice and located right in town. It cost $13 a day but we did pay an additional $4 for my truck.\n\nWe were informed that the CG just opened last Tuesday. Some areas were still under water not to mention that about 8' from the back of the Caravan there was water. It was very quite and peaceful, the fire topped off the night.\n\nThere was still sand bags through out town.\n\nMonday morning we went to Larry's RV Sales and Service so they could check out the TV lift.\n\nWe dropped of the Caravan, went to breakfast and came back to discover that we had to get a replacement lift and Larry didn't have one, damn. Not to worry though, called DRV and they over nighted one to us, sweet!!! Thank you DRV, what a great company.\n\nWhat to do for the rest of the day??? Well...it's off to the Buffalo Bill's Scout's Rest Ranch.\n\nCol. William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody claimed the title of \"Buffalo Bill\" in a buffalo hunting contest near Sheridan, KS. As a government scout he performed remarkable endurance rides. In 1877 he purchased 160 acres in North Platte which was the foundation for his later 4,000 acre ranch. In response to a plea from the townsfolk to organize an appropriate western celebration for the 4th of July, Cody staged the first Old Glory Blowout in 1882. The \"Blowout\" has since been heralded as the beginning of rodeo in the U.S. It could also be considered a trial run for his Wild West Show. Cody built the home during the heyday of his famous Wild West Show. He raised cattle and horses and introduced blooded stock to this part of the country. He bought thoroughbred horses and high-grade Herefords, shorthorns and polled Angus cattle. His Hereford bull, Earl Horace, was a noted sire of the time. The house was built in 1886 at a cost of $3900.\n\nThe roll-top desk and chair are pieces that Cody owned, as well as the antler chair.\n\nI thought this was an interesting story...\n\nThere is a small river that flows through the estate behind the house.\n\nThe Barn\n\nInside the barn there are various items of life on the ranch.\n\nBuffalo Bill\n\nI kept seeing signs for a Corn Maze so off we went to find it.\n\nWe found it at the Golden Spike Tower which is a visitors center for viewing the world's largest train yard. The corn maze was only done on the weekends (dang) so we toured the tower which gives you a panoramic view of Union Pacific's Bailey Yard. It's where east meets west on the line, and where 10,000 cars are handled each day on 2,850 acres of land stretching out 8 miles.\n\nLocomotive Repair Shop encompasses the same area a three football fields. To the right of the shop there is the Sand Tower which fills the front of the engine. The sand provides traction for the wheels when needed.\n\nDid you know these massive locomotives actually run on electricity. The big diesel engines actually turn a generator, which in turn produces electricity (like my Prius). The electricity runs the electric motors that turn the wheels-engineers adjust the amount of electricity to control engine speed.\n\nIn 1862, president Lincoln signed the Pacific Rail Act into law, clearing the way for Union Pacific and Central Pacific to begin the Transcontinental Railroad from Omaha, NE to Sacramento, CA. North Platte is a central location to service both east and west bound trains.\n\nThe wheels on a rail car are not connected, the rail car simply rests on top of the axle of the wheels and the weight of the car and cargo hold it all together.\n\nSee you can learn things from following my blog :)\n\nAfter a large day of sight seeing we headed back to the Caravan which was parked in Larry's parking lot.\n\nHome is where the Caravan is parked.\n\nThe new lift arrival by 10am the next morning and it was installed with in minutes.\n\nThe lift.\n\nIn case anyone else has this same setup and you have a problem with it here is what you do:\n\n1- order a new one\n\n2-while you wait to get the new one, you can still watch TV. Unplug the unit, then remove 2 screws on each side of the lift and simply pull out the TV.\n\nYou can replace it yourself if you are handy.\n\nThanks again to DRV and Larry's RV for the great service.\n\nHeaded to Cheyenne, WY"
