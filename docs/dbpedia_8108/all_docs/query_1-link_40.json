        "text": "The Beginning\n\nIn those days, safety from marauding Indians was essential. Fort Dodge was established in 1865 on the Santa Fe Trail near the present site of the city, offering protection to wagon trains, the U.S. mail service, and serving as a supply base for troops engaged in the Indian wars. Kiowa, Cheyenne, and other plains tribes inhabited the area, and wild game was abundant including vast herds of buffalo.\n\nJust six years later in 1871, five miles west of the Fort at the foot of a hill along the Trail, a ranger by the name of Henry L. Sutler constructed a three-room sod house. Sutler's home, built to oversee his cattle ranch, became a frequent stopping place for buffalo hunters and traders. Dodge City was founded the next year, 1872, just five miles west of Fort Dodge on the edge of the military reservation, with the Sutler's home as the first building. It quickly became a trade center for travelers and buffalo hunters.\n\nThe Railroad\n\nBy September of 1872, the shiny steel rails of the brand new Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad stretched into view - and a town was waiting. The railroad initiated tremendous growth for many years. Already, south of the tracks, hastily built frame buildings, and tents were housing two grocery and general merchandise stores, a dance hall, a restaurant, a barber shop, a blacksmith shop -- even a saloon next to Sutler's original sod house. The famous Front Street legend had begun. Dodge City was already setting a record for growth.\n\nStacks of buffalo hides towered along Front Street - filthy buffalo hunters and traders filled the town's establishments - and the term \"stinker\" was coined. Trainmasters would take their red caboose lanterns along when visiting the town's \"soiled doves\" - and the term \"red light district\" came to life.\n\nAn estimated 850,000 buffalo hides were shipped from Dodge City in the years 1872-1874. Farmers, during hard times, gathered the buffalo bones and sold them for six to eight dollars a ton. The bones were used in the manufacture of china and fertilizer. By 1875 the buffalo were gone as a source of revenue, but the Longhorn cattle of Texas drove the dollars into town. For ten more years, over five million head of cattle were driven up the Western Trail (earlier known as the Texas Trail) to Dodge City. Law and order came riding into town with such respectable officers as Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, Bill Tilghman, and Charlie Bassett. Out of these personalities evolved the famous fictional character, Marshal Matt Dillon. The town these early men knew was laid out with two Front Streets, one on either side of the railroad tracks. The city passed an ordinance that guns could not be worn or carried north of the \"deadline\" which was the railroad tracks. The south side where \"anything went\" was wide open. In 1876 the population was 1,200, and nineteen businesses were licensed to sell liquor."
