        "text": "ZOPALOTE SPRINGS, AN OLD MAN ON HORSEBACK ONCE KNEW THEIR NAMES\n\n24 x 18 oil on linen panel\n\n​\n\navailable through Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nStory behind the painting…..When my grandad first came to Colorado as a young boy, his father ran a livery barn on the Santa Fe Trail where the non existant town of Amity once stood near the Arkansas river. They also free ranged cattle on the vast open prairies north of the irrigation canals that had just been finished. Later, before World War One, this open prairie was partially settled by homesteaders wishing to cash in on the Great Wheat Boom of the early 1900's. After the War, the wheat prices fell, and combined with the Depression and Dust bowl, every one of these homesteads were abandoned. As a boy my grandfather and I would roam this vast, unfarmed and uninhabited country, hunting coyotes and listening to my Grandad's stories about the \"old days\" of a once unbroken prairie. We would stop by the ruins of some homesteader's dreams, and Grandad would talk about who once lived here, when they came, and when they disappeared, perhaps even relating stories about the people who once lived here. He was always kind of wistful and sad as he shared these revelations. Now today, as I am becoming an old man, I understand the sadness Grandad felt when visiting these places from the past. I understand better the poignant nature of looking back far into the past, realizing you are ghost walking, and those days of yore have long passed on the river of time, never to return. That is what the painting is about, and of my coming of age. As a boy I often heard the Spanish word zopolote used in a derogatory manner in describing unfavorable character, loosely translated to meaning buzzard.\n\nI have spent the past few weeks going through my archive of past paintings. It was noticeable that probably due to painting so many night time scenes, my color choices and palette has become more subdued and less colorful. One of the reasons for creating this piece was to attempt to recapture that wild use of color so vividly shown to me by Buffalo Kaplinski!\n\n​\n\n​TEXANS WITH A BELL LEAD\n\n36 X 36 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nWhat we now think of as the golden age of cowboys and the great cattle drives began with the United States need for beef after the rationing and distress of the American Civil War. In 1865, upon the return of Texas Confederate veterans from the War, much of the wild unfenced pastures of south Texas and northern Mexico were teeming with semi-wild longhorn cattle. Not above rustling cattle from Mexican herds, enterprising Texans gathered cattle into herds of up to ten thousand head each, and set out to trail the cattle north to the newly created railheads in Kansas and Nebraska, accessing lucrative markets to sell beef on the hoof. This enterprise existed for the next twenty five years until the great plains were settled and the prairies fenced, preventing long distance \"drives\" of live cattle. During this time as much as five million head of longhorns were driven north from Texas to the railroads and eastern markets. Of course Americans fell in love with the idea of the hard riding/working cowboy, and myth and lore grew to turn the drover into a world wide icon of independence and adventure.\n\nOften on these drives the trail hands would utilize a well trained dominant steer who had been over the Trail before, tie a cow bell around its neck, and allow it to \"lead\" the other cattle up the trail. Many of these \"lead\" steers were transported back to Texas after a drive to be used again and again. They were generally known as \"bell leads\".\n\n​\n\nNIGHT HERD\n\n20 X 24 oil on linen panel\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI return to the theme of a lone rider watching over cattle at night over and over again. I like the combination of mystery, peacefulness and contemplation such scenes symbolize. I think we all relate to the times of the quiet mind. the simple thoughts, and above all the endless cosmos stretching above our farthermost dreams.\n\nYa'll Been Gone a Long Ole While\n\n20 x 24 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Settlers West Summer Show SETTLERS WEST GALLERY, TUCSON,AZ\n\nMany of us have lost loved ones, persons so close to the fabric of our lives that it is inconceivable that we can exist without their presence in the chaos we call life. But the inevitable happens, time consumes everyone, and there comes a day when we find those treasured individuals no longer present in our daily lives. Yet we endure.\n\nI am in my seventh decade, and naturally I have experienced a number of these losses. I am approaching the fiftieth anniversary of such a loss, and the pain is still intense, my eyes wet with tears. I hope you will forgive this exposing of my deepest thought and feeling, but I need the catharsis, and it is the purpose of an artist to walk out on the razor edge of exposure, to share innermost thought, that we all might explore the confines of our humanity.\n\nHis name was Conrad, Coony, I called him Grandad. He was a farmer and a stockman and a cowboy and we were inseparable for the first twenty two years of my life. He was a child of the nineteenth century, Anglish was his second language. He survived the first World War, and bore the grit and anguish of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. He was quiet spoken. To him a liar was the same as a thief. He detested braggarts, boasting the sign of weak character and dishonor. He believed in the power exerted by the planets and the moon on the energies of plant and animal life. He was filled with stories of the old Western Days, of the successes and trespasses of a life long ago fenced and paved over. I loved him so much, and he loved me.\n\nThe last time we worked together was a fine spring afternoon. We were down on Wolf Creek in a grove of cottonwoods cutting firewood with a balky ancient chainsaw. I recall us sitting on the tailgate of the pickup in the warm spring sun, he quietly smoking his pipe, me relating my new experiences at university where I was surrounded by Easterners, students from the East Coast, who seemed so different and exotic in comparison to the life I was accustomed to. Mein Gott, how eternal those moments!\n\nI returned to school, and just weeks later received a phone call, Grandad had a stroke on a tractor while plowing. I talked to him on the phone and it scared me...he said the days of farming were over. Hanging up I rushed the miles back home to be at his side. He could no longer see or talk, and communicated by gentle pressures of our clasped hands. Several days later I felt his life spirit slowly drift away....in soft evening light, the light filtered and calm. I walked outside in that breathtakingly beautiful light and could not believe such things could happen on a magical evening like this. I was inconsolable.\n\nLater Grandad came to me in my dreams. His was a bird’s eye view of his deathbed, me seated next to him, holding his hand. He was trying to tell me he would be gone for a while.\n\nSo there you have it, the reason I painted this piece and the reason I wrote this story. All of us have lost loved ones, we all handle such in our own ways. It is my fervent hope and desire that a time will come when we too venture out onto the Great Cosmic Stream, to find landing surrounded by loved ones. Even though they’ve been gone a long ole while.\n\nTO KEEP THE HOME-FIRE BURNING\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru \"Quest for the West\" Art Show, Eitlejorg Museum, Indianapolis, Indiana September 6 & 7, 2024\n\nI have lived my life around very strong women. Both my aunt Betty Lou, who recently passed at age 94, and my mother Faye, age 91, endured and prospered despite early widowhood. Their lives were never easy, far from it, yet they persisted keeping family and home-life together and provided for. Both of my sisters, Penny and Jo, are cut from the same cloth, they keep the home-front together and thriving. I see the same characteristics of strength, dedication, and opinion in my daughter Hannah, and five nieces, Aurelia, Mykayla, Olivia, Rayna and Sedonia. I would claim it must be genetics as they are all related. Except my wife, Donna, Hannah's mother, is of the same bent and substance. Perhaps then it is more related to gender? Though a fool, I am wise enough to not pursue this much further. I just know that Sunday is Mother's Day, and at least in my life, most of the females surrounding me are Mothers; strong willed, heavily opinionated, and by God, they keep our families and homes together, loved, and enduring. I know I could not accomplish this to the level of success they do so. This I concede, and am eternally grateful, and that is why I painted this.\n\nSTUDY; LONE PILGRIM FOOTSTEPS\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Buffalo Bill Center of the West Buffalo Bill Art Show and Sale, Scout Sale Cody, Wy\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\n.I am returning to a theme I started over twenty years ago. I have sketched and studied fly-fishermen, not because I am particularly interested in fly fishing, but rather because I am interested in the how and why these individuals pursue this activity. I swear I don’t believe many of them are that concerned with catching fish, rather they are there for the total gestalt….the siren’s call of flowing water, sparkling light on a rippling surface like diamonds cast upon retrievable dreams, and of course the peaceful calm of knowing not even a footstep has been left behind. Rare in life that one can find these meditative opportunities. It is no wonder fly fishing has become a popular pursuit.\n\n​\n\nMAGDALENA (Stone-Writer) AND THE COWBOY\n\n36 X 48 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI can't escape thinking about this place, a remote canyon in southern Colorado, and a woman settler from the early days of the West.\n\nFor fifty years, Magdalena Cordova, carved her name in the stone of these cliffs. I must assume she did so while retrieving water for the Cordova home; a brief respite in what was otherwise, I am sure, a very hard life. I have found seven of her cliff inscriptions, some of them large and ornate and requiring a lot of work to complete.\n\nThis painting is about Magdalena Cordova. Even in her isolated primitive life, Magdalena found a way to stir the pot, break the clock, …with simple musings in stone. I sit on sun-warmed stone in the solitude of the Red Rock Country and think about Magdalena, her dreams and desires, her fears and tribulations. I think about how Magdalena “made her mark”, rose from the vast number of faces of humanity and left inscriptions to ponder over, now a century since her life-time. Her “Marks” are simple, elegant, and long lasting and because of them her memory will run long through the river of time we call history. Would it be that we all did the same, a simple, elegant, long lasting act of ”I am here”. I have several paintings in museums. I don't relate this to brag, rather to rejoice that at least some of the work I will have done on this good earth is in a protected cared-for environment, perhaps lasting with a permanence similar to Magdalena's stone writings.\n\nI also wonder about her husband Juan, saddle sore from checking cattle and sheep, waiting to help bring drinking water back to their frontier home. What did he think of her stone writing? Did he think it frivilous, or was he entranced by her efforts to mark their lives for eternity? Lives spent in severe isolation and hardship; yet a reminder of their lives chipped in red stone, gathered for a host of passing ages.\n\nI think this is something important for all of us to think about; where, what, when, and how we each “leave our mark” for posterity. That is what this painting is about, how despite the enormity of the cosmos and the passage of time, we find ways to ‘mark our turf’ with “Here I am and was!\"\n\n​\n\nAs Sure As Wild Geese Take Wing on November's Cold Breath, So Too Do Old Towns Slow Down\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Buffalo Bill Art Show and Sale, Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Cody, WY September 20, 2024\n\nI painted this from the ideas generated from two previous studies. In this piece I wanted to bring the viewer more into the painting, perhaps making the painting more participatory.\n\nI also wanted to continue to push the theme of the tyranny of the passing of time by adding more life, the dog and birds, representing the fragility of our individual lives vs. the continuity of the natural world. I was raised in farm country that saw vast changes over the past fifty years. The farms have gotten much larger, fewer people live in the communities now, and so many of these small farm towns are becoming empty and often desolate if not deserted. I am not wise enough to know why this has happened, I just know I watched it happen, and it makes me sad. For many of us the changes and desertions are vast and very real. So much so we can never really \"go back home\". What we have left are poinant memorys, carried on the winds that bear a bird's feathered wings.\n\nI worked very hard on the metaphor characterized in this piece. I call the attempt at creating a painting that represents something more than an image of it's subject matter.....hypostasis, a term I borrowed from old alchemist writings. I am also proud of the title...it itself took a lot of thinking and rewriting. I am often criticized for my lengthy titles....I don't give a whit for such critical input, my titles help base the viewer in what I am trying to say with the piece! Completely my choice!\n\n​\n\nSTUDY; THE COWBOY THREW A MEAN FLY\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen panel\n\nAvailable thru \"Quest for the West \" September 6-7, 2024 Eiteljorg Museum, Indianapolis, IN\n\nAden Vanderpool was an old cowboy I knew when I was a boy. He was my grandad's best friend. In their youth they worked as hands on the Baca Grant, a large cattle ranch in southern Colorado. The Grant was headquartered south of the little town of Crestone, CO. The ranching is gone from there today, and the old headquarters is now a New Age store. What was once a ranching community is today a retreat area for people of alternative and religious beliefs. Back in my youth we would visit Aden and his wife May. I recall once going out fishing with Aden. He was telling me stories of his cowboy days on the Grant and the unfenced San Luis Valley. He was a good roper and told me that the trick to successful roping was to throw a loop out so something runs into it! I still admire the simple candor of that roping lesson. I also remember how gracefully he could cast a fishing fly, his line forming gentle slow moving curvatures that surely captured the moments of the present and days long past!\n\n​\n\nSTUDY; IN MY YOUTH I LEFT MY FATHER'S WORDS SILENT\n\n16 X 20 oil on linen panel\n\nAvailable thru \"Quest for the West \" September 6-7, 2024 Eiteljorg Museum, Indianapolis, IN\n\nMy father passed away over forty years ago. I think the relationship between sons and fathers can be a hard one. I come from a long lineage of family psychology that believes a father's first duty is to keep his boot up his son's butt, as a guide to manners and moral behavior. This works well in the son's development... espiecially through the idotic years of adolescence. My father died just as I was leaving that idiotic stage. I survived without Dad around, barely. Now in my years of long teeth and white hair, I think about him a lot, almost daily. I wish in my intemperate youth I would have paid him more attention and less lip. I wish I would have recorded his wealth of stories and that blessed wonderful laugh. I wish we had just a bit more time working together, I could have used more critique on the dexterity with which I used my hands. But hey...if a frog had wings......\n\nSo with Father's Day coming up, I have been trying to remember as much as I can of my father's words. I am truly sorry I ignored so much of his wisdom in the youthful days I had with him. but it is understandable. Now that I am a geezer I see the stupid and idiotic nature of youth...easily and clearly. What else could I expect of myself back then?\n\n​\n\nWHEN YOU BEST BELONG AMONGST WILD FLOWERS\n\n16 X 20 oil on linen panel\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThis painting is about something we have all experienced...when you are working on a job or task that has every concievable thing going wrong with it, and you feel like you are doomed, and the job can never be completed. I recall once as a small boy I was helping my father, Ome, and uncle, Bryan, building a house . they had just started the job, and had all the basement concrete forms in place, ready to pour the basement walls. It was a large house, setting in an alfalfa field yards from a make shift dirt road. the pour was going great, about two thirds completed, when the concrete truck delivering the mix, got too close to the excavation hole, causing the dirt bank to collapse allowing this huge truck to fall into the basement, breaking the forms on one side of the house to, causing some twenty yards, which is a damn large amount of wet concrete, to flow out into the excavation. My uncle had to call for a crane to lift the truck out of the hole, and while waiting on the crane, we all formed a bucket brigade to lift all that wet concrete out of the basement before it set up rock hard. We put bulkheads in to keep as much mix as we could inside the broken forms. Eventually everything was repaired, the truck was removed and the pour was completed. The house is still standing in perfect condition today, sixty years after this incident. My poor father and uncle were exhausted for a week after from working so hard to deal with the mess. I also remember one time during wheat harvest. We were custom cutting wheat, only in those days we had old combines and even more ancient trucks to haul the grain into town. One of the trucks, a 2-ton 1948 Chevy, fully loaded, was being turned around in the field when it got stuck in a big lake like mud puddle. My great uncle, who was driving, made the mistake of popping the clutch when trying to get the truck unstuck, and he snapped a rear axle in two. The old John Deere combine wasn't powerful enough to pull the fully loaded truck out of the mud. We didn't dare dump hundreds of bushels of wheat in the water, so my uncle Jess and I decided to fix it right there in a mud puddle in the middle of an enormous field, maybe fifteen miles from any town. We pulled the broken axle out of the rear wheel hub, took off the differential cover and drained that oil to remove the pieces of broken axle, and drove twenty miles to a farmer we knew who had a similar truck in his junkyard where we pulled the axle from it, brought it back out to the wheat field, and proceeded to put everything back together. All in all it took us two and a half days to get that truck out and driven into town dumping the grain at the Coop elevator. This was two days of laying in water and mud, breaking loose old rusted bolts and swearing like drunken sailors on leave. Like my Dad and Bryan and a basement full of wet cement, we got it done.\n\nThat is what this painting is about....forced into situations we aren't sure we can handle, dreaming up solutions, and ignoring impossibilities, gettin' 'er done!\n\nSTUDY; HOW WE STRUGGLE FOR OUR DECENCY\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Settlers West Miniatures Show Tucson, AZ Feb. 10, 2024\n\nI could go stark raving mad if I dwelled too long on what appears on the news today. The lying, cruelty, fear mongering, self-serving bullshit...it makes one ill being exposed to such an endless litany. I don't have any answers for or against this horrible behavior. I do know that if I get to know a person and not be unerved to look them in the eye, I can participate in conversation where I LISTEN to the other person. LISTENING gives VOICE to everyone I meet. Hard as it is to do, this seems to me as a place to start if we hope to put these days of mistrust and hatred behind us. That is what I was thinking about as I painted this...I recall evenings spent out on this north Texas back road, overcome with a calmness and peace I am unable to describe, but a feeling I truly wish to bring to all my personal relationships and encounters.\n\n​\n\nHILL COUNTRY WALKIN' ROAD\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nAs I get older, the way I remember my past is changing. In my younger days I often reflected more on the exciting action filled days in my life, making ridiculous “recollections” of what I was all about. As I’ve aged into the days of moon bleached hair, I lesser and lesser relate to the exciting happenstances of youth, and fondly recall my more contemplative experiences. The quiet moments; watching the moonrise, listening to the wind of a fair spring evening, the sound of the drip of a blue shale spring while sitting in the shade of a sun bleached summer afternoon, sundown light on the weathered surface of an old adobe, of a single weather scarred tree in a vast plain in the shadow of the Bighorn mountains. More and more these moments are most precious in my mind, and they become sharper and more distinct in their clarity as I accumulate years. That is what this painting is about, that quiet time when all seems right and good, eternal, as if all the great Cosmic answers lie before you.\n\n​\n\nWhere Once Another Age Has Passed\n\n20 x 24 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Eiteljorg Museum Quest for the West Art Show\n\nSeptember 6 - 7, 2024\n\n​\n\nThis is inspired by a small study I painted called Night Watch. I want to develope this idea further....how egocentric our individual lives are perceived from our personal viewpoints when held up against the long timeline of humanity. Yes, we hold the present, many did the same in the past, and many more shall do so in the future, when our present lives have become dust on the wind.\n\n​\n\nALWAYS A CLOCK-WAYS TURN\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nTexas cattleman Charles Goodnight claimed the best way to bring stampeded cattle back under control was to get them to slowly turn to the right, which he called a clock-ways turn, in smaller and smaller circles until they calmed. I don’t think there is any significance “in turning to the right”, but there is in the idea of problem solving problems with patience and easing into solutions... avoiding trying to head them off directly. I know there are too many times when we leap to answers and solutions to problems we only vaguely have identified or understood. Often these hastily and slopingly arrived at solutions only make the problems worse. In the recent past we have seen this happen on a regular basis. Better to heed the wisdom of an old time cowman, developed from a life in the saddle.\n\nLike Utah Carroll, Will You Miss Me Once I’m Gone?\n\n48 x 60 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson, AZ\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI think we all sometimes ponder our place in posterity…the remainder of time after we are gone from this beautiful spinning planet. Not to think it will make any difference to ourselves once we are gone, in the present most of us find comfort in believing that our brief presence here in existence will not immediately be swallowed up by vagaries and tyranny of time, that at least for a brief time favorable memories of our lives will be remembered by those that come after us. I am not wise enough to have any answers, only that the generosity and kindness of our human spirit leaves a gift of immeasurable value for all mankind.\n\nUtah Carroll was the heroic cowboy in an old cowboy ballad, credited with saving the life of a small girl, Varro, or in other examples, Lenore, from death by stampeding cattle. In most versions of the ballad Utah dies with six guns blazing, dropping the charging cattle before being trampled by the herd. The ballad most likely originated in Texas or Mexico as in older versions there are a number of Spanish references. The author being unknown, the song does reflect a strong myth about the courage and unselfishness that we today endear to our beliefs about the \"Cowboy\". In the monumental anthology \"Trail Drivers of Texas\" compiled in 1921 from first hand accounts of men who had driven cattle on the old Texas cow trails, there are many stories of death on the drives. The most common form of death was being struck by lightening followed by snake bite, drowning, and accidents during stampedes. I have visited numerous grave sites of these victims, often in remote and forgotten places. I suspect that from such arose the ballads like Utah Carroll, to memorialize a fallen comrade/friend, earning wages on a dangerous uncertain endeavor\n\nIn my life I was involved in a number of \"accidents\" on horse mounts \"going down\" with me. I was taught at an early age that when such things happen the first thing you try to do is get out of the stirrups, so you don't get drug to death. I am sure that this binding lesson has not changed in a hundred and fifty years. If you carry this theme to a metaphor for surviving todays' \"accidents/misfortune\" may we all survive the fall and avoid bing drug to death. The danger of Utah Carroll's demise is never far from our twenty first century existence.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTRAVELLERS ON THE CAMINO REAL\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Settlers West Gallery's Great American West Show, Tucson, AZ\n\nLast Friday I camped in a \"Dark Zone\" with a 3/4 moon...it was unbelievably bright. When I got home I immediately painted this while the night view was still fresh in my mind.\n\nWhen Spain and Mexico still governed what is today California, Texas, and the modern American Southwest, the Spanish speaking settlements in these areas were some of the most isolated places on the planet. The nearest European contact was in Mexico City, a distance of over 1000 miles, depending where you were at in this vast country. All manufactured and trade goods had to be brought to this area on horseback, over a difficult and dangerous terrain. There were basically three different routes of El Camino Real (the King's Road) from Mexico City into this deep interior. El Camino de California went north thru present day Yuma, Arizona and then north to the missions on the California coast, ending at Mission San Francisco Solano. The Camino Real de los Texas crossed the Rio Grande near present day Laredo, travelling to Bexar (today's San Antonio) and ending at the Sabine River in east Texas. The El Camino Real de Tierra Adento (the interior King's Road) stretched from Mexico City north into New Mexico terminating at San Juan Pueblo. This route was also known as the Silver Road. All of these routes followed ancient Native American footpaths established as trade routes over many centuries of use. They were primarily traveled by horseback and pack mule, as the routes were very difficult and rough to bring wagons or carts over. If you lived in any of these early European settlements, your only contact with the outside world was thru these long and dangerous paths.\n\nI painted this to allow one to think about isolation. Myself, I practically live a hermits life. My isolation is not caused by vast dangerous distances, yet I seem to avoid a great deal of contact with fellow human beings, particularly people I don't share political or cultural beliefs with. I have very fragile \"Camino Reals\" with such people, and I am not sure that is such a good thing. It is so easy to distrust someone and their beliefs and values when you don't have much personal experience with them; I allow too much anecdotal innuendo to influence my take in this kind of situation. This is not a good thing. In many ways I am like some settler isolated from the rest of the world, unwilling to take the risks of a journey on my CAMINO REAL.\n\n​\n\nSTUDY #2; WHERE O' WHERE IS MY SLEEPY EYED BOY\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery Fredericksburg, TX\n\n​\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThe idea for this piece was inspired by John Prine's song, The Sleepy Eyed Boy. I listened to Maura O'Connell's recording of the song over and over while painting this study. I have been thinking about my great grandfather Brase, who being orphaned, struck out alone onto the Western Plains, driving cattle, far from any home he had ever known. I watch my son Zachariah, and see that far away look in his eye, and like myself, had he been born in the days of his great great grandfather, would have followed the wind thru the buffalo grass. These modern times limit that kind of wanderlust, but not for an expansion of the spirit and mind.\n\nI admire individuals who choose to walk a different path, or who refuse the path pressured to follow by others...i think of these as sleepy eyed ___________. I am fortunate to be facebook friends with Becky Patterson, daughter of Hondo Crouch, founder of Luckenbach TX fame, a family of sleepy eyes that profoundly affected my understandings of life; that your path is chosen by the direction your boots are headed, and whether you walk into, or with the wind. That is about the extent of suggested route a sleepy eyed can tolerate!\n\n​\n\nLADS, RIDE LIGHTLY, A HEYS SADDLE\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI return to this story and subject matter again and again, infatuated with the power of storytelling. I was told this story in a beer joint in Trinidad, Colorado one Saturday night about fifteen years ago. I met a rancher from south Texas buying cattle here in Colorado. Discovering we had some common friends from that vast country, I bought him a beer and he proceeded to relate this “story”.\n\nWhat is most curious about this tale is that it was related to me by a rancher living and ranching today...and the event happened over one hundred and thirty years ago! A good example of how an incident can become ingrained within a community and becomes part of the local folklore!\n\nIn the 1870's Captain Leander McNelly organized a \"special force\" of Texas Rangers to bring law and order to an area in south Texas known as the Nueces Strip. A robbery occurred in San Antonio to a good friend of McNelly's, David Heyes, saddle-maker. He was robbed of ten of his hand made saddles and a string of mules. McNelly was furious about the crime and instructed his rangers \"if you see anyone riding a Heyes saddle, shoot first and ask questions later!\" At the end of a month's \"investigations\", his rangers turned in eighteen saddles, eight more than were reported missing!\n\nTo add further irony to the tale, the rancher remarked to me at the end of the story \"Ya'll know, to this day no one knows if any of those eighteen saddles were stolen ones!\"..... RANGER UP!\n\nTexas philanthropist and all around good guy, Jack Guenther, told me his grandfather remembered this incident. Cowboys in the area were so worried if riding a Heyes saddle and of offending McNelly that they rode into the Ranger camp, left their saddle with the Rangers, and rode away bareback! Another twenty first century person holding on to an ageless narrative.\n\n​\n\n​Study of Travelers on the Camino Real\n\n12 x 16 oil on linen board\n\navailable thru Legacy Gallery Small Painting Show Scottsdale, AZ\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nWhen Spain and Mexico still governed what is today California, Texas, and the modern American Southwest, the Spanish speaking settlements in these areas were some of the most isolated places on the planet.

There is something eternal and restful about them, as if for a brief time the only thing in your existence is you, the moon and the stars.\n\nWhen my grandfather was a boy there still remained vestiges of the Teepee people on the vast plains they once called their home. Mostly it was place names, now lost to time, that had been named by the People. Teepee rings, the stones that the People used to hold down the bottoms of their teepees, were still common and not yet covered up by the sands of time. On the Old Camp Grounds would be seen metates, large flat grinding stones. sometimes the ancient fire pits were still visible. On the large old cottonwoods the bark was still worn smooth like silk, from thousands of buffalo rubbing against them, known as Buffalo trees. I have painted one of these vestiges here in this Night Watch painting, to remind all that this green valley was once used by a different people.\n\n​\n\nSTUDY; THE NEXT THING Y'ALL KNOW, YER BOUND FOR HEAVEN\n\n11 x 14 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Legacy Gallery Small Painting Show, SCottsdale, AZ\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nMany years ago I was known as the \"painter of red roofs\"...even having some magazines writing about such nonsense. I recall being inspired by a red roof ranch house I once observed silouetted against the sapphire blue Sangre de Cristo mountains down in New Mexico. I suppose that is what set me off on a long period of painting red roofs. Satisfying the thought that you can teach an old dog new tricks, I left them for a long time until I realized I have just completed, not realizing during the actual crime, that the last two pieces I have recently painted are red roof paintings. I can't explain it, other then I long ago learned to leave sleeping dogs lie. So there you have it, oh my oh my, is it time to man the life boats?\n\nWHERE LIES THE WELL THAT ONCE FILLED MY CUP\n\n20 x 24 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Eiteljorg Museum \"Night of the Artists\" 2023 Indianpolis, IN\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​https://eiteljorg.org/exhibitions/quest-for-the-west/\n\nThere is a danger as one grows older of being complacent about the present and present circumstance. Instead it is easy to become wistful for things in the past, or what we wish the past to have been. Or as Mark Twain once said \"I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.\" It doesn't matter if it is our dreams or our troubles, time puts a damper on accuracy, and memory plays a soft hand. We are best served with the immediacy of the present moment, and all the paraphenalia that rolls down the road before us. I will always visit the intention of days gone by, but I carry a big stick for the snakes of deception.\n\nSTUDY OF CHURCH IN MOONLIGHT\n\n11 x 14 oil on linen panel\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI painted this as a demo for an art group...showing my approach to controlling the palette when painting a nocturne. This church is in the San Luis valley of southern Colorado. It is the church of San Acacio, constructed in 1842 and the oldest standing church in Colorado. Years ago the church was renovated by the parish, led by a dear friend, Father Pat Valdez. I can't think of this church without thinking of Father Pat, and how a man of quiet demeanor and kindness of heart, can leave such an indelible affect upon a community. Oh, but could we all leave such beautiful testimonial of our passing through this life...what a treasure our existence would reflect.\n\nSTUDY OF HARRY\n\n9 X 12 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Eiteljorg Museum\"Night of the Artists\" 2023 INdianpolis, IN\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nhttps://eiteljorg.org/exhibitions/quest-for-the-west/\n\nI had an old rancher friend up north of the Spanish Peaks near Bozeman , Montana. His name was Harry Figgins. He had lived on this ranch his entire life. I would paint on the ranch and Harry would come out and watch me. We would later set around on his front porch and talk, Harry sharing stories about the old days of ranching in the Gallatin valley, me remarking about the art world I traversed in. As the gentrification of Bozeman slowly spread towards his ranch, Harry would remark that in his youth he knew every family in the valley, but not so much now. He hardly knew anyone in the present, as almost all the old family ranches had been sold and developed into luxury second home “country” mansions, the new occupants having little in common with Harry or the life he knew. After Harry’s passing the same thing happened to Harry’s Clear Creek Ranch; the ranch was sold and divided, the old ranch buildings torn down, and gigantic log-cabin monsters raised to replace them. I lost any desire to return to Harry’s old stompin’ grounds, instead I return to Harry and his legacy with my heart and memory. I grasp the memories of that unassuming old man and the treasures he brought into my life, and I am so thankful I have been granted a little time to still plant those good seeds of mankind. I only paint his place now in my memory, like this springhouse his father built in 1913. The new luxury log mansions I leave to a different artist from a different time.\n\nSTUDY OF MIDNIGHT ON THE WATER\n\n11 x 14 oil on linen panel\n\n.I return to this theme often, the mystery of night gathered by the perpetuity of a flowing stream. This reminds me of infinity, or perhaps the closest I can come to thinking about an unknowable thing.\n\n​\n\nSTUDY; THE LAST RIDE OF UTAH CARROLL\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru Eiteljorg Museum \"NIght of the Artists\" 2023 Indianapolis, IN\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​https://eiteljorg.org/exhibitions/quest-for-the-west/\n\nUtah Carroll was the heroic cowboy in an old cowboy ballad, credited with saving the life of a small girl, Varro, or in other examples, Lenore, from death by stampeding cattle. In most versions of the ballad Utah dies with six guns blazing, dropping the charging cattle before being trampled by the herd. The ballad most likely originated in Texas or Mexico as in older versions there are a number of Spanish references. The author being unknown, the song does reflect a strong myth about the courage and unselfishness that we today endear to our beliefs about the \"Cowboy\". In the monumental anthology \"Trail Drivers of Texas\" compiled in 1921 from first hand accounts of men who had driven cattle on the old Texas cow trails, there are many stories of death on the drives. The most common form of death was being struck by lightening followed by snake bite, drowning, and accidents during stampedes. I have visited numerous grave sites of these victims, often in remote and forgotten places. I suspect that from such arose the ballads like Utah Carroll, to memorialize a fallen comrade/friend, earning wages on a dangerous uncertain endeavor\n\nIn my life I was involved in a number of \"accidents\" on horse mounts \"going down\" with me. I was taught at an early age that when such things happen the first thing you try to do is get out of the stirrups, so you don't get drug to death. I am sure that this binding lesson has not changed in a hundred and fifty years. If you carry this theme to a metaphor for surviving todays' \"accidents/misfortune\" may we all survive the fall and avoid bing drug to death. The danger of Utah Carroll's demise is never far from our twenty first century existence.\n\n​\n\nEl Paso, Una Puerta Haint (the passing, a haint door)\n\n48 x 60 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson, AZ\n\n​\n\nThis is my final piece in the \"Haint Door\" series I have been working on. Haint blue is the color that the peoples in the Gullah country of South Carolina and the Spanish speaking people of the Southwest United States paint their windowsills and doors. To some this color protects their homes from evil spirits and witches, or 'haints', because the haints think the blue is water, which is something they can't cross! To other people the haint blue color protects their homes because it is the color of God's eyes, which repels evil and bad luck. I am infatuated with custom, tradition, and myth. Our lives are listless and unconnected without them, and it is easy to lose our humanity when living in ignorance of legend and saga. As with most of my work, I am at heart a ghost walker, in battle with the ravages of time. This is how I imagine Canyon Road in Santa Fe to have existed before automobiles, tourism, and the conformity of television altered our existence and living traditions.\n\nEverything I Ever Wanted To Say\n\n​20 X 24 oil on linen panel\n\n​available thru Cawdrey Gallery, Whitefish, MT\n\nI don't remember where I first saw this light. It was many many years ago. I recall I was in a mountain valley, and a storm was coming down hard off the mountain. I also remember being in a hurry to find a paved road as it looked like I was due for a gully washer, and I didn't want ot get stuck in the middle of nowhere's mud. Despite the hurry, I stopped for about ten minutes to watch the light change as the storm swept across the valley, thinking many thoughts, one of which was I wanted to etch this moment in my mind, I didn't want a camera to interfere with what I was feeling.\n\nI was thinking about how transitory everything in our lives is. We live in an existence of constant change, the great Cosmic River never satisfied with damming up and staying put as still water. I thought about the many things from the past I still missed, days and people now gone, even places changed to a point of not recognizing them any more. That is the tyranny of time...though it provides us with a hope for the future, it takes apart and away things held close to our hearts in the present, rapidly turning them into the past tense. That is what this painting is about, or at least about a young man who waited for the days of grey hair to paint his thoughts.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nKEEP A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen panel\n\nAVAILABLE THRU SETTLERS WEST GALLERY'S GREAT AMERICAN WEST SHOW\n\nThis has been a rough year for me. I survived life threatening illness and then major surgery. I was in and out of the hospital numerous times, and was bedridden much of the year. It seemed like health wise it was just one thing after another. To add to the trauma, several old friends passed away during this same period, all of them my same age. I have been depressed, very depressed. What has kept me going and looking to the future has been my wife, family, and the support of many friends…without whom I do not know where I would be. That is what this painting if about. That and the gratitude I feel for still breathing the air of this blessed beautiful planet.\n\nI had an old rancher friend up north of the Spanish Peaks near Bozeman , Montana. His name was Harry Figgins. He had lived on this ranch his entire life, his father built this springhouse you see here in 1913. I would paint on the ranch and Harry would come out and watch me. We would later set around on his front porch and talk, Harry sharing stories about the old days of ranching in the Gallatin valley, me remarking about the art world I traversed in. As the gentrification of Bozeman slowly spread towards his ranch, Harry would remark that in his youth he knew every family in the valley, but not so much now. He hardly knew anyone in the present, as almost all the old family ranches had been sold and developed into luxury second home “country” mansions, the new occupants having little in common with Harry or the life he knew.

As you get larger with a painting, a number of problems arise...namely you have a lot more canvas to cover, and a small brushstroke doesn't read all that well. In addition, Each time I approach the idea, I see slight changes to improve it compositionally and perhaps even its hypostatic content.\n\nI did a sketch of Canyon Road in Santa Fe years ago, which is the basis for this nocturne. In South Carolina where the Gullah culture and dialect is prominent, doors and windows are painted blue, as they also do in old Spanish speaking settlements in New Mexico. Gullah refers to this color as \"haint\" blue, believed to keep witches and evil spirits from entering the home. Because of these supernatural powers accorded this color, I have painted this door haint blue,bathed in the mystery of a full moon.\n\nIF I HAD A BOAT I'D HEAD ON OUT TO SEA\n\n30 X 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nAvailable thru Buffalo Bill Art Show and Sale, Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Cody, WY Sept. 22-23, 2023\n\nIn this piece I was interested in painting high action to contrast with the silent calmness of night time. I was inspired by the song \"If I had a Boat\" by Lyle Lovett and am imagining someone who is currently wishing they had made some different life choices. Haven't we all been in this predicament? I certainly have, many more times than once. I am always interested in the rounder's ways, and the eternal search for redemption.\n\n​\n\n​\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, T\n\n​\n\n​VAQUERO\n\n16 x 12 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI am enthralled by the brilliance of light in many of Frederick Remington's day scenes. I studied his palette carefully and attempted to create this brilliant sort of glaring light. A vaquero is a Mexican cowboy, or rather a cowboy of Spanish speaking descent. Reading the 1619 PROJECT it is very apparent we take a great deal of our history for granted or ignore or are ignorant of it altogether. Did you know that forty percent of the cowboys who drove cattle up the Texas cow trails were people of color? Almost everything about the American cowboy is derived from the traditions and skills of these Spanish speaking cattle workers, LOS VAQUEROS.\n\n​\n\nHEED THEE WELL WHEN WEST WINDS BLOW\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\n​\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nI remember as a boy my grandad Coony giving me this warning. It seemed the worst weather came to us off the Rocky Mountains especially from the northwest. My father was caught in a blizzard many years ago that moved in from such directions, and his little brother froze to death in the storm. I am carrying the warning further, to a metaphorical portent for the storms of our times. There are many \"directions\" I now watch very closely, keeping my father and grandfather in mind; heeding the omens of falsity and untruth, the harbingers of greed and avarice\n\nRISING ON NESPESTE'\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson, AZ\n\nI grew up on my Grandfather's farm in southeastern Colorado. The Arkansas River, with the old Santa Fe Trail rolling along beside it, was about a mile south of our farmhouse across a vast buffalo grass prairie. Either on horseback or on foot, I spent much of my time here, imagining buffalo hunts, oxen pulled wagons, of the prairies before the fences came. Living on a main migratory bird flyway, I witnessed this scene many times, vast numbers of waterfowl rising from the icy cold October waters. Nepeste' was a Comanche name for the Arkansas River meaning \"big water\". Bigger still were the dreams inspired by its' flowing waters.\n\nThis is the first painting I have completed in many weeks, having been laid up with foul health. I painted it from memory, looking forward very soon to some major surgery. I pray and hope for a return to good health and a great many more paintings stirring within this artist's heart and soul. Slainte'\n\n​\n\nSUM BITCH, CAIN'T GO FISHIN' 'CAUSE FISH DRAW FLIES\n\n40 x 30 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThis is my piece in this years Buffalo Bill Art Auction in Cody, WY, September 24th, 2022. This is the first time in years I won't be present for the Auction or painting in the Quick Draw. I can't begin to describe how disappointed I am, getting to see and visit with so many old friends, artists, and patrons. I have been very sick, but on the mend. It looks like I am headed for heart surgery in a few weeks. Needless to say I am weak and easily fatigued, and my wife won't allow me to travel. The prognosis is all very good, just going to take some time and healing. So may I raise a glass of good cheer, to all my dear comrades, that we may gather again in the near future.\n\nI have always admired the down to earth lyrics of the late song writer Blaze Foley. His song \"Good Cheeseburgers\" was an inspiration for this painting. Most of us have known individuals, or been guilty of, coming up with ridiculous reasons for either doing or not doing something. We will dream up piles of bunk to justify our \"Reasoning\", rather than simply self-employing IFU's...( I F____ED UP) So here's to us all...and the fish we will never hook!\n\n​\n\nI HAVE ALWAYS LEARNED BEST BY OPEN GATES\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nMy preference in art is work that represents symbolism, metaphor, allegory, something that encourages the painting to represent more than an image of itself. I call this having high hypostasistic content. Getting away from the big words, I am sturck with the pronounced assurdedness people today state and hold their beliefs and prejudices. It seems about ninety per cent of us, of all genders and persuasions, are convinced that we are \"correct\" about what we hold as truthful and fact. Those of opposite view we hold as misguided, ignorant, or downright untruthful. That may be, there certainly is a lot of chicanery in the world of today, but I am still mindful of something I heard in my youth; it went something like this: \"You can cover much ground over a day of hard ride but remember, you can't ride a horse thru a shut gate\". With that I will let you the viewer figure out what this painting is all about\n\n​\n\nStudy: WHEN TOWNS SLOW DOWN\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI was born out on the Buffalo Range, the Great Plains. My great great grandparents came to these vast lands after the Civil War. They saw many changes there, from the Tepee People being being forced off it, to the decimation and disappearance of the buffalo, cattle replacing them. The history of this sea-like land is one of change, often violent, frequently painful, always poignant.\n\nMy great grandfather mourned the fencing of the prairies. My grandfather spoke of the land filling up with homesteaders, inspired by the Great Wheat Boom, turning over much of the sod with the plow, then watching their dreams destroyed by the wrath of the Dust Bowl, the Dirty Thirties. This influx of dreamers, in prodigious numbers, encouraged the emergence of many farming towns across the Plains, with accompanying support businesses: blacksmith shops, banks, mercantiles, drugstores, etc. Even with the Depression and the Dust Bowl caused exodus, these towns managed to survive thru the Second World War, when electricity and paved roads came to many of the isolated communities spread out across immeasurable isolation and distances. My family always alludes to this time as the coming of Modern Times. This modernization came at a cost...the automobile and good roads made travel easier across great distances to find more selection and cheaper prices for goods and supplies. We no longer needed the local small town merchants. Slowly and steadily these small businesses went out of existence, to the extent that today many of these small communities are mere ghost towns, buildings vacant and falling into disrepair. I grew up near one such community, Bristol, Colorado, and my dear friends still acquainted with the town, will attest to its slow inevitable decline. It doesn't matter what the community; a manufacturing town in the Rust Belt, a mill-town in the Northeast, an oil town in the Panhandle, modernization and globalization have forced economics to grow too large for the small local community, at least in many instances. We have replaced the nature of small local community with something on a larger \"grander\" scale; I don't know, maybe something like LARGER TRIBES ? I am an artist, practically a hermit, genuinely self-absorbed. I have not the wisdom to either understand what has happened or suggest what can be done about it. I just know things changed, and it makes me sad and that is why I have painted this.\n\n​\n\nShe Comes From My Mother the Mountain\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI have recently been listening repeatedly to a song written by Texas songwriter Townes Van Zandt titled “Our Mother the Mountain”. It is a haunting story of falling in love with a siren:\n\n\"So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'\n\nBy mother the mountain I swear that it's true\n\nLove not a woman with hair black as midnight\n\nAnd her dress made of satin all shimmerin’ blue”\n\nI am fortunate to have lived in the days of the great Texas troubadours, Townes, Steve Earl, Guy Clark and many others, for me like living through the age of Shakespeare and the great English poets.\n\n​\n\n​SWEET BABY JAMES\n\n48 x 36 oil on canvas\n\navailable through Sanders Galleries, Tucson\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI hope this painting represents the naivete' by which so many of us apporoach life and the circumstances of daily living. We let myth and pomp line the nestings of our lives, ignoring the harsh realities that actually flavor and color life; that is we allow this ignorance to exist in the future tense, but it blooms in the \"intelligence\" of looking backward in time. Aye, we can celebrate in the romanticism of the cowboy, until the cattle stampede and the faithful mount uncorks a violence that adds to the tempest and the thin line between success and failure.\n\n​\n\nOpen Gate with Crows\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThis painting actually represents some interesting history. I sketched this barn on location south of Cartersville, Georgia. This particular farm still had original 19th century buildings on it, remarkable for this area because virtually everyhting was destroyed as General Sherman passed through in 1864-65 on his \"March to the Sea\" to break the backbone of the Confederacy. This farm was preserved because Sherman had attended West Point with the farmer's son, and had once visited the place as a young man. He ordered his troops to leave the farm unscathed out of respect for his former friends.\n\nCrow sybolism includes cleverness, teamwork and transformation. Because of their high intelligence the crow spirit animal is sacred and revered. I think they are a suitable substitute for putting cowboys in a painting! I think they are great partners for the symbolism of an open gate!\n\n​\n\nTrail Boss at Buffalo Gap\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\n​\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nBuffalo Gap, a natural pass on the old Great Western Cattle Trail,\n\nlies south of present day Abilene, Texas. Since the Ice Age, this has been a natural passage spot from mammoths to buffalo to modern day motorists. Years ago I spent a lot of time here with my friends the Peughs, hiking the benches, imagining the ancient traffic that has passed through this mystical location.\n\n​\n\nStudy; How Can You Say that You're Lonely\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen panel\n\navailable thru the 2022 Buffalo Bill Art Show miniatures\n\nCody, WY\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI have painted this as a study for a larger piece I will be painting for the Eiteljorg Museum. I reflect again and again on the early life of my great grandfather, Conrad Brase. Orphaned at an early age, he was seperated from his twin sister and sent from farm to farm as a hand and servant. Around the age of 12 he managed to run away from his predicament and crossed the country odd jobbing and walking. He ended up in Texas, where he gained employment as a cattle drover, first coming to Colorado driving cattle on the Goodnight Trail. Being a German speaker, \"der anglish\" was hard for him. He died long before I was born, but my grandmother, who married his son Coony, had fond memories of him; that he was quiet, soft spoken, and very kind. I think about his hard early life, stranded in a new land, no family to speak of. What were his days out on the vast plains like, espiecially at night riding night herd? What did he daydream, and what lanquage did he dream them in. Not many people think of him anymore, people and family who might have known him have all passed on. I still do, but what happens when I pass on? Will consideration of his long lonely days pass away, consumed by the unrelenting passage of time?\n\n​\n\nLes Dindons; (the turkeys) Sometimes One Will Do What Must Be Done\n\n30 x 24 oil on linen\n\n​available thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nRecently an old high school friend took me on a tour of his ranch, in southeastern Colorado, founded by his family in 1884. It is a beautiful place, with rolling prairies and spring fed stone lined canyons, some twenty to twenty five sections in size. His grandmother was running the ranch during the Great Depression, a time that people there, in the heart of the Dust Bowl, referred to as the \"Dirty Thirties\". Their springs were drying up, and the grass was rapidly disappearing. This steadfast ranch woman decided to sell all the cattle, as the land could no longer support them. She took that money and purchased 5,000 turkeys, and ran them free range on the depleted pastures, the turkeys thriving on the millions of locust that had descended upon the ravaged ranch land. In order to protect the birds from wolf and coyote predators, her sons and hired men safe-herded the turkeys on horseback, adding a new meaning to \"cowboy\". These brave and innovative actions saved the ranch during the worst of hard times! This story reminds me that there is a lot more to the WEST than cowboys and gunfights. The WEST I grew up around was a lot more than high heeled boots and stetson hats. It was more about surviving all the misfortune that could fall uopn this vast land, enduring with hard work, and luck! It was about grit in your teeth and spit in your eye. The shoot-em up Hollywood version of the OLD WEST was something that the people I was raised around had nothing to do with! I like to think I don't either.\n\nMy painting inspIration was a painting created by Claude Monet in 1876 titled Les Dindons.\n\n​\n\nOn the Graveyard Watch\n\n20 x 24 oil on oil primed linen\n\n​available thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI paint a number of “night watch” paintings. They seem mysterious and yet commonplace, anyone can identify with the quiet non-harried moments they represent. Both my grandfather and his father before him free-ranged cattle. Both were German speakers. I often think about their daydreams, and the language they dreamed in. What were their dreams in the long nights of watching cattle, did they come to pass, did the passage of time flow as quickly through their expansive lives as it does my current one? Did they hanker for days long past, or were they content with their present and an eternally star-filled sky?\n\n​\n\nStudy, Long Ago I Used to be a Young Man\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nI can guarantee that in my youth I spent a lot more time on the end of a long handled shovel than ever In a saddle. I grew up on the Great Plains, the \"Great American Desert\". Water was a most cherished item, and was always carefully watched over. My grandad Coony called caring for the water \"Irgaten\", and it took up a big part of our time in summer and fall. In Coony's youth he spent many lonely nights alone out on the prairie watching over his father's free ranged cattle. Though in my youth we ran cattle too, they no longer required constant attention. But the water did, and like my grandfather before me, you stayed with the water and slept in the fields. I recall one summer period when I never slept in the house for over two weeks, the ground and a pickup seat were my bedrolls. My grandfather died from a stroke that occurred when he was driving a tractor in the field. While preparing for and waiting for his funeral, I took care of the run of water he had also going on. I will never forget the pain and saddness of following his last footprints captured in the mud fof the irrigated fields. These footprints were hard to live with, and still harder to remember. They reminded me that our lives are like wind through the buffalo grass.\n\n​\n\nSome Who Will Never Hoe Corn\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nALISON KRAUSS, PATRICK BRAYER, JERRY DOUGLAS, RON BLOCK, BARRY BALES, and DAN TYMINSKI wrote and perform a wonderful song titled The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn. I have borrowed the title to push forward an observation I have made over the years. I was born and live in Colorado, a beautiful western state that has seen tremendous population growth. Most of this growth is accountable to special people, seeking a new and adventurous western lifestyle. I admire this desire to be WESTERN, to become WESTERNESSE (my term), to pursue a life where you expand your nature and opportunity. I think this painting perfectly represents that adventurous soul, following their dreams.\n\nNow I personally have worked cattle, and I have hoed corn. I always liked the farming aspect of things, seeing things grown, with your eye to the skies and weather. I lived to go out checking cattle on horseback, where your heart and eye can expand in a multitide of directions. Other than that, tending to cattle wasn't all that great, at least for me. It was often dusty, dirty, and fraught with danger and peril...I don't know how many times I have been tail twisting some balky scouring cow up a loading chute and the sumbitch shits all over me, or the facefuls of squirting blood I've tasted when branding and dehorning. Every cowman I know who have spent their whole lives with cattle almost without exception have beautiful perfect-teeth smiles...on account of a mouthful of dentures from having teeth kicked in or punched out in some sort of cattle induced incident. I suppose if I were true to my calling, I would have a picture of a guy with a long handled irgaten shovel in a green field, with a title \"The Boy Who Wouldn't Punch Cows\" but then that doesn't sit well with the romanticism of the West, so I will go with what I called here in this picture!\n\n​\n\nWestern Skies\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\nhttps://eiteljorg.org/exhibitions/quest-for-the-west/\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI painted this while sitting under a gazebo on Whitefish Lake, Montana, while rain moved across the lake. Looking straight west you could see the sun breaking on mountains in the distance, a small fishing boat was heading home to safety. There was something magical about the morning, the light spectacular in a stormy kind of way. Sometimes there is great joy in capturing the ordinary, spur of the moment portions of our lives. They pass too quickly, and are too easily forgotten.\n\n​\n\nQuakies\n\n20 x 24 oil on linen\n\nhttps://eiteljorg.org/exhibitions/quest-for-the-west/\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThe term \"Quakies\" was used when I was a boy to designate aspen trees, because their leaves shook or quaked from a passing soft breeze. Many years ago I sketched and painted this old adobe church in the area of Arroyo Seco, New Mexico. I don't know if it is still standing today. More than likely it has been vandalized into complete ruin, at the very least the soquete melting back into the earth it sprang from. That is sort of what this painting is about, the intransigent nature of the passage of time. Here in the United States we tend to let our past slip away, erode back into the forever past. You see this with our disregard for old things, buildings, places...if we do preserve them we label them as antique, turn them into tourist attractions, which drives them even further into an hazy past. For a ghost walker like myself, this is a bitter brew to swallow, when only my aging memory links today with the distancing past.\n\n​\n\nStudy, A Saddle Will Never Lead Me to Where My Heart Lies\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI paint so many Cowboy/western things, I need a break. This scene is at a township called Inches, near Eyeries, west County Cork, Ireland...Western Ireland! As the name implies, should my fortunes be different, this is where I would choose to be. This land has a hold on me, has so my entire life. When I walk these lands, I feel I have known the place for ages, that 'things' lie hidden behind a veil, and voices speak to me, faint and partial, as if heard through the mists of the soft green rain. Much like the cowboy days, here in this land I ghost walk with ease, unfettered with reality, nurtured by the mysticism of the what-if and the un-seen.\n\n​\n\n​Crossing at Red River Station\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nAVILABLE THRU ADOBE GALLERY, RUIDOSO, NM\n\nThe Chisholm Trail was a route that Texas cattleman used to trail their cattle north to the railroads in Kansas, and hence to eastern markets. It was used for over twenty years, millions of Texas longhorns finding their way to eastern markets, or new western rangelands. The principle crossing of the broad Red River, the southern boundery of the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and the state of Texas, was at Red River Station, northwest of present day Nocona, Texas. Crossing a river with a herd of cattle was tricky business. One technique for balky cattle who did not want to enter the water was to drive them at high speed directly at the water, hoping to \"stampede\" them into and then across the water. Doesn't that sound a lot like how many of us deal with obstacles even today; putting our heads down and barging headlong into the problem!\n\n​\n\nNight Herd with Starry Night\n\n24 x 30 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nI paint a number of “night watch” paintings. They seem mysterious and yet commonplace, anyone can identify with the quiet non-harried moments they represent. Both my grandfather and his father, who worked cattle on the Goodnight Trail, free-ranged cattle. Both were German speakers. I often think about their daydreams, and the language they dreamed in particularly when out on the open range, alone under prairie moonlight. What were their dreams in the long nights of watching cattle, did they come to pass, did the passage of time flow as quickly through their expansive lives as it does my current one? Did they hanker for days long past, or were they content with their present and an eternally star-filled sky?\n\nComing Home is Such a Ride\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI recall my grandfather telling me about the hard times during the GREAT DEPRESSION. He had no money for his family; what crops would grow, this was in the heart of the Dust Bowl, or livestock that stayed alive, there was no market to sell in, they were worthless. HIs only cash income came from work on the WPA. He would get to work one week a month for a dollar a day, room and board, and feed for his horses. HIs pay included him providing a team of horses. He rode his horses forty miles to the WPA work site, building a road. Then he would ride home. seven dollars in his pocket, HARD CASH. When I was a small boy we lived in a farm house east of Denver. My father had gone to Nebraska for a carpentry job, times were hard for us, though they tried to keep that from me and my brother. We didn't see him all winter, my mom keeping us warm cutting firewood and stoking the wood stove in the center of our home. It was such joy seeing him come back home, his great smile and laughter showing the longing he had for home. Later in life, I supported my family travelling the country selling art and craftwork at art festivals. Many is the time I ended a show with a whole country between myself and home, wishing with all my heart I was back with wife and family. I and my family have hard experience with having to leave home to support ourselves, and that blissul feeling of knowing that finally we can come home. That is what this painting is about....something I think many of us can relate to.\n\n​\n\nThose Who Have Known True Gods of Sand and Stone\n\n30 x 24 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThe title for this painting was borrowed/inspired from the poem by Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh, \"Raglan Road\". The painting is about our participation in mythology, how none of us, despite our desires and wishes, can ever accurately portray the Old American West, as we never lived it. We are generations removed from those times, and at best our representations of those past times are through our personal prejudices and distortions\n\nStraw Boss; As Sand Passes the Hourglass\n\n40 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nMy grandfather, who helped raise me, foresaw ranching and farming moving away from small family holdings towards large corporate control and entities. He felt this change was inevitable, much as the great trail herds and unfenced prairies passed from the existence of his father before him. Change, the passing of eras, is a curse laid before us all. Change that can be slow and barely noticeable, or perhaps violent and quick. However change presents itself, its tyranny befalls us, we are never free from it. At least that is what this painting is about... the slow but sure, the always going away.\n\nLong Rope on Caprock\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson, AZ\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nWhen I was a boy my uncle Jess had an ancient hand woven rawhide rope and a pair of very large roweled Mexican spurs. The \"larietta\" must have been over sixty feet long. I couldn't believe anyone could throw a loop that bloody far. He said there were vaqueros who had no trouble using a \"long rope\"! So as a boy, that was one of the mysteries I came to ponder on. Many years later I saw a roper not only accurately toss a long rope, but could do all kinds of amazing catches, at amazing distances. Old timers called this skill \"being \"salty\" with a rope!\" I thought it magic, and led to my belief in the supernatural!\n\n​\n\nAs We Make the Clockways Turn\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\n​\n\navailable thru Sanders Gallery, Tucson, AZ\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nCharles Goodnight, a Texas cattleman and trail blazer, once said that there was a technique to getting a stampeding cattle herd back under control. The trick was to get the cattle to run in a giant circle to the right, what he called \"clockways\". You kept trying to get the stampeding circle to run in smaller and smaller circles until the herd calmed down and were able to stop milling. I feel like we have ALL just been or are still in a wild stampede called COVID. Aid has finally got this \"stampede\" turned in a \"clockways\" direction and we are running in smaller and smaller circles, hopefully to a day when our blind dash has returned to a calming place on the trail.\n\n​\n\nTHE SILENCE OF A FALLEN STAR\n\n22 x 30 oil on linen\n\navailable at the 2021 \"Night of the Artists\" Show,\n\nBriscoe Museum, San Antonio, TX March 26-27, 2021\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI can recall in my youth being infatuated with cowboys. I was surrounded by them, many aged and remembering the days before the prairies were fenced. I lived on my grandfather's knee, immersed in stories of nights on the prairie, of traveling the plains with watersheds as the road map, inescapable accidents and injuries from ornery cattle. In my influential youth I strove to live up to the ways and means of these time-settled cowboys; \"I grew up dreamin' of bein' a cowboy\". The popular American Culture held the cowboy in high regard, from countless \"western\" movies and TV shows. I mean, for crying out loud, I once got to meet my long held hero.... Roy Rogers.\n\nSadly today, at least to me, in this current period of my life I refer to as my \"days of gray\", it seems the \"cowboy\" is not held in as high of esteem by the general public as he was in my earliest days. The noun, cowboy, has been turned into a present-day verb, denoting a tendency towards violent action. Western movies and TV shows are for all practical purposes out of favor and non existent, the public has no taste for them anymore. The present self-proclaimed \"art critics\" look down upon my work, judging it diminutive and historically redundant, like I give a whit what they think! The \"cowboys\" that filled and influenced my developing years were independent to high degree, honor bound to their \"word\", generous of heart, and used biting ironic humor in place of bragging and grandiose. They, \"by god, had no tolerance for bullshit.\"\n\nYes, I believe it regrettable that we are losing one of our greatest symbols of America, and what we once believed in with such great faith. Our identity with the heroic cowboy, and all the mythos we once attached to this legendary figure, is being replaced. Replaced with a tolerance for lies, treachery, and greed. WE have created a new \"heroic\" character whose characteristics are built around ignoring truth for self-serving lies, no sense of honor or decency, the swagger of limitless boast, and a clenched grasp on personal/monetary gain. Winning at all cost is the new mantra, and that fierce sense of cowboy independence is being handed over, to be replaced by the unswerving loyalty to a single man, whom deserves being spelled with no capital letters! I have just stated the reason I painted this piece. Think hard about the title \"THE SILENCE OF A FALLEN STAR\".\n\n​\n\nStille' Nacht; When Father Drove a Red Two-Board Studebaker\n\n36 x 48 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nMost people are unaware that the Studebaker Company was a manufacturer of fine wooden horse drawn wagons long before they began producing automobiles and trucks. In this painting I am trying to depict the simplicity by which so many people combine the secular with the non-secular. When I have visited simple country adobe churches, I get the same grand feeling of God's presence within these walls of soquete, as I do in the vast soaring cathedrals of Europe. One overwhelms me with the sheer majesty of its intricate artwork and architecture, the other with its elegant sense of being \"of the earth\".\n\n​\n\nI Came to a Place Where the Lone Pilgrim Lay\n\n36 x 48 oil on canvas\n\n​available thru Cawdrey Gallery, Whitefish, MTZ\n\nIn Memory of Tom Horn:\n\nThis is another of my feeble attempts to break down, to rage against the tyranny of time. I have fought this battle for a half century, yet my limbs grow slower, my hair more moon-bleached. I ponder as I apply brush strokes to the canvas, what thoughts pass through the viewer of this work a hundred years hence, two hundred years later? Will they know what I carry in my heart today? Am I on a great mandala of life, and will I return one day to this same experience, or am I adrift on a great \"river\" flowing endlessly through the Cosmos, heeding shoal water and seeking shoreline that is forever changing? A dear friend passed this week from the plague scourging our fair land. When and where will I hear his sweet self deprecating laughter again?\n\n​\n\nLone Star and the Sweet Promenade\n\n40 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI have painted this theme many times, from a visit to Texas over forty years ago. I was thinking of farming people, my Mother's soft panhandle accent, and our rapid descent into the twenty first century. In many ways I am not prepared for modernity, I don't know if I ever will. I don't know if I want to be. When a boy, living on my grandfather Coony Brase's farm, we would often take a late afternoon break from the heat of the day and travel three miles into the small farming community of Bristol to enjoy a cool “bot’el pop”. On numerous occasions a very old man, whom I only ever knew as old Tom, would ride into town horseback leading a whole bevy of children on horse back. He would take them to Felix Smith’s store where he would treat them to penny candy abundant on Felix’s shelves, and then without ceremony ride them the four miles back to the their homes and the tar paper shack he lived in. Later, as I grew larger and stronger, I would help my uncle Jesse Lee cut firewood to take to old Tom, which he burned in a stove made from a fifty gallon oil barrel, in his house with no electricity or running water. After my Uncle Jess died, I still continued the ritual of making sure Old Tom had wood to stay warm with, and he and I became good friends. Tom had been a cowboy on what was once known as the Colorado Trail, a cow trail that skirted the Colorado/Kansas state line, allowing Texas cattleman to avoid the quarantine on Texas cattle imposed by the state of Kansas. Tom had been born in a homestead dugout on the west Kansas plain, his father, a Confederate veteran proved up. Tom’s father had come to Kansas trailing cattle from Texas on the Chisholm Trail. Later Tom opened a barbershop in the notorious Trail City, on the stateline, and later moved to the Holly, Colorado area, working cattle and breaking horses. He joined the US cavalry around 1915, and rode with Black Jack Pershing and the US Army chasing Pancho Villa down into Mexico. One of his good friends was Henry Starr, the man who robbed the Amity Bank in 1907, and then escaped down into the Indian Territory, later becoming the state of Oklahoma. My grandfather Coony came to Amity a month after the bank was robbed, his father running the Livery Stable at Amity, and acquainted with Mr. Starr. My visits with old Tom were miracles of story telling and first hand accounts of an amazing life. In 1976 the Bicentennial wagon train came down the Santa Fe Trail, which ran below my grandparents’s place. I saddled up and rode with them for a ways. For several nights after the Train camped in Granada, and I picked up old Tom in my truck, he could no longer mount a horse, and took him down to enjoy the bar-b-que and fiddle and dance music later. I recall several of Tom’s old fiddling friends were featured, John Willhite, and Tip Warman. Old Tom had a great time. That was the last time I saw Old Tom. The next time I went over to his place, it was empty and silent. He was taken into a nursing home in Holly, and died shortly after. I never forgot the magic this old man brought to lives, at least to mine, and I wanted this to be remembered in a painting: that our humanity is best represented by very small events, perhaps never earth shaking in scope and scale, but forever representative of the best part of our intentions and nobility.​\n\n​\n\nHeading the Point at Red River Station\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nRed River Station was an early cattle crossing on the treacherous Red River which separates southern Oklahoma, during the cattle drive heyday the Indian Territory, and north Texaas. The crossing was near the ghost town of Spanish Fort Texas, north of Nocona, Texas. It was here some six million head of longhorn cattle were driven on the Chisholm Cattle Trail to beef markets in midwest and eastern United States. The bulk of cattle drives occurred between 1866 and 1890. I was told many stories about the Trail and the cowboys who worked the cattle drives by the deceased Avril Waggoner, daughter of judge William Sides, justice of the peace in Spanish Fort during the Trail days and good friend of Enid Justin, a saddle maker/bootmaker who built a business in Spanish Fort providing saddle repairs and boots to the drovers pushing cattle up the trail, which was the founding of the Justin Boot Company. I painted this from a study I did of Texas cattleman Nelson Story, who in 1866 drove the first large herd of Texas longhornsfrom central Texas to the Gallatin Valley, Montana, a dsitance of almost 1700 miles!\n\nBig Horn Moon\n\n12 x 16 oil on linen\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI painted this from a day study, a dayturne, that I am fond of. I really enjoy reinterpreting things in the mystery and timelessness of the night.\n\nStudy, Nelson Story\n\n12 x 16 oil on linen\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nNelson Story, a Texas cattleman, drove the first herd of Texas longhorns over the Bozeman Trail into present day Bozeman, Montana. in 1866. After being stopped by Kansas jayhawkers near Baxter Springs, Kansas, he trailed west to Fort Leavenworth and on into Wyoming. Having first trail-blazed to Montana in 1863, Nelson had to avoid the US Army's not allowing him to proceed north from Fort Phil Kearney because of Indian hostilities. He accomplished this by sneaking his men and herd away at night, hurrying to get across the Tongue River. Constantly avoiding and skirmishing with Lakota warriors under Red Cloud, he eventually reached the Gallatin Valley in Montana.\n\nWe the People\n\n40 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\ncomposition for an Approaching Storm\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\n​\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nAnother just completed piece, this time I am after an allegorical piece about the West I grew up with and the West I find today. I could speak maudlin with a mushy egocentric story right about now, or perhaps I should leave the painting open to the free associations of viewers of the work. Yes, I believe in the latter, for the experiences of each of our individual lives lead to many different and wonderful story lines. If you don't mind sharing them, I'd appreciate it, or if not, thanks and enjoy!\n\n​\n\n​Rising With Still Water and Riders\n\n48\" x 36\" oli on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI just finished this piece. I am attempting to portray an \"eternal\" moment, when the tyranny of time seems briefly stopped and the beauty of the moment endures towards an eternity. I am sure many of you understand and/or have experienced such moments. The splash in the water is a very important compositional element of the painting as its location is where both vertical and horizontal divisions…\n\n​\n\nStorm Rider, Study\n\n22 x 30 oil on canvas\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI repeatedly paint stampede type paintings as I believe them a perfect symbol for our hectic 21st century lives.\n\nLone Star with Lilacs, I only Came to Learn\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\n​\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\nHanging out down in Texas. I met a three fingered fiddle player named Orville Bess, who invited me to his place in the little town of Sunset, Texas. This is just about all there is or was to Sunset, yet it holds a dear spot in my heart from the lessons in humility and a fondness for \"small\" places I learned on this dusty road. Lilacs are one of the few plant species that survive on abandoned farms, ranches and homesteads out on the dry western plains after these habitations have been abandoned, some for many decades. AS if an obituary where written with aromatic forgiveness.\n\n​\n\nDAYS OF ARTHUR\n\n24 x 30 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nSpending time in the Big Horn, Sheridan, Wyoming area, I was struck by the many wooded watersheds, often brushy and treed. It reminded me of my youth when I am my cousins spent hours on horseback, riding and playing in similar wooded and watered areas. One of our favorite games was to play \"King Arthur\", pretending to be the Knights of the Round Table, fighting dragons, evil knights and other such troublemakers. WE scurried across the countryside horseback on such adventures, having sword fights and generally slaying all we would encounter. My uncle put a stop to the realism when one afternoon he caught us joisting with long wooden poles made from split 2 x 4's, clad in in cardboard armor. \"You damn boys, are you trying to kill each other?\" was a final testament to our chivalry.\n\nLeaving that sleeping dog lie, as I traipsed around the beautiful Big Horn country, I often found myself thinking about what a great place this was to grow up in, and if fortunate enough to be mounted, what a grand place for the adventures of Arthur!\n\n​\n\nRANGERS PAUSE ON THE MEDINA\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\n​ SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nIn our romanticized worlds we imagine all kinds of excitement and adventure when imagining the life and times of the Frontier Texas Rangers. However, like most things in life, our romantic notions are often contradicted by reality. Most of a Ranger’s life was spent traveling a vast land, in all sorts of weather, lack of sleep, poor food, and your butt rubbed raw by the saddle. That is what this painting is about, the REAL moments that mostly made up a Ranger’s life…just getting to and doing the job\n\n​\n\nOff the Caprock, Ropers' Wind?\n\n18 x 24 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\nI wanted to paint something with the clear untarnished light of mid-day on the vast prairie, particularly for this show, something “truly western”. This is about as western as it gets, active horsemanship, salty cowboy skills with a rope. My grandad Coony, whose father came to Colorado trailing cattle on the Goodnight Trail, liked to joke that if you were roping something and missed, you were “catching wind”. Do you get the painting?\n\n​\n\nStemming the Bad Tide\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​​\n\nI return again and again to the theme of a cattle stampede. I like the symbolism it represents for today's twenty first century life, so hectic and chaotic, particularly with the dilemma of coronavirus pandemic threatening our lives.\n\nI never witnessed a cattle stampede, although once, as a boy, my horse and I were dropped off in a large canyon pasture that I was unfamiliar with, our job to find missing cattle and drive them somewhere south to a set of branding corrals. By the time I found the cattle and gathered them up it was almost dark, and a large thunderstorm was blowing up out of the south. I really didn't know where the corrals were except somewhere to the south. The storm looked much like I have painted it here in this painting. The little quarter horse mare I was riding had been used to work cattle in this country, so I let her have her head, pushing the cattle in the direction she wanted to go. Finally through the wind and rain I spotted pickup headlights that were directing me towards the pens.\n\nMy Grandad later told me I did well to let the horse use its instinct to find the corrals, as in the old days cowhands would rely on \"horse sense\" to survive a night time stampede. Those thoughts never left me, and perhaps maybe that is a small reason why I am so attracted to painting stampedes today.\n\n​\n\nThough Time Deals a Tough Hand, An Old Man on Horseback Once Knew their Names\n\n18 x 24 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nWhen my grandad first came to Colorado as a young boy, his father ran a livery barn on the Santa Fe Trail where the non existant town of Amity once stood near the Arkansas river. They also free ranged cattle on the vast open prairies north of the irrigation canals that had just been finished. Later, before World War One, this open prairie was partially settled by homesteaders wishing to cash in on the Great Wheat Boom of the early 1900's. After the War, the wheat prices fell, and combined with the Depression and Dust bowl, every one of these homesteads were abandoned. As a boy my grandfather and I would roam this vast, unfarmed and uninhabited country, hunting coyotes and listening to my Grandad's stories about the \"old days\" of a once unbroken prairie. We would stop by the ruins of some homesteader's dreams, and Grandad would talk about who once lived here, when they came, and when they disappeared, perhaps even relating stories about the people who once lived here. He was always kind of wistful and sad as he shared these revelations. Now today, as I am becoming an old man, I understand the sadness Grandad felt when visiting these places from the past. I understand better the poignant nature of looking back far into the past, realizing you are ghost walking, and those days of yore have long passed on the river of time, never to return. That is what the painting is about, and of my coming of age.\n\nWhen the Fences Rise, What Pastures Be Mine\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\nA year ago I was invited by the Brinton Museum to stay out on a ranch west of Sheridan, WY and generate ideas for paintings. South of the ranchhouse I was staying in was a lone tree on a grassy rolling hillside. Behind the fence and to the side of it were \"bob\" wire fences, the tree being at the intersection of them. I was drawn again and again to walk out in the pasture and just watch this tree, and the many different interplays of light that shone upon it. I also thought a lot about fences, their symbolism and what they represent to many of us. One afternoon I watched a rain storm move in off the Big Horn Mountains, the light brilliant on the hillside, the southern sky moody with dark storm clouds, as if an onslaught of inevitable fate. I thought about the Lakota and Cheyenne peoples who once called this home, before the fences drove them into a different kind of existence. I thought about myself, and the predicaments most all humans find themselves in...how we get \"fenced\" and driven to circumstances not of our choosing, never sure what pastures we finally call home\n\n​\n\n​THE RUSTLERS WERE ON US, COME THE LAST OF JULY\n\n40 x 30 oil on canvas\n\n​\n\navailable thru Insight Gallery, Fredericksburg, TX\n\n​\n\nStudy in the Big Horn Country\n\n5 x 7 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nI spent ten days summer a year ago making studies for this show. I developed a lot of ideas for paintings and finally narrowed it down to six paintings. I liked this small study so much I am including it in the show. It is also the inspiration for the larger piece \"Big Horn Moon\".\n\n​\n\nThe Watchman, Ken the Kid\n\n18 x 24 oil on linen\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nThe American West yet today, despite it being the twenty first century, is still filled with legendary western characters. One such character is a good ole' New Mexico fella by the name of Ken Schuster. Ken is the director of the magnificent Brinton Museum near Big Horn, Wy. The \"Brinton\" is an architectural masterpiece containing world class collections of Western Art and Native American items, set on the breathtakingly beautiful Quarter Cirlce A Ranch, at the base of the Big Horn Mountains in northern Wyoming. Ken not only oversees the Museum, but he also keeps an \"eye\" on the many historic buildings on the ranch. Having been the guest of Ken and wife Barbara on several occasions, I recall Ken rising several times from the supper table, grabbing a flashlight and heading out to \"make sure those damn coyotes haven't broken into the hen house\"! Which is to say he keeps an eye on everything from priceless artifacts and artwork, to the many facets of chicken production. The Museum as it now exists is the product of many years of labor on Ken's part, and his undying commitment to the culture and history of the American West. He deserves commemoration in a painting....I like to think of him as \"Ken the Kid\", a truly legendary western character!\n\nStudy of Ranch House and Approaching Storm\n\n6 x 8 oil on linen\n\n​\n\nThere are many walks of life that fail to survive the changing of times. I am a former shop teacher, a near extinct dinosaur. The small family farm and ranch are near gone, as are many trades and crafts. I suppose that is the story and history of humankind, though many of us failed to see through the advancing storms of change. This reminds me of an old Lakota saying...\"our lives are like wind through the buffalo grass\".\n\n​\n\nStudy of a Rough Rider\n\n8 x 6 oil on linen\n\n​\n\navailable thru Insight Galleries, Fredericksburg, TX\n\n​\n\nI believe an image of a mounted cowboy charging at the viewer says a lot about the power of the myth of the cowboy and the \"Old West\" and its influences of modern American culture. That is why I return to this imagery again and again. I hope it inspires the viewer to examine their preconceptions about a lot things, not just the\" Cowboy Way\".\n\nStudy of a Trail Boss on a Cattle Drive\n\n6 x 8 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\nI paint a lot of things about catttle drives. The idea of travelling across the vast distances of the prairie has always interested me, as were the stories I heard as a young boy from old timers who had crossed these immense lands on horseback, with stars as a guide.\n\n​\n\nBuffalo Runners\n\n40 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nOne of my great great grandfathers, Jakob Meyer, was the first white settler in Red Willow County, in southwestern Nebraska. He supplemented he and his families’ meagre living by hunting buffalo on the Western Plains of Kansas and the Eastern Colorado Territory. He kept a journal and made maps of his hunts, which my grandfather used as a guide when he brought his family southwest into southeastern Colorado. There are many buffalo stories in my family, some about the noises and agility of Buffalo when they stampeded and ran. For instance, the big hairy beasts kept their wits about them, unlike stampeding cattle. Once my ancestor was caught diving a team and wagon when he drove head-on into a herd of stampeding buffalo. He jumped to the ground to hold his teams' head, and the buffalo herd split and swerved around him. It took thirty minutes for the running animals to pass him, the herd always staying about ten yards away from him and his team. An interesting fact about the American Buffalo, there were actually two distinct massive herds, a northern one, and a southern one. The northern herd ranged from their winter ranges along the Arkansas River to summer ranges north of the Platte rivers. The southern herd wintered on the ranges of south Texas and New Mexico, and moved north in the summer to the Smoky Hill ranges north of the Arkansas. Because these two great migrations occurred simultaneously, there was virtually no contact between the two groups, so little inter-breeding that they were each developing different genetic traits! Since “Night of the Artists” occurs at the Briscoe Museum in San Antonio, this is of course a painting of the southern herd. I verified that buffalo would stick their tongues out when running by the accounts of a Texas cowboy who practiced running down, roping and then shooting them with his pistol. In this painting I have portrayed Comanche hunters hunting with bow and lance. A good buffalo runner, or horse, was much prized, and beautifully trained.​\n\n​\n\nApache Moon in Sabino Canyon\n\n24x30 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\nThe Lightness of Being\n\n30 x 40 oil on canvas\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​\n\nThe Teton Mountains near Jackson, WY, is one of the toughest \"natural\" subjects I have ever painted. I think that is because when you are standing on Antelope Flats looking at them, they don't seem real even then. I was determined to complete a painting of them even when choosing the flat light of mid day. I chose to put the Indian people in the piece to make a statement about the simplicity by which one reconcile our place in the cosmos, and our humanly predicament in the presence of reality. I am not depending on the \"cultural\" identity of Native Americans to bring power to this piece, but rather as a symbol of all humanity and the wisdom of simplicity in existence. I am mindful of a number of Shaker hyms that accomplish this as well...I hope I have contributed to this theme in an adequate fashion.\n\n​\n\nStudy; Ranger Patrol on the Guadaloupe\n\n16 x 20 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nII study the history of the Texas Rangers, and paint them a lot. I am inspired by the need Texans had for self preservation and protection from raiders and outlaws. Becuse of curious political battles that occurred in the early 1840's, the United States Federal government had little desire or incentive to protect the American citizens of Texas; it wass left up to the Texans themselves...hence the formation of the Texas Rangers. Most of a Ranger's experience had little to do with gunfights or battles, rather countless days of hard rides, poor food, and little sleep. This group, with their trusty pack mule, have stopped along the cool waters of the Guadaloupe for a brief, cautious break.\n\nGoing Home is Such a Ride\n\n9 x 12 oil on linen\n\n​\n\navailable thru Nancy Cawdrey Gallery\n\nWhitefish, MT\n\nThe title is a line from a song Dory Previn wrote many years ago. I have always admired the words, and finally got an idea in how to incorporate the concept in a painting.\n\n​Study; Bridget of the Island\n\n14 x 11 oil on linen\n\nSOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\nOff the coast of western Ireland, in Coulough Bay, lies the island Inish Fanard. Abandoned in the early 20th century, it now lies uninhabited save for the ruins of five cottages where O'Sullivan, Murphys, and O'Shea's once scratched a fishermen's living from its rocky shores. One notable inhabitant was Bridget O'Sullivan, a shenachie and mid wife, unforgotten for her great beauty, generosity, and kindness. I was told of her by her grandson, now passed Michael Lynch. The stories of her fame are more than one hundred years old, a testament to Bridget of the Island!\n\nOn McDonald Creek\n\n14 x 11 oil on linen\n\nI painted this one fine summer day while out in Glacier Park with good friend Morgan Cawdrey.\n\nWhen a Heart Finds Peace\n\n8 x 10 oil on linen\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​The Cowboy Appeared Like Goths at the Gates of Rome\n\n24 x 18 oil on linen\n\n​SOLD PRIVATE COLLECTION\n\n​The American Cowboy carries powerful symbolism...A world wide icon representing independence, courage, forthrightness and a long list of other “heroic” characteristics.
