Whether you are relocating, visiting or just someone who wants to learn more about our city, I sincerely hope you enjoy the Canteen Spirit of my home town and the many things it has to offer.\n\nStill alive and well, the Canteen Spirit began during WWII when volunteers from all across the North Platte area gathered to greet, meet and provide meals of gratitude to each and every soldier and sailor traveling on the Union Pacific Railroad to and from their military assignments. These acts of kindness have made North Platte the center of fond memories for many of our U.S. Soldiers, still today.\n\nNorth Platte holds a special place in the hearts of many, and we hope it does yours as well. With a population just shy of 24,000, we are in a unique position to offer the charm of small-town life combined with many big-city amenities. Our community is active, enjoying the many opportunities we offer through indoor and outdoor sports programs, quality schools, churches, service clubs, golf courses, and events. As you explore our city, you will find the Canteen District, a thriving downtown area filled with boutique retail experiences, a coffee shop, an ice cream parlor, and many fine restaurants. Throughout the city, youâll find large beautiful parks and scenic walking trails.\n\nNorth Platte is a growing community with a current focus on attracting new businesses, growing existing businesses, building new homes, and enhancing parks and recreation. If you are part of the community, thank you. If you are considering relocating your home or business to North Platte or simply planning a visit, please do. Here, youâll find, âNebraska Nice.â\n\nBrandon Kelliher Mayor, City of North Platte\n\nWhere the good life is better!\n\nNORTH PLATTE AREA CHAMBER & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION COMMUNITY DIRECTORY | NPArea.com | 5\n\nStatistics & Quick Information\n\n1.
