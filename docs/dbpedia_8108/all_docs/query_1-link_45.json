        "text": "The topography of the Broken O Ranch can generally be described as a Great Plains setting with strong water influences throughout. The Sun River is a significant geographical attraction as it flows from west to east through the center of the Main Ranch Unit. Much of the Ranch contains hills and valleys providing a diverse landscape. The Broken O Ranch encompasses approximately 108,571 deeded acres plus an additional 15,270 acres of State leased land and 160 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leased land.\n\nThe deeded land is generally classified as follows:\n\n85,454± Acres of Native Range and Pasture\n\n11,600± Acres of Pivot Irrigated Crop Ground\n\n6,000± Acres of Improved Pasture Ground\n\n3,000± Acres of Dryland Crop Ground\n\n2,000± Acres of Sun River Riparian Corridor\n\n1,317± Acres of Wheel-Line Irrigated Ground\n\n200± Acres of Flood Irrigated Hay Ground\n\n108,571± Total Estimated Deeded Acres\n\nThe irrigated acreage is part of existing change applications that have been submitted to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation by the Seller.\n\nThe leased land is generally classified as the following:\n\nState of Montana Lease Land\n\n14,608± Acres of NativeRange and Pasture\n\n662± Acres of Pivot Irrigated Crop Ground\n\n15,270± Total State of Montana Lease Land (4,403 AUMs)\n\nBLM Lease Land\n\n160± Acres of NativeRange and Pasture\n\n15,430± Total Leased Acres\n\nHARRIS UNIT\n\nThe Ranch is divided into two units, the Main Ranch Unit, and the Harris Unit. The Harris Unit lies about one mile due north of the Main Ranch Unit boundary. This Unit is a summer grazing pasture consisting of a native range with the following approximate acreages. These acreages and AUMs are included in, not in addition to, the above calculations.\n\nDeeded Land\n\n8,364± Acres of NativeRange and Pasture\n\nState of Montana Leased Land\n\n1,480± Acres of NativeRange and Pasture (381 AUMs)\n\nThe Harris Unit is watered from Roundup Coulee and from several springs which serve stock ponds. There are two stock wells on the Harris Unit which can serve several stock tanks and are for backup purposes only. It is utilized as one pasture for spring and summer grazing of heifer pairs.\n\nCROPLAND\n\nHalf of the approximately 3,000 acres of dryland crop ground is farmed annually with the remaining acreage summer fallowed, alternating each year. These fields are normally planted in either spring wheat or barley. The approximately 1,500 acres of dryland crop ground located on the western portion of the Ranch has historically yielded 50-bushel winter wheat or 35- to 40-bushel spring wheat. The remaining dryland crop acreage is located north of the Sun River on the west end of the Ranch and averages closer to 25- to 30-bushel yields of spring wheat. These fields are chem fallowed with the planted fields being fertilized.\n\nThe irrigated cropland and the dryland are on a three-year soil testing rotation system. This provides up-to-date information to the Agronomist and the Ranch Manager for annual crop planning, while taking into consideration fertilizer and fuel costs and the hay and grain markets. During this process, the annual farm plan is developed for the upcoming spring.\n\nNATIVE and IMPROVED PASTURES\n\nThe native range pasture land is predominantly comprised of slender wheatgrass, blue grama, June grass, and various fescues. Western wheatgrass is abundant in the majority of the higher elevation ranges.\n\nMuch of the 6,000 acres of improved pasture consist of crested wheatgrass for late spring and early summer grazing south of the highway. The steer pairs are put into these pastures in early spring to utilize the high-protein hard grasses to maximize weight gain. At this time, the bulls are brought into the pasture with the mother cows to begin the breeding cycle. Several large improved pastures south of the highway contain pubescent wheat grass which greens up in late June to early July and remains so for much of the summer.\n\nThe heifers will graze on brome and fescues of the sub-irrigated pastures until they are moved to the hard high protein grasses, predominately comprised of western wheatgrass and sainfoin, of the Harris Unit from mid-June until October.\n\nCONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ranch controls approximately 852 acres of land subject to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), in five federal contracts generating approximately $27,544.00 annually. These contracts expire in 2018 and the land subject to the contracts is currently leased to a neighboring rancher. An additional 50 acres of CRP ground is located in the Harris Unit, and the payment from this contract has annually been donated by the Seller to the State Land Trust Division of the State of Montana.\n\nThe Ranch is not eligible to receive farm subsidy funds due to its total adjusted gross income exceeding federal and state limits.\n\nThe Ranch ranks among the largest cow-calf operations in Montana, currently running about 3,500 mother cows plus about 175 bulls and about 800 replacement heifers. According to an assessment conducted on the Ranch in June 2011 by Norman C. Wheeler & Associates, the Ranch is currently rated at 5,200 Animal Units.\n\nAs with any premier commercial cattle operation, bull selection is critical and the Ranch carefully evaluates its breeding stock on an annual basis. Replacement bulls are closely assessed based on their yearling Expected Progeny Difference (EPD). The purpose of EPD is to compare the genetic merit of the animal based on specific traits – such as birth weight, weaning weight, yearling weight, milking ability, carcass “cutability,” gestation length, scrotal circumference, and pelvic area. Ultimately the bull has to have good “eye appeal.” Bulls are typically kept for six breeding years. Years of discipline in the selection of breeding stock have produced a uniform high-index cattle herd.\n\nAccording to Dan Freeman, the Ranch Manager, the history of producing high-index calves on the Ranch at weaning has commanded a premium from mid-west feeders and packers. Broken O calves historically gain 3.25 to 3.75 pounds per day, finish fast, and grade very high. The annual steer crops command top dollar and have developed a reputation for quality over the past 20 years.\n\nFirst-calf heifers typically weigh around 1,100 pounds and begin calving in early February, finishing up in late March, and typically produce calves averaging 80 pounds at birth. These heifers are synchronized to calve within the first three weeks in February. They calve in the main calving facility located along the Sun River just east of the Cattle Division where they can be closely monitored. This expansive facility is heated and contains over 100 jugs to accommodate the heifer herd during the initial calving rush in early February. Once the calf is on the ground, the pair is kept in the barn for about a day before the pairs are sexed into one of two holding lots near the barn where they are held for three to four days to ensure the new calf has taken to its mother and both are healthy.\n\nBy February 20th, any remaining un-calved heifers are split between the Freeman Barn and the New Barn Calving Facilities to be put in with the older cows as they begin the calving process. The average birth weight of the calves from the older cows typically runs about 80 to 90 pounds. As the remaining heifers calve out, they are then trucked back to the Main Calving Barn to be sexed and put with the other first-calf heifers. The older cows have historically calved out in lots near each of the calving facilities.\n\nAt birth, all calves are inoculated with Vitamin A and tagged. Once calving wraps up and the pairs are sexed, the steer pairs are turned out south of Highway 21 to the high-protein improved pastures and native grasses. They continually move to the east-southeast through the deeded and state lease lands until they end up at the Pick Hammer Unit located at the very south end of the Ranch to utilize the best hard grass for the most efficient gain. The heifer pairs graze the sub-irrigated pastures north of the Sun River and are moved from the pastures west to east and eventually to the Harris Unit. By mid-May, the bulls are turned out with the cow herd to begin the breeding cycle.\n\nCalves are weaned in late October and given a preconditioning and an eight-way shot. The 2011 weaned steer calves averaged 682 pounds. In 2011 the heifer calves averaged 630 pounds. Steers are shipped immediately after weaning to commercial feedlots in Nebraska. The heifer calves are weaned directly from the Harris Unit and trucked to the Ranch feedlot. The replacement heifers will go through three separate culls until the final herd of heifers to be bred is established in late March.\n\nAfter weaning, cattle graze the dormant grass and alfalfa stands left from the summer. Most years, winter feeding of the cattle herd does not begin until late December or early January with the first cutting of alfalfa hay fed up to calving time, dependent upon weather. In this part of Montana, producers typically like to keep about 2.50 tons of hay per cow in the stack to get their cattle through the end of April. However, the Ranch historically feeds between 2.0 and 2.25 tons per cow. A 22% protein ration (SmartLic® supplements) is only used with first-calf heifers and three-year-old cows through the Fall. However, the older cows are not put on a protein ration until after they calve. After calving, the cows are transitioned to second-cutting hay rations providing a higher protein content to keep them healthy and nourish the nursing calves.\n\nAfter weaning, the ten-year-old cows are sorted off from the herd and sold by private treaty. Each year the number of replacement heifers brought into the herd changes depending on dry-cull cows and sorting off the ten-year-olds. Local ranchers actively seek to purchase any remaining bred heifers to bring the strong genetic lines of the Broken O into their herds.\n\nThe Ranch currently runs about 1,100 head of their own replacement heifers which are culled down to between 700 and 800 head to be synchronized and artificially inseminated over two days in late April. Two to three heifer bulls (one bull per 35 heifers) are put in each of the heifer pens for a period of 20 days for cleaning up heifers on their second cycle that did not impregnate during the first cycle. By early June the heifers and bulls are turned out to grass. Heifer selection is a key component of continuing the high standards of the Broken O cattle herd.\n\nPASTURE UTILIZATION & STOCK WATER\n\nThe native pastures are adequately watered with numerous stock tanks and reservoirs. A main water line that pulls water out of the Company Irrigation Ditch serves a series of stock tanks reaching from the highway to the south end of the Ranch. The pump is located near the intersection of the Dry Creek drainage and Highway 21 and runs due south for approximately seven miles.\n\nSupplemental water is provided through a series of springs and wells which serve stock ponds and water tanks along with several seasonal streams. Gasoline generators power the pumps which serve a number of water tanks located in the far south pastures. The generators are monitored on a daily basis. These pumps are used for backup water only in dry years.\n\nThe pastures located at the base of Crown Butte east of the Simms Highway (Montana Highway 200) are served by stock ponds and a well.\n\nFEEDLOT OPERATION\n\nThe 3,000- to 5,000-head commercial feedlot is licensed, permitted, and in compliance with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. During the Fall of 2011, about 3,600 head were fed in this facility.\n\nWith 32 individual pens on individual waterers and concrete feed bunks, this feeding operation dwarfs many commercial feedlots. The Ranch contract feeds approximately 650 yearling bulls and about 1,500 replacement heifers on contract for several local purebred breeders in addition to Ranch heifers.\n\nCattle are typically fed a 3:1 ration with 25 large alfalfa hay bales and seven to eight large straw bales per day combined with a percentage of barley, corn, wheat, or oats – dependent upon the type of cattle in each pen. Also included in the ration are molasses and a mineral package including rumensin.\n\nThe cost of running calves in the feedlot ranges from about $0.85 per day for a grass-fed spayed heifer to about $1.50 per day for a bull calf. On average, the replacement heifers cost about $1.00 per day to run in the feedlot. These expenses increase over the course of the winter and early spring as the animal gains weight. By March, this range will increase to approximately $1.10 per day for spayed heifers, bull calves costing about $1.95 per day, and heifer calves costing about $1.30 per day, depending on the hay and grain prices. The Ranch custom-feeds three different rations for each of the three classifications of cattle.\n\nA yardage fee of $0.35 per head per day is charged for contract cattle which covers labor, electrical, manure spreading, and maintenance. The grain and hay are added to the yardage fee at whatever price the commodity is valued at that time. The feedlot has served as an additional revenue source by running hay and grain grown on the Ranch through contract confinement cattle. The only outside commodity purchased is corn for the bull calves which is contracted from South Dakota.\n\nCattle are inspected daily by the Ranch Manager or Assistant Manager to ensure proper care and to identify sick animals. Two employees manage the feedlot on a full-time basis, overseeing the feeding, maintenance, and overall management of the cattle.\n\nPRIVATE GRAZING LEASES\n\nIn 2011 there were six private verbal grazing agreements currently in place for the use of Ranch property. These leases have yet to be determined for 2012. These have historically been on a year-by-year basis and have generated additional income for the Ranch through grazing fees. They have totaled, approximately 565 cattle at an average of $18.00 per pair per month. A listing of the charge rates is available upon request.\n\nAccording to the Ranch Manager, these leases provided cash flow on a year-round basis and income diversification. The next owner is under no obligation to continue these agreements. It is the manager’s opinion that the carrying capacity of the Ranch could be increased accordingly if a new owner desires.\n\nContact Swan Land Company for details. The Ranch controls an extensive number of irrigation and stock water rights on streams, stock ponds, and wells with very good priority dates. A complete list of water rights and water rights claims controlled by the Ranch is available upon request through our Bozeman Office. In this document, water rights refer to post-1973 rights for stock, domestic or other uses that have been issued permits or certificates for use. Water rights claims refer to pre-1973 rights, including decreed rights made by the Ranch that have not been fully adjudicated by the Montana Water Court.\n\nCONTRACT STORAGE WATER\n\nThe Ranch owns the following contract water in addition to the previously decreed water rights:\n\n• 3,760.00 Acre-Feet in the Nilan Reservoir\n\n• 1,944.78 Acre-Feet in the Greenfields Irrigation District\n\n• 202.36 Acre-Feet in the Fort Shaw Irrigation District\n\nThe Ranch controls approximately 44% of the stored water in the Nilan Reservoir, located west of Augusta, which is filled by Smith and Ford Creeks. When the water leaves the reservoir, it is delivered via Smith Creek which in turn flows into Elk Creek. Nilan water is diverted from Elk Creek into the Hogan-Scheerer Ditch or can be diverted, as needed, into the Bickle-Burke, Company, or Lytle-Clemons Ditches. In addition to stored Nilan water, the Ranch has 460 acre-feet of free-flow water, which is excess water available only during spring runoff.\n\nThe Florence Canal is a distribution canal delivering Nilan Reservoir stored water to a pivot located on the south end of the Ranch near the Mott House and Calving Facility.\n\nThe Greenfields and Fort Shaw Water Projects were federally-funded Bureau of Reclamation Water Projects constructed by the Army Corp of Engineers. This expansive water project was authorized by the Secretary of the Interior in February 1906. Actual construction began on the Fort Shaw Division in May 1907, and wrapped up by late summer of 1908, with the first water flowing through the Canal in 1909. The Greenfields Division of this irrigation project began in 1913, with water flowing to irrigators in 1920.\n\nThe Floweree Canal is the Ranch’s primary distribution canal which carries previously decreed Sun River water to irrigated land lying north of the River. It also captures and delivers used/filed water from the Cutting Shed, School Section, Elbow, and Big Coulees. The Ranch controls the majority of the water in the FlowereeCanal with only one other user at the end of the canal.\n\nDOMESTIC & STOCK WATER RIGHTS\n\nAccording to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the Ranch has currently filed 27 domestic water rights and 35 stock water rights on seasonal streams, stock ponds, and wells. A complete list of the Domestic and Stock Water Rights is available upon request through our Bozeman Office.\n\nWATER RIGHT ADJUDICATION\n\nWater rights in the Sun River Basin (Basin 41K) are currently going through re-adjudication with the Montana Water Court, and as a result of that process, some water rights may be changed as to the validity, amount, priority date, place of use, and other changes the Court may decide. The Seller has made all filings currently required and will transfer the water rights as they currently stand with no warranty, as is common in real estate transactions in Montana pending completion of Montana’s general stream adjudication process. All water rights and water rights claims appurtenant to and for the benefit of the Ranch will be conveyed to the Buyer at the closing of a sale.\n\nAll of the improvements on the Ranch, including interior and perimeter fencing, are well maintained. They are very functional and reflect no large future deferred maintenance expenses.\n\nEQUIPMENT & STORAGE FACILITIES\n\nThe buildings at the Cattle and Farm Division appear to be very well-maintained and functional. Matching full-service shop facilities are located at both the Cattle and Farm Divisions complete with concrete floors, heat, 220-volt power, and large roll-up doors to accommodate large machinery. Bathrooms and break rooms are also provided at each location.\n\nEquipment storage facilities are also located in both Divisions and are adequate to serve an operation of this size and scale. Combines, tractors, semis, swathers, and balers are all stored in one of these storage facilities through the winter months.\n\nA complete inventory of the facilities will be provided to well-qualified Prospective Buyers and their agents.\n\nCATTLE HANDLING FACILITIES\n\nThe corral system and holding pens at the Cattle Division can comfortably handle in excess of 5,000 head of cattle. The Ranch utilizes a state-of-the-art tub and alley system connected to a hydraulic squeeze chute to efficiently process cattle. Pregnancy testing and branding take place at several locations throughout the Ranch. The Cattle Division facility primarily processes cattle during weaning and shipping and is utilized for any of the cattle being held in the feedlot. A 60,000-pound Fairbanks-Morse® certified beam scale serves the expansive cattle facility. Two alley systems can be run in parallel which leads to two separate loading chutes – providing for efficient loading/unloading of large numbers of cattle.\n\nEach of the three calving facilities also contains corral systems to sort and process cattle. In addition to the calving facilities and the facility at the Cattle Division, five supplemental cattle handling pens are located at various locations throughout the Ranch.\n\nA modern sale barn with seating for about 300 is located in the Cattle Division. This facility was once utilized by the Ranch for the sale of livestock. Today, this facility is primarily used by several purebred breeders whose bull calves are fed in the feedlot and sold at this barn.\n\nFEED MILL\n\nThe Feed Mill is located at the Cattle Division near the feedlot and is operated by two full-time ranch hands when running at capacity. One person operates the computer system which calculates the rations going into the feed truck. The second person runs the truck, distributing a pre-calculated feed ration and weight to each pen.\n\nFour 38,000-bushel bins feed into the Feed Mill through a series of augers and storage hoppers. Computers in the Mill calculate rations to be fed to each pen.\n\nOWNER’S HOME\n\nThe approximately 10,000 square-foot owner’s home is ensconced in a stunning setting on the Ranch, overlooking the Sun River Valley up to the breathtaking Rocky Mountain Front. The home consists of five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, a spacious office area and recreational room as well as an indoor swimming pool. The well-designed kitchen and expansive family room, which includes a wet bar, are well-suited to accommodate entertaining and large family events. Just off the kitchen is a more formal dining room that enjoys commanding views of the Ranch, plus an intimate breakfast nook area for smaller gatherings. The upstairs reading room is private and overlooks the living spaces below. The home has an attached garage that comfortably accommodates three full-size vehicles.\n\nEMPLOYEE HOUSING\n\nA complete inventory of the employee homes and mobile homes will be available to well-qualified Prospective Buyers and their agents.\n\nLike many other young adventuresome entrepreneurs in the 1800s, Daniel Flowerree left his home in Missouri in 1852 to find his fame and fortune in the gold fields of Montana. After several years of hard luck, he found his fortune in the mining claims around Helena.\n\nYoung Flowerree soon realized the abundant possibilities in the cattle industry in Montana with its vast grassy prairies and plentiful water resources. Flowerree trailed 65 head of mother cows from his home state to the grasslands of Montana. On his way through Miles City, he acquired a business partner by the name of Lowry. These two stockmen worked their way west to the Sun River Valley. It was in the early 1870s that these cattlemen purchased 1,500 head from Texas and they made their way north along the renowned Chisholm Trail. Several years later another large herd was purchased from the Oregon Territory and trailed across the Rocky Mountains to the Sun River Valley.\n\nThe Flowerree and Lowry Cattle Company was created and the town of Lowry was established on the Ranch (on the eastern edge of the current-day Broken O Ranch). The two cattle barons also bought and raised a large remuda of horses which they utilized on the Ranch and traded with other cattlemen and locals. When the Flowerree and Lowry Cattle Company was in its prime in the early 1880s, local historians claim that these cowmen were running between 25,000 and 40,000 head of cattle from Wolf Creek to the Canadian border!\n\nThe brutal winters of 1881 and 1886 set them back significantly. The hard crust and cold prevented the cattle from breaking through the snow to reach the grass underneath. Montana’s own Charles Russell made famous the winter of 1886 in his oil painting “The Last of Five Thousand.”\n\nThrough the financial trials and tribulations of the devastating winters when the majority of the cattle herd was lost, Daniel Flowerree’s son, William K. Flowerree, became a great asset to his father. With the aging of his father, William began taking over many of the ranching responsibilities. The open range was diminishing with settlers moving from the east, and the Flowerrees realized that in order to operate the size of the herd they needed, the land would need to be purchased.\n\n“…it was impossible to buy all the land necessary to run the cattle they owned. The method they used for securing the needed capital, was by organizing the ranch into a company. The organization of the ranch took place in 1892. It was then renamed the Flowerree Sheep & Horse Co.”\n\n–\n\nThe Flowerree Ranch – A Stockman’s Paradise, Jon K. Hane – Page 44\n\nThe passing of the Reclamation Act by the federal government in 1900 allowed anyone to claim land that they were able to irrigate and take out of the prairie. With the plentiful supply of water from the Sun River flowing through the Ranch, young William saw this as a superb opportunity to acquire additional lands to run cattle, but more importantly, land to grow hay crops in order to avoid the devastating losses of the 1881 and 1886 winters. William was soon put in charge of building a canal to irrigate the vast prairie lands north of the Sun River. With slips and over 150 men, it took three years to complete the main ditch.\n\n“The actual acreage acquired, and put under irrigation, was 16,000 acres. Another 20,000 acres were used for range land in the surrounding country, making a total of 36,000 acres.”\n\n–\n\nThe Flowerree Ranch – A Stockman’s Paradise, Jon K. Hane – Page 45.\n\nThe Ranch flourished for nearly 45 years before it eventually fell on hard times and was sold at a sheriff’s sale on the courthouse steps to the Teton Land Company. With new management, the Ranch once again became the largest cattle ranch in Teton County. The Texas longhorns brought to Montana by Flowerree were replaced with English Hereford cattle which were better acclimated to the climate of the Rocky Mountain Front.\n\n“Some of the place names or sub-ranch houses, of the Teton Land Company, are the “Soldiers Home,” the “Red Shed”, the “New Barn” and the “Grimes Place.””\n\n–\n\nThe Flowerree Ranch – A Stockman’s Paradise, Jon K. Hane – Page 49.\n\nIn 1944, Teton Land Company was sold to John Hamilton. Under Hamilton, several ranch buildings were updated and bathrooms were installed in many of the bunkhouses. Additional croplands were established and irrigated increasing the production of the Ranch.\n\nWilliam and Desiree Moore, founders of the Kelly-Moore™ Paint Company, first came to the Sun River Valley in 1988 and purchased the Hamilton Ranch and, soon thereafter, the Freeman Ranch – constituting the core of the Broken O Ranch. Over the course of the next 20 years, the Moores continued to purchase and block land resulting in the present-day configuration.\n\nThe Moores quickly realized their need for a competent and trustworthy individual to not only manage his assets but one who was well respected in the community. With the acquisition of the Freeman Ranch, they found Dan Freeman. Freeman’s family had operated a commercial cattle operation along the Sun River since 1948. Dan Freeman has been an integral part of the Moore Family and the development of the Broken O.\n\nThe Ranch and lifestyle that Montana offered quickly became William Moore’s passion. He would spend weeks on end there entertaining friends and riding with his close friend, Dan Freeman. Freeman recalls spending many days riding in his pickup with Moore, answering questions ranging from irrigation head gates and barley crops to their breeding program for the upcoming year.\n\nWilliam Moore was a hands-on owner who wanted to be knowledgeable about not only the operation of the Ranch but the lifestyle that surrounded it. He spent countless hours reading and studying to increase his knowledge base in agricultural production. Freeman comments that Bill “…was still jumping ditches at 70 years of age.” A life-long innovator, he constantly challenged Freeman and his crew to find better and more efficient ways of operation and was always the first to provide the necessary tools for success. William Moore was a very unassuming man and took tremendous pride in his cattle and the stewardship of the land and its resources.\n\nWith all the changes throughout the history of the Sun River Valley, the integrity, productivity, and attraction to the area have remained unchanged for those pioneering spirits similar to young Daniel Flowerree.\n\nControlling approximately 20 miles on both sides of the Sun River creates a virtual private fishing reserve within the confines of the Ranch. Continuous pool and riffle fishing make it difficult for drift boats to put in upstream of the Ranch and float this stretch in a day, other than during high water. Sporty browns and rainbow trout thrive in the deep pools and feed in the riffles, generating good numbers of large fish.\n\nThe Sun River originates in the renowned Bob Marshall Wilderness and flows for a little over five miles before reaching the Gibson Reservoir. The Gibson Dam regulates the River, providing consistent flows through most of the summer months. The Gibson Reservoir and Diversion Lake are located northwest of the Ranch on the Sun River. These reservoirs contain rainbow and brook trout and Arctic grayling. Pishkun and Willow Creek Reservoirs, also in the Sun River drainage, offer the angler opportunities to catch “trophy” trout and pike, as well as Kokanee salmon. After coursing through the Ranch, the Sun River continues southeast where it joins the Missouri River at Great Falls.\n\nLowry Lake is a spring-fed private lake located just north of the Cattle Division on the Ranch. The Lake is approximately one mile long and is stocked with Kamloops trout. The Lake and the Sun River provide outstanding waterfowl hunting with the location of the Ranch situated along the western edge of the Central Flyway. Along the River corridor are extensive spring-fed wetlands combined with a plethora of small streams that feed into the Sun River creating a prime habitat for waterfowl, upland game birds, and other wildlife. In the heat of July and August, Lowry Lake is also a great location for jet skiing or boating.\n\nSignificant populations of Hungarian partridge, pheasant, and sharp-tailed grouse are observed throughout the Ranch. The irrigated grain fields through the core of the Ranch provide a readily accessible food source. The lush riparian habitat along the River and other tributary streams combined with the grain crops and cover greatly enhances the quality and numbers of wildlife which is apparent through the abundant numbers of whitetail, mule deer, and antelope scattered throughout.\n\nFor the employees of the Ranch, there is an incentive program offered for a buck drawing. The Ranch allows for seven buck permits to be drawn annually. Any employee, with proper hunting tags, who has been working for the Ranch for ten or more years, is automatically allowed to hunt each year; all other employees wishing to hunt for bucks are handled by the drawing process through the Ranch. Employees can also hunt whitetail and mule deer on the Ranch during the season.\n\nPublic hunting has been allowed through permission only. Typically, two to three hunters per day are allowed on certain portions of the Ranch to hunt whitetail and mule deer. The Ranch is located in Hunting District 444. For specific regulations and additional information please refer to the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks website at www.fwp.mt.gov.\n\nA waterfowl hunting and fishing lease is currently in place with a personal friend of William E. Moore. The lease is limited to waterfowl hunting and fishing in the stocked ponds and the River. The lease includes using one of the ranch houses, and the total annual income from the lease is $10,200.00."
