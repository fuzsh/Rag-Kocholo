Background and Need for the Legislation The House has assigned to the Judiciary Committee responsibility for the ``Revision and codification of the Statutes of the United States.''\\1\\ In modern practice, this responsibility entails periodically updating the United States Code (``the Code''). Currently organized in 54 titles based on subject matter, the Code contains all of the general and permanent laws of the United States. Congress created the Code in 1926 to compile federal laws into a sensible, up-to-date collection that would spare people the labor of searching for laws in the chronologically-organized volumes of the Statutes at Large.\\2\\ To date, 27 of these 54 titles have been enacted into ``positive law,'' which means the text of these titles is itself the law,\\3\\ while the remaining titles are ``non- positive,'' meaning that they organize federal statutes for users' convenience, but do not themselves have the force of law.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\Clause 1(l)(17) of House Rule X. \\2\\The Statutes at Large is the collection of laws passed in a particular session of Congress, arranged in sequence by public law number, https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/ publications/statutes.html. The content of the Statutes at Large is considered ``legal evidence of laws, concurrent resolutions, treaties, international agreements other than treaties, proclamations by the President, and proposed or ratified amendments to the Constitution of the United States therein contained, in all the courts of the United States, the several States, and the Territories and insular possessions of the United States.'' 1 U.S.C. Sec. 112. \\3\\For example, H.R. 2694 (117th Congress) proposes amending Title 18 (``Crimes and Criminal Procedure''), which is a positive title of the U.S. Code, so it is drafted to directly amend a provision of that title (``Section 4285 of title 18, United States Code, is amended in the first sentence. . . .''). The content of positive-law Code titles is considered ``legal evidence of the laws therein contained, in all the courts of the United States, the several States, and the Territories and insular possessions of the United States.'' 1 U.S.C. Sec. 204. \\4\\For example, H.R. 2922 (117th Congress) proposes amending section 101(b) of the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, which is compiled in Title 34 (``Crime Control and Law Enforcement''), a non- positive title of the Code. In this situation, the bill amends the underlying law and includes a parenthetical citation to its location in Title 34 as a convenience (``Section 101(b) of the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21711(b)) is amended to read . . .''). The contents of non-positive titles ``establish prima facie the laws of the United States, general and permanent in their nature, in force on the day preceding the commencement of the session following the last session the legislation of which is included.'' 1 U.S.C. Sec. 204. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The entity responsible for updating the Code as Congress passes new laws or amends existing ones is the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC).\\5\\ Established within the House of Representatives, OLRC's purpose is ``to develop and keep current an official and positive codification of the laws of the United States,'' while maintaining strict impartiality as to issues of legislative policy.\\6\\ The Judiciary Committee plays an essential role in two of OLRC's important functions. OLRC is required: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\Office of the Law Revision Counsel (hereinafter OLRC), U.S. Code, home page, https://uscode.house.gov/. \\6\\H. Res. 988 (93d Congress), Sec. 205(c), as enacted into law by Pub. L. 93-554 (2 U.S.C. Sec. 285a). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) To prepare, and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary one title at a time, a complete compilation, restatement, and revision of the general and permanent laws of the United States which conforms to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of the Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections both of substance and of form, separately stated, with a view to the enactment of each title as positive law. The Judiciary Committee therefore plays a key role in maintaining the accuracy of the U.S. Code. OLRC regularly submits to the Committee proposed legislation that carries out its mission to keep the Code current and correct. The Judiciary Committee then considers and reports this legislation to the House. If the legislation passes into law, OLRC implements the changes in the Code. H.R. 5695 is the result of one of the ``editorial reclassification'' efforts OLRC has undertaken in recent years to better organize the Code's non-positive titles. According to OLRC, the purpose of editorial reclassification is, ``to reorganize areas of law that have outgrown their original boundaries, or to eliminate organizational units that are no longer efficient.''\\7\\ Without altering any statutory language, OLRC relocates and rearranges provisions to make the organization of titles more logical and accessible. As a result of these editorial classifications, statutory references in other titles of the Code must also be updated. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\OLRC web site, Editorial Reclassification, https:// uscode.house.gov/editorialreclassification/reclassification.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2016, OLRC moved provisions from chapter 14 (``Miscellaneous'') in title 25 (Indians) into four new chapters toward the end of title 25. According to OLRC, this reorganization was necessary because more than 900 sections had accumulated in this chapter over years of legislating.\\8\\ OLRC also omitted provisions from chapters 14 and 19 of title 25 that were not of general application. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\OLRC web site, Editorial Reclassification, Title 25, U.S. Code, https://uscode.house.gov/editorialreclassification/t25/index.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the 115th Congress, the Judiciary Committee ordered reported a bill (sponsored by Rep. Issa) making the necessary changes to cross-references in other titles of the Code affected by this title 25 editorial reclassification.\\9\\ H.R. 5695 is an updated version of this legislation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\H.R. 5344 (115th Cong.). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hearings The Committee did not hold any hearings related to H.R. 5695. Committee Consideration On November 3, 2021, the Committee met in open session and ordered the bill, H.R. 5695, favorably reported without an amendment, by a voice vote, a quorum being present. Committee Votes No roll call votes occurred during the Committee's consideration of H.R. 5695. Committee Oversight Findings In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of House Rule XIII, the Committee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of House Rule X, are incorporated in the descriptive portions of this report. Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects Pursuant to clause 3(d)(1) of House Rule XIII, the Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. New Budget Authority and Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of House Rule XIII and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of House Rule XIII and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has requested but not received from the Director of Congressional Budget Office (CBO) a budgetary analysis and a cost estimate of this bill. Based on CBO's analysis of a similar bill (H.R. 3239) transmitted to the Committee on June 14, 2021, the Committee estimates that H.R. 5695 would have no effect on the federal budget. Duplication of Federal Programs Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House Rule XIII, no provision of H.R. 5695 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal government known to be duplicative of another federal program. Performance Goals and Objectives The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House Rule XIII, H.R. 5695 would help implement an editorial reclassification to portions of the United States Code, with the goal of improving and modernizing the overall organization of the Code. Advisory on Earmarks In accordance with clause 9 of House Rule XXI, H.R. 5695 does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of House Rule XXI.
