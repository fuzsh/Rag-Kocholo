        "text": "Progress continues in January 2018, on the pool and bath house. January 13-14, construction crews set elevation staking and determined final locations for the pool and bath house. Some grading was done and the foundation and concrete pad for the bath house was prepared. Crews did additional work to shape the dirt walls of the new pool and removed small trees and old underground piping that is no longer needed.\n\nâ€‹Favorable weather conditions have allowed project manager, Kent Hanford, to continue work on site. Kent is donating his time as project manager to coordinate and oversee work on the pool, bath house, septic & leach field system, well and water infrastructure work and needed electrical upgrade for the project."
