        "text": "Membership Questions\n\nWhat is Summer membership?\n\nSummer refers to its owners and hosts as members. Simply put, we refer to hosts as members because we are an invitation-only vacation rental management company. This means that many of the owners and their properties donât qualify to join our management solution.Â\n\nDo all properties qualify for Summer membership?\n\nNot all properties qualify for Summer membership and property management. This is driven primarily by home condition, market, revenue and most importantly - our ability to maintain operational excellence for the home.\n\nIs there a minimum revenue to be considered for Summer membership?\n\nWe only consider properties that earn over $50,000 in annual revenue. We verify annual revenue in two ways. Owners can provide financial statements of past vacation rental performance or our in-house underwriting team can complete an analysis of the property.\n\nAre there locations that do not qualify for Summer membership?\n\nSummer operates homes across the entire United States. There are no clear cut markets that we do not service. Instead as part of our membership evaluation process our operations team reviews the location to understand if we can build a local team and maintain operational excellence. Weâd rather help you find a different property management company than manage a property that we wonât be able to operate to our standards.Â\n\nOnboarding Questions\n\nHow long does the onboarding process take with Summer?\n\nThe onboarding process takes 2-4 weeks with Summer to be completed. This gives us and the owner ample time to inspect the property, get it ready for guests, and get the listing live. In the event that owners need additional time to furnish or otherwise improve the property, the onboarding process can be extended.Â\n\nDoes Summer provide a smart lock?\n\nSummer does provide a smart lock. This helps us operate the home and seamlessly let guests in. While there is some upfront expense associated with the lock and some additional time to set it up, weâve found that thereâs nothing worse than a guest not being able to access the property when they arrive.Â\n\nWill Summer take updated photos of the property?\n\nIn most cases, Summer will hire a professional photographer to do a shoot at the home. This happens after the home is both cleaned and stages for photography. This helps the home stand out on vacation rental booking sites and results in better bookings overall. If the owner has really high-quality photos already for an operating short-term rental we can skip this step in the onboarding process.Â\n\nDoes Summer offer design services?\n\nSummer does offer professional design and furnishing services with our in-house design team. This is not required for homes that are already furnished and designed and is a separate service from property management. You can find more information (and before and after photos) on our page dedicated to Summer Furnishing and Design.Â\n\nCan I keep my listing and have Summer co-host the property?\n\nUnfortunately, we donât offer co-hosting services. There are a number of reasons, but the primary reason is that we havenât seen properties that are co-hosted significantly outperform the market on reviews and revenue like the properties we fully host do.Â\n\nIâd like to place a minimum rate restriction on my property, is that allowed?\n\nSimply put, yes you can. However, we donât recommend doing so, operationally we want to avoid underpricing your property because no one wins in that scenario. Our internal revenue and pricing team manages the pricing of properties and reviews it daily.Â\n\nDo I maintain utilities under my name for managed homes?\n\nYes, the property mortgage, taxes, and utilities are still your responsibility. This is because the home is still owned by you while we manage your property.Â\n\nOperational Questions\n\nHow does Summer manage vacation rentals?\n\nSummer manages vacation rentals with extreme care and attention to details. This means fast response times, consistent cleaning, and regular maintenance and inspections of the property. With rare exceptions in brand new markets, Summer has a team of both maintenance staff and dedicated employees that oversee local portfolios.Â\n\nDoes Summer have staff in my local area?\n\nAbsolutely. Summer builds strong relationships in markets that we are entering and operating in with maintenance teams, cleaners and of course dedicated local managers. Each property gets dedicated resources and attention to ensure that itâs always guest ready and well taken care of.Â\n\nCan Summer use my existing cleaners?\n\nSummer can onboard your existing cleaners, especially if you have a good ongoing relationship with them. In many cases, weâve found that existing cleaners charge much more than local competition which could result in lower overall revenue. During the onboarding process hosts are presented with local options for cleaners.\n\nHow do I know my property will be safe with guests?\n\nSummer puts a number of security measures in place at the home to monitor noise, wifi connections and during the booking process to avoid unwanted guests in the property. We also have a built in procedure for resolving any immediate guest issues involving parties, extra guests and anything else in violation of the booking and local laws and requirements.\n\nHow does Summer handle emergency situations?\n\nSummer has a number of protocols in place that weâve tested over our combined decades of management experience. These protocols are meant to de-escalate any emergencies, resolve any immediate issues for guests and hosts and take care of the home. If youâre concerned with anything in particular itâs best to discuss it with the membership team.\n\nDoes Summer cover properties with hot tubs and pools?\n\nAbsolutely! In many cases weâll even advise owners to invest in a pool or hot tub if we think there is a significant return on investment for the property.Â\n\nHow does Summer price its vacation rental properties?\n\nSummer uses a combination of dynamic pricing and individual pricing reviews. All properties are reviewed daily and aligned with any events or demand driving activities. In the event that local demand is falling pricing will be adjusted and promotions provided to have the property booked at a reasonable rate.Â\n\nDo you have Summer team members in the markets?\n\nIn most markets Summer has team members present that can be out to the property within an hour. The exception is in new markets where we are still building a presence. Summer does not onboard homes if there is no clear action plan for getting local staff during the onboarding process to oversee the home.\n\nCan I control how much you charge guests for cleaning?\n\nThis is explained in more detail below, however, we charge guests the cleaning fee that we pay. Since Summer does not earn any fees from the cleaning we are incentivized to keep the cleaning fee low.Â\n\nWho is my main point of contact?\n\nDuring the initial membership application, your primary point of contact will be the membership coordinator. After a contract is signed you will be assigned a dedicated onboarding coordinator that will help onboard your property. When your property is onboarded, the operations team provides ongoing support for any additional questions, requests or concerns that you have. Note, there are no hold times or automated messages, you can text or call our membership support team at any time.Â\n\nHow often is the home checked outside of housekeeping?\n\nThe home is regularly checked by our staff for housekeeping, routine maintenance, and amenity maintenance. We also inspect the home prior to onboarding to complete a full inventory and continue to complete inspections in order to ensure that the home is guest ready for the next booking.Â\n\nWhat does the consumables fee cover?\n\nThe consumables fee we charge is $25 per reservations. This gives us the ability to replace linens, coffee, toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, soap and a number of other consumable items in the home so that each guest gets a fresh experience.Â\n\nDo I have to pay for lightbulbs/batteries?\n\nYour light bulbs and batteries are all covered in the consumables fee that we charge with each reservation. It also includes all other consumable items at the property to ensure the home is guest ready for every reservation.\n\nFinancial Questions\n\nHow much does Summer Airbnb management cost?\n\nSummer Airbnb management fees start at 20% for hosts around the country. The final pricing you are offered is based on the location and performance of the property amongst other factors. This is based on the booking revenue without including the cleaning fees, whereas other property managers include the cleaning fee as well making it comparably lower.Â\n\nHow often do I get invoices and reporting from Summer?\n\nInvoices are provided monthly to Summer hosts which detail all of the earning and charges that took place throughout the month.Â\n\nHow does Summer calculate its fee and member revenue?\n\nSummer calculates its fee after removing the cleaning fee. This means that if you currently earn $100,000 in revenue with $10,000 in cleaning fees annually, the fee would only come out of the $90,000 in earnings. By comparison, other property managers charge a fee on the cleaning fee as well, passing on more of the cost to you.Â"
