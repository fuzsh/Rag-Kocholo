        "text": "In the final program of this fall’s “Local Lore with Bob Richard” series at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Richard will share anecdotes from throughout the history of the Hoodoo Ranch. Special guest J.D. Radakovich, current manager of the Hoodoo, will join to answer questions following the illustrated presentation.\n\nThe free talk runs from noon to 1 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 18, at the center’s Coe Auditorium. It’s the last in the four-part “Local Lore” series for this year.\n\nThe Hoodoo Ranch sits between Cody and Yellowstone National Park, bordering the Shoshone National Forest.\n\nIt’s currently owned by Hoodoo Land Holdings, which oversees real estate held by Hunt Consolidated, Inc., Hunt Realty Investments, Inc. and Hunt Oil Company.\n\nAccording to the holding company, the Hoodoo Ranch is one of the largest historical ranches in Wyoming. It was founded by A.A. Anderson, a New York scholar, soldier and artist, as well as a friend of Teddy Roosevelt and Buffalo Bill Cody. It was later expanded by Henry Coe, who was a pioneer doctor in the Dakota Territory and close friend of Roosevelt, Hoodoo Land Holdings’ website explains.\n\nWith a wealth of knowledge about Yellowstone National Park and the Cody area, Richard has a lifetime of stories to share with future generations. A lifelong Wyoming resident, his varied experiences are pure West. Richard worked at guest ranches, guided horse and hunting trips, ranched, and owned and operated Grub Steak Expeditions for 37 years, personally leading thousands of visitors from around the world on tours through Yellowstone and its ecosystem.\n\nEducated at the universities of Wyoming, Arizona, and California (Fresno), Richard has served as a teacher and school administrator, was a decorated United States Marine Corps pilot in Vietnam and, for 21 years, helped coordinate American Red Cross service and relief activities in the western United States.\n\nRichard is already planning his next series of talks, starting up again in the spring of 2022."
