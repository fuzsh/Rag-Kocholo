As a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide identifying information such as name, address, or phone number.

Please review our Privacy Policy for more details.\n\nWhy did you receive an email from our system?\n\nYou should only receive an email from our system that you recognize signing up to receive. We certify that all email addresses used in our system are opt-in names that have given us permission to send them an email. As we indicate above, Visit North Platte does not allow, nor desire, for any members or partners to use our email services to send unwanted mail or spam. If you do not recognize who sent you the message, see the next section.\n\nReporting unwanted mail as Spam\n\nIf you do not recognize who used the Visit North Platte’s service to send you a given message, you can report it as spam by sending it to Info@VisitNorthPlatte.com. We receive, investigate, catalog, and take action based on these complaints. If you are worried that we would simply \"list wash\" your address without further investigation, feel free to report the message to whatever spam reporting entity you feel most comfortable working with. Spamcop at www.spamcop.net provides an easy way to report unwanted mail as spam. You can also use your email provider's (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) \"report as spam\" mechanism to notify the ISP that the message is spam. ISPs use this information to determine good senders from bad senders, and we regularly work with ISPs to take action based on that data. Alternately, there are reputable anti-spam blacklist groups that you can work with to identify an issue and inform service providers of that issue. We work with anti-spam blacklist groups and strive to address all issues to their satisfaction.\n\nHow do I get off an email list?\n\nEach email sent through the Visit North Platte system contains a link that allows subscribers to unsubscribe from receiving emails from the sender. Each email contains an easy and automated way for you to unsubscribe. You may also change your expressed interests at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe or change your interests, simply follow the instructions at the bottom of any email. If you have received an unwanted email sent by the Visit North Platte system, please see above for options on how to manage and report an issue.\n\nWill your information ever be shared, sold or rented?\n\nWe will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information without your advance permission unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is available only to employees responsible for managing this data.\n\nIf you have any questions about Visit North Platte’s Anti-Spam Policy, please contact us at 800-955-4528, 308-534-4729, or email us at Info@VisitNorthPlatte.com.\n\nContact Information for Requests"
