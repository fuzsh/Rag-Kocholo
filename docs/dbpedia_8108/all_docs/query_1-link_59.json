It’s a difficult achievement, and our students and teachers knocked it out of the park,” Ripley said. “Winning for the fourth year is truly an honor.”\n\nRipley noted the importance of art education in developing well-rounded students. “Art education is essential for a comprehensive education. We ensure our students have access to innovative curricula and rigorous projects, which foster creative thinking and problem-solving skills,” she said.\n\nThe TAEA’s District of Distinction award is presented to schools and districts that excel in visual arts education and promote art as a vital part of the curriculum. The association’s mission includes advancing professional development, advocating for quality art education, and recognizing exceptional contributions in the field.\n\nSBISD’s rigorous art programming aligns with the Core Characteristics of a T-2-4 Ready Graduate, preparing students for academic and professional success. Ripley highlighted that the award reflects the district's dedication to a well-rounded education, one reason families choose SBISD schools for their children.\n\n“We offer students opportunities to compete at local, state, and national levels, helping them become lifelong artists and creatives.
