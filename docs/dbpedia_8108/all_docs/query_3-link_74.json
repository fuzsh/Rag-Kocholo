He has worked tirelessly to establish this rink so North Platte and all\n\nsurrounding communities can come and enjoy something to do in the colder months of the year.\n\nTyler is one of the most generous and supportive people North Platte could have!\n\nExcellent Service at an Event – Dusty Barner, Dusty Trails Spring Birding Tours\n\nDusty Trails is a premier destination for all your outdoor adventures in North Platte. He provides\n\na number of fulfilling outdoor experiences ranging from horseback riding through Buffalo Bill’s\n\noriginal ranch, to floating down the iconic North Platte River in a tank, tube, canoe, or kayak.\n\nJust a few years ago Dusty took a leap into offering an experience that was outside his expertise,\n\nspring birding tours. For 3 weeks each spring Dusty offers a variety of Sandhill Crane tours and a\n\nmorning Prairie Chicken Tour to visitors from all over the country, and beyond. He quickly\n\nbecame an expert on these birds and their behavior to give every guest an experience they\n\nwon’t forget. Beyond that, when he provides these tours, he talks about all the other great\n\nthings visitors can do and see while in North Platte. He gives them a reason to come and then\n\ngives them more reasons to stay. He is a true gem to the community and should be recognized\n\nfor it.\n\nExcellent Service within a Hotel – Craig Warneke, Best Western Plus\n\nCraig has been with Best Western Plus for the past 3 years. Within this time, Craig continuously\n\ngives his all into not only his position, but for the whole building, staff, and guests.

This group of people have not only helped create the arts\n\ncenter as a staple in downtown North Platte, they have spent the last 16 years volunteering\n\ntheir time to refurbish and restore the beautiful 1913 building, working the front desk, helping\n\nwith fundraisers, working classes, bartending, making food and fostering a love of the arts in this\n\ncommunity. Not only have they worked tirelessly for the last 16 years, without a complaint, but\n\npure vibrancy for the arts…they continue to be a part of this great facility and the arts today.\n\nTheir passion has created a home for the arts in Western Nebraska, but also a home where\n\npeople can gather, create, and communicate. Without this group, the arts would not be as alive\n\nand vibrant as it is today.\n\nHero of Tourism – Nebraska State Senator, Mike Jacobson\n\nIn his sophomore year at the Nebraska Legislature, Senator Mike Jacobson, representing the\n\n42nd District, had to dive into the deep end to protect tourism, not only for North Platte, but for\n\ntourism across the entire state. Working with local tourism professionals and the Nebraska\n\nTravel Association he helped amend four damaging bills. On the Governors demand that the\n\nNebraska Legislature reduce property tax by 40% this year, senators were looking for dollars\n\neverywhere and tourism tax dollars were a target. LB 1067 was introduced to eliminate the\n\nNebraska Inheritance Tax over the next five years and proposed using Lodging Tax funds to\n\nreplace the loss of income for the Counties. Senator Jacobson understood the devastating\n\neffect of allowing the counties to sweep tourism funds for non-tourism purposes. He worked\n\nwith the introducer of the bill to amend it to strike the use of Lodging Tax. He showed his strong\n\nleadership and persuasive skills on the floor debate to secure the vote to approve the\n\namendment. A bill that moved forward from last year’s session LB624 proposing to put the\n\nNebraska Tourism Commission back under the Department of Economic Development also\n\nmade it to the floor for debate. An amendment was proposed by the introducing Senator to add\n\ntwo seats to the Nebraska Tourism Commission, one for DED and one for the Nebraska State\n\nChamber and remove the language to put NTC back under DED. Sen. Jacobson was very vocal\n\non the floor debate about NOT moving NTC back under DED impressing the importance of\n\nkeeping the entities separate. He led debate to educate the legislative body on the importance\n\nof keeping the Commission intact and led them to maintaining the amendment. The\n\nAppropriations Committee released its mid-biennium budget, LB1413 recommended a $5\n\nmillion dollar sweep from the State Visitors Promotion Fund (NEBRASKA Tourism Commission\n\nBudget). LB1412 suggested moving that money to the Department of Economic Development\n\n“for a statewide marketing campaign”. Sen. Jacobson (North Platte) filed an amendment to\n\nstrike the provision of the Committee Amendment that sweeps the tourism funds and\n\nsuccessfully stopped the sweep. Senator was quoted “I introduced a floor amendment to stop\n\nthe transfer, which was ultimately successful. These funds are very important to attract more instate and out-of-state travelers to visit attractions throughout Nebraska.\n\nMany of these attractions are located in District 42: Nebraskaland Days, the U.S. Highway 2 Scenic Byway, and the Nebraska Passport Program, to name a few.” District 42 is lucky to have a representative who can see the whole picture and is fighting for tourism as hard as he is. This is why Senator Mike Jacobson is a pure Hero of Tourism!\n\nThis year also included the first ever Lifetime Achievement Award presented to David Fudge, the\n\noutgoing Executive Director of NEBRASKAland DAYS. David has been with NEBRASKAland DAYS since 2005. After his term as a board member, he was hired as the Executive Director.\n\nDavid has helped grow the celebration tremendously with bringing in huge-name Acts. David has volunteered for many different organizations including the North Platte Planning Commission, Ambassadors, Quality Growth Fund review committee,\n\nNorth Platte Public School Foundation, and is also very active in his church. The list could go on and on."
