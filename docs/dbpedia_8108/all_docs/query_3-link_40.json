Ensure agricultural resources and assistance for producers are broadly accessible, while creating new, more, and better market opportunities so USDA policies and programs advance agriculture for all who want to participate, not just a few, promoting rural prosperity and economic security.\n\nPromote rural prosperity. Promote prosperity and economic security in rural communities by empowering people with modern infrastructure, connecting business owners to new opportunities for growth, and supporting community-driven solutions to build brighter futures in rural America.\n\nPromote nutrition security. Promote nutrition security and health equity through USDA nutrition assistance programs to ensure all Americans have access to the nutrition they need.\n\nBroaden access to forest resources and outdoor experiences. Ensure equitable access to forest resources, funding opportunities, and outdoor experiences; and target wildfire prevention and conservation investments where they are most needed.\n\nAdvance equity in federal procurement by providing underserved and disadvantaged businesses tools and resources to increase access to funding opportunities and by helping promote safe and secure provision of services and supplies.\n\nEmpower tribal sovereignty. Empower tribal sovereignty and uphold treaty responsibilities to Indian tribes, removing barriers to access USDA programs and incorporating indigenous values and perspectives in program design and delivery.\n\nProtect civil rights. Commit unwaveringly to civil rights by improving tools, skills, capacity, and processes to more effectively and efficiently enforce them.\n\n1. Reduce administrative, economic, historical, and other barriers to program access, and ensuring our programs include processes to observe, understand, and remove or mitigate such barriers. #ReduceBarriers\n\n2. Partner with trusted technical assistance providers to ensure that underserved producers and communities have the support they need to access USDA programs. #Partner\n\n3. Direct USDA programs to those who need them the most. #MeetNeeds\n\n4. Operate transparently and accountably, providing the information on Department programs that Congress, stakeholders, and the general public need to hold us to account on our equity agenda, and working systematically to collect and take account of public feedback. #Transparency\n\nProgress\n\nUSDA’s commitment to equity spans the Department’s mission areas and agencies. This page shares some of the progress since 2021. For more information view USDA's Equity Action Plans.\n\n1. Broaden access to agricultural programs.

In July 2024, USDA announced their investment of $90 million in 53 Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) projects, which support the development of new tools, approaches, practices and technologies to further natural resource conservation on private lands. These CIG projects address climate change, with a particular focus on innovative solutions to reduce livestock emissions of enteric methane, a potent greenhouse gas. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is awarding more than $69.7 million for CIG On-Farm Trials projects and more than $20.2 million for CIG Classic projects.\n\nExpanding USDA Regional Food Business Centers and Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI). In May of 2023, USDA announced 12 organizations that will be new USDA Regional Food Business Centers. USDA’s North Central Regional Food Business Center announced in June 2024 $600,000 awarded in Business Builder grants to provide financial assistance for small and mid-sized farm and food businesses. The funding is being awarded to 15 projects across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.\n\n#MRP #AMS\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nExpanding equitable efforts to prevent and reduce food loss and waste. In September 2023, the Department invested $25 million to expand efforts to prevent and reduce food loss and waste. The investment, funded under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), is part of a joint agency initiative between USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist (OCE). In June 2024 USDA announced the National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics as part of President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to tackle climate change, feed people, address environmental justice, and promote a circular economy.\n\n#REE #NIFA #OCE\n\n#Partner #MeetNeeds\n\nImproving safe, healthy work environments for farmworkers. Building on learnings from listening sessions coordinated in 2022, USDA announced that agricultural employers can begin to apply for the Farm Labor Stabilization and Protection Pilot Program (FLSP Program) starting in September of 2023. In June 2024 USDA announced $50 million to 141 awardees in 40 states and Puerto Rico, through FLSP, reaching 177 unique agricultural operations and over 11,000 workers. The awards will help improve the resiliency of the U.S. food supply chain by addressing agriculture labor challenges and instability, strengthen protections for farmworkers, and expand legal pathways for labor migration. This program delivers on a commitment made as part of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection and furthers the Administration’s commitment to a regional approach to migration in the hemisphere.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nProgressing towards fair, competitive, and transparent markets. In May 2023, USDA published a fact sheet addressing efforts taken by the Department to address competition issues in agricultural markets in response to the 2021 Biden Administration’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition in America’s Economy.\n\n#MRP #AMS\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nIn May 2024, USDA announced an investment in domestic fertilizer projects to strengthen competition for U.S. farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers.\n\nLaunching an unprecedented multibillion-dollar investment plan to directly incentivize competition in food processing and fertilizer, creating more market opportunities and input options for producers.\n\nReinvigorating USDA’s century-old fair and competitive market laws with new rules and enforcement to counter unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive practices and empower producers and growers.\n\nSupporting transparency.\n\nCreating a fairer market for seeds and other agricultural inputs.\n\nEnhancing value-added market access.\n\nPromoting competition in transportation networks that producers depend on.\n\nIn June 2024, USDA announced next steps it is proposing to address the many, complex competition issues in agricultural markets and create a fairer playing field for poultry growers and farmers. USDA is proposing the rule Poultry Grower Payment Systems and Capital Improvement Systems, to address a range of abuses that have occurred in relation to grower ranking (commonly known as “tournament”) payment systems and additional capital investment requirements that poultry companies commonly ask of their contract growers for broiler chicken. This rule is the third in a suite of Packers and Stockyards Act rules that USDA has undertaken to create fairer markets, which ultimately can lead to lower grocery prices for hardworking families. USDA is also announcing new publicly available cattle market transparency tools. These and previous actions are intended to enhance transparency, stop retaliation and discrimination, reduce costs, and support market fairness in a range of circumstances, furthering the Department’s efforts as part of President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy.\n\nUnder President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in America’s Economy and as set out in our competition report, USDA has led a whole-of-USDA and partaken in a whole-of-government initiative to improve the competitive landscape in food and agricultural markets. With landmark investments, new rules and enforcement, and a wide-ranging realignment of policies, the Biden-Harris USDA has brought meaningful, lasting change and delivered on its commitment to fair and competitive markets that serve the interests of working family consumers and the American farmer alike.\n\nIn July 2024, USDA announced that they are making investments that will strengthen American food supply chains, increase independent meat and poultry processing capacity, create more, new and better markets for producers, and lower food costs. Thanks to funding from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, USDA is investing nearly $110 million through the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program (MPPEP) and the Local Meat Capacity (Local MCap) Grant Program.\n\nEquitable Conservation Guidebook Funded by NRCS partnership. NRCS in partnership with the Soil and Water Conservation Society (SWCS) proudly announced the release of a groundbreaking guidebook titled \"A Conservation Professionals' Guide to Diverse, Equitable, and Inclusive Conservation Delivery with Historically Underserved Producers and Communities.\" The guidebook, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), serves as a resource for conservation professionals and policymakers to understand the barriers historically underserved communities face in implementing conservation practices and how to equitably address these barriers to provide community-led conservation technical assistance that meets the specific needs of historically underserved producers and communities. #Meetneeds #NRCS\n\nUSDA Seeks Members for Federal Advisory Committee for Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production. (USDA) announced it is seeking nominations for four positions on the Federal Advisory Committee for Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production. USDA will accept nominations from May 7, 2024, to July 7, 2024. The 12-member Committee, which first convened in March 2022, is part of USDA’s efforts to increase support for urban agriculture and innovative production. Members of the Committee provide input on policy development and help identify barriers to urban agriculture as USDA works to promote urban farming and the economic opportunities it provides in cities across the country. Learn more at www.usda.gov/urban. #UrbanAgriculture #UAFAC\n\nInvesting in veteran farmers and ranchers. USDA announced approximately $22.3 million available to community-based and nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and Tribal entities that help underserved and veteran farmers and ranchers own and operate successful farms. Funding is made through USDA’s 2501 Program. 2501 Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA’s outreach efforts to underserved communities. Connecting agricultural producers to USDA programs and services through training and technical assistance. Since 2010, the 2501 Program has continued to increase access to USDA’s programs and services and awarded 615 grants totaling more than $194 million. #2501 #Veterans\n\nStrengthening farms with clean energy. In April 2024, USDA announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is funding more than 700 clean energy projects to lower energy bills, expand access to domestic biofuels and create jobs and new market opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers. Many of the projects are funded by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the nation’s largest-ever investment in combating the climate crisis. In all, USDA is providing $238 million in funding through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP).\n\n#RD #MeetsNeeds\n\nSimplifying the direct farm loan application process. In April 2024, USDA unveiled a new, online Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) Decision Tool and farm loan resources available to agricultural producers and cooperators who help producers access USDA disaster assistance, farm loans and other federal farm programs. The new LIP tool and the farm loan informational video resources were developed in partnership with FarmRaise and USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA). These tools are now available at www.farmraise.com/usda-fsa.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nExpanding funding for participation in voluntary conservation programs and adopting climate-smart practices. In September 2023, the Department announced more than $3 billion available for agricultural producers and forest landowners nationwide to participate in voluntary conservation programs and adopt climate-smart practices in fiscal year 2024 as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. In April 2024, USDA made $1.5 billion available to help farmers advance conservation and climate-smart agriculture. This investment in partner-driven conservation and climate solutions is through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). These projects will help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners adopt and expand conservation strategies to enhance natural resources while tackling the climate crisis and will in turn can save farmers money, create new revenue streams, and increase productivity.\n\n#FPAC #NRCS\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nStrengthening local and regional food systems. In October 2023, USDA awarded more than $32 million for 98 grant projects to expand and strengthen local and regional food systems and increase the availability of locally grown agricultural products. The funding will be distributed through the Local Agriculture Market Program’s (LAMP) Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Programs (FMLFPP) and the Regional Food System Partnerships (RFSP) grant program. These projects will support the development, coordination and expansion of direct producer-to-consumer marketing, local and regional food markets and enterprises and value-added agricultural products. Additionally in February 2024, USDA announced the availability of approximately $26 million for the Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) to help local and regional food entities develop, coordinate, and expand producer-to-consumer marketing, local and regional food markets, and local food enterprises.\n\n#MRP #AMS\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nTraining future conservation leaders on climate-smart agriculture. In February 2024, USDA announced a new effort to train the next generation of conservation and climate leaders. As part of President Biden’s historic American Climate Corps initiative, the Working Lands Climate Corps will provide technical training and career pathway opportunities for young people, helping them deliver economic benefits through climate-smart agriculture solutions for farmers and ranchers across the country, now and in the future. The Working Lands Climate Corps, in its first cohort, will aim to create service opportunities for more than 100 young people. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working in partnership with AmeriCorps, The Corps Network and the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) in this effort.\n\n#FPAC #NRCS #MeetsNeeds\n\nBoosting participation in federal conservation programs. The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) Agricultural Management Assistance Program provides funding for eligible producers in sixteen states where participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program is historically low. Additionally, announced in February 2024, USDA is investing almost $1.8 million in cooperative agreements with six partner organizations for outreach and technical assistance to beginning, veteran, and socially disadvantaged producers to promote awareness and understanding of the Conservation Reserve Program-Transition Incentives Program among agricultural communities. USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers the program as an important tool to help beginning, veteran and socially disadvantaged farmers access land, as well as keep agricultural lands in production. These partnerships build on other efforts by USDA to increase equity in program delivery and broaden the reach of its programs to underserved producers.\n\n#FPAC #NRCS #MeetNeeds\n\nSharing farmer data. Announced in August 2023, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) posts data from the Census of Agriculture, with abundant information about the Nation’s farmers including a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. In February 2024, USDA released the 2022 Census of Agriculture data. Secretary Vilsack released a statement in response to the census stating the “Census of Agriculture Report underscores it’s imperative that we continue to deliver agriculture policies that create multiple streams of income and new, more competitive models for small- and mid-sized farms. Over the first three years of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States experienced the highest net farm income on record, and we’ve also seen growth in the rural population for the first time in a decade. There is more work to do to ensure we maintain strong momentum in terms of farm income, and to make sure that income is equitably distributed among farms of all sizes so more can stay in business and contribute to their local economies.”\n\n#REE #NASS #Transparency #ReduceBarriers\n\nProviding financial emergency relief to farmers and ranchers recovering from natural disaster losses. In September 2023, the Department began issuing more than $1.75 billion in emergency relief payments to eligible farmers and livestock producers to help farming and ranching operations recover following natural disasters in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Announced in February 2024, USDA is issuing final Emergency Relief Program (ERP) payments totaling approximately $306 million to eligible commodity and specialty crop producers who incurred losses due to natural disasters in 2020 and 2021.\n\n#FPAC #FSA #MeetsNeeds\n\nResponding rapidly to extreme weather events across food and agricultural systems. In FY22, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invested $3 million to create a new program priority area, Rapid Response to Extreme Weather Events Across Food and Agricultural Systems, to address emergent needs following disasters and extreme weather events. In its inaugural year, NIFA awarded funding to projects that responded to drought, wildfire, floods, and hurricanes. Projects focused on commodities and opportunities important to underserved farmers, ranchers, and communities.\n\nAnnounced in February 2024, NIFA invested $600k through the Rapid Response to Extreme Weather Events Across Food and Agriculture Systems program in response to the Maui wildfires.\n\nAnnounced in March 2024, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to aid recovery efforts for farmers, ranchers, and residents affected by recent wildfires in the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma. USDA staff are ready to respond with a variety of program flexibilities and other assistance to agricultural producers and communities in need.\n\nIn April 2024, USDA funded through the Rapid Response to Extreme Weather Events Across Food and Agriculture Systems program — an Inquiring Systems, Inc. project related to flooding incidents.\n\nAnnounced in July 2024, NIFA has funded — through the Rapid Response to Extreme Weather Events Across Food and Agriculture Systems program — two Texas A&M University projects related to wildfires.\n\n#REE #NIFA #MeetsNeeds\n\nSharing data on farms operated by socially disadvantaged, women, and limited resource farmers and ranchers. In February 2024, USDA shared a report to provide an overview of the financial characteristics of the farms operated by socially disadvantaged, women, and limited resource producers, using data from the 2017-20 annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes several groups of farmers who have been historically underserved by USDA and operates several programs and policies targeting these groups. Yet, there is limited information about the current financial health of the farms these producers operate, their credit and agricultural program use, which inhibits the measurement of progress toward more equitable outcomes.\n\n#REE #ERS #Transparency\n\nInvesting in Urban Agriculture. Historically, the lack of USDA offices and presence in urban and suburban areas and the absence of USDA farm programs that are aligned with the needs of urban and suburban agricultural producers have been barriers to access. In response, the Department has stood up the Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP), a department-wide office housed in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Additionally, the Department has invested approximately $10.7 million in the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Program and funded $30 million to a new Local and Regional Healthy Food Financing Partnership Initiative.\n\nIn 2024, USDA announced it was investing approximately $11.5 million in 38 cooperative agreements that support innovative, scalable waste management plans to reduce and divert food waste from landfills.\n\nAnnounced in February 2024, USDA is making available up to $6.1 million for grants through OUAIP to support the development of urban agriculture and innovative production projects through planning and implementation.\n\nIn May 2024, USDA announced $145,000 in funding for Turn Around Columbus, a nonprofit in Columbus, Georgia. This funding comes from a $1.5 million grant awarded to the University of Georgia’s Archway Partnership by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the new Urban County Committee pilot program.\n\n#REE #NIFA #MeetsNeeds\n\nEnsuring minority farmer and rancher participation in USDA programs. In January 2024, the Department announced its appointment of 15 additional members to the Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers (ACMF). Committee members represent socially disadvantaged farmers, nonprofit organizations, civil rights organizations or professions, and institutions of higher education. The Advisory Committee for Minority Farmers was established by Congress in the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 to ensure that underserved farmers have equal access to USDA programs. Committee members advise the Secretary of Agriculture on the administration of the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Competitive Grant Program. They also make recommendations to the Secretary on how to increase minority participation in USDA programs.\n\n#OPPE #ReduceBarriers\n\nProviding cattle producers and meat processors access to high-value beef grading. The Department announced a pilot program to allow more cattle producers and meat processors to access better markets through USDA’s official beef quality grading and certification.

Approximately 26,000 producers submit a direct loan application to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) annually, but there is a high rate of incomplete or withdrawn applications, due in part to a challenging and lengthy paper-based application process. In response, FSA implemented a simplified direct farm loan application process in February 2023, drastically reducing the burden and time spent on its forms. The agency has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nIncreasing access to NAP. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has long heard about the challenges underserved farmers have faced in navigating the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP); in January 2023, FSA announced program updates that reduce the paperwork burden on these producers to access free basic NAP coverage with a NAP service-fee waiver.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nAccomplishments 2022\n\nPromoting diversity in agricultural economics. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine reports a significant underrepresentation of minorities in science and engineering fields. In November 2022, USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) entered a new partnership with the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association to increase diversity in the field of agricultural economics. The goal is to expand the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue advanced degrees and careers in agricultural economics, supporting a new generation of skilled professionals more representative of today’s society.\n\n#REE #ERS\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nInvesting in American Rescue Plan technical assistance cooperators. Underserved farmers and ranchers have historically lacked equitable access to knowledge and information that could aid them in accessing and navigating USDA programs. USDA is helping ensure that underserved farmers, ranchers, and foresters have the tools, programs and support they need to succeed in agriculture by investing over $100 million in American Rescue Plan (ARPA) funding in over 30 organizations to provide technical assistance connecting underserved producers with USDA programs and services. So far two cohorts of organizations have been selected for their proven track records working with underserved producer communities, such as veterans, new farmers, limited resource producers, and producers living in high-poverty areas. They are providing targeted support for producers to mitigate losing lands, develop sound business plans, expand revenues and their markets, and unlock access to capital. In October 2022, USDA announced more than $71 million for the American Rescue Plan Technical Assistance Investment Program and the 2501 Program. USDA’s Office of Customer Experience worked with Cohort 1 of NIFA’s Cooperators, awardees of funding under NIFA as part of the ARP 1006, to create the USDA CARES Partner Portal, a resource designed to help our partners access the information and tools that are most relevant to their work, and to support diverse USDA customers with targeted support.\n\n#REE #NIFA\n\n#Partner #ReduceBarriers\n\nHelping distressed farm loan borrowers. Kicking off a multi-tier process under Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Section 22006 to provide assistance to distressed farm loan borrowers, the Farm Service Agency expedited assistance to borrowers whose farm operations were at financial risk, with the goal of keeping them farming and promoting their long-term stability. This work accompanies ongoing efforts to improve farm lending programs with a focus on proactive loan service and support to keep farmers farming.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#MeetNeeds #ReduceBarriers\n\nIn October 2022 the Farm Service Agency (FSA) provided nearly $800 million in assistance to delinquent direct and guaranteed farm loan borrowers and borrowers who had their farms foreclosed on and still had remaining debt.\n\nFunding 2501 program partners. Since 2010, the 2501 Program has awarded 615 grants totaling more than $194 million; 2501 Program partners provide problem-solving strategies that help underserved producers. Current grants focus on, for example, resolving heirs’ property issues, fostering financial literacy and business planning skills, and recouping losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is run by USDA’s Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement. Recent grant cohorts include:\n\n#OPPE\n\n#Partner #MeetNeeds\n\nOctober 2022: $36 million awarded to 52 organizations\n\nFunding the USDA Organic Transition Initiative. This program aims to reduce financial barriers that may stand in the way of domestic producers’ transition to organic certification. It also increases domestic access to organically produced goods and decreases reliance on foreign markets with their foreign supply chain challenges. The program launched in October 2022.\n\n#MRP #AMS\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nSharing farm lending data. In September 2022, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) posts substantial annual data about Farm Lending, including information on loan applications received, socially disadvantaged lending, beginning farmer lending, and veteran farmer lending.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#Transparency\n\nResponding rapidly to extreme weather events across food and agricultural systems. Announced in September 2022, in FY22, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invested $3 million to create a new program priority area, Rapid Response to Extreme Weather Events Across Food and Agricultural Systems, to address emergent needs following disasters and extreme weather events. In its inaugural year, NIFA awarded funding to projects that responded to drought, wildfire, floods, and hurricanes. Projects focused on commodities and opportunities important to underserved farmers, ranchers, and communities.\n\n#REE #NIFA\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nImproving safe, healthy work environments for farmworkers. In coordination with other federal agencies, in June 2022, USDA announced a pilot program utilizing up to $65 million in American Rescue Plan funding to provide support for agricultural employers in implementing robust health and safety standards to promote a safe, healthy work environment for both U.S. workers and workers hired from Northern Central American countries under the seasonal H-2A visa program. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) conducted three listening sessions in September 2022 to receive input from agricultural employer organizations, labor unions, farmworker advocates, farmworkers, and other relevant stakeholders. In September 2023, USDA announced that agricultural employers can begin to apply for the Farm Labor Stabilization and Protection Pilot Program (FLSP Program). The FLSP Program will help address current workforce needs in agriculture, reduce irregular migration, including from Northern Central America through the expansion of regular pathways, and improve working conditions for farmworkers.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nAdapting through Climate Hubs. The Climate Hubs and their partners, as part of USDA’s Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, develop locally-specific tools and resources to help build climate change adaptation capacity across the country.\n\n#REE #NIFA\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nIn January 2022, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) expanded the capacity of USDA’s Climate Hubs by investing $1.5 million in the collaborative Native Climate project, which is designed to serve as a “climate clearinghouse” of tools and technologies to support climate resilience planning and actions by Tribal agriculture producers in the Intermountain West.\n\nCollecting and distributing agricultural data. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has made technological advances in collection and distribution of important agricultural data. In January 2022, NASS launched a new respondent portal aimed at reducing the time needed for agricultural producers to complete surveys and otherwise lower barriers for responses. NASS will reach more producers, allowing them to provide data that reflects the broad diversity of America’s farmers and ranchers. Also last year, NASS conducted its first-ever livestream of the Secretary’s data report briefing. Now, several briefings are available for real-time viewing as data is being released. Livestreaming improves equitable public access to NASS’s data and increases transparency and understanding of NASS’s processes.\n\n#REE #NASS\n\n#Transparency #ReduceBarriers\n\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) incorporating feedback. APHIS takes feedback from stakeholders into account for its policy and planning processes. For example, after hearing about the need at the Black Farmers Association and Professional Agricultural Workers conferences, APHIS is improving the marketing of its Feral Swine Program to ensure underserved farmers know how to access these resources.\n\n#MRP #APHIS\n\n#Transparency #ReduceBarriers\n\nSupporting producers with disabilities. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture is currently investing $13 million in AgrAbility funds to support projects in 21 states. The program provides vital education, assistance, and support to farmers and ranchers with disabilities. Throughout its 30-year history, the program has provided direct, on-site services to more than 13,600 people.\n\n#REE #NIFA\n\n#MeetNeeds #Partner\n\nInvesting in urban agriculture. Historically, the lack of USDA offices and presence in urban and suburban areas and the absence of USDA farm programs that are aligned with the needs of urban and suburban agricultural producers have been barriers to access. In response, the Department has stood up the Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP), a department-wide office housed in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Additionally, the Department has invested approximately $10.7 million in the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Program and funded $30 million to a new Local and Regional Healthy Food Financing Partnership Initiative.\n\n#FPAC #NRCS\n\n#ReduceBarriers #MeetNeeds\n\nTo date, OUAIP has awarded approximately $55 million, including $44 million in FY2022 American Rescue Plan funding for Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production competitive grants (funding for planning and implementation projects with priority to areas lacking access to healthy, affordable food), Composting and Food Waste Reeducation cooperative agreements (funding for municipal food waste and compost projects), and the People’s Garden Initiative (funding for educational food producing gardens in 17 cities).\n\nOUAIP has been coordinating with the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and NRCS to open 17 Urban Service Centers in cities selected for pilot Urban County Committees. The Urban Service Centers will open this year and provide urban producers one convenient location where they can enroll in FSA and NRCS programs and learn about other USDA programs available to support their operations.\n\nOUAIP has been working with newly hired Urban Agriculture Coordinators at FSA and NRCS to modify programs to eliminate barriers to participation by urban and innovative producers nationwide, including by adjusting payment scenarios for use on small-scale operations, and developing new practice standards to better serve on small-scale urban agriculture operations.\n\nInvesting in Minority Serving Institutions. Numerous USDA mission areas, including Food Safety; Marketing and Regulatory Program; Trade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs; Research, Education, and Economics; and Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement are making investments in programs at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to enlarge students’ access to curriculum, internships, and training that expand career opportunities in USDA-related fields; and leverage MSIs’ ability to provide technical assistance to assist underserved and veteran farmers to own and operate successful farms.\n\n#REE #NIFA #FSIS #MRP #TFAA #OPPE\n\n#Partner #ReduceBarriers #MeetNeeds\n\nIn FY 2022, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invested $14 million in Centers of Excellence at Land-grant Historically Black Colleges and Universities, funding six collaborative research centers focused on subjects ranging from rural prosperity and climate-smart technology, to food security, health, and nutrition. These investments will strengthen research, workforce development and extension programs that support underserved producers and communities.\n\nNIFA awarded $302 million in FY 2022 to MSIs: $275 million in investments in 1890 Land-grant Universities (designated Historically Black Colleges and Universities), $19 million to Hispanic-Serving institutions, and $8.3 million to 1994 Land-grant Tribal Colleges.\n\nBoosting participation in federal conservation programs. The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) Agricultural Management Assistance Program provides funding for eligible producers in sixteen states where participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program is historically low. Producers may construct or improve water management structures or irrigation structures; plant trees for windbreaks or to improve water quality; and mitigate risk through production diversification or resource conservation practices, including soil erosion control, integrated pest management, or transition to organic farming. Applications involving projects that benefit historically underserved communities receive higher rankings.\n\n#FPAC #NRCS\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nSharing the 2022 US Agriculture Policy Review. USDA released the 2022 edition of the annual US Agriculture Policy Review series documenting developments in U.S. agricultural policies, with a focus on policies related to agricultural production, agrofood value chains, and food and nutrition assistance. This report included an introduction of the new measures and programs focused on improving equity.\n\n#FPAC #ERS\n\n#Transparency\n\nAccomplishments 2021\n\nSharing farm lending data. In September 2021, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) posts substantial annual data about Farm Lending, including information on loan applications received, socially disadvantaged lending, beginning farmer lending, and veteran farmer lending.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#Transparency\n\nAdapting through Climate Hubs. On October 7, 2021, USDA released its Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, a framework for how USDA will prepare American farmers, ranchers, and land managers for the current and anticipated impacts of climate change. The Climate Hubs and their partners develop locally-specific tools and resources to help build climate change adaptation capacity across the country.\n\n#REE #NIFA\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nHelping farmers solve succession issues. USDA has provided $67 million in competitive loans through its new Heirs’ Property Relending Program. The program, launched in July 2021, allows intermediary lenders to help agricultural producers and landowners resolve heirs’ land ownership and succession issues. Heirs’ property and other land tenure issues have long been substantial barriers preventing access to USDA programs for many producers and landowners, and this relending program provides access to capital to help producers find a resolution. The program’s benefits go far beyond its participants; it will keep farmland in farming, protect family farm legacies, and support economic viability.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#ReduceBarriers #MeetNeeds\n\nEnsuring equitable pandemic assistance.\n\n#FPAC #FSA\n\n#MeetNeeds #Partner\n\nUnder the previous administration’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), only 4 percent of funding went to socially disadvantaged farmers (among those who identified their race and/or ethnicity). After identifying gaps in previous COVID-19 relief funding, in March 2021 USDA announced Pandemic Assistance for Producers, a newly established initiative committed to distributing and directing resources more equitably, especially to the people and sectors who need assistance the most. Among other funding opportunities, the Pandemic Assistance Initiative includes re-opening signup for CFAP2; $700 million in grants to provide relief to farm and food workers affected by COVID-19; $700 million to provide relief for small producers, processors, farmers markets, and seafood vessels affected by COVID-19; and $2 million to establish partnerships with organizations to provide outreach and technical assistance to historically underserved farmers and ranchers. CFAP2 saw an approximately 21 percent increase of CFAP enrollment applications from socially disadvantaged producers. More recently, FSA announced that it would be making automatic Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2 (CFAP 2) top-up payments to underserved producers.\n\nModernizing FPAC processes. So that farmer and rancher requests take fewer steps and less time to deliver results, the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area is using new processes and technology—including expanded use of digital signatures, remote workload processing, and a centralized call center staffed with employees readily available to assist customers.\n\n#FPAC\n\n#ReduceBarriers\n\nEmpowering Minority Serving Institutions of Higher Education. In FY 2021, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administered 16 specific Minority Serving Institutions-targeted programs with over $250 million in funding. These programs include specific capacity and competitive-funding opportunities targeted for: 1890 Land-grant Universities, 1994 Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, Insular Land Grant Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n#NIFA\n\n#MeetNeeds\n\nResources\n\nThese links relate to the equity work referenced above.\n\nFarm Service Agency\n\nFarm Loans\n\nFarm Loan Assistance Tool\n\nCooperative Agreements\n\nIncreasing Land, Capital, and Market Access Program\n\nInflation Reduction Act Assistance for Distressed Borrowers\n\nNew Heirs’ Property Relending Program\n\nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture\n\nAgrAbility\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan Technical Assistance Investment Program (ARPTAIP)\n\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\n\nEquity in Conservation Outreach Cooperative Agreements\n\nOffice of Partnerships and Public Engagement\n\nUnderserved and Veteran Farmers, Ranchers, and Foresters 2501 Program\n\nRisk Management Agency\n\nCrop Insurance for Farmers and Ranchers\n\nWhole-Farm Revenue Protection\n\nRisk Management Agency Roadshow Workshops\n\n2.
