        "text": "\"Those of us fortunate enough to live in the West recognize that the West wouldn’t be the West without the wildlife that surrounds us. Unquestionably, it's one of the things that enriches our lives,\" said Gov. Mead, speaking at the start of the first regional workshop of his Chairman's Initiative for the Western Governors' Association at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyo.\n\nGov. Mead's initiative creates a mechanism for states to share best practices in species management, promote and elevate the role of states in species conservation efforts, and explore ways to improve the efficiency of the ESA.\n\n\"We need to get to a place where the Endangered Species Act can provide predictability for species, our citizens and for industry,\" said Gov. Mead, who encouraged workshop participants to set an example with its process.\n\n\"If we’re going to make improvements to the ESA, we collectively have to have the courage and the faith that people with good intentions can work together and put together something to present not only to WGA, but at the national level and Congress.\"\n\nGov. Mead also announced the locations of the next three workshops: Boise, Idaho, on Jan. 19; Oahu, Hawaii on Feb. 12, and Colorado at a date to be announced in March. Watch a video of Gov.
