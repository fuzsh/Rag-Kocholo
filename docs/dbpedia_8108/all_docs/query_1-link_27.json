PARTING WITH THE GIRL PARD. 306\n\nIt is now some generations since Josh Billings, Ned Buntline, and Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, intimate friends of Colonel William F. Cody, used to forgather in the office of Francis S. Smith, then proprietor of the New York Weekly. It was a dingy little office on Rose Street, New York, but the breath of the great outdoors stirred there when these old-timers got together. As a result of these conversations, Colonel Ingraham and Ned Buntline began to write of the adventures of Buffalo Bill for Street & Smith.\n\nColonel Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa, February 26, 1846. Before he had reached his teens, his father, Isaac Cody, with his mother and two sisters, migrated to Kansas, which at that time was little more than a wilderness.\n\nWhen the elder Cody was killed shortly afterward in the Kansas “Border War,” young Bill assumed the difficult rôle of family breadwinner. During 1860, and until the outbreak of the Civil War, Cody lived the arduous life of a pony-express rider. Cody volunteered his services as government scout and guide and served throughout the Civil War with Generals McNeil and A. J. Smith. He was a distinguished member of the Seventh Kansas Cavalry.\n\nDuring the Civil War, while riding through the streets of St. Louis, Cody rescued a frightened schoolgirl from a band of annoyers. In true romantic style, Cody and Louisa Federci, the girl, were married March 6, 1866.\n\nIn 1867 Cody was employed to furnish a specified amount of buffalo meat to the construction men at work on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It was in this period that he received the sobriquet “Buffalo Bill.”\n\nIn 1868 and for four years thereafter Colonel Cody [2] served as scout and guide in campaigns against the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians. It was General Sheridan who conferred on Cody the honor of chief of scouts of the command.\n\nAfter completing a period of service in the Nebraska legislature, Cody joined the Fifth Cavalry in 1876, and was again appointed chief of scouts.\n\nColonel Cody’s fame had reached the East long before, and a great many New Yorkers went out to see him and join in his buffalo hunts, including such men as August Belmont, James Gordon Bennett, Anson Stager, and J. G. Heckscher. In entertaining these visitors at Fort McPherson, Cody was accustomed to arrange wild-West exhibitions. In return his friends invited him to visit New York. It was upon seeing his first play in the metropolis that Cody conceived the idea of going into the show business.\n\nAssisted by Ned Buntline, novelist, and Colonel Ingraham, he started his “Wild West” show, which later developed and expanded into “A Congress of the Rough Riders of the World,” first presented at Omaha, Nebraska. In time it became a familiar yearly entertainment in the great cities of this country and Europe. Many famous personages attended the performances, and became his warm friends, including Mr. Gladstone, the Marquis of Lome, King Edward, Queen Victoria, and the Prince of Wales, now King of England.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Sioux, in 1890 and 1891, Colonel Cody served at the head of the Nebraska National Guard. In 1895 Cody took up the development of Wyoming Valley by introducing irrigation. Not long afterward he became judge advocate general of the Wyoming National Guard.\n\nColonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) died in Denver, Colorado, on January 10, 1917. His legacy to a grateful world was a large share in the development of the West, and a multitude of achievements in horsemanship, marksmanship, and endurance that will live for ages. His life will continue to be a leading example of the manliness, courage, and devotion to duty that belonged to a picturesque phase of American life now passed, like the great patriot whose career it typified, into the Great Beyond.\n\nNate Bernritter, or “Bern,” as he was usually called when not referred to as “the old man,” was in an unpleasant frame of mind.\n\nHe was superintendent in charge of the mining, milling and cyaniding at the Three-ply Gold-mine, but the cares of his official position could not wholly have accounted for the perplexed frown on his brow, the hunted look in his eyes, or the fierce, spasmodic clenching and unclenching of his big, brown hands.\n\nPacing the narrow confines of his office and chewing savagely on an unlighted cigar, he muttered to himself, over and over again, his voice a husky and hopeless whisper:\n\n“We’re at the end of our rope; McGowan has taken the one step that will put the kibosh on us. Had we better duck out of here between two days and get across the Mexican border, or stay and try and brazen the matter out?”\n\nHe stopped before a window. Leaning against the wall, he looked out dejectedly.\n\nThe “plant” of the Three-ply lay below him, in the bottom of the scarred and blistered valley.\n\nOff to the right was the bunk-house and chuck-shanty. [6] Several rods below the bunk-house was the ten-stamp mill, throbbing with the roar of the great stamps pounding out the gold. To the left of the mill were rows of big wooden tanks, where the mill “tailings” were treated with cyanid of potassium; and to the left of the tanks again, was the little adobe laboratory where the man—Jacobs by name—who had charge of the cyaniding, made his tests and did the assaying, refined mill, and cyanid bullion, and ran it into molds.\n\nTeamsters were hauling ore to the mill, miners were coming and going between the shaft-house and the blacksmith-shop, Mexicans were hovering over the tops of the cyanid-tanks, dumping into them wheelbarrow-loads of “tailings,” and everywhere was a scene of the utmost activity.\n\nBernritter’s moody eyes took no account of all the bustle and energy which spelled success for the Three-ply plant and prosperity for its owner, Patrick McGowan. Bernritter’s unofficial affairs were in a tangle, and his everlasting ruin seemed imminent.\n\nWhen men betray an employer’s trust and do evil and dishonest things, they must expect to have an uneasy conscience. But it was more than an uneasy conscience that troubled Bernritter: His fears told him that he was face to face with exposure and punishment, unless he made some move for his own safety.\n\nAs he stared absently through the window, a buxom girl of twenty strolled into his range of vision. Her sleeves were rolled up, she wore an apron, and her course was taking her from the laboratory by the tanks toward the chuck-shanty.\n\nHer name was Frieda Schlagel. As might be suspected by the name, and further guessed from her appearance, [7] she was German. Frieda and her mother did the cooking for the camp.\n\nIt was not the girl, however, who claimed Bernritter’s attention, but a man—likewise a German—who was walking beside her and awkwardly playing the gallant.\n\nThe man was a comical specimen for a lover. He looked like a fall pippin balanced on a couple of toothpicks. An “Old Country” cap rested on the back of his head, there was a long pipe in his teeth, and he wore a California poppy in his buttonhole.\n\nAs he walked, he tried to take the girl’s hand, and more than once attempted to put his arm about her ample waist. The girl, laughing the while, slapped her suitor’s face and, finally, knocked the pipe out of his mouth.\n\nThere was humor in the situation, had Bernritter been in a mood to see it. But he was not. From the herr and the fraulein the super’s eyes wandered to the laboratory, near which was secured a horse, saddled, bridled, and with saddle-bags in place.\n\nThe horse was fresh from the corral. Bernritter knew it belonged to the Dutchman, and that the Dutchman was about to leave camp, and was taking his farewell of Frieda.\n\nA glimmer shot into the super’s eye as a treacherous plan formed itself in his brain. Alert and resourceful at once, he stepped to the office door, called a passing Mexican, and told him to send Jacobs to the office immediately.\n\nWhen Jacobs—a slender man with a hint of Jewish origin in his face—entered the office, a moment later, he found Bernritter smoking his cigar and sitting in front of his desk.\n\n[8]\n\n“You sent for me?” queried Jacobs, with an odd, furtive glance of the eyes.\n\n“I did, Jacobs,” answered Bernritter. “Shut the door, pull a chair close up, and sit down.”\n\nJacobs, plainly nervous, obeyed the super’s orders.\n\n“What’s wrong?” he asked.\n\n“You know, I suppose, that McGowan is determined to find out what becomes of the bullion he has been losing.”\n\n“It is but natural,” returned Jacobs, drumming on the chair-arms with his fingers.\n\nSignificant glances passed between himself and Bernritter.\n\n“You’re running out a bar of cyanid bullion this morning, aren’t you?” queried Bernritter.\n\n“Yes,” answered Jacobs, wondering why the super had so abruptly mentioned the cyanid bullion.\n\n“Is the bar out of the mold? Is it cool enough to handle?”\n\n“It is. Why?”\n\n“I’ll tell you in a moment. Just now there is a bit of quick work for you to do. I am expecting McGowan back from Phœnix at any moment, and I am expecting that Dutchman, who has been in camp for the last few days, to pull out as soon as he can break away from Frieda. What I want you to do, Jacobs, is to take that bar of cyanid bullion and put it in the Dutchman’s saddle-bags!”\n\nJacobs sprang up excitedly.\n\n“Why——” he began, but was impatiently interrupted by Bernritter.\n\n“Put the bar of bullion in the saddle-bags, and don’t let any one see you. Then come back here and I’ll explain.”\n\n[9]\n\nJacobs’ face was now reflecting some of the alarm and fear which had been shown in the super’s. He hesitated a moment, then turned, left the office, and hastened back to the laboratory.\n\nHe was back in less than five minutes.\n\n“It is done, Bern,” he announced, in a low voice.\n\nBernritter looked toward the chuck-shanty. The Dutchman, all unsuspicious of the treachery just done him, was still talking with Frieda at the chuck-shanty door.\n\nBernritter drew a long breath of relief.\n\n“Do you know why McGowan went to Phœnix, Jacobs?” he asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, the man called Buffalo Bill is in Phœnix. Buffalo Bill is an Indian-fighter. McGowan suspects that an organized gang of Apaches, in some manner, is looting the Three-ply of its bullion. He is going to ask Buffalo Bill to help him locate the red thieves, and capture them.”\n\n“But this Buffalo Bill is employed by the government,” said Jacobs, his brown face growing pale. “He would not leave his government work to help McGowan on a job that manifestly belongs to the sheriff of the county.”\n\n“You can’t tell, any more than I can, what Buffalo Bill will do!” said Bernritter sharply. “The governor is a friend of McGowan’s, and Buffalo Bill is a friend of the governor’s. If the governor asks Buffalo Bill to do this for McGowan, the chances are that Buffalo Bill will get on the job. If he does——”\n\nBernritter ground his teeth.\n\n“What—if he does?” came from Jacobs.\n\n[10]\n\n“It’s all day with you and me, Jacobs,” finished Bernritter; “we should have to make a getaway at once, and get over into Sonora. I don’t want to leave here until we make our big clean-up. Then we can clear out with plenty of gold.”\n\nJacobs fell back in his chair and breathed hard.\n\n“What about the Dutchman?” he asked.\n\n“His name is Schnitzenhauser, isn’t it?”\n\n“Something like that.”\n\nBernritter took another look through the window. The Dutchman, whistling blithely, had left the chuck-shanty. Every once in a while he would turn around to wave his cap and throw a kiss to the plump-faced Frieda, who stood in the door.\n\nBernritter watched until Schnitzenhauser reached his horse, untied the animal from the post, and climbed into the saddle. Frieda, by that time, had vanished from the door.\n\n“There he goes,” muttered Bernritter. “Jacobs, we must plan to get the Dutchman suspected! That will carry suspicions away from us—at least, until the redskins help us make our big clean-up. Then we’ll pull out with all the gold our horses can carry.”\n\n“A good plan,” returned Jacobs, casting a wary, guilty glance around the office. “But how is it to be done?”\n\n“Listen,” said Bernritter, leaning close to his confederate and sinking his voice to a whisper.\n\nWith their heads together, the two scoundrels plotted together for several minutes; then, hearing a heavy step on the walk outside the door, they drew apart suddenly.\n\nThe door opened, and a tall, thin man with a gray [11] mustache, booted, spurred, and covered with the dust of a long ride, pushed into the office.\n\n“How are ye, lads?” cried the newcomer heartily, dropping into a chair. “Just in from Phœnix, and just sent my horse to the corral. How’s everything been going at the mine since I left?”\n\n“All right, McGowan,” answered Bernritter. “Jacobs just came to report that he has a five-pound bar from the cyanid clean-up.”\n\n“Well, for Heaven’s sake, Jacobs, take care of it,” said McGowan.\n\n“I’ll try to, sir,” smiled Jacobs, masking as well as he could the evil in his heart.\n\nHe left immediately.\n\n“What luck in Phœnix, McGowan?” asked the super, with great show of interest.\n\n“No luck at all, at all,” grumbled McGowan. “Buffalo Bill won’t help us. He says it’s a job for the sheriff, and that he has other fish to fry.”\n\nAlthough secretly delighted, Bernritter’s face contrived to express disappointment.\n\n“Did you go to the sheriff?” he asked.\n\n“Fiend take the sheriff!” growled McGowan. “Hasn’t he been out here and tried? What did he accomplish? Not a thing! The sheriff’s no good. If he attempts——”\n\nThe door was abruptly hurled open, and Jacobs showed himself. He looked wild and excited.\n\n“The bullion!” he gasped; “the bar——” He could hardly talk, and gripped at the edge of the super’s desk to hold himself upright.\n\nBernritter, apparently astounded, rose to his feet. [12] McGowan leaped at Jacobs and grabbed him by the shoulder.\n\n“What’s the matter?” demanded the super.\n\n“Speak out!” cried McGowan. “This ain’t a time to hang fire. What’s the matter with the bullion?”\n\n“It’s gone!” groaned Jacobs, dropping down in a chair beside the desk.\n\nThe superintendent and the cyanid expert were playing a game and playing it well.\n\n“Gone!” shouted McGowan. “You don’t mean to tell me that some more of my good bullion has been lifted?”\n\n“It—it was in the laboratory,” answered Jacobs, “and—and it isn’t there now.”\n\n“By the powers! Bernritter, what do you think of this?”\n\nMcGowan whirled on the super.\n\n“Why didn’t you take care of that bullion, Jacobs?” demanded Bernritter.\n\n“I did take care of it. I had just turned the bar out of the mold when you sent for me. I cooled it off and put it in the safe. When I went back to the laboratory, just now, the safe was open and the bar had disappeared.”\n\n“It must have been some of the greasers who are filling the tanks,” hazarded McGowan.\n\n“It couldn’t have been,” protested Jacobs. “The foreman told me, not more than a minute ago, that not one of them had left the work. They were all under his eyes.”\n\n“It may have been the foreman himself,” suggested Bernritter.\n\n“What!” scoffed McGowan; “Andy O’Connell? Not on your life! I’d stake all I’ve got on Andy, Jacobs,” [13] and McGowan’s eyes glittered as he wheeled on the cyanid expert, “it’s up to you to explain this.”\n\n“Do you think for a minute,” cried Jacobs, “that I’d——”\n\n“I said it is up to you to explain. What I think hasn’t anything to do with it. Did you turn off the combination of the safe when you left the laboratory?”\n\n“I—I think not,” was the hesitating response.\n\n“Fact is, McGowan,” put in Bernritter, “I sent for Jacobs in a hurry. I was figuring out the returns of the cyanid-plant, and I needed the weight and fineness of that bar to complete my figures.”\n\n“That’s no excuse,” stormed McGowan. “Jacobs should have turned the knob on that bar before ever he left the office.”\n\n“By George!”\n\nBernritter gave a jump, as though an idea had just flickered through his brain.\n\n“Well?” demanded McGowan.\n\n“That Dutchman! He had hitched his horse down by the laboratory, and he was up at the kitchen with Frieda when Jacobs came here. While Jacobs and I were talking, he went down to the laboratory and rode away. Perhaps——”\n\n“That Dutchman seemed honest enough to me,” demurred McGowan. “He has been hanging out here for several days, but we began to miss gold long before he came.”\n\n“At the mill, yes,” said Bernritter, “but this is the first bullion that has gotten away from the cyanid-plant.”\n\n“Well, I don’t believe that Dutchman had anything to do with it.”\n\n“His horse was hitched by the laboratory,” persisted [14] Bernritter. “It would have been possible for him to go into the office and take advantage of Jacobs’ absence to lift the bar.”\n\n“He was snooping around the laboratory all day yesterday,” spoke up Jacobs.\n\n“Getting the lay of things, I’ll bet something handsome,” averred Bernritter. “Did he ask you anything about the cyanid clean-up, Jacobs?”\n\n“Come to think of it,” answered Jacobs, “I believe he did.”\n\n“I thought he was too much interested in Frieda to pay attention to any one, or anything, else around this camp,” remarked McGowan.\n\n“More than likely,” suggested the super, “his fancy for Frieda was only a blind. It’s possible that he has had an eye on the cyanid bullion ever since he struck the Three-ply.”\n\n“Faith,” said McGowan, “I can size a man up pretty well, and if that Dutchman is crooked I’ll be a mightily surprised man.”\n\n“You say, Mr. McGowan,” said Jacobs, “that it is up to me to explain. Well, if that Dutchman doesn’t know anything about the bar, I can’t explain. In justice to me, sir, you ought to overhaul him on the trail, and find out whether he knows anything about the gold.”\n\nMcGowan was thoughtful for a moment.\n\n“There’s reason in that, Jacobs,” he answered. “I’ll wrong no man, if I can help it, with unjust suspicions; but, as between you and the Dutchman, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Go to the corral and get three horses.”\n\nA gleam of triumph darted into Bernritter’s eye, and was telegraphed to Jacobs, as the latter left the office.\n\n[15]\n\nMcGowan stepped to the door and made a trumpet of his hands.\n\n“Frieda!” he shouted.\n\nThe girl appeared in the door of the chuck-shanty, and McGowan motioned for her to come to the office.\n\nAn order from the “boss” was to be obeyed instantly, at all times, and Frieda hurried across the intervening stretch and came breathlessly into the room where the two men were sitting.\n\n“Vat id iss, Misder McGowan?” asked Frieda.\n\n“I’d like to have you tell me what you know about the Dutchman, Schnitzenhauser, who seems to have been tied to your apron-strings during the last few days?”\n\n“Ach, he iss a fine chentleman, I bed you!” declared Frieda.\n\n“I presume so,” said McGowan dryly. “Bedad, it looks like he’d made something of an impression on you.”\n\n“Impression, iss id? Vell, meppy; only I don’d tell him dot.”\n\nFrieda blushed, and snickered, and then grew very much confused, dropped her eyes, and pulled the edge of her apron through her plump fingers.\n\n“Where did he come from?” asked McGowan.\n\n“He say dot he come from Yuma,” was the stifled response.\n\n“Yuma!” muttered Bernritter. “Why, they have a penitentiary at Yuma. Possibly the Dutchman broke away from there and——”\n\nFrieda lifted her head quick enough, at that. Her eyes snapped, and she stamped her foot.\n\n“You t’ink he vas a chailpird, huh?” she cried fiercely. “Vell, you haf some more t’inks coming. He iss a chentleman, I tell you.”\n\n[16]\n\n“His full name is——” began McGowan, then stopped inquiringly.\n\n“Villum von Schnitzenhauser,” cried the girl, throwing back her shoulders proudly, “und he iss a baron ven he iss at home in der Faterland.” She folded her arms. “Now, I bed you,” she said, with an angry flash at the super, “you von’t say dot he iss some chailpirds! A baron! Ha! Baron von Schnitzenhauser, und a pedder man as you, Nade Pernritter.”\n\n“Baron!” sneered the super. “Bosh! That makes me think more than ever that he’s crooked.” He turned to McGowan. “The Dutchman wouldn’t tell the girl such a yarn as that if he was straight.”\n\n“Look, vonce,” cried Frieda. “He von py his pravery der orter oof der Plack Eagle, und he showed id to me. So!”\n\n“Probably his order of the Black Eagle was a tin tobacco-tag,” came sarcastically from the super. “Frieda wouldn’t know the difference.”\n\n“Iss dot so?” returned Frieda scornfully. “I don’d vas so pig a fool as I look, den. No man can fool me, und you can’t fool me, neider. I vill tell you someding else.”\n\n“What?” asked McGowan.\n\n“Der baron iss a pard oof Buffalo Pill’s!”\n\nThe girl’s pride grew to towering dimensions when she said this. Her chin went up in the air and her blue eyes gleamed like a pair of diamonds.\n\nBernritter looked startled, for a moment, then smiled disdainfully.\n\n“Another yarn, McGowan,” said he.\n\n“An interesting yarn, anyhow,” answered McGowan. [17] “Why hasn’t he said something about being a pard of Buffalo Bill’s to the rest of us?”\n\n“He say dot he stop in dis camp shust pecause oof me,” blushed Frieda, “und he don’d tell nopody else der segret oof his being pards mit Puffalo Pill.”\n\nAt that moment Jacobs arrived with the horses.\n\n“That will do, Frieda,” said McGowan. “I hope, for your sake, that the Dutchman is all he represented himself to be.”\n\nMcGowan and Bernritter went out and climbed into their waiting saddles.\n\n“Which way did the fellow go, I wonder?” muttered the super.\n\n“He took the Phœnix trail,” said McGowan. “I passed him on the road.”\n\nThe three horses were put to the gallop and the mine-owner and his assistants dashed out of the camp.\n\nFrieda watched them until they disappeared, and then went back to the chuck-shanty with something like alarm in her eyes.\n\n“Dere iss somet’ing oop,” she murmured, “und I hope dot nodding goes wrong mit Villum.”\n\nThe plot was thickening, however, and “Villum” was booked for considerable trouble.\n\nThe reader, perhaps, will have recognized the baron from the description of him already given, and will know at once that he told Frieda the truth when he said he was a pard of Buffalo Bill’s.\n\nThe baron had been sojourning at Yuma—not in the penitentiary, as Bernritter insinuated—but in one of the town’s best hotels.\n\nHe had received a telegram saying that the scout would be in Phœnix at a certain time, and he had started for Phœnix. After several days of leisurely travel, halting betimes at ranches and settlements, Fate directed the German to the Three-ply Mine.\n\nIt was the baron’s intention to halt at the Three-ply merely long enough to water his horse and himself, and inquire his most direct road to his destination. But Frieda came out to give him his directions, and the baron’s heart began to pound like a trip-hammer.\n\nInstead of asking which way he ought to go, the baron inquired if he could stay in the camp for a day or two, paying good money for his accommodation. Frau Schlagel, Frieda’s mother, kept all such money as her own perquisite, and the doughty baron was made welcome.\n\nHe stayed four days, and hung about the chuck-shanty nearly the entire time.\n\nThe baron wanted Frieda to become Mrs. Von Schnitzenhauser. [19] Frieda declined the honor, but she did it in such a way as to give the baron grounds for hope.\n\nAt any rate, the baron went off whistling “Die Wacht am Rhein,” and so pleased was he with himself, and so wrapped up in his future prospects, that he did not notice the unusual sagging of one of his saddle-bags.\n\nThe baron rode slowly. He wanted to commune with himself, and a slow pace made it easier—likewise it made it easier for McGowan, Bernritter, and Jacobs to catch up with him.\n\n“I vill meed Puffalo Pill in Phœnix,” thought the baron, “und I vill tell him how id vas. I haf peen a flying Dutchman long enough, und if Frieda vill haf me for vorse or pedder, den I vill kevit dis roaming pitzness und seddle down. I vill ged a leedle golt-mine somevere und dig goldt for a lifing, und Frieda vill take care oof der house for me, und eferyt’ing vill be schust so fine as I can’t tell. Py shinks, but I’m a lucky Dutchman!”\n\nJust then the baron heard some one yelling at him from behind. He drew rein, and turned in his saddle.\n\n“Himmelplitzen!” he muttered. “Dose fellers haf come from der Dree-ply Mine. Vone iss McGowan, who iss a pooty goot feller; und dere iss der suberintendent, who iss not so goot a feller, und Chacops, who iss vorse. Vat iss id dey vant oof me?”\n\nWhile the baron sat his horse and waited, he had a foolish thought that made his heart skip a couple of beats.\n\n“Vat oof Frieda has sent dem afder me to say dot she vill haf me, afder all?” the baron fondly asked himself. “Dot’s id, I ped you! Ach, py shimineddy, vat a luck id iss! Oof dere is anypody any blace any habbier dan vat I am, den I don’d know where!”\n\n[20]\n\nMcGowan, Bernritter, and Jacobs came alongside the baron, and stood their horses in a triangle around him. Bernritter and Jacobs had each a hand pushed suggestively under his coat, but the baron was feeling so good with himself that he did not notice these ominous movements.\n\n“How you vas, chentlemen?” cried the baron. “Vy you shace afder me like dot, hey? Meppy,” and here he gave a good-natured laugh, “you t’ink I chumped my poard-pill?”\n\n“No,” said McGowan, “we don’t think you jumped your board-bill.”\n\n“Meppy you t’ink I shtole someding?” went on the baron, shaking with mirth.\n\nMcGowan cast a startled look at Bernritter and Jacobs. That word “stole” was an unfortunate thing for the baron.\n\n“Well,” said McGowan shortly, “did you?”\n\n“Yah,” haw-hawed the baron, “you bed you I shtole someding. I shtole der heart oof dot pooty leedle Frieda, und I don’d gif id pack, neider.”\n\n“Did you take anything else?” went on McGowan, his eye on the overweighted saddle-bag.\n\n“Vell,” jested the baron, “I took my departure. Dot’s aboudt all.”\n\n“What’s the matter with that saddle-bag of yours?”\n\nThe baron looked down at the bag.\n\n“Py shinks,” he exclaimed, “id looks heafy, don’d id? I didn’t haf nodding heavy like dot in id. Der frau must haf put in a loaf oof pread ven I vasn’t looking. Vell, oof she dit, id’s my pread, anyvay. Dit you pring me some messaches from Frieda, Misder McGowan?”\n\n[21]\n\n“No.”\n\n“Und you don’d vant to dell me someding?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Den vy der tickens you shtop me like dot? Clear oudt oof der vay und I vill rite on.”\n\nThe baron had had time, by now, to observe the peculiar actions of the men from the Three-ply. As he finished speaking he tried to spur his horse ahead.\n\nJacobs, however, blocked the forward movement by grabbing the bit-rings of the baron’s horse.\n\n“You vill ged me madt in a minid,” said the baron. “Led go oof dot horse, or I vill gif you a piece oof my mind mit my fist. I don’d like dot ugly face oof yours, Chacops, und I vill put some marks all ofer id oof you don’t ged avay.”\n\nThe baron hauled back his right arm. Another moment and he found Bernritter glaring at him over the muzzle of a revolver.\n\n“No rough-house work, Dutchy,” said Bernritter.\n\nThe baron was taken aback. But only for as long as it takes to bat an eye.\n\n“Two can play at dot game!” he cried, and dropped his hand toward his belt.\n\n“Do you want me to shoot?” snarled Bernritter.\n\n“Easy, there, Schnitzenhauser,” spoke up McGowan; “I’ll have no shooting or rough work, but I want to see what you have in your saddle-bag.”\n\nAfter the way the three men had come at him, the baron would not have shown the inside of his saddle-bags for a farm.\n\n“I do vat I blease mit vat’s mine!” he shouted. “You [22] attend to my pitzness altogedder too mooch to suidt me, und dot’s all aboudt id. I’m der pard oof Puffalo Pill, undt olt Nick Nomat, und dis iss a free gountry, und I’ll do vat I vant, und nodding more.”\n\nThe baron, justly indignant, was only making matters worse for himself by refusing to reveal the contents of the bag.\n\nSuddenly something happened. The baron was the cause of it. His fist shot out—not at Jacobs, but at the wrist of Bernritter’s pistol-hand.\n\nThe six-shooter was jarred from the super’s fingers into the dust of the trail.\n\nThwack!\n\nBefore Bernritter had recovered from the daze caused by the baron’s first blow, the baron’s knuckles fell a second time—now on the super’s left ear.\n\nBernritter was knocked off his horse as clean as though he had been dropped by a rifle-bullet.\n\nWith the second blow, the baron jabbed the irons into his horse. The animal gave a mad leap forward, directly against Jacobs’ horse.\n\nThe collision was tremendous.\n\nJacobs’ horse went to the knees, and Jacobs himself turned a half-somersault out of his saddle, landing on his head and shoulders, heels in the air.\n\nThis was doing pretty well for the baron. He might have got away from the Three-ply men if McGowan hadn’t taken a hand in the set-to. Reaching out swiftly, the mine-owner twined his hands in the baron’s collar and dragged him off his horse; then, falling on him where he lay on the ground, McGowan held the luckless Dutchman in that position.\n\n[23]\n\n“Look into the saddle-bag, Bern,” cried McGowan.\n\nThe super, whose head was still ringing from the effects of the blow on the ear, had regained his feet and was saying things.\n\nWatched by McGowan, he unbuckled the straps of the saddle-bag, pushed in his hand, and drew out—the bar of yellow bullion.\n\n“Ah!” cried McGowan, his voice like the snap of a whip, “the fellow’s a scoundrel, after all!”\n\n“You might have known that, McGowan,” scowled Bernritter, “from the fight he put up to keep us from looking into the saddle-bag.”\n\n“A rope, Jacobs!” ordered McGowan. “Bedad, we’re headed for Phœnix, and we’ll keep right on to the town and land this thief in the lock-up.”\n\nThe baron, dazed by the sight of the yellow bar, was unable to say a word. He did not protest, or disavow any evil intentions, for he was so dumfounded he could not speak. His silence, of course, looked like a tacit confession of guilt.\n\nThe whole cut-and-dried affair had worked out to the baron’s disadvantage and to the benefit of the scheming scoundrels, Bernritter and Jacobs.\n\nThey had shifted the responsibility of the theft of the cyanid bullion to the Dutchman: And might not McGowan think that he was in league with the red bullion thieves who were believed to be back of the other thefts of bullion?\n\nThe sharpest criminals are short-sighted as to one or two details, in even their cleverest trickery. Bernritter had overlooked the fact that possibly the Dutchman might be a pard of Buffalo Bill’s; and, if this should prove to [24] be the case, then nothing could keep Buffalo Bill from getting into the game.\n\nThe baron, properly roped, was tied to his horse and led on across the desert in the direction of Phœnix.\n\nHe was still silent, but he was doing a lot of thinking.\n\n“What’s ther feller’s name, Buffler?”\n\n“Patrick McGowan.”\n\n“Sounds like er bit o’ th’ brogue.”\n\n“Not much of the brogue about McGowan. He’s Irish, all right, but not so you could notice it. A fine man, take him by and large, Nick, but he ran out the wrong trail when he came to me.”\n\n“What fer sort of a trail was et, Buffler?”\n\n“Going it blind on a hunt for red bullion thieves.”\n\n“Waugh! Sounds kinder good ter me.”\n\n“But it’s sheriff’s work, Nick; plain sleuthing, and nothing in sight for a strong arm. The sheriff gets paid for doing that sort of thing in this county.”\n\n“But reds! From ther way yer mouth went off, Buffler, I opined an Injun er two was tangled up in this hyar bag o’ tricks.”\n\n“McGowan has had three dreams to that effect and stands ready to bet his life that redskins are helping to do him out of his bullion.”\n\nThe king of scouts laughed. Dreams and omens, when taken seriously, always struck at the comical side of his matter-of-fact mind.\n\nHe and his trapper pard were lounging out the afternoon on the veranda of their hotel, in Phœnix. They were just in from a trying piece of work at Gray Buzzard’s Gulch, and were taking the two or three days of rest which they felt themselves entitled to.\n\n[26]\n\nThe scout had had his interview with McGowan in the early morning, and immediately afterward the disappointed mine-owner had left for his home camp.\n\nWhen Buffalo Bill mentioned “dreams,” old Nomad proceeded to take a consuming interest in McGowan’s business. The trapper believed in dreams, and in evil spirits which he called “whiskizoos,” and he was ready to bet his scalp that there were such things as spooks.\n\nThe scout’s reference to dreams likewise aroused the deep interest of another of his pards, who had been squatting on the veranda floor at a little distance, nodding in the warm sun.\n\nThis was the Piute boy, Little Cayuse.\n\nGetting up from his sitting posture, Cayuse crossed the veranda and settled down nearer the scout’s chair, where he would not miss a word of whatever else might be said.\n\nBuffalo Bill passed his eyes from Cayuse to Nomad and gave a grim smile.\n\n“It’s a queer case,” said he.\n\n“Tell us erbout et, Buffler,” said Nomad.\n\n“I’m not intending to mix up in it, mind you. We are going from here direct to Fort Apache, and report for duty to the colonel commanding.”\n\n“Waal, tell us erbout McGowan an’ his dreams, anyways.”\n\n“It’s this way, pards,” went on the scout, lighting a fresh cigar and tilting back comfortably against the wall behind him. “Patrick McGowan owns the Three-ply Mine, mill, and cyanid-plant, over in the Phœnix mountains.” The scout waved one hand toward the distant blue uplifts, visible from the veranda. “For a long time, now, McGowan has been losing gold. The ore, just before [27] it is fed to the stamps, assays one hundred dollars to the ton; when the tailings come off the mill-plates they assay six dollars to the ton. That leaves a difference of ninety-four dollars a ton which McGowan’s plates ought to catch for him; but they don’t. His mill clean-ups bring in an average of only forty-four dollars a ton. The question is, what becomes of the remaining fifty dollars a ton? It’s a conundrum that’s bothering the life out of McGowan.\n\n“They put through ten tons of ore every twenty-four hours at the Three-ply. That means that McGowan is losing five hundred dollars a day in some mysterious manner. And this has now been going on for two weeks, causing him a loss of seven thousand dollars, so far.”\n\n“Some of his millmen aire workin’ er hocus-pocus on him,” suggested Nomad.\n\n“McGowan swears that his millmen are straight. He has camped in the mill night and day and is ready to make oath that there’s nothing crooked in the mill.”\n\n“Whar do ther dreams come in?”\n\n“Well,” and the scout smiled incredulously as he spoke, “McGowan says that he dreamed, one night, he saw an Apache crawling among the cyanid-tanks. When the Apache came out into the moonlight he held up something that looked to McGowan like a bar of bullion. The next moment the Apache was whiffed out among the shadows. McGowan dreamed the same thing the next night, and the night after that. And for this reason,” laughed the scout, “McGowan believes that thieving redskins are mixed up in the thieving.”\n\n“Waugh!” grunted Nomad. “Et sounds reasonable.”\n\n“Bosh!” said the scout.\n\n“Speakin’ pussonly,” pursued old Nomad, “I’d like ter [28] dip inter ther puzzle, jest ter prove whether er not a bunch o’ reds aire really foolin’ with McGowan’s gold.”\n\n“Go out and dip in,” advised the scout. “When you get through, come on to Fort Apache. You’ll find me there, if I’m not away on business.”\n\nNomad looked startled.\n\n“Nary, pard,” said he, with emphasis. “Ye don’t find me tanglin’ up with any job in which Buffler ain’t consarned.”\n\n“Then,” returned the scout, “this bunch of warriors will hike for Fort Apache about dew-fall.”\n\n“Ain’t ye goin’ ter wait fer ther baron ter show up?”\n\n“The baron has had three days to show up. Evidently he has taken a cross-trail of some kind, and we’re not going to wait for him. If we should happen to——”\n\n“Beg yer pardon, Buffalo Bill, but I’d like a word with ye.”\n\nThe scout dropped his chair down on the veranda with a thump, and looked around.\n\nHawkins, a deputy sheriff, had come out on the veranda and was walking in the scout’s direction.\n\n“Howdy, Hawkins,” said the scout. “What can I do for you?”\n\n“The sher’f would like ter see ye at his office in the jail. Can ye come right over?”\n\n“On the jump. What’s the business about?”\n\n“About the McGowan bullion robberies.”\n\nThe scout was already on his feet, but at that he hesitated.\n\n“I told McGowan,” said he, “that I hadn’t time to bother with that matter.”\n\n“I know, an’ it ain’t expected ye’ll bother with it. All [29] you’re wanted fer is ter establish the identity o’ one o’ the thieves that has jest been brought in.”\n\n“A red thief?”\n\n“No, a white ’un.”\n\n“I don’t know why the sheriff thinks I can identity the thief.”\n\n“Ther feller claims ter be a pard o’ your’n.”\n\n“My pards are not drawn from that class.”\n\n“That’s what we all reckoned, but the feller insists that you come over an’ see him.”\n\n“I’ll go, of course,” said the scout, “but I haven’t the least idea I’ll be able to establish the thief’s identity. He’s bluffing, for some reason or other.”\n\nThe scout followed the deputy into the hotel, down the stairs, and out upon the street. Nomad and Little Cayuse trailed along behind.\n\nAcross the street was Court-house Square. The little party crossed the square, passed along a graveled walk bordered with oleanders and overhung with the branches of pepper-trees, and presently reached the court-house steps.\n\nThe sheriff’s office was in the front of the building.\n\nAs the scout and his friends entered the office they beheld a little group of men consisting of Rising, the sheriff, McGowan, the mine-owner, and two other white men, all grouped about some one who was sitting in a chair.\n\n“Hello, Cody,” called Rising, stepping forward and grasping the scout’s hand.\n\n“What have you got me over here for, Rising?” queried Buffalo Bill. “You haven’t any idea that I’m on intimate terms with a bullion thief, have you?”\n\n“I’m the one that bothered you, Buffalo Bill,” put in [30] McGowan. “It’s the thief himself that asked us to send for you. He says he’s one of your pards. What we want to do now is to prove him a liar as well as a thief.”\n\n“Puffalo Pill!” came a wail of distress from a corner chair. “Look at here, vonce!”\n\nAt the sound of this familiar voice, Buffalo muttered an exclamation and whirled around.\n\nThe baron was sitting in the corner chair, a picture of rage and injured innocence. As he spoke, he had lifted up his hands, showing the ugly manacles about his wrists.\n\n“Schnitzenhauser!” cried the scout.\n\n“Ole Weenerwurst hisself!” exclaimed Nomad; “ther ’riginal Hot Termale hisself, decorated with er pair o’ come-erlongs! Waugh!”\n\n“Ugh!” growled Little Cayuse; “heap shame!”\n\nWithout another word, Buffalo Bill walked over to the baron and caught his manacled hands in a cordial and reassuring grip.\n\n“What does this mean?” the scout demanded, turning and looking at Rising and McGowan with a glittering eye. “This man is my pard. He has told you the truth.”\n\n“But he’s a thief,” protested McGowan.\n\n“He can’t be!” declared the scout.\n\n“He was caught with the goods on. Why can’t he be?”\n\n“Because he’s Buffalo Bill’s pard!”\n\nBuffalo Bill’s words made an impression. There was no doubt on that score.\n\n“Now ye’re torkin’, Buffler!” seconded Nomad. “Before an ombray kin trot with Pard Buffler he has ter show what he is. Schnitz, thar, hes done thet same. [31] He’s a whole man, game as a hornet, an’ consequently he kain’t be er thief.”\n\n“Wuh!” agreed Little Cayuse.\n\n“Facts are facts, Buffalo Bill,” said McGowan.\n\n“Sometimes facts only seem to be facts,” answered Buffalo Bill, pulling up a chair beside the baron’s and sitting down. “So far as the truth is concerned, you might just as well have those bracelets on me, as on the baron. Tell me about this.”\n\nMcGowan pushed forward his superintendent and his cyanid expert, presenting them each in turn to the scout. Both Bernritter and Jacobs were in a tremor of apprehension, for there was that in the scout’s keen, calculating eye which seemed to probe deep into their guilty minds.\n\nMcGowan, following the introductions of his assistants, went into the matter of the cyanid bullion at length. The bar was produced in evidence.\n\n“Lastly,” finished McGowan, “your pard’s actions virtually admitted his guilt.”\n\n“How so?” asked the scout.\n\n“Why, he refused to let us examine the inside of his saddle-bags, and tried to fight us off.”\n\n“So far from proving his guilt,” declared the scout, “it goes to show his innocence. Knowing he had done nothing unlawful he denied your right to question his integrity. Any man of spirit would have fought against a dishonoring search of his person or his saddle-bags.”\n\n“How did the gold get in there, then?”\n\n“Somebody put it in.”\n\n“And that somebody,” spoke up Bernritter, with a swagger, “was the Dutchman.”\n\n“Did you see my pard put the bar into his saddle-bag, [32] Bernritter?” demanded the scout, his eyes narrowing to mere slits as he measured the superintendent.\n\n“Why, no.”\n\n“Then don’t air your ignorance. Have I heard the whole of this, McGowan?” the scout inquired, turning to the mine-owner.\n\n“Yes, you’ve got our side of it,” was the reply. “If you want to question your pard——”\n\n“I don’t,” promptly. “I know the baron too well to offer him an insult. You might dismiss your two men, McGowan,” the scout added, “and we’ll smoke a talk and see where we land.”\n\n“Go back to the Three-ply, Bern, you and Jacobs,” said McGowan, in a kindly tone. “We can’t leave the plant to run itself, you know. I’ll be along some time to-night.”\n\nBernritter and Jacobs left the office. The scout, as soon as the door closed, started up from his chair and beckoned Nomad and Cayuse apart.\n\n“Trail those two men secretly,” he ordered, “no matter where they go. Watch every move they make.”\n\n“Ye’re goin’ ter help McGowan?” asked Nomad eagerly.\n\n“That remains to be seen. However, it will make no difference with you. Do your trailing.”\n\n“Whar’ll we report?”\n\n“You’ll find me somewhere when you’re ready to report.”\n\n“Keno.”\n\nAgain the door opened and closed, this time with Nomad and Little Cayuse on the other side of it.\n\nThe scout returned to his chair.\n\n“Now that your Dutch pard’s safety is concerned, Buffalo [33] Bill,” said McGowan, “I suppose that you’ll hook-up with me and help run down those red bullion thieves?”\n\n“My pard’s safety must not enter into the question,” returned Buffalo Bill. “He’s the victim of foul play, and his liberty ought not to be imperiled for a moment.”\n\n“You bank heavy on your pards!”\n\n“I never let a man into the inner circle until I know I can bank heavy on him. I’ll admit, McGowan, that since my talk with you this morning, I am more inclined to give you my aid than I was before.”\n\nMcGowan began to expand, and to congratulate himself.\n\n“Faith, it’s your strong arm we need,” said he. “It’s a hefty fist you have, Buffalo Bill, and a sharp mind back of it.”\n\n“Thanks,” said the scout dryly. “If I did not bank a little on you, McGowan, I might suspect that this was a put-up job, of which you were fully cognizant.”\n\n“How do you mean?” flared McGowan.\n\n“Why, in order to secure my aid, you might have been tempted to implicate my Dutch pard.”\n\nMcGowan’s “Irish” was up in a moment.\n\n“If you think that——” he began angrily, but the scout smiled and stretched out a hand soothingly.\n\n“I don’t,” said he. “I’ve only seen you twice, but I’m willing to bank on your integrity. You’re the sort of a man I’d like to help.”\n\nMcGowan was entirely pacified. The king of scouts had a winning way with him, when he so desired, and that way was now much in evidence.\n\n“I’d think it an honor,” said McGowan, “to have Buffalo Bill help me.”\n\n“I’ll do it, on one consideration only.”\n\n[34]\n\n“And that is?”\n\n“That you consent to let the sheriff take those irons off my pard’s wrists. In other words, he must be a free man before I hook-up with you.”\n\n“That’s hardly according to Hoyle,” demurred McGowan, visibly worried.\n\n“It’s according to Buffalo Bill. You have my proposition. Take it or leave it.”\n\n“Why, if your pard is left in this jail and brought to trial, you’ll have to work for me in order to prove his innocence, won’t you?”\n\n“I’ll not work for you, McGowan, but I’ll work for him. You’d find that to be vastly different.”\n\n“You’d better do as the scout says, McGowan,” put in Rising. “If he’s going to help you, you’d better let him do it in his own way. Catching a man with the goods on doesn’t always prove him a thief.”\n\n“I don’t know who to suspect,” said McGowan, “if we don’t suspect the Dutchman.”\n\n“I do,” said the scout.\n\n“Who?” demanded McGowan.\n\n“Never mind that. What’s your last word?”\n\nMcGowan debated the matter with himself for a moment. Then, finally, “Take off the darbies,” he said to Rising.\n\nThe manacles were removed, and Rising shook hands with the baron.\n\n“I haf peen imbosed ubon,” said the baron, “und I feel schust like some hornets mit a shtinger oudt. Puffalo Pill iss my pard, und der pest feller vat efer vore shoe-ledder; he shtands py me, you bed you, aber I feel so madt I vant to fighdt.”\n\n[35]\n\n“Get over it,” said McGowan crustily. “You’re free. What more do you want?”\n\n“I vant dot imbression dot I’m guildy all der same remofed from your mindt,” scowled the baron. “Dot’s vot I vant!”\n\n“Then find the man that put that gold-brick in your saddle-bag.”\n\n“We’ll do it, McGowan,” spoke up the scout. “Give us a little time.”\n\n“Will you go out to supper with me, Buffalo Bill?” queried the mine-owner.\n\n“I have other business on hand, just now, McGowan.”\n\n“Anyhow, you’ll ride with me back to the Three-ply this evening?”\n\n“I’m afraid I’ll have to pass that up, too.”\n\n“But if you’re going to hook-up with me——”\n\n“You’ll hear from me and my pards, all right, and probably when you least expect it. Go back to your diggings, McGowan, and be comfortable in your mind. Take things easy, and let things drift as usual.”\n\n“All right, Buffalo Bill, if you want matters that way. But I’m depending on you.”\n\n“Then show that you have confidence in me, McGowan, by heeding instructions.”\n\nMcGowan, with a wave of the hand to those in the sheriff’s office, left the room, and the court-house. A few moments later, Buffalo Bill and the baron also left.\n\n“You’ve made a fool of yourself, baron,” said the scout, as soon as he and the Dutchman were out of the court-house.\n\n“How’s dot?” asked the bewildered baron.\n\n“A pair of blue eyes have got you locoed. They held [36] you in that Three-ply camp until the real thieves got you implicated in the bullion robberies.”\n\n“Vell, I like dot Frieda pedder as any girl vat I efer saw. Dot’s right.”\n\nThe scout laughed.\n\n“Vat’s to be done now, Puffalo Pill?”\n\n“We’ll have supper, and then we’ll ride out and camp in the vicinity of the Three-ply Mine. We can learn more by playing this game on the strict q. t. than by going about it openly.”\n\n“I’ll bed you dot feller, Pernridder, und dot odder feller, Chacops, knows more as dey vants to——”\n\n“Stow it, baron! You don’t want to throw any suspicions on men who are possibly innocent. Developments will prove who are guilty, and who are not. We’ll let events speak for themselves.”\n\nIn the hotel office the clerk halted Buffalo Bill and handed him a letter.\n\nThe letter was addressed in an unfamiliar hand, and the postmark showed it had passed through the Phœnix post-office at 4 P. M. It was then only half-past 5. The enclosed sheet bore the following:\n\nThe scout allowed the baron to spell out this warlike communication.\n\n“We have the robbers scared,” remarked the scout. [37] “Whenever a criminal tries to frighten an officer off his trail with such a letter, he proves that he’s losing his nerve. What time did you and McGowan and the other two reach Phœnix, baron?”\n\n“Aboudt haluf-bast dree.”\n\n“Did you stop anywhere on the way to the sheriff’s office?”\n\n“Ve shtopped at der bost-office. Pernridder vent in und asked for der Dree-bly mail.” The baron, putting two and two together, in his logy German way, began to grow excited. “Py shiminy! Dot sgoundrel, Pernridder, must haf mailed dot ledder ven he——”\n\n“Not so fast, baron,” warned the scout. “You’re getting ahead of developments. This is only a small piece of circumstantial evidence, and not half so convincing as finding a bar of stolen bullion in a man’s saddle-bags.”\n\nThe baron grew quiet and pensive. After supper he and the scout mounted their horses and, with several days’ rations at their saddle-cantles, rode out through the “Five Points,” then along Grand Avenue, and so into the Black Cañon trail on their way to the Three-ply.\n\nThey had not been gone half an hour when Nick Nomad came charging into the hotel with important news. His news was of vital import, and his disappointment was great when he discovered that the scout and the baron had left.\n\nBernritter and Jacobs, intent on making a big “clean-up” and a safe getaway, were drawing upon all their resources to foil Buffalo Bill and his pards.\n\nWhen the trapper and the little Piute left the sheriff’s office they were expecting immediate saddle-work; but in this Nomad, at least, was disappointed.\n\nHalting among the oleanders that bordered the gravel-walk leading from the court-house steps to the street, the trapper and the redskin saw their men in animated conversation on the corner by the hotel.\n\n“They don’t appear ter like ther way things aire goin’, Cayuse,” said the trapper.\n\n“Ugh!” said Cayuse, who thought much and said little.\n\n“Anyways, they appears ter hev made up their minds ter somethin’,” went on the trapper, a moment later. “Jacobs is goin’ off down ther street, an Bernritter is goin’ inter ther hotel. Bernritter fer you, son, an’ I’ll shadder Jacobs.”\n\n“Wuh!”\n\nOn reaching the edge of the square, Cayuse crossed in the direction of the hotel, while Nomad turned to the right and sauntered along on the side of the street opposite the one where Jacobs was walking.\n\nJacobs walked two blocks and turned in at a gambling and drinking-resort which a gold sign proclaimed to be the “El Rio.”\n\nThereupon Nomad crossed over and entered the El Rio himself.\n\n[39]\n\nIt was too early for the gamblers. The El Rio was almost deserted.\n\nA bar ran along one side of the mirrored and tinseled room, and along the other side were arranged roulette-tables, faro lay-outs, poker-tables, and other gambling paraphernalia.\n\nToward the rear, the big room merged into a three-foot corridor, on either side of which doors opened into private gambling-rooms.\n\nNomad entered the front door of the “chance” establishment just in time to see Jacobs entering a private room. It was the first room on the left, off the rear corridor. A low-browed, villainous-looking man entered the room with Jacobs.\n\nThe door closed. The trapper sauntered over to the bar and bought a cigar. Then he walked back, announced his desire for a retired place, and was shown by an attendant into the first room on the right.\n\n“Forty-rod,” said he to the waiter; “a stiff glass o’ et.”\n\nThe waiter brought the “forty-rod,” received his pay, and a generous tip, and retired.\n\nNomad had no intention of beclouding his faculties with the contents of the glass, so he left it untasted.\n\nPulling off his boots, the moment he was alone, he took them under one arm and passed noiselessly to the door of the room. With a soft hand he turned the knob and drew the door slightly ajar.\n\nNo one in the front part of the El Rio was paying any attention to the rear of the establishment. As the old trapper waited and listened, he heard a mumble of low voices coming from the room across the corridor.\n\nClosing the door from the outside as noiselessly as he [40] had opened it, Nomad crossed the aisle. His stockinged feet made scarcely a sound.\n\nLaying a quick, deft hand on the knob of the door next that through which Jacobs and his companion had passed, he pushed it ajar and stepped in. He drew a quick breath when he found the room was already occupied.\n\nA man, far gone in liquor, was lying across a table, breathing heavily.\n\nNomad wanted to be in that particular room, because only a thin board partition separated him from Jacobs and the man with whom Jacobs was talking. The drunken man, Nomad decided after a second’s observation, was too much under the “influence” to prove anything of an obstacle; so the trapper made up his mind to occupy the room with him.\n\nClosing the door as noiselessly as he had opened it, Nomad ran his eye over the board partition.\n\nThe partition was of flooring boards and painted white. The boards had warped considerably, but not enough to make any cracks.\n\nThe old man was disappointed. He wanted to “star” himself, in this queer case of McGowan’s, and felt that if he could hear something of what was being said, in the next room, the result would amply repay him for his time and trouble. Jacobs had been ordered by his employer to return to the Three-ply. He had not returned. The very fact that he had not was suspicious in itself.\n\nNomad had reasoned this all out; and he knew when Buffalo Bill told him and Cayuse to shadow Bernritter and Jacobs that the scout thought the actions of the two men open to question.\n\nWhile the trapper stood in the room surveying the [41] board partition, the mumble from the other side of it came tantalisingly to his ears. The sound was louder than when he had heard it across the corridor, but it was still impossible to distinguish words.\n\nThe snoring of the drunken man interfered with the sounds, and Nomad was ripe for some desperate move which might have spoiled everything, when his eye lit upon a knot in one of the boards of the partition.\n\nThe knot was about two feet above the floor, and was so warped from the board that it looked as though it might be easily removed. With hope mounting high, old Nomad drew a knife from his belt and sank to his knees.\n\nTiming his prying with the long and regularly recurring snores of the drunken man, Nomad got out the knot with his knife-point; then, lowering his head, and stopping one ear with his finger to keep out the snores, he was pleased to find that the talk of Jacobs and the other man could be plainly heard.\n\n“You understand that part of it, Bascomb?” Jacobs was saying.\n\n“Sure,” answered the man referred to as Bascomb. “I kin send a couple o’ light-fingered lads ter attend ter the hotel end. Now fer the rest o’ it.”\n\n“Buffalo Bill will certainly take hold and help McGowan.”\n\n“It was a bad move o’ your’n, gittin’ Buffler Bill’s pard mixed up with that thar gold-brick.”\n\n“That was Bern’s idea, but I guess he understands now the move was bad. Buffalo Bill will go to the mine by the Black Cañon trail—it’s the most direct route, and whenever he goes any place, I understand it’s the beeline and a keen jump fer him.”\n\n[42]\n\n“Us fellers are up agin’ it, all right, now that the scout has took holt. He’s the wust kind of a propersition ter flash on a lot er grafters. What’s fer me to do? I’ll skin the deck both ways ter do all I kin, Buffler Bill er no Buffler Bill.”\n\n“The mill clean-up comes to-morrow. That’s where we’re to make our big winning and skip out. Bern says to hang Buffalo Bill up to-morrow so that he can’t interfere, and we’ll be able to do our work and make a getaway.”\n\n“I’m ter help hang the scout up, hey?”\n\n“You’re to do it. As soon as you attend to the hotel part of it, make for the hills as fast as you can go, round up your reds, and lay for the scout in some convenient place on the Black Cañon trail. When you capture him, leave him in the hands of enough reds to keep him, then come on to the Three-ply and stand ready to help in running off the loot from the clean-up.”\n\n“Suppose Buffler Bill rides out ter the Three-ply with McGowan?”\n\n“Then nail the two of them. It will be so much the better for us.”\n\n“It’s a scheme fer yer life, Jacobs! Count on me. But s’posin’ Buffler Bill has already left fer the mine?”\n\n“He won’t start before supper—at least, I don’t think he will. If he does, we stand a chance to lose out, that’s all. You’ll have to run your chances.”\n\n“Is that all?”\n\n“Yes; and I can’t waste any more time here. McGowan told Bernritter and me to go right back to the mine; Bern’s gone, and I must follow as soon as I can.”\n\n“If McGowan finds out ye didn’t go with him——”\n\n[43]\n\n“Bern will take care of that, in case McGowan makes any remarks. He’ll offer an excuse by saying he had me stay a while in Phœnix to talk with our powder-men about the last lot of high-explosives. Hike out, now, and do your work. I’ll leave after a while myself. Make sure you’re not shadowed, Bascomb, and don’t let any grass grow under your feet. Bern told me to say that everything depends on you, and if we get away with forty-odd thousand in bullion, you’ll be handsomely remembered.”\n\n“Which I ort ter be. Waal, adios fer now.”\n\nNomad put back the knot carefully and got to his feet. He was astounded by what he had heard.\n\nHere, at the very start-off, was evidence of the plot against the baron, as well as evidence of a greater plot against the clean-up which was to be made on the following day at the Three-ply Mine!\n\nAnd Buffalo Bill was to be ambushed along the Black Cañon trail!\n\nNomad exulted to think that he had acquired information which, properly used, would break this far-reaching combination of bullion thieves.\n\nBut what, he asked himself, did Jacobs and Bascomb mean in their references to underhand work at the hotel?\n\nThat part of it had escaped Nomad. He felt that he had overheard enough, however, and was not disposed to find any fault because a little of the conversation had got away from him.\n\nA few minutes after Bascomb left, Nomad heard the door of the next room open and close. This was Jacobs, going out.\n\nThe trapper pulled on his boots, took a final look at [44] the drunken man—who had not stirred since his privacy had been intruded upon—and also went out.\n\nJacobs must have passed quickly through the front of the El Rio when he left the small room. Nomad could not see him, and hurried out through the front door to the sidewalk. There he caught a vanishing glimpse of his man around a corner.\n\nStill trailing, he followed until he saw Jacobs enter the gate of a corral. This was not the corral where the scout and his pards kept their own horses, and Nomad had no business in the place, and no reasonable excuse for calling there.\n\nWhile he stood watching for Jacobs to reappear, the bell of the court-house clock tolled the hour of seven. Nomad was surprised. Time had passed quickly for him since he and Cayuse had parted in front of the Court-house Square.\n\nOn the last peal of the bell, Jacobs rode out of the corral and headed east along Washington Street.\n\n“Hyar’s whar our trails fork fer a spell, you pizen whelp,” muttered Nomad. “I got ter find Buffler, an’ tell him er few things thet’ll open his eyes some. But we’ll meet-up with each other ag’in, Jacobs, ye kin gamble er blue stack on thet. Go ahead with ther preparations fer yer ‘clean-up.’ While ye’re a-doin’ of et, Buffler an’ me’ll be plannin’ er leetle clean-up of our own. What er rum game this hyar is, anyways! Bernritter an’ Jacobs plannin’ ter beat McGowan out o’ more-n forty thousand in bullion! Oh, no! I reckon I didn’t find out er thing in thet El Rio place.”\n\nNomad pointed in the direction of the hotel, swinging along at a swift stride.\n\n“An’ thar’s Injuns mixed up in et, too, jest as McGowan [45] dreamt et,” said the trapper to himself. “I wonder what Pard Buffler’ll say ter thet? You kin bet yer moccasins thar’s a hull lot in dreams, spacially ef ye dreams ther same thing three times, hand-runnin’.”\n\nNomad turned into the hotel and peered around the lobby for the scout. The scout was not in evidence, and neither was Little Cayuse.\n\nThe Piute boy, Nomad thought, was probably well away toward Three-ply, on the track of Bernritter; but Buffalo Bill—— Could it be that he also had pulled out, in company with McGowan? This notion gave the old trapper something of a jolt.\n\nWalking over to the counter, he put an inquiry to the clerk.\n\n“Buffalo Bill, Mr. Nomad?” returned the clerk, lifting his eyebrows. “Why, he went away from here half an hour ago. He rode off with a queer-looking character that I took to be a Dutchman.”\n\nThe trapper gulped wildly, and a chill of apprehension shot through him.\n\n“Any idee whar Buffler went?” he asked.\n\n“Not the slightest.”\n\nNomad turned thoughtfully away.\n\nThere could be little doubt but that Buffalo Bill had started for the Three-ply Mine. He had also secured the release of the baron and had taken him along.\n\nWhat was to be done? Just one thing—ride after the scout and the baron and overtake them before they dropped into Bascomb’s ambush.\n\nNomad started on a rush for the hotel door. At the entrance he paused, suddenly remembering that his spurs were in his room.\n\n[46]\n\nIt would take him a few minutes to get the spurs, but it would be time well spent.\n\n“Say, pard,” said he, pausing at the counter for an instant on his way to the stairs, “call up Nickerson’s corral, will ye, an’ tell Nickerson ter git ole Nomad’s hoss under saddle, muy pronto. I’m in a tearin’ hurry, an’ ef ye’ll do thet much fer me, I’ll be obliged.”\n\n“Certainly, Mr. Nomad,” answered the clerk. “Glad to do it.”\n\nNomad raced on up the stairs, pulling his key out of his pocket as he went. Unlocking the door, he flung it open and raced into the room. He did not shut the door behind him, as he had no time for any extra or unnecessary frills.\n\nHis spurs were hanging from a hook in the closet, along with his war-bag. The war-bag would not be needed; and he jerked down the spurs, unbuckled the straps that held them together, and hurried to the window.\n\nHere, where the light was better, he threw up his foot on a chair and deftly affixed one of the spurs. Putting up the other foot, he began adjusting the second spur.\n\nHe remembered putting the end of the strap through the buckle and beginning to pull. Following that, memories of every kind grew hazy and mixed.\n\nSomething landed on his head, from behind. It was a terrific blow, and the trapper lurched forward, overturned the chair, and still further injured his head by bringing it into contact with the sharp edge of the window-casing.\n\nThen it seemed to Nomad that he dropped, and then that he was floating around in the air. Little gleams danced before his eyes, resembling varicolored fire-balls, like those which are thrown by Roman candles. Then [47] night engulfed the fire-balls, and a dead silence intervened—a silence of complete oblivion.\n\nNomad opened his eyes in the dark. The first thing he heard was the court-house bell.\n\nOne, two, three—— He counted the strokes. There were nine of them. Nine o’clock! Suffering catamounts! What had happened to him since seven?\n\nThen, as his mind once more became active, he began to piece together his experiences. While he was putting on that second spur, some one must have crowded in on him through the open door and struck him from behind.\n\nFoul play, of course! But by whom? Who could have done it if not some one of the Bernritter and Jacobs outfit?\n\nThen Nomad recalled what Bascomb had said to Jacobs regarding the “hotel end” of their plotting. Was he, Nomad, the object of the hotel plot?\n\nNomad knew that he could not have been the direct object, for Jacobs and Bascomb, during their talk in the El Rio, had not known that he was on Jacobs’ trail.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, the trapper was sure that he had dropped into Bascomb’s work in the hotel. Bascomb’s light-fingered men may not have meant to get Nomad at the start-off, but they had got him, nevertheless.\n\nThe trapper’s hands and feet were bound with towels, and there was a towel tied over his mouth.\n\nWhere was he? He moved his feet around, and in this way discovered that he was in cramped quarters.\n\nThe air was suffocating. Undoubtedly the miscreants who had treated him to this surprise had dragged him into the closet.\n\nMeanwhile, Buffalo Bill and the baron had been traveling [48] along the Black Cañon trail straight into the ambushed Apaches whom Bascomb was to have in readiness.\n\nNomad groaned at the thought.\n\nWhat good would all the information he had gained at the El Rio do him now? He was powerless to save Buffalo Bill!\n\nAfter his first spasm of chagrin and disappointment, Nomad fell to thinking more calmly.\n\nHe recalled that Bascomb was merely to capture and hold the scout, thus keeping him away from the Three-ply Mine until the white and red thieves could accomplish their daring robbery of the mill bullion.\n\nThose who had placed Nomad in his uncomfortable position probably did not know what the old trapper had discovered at the El Rio.\n\nThe robbery planned to take place at the Three-ply would, no doubt, still be attempted on the following day.\n\nNomad’s work lay clearly before him: He must effect his escape as soon as possible, do something for Buffalo Bill if he needed anything done, and then, together, they would take what steps the scout deemed necessary for saving the Three-ply bullion.\n\nThis line of action fired the trapper with a determination to get effectively busy.\n\nWith the sweat pouring off him, and his breath coming from behind the towel-gag in gasps, he fought with the bonds at his wrists.\n\nA twisted towel is not nearly so effective as a rope when used for binding the hands of a powerful man like Nomad.\n\nHe got his hands free, but a deep boom of the court-house bell marked the half-hour before he had succeeded.\n\nTo get the gag from his mouth and free his feet took [49] him only a moment; then he staggered erect, groped for the door-knob, and reeled out of the closet and into the room.\n\nHe was drenched with sweat, and there was a sound in his ears as of the buzzing of a swarm of bees. That blow on the head was responsible for the buzzing. And what mattered it? Nomad was free! The trail to the Three-ply lay before him.\n\nFumbling for a match, he lighted a gas-jet. The room seemed in order. The chair by the window was overturned, and a spur lay near it, but, aside from that, everything was in place.\n\nThe hall door was closed. Nomad pulled at it, and found it locked. The key, he discovered, was sticking in the lock on the outside.\n\n“What did thet pizen, light-fingered man blow in hyar fer, ef et wasn’t ter do me up an’ put me in ther closet?” thought Nomad. “Ain’t nothin’ in ther room been teched. Arter usin’ them towels on me, ther feller went out an’ turned ther key on ther outside. Waugh, but thet was er bump!” and the old man felt of the lump on the back of his head.\n\nHe had no time, however, to waste on himself. Pushing on the bell for the call-boy, he picked up the spur, righted the chair, and finished the operation he had begun something like two hours and a half before.\n\nBy then, “front” was rapping to find out what was wanted.\n\n“Unlock ther door,” said Nomad.\n\nThe key grated, the door opened, and the astonished boy showed himself.\n\n“Say,” said he, “how did ye happen t’ lock yerself in the room an’ leave yer key on the outside?”\n\n[50]\n\n“Never mind thet,” snorted Nomad. “I didn’t happen ter, an’ thet’s all ye need ter know.”\n\nHe put on his hat, pushed the boy out, relocked the door, and handed him the key.\n\n“Take that down ter ther man behind ther counter,” said he; “I ain’t got time ter stop.”\n\nThen, with spurs jingling at his heels, he raced down the stairs three steps at a time, and dashed out of the hotel.\n\nAt the corral he found his horse ready and waiting.\n\n“Thought ye wanted the animile in a hurry?” remarked Nickerson. “He’s been standin’ thar fer the better part o’ two hours.”\n\n“I was delayed gittin’ hyar,” answered Nomad, leaping into the saddle. “See how quick ye kin tell me ther way ter ther Three-ply Mine, Nickerson.”\n\nNickerson used up a dozen words, and when he had done, the old trapper dug in with the irons and shot through the corral-gate.\n\nThe Piute boy had an easy time of it, compared with the strenuous experience fate had marked out for old Nomad.\n\nBernritter did not linger long in the hotel. When he came out he made directly for the corral, to which Jacobs was later followed by the trapper.\n\nLittle Cayuse, shadowing along on the super’s trail, knew at once that the man he was watching must have gone to the corral for his horse.\n\nThe boy, therefore, made rapidly for Nickerson’s, and got his bridle and riding-blanket on his pinto cayuse.\n\n“Take um Black Cañon trail to Three-ply Mine?” he queried, of one of Nickerson’s men.\n\n“Thet’s ther way ye go, ef ye go direct,” answered the man.\n\nLittle Cayuse galloped to the Five Points, and then along the dusty thoroughfare known as Grand Avenue. His sharp eyes were always straight ahead, keenly scrutinizing the road for some sign of Bernritter.\n\nThe boy was several miles down the Black Cañon trail before he glimpsed the man he was looking for. Although Cayuse could see only Bernritter’s back, yet the form of the man, and the clothes he wore, were indelibly impressed upon the little Indian’s mind, and he knew he could not be mistaken.\n\nFrom that point he followed slowly and cautiously, [52] keeping his distance and hugging the trail-side, and the cottonwood-trees.\n\nYet Bernritter did not seem to have the least idea he was being followed. Not once, so far as Cayuse could discover, did he look back.\n\nQuite probably Bernritter was deep in his nefarious plans for the next day, and had no time to watch his back trail. Be that as it might, Cayuse found the trailing easy; and it grew easier when the sun went down and the evening shadows began to lengthen.\n\nAt sunset Bernritter had crossed the Arizona canal, eighteen miles out of Phœnix. From there on the trail led across several miles of flat desert, and directly into the scarred and cactus-covered hills.\n\nThe twilight favored the boy while crossing the level ground, and when they drew into the hill valleys he needed no favoring of any sort.\n\nThe Indian instinct, born in him, made him as wary as a fox, and as quick and certain in his movements as a wildcat.\n\nCutting pieces from his riding-blanket, he tied them about his pinto’s hoofs, thus muffling the noise of his own travel, and bringing out distinctly the ringing fall of the hoofs ahead.\n\nHis trailing, through the gloomy gullies, was almost entirely by ear alone. Whether Bernritter was galloping, or trotting, or walking he knew at any moment, and he kept a distance that gave the hoof-beats in the lead the same volume of sound.\n\nSuddenly he heard the hoof-strokes come to a halt. On the instant Little Cayuse drew rein and backed silently into a cranny of the hills.\n\n[53]\n\nWas Bernritter coming back to see whether he was being followed?\n\nHe did not show himself, however; nor did the hoofs of his horse resume their clatter.\n\nCayuse dismounted and slipped forward along the gully to investigate.\n\nBefore he had gone far he heard voices, one voice Bernritter’s, and the other unmistakably that of an Indian.\n\nThe Piute had no love for the Apaches, and a thrill shot through him as he realized that this redskin with whom the superintendent was talking must be one of the hated people.\n\nThen Cayuse had another thought: Why was Bernritter talking with an Apache—holding with him a pow-wow that had already lasted several minutes?\n\nLittle Cayuse crawled closer, slipping through the loose stones like a snake.\n\nWhen he paused again, he was as near the two men as he dared to go. One was an Apache, and the boy was not slow to realize that his danger was greater than if he had been lying in the vicinity of two white men.\n\nFrom his last position Cayuse was able to see the dark form of the horse, and the upright figures of the men. While he watched, Bernritter turned to his horse and thrust his foot into the stirrup.\n\n“You sabe, eh?” Cayuse heard Bernritter ask the Apache. “Round up the warriors and wait for word from Bascomb. You’ll hear from him in two, three hour, mebbyso.”\n\n“Me sabe,” grunted the Indian.\n\nBernritter, without speaking further, rode on up the [54] gully. The Apache, whisking up the gully-bank like an antelope, vanished over the rim.\n\nLittle Cayuse returned to his waiting pinto, kicked the pony with his heels, and rode on after Bernritter.\n\nWhen he caught the tinkling sound of the hoofs ahead, he slowed his pace with a grunt of satisfaction.\n\nThen, from the beaded medicine-pouch that swung from his belt, he took some yellow pigment, dabbed one of his fingers into it, and ran a wavering line up and down either side of his face.\n\nThis was Cayuse’s war-paint. He put it on, now that he knew he was to take the war-path against foes of his own color.\n\nWhite men like Bernritter and Jacobs were not worth the trouble of dipping into his medicine-bag. Besides, Cayuse’s grievance against them was not yet well defined.\n\nPa-e-has-ka had set him on Bernritter’s trail, but that was all. Recent developments had given a fresh twist to the course of events. Who was Bascomb? And why was the Apache to round up more warriors?\n\nLittle Cayuse did not like the prospect.\n\nAs he followed along after Bernritter, he became suddenly aware that the hoofs in the lead were being drowned out by a steadily increasing roar.\n\nThe mill-stamps! Ah! At last they were coming close to the Three-ply Mine.\n\nThe gully the two were following suddenly opened out into a wide valley.\n\nAt the entrance to the valley Cayuse drew rein; then, dismounting, he sat down on a boulder and watched Bernritter ride down into the camp and lose himself [55] among the twinkling lights in mill, bunk-house, and chuck-shanty.\n\nFor a long time the boy sat there, watching the trailing plume of smoke from the mill, and listening to the clamor of the stamps.\n\nSuddenly he was startled. Another horseman galloped past him. Cayuse and his pinto were a little to one side of the trail, and somewhat in the shadow. Fortunately they had not been seen.\n\nThe man was Jacobs. In spite of the darkness, the boy instinctively recognized the galloping horseman.\n\nIf the man was Jacobs, then Nomad must be somewhere near.\n\nEagerly the Piute waited, straining his eyes back along the gully.\n\nBut no Nomad appeared. Had Wolf-killer lost the trail? It was not like him to do that, for Wolf-killer could follow a trail like an Indian.\n\nMounting his pinto, Little Cayuse retraced his course through the gully.\n\nWhen he had reached a place where the drumming of the stamps sounded low in his ears, the echoes were taken up by more hoof-beats. Cayuse drew aside, and McGowan, owner of the mine, swung past.\n\nThe boy had thought, at first, that it might be Nomad and only his native caution had kept him from giving a shout from the trail-side. A moment later he had recognized McGowan as instinctively as he had recognized Jacobs.\n\nHe recalled that McGowan had told Jacobs to return to the mine with Bernritter, and both to go at once. And here Jacobs had preceded his employer into the camp by only a few minutes!\n\n[56]\n\nThe boy plagued himself with questions in an attempt to account for this, and for Bernritter’s meeting and talking with the Apache.\n\nAbove these things, which mightily puzzled the Piute, was the more important question as to what had become of old Nomad.\n\nStill riding and hoping, Cayuse drew well away from the croon of the stamps.\n\nThen he heard a sound, far in the distance, that sent a chill to his heart.\n\nThe sound was a pistol-shot!\n\nJust the one report, and no more. Cayuse listened breathlessly, but only deep and ominous silence followed the faint but incisive note of the six-shooter.\n\nThe boy’s fears leaped to Nomad. He had met with treachery, of some sort, on the trail!\n\nSetting the pinto to a rapid gait, the Piute rode like the wind along the gully, the pony, with his muffled hoofs, carrying him onward like a darting shadow.\n\nAll roads, that night, seemed to lead to the Three-ply Mine. At least it seemed so to Little Cayuse.\n\nAnd, for the young Indian, the way seemed wrapped in profound and forbidding mystery.\n\nAs he made in the direction of the pistol-shot, he believed he had a clue to at least part of the puzzle.\n\nBernritter had told the Apache to round up more warriors and wait for Bascomb. This had been done; and Wolf-killer, galloping along the trail after Jacobs, had fallen into a snare laid by Bascomb and the Apaches.\n\nThis is what the boy thought, but he was soon to be undeceived. A snare had been laid, but not for Nomad.\n\nA few minutes of swift riding brought Little Cayuse into a zone where a sixth sense told him of danger.\n\n[57]\n\nTurning from the gully into a small defile that broke through its left-hand bank, he halted, secured the pinto to a white-thorn bush, and carried out his further investigations on foot.\n\nProceeding onward along the gully, keeping in the shadow and dodging from boulder to boulder, Cayuse presently came upon a scene that made him congratulate himself that he had not plumped into it full tilt on his pinto.\n\nAt the point where the scene unrolled before the boy’s eyes the gully widened, and the starlight sifted brightly downward and dispelled much of the gloom.\n\nHe saw two horses quite near him. They were riderless, had been roped together, and the riata tethering them had been wrapped about a stone.\n\nBeyond the horses were many Apaches; just how many the boy could not tell, but certainly there were a dozen, at the least.\n\nThe Apaches were working over some objects lying on the ground, and a white man was moving about among them, hurrying them about their work with gruff oaths.\n\nPresently the Apaches started up the eastern bank of the gully in two groups, each group apparently carrying a burden.\n\nWhat those burdens were Cayuse could guess.\n\nWithout doubt they were the men who had ridden the two horses that now stood bound together and secured to the stone.\n\nUp and up the steep slope toiled the Apaches, the white man swearing and urging them on. In a little while the whole villainous crew disappeared over the top of the gully-bank, each group still carrying its helpless burden.\n\nCayuse ran to the horses. He felt them over with his [58] hands; felt of their legs, their heads, and, lastly, groped his fingers over the saddles.\n\nOne horse he could not recognize, either by sight or touch. The other, unless his reasoning deceived him, belonged to Pa-e-has-ka!\n\nPa-e-has-ka! The Piute caught his breath.\n\nWas Buffalo Bill one of the prisoners just captured by the white man and the Apaches?\n\nIt was a startling thing for Cayuse to come looking for Nomad and find Buffalo Bill.\n\nThat was not a time for useless thought, however, but for action.\n\nHurrying to the eastern wall of the gully, Cayuse climbed the slope. Its top gave him an outlook over a small, flat plain, stretching eastward and lying distinctly under the starlight.\n\nThe Indians and the white man were carrying their prisoners across the level ground toward a little hill of stones. A black opening yawned in the top of the stone hill, and Cayuse knew it to be an old, and probably abandoned, mine.\n\nThe boy dared not go farther, and he knelt where he was and continued to watch. Owing to the distance, he could trace the movements of the white man and the Apaches but indistinctly; yet he saw enough to convince him that the two prisoners were being lowered down into the old mine.\n\nThe white man and his red helpers clambered up the ore-dump, hovered together there for several minutes, all busily engaged, and then came back down the ragged little hill. And on their return Cayuse could see that they were carrying no one.\n\nFacing about, the boy scrambled back into the gully, [59] untied the riata that tethered the two horses to the stone, jumped into the saddle of Buffalo Bill’s mount, and galloped toward the place where he had left his pinto, with the other of the two horses in tow.\n\nThis move was characteristic of Little Cayuse. The white man and the Apaches were Buffalo Bill’s enemies, and Cayuse considered them his. It is always the proper thing to get away from an enemy everything you can. On this principle, partly, Cayuse was taking the horses. Then, again, he was looking forward to the time when Buffalo Bill and the man with him should be taken out of the old mine and need their mounts.\n\nOn reaching the defile where he had left his pinto, Cayuse pulled the pinto’s thong from the thorn-bush, changed his seat to the pony’s back, and raced up the defile, leading the animals picked up in the gully.\n\nThe boy was now in his element. He understood very well that the white man and the Apaches would miss the horses, and would imagine that they had broken away. Search would be made for the missing animals, but Cayuse would make it his business to see that the search was not successful.\n\nIf the Apaches caught him, Cayuse knew that a bullet or a knife would settle his earthly account.\n\nBut the Piute was not intending to let himself be caught. He was an Indian no less than the Apaches, and fully as able to take care of himself.\n\nThe defile the boy was following led out onto the flat desert.\n\nLeading his horses, he circled to the south over the plain, found a place where he could descend into the gully, and was just crossing to the western wall, when a [60] rider spurred out from behind a pile of rocks and laid his horse lengthwise across his path.\n\nA revolver gleamed feebly in the starlight, leveled straight at the Piute’s breast.\n\n“Ugh!” grunted Little Cayuse.\n\n“Waugh, ye pizen varmint!” growled a voice. “Whar ye goin’ with them cabyos?”\n\n“Wolf-killer!” muttered Little Cayuse.\n\n“Snarlin’ hyeners ef et ain’t Cayuse? Waal, blazes ter blazes an’ all hands round! Say, I thort ye was told ter foller Bernritter?”\n\n“All same,” answered Cayuse. “You no follow Jacobs, huh?”\n\n“I’m follerin’ him now. But look hyar, son, what ye doin’ with them two hosses? One of ’em looks like Buffler’s, blamed ef et don’t.”\n\n“Wuh! All same Pa-e-has-ka. We no stay here. Heap Apache right ahead. Cayuse steal um cayuses from Apaches.”\n\n“What’s thet ye’re tellin’? Apaches loose in this part o’ ther range? I reckons, Cayuse, ye must be shy a few, ain’t ye?”\n\nNomad was himself keeping a sharp lookout for redskins. In fact, when he saw Little Cayuse coming over the eastern wall of the gully with the two led horses, he had felt sure that he was one of Bascomb’s Apaches, and had screened himself behind the rock-pile.\n\nThe question he had put to the boy was for the purpose of making certain the Piute had made no mistake.\n\n“Heap Apache,” insisted Cayuse; “one white man.”\n\n“Jumpin’ tarantelers!” breathed the trapper, “I was gittin’ warmer’n I thort. Ye’ve got Buffler’s hoss, an’ [61] ther baron’s. Aire ye meanin’ ter tell me thet Buffler an’ ther baron hev been captered?”\n\n“Wuh! Me see um take Pa-e-has-ka and Dutch brave and put um in old mine.”\n\n“Ole mine? What ole mine?”\n\n“Him little way from here; not far. We get out of gully, so Apaches no find us when they come looking for horses. Sabe? ”\n\n“I’m savvyin’ like er house afire. But tell me fust off ef Buffler was hurt?”\n\n“No can tell, Wolf-killer. Him carried to old mine; and Dutch brave, him carried to old mine, too.”\n\n“Ain’t this er piece o’ thunderin’ mean luck for ye?” grumbled the old trapper. “Thar was me, knowin’ all erbout this hyar trap in ther hills, layin’ in ther closet o’ thet hotel like er trapped rat, an’ not able ter do er thing ter keep Buffler from runnin’ inter thet ambush. Things sartinly does turn out all-fired queer sometimes.”\n\nWhile the old man was spluttering, he and Cayuse were climbing up the steep slope, each with one of the led horses.\n\nThey reached the top, went a little way down on the other side, and then dismounted to watch for some sign of the Apaches.\n\nBut no Apaches showed themselves.\n\nWhile they were waiting, Cayuse told of his trailing, of the way Jacobs and McGowan had passed him, of his search for Nomad, of his hearing the pistol-shot, discovering the two horses, and watching the white man and the Indians carry Buffalo Bill and the baron to the old mine. He finished with an account of how he had taken the two animals and rode off with them.\n\nCayuse never wasted words. His recital was terse yet [62] graphic, and Nomad listened with profound admiration for the little Piute’s pluck and resourcefulness.\n\n“Ye’ve done well, Cayuse,” said Nomad, when the boy had finished. “From what ye say, Buffler an’ Schnitz aire in some ole mine-shaft whar this hyar Bascomb fixes ter keep ’em pris’ners all durin’ ter-morrer. But you an’ me’ll fool Bascomb an’ his reds, Cayuse. Jest as soon as we’re shore the Apaches hev given up lookin’ fer the missin’ cabyos, we’ll make headway to’rds thet ole mine an’ snake Buffler an’ ther baron out o’ et quick.”\n\n“Wuh!” said Little Cayuse.\n\nFor half an hour longer they watched the gully, and as the Apaches failed to appear, they reasoned that the redskins had given up the horses and had gone away about their own business, whatever that might be.\n\n“I reckon we kin hike out now, Cayuse,” said Nomad, “an’ feel purty safe about Bascomb an’ his Injuns. Straddle yer pinto, boy, an’ lead ther way ter this hyar ole mine. Ye don’t reckon any o’ Bascomb’s reds aire watchin’ et, do ye?”\n\n“All come away,” answered Cayuse. “Me see um.”\n\n“Kerect. Mount an’ ride, Cayuse, an’ we’ll soon put Pard Buffler inter ther game ag’in.”\n\nThe Black Cañon trail, up to the point where the road to Castle Creek Cañon broke away from it, was familiar ground to the king of scouts. He and Nomad had had some exciting experiences in this part of the country—experiences which impress land-marks and topography indelibly upon a man’s mind.\n\nTherefore, although the scout and the baron traversed the Three-ply road during the earlier half of the night, the scout’s knowledge, added to that acquired by the baron, was sufficient to keep them on the right course.\n\nAs the scout had stated, it was his intention to camp out somewhere in the vicinity of the Three-ply Mine, prosecuting his work of apprehending the bullion thieves, unknown even to McGowan.\n\nThe Black Cañon trail was to be followed until they were hard upon the Three-ply camp; then they would break from it and establish themselves in some favorable locality where water could be had, and where they would yet be in touch with the mine.\n\nAs to what he intended to do, the scout’s plans were rather vague, but he was hoping for good results from the work of Nomad and Cayuse.\n\nIf the trapper and the little Piute trailed Bernritter and Jacobs according to instructions, they would sooner or later arrive at the Three-ply camp. When they arrived there, the scout felt sure he would have little difficulty in getting into communication with them. Undoubtedly [64] Nomad and Cayuse would themselves be hunting quarters among the neighboring hills, as it was part of their instructions to keep their surveillance of the super and the cyanid expert a secret.\n\nCompletely oblivious of the Apaches, gathered under the leadership of Bascomb, Buffalo Bill and the baron dropped easily into the trap they had spread.\n\nThe blow was struck swiftly, suddenly, and effectively. Not a sound heralded it.\n\nFrom each side of the gully half a dozen noosed riatas leaped out from the rocks.\n\nThe scout and the baron saw the flying nooses. One or two might have been dodged, but there was no getting away from twelve of them.\n\nBuffalo Bill had barely time to jerk a revolver clear and fire in the direction of the rocks at the gully-side. The next moment he was roped and dragged bodily out of the saddle.\n\nThe noose had slipped part way down his body before it tightened, and when it closed on him it pinned his arms to his sides and rendered him helpless.\n\nHe struggled to the best of his ability, but a swarm of redskins dropped down on him and fairly smothered him by force of numbers.\n\nAmong the red faces bending over him he saw a white one. While the Apaches held him, the white man laid a handkerchief over the scout’s face.\n\nThe handkerchief was saturated with chloroform, and it was impossible for the scout to get away from the sense-destroying fumes of the drug.\n\nUnconsciousness followed; and when the period of lethargy was finally broken, the scout sat up and stared about him into pitch-black night.\n\n[65]\n\nThe drug, in clearing out of his faculties, had left a nausea in his stomach. From somewhere in the darkness the baron was groaning in the depths of a similar misery.\n\n“Baron!” called the scout.\n\n“Puffalo Pill!” gulped the baron. “Gootness me! I t’ought meppy you vas deadt. I peen pooty near deadt meinseluf. Ach, vat a trouple in mein inside. Ach! I hope dot I don’d haf to live mooch longer und suffer like vat I am.”\n\n“Nonsense, baron! You were drugged, just as I was. You’ll feel better when you get over the effects.”\n\n“Vell, meppy. I vish Frieda vas here to do somet’ing for me.”\n\n“Don’t waste any time thinking of Frieda. We have other things to command our attention. Are you tied?”\n\n“No, I don’d vas tied.”\n\n“Neither am I: That’s something, at all events. Strange those scoundrels left us the use of our hands. I can’t understand what they mean by making such a play as this.”\n\n“Id vas mighdy sutten.”\n\n“Sudden! It came like lightning out of a clear sky.”\n\n“Who dit id?”\n\n“Apaches; but there was one white man among them.”\n\n“Vy dit dey dit id?” groaned the baron.\n\n“Give it up,” answered the scout. “It must be that this has something to do with those bullion robberies at the Three-ply.”\n\n“Vell, meppy. I can’t undershtand nodding aboudt id, only I haf sooch a sickness. Ach, ach! Oof I don’d ged vell, id vill be some hardt plows for Frieda, I bed you.”\n\nRising dizzily to his feet, the scout began groping [66] about him. He touched a steep, jagged wall on every side save one. He looked up and saw a circular patch of sky, glimmering with stars; then the truth dawned upon him.\n\n“We’re in an old mine, baron,” he announced.\n\n“Yah? Iss dere any vay to ged oudt?”\n\nThe scout’s distress was rapidly passing. With every minute he was getting better, and feeling more like himself.\n\nHis belt and guns had been taken from him, and his money and watch were missing from his pockets; but his matches had been left, and he was able to make a brief survey of the shaft.\n\nAs nearly as he could judge, it was some thirty feet from the bottom of the shaft to the top. The walls were straight up and down, so that scaling them without a rope, or ladders, was an impossibility.\n\nOft at one side of the shaft a level had been run. The baron was sitting in front of the black opening, and the scout peered over his head into the dark.\n\n“It’s an abandoned mine, all right,” averred the scout.\n\n“I vish dot ve couldt apandon id,” said the baron. “I mighdt schust as vell be in chail as in a blace like dis. Und id vas all so sutten! Vy, Puffalo Pill, I didn’t haf no shance to do any shooding mit my guns, or any fighding mit my fists. Two ropes tropped ofer my headt, my horse vent righht oudt from unter me, und dere I vas, mit Inchuns piled t’ree deep on top. Und den dot shmell!”\n\n“Come, come, baron,” adjured the scout, “brace up! Those Apaches have stowed us away here for safe-keeping, but they have left us the use of our hands and feet, and perhaps we won’t have to stay here, after all. [67] Pull yourself together and we’ll see where that level will take us.”\n\n“Meppy id vill take us oudt oof dis hole!” exclaimed the baron, getting up.\n\n“No such good luck as that. Those reds and that white scoundrel must have known about this place before they dropped us into it. I’m obliged to them for not doing us any injury. No matter what happens to you in this life, baron, there’s always something to be thankful for.”\n\nIt was an odd adventure. In all the scout’s experience with Indians, he had never before known them to fall back on a drug when they wished to put an enemy “out of the running.” More than likely it was their white leader who had furnished the drug, however, and had planned to use it.\n\n“Vell,” said the baron, “I t’ink ve can feel t’ankful dot ve’re alife, even oof ve don’d got no guns left, und no vay oof gedding oudt oof dis hole. Meppy, Puffalo Pill, dose fellers vas going to leaf us down here undil ve shtarve to deat’!”\n\n“Starve to death!” scoffed the scout. “We’ll not do that while there’s no more than thirty feet of shaft keeping us from the surface of the ground. There’s a way to get out of here, and we’ll find it. How are you feeling now?”\n\n“Pedder. Der pain ain’d so pad like id vas. I t’ink I vill live long enough to shtarve to deat’, anyvay.”\n\n“Come on after me,” said the scout, “and let’s see what we can make out of the level.”\n\nHe entered the darkness of the drift, scratching matches as he proceeded. Twenty feet measured the [68] length of the level, and the scout brought up short against a wall of virgin rock.\n\n“Nothing much here, baron,” said he. “The men who located this property drifted twenty feet off the shaft to find the lead. They didn’t find it, and so gave up.”\n\n“I haf found somet’ing,” said the baron. “Look here, vonce.”\n\nThe scout retraced his way a few feet to where the baron was standing. On the floor of the level, directly in front of the baron, was something that looked like a pile of silver balls. Each ball was about the size of a man’s fist, and there must have been more than a hundred of them.\n\nThe scout picked up one of the balls, examined it a moment, and then dropped it in amazement.\n\n“Vat’s der madder, Puffalo Pill?” queried the baron, in some excitement. “Meppy dis iss a silfer-mine, hey?”\n\nThe match flickered out in the scout’s fingers, and the baron heard a low laugh.\n\n“Vat for you laugh like dot?” demanded the baron. “Meppy ve can take dot silfer avay, und sell him und make some money. Oof dere iss money enough for me to ged marrit on, all vat habbened mit me I vill call a goot t’ing. Dose Inchuns dropped us indo a silfer-mine; und der choke’s on dem, hey?”\n\n“Baron,” said the scout, “this isn’t a silver-mine.”\n\n“Ain’d dose palls silfer?”\n\n“No, they’re gold.”\n\n“Goldt? Himmelplitzen! I t’ought goldt vas yellow. Dose palls are vite.”\n\n“They’re gold, nevertheless, baron,” said the scout; “yellow gold covered with quicksilver. That is a pile of [69] amalgam—gold and quicksilver as it comes from the plates of a stamp-mill.”\n\n“Py chimineddy! Iss dot some oof McGowan’s lost goldt, Puffalo Pill?”\n\n“I’ll bet my pile it is. Those redskins have dropped us into the place where the bullion thieves have been caching their loot.”\n\n“Und id don’d pelong to us, but to McGowan!”\n\n“It’s McGowan’s gold, all right, baron.” Once more a laugh broke from the scout’s lips. “We’d never have found it if that white villain and those Apaches hadn’t——”\n\nA whistle echoed down the shaft and drifted in along the level to where the scout and the baron were standing, near the pile of amalgam.\n\n“Vat id iss?” whispered the baron, taking a tense grip on the scout’s arm. “Meppy der Inchuns haf gome pack to put us oudt oof der vay.”\n\nBut the baron was wrong in this conclusion. While he and the scout stood there, trying to puzzle out the cause of that whistle, a voice came to their ears.\n\n“Buffler! Aire ye thar, ole pard?”\n\n“Nomad!” cried the scout, starting for the shaft.\n\n“Py shinks oof id ain’d!” added the baron, with a whoop of joy.\n\n“Thet’s yerself, is et, Buffler?” called the old trapper, from the top of the shaft.\n\n“Sure, Nick,” replied the scout, looking upward to where two heads were framed darkly against the background of sky. “Who’s that with you?”\n\n“Cayuse.”\n\n“Great Scott! I can’t understand this at all.”\n\n[70]\n\n“Jest wait till we git ye out o’ thar an’ we’ll spring a shore enough surprise-party on ye. Aire ye all right?”\n\n“As well as ever.”\n\n“An’ Schnitz—hes he got any bones broke?”\n\n“Nod dot I know anyt’ing aboudt,” the baron answered for himself.\n\n“Hooray! I was thinkin’ mebbyso ther reds had damaged ye some when they sprang their leetle trap. I’m goin’ ter throw down the end of er rope. Lay holt o’ et, you two, an’ we’ll snake ye out with one o’ ther hosses.”\n\nThe scout and the baron stepped back into the drift until the end of the rope had come swishing down; then they went out and laid firm hold of it.\n\n“All ready, Nick!” shouted Buffalo Bill.\n\n“Gee-haw with thet pesky cabyo, Cayuse,” called Nomad to the Piute boy; “git him a-goin’, son, an’ stop ther minit I sing out.”\n\nThe rope tightened, then straightened out under the weight of the scout and the baron. Up and up they went at a smart clip until they reached the mouth of the shaft. At a quick command from the trapper, Cayuse stopped the horse; then Buffalo Bill and the baron climbed out on top of the old ore-dump.\n\n“Howlin’ painters,” jubilated Nomad, grabbing his pard’s hand, “but et’s good ter see ye, Buffler, an’ ter know ye pulled out o’ thet trap without so much as moultin’ er feather.”\n\n“Weren’t there any Apaches on guard around here?” inquired the scout, sitting down on the rocks.\n\n“Nary. I reckon ther reds thort they had ye bottled up fer keeps down thar, an’ thet thar wasn’t no way fer ye ter git out without help. ’Course,” laughed Nomad, [71] “they didn’t opine noways thet ye was goin’ ter git help.”\n\n“I can’t understand that play of theirs at all. They snagged the baron and me with riatas, dumped us out of our saddles, drugged us, and then lowered us into that old shaft. If they had wanted to put us out of the way, why didn’t they use their guns, or their knives? It isn’t like a pack of reds to go to all that extra trouble.”\n\n“Thar was a white man with ’em, wasn’t thar?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Waal, them Injuns was bein’ bossed by ther white man. All ther pesky white varmint wanted ter do was ter hang ye up, hard an’ fast, durin’ ter-morrer.”\n\n“Why was that?”\n\n“They hev a mill clean-up at ther Three-ply ter-morrer, an’ Bernritter an’ Jacobs an’ them reds aire plannin’ ter git away with more’n forty thousand in bullion.”\n\nThe scout stared at the old man in astonishment.\n\n“Where did you get next to all that, Nick?” he asked.\n\n“By doin’ what ye told me ter do an’ follerin’ Jacobs.”\n\n“This is important. Give me the whole of it.”\n\nThe trapper wen"
