        "text": "Qualified Spendthrift Trusts\n\nEffective July 1, 2007, the State of Wyoming has enacted changes to its existing Uniform Trust Code which allows for self-settled asset protection trusts referred to as a “Qualified Spendthrift Trust.” This type of trust has also been referred to as “self settled” or “asset protection” trust.\n\nWhile the settlor of a Qualified Spendthrift Trust cannot be the trustee, the settlor may retain the powers to:\n\nVeto any distribution from the Qualified Spendthrift Trust\n\nExercise a testamentary or inter vivos general or limited power of appointment over the assets of the Qualified Spendthrift Trust\n\nAdd or remove a trustee, trust protector or trust advisor\n\nServe as investment advisor to the Qualified Spendthrift Trust\n\nThe Wyoming legislation contains provisions that permit the transfer of trust assets from a similar type of trust previously created and funded in another jurisdiction to a Wyoming Qualified Spendthrift Trust, with the creditor protection aspects of the Wyoming Statutes relating back to the date when the trust was originally funded in the other jurisdiction.\n\nThe advantage of this type of trust is that the settlor can shield certain assets from potential creditors while still getting the benefits of the assets, such as income or principal distributions from the trust for the Settlor’s benefit. Anyone considering this type of trust must consider the type of assets that they will be funding the trust with and can not make themselves totally insolvent by transferring all of their assets into this type of trust.\n\nWyoming Bank and Trust has the experience of managing this type of trust and has worked with settlors and their advisors in developing the same. We are willing to work with trust advisors selected for either making the investment of the trust assets and/or recommend distributions from the trust. We are also willing to work with trust protectors selected to make decisions as allowed under the Wyoming Uniform Trust Code.\n\nThe statutes governing the Qualified Spendthrift Trust can be found in the Wyoming Uniform Trust Code WS S 4-10-101 et seq. The Wyoming Statutes can be found at the Wyoming legislative website: legisweb.state.wy.us.\n\nGeneration-Skipping/Dynasty Trusts\n\nA Generation-Skipping Trust is an estate-planning technique used to transfer property to second-generation beneficiaries, usually grandchildren, without the trust assets becoming part of the children’s estate. The benefits of this type of trust are:\n\nThe trust can grow much more, since it is not subject to estate and inheritance taxes at each generational level\n\nThe trust assets are protected from spendthrifts, creditor claims or claims due to divorce of beneficiaries in succeeding generations\n\nTrust assets are being managed by experienced professionals with the aid of any named trust advisors or trust protectors\n\nWyoming is one of the few states that allows for the use of Dynasty Trusts in the estate planning. The Rule Against Perpetuities has been extended to 1,000 years in the State of Wyoming WS S 34-1-139 (b). The use of a Dynasty Trust along with a Generation-Skipping Trust can extend the benefits of the Generation-Skipping Trust for many more generations. This will also allow the Trust to even grow more, since a Wyoming-based trust IS NOT subject to state income taxes, since the State of Wyoming does not have a state income tax.\n\nRevocable Living Trust\n\nThe Revocable Living Trust allows you to set up a trust that you are in complete control of during your lifetime and while you are still competent. You may add Trust Advisors (per WS S 4-10-712) or Trust Protectors (per WS S 4-10-710) to assist us (as the corporate trustee) in the investments of the assets or for distributions during times of incompetency, or for the benefit of others that the trust provides benefits to — such as other family members, a pet (Wyoming law under WS S 4-10-409 permits the establishment of a trust for a pet), or a charity.\n\nThe benefits of a Revocable Living Trust being held by us as trustee include:\n\nConfidentiality\n\nContinuity of management in the event of illness, incompetency or death\n\nAvoidance of probate and direct distributions to beneficiaries\n\nProfessional asset management and safekeeping of assets with collection and disbursement of income\n\nAccurate record keeping and tax ledgers\n\nYou may also wish to name us as the Successor Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust, whereby we will take over as trustee upon your death or incapacity if you are serving as your own trustee during your lifetime.\n\nTestamentary Trusts\n\nA Testamentary Trust is established by the terms of a Will and begins to function only after death and probate of the Will. This type of trust allows the Settlor to control the assets up until the time of death and then passes the management to a trustee after death.\n\nThe benefits of having us serve as a trustee of a testamentary trust include:\n\nImpartial third-party management of the assets and distribution thereof to beneficiaries\n\nAccurate record keeping and tax ledgers\n\nProfessionals that are knowledgeable on the administration of this type of trust\n\nRelieving family members of the burden and conflicts that can arise in managing this type of trust\n\nEstate Settlement\n\nWe can act in the capacity of Personal Representative or Executor of a Will. In this capacity, we would be responsible for the settlement of the estate per the terms of the Will and the laws of the State of Wyoming. If a Will does not exist, then we would probate and settle the estate according to the intestacy laws of the State of Wyoming. (See WS S 2-4-101 thru 2-4-108 on intestacy.)\n\nSome of the duties that are required of the Personal Representative include:\n\nGathering of the assets\n\nPayment of debts\n\nContesting improper claims\n\nCollecting sums owed to the estate\n\nManaging the assets during administration\n\nSale of assets\n\nPayment of taxes\n\nPayment of estate expenses (See Wyoming Probate Code at WS S 2-1-101 et seq.)\n\nThe benefits of having us serve in this function include having experienced professionals that are familiar with the process and who are an impartial to the beneficiaries of the estate.\n\nInsurance Trusts\n\nAn Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) is set up to hold life insurance policies outside of an estate. This type of trust is able to provide liquidity to an estate that may include a ranch, farm or small business, or it may be used to provide the required funds to beneficiaries to pay estate taxes or partners to pay of a deceased partners’ estate. An ILIT type of trust has also been used in connection with Dynasty Trusts to provide for future generations.\n\nConservator/Conservatorship Trusts\n\nA Conservator is appointed to manage the assets for an incompetent or incapacitated person. The Conservator has full investment powers and manages the assets according to the needs of the ward, subject to supervision of the Court. (See WS S 3-3-101 thru 3-3-1106). The Conservator is responsible for an annual accounting to the Court having jurisdiction.\n\nThe benefits of having a professional trustee serve as Conservator include:\n\nAccurate accounting to the Court\n\nImpartial party handling affairs of Ward\n\nFamily members or friends are not tempted to mismanage assets\n\nProfessional management, record keeping and tax reporting\n\nA Conservatorship Trust can be set up by a Conservator under WS S 3-3-607 (vi). Under this statutory section, the trust has to be revocable, needs a Wyoming corporate Trustee and can only be created by an order of a court having jurisdiction over the Conservatorship. The advantage of using this type of trust includes the extension of time that the assets can be managed for the benefit of the Ward for the Ward’s benefit. The use of this type of trust is primarily for minors after they turn 18 and there is a large sum of money involved in their Conservatorship. The creation of a Conservatorship Trust can assist in providing for this young adult in a more structured and defined way for some time after they become a legal adult.\n\nCustody Accounts\n\nOur custody services can be used for a variety of reasons by individuals, public entities or both profit and nonprofit institutions. This kind of account is designed to hold securities such as stock or bonds, or other assets such as mutual funds and money market investments.\n\nInstitutions have used this type of account for money management purposes or to hold securities that are being managed by outside managers. Public entities receive the highest GASB ratings when their securities are held through a banking institution. Institutions such as insurance companies use this type of service to hold securities being pledged to the Wyoming Insurance Commissioner.\n\nIndividuals use this type of service for the benefit of having all of their assets being held at one location. This type of service provides for accurate accounting of income and the redemption of securities. Individuals who have named us as the successor trustee of their Revocable Living Trust use this type of service in order to provide them with the peace of mind that their liquid assets are readily available to their successor trustee in the event we need to began acting in an emergency situation.\n\nWyoming Bank & Trust uses The Bank of New York as its primary custodian for DTC-eligible securities and US Treasury and Agency issues. The Bank of New York is recognized as the premier custodian for these types of securities. Fidelity Investor Services is used to custodian all mutual funds.\n\nCorporate Trusts\n\nWyoming Bank & Trust has served as either the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar or Escrow Agent on billions of dollars of public entity debt financings throughout the State of Wyoming. The financings have included:\n\nGeneral obligation bonds\n\nRevenue bonds – water, sewer, hospital, lease revenue\n\nSpecial improvement district bonds\n\nCapital facilities tax issues\n\nLease financings\n\nTax anticipation notes\n\nRefunding bonds & refunding escrows\n\nIndustrial revenue bonds\n\nThe issuers have included counties, cities, towns, schools, hospitals and colleges, some of which are outlined below:\n\nStates: State of Wyoming\n\nCounties: Albany, Carbon, Goshen, Laramie, Park, Platte, Sheridan, Teton\n\nCities: Cheyenne, Cody, Laramie, Sheridan\n\nTowns: Burns, Greybull, Jackson, Kaycee, Lyman, Pine Bluffs, Thermopolis, Torrington\n\nSchools Districts: Converse #2, Fremont #22, Laramie #1 & #2, Platte #1, Teton #1, Washakie #1, Weston #1 & #7\n\nColleges: Central Wyoming Community College, Laramie County Community College, Northwest Community College, Northern Wyoming Community College, Western Wyoming Community College\n\nUniversities: University of Wyoming\n\nHospitals: Hot Springs County Hospital, Johnson County Hospital, Platte County Hospital, Memorial Hospital of Sheridan County, Washakie County Hospital, West Park Hospital\n\nOthers: Buffalo Bill Museum, Northwest Improvement District, Platte County Fire District, Salt Creek Water District\n\nWyoming Bank & Trust is very experienced at maintaining and investing project funds and reserve funds that may be associated with a public debt financing.
