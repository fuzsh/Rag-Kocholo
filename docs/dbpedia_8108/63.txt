Archers now have a venue to practice their sport at Buffalo Bill SRA’s public archery range located west of the campground. Built by Nebraska Game and Parks staff and local volunteers, the range is free to use and open during daylight hours. The range has seven square targets in wooden frames set at 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 yards. It is available on a first-come, first-served basis and archers must bring their own equipment.

Buffalo Bill State Recreation Area has great fishing via access to the North Platte River. Largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, common carp and northern pike can be caught here.

The park offers five miles of hiking trails.

The park’s placement along the Platte River makes a peaceful, scenic spot for picnicking or grilling. The park offers one picnic shelter with a grill and four tables. There are eight tent camping areas with grills and tables that can be used as day use areas.

During the summer months, the park offers guests guided horseback trail rides provided by Dusty Trails and float trips down the North Platte River. Rentals of kayaks, canoes, tubes and tanks are available. In addition, the park has a petting zoo.

For more information about these activities, please call the park at 308-530-0048.
