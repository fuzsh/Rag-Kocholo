NORTH PLATTE-If you're from around this area you know what Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park or Scout's Rest Ranch is. It's the Christmas tradition with the family, it's the amazing mansion, the beautiful barn, the bison, the green grass and on and on. But, what do you really know about Buffalo Bill Ranch SHP?

We came across this information from Nebraska State Historical Parks and we learned a lot, so we thought you might too.

Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park, known as Scout's Rest Ranch, is a living history state park located west of North Platte.

The ranch was established in 1878 with an initial purchase of 160 acres south of the Union Pacific tracks by William (Buffalo Bill) Cody.

The 4,000-acre ranch was sold in 1911 and has been under the management of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission since 1964.

The 25-acre historic state park, deemed a National Historic Landmark in 1978, is open weekdays from April to October.

The house and outbuildings can be toured, including a museum documenting Cody’s life from a Pony Express rider to his Wild West shows.

At Christmas time, the mansion is decorated by local groups, individuals and organizations and can be toured by the public for a fee. The tours are complete with carolers, roasted chestnut, cider, and cookies.

Founding of the Cody-North Ranch

In 1877 Cody contacted Major Frank North, the leader of the Pawnee Scouts, who was living in Sidney, Nebraska. Cody founded the Cody-North Partnership with the North brothers to form a cattle business. North found land along the Dismal River, 65 miles north of North Platte, on which cattle could graze and a ranch could be built.

Cody continued touring his “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West” show while North purchased cattle at the north end of the Texas cattle trail, near Ogallala, Nebraska.

North hired cowboys to help operate the ranch while Cody was on tour.
