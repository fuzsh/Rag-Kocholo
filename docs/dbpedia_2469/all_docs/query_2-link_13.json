        "text": "Jane was the daughter of Archibald and Jean Henderson Handley. She was born 1771 on a fifty eight acre farm located on the Cowpasture River in a part of Augusta county, which is now called Bath County, Virginia. She moved with her family to a farm in Greenbrier County, now Monroe County, West Virginia in 1774.\n\nBased on recently found documents her given name was Jean. The most prominent being a handwritten note by her father Archibald Handley stating that; \"This is to certify that all parties is agreed for Esom Leach and Jean Handley to be Joined in the Holy State of Matrimony.\" Dated\" Dec the 22nd Day 1795 \" And signed; \" Archd Handley\"\n\nIt appears that Jane was a common nick-name for Jean. While searching for Jane's proper name I found several examples of women named Jean being called Jane. In fact listed in the 1800 Monroe County Tax List Jane Leach's widowed mother Jean Handley was called Jane Handley. She was charged for taxes on two horses.\n\nShe had four sisters, Sarah, wife of William Shanks, Grisal, wife of James Foster (there is a mention by her nephew James Leach of her being called Grisal Horton), Ann, wife of Reuben George, Marey, wife of John Miller and one brother called James, who was married to an unknown Isabell. (the sister's names are written as found Archibald's will).\n\nWhen Esom Leach and his brother-in-law Captain James Jones went to the Courthouse in Lewisburg, Virginia on the 28th of December, 1795 to post the marriage bond required to be able obtain the necessary Marriage License for his and Jane's pending marriage the clerk filed her name as Jane Handly.\n\nJane or Jean as she is called in the above note and in her father's will, married Esom or Easom Leach, as he is called in his father William Leach's will , on the 29th of December, 1795 ( page 617, Virginia Marriage Records). The ceremony was performed by the Reverend John Alderson, Jr. of Alderson, West Virginia. Elder Alderson also recorded her name as Jane in his records. Records indicate that she adopted Jane as her official name after leaving Virginia in 1812.\n\nAt the time of the Leach's marriage Esom was already the father of a two and a half year old son by the name of William (born May 5, 1793). Esom and Jane had six more children, Susanna, born about 1796, Rebeckey (Rebecca), born 1798, Martha, born 1800-1801, Archibald, born 1802, Reuben, born 1806 and James, born January 16, 1813. All of these children were born in a part of Greenbrier County, Virginia now called Monroe County, West Virginia, with the exception of James who was born in Butler County , Ohio.\n\nEsom and Jane lived on and owned several farms in Monroe County from the time of their marriage to about 1812 when as is claimed by James the family moved to Butler County, Ohio.\n\nSometime before James' birth in 1813 Esom became an \"old school Baptist preacher.\" This event is believed to have occurred about the time of the death of Esom's father William Leach in 1808.\n\nAccording to James Leach, his father Esom died in either in September or October of 1828, in Rush County, Indiana.It has been reported that the cause of Esom's death was by drowning. No confirmation of this event has been found by me and James makes no mention as to the cause of his father's death in his family history.\n\nJames on the other hand gives two years as the date of death for his mother Jane, 1848 or 1850. My choice is 1848 for the following reasons: Jane neither appears in the 1850 census nor1850 mortality schedule for Washington Township,Delaware County, Indiana and it is highly likely she would have been enumerated if her date of death occurred in 1850. Here is what James said about her death in his 1886 version of the Leach Family History. \"My mother dyed in the year of 1848 in the 77th year of her age. She died with cansor on her nose. Eat her open lik and nose in tierly before she dyed. eat all of the nose. She suffered intensly Before she dyed in Delaware county Ind.\""
