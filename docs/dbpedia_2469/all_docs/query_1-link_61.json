The oldest known Leach in our family line is Richard Leach, Sr. The oldest child of Richard would be #1-1. His second child will be #1-2. His third child #1-3. This would signify: First the generation #1, second the child number in that generation. The oldest child of Richard’s oldest child will be #2-1-1. The second child of Richard’s oldest child will be #2-1-2. This should identify what generation and which child. I am sure I will not have all ages or descendants correct but will list them as my records reflect.\n\nTo further clarify the numbering system. Using the number #3-4-2-5. this would be the third generation of Richard Leach, Sr.’s fourth child, John H. Leach. Then, second child of John H. Leach, Elizabeth Leach. Then Elizabeth’s fifth child, Mary Polly Leach. The same identification system will be used for all other families herein until they become Leach descendants, then the Leach numbering system will be used.\n\nTHE LEACH FAMILY IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS, THEIR ANCESTORS, DESCENDANTS AND KINDRED\n\nThe first Leach to settle in Northwest Arkansas was Thomas Leach, #1-3. Thomas came to Washington County, Arkansas, with his wife, Ruth Renshaw, their five sons and daughter, settling on Bush Creek, South of Lincoln about 1828. Thomas was the son of a North Carolina Planter, Richard Leach, Sr., who was born in Maryland in the 1750’s. Early Maryland records are scarce, many courthouses having been burned by the invading British army in the War of 1812. There was, however, a short family history written by Zadock Leach Vl, a North Carolina resident, when he was in his eighties. In making his two page history sound creditable he says his Grandfather Zadock, Leach, lV, had in his possession the Leach family German Bible when he came to North Carolina but that it was later lost or destroyed. Zadock Leach, lV, was a brother to Richard Leach, Sr. In the history Zadock, Vl, stated that the Leach family sailed from Scotland to Germany in the 1600’s. That shortly after 1700 they sailed from Germany to what is now the United States, settling on the Potomac River in Maryland twelve miles from what is now Washington D.C. His history reports that the father of the Leach family died and was buried at sea during the crossing. Based on Zadock, Vl, short history, The father of Richard Leach, Sr., would have been Zadock Leach, lll. Since only fifty years passed between the time the father of the Leach family died at sea and the birth of Zadock Leach, lV, The name of the father of the Leach family who died at sea was probably Zadock, but that can not be determined with any certainty.\n\nThe earliest Maryland record I find for Richard Leach, Sr., is his service in the Maryland Militia during the American Revolution. Richard’s service was in the 7th Co., Middle Battalion of the Montgomery County Militia. The second record is his marriage to Elizabeth Hulen, 31 January 1784, Wilkes County, North Carolina. Richard Leach, Sr., Homesteaded property on the Yadkin River in Rowan County North Carolina in 1785, after that date records of Richard are plentiful.\n\nOther Leach families who homesteaded property contiguous to Richard were his brothers James, Benjamin and Zaddoch, lV. Richard and his three brothers each named a son John. This would probably be a good research key in looking for a recent common ancestor, his name would no doubt be John. The portion of Rowan County where Richard Leach lived became Davie County before his death.\n\nElizabeth Hulen, #1-2, who married Richard Leach, Sr., was the daughter of William Hulen, born 20 January 1730 in Bristol Parish, Virginia, and Elisibeth Beckneil born about 1753 in Virginia. William Hulen died 25 October 1785, Wilkes County, North Carolina.\n\nChildren of William Hulen and Elisabeth Beckneil\n\n#1-1. Milly Hulen born about 1765 in Wilkes County, North Carolina, married William Leach, 14 June 1781.\n\n#1-2.

Sarah Hulen, born about 1783, Wilkes County, North Carolina, and\n\n#1-7. Thomas Hulen, both about 1785, Wilkes County, North Carolina.\n\nRICHARD LEACH, Sr.\n\nRichard Leach, Sr., born in the 1750’s in Maryland died 9 November1841, Davie County, North Carolina. It’s exciting to imagine the life and times of Richard and the people he no doubt came in contact with daily. One of the neighbors owning property adjoining Richard was Squire Boon, the father of Daniel Boon. One can but imagine the conversations that might have occurred at community gatherings regarding Daniel’s travels and adventures. Most researchers put the death of Elizabeth Hulen as being some time in the later part of 1841. Both Richard and Elizabeth were buried in Davie County, North Carolina. Most information on the family of Richard Leach, Sr., would have been difficult, if not impossible, to find had it not been for the probate of his will in Davie County, North Carolina.\n\nChildren of Richard Leach, Sr., and Elizabeth Hulen\n\n#1-1.

Henry was born about 1785. Both Sarah and Henry died between the time when the 1820 and 1830 census was taken; they were living on the Forks of the Yadkin Township, Rowan County, North Carolina.

Little is known about the early years of Thomas’ life. During the War of 1812 he served in active duty with the North Carolina Militia. After the war Thomas married Ruth Renshaw, 25 October, 1814. Ruth was the daughter of Elijah Renshaw. The Renshaw’s were neighbors to Richard Leach, Sr. After the birth of their first child in 1815, Thomas and Ruth moved to Rutherford County, Tennessee, where other family members had previously settled. Thomas, Ruth and their three sons moved on to Jackson County, Alabama about 1822. In 1828, Thomas and Ruth moved again, this time to Arkansas. Their family had now grown to five sons and one daughter. Thomas’ family came to Northwest Arkansas by Steamboat. They came up the Arkansas River to Van Buren. At Van Buren they went North across the mountain where a roadway had just recently been opened by way of Post, then on to Bush Valley South of Lincoln where Thomas homesteaded in 1829. One of Ruth’s Sisters, Elizabeth Renshaw West and her husband Thomas West, who had been in Jackson County, Alabama, when Thomas and Ruth were there, homesteaded in Washington County not too far from Thomas and Ruth. It is not known if they came to Northwest Arkansas with Thomas and Ruth or not. Ruth was born, 22 February 1795 Rowan County, North Carolina and died, 31 August 1848, Washington County, Arkansas. Thomas died 27 August 1879 in Benton County. after the death of Ruth, Thomas married Delila (Taylor) Culberson. Thomas was a Methodist and a Mason.\n\nChildren of Thomas L.

John and Hulda move on to new land being opened up in West Illinois, which later became St. Clair County. Another John Leach, a cousin, had settled there previously.

Britian must have been well trusted and respected. When a dispute rose over the Richard Leach, Sr., Estate his nieces and nephews located in Illinois all appointed him power of attorney to represent them in the Court hearings.

Mumford was born 1808, Rowan County, North Carolina and died in 1865, Davie County, North Carolina. Mumford was a cabinet maker and must not have impressed his father in law. In Richard Leach, Sr.’s will all property to the benefit of Temperance was left to a guardian to administer use and distribution. Temperance later challenged this in the Probate Court and got it changed. Temperance and children were still in Davie County in 1870.\n\nChildren of Temperance Leach and Mumford Bean\n\n#2-9-1.
