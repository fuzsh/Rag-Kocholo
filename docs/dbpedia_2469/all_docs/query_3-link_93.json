        "text": "Kenneth Leach was born on February 18, 1944 and passed away on November 25, 2022 after 18 years with Alzheimer’s. Kenneth spent his career in the produce industry, starting in the San Francisco Produce market, moving to Monterey Mushrooms and ending with doing Retail Produce in Utah. Kenny never met a stranger and was never forgotten by anyone who met him. He loved golf, a good vodka tonic, joking about anything and a good card game, particularly (or especially) Pinochle. He loved the 49ners and he never missed a game. He loved summers in Wyoming at Mike and Vickki’s sitting under the trees and enjoying a good drink with his daughter Vickki. He also enjoyed going for rides with Mike and playing with Tyler. Kenneth loved being a grandfather and really liked it when Tyler was old enough to drive him around. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Phyllis Barker Leach, daughter, Vickki Ann Cantrell, brother, David Leach, parents; John and Ruth Leach and brother in life, Jerry Fisher. Kenneth is survived by his wife, Denise Manfre Leach, son in law, Michael Cantrell, grandchildren, Tyler Cantrell Keeley and her husband Michael Keeley. He is also survived by his great granddaughter, Elli Mae Keeley, his brother John (Anne) Leach; and his brother in laws and sister in laws; Michael and Kim Manfre, John and Mary Manfre, Gary and Kristi Manfre, Steve and Debbie Barker, Patti Leach, and many nieces and nephews. In honor of Kenny’s love of life and sports Denise is requesting everyone to wear a 49ner’s shirt or your favorite team’s shirt or color. There will also be a binder upon entering the church for anyone to place a written story about Kenny. This will be with him for eternity, so he has all your fun stories with him. If you are unable to attend, please feel free to email to Denise at kdleach90@gmail.com Mass will be held on Tuesday, January 10, 2023 at Valley Catholic Church at 1:00 PM with burial to follow at Valley Catholic Cemetery.
