        "text": "First Lieutenant Elden Leach Junior was a torpedo-bomber pilot with VMTB-232 – the “Red Devils” of Cactus Air Force fame. He flew a TBF Avenger in combat, usually with Sergeant John D. Comeau on the radio and PFC Joseph J. Pereira manning the turret guns.\n\nAfter a tough tour of duty in the Solomon Islands, Leach and crew were sent to Sydney, Australia for a well-earned rest. Their return flight was made via South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT) aboard an aircraft assigned to the 403rd Troop Carrier Group. On 23 November 1943, Douglas C-47 Skytrain 41-18675 (call-sign “675-Baker-253”) departed from Noumea with 25 men aboard – mostly “Red Devils” on their way back to Espiritu Santo. The plane failed to respond to a scheduled call at 0910, and when it did not arrive at its destination a massive search was launched.\n\nTwo days later, wreckage and some personal effects were found floating in Nakety Bay off the coast of New Caledonia. The pieces were identified as belonging to the Skytrain, but none of the bodies were ever recovered. All on board were reported as “died, non-combat.”"
