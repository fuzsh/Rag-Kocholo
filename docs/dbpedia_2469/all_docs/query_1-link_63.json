        "text": "Litchfield Twp. -\n\nMILES LEACH, farmer, P. O. Litchfield; was the fifth of a family of nine children. His father's name was Benoni Leach, whose ancestors came from Wales. Three of his grandfather's brothers served in the Revolutionary war. In his younger days, he helped his father in his occupations and worked every hard. After coming of age, he sold the clocks manufactured by North, in Connecticut, traveling principally in the State of Pennsylvania. He came into this State via Cleveland, and bought his present farm of one hundred acres, paying $6 per acre for it. There were only two and a half acres of slashing done on the place and he has improved it to its present high state of cultivation by great industry and toil; his farm buildings are of the substantial sort, and no one has a better right to be proud of his achievements than Mr. Leach. He is independent in thought, so far as religious subjects are concerned, and believes truth should be taught in preference to creeds and dogmas. He was married in Litchfield, Ohio, in 1843, to Miss Martha E. Bradley, who was born in Suffield, Conn., July 8, 1817. Their children were William E., born Apr. 2, 1844, who left the college in Oberlin, Ohio, and enlisted for one hundred days in the army, but, during what is known as Early's raid upon the capital, he was wounded, and died in front of Ft. Stevens, Washington, D. C., July 11, 13, 1864. Thus fell the eldest of the family, in his young manhood, for his devotion to the old flag. Harvey E., born Aug. 13, 1845; Byron B., born May 2, 1851, and died Nov. 4, 1851; Harvey E., who married Miss Matilda Kinney, who was born in La Fayette Township, this county, Jan. 8, 1850; they were married Sept. 26, 1871. Their children are Willis E., born July 24, 1874; Orra L., born June 29, 1876; Carrie E., born Aug. 10, 1879. He takes an active interest in the temperance question, and has held for two terms the position of President of the Temperance Children Union Association of Litchfield Township.\n\nSource: History of Medina County, Ohio - Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers - 1881 ~ Page 746 O. N. LEACH, clothing and gents' furnishing goods, Medina; was born in Sullivan, Ashland Co., Ohio, in 1841. In 1858, he entered the Preparatory Department of Oberlin College, and remained there until 1860. He then engaged as clerk in the general merchandising business of Baldwin, Laundon & Co.; in 1868, he formed the partnership of Fitch & Leach, they doing a clothing and gents' furnishing goods business. July 16, 1866, he married Miss Electa Fitch, a native of Cuyahoga Co., Ohio. They had four children, of whom two are living- Frank H. and Florence A. In 1872, Mr. Leach came to Medina, and opened business in the Empire Block, and later moved to the Dental Block, but, not having sufficient space to accommodate his trade, in the fall of 1878, built his present brick store, thus securing an elegant room, 24Â½x80 feet, in which he has placed a mammoth stock. Prominent among the many advantages he offers the trade, is his one-price cash system, which unites satisfaction and cheapness for the buyer. Mr. Leach has also an admirably managed custom department that cannot fail to be appreciated by all who love a snug fit.\n\nSource: History of Medina County, Ohio - Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers - 1881 ~ Page 693 Homer Twp. -\n\nHOMER LEE, farmer; P. O. Albion, Wayne Co.; was born in the latter county Jan. 23, 1833, and was married, Oct. 9, 1856, to Miss Maranda R. Tanner, who was born July 19, 1839. Their children were named Sarah J., born Oct. 4, 1857; Rosa M., Apr. 19, 1859, died Feb. 26, 1862; Cora B., Jan. 15, 1865; Lillie G., Jan. 26, 1877; Sarah J., now Mrs. Aaron Swartz, married Dec. 6, 1877; they have one child - Lucius L. Swartz, born Jan. 31, 1879. Mr. Lee went to California in 1852, during the gold fever excitement, taking the overland route and traveling in the saddle or with the wagon train. It took them three months to make the trip, halting a week at Salt Lake City to recruit their teams. They were threatened on the way by Indians, who were probably more in search of plunder than a fight. At this time, they were joined by another train, and, by coralling their teams and protecting themselves as best they could, they passed a very disagreeable night, waiting for the expected attack. Morning came, and they were left to pursue their way unmolested, with the exception fo losing some of their stock. They entered the Golden State at Hangtown, now called Placerville. He worked in the mines in various parts of the State, remaining there three years, coming home via the Nicaragua route, landing safely in New York, and arriving home by way of Cleveland. Mr. Lee has been living in Homer Township for twenty-four years, on what used to be called the Albro farm of 80 acres, but has made additions from time to time, until now he owns 181 acres of good land, making a farm of which he may well be proud, as he is pleasantly situated and surrounded with home comforts of no ordinary degree. His father, Josiah Lee, living in Albion, Wayne Co., was born in the State of Connecticut, Thompson Township. Oct. 14, 1796, and moved to the State of New York, with his father in 1798. He married Miss Agnes Lafler Nov. 3, 1816, and came to this State in 1819, settling in Jackson Township. There were no improvements on the land he entered, and no roads but as they cleared them between here and Cleveland, coming by way of Medina, which then could boast of one solitary log house and another in process of construction. Before they reached the future county seat, it grew quite dark and threatened rain. Turning the oxen loose to browse in the slashing, they sought the log house for shelter, but were lost in the darkness of the stormy night. Their loud halloos were finally heard, and they were kindly taken in and cared for by the pioneer's family. They reached Wayne Co. in due time, and entered 320 acres of land, at $2 per acre. Mr. John Mason, three-fourths of a mile east, was their only neighbor, and Wooster the nearest post office. Their children were John H., born Mar. 14, 1818, died Aug. 17, 1822; Phoebe, Nov. 24, 1819, died Aug. 11, 1822; James, Apr. 30, 1822; Josiah, Jul. 2, 1824, died Aug. 20, 1851; Elizabeth, Mar. 23, 1826; Jacob, Jul. 12, 1828, died Oct. 23, 1853; David B., Oct. 21, 1830; Robert, Jan. 23, 1833; Oliver, Jan. 9, 1836; Lucene, Feb. 7, 1839 (now Mrs. G. M. Reed); Elizabeth married Mr. P. C. Bunt; George, Jul. 14, 1841, died Dec. 15, 1854. Mrs. Agnes Lee died Apr. 8, 1860, and on Jan. 26, 1868, Mr. Lee married Phoebe Smith. They had one child - Jessie, born Dec. 6, 1869; she died Mar. 2, 1878. Three of the brothers were in the army during the war of the rebellion. David enlisted in Co. B, 4th O. V. C., and served in the Army of the Potomac until the battle of Gettysburg, where he was wounded in the right hand. Soon after, he was honorably discharged from the service, but, upon the wound healing, he again enlisted in the 178th O. V. I., and served to the end of the war, participating in the great battle of Murfreesboro and many skirmishes between Nashville and the front. James enlisted in Co. K, 102d O. V. I., and served for three years. Oliver enlisted in the same regiment and company (Capt. J. M. Sloan's), and was in the battles of Decatur, Ala., Stevenson, Perryville, Frankfort, etc.\n\nSource: History of Medina County, Ohio - Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers - 1881 ~ Page 920 Brunswick Twp. -\n\nPETER LEISTER, farmer; P.

This gentleman's ancestry is traced back to a prisoner in one of hte wars in Denmark, who was exiled to the British Islands, and settled in Scotland. After several generations, the family moved to England, this time settling in Hull, Yorkshire, on the property known as the Cockgrove Farm. Mr. George Life, grandfather of hte subject of this biography, married Miss Ann Swinglehurst, the last descendant of the generation of the Helms and Hays families. They had owned and occupied the ancient property known as St. Johns of Jerusalem, a freehold landed property, which descended to the Life family by the marriage as mentioned above, and which is still held by them. Mr. John Life, the father of our subject, was born in the northern part of Yorkshire, England, and came to this country in 1854, and settled in the township of Royalton, Cuyahoga Co., Ohio. He was born in 1805, and was, by occupation, a farmer and shoemaker. He was known and respected as an honest and industrious citizen, strictly moral and conscientious in all his intercourse with his fellow-men. He married Miss MAry Bramley, of Lancashire, England, was was born in 1803, and they were married in 1830. Their children were James, Mary Ann (now Mrs. Isaac Gifford, of Cuyahoga Co., Ohio), Swinglehurst and Richard. Mr. John Life died Nov. 10, 1879, in the triumph of a faith in Christ. Mr. James Life was born Feb. 15, 1829, in Bury, Lancashire, England, and married Miss Susan Barefoot, of Oxford. They were married at Preswich, Lancashire, Aug. 29, 1854, and, for a wedding tour, the day after, set sail for the United States, and, after a safe sea voyage, settled in Royalton, Cuyahoga Co. Their children are William, born Sept. 12, 1855; Emily, born Mar. 17, 1857; Henry, born June 1, 1859; Arthur Helm, June 10, 1861, and Celestia, born Aug. 20, 1865. Mr. Life, while in England, served as an attendant and nurse in the Preswich Hospital under the celebrated Dr. Joseph Holland and Dr. Willson, of Paris. It was while there he became proficient in the use of drugs and in the care of the sick. This enabled him to render his adopted country good and efficient service during the war, as he went south in the fall of 1862, as a volunteer Hospital Steward under Drs. Harvey and Flack, of Illinois. The first service rendered was at the battle of Perryville, and here his experience in the English hospital was very valuable to this country, as there was a scarcity of educated help, and, night and day, he was busy dressing the wounded and caring for those in his charge. The battles of Lebanon and Murfreesboro followed, while the work of the hospital attendants was very severe and arduous. The soldiers whom he had relieved appreciated this, and in some of the newspapers published their thanks to Mr. Life for his kindness and devotion to the sick and wounded in his care. Mr. Life engaged in the drug business for some two years, and then went into the general merchandise business at Royalton, moving to Litchfield Aug. 1, 1880, where he now conducts the same business with the help of his sons. His thoughts and ideas of both religious and politics are of the liberal, progressive kind, and he has always lent a helping hand to the permanent reforms of the day, and toward such enterprises as help build up society and benefit the town in which he lives.\n\nSource: History of Medina County, Ohio - Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers - 1881 ~ Page Page 746 Brunswick Twp. -\n\nEPHRAIM LINDLY, farmer; P. O. Brunswick; whose portrait has been selected and appears in connection with the history of Brunswick as a fit representative of the old pioneers, were born in Rutland, Vt., Sept. 16, 1796, and is the son of Abia and Nancy (POwer) Lindly. So far back as we are able to give it the genealogy of his father's people, only reaches to the grandfather of the subject of this sketch. Jacob Lindly, his grandfather, was a soldier in the Revolutionary war. His married Mindwell Pond, and they reared a family of ten children, three daughters and seven sons. Abia, one of the latter, was the father of Ephraim. He was a loyal citizen, and served his country in the war of 1812. In 1802, he, with his wife, went to Connecticut, where they remained until 1811. They then came West, and settled in the Western Reserve. This trip was made overland in a two wheeled cart, drawn by a yoke of oxen, and one horse, driven at tandem. They were two months on the journey. Ephraim attained only a common0school education, he being obliged to spend much of his early life helping his father to clear land. On his mother's side, National Power, her grandfather, was born in Cumberland, R. I., June 23, 1748. He died Apr. 17, 1835, in Lenox, Penn., in his 89th year. Lucy Tingly, the wife of Nathaniel Power, was born in Attleboro, Mass., in 1758, and was married to Nathaniel Power on Nov. 29, 1774; Nancy Power, daughter of Nathaniel and Lucy, was born in Attleboro, Mass., on Dec. 15, 1777, and was married to Abia Lindly, on Jan. 1, 1794, in Kingsbury, N. Y. In October, 1816, Ephraim Lindly became a resident of Brunswick Township, and, in 1821, he was married to Miss Mary Crittenden, who is a native of Massachusetts. Their beginning in life was under difficulties to be overcome, requiring the stoutest hearts and the most willing of hands. Few of the present generation, who are residents of Brunswick Township, can comprehend the loneliness of their little cabin home in a vast wilderness, surrounded by wild animals and Indians. Yet, under these difficulties, they have in the years of their residence in Brunswick, builded for themselves a home and a reputation that stands as a monument to their honesty and industry. Mr. Lindly has been a member of the M. E. Church for about half a century. For the past forty years, he has been Superintendent of the M. E. Sabbath school connected with his church. He was also elected a delegate to the Annual Conference held in Wooster, Ohio. The citizens have honored him with the office of Township Trustee. They have reared a family of six children, named as follows: Julia, now wife of James O. Johnson; Mary, now wife of David S. Safford; Rachel, now wife of Edward Hulet; John W., George E. and Francis W. The latter, who married Miss Hattie M. Stevens, has taken a very active part in the prosperity of the M. E. Church and Sabbath school, in which he has been elected Steward and Recording Steward for the Brunswick Circuit. He was born in 1839, and now lives with his father. During the war of the rebellion, he served his country nobly in the 103d O. V. I., C. K. While in the battle of Kenesaw Mountain, he was wounded, by which misfortune he lost one of its limbs.\n\nSource: History of Medina County, Ohio - Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers - 1881 ~ Page 766 Brunswick Twp.\n\nHANNAH M.
