Most of the cemeteries in the county are maintained by volunteers.\n\nThe History Homepage has a few articles on the history of Wirt County.\n\nThe School Homepage has a few articles on Wirt County Schools.\n\nI came across a few pictures, likely from the families of Noffsinger, Stukey, Reeder, Moore, Archer, Lockhart, Burton, Low, Sheppard, Bowers, Sheets or others of the Limestone Area (Tucker District, Wirt County; Steele District (Rockport), Wood County; or Sandyville, Jackson County).\n\nI hope the information and pictures you find here are useful. If you have any questions, information or would like copies of the pictures please contact Mark."
