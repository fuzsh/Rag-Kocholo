Born in a field with the gate open in Cobden, Ontario, George Leach passed suddenly on May 9, 2024, at the age of 87. As a young man, George moved to Manotick, where he met his beloved wife Gail on a blind date. They found success in love and life, moving their family of 4 children, Julie (Paul), Holly (Peter), Merydie (Joe), and Rob (Anna-Marie), to Brampton, then Edmonton, before finally settling in Caledon, Ontario, as a proud employee of the Ford Motor Company. Predeceased by siblings Graham, Annie, and William, and his wife Gail. Following Gail‘s death, George was lucky to find love a second time with Sheila Shields. George is remembered by his grandchildren, Sally, Lucas, Erica, Maddie, AJ, Samantha, Allison, and William, and his four great-grandchildren. George leaves us with a lasting memory of a true gentleman; a charming and honourable man who made lifelong friends wherever he went.
