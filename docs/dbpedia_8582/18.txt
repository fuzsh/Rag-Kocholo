the question has been asked many times, but as far as I can tell, answers always depend on the concrete situation.

I intend to release an open-source project written in C# on GitLab soon, and I am afraid of unintentionally breaking 3rd party dependency licensing requirements.

The project uses the following NuGet packages:

MaterialDesignThemes & MaterialDesignColors by James Willock licensed under MIT PDFsharp-MigraDoc by empira Software GmbH licensed under MIT DocumentFormat.OpenXml by Microsoft licensed under MIT

I have not modified any code of the aforementioned NuGet packages.

Is it correct to assume that I need to include an MIT-license file for each package, or can I simply include one, as all are unmodified copies of the MIT license?

In any case, next to my own LICENSE file, I would include a NOTICE file containing the information about the packages from the formatted paragraph above. As I will also include binary releases every now and again I would also need to include my own LICENSE file, all MIT-licenses as well as the NOTICE file.

Would that be the correct way to comply with the MIT license? Am I missing something? I would love to hear your feedback on my poor deduction skills, I just want to be extra careful not to improperly comply to any of the above licenses.

Thanks in advance!
