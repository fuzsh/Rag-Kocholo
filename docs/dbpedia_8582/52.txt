UPD: Applies to the versions of FastReport .NET before 2022.2. License packages are now available on our NuGet server.

NuGet is an open source package management system for Microsoft development platforms (formerly known as NuPack). NuGet is an extension (add-on) for easily adding, removing, and updating libraries and resources in Visual Studio projects based on the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET. NuGet can be run from the command line or using scripts. It supports many programming languages, including packages for the .NET Framework and native packages written in C ++.

A NuGet package is a single ZIP file with a .nupkg extension. This package contains compiled code (DLL), associated files, and a descriptive manifest that includes details like the package’s version number. Developers who want to share their code create packages and publish them to a public or private server. Package consumers receive packages from suitable hosts, use them in their projects, and then call a package’s functionality in their project code. NuGet itself then handles all of the intermediate details.

FastReport products are currently represented by the following packages:

FastReport.Core (demo on nuget.org) - a package with the main logic of the program (obtaining the necessary data, rendering reports, exports, etc.). Some of the functionality from FastReport.NET is missing due to the cross-platform nature of the package. After installation, it is located in the ‘Nugets’ folder.

FastReport.Net (demo on nuget.org) - a package with the FastReport.dll library for .NET Framework 4.x, which is part of part of the ‘Pro’ and ‘Demo’ editions - for .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5 and .NET 6 exclusively for Windows (so-called FastReport.CoreWin). You can read more about this package in this article. After installation, it is located in the ‘Nugets/Windows’ folder.
