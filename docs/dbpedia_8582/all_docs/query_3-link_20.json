        "text": "NuGet is a package manager for .NET development that allows you to publish, share, and consume reusable code packages. NuGet is used to sign packages to provide an additional layer of trust and security when distributing software libraries and components. Most importantly, NuGet maintains a reference list of packages used in a project and the ability to restore and update those packages from that list.\n\nFollow these instructions to sign directly with NuGet and securely reference your private key stored in Software Trust Manager. Alternatively, integrate NuGet with Signing Manager Controller (SMCTL) for simplified signing.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nWindows operating system\n\nDownload and install DigiCertââÂ®ââ Software Trust Manager clients\n\nConfigure your credentials\n\nInstall NuGet\n\nCA chain (only required for private CAs)\n\nInstall sample NuGet package\n\nThis creates a directory with name HelloWorld.\n\nBy default, all packages installed from the NuGet package manager are signed by the repository. You can verify the package with:\n\nnuget install HelloWorld\n\nBy default, all packages installed from the NuGet package manager are signed by the repository. You can verify the package with:\n\nnuget verify -All HelloWorld.1.3.0.17\\*\n\nTrust CA chain\n\nTo sign with a certificate issued from a private CA, the CA chain must be trusted in Windows.\n\nTo download a CA certificate:\n\nSign in to DigiCert ONEÂ®.\n\nNavigate to CA Manager > Manage CAs > Intermediates.\n\nClick on the More actions icon next to the ICA name.\n\nSelect Download certificate.\n\nSync certificates (Windows only)\n\nBefore attempting to sign with Signtool, Mage, and NuGet using the certificate fingerprint, run this command to sync your certificates to the Windows certificate store.\n\nTo sync the default certificate associated with the specified keypair alias:\n\nsmctl windows certsync --keypair-alias=<keypair alias>\n\nNote\n\nFor more information refer to the Windows command manual."
