        "text": "Why Serilog?\n\nLike many other libraries for .NET, Serilog provides diagnostic logging to files, the console, and elsewhere. It is easy to set up, has a clean API, and is portable between recent .NET platforms.\n\nUnlike other logging libraries, Serilog is built with powerful structured event data in mind.\n\nText formatting with a twist\n\nSerilog message templates are a simple DSL extending .NET format strings. Parameters can be named, and their values are serialized as properties on the event for incredible searching and sorting flexibility:\n\nvar position = new { Latitude = 25, Longitude = 134 }; var elapsedMs = 34; log.Information(\"Processed {@Position} in {Elapsed:000} ms.\", position, elapsedMs);\n\nThis example records two properties, Position and Elapsed along with the log event. The properties captured in the example, in JSON format, would appear like:\n\n{\"Position\": {\"Latitude\": 25, \"Longitude\": 134}, \"Elapsed\": 34}\n\nThe @ operator in front of Position tells Serilog to serialize the object passed in, rather than convert it using ToString().\n\nThe :000 segment following Elapsed is a standard .NET format string that affects how the property is rendered. The console sink included with Serilog will display the above message as:\n\n09:14:22 [Information] Processed { Latitude: 25, Longitude: 134 } in 034 ms."
