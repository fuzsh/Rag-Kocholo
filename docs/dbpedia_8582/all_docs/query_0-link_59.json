        "text": ".NET Core projects\n\nYou can quickly create a NuGet package for your .NET or .NET Standard project â right-click the project in the Solution Explorer and choose Advanced Build Actions | Pack Selected Project from context menu. JetBrains Rider will create NuGet packages using the dotnet pack command.\n\nOptionally, you can integrate creating a NuGet package for a project into the project build. To configure this and other NuGet preferences, right-click your .NET Core or .NET Standard project in the solution explorer, choose Properties and then select NuGet in the project properties dialog.\n\n.NET projects targeting .NET Framework\n\nJetBrains Rider does not provide any tools for creating NuGet packages for traditional .NET projects. As soon as you build an assembly from your .NET project, you can use tools such as NuGet Package Explorer or create packages from the command line as described on the Microsoft website."
