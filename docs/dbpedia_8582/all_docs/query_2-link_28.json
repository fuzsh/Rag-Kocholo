        "text": "We provide support for the C# language in all major operating systems. We also provide instructions on how to get your project started in a number of common development environments. Select your operating system and preferred development environment below, and follow the instructions to get your project running with Phidgets.\n\nIf you do not know which development environment you want to use, or your development environment of choice is not listed, we recommend starting with Mono as the simplest path to getting your code running. Visual Studio is the most popular way to build C# projects, but it also has a steep learning curve.\n\nOnce you have set up your development environment to run with Phidgets, we recommend you follow our guide on Phidget Programming Basics. The guide will showcase the fundamentals of programming with Phidgets, with examples in C#.\n\nSetup Guide\n\nQuick Downloads\n\nIf you already know what you're doing and just need the files, you can find them all below.\n\nDocumentation\n\nPhidget22 API (Select C# from drop-down menu)\n\nExample Code\n\nC# Examples\n\nLibraries"
