        "text": "C# is one of the most popular languages used by the developers, which implies it is very productive. To further improve the productivity of using C#, there are a lot of NuGet packages available.\n\nIn this blog, we discuss the 10 best NuGet packages for improving the productivity of developers when using C#:\n\nRestSharp\n\nJson.NET\n\nSerilog\n\nNUnit\n\nInsight.Database\n\nFluentValidation\n\nNoda Time\n\nFluentEmail\n\nHangfire\n\nLazyCache\n\nRestSharp\n\nREST stands for representational state transfer. RestSharp is the most popular HTTP client library for .NET. Using this library, C# developers can easily call remote resources over HTTP, and it takes care of serializing the request body to JSON or XML and deserializing them in the response.\n\nThe RestSharp NuGet package supports:\n\nBoth synchronous and asynchronous requests.\n\nBoth serialization and deserialization.\n\nDifferent HTTP request methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\nA variety of authentications.\n\nTotal downloads: 109.9M\n\nJson.NET\n\nJson.NET is a free and open-source library in .NET with over 1 billion NuGet downloads. Its key features include:\n\nSerializing and deserializing any .NET object to JSON and JSON to .NET object.\n\nConversion between XML and JSON.\n\nUsing LINQ query against JObject, JArray, and JValue objects.\n\n50% faster performance than DataContractJsonSerializer, and 250% faster than JavaScriptSerializer. (reference)\n\nTotal Downloads: 1.6B\n\nSerilog\n\nLogs are records of actions, exceptions, information, and warnings. Logging is an important factor in application development that helps developers to detect and resolve issues easily.\n\nSerilog is a new logging framework used in .NET. It logs custom properties and data in JSON format.\n\nWhen other logging tools provide the log data in unstructured format, Serilog provides structured logs. This also allows developers to easily record configured event data across consoles, files, and all types of storage systems.\n\nTotal downloads: 360.6M\n\nNUnit\n\nTesting plays a major role in software development to ensure the correctness of the code.\n\nNUnit is an open-source unit-testing framework for all .NET languages, which includes C#. With NUnit, you can easily test large applications by breaking them into small modules. It helps us find issues even during the time of development.\n\nTotal downloads: 152.1M\n\nInsight.Database\n\nInsight.Database is a micro-ORM (object-relational mapping) for .NET that translates C# object data to database records and vice versa. It is a set of extension methods that makes handling databases easier in a C# application.\n\nThe primary features of Insight.Database include:\n\nAutomatic open/close of database connections.\n\nEasy execution of stored procedures.\n\nSupport for multiple result sets.\n\nNote: To learn more about Insight.Database, refer to this GitHub page.\n\nTotal downloads: 686.5K\n\nFluentValidation\n\nFluentValidation is a .NET library for building strongly typed validation rules. It uses a Fluent interface and lambda expression to prepare the validation rules. The validation rules help maintain a clean domain code and make it more integrated. Also, it gives you a place to find the verification logic.\n\nFluentValidation has numerous built-in validations such as null check, string empty validation, max length, and min length. It also supports a custom validator, customizing validation messages based on property name, providing messages based on localization, asynchronous validations, and so on.\n\nTotal downloads: 117M\n\nNoda Time\n\nWorking with date-times and time zones in .NET is very painful. Noda Time fills the gap of .NET date-time operation and makes life easier. It gives different APIs to handle UTC, local dates, and local time zones. The clock service functionality easily converts local time to UTC and UTC to local time, thereby avoiding the major mistakes made by developers.\n\nTotal downloads: 45.7M\n\nFluentEmail\n\nFluentEmail is an open-source .NET library that allows you to ingrate email-sending functionality in your .NET application in 10 minutes. Use Razor to design the email templates and send the emails using SendGrid, MailGun, SMTP, and more.\n\nSome of the most common functionalities available on the email object are To, From, CC/BCC, Subject, Body, Attach, UsingTemplate, and SendAsync.\n\nTotal downloads: 1.8M\n\nHangfire\n\nHangfire is an open-source framework that allows you to create, process, and manage background work. You can run your background jobs in the main process of your application without the need for a dedicated service.\n\nHangfire supports a wide variety of background tasks: short-run and long-run, CPU intensive and I/O intensive, one shot and recurrent.\n\nTotal downloads: 18.6M\n\nLazyCache\n\nCaching is a great way to improve the performance of an application. LazyCache uses a GetOrAdd format for caching, where you request an item from cache while providing the functionality to add it if the item is missing.\n\nLazyCache is highly suitable for caching database calls, complex object graph building routines, and web service calls that may need to be stored temporarily for performance. It allows items to be cached for more or less time, but by default it saves the cached items for up to 20 minutes.\n\nKey features of LazyCache are:\n\nIt is thread-safe and concurrency-ready.\n\nAsync compatible: lazy single evaluation of async delegates using the GetOrAddAsync() method.\n\nTotal downloads: 7.1M\n\nConclusion\n\nThanks for reading!
