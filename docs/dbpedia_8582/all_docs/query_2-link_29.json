        "text": "The Ultimate List of C# Tools: IDEs, Profilers, Automation Tools, and More\n\nC# is a widely used programming language in enterprises, especially for those that are heavily Microsoft-dependent. This language comprises a lot of tools with individual strengths. Here, we list C# tools for IDEs, profilers, automation tools, and more.\n\nIf you build apps using C#, you most likely use Visual Studio and have explored some of its extensions to supercharge your development. However, this list of C# tools might just change the way you write C# code for good.\n\nBest tools for C# programming in the following categories:\n\nIDEs\n\nVS Extensions\n\nMiscellaneous Tools\n\nDecompilers & Code Conversion Tools\n\nBuild Automation & Merge Tools\n\nVersion Control\n\nTesting Tools\n\nProfilers\n\nAPM\n\nDeployment Automation\n\nContainerization\n\nUse the links above to jump to tools in a specific section, or keep reading to browse the complete list.\n\nIDEs\n\n1. Visual Studio\n\n@VisualStudio\n\nVisual Studio is the flagship IDE for C# developers—even though, of course, it also supports other languages in the .NET ecosystem. It’s incredibly powerful, offering a myriad of features while, at the same time, being very approachable for newcomers and veterans alike. Also, Visual Studio is also extensible—through the use of extensions, you can augment its capabilities, tailoring it to your specific needs.\n\nVisual Studio is currently in its 2022 edition, and it comes in three versions:\n\nVisual Studio Community: free for open-source development and commercial use for up to 5 developers (in organizations with less than 250 people and which don’t make 1 million dollars of revenue per year.)\n\nVisual Studio Professional: paid version for developers\n\nVisual Studio Enterprise: paid version with powerful features aimed at architectural concerns\n\nKey Features:\n\nPublication of your app to several destinations\n\nEasy integration with other developer tools by Microsoft (e.g., MS SQL Server.)\n\nPowerful debug capabilities\n\nCreation and management of containerized applications\n\nSeamless integration with unit test frameworks\n\nAs we’ve said, Visual Studio is an excellent choice if you want a powerful IDE for C#. However, it does require a decent machine to run it, and it can feel sluggish at times. What if you prefer a more lightweight alternative?\n\nThat brings us to the next item on our list.\n\n2. Visual Studio Code\n\n@code\n\nVisual Studio Code isn’t technically a C# IDE—or even an IDE, for that matter. Rather, Visual Studio Code (or simply VS Code) is an incredibly popular code editor you can use with pretty much any of the major programming languages. VS Code supports plenty of languages through the usage of plugins and extensions. You can use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension for powerful editing, plus full support for C# IntelliSense and debugging.\n\nKey Features:\n\nExcellent auto-complete with context-aware suggestions\n\nBuilt-in Git integration for better version control\n\nHuge list of extensions to further enhance the platform\n\nSupports Mac, Linux, Windows, etc\n\nEasily works with Software Configuration Management providers\n\nEasily runs on Node JS\n\n3. MonoDevelop\n\nDeveloped by Xamarin, MonoDevelop has many similar features as VS Code and also supports cross-platform development. With MonoDevelop, you can quickly write desktop and web applications on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.\n\nKey Features:\n\nStandard features like code completion and debugging\n\nAlso ships with Unity, a game engine, which enables advanced C# programming for apps like video games\n\nCode completion support for C#\n\nCode templates and code folding\n\nSupports multiple languages\n\n[adinserter block=”33″]\n\n4. Rider\n\n@JetBrainsRider\n\nRider is a cross-platform .NET IDE tool from the comprehensive JetBrains suite of products. The tool works perfectly on the IntelliJ platform and ReSharper.\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntegrates seamlessly with other JetBrains products\n\n2000+ code checks\n\nHundreds of context actions and refactoring\n\nSupport for the Unity game engine\n\nSupports both .NET Framework and .NET Core\n\nAllows developer to split editor either horizontally or vertically\n\nBuilt-in support with TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Sass\n\nSupports Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms\n\nVisual Studio Extensions\n\n5.
