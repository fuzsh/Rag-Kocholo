Learn More.\n\nC# is a general-purpose, object-oriented, and multi-paradigm programming language used for building applications for different technologies including .Net, Unity, Xamarin, and more. C# is built by Microsoft and is widely used for web app development, Windows applications, driver software, and video games.\n\nAs developers will be aware, IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, which is a set of tools – like code editor, debugger, and build automation features – that are used for software development and enhancement.\n\nTop C# IDEs\n\nThis developer tool review will highlight some of the trending IDEs and code editors for programming in 2022. They are not listed in any particular order.\n\n1. Visual Studio Code\n\nFor C# software development, Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular IDEs used by programmers. This is an open-source text editor and IDE developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for languages like C#, Typescript, JavaScript, and Node.JS. Moreover, it also provides IntelliSense and auto-completion features based on module names, variables types, and function definitions.\n\nKey features of Visual Studio Code IDE:\n\nSupport for multi-platforms like macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\nThe IDE is highly customizable and extensible by importing extensions (themes, debuggers, languages, additional services, etc.) from the the Visual Studio Marketplace.\n\nFeatures for working with Node.js.\n\nBuilt-in code-refactoring and debugging tools.\n\nEasy configuration with Git and other version control systems.\n\nSupports almost every programming language, including Go, JSON, HTML, C++, Java,\n\nPython, and more. Extensions are available for most major languages that do not have built-in support.\n\nRead: Visual Studio Code Extensions for Higher Productivity\n\n2. Rider IDE\n\nRider is a cross-platform C# IDE from JetBrains that works with the IntelliJ platform and ReSharper.\n\nKey features of Rider Code Editor:\n\nSupports all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux\n\nDesigned to work well with .NET and .NET Core.\n\nBuilt-in support for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, and Bootstrap.\n\nYou can also work on SQL databases without leaving the Rider application.\n\nUnit testing is made easy with unit testing tools like NUnits, xUnit.net, and so on.\n\nSupports most .NET programming languages, including C#, VB.NET, F#, and Razor, as well as, XML, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, and CSS.\n\nAutomatically detects and highlights compile errors, runtime errors, and other coding issues.\n\nRead: Debugging Tools for C#\n\n3. Visual Studio\n\nVisual Studio is the most popular IDE and software development tool for building .NET applications using C#. It is a product from Microsoft that is also very popular among developers who build applications using the .NET ecosystem.\n\nKey features of Visual Studio:\n\nVisual Studio is used for building web applications, websites, mobile applications, Windows applications, and video games.\n\nSupports more than 30 programming languages.\n\nYou can extend the functionality of Visual Studio by installing third-party extensions and tools via the Visual Studio Marketplace.\n\nComes with built-in Agile project planning tools and charts.\n\nIncreased productivity via the CodeLens feature, which displays code references, code changes, and last modified methods all from the text editor.\n\nCollaboration tools that support a DevOps approach, thanks to Azure DevOps (for Professional subscribers). These include source control management, artifact repositories, and CI/CD platforms.\n\nRead: Top Project Management Tools for .NET and C# Developers\n\n4. SlickEdit\n\nSlickEdit is a cross-platform code editor with support for more than 50 programming languages. With SlickEdit, you can bring increased productivity to your code, thanks in part to the ability to easily integrate and sync your work with different version control tools, including Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, and CVS.\n\nKey features of SlickEdit IDE:\n\nSupport for multiple platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.\n\nQuickly spot the errors in programs by using the built-in compiler and debugger.\n\nSupport for various version control system tools, including Shelving and DiffZilla.\n\nComes with Standard and Pro editions.

The code editor was created to provide a similar set of features as that of Visual Studio Code.\n\nKey features of Monodevelop:\n\nSupport for multi-operating systems.\n\nCode auto-completion features for C#, plus code templates and code folding.\n\nEasy debugging features thanks to a built-in debugger.\n\nOther built-in tools include those that help with source control, makefile integration, unit testing, and packaging.\n\nSimple interface, making coding more efficient and giving developers an easier learning curve than Visual Studio.\n\nWorks well with many programming languages, including C#, F#, Visual Basic, and Vala.\n\nBuilt-in GTK# visual designer.\n\nIntegrates well with third-party tools and databases including MS SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.\n\nRead: How to Install and Configure Microsoft Visual Code for C#\n\n6. Scriptcs\n\nScriptcs is a lightweight text editor that allows programmers to code in C# with ease, avoiding the sometimes clunkiness of more robust IDEs. You can also execute scripts in Scriptcs simply by switching to ‘Javascript’ in the scripts environment settings.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAllows C# programmers to hop right in and start coding without having to create a new environment or project.\n\nHelps to bootstrap the environment for script execution and reduces the amount of code required to integrate C# frameworks.\n\nThe text editor lets developers easily manage dependencies in C# applications using NuGet.\n\nSyntax highlighting.\n\n7. DevExpress\n\nDevExpress is an IDE for C# programmers that grants access to a bevy of developer tools and frameworks, all targeted at helping coders create robust and interactive .NET applications. With DevExpress, you can build applications that feature high-impact user experiences using sets of controls for Windows Desktop, Web, Xamarin, and Maui. The toolset also helps programmers create applications – and further support those apps – with analytics dashboards and decision support systems.\n\nKey features of DevExpress:\n\nReporting and analytics tools.\n\nSupport for Office API and PDF API.\n\nSupports fully integrated suite of UI components like Analytics dashboard and decision support systems,\n\nDesktop UI components, web components, business intelligence dashboards, and testing/QA features.\n\nCross-platform application development for .NET, Xamarin, and .NET Maui.\n\nSupport for multiple frameworks, including XAF, XPO, .NET Security API, and CodeRush for VS.\n\nConclusion to Top C# IDEs in 2022\n\nOdds are, you are happy with your current IDE and do not want to switch, but a good developer should always keep an eye out for tools that will let them code with higher efficiency and increase coding productivity. At the end of the day, the best IDE is the one that matches your coding habits and those of your software development team."
