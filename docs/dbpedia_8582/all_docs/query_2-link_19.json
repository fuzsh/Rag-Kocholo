Because too many functions can’t be found in the corresponding code in the .Net SDK. NumSharp is the C# version of NumPy, which is as consistent as possible with the NumPy programming interface, including function names and parameter locations. By introducing the NumSharp tool library, you can easily convert from python code to C# code. Here is a comparison code between NumSharp and NumPy (left is python, right is C#):\n\nIf you want to read some more informations, we start a doc on https://scisharp.github.io/NumSharp/.\n\nNumSharp has implemented the arange, array, max, min, reshape, normalize, unique interfaces. More and more interfaces will be added to the library gradually. If you want to use .NET to get started with machine learning, NumSharp will be your best tool library.\n\nImplemented APIs\n\nThe NumPy class is a high-level abstraction of NDArray that allows NumSharp to be used in the same way as Python's NumPy, minimizing API differences caused by programming language features, allowing .NET developers to maximize Utilize a wide range of NumPy code resources to seamlessly translate python code into .NET code.\n\nCheck the code: src\\NumSharp.Core\\APIs\n\nHow to use\n\nusing NumSharp;\n\n// create a vector var nd = np.arange(12) // create a matrix nd = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4); // access data by index var data = nd[1, 1]; // create a tensor nd = np.arange(12).reshape(2, 3, 2); // get the 2nd vector in the 1st dimension data = n[new Shape(1)]; // get the 3rd vector in the (axis 1, axis 2) dimension data = n[new Shape(1, 2)]; // interate ndarray foreach (data in nd) { // data is a ndarray or a value }\n\nInstall NumSharp in NuGet\n\nPM> Install-Package NumSharp\n\nHow to make docs\n\nDownload docfx and put on PATH → https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases\n\ndocfx ./docfx_project/docfx.json -o ./docs\n\nHow to run benchmark\n\nC: \\> dotnet NumSharp.Benchmark.dll nparange\n\nReference the documents generated by DocFX.\n\nReference the documents host on readthedocs.io.\n\nNumSharp is referenced by:\n\nPandas.NET\n\nSciSharp-Learn\n\nTensorFlow.NET\n\nBigtree.MachineLearning\n\nCherubNLP\n\nBotSharp\n\nYou might also be interested in NumSharp's sister project Numpy.NET.\n\nNumSharp is a member project of SciSharp.org which is the .NET based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
