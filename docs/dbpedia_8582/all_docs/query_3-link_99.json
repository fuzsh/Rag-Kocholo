As I will also include binary releases every now and again I would also need to include my own LICENSE file, all MIT-licenses as well as the NOTICE file.\n\nWould that be the correct way to comply with the MIT license? Am I missing something? I would love to hear your feedback on my poor deduction skills, I just want to be extra careful not to improperly comply to any of the above licenses.\n\nThanks in advance!"
