In addition to maintenance and stability there are many desirable features yet to be added. If your company is using Dear ImGui, please consider reaching out.)\n\nBusinesses: support continued development and maintenance via invoiced sponsoring/support contracts:\n\nE-mail: contact @ dearimgui dot com\n\nIndividuals: support continued development and maintenance here. Also see Funding page.\n\nThe Pitch - Usage - How it works - Releases & Changelogs - Demo - Getting Started & Integration Gallery - Support, FAQ - How to help - Funding & Sponsors - Credits - License Wiki - Extensions - Languages bindings & frameworks backends - Software using Dear ImGui - User quotes\n\nDear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).\n\nDear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries.\n\nDear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard.\n\nMinimize state synchronization.\n\nMinimize UI-related state storage on user side.\n\nMinimize setup and maintenance.\n\nEasy to use to create dynamic UI which are the reflection of a dynamic data set.\n\nEasy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.\n\nEasy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.\n\nEasy to hack and improve.\n\nPortable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).\n\nEfficient runtime and memory consumption.\n\nBattle-tested, used by many major actors in the game industry.\n\nThe core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui*.cpp, imgui*.h). No specific build process is required. You can add the .cpp files into your existing project.\n\nBackends for a variety of graphics API and rendering platforms are provided in the backends/ folder, along with example applications in the examples/ folder. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.\n\nSee the Getting Started & Integration section of this document for more details.\n\nAfter Dear ImGui is set up in your application, you can use it from _anywhere_ in your program loop:\n\nDear ImGui allows you to create elaborate tools as well as very short-lived ones. On the extreme side of short-livedness: using the Edit&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweak variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game-making editor/framework, etc.\n\nThe IMGUI paradigm through its API tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization, and state retention from the user's point of view. It is less error-prone (less code and fewer bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to creating dynamic user interfaces. Check out the Wiki's About the IMGUI paradigm section for more details.\n\nDear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small. Because Dear ImGui doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions anywhere in your code (e.g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate Dear ImGui with your existing codebase.\n\nA common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode GUI for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the GUI functions are called. This is NOT what Dear ImGui does. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches your GPU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely.\n\nSee Releases page for decorated Changelogs. Reading the changelogs is a good way to keep up to date with the things Dear ImGui has to offer, and maybe will give you ideas of some features that you've been ignoring until now!\n\nCalling the ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() function will create a demo window showcasing a variety of features and examples. The code is always available for reference in imgui_demo.cpp. Here's how the demo looks.\n\nYou should be able to build the examples from sources. If you don't, let us know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear ImGui features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here:\n\nimgui-demo-binaries-20240105.zip (Windows, 1.90.1 WIP, built 2024/01/05, master) or older binaries.\n\nThe demo applications are not DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For DPI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at a different scale and scale your style with style.ScaleAllSizes() (see FAQ).\n\nSee the Getting Started guide for details.\n\nOn most platforms and when using C++, you should be able to use a combination of the imgui_impl_xxxx backends without modification (e.g. imgui_impl_win32.cpp + imgui_impl_dx11.cpp). If your engine supports multiple platforms, consider using more imgui_impl_xxxx files instead of rewriting them: this will be less work for you, and you can get Dear ImGui running immediately. You can later decide to rewrite a custom backend using your custom engine functions if you wish so.\n\nIntegrating Dear ImGui within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading a texture to your GPU/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles, which is essentially what Backends are doing. The examples/ folder is populated with applications doing just that: setting up a window and using backends. If you follow the Getting Started guide it should in theory takes you less than an hour to integrate Dear ImGui. Make sure to spend time reading the FAQ, comments, and the examples applications!\n\nOfficially maintained backends/bindings (in repository):\n\nRenderers: DirectX9, DirectX10, DirectX11, DirectX12, Metal, OpenGL/ES/ES2, SDL_Renderer, Vulkan, WebGPU.\n\nPlatforms: GLFW, SDL2/SDL3, Win32, Glut, OSX, Android.\n\nFrameworks: Allegro5, Emscripten.\n\nThird-party backends/bindings wiki page:\n\nLanguages: C, C# and: Beef, ChaiScript, CovScript, Crystal, D, Go, Haskell, Haxe/hxcpp, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Kotlin, Lobster, Lua, Nim, Odin, Pascal, PureBasic, Python, ReaScript, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Zig...\n\nFrameworks: AGS/Adventure Game Studio, Amethyst, Blender, bsf, Cinder, Cocos2d-x, Defold, Diligent Engine, Ebiten, Flexium, GML/Game Maker Studio, GLEQ, Godot, GTK3, Irrlicht Engine, JUCE, LÖVE+LUA, Mach Engine, Magnum, Marmalade, Monogame, NanoRT, nCine, Nim Game Lib, Nintendo 3DS/Switch/WiiU (homebrew), Ogre, openFrameworks, OSG/OpenSceneGraph, Orx, Photoshop, px_render, Qt/QtDirect3D, raylib, SFML, Sokol, Unity, Unreal Engine 4/5, UWP, vtk, VulkanHpp, VulkanSceneGraph, Win32 GDI, WxWidgets.\n\nMany bindings are auto-generated (by good old cimgui or newer/experimental dear_bindings), you can use their metadata output to generate bindings for other languages.\n\nUseful Extensions/Widgets wiki page:\n\nAutomation/testing, Text editors, node editors, timeline editors, plotting, software renderers, remote network access, memory editors, gizmos, etc. Notable and well supported extensions include ImPlot and Dear ImGui Test Engine.\n\nAlso see Wiki for more links and ideas.\n\nExamples projects using Dear ImGui: Tracy (profiler), ImHex (hex editor/data analysis), RemedyBG (debugger) and hundreds of others.\n\nFor more user-submitted screenshots of projects using Dear ImGui, check out the Gallery Threads!\n\nFor a list of third-party widgets and extensions, check out the Useful Extensions/Widgets wiki page.\n\nCustom engine erhe (docking branch)\n\nCustom engine for Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap (2017)\n\nCustom engine (untitled)\n\nTracy Profiler (github)\n\nSee: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) where common questions are answered.\n\nSee: Getting Started and Wiki for many links, references, articles.\n\nSee: Articles about the IMGUI paradigm to read/learn about the Immediate Mode GUI paradigm.\n\nSee: Upcoming Changes.\n\nSee: Dear ImGui Test Engine + Test Suite for Automation & Testing.\n\nFor the purposes of getting search engines to crawl the wiki, here's a link to the Crawlable Wiki (not for humans, here's why).\n\nGetting started?

It turned out that Atman was exposed to the concept directly by working with Casey. When I moved to Media Molecule I rewrote a new library trying to overcome the flaws and limitations of the first one I've worked with. It became this library and since then I have spent an unreasonable amount of time iterating and improving it.\"\n\nEmbeds ProggyClean.ttf font by Tristan Grimmer (MIT license).\n\nEmbeds stb_textedit.h, stb_truetype.h, stb_rect_pack.h by Sean Barrett (public domain).\n\nInspiration, feedback, and testing for early versions: Casey Muratori, Atman Binstock, Mikko Mononen, Emmanuel Briney, Stefan Kamoda, Anton Mikhailov, Matt Willis.
