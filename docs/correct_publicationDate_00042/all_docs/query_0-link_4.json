        "text": "January 19, 2013\n\nWhen it comes to critiquing Harry Turtledove’s ability in crafting alternate history, I must echo the old SNL skit characters of “Wayne’s World” in saying, “I’m not worthy!” Those who follow my reviews know that I don’t care for the hopscotch nature of “epic” novels but that I am willing to slog through them (in doses) for the sake of George R. R. Martin’s gritty vision of medieval fantasy and the series from Turtledove in which WorldWar: Upsetting the Balance is the third volume. Even though I’m committed to completing the series, it takes me a while to get into each new volume because there is no one particular character with whom I’m emotionally engaged.\n\nThat being said, I liked WorldWar: Upsetting the Balance for its differences with the second volume, WorldWar: Tilting the Balance. The latter was action-packed and as full of romance and comedic surprises as an Asian drama (a secret addiction of mine). This one is primarily about betrayal. The characters who are tempted toward betrayal are telegraphed, but the results were not what I had expected. One ended up exactly the opposite of what I expected and the other completely confirmed my fears for said character. The point is that Turtledove continues to fascinate me. I wasn’t expecting the war between the world’s coalition of forces and the alien invaders to escalate in quite the way, technologically and politically, it did. Nor was I exactly ready for the amazing events that took place in a portion of the alien camp. There is no doubt that I’ll be ready for WorldWar: Striking the Balance very soon.\n\nMeanwhile, there is plenty to like in this volume. I like the ethical dilemmas. At one point, Colonel Hans Jaegar [spelled with the umlaut instead of the “ae” in the book] objects to the manner in which human lives are being subjected to radiation in order to recover enough enriched uranium to build an atomic bomb. His superior responds: “If we do not recover the nuclear material, Colonel Jaegar, we are all the more likely to lose the war against the Lizards; at which point all ethical arguments become irrelevant.” (p. 93) Jaegar has to decide if he will obey the order and follow through, in spite of the human cost. Much later in the book, we read: “’Ja,’ Jaegar said in a hollow voice. What Skorzeny didn’t get and wouldn’t get if he lived to be a hundred—not likely, considering how the SS man lived—was that what we were supposed to do and what our superiors ordered us to do weren’t necessarily one and the same thing.” (p. 359)\n\nAt times, I was simply intrigued by interesting takes on political and ethical debates. At one point, the Lizards reflect on the emotional and/or irrational aspects of human argument: “Molotov had made the same demand, although he’d couched it in terms of—what had he called it?—the ineluctable historical dialectic, a notion that gave analysts even more trouble than did the mysterious and quite possibly unreal thing called freedom. The Big Uglies had a gift for dreaming up concepts unsupported by evidence.” (p. 161) At another point, the Soviet pilot, Ludmila, “…supposed he thought initiative was a good thing. Like a lot of Soviet citizens, she mistrusted the concept. How could social equality survive if some people pushed themselves ahead of the rest?” (p. 432)\n\nI further enjoyed a discussion at one point that vividly illustrated the differences between “scientists” and “engineers.” In this exchange, Szilard tells Groves (the military officer and administrator of the Manhattan Project), “Adequate theory would allow the first attempt to be of proper quality.” To which Groves smiles and Turtledove editorializes: “That was just the difference between a scientist, who thought that adequate theory could adequately explain the world, and an engineer, who was sure you had to get in there and tinker with things before they would go the right way. “ (p. 125)\n\nPerhaps, the best writing was to be found in two places. In the first, a character was visiting another character who was immersed in grief.\n\nAs he entered her rooming house, “The rooming house smelled of unwashed bodies, garbage, and stale piss. If you bottled the odor, you’d call it something like Essence of Despair.” (pp. 291-2) In another, a character reflects on the nature of war. “’You know what?’ he said, almost plaintively, to Muldoon. ‘You get stuck in a war, you don’t just set your body on the line. Everything you knew or thought you knew goes up into the front lines with you, and some of it ends up dead even if you don’t.” (p. 469) Wow! Those two lines alone were worth the time I invested in reading this book.\n\nJune 20, 2023\n\nFirst read – 9 June 2008 - **. This is another bridge book, like Tilting the Balance, doing little to advance the overall story arc of the series - until the last two or three chapters. At that point, the geopolitical balance is finally \"upset\" by advancing human technology in comparison to the stagnant lizard capabilities, and several of the characters finally take some life-changing actions. But up till then, the progress is very slow with too-frequent recitation of repeated background material. I hope the end of the sequence turns out to be worth it.\n\n1 Worldwar; In The Balance (1994)\n\n2 Worldwar; Tilting the Balance (1995)\n\n3 Worldwar; Upsetting the Balance (1996)\n\n4 Worldwar; Striking the Balance (1996)\n\n5 Colonization: Second Contact (1999)\n\n6 Colonization: Down to Earth (2000)\n\n7 Colonization: Aftershocks (2001)\n\n8 Homeward Bound (2004)\n\nJune 10, 2019\n\nThis just felt like such wasted potential. Turtledove was building up such an interesting premise, an incredible alternate history involving an alien invasion, and then by Book 3... it's turned into The A-Team, World War II Edition. Between overabundant use of Idiot Plot and the protagonists getting lucky over and over, it went from fascinating to unbelievable in short order. Even when the lizards manage to accomplish their objectives, it somehow always ends up helping the protagonists in some unforeseen lucky way.\n\nWhile examples abound, I'll go with a simple one: you have an air base defended by a single anti-aircraft gun being attacked by about a hundred lizard soldiers and two attack helicopters. Despite the helicopters bombarding the anti-aircraft gun with missiles that have been described through 2+ books as \"rarely ever missing thanks to the lizards' superior technology,\" the British soldiers being \"so stubborn, so determined\" keeps their gun from getting destroyed and they win.\n\nIn an alternate universe, maybe the Brits could've been rescued by unicorns that then stampeded over the lizards, winning the war. Not much less believable.\n\nI literally threw this book across the room at about the 55% mark because the lucky breaks being presented weren't just unbelievable, but insulting to me as a reader. Needless to say, it was DNF'd. YMMV.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nThe third installment in the Turtledove's saga of World War II derailed by an alien invasion is just as good as the previous two. There are lots of twists as the author follows his many characters through the war's highs and lows.\n\nMy favorite aspect of this series is the detailed and insightful view the author provides into the thoughts and emotions of the invading \"Lizards\". They are just as \"human\" in their own way as the Earth's inhabitants. Indeed, they are often more compassionate.\n\nRecommended, though you need patience to stick with this story. I already have a copy of the fourth and last book. I'm very curious how it will turn out.\n\nJanuary 4, 2014\n\nThis is another installment in an alternate history series, which I'm reading because my 15-year-old son ordered me to. Worldwar offers the intriguing idea of an alien invasion which occurs smack in the middle of WWII.\n\nUpsetting the Balance is the third and weakest volume.\n\nIn terms of plot, it traces the war through another year as multiple human nations struggle against the invaders, the Race or, as we call 'em, the Lizards. Most of the world has fallen to the aliens, but the leading WWII powers are still fighting hard: the US, the UK, the Nazis, the USSR, Japan, and China. Honestly, this becomes very repetitive and stale through the course of Upsetting, as multiple scenes rehash the same points for each side. We don't see much development until the end, whereupon humans and Lizards suddenly launch atomic strikes against each other. Munich, Chicago, Miami, Breslau, Seattle, Honolulu, and Rome all go up in nuclear fire. The Lizards nuke Tokyo earlier in the book, but it doesn't seem to mean much. The Lizard invasion of Britain is disappointing - Atvar's decision isn't explained (and everyone hates it), and it fails pretty quickly.\n\nOne nice scene has a psychologist (!) thinking about timelines. He makes a convincing case that the gap between the Lizards' observation of humanity (1400s, I think) and WWII would not have been a problem had the gap occurred earlier in history. For example, if the Lizards had spotted the Roman Republic, they would have had no problem walking over the late middle ages. A nice point, reminding me of Ian Morris' excellent Why the West Rules (for Now).\n\nOther problems with the book: the Lizards simply suck. Every chapter sees them acting stupidly, outfoxed by clever humans. It's repetitive, unrealistic, and saps the story of much energy.\n\nAnother problem: the sheer death toll doesn't seem to affect humans very much. We are more upset by lack of electricity than mass slaughter.\n\nRelated to this: nuclear fallout doesn't seem to be an issue. Which is, ah, weird.\n\nBonus problem: apparently the southern half of the world lies under Lizard control. This doesn't seem to matter. The aliens don't get any joy from it, and the other humans don't seem to care. I'd love to see a storyline from the perspective of, say, an Australian aborigine, or a Chilean peasant. While I appreciate Turtledove's inclusion of fronts usually downplayed in WWII discussions (China, even Russia), this feels racist at worst, and awkward at best.\n\nExtra-bonus problem: the US paperback shows a meeting between Einstein, Eisenhower, and Mussolini. Which actually happens in the book, but makes no sense. It's never explained, nor do any characters return to it later. Why is the Italian dictator in middle America...?\n\nI'll look into volume 4, since my son will be unrelenting, but my expectations are low.\n\nMay 8, 2016\n\nWARNING: SPOILERS!\n\nHarry Turtledove is a very good writer, but I'm getting tired of this series. It's just too long. Turtledove killed off an annoying character and it was a relief not because I cared so much one way or the other, but that the character was annoying and had been annoying and it seemed like there wasn't much Turtledove could have done with him to salvage the plot line.\n\nBy the end of this book, so many cities have been nuked out of existence that it's just becoming depressing. I can't help but think it's an anti-war (or at least anti-nuclear proliferation) manifesto as well as whatever else it is. As good as Turtledove is -- very good, I think, at mining human thoughts and behaviors and motivations, as well as creating the same for the foreign creatures, good at using historical detail, good at convincing portraying Russians, Germans, Poles, Chinese, among others, good (as I've said in a previous review of one of the books) at making battles feel real but not so detailed that I just couldn't figure out what was going on any more, good at the writer's craft in many ways -- I just want it to be done.\n\nI now realize (belatedly) that perhaps a better strategy than reading books 2, 3, and 4 to find out how things resolve, I could have read 1 and 4, and tried to pick up the threads without reading 2 and 3. Too late now, so I will undoubtedly read the last of the series. Or maybe just skim it. Hmmm. There's a thought.\n\nVerdict: He's a good enough writer with a good enough premise that I want to find out \"what happens,\" but the series is too long, by quite a long shot. The publisher may be responsible for that. Or, possibly, readers of this genre are fond of the multi-multi-multi-volume format. (There's another one that's worse: Stirling's Dies the Fire series, which I discovered years ago and shared with family, but became uninterested after the third book, and there are zillions now.) I prefer to use my energy and interest reading spiritual books, but since I enjoy some fiction I should remember not to pick up books that are part of a series. Because if they are anything like this series, there really isn't any resolution until you've read all the books. That's the worst thing about this series: each book is most definitely not a stand-alone. If you give up before the fourth volume, it's the equivalent of stopping in the middle of one long book.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nI find myself liking the lizard people better than most of the human characters. This makes me think I might be doing this wrong.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nIm beginning to worry about the pacing of the series. It seems to be going too slow? How are we still under 2 years from the initial invasion?\n\nDecember 8, 2015\n\nContinuation of this epic story. As the humans are able to develop techniques to hold their own against a superior alien race, the battles get more intense. Turtledove has done a great job with the characters - all have great depth and you feel their struggles during the long and devastating war. My only complaint is all the countries are independently fighting the aliens and there is very little coordination between the groups. I look forward to the conclusion to this series.\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nAvanti tutta con questa terza parte dell'Invasione: la storia non perde di mordente!\n\nDecember 26, 2018\n\nVOTO INTERO CICLO DELL'INVASIONE: 4\n\nIl Ciclo dell'Invasione è composto da 4 volumi basati sul racconto di un'improvvisa invasione aliena che avviene nel pieno dello svolgimento della seconda guerra mondiale: da qui si dipana la narrazione di una vera e propria storia alternativa che vede le nazioni in guerra far fronte comune per cercare di colmare la schiacciante superiorità tecnologica e bellica dell'alieno invasore, al fine di contenerne le mire espansionistiche.\n\nNel complesso è un buon ciclo, ricchissimo di vicende e personaggi appartenenti alle più disparate fazioni coinvolte nel conflitto mondiale, dei quali se ne seguono le azioni e i destini, più o meno coinvolgenti per il lettore, anche se ritengo che il punto di forza della saga si basi sulle caratteristiche sociali e sui profili psicologici degli invasori alieni, il che non mancherà di suscitare anche momenti di ilarità.\n\nLe pecche più evidenti si riscontrano nella talvolta superflua prolissità dell'autore nel descrivere i dettagli di ciò che racconta e sulle ripetizioni di vicende ed avvenimenti che non mancheranno di annoiare, soprattutto se il ciclo viene letto un libro dopo l'altro.\n\nNel complesso consigliato agli amanti del genere ucronico.\n\nNovember 2, 2016\n\nAlthough this book starts off slowly, as in the middle of a conflict that has no clear direction. About halfway through we reach a point at which the aliens's internal hierarchal consistency starts to deteriorate. At this point the human contamination reaches full excess. What is interesting is that while the humans start off split, there starts to be a hint that a consistency for humans will emerge, although there is no equivalent contamination of the Lizards into the human lifeworld, beyond further war.\n\nI thought the end of this book particularly interesting as Turtledove takes what is a desperate situation and turns up the conflict even more. By the end of this book, the wandering directionlessness of the conflict from the previous books starts to take a definite shape as characters you think are central are killed off, and other characters who seem marginal take a more central role in defining the nature of the conflict.\n\nMay 29, 2017\n\nAnd so, I \"read\" through this \"novel\" in a couple of hours yesterday.\n\nWell, technically, it is not reading, because I skipped nearly all of the filler PoVs along the way, ending up with only about thirty pages of plot-significant text. Even that, I skimmed through. Basically, very little of significance happens in this novel, and technically, it cannot be called a novel, either, for it cannot stand on its own. It's like thirty pages of events, distended and made bigger, to fit into a book. Makes more money, that way. You'll only know how much filler there is when you bite in.\n\nSo yes, basically, the series is getting even worse, if that's possible, and it's not yet frigging over just yet. There is still another book. I cannot bear to contemplate that prospect.\n\nBest avoided. Nothing to see here. Read a plot synopsis if you must. Not recommended.\n\nJuly 2, 2017\n\nTurtledove's alternate-history-by-numbers continues with the third of the WorldWar series. This chunky tome continues to follow the diverse set of people across the Superpowers as they defend themselves from oppression. The aliens too are struggling to find the resources necessary to fight a prolonged war, light years from home. The story's perspective sways from alien to human throughout the novel, each chapter detailing the horrors of war on our planet. There's no conclusion here, as expected in a middle chapter, however very few of the characters achieve much throughout this book, which ultimately makes it hard going. The final quarter holds some unexpected turns which ensure readers will see it through and return for more.\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nHarry Turtledove is an author known for his specialization in Alternate History. He asks the question what if something different had happened at some point in recorded history? In the Worldwar series of novels, Turtledove asks what would have happened if an alien race decided to invade right as World War II was going into full swing?\n\nSounds completely implausible, right? That’s what I thought before I began reading these books. I expected to be reading something out of a bad 50’s science-fiction B-movie.\n\nI have been delightfully surprised.\n\nFor my full review, please see: https://thoughtsfromthemountaintop.co...\n\nJuly 6, 2022\n\nHarry just milking a great concept. I had to skip thru all the boring and repetitive stuff, which was a lot! The Lizard perspective was so much more interesting than the humans. Rather interesting how Harry downplays the results of all the nuked cities. Radiation is very much a minor fact. Very tedious to have to reread so much back story from the first 2 books. Also, so little about the lizard Fleetwood that defected. I figured that would make for some good script. Probably in book 4. I will read the last book and the Colonization series just to see how the story plays out, but with lots of skipping!\n\nFebruary 26, 2020\n\nSetting presentation, design and originality (how cool is the setting?): 4\n\nSetting verisimillitude and detail (how much sense does the setting make?): 3\n\nPlot design, presentation and originality (How well-crafted was the plot, in the dramaturgic sense?): 3\n\nPlot and character verisimillitude (How much sense did the plot and motivations make? Did events follow from motivations?): 4\n\nCharacterization and character development: 4\n\nCharacter sympatheticness: 4\n\nProse: 3\n\nPage turner factor: 4\n\nMind blown factor: 2\n\nFinal (weighted) score: 3.5\n\nJuly 16, 2020\n\nI enjoyed this book better than the second in the series but there is still a lot of repetitive stuff that could have easily been removed. I thought some of the interactions between the aliens and humans were comical, which is why I think this books was more enjoyable for me. I think he missed a lot of opportunities to expand on the world war, but that is just my opinion and did not detract from the overall story. It took me a while to want to read this, but I am actually looking forward to the next in the series.\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\nAnother great book in this series. I am listening to this series because my library does not have this series. The Worlds War continues. Turtledove does such a great job of making the reader root for everyone. How can the Germans work with the English??? Do you think you can root for an alien against mankind? Turtledove spins this so that you do. I can’t wait to see what happens in the remainder of this series. PS Ginger.... wow!! A common spice as a drug for aliens. Brilliant !!\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\nIf you’re still with the series at this point, you know all of Turtledove’s pros (witty humor, attention to historical detail, vast sense of perspective) and cons (cringeworthy sex scenes, “flipping through channels” story structure, somewhat lagging pace). This volume, though, finally feels like the story is getting somewhere, and the author finally seems to have figured out how to make the alien characters as engaging as the human ones.\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\nI gave book #2 5 stars, but dropped down to 3 stars for this one. Why? Because things are getting very longwinded. Way too many viewpoint characters to care for any of them and the mix of lots of romance and military SF doesn't work.\n\nStill the concept is brilliant, Turtledove writes well and the parts that show the story from the point of view of the aliens are enjoyable. But it is way to wordy to deserve more than 3 stars\n\nRead\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nSame review as the others in the series since it is a slow moving saga: Harry Turtledove weaves an intricate alt-history novel that dives deep into character development. The problem is, in my opinion, that he dives too deep. It makes for a very long read - a problem made worse by the author's style of telegraphing his intentions. It's still an enjoyable book and series even if I was looking for something with a bit faster pace.\n\nMarch 24, 2020\n\nThe continuing struggle of the alien lizards against WWII era Earth. The war has turned into a battle of attrition, and unfortunately the reading is starting to feel like that. As I have read the books back to back to back, I am starting to tire of the story. I am heading straight onto the last book to finish the saga...\n\nOctober 6, 2020\n\nI only \"kind of\" like Harry Turtledove books.\n\nI am a history buff, so it would seem I should like them.\n\nHis history and detail is commendable.\n\nHis alternate history conjecture seems on the mark , to a point.\n\nBut he has a tendency to carry things a bit too far, this book especially. An interesting premise is then taken in a direction that is a bit off-kilter and a bit hard to read.\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\nMy favorite alternate history series. Space Lizards vs. Humanity during WWII, what more can you ask for?\n\nUnfortunately, Harry Turtledove can't seem to pick a reasonable number of character perspectives to follow; I think I counted upwards of twenty. That can make this series hard to stomach, but I found most chapters and characters compelling enough to follow anyway.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nLiked it for the same reasons I like the rest of the series, though some of the plot lines are pretty dull. I’m glad to get more perspective from the Lizard characters, but writing sex and romance is far from Turtledove’s strong suit. I preferred when he shied away from the details in earlier books…\n\nSeptember 13, 2017\n\nAnd the third war marches toward an end. The reluctant allies learn more and deadlier means or destruction. As always the mixture of character types and their day to day lives k moves the action to a conclusion\n\nJanuary 26, 2018\n\nThis is more of the same as the second in the series with nukes and rockets added as the Earth defenders improve the tech brought to the war against the aliens. The big question seems to be how much of the world will be left for the human powers to fight over.\n\nA good read."
