        "text": "Harry Turtledove is rounding out his fourth decade publishing with Asimov’s with a personally inspired short story, “Speaker to Emos” in our current issue [on sale now]. Here, he offers advice for anyone seeking a similarly lengthy writing career and tells us a little about his inspirations.\n\nPhoto credit: Joan Allen\n\nAsimov’s Editor: What is the story behind this piece?\n\nHT: It’s set in a world where people on the Asperger’s spectrum are the vast majority of the population, while those who are normal by actual standards are a tiny minority who have trouble fitting in to their environment. The main character is a counselor who tries to teach them how.\n\nAE: How did this story germinate? Was there a spark of inspiration, or did it come to you slowly?\n\nHT: I’m on the Asperger’s spectrum—close to the neurotypical end, but I am. So is my friend Jeff Deutsch, who’s been a counselor teaching Asperger’s folk how to get along in the neurotypical world. We kept batting the idea back and forth—“You write it!” “No, you write it!”—for several years before I finally did.\n\nAE: Is this story part of a larger universe, or is it stand-alone?\n\nHT: It stands alone.\n\nAE: What is your history with Asimov’s?\n\nHT: I’ve been publishing with Asimov’s since 1981.\n\nAE: Who or what are your greatest influences and inspirations?\n\nHT: L. Sprague de Camp and Poul Anderson.\n\nAE: How much or little do current events impact your writing?\n\nHT: More than I wish they did, lately. My pinned tweet on Twitter (@HNTurtledove) is “I didn’t mean to be topical,” repeated a good many times.\n\nAE: Are there any themes that you find yourself returning to throughout your writing? If yes, what and why?\n\nHT: I’m an escaped Byzantine historian (Sprague de Camp’s fault—I read Lest Darkness Fall at an impressionable age), so I tend to write a lot of alternate history.\n\nAE: What is your process?\n\nHT: I do the first draft in longhand, then clean it up on the Mac.\n\nAE: How did you break into writing?\n\nHT: I wrote. I sent things out. I kept sending them out. Eventually, as I learned how, they started sticking.\n\nAE: What are you reading right now?\n\nHT: I just reread James Blish’s Black Easter and The Day After Judgment.\n\nAE: Do you have any advice for up-and-coming writers?\n\nHT: Write. Keep writing. Send out what you write. Writing for yourself is masturbation. Writing for others is . . . well, better.\n\nAE: What is something we should know about you that we haven’t thought to ask?\n\nHT: Three cats in the house—a Russian Blue-ish named Boris, a fluffy red tabby named Hotspur, and a Siamese called Ford. They’re all rescues. Ford has his name because he was rescued from the Ford Ranger where he was abandoned by his mother, which happened to belong to a cat fosterer. His brother, who lives with someone else and looks like an Aby, is named Ranger.\n\nAE: How can our readers follow you and your writing?\n\nHT: As I said above, on Twitter I’m @HNTurtledove. A website about me is https://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/turtledove.html."
