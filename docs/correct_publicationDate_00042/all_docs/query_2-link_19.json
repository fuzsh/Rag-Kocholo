It is a young adult fiction series and so racial slurs, profanity, and sex are considerably muted, compared to Turtledove's other work.\n\nGunpowder Empire (2003) - the Roman Empire won an analog of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and still goes strong, but technology never advanced beyond the discovery of gunpowder.\n\nIn High Places (2006) - the effects of the 14th century's bubonic plagues were doubled, so that the world never left the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Disunited States of America (2006) - the United States did not form a federal government in 1787, and North America balkanized into several dozen nation-states who have periodic border wars.\n\nThe Gladiator (2007) - After years of declining, the Soviet Union collapses in 1986, with many communist states in the world becoming pro-American.\n\nThe Valley-Westside War (2008) - civilization remains at a quasi-medieval level since the nuclear world war of 1967.\n\nDays of Infamy[]\n\nThe Kingdom of Japan gains the initiative in the Pacific War by invading and occupying San Diego immediately following the attack on San Diego Naval Base.\n\nDays of Infamy (2004)\n\nEnd of the Beginning (2005)\n\nAtlantis[]\n\nThe trilogy describes a world in which the American East Coast, from the tip of Florida to Acadia, broke away from the mainland around 85 million years ago and has an island biota that is similar to New Zealand's. It was discovered in 1452 by a Breton fisherman, Fran√ßois Kersauzon, it was named Atlantis. The seventh continent becomes a focal point in a gradually-diverging timeline. Two short stories, \"Audubon in Atlantis\" and \"The Scarlet Band,\" have been set in the milieu.\n\nOpening Atlantis (2007)\n\nThe United States of Atlantis (2008)\n\nLiberating Atlantis (2009)\n\nAtlantis and Other Places (2010) contains \"Audubon in Atlantis\" and \"The Scarlet Band\" (a Sherlock Holmes pastiche of A Study in Scarlet and \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" in which the Dr. Watson analog repeatedly voices racial concepts common to that time) among ten other unrelated stories.\n\nOpening Atlantis was nominated for the 2009 Prometheus Award.\n\nOpening of the World[]\n\nThe trilogy describes a fantasy world in which inhabitants of an empire that is of the Iron Age but has Pleistocene wildlife explore a land uncovered by a receding glacier and then discover a threat to their national security.\n\nBeyond the Gap (2007)\n\nBreath of God (2008)\n\nThe Golden Shrine (2009)\n\nSupervolcano[]\n\nThe trilogy has the Yellowstone Caldera erupt at some unspecified point in the future and covers the decade following the Eruption.\n\nSupervolcano: Eruption (2011)\n\nSupervolcano: All Fall Down (2012)\n\nSupervolcano: Things Fall Apart (2013)\n\nState of Jefferson Stories[]\n\nFirst published in May 2016, the stories are set in a world in which Sasquatch, Yeti, Indonesian Hobbits, merfolk, and other cryptids are real or not extinct. Unlike common popular depictions of such creatures as less evolved primates, they are integrated into a world designed for ordinary humans (\"little people\"). Like other ethnic minorities cryptids experience cultural assimilation and racial stereotyping, become less familiar with ancestral customs and languages, and interbreed with the majority.\n\nIn 1919 several counties in northern California and southern Oregon seceded, forming the State of Jefferson. Neither the new state nor the earlier discovery of cryptids greatly affected United States or world history, with events such as World War II, the 1973 oil crisis, and Iranian hostage crisis still occurring. Most American Sasquatch live in the state; although they are still a small minority, size is a protected class in Jefferson, with anti-discrimination law guaranteeing reasonable accommodation.\n\nMost stories depict Governor Bill Williamson, Jefferson's second Sasquatch leader, who during the late 1970s and early 1980s meets Charles Kuralt, Jerry Turner, Nobuo Fujita and a Yeti Dalai Lama. From the state capital of Yreka he promotes his small, rural, and obscure state to the nation and world as an example of how different species can peacefully cooperate.\n\n\"Visitor from the East\" (May 2016)\n\n\"Peace is Better\" (May 2016)\n\n\"Typecasting\" (June 2016; set at the 1980 Ashland Shakespeare Festival)\n\n\"Three Men and a Sasquatch\" (January 2019)\n\n\"Something Fishy\" (January 2020)\n\n\"Always Something New\" (January 2020; set the day of the 1980 United States presidential election)\n\n\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon\" (January 2020; set after the Iranian hostage crisis)\n\nStandalone books[]"
