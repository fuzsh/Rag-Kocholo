        "text": "Originally attributed to Eric Iverson, one of Turtledove’s pen names.\n\nPublished: 1979, revised in 1994; I read it as part of the omnibus Wisdom of the Fox published in 1999\n\nGenre: fantasy\n\nLength: 140 pages\n\nSetting: the fantasy world of Elabon\n\nInterest: I was looking for a fantasy book on my Kindle, and I figured this was a safe bet, based solely on the title. Turns out, Werenight is the second book in the Elabon series, with Wereblood preceding it. If you’re interested in the book, I got it from the Baen Free Library (as is a large portion of my Kindle library), and you can download it or read it online for free here.\n\nSummary: We start out at the Keep of Gerin, the Fox. It is being attacked by the Trokmoi, the northern barbarians who have a new leader – Balamung, a sorcerer with a hatred for Gerin. After repulsing the Trokmoi attack, Gerin heads south to find a wizard from the Empire, along with Van of the Strong Arm. They stop at an old friend’s manor, who is about to marry off his daughter, Elise. She ends up running off with Gerin and Van, not appreciating her father’s choice of a husband, to go to her uncle’s house in the capital. They are unsuccessful in recruiting a Wizard, and Elise’s uncle doesn’t want to keep her, so they head back North. They do manage to convince Rihwin, nearly a wizard and an unsuccessful suitor of Elise, to help them take on Balamung. Gerin’s keep has managed to hold of Balamung and his forces long enough for Gerin to return with some reinforcements he picked up on the way. It is Gerin who ends up defeating Balamung with a bit of magic.\n\nFinal thoughts: A fine enough story. Lots of battling on chariots and a bit of magic and Gods’ revenge thrown in for good measure. I can definitely tell it was written a while ago. Poor Elise really has little to do in the story besides follow along with Gerin and his men and try to stay out of trouble. Even when she offers to help, the men are affronted by her offer and the thought of being beholden to a woman. The men are very manly and strong and do quite a bit of wenching (especially Van) whenever they are able."
