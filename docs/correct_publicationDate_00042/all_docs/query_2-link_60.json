        "text": "Before reading this book, I had always enjoyed Harry Turtledove’s alternative history novels, which have a sci fi vibe and usually a good dose of humor, sometimes of the laugh out loud variety. When I saw that this one was available, I leapt on it. What a freaking disappointment!\n\nNevertheless, my thanks go to NetGalley and ARC Manor Publishing for the review copy. This book is for sale now.\n\nThe premise is that HIV—renamed The Wasting-- erupts in the early 1500s, but instead of dismissing it as a disease spread by gay men, English society sequesters its women in the home, never to be permitted friends or visitors, never allowed to go out and do their own shopping without extreme cloaking of bodies and faces, and extreme risk for committing the social sin of venturing out of the house. Viola is supposedly our protagonist, a young, intelligent woman of marriageable age who fumes under her constraints and entertains herself by reading her physician father’s collection of medical books.\n\nPeter, whom we actually see a good deal more of, is the young man that the parents have arranged to marry Viola. The two of them are permitted to meet (in Viola’s home of course) in order to determine whether they are compatible. They are. Now Peter is off to university, and for the most part, we go with him.\n\nImmediately we meet Peter’s obnoxious, wealthy roommate, who is masturbating when we encounter him. Turns out this guy never thinks of anything except sex. Peter is determined to wait for marriage because of the Wasting. There’s no treatment and there’s no cure; he doesn’t want it, and he doesn’t want to give it to Viola. His roommate, however, frequents brothels on an almost nightly basis and talks about it, graphically, interminably. Think of every vulgar, disgusting, disrespectful term you don’t want to know about women’s anatomy and the various sexual positions, and this jerk uses them all. All. The. Time. Repetitiously, constantly, and for no reason except, apparently, to make us hate him, which we do, and possibly as filler.\n\nHave you ever known someone that makes up excuses to use objectionable language, because, see, they’re quoting someone? That’s how this feels to me.\n\nThere is no character development of any kind here. The book is short, but it feels interminable. I made it halfway through, then read the last twenty-five percent to be sure there wasn’t some redemptive element at the climax or the end. But there is no climax. There’s no story arc. For that matter, there are no gay people or bath houses, but hey, it’s alternative history, it’s fiction, and if Turtledove wants to leave out the gay people, he can do that.\n\nBut the disease? It comes from Africa. Oh, of course it does. Blaming the Black people for everything has apparently made it through from our time period to Turtledove’s invented world.\n\nThere is no redemptive feature to be found here, and frankly, the second star in my rating is there only as a wistful nod to this author’s earlier works. I recommend this book to anyone forced to purchase something for a horny, obnoxious male that wants a socially acceptable way to read porn. That’s it.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this novel. On the one hand, I was excited when I first learnt of the question this well-known author of alternative histories was asking. What if HIV had spread across the world 450 years before it did, with no modern medicines to treat or contain it? On the other hand, I found the vehicle for Turtledove’s tale, that of a young middle class couple, Peter and Viola, engaged to be married, somewhat underwhelming.\n\nThe novel opens in 1509 with Portugese seaman in Africa being infected by a woman captured for the slave trade and then sold in Europe. It then skips forward to England in 1851 where the virus is widespread and known as the Wasting. Society as we know it has changed and it is women who have suffered most. Girls are only free to play outside and mix with boys until they reach puberty and then they must be sequestered at home, only venturing rarely outside clad in shapeless cloaks and veils, and when they do can expect to put up with catcalls and jeering, because men can’t be expected to control their carnal desires. Once sequestered, the only education girls receive is from their parents or reading books and with no opportunity to mix, marriages are arranged between families, with the couples meeting once to see if they might be compatible.\n\nPeter, the son of a lawyer is taken to meet Viola, the daughter of a doctor with a view to becoming engaged before he is sent to Lincoln Inn’s Fields to study to become a barrister. There he must resist the call of the brothels frequented by his fellow students and remain a virgin until his marriage. Viola, bored with the confines of her home longs for women to have more freedom and especially to be able to travel, but all she can do is lose herself in travel books written by men and write letters to Peter.\n\nI found the account of Peter’s law studies and Viola’s home life, while she waited for Peter, repetitive and not that interesting and felt it could have been dealt with more succinctly. However, I found the overall premise of this novel fascinating, especially when the author imagines changes that had great consequence due to historic figures and people of influence having died young or never being born at all. Such as Henry VIII succumbing to the disease before he could be divorced from Katherine, resulting in Britain remaining a Catholic country with Mary crowned Queen and no Elizabethan or Victorian eras. More of this type of thought-provoking speculation and a wider view of the effect of HIV on the world would have made the novel a more interesting read.\n\nFew authors have been recognized as the unparalleled masters of a particular literary genre. At the top of that short list is Harry Turtledove, whose alternative histories include multigenerational sagas of an America in which the Confederacy won the Civil War and other tales in which magical creatures affected the course of history. His latest work, “The Wages of Sin,” lacks the eye-catching hook of many of his other books. Instead of a topsy-turvy Civil War, he asks what the world would look like if HIV had spread to Europe centuries before the medical tools existed to combat it. The premise has the potential to be just as fascinating as Turtledove’s other books, but a somewhat lackluster storyline dims its impact considerably.\n\nIn “Wages of Sin,” Portuguese slave traders brought HIV to Europe in the early 1500s, where the spread was dramatic. Most of the book is set in England in the 1850s. AIDS was referred to as the Wasting, and people knew how it spread but little else about the disease. To combat the disease’s spread, women were forced to wear concealing garments and veils in public to avoid inciting lustful ideas in men. (Real-world practices today are similar in some cultures.) Dating was non-existent; instead, English families arranged marriages for their children. However, brothels still flourish for those men seeking pleasure and willing to take a risk. To protect the rest of society, those who display the early symptoms of AIDS are branded with a “W” on their foreheads.\n\nThe protagonists of “Wages of Sin” are a young, engaged couple. Viola Williams is the daughter of the town doctor in Salisbury, a small distance over a day’s coach ride from London. Her fiancé, Peter Drinkwater, is the son of a local solicitor. For most of the book, he’s off at law school in London. She wants to be more than a housewife and is frustrated by the caste system in England. So, she reads and writes. He’s determined to stay on the straight and narrow and avoid the temptations his wealthy roommate succumbs to nightly at a local house of ill repute. They write each other letters that take a week to arrive. And they philosophize a lot.\n\nIf this plot description sounds somewhat bland, it is. Peter and Viola are ordinary, middle-class people. Viola’s fight against the establishment results in her gaining some notoriety in a surprising way, but Peter has few distinguishing characteristics other than a terrific study ethic. As I read “The Wages of Sin,” I waited for something to happen to justify the author’s choice of this couple as his gateway to this alternate world. Then I waited some more. I learned more than I cared to about how to make the stews that were the Williams’ usual nightly fare. And I learned about how students learned in 19th-century law schools. But overall, I was underwhelmed by the saga of Peter and Viola.\n\nThis book was much more enjoyable when the author described how life differed in his alternate version of England. The country remained Catholic since King Henry VIII died of AIDS before getting around to asking for the Church’s approval for a divorce. The American colonies were still part of the British Empire (although the author doesn’t go into great detail about how that happened). But when the author described the daily lives of British subjects in those days, I was hard-pressed to note many differences between actual history and Turtledove history. Stew making is stew making. A few trivial details were interesting, such as the recipients of letters had to pay the mail carrier three pence for the privilege. As an attorney, I probably found the description of law school more interesting than many other readers would. But much of the book just repeated the same few observations repeatedly.\n\nThe main problem with “The Wages of Sin” is the author’s framing device. This book would have been far more interesting had it been set in the mid-1500s or had the disease spread to Europe in the 1800s. In either case, the public’s fear and the government’s attempt to understand and control AIDS would have been far more compelling. By contrast, the disease here is a given, as are the adjustments in public life. Instead, we get an England similar to the modern-day America of “The Handmaid’s Tale.”\n\n“The Wages of Sin” doesn’t have as compelling a central theme as Turtledove’s Civil War books, and Peter and Viola aren’t as attractive as characters. The only reason to read this book is for the author’s predictions about how life would have differed because of the spread of AIDS centuries earlier than in real life. I’m giving the book a three-star rating and a mild recommendation, primarily for genre fans. “The Wages of Sin” are interesting, but readers have much better examples of Turtledove’s work on which to spend their wages.\n\nNOTE: The publisher graciously provided me with a copy of this book through NetGalley. However, the decision to review the book and the contents of this review are entirely my own.\n\nThanks to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for letting me read this book in advance of publication.\n\nHarry Turtledove always makes me see a new perspective, and in Wages of Sin, he does that in spades.\n\nWe’ve all done it. Imagine a world where one single difference could have a massive impact on the world today. How would that play out for a first generation? And how about many years later?\n\nIn Wages of Sin, we’re introduced to a world where HIV made the jump to humans and was first spread in the early 1500s. European slave dealers, who caught the virus from the very slaves they had brutally captured, took the disease to their homelands. After only pages, the reader is both captivated by Turtledove’s deft characterization, and touched with dread for what will soon be ahead.\n\nThis would have been a fantastic jumping off point to continue the story in that timeline. It might have been easier that way. Seeing how the pre-industrial world would have dealt with this very recent virus would have had me flipping pages as quickly as I could. Turtledove’s choices were limitless. Where the story played out was perfection and had my iPad running long into the night.\n\nTurtledove drops us into a world forever changed by the virus. In 1851 England, Viola Williams watches the world from her little quarters above her father’s doctor surgery office. She, like every other female of pubescent age, is kept apart from most men. AIDS, called the Wasting, has taken hold in every aspect of this world, and is generally not well understood. As a result, women and teenaged girls are kept behind closed doors except for very limited circumstances. The only men they're permitted to know are their fathers and siblings, while men are allowed every freedom.\n\nViolet and her sisters live a quiet life, where they're afforded some small scraps of freedom by their parents. Viola, for example, helps her father to make diagnoses and discusses possible treatments for the townspeople who seek Dr. Williams’ help. But even that must take place in her quarters. She never actually sees a patient, only brainstorms symptoms and possible causes with her father. She is a more than capable assistant.\n\nIn another, less-cruel world, Viola might have been able to work openly as her father’s assistant. In this place, where women must be protected by their male relatives, most jobs are inaccessible to women. With the ultimate risk of The Wasting hovering over them, career is too lofty a goal for most women. Her sister Katherine’s talent at the harpsichord will wither just as Viola’s sharp brain and ways of deduction will never see the light of day.\n\nViola is always looking outward, her gaze firmly set on a world where men and woman can move about town freely. And while her family tries not to tamp down her dreams, they know they must be realistic. Strange men can’t be trusted. It is for a woman’s safety that she is locked away.\n\nSoon, it becomes clear that Viola’s life will take her in new directions. Salvation comes from an unexpected corner. Peter, the son of her father's dearest friend, is presented as a potential husband. Since their fathers agree to the arrangement, Viola becomes determined to make their new connection work, though they can only get to know each other at a respectable distance.\n\nPeter has opportunities Viola doesn’t and will be studying to become a solicitor, eventually taking over for his father. He and Viola vow to get to know each other over the miles, writing to each other frequently while he attends school in London. As Peter begins to find his footing at a Law school in the big city, Viola discovers a love for storytelling, and the belief that her world could change.\n\nWith the Wasting a constant thought on everyone’s mind and the fear of it dominating society, is the world ready for Viola to challenge the status quo? Setting pen to paper, she begins to dare dream that she can be more than her station and sex indicates, while hoping Peter never gives into temptation that could ruin them both.\n\nThis book manages to be incredibly contemporary to these moments in time, while presenting a past “could have been” that echoes the Handmaid’s Tale. Though Viola’s family treat each other well, other men taking liberties, just because they can, lurk around every corner outside their home. Viola, her mother and sisters can't even do their shopping without men and boys touching them as if they they had a God-given right to the women’s bodies. The women are told again and again that they're mere objects rather than humans.\n\nIt has taken me a few days to gather my thoughts. This book hit me on a deeper level than I anticipated. There’s a magic to the way Turtledove presents society through the small lens of average people in an average village. The focus sharpens and the reader can empathize with only a few main characters rather than a huge cast. The reader’s connection with Peter’s and Viola’s families are strengthened as we see them in slice-of-life moments.\n\nAs we see both characters evolve together and apart, it becomes clear that as their feelings for each other grow, so do their aspirations. Neither is fulfilled by their station in life, and they learn a great deal about themselves as they confront the cost of wishes and dreams.\n\nLife doesn't exist in a vacuum in Turtledove’s world, and the story is threaded delicately with a richness that might be easy to miss. I’d expected this England to be ruled by Queen Victoria, but then I realized that is not our England. King Michael III rules his British subjects.\n\nWhile I found the last third of the book a little rushed, that was only a minor blip. I tore through this book on first read, and then read it again more slowly, savoring the nuances of this version of 19th century England.\n\nTurtledove has never shied sway from the big issues, and in this book, it is the most resonant aspect of his tale. Religion, different classes of people, women’s freedom, women’s rights, the give and take of a marriage, and, of course, the marking and shunning those infected by a terminal disease round out a story and a world brimming with possibilities.\n\nThis book is multi-layered, complex, thought provoking and utterly absorbing. Harry Turtledove has again shown why he’s considered the master of alternate history. Don't miss Wages of Sin!\n\nThank you to NetGalley for an advanced copy of the book.\n\nMy review contains vague spoilers.\n\nThis is my first Turtledove novel after years of hearing about his impressive experience in alternate histories. The Wages of Sin takes a new spin on ‘pandemics’ with an old virus. What-if HIV sprung up in the 1500's? How would society be different? Well we certainly wouldn't have Shakespeare and that's a real tragedy.\n\n*Viola quoted Marlowe: “‘ Why this is hell, nor am I out of it.’”*\n\nTurtledove's knack with words is nothing new. The flow and pace of the novel is designed to keep one's attention, though I certainly could guess the plot points as easy as the next person.\n\nPart of the problem of HIV is its ability to hide, adapt, and resurface years later. It's unique features have been documented for decades (I do highly recommend Paul Farmer’s writings on epidemics in Haiti and around the world). Humans take the risk daily. We have to. Many societies are not as lucky as the English to have the ability to sequester half their population and survive.\n\n*He stayed in the refectory even so, while Walter went out to play the game he loved best: the dance with death*.\n\nI wish that the story didn't have such a decent ending so that we could have seen more character dilema, more anger towards God, more empowerment of the lady author, more resistance against authority. (I read mostly fantasy novels and am young enough to still have hope…) Yet, this story follows a typical family, very ordinary and not one to bend the rules - except Viola herself points out …\n\n“*Has it not occurred to you that I am an irregular person?” Viola said.*\n\nSurely one raised in a doctor's household, as intelligent and well positioned as she is, would find a cure or at least…condoms?\n\nThe one thing I found rather frightening was the relatable nature of walking around and being harassed by the male population - those who seemingly have very little care for the struggles of the opposite sex.\n\n*“I hope no one gave you trouble on the way over here,” Kate said. If that wasn’t one of the most common things women said to one another all around the world, Viola couldn’t imagine what would be. Men, after all, remained men all around the world.*\n\nWhile Viola wonders what her Temeculans would do as an equal society, I hope that the most important thing Temeculans do is more impactful than just walking around nude…. Maybe having a more equal representation in government would be a good start? *Wages* tries to be a good thought-provoking novel, but doesn't break out of the box. Perhaps, in hindsight, that is part of the point?"
