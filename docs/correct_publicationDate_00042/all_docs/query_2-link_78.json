        "text": "Short fiction, plus three essays, by the New York Times-bestselling author--including a Hugo Award-winning novella.\n\nHarry Turtledove earned the title \"master of alternate history\" from Publishers Weekly for his thought-provoking novels that turn historical facts into gripping tales of possibility. But his writing talent goes much further. We Install offers a showcase of styles, from humor--in \"Father of the Groom,\" a scientist with a penchant for wild experimentation helps his love-struck son by synthesizing a wedding ring out of two carrots--to classic science fiction, as in the Hugo Award-winning \"Down in the Bottomlands\" and \"Hoxbomb,\" in which a regular guy just trying to make a living selling scooters has to deal with some very odd competition. The alternate history tale \"Drang von Osten\" begins on a bloody battlefield in World War II and ends somewhere quite different. In the brand-new \"Logan's Law,\" a man discovers that sometimes, second chances really do work out. The book's three essays tackle the diverse subjects of how to write alternate history, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and the history of Chanukah."
