        "text": "When I ask alternate historians of my generation what got them interested in the genre, they almost always answer with the name ‚ÄúHarry Turtledove‚Äù. The most prolific author of alternate history is also the most respected. Fans are still discussing his works long after they have been published. Just look at these AlternateHistory.com threads dedicated to discussing his Timeline-191/Southern Victory series or the hundreds of articles on the Harry Turtledove wiki dedicated to those same books.\n\nSo when Amazing Stories‚Äò Steve Davidson asked if I wanted to interview Harry Turtledove, I was shocked, but immediately said yes. Although I went into the interview nervous as hell, I found Harry to be both humble and hilarious. Check out my interview with him below:\n\nMatt Mitrovich for Amazing Stories: You have been called the ‚Äúmaster of alternate history‚Äù, but how would you describe yourself to a stranger?\n\nHarry Turtledove: That ‚Äúmaster of alternate history‚Äù label was pinned on me by a publicist. Lord knows I don‚Äôt take it seriously. How would I describe myself? I‚Äôm somebody who wanted to write science fiction and fantasy from the age of 12 on, and who happened to wind up with a Ph.D. in Byzantine history. It‚Äôs hardly surprising a good part of my output is a-h, though I do like to remind people that not all of it is.\n\nA.S.: Did you know the members of AlternateHistory.com named their annual award after you? Any thoughts?\n\nH.T.: No, I didn‚Äôt know that. It‚Äôs flattering, but they should have named it after Leinster or de Camp or one of the other pioneers who basically turned what had been an intellectuals‚Äô tiny playground into a subgenre of sf‚Äìliberated a-h, if you like.\n\nA.S.: What got you interested in alternate history? I remember reading somewhere that you credited L. Sprague de Camp‚Äôs Lest Darkness Fall with sparking that interest.\n\nH.T.: Lest Darkness Fall was indeed some of the first a-h I read, along with things like MacKinlay Kantor‚Äôs If the South Had Won the Civil War, Phil Dick‚Äôs The Man in the High Castle and Keith Laumer‚Äôs Worlds of the Imperium. What the de Camp book did was interest me in the history of the Byzantine Empire, about which I knew nothing before I found it in a secondhand store. Had I not found it, I wouldn‚Äôt have the degree I have, I wouldn‚Äôt have written most of what I‚Äôve written (though I would have written something, because I already wanted to), I wouldn‚Äôt be married to my wife (I met her while I was teaching at UCLA when the guy I studied under had a guest gig in Greece), and I wouldn‚Äôt have had the three kids I had. Other than that, it didn‚Äôt affect my life one bit. Alternate history on the microhistorical level, if you like.\n\nA.S.: You famously said ‚ÄúFiction has to be plausible. All history has to do is happen.‚Äù Are there any historical events you find to be implausible?\n\nH.T.: Swarms of them. Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, for one, starting with his surviving World War I‚Äìthe life expectancy of a runner was commonly days or weeks, but he did it through most of the war. He got gassed once, not too badly, but he didn‚Äôt get shot. The whole story of Lee‚Äôs loss of Special Order 191 and how it ended up in McClellan‚Äôs hands is one that any Hollywood director would reject as utterly ridiculous. And the USA‚Äôs botch of everything it touched after smashing Saddam‚Äôs army in 2003 had to be seen to be disbelieved. I could go on and on and. . .\n\nA.S.: I see you have two new alternate history novels coming out this year, Joe Steele in April and Bombs Away in July. Can you describe the books for us?\n\nH.T.: Joe Steele‚Äòs breakpoint is that Mr. and Mrs. Dzugashvili emigrate from the Old World Georgia to the New World California while she‚Äôs pregnant with Iosef Vissarionevch. After changing his name to something more pronounceable (guess what?), he becomes President of the United States in 1932 instead of FDR.\n\nIn Bombs Away, the breakpoint is late 1950, in the Korean War. In real history, the Red Chinese (as we called them then) badly mauled UN (mostly American) forces at the Chosin reservoir, but most of them managed to pull back to the port of Hungnam and evacuate by sea. Here, the Chinese almost completely destroy those several divisions. MacArthur and Truman decided to use A-bombs on several Manchurian cities to keep them from flooding more men and materiel into Korea and overrunning it altogether. With Mao screaming in his ear, Stalin retaliates by similarly striking several European cities‚Äìyou hit our ally, we‚Äôll hit your pals. What would be called escalation in Vietnam ensues.\n\nA.S.: A friend of mine pointed out I can listen to the original ‚ÄúJoe Steele‚Äù short story over at Escape Pod. Is there anywhere else where people can find audio versions of your short fiction?\n\nSome of the ones I did for Tor.com are available there. Not a lot of my shorter stuff is on audio, though a good many novels are.\n\nA.S.: I also saw you have a short story coming out in SM Stirling‚Äôs The Change: Tales of Downfall and Rebirth anthology titled ‚ÄúTopanga and the Chatsworth Lancers‚Äù. Can you tell us more about that and is it going to be a homage to Stirling‚Äôs The Peshawar Lancers?\n\nH.T.: I think The Peshawar Lancers is a terrific book, but this has nothing to do with that. Chatsworth, a district of Los Angeles in the northwest part of the San Fernando Valley, is pretty wide open country. Lots of people own and raise horses. After the Change, when electricity and gunpowder are kaput, it seemed natural that some of them would turn into knights. Topanga Canyon, a bit farther south, has been countercultural for, basically, forever. There are cultural and logistical/political reasons the two regions would clash.\n\nA.S.: Any other upcoming projects you would like to talk about?\n\nH.T.: I have a really evil idea for an a-h, but I don‚Äôt have a contract for it yet. I‚Äôm waiting to hear. Stay tuned. Watch this space. üòâ\n\nA.S.: Have you had a chance to read any web original alternate histories posted and, if so, can you recommend any that were good?\n\nPlease take a moment to support Amazing Stories with a one-time or recurring donation via Patreon.
