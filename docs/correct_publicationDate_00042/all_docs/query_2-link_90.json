As the father of three girls, I have had occasion to ponder this custom. The groom’s family has an easier and more relaxed time of it. That, obviously, was part of what went into Father of the Groom. Since it is a mad-scientist story, there are also a few echoes of Theodore Sturgeon’s classic Microcosmic God running around loose. And let me state for the record that when our dear Rachel got married, she didn’t go even slightly Bridezilla.\n\nNo, it isn’t Professor Tesla Kidder’s name that marks him as a mad scientist. It isn’t the ratty, chemical-spotted lab coat or the shock of uncombed gray hair or the gold-rimmed glasses or the electrically intense blue eyes behind those glasses. It isn’t even the fact that he has an assistant named Igor (who’d been in grad school at the University of Moscow when the Soviet Union imploded, and who’d split for greener pastures right afterwards).\n\nNo, indeed. It’s none of that. By his works shall you know him.\n\nConsider, if you will, the stop light. Perhaps I should say, consider if you can. The stop light plunged an area with a radius of 1.378 miles around his Tarzana laboratory into darkness illimitable, absolute, and—it rapidly transpired—unrelieveable. That circle might be a black hole yet if the cheap AAA battery with which he powered his gadget hadn’t run out of juice after a couple of hours.\n\nOr consider his room-temperature super conductor. Professor Kidder was convinced the world would beat a path to his door (now that it could see the way again). Better he should have stuck to mousetraps. No matter how super his conductor was, who needed the poor android in an age of automated trains?\n\nThen again, you might—or, if horror disturbs you, you might not—want to contemplate his motion censor. It did just what it was designed to do, and froze the Ventura Freeway into utter immobility at morning rush hour. Once people noticed (which, given the usual state of the Ventura Freeway at morning rush hour, took some little while), an irate CHP officer pounded on his door and demanded that he turn the goddamn thing off. Traffic eventually resumed the uneven baritone of its ways.\n\nI’m not even going to talk about his microcosmic green goddess. That’s a whole ’nother kettle of sturgeon. And some things are better left to the imagination.\n\nI will tell you that lately Professor Kidder has got more and more interested in DNA and genetic engineering. This worries you? Let me tell you something—it even worries Igor.\n\nYou might imagine that, with such splendors on his curriculum vitae, Tesla Kidder lives alone, cooking in Erlenmeyer flasks over a Bunsen burner. You might, but you would be mistaken. He is happily married to Kathy, a smashing blonde, and has been for lo these many years.\n\nHow? you ask. How? you in fact, cry. Well, to put it as simply as possibly, Kathy is a bit mad, too, or more than a bit. Proof? You want proof? She breeds Weimaraners for a living. What more proof do I need?\n\nThey have a son. He looks like Tesla Kidder, except his shock of uncombed hair is brown and he wears contact lenses instead of mad-scientist specs. His name is Archimedes. Some people would get a complex about that. Young Kidder just goes by Archie. He smiles a lot, too. He’s the most normal one in the whole family—not normal, mind you, but the most normal.\n\nHe majored in physics and minored in chemistry at UCLA. Maybe they’ll issue him those gold-rimmed glasses when he starts going gray. Or maybe not. He’s head over heels in love these days, not trying to cypher out the best way to turn the moon into a giant economy-sized bowl of guacamole for God’s next Super Bowl party.\n\nHis beloved is a smashing blonde named Kate. Like father, like son? Well, yes and no. For one thing, Kate is allergic to Weimaraners—and other dogs, and anything else with four legs and fur. For another, she’s about as far from mad as you can get. While Archie’s doing the research for his doctorate, she’s finishing her MBA.\n\nBut she sure said yes when he popped the question. The two-carat rock in the engagement ring he gave her didn’t hurt, no doubt. And if Archie didn’t explain that his father had synthesized it from two carrots­, well, can you blame him? When the wind is southerly, he knows which side his bread is buttered on.\n\nKate and her folks (he does real estate; she’s an investment banker) immediately started planning the wedding. The German General Staff may have worked harder planning Hitler’s invasion of the Low Countries and France. Then again, they may not have. This was going to be The Way Kate Wanted It To Be.\n\nOr else.\n\nYou might think such elaborate—even anal—preparations would put Professor Tesla Kidder’s wind up. Mad scientist, after all, is traditionally a (small-L, please) libertarian kind of job description. For the longest time, he just smiled and nodded and went along.\n\nAnd why the hell not? All he was was the father of the groom.\n\nAt a wedding, the father of the groom is as vestigial as your coccyx (unless you happen to be the non-baboon sort of monkey, anyhow). All he has to do is show up at the rehearsal and the ceremony and drink. That’s it. He’s not even drinking booze he’s bought, because the bride’s family foots the bill.\n\nOh, he has to get a tux, too, in case he doesn’t have one or eleven hanging in a closet. But that’s okay. Mad scientists tend to look dashing and distinguished in formalwear. Here, for once, Professor Kidder conforms to a rule. He’ll try not to let it happen again.\n\nSadly, Kate also conforms to a rule. The daughter of a real-estate whiz and an investment banker is much too likely to think she has the world wrapped around her finger. Sure as the devil, dear Kate owns a whim of iron.\n\nArchie Kidder has noticed this, proving he isn’t quite blind with love or some other related four-letter word. He labors, however, under the delusion that getting away from her folks and alone with him will cure her of this, proving he is as near blind with love or some other related four-letter word as makes little difference.\n\nHis cousin Stacey has also noticed this, since she is going to be one of the bridesmaids. She is not blind with love or some other related four-letter word for Kate, even though she introduced her to Archie (which is why she is a bridesmaid). In fact, now she is rather regretting that. The more Kate issues diktats about bridesmaids’ dresses and such-like wedding arcana, the less in love (or some other related—oh, hell, you know) with Kate she becomes. She’s starting to get pissed off instead.\n\nNow, bridesmaids’ dresses could piss off a saint. And if you are currently visualizing a pissed-off saint in a bridesmaid’s dress, you are indeed the kind of person for whom this tale is intended, you poor sorry sod, you. But I digress. Bridesmaids’ dresses have the twin virtues of being expensive and, more often than not, wearable only once, because bridesmaids’ dresses look exactly like, well, bridesmaids’ dresses, and like nothing else under the Andromeda Galaxy. Most bridesmaids’ dresses come in one of two categories: the Bad and the Worse.\n\nIn Stacey’s opinion, Kate was innately oriented toward the Worse. What’s more, since it was her wedding, she was damn well going to ram the Worse down everybody else’s throat come hell or high taxes. Attempts to reason with the daughter of a real-estate hotshot and an investment banker went the way you would imagine: into a stone wall at high velocity.\n\nStacey was not pleased. Which is putting it mildly. She’s going Bridezilla on us, is what she’s doing, she said at a family gathering.\n\nNow, Stacey is, all things considered, a sweet kid. She made a point of not saying this where Archie could hear it. But she didn’t make a point of not saying it where Professor Tesla Kidder could hear it.\n\nOops. Major oops, as a fatter of mact.\n\nUp till then, Prof Kidder had been occupying himself the way he usually did at family gatherings: comparing and contrasting the flavors of various single-malt scotches. After comparing and contrasting enough of them, he could forget he was at a family gathering. And Kathy could pour him into her van and drive him home. He’d get hair from Weimaraners’ coats on his own coat, but there are worse things. A few, anyhow.\n\nIf he’d done a little more comparing and contrasting, he wouldn’t have notice Stacey’s snarking. If he had noticed, he wouldn’t have cared. But he did, and he did, respectively.\n\nYou could see his ears quiver and come to attention. (No, he hasn’t genetically engineered himself. Mad scientists like being mad scientists, except when they turn themselves into giant tarantulas or something. This is a mad writer’s trick called hyperbole—I think.)\n\nBridezilla? he murmured in tones that spread nervous indigestion from Woodland Hills all the way to North Hollywood and beyond. A metaphor perhaps worthy of reification. Yes, indeed. He’s not the kind of mad scientist who goes in for mwahaha, but if he were he would have thrown one in there.\n\nAt most family gatherings, he would have been the only one there who had any idea what the hell reification meant. And the terror that, uh, terrorized the Northridge Mall might have been averted. But Igor, who was along because the story kind of needs him to be there (and also because he kind of has the hots for Stacey), hadn’t learned English halfway. Armed with his rich vocabulary, he proceeded to ask precisely the wrong question: Are you sure that’s a good idea, boss?\n\nIt was precisely the wrong question because mad scientists are always sure their ideas are good ones. It’s part of what makes them mad scientists. Of course I’m sure that’s a good idea, dammit, Professor Tesla Kidder declared, at something over twice his usual volume.\n\nWell, I think we’d better be going, Kathy said brightly. She could tell when the comparing and contrasting might be getting a touch out of hand.\n\nBut all the way home Prof Kidder kept muttering Reification under his single-malt breath. Since his smashing blond wife didn’t know what the hell it meant (she rather thought it had something to do with East and West Germany getting together not long before Igor escaped the XSSR), she didn’t worry her pretty head about it. She didn’t worry about Weimaraner hair, either. She likes Weimaraners, remember. Nope, Tesla isn’t the only mad Kidder running around loose.\n\nA bride and a bunch of bridesmaids constitute a giggle, which is something like a gaggle but shriller and squeakier. You can recognize giggles because they descend on bridal shops and malls with open credit cards. They are going to have fun, and somebody else is going to pay for it. But, to quote from the Gospel according to Theodore, don’t worry; I’m not going political on you.\n\nInstead, I’m going to the Northridge Mall with Kate and Stacey and the rest of the girls. And at the same time, thanks to the miracle of narrative, I’ll also go to Professor Tesla Kidder’s laboratory.\n\nKate is saying, in a voice that puts some of the bridesmaids in mind of a slightly off-center grinding wheel working its slow way through a fat nail, No, you’re not going to use those handbags. You’re going to use these over here. These over here are larger and homelier and cost more. One of the bridesmaids has the gumption to point this out.\n\nKate’s face curdles into an expression that would make even love-addled Archie think twice if he were there to see it. She wheels out the heavy artillery: It’s my wedding, and we’re going to do it the way I want to.\n\nStacey’s mouth forms the word Bridezilla once more, silently this time. Two other bridesmaids read her lips and … giggle. What else?\n\nProfessor Kidder reads her lips, too. Hooking his laboratory up to all the surveillance cameras in the mall is child’s play for a mad scientist. Hell, Igor handled half the design work on the device that lets him do it, and Igor isn’t even a mad scientist. He’s just an Igor. (And of course Professor Kidder reads lips. Read lips? Professor Kidder practically writes lips. He’s a mad scientist’s mad scientist, Tesla Kidder is.)\n\nHe frowns. Someone should do something abut this personage, he says. No, he’s not talking about Stacey. Something … instructive. He nods to himself, liking the word. Yes. Instructive. And he remembers another word he likes: Reification.\n\nYou shouldn’t take too much on yourself, boss, Igor says quickly. Once the strain of the wedding is over, she’ll be fine.\n\nBut Tesla Kidder isn’t listening any more. Not listening is another hallmark of mad scientists. Professor Kidder thinks. Then he explodes into experimentation. No, no, not literally. It has happened to a mad scientist or three, sure. Not to Prof Kidder. He’s a carefully mad scientist.\n\nHe pulls a mouse out of his lab-coat pocket to test the genetic recodifier he’s cooked up. You don’t keep mice in your pocket? Too bad. I already told you the lab coat was ratty.\n\nEverything works at least as well as he hoped it would. Igor has the privilege of hunting down the recodified mouse. A fire extinguisher keeps him from suffering anything worse than second-degree burns.\n\nHe passes on to Professor Kidder a piece of advice from his student days in the vanished Soviet Union: Make sure they can’t trace it back to you.\n\nInteresting, Tesla Kidder replies. I don’t believe they know I’m working on a long-range genetic recodifier.\n\nUrk, says Igor. He hadn’t known that himself. He hadn’t imagined such a thing was possible. He is, after all, only an Igor.\n\nI didn’t plan to field-test it so soon. Still and all, under the circumstances, no doubt it’s justified. No doubt at all. As I’ve mentioned before, Prof Kidder doesn’t come equipped with doubts. It’s … a lodge pin, like.\n\nBeing only an Igor, Igor does have them. What about Stacey? he asks. He also comes equipped with the usual male ductless glands. Anything happening to Archie Kidder’s cousin would be a great waste of natural resources, as far as he’s concerned.\n\nTcha! Tesla Kidder says, which may mean anything or nothing—he’s a master of mad-scientistspeak. He pulls from a shelf not anything or nothing, but something, definitely something. To Igor, it doesn’t especially look like a long-range genetic recodifier, but who the devil knows what a long-range genetic recodifier is supposed to look like?\n\nProf Kidder flicks a switch on the something. He adjusts a dial, then another one—fussily, till they’re both just right. Then he punches a button. The something makes a noise. It isn’t a great big noise. Then again, it isn’t a great big something. A beam of light shoots out. Professor Kidder scowls. That isn’t supposed to happen. He pushes another button. The light vanishes. He checks the rest of the instrumentation. By his satisfied grunt, the something still works.\n\nWhich means we return to the mall. Kate and the giggle of bridesmaids are in Bed, Bath and Beyond, discussing scented soap. (Testing the recodifier on the mouse and calibrating the long-range version do take a little while, you know.) To be precise—which we’d better be, in a story involving a mad scientist—Kate is discoursing about scented soap. A bad habit, discoursing. Kate is firmly convinced of the superiority of lime to frangipani, sandalwood, or any other scent in the explored universe. Very firmly convinced.\n\nOne of the other bridesmaids whispers to Stacey, She’s even starting to look like a lime.\n\nIt’s just the fluorescent lighting. Stacey, after all, has spent time around a mad scientist. She’s tried to explain impossible things before.\n\nBut it’s not just the fluorescent lighting, and things keep right on getting impossibler. Kate’s complexion goes from lime to Hass avocado: dark green and bumpylumpy. More and more bumpylumpy. Scaly, even. Where has that muzzle come from, with all those sharp teeth? To say nothing of the tail? No, we have to tell some kind of tale of the telltale tail, but not much.\n\nKate starts to say something else, presumably more about the magnificent wonderfulness of lime. What comes out, however, isn’t exactly English. It isn’t even approximately English. It’s a bubbling shriek of about the volume you would use if you wanted to set Mount Everest running for an air-raid shelter.\n\nWhat else comes out is a blast of fire. It’s Kate’s very first one, so it’s not a huge blast of fire. But it’s plenty to set several cardboard boxes burning, and it’s plenty to make the giggle of bridesmaids stop giggling and start running. Running like hell, if, once more, you want to be precise.\n\nThe Bed, Bath and Beyond sales staff also opt for Beyond, and at top speed, too. Their customer-service training does not involve dealing with dinosaurian monsters, even ones that just stop in for soap.\n\nKate follows them out of the store. She hasn’t fully figured out what’s happened to her. Well, neither has anyone else but Professor Tesla Kidder, and he’s off in another part of the narrative somewhere. She tries to complain. More bubbling shrieks come forth. So does more flame. Lots more flame. She’s getting the hang of it.\n\nWhen you are on fire, a man once said from agonizing personal experience, people get out of your way. And they get out of your way even faster when you breathe fire. Panic roars through the clothed mall-rats of Northridge.\n\nRun for your life! a woman screams. It really is Bridezilla!\n\nHow can she tell? Simple. On the second digit of Kate’s left forepaw (not the fourth, because the forepaw has only two digits once the genetic recodifying gets done) still sparkles Archie Kidder’s two-carat rock.\n\nAnd when people aren’t running, they’re aiming cell-phone cameras at Kate and zapping the stills and videos to every TV station and newspaper in town (lots of the former; not much left of the latter). Some of them even think to call the police, the fire department, and the SPCA.\n\nMedia frenzies have been built from less. From much less, to tell you the truth. Cars, vans, and all the helicopters not covering the latest freeway chase—say, about as many as the Brazilian Air Force owns—converge on the Northridge Mall. Dinosaur runs amok! a blow-dried airhead shouts breathlessly into his mike. Details after this message!\n\nBefore the impotence-drug commercial can even finish, Professor Tesla Kidder’s cell phone blorps. Mm, how would you describe the noise a theremin makes? And what else would a mad scientist use for a ring tone?\n\nYes? he says.\n\nNo, his wife tells him firmly. I don’t know what you’ve done, but stop doing it. Undo it, if you can—and you’d better be able to. She hangs up before he can get out even one more word.\n\nAnd, before he can put the phone back in his pocket (no, not the pocket the mouse came from—mice gnaw on phones), it blorps again. Once more, he raises it to the side of his head. Yes?\n\nDad! Archie sounds reproachful, not firm. That may be even worse. Fix it, will you please? Kate’ll be fine as soon as the ceremony’s over and the pressure’s off. C’mon!\n\nSo much for Make sure they can’t trace it back to you. His family sure doesn’t have any trouble. The police and fire department don’t know him as well. Even so … How much damage can a real Bridezilla do in a mall? How expensive will that damage be? Tesla Kidder is a mad scientist, but he isn’t a stupid scientist. No way, José.\n\nHis calculations take but a moment. Oh, all right, he says, and, if he sounds a trifle sulky, it’s only because he is. Back into the pocket goes the phone.\n\nHe recalibrates the long-range genetic recodifier. The police don’t call. The fire department doesn’t, either. No one pounds on the laboratory door. (Remembering Moscow nights, even Moscow nights under perestroika and glasnost, Igor is relieved.) No reporters show up asking for comments. They’re all too busy trying to sound blasé about this Mesozoic irruption into the bastion of modern American capitalism.\n\nProf Kidder pushes the button on his device again. No annoying extraneous beam of light this time. Tesla Kidder beams himself. He’s fixed that, anyhow.\n\nWe return, then, to the mall to await developments. The Kateosaurus­ with the flashy engagement ring has just flamed a Cadillac­ Escalade in the parking lot. The SUV’s fuel tank, a reservoir containing the essence of Lord knows how many dinosaurs, sends a column of greasy black smoke into the sky to mark their final return to the environment.\n\nAfter a roar of triumph, the Creature from the Lime Soap Lagoon advances purposefully on a van even bigger than the Escalade (and they said it couldn’t be done!). On the side of the van is blazoned EYEWITLESS­ NEWS. Another burbling roar. Another blast of flame. But—disappointingly, at least to Prof Kidder—only a small one. The news van gets scorched, but does not become as one with Nineveh and Tyre and the unmourned Escalade.\n\nKidder sighs. I should have waited another minute or two. Oh, well.\n\nFor Bridezilla is undergoing another transformation—another recodification, if you will. Not from real-estate whiz and investment banker’s kid to fire-breathing monster, but the reverse. To Tesla Kidder, who is thinking about Archie, going this way may be the more frightening. With a fire-breathing monster, at least, you know ahead of time what you’re getting. You don’t have to find out later, the hard way.\n\nIn the Northridge parking lot, Kate—yes, she’s Kate again—looks vaguely confused. She doesn’t remember a whole lot of what just happened. As Bridezilla, she had a brain about the size of a walnut. Most MBA candidates come with a little more cranial capacity than that.\n\nMost reporters? It’s an open question. Anyone watching the subsequent interview between the TV guy and the recently ex-dinosaur would doubt that the intelligence level of the planet’s dominant species has changed much over the past 65,000,000 years.\n\nProfessor Tesla Kidder puts the long-range genetic recodifier back on the shelf. Maybe he’ll need it again one of these days. Well, Igor, he says, what shall we work on next?\n\nIgor is still watching the aftermath of chaos on TV. Maybe staying in Moscow would have been better than this, or at least less wearing. But maybe not, too. That may be the scariest thought of all.\n\nThe wedding is a great success. If everything smells a bit too strongly of lime, well, you can live with lime. After the vows, before the minister tells Archie he may kiss the bride, he beats the guy to the punch. Kiss me, Kate! he says, and she does. If she doesn’t quite grok why he’s got that kind of smile on his face while he says it, you have to remember she’s only someone who’s finishing an MBA.\n\nAt the reception, Kate’s mother comes up to Tesla Kidder, champagne flute in hand. Hey, listen, she says, you didn’t have anything to do with the, ah, unfortunate incident, didja? That’s what Kate’s family—and their lawyers—have taken to calling the scaly, incendiary rampage through the mall.\n\nHow could I possibly? Professor Kidder answers. I was in my laboratory the whole time. You can ask Igor, if you like. He was there with me.\n\nActually, Kate’s mom can’t ask Igor right this second. He’s out on the dance floor with Stacey (who smells, defiantly, of frangipani). Kate’s mother nods, as if in wisdom. Okay, she says. That’s what I already heard, anyways. You have to remember, she’s only an investment banker. Mad scientists? They’re right out of her league.\n\nWE INSTALL\n\nThis one is my daughter Rebecca’s fault. Living in sunny Southern California, we put up with visits from, among other people, solar-power-company salespeople hawking their outfits’ products door-to-door. After I sent yet another one of them away without buying, I noticed that she was giggling.\n\nWhat’s funny? I asked.\n\nDidn’t you hear what he said? she answered. He said, ‘We install solar systems.’\n\nI thought about that. Oh. I laughed, too, and went on, Well, if I write the story, I’ll give you a chunk of the check. A few days later, I wrote it, and she did get a piece of what I got for it.\n\nSo the doorbell rings. So for a wonder it’s twenty minutes before dinner, not during. So okay, I heave my butt out of the recliner and go to the door. There’s a kind of dweeby-looking guy on my front porch. Khakis. Dark blue polo shirt with a company logo on the left breast. Plastic badge on a lanyard around his neck. Clipboard.\n\nNot likely to be a home-invasion robber. Possible, sure, but not likely. So I open the door. Yes? I say.\n\nHi. He smiles almost like he means it. My name’s Eric. He holds up his badge. The badge’s name is Eric, anyway.\n\nI nod. I say, And? I wait.\n\nI’m with Superior Solar. He taps the logo on his chest. We install solar systems, and we’re going through your neighborhood now offering some very attractive discounts. Putting in a new solar system can save you some serious money, you know.\n\nWhen I open the door, I expect I’ll listen to his spiel and go We’re not interested, thanks. It’s like there’s a tape in my head. A salesman comes, I listen to his spiel, I go We’re not interested, thanks, and I shut the door. Spiel runs long, I shut it before he finishes.\n\nOnly not today. I turn and I yell, Debbie! Hey, Debbie!\n\nWhat? my wife yells from the kitchen. That’s where the good smells come from. Twenty minutes till dinnertime, remember?\n\nThere’s a guy from Superior Solar on the porch. When she’s in the kitchen, she can’t hardly hear the bell ring. He says they got good deals on new solar systems.\n\nWell, talk to him, for crying out loud, she says. The one that came with this place is old as the hills, and it’s a piece of junk.\n\nShe’s right, no two ways about it. She is. That old solar system’s given us nothing but trouble ever since we moved in here. And when she goes talk to him, that means we can finally afford to replace the miserable thing. Debbie minds the checkbook around here. Tell me it’s not like that at your house, pal.\n\nSo okay, I say, C’mon in, Eric. Let’s talk abut these deals of yours.\n\nSo he spreads his pictures and his price list out on the dining-room table. And right away I see a system I like. It’s got good power, and the price looks okay to me. I call Debbie over to make sure I’m not getting us in too deep. She thinks for a minute. Then she says, Yeah, we can swing that.\n\n\"We will swing that, I tell Eric. How soon can you install it?\"\n\nWe’ve got a tech crew in the neighborhood, he says. We’ll start tomorrow morning. If it’s a straightforward job, we should be done by late afternoon. Any chance I can get up on your roof now so I can see what we’ll have to do in the replacement process?\n\nI ask Debbie a question with my eyebrows. She goes, I’ll turn supper down.\n\nI lean the ladder against the side of the house. We both go up there (I check to see Eric’s insured first). He’s good and careful on the slope; it’s not like he’s never done this before. He steps over the oorts and kuipers out at the edge (smart—those little bastards’ll freeze your ankles off if you give ’em half a chance) and bends down to take a look at the power unit in the center of the system.\n\nHe kinda grunts. You could do with a new one, all right. This one here’s gotta be close to 5X10E9.\n\nI told you—this system was in place when we bought the house, I say.\n\nThey don’t usually last past 1X10E10, not ones this size. They blow up on you, make all kinds of trouble. You’re smart to replace while it’s still kinda working. Eric takes out a loupe and inspects the sixth wanderer. What happened here? What’s up with the ring?\n\nA couple of the outliers smashed together a while ago and broke up. Didn’t seem to hurt anything much, so I just left it alone."
