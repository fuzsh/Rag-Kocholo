She was considered by many to be a “good girl.” She attended a Christian high school with her closest friend, Hilary Faye, and her seemingly perfect boyfriend, Dean. However, life for Mary was just too good to be true. Her life was turned upside down when Dean admitted to her that he was gay. Mary then took it upon herself to try to help him become straight by offering her virginity to him. A series of mishaps ensued despite Mary’s best intentions. Dean was sent away to a center for gay Christian teens, and Mary discovered that she was pregnant. Hilary turned on Mary as soon as she found out, and began to smear her good reputation. It’s up to Mary and her new friend, Cassandra, to find the solution to her problems."
