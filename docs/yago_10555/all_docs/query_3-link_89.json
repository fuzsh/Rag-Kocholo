        "text": "SAVE US are an alternative rock/metal group founded in ‘23, with members spanning two continents. SAVE US explores the human condition delivering emotionally charged hooks nestled in atmospheric textures, fusing together a myriad of sounds ranging from the intensely heavy to the beautifully vulnerable, taking the listener on a journey through the many facets of the human mind.\n\nFollowing on from big singles ‘Distance’ and more, SAVE US will release their fifth single ‘Haunt’ on UK label Year Of The Rat Records on the 24th November. In their incredibly short time as a band, they have already had support from MTV Gonzo, BBC Radio 1, Metal Hammer, Prog, Kerrang Radio, RTE2XM, Idobi Howl, Amazing Radio, Dreambound, BBC Coventry, Total Rock, TIDAL, Pandora, Forever Loud, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify, Deezer, BBC Bristol and more. The band also recently announced they will release their debut EP ‘LUCID’ on the 8th December, with plenty more music to come before then.\n\nMiguel Owls - “Haunt dives into the struggles of being lost in the past. It explains how these thoughts always find a way to reach the surface pulling you into a downward spiral. Writing this song wasn't easy. I had to put myself in a vulnerable state of mind, but I wanted this song to be authentic and connect with others with similar struggles.” On the EP he continues - “The Lucid EP is a collection of songs exploring the human condition with an undertone questioning what any of it means, if at all, is it real? Sonically the songs traverse between heavy, intense moments married with emotive vocals, When writing this record we wanted to build atmospheres and give a sense of misdirect, taking the listener by surprise as we fuse together multiple genres, removing any barriers. The writing process was a crunch, wanting to launch the same year as forming the band, which was a challenge not only because of time constraints but working in two different time zones. That said, we are really happy with what we created over that time and can’t wait to release it into the world!”\n\nSAVE US - Haunt (Video) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Bvh-B5bsI\n\nLUCID EP Pre-Orders - https://saveus1.bandcamp.com/album/lucid"
