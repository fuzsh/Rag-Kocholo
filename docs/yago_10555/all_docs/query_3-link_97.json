        "text": "Save and Release\n\nIt is important that users working in collaboration with customers, suppliers, and other users ensure that all models are saved in the same version and release of CATIA.\n\nCATIA is only backwards compatible, meaning that if the user saves a file in CATIA V5R20, they would no longer be able to open the models in an earlier release such as CATIA V5R18. The naming format changes with later releases of CATIA V5 which are compatible with ENOVIA V6. These release numbers are defined in a format whereby the year of release is identified; e.g. CATIA V5-6R2015. In this example, the version of CATIA is still V5 and the release can be ‘nicknamed’ R25.\n\nCurrent Releases still in Use:\n\nCATIA V5R18\n\nCATIA V5R19\n\nCATIA V5R20\n\nCATIA V5R21\n\nCATIA V5-6R2012 (V5R22)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2013 (V5R23)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2014 (V5R24)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2015 (V5R25)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2016 (V5R26)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2017 (V5R27)\n\nCATIA V5-6R2018 (V5R28)\n\nSo What Happens If You Try to Open a CATIA V5 File in a Lower Release?\n\nThe below image shows a typical error message obtained when a user tries to open a CATIA V5 file in a lower release than it was last saved in:\n\nIn order to determine which release of CATIA V5 was last saved in:\n\nFind the .CATPart file (smaller in size the better) and open it in a notepad:\n\nEnsuring the mouse cursor is at the top line, perform a find (CRTL+F) and search for string “save”:\n\nUpon pressing “Find Next”, find the line which states your release:\n\nIn the above example, this particular CATIA V5. CATPart file was last saved in CATIA V5-6R2018 (CATIA V5R28), thus can only be opened on this release or higher."
