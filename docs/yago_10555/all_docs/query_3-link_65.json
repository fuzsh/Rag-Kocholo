        "text": "With so much music coming out from artists all over the world, it can feel overwhelming trying to make your own music shine through the masses. If you’ve got a new release on Spotify that you want to get as much exposure as possible on, Found.ee has tons of features to help you do just that. If that sounds good to you, here are 4 things you should try…\n\n4 Found.ee Pre-Save & Release Page Features To Try This Year\n\nEmbed Your Shopify Widget\n\nWith found.ee, you can embed your Shopify store directly into your music release page. This means that fans who like your music can scroll down, shop your merch, and complete a checkout without ever leaving your music release page.\n\nAmazon Music Pre-Save\n\nFound.ee’s pre-save tool was the first of its kind to launch Amazon Music pre-save capabilities. With it, you can set up Amazon Music pre-save to give your music its best chance at editorial and playlisting support from Amazon.\n\nOne-Click Spotify Pre-Saves\n\nWith this feature, you can deep links directly from social apps to the Spotify app, eliminating the typical extra steps of the past. When fans click on pre-save links, they’ll enjoy a smooth transition to Spotify without any annoying mini-browser interruptions. The one-click Spotify Pre-Save is now live, and replaces the previous fan flow automatically. Plus it works for both iPhones and Androids.\n\nEvergreen Pre-Saves\n\nIf you’d like to start collecting pre-saves for a release that hasn’t had a release date confirmed yet, you can do so with found.ee. Just create a pre-save page and set a release date in the far future (and leave the UPC field blank). Share your pre-save page far and wide – and when the time comes to announce your new single, updating the pre-save page with the correct release date and UPC will turn those sign-ups into pre-saves for your new single.\n\n//\n\nWant to learn more about Found.ee?
