        "text": "Robert Plant will release his first music with new band Saving Grace, giving everyone who purchases a ticket to the November UK tour a digital copy of the song “As I Roved Out”.\n\nThe band have been performing together since 2019 but have not yet officially released any music, despite having already recorded an album and Plant trademarking the band name for music and merchandise.\n\nFollowing the announcement on August 15 of a November UK tour for Saving Grace, Plant’s Facebook post announcing the tour was edited on August 16 to add the announcement of the band’s first music being released.\n\n“Ticket buyers for this upcoming UK November tour will receive a download link to a brand-new Saving Grace track. ‘As I Roved Out’ is available exclusively to ticket purchasers,” the post now says.\n\nSaving Grace has frequently performed “As I Roved Out” during the band’s live shows:\n\nThe Saving Grace journey\n\nPlant’s newest band has an unusual online existence, with no official band website or social media channels. Instead, news about the band is announced through the social media profiles of the individual band members.\n\nThere is a YouTube account called “nobody knows” that does appear to be connected to the band, however. It released two professionally filmed black and white performance clips of Saving Grace in 2020.\n\nA Saving Grace album is seemingly on the way, with Plant confirming recording sessions in England while on stage last year and other clues backing up the idea.\n\nSaving Grace’s first performance was on January 25, 2019 in Shropshire. Since then the band has extensively toured Europe, although a US tour was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe Saving Grace trademark\n\nLedZepNews revealed in 2021 that a British business owned by Plant secured trademarks for “Saving Grace” across Europe and the US in order to block anyone else from using that band name to release music or merchandise.\n\nPlant has never taken out trademarks for his solo projects before, making this an unusual step that could indicate longterm interest in the Saving Grace project.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, lawyers representing a London company named Trolcharm Limited filed applications in Europe and the US to trademark “Saving Grace”.\n\nPlant owns more than 75% of Trolcharm Limited, according to Companies House filings in the UK. His three surviving children are directors of the business along with Plant.\n\nThe business owns the copyright to much of Plant’s solo career and is frequently credited in the liner notes of his albums, including “Raise The Roof.”\n\nThe trademark applications, which were all eventually approved, include the following fields:\n\n▪ Audio and video recordings including digital downloads and CDs\n\n▪ Live music footage\n\n▪ Posters, stickers and magazines\n\n▪ Bags, wallets, umbrellas and luggage\n\n▪ Clothing including footwear and headgear\n\nTaking out trademarks for his musical projects is a rarity for Plant. He hasn’t applied to trademark the names of his previous solo bands Strange Sensation, the Band of Joy or the Sensational Space Shifters.\n\nPlant hasn’t trademarked his own name, either, unlike Jimmy Page who does own trademarks to protect his personal brand including his name, his autograph and the word “ZOSO.”\n\nThe Saving Grace filings are the only trademark applications ever filed by Trolcharm Limited or any other business used by Plant to run his solo career.\n\nThe presence of trademark filings don’t always mean that the trademark holder will actually launch the product or service they have the trademarks for."
