        "text": "Animation fans received some happy news today amid the bleakness of Warner Bros' continued animation cull as Ketchup Entertainment announced the acquisition of The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie's North American distribution rights.\n\nThe acquisition ensures that the new Looney Tunes film, which was screened as the the 2024 Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June, will make it into theatres amid continued uncertainly around Warner Bros' animation catalog.\n\n“The Day the Earth Blew Up is a historical moment for the Looney Tunes franchise, and we are proud to be partnering with Warner Bros. Animation to bring this film to audiences theatrically. We cannot wait for audiences of all ages to experience one of the smartest animated films in recent years,” Ketchup Entertainment CEO Gareth West said in a statement.\n\nWe gave The Day the Earth Blew Up a positive review after its debut, writing, \"The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie has enough gags per minute to leave audiences short of breath with laughter, but also a big heart that shows why these characters are so beloved even after nearly 90 years. With crisp animation, some truly hilarious and bizarre gags, and a plot that hearkens back to 1950s sci-fi, this is the Looney Tunes movie fans have been waiting for.\"\n\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up was previously greenlit for Max but was subequently among Warner Bros' content write-offs. Nevertheless, Warner Bros. Animation was permitted to shop it elsewhere as production continued, with Ketchup Entertainment ultimately stepping in to help with distribution.\n\nOther Looney Tunes films have been less fortunate. In 2023, Warner Bros. shelved Coyote vs Acme after failing to find a buyer, sparking widespread condemnation from animation enthusiasts. Cartoon Network is among the channels facing uncertainty as Warner Bros. continues as the company continues to struggle across the board.\n\nFor more, check out all the rest of the biggest movies coming out in 2024."
