Or, worse, she’s on the phone with you describing how her marriage is currently in a freefall and begging you for some advice. (...listen for more!)\n\nAs mentioned in the episode:\n\n5 Ways to Be There For a Friend Who Is Having Marriage Troubles (HelloGiggles)\n\nL.A. Affairs: I went on a date with my dead ex-boyfriend (Los Angeles Times)\n\nHost & executive producer: Melinda Hill.\n\nProducer & editor: Todd Donald.\n\nMusic by The Polarity & Skipp Whitman.\n\nVisit MelindaHill.com and follow Melinda on Facebook, Instagram, IMDb, Twitter, YouTube & Yelp\n\nThis is a very special episode. It is near and dear to my heart. Have you ever wanted to have one last chance to say things to a deceased loved one? What would you say if you had that chance, if you could get all your unanswered questions answered? What would it look and feel like to have closure, forgiveness and peace with someone you loved, but it ended weirdly or badly or abubtly or in some other way you didn’t like? How would those feelings show up in other places in your life for you? How would you show up differently in your life if you had that closure, that peace if unsaid things were said?\n\nThis episode is about what happened when I had the opportunity to get closure and peace. On Halloween 2021, the L.A. Times published my story, titled “I went on a date with my dead ex-boyfriend”. This podcast episode today is very special to me because it’s the actual session with a psychic medium that I had which inspired my true story published in the L.A. Times, the behind the scenes of me re-connecting with my deceased ex.\n\nAs mentioned in the episode:\n\nL.A. Affairs: I went on a date with my dead ex-boyfriend (Los Angeles Times)\n\nMedium Lisa (Psychic Medium)\n\nHost & executive producer: Melinda Hill. Producer & editor: Todd Donald. Music by The Polarity & Skipp Whitman. Visit MelindaHill.com and follow Melinda on Facebook, Instagram, IMDb, Twitter, YouTube & Yelp\n\nSo this episode is about the concept of a self-partnered honeymoon, how I came up with it, why I did it and my whole experience and journey with it. It's really just about ultimately not waiting on a partner or any other external circumstance in order to live your best life, now. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nAs mentioned in the episode:\n\nMelinda Hill's Self-Partnered Honeymoon : YouTube videoHotel Nômade Tulum | Luxury Tents, Villas & WellnessMia Selina : BeachClub & Restaurant\n\nHost & executive producer: Melinda Hill.

The little girl whose mom forgot to take her to Disneyland grew up to voice a myriad of Disney characters in addition to Prince Puppycorn from Unikitty, Daphne Blake in the Scooby-Doo franchise, Sherri and Terri from The Simpsons, Betty Rubble and more. She discusses how growing up with addiction made her into a chameleon focused on fixing others and how she's now refocusing that energy. Plus we address dating on Raya, dating during Covid and her psychic's predictions for the 2020 pandemic and election. ***Please note this is Part 1 of Grey's interview.

He also stresses the importance of knowing what to do with yourself when others aren't able to figure it out & choosing to fill the mind with PBS over people getting punched in the face. Oh and he wrote a book called ZOMBIE RUN! What can't he do?!"
