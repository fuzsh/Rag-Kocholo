        "text": "And, that’s a wrap! That normally signifies the end, but for these films, it was their new beginning. And a welcome new beginning too, because without some extensive reshoots, we might have never known how great these movies could be. Everyone involved loved the script enough to start shooting, but somewhere during (or even after) production, a massive problem became evident. Sometimes they were lucky, and caught it early, but as you are about to see, sometimes the entire movie needed a complete overhaul.\n\nDon’t get us wrong, there are times when reshoots completely fail to save their movies. But thankfully, directors, producers, studio execs, and test audiences gave these movies a once over, and then a makeover. If they hadn't, we would now be living in an alternate reality where Rocky gives up and E.T. dies! Join us for those and 13 other movies that were completely saved by reshoots."
