        "text": "Ahead of Daylight Saving Time, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) reintroduced the Sunshine Protection Act of 2023 for the 118th Congress. The legislation would end the antiquated practice of changing clocks twice a year.\n\n“This ritual of changing time twice a year is stupid. Locking the clock has overwhelming bipartisan and popular support. This Congress, I hope that we can finally get this done.” – Senator Rubio\n\nU.S. Representative Vern Buchanan (R-FL) introduced companion legislation in the House.\n\n“There are enormous health and economic benefits to making daylight saving time permanent. Florida lawmakers have already voted to make daylight saving time permanent in my home state and Congress should pass the Sunshine Protection Act to move Florida and the rest of the country to year-round daylight saving time.” – Representative Buchanan\n\nSenators James Lankford (R-OK), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tina Smith (D-MN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) are original cosponsors of the legislation.\n\n“Twice a year Oklahomans ask themselves—why do we still have to change our clocks? Last year, the Senate unanimously passed the Sunshine Protection Act, but the House never even voted on the bill. Every Mom of young children hates this time of year when alarm clocks change, but baby’s clocks don’t. It is past time to get this bill to the President’s desk so we can take the stress, headaches, and annoying twice-a-year reset of the clocks out of our lives. It’s time to lock the clocks.” – Senator Lankford\n\n“Alabamians have overwhelmingly expressed their support for the Sunshine Protection Act, and I promised them I’d continue pushing to do away with the outdated practice of adjusting our clocks twice a year. It’s time for America to move forward and stop falling back. Congress should listen to the people and make Daylight Saving Time permanent.” – Senator Tuberville\n\n“Over the years, I’ve fought and won to extend daylight saving time—adding two months’ worth of sun to the American people’s calendar. It’s past time for Congress to broaden its horizons and finally make daylight saving time permanent. With the Sunshine Protection Act, we can shine a light on the darkest days of the year and deliver more sun, more smiles, and brighter skies.” – Senator Markey\n\n“Switching our clocks back and forth every year is a pointless exercise that robs us of daylight hours during the darkest time of the year. After passing with unanimous support last year, I hope we can get this bill across the finish line this Congress. Minnesota is ready to make the switch to permanent daylight saving time.” – Senator Smith\n\n“Permanent daylight saving means more time in the sunshine and that’s something everybody should support. Changing the clock twice a year is outdated and unnecessary. I’m proud to be leading this bipartisan legislation with Senator Rubio that makes a much-needed change and benefits so many in Florida and across the nation. When I was governor of Florida, I was proud to sign this bill into law on the state level, and I will continue this effort in Congress. We need to get it all the way over the finish line this time. It’s time for Congress to act and pass this good bill today.” – Senator Rick Scott\n\n“Many Mississippians, especially those in agriculture, agree that ending the disruptive practice of re-setting our clocks would bring public safety improvements, economic benefits, and even mental health benefits to our nation. I’m proud to again cosponsor the Sunshine Protection Act in an effort to make permanent Daylight Saving Time a reality.” – Senator Hyde-Smith\n\n“The Sunshine Protection Act will allow states the freedom to decide if they want to permanently follow Daylight Saving Time or not without needing approval from Congress. I’m glad to join Sen. Rubio in introducing this commonsense legislation.”— Senator Paul\n\n“It’s time to put a stop to the twice-a-year time-change madness. Science and common sense show that more year-round daylight would improve our health, help kids spend a bit more time enjoying outdoor after school activities, and encourage folks to support local businesses while on a sunny stroll in their communities. I’m all in to get the Sunshine Protection Act passed into law at last.” – Senator Wyden"
