        "text": "(Welcome to ...And More, our no-frills, zero B.S. guide to when and where you can watch upcoming movies and shows, and everything else you could possibly stand to know.)\n\nDid you know that \"Saved by the Bell,\" the popular '90s television show, has a 2020 reboot? Did you also know that this reboot was greenlit for a second season back in January of this year?\n\nYou probably did, if you're reading this article. Read on to learn everything we know about season 2 of \"Saved by the Bell,\" including when you can watch it.\n\nPeacock's \"Saved by the Bell\" takes place in the same world as the original \"Saved by the Bell.\" The original high school kids are all grown up, but they are still involved in the reboot, some more than others.\n\nIn the new series, Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) is now the governor of California. The first season saw him \"get into hot water\" for closing too many underfunded high schools, so he decides to send the affected students to the wealthiest schools in the state, which includes his alma mater, Bayside High. The show revolves around the new kids giving Bayside's rich students a healthy dose of reality. Laughs ensue.\n\nSeason 2 will have the high school kids competing in the Southern California School Spirit Competition, which I'm sure will be a spirited affair (I'm sorry)."
