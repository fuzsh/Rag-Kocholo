        "text": "If turtles could fly, the five brought to West Dennis Beach on Tuesday evening would certainly have done so in their eagerness to return to the ocean.\n\nThe four Kemp’s ridley sea turtles and lone loggerhead spent the last several months at the New England Aquarium's sea turtle hospital in Quincy, after they were found cold-stunned on the beaches of Cape Cod last fall and winter. The turtles were treated for hypothermia-related conditions such as pneumonia, dehydration, and emaciation.\n\nTuesday, they came out of their carrying crates with flippers flailing, ready to swim.\n\nWith a crowd of onlookers gathered around a roped-off square of sand, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, lifted the first of them, a Kemp's ridley named Tulip, and proclaimed, \"Tulip is ready to go! This is going to be the biggest day of the year for Tulip.\"\n\nMoments later, as the turtle slipped into the surf and disappeared amidst cheers and applause, Markey waved it farewell. \"Happy travels, Tulip!\"\n\nWell-wishers followed the other four turtles. Along with Markey, state Sen. Susan Moran, D-Falmouth, New England Aquarium President and CEO Vikki Spruill, Mass Audubon President David O'Neill, and sea turtle hospital Director Adam Kennedy helped with the release.\n\nFor Tulip, Lupine, Bluebonnet and Violet, all endangered Kemp's ridley turtles, and the 100-pound Marsh Mallow, a threatened loggerhead, the release culminated months of intensive care.\n\n\"These turtles have been through a lot,\" said Spruill. \"We rescued 394 turtles this year, and that's just a remarkable thing.\"\n\nThe effort requires a small army of volunteers coordinated through Mass Audubon’s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, in addition to rehabilitators, marine veterinarians and researchers.\n\n'One step closer to keeping our shelled friends safe.'\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund says that nearly all sea turtle species worldwide are endangered.\n\nIn support of conservation work in New England and elsewhere in the U.S., Markey has been working to advance the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act — a bipartisan and bicameral bill that creates a permanent $30 million grant program through the Department of Commerce to fund stranded sea turtle rescue, rehabilitation and research.\n\nOn July 31, the legislation moved out of the Senate Commerce Committee by unanimous consent, adding to the celebratory mood on Tuesday.\n\nIntroduced by Congressman William Keating a year ago, the legislation won approval from the U.S. House of Representatives in April — particularly good news for local conservationists who annually see some of the highest numbers of cold-stunned turtles washing up on Cape Cod beaches.\n\nWith the recent support from the Senate committee, Markey said, \"we are now one step closer to keeping our shelled friends safe.\"\n\n'Increasing numbers of stranded sea turtles.'\n\nCurrent rescue efforts are predominantly volunteer and underfunded, but sea turtles face increasing risks that make strandings more likely, including temperature changes, pollution, boat strikes and entanglement in marine debris.\n\n\"We have been seeing increasing numbers of stranded sea turtles,\" said O'Neill.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2023, the number of cold-stunned turtles rescued from Cape Cod beaches during the late fall and winter rose from 50 to 900. Rescuers have retrieved many critically endangered Kemp's ridley turtles — the world's smallest sea turtle species — from Cape shores, in addition to endangered green sea turtles, vulnerable leatherbacks and loggerhead turtles.\n\nClimate change has a role in increased strandings. The Gulf of Maine is recognized as the second fastest warming body of water in the world. Connected to it is Cape Cod Bay, where warming ocean temperatures linger longer every year, resulting in sea turtles misreading cues to begin migrating south in the fall and winter. When water temperatures fall suddenly, many turtles become stranded.\n\nWellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary's role\n\nThe Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary team coordinates more than 200 volunteers to rescue cold-stunned turtles during the season, which usually spans from November to January.\n\n\"It's extraordinary what they do,\" O'Neill said. \"They are on the beaches day and night looking for turtles.\"\n\nOver the past 25 years, the volunteers and the aquarium team have helped rescue, rehabilitate and release around 5,000 sea turtles.\n\nKeeping tabs on the turtles\n\nSome of the newly released turtles returned to the ocean with satellite and acoustic tags affixed to their shells for real-time data and long-term tracking, work that's been permitted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe scientists are interested to learn more about the turtles’ behavior, habitat use, and survivorship, which helps inform sea turtle conservation and protection efforts, especially in New England where little is known about these species.\n\nSome of the turtles can be followed on the aquarium’s Sea Turtle Tracker page.\n\nBefore the summer is over, the rehabilitators and researchers hope to release the last of this year's cold-stunned patients. There are seven turtles remaining to complete rehabilitation.\n\nHeather McCarron writes about climate change, environment, energy, science and the natural world.
