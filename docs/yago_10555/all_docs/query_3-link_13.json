        "text": "The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story is a 2014 made-for-television movie, directed by Jason Lapeyre and written by Ron McGee, and produced by Stephen Bulka and based on the 2009 book by Dustin Diamond called Behind the Bell.\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 2009, actor Dustin Diamond wrote Behind the Bell, a scandalous tell-all memoir that purported to reveal what life was like on the set of Saved by the Bell, NBC’s 1987-1993 Saturday morning teen sitcom.\n\nAmong the allegations in the memoir were the claims that everyone in the cast (except for Diamond himself) was sleeping together and many were dabbling in drugs. Diamond later claimed the more sensational aspects of the memoir were fabricated by a ghostwriter. Most of the primary cast (Mario Lopez, Tiffani Thiesen, Elizabeth Berkley, Mark-Paul Gosselaar) have denounced the book (and the film).\n\nBuzzfeed's Jarrett Wieselman reported that \"hours of brand-new interviews [were] conducted for this film (obtained independently of Diamond and his book)\". Lifetime To Air \"The Unauthorized Saved By The Bell Story\"\n\nPlot[]\n\n\"The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story\" delves into the experiences of six unknown young actors placed into the Hollywood spotlight, exposing the challenges of growing up under public scrutiny while trying to maintain the squeaky clean image of their popular characters both on and off-screen.\n\nCast[]\n\nTaylor Russell as Lark Voorhies\n\nSam Kindseth as Dustin Diamond\n\nDylan Everett as Mark-Paul Gosselaar\n\nTiera Skovbye as Elizabeth Berkley\n\nAlyssa Lynch as Tiffani-Amber Thiessen\n\nJulian Works as Mario Lopez\n\nKen Tremblett as Dennis Haskins\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nIt was reported in June 2014 that Front Street Pictures and Ringaling Productions was planning to produce a Saved By The Bell: Behind The Scenes Movie.
