        "text": "On Feb. 16, 2024, Lainey Wilson will release \"Country's Cool Again,\" ahead of her most ambitious year of worldwide marketing and musical push to date.\n\nFrom knowing how to hook a trailer on a two-inch hitch, running her life — like a truck — on a steady diet of dreams and gasoline and guest-starring on \"Yellowstone,\" Grammy-winning 2023 Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year Lainey Wilson has cornered the market on stereotypical bellwethers of country music authenticity.\n\nNow, via her forthcoming new single — alongside an audacious strategy of potentially being seen by every American citizen at least once before the end of February — she's the first to test the notion that her Feb. 16-released anthem advances:\n\n\"Country's Cool Again.\"\n\nThe single fusing Wilson's tastes in Americana, country and Southern rock is available for pre-save/pre-add at laineywilson.lnk.to/countryscoolagain.\n\n\"I'm so excited to announce my brand-new song, 'Country's Cool Again.' This past year has been a wild ride and truly shown me that country music loves me back,\" said Wilson in a press statement.\n\n\"This track is an ode to my upbringing and the story of my journey in this industry – where I have been and where I am now. I'm feeling all the love from Country music fans, and I can't wait to hear everyone singing this song back to me while we're out on the road this year.\"\n\n\"Country's Cool Again\" is co-written by the iconic Heart Wranglers tandem of Trannie Anderson and Dallas Wilson (who previously paired with Wilson on the \"Bell Bottom Country\" track \"Road Runner\") along with Wilson's band leader Aslan Freeman.\n\nAnother frequent Wilson collaborator and Grammy-winning producer, Jay Joyce, also produced the track.\n\nWhether it's online in a new CMT documentary, in a Super Bowl 58 commercial, or onstage at Feb. 18's People's Choice Awards, the six-time country chart-topper currently experiencing crossover top-10 success with her Jelly Roll duet \"Save Me\" is more visible than ever.\n\nFifteen months ago, Wilson noted to the Tennessean that even back then, she felt the \"Hell, yeah, get it, girl\" groundswell of support of country's industry, making it feel as though her success was making her a ubiquitous feature of the genre's mainstream surge.\n\n\"It's all happening. I would've never imagined it would feel like this. I'm striking while the iron is hot and while I have what I think is the entire country music industry's support, and people are genuinely rooting for me.\"\n\n\"I realize that it seems like I'm everywhere right now. Every single show we play gets crazier and crazier these days,\" stated the performer, who is a fifth-generation farmer from Northern Louisiana, about success back then that included multiple No. 1 country radio hits, the equivalent of 2 million singles sold, plus multiple Academy of Country Music, Country Music Association and CMT awards.\n\nNearly a year and a half later, she's eclipsed that standard.\n\n\"I don't know if I'll ever completely wrap my head around this one tonight,\" Wilson added at 2024's Grammy Awards, where she won a golden gramophone for Best Country Album.\n\n\"It feels like blood, sweat and tears have led to this moment right here. I'm so proud to be here and be in the same building with so many people I look up to. I'm on cloud nine, but I feel like this is also just the beginning and that's a very exciting feeling.\"\n\nWilson's popularity spreads globally next month as Wilson starts her year of \"Country's Cool Again\" touring in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nIn a press statement, the Baskin, Louisiana native said, \"I want to give a big thank you to all of the fans who have continuously shown up and showed out this year. We can't wait to see you nationwide on the 'Country's Cool Again' Tour!\"\n\nThe tour's 40 domestic dates start in Music City on May 31 and extend through November. Acts including Ian Munsick, Jackson Dean and Zach Top join Wilson on various dates."
