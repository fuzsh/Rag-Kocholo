Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban co-wrote the screenplay. Brian directed this high gloss, 35 mm test shoot as a precursor to his subsequent hit feature directing job, which finally hit festivals in 2004. Gina proudly line produced the test shoot on behalf of Sandy Stern and Michael Stipe (R.E.M. lead singer) of Single Cell Pictures, and in association with United Artists. Test Shoot principal cast included: Alexis Bledel and Sarah Thompson. The feature was a 2004 hit theatrical release for United Artists, followed by an MGM DVD release in 2005."
