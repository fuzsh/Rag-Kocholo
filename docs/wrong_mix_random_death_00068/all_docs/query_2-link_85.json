        "text": "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was a woman on whom the burdens of modern fame fell to the utmost degree. The coming of television, and the jet age which allowed an unprecedented range of presidential travels, made hers one of the most famous faces of the century. And her husband's assassination in Dallas made her the very symbol of grief and loss. She refused Mrs Lyndon Johnson's suggestion that she change the pink Chanel suit smeared with his blood. 'I want them to see what they've done to Jack,' she said.\n\nThey had been married just 10 years in a union which brought together the energy, the ambition and the new money of the Kennedy family with the old social elite of the Bouviers.\n\nShe learned early to control her private sadnesses. Although her parents divorced when she was 13, her dashing and handsome father 'Black Jack' Bouvier had promised to give her away at her wedding. An alcoholic as well as a rake, he became too drunk - on whisky thoughtfully sent to his room by Jackie's mother - even to attend.\n\nShe had the usual childhood of the privileged elite - learning to ride and hunt - and was educated at Miss Porter's School and Vassar. But by her own talent, she won the Prix de Paris offered by Vogue magazine, with essays on Baudelaire, Oscar Wilde and Serge Diaghilev. She turned down the offer of a job in Paris with Vogue to work as a journalist in Washington. She did well, being sent to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London and young Senator Kennedy cabled her: 'Articles excellent, but you are missed.' On her return from that trip he proposed.\n\nIn her youth she deliberately sought out fame, delighting in being named America's Debutante of the Year in 1947, and wooing the young Senator Kennedy with single-minded determination. She haunted his office, bringing picnic lunches to his desk and offered to help edit his speeches. She even flirted with him in her newspaper column in the Washington Times-Herald, posing the question: 'Can you give any reason why a contented bachelor should ever get married?' She hated politics and campaigning, once telling her sister Lee that she had found the perfect escape by remaining almost constantly pregnant. But she became the first would-be First Lady to invite the TV cameras into her home for a prolonged interview and the first to invade a supermarket, seize the microphone, and announce: 'Please carry on with your shopping, but I want to tell you why you should vote for my husband.' Once installed in the White House she re-decorated it thoroughly, and then escorted the TV cameras throughout, an unheard-of invitation to a public intimacy which is still the most-requested single TV show at the Museum of Broadcasting.\n\nHaving embraced fame, she then flouted it, fighting a series of battles for privacy with her husband's White House press secretary, Pierre Salinger.\n\nAsked once what she would most like to feed her new Alsatian puppy, she bluntly replied: 'Reporters.' The insistence on privacy helped to conceal her heavy smoking habit, and her nervous way of biting her nails. In the formal portrait of her that hangs in the White House, the hands are faked to suggest long and sculpted fingers.\n\nShe was never quite a Kennedy, telling her sister that 'they romp around like a bunch of baboons on the loose'. She disliked their boisterous games, particularly after her brother-in-law, Teddy, broke her ankle during a touch-football game. 'I don't understand it,' the President once noted. 'She breathes all the political gases that flow around us, but she never seems to inhale them.' Until the assassination of her husband, she performed in public precisely as he and American public opinion would have wished in a pre-feminist era. She appeared content to be the ultimate presidential accessory, providing glamour and children and that stylish patina of old money which approximates aristocracy in America. 'I am the man who brought Jackie Kennedy to Paris,' was the President's opening line to a state banquet hosted by General Charles de Gaulle, whom she delighted by speaking in excellent French. 'I'd like to shake her hand first,' said Nikita Khrushchev as he waited to meet the Kennedy couple before their Vienna summit in 1961. At the formal banquet, seated beside the Soviet leader, she interrupted him with the sentence: 'Please don't bore me with statistics.' He laughed, pulled his chair closer, and promised to send her a puppy from the dog the Soviets had just launched into space.\n\nShe was more than just a diplomatic asset to her husband. Without her to play the role of Guinevere, there would have been no Camelot myth, and very little style.\n\nIt was Jackie Kennedy who organised the cultural evenings at the White House, the light banter in French with Andre Malraux before a recital by Pablo Casals. Once a widow, she rebelled. She shunned publicity and the ceremonies of the Kennedy myth. On the 20th anniversary of her husband's death, she refused to attend the memorial service at Arlington cemetery, and instead went for a lonely stroll on the beach at Martha's Vineyard.\n\nAbove all, she married the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, to the bafflement of an America who saw her as the high priestess at a national shrine. One motive seems to have been the need for sufficient wealth to guarantee privacy, for her children as well as herself. He was an old acquaintance of her husband, the man who had introduced young Senator Kennedy to Winston Churchill in the south of France, and who had lent her his yacht after the deep depression which followed the death of her premature baby in 1962.\n\nWarned by a friend that she would 'fall off your pedestal' if she married Onassis, she replied: 'That's better than freezing there.' But she liked Onassis. In a letter she later wrote to Arthur Schlesinger, protesting at his describing President Kennedy as 'Roman', she suggested that she saw in Onassis something of her first husband. 'It almost expresses what I feel about being Greek,' she wrote. 'There is a desperate defiance of fate, which Romans never had. Lyndon Johnson is really the Roman - a classic Emperor - McNamara, maybe even George Washington are Roman - but not Jack.' In the shell which the Onassis money ensured, she avoided interviews and interviewers, and rebuilt her life on her own, litigious terms. She took a persistent photographer to court to stop his ambushes, and fought one bitter legal battle against William Manchester's book Death Of A President and another against the Onassis family to retain the Dollars 26 million bequeathed to her.\n\nAlthough she did not need the salary, she insisted on having a career as a book editor at Doubleday. And although some of her colleagues saw her as a part-timer, she edited two best-sellers, and secured for her company the rights to the Michael Jackson autobiography Moonwalk.\n\nThe most dutiful and complaisant of political wives, she tolerated her husband's constant infidelities which recalled her own father's philandering. Having married the first president young and dashing enough to be a Prince Charming, rather than symbolic father of the nation, she put up with her own role as consort-accessory.\n\nShe brought to the task a flair and a style which made it acceptable to be a cosmopolitan in America, to drink wine and enjoy art, and to impose her Francophile tastes on that ultimate American symbol, the White House.\n\nInsisting on private time to enjoy her horses and her hunting, she was loyal when it most mattered. She refused all pleas to go to the protected bunker during the Cuban missile crisis, and insisted on remaining in the White House with her husband."
