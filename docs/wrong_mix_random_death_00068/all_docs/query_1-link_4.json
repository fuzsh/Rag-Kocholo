        "text": "CANTON, Ohio â Patty Dowd Schmitz spent the past 25 years in communications, working in Chicago. When the opportunity came to return to Canton, her hometown, this March as president and CEO of the National First Ladies Library, she was full steam ahead and excited about a new exhibition honoring the legacy of first lady Jackie Kennedy.\n\nâItâs really brought some great attention to the National First Ladiesâ Library,â said Dowd Schmitz.\n\nâShe was only in the White House for about a thousand days, and then it was her life after the White House that truly made her who she was. She was a pioneer, she was a book editor, she was an intellectual,â said Dowd Schmitz.\n\nTV personality Monte Durham of TLCâs âSay Yes to the Dressâ donated a replica wedding dress and a substantial portion of his personal collection of artifacts to the library.\n\nDurham had been collecting since the mid-70s, and once he learned about an interacted with officials at the library, he said the timing was right.\n\nâItâs time that this goes to a great place, to inspire, motivate and encourage others to look into the history of all First Ladies,â said Durham.\n\nDowd Schmitz said community leaders in Canton have been working for two decades to transform the cityâs image from post-industrial to tourism focused.\n\nShe hopes this new exhibition will touch those visiting from near and far.\n\nâThe First Ladiesâ Library, the First Ladiesâ National Historic Site is definitely a big part of that, and we really want people-this to be on their to do list, when they come here to Canton,â said Dowd Schmitz.\n\nBeyond Camelot, The Life and Legacy of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is open to the public and runs through April 27, 2024."
