        "text": "Cartier (French, est. 1847), Belt/Necklace, circa 1970, silver gilt\n\nAudio Description\n\nThis belt or necklace was manufactured by French jewelry house Cartier, which was established in 1847.\n\nThis belt or necklace is made up of 18 textured, round disks of varying sizes separated by long textured beads. Two textured disks of different sizes form the pendant. Overall, the piece is a darker gold color.\n\nLabel Copy\n\nThis belt or necklace was manufactured by French jewelry house Cartier, which was established in 1847.\n\nCartier is one of the most well-known jewelry houses today and, since its founding in 1847, the brand has been associated with fine jewelry. The firm produced both traditional and modern styles throughout its history. In 1969, Michael Thomas became president of the New York City branch and was instrumental in hiring young designers who modernized the companyâ€™s lines. Aldo Cipullo, Jean Dinh Van, Roger Lucas, Jean Mahie, and Lisa Sotilis all designed for Cartier and examples of their work are included in this exhibition.\n\nProduced in limited multiples, this design can be worn as a belt or necklace. Fashion icon Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis owned an example around 1970. It is vermeil or silver gilt, meaning it is made of silver with a gold layer on the surface. The irregularly-shaped, textured disks are separated by elongated nugget-style beads, but the back is smooth, ensuring a comfortable surface next to the skin."
