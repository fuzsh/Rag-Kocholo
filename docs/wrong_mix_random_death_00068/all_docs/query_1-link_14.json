        "text": "Matt Miller - email\n\nCINCINNATI, OH (FOX 19) - The Rotary Club of Cincinnati in partnership with the Business Courier, Cincinnati Enquirer and the American Institute of Public Service (AIPS) will recognize five individuals in our community who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in their volunteer efforts without expectation of recognition or reward.\n\nThe five nominees are: Don Freed for his work with Ronald McDonald House Charities; Roger Grein for his work with Campus Compact; Michael Moroski for his work with Choices Café; Russell Porter for his work with Medical Volunteers of Cincinnati; and Wendy Steele, founder of Impact 100. One of the nominees will be selected to receive the local Jefferson Award.\n\nThe Jefferson Award, which is recognized as the Nobel Prize for public service, was created in 1972 by Cincinnati's own U.S. Senator Robert Taft and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and is presented annually to recipients in more than 90 cities in the United States. One of the five nominees will be chosen to receive the award and will then be considered for the national Jacqueline Kennedy Award presented to only 5 applicants from the 90 cities represented.\n\nCincinnati Council Member Laure Quinlivan will emcee the annual Jefferson Award presentation that takes place on March 17, at 12:45 p.m., at the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza – Pavilion, 4th Floor.\n\nThe event is open to the public. Lunch is served at 12:00pm at a cost of $20 per person. Reservations are required with payment by Tuesday, March 15 by calling the Rotary office at 421-1080.\n\nCopyright 2011 FOX19.
