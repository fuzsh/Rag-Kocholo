        "text": "(This post was published on our previous blog on 8/18/2014.)\n\nBy Lillianne (Germain) Keaney, Former Graduate Student Intern (Simmons University)\n\nAs a White House Photographs cataloging intern at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, I am lucky to work with an amazing collection of photos on a daily basis. My main internship responsibilities are to research the people, places, and events depicted and to write descriptions of the photos. One of the great advantages of working with such a historic collection is the vast amount of material we have at our disposal for this research. The many resources available at the Library truly bring the photos to life. This is especially the case with my project this summer–I get to spend my days in Mexico with President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy on their state visit in 1962.\n\nThe amount of materials related to this one visit (which lasted just 48 hours!) spans multiple collections of textual materials, audio recordings, and moving images. Though my job is to catalog the photographs from this trip, at the half-way point of this project I am struck with the amount of time I have spent with other materials in our collections, pooling information from the President’s Office Files, National Security Files, and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Personal Papers.\n\nPresident and Mrs. Kennedy traveled to Mexico City in the summer of 1962, but the foundation for the trip started much earlier. As President Kennedy remarked at a ceremony upon his arrival in Mexico, the visit was a tradition that had been practiced by U.S. presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt. “We come as good neighbors and follow in the footsteps of one of my most distinguished predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, who prophesied that the day would ultimately come when Presidents of Mexico and the United States would freely meet and freely communicate upon their common responsibilities and common opportunities.”\n\nListen to audio of the address here.\n\nView drafts and transcript of the speech here.\n\nView motion picture footage from the arrival ceremony and the entire trip here.\n\nAnd so President Kennedy traveled to Mexico after an invitation was extended from the President of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos, in the fall of 1961.\n\nThe photographs from the visit show that the President and First Lady were received with enthusiasm by the Mexican people and by President López Mateos (as we can see from their embrace in this photograph!).\n\nThe warm welcome is especially evident in the images of the motorcade traveling from the airport to the residence of the President of Mexico (Los Pinos). Approximately a million and a half people lined the streets to watch the motorcade, and a blizzard of confetti greeted them as they made their way through the city.\n\nAs with many of the Kennedys’ trips, Mrs. Kennedy stood out as a star. She toured various attractions and facilities important to Mexico City in the 1960s, endearing herself to the people of Mexico.\n\nMrs. Kennedy even delivered a speech in Spanish at a luncheon that she and President Kennedy gave in honor of President López Mateos and First Lady of Mexico, Eva Sámano de López Mateos.\n\nAs these photographs and documents suggest, the trip to Mexico was a great success in strengthening the relationship of Mexico and the United States as “good neighbors.” Throughout the trip, both presidents expressed a desire for a strong friendship between the two nations. In a message sent to President López Mateos upon his departure from Mexico, President Kennedy concluded, “I came to meet a president and statesman, I have left him as a friend. ¡Viva México!”\n\nPresident López Mateos sent this message to President Kennedy in response:"
