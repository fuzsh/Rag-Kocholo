        "text": "ONLINE ORDERING - CLICK HERE!!\n\nE-GIFT CARDS AVAILABLE!!\n\nOrdering Carryout?\n\nWe know parking sucks in the square.\n\nOrder online (link above). Pull up. Give us a call. We’ll run your food out to you. It’s that easy!\n\n513-260-9140 or 513-260-9580\n\nWelcome! Our philosophy is simple: Provide excellent food and beverage in a warm and welcoming environment with exceptional service and people will leave happy. If people leave happy, they will come back.\n\nAt Delwood, we are putting our own spin on the classics. With so many unique flavors coming out of Latin America, we wanted to introduce some of these flavors to Cincinnati. Delwood is a full-service restaurant and bar. Our small kitchen will pump out huge flavor, and the bar will offer craft beer, craft cocktails, and fantastic wine that compliments the many flavors you will experience.\n\nDelwood is located where Delta and Linwood meet in historic Mt. Lookout Square, hence the word Delwood. Delwood is a neighborhood bar and restaurant. We are family and dog-friendly. Patio now open! We're also huge soccer fans! Plan on watching FC Cincinnati and the biggest games from Europe and around the world. And yes, we will eventually open early Saturday and Sunday mornings for the early soccer games!\n\nFAQs\n\nDo you take reservations?\n\nWe do not take reservations (see below for info regarding larger parties and/or private events). But, we do same day call ahead seating. If you are looking to come in for lunch, please call us after 11:00 am on the day you are coming in and we will add you to the list. If you are looking to come in for dinner, please call us after 3:00 pm on the day you are coming in and we will add you to the list. Call ahead seating is NOT a reservation. Expect a small wait. I assure you, we will do everything we can to get you in as quickly as we can!\n\nFYI- If you come in and we are on a wait, we will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. We promise we will do everything we can to get you a table as quickly as we can!\n\nDo you take reservations for larger groups?\n\nYES! We take reservations for parties of 8 or more. We understand that with larger groups, there is a lot of planning and coordination that needs to happen. It's one thing for two people to walk down Delta or Linwood and pop in for a quick bite. It's another thing to get 8 or more people from four different parts of town together for a celebration. Please email us if you would like to make a reservation for your next large get-together. Because of our size, reservations are limited.\n\nCan I rent Delwood?\n\nYES! Our new addition is the perfect spot for your corporate happy hour or private event. Please email us using the Contact tab for availability and pricing.\n\nDo you cater?\n\nYES! Please call the restaurant during normal business hours and ask to speak with Caitlin or shoot us an email using the Contact tab above and we will get back to you ASAP! We ask 24 hours notice for catering orders.\n\nWhere do we park?\n\nIf you're going to be hanging out with us and drinking alcohol, we always recommend Uber or Lyft. If you drive to see us, there is metered parking all over Mt Lookout Square. If you can't find a spot in the square, there is tons of parking just off the square. You can find spots within a block or two. You'll get your steps in for the day!\n\nAre you kid friendly?\n\nAbsolutely! Ask your server or bartender about our kids menu options!\n\nIs your patio dog friendly?\n\nWe love pups!\n\nDo you have TVs? What do you show on the TVs?\n\nWe have multiple TVs in the restaurant, including one on our back patio. We are huge soccer fans, so plan on catching FC Cincinnati and EPL games on the reg. We also love showing the big game, whether it's the Bengals, Reds, or just a big game. No sports on that night? Plan on watching a classic flick."
