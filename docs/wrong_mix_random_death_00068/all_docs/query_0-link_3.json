        "text": "Nominations are still open for the 2024 Jefferson Awards, sometimes called the Nobel Prize for community service.\n\nBut Friday is your last day to nominate someone for the honor.\n\nGreater Cincinnati is one of over 90 communities in the country that present a local Jefferson Award, said Bill Shula of Bethel, who chairs the local awards program administered by the Rotary Club of Cincinnati.\n\nThe deadline to submit a nomination is 5 p.m. Feb. 16. You can find an online form here. The local award program will be on March 21, with emcee Tanya O’Roarke of WCPO Channel 9. The Cincinnati Enquirer partners with The Rotary Club of Cincinnati to present the local awards program.\n\nThe local winner will be a finalist for one of five national awards presented in Washington, D.C. in June by the national service organization Multiplying Good.\n\nNine local awardees have gone on to become national winners.\n\nThe award recognizes volunteers in the community who have created a program that serves an unmet need, or a special volunteer who has provided extraordinary services to an organization.\n\nLast year's award winner, Ron Dumas, is executive director of Reaching Out for Kids, which gives youngsters an opportunity to learn life skills through playing golf.\n\nIn 2022, Roger Grien was recognized in the Jefferson Awards program for his work in founding and sustaining Magnified Giving, which teaches students how to be philanthropists by giving them $1,000 to donate to a local nonprofit.\n\nThe national Jefferson Awards program was founded in 1972 by Cincinnati native Robert Taft and former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Cincinnati was Cincinnati’s first Rotary Club. It is a service and networking organization for business and community leaders and has a mission to provide selfless service in the community and the world."
