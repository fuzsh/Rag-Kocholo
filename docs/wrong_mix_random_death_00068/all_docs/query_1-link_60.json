        "text": "When Jackie O’s started in 2005, beer was brewed and sold only within the four brick walls of our Brewpub. This locally-focused mentality fostered many of the sustainability ideals and commitments that we hold to this day.\n\nBy 2009, as the operation expanded into the building next door, our college town digs were becoming a community hub for locally-sourced food, craft beer, a thriving music and art scene, and, of course, student nightlife.\n\nFurther planting our roots in the region, 2011 saw the advent of our Barrel Ridge Farm: 45 acres of farmland and forest dedicated to preserving the self-reliant agricultural traditions of Southeast Ohio. From seasonal vegetables to whole cone hops, the farm became an advantageous supplier to the restaurant and brewery.\n\nInspired by the vast alumni community throughout Ohio, we decided to extend our borders beyond the brick walls of the basement brewery. In 2013, state-wide production began in a new facility just a mile down the road from our humble beginnings. Community favorites like Mystic Mama and Razz Wheat went into aluminum cans instead of glass bottles– a unique and sustainable choice at the time. We also adopted PakTech packaging handles for those 6-pack offerings, made from second-use HDPE plastics and fully recyclable.\n\nAfter forming a partnership with Cavalier Distributing, demand for Jackie O’s products quickly grew throughout Ohio and Northern Kentucky (Cincinnati area). While we purposefully kept 90-95% of our production within that territory, the high demand still called for rapid growth. In 2016, our newly expanded brewing facility allowed us to comfortably scale production while keeping store shelves stocked with fresh cans. The additional space provided room for a laboratory, administrative offices, sour room, and a 298 panel solar array on the roof, installed by Third Sun Solar. To offset the remaining energy requirement, we purchased Renewable Energy Credits from IGS–something we still do today.\n\nIn 2019, Jackie O’s Bakeshop opened its doors to the community with a new retail focused location. Offering a list of baked goods scratch-made from the brewery’s spent grains and fresh produce from our farm, the new storefront pushed its farm-to-table ethos beyond our own restaurant menu.\n\n2020 marked a revitalized effort to brew and sell beer within our own brick walls, albeit a new set of walls in a new city. After acquiring Elevator Brewing Company’s 4th Street facility in Columbus, Ohio, an ambitious renovation project brought both new challenges and loftier goals along the sustainability path. Working with local architectural and design firms Design Collective and Astra Studios, local construction company Lincoln Construction, commercial landscape architect JKLA, and Third Sun Solar, we kept sustainability at the forefront when planning the new location.\n\nAs construction commenced in Columbus, 2022 became a year of growth and development across all Jackie O’s locations. Our in-house construction, electrical, plumbing, and woodworking teams improved, upgraded, and upcycled their way through many transformative projects. From handbuilt patio furniture to rainwater harvesting to a new Taproom patio, our dedicated team members brought (and continue to bring) the expertise and ability necessary to achieve our goals.\n\nIn the very near future, we expect to see some of our most ambitious sustainability efforts come to fruition. This, of course, includes the opening of our new facility in Columbus with outdoor greenspace and solar array; however, we’re also excited about new, more efficient packaging equipment, a CO2 reclamation system, fully biodegradable/compostable 6-pack holders, and much more. Stay tuned!"
