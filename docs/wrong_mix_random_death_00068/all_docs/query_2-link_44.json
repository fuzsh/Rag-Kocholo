        "text": "Join us as we present the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal, the Municipal Art Society’s highest honor, to four extraordinary New Yorkers. The Medal is given each year to individuals who have made an extraordinary contribution to New York City.\n\nThe Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal was established in 1994 to honor Mrs. Kennedy Onassis, her passionate efforts to preserve great architecture in New York City, and her remarkable partnership with The Municipal Art Society over nearly two decades.\n\nLearn more about the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal →\n\nAbout the municipal art society of new york\n\nFor more than 125 years, the Municipal Art Society of New York (MAS) has worked to educate and inspire New Yorkers to engage in the betterment of our city. As a nonprofit advocacy organization with a high profile and proven track record, MAS mobilizes diverse allies to act on issues that affect New York from sidewalk to skyline. Through planning, policy, and preservation, each of our advocacy initiatives seeks to create a just, livable environment for over 8.5 million New Yorkers. We also strive to provide replicable urban policies and practices for the benefit of other cities throughout the nation and the world.\n\nDue to the efforts of MAS since our founding, iconic landmarks such as Grand Central Terminal, Radio City Music Hall, Jefferson Market Courthouse, and St. Bartholomew’s Church were saved from demolition. Other notable accomplishments have included preserving the Garment District and lights of Times Square and advocating for construction of Rockefeller Center and the Second Avenue Subway. Our advocacy has also led to the creation of the New York Planning Commission, the Public Design Commission, the Landmarks Preservation Commission, as well as the conservation of more than 50 works of public art. MAS was also instrumental in the founding of important civic organization such as the Public Art Fund, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, P.S. 1, the Historic Districts Council, the Park Avenue Armory Conservancy, and the Waterfront Alliance.\n\nLearn more about our history →\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal Honoree David Ehrenberg\n\nDavid Ehrenberg, a native of Brooklyn, is President & CEO of the nonprofit Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, overseeing its diverse tenant base and ongoing expansion efforts. The Yard is a 300-acre industrial campus on the Brooklyn waterfront with a storied history of naval shipbuilding that is now home to over 500 companies and 12,000 jobs. The Yard’s mission is to create high-quality middle-class jobs and ensure that local residents, particularly those facing traditional barriers to employment, benefit from the Yard’s continued development.\n\nPreviously, David was EVP of Real Estate Transaction Services at the New York City Economic Development Corporation where he managed many of the city’s priority economic development projects, including those resulting in Cornell University’s Roosevelt Island campus, Essex Crossing; the Atlantic Yards project; and hundreds of millions of dollars of programs supporting small businesses after Hurricane Sandy. Early in his career, he coordinated a microenterprise program at South Brooklyn Legal Services.\n\nDavid is a graduate of Wesleyan University, was a Fulbright Fellow in Zimbabwe, and received dual masters from the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal Honoree Henry Gutman\n\nHenry “Hank” Gutman currently serves as New York City’s Commissioner of Transportation. Commissioner Gutman is a Retired Partner of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, LLP, where he headed the Intellectual Property Practice Group from 1996 until his recent retirement. During his 40-year legal career, Hank litigated a wide range of high-profile cases, including Lotus v. Borland, which he argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. A 45-year Brooklyn resident, Hank currently serves as Chair of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation working closely with David Ehrenberg to provide thousands of quality manufacturing jobs for those who need them most.\n\nHe also serves on the Board of Brooklyn Bridge Park, helping create a world-class park on what was abandoned waterfront; is a trustee of the Brooklyn Public Library, where he co-chairs the Digital Innovation Committee, and a member of the Board of St. Ann’s Warehouse. He previously served as Vice Chair of the New York League of Conservation Voters, and as a Board member of the National Center for Law and Economic Justice. He is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal Honoree Justin Garrett Moore\n\nJustin Garrett Moore is a transdisciplinary designer and urbanist and is the Inaugural Program Officer for the Humanities in Place program at the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nHis more than fifteen years of public service includes Executive Director of New York City’s Public Design Commission where he foregrounded quality urban design while encouraging sustainability, accessibility, diversity, and equity in the city’s public building, landscapes and art.\n\nPrior to the Design Commission, Justin was Senior Urban Designer for the Department of City Planning for more than a decade where he led complex planning and design projects including the Greenpoint and Williamsburg Waterfront, Hunter’s Point South, and the Brooklyn Cultural District.\n\nJustin holds a Bachelor of Design from the University of Florida and a Master of Architecture, and a Master of Science in Urban Design from Columbia University, where he is now an Adjunct Associate Professor of Architecture. Justin is one of the founding board members of the Black urbanist collective BlackSpace and serves on the boards of ioby.org, and the Youth Design Center. He is also the co-founder of Urban Patch—a social enterprise focused on sustainable design and development projects in the United States and Rwanda.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal Honoree Michael Evans (posthumously awarded)\n\nAs Deputy Director, and then President of the Moynihan Station Development Corporation, from 2011 until his death in 2020, Michael Evans oversaw one of New York City’s most important public works projects in recent memory. The expansion of Penn Station, into the landmark James A. Farley Post Office Building became a symbol of the city’s resilience through a very dark year.\n\nMore than any other individual involved, Michael is credited with shepherding the long delayed, and often derailed, project to create a light-filled new train hall for Amtrak and the Long Island Railroad that will help ensure its legacy as one of New York’s architectural jewels.\n\nPrior to his work with Moynihan Station, Michael was Chief of Staff for Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch and Special Assistant for Infrastructure and Economic Development in the Office of the Governor of New York.\n\nBorn in Cali, Columbia and raised in Dallas, Michael earned a degree in history from the University of Sydney and a master’s degree in International Relations from Oxford University."
