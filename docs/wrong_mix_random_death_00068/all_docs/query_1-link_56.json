Quills garnered the 1995 Kesselring Prize for Best New American Play from the National Arts Club and, for Wright, a 1996 Village Voice Obie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Playwriting. In 2000, Wright wrote the screenplay for the film version of Quills, which starred Geoffrey Rush. Wright’s I Am My Own Wife was produced off-Broadway by Playwrights Horizons in 2003. It transferred to Broadway, where it won the Tony Award for Best Play as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The subject of this one-person play, which starred Jefferson Mays, is the German transvestite Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. In 2006, Wright wrote the book for Grey Gardens. The musical is based on the Maysles brothers’ 1975 film documentary of the same title about Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (“Big Edie”) and her daughter, Edith Bouvier Beale (“Little Edie”), Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s aunt and cousin. He adapted the Disney film The Little Mermaid for the Broadway musical, which opened in 2007. In 2009, he was commissioned by the La Jolla Playhouse to adapt and direct Creditors by August Strindberg. In another La Jolla commission, he wrote the book for the musical Hands on a Hardbody, with the score by Amanda Green and Trey Anastasio. The musical had a brief run on Broadway in March and April 2013 after premiering at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2012. He teamed up with the musician and lyricist from Grey Gardens to write the musical War Paint, which played on Broadway in 2017, and his comedic play Good Night, Oscar premiered at the Goodman in 2021 and on Broadway in 2023. For television, Wright worked on four pilots for producer Norman Lear and teleplays for Hallmark Entertainment and HBO.

Proud member of the Dramatists Guild.\n\nTrey Anastasio is a composer, guitarist, and vocalist that has forged a multi-faceted career, winning acclaim in rock, classical, and theatrical circles over the past three decades. He is a founding member of Phish, one of today’s most successful and innovative rock bands. In the summer of 2017, Phish completed a residency at the world-renowned Madison Square Garden in New York – an unprecedented 13-night run known as The Baker’s Dozen. Phish’s total number of performances at the famed arena currently sits at 64. Anastasio has received Grammy nominations for his recordings with Phish and for his solo work. He has collaborated with such artists as Dave Matthews, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Toots and the Maytals, B.B. King and The Roots, and – as part of the trio Oysterhead – Les Claypool (Primus) and Stewart Copeland (The Police). He co-wrote the music for the Broadway musical Hands on a Hardbody, which received a Tony nomination for Best Original Score in 2013. In the summer of 2015, Anastasio joined the surviving four members of the Grateful Dead for five stadium shows, which celebrated the band’s 50th anniversary and served as their farewell shows. Anastasio has performed his original compositions with numerous symphonies. The New York Times hailed his Carnegie Hall performance with the New York Philharmonic as “that rarest of rarities, a classical-rock hybrid that might please partisans from both constituencies.” In 2014, he debuted a new piece for guitar and orchestra, entitled Petrichor, on a west coast orchestral tour that concluded with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, marking his second performance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In April 2019, Anastasio released his fourteenth solo album, Ghosts of the Forest, which Rolling Stone said was “built around psychedelic guitar liftoffs, ambitious arrangements, and extremely personal lyrics.” Between Me and My Mind, a film documenting Trey’s creative process, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival and played a sold-out limited run engagement in theaters this past summer.\n\nD.
