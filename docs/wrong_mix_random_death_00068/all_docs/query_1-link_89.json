        "text": "Elvis. Oprah Winfrey. Britney Spears. Lady Gaga. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nAll are part of the soup of pop culture that seeps into our daily life through the television we watch, the social media chatter we engage with on our phones or the music we listen to, giving us access to famous people who aren’t quite real.\n\nThe faces of those famous people now appear in artworks in the exhibit “Pop Stars! Popular Culture and Contemporary Art” opening at Louisville's 21c Museum Hotel. The show unpacks many facets of pop culture that provide food for thought. Many pieces also bare gold-leaf with works that reference art history, religion and other dynamics artists have been working in for generations, said Alice Gray Stites, chief curator for the chain of 21c Museum Hotels.\n\nYou may like: 21c to replace art piece after backlash over racial overtones\n\nMore: Maker's Mark brings outdoor exhibit by glass artist Chihuly\n\nStites first organized this show for the 2015 opening of the 21c Museum Hotel in Durham, North Carolina, before she sent it on stints to Cincinnati and Bentonville, Arkansas. Along the way, she has added works to the show, including new ones now in the Louisville exhibit.\n\nWith this opening, the exhibit has more than 90 works of art by 53 artists from 21 countries.\n\nArtists with works in the show include Nick Cave, Frances Goodman, Titus Kaphar, Mickalene Thomas, Fahamu Pecou, Robert Wilson and Kehinde Wiley, whose large sculpture, “Akilah Walker,” is new to the show.\n\nOther new works include two by Kaphar, who comes to speak at the opening of the Louisville exhibit. A Michigan native, Kaphar creates work that considers history and injustice done to African-Americans. In 2014, Time magazine commissioned him to him to create a portrait of Ferguson protesters.\n\nHis “Ascension” hangs high in the 21c Museum gallery, with a stadium crowd in the background. But what is in the foreground is a double image.\n\n“What you see is a silhouetted figure of Michael Jordon jumping into the air and making a basket,” Stites said.\n\nRelated: Pakistani artists, journalists give voice to issues government is reluctant to face\n\nMore: Louisville's cultural impact evident halfway around the globe\n\nInside that silhouette is a reproduction of a snippet of Christ from Rogier van der White’s 1435 painting “The Descent from the Cross.” Surrounding the silhouette are brass nails that appear to be holding the image to the surface.\n\nNearby, Stites has placed Hank Willis Thomas’ digital photograph “And One” with two men jumping toward a hoop, one with a ball and the other looking to make a block. But it’s not basketball hoop. It’s a noose.\n\n“We celebrate the beauty of these black male athletes. We love the winners. But the noose is a reminder that these black bodies also represent past and present day violence,” Stites said.\n\nThen there are portraits by Thomas of Oprah Winfrey and former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the artist creates by making screen-prints and enhancing with hand-applied rhinestones. Their faces are juxtaposed against each other in the artist’s “When Ends Meet.”\n\nWhile both are at different ends of the political spectrum, their faces here – like many photos in the media – have dramatic expressions. The sheer size of the work and the glitter of the rhinestones makes us think about the expectations we have put on all types of women.\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nThen there are the sugary pop icons. There is Britney Spears in R. Luke DuBois’ “Britney” – a mash-up of the singer’s music videos that shows her face. The sound includes her voice, but not the instrumentals. And the recording was made in a church. As it plays, her face changes but her eyes remain locked in place, similar to a religious stature or one a student might study in art history. Stites said DuBois used special facial recognition software also used by the military – the same used to find Saddam Hussein – to make this piece.\n\nMore: Exploring feminist issues in Pakistan through arts\n\nMore: Taking freedom of American media for granted in Pakistan\n\nThen there are those American icons who are famous for being rich and, well, famous. Paris Hilton is one. She’s the subject Louisville artist Jacob Heustis’ work called “Paris Hilton,” which is a drawing of the woman made by etching her likeness in a large mirrored glass.\n\nAlthough most works reference American culture, society and politics, many works provide global perspectives.\n\nBenin artist Leonce Raphael Agbodjélou has an untitled photograph of musclemen that show three men clustered closely in an angelic stance. Stites likened them to the three muses of Greek mythology.\n\nThere’s also Brazilian artist Alexandre Mazza’s video “Se é pra ser amor, que marque a alma!” (“If It's Meant to Be Love, May It Brand the Soul!”), which features a boxer on a large screen, his sweat and deep breathing tangible.\n\nMoroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj has three works in the show, all magnificently colorful that highlight fashion and brands. Each feature portrays subjects outfitted in clothing that he created and tucked in the frames are canned goods. One frame is lined with canned pimentos. Another is outfitted with many tiny cans of Mountain Dew while another has small Pepsi cans.\n\nThe show also includes a first for 21c – a website displayed as art. It’s called “After Dark” by Alexandra Gorczynski. Viewers will be able to see it by a code to sign on to the website. But it also will have the site address available for visitors to sign on at their home computers.\n\nDigital tools, including the internet, give pop culture a kind of turbo power.\n\nYou may like: Listening to Black Sabbath at a bar in Pakistan\n\nYou may like: Kentucky films make it big at Flyover Festival\n\n“There’s less and less demarcation regarding popular culture among different cities around the world and the world has become more like a global village due to the speed of technology,” Stites said.\n\nEven when the show closes at the Louisville location next year and goes on to the 21c Museum Hotel in Oklahoma City, Stites said she’ll likely give the exhibit an update. That will come, in part, because that hotel has the largest exhibition space – 14,000 square feet – but also because the collection could have new acquisitions she would want to add.\n\nReach reporter Elizabeth Kramer at 502-582-4682 and ekramer@courier-journal.com.
