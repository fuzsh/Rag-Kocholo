        "text": "The Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza Hotel and Carew Tower overlooks Fountain Square on the corner of 5th and Vine Streets. Located right in the center of the Central Business District, Fountain Square is among Cincinnati’s most famous landmarks. Even though it was officially founded in 1871, the location was the site where the city’s first inhabitants settled down nearly a century prior. Dozens of local concerts and festivals occur at the square every month, with many congregating around its central landmark, the iconic Tyler Davidson Fountain. Dedicated just months after Fountain Square debuted, this beautiful statue is an homage to Cincinnati’s maritime connection with the Ohio River. Its relief features anecdotes featuring the four primary historical uses of water in the city: steam, waterpower, commerce, and fisheries. The Tyler Davidson Fountain is even listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fountain Square is near a number of other amazing cultural landmarks, including the Taft Theatre, the Aronoff Center for the Arts, the Great American Ballpark, and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Many more are just a short drive away, too, such as the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.\n\nCincinnati itself is a historic city dating back to the late 18th century. Its earliest residents arrived in the area during the late 1780s, founding a rustic military based called Fort Washington. But the first administrator of the nascent outpost—General Arthur St. Clair—quickly renamed it “Cincinnati” after the Society of Cincinnati. This organization was a social fraternity composed of veteran officers who had served with distinction throughout the American Revolution. But the isolated settlement rapidly emerged as one of the nation’s most integral port cities, for it provided a rare access point through the Allegheny Mountains. Steamboats soon became a regular sight in Cincinnati, ferrying all sorts of passengers and cargo along the Ohio River. A prosperous local pork-packing industry developed around the same time, which led to the city earning the name “Porkopolis.” Yet, Cincinnati’s most enduring nickname came about in the mid-1850s, when Americans from across the nation took to calling it “The Queen City.” Cincinnati continues to be an important center of commerce and culture in the heart of the American Midwest, with millions of people traveling to experience its rich heritage every year.\n\nCarew Tower was a novel idea when John J. Emery first introduced it in the summer of 1929. He called for his structure to offer a wealth of services ranging from upscale restaurants to boutique storefronts. To finance his dream, Emery partnered with William A. Starrett of the Starrett Investment Company. Starrett was a renowned builder of skyscrapers, with his most notable work the Empire State Building. Starrett provided Emery with the main source of labor through his construction company, Starrett Brothers, Inc. They, in turn, hired the architectural firm W.W. Ahlschlager & Associates to create the building’s beautiful new design. But Emery also asked that another design company—Delano & Aldrich—assist W.W. Ahlschlager & Associates in the creation of Carew Tower. Together, they developed an engineering masterpiece that displayed some of the finest Art Deco architecture in the entire country. When construction finally started that September, the work site became one of the largest employers in Cincinnati. Yet, the whole endeavor nearly came to a dramatic halt roughly four weeks into construction with the crash of the stock market. Emery had fortunately liquidated his entire portfolio to help fund the project beforehand though, so he was able to maintain a tight schedule. In the end, he and Starrett has spent more than $33 million to create Carew Tower.\n\nAmong the greatest sections of Carew Tower that Emery and Starrett built was a new hotel. The two men had hoped it would rival the Waldorf Astoria in New York with its elegance and luxury. They originally decided on “St. Nicholas Plaza” for its name but were later forced to switch to the more seemingly unconventional “Starrett’s Netherland Plaza” following an injunction by another business. The reason why “Netherland” was used as part of the title was from the belief that the hotel occupied a nether region between the Ohio River and the nearby hills. Eventually, they abbreviated “Starrett’s” to “St.” before dropping it outright. Besides the unique name, the building offered some 800 cutting-edge accommodations that possessed some of the most luxurious bathrooms ever seen inside a hotel. Additional, technologically advanced amenities included high-speed automatic elevators, an internal broadcast system, and an automated parking system in its garage. There were seven magnificent restaurants located onsite, as well: The Frontier Room, Restaurant Continentale, Arcadia Tea Room, Rotisserie Grill, Lunchonette, The Coffee Shop, and the Pavillion Caprice. Located on the 4th floor, Pavillion Caprice also doubled as a nightclub, where celebrities performed under its tiered ceiling. The architects had designed this fantastic room to resemble the SS Leviathan, which was a famous ocean liner active from 1914 to 1934.\n\nThe Netherland Plaza Hotel featured other event spaces that made the destination incredibly special. Guests entered The Palm Court by walking through the lobby, where they encountered a blend of French Art Deco design aesthetics mixed with French Renaissance Revival-style architecture. Railings and posts in The Palm Court featured beautiful engravings of the letter “L,” which paid homage to the majesty of King Louis XV of France. Further inside, the room contained a ziggurat-shaped fountain with a ram’s head and two large sea horses, as well as several murals depicting Cincinnati’s history. The fountain itself was designed by Rockwood Pottery, which also created the floral tiles that reside near the eastern and western entrances into the hotel. The Continental Room up on the Mezzanine level debuted with a small ice-rink and four beautiful murals representing the seasons. The famous Hall of Mirrors was even farther up on the 3rd floor. A gorgeous ballroom constructed with French Fleur de Peche marble, renowned theater-set designer George Unger crafted its structural appearance. He specifically crafted the space to resemble a theater meant to evoke a deeply emotional response. Countless gold-plated mirrors line the walls, leading to a staircase that formed the central stage. Beautiful light sconces of bronze and frosted glass offered a source of indirect light throughout the space, which bounced off a large foliated trim.\n\nMuch of the hotel’s original architectural features were covered up throughout the 1960s, as its owners attempted to modernize it for a contemporary audience. Craftsmen changed most of the beautiful structural components—such as the interior plaster reliefs and the marble floors—by covering them with paint, plywood, and vinyl. Yet, Belvedere Hotels largely undid this work in partnership with Omni Hotels and Resorts some two decades later. They vigorously restored the building’s outstanding Art Deco architecture, removing the intrusive wood and synthetic paneling. Light fixtures were repaired, and stagnant décor was removed. Even the historic murals inside The Palm Court received a much-needed cleansing. Perhaps the greatest change occurred when Belvedere Hotels decided to convert the 800 accommodations down to 624 more comfortable spaces (there are now 561 rooms at the hotel). Subsequent renovations to the hotel have transpired ever since, happening frequently throughout the 2000s.\n\n1929: John J. Emery announced plans to begin constructing a multipurpose commercial property in downtown Cincinnati that he would call “Carew Tower.” His plans involved developing a hotel within the structure that would rival New York’s Waldorf Astoria in luxury. The actual work started a month before the onset of the Great Depression—fortunately, Emery had enough money to see the project through to completion. A large amount of the financing came from William A. Starrett, who provided the main source of labor.\n\n1931: Emery and Starrett debuted Carew Tower and the many brilliant facilities housed inside. The hotel itself quickly became a popular destination in downtown Cincinnati with its seven restaurants and indoor ice-skating rink. It also originally offered 800 amazing accommodations that featured some of the latest amenities for their age, including ultra-modern bathrooms. The Netherland Plaza Hotel even became a hotspot for live entertainment, with countless celebrities performing at the Pavilion Caprice. It opened under the name “St Netherland Plaza,” before being renamed to the “Netherland Plaza Hotel.”\n\n1960: The famous department store, Mabley & Carew, moved out of Carew Tower, having occupied the space for nearly 30 years. Founded in 1887, Mabley & Carew first occupied the building shortly after it opened in 1931. Its departure coincided with a period of decline for the Netherland Plaza Hotel, in which its facilities and architecture were in dire need of renovation.\n\n1983: The Dunfey Hotels Corporation partnered with Belvedere Hotels to manage the Netherland Plaza Hotel. It then moved the hotel into its Classic Hotel Division and started restoring it back to its former glory. Dunfey Hotels then sold its Classic Hotel Division to Aer Lingus, who rebranded it as “Omni Hotels and Resorts.” As such, the Netherland Plaza Hotel became the, “Omni Netherland Plaza.”\n\n1985: The U.S. Department of the Interior declared Carew Tower—and by extension the Omni Netherland Plaza—on the National Register of Historic Places, citing in its report that the building, “is one of the finest examples of skyscraper modernism in America.” Its official report further stated that Carew Tower featured some of the finest Art Deco architecture ever developed in the entire nation.\n\n1989: The Omni Netherland Plaza became a founding member of Historic Hotels of America. It was just one of 35 other historic hotels that met with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to form the organization. The hope was that Historic Hotels of America would serve as a support group for the nation’s historic destinations, regardless of their size or brand status.\n\n1994: The U.S. Department of the Interior bestowed an even greater honor on both the Carew Tower and the Netherland Plaza by naming them a National Historic Landmark. A National Historic Landmark is any building or location listed on the National Register of Historic Places that the government deems to possess outstanding historical significance. Only three percent of the listings on the register possess such a distinction.\n\n2002: The Netherland Plaza joined Hilton Hotel and Resorts through a franchise agreement after having been a member of Omni for many years. It joined several other historic hotels in joining Hilton, such as the Palmer House Hotel and the Seelbach Hotel. The Netherland Plaza then became the “Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza.” Belvedere Hotels continued to manage the daily operations of the business.\n\n2012: Belvedere Hotels initiated an extensive renovation of the hotel that cost nearly $10 million to complete. The construction work was the first in over a decade, in which Belvedere updated its guestroom amenities, high-speed internet service, and fire and safety systems. The Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza also received new luxurious décor and gorgeous window treatments.\n\n2019: The Hilton Netherland Plaza celebrated its 90th anniversary. It also marked 30 years of continuous membership in Historic Hotels of America. The future had never looked brighter for this historic hotel."
