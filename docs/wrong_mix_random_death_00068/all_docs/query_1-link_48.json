        "text": "Two of the biggest local names students see on Court Street are Jackie O’s Pub and Brewery and Bagel Street Deli. Little do most know that the same man helps run both of them. On January 21st, I talked with the owner and creator of Athens most unique bar, stationed on Union Street across from Buffalo Wild Wings. The man prides himself on delivering local beers and products to the students of Ohio University and the locals of Athens. And it’s worked, as evident in Jackie O’s most recent edition to their brewery, which sits next door to the pub. On top of running Jackie O’s, along with helping out with business at Bagel Street Deli, Art also teaches in Linguistics at Ohio University. He is certainly a man of many crafts, and many beers. Interviewing Art is essential for my blog because nothing symbolizes localized Athens business like a microbrewery owned by a man who strikes to be local. Here’s the conversation:\n\nWill Frasure: You guys have an incredibly local feel to your bar. What’s your strategy to appeal to the people of Athens with your bar?\n\nArt Oestrike: It’s pretty simple. We just try to make it an environment where everyone is welcome, you know? Pub style, welcoming facility with a number of different options for our patrons. We just want everyone to feel like they are welcome, whether it’s locals or the students on campus here.\n\nWF: You guys are popular for your choice of microbrews compared to the other bars here in Athens. How many different ones do you have? What’s the most popular out of all of them?\n\nAO: Up until we expanded the brewery in the last year, it was always be between six and eight, but I think we’ll be up to around 15 or so between the two rooms we have for our patrons. It’s was a big increase and it’s having a big effect on getting more people in here, in my opinion.\n\nThe Rasp(berry) Wheat is the most popular, definitely. It’s just a nice blend of raspberry and wheat. Everyone loves a good wheat beer, and the raspberry taste gives it a little extra flavor.\n\nWF: With Athens being such college town, how do you appeal to that demographic of students while also getting local residents to come to your bar?\n\nA: Number one is that I try to work with every single student organization that comes through our door, be it through allowing to advertise them through events, donations, involvements, gift certificates for food. I kinda just want to work with as much of the student population as possible. I employ a number of students, which is also a very, very helpful thing. For locals, I’ll try to give us exposure in a number of different things, whether it’s the Farmer’s Market in the summers by selling our bread. We sell some of our bread at Fluff. We try to get our beers on tap at different places like Casa and more to come. We offer specials that will attract people on a student’s budget.\n\nWF: You mentioned how you are trying to get exposure through events. This weekend, you guys are having a beer-tasting event. What are you expecting out of it? How long have you done it?\n\nAO: We expect a rather raucous group of fathers and their children here in our bar. This will be our third or fourth year doing the beer tasting with Impower. We’ll have it Mom’s Weekend, Dad’s Weekend, during Brew Week.\n\nWe usually sell out Mom’s and Dad’s weekend very easily. Brew Week, it just depends what else is going on. During that week, we have 38 of our own beers on tap, so we have a lot to show off that week. It just depends on the mood of the locals, the number of students here, stuff like that.\n\nWF: I had some of your guys’ beer during Brew Week, but have never gotten a chance to actually eat at Jackie O’s? How does that add to the local feel?\n\nAO: Like the beers, we want to have a different, local taste with our food. I really think the item that stands out the most is the pizza. We get all of the ingredients from places around here, and actually use the wheat we use in our brews for the dough. The tomatoes are local, giving it a different taste than what you’ll get from your everyday places. It just ties into what we want to do. Honestly, there’s nothing more local than having one of our beers with one of the many things we have on our menu.\n\nWF: With you guys striving to be local, how important is it for you to have that Athens feel, that local feel about your bar ever since you started at the bar?\n\nAO: That is one of our core values. It can’t really get as important as that, you know? That is paramount. Our new slogan, which will be up sometime in the next week or so, let me get it here. Here it is: “Your food, your beer, your people.” That’s paramount, man. There’s so many people that live in Athens that aren’t students, and they’re here 52 weeks a year, not 30. They’re always supporting the local economy, their markets, their products. So supporting them and what they make and their initiatives is huge for us.\n\nWF: What do you have to say about the people that maybe go to corporate places instead of local places?\n\nAO: I don’t really understand why you wouldn’t go local, especially in a small town like Athens. Why would you do something like that? I don’t understand why places like Wal-Mart is the number one company on the planet. I really think it’s preposterous. They aren’t buying anything from the people from around here, why would you support that? What the hell do they buy from people around here? I don’t know, man. I just think it’s preposterous and I feel like, at least with this bar and our products, we can go against the grain and support the people here, unlike all the big companies that come here."
