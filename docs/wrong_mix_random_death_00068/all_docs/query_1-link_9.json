        "text": "Reverend Wendell Mettey grew up in the inner-city of Cincinnati, OH. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Cincinnati, Wendell spent several years as a social worker for Hamilton County, Ohio. He then felt called to be a pastor and enrolled at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he obtained a master’s degree in divinity. Reverend Mettey has served as Pastor for several churches in the Cincinnati area.\n\nIn 1990, Reverend Mettey visited war-torn Nicaragua with a group of medical professionals from his church. Despite his extensive experience with the poor in his hometown, he was shocked to see the devastation and extreme poverty in Nicaragua. He felt led by God to leave his pastorate and start Matthew 25: Ministries in 1991. Under Reverend Mettey’s tremendous leadership, the ministry has grown from a small suitcase ministry to an international humanitarian and disaster relief organization helping more than 20 million people each year.\n\nIn June of 2003, Wendell received the Jefferson Award for Outstanding Public Service from the American Institute for Public Service. Wendell was one of only 5 regional recipients chosen from 14,000 nominees nationwide to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Outstanding Public Service Benefiting the Local Community. He has been included multiple times in Cincy Magazine’s “Power 100”, which is a list of the most influential leaders in the Tri-State. In 2014, Reverend Mettey received the International Bridge Award from the NuWay Foundation, which honors local philanthropists and citizens who make a difference in the world. And in 2015, he received the Distinguished Humanitarian Award from World Assist. His tremendous work with the poor has also been featured on several news broadcasts and interviews.\n\nReverend Mettey is the author of numerous devotional & inspirational publications. For more information about these works, please visit The Works of Rev. Mettey.\n\nWendell and his wife Mickey (Michelle) reside in Cincinnati, Ohio. They are the proud parents of three children: Tim, Aaron and Clare, and are the proud grandparents of Ethan, Cora, Noel, Aubriana, Sidney, Ashlyn, Eden, Livia, Graham, and Jensen."
