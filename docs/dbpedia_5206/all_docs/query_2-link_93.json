The monks remained in the Monastery until 1835.\n\nMonasterio de Piedra: Natural Park\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century the medieval monastery and the vegetable garden were bought by Pablo Muntadas. The buildings of the monastery were adapted as a first class hotel to provide all services. The vegetable garden was transformed into a space with an exceptional landscape where people can also walk and enjoy the impressive waterfalls, lakes, caves and nature.

San Pablo’s Church is situated between San Pablo and San Blas streets, in the traditional San Pablo neighborhood, also known as “El Gancho” in the historical center. Not far of this church are the Roman Walls, Central Market and Pilar Square, the main tourist area of the city. It is worth mentioning that San Pablo’s Church together with La Seo, Aljaferia Palace and several other buildings form part of the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragón which was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in December 2001 as the most representative Mudéjar Architecture of Aragón.\n\nBuilt on the site where another temple stood previously, San Pablo’s Church was built with bricks in Mudéjar style between the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The first construction had a rectangular nave and the bell tower. Afte that, two lateral naves were added to the first nave at the end the 14th century. Moreover, it was several times remodeled and renovated between the 16th and 18th centuries and restored in the late 20th century.\n\nA visit inside the church enables us to see a whole set of artworks, as well as its impressive high altar in polychromed wood by Damian Forment dating from 1515 (Gothic Renaissance), a jewel of art in Aragón.
