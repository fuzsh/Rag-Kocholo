        "text": "Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down rules for direct payments to farmers under the aid schemes provided for in this Regulation the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 637/2008 and (EC) No 73/2009 establishing a new system of decoupled direct payments from production based on the basic payment scheme. Title V of the Regulation develops the scheme for small farmers, which is optional for the Member States and seeks to establish a simplified scheme for producers who receive less than a certain amount. quantity.\n\nThe perception of all of these aids is conditional on the farmer applying for them to meet the criterion of an active farmer, which is therefore a key entry for the new aid system, and whose compliance is intended to prevent natural or legal persons without any agricultural activity from being eligible for aid, as the European Court of Auditors has reported in a number of reports.\n\nThis royal decree should be supplemented by Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments for rural development, in which the direct payments which may be requested in each marketing year are regulated, including the definitions of active and agricultural farmers, as well as the characteristics of the application for the annual aid for the Basic Payment Scheme, for the payment of the practices The Commission also took the view that, in the light of the Commission's proposals, the Commission has been in a position to take account of the fact that the Commission has been in a position to make a decision on the the specific payment to cotton.\n\nIn order to ensure a better distribution of aid between agricultural land, a new basic payment scheme should replace the single payment scheme set up under Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 March 2004. September 2003 laying down common rules for direct aid schemes in the framework of the common agricultural policy and establishing certain aid schemes for farmers and amending the Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 235/1999 and (EC) No 2529/2001, and maintained by Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, which combined previously existing aid mechanisms into a single direct payment scheme disassociated. This initiative should, in principle, put an end to the payment entitlements obtained under those Regulations and should involve the allocation of new ones. This allocation of new payment entitlements shall be based, as a general rule, on the number of eligible hectares available to farmers in 2015, the first year of application of the scheme.\n\nIn Spain, a uniform model for the application of the common agricultural policy will be established throughout the national territory based on the state's competence to establish the general planning of economic activity, in this case in the agricultural sector. The basic payment scheme will therefore be implemented on the basis of a national regionalisation model. In addition, in order to avoid excessive fragmentation of the territory and to facilitate the understanding of the regions to be established by the beneficiaries, the model should provide for a limited number of regions.\n\nIn the process of defining the regions created for the management of the basic payment scheme, the four basic criteria referred to in Article 23.1 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013, as they are the administrative criterion, on the basis of which the agricultural region is used as a basic unit to establish regionalisation; in turn, the agricultural districts, taking into account the agronomic criterion, divide according to the production guidelines presented in the 2013 reference campaign. These productive orientations are the land of cultivation, permanent cultivation and permanent pasture; in the case of the cultivated lands, and because of their impact in Spain, they have been subdivided into lands of secano cultivation and farmland of regadio. In addition, the regional agricultural potential is used, based on the yields and productive capacity of the agricultural districts in the 2013 campaign. Finally, the socio-economic criterion is also taken into account in order to weigh the importance of certain crops and crops in some agricultural areas.\n\nIn summary, based on these three criteria, the regions are established by grouping together the different regional production guidelines, following as a criterion of grouping a similar regional agricultural potential.\n\nFor the calculation of the initial unit value, the level of payments received in the 2014 marketing year shall be taken as a reference, before reductions and exclusions, corresponding to the aid schemes paid in that marketing year and whose amounts are kept uncoupled or are partially or fully decoupled from 2015. These amounts are those for the single payment scheme, as decoupled payment and a certain percentage of the payments received in respect of the suckler cow premium and the supplementary premium to the suckler cow, the payments received by the the national programme for the promotion of crop rotations on dry land, payments received on the basis of the national programme for the promotion of the quality of tobacco and payments received on the basis of the national programme for the promotion of tobacco of the quality of the cotton, as payments that go uncoupled in the new period.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach of the initial unit values towards the regional average value is to be done progressively, in order to avoid major impacts at the individual, sectoral and territorial levels. To do this, farmers who have direct payments below the average in their region will partially and progressively settle this gap until the 2019 campaign. Moreover, in order to avoid unit values of rights that are far from their regional average, and to achieve the ultimate objective of the convergence of aid towards that value, payment entitlements in 2019 will not be of less than a certain value. percentage of the average of the region concerned. Farmers with rights of high unit value should finance this convergence, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, by reducing the value of payment entitlements which in 2019 have a higher value than the value of the average, although in order to avoid disproportionate losses for some farmers, a ceiling should be set for such reductions.\n\nIn order to avoid the situation that an increase in the eligible area would disproportionately limit the amount of direct payments per hectare and thus affect the internal convergence process, when the first allocation of payment entitlements, certain limitations may be applied for the purpose of establishing the number of payment entitlements. In particular, an individual limitation of the area will be established, so that as many basic payment entitlements are allocated as the smallest number of hectares resulting from the comparison of the total eligible hectares declared in the single application. 2013 and the total of the eligible hectares declared in the single application 2015.\n\nExperience with the implementation of the single payment scheme has shown that some of its main elements need to be maintained, including the setting of national ceilings to ensure that the level of the Total aid does not go beyond the existing budgetary constraints. In addition, experience has also shown that the total amount of funds available under the established national ceilings was not used. While the scheme to be put into effect reduces the risk of unspent funds remaining, it is nevertheless necessary to establish the possibility of distributing payment entitlements for a value higher than the amount available for the basic payment scheme, in order to facilitate a more efficient use of funds. Therefore, while respecting the net ceilings for direct payments, the allocation of direct payments may be increased to optimise the use of available funds.\n\nOn the other hand, and as the European legislation sets out, a national reserve will be set up. This national reserve should be used, as a matter of priority, to facilitate the participation of young farmers and other farmers starting their agricultural activity in the scheme and should also be used to address other situations. specific.\n\nThe rules governing the transfers of basic payment entitlements in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 should also be laid down, having been deemed necessary. transcribe some articles of the regulation, in the interests of better understanding of the text.\n\nIn order to help preserve the part-time agriculture that is so important in certain rural areas of Spain and in the interests of simplification, the scheme for small farmers will be implemented in Spain. This will apply ex officio to all recipients to whom it is appropriate to receive less than € 1,250 of direct aid, with the possibility that they may opt for non-participation if they so request. This amount will be calculated as a payment based on the amount payable in 2015 to farmers. However, the amount of beneficiaries included in this scheme will not be subject to the internal convergence process.\n\nFurthermore, for the participants of this scheme, simplification rules should be introduced for the formalities by reducing, among other things, the obligations imposed on them as regards the procedure in order to present the aid application, compliance with the agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment or the control of cross-compliance, without jeopardising the achievement of the overall objectives of the reform. The aim of this scheme should be to support the structure of small agricultural holdings in Spain, but without taking into account the development of more competitive structures.\n\nArticle 58 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 provides that all laws, regulations and administrative provisions and any other measures should be adopted. necessary to ensure effective protection of the financial interests of the Union, with the aim, inter alia, of ensuring effective prevention of fraud, in particular as regards areas with a high level of risk. Those measures must have a deterrent effect, taking into account the costs and benefits and the proportionality of the measures. Therefore, when it is demonstrated that a beneficiary has artificially created the conditions for the allocation of basic payment entitlements, no basic payment entitlements will be allocated to it or this allocation will be limited.\n\nIn the elaboration of this standard, the autonomous communities and representative entities of the sectors concerned have been consulted.\n\nIn its virtue, on the proposal of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, with the prior approval of the Minister of Finance and Public Administrations, according to the State Council and prior deliberation of the Council of Ministers at its meeting on 19 December 2014,\n\nDISPONGO:\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nGeneral provisions\n\nArticle 1. Object and scope of application.\n\n1. This royal decree is intended to lay down the basic rules governing the allocation of rights to the basic payment scheme laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the laying down rules for direct payments to farmers under the aid schemes covered by the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 637/2008 and (EC) No 73/2009 Tip.\n\n2. It shall apply in order to establish the allocation of the basic payment entitlements for the period of application 2015-2020 which are granted under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013.\n\n3. On the other hand, the application of a simplified scheme for small farmers based on an independent system of rights in the case of holdings whose direct payments in the 2015 marketing year does not exceed € 1,250 is established.\n\n4. This royal decree will apply throughout the national territory, except in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands where its specific programs will be applied.\n\nArticle 2. Definitions.\n\nFor the purposes of this royal decree, the provisions of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock farming and other schemes will be applicable. aid, as well as the management and control of direct payments and payments for rural development, and Regulation (EC) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013.\n\nArticle 3. Beneficiaries and requirements.\n\n1. Basic payment entitlements may be granted on two routes:\n\n(a) By virtue of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013, active farmers who obtain basic payment entitlements derived from the first allocation, in accordance with the provided for in Article 10.\n\n(b) By virtue of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013, active farmers obtaining basic payment entitlements shall:\n\n1. The allocation of the national reserve as regulated in Article 23.\n\n2. º By disposals, regulated in Article 28.\n\n2. The farmers referred to in paragraph 1, in order to be able to collect the amounts corresponding to their rights, shall comply with the requirements laid down in Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 of the direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments for rural development, in particular as regards the definition and requirements of farmers active and agricultural activity, the declaration of eligible hectares to justify the payment entitlements of the is the holder as well as the other conditions laid down in Article 13 of that rule.\n\nArticle 4. Types of rights.\n\nBasic payment entitlements are classified based on their source:\n\n(a) Rights arising from the initial allocation: those that are allocated to farmers in accordance with Article 10.\n\n(b) Rights deriving from the national reserve: those who are assigned to farmers applying for the rights of the national reserve in accordance with the provisions of Article 24.\n\nArticle 5. System for the identification and registration of payment entitlements.\n\n1. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, repealing Regulations (EC) No 352/78, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008, established in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment, a system for the identification of national aid entitlements which will have a register electronic in which the following elements shall be included, at least:\n\n(a) The holder or rightholders with an indication of their NIF.\n\nb) The value of the rights, including the unit amount from 2015 to 2019.\n\nc) The date of the constitution of each right.\n\nd) The date of the last use of the rights.\n\ne) The origin of the right: initial allocation and national reserve.\n\nf) The year of entitlement allocation.\n\ng) The indication of whether the right is temporarily leased to another holder.\n\nh) The percentage of entitlement participation.\n\ni) The region to which the right belongs.\n\n2. This system should make it possible to verify the rights and to carry out cross-checks with the aid applications and the identification system for the agricultural parcels, as well as to consult the relevant data, covering at least the five previous consecutive calendar years.\n\n3. The basic payment entitlements management database, established and maintained with the data to be provided by the Autonomous Communities, shall be available for each of them in such a way as to enable them to carry out the annual management of the basic payment.\n\nArticle 6. Establishment of the regionalisation model for the basic payment scheme.\n\n1. The basic payment scheme is regionalised as provided for in Article 23.1 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 following a national implementation model based on established regions on the basis of administrative, agronomic, socio-economic and regional agricultural potential criteria. The basic unit for establishing regionalization will be the agricultural districts, which will be grouped in different regions according to the productive orientation of the different types of agricultural area of each region, of the potential the production of certain products in the year 2013 and the socio-economic impact of certain productions in agricultural areas.\n\n2. The agricultural districts of the regionalisation plan to be used to establish the regions of the basic payment scheme and the municipalities which are included in each case are set out in Annex I.\n\nArticle 7. Territorial base of the regions.\n\n1. The territorial base of the regions is established on the basis of the productive potential they present as well as the productive orientation determined in the 2013 campaign for the areas declared in that campaign or the use reflected in the geographical identification of agricultural parcels (SIGPAC) in 2013 for areas not declared in that marketing year. This territorial basis shall be fixed, before 1 March 2015, in a reference layer on the SIPPAC, a layer to be considered as definitive after the end of the process of allocation of basic payment entitlements in the year 2015.\n\n2. The territorial definition of the regions is determined in Annex II.\n\nArticle 8. National ceiling for the basic payment scheme.\n\n1. The annual national ceiling for the basic payment scheme shall be determined after deduction from the national ceiling, which includes the total value of direct payments which may be granted in Spain, as set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the annual maximum amounts fixed for payment for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment, the supplementary payment for young farmers and the associated aid regulated in Title IV of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 onwards of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other support schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development.\n\n2. These quantities may be reviewed annually on the basis of the needs to be submitted for the financing of the additional support for young farmers set out in Chapter III of Title III of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014. December, on the implementation from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development, so that the value of all payment entitlements shall be increased or reduced in a linear manner taking into account this circumstance.\n\n3. In accordance with Article 22.2 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013, the ceiling for the basic payment scheme calculated as set out above shall be increased annually by a 3% to make better use of available funds. Once this increase has been made, for each campaign the national ceiling for the basic payment will be determined in Annex II to Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the implementation from 2015 of direct payments to the agriculture and livestock farming and other support schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development.\n\nArticle 9. Regional allocation of the maximum limit of the basic payment scheme.\n\n1. The amounts available for the basic payment scheme in the year 2015, as referred to in Article 8, shall be distributed on the basis of the regions set out in Article 7 on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, such as their agronomic and socio-economic characteristics, their regional agricultural potential or their institutional or administrative structure, once the linear reduction for the national reserve set out in Article 23 has been applied.\n\n2. The final amount available for each of the regions will be set on the basis of the applications submitted in the 2015 campaign and will be the maximum limit for each of the regions by 2015.\n\n3. The regional ceilings for the years 2016 to 2020 shall reflect the evolution of the national ceiling for the basic payment scheme. To this end, the regional ceilings for each marketing year shall be calculated by applying a fixed percentage to the national ceiling set for this aid in Article 8.\n\nThis fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the respective regional ceiling for 2015 by the national ceiling set for the basic payment scheme in Annex II to Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014. on the implementation from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development, after the linear reduction is applied for the national reserve set out in Article 23.\n\n4. The total value of the basic payment entitlements in each of the regions shall respect each of the regional limits established.\n\n5. The final regional average values, from 2015 to 2020, which will characterise each region, will be determined after the end of the reporting period for direct payments for the 2015 marketing year.\n\nIn addition, based on the requests for the allocation of rights submitted in the 2015 campaign and taking into account the number of basic payment entitlements to be allocated as set out in Article 12 of this royal decree, establish the maximum number of basic payment entitlements that can be allocated in each region, irrespective of the rights to be allocated via a national reserve.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRights allocation\n\nArticle 10. First assignment of basic payment entitlements.\n\n1. Basic payment entitlements shall be allocated in 2015 to active farmers who are entitled to receive direct payments in accordance with Articles 8, 9 and 10 of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the implementation from 2015 of the direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other support schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development, provided that:\n\n(a) Request the allocation of payment entitlements under the basic payment scheme at the latest by the final date of submission of the single application for 2015, except in case of force majeure or exceptional circumstances such as and as defined in Article 17, and\n\n(b) Hayan entitled to receive payments, before any reduction or exclusion in respect of an application for direct payment support in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in 2013, or\n\n(c) Have the right to receive basic payment entitlements in accordance with Articles 18 and 19 of this royal decree.\n\n2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, all purchases or leases of single payment entitlements with land, as well as the finalisation of land leases with sale or grant of the rights to the lessor, communicated to the competent authority from 17 February 2014 to 15 May 2014, in accordance with Article 29 of Royal Decree 1680/2009 of 13 November 2014 on the application of the single payment scheme for agriculture and the The integration of certain agricultural aid into it from the year 2010 onwards, together with the payment entitlements Single and hectare, compliance with the requirement set out in paragraph 1 (b).\n\nAny transfer of a single payment entitlements without land associated with a complete and final transfer of a livestock holding as long as the hectares associated with the holding are not eligible shall be treated as could include in the assignment of rights as these are not the property of the transferor.\n\nSimilarly, the first paragraph of this paragraph shall be treated as the only payment entitlements in 2014 in which the transferor of the rights had a livestock holding with a communal pasture concession in 2013. the end of 2014, while the transferee of these rights would have, in 2014, a new concession of communal pastures for their livestock holding for at least the same number of hectares as those that would have ceased to be received from the entity The farmer's community pasture the ceding. In such cases, the transfer of the single payment entitlements without land between transferor and transferee shall be treated as, for the purposes of the allocation of basic payment entitlements in 2015, a transfer of single payment entitlements with land.\n\n3. In the same way, changes in ownership of a holding, which are dealt with as transfers of single payment entitlements in the 2014 marketing year, on the occasion of inheritances, retirements in which the transferee of the rights is a first-degree family member of the (a) the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2013/2006, provide for the implementation of the measures referred to in Article 1 (2) of the Treaty on the European Union. (i) the Commission's application to the Council of the European Parliament and of the Council requirement set out in paragraph 1 (b).\n\n4. The transmission of the right resulting from the recovery of some form of direct aid in 2013, referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, shall be carried out on its own initiative by the competent authority in such a way as to ensure that the transferee of the single payment payment 2014, it shall not have to justify complete compliance with the requirement of paragraph 1 (b) with respect to its application for the allocation of basic payment entitlements in 2015.\n\n5. Where it is established that a beneficiary has artificially created the conditions for the allocation of rights, no basic payment entitlements shall be allocated to it or this allocation shall be limited, in accordance with Article 22 of this Royal decree.\n\n6. Basic payment entitlements shall not be allocated to holdings where, after the checks have been carried out, the existence of less than 0,2 eligible hectares has been determined.\n\nArticle 11. Application for admission to the basic payment scheme.\n\n1. In order to be eligible for the allocation of basic payment entitlements on the basis of Article 10, farmers shall apply for admission to the basic payment scheme in the first year of application of the basic payment scheme.\n\n2. Farmers shall apply for admission to the basic payment scheme at the same time as they apply for the recovery of the basic payment scheme by the single 2015 application as set out in Article 91 of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 for direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other support schemes, as well as for the management and control of direct payments and payments for rural development.\n\n3. The application for admission to the basic payment scheme shall be submitted on the dates and places established for the submission of the single application for 2015.\n\n4. Except for reasons of force majeure or exceptional circumstances referred to in Article 17, no payment entitlements shall be granted if admission to the basic payment scheme is not sought.\n\nArticle 12. Number of basic payment entitlements to allocate.\n\n1. Basic payment entitlements shall be expressed in a figure corresponding to a number of eligible hectares. Accordingly, the number of payment entitlements allocated shall be equal to the number of eligible hectares determined by the farmer in his application for aid 2015 or to the number of eligible hectares declared in accordance with the Article 34.2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 30 November 2009 in 2013 in its application for aid if this figure was lower, in application of the individual limit of areas set out in Article 24 (4) of Regulation (EU) No 73/2009. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013.\n\n2. In the event that an individual limitation should be applied to areas declared in 2015, a percentage reduction shall be applied for the entire eligible area declared in 2015. This percentage shall be calculated as the ratio between the number of eligible hectares determined in accordance with Article 34.2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 30 November 2009, declared in the application for aid 2013 and the number of Eligible hectares as declared in the aid application 2015.\n\n3. Those farmers who declare on their single application 2015 permanent pasture land and do not appear on the date of completion of the submission of the single application 2015 in the Register of Livestock Holdings (REGA) shall not be allocated basic payment entitlements on those grasses areas on the basis of Article 8 of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as follows: as to the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development.\n\n4. For the purposes of paragraph 1, all the cases referred to in Article 10 (2) and (3) and in Article 19 (1) (d) and (e) shall be understood to entail the transfer of all the hectares from the transferor to the transferee. eligible for transfer and declared in the single application for 2013 in accordance with Article 34.2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 30 November 2009.\n\n5. Any definitive or partial or final transfer of a holding communicated to the competent authority in accordance with Article 19, in which the value of the relevant holding is transferred together with the holding basic payment entitlements to be allocated in 2015 shall entail the transfer of the transferor to the transferee, the number of eligible hectares declared in the single application for 2013 under Article 34.2 of Regulation (EC) 73/2009 corresponding to the part of the holding that is transferred.\n\n6. Any final transfer or lease of a holding or part thereof where there is no agreement to transfer the value of the corresponding basic payment entitlements to be allocated in 2015 on that holding shall not entail any the disposal of the eligible hectares identified in the single application for 2013 in accordance with Article 34.2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 30 November 2009, including the transfer of the transferor to the transferee; Article 21 can be applied in such cases.\n\nArticle 13. Setting the initial value of basic payment entitlements.\n\n1. The initial unit value of the basic payment entitlements shall be fixed on the basis of the aid schemes set out in Royal Decree 202/2012 of 23 January 2012 on the application from 2012 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock farming, and financed by EAGF funds, which will remain as decoupled payments or will become fully or partially, received in the 2014 campaign.\n\n2. For the purpose of determining direct payments relating to 2014 which shall be taken into account in the calculation of the initial unit value of the basic payment entitlements only the payments of those active farmers entitled to the basic payment entitlements shall be taken into account. receive direct payments in accordance with Articles 8, 9 and 10 of Royal Decree 1075/2014 of 19 December 2014 on the application from 2015 of direct payments to agriculture and livestock and other aid schemes, as well as on the management and control of direct payments and payments to rural development.\n\n3. The amounts, before reductions and exclusions, which shall be computed for the calculation of the initial value of the basic payment entitlements shall be:\n\n(a) The amounts corresponding to the single payment scheme, Title II of Royal Decree 202/2012, of 23 January.\n\n(b) 51,32% of the amounts corresponding to the suckler cow premium, Title IV of Royal Decree 202/2012 of 23 January.\n\n(c) 51,32% of the amounts, managed with Community funds, corresponding to the supplementary premium to the suckler cow, Title IV of Royal Decree 202/2012, of 23 January.\n\n(d) The amounts corresponding to the national programme for the promotion of crop rotations on dry land, Section 1, Chapter I of Title V of Royal Decree 202/2012, of 23 January.\n\ne) The amounts corresponding to the national programme for the promotion of the quality of tobacco, Section 4, Chapter I of Title V of Royal Decree 202/2012, of 23 January.\n\n(f) The amounts corresponding to the national programme for the promotion of the quality of cotton, Section 5, Chapter I of Title V of Royal Decree 202/2012, of 23 January.\n\nArticle 14. Calculation of the initial value of the basic payment entitlements.\n\n1. The calculation of the total initial value of the basic payment entitlements for each farmer shall be made by applying a fixed percentage to the amounts that the farmer received in 2014, calculated before reductions and exclusions, corresponding to the aid schemes referred to in the previous Article.\n\nThe fixed percentage indicated above shall be the result of dividing the national ceiling of the basic payment scheme, after the linear reduction provided for in Article 23, by the total amount of the payments carried out at national level in 2014, before reductions and exclusions, corresponding to the aid schemes that are to be taken into account for the basic payment scheme.\n\n2. The calculation of the initial unit value of each of the basic payment entitlements to be allocated to a farmer in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve, shall be carried out:\n\n(a) In the case where the farmer declares area in a single region, by dividing the corresponding total initial value by the total number of basic payment entitlements he has allocated in that region, excluding those allocated from the national reserve.\n\n(b) In the case where the farmer declares area in more than one region, a portion of the total payments received by the farmer in 2014 shall be allocated in each region. To this end, a distribution shall be made, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, of the amounts collected in 2014 between the area declared by each producer in each region. Thereafter, the initial unit value of each basic payment entitlement in each region shall be calculated by dividing the amounts allocated in that region by the number of basic payment entitlements allocated in that region, excluding those allocated from of the national reserve.\n\nIn this distribution process, in order to ensure its uniform application throughout the territory, when it is detected that artificial conditions have been created, intentionally, to obtain a benefit derived from the distribution of the the amounts quoted and the convergence process set out in Article 16, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment shall set objective and non-discriminatory limits on the basis of the areas declared in the application only 2015.\n\n3. Once the initial value of the duties is calculated for 2015, this value shall be corrected according to the convergence process set out in Article 16.\n\n4. Payment entitlements shall be calculated in a first stage up to the third decimal place and in a second stage they shall be rounded, either by excess or by default, to the nearest second decimal place. If the calculation results in a result in which the third decimal place is 5, the figure is rounded to the second decimal place.\n\nArticle 15. Calculation of the regional average value in 2019.\n\nThe regional average value in 2019 will be calculated by dividing the figure corresponding to the regional ceiling for basic payment in 2019, calculated as set out in Article 9, by the number of payment entitlements in 2015 in the region. in question, excluding those allocated from the national reserve in 2015.\n\nArticle 16. Convergence.\n\nThe value of basic payment entitlements in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve, shall be based on their initial unit value, calculated in accordance with Article 14.\n\nA convergence to the value of basic payment entitlements towards the corresponding regional average value in 2019 will be applied from 2015 on the basis of the following principles:\n\n(a) Basic payment entitlements, the initial unit value of which is less than 90% of the regional average value in 2019, shall be increased for the year of application in 2019 by a third of the difference between their unit value initial and 90% of the regional average value in 2019.\n\n(b) The total amount derived from increases in the value of basic payment entitlements whose initial value is less than 90% of the regional average value shall be financed by the necessary reduction to that effect of those whose value Initial unit exceeds the regional average value.\n\nc) In any event, the maximum reduction in the initial unit value of basic payment entitlements whose initial unit value is higher than the regional average value in 2019 shall be 30%.\n\n(d) No basic payment entitlement shall have a unit value of less than 60% of the regional average value in 2019, unless a maximum reduction above the upper percentage of the maximum reduction threshold described in paragraph 1 is derived from this. the previous paragraph. In such cases, the minimum unit value shall be set at the level necessary to meet that threshold.\n\nThe step of the initial unit value of basic payment entitlements to their final unit value in 2019 will be carried out in five identical stages, starting in 2015.\n\nArticle 17. Causes of force majeure or exceptional application difficulties.\n\nIn the allocation of basic payment entitlements, the causes of force majeure as provided for in Article 1105 of the Civil Code, those of Article 2.2 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, of the European Parliament and of the Council, shall apply. of 17 December 2013, and in any case those set out below:\n\na) Death of the beneficiary or disappearance of the beneficiary.\n\nb) Long-running capacity of the beneficiary.\n\n(c) A serious natural disaster or an adverse weather phenomenon similar to a natural disaster which has seriously affected the agricultural land of the holding.
