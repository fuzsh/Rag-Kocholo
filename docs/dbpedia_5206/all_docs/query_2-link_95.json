        "text": "Spain is a land of wonders and hidden corners, and Aragon is no exception! Packed with natural beauty, breathtaking landscapes and a wealth of cultural heritage, you won’t believe all you can see and do in this autonomous region. After months of lockdowns, we’re sure you want to disconnect and enjoy the world around you again. However, the idea of travelling by plane to saturated cities may still seem unappealing. The Tourism Board of Aragon has compiled a list of destinations across Huesca, Zaragoza and Teruel, selected especially for being outdoor spaces in the middle of nature that make it easy to keep a safe distance.\n\nEnjoy your freedom and explore the most authentic corners of Aragon!\n\nWhat to see in Huesca, Aragon Spain?\n\nBetween the provinces of Huesca and Lleida lies one of the most impressive routes in Aragon, and certainly in Spain. The Montfalcó Footbridges take you over vertiginous cliffs and grandiose canyons, across bridges and along paths that offer spectacular views of the ravines. A perfect route for nature lovers – but not for those with vertigo! It is essential to wear comfortable clothes and suitable footwear. Avoid the midday heat in July and August. It is also possible to do the first section on foot and return by kayak along the river!\n\nBujaruelo Valley in Aragon Spain\n\nWhen you enter the heart of the Ordesa National Park you can enjoy the unique landscape of the Bujaruelo Valley and the best mountain activities in the Central Pyrenees. This valley has waterfalls, rivers, high mountain flora and fauna, aerial trails and incredible black pine forests. It is also famous for having some of the last Pyrenean glaciers, the remains of the hermitage of San Nicolás de Bujaruelo, and the bridge of San Nicolás, the most iconic image of the valley. Another of Aragon’s must-see places on your visit to Spain.\n\nThe Finestres Wall of China\n\nAlthough not as long as its namesake, the Finestres Wall of China is spectacular in its own right. It acts as a natural border between Aragon and Catalonia, and consists of completely vertical rock layers, formed by tectonic forces that caused the stone to rise in this curious position. Its real name is Roque de la Vila, and you can admire it from viewpoints or from the abandoned village of Finestres. You can also see this phenomenon from below on a boat trip on the Canelles reservoir.\n\nTorrollones de Jubierre\n\nThe Monegrin desert is an arid region of Aragon Spain, where adapting to the rigours of the climate is difficult. This is not the destination to find flora or fauna, but Jubierre has an incomparable landscape, the result of intense wind erosion that moulded the terrain into all kinds of unique formations. Here you will feel like you are on another planet, but we assure you that the Torrollones de Jubierre are very close to home. The best known natural monuments in Jubierre are the Tozal de la Cobeta, the Tozales de los Pedregales, the Tozal de Colasico, the Tozal Solitario, the Mirador Oriental and the Peña Altar.\n\nWhat to see in Zaragoza, Aragon Spain?\n\nAguarales de Valpalmas\n\nYou don’t have to go all the way to Cappadocia in Turkey to see the Göreme Valley, when in Zaragoza you can find these famous chimneys on a smaller scale, just two kilometres from Valpalmas. The Aguarales de Valdemilaz are geological formations created by the erosion of water known as ‘piping’. Over thousands of years, water and wind have eroded the clay soil and to create stalactites. These mysterious figures will captivate you instantly, creating a dreamlike landscape. You can follow the route on foot or by car.\n\nPozo Pígalo in Luesia\n\nThis pool is one of the best known in the province of Zaragoza, located on the river Arba de Luesia. It is very popular during the summer as an ideal place to swim after completing the trek to get there. The pool and its waterfall are surrounded by huge walls of layered rock and pine forests with picnic areas. There is a campsite nearby so you can count on their services if you need them.\n\nPozo de los Aines\n\nThis large, 23-metre-deep pool is several degrees cooler than the surface temperature, which means that its interior is covered with climbing plants and vegetation hanging down its walls, as well as a layer of water lilies above the water. The small microclimate of this lagoon is home to a variety of unique animals and plants. It looks like a fairy tale location, and it is no surprise that the pool also has many legends connected to its name and origin. There is a network of caves next to it and a staircase leading down to a beautiful viewpoint.\n\nLos Bañales Archaeological Site\n\nLos Bañales is an archaeological site in the municipality of Uncastillo in Aragon Spain. It covers more than 20 hectares, and features the remains of a Roman aqueduct, thermal baths built in the 1st century, and a large residential area. In 2003 it was declared an Asset of Cultural Interest. Here archaeologists study urbanisation, cultural change, imperialism, trade and exchange, landscape and social history. The site is open to anyone interested in visiting, with informative panels for the more curious.\n\nWhat to see in Teruel, Aragon Spain?\n\nCuevas de Cañart\n\nThe Cuevas de Cañart date back to medieval times as a defensive nucleus on the southern border. They have been declared an Asset of Cultural Interest and have preserved their medieval historic centre. The Portal de Marzo is the only evidence still standing of the wall that surrounded the town in the past. There was also a castle that crowned a hill above the village but today there are no remains left. Being here will transport you to the past to the ghosts of lost times!\n\nRodeno Pine Forrest, Aragon Spain\n\nThe Pinares de Rodeno Protected Landscape is an extensive pine forest of oak or resin trees, which grow in the red sandstone. Prehistoric man lived in this unique place, and we can see evidence of his life in the magnificent rock art that forms part of the UNESCO Natural Heritage. You can visit the shelters where they produced their art depicting daily life between 12,000 and 6,500 years ago.\n\nSalt de la Portellada\n\nThis is a spectacular 20-metre waterfall of the Tastavins river, a tributary of the Matarraña river. The flow of the Salt de la Portellada depends on rainfall, so the water can disappear during droughts. In spring the waterfall is strong thanks to the rains that increase the flow of the river Tastavins – a real spectacle. Below the waterfall there is a beach where you can swim in the refreshing waters. In summer, when there is less water, you can observe the curious rocky shapes created by erosion from the top of the waterfall.\n\nParrizal de Beceite\n\nThe Parrizal de Beceite is a mountain route where you can discover its great diversity of vegetation. Despite being a fairly easy route, it still offers hikers unbeatable views from the vertiginous paths that cross the Matarraña river. The landscape carved by the river into the 60-metre high stone is one of the most travelled routes in the province of Teruel.\n\nTips for your trip to Aragon Spain\n\nOrganising and planning your trip – what to see in Aragon\n\nIf you want to plan your trip in a practical way we recommend using the Passporter app. Keep everything in one place and, organise your activities in order of proximity, and track your route on the map showing the exact distance between each place.\n\nThere, you can find a wealth of information about all the places you want to visit, get inspired by the shared experiences of other travellers, and even share the most important memories of your trip once you’ve finished."
