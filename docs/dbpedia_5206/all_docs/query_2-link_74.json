        "text": "Should you visit Zaragoza or Segovia?\n\nWhich is cheaper to visit? Which is more expensive for vacation?\n\nIf you're trying to decide where to visit between Zaragoza or Segovia, this travel comparison, which includes costs, can help. The overall cost of travel is usually a consideration when deciding where to go next, and the cost comparison down below can help you decide based on the average prices from other travelers along with your own travel budget.\n\nWhere Should I go: Zaragoza or Segovia?\n\nZaragoza\n\nAs the sun slips below the horizon, the night is greeted by the familiar glow of the exquisite cathedral Basilica del Pilar that stands above the city like a shimmering castle. This city is none other than Zaragoza, Spain, the capital city of the Zaragoza province in Aragon, Spain. Overlooking the Ebro River, Zaragoza has a population of 701,090, ranking the 32nd most populated municipality in the European Union. Zaragoza has attracted travelers from all across the world, causing the city to host the Expo in the summer of 2008 and also stand as a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012. Besides its glimmering cathedral, Zaragoza is also known for its rich history in folklore, local gastronomy, as well as hosting the well-known Fiestas del Pilar, the most celebrated of festivals in Spain.\n\nSegovia\n\nSegovia is a historic town of Spain, predating the Roman Empire to a time of Celtic possession. The town is also capital of a province of the same name, and was declared an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 for its multitude of historic structures, including a Roman aqueduct, Gothic cathedral, and royal palace.\n\nFor some great organized tour ideas, see The Best 2-Week Tours from Barcelona, The Best Family-Friendly Tours to Spain, The Best 10-Day Tours in Spain, and The Best One Week (7-Day) Tours in Spain.\n\nWhen comparing the travel costs between Zaragoza and Segovia, we can see that Segovia is more expensive. However, the two cities are actually relatively comparable in price, as the difference is somewhat minimal. Generally, this means that you could travel with generally the same travel style and level of luxury in each place. Since both cities are in Europe, it's no surprise that their costs are relatively close, as many destinations here have somewhat similar travel prices overall.\n\nIf you're trying to decide if either of these two destinations are within your price range, also see Is Zaragoza Expensive? and Is Segovia Expensive?.\n\nWhich is Bigger, Zaragoza or Segovia?\n\nZaragoza has a larger population, and is about 10 times larger than the population of Segovia. When comparing the sizes of Zaragoza and Segovia, keep in mind that a larger population does not always imply the destination has more attractions or better activities. So, always research the type of place that you want to visit along with the activities and attractions that interest you."
