        "text": "Whether you are aware of them before going or not, there are plenty of things to do in Zaragoza, the capital of the province of Aragon. It’s often seen as a transient city on the way to other major cities, but travellers who give Zaragoza a chance discover just how beautiful it can be.\n\nThings to do in Zaragoza\n\nCathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza\n\nThe Basilica del Pilar, also known as the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pilar, is without a doubt one of the most iconic places in the city and should top your list of things to do in Zaragoza.\n\nThis fantastic architectural work is one of the most important baroque buildings not only in the city, but in the whole of Spain. This construction has undergone changes over the years, originally a humble Romanesque church, to end up having two impressive towers in the form of a spire.\n\nYou can climb the San Francisco de Borja tower and enjoy spectacular views of Zaragoza at 65 metres above the city. You’ll love it!\n\nLuis Buñuel Water Park\n\nThe Luis Buñuel Water Park is an extensive park that was inaugurated in 2008 to maintain and protect the meanders. It is the perfect place to visit on a sunny day, especially if you are travelling to Zaragoza with children.\n\nYou can enjoy a large natural area with a wide range of activities for the whole family: from river pools and playgrounds to many walking and cycling routes. Children can have a great time in the children’s area in the Paseo del Botánico, where there is everything from towers with slides to swings, zip lines and even a climbing pyramid. They won’t want to leave!\n\nEl Tubo\n\nThe Tubo de Zaragoza is a famous group of narrow streets that make up a large part of the city’s historical heritage. You can stroll through many alleyways full of history, culture and impressive gastronomy.\n\nThis area is in the San Gil neighbourhood, in the heart of the city’s old quarter. You’ll be able to enjoy a pleasant stroll through its narrow streets, as well as stopping for lunch or dinner in its tapas bars thanks to the endless aromas you’ll discover as you walk through the area. You’ll also discover some of the city’s key sites, such as the remains of the Roman Wall and many Gothic and Renaissance-style courtyards.\n\nParque Grande in Zaragoza\n\nThe Parque Grande, with an area of 40 hectares, is one of the most beautiful places in Zaragoza. Until relatively recently, it was the largest park in the city.\n\nIt is the ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a while, as you can enjoy a large area full of trees, fountains and nature. This park is also known by the name of Primo de Rivera, as it was inaugurated during his dictatorship. You can walk through it while discovering some iconic monuments, such as the Quiosco de la Música or the Neptune Fountain. Enjoy the haven of peace in the heart of the city.\n\nStone Bridge\n\nThe Stone Bridge of Zaragoza is one of the most important monuments to visit on your trip to Zaragoza. In addition to being the oldest bridge crossing the Ebro River, this structure is over 2,000 years old.\n\nIt is 500-metres long and connects Calle Don Jaime I to the Arrabal neighbourhood, two of the city’s busiest areas. It is the perfect place for a stroll at dusk, because you can watch a spectacular sunset with the city in the background and the colours reflected in the water. You can’t miss it!\n\nSee the Aljafería Palace in Zaragoza\n\nThe Aljafería Palace is an impressive Arab monument, one of the most beautiful and significant places to see in Zaragoza. It dates back to the 11th century, the years of splendour of the Taifa kingdom.\n\nThis place has enormous historical value for the city. It has also seen a continuous evolution in its functions, from military barracks to a palace where Muslim taifas lived. You can admire the beautiful façade, but inside you will find the most interesting features: the Golden Hall, the horseshoe arches and even the courtyard of Santa Isabel.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Savior, Zaragoza\n\nThe Cathedral of the Saviour, also known as La Seo, is one of the most beautiful landmarks in Zaragoza. This imposing building dates back to the period between the 12th and 18th centuries, built on the site of the old mosque.\n\nYou can enjoy a stroll around the pleasant little square where it is located, as well as admire its impressive façade, characterised by a Gothic, Renaissance, Mudejar, Baroque and Neoclassical styles. The most striking feature is the impressive Mudejar wall of the parish chapel. You can also go inside, where you will find rich decorations in the same styles mentioned above. You will love it!\n\nSee the Plaza del Pilar in Zaragoza\n\nThe Plaza del Pilar is located right in the centre of Zaragoza, and is one of the main meeting points and one of the most visited places by travellers. There you can take a stroll while getting to know its main monuments.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Saviour and the Zaragoza City Hall, as well as the Lonja, will catch your attention. All these monuments have a characteristic Renaissance style, each one fulfilling a unique and independent function. Another spot that will fascinate you is the beautiful Fuente de la Hispanidad fountain.

Other symbolic features that you will find in this small town are its curious hanging houses, its Renaissance Episcopal Palace, or its beautiful Town Hall.\n\nBelchite Viejo\n\nBelchite Viejo is one of the most visited villages in Zaragoza, only 40 minutes away from the city. This village is mainly known for its numerous ruins of buildings that were attacked during the terrible Civil War.\n\nThat is why it has an incredible historical value, as a reminder of the terrible events that took place at that time. Due to the fact that it is made up of rubble, it is also known as the “ghost town“, with the Convent of San Agustín and the Arco de la Villa standing out.\n\nSee Uncastillo near Zaragoza\n\nUncastillo is one of the top recommendations if you ask about charming villages near Zaragoza.
