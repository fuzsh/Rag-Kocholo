        "text": "Fancy a bit of domestic tourism? If so, we invite you to get in your rental car, get the GPS ready and discover these towns near Zaragoza that are going to leave you speechless.\n\nNearby destinations that have a lot to offer\n\nBelchite Viejo\n\nUndoubtedly, this is one of the most well-known towns near Zaragoza. Thousands of visitors pass through it every year, including mystery lovers and history buffs.\n\nBelchite Viejo is a town that was abandoned after being the scene of one of the harshest chapters of the Civil War in 1937. Its inhabitants moved to Belchite Nuevo but the old municipality remained as a ghost town that has never ceased to attract the attention of the curious.\n\nIt is about 45 minutes from the center of Zaragoza and there are places not to be missed, such as the churches of San Agustín and San Martín de Tours, and its Clock Tower, which has been declared a World Heritage Site. If you love photography, you can spend hours at El Planerón, from where you can see incredible sunsets. And, of course, be sure to take a look at the trenches and defensive posts that are still visible in the area.\n\nAnento, one of the most beautiful villages close to Zaragoza\n\nIn the valley of the Jiloca you will find this small town that barely exceeds 100 inhabitants, but that exudes so much charm in every corner, which is listed as one of the most beautiful villages in Spain, and a visit is sure not to disappoint.\n\nHiking enthusiasts will have a great time on the Aguallueve route (a circular route just 2.5 kilometers long), with a spectacular karst relief formed by several springs flowing through the region. The microclimate of the area has given rise to a beautiful green space that contrasts sharply with the dry landscape in other areas of the village.\n\nAnother must-see is the Church of San Blas. While its impressive architecture is something to marvel at, you should go inside to enjoy one of the most significant Gothic altarpieces in Aragon.\n\nDaroca\n\nA little more than an hour from Zaragoza is a town that will delight lovers of medieval architecture. It has a fortified enclosure surrounded by walls built between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, which have been admirably preserved. For this reason, it is not surprising that Daroca is listed as a Historic-Artistic Site.\n\nIt was once home to Muslims, Jews and Christians, and the influence of these three cultures was forever marked in its architecture. There is so much to see that it is definitely worth your time. Among the must-see sights are the Puerta Baja and Puerta Alta, the Calle Mayor, the mine, and the Jewish quarter.\n\nTarazona\n\nThis is one of the most visited villages near Zaragoza. Located at the foot of Moncayo, its history dates back more than 2,000 years. Iberians, Romans, Visigoths, Jews and Muslims have passed through this region, and traces of their presence are still visible today.\n\nYou can start your visit at the cathedral of Nuestra Señora de la Huerta, in its Gothic style. As it took three centuries to finish its construction, do not be surprised when you see its dome and tower in Mudejar style, because they give this building a unique appearance.\n\nIn Tarazona there are many more interesting places, such as its main square, the old Jewish quarter and its hanging houses (it’s true, they are not only found in Cuenca, although those are the best known).\n\nBiel, one of the towns near Zaragoza that you can't miss\n\nThis time you will have to travel a little more than an hour, but as you will be in a comfortable car, this will not be a problem. Almost without realizing it, you will reach Biel, in the Santo Domingo mountain range. A small municipality with a strong Jewish influence.\n\nIf you have come to this town you cannot leave without seeing its castle and the church of San Martin, which make up a spectacular historical site that takes you back to the Middle Ages. And, of course, you have to take a walk through its Jewish quarter."
