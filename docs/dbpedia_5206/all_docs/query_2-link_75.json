        "text": "Zaragoza capital may very well become the first reference point for the initiation of this Mudejar Route.\n\nZaragoza is known as \"Lady of the Four Cultures\" - Iberians, Romans, Arabs, and Christians - and such tradition brings cultural elements worthy of being taken into account when referring their qualities and attractions.\n\nLa Seo de Zaragoza was consecrated as a cathedral on January 6, 1119, on the site of an old mosque. Special mention deserves the Mudejar wall.\n\nThe primitive church of San Pablo is known as the \"third cathedral\" of Zaragoza. It was built in the thirteenth century. Its Mudejar tower is octagonal.\n\n© 2001 Miguel Angel Latorre.\n\nOther Zaragoza churches with Mudejar towers are: Santa María Magdalena , San Miguel de los Navarros, San Gil, ...\n\nThe Palace of La Aljaferia was built by Aben-Aljafe in 854 and was the fifth recreation of the Taifa kings of Zaragoza. The Aljafería is an impressive work due to its arches and columns.\n\nMudejar in the rest of the province of Zaragoza.\n\nMuel may be our next destination. Despite its apparent modesty, it has an ancient Roman dike on the Huerva River, and an accredited and well-known ceramic school of very valuable Arab tradition and some Goya frescoes guarded in one of its hermitages. Muel was cited in ancient historiography as the old \"Muwala\".\n\nIn the town of Longares you must visit, in the heart of Cariñena, its beautiful temple of the 16th century, with Mudejar tower of XIV, built on brick.\n\nPaniza disputes with Cariñena the quality of its wines. Highlights the slender Mudejar tower church of Our Lady of the Angels.\n\nMainar has a beautiful Renaissance Mudejar church.\n\nDaroca It is known as \"The City of Corporals\", with reference to a miracle of great importance performed in the Middle Ages. The wide walled perimeter attracts attention. Its wall had up to twelve towers. The oldest remains of the castle are from the time of the Arabs.\n\nCalatayud, is now the most populous city in Aragon, after the three provincial capitals. The Muslims were those who moved the city to the place it occupies today, with many more facilities for its defense because it is a strategic place, on the hills of the Revelin and the clock, around the castle of Ayyub or \"Qal´at Ayyub\", from which its current place name comes.\n\nThe visit to the city includes in a privileged way the contemplation of the Ayyub castle, because the remaining four of the environment are very damaged. The Mudejar finds its best representation in the cloister of the beautiful collegiate church of Santa María, probably built on an old mosque. Excellent samples of the Mudejar qualified as bilbilitano are the whole of San Pedro de los Francos, scene of the General Courts in the time of King Fernando the Catholic, and before the octagonal tower of San Andres, the church of our lady of the Rock, some parts of the Collegiate Church of the Holy Sepulcher, San Juan el Real, the former Seminary of Nobles, the school of the Company of Jesus and remains of some convents from the time of Confiscation.\n\nEn Magallon, we have its parish church that is from the 15th and 14th centuries on the ruins of an old castle. It is Mudejar work with baroque cover.\n\nIn Borja we can admire the Mudejar-style Shells House and its Roman-Muslim castle.\n\nAlberite de San Juan, has important Mudejar monuments.\n\nTarazona, is near the moncayo.\n\nThe beautiful and ancient episcopal city of Tarazona is one of the tourist reasons that justify one and a thousand visits in Aragon and throughout Spain.\n\nIn the upper Cinto neighborhood there are hanging houses typical of the old Jewish quarter.\n\nThe Magdalena church is from the 12th century and its unmistakable Mudejar tower is from the 15th century.\n\nThe Episcopal Palace was built on the old Zuda.\n\nOther Mudejar Routes From Zaragoza to Tarazona From Ricla to Alhama de Aragón From Longares to Daroca From Zaragoza to La Puebla From Daroca to Mora From Zaragoza to Peñarroya\n\nList of maps of Aragon.\n\nHere you can get a map of the situation in Aragon.\n\nAragon road map.\n\nAmple your information on Aragon\n\nIf you want Ample your information on Aragon you can begin crossing some Monasteries, o 40 Castles another interesting route is the Mudejar, Patrimony of the Humanity, also you can extend your cultural knowledge on Aragón examining its municipal and institutional heraldy without forgetting, of course, some of its emblematicas figures as San George Pattern of Aragon or its personages I illustrate adding to these data a minimum crossed by its history o some books.\n\nAlso Aragon enjoys a diverse and varied Nature where passing by plants, animals, or landscapes we can arrive at a fantastic bestiario that lives in its monuments.\n\nThe information will not be complete without a stroll by its three provinces: Zaragoza, Teruel and Huesca and ours varied Regions, with shutdown in some of its spectacular landscapes like Ordesa or the Moncayo or by opposition in the valle of the Ebro.\n\nIf reasons of work or relatives have taken to you Far from Aragon you can Download images of bottom, sounds or animations\n\nAlso you can dedicate you to the intangible ones: from the legend compilation that also does to universal Aragon you can persecute the presence of Santo Grial in Aragon.\n\nOther pages on Aragon in Internet\n\nOther current also you can interest.\n\nHuesca | Teruel | Zaragoza | Shires| Aragon\n\nLa Seo | The Pilar | Mudejar | Goya | Bestiary | Museum Provincial Zaragoza\n\nTourism | Geology | Nature | Alfabetic index | Maps\n\nMudejar route in Zaragoza.
