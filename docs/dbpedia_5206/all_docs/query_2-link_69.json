        "text": "This article is about the city in Spain. See also Zaragoza (disambiguation) or Saragossa (disambiguation).\n\nMunicipality in :Template:Country data Aragon, SpainTemplate:SHORTDESC:Municipality in :Template:Country data Aragon, Spain\n\nZaragoza[n 1] (also called Saragossa[n 2] in English)[4] is the capital city of the Zaragoza province and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the Gállego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\n\nOn 1 January 2019 the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 706,904,[5] (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles). The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population. The city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682 feet) above sea level.\n\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\n\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local gastronomy, and landmarks such as the Basílica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafería Palace. Together with La Seo and the Aljafería, several other buildings form part of the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe Romans called the ancient city Caesaraugusta, from which the present name derives. The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called Salduie.[6]\n\nHistory[]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Zaragoza\n\nRoman Caesaraugusta[]\n\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie [es] (Salduba in Roman sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta[7] at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC.\n\nMiddle ages[]\n\nThe city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth century AD.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 8th century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\n\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Zaragoza became an independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family.[9] Ruled by the Banu Hud since 1039,[9] the taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II.[10] It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.[9]\n\nOn 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids,[11] and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon.[12] After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly occupied by Alfonso VII of León. The city control was held by García Ramírez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona.[citation needed] The marriage union was the origin of the Crown of Aragón, and union with Castile would not happen for another 333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones.\n\n13th century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related with the Spanish Inquisition:Template:What those of Saint Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbués, head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his \"murder\" at the hands of \"jealous Jews\" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish population of Zaragoza.[13]\n\nEarly Modern history[]\n\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564.[14] It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25–30,000.\n\nIn the context of the 1701–1714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas.[17] Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orléans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day.[17] This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.\n\nAn important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called motín de los broqueleros, named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (broqueles). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafería.\n\nLate Modern history[]\n\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.[23]\n\nRailway transport arrived to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 via the inauguration of the Barcelona–Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estación del Norte.[24] The opening of the Madrid–Zaragoza line took place a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.[24]\n\nThe July 1936 coup d'etat (with Gral. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio [es], Urrutia [es], Sueiro [es], Major Cebollero and Gral. Gregorio de Benito [es] at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. The military uprising in Africa on 17 July was followed in the early morning of 19 July by the military command, easily attaining their objectives in Zaragoza, despite the latter's status as stronghold of mobilised labour (most of them CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, would flee to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\n\nSee also: Regional Defence Council of Aragon\n\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-à-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.[31]\n\nThe General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by José Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\n\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US–Spain air base in Zaragoza.\n\nFollowing the declaration of Zaragoza as Polo de Desarrollo Industrial (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time.[33] The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.\n\nIn 1979, the Hotel Corona de Aragón fire killed at least 80. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA has been blamed, but officially the fire is still regarded as accidental.[34] ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.[35]\n\nSince 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\n\nGeography[]\n\nLocation[]\n\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.\n\nThe city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.\n\nThe municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2,[38] making it the 9th largest municipality in Spain.\n\nWhile the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments.[40] The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600–750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water.[40] There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulfúrica, in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.[40]\n\nThe Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course.[42] Zaragoza is also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the Gállego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\n\nClimate[]\n\nZaragoza has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk),[44] as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty 322 millimetres (12.7 in) with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April–May) and autumn (September–November), with a relative drought in summer (July–August) and winter (December–March).\n\nTemperatures are hot in summer reaching up to 44.5 °C (112.1 °F), and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from November to January[citation needed]) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the Cierzo (related to other northerly winds such as the Mistral in the SE of France) on clear days. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. The Cierzo can cause a 'wind chill factor' as low as −10 °C (14 °F) during cold spells.\n\nAdministrative subdivisions[]\n\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:[46]\n\n# Urban district 1 Casco Histórico [es] 2 Centro [es] 3 Delicias 4 Universidad [es] 5 San José [es] 6 Las Fuentes [es] 7 La Almozara [es] 8 Oliver–Valdefierro [es] 9 Torrero [es] 10 El Rabal [es] 11 Actur–Rey Fernando [es] 12 Casablanca [es] 13 Santa Isabel [es] 14 Miralbueno [es] 15 Distrito Sur [es]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nPopulation, in thousands, can be seen here:\n\nReligion[]\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0 % of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0 % as practising Catholic, 6.7 % as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0 % as agnostic, 4.3 % as atheist and 2.3 % as \"other religions\", while a 6.7 % did not answer.[47]\n\nImmigration[]\n\nIn 2017 there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza,[48] which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\n\nForeign Nationals in Zaragoza in 2017[48] Position Nationality People 1st Template:Flag2 19,064 2nd Template:Flag2 5,804 3rd Template:Flag2 4,497 4th Template:Flag2 3,302 5th Template:Flag2 2,488 6th Template:Flag2 2,470 7th Template:Flag2 2,117 8th Template:Flag2 1,115 9th Template:Flag2 1,030\n\nEconomy[]\n\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA.[citation needed]\n\nThe city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, Plataforma Logística de Zaragoza (PLAZA), and the Parque Tecnológico de Reciclado (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\n\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1994.[49] In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135's) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, Academia General Militar, a number of brigades at San Gregorio, and other garrisons.[50]\n\nCulture[]\n\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date.[51] According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called Nuestra Señora del Pilar (\"Our Lady of the Pillar\").[52]\n\nFestivals[]\n\nThe annual Fiestas del Pilar last for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. Since this date coincided in 1492 with the first sighting by Christopher Columbus of the Americas, that day is also celebrated as El Día de la Hispanidad (Columbus Day) by Spanish-speaking people worldwide.[citation needed]\n\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as \"Jota aragonesa\" (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the Ofrenda de Flores, or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the Ofrenda de Frutos on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\n\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Aragón counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.[53]\n\nEducation[]\n\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\n\nThere is also a private university, Universidad San Jorge, which is located in Villanueva de Gállego.\n\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lycée Français Molière de Saragosse.\n\nTransportation[]\n\nRoads[]\n\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\n\nBuses[]\n\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities.[55] Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.[56]\n\nBicycle[]\n\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme; the 'bizi zaragoza' - which consists in the payment of an annual charge.\n\nTram[]\n\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\n\nRailway[]\n\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by RENFE, AVE, which connects Madrid and Barcelona via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75 minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90 minutes. The central station is \"Intermodal Zaragoza Delicias Station\", which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by RENFE called cercanías.\n\nAirport[]\n\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighborhood, 10 kilometers from the city center.\n\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012,[57] and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\n\nPublic transportation statistics[]\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.2 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.[58]\n\nSports[]\n\n[]\n\nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda División. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga. One of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup \"Copa del Rey\" six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\n\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro.
