From the Pyrenees mountain range to the Ebro River Valley, Aragon is a place of striking contrasts and natural beauty.\n\nAragon is also somewhat of an unsung hero in Spanish cuisine and culture, and many newcomers to Spain will not know of this beautiful and diverse region. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the highlights of Aragon, including its climate, geography, inhabitants, cuisine, agriculture, and industries.\n\nGeography and Landscape\n\nAragon is a landlocked region bordered by Catalonia to the east, Valencia to the southeast, Castilla-La Mancha to the south, and Navarra, La Rioja, and the Basque Country to the west. The Pyrenees mountain range dominates the northern part of the region, while the Ebro River Valley runs through the central and southern areas. The landscape is varied, with lush forests, rugged mountains, fertile valleys, and arid plains.\n\nThe capital of the region is the city of Zaragoza, which overlooks the Ebro River in the city center and is known for its rich cultural heritage and a blend of architectural styles that make it a fascinating destination for tourists interested in history, culture, and tradition. The city’s historic center is characterized by charming narrow streets, plazas, and historic buildings. It’s a great place for leisurely strolls and exploring the local culture and history.\n\nThe region and cities within it are also well known as a leading agricultural zone in Spain, with numerous products and fresh produce grown in the fertile terrain. In addition to Zaragoza, there are several other sizeable cities and towns in the Aragon region of Spain, although none are as large as Zaragoza.\n\nSome of the best-known include:\n\nHuesca: Huesca is the largest city in the province of Huesca and serves as its provincial capital. It is known for its historical sites, including the Huesca Cathedral and the Castillo de Montearagón.\n\nTeruel: Teruel is another important city in Aragon and is known for its Mudejar architecture, including the Teruel Cathedral and the Torre de El Salvador. It’s also famous for the tragic love story of the “Lovers of Teruel.”\n\nCalatayud: Calatayud is a historic town known for its Moorish influences, including the Colegiata de Santa María and the Castle of Calatayud. It’s also known for its thermal baths.\n\nBarbastro: Barbastro is a picturesque town in the province of Huesca known for its wine production, particularly in the Somontano wine region. It also has a beautiful old town and cathedral.\n\nAlcañiz: Alcañiz is known for its medieval architecture, including the Alcañiz Castle and the Santa María la Mayor Collegiate Church. It’s located in the province of Teruel.\n\nFraga: Fraga is a town in the province of Huesca known for its agricultural activities and historical sites like the Church of Saint Peter and the Convent of Saint Clare.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate in Aragon varies depending on the specific location within the region due to its diverse geography, which includes mountainous areas, plateaus, and valleys. Generally, Aragon experiences a continental climate with both Mediterranean and Atlantic influences.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the climate in different parts of Aragon:\n\nZaragoza and Ebro Valley\n\nIn the central and eastern parts of Aragon, including Zaragoza, the climate is typically characterized as semi-arid or continental. Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C (86°F) in July and August. Winters are cooler, with occasional cold spells and frost. Rainfall is relatively low and concentrated in spring and fall/autumn.\n\nHuesca and the Pyrenees\n\nIn the northern part of Aragon, which includes the Pyrenees Mountains and the city of Huesca, the climate becomes more mountainous.

Precipitation levels are lower in this part of Aragon.\n\nSomontano and wine-producing areas\n\nThe Somontano wine region, located in the province of Huesca, benefits from a slightly milder climate due to its proximity to the Pyrenees.
