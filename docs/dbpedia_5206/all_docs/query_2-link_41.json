        "text": "The Ebro River plays a fundamental role in the city of Saragossa, as it crosses the city and marks its geography in a significant way.\n\nThe Ebro River begins at Pico Tres Mares, in Cantabria, and after traveling 930 km and passing through cities such as Logro√±o and Saragossa, it flows into Deltebre, in the province of Tarragona.\n\nIts average flow is 600 m3/s, making it the largest and longest river in Spain and one of the most important in the country. Currently, 10 km of the river runs through the city, leaving almost 20 km of banks that cross the city from west to east, making it a prominent geographical and landscape element.\n\nSince the Ebro River is an integral part of Saragossa, the city has several bridges that cross the river. One of the most iconic bridges is the Stone Bridge, built in the 15th century and considered one of the symbols of the city. Other important bridges include the Iron Bridge and the Santiago Bridge.\n\nThe Ebro River offers opportunities for recreational activities, such as boating and fishing. Along its banks, there are landscaped areas and walking or cycling paths, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy nature and panoramic views of the river.\n\nNear Saragossa, on the banks of the Ebro River, there are natural spaces of great ecological value, such as the Galachos de Juslibol Natural Reserve. These places are important for the conservation of fauna and flora. local and offer opportunities for bird watching and outdoor activities.\n\nThe Ebro River plays a crucial role in the life of Saragossa, both from a geographical, economic and recreational point of view. In addition to being a distinctive feature of the city, the Ebro River contributes to the natural beauty and quality of life of the region."
