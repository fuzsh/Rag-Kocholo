        "text": "Which cities in Spain should I visit?\n\nTravelers planning a trip to Spain often wonder which cities in Spain they should visit.\n\nWe at Spain Less Traveled truly believe that amazing Spain travel itineraries include a healthy mix of some of Spain’s thriving monumental larger cities as well as some of its quaint and charming small towns.\n\nTo inspire and give you some Spain travel tips as well as ideas, here is a list of our top 30 cities in Spain. We included some of our favorite regional and provincial capital cities as well as Madrid and Barcelona, from A to Z.\n\nAnd if you need it broken down even further, check out our answer to the “Where should I go in Spain?” question, highlighting the top three destinations and beyond!\n\nWhere is Madrid? Where is Extremadura? A map of Spain for travelers\n\nBut first, for a visual, here is a map of Spain. All of the top 30 cities to visit in Spain we listed are included below are on this map. Now you do not need to guess “Where is Barcelona?” or “Where is Granada?” It is all here.\n\nAnd remember, we can help you string it all together in an order that makes sense and design your bucket list Spain trip. Learn more about our boutique travel services here.\n\nIn alphabetical order, we start with Alicante, which is the capital of Alicante province in the Valencian community.\n\nThis pleasant city on Spain’s southeastern coast often gets a misplaced reputation due to the number of tourists and foreigners who live there. But with a little exploration, you can easily get past that. In fact, Alicante city remains very Spanish in nature.\n\nIts centerpiece is Santa Bárbara Castle, one of the most visited castles in Spain. From the top, you can get an amazing view of the city below and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nStroll along La Explanada de España, Alicante’s main promenade, constructed of millions of red, cream, and black tiles. The pattern resembles the rolling Mediterranean Sea waves. Along the path, you will often find market stalls.\n\nAnd of course, a visit to the historic center is always worth it. Alicante’s historic center is known as “El Barrio.” It has all the charm of a typical historic center in Spain. Be sure to seek out El Carrer dels Bolets otherwise known as “mushroom street.” If you find it, you will see why it has that name!\n\nIf you are looking for beach time, Playa de San Juan is a long, sandy beach in the city itself. It is easy to get to by public transportation.\n\nAlmería\n\nThe city of Almeria Spain is not on most travelers’ list of Spanish cities to visit. But for those willing to venture off the beaten path to the southeastern corner of Andalucia, Almería city, is a diamond in the rough.\n\nThe cathedral of Almería was built on the site of a former mosque that was destroyed during an earthquake. Though built in the Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles, some Moorish influences can be seen.\n\nThe tapas scene in Almería Spain is unique in that you get a choice in your free tapa. This is perfect for pickier eaters or those with dietary restrictions who want to discover Spain’s tapas scene, but without being presented with a plate of jamón. And the tapas are delicious, made with a variety of regional products fresh from the province’s farms.\n\nBut this Spanish city’s main draw is the Alcazaba, a fortress built by the Moors in the 1000s that looms above the city. Almería’s Alcazaba was said to be one of the largest in Spain at that time. Today, very little of the original construction remains, but you can still view part of the original walls, which are still intact.\n\nAlmería is a port city. It is also a great place to soak up some beach time on the Mediterranean. For that head to Playa del Zapillo.\n\nBarcelona\n\nOne of the highlights of Spain on many itineraries, the capital of the autonomous region of Cataluña, Barcelona, is the second largest of the cities in Spain. And it the most popular with visitors. As it should be, at least for a few days.\n\nSituated in northeastern Spain, on the Mediterranean sea, Barcelona’s seaside location, beautiful architecture, and unique culture make it a great city to visit.\n\nTravelers to Spain should not miss Anton Gaudí’s unfinished masterpiece La Sagrada Familia. A basilica, but unlike anything you’ve ever seen, this is the signature of the Barcelona skyline. Be sure to purchase tickets well in advance to lavish in its interior which is a brilliant mix of color, light, and shapes. Take in the details of this sacred space, and climb one of the towers for the views!\n\nAlong with La Sagrada Familia, be sure to check out all of the other modernist architecture gems spread around the city. Gaudí’s Casa Batlló and Casa Vicens are well worth a visit. Another true highlight is L’Hospital de la Santa Creu, designed by architect Lluis Domènech i Montaner, with its modernista mixed with medieval and Moorish architectural styles.\n\nBe sure to spend some time wandering around Barcelona’s beloved Gothic Quarter too. Also in the old city is the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar, with its amazing rooftop views.\n\nGet out of the center and into some of Barcelona’s neighborhoods. Make sure to take some time to walk around the expansive Eixample neighborhood. The busy residential streets here are full of modernista architecture, typical to Barcelona. Browse the small shops and cute cafes in the Gràcia neighborhood.\n\nDon’t linger on the famous Las Ramblas. But while you are there, check out La Boqueria market.\n\nAnd for a more authentic Barcelona market experience, head to Mercat de San Antoni. Not only does the market have some great food stalls, but it is a real working market where the neighborhood shops for its essentials.\n\nAnd if you know where to look Barcelona is full of great restaurants serving up Catalan favorites. If you want to try some of the local cuisine, Agut and Can Cullertes are some top picks. All washed down with a glass of cava of course!\n\nBarcelona has several urban beaches.\n\nBilbao\n\nThe northern industrial city of Bilbao is never on anyone’s list of the most beautiful cities in Spain. But there are still compelling reasons to include this city in Basque Country on your Spain travel itinerary.\n\nBilbao put itself on the world art map in 1997 when the Guggenheim Museum opened. Housed in a building that is a modern architectural icon itself, this large museum has an impressive collection of modern art as well as world-class rotating exhibitions.\n\nBe sure to walk around the grounds to see the giant spider sculpture and 12-meter tall “puppy” made entirely from begonias.\n\nAnother one for art lovers to add to the list of things to see in Bilbao is the Museo de Belles Artes (fine arts museum). Here you can find works by some of Spain’s most famous artists such as El Greco and Francisco Goya.\n\nThe Euskal Museoa (Basque museum) is the most comprehensive museum highlighting the unique culture, history, language and traditions of Basque Country. Learn more about the Basque people why this small sliver of Spain and France has always been their home.\n\nBilbao has a small old city (casco viejo), and in its heart is a Gothic cathedral. Foodies will want to head to Plaza Nueva or to Mercado de la Ribera (Ribera Market) for their fill of Basque pintxos. This is one of the top markets in Spain.\n\nAcross the river is Bilbao la Vieja, the trendy neighborhood full of street art, cafes, and even more pintxos.\n\nWithout a doubt Basque Country has some of the best food in Spain, and its largest city is no exception.\n\nCáceres\n\nMany say that Cádiz city, the capital of Cádiz province is Europe’s oldest city.\n\nAnd visitors who detour to this corner of Southern Spain will truly feel the history.\n\nThe city’s centro historico has a charm that can only come with being one of the oldest European settlements. With sort of a Caribbean flavor, the sea walls and forts can easily remind visitors of La Habana, Cuba or San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nAt the center of the historic center is the cathedral, built in both Baroque and Neo-Classical styles. Don’t miss a climb up to the bell tower for the amazing views of Cádiz city, the port, and of course the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnd Cádiz’s prime location on the Costa de la Luz (coast of the light) is perfect for beach-lovers.\n\nPlaya de la Caleta is one of the best urban beaches in Spain. Beachgoers will want to remember that this is the Atlantic Ocean and it can be downright windy at times. But this is why kite surfers love this part of Spain!\n\nCádiz is also known for its food. This corner of Andalucía produces some of Spain’s best seafood, wines, cheese, and olive oil. For a true treat on a budget, eat at the bar attached to El Faro, the Michelin Star restaurant.\n\nCórdoba\n\nCharming Córdoba city is one of the cities in Spain that is often included on Spain travel itineraries. It is one of Andalucía’s quaintest cities.\n\nBut one mistake visitors often make is simply doing a day trip to Córdoba from Seville. We love Córdoba and we recommended staying a few days to really get to know it!\n\nMost Córdoba itineraries are centered around the Mezquita Mayor of Córdoba, and this draws many visitors to the city. Its iconic bright orange and white arches are world-famous. Don’t forget to look up too!\n\nThe Mezquita’s unique history blended with its present-day function makes it unforgettable.The Mezquita-Mayor is Córdoba’s working cathedral! Nowhere else will you see a Catholic chapel plopped right in the middle of a well-preserved former mosque. What you see today is an interesting mix of Moorish and Renaissance and Baroque-style architecture. No doubt that what remains of the Mosque is splendid.\n\nWhen the orange trees are blooming the whole area whole city is engulfed in a delightful smell of the flowers from Cordoba’s signature fruit.\n\nCórdoba is very famous for its Jewish history as well and the well-preserved old Jewish quarter brings that history alive.\n\nThe old synagogue is open to visitors and is impressive. You can find Hebrew letters amongst the intricate Moorish-style carvings. Nearby, in Plaza de Maimónides, look for the statue honoring the famous Jewish philosopher and Torah-scholar, Moses Maimónides.\n\nOne of the top things to do in Spain, la Fiesta de los Patios is held in Córdoba every May. Travelers who plan to be in Córdoba for this beautiful festival honoring the incredible Andaluz-style gardens and courtyards will rave about it for years to come. This is our favorite festival in Spain!\n\nBut even if you can’t plan your trip to Spain in May, you’re still in luck. Some of Córdoba’s patios can be visited year-round. Palacio de Viana has many patios and gardens. Also open year-round is the Trueque Cuatro, with its typical Cordobés patio.\n\nWalk across the Guadalquivir river on the Roman Bridge, and take in the views from the other side.\n\nCórdoba has some amazing local foods. On a hot summer day, nothing beats a bowl of salmorejo, a local, delicious, and refreshing cold tomato soup blended with bread. And lots and lots of local olive oil. You can even sample traditional Jewish food, Sephardic-style, at the restaurant Casa Mazal in the Judería.\n\nDon’t rush Córdoba. Spend a few days here and give yourself time to get lost in its charming small streets, away from the main attractions. We promise, Córdoba will enchant you. Take it all in!\n\nCuenca\n\nOne of the most beloved cities in Spain with locals and travelers alike, Granada is considered to be the most beautiful city in Spain by many. And it is easy to see why.\n\nShortly after arriving in Granada, you will soon get your first glimpse the Alhambra, guarding the city down below. Nestled in the foothills, it is unforgettable!\n\nThe Alhambra is a complex, a maze of gardens, fortress walls, forested paths, and a “little” summer palace. At the center is the Nazrid Palace, home to some of the last Moorish sultan of Spain. And it is fit for royalty indeed! Imagine a play of light and shadow adorned by colorful and geometrical tilework, all surrounded by detailed carvings with intricate patterns and Arabic letters. But you really just need to see to understand how beautiful it is and to have a strategy as to how to visit the Alhambra.\n\nJust below the Alhambra on the other side of the Darro river the Albaizyn is Granada’s old Moorish quarters. Visitors love walking its quaint cobblestone streets, adorned with whitewashed buildings. And the views from the top are amazing, especially the classic Granada view, with the Alhambra backdropped by the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nIn the historic center, the bodies of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, the catholic monarchs, are buried in the chapel of Granada’s cavernous Baroque and Renaissance-style cathedral.\n\nIf you want to catch a flamenco show, be sure to head to the caves of Sacromonte, where many say this signature and passionate Spanish dance and musical style was born. And for some of the best of Spain’s free tapas, you will want to hop from bar to bar on Calle Navas.\n\nThere are so many more things to do in Granada Spain is one of the cities in Spain that you visit. Make sure to carve out some time to just take in the beautiful city and enjoy it.\n\nJaén\n\nJaén, one of the eight provinces in Andalucía is famous for two things: 1. its olive trees and olive (and olive oil) production and 2. its abundance of castles, including some of the best castles in Spain.\n\nAnd the provincial capital, the city of Jaén has both. And so much more.\n\nJaén is worth the visit. It is one of Spain’s more off-the-beaten-path smaller cities that most travelers pass up.\n\nThe small centro histórico is pleasant and at the center of it all is Jaén’s cathedral, built in Renaissance style.\n\nThe Parador in Santa Catalina castle is a great splurge - the views are impressive! You can truly spend the night in a castle!\n\nAdditionally, within the city limits you can find well preserved Arab baths, a small Judería (old Jewish neighborhood), and some wonderful food.\n\nAnd yes, if you want to taste Spain’s liquid gold (olive oil), this is the province where some of the best olive oil in Spain (and even the world) comes from. There are opportunities to arrange for tastings and learn more about the different types as well as the production of olive oil.\n\nMadrid\n\nNot only one of the greatest cities in Spain, but one of Europe’s best too, Spain’s capital, Madrid, is vibrant, friendly, livable, and unapologetically Spanish.\n\nDon’t make one of the most common Spain travel mistakes which is simply using it as a stopover or a transit hub. Without a doubt, it is worth it to spend some time in Madrid to truly discover it.\n\nThe largest city in Spain with a population of over three million, it is impossible to even scratch the surface to summarize Madrid for travelers in a few small paragraphs. So here are just a fraction of our favorites. You can find even more in our Madrid travel guide.\n\nMadrid is an art lovers’ paradise. Home to three world-class art museums and many smaller ones, you can spend weeks just visiting Madrid’s museums.\n\nThe Prado, the biggest of all houses an impressive collection of Spanish art including numerous notable works by Francisco Goya and Diego Velazquez. And the art extends beyond Spain. Flemish painter Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly delights is part of the permanent collection.\n\nFor those interested in contemporary Spanish art, the Reina Sofía museum. Amongst its impressive collection detailing important events in Spanish history is Pablo Picasso’s massive painting Guernica. Don’t just look. Study and learn. Without even being there in person, Picasso managed to depict a very grim day during the Spanish Civil War. The museum also houses other Picassos as well as works by Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí.\n\nThere are even more wonderful museums in Madrid that cover a wide range of themes and topics. From local history to trains and metro lines to archeology, there’s a museum for it in Madrid!\n\nParis has Versailles and Madrid has el Palacio Real, the Royal Palace. The first Bourbon king of Spain, Felipe the Fifth’s goal was to build an over-the-top lavish palace to put some of its other European counterparts to shame. And so this royal residence in the heart of Madrid was constructed. No longer a residence, but still part of the crown, the palace is now open to the public except in the event when the royal family needs it. Follow the route through the maze of rooms fit for a king.\n\nMadrid is a city with a lot of green space, and Retiro Park is one of the most urban parks in Europe. Do as the locals do, go for a Sunday stroll. Or perhaps rent a small paddle boat at the park’s man-made lake. Retiro is full of surprises.\n\nAnother surprise of Madrid can be found in another park, Parque de Oeste. At the top is Templo de Debod, one of the only authentic Egyptian temples outside of Egypt. This is also a great place for a signature Madrid sunset.\n\nLike most cities in Spain, Madrid is full of plazas, from little local squares to grand plazas lined with impressive buildings. Plaza Mayor is the oldest and very popular with visitors. But to catch a glimpse of Madrileño life at a more local plaza, head to Plaza de Olavide, one of Madrid’s most beautiful neighborhood gathering spots.\n\nAnd then of course there is the food. Madrid is a city for eating. From the popular tapas bars on Cava Baja to the more trendy and up and coming ones of Calle de Ibiza and Calle de Pozano to Michelin star restaurants to local markets, where you can taste some of the freshest food Madrid has to offer, it is totally possible to eat your way through Madrid.\n\nSpend a lifetime in Madrid and you will always discover more. Take our advice: make sure to devote ample time to it on your Spain travel itinerary.\n\nMálaga\n\nThe capital city of Málaga province often gets a bad reputation with travelers because of the resorts on the nearby Costa del Sol.\n\nBut Málaga city is one of the best cities in Spain, and contrary to its reputation, very Spanish. And even more so, very Andaluz.\n\nThe second-largest city in Andalucía (and the sixth-largest in Spain) Málaga’s coastal location makes it pleasant year-round. With an upbeat, almost tropical vibe, Málaga has been an inspiration for artists throughout the ages.\n\nPablo Picasso was born here, and to this day the city is great for art-lovers. There are several art museums in Málaga, including (of course) a Picasso museum. Many of the paintings were donated or are on loan by the Picasso family. Visitors are often surprised to find a small branch of the Pompidou center. Housed underneath a colorful glass cube by the port, it features paintings by (mostly) 19th and 20th-century Spanish artists. The Museo de Málaga (museum of Málaga) and Carmen Thyssen museums are even more places to see art in Málaga!\n\nMálaga also has a strong cinematic tradition and is often a filming location for Spanish movies. Antonio Banderas was born in Málaga (and still lives there). His El Camino de los ingleses was shot and directed in his beloved city.\n\nLike many cities in Spain that used to be Moorish-ruled, Málaga also has a great Moorish fortress and castle.\n\nOn the top of the hill rising over the center of town is the castle, Castillo de Gibralfaro. Unfortunately, not much of the castle’s interior was preserved. But you can still walk the grounds and of course, take in the beautiful view of Málaga. For those interested, there is also a small military museum inside.\n\nClimbing up the hill leading up to the castle is the Alcazaba, the old city walls and fortress. Full of beautiful gardens and fountains, head up the path that zig-zags through rows of orange trees, enjoying the colorful vegetation and greenery.\n\nMálaga’s history dates back to the Romans, evident by the Roman theater right at the edge of the historic center.\n\nNearby, in the historic center, facing the Plaza del Obispo is Málaga’s grand Baroque cathedral. Originally a mosque, but like many others, transformed into a place for Catholic worship. The reconstruction took over 200 years, and very little of the original mosque remains.\n\nMálaga’s central market, Mercado Atarazanas is a great spot to buy specialties local to Málaga. The province produces a variety of olive oils as well as sweet wines. Seafood lovers will want to make sure to find a table at a chiringuito, a beachside shack that serves the freshest catch of the day. And look for Málaga staple Ajo Blanco on any menu at most of Málaga’s tapas bars. It’s a cold garlicky soup so refreshing on a summer day.\n\nWith stretches of coastline, Málaga is a great spot to get some beach time. Malagueta is the most popular and most central of the urban beaches. But for fewer crowds, head in either direction. No matter which beach you choose, find a table at a chiringuito (beachside restaurant) and enjoy some of Málaga’s seafood specialties.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t forget to carve out time for Málaga city on your Spain travel itinerary. It really is one of Spain’s biggest surprises.\n\nLooking for more? There are also a plethora of amazing day trips from Málaga.\n\nMérida\n\nMurcia is one of those larger cities in Spain that is not on most visitors’ radars. But that is a shame and we think that it should be.\n\nInland, in a sunny area of Murcia province, this boisterous regional capital is full of local life. Visitors are always charmed by the thick regional accent, which many Spaniards from other parts of Spain have trouble understanding.\n\nThe Cathedral of Murcia, an impressive mixture of Gothic, Baroque, Neoclassic, and Renaissance styles is one of the most architecturally interesting of the Spanish cathedrals.\n\nBut Murcia is best known for its friendly locals and lively lifestyle. The areas between the Ayuntamiento (city hall) and Cathedral area all the way to Plaza Circular are a great place to catch some local vibes. And historically, Plaza de las Flores, where the bars are always full of locals drinking the regional beer, Estrella de Levante, is where the action is centered.\n\nAnd Murcia is a must for culinary lovers. Murcia is one of the hidden and up-and-coming gastronomical capitals of Spain. With so many locally produced specialties, it is no surprise that Murcia is quickly becoming a favorite for foodies\n\nThe best time to visit Murcia is the time around the Tuesday after Easter, when every year the city hosts its annual Bando de la Huerta festival, showcasing traditions from the past while transforming the center into a giant street party.\n\nOurense\n\nIn the green north, Ourense, one of the provincial capitals of the Galicia region, always delights travelers with its charm.\n\nNot as well known as some of the other Galician cities such as Santiago de Compostela (see below), Ourense is located on the Mino river. And perhaps it is one of the only cities in Spain where you can find natural hot springs a stones’ throw from the center such as O Tinteiro and Chavasqueira. So therapeutic and relaxing!\n\nSome of the other top things to do in Ourense include wandering around the pleasant historic center. At the center of it all is the Ourense Cathedral, built in the 12th century. Ourense’s main square, plaza mayor (or praza maior as they say in Gallego) is surrounded by old architecture typical of Galician cities.\n\nGalicia is one of the regions of Spain best known for its food, and you can try so much of it in Ourense. For a small city, the food scene here is quite impressive.\n\nYou can find Galician delights such as seafood from the coastal regions of Galicia, fresh produce, and local meat dishes at any of the tapas bars lining the quaint alleyways. And don’t forget to stop by the Praza de Abastos (the central market) to bring some local delicacies such as cheese and wine from Galicia home with you!\n\nOviedo\n\nSpeaking of the north of Spain and speaking of food, next on our list of the best cities in Spain is Oviedo. The region just east of Galicia, Asturias has a unique culture, beautiful landscapes, a culinary tradition of its own. And the capital city, Oviedo is at the center of it all.\n\nOviedo’s historic center is lively and charming. Full of colorful buildings, oh and with a cathedral originally constructed in the 9th century, it is no wonder why people fall in love with Oviedo’s old town.\n\nOviedo is rich in history, dating back to the pre-historic era found in cave art. To learn more about all of this, be sure to visit the city’s archeology museum, housed in an old monastery.\n\nLike the rest of the north, Asturias has a deep culinary tradition. Here you will find some of the heartiest foods in Spain. Heavy on beef, stews, cheeses, and seafood, the best place to try some of Asturias’ specialties is at the restaurants that line Calle Gascona. The menus are extensive, and the portions tend to be huge, so go on an empty stomach.\n\nPay close attention to how they traditionally pour the Sidra (hard cider), made from apples from the woods of Asturias. All proper Asturian meals are accompanied by several bottles of this crisp drink!\n\nThe biggest surprise in Oviedo is discovering the pre-Romanesque temples in the hills just outside of town. Travel back to the dark ages at the churches of Santa María del Naranco and San Julián de los Prado, which are so unique to Oviedo and this part of Spain.\n\nIf you grew up reading the Argentine comic Mafalda, you will be delighted to find a sculpture of the heroine herself in the Parque de San Francisco.\n\nAnd travelers will want to have their photo taken by the Estatua del Viajero (statue of the traveler), the outdoor sculpture in Plaza de Porlier. Oviedo is a favorite of travelers and the sculpture solidifies that!\n\nPalma de Mallorca\n\nPalma de Mallorca is one of the cities in Spain that is located on an island. Mallorca is the biggest of the Balearic Islands in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nMuch more than just a resort city on an Island, Palma de Mallorca is packed with history. Right away visitors will notice the cathedral, one of the city’s most well-known landmarks. The interior was designed by Antoni Gaudí along with famous contemporary Spanish artist Miquel Barceló. The views from the cathedral’s rooftop are well-worth the effort to climb up.\n\nJust across from the cathedral is another of the top things to do in Palma de Mallorca, is the Palau de l'Almudaina (the royal palace). It was originally a Moorish fort, and there are many remnants of the Moorish-style architecture. Later it was converted to a palace for Mallorcan royals. On occasion, the Spanish royal family drops in on their palace in Mallorca, but when they’re not using it, the palace is open to the public.\n\nBe sure to visit the castle, Castell de Bellver, one of Europe’s only circular castles. And spend time wandering through Palma de Mallorca’s historic center.\n\nThe city has a well-preserved Judería, making it one of the best cities in Spain to see its Sephardic heritage.

And when you do, be sure to get some city time in Palma de Mallorca.\n\nSalamanca\n\nSalamanca is a lively university city with a youthful and fun vibe. The capital city of Salamanca province in Castilla y León, it has been described as magical. And it is no wonder. Especially if you are lucky enough to see all of the monuments lit up at night.\n\nSalamanca has two cathedrals, Catedral Vieja, the old one and la Nueva, “new” one. And by “new” we mean construction started on it in the 1500s. La Nueva is a huge Gothic-style cathedral that you can not miss as it dominates Salamanca’s historic center. Adjacent to it is Catedral Vieja, which is one of the best examples of Romanesque architecture in Spain. Make sure to check out the views from the bell tower in La Nueva.\n\nAsk many Spaniards, and they will tell you that Salamanca has the most beautiful plaza mayor in all of Spain.

Legend has it that if you spot it, you will have good luck, especially academically, for years to come.\n\nSalamanca also has a notable art deco and art nouveau museum that is housed in a modernista style building.

Ask any foodie to name their favorite cities; San Sebastián without a doubt makes that list.\n\nSan Sebastián is also one of the most beautiful cities in Spain. Its seafront location and quaint historic center, with street names in the Basque language, give it a feel unlike nowhere else in Spain. Food is the center of life here, and everywhere you turn this is evident.\n\nCome on an empty stomach. For starters you will want to make sure to get your full of pintxos, Basque “tapas” that are much larger, filling, packed with local ingredients, and usually held together by a stick. Save all of those sticks as you sample all of the varieties at any local bar. In the end, the bill will be determined by the number of sticks.\n\nSan Sebastían also has some of the most Michelin-starred restaurants in the world! You will need to book a table at some of the more popular ones like Arzak months out.
