        "text": "What to see and do in Zaragoza\n\n1. Visit the Sprawling Basilica del Pilar\n\nThe Basilica del Pilar is Zaragoza’s most famous monument, a baroque masterpiece that dominates the city’s skyline. It’s believed to be the place where the Virgin Mary appeared to the Apostle James on a jasper pillar in the year 40 CE, so this is quite an important religious site in Spain. Inside the basilica you can still see the pillar, which has been surrounded by different chapels and churches built throughout the city’s history.\n\nThe basilica’s interior features beautiful, colorful domes, elaborate sculptures, and paintings by famous artists. It’s also worth taking the elevator to the top of the basilica’s tower from where you can enjoy outstanding views over the city and river.\n\n2. Discover the City’s Moorish Past at the Aljafería Palace\n\nOutside of Andalucia, Zaragoza is home to some of Spain’s most impressive Moorish architecture. By far the best example in Zaragoza is the Aljafería Palace, originally built as a fortress and residence for the Muslim rulers of Zaragoza in the 11th century.\n\nThe palace has witnessed many historical events and has been the seat of Aragón’s regional parliament since 1987.\n\n3. Admire Mudejar Architecture at La Seo Cathedral\n\nZaragoza is also a center of Mudejar architecture, which is a style of art and architecture that incorporates classic Muslim details with the dominant European styles that emerged during the 12th century and onwards.\n\nIt’s a style that developed in Aragon because the Muslims (or Mudejar in Spanish) were allowed to peacefully live here after the Spanish Reconquista, in which the Christians wrested back control of Spain from the Moors.\n\nLa Seo Cathedral is one of the city’s most exquisite examples of Mudejar architecture, with intricate brickwork and colorful ceramics on its exterior. Inside is equally as impressive, and where you’ll also see hints of Gothic style as well as the remnants of its former life as a Roman temple, a Visigoth church, and a mosque.\n\nIts combination of styles and importance as a symbol of peaceful coexistence between religions and culture has made La Seo Cathedral a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n6. Visit The Museum of Zaragoza\n\nAs the long-standing capital of the Kingdom of Aragon, Zaragoza is home to the Kingdom’s treasure trove of archaeological finds and fine arts. Most of it is on display at the Museum of Zaragoza, located in a majestic building that dates to the Hispano-French Exposition of 1908.\n\nHere you can browse impressive collections of Roman mosaics, ethnology, ceramics, and paintings. Among the paintings, the most remarkable are the 19 works by Goya (yes there are more Goya artworks here!) who depicted portraits of nobles, royals, and scenes of everyday life.\n\n7. Prepare a Picnic in the Mercado Central de Zaragoza\n\nThe Mercado Central de Zaragoza is the city’s main public market, housed in a beautiful modernist building designed by the Aragonese architect Félix Navarro Pérez. Inaugurated in 1903, the building itself has been recognized as a National Historic Monument and a Cultural Heritage Site. Under its roof you’ll find a classic Spanish market: stalls overflowing with fresh seafood, meats, cheeses, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nIn short, everything you need to prepare a picnic to take to the nearby Parque Grande, one of the city’s biggest green spaces.\n\n8. Walk over the Puente del Tercer Milenio bridge\n\nThis huge and futuristic bridge was built in 2008 when Zaragoza hosted the 2008 Expo. It crosses the Ebro river, connecting the city’s Actur, Almozara, and Delicias neighborhoods. It’s more than 270 meters long and has separate lanes for both pedestrians and cyclists.\n\n9. Enjoy a Tapas Crawl Through the City Center\n\nTapas in Zaragoza has a reputation in Spain as some of the best in the country, so you’re going to want to spend some time in the city’s many bars sampling the goods. Start in the bustling Plaza del Pilar, a lively square in the heart of the city, where you can enjoy a bite and a drink while admiring the Basilica del Pilar.\n\nFrom here, wind your way through the historic center toward the barrio of El Tubo, a warren of narrow streets where you’ll find the best tapas bars in the city.\n\n11. Join an Origami Workshop at the Museum of Origami\n\nThe Museo Origami is one of Zaragoza’s more unique museums, celebrating the art of folding paper. It’s the first museum of its kind in Europe, showcasing amazing creations of origami artists from around the world. The museum has six galleries of permanent and temporary exhibits where you’ll learn all about the history and culture of origami.\n\nIf you want to try your hand at origami, you can join one of the workshops or classes that the museum offers.\n\n12. Visit Zaragoza’s Man-Made Beach\n\nIt’s a landlocked city, but thanks to a system of careful water filtration and purification of the Ebro River, Zaragoza does in fact have a “beach”. It’s a man-made area of white sand, palm trees, and crystal-clear pools of natural water inside of Parque del Agua Luis Buñuel park, just a bit to the northwest of the city center inside the\n\nReferred to as “Las Piscinas de Zaragoza”, it’s a good choice if you’re visiting during summer and looking for a way to cool off. The surrounding park is also beautiful.\n\nZaragoza is a food lover's paradise, and the kind of place Spanish foodie tourists go for their city breaks. The tapas scene in the city is incredible, and every year in November the city is home to the Zaragoza Tapas Competition, where bars compete for the prize of best tapas in the city.\n\nHere are some great places to grab a bite in town:\n\nEl Tubo\n\nWe’ve already mentioned going for tapas in El Tubo, but it’s so good it’s worth mentioning again. This is the absolute epicenter of tapas in Zaragoza, and home to many of the restaurants below. It’s also perfect for aimless wanderings, turning up your own gems.\n\nCasa Lac\n\nOne of the oldest licensed restaurants in Spain, Casa Lac opened in 1825 and is the place to get your fix of delicious tapas with a healthy dose of regal, Modernist architecture as well.\n\nMéli Melo\n\nFamed for their creative takes on traditional tapas, this is the place to go if you’re keen to squeeze into a bar and stand shoulder to shoulder with the locals. The bar groans under the weight of the tapas displayed on top, and you can expect some very interesting creations – but it’s all delicious.\n\nLos Xarmientos\n\nAragon as a region is rightly famous for their meat dishes, the best of which you can try at this restaurant. Grilled lamb is the specialty, and one of the most emblematic dishes in the region.\n\nLa Miguería\n\nThe word ‘Migas’ is the name of a dish typical to southern Spain, where breadcrumbs are fried in a pan with whatever else is on hand; usually red peppers, chunks of meat, garlic, eggs, and other items. This restaurant serves around thirty different variations of Migas, which means you can easily find something to your liking."
