        "text": "Best day trips from Zaragoza\n\nIf you‚Äôve already done the best things to do in Zaragoza and feel like going on a day trip, check out one (or more) of the following locations nearby and enjoy some peace and quiet. I‚Äôm confident that none of these trips will let you down.\n\n1. Monasterio de Piedra (Stone Monastery), one of the best day trips from Zaragoza\n\nIf you want to escape from the city and enjoy a natural environment, I recommend you visit the Monasterio de Piedra, a place where every Ma√±o goes at least once in his life. The Monasterio de Piedra is divided into two areas: on the one hand, the monastery, and on the other hand, the park. In the park area, you can walk along paths and trails while crossing waterfalls, lakes, streams and caves.\n\nSome of the most incredible places to see in the Monasterio de Piedra park are the Ba√±o de Diana, La Caprichosa Waterfall, the Gruta y Cascada Iris, the Cola de Caballo, the Pe√±a del Diablo and the Lago del Espejo. Touring the 13th-century monastery while learning about its history is another must.\n\nInside the Monasterio de Piedra you will find the hotel Monasterio de Piedra and two restaurants (Restaurante reyes de Arag√≥n and Restaurante Piedra Vieja). Other options where to stay are Nu√©valos, just 5 minutes away, or Calatayud, half an hour by car.\n\nThe entrance fee is 17,10‚Ç¨ for adults (12‚Äì64 years old) or 12‚Ç¨ for children (4‚Äì11 years old) and seniors (+65 years old). You can buy tickets to the Monastery of Rueda here.\n\nFrom Zaragoza, it takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes by car.\n\nüöó Do you need to rent a car to explore the surroundings of Zaragoza? I suggest you to compare prices at Auto Europe and Discover Cars, two useful platforms to find the best rental deals.\n\n2. Visit Sos del Rey Catolico, the most beautiful town near Zaragoza\n\nIf you feel like going on a rural day trip, I recommend you visit Sos del Rey Cat√≥lico, the most charming village in Zaragoza and one of the most beautiful in Aragon. It has a total population of less than 600 inhabitants and is located about 125 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital. It takes about an hour and a half by car from Zaragoza.\n\nEnjoy getting lost in the steep cobblestone streets within the walled area. Be sure to visit the castle, the Parador, the Ermita de Santa Lucia, the Parroquia de San Esteban, the Monasterio De Nuestra Se√±ora De Valentu√±ana, the Plaza de la Villa, the Palacio del Ni√±o or the Palacio de Sada (the house where Fernando el Cat√≥lico was born).\n\nIf you want to spend the night in this beautiful town, don‚Äôt miss all the hotels in Sos del Rey Cat√≥lico available on Booking. This way, you will also have time to visit Uncastillo, another beautiful village in the area.\n\n3. Loarre castle, a trip to the past\n\nLoarre Castle is located in the municipality of Huesca. It is located just over 100 kilometers north of Zaragoza. By car, it takes about an hour and a half to get there. It is a Romanesque-style castle built in the eleventh century. It is in a very good state of preservation. In fact, it is considered the best-preserved Romanesque fortress in Europe.\n\nThe castle is enclosed by an 11-tower wall and rests on limestone rocks used as foundations. You can explore the interior passageways and stop at locations like the Santa Quiteria Crypt, the Church of San Pedro, the Torre de la Reina, and the Torre del Homenaje. The stunning views that can be enjoyed from the castle are another one of its advantages.\n\nAdmission is 6 euros (8 euros if purchased with a guided tour); 5.50 euros for those under 26 with a student card or youth card; groups of more than 20 people; and senior citizens (7 euros if purchased with a guided tour); 4.5 euros for children from 6 to 16 years (6 euros if purchased with a guided tour); and free for children under 6 years.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of your visit to Loarre Castle to learn more about the province of Huesca, do not miss these 13 essential things to see and do in Huesca (available soon). If you want to spend the night near the castle, you can stay in one of the hotels in Loarre.\n\n4. Visit to Alquezar and its walkways\n\nAlquezar is another of the most beautiful villages in Spain. Like Loarre Castle, it is located in the province of Huesca, 131 kilometers northeast of Zaragoza. By car, it takes approximately 2 hours to get there from the Aragonese capital. Alqu√©zar is a small village of about 300 inhabitants whose houses are stacked and built with materials such as brick, ashlar, and rammed earth.\n\nGet lost strolling through its streets. You will find the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria la Mayor, the Hermitage of Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves and the Church of San Miguel. To enjoy beautiful views of Alqu√©zar, you can go to the viewpoint of Sonrisa del Viento.\n\nOne of the most popular activities to do in Alquezar is to walk along the footbridges. These walkways are located on the cliffs of the Vero River and will make you enjoy the beautiful scenery of the canyon of the Sierra de Guara.\n\nIf you want to spend the night in Alquezar, take a look at the hotels in Alquezar available on Booking.\n\nüè• Remember it is very important to purchase travel insurance for Spain if you don‚Äôt have medical coverage in this country. I always use and recommend the company Heymondo, where I can offer you a 5% discount on your travel insurance.\n\n5. Day trip to Belchite Viejo, a ghost town\n\nAnother excursion near Zaragoza that you cannot miss is Belchite, scene of one of the many battles of the Spanish Civil War. It is located 50 kilometers south of the capital and takes about 40 minutes by car. If you only have two days in Zaragoza, it is a good option, as it does not take that long to get there.\n\nThe village was totally destroyed during the Battle of Belchite. After the war, instead of rebuilding the village, a new one was built right next to it, leaving its remains abandoned. Remains that make you travel back in time, feel the wounds of war and remember what should never happen again.\n\nVisits to Belchite are guided and cost 8‚Ç¨ (day visit), 12‚Ç¨ (night visit), or 14‚Ç¨ (combination of day and night visit). You can book your visit to Belchite here. If you want to stay in Belchite, check out these hotels in Belchite.\n\n6. Panticosa, the perfect place to engage in adventure sports\n\nOne of the day trips from Zaragoza that is very worthwhile is Panticosa, a small town located in the north of Huesca, from which you can do endless outdoor activities and enjoy the Tena Valley. It is located 153 kilometers from Zaragoza and takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get there.\n\nFrom Panticosa, there are numerous hiking trails, a good way to get to know the fauna and flora of this beautiful area of the Aragonese Pyrenees. Some of the most recommended routes are Camino de la Acequia, La Cucuraza, La Ripera, or Las Palizas.\n\nThere are also mountain hiking routes: Garmo Negro, Ibon de Brazato, Ibon de Bachima√±a, Ib√≥n de Ordicuso, or Picos del Infierno (expert level). On the other hand, you can also go rock climbing or mountain biking.\n\nIf you feel like having a much more peaceful plan, you can spend the day (or several days) at the Panticosa Spa and enjoy its facilities. If you want to spend the night, check out all the hotels in Panticosa available on Booking.\n\n7. Albarracin, one of the best places to visit near Zaragoza\n\nAlbarracin is not only the most beautiful town in Teruel but also one of the most beautiful towns in Spain. It is not exactly close to Zaragoza, since it is 2 hours away by car, but if you have the opportunity to visit this beautiful town, I would not hesitate to do so.\n\nWhen you arrive in Albarracin, you will find a medieval village with steep streets and a beautiful natural environment. If you do not want to miss any detail of the town, you can take a guided tour of Albarracin. Another option is to let yourself get lost in its streets and discover all its surprises at your own pace.\n\nSome of the places you cannot miss are the Alcazar of Albarracin, the wall, the Cathedral of Salvador de Albarracin and Casa de la Julianeta.\n\nCheck out the hotels in Albarracin still available if you want to spend the night there.\n\n8. Aguarales de Valpalmas, a nature artwork\n\nIf you want to get to know a very different natural site, I recommend you visit Aguarales de Valpalmas, located in Valpalmas, a municipality located less than an hour north of Zaragoza. This place stands out for its curious geological formations, caused by water erosion in clay soil.\n\nYou can access the Aguarales de Valpalmas through a trail located between town and Piedratajada. Once you arrive, you can walk along a path while observing the different shapes. You will love it!\n\nüí≥ To get cash in the local currency of your destination or pay by card, I recommend getting the N26 card. With the free version you can withdraw cash from ATMs with a very low commission and pay in another currency with the best exchange rate and no commissions.\n\n9. Aguallueve de Anento, a different kind of day trip from Zaragoza\n\nIf you like charming villages and nature, one of the best day trips from Zaragoza is visiting Anento. Here you will find one of the most beautiful villages in Zaragoza (do not miss the Church of San Blas and the castle) and also a charming natural corner known as Aguallueve de Anento.\n\nIt is a set of springs that have created an incredible karst relief. You can discover it on a 2.5-kilometer circular path that starts at the tourist office. The route is well signposted and simple.\n\n10. Tarazona, another amazing place to visit from Zaragoza\n\nThe town of Tarazona concludes this list of day trips from Zaragoza. It is a town located an hour‚Äôs drive west of the capital. Tarazona is very close to the Moncayo Natural Park, which you can also visit. This Aragonese town stands out for its cultural heritage and for having a history of more than 2,000 years.\n\nThe Cathedral of Nuestra Seora de la Huerta is a must-see when in this town; it is stunning! Don‚Äôt forget to visit the Town Hall, Episcopal Palace, Plaza Mayor, and Church of Maria Magdalena. You‚Äôll enjoy taking a stroll through the Jewish neighborhood.\n\nIf you want to spend the night in the area, check out all the hotels in Tarazona that are still available.\n\nMap of day trips from Zaragoza\n\nIn the following map, I have marked all the places near Zaragoza mentioned in this article, so you can quickly see the distance between the capital and each of the destinations.\n\nIf you still don‚Äôt have a place to stay for your trip, don‚Äôt miss my post on where to stay in Zaragoza.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss my Spain travel guide if you are going to visit more areas of the country.\n\nI hope this article about the best day trips from Zaragoza has been very useful for you when planning your trip to the Aragonese capital.
