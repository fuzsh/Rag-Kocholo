        "text": "Written by Lisa Alexander\n\nUpdated Dec 22, 2023\n\nWe may earn a commission from affiliate links ( )\n\nA treasure trove of historical and cultural attractions awaits your discovery in Zaragoza. You will find well-preserved archaeological sites, the first Marian church in Christendom, and fabulous art museums.\n\nIf ancient Roman history fascinates you, then head to the city's archaeological sites. You can follow the \"Caesaraugusta Route\" to find the forum, thermal baths, and theater of the 1st- to 2nd-century Roman town (named after Emperor Augustus) that once flourished here.\n\nThe city is most renowned for its Baroque architecture, in particular the Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar. This splendid monument is one of the most important pilgrimage churches in Spain.\n\nEqually fascinating are the 12th-century Moorish palace and the UNESCO-listed Mudéjar architecture of San Pablo, Santa Maria Magdalena, and San Juan de los Panetes churches.\n\nAlso on the list of must-see destinations are several museums. The city boasts collections devoted to tapestries, contemporary art, and the works of Francisco de Goya.\n\nLearn about the best places to visit with our list of the top attractions and things to do in Zaragoza.\n\nSee also: Where to Stay in Zaragoza\n\n1. Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar\n\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar is the city's most iconic landmark. This gem of Baroque architecture dates to the 17th and 18th centuries and is classified as a National Monument.\n\nGracing the banks of the Ebro River, the basilica looks most impressive from across the river. The entrance is on the other side at the Plaza del Pilar, a spacious town square lined with elegant historical buildings.\n\nTake time to admire the basilica's monumental exterior. Then enter the awe-inspiring interior, which holds a precious object of veneration.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, pilgrims have journeyed here to honor an image of the Virgin Mary and the Sagrada Columna (Sacred Column), a pillar of jasper stone that is associated with a Marian apparition.\n\nAccording to the legend, Saint James the Apostle came to Caesaraugusta where he had a vision of the Virgin Mary, instructing him to build a church here. Saint James built a small chapel dedicated to Saint Mary on this spot, making it the first Marian shrine in Christendom.\n\nSeveral other churches were later built on the site; however, the present basilica is still devoted to the Virgen del Pilar (Our Lady of Pilar). A figure of the Virgin stands behind a mantelpiece. This icon is taken out and presented to the faithful every year on January 2nd, commemorating the date when the Virgin appeared.\n\nThe other sacred object, the Sagrada Columna (also known as \"El Pilar\") is now adorned with fanciful silver plating. Other valuable religious artworks and lavish Baroque monuments are found throughout the basilica, including the alabaster high altarpiece and the frescoes by Goya.\n\nAddress: Plaza del Pilar, Zaragoza\n\n2. Museo del Foro de Caesaraugusta\n\nThe Museo del Foro de Caesaraugusta (Museum of the Roman Forum of Caesaraugusta) provides a glimpse into the life of Caesaraugusta, an ancient Roman colony (town) of the 1st and 2nd centuries that once occupied present-day Zaragoza.\n\nNamed after Emperor Augustus who founded the town, Caesaraugusta was known for its splendors. The city had a theater, public baths, and a marvelous forum at the center of town life.\n\nThe museum stands on the site of the archaeological excavations of the Caesaraugusta forum, underneath the Plaza de La Seo. On display are remains of the Roman Forum that dates back to the era of Emperor Tiberius.\n\nYou will see artifacts that represent elements of the ancient Roman market, walls of shops, pipes, and a sewer system, as well as government buildings and a temple. The exhibits are complemented by educational information and an interesting audio-visual presentation.\n\nAddress: 2 Plaza de la Seo, Zaragoza\n\n3. Catedral de Zaragoza\n\nThe Catedral de Zaragoza is known as Catedral de San Salvador or Catedral de La Seo or simply La Seo. Dedicated to Saint Salvador, this enormous church features five naves. Its melange of architectural styles reveal the town's complex history.\n\nThe cathedral was built on the site of the ancient Roman temple of the Forum, which became a Visigoth church and then a large Muslim mosque during the Moorish era. In the 12th century, the building was converted into a church.\n\nRomanesque elements of the original 12th-century structure are seen in the exquisitely sculpted arcades on the exterior of the apses. The old mosque's minaret is the present cathedral's tower. A Moorish influence is also evident in the chancel and in some of the archways.\n\nThe choir is Gothic in style, while the Capilla del Santo Cristo is a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. Adding to the architectural melange are the Neoclassical facade and Baroque details on the tower.\n\nIn addition to its treasures of religious art in the sanctuary, the cathedral has a noteworthy Tapestry Museum (Museo de Tapices). The collection contains over 60 precious Flemish tapestries of the 15th century.\n\nThe cathedral welcomes tourists for cultural visits. The price of admission includes entrance to both the cathedral and the Tapestry Museum.\n\nAddress: Plaza de la Seo, Zaragoza\n\n4. Palacio de la Aljafería\n\nIn the heart of Zaragoza, the Aljafería Palace is an 11th-century Moorish fortress. Today, the Palacio de la Aljafería houses the headquarters of the Aragonese Parliament.\n\nTake a moment to admire the impressive architecture and fortifications. You will marvel over the formidable defense walls that feature immense crenelated towers. All of the towers are round except for a single rectangular tower, the 9th-century Torre del Trovador (Troubadour's Tower).\n\nWithin the fortress walls are three distinct palaces: the Moorish Al-Muqtadir Palace with a splendid Islamic-style garden courtyard; the 14th-century Palace of Pedro IV featuring exquisite Mudéjar coffered ceilings and plasterwork ornamentation; and the 15th-century Palacio de Los Reyes Católicos (Palace of the Catholic Monarchs).\n\nThe palace is open to the public for visits, and guided tours are available.\n\nAddress: Calle de los Diputados, Zaragoza\n\n5.

Among its major residents are Arapaima, the third-largest freshwater fish in the world; the ecologically important Pacú; and the endangered Malay shark.\n\nThe Nile exhibit's stars include freshwater pufferfish and the Nile crocodile, and Amazon species include iguana and the pygmy titi monkey.\n\nAddress: Avenida de José Atarés, Zaragoza\n\n6.

Iglesia de San Pablo de Zaragoza\n\nThe Iglesia de San Pablo de Zaragoza is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its exceptional Aragon Mudéjar architecture.\n\nThe church was built in the 13th and 14th centuries to replace a small Romanesque chapel, then located on the outskirts of the town. With its single nave and vaulted ceilings, the interior has a sense of spaciousness. Chapels between the buttresses display exquisite works of art.\n\nDuring the 15th and 18th centuries, the church was further enhanced and enlarged. A must-see piece of the Renaissance period is the main altarpiece devoted to Saint Paul, crafted from gilded wood by sculptor Damián Forment in 1515.\n\nThe most noteworthy feature of this monument is its magnificent octagonal Mudéjar tower featuring exceptional Moorish design details.\n\nAddress: 42 Calle San Pablo, Zaragoza\n\n8. La Lonja de Zaragoza\n\nThis splendid 16th-century building stands on the grand Plaza del Pilar, across from the basilica.

The building, constructed in brick, features a rectangular plan and a decorative facade with rows of uniform arched windows and depictions of the kings of Aragón in medallions.\n\nThe interior features a series of stone columns, which were sculpted from the remains of the city's former Roman walls.

The church features a remarkable Plateresque facade, which is considered a jewel of Aragonese Renaissance architecture.\n\nThe facade is almost like an altar with its elaborate reliefs, medallions, and sculptures of various characters and saints. Four niches at the sides represent the parents of the Western Church. The upper niches feature the Virgin of the Holy Mass and King Ferdinand, patron of the church.\n\nThe crypt houses Paleo-Christian (early Christian) tombs of the 4th century.

Museo de las Termas Públicas de Caesaraugusta\n\nThe thermal baths (dating to the 1st century CE) of Caesaraugusta were an important center of social life for the ancient Romans. More than just a place to visit for bathing, the public baths brought people together to play sports, read, and listen to music or poetry.\n\nTypical of public baths found in the ancient Roman empire, the facilities included hot-water and cold-water baths. Bathers could alternate between the two baths, but most started with hot and then finished with cold.\n\nMen and women were separated in different areas of the baths, or used them at different times. The city of Caesaraugusta was well supplied with fresh water and managed the maintenance of the baths.\n\nToday, you can explore the history of Caesaraugusta's baths and see some of the remains at the Museo de las Termas Públicas de Caesaraugusta (Museum of the Public Baths of Caesaraugusta). The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday.\n\nAddress: 3 - 7 Calle San Juan y San Pedro, Zaragoza\n\n15. Iglesia de Santa Maria Magdalena\n\nThe Iglesia de Santa Maria Magdalena stands on the site of an old Moorish mosque. The original 12th-century Romanesque church (that replaced the mosque) was renovated in the 14th century and updated in the 17th century with Baroque details.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the Saint Mary Magdalen Church is the tower, characteristic of Aragonese Mudéjar architecture; the ornamental geometric patterns mimic an Almohad-style minaret. Motifs of decorative glazed ceramics add to the Moorish look.\n\nThe interior features an unusual apse with overlapped arches and pointed windows, also typical of Mudéjar style. The main altarpiece is adorned with 18th-century sculptures and images by Jose Ramirez de Arellano.\n\nThe church is open to the public for visits (with an admission fee), and guided tours are available.\n\nAddress: Plaza de la Magdalena, Zaragoza\n\n16. Iglesia de San Juan de los Panetes\n\nAnother lovely Mudéjar church, the Iglesia de San Juan de los Panetes is found between the ancient Roman walls and the Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar.\n\nThe church was completed in 1725, replacing the Romanesque church of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. The austere Baroque facade features an image of San Juan Bautista and pilasters on the sides.\n\nLike Santa Maria Magdalena, the most notable feature of this church is the Mudéjar tower. Its octagonal brick tower with arched windows recalls classic Moorish architecture. The interior offers an inspiring sense of spaciousness with its barrel vaulting and cupola on the crossing.\n\nThe church is open to the public for visits (free admission) every day. Mass is celebrated here on Sundays at 11am.\n\nAddress: 3 Calle Salduba, Zaragoza\n\n17.
