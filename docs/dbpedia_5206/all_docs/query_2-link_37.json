        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe coexistence of multiple chronic conditions in an individual, i.e., multi-morbidity (1), causes significant direct and indirect costs to individuals, households, and society at large (2), and can affect everyday life. The public health sector faces the challenge of mitigating the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), a challenge that becomes increasingly threatening when multi-morbidity -the most common chronic condition today- enters the equation (3, 4). NCDs and their different modalities of multi-morbidity, are among the leading causes of premature death worldwide, being more prevalent in disadvantaged communities, thus magnifying health inequalities (5, 6).\n\nTo guide health systems in the prevention and control of NCDs, attention to the living environment and its associated risk factors is critical. The so-called Social Determinants of Health (SDH) (7) are among the most widespread frameworks that incorporate the circumstances in which people live and grow up in prevalence assessments. According to Bhattacharya et al. (8), the underlying causes of NCDs at the community level should be considered as a “collateral damage” from the interaction between SDH at different levels, including individual characteristics (genetics, age, gender, ethnicity) and choices (habits and lifestyles), living circumstances (socioeconomic status, SES), geographical settings (rural or urban environments), but also the macroeconomic and political backgrounds, along with other overarching forces.\n\nWhen specifically addressing multi-morbidity, the sociodemographic structure has been highlighted as a key determinant, identifying the elderly, female, and socioeconomically deprived people as those particularly vulnerable to chronic conditions and multi-morbidity (9–12). These conditions, along with individual lifestyles and metabolic risk factors, often promote (among other conditions) hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus (13). These two NCDs are currently in the spotlight due to their increasing burden worldwide −422 and 1,278 million for diabetes and hypertension in 2014 and 2019, respectively (14, 15), as one of the most frequent modes of multi-morbidity (16, 17) fostered by their considerable overlap in terms of risk factors (18, 19).\n\nThere is a large body of literature devoted to multi-morbidity following a variety of approaches. For example, Johnston et al. (20) addressed the definition and measurement of multi-morbidity; Prados-Torres et al. (21) and Rajoo et al. (22) identified the most common patterns of disease association; Violán et al. (23) highlighted the importance of socioeconomic status as an aggravating factor in multi-morbidity; and Uthman et al. (13) explored the levels of vulnerability between urban and rural settings. However, the afore mentioned studies were conducted at the individual level, largely disregarding the social environment. This is also the case of the conjoint studies on hypertension and diabetes conducted in Spain. Zubeldia Lauzurica et al. (24) found that overweight and diabetes doubled the probability of developing hypertension in a population-based cross-sectional study in Valencia. Menéndez et al. (25) identified a higher prevalence of hypertension among prediabetics and diabetics in a sample of the Spanish population. The serial cross-sectional study from 2003 to 2009 conducted in several Primary Care Centers in Madrid (26) reported that patients with type 2 diabetes who also suffered from hypertension increased from 89.78% in 2003 to 94.76% in 2009, this percentage being higher for women and for patients older than 65 years. Urrutia et al. (27) in a cohort study on risk factors for diabetes in the Basque Country found associations in the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, family history of diabetes and low educational level. Ramón-Arbués et al. (28) identified significant associations between overweight and obesity and the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome in a sample of 23.729 workers in Aragon.\n\nThis study offers an ecological perspective that adds to what is known by incorporating the spatial perspective. We analyze the influence of the social and demographic spheres of the SDH on hypertension-diabetes multi-morbidity at the community level under the premise that disadvantaged communities are more likely to attain a higher prevalence of both diseases, although this link is not necessarily equally strong everywhere. Therefore, our objectives were to (i) determine the extent to which spatial patterns of hypertension and diabetes prevalence overlap (referred to as “multi-morbidity”), (ii) determine whether these spatial patterns are related to the sociodemographic factors that explain multi-morbidity and, if so, (iii) investigate possible spatially varying relationships between SDH and multi-morbidity. The methodological framework leverages the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis techniques that have proven to be very useful in the field of epidemiology (29–31). First, we applied Principal Component Analysis to determine the spatial patterns of multi-morbidity and synthesized the main sociodemographic factors into a meaningful indicator. Then, we applied Geographically Weighted Regression [GWR; Fotheringham et al. (32)] to ascertain whether the association between variables shows spatial nuances. In line with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach (33), this broader perspective offered by spatial analysis in health research advances beyond individual factors (34) being particularly useful to support decision making outside the direct remit of the health sector (e.g., territorial planning and health-related policy formulation).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the spatial behavior of the overlapping prevalence of hypertension and diabetes (“referred to as multi-morbidity”) from an ecological perspective. We leveraged a combination of PCA and GWR techniques to generate variables related to multi-morbidity by sex in different years and sociodemographic factors; and analyze whether the relationships between variables (PCs) were stationary across the study area. Our results allowed us to accept the working hypothesis, safely concluding that sociodemographically disadvantaged territories were more likely to suffer a higher burden of multi-morbidity, though this relationship does not necessarily hold elsewhere.\n\nThe prevalence rates of hypertension were, as an average for the period studied (2015–2019), of 20.8 and 23.2% for hypertension and 8.5 and 6.8% for diabetes, male and female, respectively. In the case of hypertension, the percentage exceeds the average for Spain (15.7% -male- and 17.3% -female-), while in diabetes the figures were similar (7.3% male and 6.1% female) (37). In terms of spatial variability, the percentage differences between autonomous communities in Spain are up to 12% in hypertension and 4% for diabetes. The spatial variability observed in Aragón is much higher, with percent differences of up to 25 and 12% for hypertension and diabetes in men, and up to 35 and 13% in women.\n\nThe results indicate that the spatial patterns of population aging, educational level, and income distribution explain the multi-morbidity patterns of hypertension and diabetes to a large extent (average R2 0.75 and 0.87 in male and female models, respectively). These findings are in line with the literature. In the study of Chidumwa et al. (38) about shared risk factors of hypertension and diabetes, the elderly, female and people with lower education and household wealth were associated with higher prevalence. Tirapani and Fernandes (39) concluded on the importance of factors such as income and education impact on the prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, progression, and mortality of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Pandey et al. (40) also found that age and level of education seemed to be associated with comorbid diabetes and hypertension. In Spain, Bennett et al. (41) estimated incidence trends by deprivation for cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes and found higher incidence levels in the most deprived areas. Zghebi et al. (42) found a higher vulnerability of comorbidity of diabetes in women, the elderly and the most deprived.\n\nBut the GWR analysis emphasized the non-stationary behavior in terms of explanatory power and influence of the sociodemographic factors. Previous studies modeling the relationships between these diseases and socioeconomic risk factors through GWR techniques have also found regional variations. Ogunsakin (43) revealed that educational status had different effects across provinces of South Africa when investigating diabetes and hypertension. Park et al. (44) addressed the hypertensive disease mortality in South Korea and found that the effects of socioeconomic status were only consistent in some regions of the country. Hipp and Chalise (45) and Quiñones et al. (46) found that indicators such as poverty were associated with diabetes in some regions in the United States. In Europe, Kauhl et al. (47) found spatially varying strength of the association between demographic variables and hypertension, and concluded that persons aging in deprived areas in Northeastern Germany will be at greater risk of hypertension. These authors also found that the strength of the association between diabetes mellitus and socio-demographic variables such as age and employment conditions displayed strong regional variations (48). The spatially-varying nature of the relationships has implications beyond the mere variability, since different intensities of the relationship relate to higher influence of the socioeconomic environment; therefore, more susceptible to be the priority target of public health policies and regulations. In this sense, we observed that the strength of the observed relationships was sharper in men’s prevalence, while women’s models attained more spatially homogeneous and with higher explanatory performance. From this we may deduce that if sociodemographic disadvantages increased in Aragonese regions, the prevalence of multi-morbidity of hypertension and diabetes in women would be more likely to increase in a wider part of the autonomous community, while in certain regions men’s prevalence would be more prone. In the case of men, the vulnerability would be high in northwestern areas. Although these results deserve to be contrasted with individual-level studies concerning differences between sexes, they are in line with the statements of the Spanish Ministry of Health in the Clinical Indicators in Primary Care in Spain report: the social gradient in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes is more pronounced in women (37).\n\nHowever, several considerations need to be addressed to properly contextualize our findings. This study stems from data sources with differences in terms of spatial aggregation and time frame. For example, the demographic structure and income indicators were reasonably up-to-date but information on the educational level comes from the last Spanish Population Census published in 2011. Likewise, in studies such as this one, in which the territorial organization of the health system is based on areas grouping several municipalities in some cases, and segregating them into census tracts in others, the broad change in scale may hinder the relationships, though the GWR approach overcomes that limitation to some extent. But devising specific, methodological protocols for urban BHAs, for which more detailed sources of information (e.g., neighborhood, block, or building) are often available, would be preferable. The research by de Cos Guerra (49) on methodological alternatives and sources of information to study residential vulnerability at the intraurban level exemplifies this line of reflection. It would also be of interest to take advantage of European initiatives such as Urban Audit (50) to generate databases and develop comparative studies between European cities.\n\nAnother consideration to be accounted for was the absence of other spheres of HD in our analysis. Hypertension and diabetes, and in general terms most chronic conditions, are associated with unhealthy and irregular dietary and sleeping patterns, stressful lifestyles, sedentarism and alcohol and tobacco consumption (51, 52). However, this information is not generally available at the population-level and therefore can hardly be incorporated in ecological studies. In this context we believe it is relevant to combine the results of studies conducted at both individual and population level. In Aragon, the opportunity would come from the EpiChron Cohort of Prados-Torres et al. (53), a database that integrates clinical, sociodemographic, and medical practice information of all inhabitants registered as users of the public health system in Aragon since 2011. Likewise, it would be interesting to incorporate other diseases into the multi-morbidity pattern analysis (e.g., obesity), as they have already been conducted in Aragon by Abad-Díez et al. (54) and Ramón-Arbués et al. (28).\n\nFuture lines of development shall focus on incorporating indicators related to the organizational structure of the health system, paying attention to the availability of diagnostic resources and the Variations in Medical Practice (VMP). The behavior of these factors could condition the existence of situations of under-diagnosis of these diseases, which in fact has already been observed in previous studies in Spain. Catalá-López et al. (55) published a systematic review and meta-analysis about the control of arterial hypertension in Spain and concluded that the control of hypertension is far from optimum and that patients at risk with comorbidities appear to be controlled worse. de Burgos-Lunar et al. (26) estimated in their study population a 30% of patients with type 2 diabetes suffering previously undiagnosed hypertension in 2003, and 23.1% in 2009. In the case of Menéndez et al. (25), undiagnosed hypertension was identified in 37.4% of patients. Tamayo-Marco et al. (56) reported a proportion of unknown cases of diabetes nearly 50% in their Aragonese sample population. It is also worth mentioning that, in the specific case of Aragon, there has also been talk of under-diagnosis of other NCDs such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (57) and depression (58). Regarding the VMP, in Spain there are previous initiatives such as the Atlas of VMP in the Spanish National Health System (59). One of the lines of work of this atlas has translated in the Atlas of diabetes health care in Aragon, in which vulnerability profiles of diabetes by sex, age (from 40 years and older) and SES are showed. Indeed, spatial patterns of such vulnerability by SES have been explored, and only in some cases do they correspond to those identified in this work. This could be because the age group to which both studies refer is different. Therefore, it is worth reconsidering for the future whether the associations between prevalence, multi-morbidity and HD vary when stratifying by age groups.\n\nFinally, with respect to spatial analysis techniques, this work has proposed a methodological itinerary based on PCA and GWR that has allowed us to achieve the proposed objectives. However, it is considered relevant to enlarge and contrast the results of the multi-morbidity patterns obtained by PCA with those offered by other spatial techniques such as cluster identification or hot-spot analysis (34, 60). Similarly, it is proposed to extend the time horizon of study to carry out multi-temporal analyses and deepen the scale changes by using the Multi-scale GWR (MGWR) that allows to differentiate local, regional and global processes (61)."
