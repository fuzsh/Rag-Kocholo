        "text": "Iberians, Romans and Muslims\n\nThe iberian settlement of Salduie, that Pliny the Elder identified with Salduvia, it is documented in the second half of the III century B.C. Two centuries later, in the I century B.C, this enclave was conquered by Rome. This was funded in the then Caesaraugusta. The new city was soon converted in the capital of the region. Thanks to that it enjoyed that priviliges such as tax exemption, theaters, and a forum. This was sustained by a rich economy, promoted by it´s river port and its roads.\n\nDuring the final crisis of the Empire, concrete in 472, Caesaraugusta it was taken by the visigoths. Like this, it was incorporated to the Kingdom of Tolosa. In the VII century it converted in one of the most important cultural centers in the labor of diverse subjects. One of them was Braulio, situated among the major intellects of his era.\n\nLater in . 714, Zaragoza was integrated to the caliphate of Córdoba under the name Saraqusta. Past the fall of the Omeyas, 1018, the taifa Kingdom of Zaragoza was set up. With that it also passed to be one of the greatest cultural and commercial center in the Ibérican Península.\n\nEl Cid\n\nThe exiled gentlemen Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, Cid Campeador, served to Zaragozan Kings: Al-Muqtadir and his son Al-Mutaman. He was involved in the betrayal of Rueda of Jalón, this almost cost the life of his ancient Sir Castellano. His spectacular victories motivated the Zaragozans to give the ¨Sidi¨ apellation. ¨Cid¨ is what had happened in past history.\n\nAlfonso I the battler raptured the plaza from the muslims in 1118, converting it into the capital of the Kingdom of Aragón. During centuries, Zaragoza maintained a prosperous community in the Jewish community. This population lived its era of Major Apogee in the XIV and XV centuries. However, upon the need to defend themselves from the inquisition. This promoted a celebrated assessination that would accelerate its expulsion.\n\nAt the end of the XVI century, the fugitive Antonio Pérez, secretary of Philip II, took refugee in Zaragoza taking protection of Juan V of Lanuza. This would be based on the Privilege of Manifestation. This right limited the legal actions of the King of the Aragon territorry. The consequences were tremendous and ended the execution of Juan V of Lanuza and the taking of the city.\n\nThe French\n\nDuring the Independance war, the city suffered the known, “Sites of Zaragoza”. In 1808 the Aragon capital was fences two times by the French troops. His resistance converted it into a symbol of the anti-Napoleon resistance in all of Europe. This was based on the huge diffusion that had diverse engravings about the subject. The main ones are the Zaragoza Ruins, the Brambila and Gálvez, and the Disasters of the War, from Francisco of Goya. This last one masterly immortalized some of those events and their heros.\n\nThe hardness of the Sites, especially from the second, was extreme. Heroic personalities helped sustain the resistance until the 12 of February 1809. In respect to this several figures shine through, such as General Palafox, the popular leader Jorge Ibor and Casamayor (Uncle Jorge), or Agustina of Aragon. In total, almost two-thirds of the maña population during the successes. Another tragic consequence was the patrimonial loss of the “Spanish Florence”.\n\nIn 1908, a century after the first happening, in Zaragoza it was celebrated in a great Hispanic-French Exposition. The intention of closing the wounds from the terrible glory crimes commited. On March 5th 1837, the carlisle troops of General Cabañero attempted to take the Maña Capital. However, they were rejected by volunteers from the city. Annually the ephemeris acts of these are celebrated in the Celebration of the Cincomarzada.\n\nProsperity\n\nWith the arrival of the railway in the city in 1861 and the construction of the North Starion was zoned in Arrabal. This is characterized by the modern construction, ultimately recovered. After this, a new treaty to the city took place. The result was a great advance in its industrialization that brought about rural immigration.\n\nIn the beginning of the XX century, the chard crops and the sugar industry brought a prosperous industrial bourgeoisie. This would support the regeneration of the National League of Producers (1899) and the National Union of Joaquin Costa and Basilio Paraiso (1900). Farther ahead they suffered greatly during the Civil War. In it´s beginning in July of 1963, General Cabanellas picked up a local guarrison against the Government. They accomplished to maintain the city despite the ferocious atack of Anarchist Militias that tried to fence it. In that moment, the bombarded Pilar Basílica was the symbol of resistance for the defenders.\n\nIn 2008, date of the bicentury of the first site and the centennial of the Hispanic-French Exposition, Zaragoza returnes to be part of an International Exposition. With that, came upon a process that has made the capital of Ebro a reference on an economic, turistic, and industrial level."
