        "text": "I guess this might be a bug and might not.\n\nSebastian and my character are presumably happily married, and he's getting his favorite Sashimi every day. Hearts are steady at 14, and they have a little girl. It's very sweet. Nonetheless, twice now he's entered the house while my character has been home and stopped in the doorway, like he's stuck. When approached his dialogue scolds his poor wife that the house is a wreck, and it's not very nice to come home to clutter everywhere, etc. etc.\n\nI am with him; that's super annoying.. but of course, the house looks no messier than it ever does, so whatever, Crankyman.\n\nThing is, the Wiki lists this dialogue as happening when Sebastian's hearts are neutral or so. It seems odd (and feels a little jarring, frankly) for him to downshift into such an accusatory stance at 14 hearts.\n\nHm... Well, there was nothing in his way in either case. Not my character, and not the dog or the baby either (the baby is still in her crib right now, hadn't been born yet the first time it happened). Maybe there's something invisible catching him in the doorway?\n\nBoth times this happened, it was on a Monday after he came home from visiting Robin. Both times my character was in the kitchen area harvesting/refilling wine casks."
