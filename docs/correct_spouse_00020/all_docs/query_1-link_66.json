We think we're gonna keep him. Placenta smoothie anyone?\"\n\nCute. But also: ewwww.\n\nBut we'll forgive him, as Van Houten soon jumped in with her own telling of the story of Monte's arrival in emoji form.\n\nPearce and Van Houten met after working together in 2015 on the Western thriller Brimstone.\n\nThe actor split from childhood sweetheart Kate Mestitz after 18 years of marriage in January 2014.\n\nVan Houten was in a relationship with Dutch director Kees van Nieuwkerk from 2013 till 2015, and previously dated actor Sebastian Koch."
