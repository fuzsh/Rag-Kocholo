Plus, his dialogues are pretty heartfelt, showing how much he appreciates having left his old life in the city.\n\nMore Answers\n\nMarried him in my last playthrough; can confirm Sebastian is husband material. He sends you coffee in the mail (a total win for caffeine lovers) and even though he keeps to himself, the moments you share are genuine and sweet. Plus, he has a cool motorbike.\n\nSebastian? Meh. There are better fish in the Stardew Sea. If you're into the mysterious types, sure go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you when you're left wanting more farm help!\n\nHonestly, it depends on what you're looking for. If you dig the brooding, motorcycle-riding, computer programmer type, then yes, Sebastian is your ideal match in Stardew Valley. However, if you're not into the whole 'lone wolf' vibe, then maybe not."
