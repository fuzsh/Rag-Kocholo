Good.’\n\n\"A big part of why I never wanted to have children was because I helped raise my sister – I have a sister with an intellectual disability – so I felt like I’d done my parenting. For a long time, I definitely knew I was never going to have kids. It was quite definite.\"\n\nOf his relationship with Carice, he added: \"Things changed and we got pregnant quite quickly. Maybe not really planned. Maybe it was a bit of a surprise.”\n\nWhile the 55-year-old actor is \"besotted\" with six-year-old son Monte, he admitted he initially couldn't get his head around the idea he was now a father after the tot was born.\n\nHe added: “And of course, I am just besotted with my child. I mean, it’s ridiculous, although it took a while for me to actually believe that my child was really my child. It’s a sort of slow turning around of the ship.\n\n\"Even though my body was kind of going, ‘You’re my child and I just want to hold you close,’ my brain was going, ‘No, you don’t have a child.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, but I do’. My brain is going, ‘No, you decided years ago you were never going to have a child.’ ”"
