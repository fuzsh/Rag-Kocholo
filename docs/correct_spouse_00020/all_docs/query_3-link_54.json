        "text": "@Jaed not tryin to convert you in this reply but i find this stuff fascinating and i always like to explain things and speculate!! so like... ignore if you want, but your comment springboarded my response so yes\n\nNone of the spouses literally clean, and if you're getting the \"you should clean up\" dialogue, it means something is blocking your spouse's walking path (i.e. they have to walk around some furniture in order to get to their destination) and is more of a mechanical dialogue than a spouse-specific dialogue. There is random dialogue about Sebastian doing chores: he talks about listening to music to make the chores go by faster, and one dialogue tree is him apologizing for forgetting to do something since he loses focus. Not every spouse cooks and some only gift on rainy days as well; Sebastian's quirks involve giving you coffee and bringing you stuff from the mines. Sleeping in bed is something spouses tend to do when they're not in a good mood and is NOT specific to Sebastian-- that has only happened to me once and I'm pretty sure it was when I was still trying to figure out the gifting mechanic while married. Higher affection also makes them more likely to be roaming the house or outside, but I'm pretty sure it's random.\n\nThat being said, yeah, Sebastian is not a \"safe\" bachelor by any means. By not \"safe\", I mean, there is no guarantee that you will love him, since it's not as easy to expect what he'll be like as a spouse. When you marry Elliott, you're probably going to expect poetry and sweet gestures. Marrying Harvey, you're going to get a lot of sweet dialogue sprinkled in medical advice. What about Sebastian? He is not very talkative in the beginning (of friendship) and his personality does not appeal to everyone. When marrying him, do you expect him to continue his basement-y, comic reading and pizza eating ways? The answer is: yes, probably. And he does, but he begins living a much healthier lifestyle and stops worrying about saving up funds to get out of his mom's basement (I'll bring money up again in the next few paragraphs.) He now has the time to do what he wants to do, which he didn't have when multiple people be breathin' down his back, privacy constantly being shattered by friends who willingly interrupt his work time, and a step-father who doesn't respect him enough.\n\nOne of the money comments shows his sense of humor- namely, the \"go make us some money\" one. Sebastian has a kind of humor that not everyone may enjoy, but i freakin love it. He comes across as a prank troll, lulling you into a false sense of security, and then BAM. THE JOKE. U GOT ZINGED. I like to think of the sweet things he says as genuine, but he also likes to lighten the mood and to see people's reactions when he says something they do not expect. Before marrying Sebastian, his pre-Luau dialogue is about how he enjoys seeing the \"structure of society collapse a little\" i.e. he really loves messing with people. And I love it. I think it's hilarious. Sebastian is on-par with Maru's intelligence, but they express it differently- while Maru is very kind and soft and goes on her little technology ventures, Sebastian backs up his own knowledge sprinkled with wit and sarcasm. (extreme speculation warning: ) I also think this behavior is partly because of Daddy Issues(tm) since Demetrius' neglect implies that he probably had to try a little harder than usual to get attention as a kid. As kids' brains often go, doing A Bad Thing gets me attention, so now I will do Many Bad Things. (end speculation) Such behaviors manifested into the enjoyment of people's reactions as he got older. I wouldn't be surprised if a rumor goes around about him that's untrue, and he ends up heavily implying the rumor is real just to freak people out. I will also say though, that Sebastian is rather caring, so his jokes would never go further than completely harmless- back to the Luau comment, he says you should throw something gross in the pot \"as long as you don't poison anyone\". Jokes are funny but there is always a line!\n\nI did notice that Sebastian mentions money quite a few times, which I'm unsure is something other bachelor(ette)s do-- feel free to correct me if it's not the case! There are two phrases I remember though, one of which I've already shown here. The first one is how, thanks to the farmer's income, he can afford to achieve his goals. The other one is asking if they're okay on funds, since he wouldn't want to have to sell his laptop. The first one I expected, and it was very sweet that he was so grateful! The second one made me go \"hmmmm...\" since Sebastian didn't strike me as someone who really worried about money all too much. But after thinking about it, it does make sense. However, I could see how people consider that in more literal ways and that he just wants a lot of money. For me, I see it as just pure worry. Here's why:\n\nLike I stated before, Sebastian is saving up funds to move out of the carpenter shop and (presumably) to the city, away from Pelican Town. He gets his money from freelancing jobs as a programmer, which may pay either a lot or not much at all (it's never specified, and hopping from task to task probably fluctuates pay) and in his 2 heart event, he talks about how he probably could have gone to college, but chose not to for a couple of reasons. Though unstated, I could see one of his reasons for not going to college being the inability to afford it himself, let alone putting that financial burden on his family. (I know those feels so hard right now, so that is more just a guess rather than what I think is actually true for the character). Let's also consider the occupations of his parents. Is there any dialogue that suggests Demetrius gets paid for his studies, or is it merely something he devotes his life to? Robin built the carpenter shop herself and owns the land, but I highly doubt she is rolling in the dough. Living in the mountains (can also relate!) can be tough since it's far away from everything and it's much harder to find a stable job. Robin's career is stable, but how much money do you think she actually made before you, the farmer, came in town? Marnie was probably her best customer, but even then, Marnie has been an established rancher for years on end. Robin's stuck doing small jobs and selling furniture, which probably gives her family just enough to eat. They were most likely pretty broke (I wouldn't be surprised if Maru and Sebastian helped pay for necessities) before you showered Robin in gold and stacks of wood.\n\nLiving like this, which I can confirm, causes children in the family to worry about money and to often sacrifice their own luxuries (such as a laptop) and opportunities for parents' sake. I would have to have other bachelor(ette)s like Maru and Penny to confirm this though. I wouldn't be surprised at all if Maru worried about money in a similar way, and Penny lived in a trailer for crying out loud and was the main source of income while Pam blew it all on beer before she got her bus driving job back. I know pre-marriage she does talk about money issues quite a bit.\n\nso yes, that's my take!\n\nHAHA WHOOPS WENT ON ANOTHER HUGE SPIEL\n\nbut these are so fun. i don't get many opportunities to gush about my favorite characters. i'm glad this thread came back lmao\n\nI think you and I are kindred spirits here. lol Everything you've said I can agree with, 100%. I'm a bit new here, but I've played long enough to recognize and love all of these same traits in Seb. n_n"
