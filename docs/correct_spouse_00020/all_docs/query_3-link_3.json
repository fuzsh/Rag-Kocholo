        "text": "Sebastian is an NPC and one of the marriage candidates who lives in Stardew Valley.\n\nHe lives in the carpenter's shop with his mom Robin, his half-sister Maru, and his stepfather Demetrius. He tends to feel unappreciated compared to his sister, who is regarded highly both by his parents and other villagers. His residence in the shop's basement seems to further isolate him, and it seems he's not a fan of it either, as he often makes the comment \"Maybe my room would be less depressing if I had a window...\".\n\nIf married to the player, he'll often comment the Farm is much more pleasant in comparison. He's not a very social person and expresses in his first heart event that he needs time to himself.\n\nSebastian is good friends with both Sam and Abigail, whom he hangs out with at the Stardrop Saloon on Friday evenings. He often plays billiards against Sam and usually wins. He also plays the keyboard in a band with Sam and eventually convinces him to let Abigail be their drummer.\n\nHe has a bit of a \"emo\" attitude, preferring darkness to the light and having an interest in things most people consider creepy. He's rather philosophical and often ponders death, the purpose of life, etc. It's speculated that he may suffer from depression and social anxiety. He and Sam are both a bit rebellious, but Sebastian's a bit quieter about it.\n\nHe has an interest in science fiction and fantasy and enjoys reading books and graphic novels, as well as programming computer games and playing tabletop role-playing games. He also owns a motorcycle and seems to do maintenance on it semi-frequently. He smokes; at the Stardew Valley Fair, the player can see him holding an orange and white stick to his mouth and breathing out smoke. At the train station on some days you can see him smoke. When you get married to him he gives up smoking but depending on your heart’s with him he can take up smoking again.\n\nSebastian works as a freelance programmer, and expresses frustration that his job not taken seriously by others. He feels discontent in the valley and hopes to leave for the city someday.\n\nFamily[]\n\nRobin\n\n(Mother)\n\nDemetrius\n\n(Stepfather)\n\nMaru\n\n(Half Sister)\n\nGifts[]\n\nLove[]\n\n\"I really love this.

They must choose a class, then go in through the front, defend yourself, enter the hallway to the left, destroy the capsules, and enter the boss battle. Their last choice depends on their class: if they’re a wizard, defend their friends while the wizard is mumbling, if they’re a healer then heal Sebastian, and if they’re a warrior, block him. Cutscene: [3]\n\n8 Hearts: Head to the boardwalk when it’s raining between 12pm and 11pm to trigger a cutscene where Sebastian opens up a bit.

He also confesses his feelings for them. Cutscene: [5]"
