        "text": "Today we take you on a tour inside one of our absolute favourite homes, the family villa of actress Carice van Houten & actor Guy Pearce\n\nInterior Design doesn't get better and bolder than this, in our humble opinion. Naturally, at Love Tree Interiors, we embrace the mix of eclectic designer vintage furniture and a beautifuly curated colour palette on panelled walls and ceilings, the use of vintatge inspired patterned wallpapers (by our favourites House of Hackney & Kelly Werstler), long ceiling to floor curtains in complimentary coloured linens, and matching bold coloured wool floor rugs. The art, the furniture, the colours, the drapery and vintage light fittings all come together like a well orchetrated opera of style and creativity.\n\nInteriors Designers Artlier ND Interiors worked with the Game of Thrones actress Carice van Houten to create the most incredible home.\n\nDutch designer Nicole Dohmen, was born and raised in the southern province of Limburg, before moving in 2000 to Amsterdam where she now lives with her husband and children. After frequently being asked by friends to help them design their homes, and after many years experience rebuilding homes herself, she finally made the switch in 2018 to devote herself full time to interior design. A huge passion for as long as she can remember, has now turned into a successful business.\n\n\"Her style is never boring - warm, personal and always with an edge, she makes every home authentic and personal through her use of colours and prints. With no formal education in interior design, her style has developed from an inherent creativity and a thirst for knowledge which sends her all over the world in search of inspiration. Working in diverse industries like fashion (Diesel & Adidas), The Wall Street Journal and studying photography also contributed to the development of her unique personal style. Constantly curious, and always looking, there is never a dull moment.\"\n\nBack to designing Clarice & Aussie Actor Guy Pearce's home,\n\n‘It’s quite unusual that I have to be the one to tell a client to take it down a notch when it comes to colour’, says Nicole with a bright smile. A wide range of expressive colours is what the interior designer would dub her “love language” – whether bright or muted, none of the places she designs come in merely grey and beige. There’s at least some hint of colour in there.\n\nActress Carice van Houten wanted to go all out on the colour scheme but got lost in all the options. That’s where Atelier ND came in: starting out with the pink polka dot wallpaper by Kelly Wearstler right at the entrance, then jewel shades of lilac, magenta and eggplant. Nicole: ‘The trick is to keep the overall feel well-balanced, and repetition throughout works well that way’.\n\nThough before any sort of painting could commence, the entire structure of the country house had to be redone.\n\nThey went with an open-plan layout and much bigger windows for more light to generously pour in. This canvas gave way to painterly colour combinations, and a mix of pre-loved iconic furntiure pieces by for instance Tobia Scarpa and contemporary \"Dutch art\" by the likes of Sabine Marcelis.\n\nThe result is nothing short of enchanting, and a real reflection of Carice’s personality. ‘That’s what I always hear from friends visiting’, quips the artist: ‘And despite all the colours it’s a real safe haven where we – the actress, her partner Guy Pearce and son Monte – can fully relax and recharge.\"\n\nWe hope this post inspires you with some unique styling take aways you can translate into your own home.\n\nStyling your home should always start from following your instincts. Try choosing some of your favourite items of clothing, especailly the patterned and colourful ones you treasure the most, and place then around your home, draping over your couch, see how the colours and patterns could translate into your walls, floors and windows. This is a helpful tip in understanding how to bring out your own unique personal taste into your home."
