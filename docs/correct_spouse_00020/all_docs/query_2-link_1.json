        "text": "Guy Pearce and Carice van Houten have welcomed their first child.\n\nThe Iron Man 3 actor and the Game of Thrones star have become proud parents to son Monte.\n\nRELATED: Guy Pearce splits from wife\n\nRELATED: Game of Thrones actor reveals he's not interested in the show\n\nTaking to Twitter, the actor wrote: \"A cute little package arrived and told us his name's Monte Pearce. We think we're gonna keep him. Placenta smoothie anyone? @caricevhouten (sic)\"\n\nCarice replied to Guy's tweets with a string of baby related emojis.\n\nThe couple announced Carice's pregnancy in March earlier this year and have been sharing jokes about their upcoming arrival.\n\nQuipping about her Game of Thrones character Melisandre's shadow baby offspring, Carice wrote: \"Yes. It's true. Let the shadow baby jokes begin.\"\n\nTo which Guy joked back: \"Nothing like the prospect of a shadowbaby to change your mind about becoming a Father !! (sic)\"\n\nOn another occasion, Carice joked she \"almost didn't fit in the mirror anymore\" in a selfie whilst also sharing pictures of just some of the motherhood-related gifts she had received.\n\nBefore Guy was dating Carice, the 48-year-old actor was married to psychologist Kate Mestitz for 18 years.\n\nIn a statement released at the time of their split, he said: \"Kate and I will always love and support one another and be the best of friends. No one knows me like Kate does, and we'll forever be appreciative of our mutual respect. We've both grown enormously through our relationship, but sadly, the time has come to part ways.\"\n\nStory by Bang Showbiz, edited by Yahoo7 Be."
