        "text": "The article or section below may contain minor to major plot spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n\"When did I lose sight of what's real?\"\n\n―Sebastian's Character Motif Quote from The Art of The Evil Within\n\nSebastian Castellanos, also known affectionately by his colleagues as Seb, is the protagonist of The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nOwing to his troubled past, Sebastian Castellanos has a constantly tired and worn look to him in stark contrast to his more well-groomed partner Joseph Oda. He has a gaunt face marred with scars and a light five o'clock shadow that turned into a full beard by 2017. Due to stress and the timeskip between the games, Sebastian's hair had become even more wild and unkempt than it used to be, and he also has a more wrinkled face in the sequel.\n\nDuring his earlier years, Sebastian's attire consisted of mostly a blue dress shirt with black tie and pants along with brown dress shoes. At the time of the Beacon Mental Hospital incident, Sebastian wore a standard, yet weathered KCPD detective uniform consisting of a white shirt and pinstriped waistcoat, along with a matching loose tie. Around the buckle of his faded brown trousers are a multitude of pouches and clamps for his various police gadgets, and he also wore a shoulder rig with a cross-draw holster for his sidearm. Sebastian would always wear a faded trenchcoat given to him by his ex-wife while on the field, until he lost it in the incident.\n\nSebastian's outfit in the sequel is in many ways similar to the first game, though he now wears a dark green-grey v-necked polo shirt instead, and his tool belt is now more generic than before. He also wore a dark grey coat prior to his unwilling recruitment by MOBIUS.\n\nAt the very end of the second game, Sebastian wears a white shirt, a blue jean jacket, beige pants, and brown shoes.\n\nAs he was never officially divorced from his wife, Sebastian still wears their silver wedding ring.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBefore the series began, Sebastian is said to have been very energetic and confident, and at times very emotional. He was very passionate about everything he did and was very idealistic. His career was on the fast track and he rose through the ranks really quickly thanks to his enthusiasm for his job and in protecting his home, Krimson City.\n\nHe is also a very loving husband and father, and is often heard being grateful for having his family in his life. However, he had the tendency to bury his head in his work, neglecting to spend as much time as he wanted with them.\n\nAfter the tragedy that befell his family, however, Sebastian fell into depression and became merely a shell of his former self, turning to alcohol and smoking to ease the pain. His self-esteem took a rapid nosedive, and he began blaming himself for all that had happened. He also became much more cynical, distant and sarcastic, though the traumas in his life have also toughened him up, making him more strong-willed and fearless. Despite this cold front, however, Sebastian still has the capacity for caring and selflessness, as he had offered to help those on his journey on several occasions.\n\nOwing to the many perils their involvement have put him through, Sebastian understandably holds a deep grudge against MOBIUS, though he's quick to mellow out if an affiliated individual is not on the same page as their employers.\n\nAll in all, Sebastian's mannerisms and personality heavily resemble those of the classic hardboiled detective, which was insinuated by Juli Kidman on her first day of working with him.\n\nHistory[]\n\nNot much is known about Sebastian's early life prior to his police career other than him being a Krimson City native. During his time in the police force, Sebastian originally held the rank of Sergeant prior to being promoted to the crime division, where he met his junior agent and later wife Myra Hanson. Despite their differences in methodology and ideology, the duo hit it off surprisingly well, leading to good field synergy and co-operation. This partnership soon turned into a full-scale romance, one that was escalated by Myra's field injury and sick leave. Soon after, they were married, and the fruit of their union was their loving daughter Lily. Sebastian's life was idyllic, being a loving husband and father, but even so buried himself in work.\n\nBut, his happiness was not to last, as a housefire burned down Sebastian's family home and presumably his five-year-old daughter along with it. Worse yet, his wife began acting strangely afterwards, seemingly convinced that the fire was staged and their daughter wasn't dead. In full denial of the truth, however, Sebastian brushed aside Myra's pleading and insisted on moving on with their lives. Myra herself disappeared soon after, causing Sebastian to sink even deeper into despair and turned to alcohol and cigarettes to wash the grief away. Slowly, however, his passion for work eroded, as well as his sense of perspective and composure, as he further spiralled into despair.\n\nShortly after his wife's disappearance, Sebastian's new partner, Joseph Oda, who was assigned to him as Myra's replacement, noticed his alcoholic streak and reported the case to Internal Affairs in an attempt to get his partner back on track. While it did save Sebastian's career, it ultimately put a great strain on their relationship. Since that time Sebastian has returned to the job but is never without his hip flask. He still feels responsible for the tragedies that befell him and shrugs off any offers of help.\n\nAt some point, Sebastian was assigned to mentor a new detective, Juli Kidman. He showed her the ropes and treated her as an equal despite her age. He was impressed when she was able to break their first case on her own.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMain Article: The Evil Within\n\nAn Emergency Call[]\n\nThe series' plotline begins with Sebastian, Joseph and Juli being driven to the Beacon Mental Hospital by officer Oscar Connelly, sent by their precinct to investigate the reported \"multiple murders\" following the disappearance of the previous dispatch. As they arrived at the scene, Sebastian and Joseph went inside to find the aftermath of what looks to be a massacre with only one survivor, the hospital's chief of staff Dr. Marcelo Jimenez. While Joseph tends to the shaken doctor, Sebastian goes through the CCTV footage and finds the previous dispatch being taken out by a cloaked supernatural assailant who, unbeknownst to him, has appeared in the room and was readying to strike. Sebastian turned around just in time for the hooded man to stab him with his orbitoclast, knocking him out.\n\nHe then wakes up in a strange basement and finds himself hung by his feet amongst several corpses. A large, masked man then appears, forcing Sebastian to play dead until he returns to his kitchen, at which point Sebastian manages to cut himself loose with a knife he retrieved from a nearby corpse, lift the keys from a meathook and makes his escape. Before he could leave, however, Sebastian accidentally trips an alarm wire, alerting the masked butcher to his attempt, who then manages to chase him down and cripple him with a chainsaw wound to the leg. Despite his injury, Sebastian manages to escape into the sewers, and outmaneuvering the man once more to make it to an escape elevator where he is taken to safety.\n\nAt the top of the elevator, an earthquake occurs, forcing Sebastian to flee the building. He manages to escape, but finds Krimson City itself crumbling apart. Officer Connelly then arrives in an ambulance, beckoning him to hurry up as the ground beneath the vehicle gives away. Sebastian barely makes it in as Connelly drives with the roadway crumbling behind him. Unknown to them, the figure from before observes as they drive away and disappears from view soon after. As Krimson City continues to fall apart around them, Sebastian is informed that Joseph never made it out of the hospital. Leslie, an asylum patient, begins repeating the words \"fine\" and is comforted throughout the ride by Kidman and the doctor they found earlier. After a long run through the devastated city, Sebastian looks up at the rear view mirror and sees the hooded figure standing with the backseat passengers. Shocked, he looks back, only to see Kidman, Leslie, and the doctor. The ambulance begins losing control as Connelly appears to degrade. Leslie's chanting changes from \"fine\" to ''fall\", which turns out to be right as the ambulance then falls off a cliff. Sebastian then blacks out when the ambulance hits the ground.\n\nRemnants[]\n\nAfter having a nightmare of seeing a lone Haunted crawling up to him, Sebastian wakes up in a hospital, and the setting is filtered black and white. As Sebastian heads towards the door, a nurse appears and escorts him from his 'room'. He is then asked to sign in so as to not 'lose his future memories'. Sebastian is then escorted further into an ominous looking room with a single leather chair in the middle. At the nurses' coaxing, Sebastian eventually sits down in the chair. Strangely, the chair then changes into a metal chair. Before Sebastian can get up, the chair latches on to his hands and legs, trapping him. With the jar found earlier in Sebastian's room, the player unlocks access to Sebastian's mind. This is later used as a way to upgrade Sebastian's abilities with the Green Gel found throughout the game. After Sebastian uses the gel, he asks the nurse if he is going crazy. The room then bursts into flames after the nurse replies \"Now what makes you say that?\"\n\nSebastian then awakes to realize that he was in the destroyed ambulance after it fell off the cliff in the previous chapter, explaining why the room burst into flames before. He then staggers out of the wreckage gravely injured. As he proceeds to wander through the forest that the ambulance landed in, he finds a tent with a man crouched over something. Sebastian picks up a revolver and approaches the man. After turning around, the man is revealed to be Officer Connelly, eating a head. Sebastian kills the reanimated Connely and continues. He then finds Leslie behind a trip wire, indirectly saving Sebastian from death. Leslie runs away before he could help.\n\nMaking his way through the Haunted, Sebastian witnesses the process of becoming the Haunted. While being chased by a horde of Haunted, Sebastian makes it to the exit which is blocked by a gate. To escape, Sebastian jumps into the water below the bridge. The chasing Haunted give up and leave.\n\nClaws of the Horde[]\n\nSebastian trudges out of the water and comes to a village. In the village, he finds the same doctor from the hospital. Upon tracking him down and confronting him, the doctor introduces himself as one Marcelo Jimenez, explaining that Leslie was one of his patients and went through the nearby closed gate. As the horde of Haunted builds up, Jimenez volunteers to distract the creatures while Sebastian goes for the gate.\n\nThe gate has no crank and is unmovable. Sebastian realizes that he needs a chainsaw to cut through the chains. He then encounters the Sadist from Chapter 1 who is restrained by chains. The Sadist breaks free and, after a tough battle, Sebastian kills him and uses his chainsaw to open the gate. As he and Jimenez walk through the gate, it shuts itself behind their back.\n\nThe Patient[]\n\nJimenez informs Sebastian that his brother Valerio, who cared for Leslie before him, runs a hospice not too far from the entrance. Once they enter the hospice, they find Valerio with his back turned, performing surgery on a man. When Sebastian approaches Valerio, it is shown that Valerio isn't saving the man but instead mindlessly slicing him open. Valerio himself is revealed to have turned into one of the Haunted as well. After Sebastian kills him in front of Marcelo, a vision of Valerio's living death is shown. Valerio is beginning to cut open the same man but begins complaining of an itch on his head. Valerio then scratches his head so much he tears off a portion of his own scalp, completing the transformation. Jimenez then starts mumbling about how \"Ruvik\" couldn't have killed Valerio.\n\nLeslie then screams from outside, running into a house. Sebastian and Jimenez chase after Leslie into the basement. After reaching Leslie, the door appears to open by itself, until Sebastian is attacked by an invisible Haunted forcing Sebastian to kill it to proceed. When they go back to the stairs, it turns into a wall.\n\nRuvik appears and separates Sebastian from Leslie and Jimenez into an unknown area. Sebastian makes his way through the hospital and eventually encounters a powerful four-armed monster named Laura. Sebastian narrowly escapes, but then is sent into a different area of the hospital as a result of Ruvik's manipulation of the environment.\n\nInner Recesses[]\n\nMaking his ways through a hospital wing full of invisible Haunted and deadly puzzles, Sebastian finds Joseph connected to a peculiar bath tub. After freeing his partner and healing him, the duo continue together as they make their way out of the partition. However, Sebastian begins to worry after Joseph makes a brief transformation into a Haunted, attempting to throttle him\n\nAfter escaping, they discover Kidman trapped inside of a tank filled with rising water. Together, both of them fight off several waves of Haunted in the mezzanine area, some armed with sticks of dynamite, before they can come to her aid. Upon examination, Joseph then tells Sebastian that to open the tank; a code must be used on a panel. Sebastian must unlock the tank before Kidman drowns.\n\nAfter getting Kidman out, she and Joseph are then separated from Sebastian to the sewer below, and Sebastian quickly follows. As they reunite again, the trio then are separated yet again by Laura. Sebastian is brought to the area where Laura is, where he discovers that fire is the creature's ultimate weakness. After seemingly bringing her down, Sebastian moves on and goes into a room with the STEM machine. He sees a flashback with Ruvik conducting an experiment on Leslie, determining him as the first to survive linking to his brain. Snapping back to reality, the machine becomes active, releasing three Haunted which are manually connected to the machine. Sebastian must knock them down and pulled out the cord to defeat them, causing the machine to violently erupt, knocking Sebastian unconscious.\n\nLosing Grip on Ourselves[]\n\nAwake in the Safe Haven from a nightmare of an eye surgery, Sebastian is in the staff room by a desk. On it are some photographs: a lighthouse, a church, a cemetery, and a hole in the church. As he inspects the hole, everything goes dark. He walks to the patient wing, where he sees Tatiana patrolling her way down a set of stairs that has appeared to the right of the mirror at the end of the hallway. Once he follows, a hallucination of the Keeper is seen. As Sebastian finds Leslie in one of the cells, Leslie slowly turns around. His face turns out to be a mirror, which teleports Sebastian back to the real world.\n\nSebastian ends up in some coastal building of Cedar Hill Church, where he finds Joseph unconscious again. They fight through a seemingly endless army of Haunted and end up having to kill four Haunted, who are operating devices that rain down harpoons. As they come close to the lighthouse, Joseph is separated, and Sebastian must fight another Sadist to regroup and continue.\n\nArriving at the top, Joseph spots two Haunted using a guillotine to execute helpless victims, and thinks he can take them, when he accidentally sets off a tripwire, which blows up the bridge, leaving Joseph knocked out and separated from Sebastian. The two Haunted start to drag Joseph to the guillotine to execute him, and Sebastian must save Joseph before the Haunted decapitate him. After Joseph helps Sebastian cross the gap, Joseph steals his pistol and aims at himself in the head, wondering if it's worth trying to get away. However, Sebastian intercepts before he can pull the trigger, in which Joseph states that Sebastian is slowly drinking himself to death.\n\nThey arrive at a cemetery, in which both of them starts to catch some patterns. They both seem to be experiencing \"jumbled up memories\". Shortly after, Joseph has some pains and Sebastian helps him rest in a nearby house. It is revealed that Joseph reported Sebastian at some point, and talks about how \"the accident\" wasn't his fault. Once Joseph musters his strengths and moves onwards, he sees Leslie and Kidman entering the church. Forcing to use the path in the cemetery, Sebastian encounters the two Giants, Neun and Zehn. After defeating them, Sebastian sees that the route to the church was cut. With no choices, he and Joseph use the underground path. Sebastian then teleports back to the Safe Haven without notice.\n\nAfter solving a sacrificial puzzle, they encounter the Sentinel. The Sentinel knocks Joseph down, forcing Sebastian to fight the monster alone. Once they're out of the arena, Joseph informs that his glasses is in the area where the Sentinel is. Sebastian has to retrieve the glasses to go to the church to catch up with Kidman.\n\nThe Keeper[]\n\nOnce they enter the Cedar Hill Church, Joseph starts to question whether or not he should continue fighting the urge to turn into a Haunted. Joseph soon loses consciousness, and Sebastian injects a syringe into him, hoping it will help. Ruvik then appears and transports Sebastian to the underground catacomb, where the Keeper awaits.\n\nTo move on, Sebastian must obtain three stone lithographs to lift the blockade, encountering AlterEgos along the way. Once done, he descends a staircase, where he meets the Keeper, who triggers a spike trap. Sebastian then steps on a barbed wire trap and must get out before the spikes crush him. Then he must run to the other side while stepping on the traps to avoid getting crushed.\n\nFinding Leslie in a caged cell, Sebastian frees him, but he starts to panic and runs away, triggering a trap which locks Sebastian in the room with the Keeper. After the first Keeper is defeated, poisonous gas starts to fill the rooms. Sebastian must shut all the valves as he battles with the spawning Keepers. In the end, The Keeper decapitates himself and throws his safe head to the ledge where Sebastian is, and launches itself towards him. Sebastian throws the attacking safe back down to the floor, and crushes it with the spike trap as it fully respawns its body.\n\nA Planted Seed Will Grow[]\n\nSebastian enters the cave, inside of which resides numerous AlterEgos. Later on, whilst opening a passage, Sebastian accidentally releases The Babies. As he passes the last puzzle, he is then teleported to the hallway, reaching the room with the STEM machine. In there stands Jimenez. He tells Sebastian that the world was created by Ruvik, and thinks that Ruvik wants them dead.\n\nJimenez then disappears. Sebastian is then pursued by the Amalgam Alpha into the Safe Haven. Thought to be safe, Ruvik suddenly appears in front of Sebastian.\n\nThe Cruelest Intentions[]\n\nAfter seeing a nightmare of him getting burned alive, Sebastian goes to Tatiana. She is looking at a portrait of the Victoriano family. Seeing that Ruvik's face was missing, Sebastian is then jump-scared by Ruvik.\n\nWalking down the corridor of the patient wing, Sebastian arrives at a path toward an abandoned mansion of the Victoriano's. As he walks in, Jimenez is seen taking Leslie to the hallway behind the vault, which closes behind them. To open the vault, Sebastian must find three test subjects and insert a metal rod into their brains in a gruesome experiment correctly while being chased by Ruvik. Every experiment completed will reveal what happened in the mansion in each room via flashback.\n\nWalking down the hallway behind the vault, Sebastian gets moved to a room with a ghostly young Ruvik. After a little chasing, the young Ruvik then turned into a giant blood cell-like creature. Sebastian cannot defeat him and therefore, he is forced to run. Encountering spikes traps and cage mazes, Sebastian escapes, only to find himself in front of a barn in the middle of a sunflower field. He can see the past about Ruvik and Laura, and how Laura died from the barn fire, sacrificing herself by pushing Ruvik through a tiny window above the tall barn doors.\n\nAs the barn burns, Sebastian manages to escape but gets pushed back by the creature. Sebastian must fight all the Haunted while avoiding the creature. As everything ends and the barn burns down, Sebastian's vision ends and he returns to the hallway and enters the basement.\n\n[]\n\nEntering the basement full of deadly machinery, Sebastian sees a memory of Jimenez and young Ruvik before moving into the next area. Sebastian then feels sick as in the next area, there is a giant blade attached to a rotating carousel. Sebastian must make it through without getting his head chopped off by lowering his body into a crouch position, making him vulnerable to the Haunted present. Moving deeper, he sees that to move on, he has to turn on the power to open a metal door. He finds a battery and activates the power, but then encounters deadly machinery and Trauma along the way back.\n\nContinuing his journey, Amalgam Alpha teleports Sebastian to the abandoned asylum, where the haunted form of Laura is waiting. To get to the elevator, Sebastian must proceed through the morgue and furnace, which means facing open incinerator, which is blasting fire outwards. Laura will chase Sebastian until he reaches the elevator. As he makes it, Laura grabs his neck and attempts to choke him, but Sebastian presses the elevator button, cutting her arms off as the elevator descends. Ruvik then appears but doesn't attack. He warns Sebastian that no one can stop his plan.\n\nAs the elevator reaches the floor, Sebastian finds himself in the mansion once again. He walks down the hall and meets Jimenez, who was about to start a test on Leslie. He informs that Leslie had made it out of Ruvik's world, and is the key to getting them out too. As he attempts again, the Amalgam Alpha interrupts and kills Jimenez. It then pushes Leslie and Sebastian. Sebastian flies through a fence and lands in the underground parking lot. Sebastian must fight Amalgam Alpha to get to the surface.\n\nReunion[]\n\nArriving on the surface, Sebastian sees Krimson City in destruction after an earthquake, but only the Beacon Memorial Hospital remains perfectly unharmed. He fights his way through more Haunted, now in armors and armed with assault rifles. He also encounters the Doppelganger. Later he sees Kidman escaping from a mob of Haunted. Sebastian calls to her and tries to find a way to get across to her, but he has to swim while avoiding being eaten by the Shigyo. Once he reaches her, they continue to search for Joseph and Leslie.\n\nWhen reaching the warehouse, Sebastian then turns into a Haunted and attacks Kidman after warning her. Kidman shoots him, but he later becomes normal. Kidman locks Sebastian in and walks away, but Sebastian is helped by Leslie. However, Leslie once again runs away before Sebastian can help. Going deeper, he finds himself in a room filled with flammable gas and mannequins as several Haunted and Trauma patrol, preventing him from using any firearms as it would make the warehouse explode. As he escapes out of a window and gets down to ground level, he sees Joseph and goes to him.\n\nThe Ride[]\n\nJoseph is glad to see Sebastian alive, and informs him that he has had no more \"episodes.\" He tells Sebastian that he found a bus. Before he can get the chance to start driving, Kidman rushes in and starts the bus, when they are attacked by the Heresy, who rips the top of the bus off. Kidman drives through the ruins of the city as Sebastian and Joseph attempt to fight off Heresy. After an intensive fight, Heresy is finally killed by a falling building.\n\nJoseph explains that even though the world was changing, the lighthouse was still the same distance, and it can be seen everywhere. Suddenly, he gets shot, forcing Kidman to stop. She tells Sebastian to find a medical kit from the ambulance on the other side of the highway. She volunteers to go, but Sebastian goes by himself to make sure that Joseph is safe.\n\nWhen he gets the Hemostat and starts to return, a Haunted in a truck with a heavy machine gun attacks. Sebastian must get to the machine gun and shoot down all enemies before moving on. Once they're off, Kidman drives down the road. They then confront Ruvik, who levitates the bus, and sends it crashing into nearby apartment blocks.\n\nCasualties[]\n\nKidman is once again separated from Sebastian and Joseph. They both begin to descend the building but get separated when an elevator gives away. Sebastian encounters acid traps set by Doppelgangers. The Keeper also appears at times, forcing Sebastian to be stealthy.\n\nOnce arriving at the bottom floor, Sebastian finds Joseph fighting the Keeper. Suddenly, Ruvik changes the kitchen room into a death trap. Sebastian must disarm the acid trap to exit the room while avoiding fire, spikes, and robots with spinning blades. Having arrived in the meat locker, Sebastian must follow Joseph up the elevator, but must fight the Keeper long enough until the elevator arrives.\n\nSeeing and eventually approaching Kidman and Leslie, Sebastian witnesses Leslie stop everything around them from moving. Juli pulls out her gun to shoot Leslie and apologizes then says it wasn't his fault. Sebastian proceeds to try and stop her, but he learns that Juli had her own set of orders from someone. However, she says she's going against them because she can't let Ruvik have Leslie.\n\nOnce she turns to Sebastian, there is a brief moment of confusion on her face before Joseph runs to Leslie. Leslie screams very loud, loud enough to shatter the nearby by windows and runs away. Kidman tries to shoot him, the first shot misses but her second hits Joseph because he jumped in the way. As she runs after Leslie, the ground gives way and Sebastian falls through the earth.\n\nUlterior Motives[]\n\nSebastian wakes up in a subway station and wishes that Joseph is okay. Coming closer to the train bridge, Sebastian fights through the Haunted and eventually enters the hive where Quell and many AlterEgos dwell. He comes to the elevator, where he has to connect the circuit and power the generator. In the middle of cranking the generator, Quell interrupts and flings him into the arena where Sebastian fights it. After defeating it, he powers the generator again and use the elevator to go up.\n\nReaching the train car connecting the two buildings, he is warned by Ruvik with three steel beams inscribed with the words 'You will suffer.' On the midpoint of the bridge, Ruvik comes and casts a storm, shaking the train. Sebastian escapes before it falls into the valley.\n\nAn Evil Within[]\n\nAfter waking up from the nightmare of Sebastian killing himself, Sebastian finds out that the ward is empty, and Tatiana is gone. Sebastian checks her reception desk, where he finds his last personal journal. Suddenly, the place shakes. Sebastian then finds Leslie, who guides him to the hospital, but gets separated at the last point.\n\nAt the surface of Krimson City, he stands on the road in front of the hospital, seeing the beacon of the hospital. From there, he finds Leslie at the beacon. As Sebastian follows, an anonymous patient tells him not to look into Ruvik's eyes, after which he dies. Sebastian is then grabbed and choked by Ruvik, but he smacks Ruvik with his lantern, burning his robe off, and accidentally looks into his eyes. Suddenly, he is back at the entrance, but in a bloody arena world. Sebastian must survive all the battles and traps in order to reach Beacon Mental Hospital again. At this point, Ruvik admits that he created the world.\n\nArriving at the top floor, Sebastian finds himself sleeping in a tub connecting to the STEM machine on the floor below. At the same time, Sebastian hears Leslie as he burst through a door, running away from Kidman. He hides behind Sebastian as Kidman arrives. After a brief conversation between the two, the world changes. Leslie walks toward Ruvik and turns him into liquid as he touches him. The liquid is then fed into the giant Brain. The world then tilts, and Sebastian flies out of the window into the area where the final battle awaits.\n\nSebastian lands on a giant brain as Ruvik, now evolved into Amalgam, attempts to crush Sebastian. Sebastian, unable to do anything but run, ends up flying into a truck with a mounted gun. He must shoot all of Amalgam's arms to survive, and must also aim at the brain, where Ruvik is. Sebastian loses control of the vehicle and gets impaled on a sharp piece of building frame. However, a dead Sadist falls from the sky and happens to have a rocket launcher in its hands. Sebastian takes the launcher and manages to do substantial amounts of damage to Amalgam before he is pulled off and lands on the brain again. Before Amalgam kills Sebastian, he gets one final shot off with his pistol that hits Ruvik and kills him.\n\nSebastian wakes up, hooked to the STEM machine. After a hallucination of Ruvik, Sebastian ends everything by disconnecting and destroying Ruvik's brain.\n\nSebastian wakes up again in the STEM machine. Kidman, who was checking his heart rate, closes the monitor and gestures Sebastian to play dead. As the staff goes away, he wakes up and removes the connected cord. He sees Connelly and Jimenez connected to the machine, but they are already lifeless. Sebastian leaves to find Leslie, who went away first. As he comes to the reception, a SWAT team comes in, and checks if Sebastian is alright, but he states that he just want some fresh air. When he walks outside, however, he sees Leslie walking away confidently (implying that Ruvik has taken over his body), but before he can investigate further, a sudden headache strikes. When he regains his composure, Leslie is gone.\n\nThe Assignment[]\n\nSebastian is the deuteragonist of The Assignment. He appears a few times in this DLC.\n\nAn Oath[]\n\nThe first are when Juli sees him and Joseph wandering the MOBIUS building a couple of times. To them, it was Beacon Mental Hospital.Then she sees them again in the Water Chamber and when she falls out, Sebastian and Joseph are there. Joseph asks her if she was alright before they fall through the floor.\n\nCrossing Paths[]\n\nAfter that, Juli doesn't see Sebastian again until later in the game when she finds Joseph, and they fight off a bunch of Haunted. Then while the three of them walks down a hall flooded with blood, Sebastian gets a headache induced by Ruvik and runs off. She doesn't see him again for the rest of the DLC.\n\nThe Consequence[]\n\nSebastian is the deuteragonist of The Consequence. He appears a few times in this DLC.\n\nIllusions[]\n\nSebastian is seen a lot more in this DLC. The first is when Juli sees a memory of him and Ruvik talking. Juli then proceeds to say she feels bad for him and that 'he doesn't have anything to do with this.' She sees him again later at the construction site. She sees him again from her higher vantage point and says the same thing as before.\n\nAfter she kills Shade, they see each other again briefly before he turns into a Haunted and tries to attack her. Juli nearly shoots him but then sees Ruvik behind him, so she barely misses Sebastian and hits Ruvik instead, causing him to disappear. Sebastian passes out while leaning on her (practically laying on her), and he turns back into a human. Juli then hugs him and says, \"I'm sorry for putting you through this. I don't want to hurt more than I already have.\" She then locks him in the room and leaves him.\n\nNot too long after they see each other again when she is running from both The Administrator and the Heresy. Sebastian and Joseph are on the bus before she runs into it and tries to start it. She then drives all three of them away from the Heresy as The Administrator stops chasing her and disappears.\n\nA Ghost is Born[]\n\nShe doesn't see him again until she is at the playground. At first, she doesn't even realise it's him. She thinks it's The Administrator, but when she turns around, he turns into Sebastian. She is confused for a moment before she runs after Leslie and Sebastian falls through the ground.\n\nLater on, she doesn't see him until she's chasing Leslie at the top of Beacon Mental Hospital. Sebastian tries to stop her while blocking Leslie from her range of the shot. She tries to explain to him what's been going on and why she's doing this, but Ruvik interrupts them. Ruvik turns Leslie into the liquid which is then absorbed into the giant Brain.\n\nAfter this, they see each other in the real world. Juli thanks him for stopping Ruvik then she turns off his monitor. Sebastian wakes up, and she signals him to lay low. She then lies to MOBIUS that he's dead so that he won't be taken away, and so he can escape later.\n\nThe Executioner[]\n\nIn the third DLC, Sebastian is a bonus boss that can be fought playing New Game+ after the character completes the DLC once. However, unlike Joseph, he is not a Haunted when the Keeper fights him.\n\nHe makes another appearance at the end of the Final Execution Chamber, where him and Joseph must be fought at the same time.\n\nWhen fighting Sebastian, make sure not to stay in his melee range for to long as he hits harder than he does in the main game and will stun The Keeper. Also keep an eye on the floor as Sebastian will place Explosive Bolts on the floor when given the chance. When he pulls out his revolver, get behind cover quickly to prevent taking too much damage. Trapping him with Wire Traps is also useful to deal heavy damage to him or to keep him stuck in place to deal with Joseph in the Sebastian and Joseph boss. Defeating Sebastian will reward the player with the Golden Hammer unlock (must be purchased from shop).\n\nAfter Beacon[]\n\nSebastian is put under mandatory counselling after the Beacon incident and is viewed as crazy, before eventually being dismissed from the force.\n\nOver the next three years, Sebastian begins looking into MOBIUS to try and find Kidman and reveal the truth about what happened at Beacon. His search proves fruitless, and he falls back into his depression, turning once more to drink to ease the guilt he feels over his failure.\n\nGoing Back into STEM[]\n\nMain Article: The Evil Within 2\n\nInto the Flame[]\n\nSebastian rushes home seeing his house on fire. Knowing his daughter is inside, he rushes in breaking in through the patio door. He makes his way into Lily's Room and and finds it empty, only for Lily to appear behind him, she states that he wasn't there for her, before rushing over and grabbing him, before bursting into flames incinerating them both.\n\nWaking up at a booth in a bar, Sebastian comes face to face with Kidman. He angrily begins to demand answers about MOBIUS, but Kidman motions to two agents sitting at the bar. Kidman tells Sebastian that his daughter Lily is still alive, but is in danger. Sebastian draws a gun on her before and demands to know the truth. The agents set up Sebastian but he quickly dispatches them, though Kidman injects him with a sedative.\n\nSebastian wakes up bound to a wheelchair in MOBIUS headquarters, and comes face to face with The Admnistrator, and new STEM system. The administrator explains that the news STEM is improved on the Beacon model, having a much more stable core, Sebastian sees that the name on the core of the system, Lily Castellanos. He is enraged that they would dare hook his daughter up to a machine that they know to be dangerous.\n\nThe Administrator and Kidman explain that the new STEM had been much more successful until a week prior when Lily had vanished within the system, and the environment began to collapse. They explain that they want Sebastian to go inside, due to his experience within an unstable STEM environment, also giving him the chance to see his daughter again, as well as save her, which he spent so long believing he had failed to do.\n\nDeciding that he has no choice, Sebastian willingly agrees to reenters STEM. Entering the terminal, Kidman prepares Sebastian for his entrance into STEM, she assures him that he will be out here for him, and there will be someone else inside for him.\n\nSomething Not Quite Right[]\n\nUpon entering STEM, Sebastian witnesses manifestations of his home burning down while his daughter screams for help, an argument with his wife, and the initial distress call from Beacon. As the world around him calibrates, he finds a desk with a device that resembles a walkie talkie, upon lifting it, the world around him morphs into a representation of his old office. He answers the call coming from the communicator and Kidman explains this room was constructed to serve as a safe area for him, and was the only place they could communicate with him. Sebastian takes a moment to look through details on the missing team members before leaving, using a mirror.\n\nSebastian comes to inside his own house, unburned to witness Lily playing on the floor, and his wife Myra doing dishes. Lily is distressed that her doll is broken, so he offers her comfort and assures her that her mother will be able to fix it. Myra comes over to Sebastian when he begins to suffer from a head ache, she tells him that he needs to stop pushing himself so hard. The world flashes white.\n\nSebastian finds himself in a large upscale building, where he finds the first of the MOBIUS team, surrounded by a strange aura that seems to cause his death to repeat continuously. He continues forward and eventually spies a man fleeing in terror, only to murdered by a man who suddenly appears before him trapping him in the same aura as the MOBIUS member, he death, looping continuously. Sebastian evades the killer and moves on, as he does, the world becomes more twisted, reflecting the same metaphyical world he witnessed in STEM before, also finding more dead bodies presented as twisted works of art.\n\nSebastian attempts to navigate the twisting world, only for the killer from before to take a photo of him, the world warps again. Sebastian finds the photo, only having a moment to be perturbed by it before being beset unto by a massive, three-headed creature. While attempting to escape, the killer appears and throws a knife at Sebastian, landing in his shoulder. This stuns Sebastian long enough for the creature to catch him, Sebastian pulls the knife out of his shoulder and uses it to cut the creature and free himself and getting to safety.\n\nPassing through a door Sebastian finds himself in a house on the outskirts of the town, he finds a gun and heads out into the world to search for Lily and the MOBIUS team. He enters a house and encounters a twisted citizen of Union murdering someone, he dispatches the fiend and moves on. Upon entering the town, he witnesses a horde of creatures kill one of the MOBIUS while another flees inside a building. Sebastian follows the survivor inside.\n\nThe survivor doesn't trust Sebastian and holds him at gunpoint and begins babbling about the creatures, Sebastian disarms him and states that he hadn't taken the safety off. He gives back the survivor back his gun and introduces himself, the survivor introduces himself as Liam O'Neal. Sebastian explains that he was sent in by MOBIUS to find the core. O'Neal refuses to go back outside but he instructs Sebastian on how to follow signal's using his communicator which should lead him to the core.\n\nResonances[]\n\nSebastian follows the signal emitting Lily's voice, a truck stop near the edge of town. Inside he finds a doll that grants him a vision from Lily's perspective of that shows her running from someone, she spies an open window which she climbs out of and flees the scene.\n\nOutside, Sebastian picks up her signal again and follows to a warehouse, he dispatches the monstrous citizens of Union before making his way inside. He follows Lily's signal to a room, and finds another doll. Sebastian is granted another vision, showing Lily fleeing and hiding from her pursuer. Who seems to give up only to grab her as soon as she is about to leave.\n\nSebastian is horrified to realize that the person who is pursing Lily is the murderer with the camera. He attempts to contact O'Neal, but cannot reach him, while attempting to get outside, he finds the killer and is transported back in the same building where he first encountered him, finds another murdered MOBIUS agent, as well as a message that reads \"SMILE FOR ME\" before being transported back to the warehouse.\n\nOutside he finds the killer. He demands to know where Lily is, but he promptly teleports away, leaving several slinking creatures to deal with Sebastian. After killing the creatures, Sebastian tries again to call O'Neal, informing him that he knows who has Lily, O'Neal states that he tracked a signal to City Hall, which is located on a different shard of Union hundreds of feet up. O'Neal tells sebastian to get back to his safe house so he can instruct him on how to reach City Hall.\n\nBack at the safe house, O'Neal explains that the signal the killer is emitting is now emanating from City Hall and he likely went there to defend the stable field emitter, a device that would stabilise the area and remove any abnormalities he states that a technician, Harrison and a security had been sent to turn it on. He then tells Sebastian that he will be able to get to City Hall using a system of passageways called the Marrow, which exist on a separate layer from the rest of Union, and, as a result he will be able to get to city hall despite it floating far above, he gives Sebastian the password to access the marrow, as well as a gas mask to pass through a gas leak in marrow.\n\nSide Mission: Rogue Signal[]\n\nUpon O'Neal's instruction, Sebastian follows the signal of MOBIUS security team members. He discovers that the team gave up on their mission of protecting civilians and and decided to focus on survival, which included killing any and all civilians in order to prevent them turning into monsters.\n\nSebastian tracks their locations, finding both dead, one of them at the hands of the killer with the camera who left him displayed like the rest of his victims. Sebastian returns to O'Neal to give him the bad news.\n\nAnima Encounter #1[]\n\nUpon investigating a house, Sebastian finds the diary of a woman who expresses terror of an unseen force. Upon attempting to leave the house, the couch is launched against the door blocking his exit, an eerie voice then whispers his name, turning around, he comes face to face with a ghostly woman who rushes towards him. Getting past her, Sebastian ducks into a room, only to find himself back at Beacon.\n\nSebastian hides as the creature looks for him. Finding himself locked in with the creature, he locates a key card which unlocks the door and allows him to escape. Sebastian suddenly grasps his head and pain and sees flashes of what happened to him the last time he was in STEM before as well as a body lying on a table. He is suddenly being teleported back to the house as though he never left.\n\nBehind the Curtain[]\n\nSebastian heads to the North Safe House to access the Marrow. Upon reaching it he calls Kidman to update her on the status of the mission. He ask for information of the killer with the camera. Sebastian enters into the Marrow only to find that it is in just as bad shape as Union, and is infested with monsters.\n\nGetting through to the area with the gas leak only to find that the gas is not only poisonous, but it is also flammable meaning he will have to navigate the area without using firearms. He restores power to the area to unlock doors so he can escape.\n\nSebastian finds another terminal that allows him to reenter Union near City Hall.\n\nLying in Wait[]\n\nSebastian witnesses Stefano entering City Hall.

Harrison tells Sebastian that if the Stable Field Emitter is not turned on, then Union will collapse completely, it will also weaken the killer's powers. He gives Sebastian his communicator to turn on the emitter before dying.\n\nSebastian heads further inside, navigating a series of hallways displaying the killers twisted art. Before finally finding the Stable Field Emitter. Upon Activating the Emitter, Sebastian is Frozen by the killer who introduces himself as Stefano Valentini, he taunts Sebastian with his knife. He states that he has already promised to give give Lily to someone else who could reward him for her. He then leaves Sebastian to be killed by his creature, Obscura, who freezes the Stable Field Emitter. Sebastian holds off the creature long enough to allow the emitter to reboot.\n\nWhen the Emitter activates the Obscura is banished. Sebastian realises that if Stefano is gone, then Lily wouldn't be in the area. He heads outside to call Kidman, He tells her that Stefano got away with Lily. Kidman tries to reassure him that they want to find Lily just as much as he does, which leads to him sarcastically quipping that MOBIUS only thinks of his daughter as an experiment. Kidman snaps and him and says she genuinely cares for Lily having gotten to know her during testing. She tells Sebastian that he needs to stay focused in order to find Lily. Sebastian tells her that the killer identified himself as Stefano, she promises to find what information she can on him and send it to his room.\n\nSuddenly Sebastian spots one of Stefano's most faithful minions, resembling a camera lens with tentacles latched onto another another chunk of the town far above him. He calls O'Neal to get the directions he'll need to follow through the Marrow to reach that part of town.\n\nOn the Hunt[]\n\nSebastian reenters the Marrow and follows the path that will lead him to an exit near the theater. En route he encounters a memory of an argument he had with his wife Myra, when she attempted to tell him about MOBIUS kidnapping Lily. Sebastian rebuffs her claims and tells her she needs to accept that Lily is dead, leading to Myra declaring she will get Lily back on her own if need be. Sebastian laments that he should have trusted his wife all along.\n\nFurther in, the halls are dripping with a strange white substance, which he quickly discovers has been left behind by a strange creature, that appears to be looking for something.

He recognises the woman as Yukiko Hoffman, the team psychologist. He assures her that he is there to help, realizing he is telling the truth, she apologizes for holding him up.\n\nSebastian tells her that he's on the trail of Stefano, who she realises must have been able to somehow cheat the psychological tests run on all STEM candidates and hidden the fact he is a psychopath which gives him immense power within STEM, and having the core amplified his abilities. She tells Sebastian that destroying something precious to him might be enough to throw him off his guard and give him a chance to defeat him.\n\nSebastian asks why she thought he was dead, and he tells her that Lily was told that, but then realises it was likely to save her feelings from being hurt over not being able to be with her father.\n\nSebastian leaves the Marrow and heads out into the Business District.\n\nLust for Art[]\n\nApproaching the theater, Sebastian receives a call from Stefano who claims that he is not worthy to witness his greatest piece until he learns to appreciate his art, and taunts him with Lily crying for help.

He helps him fight them off. He thanks thanks Sebastian for his help and unlocks his safe house inviting Sebastian inside. He introduces himself as Julian Sykes. He tells Sebastian that without the core Union is too unstable, and MOBIUS likely turned off the communications themself in an effort to preserve themselves. But there might be another way out.\n\nSide Mission: Getting Back Online[]\n\nSykes tells Sebastian to head into the Marrow and reboot the server so he can look for an alternate way out. In exchange for this he offers to override the electronic locks on all the supply crates in the area.

Stefano angrily berates him for destroying his work, But he states as long as he has the core, he will be the more powerful and Sebastian will not be able to stop him.\n\nEntering the auditorium he finds all the sets full of people with bags over their heads. The lights suddenly go out before the stage lights come on revealing Stefano. Sebastian demands to know where Lily is, but he simply says she's safe with him, as he no longer intends to give her to the man he initially agree to find her for. Suddenly, Stefano triggers explosives attached to the heads of the captive audience, Sebastian dives for cover as their heads explode. Sebastian calls Stefano sick as he revels in his act of murder, before stating that Lily's fear will inspire him to create an even greater piece, before warping the world and heading off to get Lily.\n\nSebastian gives chase, evading Stefano's massive creature and finds Stefano in a gallery, demanding he stop running, Stefan agrees stating he is growing bored of Sebastian.

He tells her not to be afraid and tries to assure her that he is her father, but she doesn't believe him saying her father is dead. A sudden rumbling draws Sebastian's attention to the door, the white ooze from before melts the door, and a hooded female figure enters. The figure approaches Lily and tells her to \"Come to mother.\" as she removes her hood. Sebastian is shocked realising that it's his wife, Myra, who has been corrupted by STEM. She tells Sebastian to get away, before summoning the creature from the Marrow, causing a massive hole to open in the floor. Sebastian cries out as the creature takes Myra and Lily away, before the ground beneath him gives way and he falls into the abyss.\n\nAnother Evil[]\n\nSebastian wakes up at his desk in his room. He suddenly remembers what Kidman said before he entered STEM, about someone being inside for him. He realises Kidman knew Myra was in there all along. He then hears a new voice over his communicator. He tries to call Kidman but fails, moving to the mirror that serves as the exit to Union, only to find it gone, instead there is a strange altar. Upon investigating it, Sebastian finds himself transported to a strange medieval fortress.\n\nNavigating through the area whilst fighting off a band of disturbing flame-wreathed beings, Sebastian comes face to face with the voice he heard over the communicator. He calls himself Father Theodore. Sebastian seems unimpressed by him, stating that he'd already killed one \"lunatic with a god complex\" that day. Theodore however implores Sebastian to help him retrieve Lily from Myra so that he might use her power to take control of Union. Sebastian outright refuses.\n\nAnnoyed at Sebastian's attitude, he tells him to think about it and return of his own free will so they might work together. He then summons a tidal wave of blood to wash Sebastian away.\n\nHidden from the Start[]\n\nSebastian wakes in a cabin witnessing an apparition of Lily over the sound of gunfire, the apparition disappears as a woman calls out to Sebastian for help fending off the warped citizens of Union. The pair fight off the horde. After surviving Sebastian's companion introduces herself as Esmeralda Torres, and to his surprise identifies him by name. Sebastian questions how he know who he is. She tells him to follow him to her safe house.\n\nEn route, she explains that Kidman told her that Sebastian would be sent into STEM if the plant had failed. Sebastian doesn't understand, so Torres tells him that Myra had concocted a plan to free Lily and eliminate MOBIUS, which she, Kidman and Theodore were a part of. Sebastian tells her that Theodore has gone rogue.\n\nNear the safe house they witness one of Theodore's most devout followers. They make their way through the area and reach her safe house, inside Torres has stockpiled weapons and explosives. Sebastian informs Torres that Myra has been corrupted by STEM and taken Lily. They come to the conclusion that stopping Theodore may help Myra come to her senses. Sebastian decides to call O'Neal to help track Theodore.\n\nBefore calling O'Neal calls Kidman, telling her that Stefano is dead but there is a more powerful threat to Lily, he also subtly informs her that he knows about the plan, and that he trusts her. He heads out to find O'Neal after he is unable to reach him using the communicator, asking Torres to prepare her weapons and explosives.\n\nReconnecting[]\n\nHeading back into the Marrow, Sebastian reaches Hoffman's safe house, he finds a residual memory, revealing that Hoffman received a message from O'Neal asking her to meet him in a restricted area of the lab.\n\nSebastian follows Hoffman's trail into the lab, taking the chip from a deceased MOBIUS operative to pass into the restricted area. He finds Hoffman inside along with one of one of Theodore's Harbingers Hoffman attempts to stop them attacking each other, referring to the Harbinger as \"Liam.\" A confused Sebastian looks on as the Harbinger removes his mask, revealing O'Neal, warped by Theodore. He states that Sebastian should join them, but refuses. The pair fight, with Sebastian emerging victorious.\n\nSebastian is thanked by a dying O'Neal who tells him that Theodore tricked him, and tells him there is a device in the next room that is masking his signal. Sebastian and Hoffman go to the next Room to inspect the device. Sebastian calls Torres asking her to bring explosives with her to destroy the device. Hoffman opts to stay in the other room and go through O'Neal's devices to find out what he was working on.\n\nAnima Encounter #3[]\n\nChecking a computer, Sebastian finds a log of a technician stationed at a body disposal pit, stating that he is hearing voices. Sebastian then hears the voice too, realising that it's the creature from before. Trying to escape before it catches him, it locks a shutter trapping him in the area before rushing at him and transporting him back to Beacon again.\n\nBeing careful to avoid the creatures gaze and stay out of it's path, Sebatian manages to get past the creature and into another room. Here, he finds a note revealing that the chief of KCPD was on the side of MOBIUS and tried to make sure the Beacon Incident and what happened to Sebastian are kept quiet. Sebastian is horrified knowing that MOBIUS truly are everywhere.\n\nA door unlocks and Sebastian goes through, finding himself, dressed as he was in during the Beacon Incident, barely conscious, repeating how it's \"My fault\" that he's \"Still Here\" and \"Never getting out.\" Sebastian realises that his inability to move past what happened is the source of his pain, he then shoots this version of himself, before being transported back to the restricted area. Feeling much more at ease, Sebastian realises he's somehow gotten hold of his old revolver, and seems happy to see it.\n\nBottomless Pit[]\n\nTorres detonates the explosives, destroying the device. An enraged Theodore berates Sebastian for his actions before teleporting Sebastian to an area of old blood and debris, some of which is clearly from his home before it burned down. Theodore continues to try and persuade Sebastian to join him as he navigates the area, battling fearsome new abominations along the way.\n\nFinding himself in a grand hall, Sebastian spots Lily. He goes towards her only for her to burst into flames before him. Theodore appears to taunt Sebastian, as another apparition of Lily appears blaming Sebastian for what happened before grabbing him and bursting setting him ablaze, disoriented and confused Sebastian attempts to shoot Theodore only to shoot Torres, who suddenly appeared in front of him before passing out. Sebastian comes to briefly to witness Torres fending off waves of monsters, and tells him to get Wallace.\n\nSebastian wakes up, in his home, unburned and in tact. He walks through the house and finds Myra, she tells him that he needs to stop blaming himself for everything that happened to him and everyone else. She assures him that he can endure this, as he has already endured so much, but it's important for him to forgive himself as well.\n\nStronghold[]\n\nSebastian wakes up in Hoffman's safehouse, Torres having gotten them both to safety, before dying. Sebastian tries again to blame himself, but Hoffman assures him that he is not to blame, Theodore is. He also tells Sebastian that Torres admitted to her that she was the one who kidnapped Lily and burned his house on orders from MOBIUS and she'd joined Myra to make ammends. Sebastian calls her a good soldier, and forgives her for kidnapping Lily. He takes her assault rifle promising to get Theodore.\n\nHoffman shows Sebastian that Theodore's foretress appeared in the Business district after the signal masking device was destroyed, but it is engulfed by an impenatrable wall of fire. She tells him that she found a device among O'Neal's possesions that would allow them to pass through the fire. Sebastian tells her to meet him with the device at the hotel near the stronghold.\n\nAt the hotel, Hoffman explains that the device is essentially a portable Stable Field Emitter, which will keep the fire away from them, but it would need to be operated manually, she stated that she would do it, Sebastian refused however she reasoned that she needed to do it, as Sebastian wouldn't be able to carry it and fend off any danger, plus she realised that what happened to Lily was just as much her fault as Torres' and wanted to make ammends. Sebastian reluctantly agrees.\n\nHeading outside Hoffman turns on the device and the pair make their way into the wall of fire, as the device sheilds them from it. However, Theodores disciples attack them repeatedly. Near the Stronghold, the device is broken, Sebastian and Hoffman rush to the entrance before the fire can consume them, but Hoffman is pinned down by a disciple and killed when the fire consumes her.\n\nSide Mission: The Last Step[]\n\nSebastian receives a call from Sykes who informs him that he has finally found a way out. He returns to Sykes' safe house to learn more. Sykes tells him that he needs Sebastian to restore the power restricted area of the Marrow and get rid of any monsters to allow him to escape, in exchange he will show Sebastian how to use the pod to escape himself.\n\nSebastian heads in and clears the area and does what's required before calling Sykes. Suddenly getting a bad feeling, Sebastian suggests that Sykes stay behind and help him find Lily and they can all find a different way out. Sykes refuses saying that he will be more help outside than in. Showing Sebastian how to use the pod should he choose to, and gifting him a shotgun for his help, Sykes uses the pod to leave.\n\nChecking the computer, Sebastian learns that this method of getting out of STEM only had a 25% success rate, and the other 75% simply ceased to be possibly lost to a lower level of STEM or simply dying. He refuses to risk Lily on those odds, but hopes Sykes made it out.\n\nChatting With Kidman[]\n\nDuring his time within Union, Sebastian frequently spoke to Kidman, trying to make sense of everything that has happened, reminiscing about his time with Lily, occasionally berating her for her involvement in his predicament and even praising her skill as a detective. Eventually, Sebastian broaches the subject of Joseph's death and how he's not sure if he can forgive himself for it, however Kidman reveals that Joseph is still alive.\n\nShocked Sebastian asks her how, but she tells him that now is not the time, and promises to tell him when they are both safe, and that he can stop blaming himself.\n\nBurning the Altar[]\n\nEnraged that Theodore has caused the death of the last member of the team, Sebastian makes his way up the stronghold, battling through horde's of theodore's disciples and other creatures, as Theodore berates him. Sebastian asks why he would even want to control Union as it isn't even real. Theodore reveals that all MOBIUS members are connected to Union through their cranial chips, and that through Union, he could take control of MOBIUS and then, the rest of the world. Theodore offers Sebastian a final chance to join him. Sebastian refuses, leading to Theodore promising to find kill Myra and make Lily watch. Sebastian then says he'll keep coming back until either he or Theodore is dead.\n\nSebastian reaches the top of Theodore's tower, and enters Theodore's throne room. Theodore once again sets an apparition Lily against Sebastian, however this time, Sebastian welcomes her with open arms and tells her he's going to make things right and that he loves her. Lily disappears.\n\nRealizing that using his guilt over Lily will not work, Theodore instead falls back on Sebastian's worst experiences - from the Beacon Incident, he teleports Sebastian to a familiar hallway, which echoes with the sound of a revving chainsaw, Sebastian finds himself face to face with the Sadist, the first thing he ever encountered within STEM. Sebastian runs from the maniac towards an elevator, but the Sadist is teleported in front of him, blocking his path. Sebastian however manages to get behind the Sadist and stabs him in the throat, causing him to drop to the ground. Looking to the elevator, Sebastian decides that he's not running, taking the chainsaw and sawing through the brute from shoulder to gut.\n\nOnly getting a moment to revel in his victory, barbed wire suddenly wraps around Sebastian's feet and drags him to another a room shrouded in fog, looking around her hears a distinct metal creaking, he looks on as The Keeper materializes out of a safe, before charging at him. Sebastian manages to get the upper hand on the keeper and defeat him, however just as before The Keeper revives himself using a nearby safe, as well as summonung a clone of himself, in an attempt to overpower Sebastian more easily, However Sebastian is able to defeat both of them, ridding himself of the monstrous butcher forever.\n\nAs the final keeper falls, his safe cracks open, Sebastian looks on as the monstrous manifestation of Ruvik's sister Laura emerges and shrieks at him, Sebastian simply states that he's already burned her once and will do it again, and begins to divert gas, before he tricks the beast into following him beneath an incinerator, and and setting her ablaze, as she screams in pain, with Laura defeated, Sebastian has finally overcome his worst fears preventing Theodore from using them against him.\n\nThe world shifts back as Theodore takes the place of Laura, screaming in pain. As the flames die out, Theodore runs from Sebastian, who angrily holds him at gunpoint, possibly intending to interrogate him. However, Theodore is stabbed from behind as Myra reveals herself. Sebastian tries to reason with Myra that Lily is now safe, before Theodore tries to kill her with a blade hidden in his cane. Myra shrugs off the attack and kills Theodore, stabbing him upwards through the head, before bringing his tower down.\n\nThe End of This World[]\n\nSebastian wakes up amongst the rubble of the tower, he steps outside to survey the ruins of Union. He begins to make his way down the tower, he comes across Myra, he attempts to reason with her to come home, so they can be a family again. Myra simply states that Lily must stay safe before leaving.\n\nSebastian follows her into the ruins of a crumbling Union, dispatching the psychoplasm-infused denizens before coming to a halt before a horridly disfigured husk of a creature summoned by Myra. Upon defeating it, he finally catches up to her. She tells him that she won't let him hurt her, and that she can keep their daughter safe, within STEM. Enraged at Seastian's refusal to leave, she destroys what remains of Union, and Sebastian falls into the abyss.\n\nIn Limbo[]\n\nThe remains of the STEM world are a snowy wasteland, however Sebastian spots an intact structure, His old home. He makes his way their, witnessing residual memories of Myra's revealing her plotting with Theodore and Kidman, to get Lily out, as well as revealing her intention to become the core of STEM much to his confusion, as well as the moment Theodore revealed his betrayal and Theodore threatening Myra.\n\nReaching the house, Sebastian calls out to Myra, she reverts to her human form, and tells Sebastian that Lily will be safe within STEM, able to have a happy existence. Sebastian however tells her that Lily will not have a real life if she stays in STEM. Sebastian reasons that together they can keep Lily safe. Myra is overcome by her monstrous side, and he begs her to stop before she rushes him, Sebastian unwillingly shoots her.\n\nTo his horror, Myra transforms into a monstrous behemoth, blinded by fury. Sebastian pleads for her to end it all as she attacks, saying she will protect Lily no matter what, Sebastian is forced to fight his wife order to save Lily. As Myra is close to defeat, Sebasitan asks Myra to forgive him, before slaying the beast, which oozes into a pool of psychoplasm.\n\nSebastian sees his wife's hand sticking out of the substance and rushes to pull her out of it, and get her onto solid ground, suddenly she wakes up, Sebastian apologises, Myra tells him that he did the right thing and she was unable to control herself. She tells him that he needs to get Lily out. She tells Sebastian to leave her and go get Lily, promising to follow him.\n\nA Way Out[]\n\nSebastian makes his way to the house and finds Lily asleep in her room, she wakes up and asks if it's really him. He assures her that it's really him, he tells her to go back to sleep and that she'll be safe when she wakes up. Sebastian carries her downstairs as Myra enters the house. Sebastian tells her that need to leave, but Myra tells him that she can't leave.\n\nShe tells him that as long as MOBIUS are active, they will come after Lily again and again, and explains that as STEM collapses she can send out a signal that will kill all MOBUS members through their cranial implants. Apolgising to Sebastian for the hell that MOBIUS had put him through twice, telling him to start living again and asks her to make sure Lily knows that her mother loved her. Sebastian shares one final kiss with his wife and tells her that he loves her before leaving.\n\nCalling Kidman he tells her that he has Lily, Kidman tells him that he needs to get to his room for Sebastian runs through the crumbing remains of Union to reach his room, waiting for Kidman to extract them. The floor beneath them gives way, and Sebastian places her on safe footing before pulling himself up. Reaching for the mirror to leave STEM.\n\nSebastian suddenly wakes up in his STEM pod and starts yelling for Lily, Kidman tells him to stand by the center as the doors open, however they are moving too slowly and he resorts to using his bare hands to pry them open, revealing Lily. She wakes up and tells him that she had a nightmare, He assures her that it's over, before turning to Kidman and asking if it really is. She assures him that it's over and the trio exit the facility, leaving MOBIUS in ruin with all their operatives deceased.\n\nEpilogue[]\n\nSome time later, Sebastian and Lily have packed up a car preparing to leave. Kidman, sees them off, gifting Lily a doll that resembles Myra, before parting ways. Sebastian looks to his daughter and smiles as she beams back at him, the pair finally able to look forward to the future as they drive off to a new life.\n\nKilled Victims[]\n\nThis list shows the victims Sebastian has killed:\n\nOscar Connelly (As a Haunted, Determinant)\n\nValerio Jimenez (As a Haunted, Determinant)\n\nSadist\n\nSentinel (Determinant)\n\nLaura (Creature)\n\nAmalgam Alpha\n\nHeresy\n\nThe Quell\n\nRuvik (possibly)\n\nStefano Valentini\n\nObscura (determinant)\n\nLiam O'Neal (As a Harbinger under the control of Theodore)\n\nA version of Sebastian stuck inside STEM (Determinant)\n\nThe Effigy\n\nMatriarch (Corrupted version of Myra Castellanos within STEM, Subjective due to the character not dying)\n\nNumerous counts of The Haunted\n\nNumerous counts of The Lost\n\nNumerous counts of AlterEgos\n\nNumerous counts of Disciples\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMyra Castellanos[]\n\n\"Myra... What an incredible woman. She really could do it all...\"\n\n―Sebastian\n\nSebastian met Myra on the job, and was smitten with her. After she is injured in the line of duty, Sebastian confesses how he feels to her, which she admitted to reciprocating. The pair began a relationship, which eventually lead to marriage, and a daughter they named Lily. Sebastian was shown to be a loving husband to Myra, albeit somewhat negligent as he worked hard.\n\nSebastian thinks very highly of her. He sees her as an amazing detective, and later on mother. He mentions often how in awe he is of her capabilities and perseverance, and tends to prop up her skills and abilities as far greater than his.\n\nAfter the fire that apparently killed Lily, Myra came to Sebastian claiming that Lily was still alive, having been kidnapped by a mysterious orginization. Sebastian tries to claim she needs rest and needs to accept Lily is gone. Myra eventually disappears, leading to Sebastian falling into a deep depression and turning to drink.\n\nUpon discovering Myra was right about Lily being alive he deeply regretted not having more faith in his wife. When he discovered that she was still alive, he did everything he could to apologise and reason with her to come home.\n\nAt the end, he shows full respect and understanding for Myra's decision of staying behind, listening to her and going through with the plan despite his reluctance in losing her again.\n\nLily Castellanos[]\n\nSebastian cared deeply for Lily, doting on her every chance he got. After the fire that apparently claimed her life, Sebastian became deeply depressed, which was only further increased when his wife also disappeared. He was haunted by his failure to save her, causing him to begin drinking heavily.\n\nUpon discovering that Lily was still alive, he agreed to reenter STEM in order to save her.\n\nJoseph Oda[]\n\n\"Krimson City needs more men like him on the force and it’s an honor to be working with him.\"\n\n―Sebastian, writing about Joseph\n\nDespite initially being optimistic about working with Joseph, Sebastian's slow descent into alcoholism has turned their partnership sour. Concerned with Sebastian’s safety, Joseph filled a report to Internal Affairs, which saved Sebastian his job, but created an emotional rift between them.\n\nDuring the events of the game, Sebastian shows dedication in protecting Joseph, going so far as to put Joseph's well-being above his. Despite the events of the past, the friendship that the two have is still very apparent.\n\nJuli Kidman[]\n\n\"There’s something about her that gets under my skin but I can’t quite put my finger on it.\"\n\n―Sebastian, writing about Kidman\n\nSebastian’s relationship with Kidman is strained. He is shown in an earlier memory to want to train her, insisting on it despite Joseph's warnings. However later on, presumably as he grew to know her, his opinion on the matter changed. He resents having to train her, going as far as to label it \"babysitting duty.\" In his journal he describes her as being aloof and standoffish, even going as far as calling her a cold fish. Kidman also took issue with the aggressive way Sebastian went about working his cases, much to Sebastian’s annoyance.\n\nBut despite this, he does however show worry and concern for her while surviving together, showing that Sebastian does care for Kidman. Not only that but it's seen multiple times in the two-parter DLC's, that when Kidman sees memories that involve Sebastian in it, she says that he shouldn't be involved and that him and Joseph don't have anything to do with this. This shows that Kidman cares for Sebastian and Joseph and she doesn't want them to get hurt.\n\nThere is a scene in both the main game and the Consequence where Sebastian meets up with her in the destroyed Krimson city. He saves her from multiple Haunted and they travel through other buildings together. They enter a room and Sebastian gets a \"Ruvik Headache.\" Sebastian sees his reflection in the window and realizes he's turning into a haunted. He tries to warn her to stay away but lost control of himself. He quickly charges at Kidman. While he does, Kidman sees Ruvik behind him. Since she has a better grasp of the situation (thanks to her previous encounters with Haunted Joseph), she manages to shoot Ruvik causing him to disappear. With Ruvik's hold on Sebastian gone, he ends up passing out, Kidman sees that he's leaning unconscious on her with his head on her left shoulder. While in this state, he turns back into a normal person and Kidman lies him on the ground.\n\nAfter this she leaves the room and locks the door behind her. Sebastian quickly wakes up and gets to his feet, he sees her on the other side of the door and he's angry because he thinks that she shot him. In an effort to keep him out of the way, she doesn't explain to him that she actually didn't shoot him, rather she says that she had no other choice and that she's going to leave him behind because Ruvik will use him to try and stop her. Later Kidman comes across the KCPD building and sees three memories. She learns about the tragic loss of Sebastian's daughter and his wife leaving him, which makes Kidman feel sorry for him and starts to show pity. After this when they meet again while she's about to shoot Leslie, she's unable to express this feeling while he is aiming a gun at her because she sees an illusion of The Administrator instead of him. She ends up makes their relationship even worse when she accidentally shoots Joseph.\n\nThey have another run-in later, when she's chasing Leslie. He tries to protect Leslie from her, he of course says he doesn't trust her since she shot both him and Joseph. She tries to explain that Leslie has to die in order for Ruvik not to get out. He however doesn't get a chance to understand before Ruvik arrives, Ruvik then turns Leslie into fluid and absorbs him into his consciousness.\n\nLater at the end, when Kidman is brought back into the real world, she finds Sebastian still unconscious in the tub. She saves him from being captured by MOBIUS by saying that he's dead. She then tells him, that she owes him one and that she hopes he finds what he's looking for (Myra and the truth).\n\nRuvik[]\n\nAt first, Sebastian doesn't really seem to understand who or what Ruvik is, but as his adventure continues, he is slowly shown more and more about who Ruvik is, and what the man has done. Witnessing firsthand the death and rebirth of Ruvik's sister, Laura Victoriano, as well as the collapsing of the barn they played in and many of the critical interactions between him and Dr. Jimenez. Relentless in his mission to escape the nightmarish world, Sebastian is forced to dispatch many beings under Ruvik's control, some even being gruesome manifestations of his past. Ruvik would then be forced to reveal his presence while absorbing a stream of red blood cells emanating from the corpses of his defeated pawns, proceeding to vanish shortly after. In the beginning, Ruvik referred to Sebastian as \"[his], to do with as he pleased\", but upon realizing that Sebastian would not waver in determination, he began treating him as a legitimate threat, purposefully altering the environment to force Sebastian to take more perilous routes, and eventually attempting to deal with him himself on several occasions. Sebastian soon comes to understand just who the man is, learning how he got his nickname, and seeing what will happen if he captures Leslie. Towards the end, Sebastian shows no remorse for him, angrily yelling things at times such as \"Trying to make me feel sorry for you?\" or \"You brought this upon yourself\".\n\nMarcelo Jimenez[]\n\nAfter startling Sebastian and explaining that he escaped the crashed ambulance too, they travel with each other for a fairly short period of time, Jimenez primarily relying on Sebastian to protect him, as he is a \"non-combatant\". Sebastian mostly just goes along with whatever the hysterical old man says, cooperating with his plan to escape Elk River, and later aiding him in retrieving his runaway patient, Leslie. After one of his lectures, Sebastian mutters to himself under his breath, referring to the doctor as a \"jerk\". Dr. Jimenez leaves Sebastian in the dark about a lot of things, which Sebastian eventually catches on to. On one of the occasions in which Sebastian is teleported to Dr. Jimenez' laboratory, he is forced to hold him up at gunpoint to get him to reveal information, such as how the world is run by Ruvik's mind, and how they could potentially use Leslie as a means of escape. From then on, Sebastian is quite sceptical of most things the doctor tells him, especially after seeing some of the flashbacks of him and Ruvik's past. When the Amalgam Alpha appears in Dr. Jimenez' laboratory, Sebastian calls to him, telling him to run, showing that he at least cared a little for the man.\n\nLeslie Withers[]\n\nSebastian pursues Leslie for the majority of the game, the patient constantly on the move. When Sebastian is able to stop the boy, he usually panics or escapes. Sebastian first introduces himself to Leslie in a cave nearby the shack where he battled Connelly. Leslie, later on, comes to recognize Sebastian as a nice person, referring to him by his name, guiding him, helping him out of a locked room, and even going to him for help when Juli is chasing him. Sebastian first responds to Leslie's panicked demeanor in irritation and confusion, muttering things like \"what the fuck?\" or \"what's wrong with this kid?\". However, Sebastian later comes to realize just how important the boy is, and goes out of his way to protect him at all costs. He thanks Leslie when he is able to help him out of a locked room, and calling out to him in defeat when Leslie accidentally activates a barrier between the two in Chapter 7. When Juli tries to kill the boy, Sebastian holds a gun up to her, bent on keeping him alive. When Leslie walks up to Ruvik and is reduced to brain goo, Sebastian screams in horror, showing that he knew the boy was vital, and that he presumably cared for him a little bit, despite them rarely being with one another for extended periods of time.\n\nOscar Connelly[]\n\nSebastian's relationship with Connelly is not heavily explored, but they do seem at least get along fairly well. While driving to the asylum, Sebastian appears willing to listen to Connelly's theories about what awaits them there, even though Connelly is simply a patrol officer and not a detective.\n\nAfter Connelly turns into a Haunted, Sebastian is shocked and horrified, showing that he did care for Connelly.\n\nTatiana Gutierrez[]\n\nDespite being one of the few entities in STEM not hostile towards him, Sebastian was initially confused by her presence and emotionless personality. Because she is the sole caretaker of the Safe Haven, however, Sebastian slowly comes to see her as an ally in his quests. Near the end of The Evil Within 2, Sebastian thanks her for being there for him during both of his journeys in STEM.\n\nStefano Valentini[]\n\nInitially, Sebastian didn't know who Stefano was as a person; however, as he traversed deeper into the bowels of Union he came to realize just how disturbed the photographer was, being violently thrust into all manner of scenarios mired in Stefano's so-called \"artwork\", always involving either a facet of one's countenance during the final moment before their death, or a mutilated semblance of body parts that he likened to sculptures. Sebastian held an immense disgust for Stefano, gradually worsening with every murder he witnessed, from cases he himself investigated during his time at KCPD, to the actresses lives that gave birth of one of Stefano's most prized works, Obscura, a camera and papier-mâché clad creature with limbs melded in, among many others. Sebastian's hatred for Stefano peaks when he stands by helplessly as he blows the heads off of an entire audience of innocent prisoners, at least one hundred. Furiously determined to save his daughter from the cruel fate Stefano devised for her in order to conduct his sinister hobby forever, he escaped the Aperture, confronting Valentini deeper within the Theater one last time, each of them fed up with the other's constant trickery. Sebastian defeats Stefano swiftly, and shoots the deranged serial killer in the eye with seemingly no remorse. Afterwards, when his photo is crossed off on Juli's bulletin, he even jokingly says \"A giant, red 'X'. Now that's what I call art.\"\n\nTheodore Wallace[]\n\nFrom the moment Sebastian met Theodore, he held suspicions of him, primarily given the juxtaposition of flames and immolated bodies surrounding his sanctum to his otherwise calm demeanor. Upon refusing to accompany Theodore and waking up in a mysterious cabin after being drenched in blood, Sebastian's opinion of him hardly changes, and given his newfound knowledge of the Father's desire to gain control of Union, he discusses the matter with his compatriots, and deduces that he will have to be eliminated should he interfere again. Sebastian gains a newfound understanding of Theodore's mind-control abilities when he is forced to indirectly murder Liam O'Neal, and, as a result, his animosity towards him grows tenfold.\n\nUpon a contrited Sebastian's return to Theodore's stronghold, he is met only with grisly and heavily reproachful imagery of his daughter conjured by Theodore himself. Dazed and confused, Sebastian is tricked into shooting Esmeralda in the stomach, later resulting in her becoming fatally wounded protecting Sebastian, who makes a recovery in Hoffman's safehouse, wrought with despair. Following an intense spiritual redemption, Sebastian ventures through Union, delves into the Bottomless Pit and scales Theodore's tower once more, this time prepared for everything Theodore can throw at him. Striking down many Disciples and Spawn along the way, Sebastian ascends to his throne room one final time, Wallace now threatening to murder his wife in front of his daughter. Hearing this, Sebastian furiously vows that he'll die before he lets such a fate befall them, and he plans on it.\n\nFlustered by Sebastian's newfound resiliance to guilt-inducing visions, he recomposes himself, promptly entering Sebastian's memory and summoning manifestations of the most fearsome foes that he encountered at Beacon. Sebastian conquers his fears and dispatches each of them, teleporting them each back form the carnageous scenario, a dumbfounded Theodore stumbling backwards into the podium room where the two first met. Even after the murder of Liam O'Neal, betrayal to Myra, and what he supposedly intended to use Lily for, Sebastian, while furious, didn't shoot Theodore even as he had him at gunpoint, possibly indicating he had some mercy for the fanatic, though he never appeared particularly phased after Myra impaled him. When visiting a decrepit safehous in Limbo, Sebastian even makes a passing remark about how he believed the former motivational speaker to be in hell now.\n\nLiam O'Neal[]\n\nLiam is the first person he meets in STEM that is not one of the Lost. When they first meet, Liam threatens him with a handgun, Sebastian promptly putting his down and kicking it across the room. They talk about why Liam is in STEM, and Sebastian notices that Liam left the safety on. He then walks up to Liam, takes his gun, and tells him a real soldier would've turned the safety off. Liam trusts Sebastian, to an extent, but the two don't get along as well as they could due to the fact Sebastian thinks he's cowardly, and Harbinger Liam recalls this when he say, \"I'm not weak anymore!\"\n\nYukiko Hoffman[]\n\nSebastian is initially critical of the mysterious psychologist when she interrogates him in her safehouse at gunpoint, though after several discussions between the two, he begins to warm up to her, occasionally even cracking jokes together, a lighthearted change of pace from her otherwise icy and serious personality during their adventures. By the time the two had realized they were the last survivors within STEM, they had each bonded to the point where they went out of their way to protect each other, Hoffman eventually even giving her life to save him, much to Sebastian's sorrow.\n\nJulian Sykes[]\n\nShould the player decide to save him from the mob of Lost, Sebastian is willing to help Sykes with his plan to escape from STEM by traversing the dank corridors of the Marrow to re-activate a set of servers, in exchange for Sykes' agreeing to unlock all of the orange chests throughout the Business District. Later, before Sebastian sets out for Theodore's stronghold, Sykes contacts him once again, this time asking him to secure the area surrounding the STEM bath in question, this time in exchange for instructions on a backup method of escaping Union with Lily. Sebastian is reluctant to let Sykes risk his life like this, due to the trusty partnership the two had formed. When Sebastian finds out that Sykes only had a 1 in 4 chance of leaving STEM through the bath, he maintains an optimistic outlook and claims that he might have made it out alive safely.\n\nEsmeralda Torres[]\n\nUnlike the vast majority of the MOBIUS staff, Sebastian actually treats Torres with a fair level of respect and trust, which doesn't change even after he learns that she was the culprit behind the fire that destroyed his family home and resulted in the kidnapping of his daughter. Torres and Sebastian have a good team dynamic and chemistry, and he certainly sees her as a valuable ally, which makes him feel deeply horrified when he learns that her death was partly because of him, and vows to avenge her death by killing Theodore Wallace.\n\nThe Administrator[]\n\nWhile certainly lacking the background that Kidman and him share, Sebastian does briefly meet the Administrator in The Evil Within 2, being brought into the advanced STEM room after Kidman tranquilized him in the bar. Though their interaction is brief, it is integral to the plot, as without the Administrator's manipulative offer, Sebastian wouldn't have re-entered STEM in the first place. After being briefed on what has happened to his daughter, and how the new STEM came to be, he enters, his last image before entering being The Administrator looking down on him through a window, striking his classic pose. After Sebastian leaves STEM, he pays no real thought to what happened to the Administrator, Kidman likely explaining at a later time.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSebastian's last name of Castellanos is a surname of Spanish origin, thus hinting at a Hispanic ancestry. The surname's roots could be traced back to its late Latin form of castellum, meaning \"castle\", and a \"castellan\" is a lord or governor of a castle district and overall a person of authority, which fits well with Sebastian's occupation as a senior police detective.\n\nIn the earlier drafts of the script where the game was supposed to take place in Spain, Sebastian was conceived as a native Spanish whose first name has a distinctively Hispanic pronunciation (Sebastián with an accent on the last syllable) before the diacritics were dropped in the final release.\n\nIn an earlier concept, Sebastian was among the people who set the barn Ruvik and Laura were playing in ablaze. The story was ultimately changed, however, as the developers wanted the audience to sympathize with the protagonist.\n\nAlso mentioned in The Art of The Evil Within, Sebastian originally had no daughter, and the source of his depression was from the passing of his wife, who weren't given much characterisation at all in the concept drafts.\n\nThe trench coat Sebastian wears at the very beginning of the first game was given to him by his wife, Myra. It is mentioned in the artbook that he feels its loss is significant to the events taking place.\n\nHe can be seen wearing his trench coat during the reveal trailer for The Evil Within 2. However, he doesn't wear the coat during the game at any point, instead wearing a canvas jacket prior to being approached by Kidman.\n\nThe trench coat is seen hanging on a coat stand in Sebastian's Room inside his office.\n\nSebastian is implied to be an old-fashioned policeman, as he still favors the old service revolver, even though most of his department have switched to semi-automatic pistols by the time the first game took place. While he does carry one of the latter for emergencies, his sidearm of choice is a revolver and his shoulder holster is one made for a six-shooter. The description of the revolver from the second game all but confirms this to be the case.\n\nHe started smoking at some point after joining the KCPD. After escaping from the Sadist in Chapter 1, he pulls a pack of cigarettes out of his vest, only to throw it away moments later when he realizes that it was empty. He later utilizes matches against The Haunted.\n\nHis drink of choice is whiskey, since he mentions it specifically in one of his journal entries.\n\nAccording to a newspaper clipping, Sebastian used to live (and possibly still does) in the Park Ridge neighbourhood of Krimson City.\n\nSebastian uses reading glasses, as they can be found on his office desk in the KCPD flashback Juli Kidman witnesses.\n\nIn The Evil Within 2, due to leftover game assets, PC players can enable/disable a pair of glasses on Sebastian.\n\nThematically, Sebastian and Juli's mode of saving progress seems to relate to things that are considered to be \"bad omens\". For Sebastian, to enter Safe Haven and his room, he has to enter it through a broken mirror. For Juli, to save her progress she sits on a leather couch with a black cat.\n\nSebastian is considered to be a stereotypical hardboiled detective in-universe, as pointed out by Kidman in The Consequence. He drinks, smokes, wears a coat and is very hard-boiled personality-wise, all traits associated with these kinds of detectives.\n\nIn his journal, Sebastian admits to believing that you sometimes have to \"bend the rulebook a bit\" to break a case. This apparently put him at odds with Juli Kidman, who he thought was opposed to such tactics.\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, it was revealed in the Kidman DLCs that Kidman was a juvenile delinquent before MOBIUS took her in. In The Evil Within 2, Sebastian remarks that Kidman would've made a great detective, to which she refutes.\n\nIn The Evil Within 2, Sebastian's more light-hearted moments, like the ones in the Shooting Range, gives a good idea of how he could have been like in his early years, if his journal entries and flashbacks are anything to go by.\n\nThe reveal trailer for The Evil Within 2 depicts the burning house scene from the prologue with Sebastian wearing his default attire instead of the unlockable Professional outfit as in the game proper.\n\nThe main promotional cover for The Evil Within 2 depicts Sebastian's wedding ring as gold, instead of silver.\n\nSebastian's old model from the first game is reused in the sequel during the segments where he has to revisit a mental recreation of Beacon Mental Hospital. It also appears in several Photographic Slides along with the pre-art shift model of Juli Kidman, though this use is inconsistent, given how Sebastian is depicted using the new model in specific slides.\n\nDespite being a supposedly seasoned police detective, Sebastian still handles most of his sidearms with an improper \"teacupping\" stance in the first game. While this seems to have been mostly rectified by him switching to a more tactical Weaver stance in the sequel, he still aims the Revolver with his arm outstretched.\n\nSebastian's exact birthdate can be confirmed in The Consequence, shown briefly towards the end on the STEM terminal hooked up to his bath before Juli frees him.\n\nIn the first game, visible on the back of Sebastian’s left hand appears to be the faded remnants of an old tattoo. In gameplay, from different angles and lighting conditions, (as well as in certain in-game cutscenes), the speculated tattoo can be clearly seen. In the game’s Model Viewer, under “Sebastian Castellanos” and “Sebastian Castellanos (Trench Coat)”, the tattoo can actually be zoomed-in-on and examined from different angles. The tattoo itself possibly seems to be of a symmetrical design, set in black ink, and is visible starting from his left wrist and degrading in clarity as it reaches his knuckles. The design, meaning, origin and condition of the tattoo are never explained or even mentioned in the game’s narrative.\n\nGallery[]\n\nThe Evil Within[]\n\nPromotional and Concept Art[]\n\nGifs[]\n\nOther[]\n\nThe Evil Within 2[]\n\nPromotional and Concept Art[]\n\nScreenshots[]\n\nOthers[]\n\nCharacters and Creatures of The Evil Within Gameplay • Chapters • Characters & Creatures • Weapons & Equipment\n\nProtagonists\n\nSebastian Castellanos • Juli Kidman • Pedro Martin\n\nAllies\n\nJoseph Oda • Leslie Withers? • Tatiana Gutierrez? • Black Cat? • Marcelo Jimenez† • Oscar Connelly†\n\nVictoriano Family\n\nRuben Victoriano? • Laura Victoriano† • Ernesto Victoriano† • Beatriz Victoriano†\n\nMOBIUS\n\nThe Administrator • Myra Castellanos\n\nMinor Characters\n\nMarta Martin • Lily Castellanos? • Juanita Flores† • Valerio Jimenez† • Victoriano Mystery Man†\n\nMissing Persons\n\nArnold Brown? • Fernando Carbrera? • Chris Taylor? • Patrick Higgins? • Salvador Graciano? • Ivan Diaz†\n\nLegend: Alive, Ambiguous fate?, Deceased†\n\nCharacter status at the end of The Evil Within, future plotline deaths notwithstanding.\n\nCommon\n\nThe Haunted (Cadaver • Doppelganger) • AlterEgo • The Babies\n\nSpecial\n\nShigyo • Trauma • Neun† • Zehn† • Heresy† • Juli Doppelgangers†\n\nBosses\n\nThe Keeper? • Laura? • Sentinel? • Sadist† • The Dark Keeper† • Quell† • Amalgam Alpha† • Shade†\n\n• Amalgam†\n\nLegend: Active, Determinant fate?, Deceased†\n\nCreature status at the end of The Evil Within."
