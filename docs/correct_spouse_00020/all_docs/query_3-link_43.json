        "text": "Guy Sebastian has revealed an unknown fact about his relationship with wife Jules.\n\nThe Voice Australia judge, 41, sat down with Nat Barr and Matt ‘Shirvo’ Shirvington in a Sunrise interview, sharing everything from his new hit ‘I Chose Good’ to Sunday Week’s Voice finale.\n\nBut it was a confession about his love life with Jules that had everyone shocked.\n\n20 years ago, Sebastian won Australian Idol as “the 21-year-old boy from Adelaide with the fro” and with Jules by his side.\n\nBut before his iconic victory, Jules — who had been with the budding singer since he was 18 — broke things off.\n\nSebastian reveals she “broke” his heart, and that he “didn’t think” they would get back together.\n\nAlas, 20 years later, the couple – both originally from Adelaide – are now happily married with two kids.\n\n“You live a little bit of life then you realise, ‘Oh, my gosh, I had so much history, she always loved me for me,” Sebastian added.\n\n“She’s always been the same.”\n\nThe singer-songwriter also shared that he was the only boyfriend his wife had.\n\n“That’s always a positive when she hasn’t got some other beautiful Latin lover or something to compare me to... or a Matt Shirvington,” he laughed.\n\nShirvington burst into laughter, throwing his paper to the ground.\n\n“This is strange, sitting in the middle of this,” Barr laughed.\n\nThe former Olympian said he had been in a similar situation to the Elevator Love singer, having met his wife Jessica when they were both teenagers.\n\n“There is something about it, because my wife and I, Jess, we had the same sort of relationship,” he said.\n\n“So there’s a purity to it, there’s a magic about it, and you grow together; not just be together, you grow together.”\n\nSebastian agreed, saying it was special knowing “each other’s childhood and where you both came from”.\n\n“I think she’s very loving, very smart and emotionally intelligent and so there’s so much that I lack where... I might blow up over something and it’s always Jules who is my calming force that will help me see things a bit more clearly.\n\n“And me, her as well. I think we balance each other out well. I love her more now than ever so it’s amazing.”\n\nGuy and Jules married in May 2008 and reside in Sydney with their boys, Hudson, 11, and Archer, nine.\n\nThe singer’s latest hit ‘I Chose Good’ is dedicated to his long-time lover.\n\nHe’s hoping Team Guy can take out The Voice 2023 with 25-year-old British-Australian singer-songwriter Charlie Pittman."
