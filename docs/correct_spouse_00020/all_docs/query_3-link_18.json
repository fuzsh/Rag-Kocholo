        "text": "Guy Sebastian and his wife Jules have long been considered “couple goals” - a special partnership that others look up to and wish to emulate for themselves.\n\nBut the Voice Australia judge has surprised with a confession on Sunrise, that you can watch in the video above, revealing that before the pair married, Jules “broke up” with him ahead of his Australian Idol victory.\n\nThe couple, originally from Adelaide, began dating before Guy found fame on the talent show in 2003.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nAfter winning the series, the singer packed up his life and moved to Sydney to pursue his career, but not before Jules “broke my heart”.\n\n“I didn’t think we would get back together,” Guy told Natalie Barr and Matt Shirvington on Wednesday.\n\n“I was 18 when we first got together and I think I was 21 (when we broke up) and she kind of broke my heart.\n\n“She broke up with me and then Idol happened and I moved to Sydney and I didn’t think we’d get back together, I wasn’t sure.\n\n“But you live a little bit of life then you realise, ‘Oh, my gosh, I had so much history, she always loved me for me.’\n\n“She’s always been the same.”\n\nThe 41-year-old revealed he was the only boyfriend his wife had.\n\n“That’s always a positive when she hasn’t got some other beautiful Latin lover or something to compare me to... or a Matt Shirvington,” he teased.\n\nShirvo burst into laughter, throwing his notes to the side of the couch in surprise.\n\n“This is strange, sitting in the middle of this,” Natalie laughed.\n\nShirvo said he had been in a similar situation to Guy, having met his wife Jessica when they were both teenagers.\n\n“There is something about it, because my wife and I, Jess, we had the same sort of relationship,” the co-host said.\n\n“So there’s a purity to it, there’s a magic about it, and you grow together; not just be together, you grow together.”\n\nGuy nodded before adding there was something special about knowing “each other’s childhood and where you both came from”.\n\n“I think she’s very loving, very smart and emotionally intelligent and so there’s so much that I lack where... I might blow up over something and it’s always Jules who is my calming force that will help me see things a bit more clearly.\n\n“And me, her as well. I think we balance each other out well. I love her more now than ever so it’s amazing.”\n\nGuy and Jules married in May 2008 and are proud parents to two boys, Hudson, 11, and Archer, nine.\n\nThe singer’s latest hit I Chose Good has been dedicated to his wife.\n\nFor more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
