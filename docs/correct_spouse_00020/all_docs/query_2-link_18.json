        "text": "\"Carice and Guy are thrilled to be expecting their first child,\" a publicist for van Houten has confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBoth Pearce and Van Houten have tweeted in acknowledgement of the reports.\n\n\"I'm ready for your shadowbaby jokes,\" Van Houten said.\n\n\"Nothing like the prospect of a shadowbaby to change your mind about becoming a father!\" Pearce said.\n\nThe word \"shadowbaby\" refers to Van Houten's character on Game of Thrones, the priestess Melisandre, who gave birth to a shadow demon which was sent to assassinate Renly Baratheon.\n\nPearce's 18-year marriage to psychologist Kate Mestitz ended in October, 2015. He said in a statement in January: \"Kate and I will always love and support one another and be the best of friends. No-one knows me like Kate does, and we'll forever be appreciative of our mutual respect.\n\n\"We've both grown enormously through our relationship, but sadly, the time has come to part ways.\"\n\nThe couple did not have children. Pearce spoke about their decision to be childless in 2012 when promoting his film Prometheus.\n\n\"I'm not consistent enough to be a parent - I blow too hot and cold. Kate jokes that we'd end up on the news for throwing a child out of the window,\" he said.\n\nPearce was born in the UK and his family emigrated to Australia when he was a child.\n\nHe made his television debut as an actor in the long-running soap opera Neighbours in 1985, playing Mike Young. The popularity of the series, and his prominence in the cast, turned him into a household name alongside its other emerging stars, Kylie Minogue, Craig McLachlan and Jason Donovan.\n\nThough he had a number of smaller film roles to his name, Pearce's first major film was 1994's The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\nThat film served as a launchpad for Pearce in the United States; his subsequent film credits include The Time Machine, Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo and LA Confidential.\n\nSince 2012 he has starred in the ABC drama Jack Irish, based on the series of novels by Peter Temple. Pearce also released in first album in 2014, titled Broken Bones."
