        "text": "“Black Book” is exactly the kind of brave, bare-chested Dutch Resistance movie you’d expect if the director of “Showgirls” remade “The Diary of Anne Frank.”\n\nWhen our Jewish heroine purrs to a Nazi occupation commander, “I’d love to see your stamp collection,” and he replies, “But it’s enormous!” mein Gott in himmel, the fireworks!\n\nDon’t think the Zionist-Aryan sexy talk is a mistake or overinterpretation. Not when Paul Verhoeven is directing. His expensive, expansive epic – 2 1/2 hours or three Dutch chocolate bars – is meant to redeem his wayward career with a rousing Resistance flair. Instead, we get an R-rated “Hogan’s Heroes.”\n\nOur heroine’s entire family gunned down while escaping on a river tug? She pouts a little, then resumes diligently dyeing her pubic hair so those devilish Nazis won’t figure out her ethnic, er, roots. When her ruse is discovered, a manly Dutchman fondles her naked bosom and leers, “Are these Jewish?” Hmmm. I don’t think there’s a kosher answer to that.\n\nWhat was “Black Book” supposed to be, exactly? We first meet Rachel (Carice van Houten) in demure teacher’s garb on an Israeli kibbutz, shortly after the war. Flashback to her initial Dutch hiding place, in the countryside with a dour farm family. Rachel doesn’t seem too worried about her missing real family, taking time out to sail the nearby shores with a new boyfriend, until the farmhouse is accidently bombed. Oops – time to flee. Don’t forget to pack those show tunes!\n\nThe Perils of Rachel continue in the big city. She’s asked to befriend the local Nazis to save some captured resistance fighters, and Rachel throws her brave body wholeheartedly into the task. She plans a little birthday party for der Fuhrer, sings sassy songs for Colonel Klink, and forces us all to endure some full-frontal Nazi male nudity. (Max Schmeling, these tubby lieutenants definitely are not.)\n\nThe fighting scenes are taken less seriously than your average high school drama production. Storm troopers break into the resistance meeting hall and a firefight ensues – the second it’s over, the rebels laugh and button up their stolen uniforms. Verhoeven and his cast seem to mean well, but lack the wisdom to understand the import of what they’re portraying.\n\nThe plot tricks are just that – gimmicks from Hogan’s book. The old chloroform- over-the-mouth trick, the blueprints-of-city-hall trick, the hiding-the-microphone-in-the-bra trick. It’s all so campy, it becomes an odd form of entertainment, so bad it’s almost good.\n\nVerhoeven, who actually directed a minor Resistance classic with 1977’s “Soldier of Orange,” hasn’t seemed like a serious filmmaker for some time. If “Black Book” was his ticket for redemption, he’s been shunted off to some other siding. This one comes with a laugh track.\n\nLandmark’s Chez Artiste Theatre.\n\n“Black Book”\n\nR for nudity, sexuality, war movie violence, profanity | 2 hours, 24 minutes\n\n| PERIOD DRAMA | Directed by Paul Verhoeven; written by Verhoeven and\n\nGerard Soeteman; photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub; starring Carice\n\nVanHouten, Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman, Halina Reijn and Waldemar Kobus\n\n| Opens today at Landmark’s Chez Artiste Theatre."
