        "text": "Carice Anouk van Houten (born 5 September 1976) is a Dutch award-winning actress, best-known to English-speaking audiences for her roles in Repo Men, Valkyrie and Black Death (alongside Game of Thrones actors Sean Bean and Emun Elliott). She has won five Golden Calf (Dutch: Gouden Kalf) awards for acting. She starred in the award winning movie Undercover Kitty (Minoes). A very popular actress in the Netherlands, she starred in the lead role of Black Book, the most commercially successful Dutch film in history.\n\nIn Game of Thrones, Van Houten played the role of Melisandre of Asshai. She was confirmed for the role on 19 July 2011. She was a new starring cast member for the second season. Van Houten discussed her role in an interview with Cyril Falisse from the Ferryman Critical on February 22, 2012. She said \"I think I am only in episodes 1, 2, 4 and 10 or something. You are not going to see me that much but in season 3 that we are going to shoot this summer I'll come back with a vengeance.\" Regarding her role she said \"I'm [Stannis'] right hand. I manipulate him. I take the decisions for him almost. I wouldn't say I'm a very sympathetic character. I have a great wig, great red hair. I hope I did it right.\"[1]\n\nCredits[]\n\nStarring[]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 2 The North Remembers The Night Lands What Is Dead May Never Die Garden of Bones The Ghost of Harrenhal The Old Gods and the New A Man Without Honor The Prince of Winterfell Blackwater Valar Morghulis\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 3 Valar Dohaeris Dark Wings, Dark Words Walk of Punishment And Now His Watch Is Ended Kissed by Fire The Climb The Bear and the Maiden Fair Second Sons The Rains of Castamere Mhysa\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 4 Two Swords The Lion and the Rose Breaker of Chains Oathkeeper First of His Name The Laws of Gods and Men Mockingbird The Mountain and the Viper The Watchers on the Wall The Children\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 5 The Wars To Come The House of Black and White High Sparrow Sons of the Harpy Kill the Boy Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken The Gift Hardhome The Dance of Dragons Mother's Mercy\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 6 The Red Woman Home Oathbreaker Book of the Stranger The Door Blood of My Blood The Broken Man No One Battle of the Bastards The Winds of Winter\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 7 Dragonstone Stormborn The Queen's Justice The Spoils of War Eastwatch Beyond the Wall The Dragon and the Wolf\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 8 Winterfell A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms The Long Night The Last of the Starks The Bells The Iron Throne\n\nFilmography[]\n\n3 Ronden - Emily (1997)\n\nSuzy Q - Suzy (1999)\n\nAmnesiA - Sandra (2001)\n\nMinoes - Minoes (2001)\n\nFather's Affair - Monika (2003)\n\nBonkers (Knetter) - Lis (2005)\n\nBlack Book - Rachel Stein (2006)\n\nLove Is All - Kiki Jollema (2007)\n\nDorothy Mills - Jane (2008)\n\nValkyrie - Nina von Stauffenberg (2008)\n\nKomt een vrouw bij de dokter - Carmen (2009)\n\nDe gelukkige huisvrouw - Lea (2010)\n\nRepo Men - Carol (2010)\n\nBlack Death - Langiva (2010)\n\nIn therapie - Aya (2010)\n\nBlack Butterflies - Ingrid Jonker (2011)\n\nIntruders - Susanna (2011)\n\nGame of Thrones - Melisandre (2012-2019)\n\nAlles is familie - Winnie de Roover (2012)\n\nJackie - Sofie (2012)\n\nBrimstone - Anna (2016)\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nCarice van Houten was originally asked to audition for the role of Cersei Lannister. [2] However, schedule conflicts prevented her from auditioning. She was subsequently asked to audition for the role of Melisandre and was cast in this role instead. [3] She later said, \"it all turned out for the best, because Lena couldn't be a better Cersei.\" [4]\n\nVan Houten made a parody appearance as Melisandre in a 2016 skit on Late Night with Seth Meyers.[5]\n\nSee also[]\n\nCarice van Houten on Wikipedia\n\nCarice van Houten on IMDb\n\nCarice van Houten on X\n\nCarice van Houten on Instagram"
