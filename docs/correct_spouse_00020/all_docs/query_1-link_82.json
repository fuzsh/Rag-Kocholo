        "text": "Given that this is a film from Paul Verhoeven - the man who gave us the sexploitative Basic Instinct and Showgirls - there's a lot in Black Book to be appalled by. There's an excess of flesh, for example (including a scene in which the heroine dyes her pubic hair - and is then groped by a fellow resistance fighter). And plenty of misogyny (such as the heroine having a huge bucket of excrement dumped on her).\n\nBut for once Verhoeven's trademark neglect of morality is apposite. After all, Black Book is an intense examination of the moral ambivalence of war, and that both sides are capable of barbarity and cynicism. The film is set in the Netherlands in late 1944, as the resistance slowly gains the upper hand over the Nazi occupiers - who respond with increasing depravity and corruption. Through the travails of singer-turned-resistance fighter Rachel Steinn (Carice van Houten), the film shows that no side - and not even ostensible non-combatants - is exempt from depravity or corruption.\n\nVan Houten (left) gives a remarkable performance. As Steinn, she sees her family slaughtered by the Nazis, as they try to flee. As a result, she joins the resistance and, transformed into blonde secretary-cum-revue singer Ellis de Vries, she's given the job of seducing and coaxing information from leading German official Muntze (Sebastian Koch). As the end of the war nears, the relationship between the pair - and their links to people on both sides of the conflict - undergo surprising twists and betrayals.\n\nBlack Book works remarkably well as a suspenseful thriller, with fine performances all round. Beneath Verhoeven's penchant for sexualised imagery, the film provides two hours of taut viewing. Whether such titillation is necessary, given the scintillating narrative, is debatable.\n\nBlack Book opens today"
