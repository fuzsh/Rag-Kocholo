But lets say that they had healthy heirs, then I imagine that Portugal would be a much stronger power later on, as they didn’t have those long years of Spanish control\n\n@RedAquilla @galik @isabella @Viriato @Lusitania @All other Portuguese posters. D. Sebastião seems to be getting a lot of attentio on the board lately.\n\nAs to children, I'd venture that the chance of \"issue\" would be the same as with Isabel Clara Eugenia, or an alt-daughter of Felipe II and Mary Tudor, but less than with someone reasonably \"unrelated\" like Margot de Valois (closest common ancestor would be Mary of Burgundy's mom IIRC) or a daughter of Elizabeth I or Mary, Queen of Scots (husband dependent).\n\nWell, it would be another cousin marriage between already inbred dynasties, so I imagine that their kids wouldn’t be the healthiest in the world, if any were to survive.

Nevertheless, it would become increasingly allied with Spain and Austria I'd imagine.\n\nBut lets say that they had healthy heirs, then I imagine that Portugal would be a much stronger power later on, as they didn’t have those long years of Spanish control\n\nIf they have a surviving son, yes.\n\nIf only daughters survive, obviously, Philip II would want the eldest one to marry the future Philip III.\n\nWould it be possible for her to marry someone else and maintain an independant Portugal?\n\nIf so, who else could she marry?\n\nAlso, Elisabeth marrying Sebastian implies Charles IX of France would marry someone else. This might save the Valois. Charles IX was fertile and only bad luck prevented him to father a legitimate son before dying. Butterlies and an ATL wife may give him a son.\n\nThat would lead to Charles' brother Henry remaining king of Poland and Sigismund Vasa remaining king of Sweden.\n\nIf they have a surviving son, yes.\n\nIf only daughters survive, obviously, Philip II would want the eldest one to marry the future Philip III.\n\nWould it be possible for her to marry someone else and maintain an independant Portugal?\n\nIf so, who else could she marry?\n\nI'd prefer for Elisabeth and Sebastian to have a son. However, if they only have a daughter(s), then she would likely marry a surviving Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias. An interesting match that would avoid the Habsburgs would be Henry 2nd, Duke of Lorraine or his youngest brother (to avoid a personal union).\n\nAlso, Elisabeth marrying Sebastian implies Charles IX of France would marry someone else.

In terms of seniority, the Farnese come out ahead.

In fact, he and the duke of Savoy are possibly far more likely candidates than the duke of Lorraine.

Which is why I said it wasn't directly related. Also, 16th century Europe isn't my most knowledgeable era in history so I wouldn't of known that the Duke of Savoy was a more likely candidate.\n\nNevertheless, I want to avoid a Habsburg Portugal; are there other potential candidates?\n\nI was referencing the first part of the second paragraph of your post about the seniority as while the Braganzas were favoured, they weren't the most senior.

Caterina de Medici touted her own credentials (fictional though they were, since they came from a first spouse while Caterina descrnded from the person's second spouse IIRC, but it was enough for Auber to write an opera on the subject: The Crown Diamonds).\n\nD. Juan of Austria (if he's surviving) may also have an interest (he's not TECHNICALLY a Habsburg), since one of the \"fake Sebastians\" convinced D. Juan's daughters (the one locked in a convent) to marry him according to a contemporaneous report by the Venetian ambassador.\n\nIt is true that both Sebastian and Elisabeth shared the same ancestors with Sebastian having only 4 great-grandparents instead of the usual 8 and Elisabeth having 6. For great-grandparents, Sebastian only had 6 instead of the usual 16 and Elisabeth had 10. While this would have not precluded them from having children, a less consanguineous marriage might produce healthier offspring.\n\nThere had been discussions with the French court about Sebastian marrying Margaret of Valois whom was only Sebastian's third-cousin twice removed and she surprisingly for a royal, she had 16 distinct great-grandparents, none of whom were shared with Sebastian."
