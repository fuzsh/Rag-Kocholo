        "text": "Congratulations to Game of Thrones star Carice van Houten and Guy Pearce who have welcomed a baby boy together! Proud new daddy Guy tweeted the happy news on Monday morning, writing: \"A cute little package arrived and told us his name's Monte Pearce. We think we're gonna keep him. Placenta smoothie anyone?\"\n\nCarice - who stars as Melisandre, the Red Woman, on the hit HBO show - retweeted Guy's announcement, adding a series of emojis alongside, including a baby, a roller coaster and heart eyes.\n\nGuy Pearce and Carice van Houten have welcomed their first child together\n\nGuy and Carice announced that they were expecting a child together back in March, sharing a few light-hearted tweets that referred to her sinister GOT character.\n\n\"Yes, it's true. Let the shadowbaby jokes begin,\" the 39-year-old actress teased on Twitter, while Guy, 48, wrote: \"Nothing like a shadowbaby to change your mind about becoming a father!!\"\n\n\"Almost don't fit the mirror anymore...\"\n\nBaby Monte is the first child for both Carice and Guy, who was previously married to psychologist Kate Mestitz from 1997 until 2015.\n\nThe Dutch actress has been keeping her followers up-to-date throughout her pregnancy. In July, she posted a mirror selfie, in which she showed off her baby bump, along with the caption: \"Almost don't fit the mirror anymore @TheGuyPearce.\"\n\nAnother image shows her looking unimpressed while holding a gift from her mum. \"You know you're seriously pregnant when you mother starts buying you a 'grabber',\" she wrote alongside.\n\n\"You know you're seriously pregnant when you mother starts buying you a 'grabber'\"\n\nAs well as Game of Thrones, Carice is known for her role in Valkyrie alongside Tom Cruise, and Repo Men, with Jude Law and Forest Whitaker.\n\nHer partner, meanwhile, is famous for movies including LA Confidential, Memento and Iron Man 3. Before hitting the big time in Hollywood, he starred as Mike Young in Australian soap Neighbours, from 1986 until 1989."
