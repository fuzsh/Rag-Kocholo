        "text": "Bio:\n\nCarice Van Houten (born on September 5, 1976 in Leiderdorp, Netherlands) is a Dutch actress and singer. She is most widely recognized for her role as Melisandre on Game of Thrones. She’s also had roles alongside Tom Cruise in Valkyrie and Jude Law in Repo Men. She’s won five Golden Calf Awards, an acclaimed award at the Netherlands Film Festival. She is also a skilled singer. Carice released a pop-rock album titled See You On The Ice in 2012.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nCarice is best known for playing Melisandre on the HBO hit Game of Thrones.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nCarice dated Sebastian Koch from 2005 to 2010. In March 2016, she announced she was expecting her first child with Guy Pearce.\n\nSpoiler alert: Stop reading if you haven’t watched the April 22 episode of ‘Game of Thrones!’\n\nIf your children ever ask you where babies come from, for the love of Westeros, don’t show them the final scene from this week’s Game of Thrones. Childbirth is gross enough as it is without the unholy image of Melisandre (Carice van Houten) screaming and pushing a full-grown shadow creature out of her priestess hoo-ha. I guess Stannis (Stephen Dillane) finally got that son he was hoping for, even if he does share partial paternity with the Lord of Light. I don’t envy whoever has to fill out that birth certificate."
