        "text": "German, English, French, and Jewish; Spanish (SebastiÃ¡n): from the personal name Sebastian, Latin Sebastianus, borne by a 3rd-century Christian saint. This was originally an ethnic name meaning âman from Sebastiaâ, a city in Pontus named from Greek sebastos âreveredâ (the Greek equivalent of Augustus). This surname is also sometimes borne by Jews, presumably as an adoption of the German surname."
