        "text": "Australian actor (born 1967)\n\nNot to be confused with Guy Pearse.\n\nGuy Edward Pearce (born 5 October 1967) is an Australian[1] actor. He is the recipient of various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award as well as a nomination for a Golden Globe Award.\n\nHe started his career portraying Mike Young in the Australian television series Neighbours. Pearce received international attention for his breakout role in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) and subsequently took starring roles in Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential (1997), Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000) and Simon Wells's The Time Machine (2002). He is also known for his performances in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road (2009), Kathryn Bigelow's war drama The Hurt Locker (2009) and Tom Hooper's historical drama The King's Speech (2010). He has appeared in TED 2023, Prometheus (both 2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017) as Peter Weyland, the Marvel action film Iron Man 3 (2013) as Aldrich Killian, and the historical biopic Mary Queen of Scots (2018) as William Cecil.\n\nIn Australian cinema, Pearce has appeared in The Proposition (2005), Animal Kingdom (2010), 33 Postcards (2011), The Rover (2014), Holding the Man (2015) and The Wizards of Aus (2016). Since 2012, he has played the title role in the TV adaptations of the Jack Irish stories by Australian crime writer Peter Temple. Pearce starred in Todd Haynes' limited series Mildred Pierce (2011) and the HBO crime miniseries Mare of Easttown. The former won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\n\nPearce was born on 5 October 1967 in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.[2][3] His father, Stuart Pearce, was a Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot and RAF test pilot, and his mother, Anne Cocking (née Pickering), was an English schoolteacher.[4] He has an elder sister, Tracy.[5] When Pearce was three years old, the family relocated to Geelong, Victoria, Australia. When he was eight years old, Pearce's father died in an aircraft accident.[3][6][7][8]\n\nPearce attended Geelong College, and was a member of the Geelong Society of Operatic and Dramatic Arts (GSODA) Junior Players. At the age of 16, he was a competitive amateur bodybuilder, leading to the title of Junior Mr. Victoria. He lived in Box Hill North, Victoria in the late 1980s while working on the Australian drama series Neighbours. His first film appearance, while still at Geelong College, was in a Victorian Vice Chancellors-funded film Life and Study at University, produced and directed by Peter Lane of Deakin University.\n\nPearce transitioned to television when he was cast in the Australian soap opera Neighbours in 1986, playing the role of Mike Young for three years, a role which he reprised in 2022 for the show's final episode. Pearce also found roles in other television series such as Home and Away (1988) and Snowy River: The McGregor Saga (1993).\n\nThe director/producer/writer Frank Howson cast Pearce in his first three films, Heaven Tonight, Hunting and Flynn, and paid for him to go to the Cannes Film Festival in 1991 for the premiere of the Howson-directed Hunting. The accompanying Howson-funded publicity campaign brought Pearce to the attention of the international film industry. He made his first major film breakthrough shortly after, with his role as a drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 1994. Since then, he has appeared in several US productions including L.A. Confidential, Ravenous, Rules of Engagement, Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo and The Time Machine.\n\nPearce portrayed pop artist Andy Warhol in Factory Girl and Harry Houdini in Death Defying Acts. He also appeared in The Road and in Bedtime Stories with Adam Sandler.[9] Pearce continued to perform in Australian films, such as The Hard Word (2002) and The Proposition (2005), written by fellow Australian Nick Cave.\n\nIn January 2009, Pearce returned to the stage after a seven-year absence.[10] He performed in the Melbourne Theatre Company's production of Poor Boy, a play with music, co-written by Matt Cameron and Tim Finn.[10]\n\nIn 2009, he portrayed Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson in The Hurt Locker. In 2010, he appeared as David, Prince of Wales, who became King Edward VIII, in The King's Speech. Both films won the Academy Award for Best Picture, making Pearce the first actor to appear in back-to-back Best Picture winners since Michael Peña (who appeared in Million Dollar Baby and Crash).\n\nPearce starred as the eponymous lead in the Australian TV miniseries Jack Irish, an adaptation of the detective novels of author Peter Temple broadcast on the ABC network in 2012. In May 2012, Pearce was cast to star in David Michôd's The Rover. In 2013, Pearce played the villain character Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3.\n\nPearce appeared in a documentary special celebrating Neighbours' 30th anniversary, Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.[11][12] Pearce had a supporting role in Neil Armfield's 2015 romantic-drama film Holding the Man, as Dick Conigrave.\n\nIn 1989, Pearce released the single \"Call of the Wild\" from the soundtrack Heaven Tonight. The song peaked at number 156 on the ARIA Charts.[13]\n\nPearce appeared in Australian band Silverchair's music video for \"Across the Night\" and in Razorlight's video for \"Before I Fall to Pieces.\" He recorded the soundtrack for A Slipping-Down Life, singing and playing guitar on cover versions of songs by Ron Sexsmith, Vic Chesnutt and Robyn Hitchcock.\n\nPearce released his first album, Broken Bones, in November 2014.[14] Pearce released his second studio album, The Nomad, in 2018.[15]\n\nHe appeared in the video for the song \"Follow Me Around\" by Radiohead.\n\nPearce married his childhood sweetheart, psychologist Kate Mestitz, in March 1997.[16][17] In October 2015, Pearce announced their divorce.[18] Pearce is in a relationship with Dutch actress Carice van Houten; they had a son in August 2016.[19][20][21]\n\nPearce supports charitable organisations for causes, especially those related to animal conservation and habitat preservation.[22]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1990 Heaven Tonight Paul Dysart 1991 Hunting Sharp 1994 The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert Adam Whitely / Felicia Jollygoodfellow 1996 Dating the Enemy Brett/Tash 1997 Flynn Errol Flynn L.A.
