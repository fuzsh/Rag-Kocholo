Placenta smoothie anyone? @caricevhouten.\"\n\nThe Red Woman star confirmed she was expecting in March following the couple announcing they were an item earlier in the year.\n\nGuy is most recognised for appearing in blockbusters such as Iron Man 3 and LA Confidential, after playing Ramsay Street's Mike Young.\n\nThe pair have kept fans updated throughout Carice's pregnancy, and in mid-July she showcased her ever-expanding middle.\n\n\"Almost don't fit the mirror anymore @TheGuyPearce…\" she captioned the blooming photo, while pouting away.\n\nGuy replied, quipping: \"Wait, did I do this? How did that happen? Oh, now I remember…\"\n\nCarice previously dated Dutch director Kees van Nieuwkerk and Sebastian Koch, her co-star in Black Book, while Guy was married to his his childhood sweetheart, psychologist Kate Mestitz, for 18 years."
