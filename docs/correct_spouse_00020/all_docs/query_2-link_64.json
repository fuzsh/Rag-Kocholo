        "text": "No, not this one…\n\n… or this one (I love that song!)…\n\n… but this one, the existence of which I only discovered two days ago!\n\nJackie is a Dutch movie from 2012 starring real-life sisters Carice van Houten (left, known to some through Game of Thrones), Jelka van Houten (on the right) and Holly Hunter.\n\nI was flipping through channels the other day (which I hardly ever do anymore as Dutch TV has so little to offer that interests me) and stumbled on the beginning of this movie called Jackie. For some reason I was instantly drawn in. I think it was the no-nonsense approach, the swift set up of the story and then I saw Holly Hunter, whom I like as an actress, and I became even more curious. Of course, 15 or so minutes into the movie there was a commercial break and as I can’t stand commercial breaks during movies, I decided to not finish watching it that evening. I watched it yesterday evening instead, with no commercials breaking the magic of the story unfolding.\n\nJackie is about twin sisters, Sofie (Carice van Houten) and Danielle, Daan for short (Jelka van Houten), who were born through a surrogate mother and grew up in Amsterdam with their dads. Sofie is a career woman, Daan is married and trying to have a baby with her husband. At a dinner with their dads Sofie tells the family that she received an unexpected call from America where she was told that their birth mother is in a hospital with a complicated broken leg and needs transport to a rehab facility.\n\nCurious to find out who the woman is that gave birth to them, the girls decide to fly to New Mexico to meet her. They find a dishevelled, intense woman who doesn’t speak much and seems hostile towards them and life in general.\n\nAs they can’t fly to the rehab facility due to Jackie’s medical issues, they give in to travelling in Jackie’s beat up old RV instead. What ensues is this road trip, with the necessary obstacles thrown in, where both sisters try to deal with what’s thrown at them and also deal with long-distance controlling situations at home while they try to forge some sort of relationship with this woman who gave birth to them. Meanwhile, Jackie is bewildered by her two daughters but is also slowly drawn to them.\n\nI don’t quite understand why this movie struck such a chord with me. I was reading some reviews after I watched it where it said that this was pretty cliché road movie fare, that the twist at the end should have happened sooner, that it was annoying that Jackie never explained anything about herself, that the women were all flat and devoid of feeling (what? I really didn’t get that criticism) and yet… I loved everything about this movie! The mix of Dutch and English was really fun to hear, it’s how I speak at home as well, I loved the dynamic between the two sisters, I loved the intensity of Holly Hunter, I loved the three leads in their roles. I even loved that there was not much explaining, these women just are as they are, no explanations necessary. The story really is a snapshot of a certain time in these three women’s lives and how this road trip brings each one closer to their own true selves and each other. At the end, each woman is able to move forward in their own unique way. There was serious stuff going on, but there were funny and light-hearted moments as well. The part that made me smile most was when the two sisters were in the front singing along with the radio to this fun, upbeat song and Jackie was enjoying herself in the back…\n\nI also felt that the New Mexico backdrop fit the story very well. The landscape is not only empty and stark, it also has some beautiful hidden treasures, which I thought somehow mirrored these women as well. Yep, I loved this movie, I think I even dreamt of it last night, I have been re-watching bits and pieces this morning and now I’m blogging about it. I tend to not love most Dutch movies so much, but this one really did it for me. Here’s a trailer…\n\nIt’s available on Dutch Netflix, so maybe also on Netflix where you are, should this have made you curious…"
