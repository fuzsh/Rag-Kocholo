        "text": "Guy and Jules Sebastian both celebrate their birthdays in October, which can prove a bit tricky when it comes to marking each occasion separately.\n\nNot to mention the fact that by the time you have been married for 15 years, you run out of gift ideas.\n\nBut not this year. This year, Guy \"really nailed it\" according to Jules. He told his wife he'd booked a beautiful hotel room for her to share... with her best friend Samantha Jade.\n\nREAD MORE: Check out these artificial Christmas trees that deliver to your door\n\n\"So me and Sammy also went for a girl's weekend,\" Jules tells 9Honey. \"He goes, I know that you want to be with her.\n\n\"It was amazing.\"\n\nGuy received a piece of jewellery for his birthday to add to his collection.\n\nREAD MORE: Warning before buying $79 Taylor tickets\n\nThe couple normally save giving each other \"big ticket items\" for their birthday and keep Christmas more low-key, except for their boys Hudson, 11, and Archie, nine.\n\nShe says her son's personalities are \"very different.\"\n\n\"I think Hudson's like Guy and Archie's like me,\" she says, adding that \"for the most part they get along.\"\n\n\"Hudson plays AFL in the winter and basketball, they're both really into basketball... Archie plays soccer and cricket.\"\n\nHis dad plays cricket too, which can be a long and tiring game, but they love it.\n\nJules plays netball, and has done since she was young.\n\n\"I've got a broken finger right now from playing netball,\" she says, showing her left ring finger. \"I've rejoined an indoor netball team and I'm currently injured because apparently 40-year-old people cannot play!\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nNine gorgeous party dresses you'll never want to take off\n\n\"I've enjoyed football my whole life and then took some time off to have the children. I'm actually really surprised at the muscle memory,\" she says.\n\n\"I played my first game and I was like oh I remember exactly how to play this game and my body is doing exactly what I want it to do.\"\n\nJules plays Goal Attack and, by the sounds of it, does really well – broken fingers aside.\n\nPlaying sport comes naturally to the family, as does eating as healthily as possible. Jules has recently partnered up with Sunny Queen Farms who has released a delicious range of Mini Fritters and Protein Bites in \"Bubble & Squeak\" flavour and \"Ham & Cheese,\" the latter being the boy's favourites.\n\nGuy and Jules eat them too, in between sporting endeavours and their endless appointments and gigs.\n\nREAD MORE: Common bulk buying mistakes most people make\n\n\"I like to sometimes put them in their lunch boxes, or I'll just make them before they get home from school, put them in the fridge and then they're gone before I know it,\" Jules says.\n\n\"You can even have them for breakfast. I know, the brunch, after school snacks, pre-school snacks, anything.\"\n\nIf they're not having frittatas for breakfast, Jules prepares instant oats.\n\n\"We're in a real porridge phase right now for breakfast,\" she says. \"Just like quick oats, a bit of milk, a bit of honey, a bit of like fruit on top, strawberries and blueberries. And they're just smashing that right now.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Christmas plans Jules and Guy will be hosting this year and Jules is looking forward to the experience of serving delicious food to her loved ones.\n\nAnd she already knows what her boys will want for Christmas gifts.\n\n\"They are just after Pokémon cards and cash this year,\" she shares. \"I'll get them some other things. You have to have something to wrap.\""
