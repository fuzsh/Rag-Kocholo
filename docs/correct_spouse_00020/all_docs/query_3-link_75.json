        "text": "Sebastian Eubank's wife has shared the touching last moments of her husband's life before his tragic death on a beach in Dubai.\n\nThe 29-year-old passed away last week and wife Salma Abdelati has now confirmed he suffered a \"massive heart attack\" while in the sea and \"probably could not have been saved\" even if he was on dry land.\n\nShe added that the post-mortem showed there was evidence he had a pre-existing condition that none of the family were aware of.\n\nDespite the devastating events, Salma took some solace from the hours leading up to Sebastian's death and detailed his final moments.\n\n\"While still very painful it is of some comfort that Sebastian died after having one of his favourite meals with one of his closest friends whilst doing his favourite thing at his favourite place in Dubai where he often went to swim,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"He was standing in the water close to shore watching the sunset at Cove Beach in Dubai.\"\n\nThe pair have a newborn son, Raheem, together, who is just a month old.\n\nSalma added: \"I am grateful that he was able to spend a few short and happy weeks with his son before his death.\"\n\nSebastian - known as 'Alka Lion' - followed his father Chris and brother Chris Junior into boxing, fighting three times as a professional, before switching to MMA upon his move to the Middle East.\n\nBoxing legend Chris first broke the news in a statement, reading: \"Never did I ever imagine I would write these words or experience the feeling I now have at the loss of my son.\n\n\"My family and I are devastated to hear of the death of Sebastian just days before what would have been his 30th birthday.\"\n\nHe also described his son as \"a leader in the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and of alternative therapies\", adding: \"as well as being a personal trainer and professional boxer, Sebastian was also a deep thinker who liked to challenge accepted wisdom.\"\n\nTributes have poured in from across the boxing community, but none more poignant than from his older brother Chris Junior, who wrote on social media the day after Sebastian's death: \"I haven’t cried since I was 12 years old… yesterday I cried the whole day.\n\n\"I’m sorry I wasn’t there to watch your back like a big brother’s supposed to. Can’t believe you’re really gone man but you’ll always be in my heart, mind & spirit.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Chris Junior said: \"Now your legacy will live on through your beautiful new born son & I will treat him like my own. Watch over us until we meet again young lion.\"\n\nHe also urged his followers not to \"take any of your loved ones for granted. See them, speak to them, check up on them as much as you possibly can because you just never know if that one time will be the last time. Love you bro.\""
