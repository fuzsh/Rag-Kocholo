        "text": "It wasn’t exactly love at first sight for singer Guy Sebastian and his wife Jules - and it hasn’t always been smooth sailing, as the Australian Idol winner and The Voice coach revealed on Sunrise this week.\n\nGuy was chatting to Sunrise co-hosts Natalie Barr and Matt Shirvington on Wednesday when he confessed that they broke up as a couple before their marriage, a split that left him heartbroken.\n\nThe split happened before Guy had even auditioned for Australian Idol back in 2003 - so how did they manage to get things back on track?\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nWell, that’s a long story.\n\nGuy and Jules met as kids, singing in the same local school choir in Adelaide.\n\nSpeaking to Mamamia in 2021, Jules candidly revealed that, at first, she barely noticed Guy.\n\n“We were amongst our group of friends and I knew who he was and I knew he was around, but I never really noticed him until we were asked to sing together at a mutual friend’s wedding,” she revealed.\n\n“It was the first time I actually noticed him.\n\n“I wouldn’t say that I was head over heels, but I was like, ‘Oh, you’re kind of cute. I’ve never really noticed you before’.”\n\nRecalled Guy: “It’s pretty cheesy, we had to learn this really cheesy love song ... We’re looking into each other’s eyes, singing these lyrics and some sparks flew, and you know we’re still together.”\n\nThey started out as good friends, but things took a romantic turn when Guy was 18 and Jules was 20.\n\nLater, Guy would say that having a bedrock of friendship first would bode well for their later married life, helping them get through any tough patches together.\n\nSpeaking to 60 Minutes in 2020, he described Jules as “a gem and she’s my rock”.\n\nBut three years after they first got together, Jules unceremoniously dumped him.\n\n“She kind of broke my heart,” Guy said, admitting he had often put his love of music and sport before his girlfriend.\n\n“She broke up with me and then Idol happened and I moved to Sydney and I didn’t think we’d get back together, I wasn’t sure.\n\n“But you live a little bit of life then you realise, ‘Oh, my gosh, I had so much history, she always loved me for me.’\n\n“She’s always been the same.”\n\nGuy admitted on the Kylie & Jackie O Show in 2017 that he had been a bit of a “douche” before the split.\n\n“I was a rubbish boyfriend and I was never there … I was not a gentleman,” he said.\n\n“I didn’t believe in opening doors.\n\n“It took her breaking up with me for me to realise I was being a douche.”\n\nIt was during their time apart that Guy had a brief relationship with singer Delta Goodrem, who recently became engaged to musician Matthew Copley.\n\n“To be honest, it was so brief,” Guy told Who of his time with Delta, noting that one of their “dates” involved watching a Harry Potter film together.\n\n“We were never girlfriend and boyfriend, we were literally just seeing each other.”\n\nAfter that, Jules and Guy reconnected, with the relationship turning into a long-distance one for several years when Guy moved from Adelaide to Sydney to capitalise on his Idol success.\n\nJules eventually moved to Sydney too, and for five years they rode the wave of Guy’s post-Idol fame.\n\nIn 2008, they tied the knot in Manly, NSW.\n\nOn Instagram, Guy explained how he went about popping the question to Jules.\n\nThe couple was visiting Hervey Bay in Queensland, where he had just bought an investment property.\n\n“I was pretending that we were holidaying there and I said let’s go for a walk down the beach,” he revealed during a 2020 Instagram Live.\n\n“There’s a nice stretch of beach that’s not very populated so I thought it’d be nice and quiet.\n\n“We got to ... where this house that I had bought (was) and there’s a bench that overlooks the water and we sat on that bench and I got on my knee.\n\n“I did it really fast because I was really nervous.\n\n“I didn’t even have a speech, I wasn’t like ‘We’ve been together for this long...’”\n\nAdded Jules: “It was literally like we sat down and as soon as his butt hit the bench, he was on the ground with the ring.”\n\nFast forward 15 years and two sons later (Hudson, born in 2012, and Archer in 2014) and the couple is still happily married.\n\nTheir 15th wedding anniversary was in May 2023, with Jules paying tribute to her husband on Instagram.\n\n“Married to the best person I know for 15 years today,” she wrote, sharing a throwback photo from their wedding day.\n\nAfter becoming parents, Guy said he had a “newfound love” for his wife.\n\n“I think you have a newfound love for your partner when you see them in a role like that, nurturing and looking after the people that matter most to you,” Guy told Who magazine.\n\nSpeaking on Sunrise on Wednesday, Guy said Jules was “very loving, very smart and emotionally intelligent”.\n\n“I might blow up over something and it’s always Jules who is my calming force that will help me see things a bit more clearly,” he said.\n\n“And me, her as well.\n\n“I think we balance each other out well.\n\n“I love her more now than ever so it’s amazing.”\n\nFor more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
