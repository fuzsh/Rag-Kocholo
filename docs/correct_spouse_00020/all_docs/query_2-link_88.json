        "text": "The Red Woman just had another baby -- and this one is thankfully smoke-free.\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" star Carice Van Houten just welcomed her first child with partner Guy Pearce (\"Memento,\" \"L.A. Confidential\").\n\nPearce, 48, announced the news himself this morning on Twitter, with Van Houten re-tweeting the announcement.\n\nThe two keep a relatively low-profile about their relationship, having never appeared at a public event together since hooking up. They have been active on Twitter when it comes to Van Houten's pregnancy though.\n\nLast month, Carice -- who plays Melisandre on the HBO series -- posted a pic of her big baby bump, with the caption, \"Almost don't fit the mirror anymore.\" Pearce re-tweeted the pic, giving his own silly caption:\n\nThe duo also beat fans to the Smoke Baby punchline when they announced the baby-to-be back in March.\n\nCongrats to the duo!"
