They lived in Melbourne, Victoria, for several years before moving back to Adelaide due to Ivan's work as a geologist.[41]\n\nAs a child, Sebastian took violin lessons; he would later learn to play guitar, drums and piano, although he has had no formal training in these other musical instruments. After attending St Paul's College, Gilles Plains in 1991, Sebastian attended King's Baptist Grammar School after his family moved to Golden Grove.

Following his Idol win Sebastian was required to record his debut album in six days, but despite this time restriction the album included three songs co-written by him.[46] He then travelled to the UK to compete in World Idol.

The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio.[73] Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis in a series of blogs for Australian newspapers, \"I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. I mean, they are mostly in their late 60s and have such a wealth of experience.\"[74] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, \"This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. [...] he just took us by storm.\"[75] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008.[76] The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year.[3][77] The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008.[78][79] Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs.[80] AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.[81]\n\nThe MGs came to Australia in February 2008 to be Sebastian's backing band for his national tour. He spoke on radio about what it felt like fronting the MGs, \"There were so many moments when I just had to take a step back and think 'This is unbelievable'. Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. You know they start playing Dock of the Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar.\"[82] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, \"hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis, Tennessee. [...] It just filled our hearts.\"[83] One of the Melbourne concerts was filmed for a live DVD/CD titled The Memphis Tour.[84] Sebastian was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Performance in an Australian Contemporary Concert for The Memphis Tour, and was awarded two Australian Club Entertainment Awards, best Original Music Performer and Outstanding Club Performer of the Year.[85][86] The Memphis Album received a nomination for Highest Selling Album at the 2008 ARIA Awards, his third album to be nominated in this ARIA Awards category.[22] He travelled to the US several times after The Memphis Tour to write for his fifth album, spending time with Cropper in Nashville on these trips.[87][88]\n\nIn 2008 Sebastian was signed to release an album in the US, and in November he returned to America to work on it. He recorded songs with John Mayer's band, and John Mayer himself played guitar and sang backing vocals on three of the tracks.[89] He moved to New York in early 2009 to prepare for the release of the US album which was a mix of Memphis soul covers and original songs.[90] He performed showcases at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin Texas, and a residency at the Drom in New York.[91][92][93] His song \"Like It Like That\" was chosen as the theme song for the NBC network's summer promotional campaign.[94][95] The US release was then delayed due to restructuring of Victor Records, but it was later reaffirmed the album would be released in 2010.[96] \"Like It Like That\", the title track of Sebastian's fifth album, was released in Australia in August 2009 and reached number one.[3] It was the highest selling Australian artist song in 2009, and achieved 4× platinum certification.[97][98] Like It Like That, an original soul album with all songs written or co-written by Sebastian, was released in October 2009.

Reviewers almost unanimously agreed he had captured the spirit and essence of the Memphis soul classics.[78] It was the critical and public reception for The Memphis Album which gave Sebastian the confidence to stay with the soul genre for his fifth album, Like It Like That. In an interview with The Age he said he was told early in his career, \"If you self-indulge and just do what you're into, you're going to corner your market. Soul music isn't big here.\" but \"the most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted me to make a record like this one. Because I realised that this isn't obscure music.\"[179]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe said: \"Sometimes it takes four records, with a detour into 'concepts' covers territory to find where you fit. Sebastian has found his niche with Like It Like That, which expertly balances the line between radio friendly pop and classic soul.\"[180] Paul Cashmere from Undercover wrote: \"By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation.\"[181] In an interview for the release of his seventh album Armageddon, Sebastian spoke of how much The Memphis Album still influences his music: \"I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched in that sort of environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'. [...] From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing.\"[182]\n\nSebastian began writing songs before entering Australian Idol. \"All I Need Is You\", the second single from his debut album Just as I Am was written when he was a teenager, and fine-tuned during his time on Idol.[41] He also wrote gospel songs for his church during his teenage years. One of them, \"Adore\", was included in their 2004 album Paradise Live: Adore.[183] Sebastian wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on his albums Beautiful Life and Closer to the Sun, and all the tracks on his albums Like It Like That and Armageddon. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, Kathy McCabe said of his songwriting skills, \"Sebastian has matured into a genuine hitmaker, his gift with melody so finely-honed he can pretty much punch out a catchy number in his sleep.\"[184] Jamie Horne wrote in The Border Mail, \"The inaugural winner's longevity [...] can be attributed to the fact that he's an accomplished musician and songwriter\" and AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien said, \"it's a testament to his vocal abilities and songwriting skills that, unlike many of his fellow winners, he's remained popular enough to see out his rather ambitious Sony contract [...] a subtle and natural progression with each album, explains why he's managed to survive once the show's publicity machine died down.\"[185][186]\n\nIn 2008 \"Receive the Power\", a gospel song written by Sebastian and Gary Pinto, was chosen as the official anthem for the Roman Catholic Church's XXIII World Youth Day.[187] \"Art of Love\", co-written by Adam Reilly, was shortlisted for the APRA Song of the Year in 2010.[188] \"All to Myself\", written with Carl Dimataga, and \"Who's That Girl\" were shortlisted for the 2011 APRA Song of the Year, with \"Who's That Girl\" winning the APRA Award for Urban Work of the Year.[189][190] \"Don't Worry Be Happy\" was shortlisted for the 2012 APRA Song of the Year.[191] \"Battle Scars\" won the R&B/Hip category in the 2013 International Songwriting Competition. \"Get Along\" was a finalist in the Pop/Top 40 category, and was awarded an honourable mention.[192][193] \"Get Along\" was also one of the final five nominees for the 2013 APRA Song of the Year.[194] \"Set in Stone\" was shortlisted for the 2017 APRA Song of the Year, and \"Black & Blue\" was nominated for Pop Work of the Year.[195][196]\n\nSebastian has a worldwide, long term publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing.[197] He has written songs for other artists, including co-writing \"Dot Com\", a song performed by Usher on Rhythm City Volume One: Caught Up.[198] He also has an interest in production and co-produced The Memphis Album with Steve Cropper.
