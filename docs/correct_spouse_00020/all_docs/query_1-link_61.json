        "text": "Affair, The\n\nThe Affair is a tale of thwarted romance that spans decades. It aims to be an epic saga illustrating how war, governmental policy, cultural shifts, and geography place invisible barriers that keep two lovers apart for a generation during the m...\n\nBlack Book\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Paul Verhoeven made a name for himself in Hollywood, directing such high-profile films as Robocop, Basic Instinct, and Starship Troopers. Before arriving in America, however, Verhoeven had a flourishing career in the Netherl...\n\nDomino\n\nAt one time, a new Brian De Palma film was something to be greeted with enthusiasm. The filmmaker, with his affinity for borrowing from the greats (Hitchcock in particular), understood how to put his own, modern spin on classic tropes. His rep...\n\nFifth Estate, The\n\nPerhaps the most curious and counterproductive aspect of The Fifth Estate, the so-called \"Wikileaks movie,\" is the decision by director Bill Condon and screenwriter Josh Singer to establish the film as a thriller.

Opting for a straightforward telling of a (mostly) true story, the filmmakers have moved forward with an abundance of reverence. I’m reminded of 2013’s...\n\nRepo Men\n\nRepo Men feels like it was cobbled together using pieces of other, often better motion pictures. I could provide a list of titles but it would be more comprehensive simply to state that if a movie is set on a less-than-optimistic future Earth, some...\n\nValkyrie\n\nGoing into this film, I wondered whether the filmmakers would succeed at generating tension out of an event whose outcome is so well-known.
