        "text": "Sebastian Bach (Canadian singer and songwriter) achieved mainstream success as the frontman of Skid Row's heavy metal band. He was always seen beside her lovely wife (now separated), Maria Aquinar. The couple used to show up on interviews together and embodied love and a successful relationship in the entertainment industry. However, the two divorced, to the disappointment of fans that vouched for the lovely relationship. Of course, Maria had gained immense fame for being associated with the singer. So, how much do you know about her?\n\nIndeed, it is never easy living in the limelight. The constant follow-up by tabloids and fans is just unbearable. A misstep and you are national news. But entertainers have no choice as it comes with the career. Their spouses, however, are, in most cases, in for a rude shock as they gain popularity fast by association.\n\nFor instance, who knew Sebastian Bach's wife before their lovely union? Now, she is national news, people looking for more information about her current state after splitting with her husband. So what is her story, and where is she today?\n\nMaria Aquinar's profile summary\n\nName: Maria Sandra Muir Aquinar\n\nDate of birth: December 23, 1963\n\nAge: 58 years old as of 2021\n\nZodiac sign: Capricon\n\nHeight: 5 feet 7 inches\n\nWeight: 103 lbs or 47 kg\n\nBody measurement: 35D-24-32 inches\n\nSpouse: Sebastian Bach (1992-2010)\n\nChildren: Paris Francis Bach, London Siddhartha Halford Bach, Sebastiana Maria Chantal Bach\n\nWho is Maria Aquinar?\n\nMaria Aquinar is the ex-wife of Canadian singer and songwriter Sebastian Bach.

The couple had separated two months earlier.\n\nWhy did Sebastian and Maria separate?\n\nIn an interview with revolver magazine, Sebastian reiterated and confirmed that the internet was the primary culprit of her divorce.\n\nWhen you go on tour starting in the mid-‘80s, and then someone invents the internet in, like, 1996, you're pretty much fu$%ed. I mean, the sh$t on these websites is the reason my three kids don't have a father right now. You can go online, and there's a c%$k chart where you can check out my rig, and find these chicks typing whatever they want to type.\n\nOn top of this, Bach blamed a 2010 book, The Last Living Slut: Born In Iran, Bred Backstage, penned by self-professed groupie named Roxana Shirazi, for his divorce. He states that there are a lot of lies about him in the book when he toured with GUNS N' ROSES in 2006.\n\nYou read the book, and it's like, I'm backstage with a case of di$dos that I'm using on all these different women. Dude, can I tell you something? I do not travel on the road with a case of di$dos. That never f%$ing happened. But my ex-wife doesn't give a f$%ck. She's in Barnes & Noble reading this, and that it's like, what are you gonna do? I said to my lawyer, ‘Should I sue?’ And he said, ‘All you are going to do is make the book bigger.’\n\nQuick facts about Maria Aquinar\n\nWhen did she meet Sebastian Bach?
