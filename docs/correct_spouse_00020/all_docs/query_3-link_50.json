        "text": "In a new interview with \"Whiplash\", the KLOS radio show hosted by Full Metal Jackie, former SKID ROW singer Sebastian Bach spoke about the inspiration for the title of his upcoming solo album, \"Child Within The Man\", set for release on May 10 via Reigning Phoenix Music. He said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): \"Well, my wife calls me man-child. That's kind of been a theme for me my whole career. I bring a youthful energy to the stage when I get up there. People are smiling and excited and hooting and hollering. But the line 'child within the man' is a line of one of the songs on the record. And I scream it like bloody murder. And it kept haunting me. \"\n\nSebastian also talked about the \"Child Within The Man\" artwork, which holds special meaning since it was designed by Bach's father, noted visual artist David Bierk.\n\n\"I have a lot of my dad's artwork,\" Bach said. \"He's no longer alive. And we all, all of his kids, we got a lot of his art when he passed away. And I unrolled a roll of paintings that I knew had the SKID ROW 'Subhuman Race' painting in it, and I wanna take care of it and make sure it's preserved. But in that roll was this painting that I remember my dad doing of me when I was 10 in a field next to this beat-up old Cadillac car in the field and then behind the car, it's Jesus ascending into heaven, and I'm running next to the car. It looks like an album cover. And then he also did a painting of me from Circus magazine, the first centerfold of me on stage at Giants Stadium. He did a gigantic painting of that, like 12 feet high. And so the cover is gonna be me running as a child into me on stage as a man, and it's child within the man. And it just reminds me of the '70s, like child in time, and it just reminds me of a good '70s album cover. And the fact that I can bring back a painting from the year 1978 and make it into artwork in 2023, 2024, that's really mind-blowing to me.\"\n\n\"Child Within The Man\" was recorded in Orlando, Florida; produced and mixed by Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette; engineered by Jef Moll, assistant engineered by Josh Saldate and mastered by Robert Ludwig of Gateway Mastering. Bach wrote or co-wrote all the album's 11 tracks and sang all lead and backing vocals.\n\n\"Child Within The Man\" features guest appearances from John 5 (MÖTLEY CRÜE, ROB ZOMBIE, MARILYN MANSON),Steve Stevens (BILLY IDOL) and Orianthi (ALICE COOPER, MICHAEL JACKSON) — who all co-wrote their respective tracks with Bach — and two tracks co-written with ALTER BRIDGE's Myles Kennedy (\"What Do I Got to Lose?\" and \"To Live Again\"). Devin Bronson (guitars),Todd Kerns (bass) and Jeremy Colson (drums) round out the players on the album. The album will be available on jewelcase CD, cassette, and double LP in a variety of colour options.\n\n\"Child Within The Man\" track listing is as follows:\n\n01. Everybody Bleeds\n\n02. Freedom (featuring John 5)\n\n03. (Hold On) To The Dream\n\n04. What Do I Got To Lose?\n\n05. Hard Darkness\n\n06. Future Of Youth (featuring Orianthi)\n\n07. Vendetta\n\n08. F.U. (featuring Steve Stevens)\n\n09. Crucify Me\n\n10. About To Break\n\n11. To Live Again\n\nThe album's first single, \"What Do I Got To Lose?\", was co-written by Sebastian, Kennedy and Baskette, the latter of whom also served as the track's producer.\n\nIn advance of the album's release, Bach will hit the road in 2024 for an international tour with dates in Latin and North America. The \"What Do I Got To Lose?\" tour is a mix of solo gigs and festival appearances that kicks off with an international run of performances in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile before North American shows in the U.S. and Mexico. The stateside tour gets underway May 10 in Jefferson, Louisiana before wrapping June 29 in San Diego, California.\n\nBach performed \"What Do I Got To Lose?\" live for the first time during his February 24 concert at Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nBach released the official music video for \"What Do I Got To Lose?\" in December. The clip was directed by Jim Louvau and Tony Aguilera. For the video, which shows Bach cruising through the desert in a convertible and performing with a full band, Sebastian was joined by his former SKID ROW bandmate, drummer Rob Affuso. The clip also features an appearance by actor and comedian Craig Gass and Sebastian's wife Suzanne, who plays a scantily clad car wash attendant.\n\nBach hasn't released a full-length disc since \"Give 'Em Hell\", which came out in March 2014. Like its predecessor, 2011's \"Kicking & Screaming\", the disc was released through Frontiers Music Srl, the Italian label which specializes in what's commonly called AOR, a term that once signified a popular radio format (\"album-oriented rock\") but nowadays applies to acts whose airplay is marginal."
