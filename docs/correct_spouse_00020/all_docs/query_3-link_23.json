Or smack them. Or both.\n\nCould stand others, but ... he's so cute! And a programmer, and a geek, and a bit of a goth, and he's pretty much everything I fall all over myself for, and even likes sushi... so ... there I am, forcing myself through the painful process of fishing just to give him prezzies.\n\nHusband told me \"Oh, yeah, that's the developer's character. Betcha he's the one the dev says 'that's me' in the game\".\n\nSo I looked on the wiki - figured I'd prove him wrong by showing him that the others were also decent spouses, just in different ways...\n\nSebastian's the only one who is listed making breakfast, doing chores, and generally being a good spouse.\n\nHubby's gloating. *laugh*\n\nSO - has anyone found out otherwise? Is Sebastian really the best character to marry? Ape, is he suspiciously akin to you?\n\nI want to know. If Seb is the only fleshed-out spouse, I have some suggestions to make others better (maybe Haley gathers flowers, for example). If he's not, the wiki needs an update and I'd like to find out.\n\n-Sevi\n\nDoes she feed only during the winter or all the time? I'm creating an account to add to the wiki lol - someone should!"
