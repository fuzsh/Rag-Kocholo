        "text": "WMU Home > About WMU > WMU News\n\nAward-winning Dutch film comes to Little Theatre\n\nJuly 10, 2007\n\nKALAMAZOO--The Kalamazoo Film Society presents \"Black Book,\" an award-winning film about the World War II Nazi-occupied Netherlands, Friday through Sunday, July 13-15, in the Little Theatre at Western Michigan University.\n\nShow times for \"Black Book\" are 7 and 9:45 p.m. Friday; 4, 7 and 9:45 p.m. Saturday; and 2:30 and 5:15 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $5 and $3 for students.\n\nCarice van Houten and Sebastian Koch star in this stylish, sexy and violent tale of espionage and wartime melodrama. Set during the final days of World War II, it tells the story of a young Jewish singer (van Houten) who loses her family, joins the Dutch resistance movement and begins an intimate relationship with a German general (Koch). The screenplay for \"Black Book,\" which won nine international film awards, took nearly 20 years to write. With a budget close to 16 million euros ($21.8 million), it is the most expensive Dutch movie to date.\n\nThe 2006 film has a run time of 145 minutes and is rated \"R\" for some strong violence, graphic nudity, sexuality and language. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, \"Black Book\" is shown in Dutch, German, English and Hebrew with English subtitles.\n\nThe Little Theatre is located at the corner of Oakland Drive and Oliver Street on WMU's East Campus. Free off-street parking is available behind the theatre.
