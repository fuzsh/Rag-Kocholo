Carice van Houten and Guy Pearce are celebrating after welcoming their first child together.

The Dutch actress - Game of Thrones' Melisandre, of course - revealed that the couple were expecting back in March (with "shadowbaby" jokes and everything).

Turns out British-Australian Pearce can be just as funny as his girlfriend, as he tweeted on Monday (August 29): "A cute little package arrived and told us his name's Monte Pearce. We think we're gonna keep him. Placenta smoothie anyone?"

Cute. But also: ewwww.

But we'll forgive him, as Van Houten soon jumped in with her own telling of the story of Monte's arrival in emoji form.

Pearce and Van Houten met after working together in 2015 on the Western thriller Brimstone.

The actor split from childhood sweetheart Kate Mestitz after 18 years of marriage in January 2014.

Van Houten was in a relationship with Dutch director Kees van Nieuwkerk from 2013 till 2015, and previously dated actor Sebastian Koch.
