Given they spent considerable time on set filming their upcoming flick Brimstone together, it's understandable that Guy Pearce and his co-star Carice Van Houten have formed a close bond.

And on Sunday the couple appeared cosy and very much comfortable in one another's company as they sat waiting in a car hire depot in Los Angeles.

The pair were photographed after claims emerged claiming that the pair are in a relationship.

Dutch publication De Telegraaf published a report stating that Carice was 'totally in love' with her co-star in November.

A spokesperson for both Guy and Carice have been contacted for comment.

In the images from the weekend the 39-year-old Game Of Thrones actress is seen with her leg propped up on Guy's limbs as they wait for a vehicle.

The couple appear extremely relaxed and as they sit patiently Guy is seen putting his hand on Carice's leg.

In the images the Dutch actress is seen sporting a casual look consisting of a pair of rolled up jeans, a bright blue jacket and a pair of white trainers.

The Momento star opted for a striped top, a pair of dark jeans and a pair of blue suede Adidas trainers.

Prior to their Los Angeles jaunt the pair were spotted together in the Netherlands earlier this month, fuelling rumours of romance.

The reports of a romance between the pair came just a month after Guy announced that he and wife of 18-years had split.

In October a representative for the Britain-born Geelong-raised actor confirmed that Guy and psychologist Kate Mestitz had ended their marriage.

In a statement the pair, who met when they were teenagers, said they had 'decided it was time in January.'

Carice, who stars as Melisandre in Game Of Thrones was previously linked to her Black Book co-star Sebastian Koch.

The pair began dating in 2005 but called time on their romance in March 2010.
