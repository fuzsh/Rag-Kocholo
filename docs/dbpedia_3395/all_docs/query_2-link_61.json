        "text": "It was in a small room on the campus of the State University of Campinas, in Barão Geraldo, that the history of Editora da Unicamp began. Institutionalized in December 1982, the organization has reached 40 years as a reference in the publishing market, with more than 1,2 published titles. O Journal of Unicamp heard from 12 characters, including former directors and active employees, who helped to amalgamate this trajectory, which will be the subject, among other actions, of an exhibition to be opened on May 13th (Friday), at the Cesar Lattes Central Library.\n\nListen to the audio from Rádio Unicamp about the exhibition.\n\nLinguist Edwiges Morato, director of the Unicamp Publishing House and professor at the Institute of Language Studies (IEL), reveals that the exhibition commemorating the Editora's 40th anniversary includes a set of events and celebration of milestones of editorial and academic interest relating to the year 2022.\n\nAccording to the director, in this context, an exhibition is also planned in June with titles from the catalog that refer to the bicentenary of Independence, the centenary of the Modern Art Week and the one hundred years of the rise of fascism. In September, continues Edwiges, the Book Festival will take place in the Unicamp gymnasium, which will be accompanied by the seminar “Discussing Brazil and the world”, organized by the Editorial Board.\n\n“The perception of the Editora as an academic and cultural entity, part of the university body, is the main guide for the editorial policies and initiatives of the current management”, reveals Edwiges, who has been in the position for a year.\n\nAmong the priorities of her mandate, the director highlights the dynamization of communication, the opening and expansion of lines, Collections and Editorial Series, the promotion of seminars and academic events associated with editorial production and documentary actions aimed at disseminating its practices and of your objectives.\n\nOn another front, the director plans to draw up a five-year structural and functional plan for the Editora within the scope of Unicamp's Planes (Strategic Planning).\n\nAsked to evaluate the role of the Editora over its 40 years, Edwiges considers that it is not possible to dissociate the line of action of an academic publisher from the values ​​disseminated or assumed by the university to which it belongs.\n\nIn this sense, the linguist reaffirms, “the Editora reaches maturity with much to be proud of and open to the various challenges that it will always face, due to its scientific-cultural vocation and its concern with the objectives of Unicamp, a university of excellence, public, free and socially referenced”. (Read article by Edwiges Morato.)\n\nFavorable situation\n\nFor the body's first director, historian Jaime Pinsky, the Editora emerged in a situation that brought together conditioning factors that would result in its creation, including the weakening of the military dictatorship and the expansion of the University in all areas - from physical space to faculty and staff.\n\nFurthermore, Pinsky recalls, there was a pressing need to disseminate the teaching content produced by teachers, both inside and outside the classroom. “We invested in this aspect, including in co-editions, with publications from all areas of knowledge”, recalls the historian, who at the time was a professor at the Institute of Philosophy and Human Sciences (IFCH).\n\nIn the opinion of Pinsky, whose management was from 1983 to 1985, a university press can and should be a channel of communication between the production of knowledge and society. “Unicamp is a storehouse of talent and competent professionals. It is up to the Editor to circulate and democratize the knowledge produced in our space”, he says.\n\nThe graphic secretary Ednilson Tristão, known as Edinho, is another witness to the beginnings of the Editora, which he joined in 1990 after working as a messenger in the Rector's Office. “Professor Carlos Vogt [rector between 1990 and 1994] saw me drawing, thought I had talent and suggested I look for a position in the publishing department’s graphics department”, he recalls.\n\nIn his more than 30 years in the profession, Edinho has witnessed all the transformations that the sector in which he works has undergone – from covers made on the drawing board, with ink, to the most advanced software. Performed the functions of diagrammer, inker, editorial producer, graphic arts technician until reaching the position of graphic secretary, which he currently holds.\n\nTristão highlights that, over the course of more than three decades of work, contact with different contents enabled his professional improvement, materialized in recognition for the work carried out, both among peers and in the form of awards. “The Editora has always been a source of knowledge and inspiration for me.”\n\nSílvia Helena Pires de Campos Gonçalves joined the Editora's administrative sector in 1989, being transferred two years later to layout, a role she held for more than two decades, moving back and forth between other areas of the organization.\n\nLike Tristão, Sílvia witnessed several changes in the book's production processes. “I went from linotype to digital. I had the privilege of going through all the stages, from the initial steps to completion, including the bureaucratic part, marketing and distribution”, says Sílvia.\n\nThe employee returned to the administrative sector in 2018, but never stopped expressing the importance of the book in her professional career. “EveryoneMy wealth of knowledge was acquired in this relationship with the works published by the Editora”, he states. “I often say that participating in the creation of a book is like gestation. All things considered, I must have had around 600 children”, he jokes.\n\nBreaking the lock\n\nFor linguist Eduardo Guimarães, director of Editora in two periods (1986-1997 and 2013-2017), an One of the organization's main hallmarks lies in the fact that it created conditions so that many Unicamp professors and researchers could publish their works, breaking the blockade of a market governed, invariably, by profit. “Unknown authors found their space. Many gained notoriety, even receiving awards”, he points out.\n\nOn the other hand, Guimarães assesses, the publisher made it possible to publish important works in the history of science, philosophy and the arts, including in this list classics that had not had a new edition for a long time. “The publisher kept works that would be unlikely to be republished available to interested parties. That’s how he started to have an expressive catalogue”, says Guimarães. “In parallel, the Editora knew how to follow new market movements, such as the publishing of ebooks and online sales”, he adds.\n\nThe former director, who is a professor at IEL, highlights as relevant initiatives of his two administrations the publication of teaching manuals and collections dedicated to poetry and the history of thought, the implementation of sales and distribution mechanisms, and the implementation of two Editora bookstores in campus by Barão Geraldo.\n\nIt was in one of these bookstores that the journey of Ana Lúcia Ângelo de Andrade began at Editora in March 1996. Originally from Monte Castelo (SP), Ana Lúcia remembers that, when she disembarked in Campinas to accompany her brother who had suffered an accident, she only had a suitcase and R$700 in her bag. “After 26 years, I built a house and gave another to my mother”, says Ana Lúcia, now working at the Livraria da Editora located in the Unicamp Central Library.\n\n“I am very grateful to Editora for everything I have achieved, but what moves me is working with the public, which is very diverse and interested. Book selling is an art”, says Ana Lúcia, whose routine includes a lot of reading and daily updates on the titles that hit the shelves. “I often recommend works to clients.”\n\nIn addition to reading, the employee mentions daily contact with students and teachers as a source of expanding her personal and professional horizons. She fondly remembers, for example, the frequent incursions of sociologist Octavio Ianni, who, as soon as he entered the Bookstore, between comments on books and conversations about prosaic topics, would always tell Ana, with affection, that he had a granddaughter of the same name. “This type of interaction made my learning a daily experience. I have evolved a lot thanks to my work at Editora.”\n\nEzequiel Theodoro da Silva, director of Editora between February and December 1998 and collaborating professor at the Faculty of Education (FE), reveals that his experience at the head of the body he paved the way for learning about the techniques and stages of producing printed books. “In this way, I was able to bring together the reception pole – reading, the focus of my academic concerns – with the printed production pole of a professional publisher.”\n\nThe former director says he has always related the Editora's work to the flow and amplification, through different means, of Unicamp's academic production, especially scientific production. “The multiple awards received throughout its history are clear proof of its excellent editions in terms of care in the selection process and professionalism in the editing processes”, evaluates Ezequiel.\n\nCorrect strategy\n\nLike his predecessors, mechanical engineer Luiz Fernando Milanez, director between 1999 and 2002, believes that Editora da Unicamp adopted the correct strategy by prioritizing the dissemination of works authored by professors, researchers and students at the University.\n\nIn the former director's opinion, it is up to university publishers to fulfill this role. “This line of action and the different initiatives adopted over 40 years, including the publication of translations, classic texts and relevant works of academic and general public interest, have yielded awards and well-deserved recognition.”\n\nMilanez, who was a professor at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FEM), was the only director of the Editora not from the humanities area. “In the previous administration, I was part of the Editorial Board and the then dean Hermano Tavares asked me to take over the Editor on an interim basis while he looked for a name in the humanities. As no professor accepted the role, the dean asked me to direct the organization”, he recalls.\n\nJacion Sabino da Silva joined Editora as a patrolman in 2000, during Milanez's management. Two years later, he was hired as an administrative assistant, rising to other positions until he became commercial manager, a position he assumed in 2017. “I worked in all areas, with the exception of book production”, he is proud.\n\nThe fact of moving through different areas throughout his career allowed Jacion to acquire a vision of the whole. Currently responsible for the entire commercial area, the manager sees the implementation of stock as a game changer. “The Editora changed its level. The organization provided by the stock professionalized the commercial sector once and for all, it was a great evolution. The end consumer began to be served more quickly”, he diagnoses.\n\nFather of an 11-year-old girl, Jacion credits Editora with his growth on all levels, from intellectual to professional. “Thanks to my work, I graduated in Accounting, started a family, lived with people who opened paths for me. I can say that I achieved everything I wanted,” he reveals.\n\nThe essayist and writer Paulo Franchetti, director of the organization between 2002 and 2013, adopts parsimony when taking stock of the Editora due to its different configurations in the period. “In its best moments, the Editora published books of great relevance; at its worst, it had a localist or accounting tendency, as if it were a printing press destined to publish local production or to gather resources”, he asserts.\n\n“But, in general, especially those first years in which it had the full support of the Rectory, it was a good reference in the editorial world”, evaluates Franchetti. Teacher from the Institute of Language Studies when he took over, he reveals that he had three objectives: tmake the organization a national and international reference, both in terms of catalog and editorial quality; give fiscal existence to the Publisher; and create a regiment and a series of public standards.\n\nAccording to Franchetti, the first objective was achieved through the choice of an Editorial Board of the highest level, making the Editora da Unicamp logo a seal of quality. The second, continues Franchetti, was achieved with the help of José Tadeu Jorge and Paulo Eduardo Rodrigues Moreira da Silva, respectively, general coordinator and pro-rector of University Development at the time. “The third was a result of the first two and was the easiest to carry out”, he recalls.\n\nThe power of the book\n\nThe journey of events supervisor Gracinda Maria Baptista, as well as that of some colleagues at the organization, is an emblematic example of how working at the Editora – and immersion in the book universe – can be transformative. Gracinda worked in the treasury of a school when she was fired. Needing a job, she joined Editora in 2000, as a cleaner, a role she held for three months.\n\nApproved in a University competition, she soon went to reception, occupying roles in other sectors over the years, from the management secretariat to the administrative department. When working as an assistant in the Events sector, encouraged by the then director Paulo Franchetti, she decided to attend advertising and marketing college, enrolling after graduating in a Spanish course.\n\nIn 2007, she took on the role of events supervisor. In this role, she coordinated work at local, national and international biennials and fairs, even representing the Editora abroad. Gracinda resorts to modesty and gratitude when asked what she thinks of her career: “I never imagined becoming a supervisor. The Editora is like an extension of my family.”\n\nFor Márcia Abreu, director of the organization between 2017 and 2021, a university publisher must be guided by the dissemination of knowledge, fueling scientific debate and favoring the development of culture, without having financial results as its goal. “Although pecuniary gain is not its purpose, good sales results are an indication of correct editorial policy, as they suggest that the books have reached the hands of readers”, highlights Márcia.\n\n“Combining good financial performance with the publication of relevant titles for various areas of knowledge and for the general public, the Editora's fundamental purpose is fulfilled”, believes the former director, who is a professor at the Institute of Language Studies.\n\nMárcia Abreu states that her management prioritized a policy of lowering the price of books through various sources, including the website Editora, book fairs and events in campus. “We also consider that the reader's encounter with the book does not necessarily involve purchasing it. Therefore, the donation campaign was carried out for public institutions”, he concludes."
