        "text": "Abstract: This unique book on super-resolution microscopy techniques presents comparative, in-depth analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of the individual approaches. It was written for non-experts who need to understand the principles of super-resolution or who wish to use recently commercialized instruments as well as for professionals who plan to realize novel microscopic devices. Explaining the practical requirements in terms of hardware, software and sample preparation, the book offers a wealth of hands-on tips and practical tricks to get a setup running, provides invaluable help and support for successful data acquisition and specific advice in the context of data analysis and visualization. Furthermore, it addresses a wide array of transdisciplinary fields of applications. The author begins by outlining the joint efforts that have led to achieving super-resolution microscopy combining advances in single-molecule photo-physics, fluorophore design and fluorescent labeling, instrument design and software development. The following chapters depict and compare current main standard techniques such as structured illumination microscopy, single-molecule localization, stimulated emission depletion microscopy and multi-scale imaging including light-sheet and expansion microscopy. For each individual approach the experimental setups are introduced, the imaging protocols are provided and the various applications illustrated. The book concludes with a discussion of future challenges addressing issues of routine applications and further commercialization of the available methods. Guiding users in how to make choices for the design of their own experiments from scratch to promising application, this one-stop resource is intended for researchers in the applied sciences, from chemistry to biology and medicine to physics and engineering.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2587054\n\nAbstract: Computer Vision has been applied to augment traditional board games such as Chess for a number of reasons. While augmented reality enhances the gaming experience, the required additional hardware (e.g. head gear) is still not widely accepted in everyday leisure activities, and therefore, camera based methods have been developed to interface the computer with the real-life chess board. However, traditional 2D camera approaches suffer from ill-defined environmental conditions (lighting, viewing angle) and are therefore severely limited in their application. To answer this issue, we have incorporated a consumer-grade depth camera based on patterned illumination. We could show that in combination with traditional 2D color images, the recognition of chess pieces is made easier, which allows seamless integration of the real-life chess pieces with the computer program. Our method uses a fusion approach from depth and RGB camera data and is suitable for two distant players to play against each other, using two physical sets of chess.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_14\n\nAbstract: This article describes an approach to foster computational thinking in different school subjects. Our approach includes several teaching units (packages) that are self-contained and have been designed for university courses attended by prospective and graduate primary and secondary school teachers. Around 30 packages have been designed so far and together cover eight aspects of computational thinking in six different subjects. In this report, some examples are sketched out together with the experiences gathered.\n\nAbstract: Stereoscopic vision modules have seen limited success in both engineering and consumer world, due to the required additional hardware (image acquisition, Virtual Reality headsets, 3D glasses). In the last years, especially the gaming and education sectors have benefited from such specialized headgear, providing virtual or augmented reality. However, many other industrial and biomedical applications such as e.g. computer aided design (CAD) or tomographic data display, so far have not fully exploited the increased 3D rendering capabilities of present-day computer hardware. We present an approach to use standard desktop PC hardware (monitor and webcam) to display user-position aware projections of 3D data without additional headgear. The user position is detected from webcam images, and the rendered 3D data (i.e. the view) is adjusted to match the corresponding user position, resulting in a quasi virtual reality rendering, albeit without the 3D effect of proper 3D head-gear. The approach has many applications from medical imaging, to construction and CAD, to architecture, to exhibitions, arts and performances. Depending on the user location, i.e. the detected head position, the data is rendered differently to attribute for the user view angle (zoom) and direction. As the user moves his or her head in front of the monitor, different features of the rendered object become visible. As the user moves closer to the screen, the view angle of the rendered data is decreased, resulting in a zoomed-in version of the rendered object.\n\nAbstract: Precise and low-cost range imaging in underwater settings with object distances on the meter level is demonstrated. This is addressed through silicon-based time-of-flight (TOF) cameras operated with light emitting diodes (LEDs) at visible, rather than near-IR wavelengths. We find that the attainable performance depends on a variety of parameters, such as the wavelength dependent absorption of water, the emitted optical power and response times of the LEDs, or the spectral sensitivity of the TOF chip. An in-depth analysis of the interplay between the different parameters is given and the performance of underwater TOF imaging using different visible illumination wavelengths is analyzed.\n\nAbstract: Swissmem, the Swiss association of mechanical and electrical engineering industries, founded a new photonics group in 2013. This reflects the importance of this key technology for Switzerland. Swissmem requested from the Swiss Universities of Applied Sciences to introduce a new bachelor program to fulfill the increasing demand of the Swiss industry of young academics in the field of photonics. Optech Consulting is investigating the Swiss photonics market since many years on behalf of Swissphotonics, the Swiss national thematic network for photonics. The study concluded that the total production volume of the Swiss photonics industry in the year 2013 was 3 billion Swiss francs and a slight growth is expected for 2014. The University of Applied Science HTW Chur is located in the Eastern part of Switzerland. This area of the Rhine valley is a technology cluster of innovative companies in the field of optics and electronics. The industry is growing and the R&D departments of the worldwide active companies are lacking well-educated photonics engineers. The HTW Chur is dedicated to establish the first Swiss bachelor in Photonics. Supported by strong industrial players and an excellent network, the HTW Chur developed different job descriptions and a complete curriculum, which reflect the needs of the Swiss photonics industry. Almost 60% of the ECTS of this national degree program are assigned to photonics specific courses and the practical projects are organized in close collaboration with the photonics industry. Curriculum, job descriptions and the industrial needs will be discussed in detail in this paper.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1117/12.908107\n\nAbstract: We examine planar double split-ring resonators (SRRs) consisting of two concentric rings with either opposite, similar, or asymmetric gap orientation. Depending on the geometry we observe resonance hybridization, metamaterial induced transparency, or the excitation of dark resonances. These properties can be used for SRR based sensing applications, to realize strongly dispersive behavior, or for determining the optical properties of metals. We further find that THz SRRs featuring very narrow gaps on the micro- or nanoscale can provide in-gap enhancement factors of several 10,000, a property particularly useful for the realization of nonlinear THz experiments.\n\nAbstract: Open educational resources (OER) can significantly reduce the time required to prepare lectures. The prerequisites are that a desired resource can be found quickly and that its adequacy for the intended purpose can be estimated easily. Eventually, the resource should also be suitable for modification. In the first part we outline the requirements for the sourcing, storing, retrieval and exchange of open educational resources considering technical and legal aspects. In the second part we present a case study focusing on the user level perspective. We describe the searching for a particular OER (an online Moodle tutorial), the analysis of the resource found, its modification and the publishing of the modified resource on a repository.\n\nAbstract: This paper presents the \"Cable Crawler\", a mobile teleoperated robot to inspect high voltage power lines. Its mechanism allows riding on the topmost ground cable of high voltage power lines and crossing a set of mast tips as well as smaller obstacles autonomously and thus is not limited to just move from mast to mast. The robot consists of an aluminium chassis, six propulsion units and two spaces for cameras and other electronic components. Six electrical motors drive independently six rubber-coated rollers, two in a horizontal position to take the weight and four vertical ones. The four vertical rollers are pressed onto the wire by springs, which guarantees slipless propulsion in difficult situations. A Matlab program controls the drives independently. An optical camera is mounted on the prototype, which can rotate 360° and the image can be transmitted wireless to the user's computer monitor. With a mass of 58 kg and only six drives it consequently follows the industry's wish to have a robust, easy to maintain and rather cheap solution. Regarding the fields examined by the robot, the project concentrated on the detection of trees growing into proximity of the wires.\n\nAbstract: An accurate mathematical model is indispensable for simulation and control of a micro helicopter. The nonlinear model in this work is based on the rigid body motion where all external forces and moments as well as the dynamics of the different hardware elements are discussed and derived in detail. The important model parameters are estimated, measured or identified in an identification process. While most parameters are identified from test bench measurements, the remaining ones are identified on subsystems using the linear prediction error method on real flight data. The good results allow to use the systems for the attitude and altitude controller design.\n\nAbstract: Non-invasive optical projection tomography (OPT) provides a method to image small animals in-vivo. We present two correction methods for this technique which can be applied after the images have been acquired. The first method allows to reconstruct specimens embedded in media with arbitrary refractive index, and the second method corrects for small movements of the specimens with respect to the detection system. We have tested the correction methods with computer simulated data and with samples of Parhyale hawaiensis embedded in sea water. These post-acquisition corrections prove to be a major step towards routine in-vivo imaging, and provide 3D analyses of OPT data which can not be rendered using standard reconstruction methods.\n\nAbstract: Whenever the realization of a swash plate mechanism is not feasible (e.g. due to miniaturization limitations), center of gravity steering is an interesting alternative to swash plate steering. We present an approach to describe the dynamic behavior of a coaxial micro helicopter steered by a center of gravity shifting mechanism. The mechanical design of an existing system is improved to increase mechanical robustness and steering quality. In parallel, a simulation model is developed and implemented. It is used to estimate the system response to steering inputs, and to compare center of gravity to swash plate steering. Experimental flight results show an improvement of the helicopter performance due to the mechanical redesign.\n\nAbstract: An understanding of the generation of higher harmonics in Lamb waves is of critical importance for applications such as remaining life prediction of plate‐like structural components. The objective of this work is to use nonlinear Lamb waves to experimentally investigate inherent material nonlinearities in aluminum plates. These nonlinearities, e.g. lattice anharmonicities, precipitates or vacancies, cause higher harmonics to form in propagating Lamb waves.The amplitudes of the higher harmonics increase with increasing propagation distance due to the accumulation of nonlinearity while the Lamb wavetravels along its path. Special focus is laid on the second harmonic, and a relative nonlinearity parameter is defined as a function of the fundamental and second harmonic amplitude. The experimental setup uses an ultrasonic transducer and a wedge for the Lamb wave generation, and laser interferometryfor detection. The experimentally measured Lamb wave signals are processed with a short‐time Fourier transformation (STFT), which yields the amplitudes at different frequencies as functions of time, allowing the observation of the nonlinear behavior of the material.The increase of the relative nonlinearity parameter with propagation distance as an indicator of cumulative second harmonic generation is shown in the results for the alloy aluminum 1100‐H14.\n\nDOI: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.727506\n\nAbstract: The method of Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy (SPDM) has been used to determine distances between two FISH (Fluorescence-in situ-Hybridization)-labeled gene regions on chromosome 9. To this end we applied methods to correct for chromatic aberrations of the microscope optics alone and also of the sample induced aberrations due to mismatch of the refractive indices. Using a confocal microscope and a threshold based position determination algorithm, positions could be measured with an accuracy of about 65 nm inside of fixed cell nuclei. Distances obtained from the measurements have been verified using a 3D computer model of the cell nucleus. In principle, this SPDM approach could be combined with novel fluorescence microscopes to obtain structural information well below the optical resolution. At present the precision limit of the distance measurements is set by variations of the refractive index throughout the specimens.\n\nAbstract: The method of Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy (SPDM) has been used to determine distances between two FISH (Fluorescence-in situ-Hybridization)-labeled gene regions on chromosome 9.

We present measurements on polymerase II complexes, where we found a variation of the local refractive index of 1.38 - 1.55 (standard deviation interval) throughout the nucleus. This variability is not correlated to the accumulations and the extensions of the polymerase II complexes, which have been determined in a previous experiment.1 Local protein accumulations such as adherent transcriptionally active proteins could possibly contribute to such variations, as could also different compactions of the DNA fiber. Altogether, we present a method to precisely obtain a map of the local refractive index inside of cell nuclei, which provides another contrasting mechanism for visualizing sub cellular structures.\n\nDOI: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=982238\n\nAbstract: The structural responses of beams and tubes is investigated in theory and experiment in order to locate and assess damage in the form of fatigue cracks. Crack length measurements are performed in transversely vibrating beams by determining the resonant frequency, which is stabilized through a phase locked loop. Cracks are initiated and propagate from the notch of the structure which is vibrating at resonance. The frequency in relation to the crack length is modeled including the nonlinearity effect due to closing of the crack. Fatigue tests were also carried out with piezoelectrically excited microstructures.\n\nAbstract: Tomographic reconstruction of fluorescence optical projection tomography (OPT) data is usually performed using the standard filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm. However, there are several physical aspects of fluorescence OPT that pose major challenges for the FBP algorithm. These include blurring, and the fact that for an isotropically emitting point source (or fluorophore), the power received by an objective aperture decreases with the inverse square of the distance to the source. These two effects are shown to result in qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies in fluorescence OPT reconstructions obtained using standard FBP. A model of image formation is developed which includes the effects of isotropic emission and blurring. The model is used to calculate a probabilistic system matrix for use in the maximum likelihood expectation maximisation algorithm, which leads to reconstructions that are both qualitatively superior and quantitatively correct.\n\nAbstract: We propose a novel THz material analysis approach which consists of a combination of a stratified dispersive model, an appropriate measurement configuration and a time-domain based fitting procedure. The measurement configuration is modeled as a stratified system where for each layer the light-matter interaction is realistically described. The method is illustrated for the industrial quality control of (coated) paper sheets and is shown to give highly accurate results in humid air and irrespective of the position of the reference mirror in reflection.\n\nAbstract: Fluorescence microscopy techniques using patterned illumination light offer the opportunity to extract high-resolution object information beyond the conventional resolution limit. This chapter describes in detail two widefield methods that apply interference of the excitation light to make high-resolution object information accessible. These are structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (also referred to as patterned excitation microscopy, PEM) and spatially modulated illumination (SMI). In SIM, the object is illuminated with a periodic illumination pattern. This pattern is used in order to manipulate the object's spatial frequencies. Two methods to spatially modulate the excitation intensity in SIM are common: two-beam interference, also called fringe projection, and three-beam interference, the so-called grid projection. The secondary focus of this chapter is on the less common method of SMI, where two opposing objective lenses are used to generate a high-frequency interference pattern along the optical axis. The SMI method is used to measure the size of nanostructures with great precision.\n\nAbstract: Despite investigations of the nuclear architecture of the genome, the true 3D nanoarchitecture of small chromatin domains and its correlation to epigenetic control mechanisms are still not sufficiently known. Reasons for this are the lack of nanostructure conserving labelling techniques as well as practical limitations in 3D fluorescence microscopy with high optical resolution (100 nm and below). The present study was initiated as an attempt to overcome these methodological shortcomings. As a model case we compared the spatial extension of fluorescence of chromatin domains in ABL gene regions in blood cells (BC) of different Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) patients with BCR/ABL fusion on the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and in lymphocytes of a healthy donor and a Prader-Willi syndrome patient by Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI) microscopy after specific labelling using COMBinatorial Oligo Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (COMBO–FISH). Volumes and compaction ratios of interactively identified ABL chromatin domains were determined under the assumption of a compact spherical fluorescence distribution. Significant differences were found between the domain size values of the labelled sites of Ph+ BC nuclei of CML patients and of Ph- BC nuclei of a CML patient after successful chemotherapy (imatinib mesylate (STI) treatment). Differences were also significant between BC of all CML patients and lymphocyte control preparations. These results show the feasibility of COMBO-FISH in combination with SMI microscopy."
