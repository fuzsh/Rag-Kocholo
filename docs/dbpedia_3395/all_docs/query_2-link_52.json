        "text": "From KFLA Public Health For immediate release Tuesday, April 30, 2024 Alarming increase in drug poisonings in the KFL&A area Kingston — KFL&A Public Health is issuing an alert to warn residents about a recent rise in drug-involved poisonings within the KFL&A region. Consumption and Treatment Services in Kingston is reporting a 30 per cent increase in apparent drug poisonings since April 27, 2024. Similar observations are being noted by other community partners who provide programs and services to people who use drugs. While local data about the composition of the unregulated drug supply is not available, other Ontario jurisdictions continue to report the presence of a variety of high-potency opioids as well as tranquilizers in the unregulated supply. These observations highlight the continued unpredictability and toxicity of the unregulated drug supply in our communities. It is vital that people do not use drugs alone and 911 is called immediately for emergency medical care when drug poisoning is suspected. Naloxone should be given any time drug poisoning is suspected. While naloxone will not reverse the effects of other kinds of drugs or contaminants, it will help reverse the effects of any opioids present. In addition to informing key partners including the public, promoting access to naloxone kits and other harm reduction measures, and continuing to work on preventing drug-related harms, KFL&A Public Health is urging people to: Avoid using alone. If you use alone, tell someone before you use and have a safety plan that includes having someone check in with you. Alternatives may include: Using with a friend or family member present or virtually, staggering use if both are using drugs. Using a supervised consumption service in person at Consumption and Treatment Services at 661 Montreal St. in Kingston or virtually by calling the National Overdose Response Service at 1-888-688-NORS (6677). Avoid using more than one drug at a time, including alcohol. Go slow. The quality of unregulated drugs is unpredictable. Get a free naloxone kit and training. Always carry it with you. Consider carrying multiple doses of naloxone. Call 911 for emergency medical treatment immediately if drug poisoning is suspected. If you have a friend or family member who uses drugs, share the above safety information with them and get a free naloxone kit and training. For more information on harm reduction, visit the KFL&A Public Health website. For more information about this alert, please contact Justine MacIsaac, Consumption Treatment Coordinator at justinem@kchc.ca.\n\n1\n\n1 Comment\n\nThe ongoing debate on whether now is the right time to expand Medicaid in New York continues to gain attention. As highlighted in the recent article by West Side Rag, the decision comes at a critical time when many New Yorkers are still recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. With the potential to provide much-needed healthcare access to thousands, this expansion could be a lifeline for those in need. However, the financial implications and readiness of the state's infrastructure remain key considerations. Expanding Medicaid is not just about increasing numbers; it's about ensuring that the most vulnerable populations have access to essential healthcare services. As healthcare professionals and policymakers, we must weigh the immediate benefits against the long-term sustainability of such programs. The right approach could bridge gaps in healthcare access and improve overall community health outcomes. For more detailed insights and perspectives on this issue, read the full article here: #Healthcare #MedicaidExpansion #NewYork #HealthcarePolicy #PublicHealth #CommunityHealth\n\n🫶 𝗧𝘂𝗲𝘀𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀 🫶 𝙇𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙨 𝙇𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣𝙚𝙙 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙎𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙘𝙚𝙨 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙖 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙞𝙤𝙧 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙘𝙚 𝘼𝙡𝙡𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙂𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙩 We were fortunate to be selected as one of the service providers for a grant that Senior Resource Alliance, a local Non-Profit, managed. The purpose of the grant was to help seniors 60 years and older on Medicaid, or in danger of being placed in a nursing home. Here are three lessons learned from the time we spent with these local seniors. 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙂𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙊𝙧𝙜𝙖𝙣𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙙 𝙀𝙖𝙧𝙡𝙮 As we were helping them get their primary affairs in order, many struggled to find critical information related to their physical and financial well-being. 𝗧𝗜𝗣: A few easy ways to be better equipped to have the necessary information needed to navigate life’s challenges is to ensure you store all this information in the same area of your home. It can even be as simple as putting the information in a three-ring binder. 𝙋𝙚𝙤𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝘾𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝘼𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙔𝙤𝙪 𝙈𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙏𝙝𝙖𝙣 𝙔𝙤𝙪 𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠 While many seniors we helped were living with or near family, for those who are on their own more often, it’s important to work to continue relationships with family and friends. Isolation can be more difficult for a person to handle. 𝗧𝗜𝗣: There are always more people who care about you than you think. Create a routine where you reach out to close family or friends. Don’t let weeks go by without being in touch with them. 𝘽𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙂𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙤𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙚 As we age it’s easy to get lost in a sea of medical issues, often referred to as co-morbidities. Be as proactive as possible in taking positive actions related to your health. Taking responsibility via good behaviors and being engaged with those involved in your care will only help in the long run. 𝗧𝗜𝗣: Utilize the tools available to you to improve your short-term health and long-term outlook. Our nurse practitioner helped seniors review their medication and supplement intake to ensure they were being taken at the right times of day and at the right frequency. Doing this helps to optimize treatment plans – elevating the level of care for the seniors. Other tools like cognitive tests can help detect issues early. It’s all about being proactive! #seniors #caregivingtips #empoweringcaregivers #healthadvocate\n\n5\n\nOn Friday, three of our four staff attended the Perinatal Quality Collaborative for Maine's (#PQC4ME) annual conference in Augusta. We've included some staff reflections below: #POLICY 🗳 : Reversing the effects of decades of chronic underinvestment in perinatal outcomes will require strategic, policy-level advocacy work in Maine. #COLLABORATION 🤝 : Improving Maine's perinatal health metrics demands a coordinated, collaborative, and multi-sector response to patient voices. It is imperative that the healthcare system, the legislature, community-based organizations, and perinatal professionals (in particular #doulas) work together. #MAINESUCCESSES 🌲 : Strategic leadership and orchestration is well underway in Maine, with growing opportunities for #qualityimprovement expertise from all sectors. #TESTIMONY & #STORIES 🗣 : To influence the outcomes and change the minds of policy-makers and legislators, we need testimony from those most impacted and harmed by the lack of investment and protections. Coaching on the effective delivery of stories from those with actual lived experiences is the next step. A very special thank you to the PQC4ME team for putting on an A++ conference. The inspiration at Birth Roots Center for Community Supported Parenting abounds! 🌱\n\n19\n\nAcross the United States, ED demand exceeds emergency care supply. There is an urgent need to find an alternative to sending people to the ED for acute symptoms. The Emergency Department in Home (EDiH) care delivery model was created to rapidly deliver acute episodic care to patients at home in Massachusetts. In collaboration with the referring provider group, Atrius Health, Medically Home Group (MHG) operates this care delivery model. The intervention operates in three phases: patient intake, care delivery, and care transition. Eligible patients are triaged and cared for by in-home community paramedics within 2.5 hours of referral with medical direction by a virtual emergency medicine (EM) physician. During care delivery, patients receive ED-level services, including laboratory testing, imaging, and medications, in the home. Image acquisition is conducted in the patient’s home by a third-party service provider technician; generally, the study is completed within 4 hours after being ordered by the EM physician. This innovative model has the potential to reduce crowding in hospital EDs and reduce facility use. Over the first 2 years of the program described here, 2021–2022, Atrius Health has referenced a net savings per encounter under the EDiH referral model of approximately $1,250 compared with the traditional ED referral model. In addition, given that MHG bore all costs related to staffing and managed services, with the staffing models and hours detailed, the program became profitable for MHG at approximately 15 encounters per day. The savings for the customer are realized on a per-encounter basis and are compounded as visit count grows. Controlled clinical trials of EDiH should be conducted. Here, the authors describe how institutions can develop this model and discuss the challenges that were encountered while developing this program: https://nej.md/3x8kC2T\n\n3\n\nJust discovered this report by the former Philadelphia Health Commissioner, who declined to take a position on our resolution and unfortunately obfuscated on her reasoning. We're still awaiting a response from the Interim Health Commissioner. To put it diplomatically, this report is quite lacking in basic granularity. Most egregiously, it doesn't even distinguish between hospitalizations resulting from use of psychedelics (again, \"hallucinogens\" is pejorative and reductionist) vs. poisoning but rather conflates the two categories and combines their numbers. It also does not distinguish between the natural psychedelics we are working to get decriminalized and synthetic psychedelics that are in some cases potentially higher risk, including involving increased risk of fentanyl or other drug contamination. Safest thing is to grow your own mushrooms or cacti. If you generally manage to avoid food poisoning yourself when you cook, you are in principle competent enough to grow your own mushrooms or cacti; though again, its important to really understand dosing, set, setting, having a qualified guide, etc. And if you've got expendable income to experiment with all sorts of exotic and dubious synthetic drugs, you've got expendable income to invest in this campaign! 😼 #Philadelphia #PhillySupportPhilly #PhillyPulse #Philly #PhillyLove #Pennsylvania #entheogens #psychedelics #therapy #mentalhealthsupport #opiodcrisis #gunviolence #FirstAmendment #religiousliberty #spirituality #mentalhealth #trauma #PTSD #depression #addiction #Kensington #plantmedicine #firstresponders #DecriminalizeNature #veterans #climateaction\n\n1"
