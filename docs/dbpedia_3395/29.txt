Sorry I don’t mean to steal Eddie’s thunder, just wanted to post up some team news from Lope’s press conference.

• Marcos Acuña is out for a good while as he has a tear in his Hamstring.

• Jesus Navas is a doubt for tomorrow, they will assess tomorrow but he could be out.

• Sergio Escudero is fit to play and we will decide if he will be in the squad given on what we need. Given we don’t have an actual LB in the squad I was somewhat surprised by that comment.

• Pablo Perez has only just come back from 3 months out and getting minutes with Sevilla Atlético so we might see him later in the season, but same can be said about other players from the B team, depending on how situations play out.

That’s a good point, I’m pleased that Suso is getting the hang of things and looks much better in the last 6 or so games. Also hope O’Campos can get back to free scoring, though I think YEN’s presence reduces his scoring opporutnities.

The Troika of Fernando, Carlos and Koundé seems to make us more solid, so Gudelj must work his ass off in place of Fernando.

Hope that Escudero stays out of the rough challenges and gets his match fitness and game together.

Finally, hope that YEN gets another hat-trick and takes the Pichichi seriously.
