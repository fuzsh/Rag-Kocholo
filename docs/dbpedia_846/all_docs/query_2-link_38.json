        "text": "I will contribute a little here, for what it’s worth -\n\nI have an O-470 that I am preparing to use on my “A model” QB. I have this engine for two reasons, really: 1) I have always liked the way 470’s and 520’s sound - the big-bore lope that they have when they are taxiing out turns my gears - hey, call me simple, and 2) it was cheap as dirt, about $2K, salvaged from an old abandoned Cessna 310 (O-470-M), and came as a full firewall-forward package with exhaust, baffles, all accessories, fuel-injection “carb” (PS-5C), and a CS Hartzell prop (HC-A2XF-2) and spinner. That was in 2012, and was a good deal at the time. My plan all along has been to convert it to either a low-compression 230hp carburetor -L, R, S model, or a 260hp IO-470-F or equivalent.\n\nYes, I have heard all of the arguments on pros/cons of the Continentals vs Lycomings. And it really doesn’t matter to me, I simply chose to go with a “previously certified” engine and prop because I know enough of the engineering to know that I don’t want to go there with anything else. At least not for my peace of mind. And this one had a good price at the right time, most good Lycomings were more. For the weight argument, well I weighed my engine, in detail from the firewall forward package down to stripped bare, so I have the weights, and I can tell you there is little to no difference apples-to-apples between this and a Lycoming 540. I found it to be maybe 25#, depending on what you include. For instance, the Bendix PS-5C and the attaching manifold and brackets for my engine was about 10# - I don't know what a M-S MA-4-5 weighs, mounted right on the bottom of an O-540, so there's a small difference right there that's hard to account for. The published weights for the 540’s and 470's do not include starter and alternator, and that’s easily anywhere from 20-50# of a variation, so you have to keep that in mind. The choices of starter and alternator/generator are the main differences, and once you put those on, plus exhaust, baffles, etc., on either of them they are both going to be over 400#, no way around it. The next big difference is in props. I will get to that in a minute.\n\nAbout 12 years after getting this engine, after a long list of “life” delays, I have just yesterday gotten my new engine mount from BH Aircraft - Thank You, V. Irwin!\n\n5342EB60-9A75-48B0-8D9A-FA1006190F04.jpg\n\nJust hanging on two bolts for the picture… Now I can proceed to at least mount the engine, so I can lay out firewall penetrations and such, and work on the cowling, and the intake and exhaust routing, etc., etc.\n\nBut here’s the drawback I have run into, and is something to consider before going down this road - the O-470 series pretty much has to use a certified propeller. There simply really aren’t any other options available, outside of doing your own R&D or taking a chance on some sketchy experimental choices that are out there. I will explain this best I can, with a little background, naturally.\n\nSince this package included the two-blade Hartzell constant-speed prop from the 310, I was thinking I was well ahead of the game. Right after I got the engine, an A&P friend of mine came to see it, and he mentioned that there was an AD on that series of prop. I thought, great, well I will cross that bridge when I come to it. That bridge sort of happened last week - the mount was on the way, so I started dusting off the old stuff, the engine and all the parts in boxes, and the prop - re-acquainting myself with all of it. I got the model number off the prop and looked up the AD, and it concerns cracks in the blade mounting system on the hub, and requires on-going inspection, every 500 hours. That includes UV particle, magnetic particle, and optical comparator testing every time - so I’m thinking $$,$$$.\n\nI called the Hartzell Service Center to ask about my options for an overhaul. The prop is considered obsolete in their system. But, they have a modification (the MV hub/shank system) that can be done to permanently address the AD, by reworking (via extensive machine work) the hub, clamps and blades - all for about the same cost as 3 new 3-blade propellers. The best, safest, most cost-effective option they have is to just buy a new propeller. And that actually isn’t a ridiculous option, but it is still two to three times what I expected a simple overhaul to cost…\n\nWell, since I am buying a new prop, what about these new composite ones? Nope - the 6-cylinder Continentals have a minimum polar moment of inertia requirement - composite props are too light. It seems the crankshaft and counterweight system of these engines is designed for what were the normal props of the day; steel hubs, aluminum blades. So all of the experimental-arena composite designs are not recommended - by Continental. Bad vibration and cracks can ensue… So this isn’t a propeller manufacturer thing. And it seems that that is likely why all the major experimental prop companies don’t have anything for Continental 6’s. At least nothing I could find.\n\nThat said, there are several very nice 2 and 3-blade propellers available from both Hartzell and McCauley. The “scimitar” blade designs are available as retrofits for Cessna 180’s and 182’s and 185’s, and others - so there are options. But you have to be careful to select the correct compression ratio, RPM, and counterweight system to match the prop, so pick the O-470-() or IO-470-() or IO-520-() model number carefully. Actually, all of the 520’s have the same counterweight system (1-4th, 1-5th, 2-6th orders), so pretty much any prop for a 520 will work on another 520 as long as you aren’t increasing the compression ratio or RPM from the prop application’s base engine. Anything else is getting into the R&D thing, as well as trying a composite prop of any kind.\n\nBecause of this sort of limited range of propellers, the weight is almost always going to be at least 60-80 pounds for the prop. Keep this in mind if you are concerned about nose weight and CG.\n\nBrad"
