        "text": "Share\n\nPrint\n\nNews in Science\n\nWooden Propeller 2\n\nLast time, I talked about how, even in the 21st Century, wooden propellers have advantages over metal propellers.\n\nLast time, I talked about how, even in the 21st Century, wooden propellers have advantages over metal propellers.\n\nFor one thing, wooden propellers deal with the many vibrations of the engine and the aeroplane body thousands of times better than metal propellers. Being bent backwards and forwards millions of times makes a metal propeller build up invisible internal flaws - but wood doesn't get affected by this vibration cycle. With a metal propeller, you can't see the damage because it's hidden. But a wooden propeller is a good case of \"what-you-see-is-what-you-get\". The Sensenich Company will check, repair and rebuild wooden propellers. Some propellers have come back after two years, and because of bad maintenance in the field, they're thoroughly unairworthy. But in contrast, some 30-year-old propellers have come back that needed only a bit of lacquer.\n\nMetal is stronger than wood, so you'd think that metal props can be made thinner and more efficient. But in the 1950s, aeronautical engineers came up with a new design for wooden propellers that brought their performance to within a fewer percentage points of the efficiency of metal propellers.\n\nAnother advantage is that wooden propellers can be bolted onto engines that run from 2,700 right up to 6,000 revolutions per minute - but you can't cover that range safely with a metal propeller. And of course, you can easily carve up a new wood prop for a few hundred dollars but it costs thousands to cast, grind and then polish a metal propeller.\n\nSensenich's propellers all start off as rough-cut yellow birch planks from New England tree farms. These planks are all one-inch thick (about 2.5 cm) and come in random width and lengths. They're checked for any weakness, and then glued together to make up as many as 16 layers. Believe it or not, a stack of thin strips of wood glued together to make up a 10 cm-thick lump of laminated wood is stronger than a single 10 cm-thick piece of wood. They're stuck together with an ancient glue called \"Resorcinol\" - it's the only glue that Sensenick has used for the last half-a-century.\n\nImmediately after gluing, the individual strips of timber are clamped for 24 hours to laminate them into a single slab. This slab is then rough-shaped on carving machines, and then skilled workers do the final adjustments by hand. They use a combination of power tools and hand tools. Other workers then add stainless steel and/or brass onto the twisting curve of the leading edge of each blade of the propeller - to make it more resistant to bird strikes. At every individual stage of production, the propeller blade is balanced again. At the very end of the production line, you can have a propeller blade 3 metres long that is so finely balanced that one paper clip placed on one of the tips would slowly rotate it out of level. At full speed, the very tips of this propeller can bite into the air at around 980 kilometres per hour - and thanks to the exquisite manufacturing process can do so for thousands of hours without any vibrations.\n\nToday, about 10% of Sensenich's propeller blades go into the display market, where they're used for decoration only (such as on somebody's wall, or a fancy sports bar).\n\nAirboats take around 20% of their production. A typical airboat or swamp boat can reach 110 kilometres an hour in shallow water, because it's pushed by a four-blade, 2-metre propeller mounted on a 400-kilowatt engine.\n\nAbout 40% of their output goes into general light planes - often disparagingly called \"puddle jumpers\".\n\nBut the big surprise is that 30% of their propellers go into the latest Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - small reconnaissance and (recently) attack planes. These UAVs can cost a million US dollars each. They can be launched from a truck or a ship, fly around for hours or days, and finally return to crash into a $20,000 Kevlar net. All that breaks is the $300 propeller."
