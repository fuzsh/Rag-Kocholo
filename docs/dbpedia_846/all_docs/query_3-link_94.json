        "text": "After years of experience with MT Propellers I am nothing but full of praise. I have been operating them all over the world - in all sorts of climate.\n\nIn harsh arctic, as well as in desert or tropical environment.\n\nNeedless to say, that many runways were either unpaved or non existent.\n\nPerformance and reliability has always been outstanding.\n\nThe after-sales service and support was excellent.\n\nIf light maintenance was due, all that was needed is studying the service book and than do it yourself.\n\nIf remote support was needed from far away places like the jungles of Borneo, a ring via SAT Phone brought me in contact with the service engineer - problem solved.\n\nMany thanks to the entire MT team Your props pulled me places â¦.\n\nStefan Mommertz N314M / N6275E\n\nmore\n\nDear MT!\n\nHere are 2 videos and a photo illustrating the awesomeness of your 5 blade composite props on a KA B200 with Blackhawk engine upgrades.\n\nN826WG tail number. The photo was taken at level flight, 290 knts, 28500 ft. Only 84dB. We can hear the pilots taking now and they can hear us.\n\nWe did a ton of noise level measurements that we can send if you want the data. We did the recordings with both a dosimeter as well my iPhone using Decibel X Pro (app) from multiple positions onboard, including the cockpit (before and after installing your props). Long story shortened, your props reduce the ambient noise level in the cabin from 7-9 dB on the âAâ scale. Huge difference.\n\nLove them!\n\nDavid\n\nmore\n\nJetstream 31, MT Propeller Testimonial\n\nNorthwestern Air Lease Ltd. has converted our Jetstream 31 to MT propellers and is extremely pleased with the result.\n\nWe have found that there is a significant reduction in the noise levels in the cabin and outside the aircraft. Passengers can carry out a normal conversation in the aircraft. The response of the propellers to changes is much quicker with the MT propellers, when pilots select reverse and with the application of power the response is much more positive. We feel that we are seeing a lower fuel consumption and a slight increase in speed with the MT propellers. I would not hesitate to recommend the MT propellers to any operators.\n\nBoth the manufacturer, MT Propellers Entwicklung Gmb in Germany and AMK Aviation Inc., the dealer in Ontario have provided outstanding technical support, advice on operating these props and maintenance training. We are very impressed by the support by both the manufacturer and the dealer. We are looking at converting the rest of our fleet as soon as possible.\n\nBrian Harrold Pilot / AME Owner Northwestern Air Lease Ltd.\n\nmore\n\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul\n\nof MT-Propellers\n\nsales and service of products\n\nmade by other manufacturers:\n\nMT-Propeller Gerd Muehlbauer GmbH\n\nFlugplatzstraÃe 1\n\n94348 Atting\n\nPhone: +49-(0)9429-94090\n\nwolfgang.sell@mt-propeller.com"
