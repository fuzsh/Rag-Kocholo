        "text": "The Narrow blade wood propeller was the very first Airboat style propeller designed by Sensenich over 60 years ago, it can be manufactured for many applications with diameters of 60″ all the way to 84″ and pitches ranging from 36 through 48 inches. All Sensenich wood Airboat propellers are manufactured from aircraft grade birch and feature composite reinforcement around the last half of the blade. This allows the removal of the traditional metal cap on the end of the blade that contributed to so many service problems in the past. The composite prevents erosion and foreign objects from exposing the wood fibers to the elements. This gives you a longer lasting wood propeller when cared for properly. A riveted and screwed on stainless steel leading edge gives additional erosion and damage tolerance.\n\nThe 74-78″ diameter propeller is most popular on direct drive & automotive engines with reduction units producing 210-375 HP\n\nBolt patterns can be adjusted to match your specific engine.\n\nAll wood propellers are built to order."
