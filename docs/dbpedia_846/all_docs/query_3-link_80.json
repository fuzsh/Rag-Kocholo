        "text": "Good day All My name is George and I am the proud new owner of a PA-22-160, 1957. I am currently in the process of importing it into Canada strait into owner maint. And yes I know the downfalls of this. What I am wondering is what length of prop can I put on, I know the grd clearance from the piper drawings is 12\" and the faa requires 7\" so that would allow 79\" for a prop but will a longer prop hit the tire with the strut aired to max?? I am looking for stol performance and wish the borer would fit. Also what do you guys think of a 3-blade or mabe a ground adjustable??? Any suggestions??\n\nThanks\n\nGeorge\n\nGopher hole?\n\nThere are no gophers in Alaska...I think.\n\nLineman,\n\nthe real limiting factor is like all things the stack of paperwork you are willing to purchase.

However, it must not be forgotten that a modification may have an impact on structural strength, performance, operation of the power unit, or flight characteristics. A*modification must not be taken lightly. It is important to think before acting.\n\nTechnical records\n\nDetails of the repair or modification must be entered in the journey log or in the technical record, and must be accompanied by the maintenance release. It is important to enter data references; without them, the data has little value. For example, the entry might*read:\n\nLower right fuselage spar, 20*inches from the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer: repaired by adding doubler, oxy-acetylene weld, repainted.\n\nReference: AC*43.13-1B, chapter*4, section*5, paragraph*4.94 and figure*4-36.\n\nThe described maintenance has been performed in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements.\n\n[signed] Ty*Wright ******date\n\nMaintenance release\n\nShane\n\nRWP,\n\none of the advantages to having that nose wheel in the front is that a prop-strike requires one to be almost inverted to have a prop strike. Just saying.\n\nWhen I first riged my Airglass 2000s I released the nitrogen from my strut, bolted on the 82 incher, and verified I had the clearance required by ac43.13. After that I added a 4 inch snubber to my oleo strut for insurance. Now two things to keep in mind: I have the Airglass nose fork which is taller then stock and the ski does not stick out as for forward or as tall as my 8:00 nose wheel.\n\nAs for doing the conversion? If I had a need for real off airport activity I would get a Cub ,super or a 90, the right tool for the job.\n\nThat being said I must add that I have seen a tripacer balanced on its nose in the snow, the nose wheel, and one wing tip; pointing straight up and down. The only thing the prop hit was the nose tire and left a small slice. Two men could not pull it down it was so stable in that position. The pilot mentioned he was afraid to move as he reached down and forward to turn off the master, to the sound of fuel draining out of the fuel tanks... then slowly disconnecting his harness...\n\nRocket"
