        "text": "The new 82JR series features our latest advanced swept blade shape technology. A combination of blade shape, airfoil technology, and laminate structure work together to increase propeller performance. The JR series blade also mounts using our latest V series hub models. These hubs offer many features like easier pitch setting and accuracy, ability to assemble the entire unit off of the boat and finally an anti-theft deterrent option.\n\nThe 82JR Series of blades is a really wide blade for automotive engines with ratio reduction units. Redesigned from The original “R” Series, this propeller has the optimum thickness ratio to assure you a high performance propeller. Designed primarily for mid to high ratio reduction units the 82JR Series has the type of push you are looking for from a really wide propeller. Coupled with our new V Hub, this propeller is a breeze to install and adjust pitch.\n\nThe 4 Blade 82″ JR Series has quickly become a favorite of 500 – 700+ HP engine applications using 2.0 to 2.68 ratio reductions that are looking for the most available thrust.\n\nAll Sensenich composite ground adjustable blades are manufactured using an internal pressure, closed mold system. Aerospace grade epoxy pre-impregnated carbon fiber and fiberglass a cured at an elevated temperature to give the optimum strength at the minimum weight. A co-cured stainless metal leading edge is bonded on flush with the airfoil. The stylish aluminum hubs are CNC manufactured from aerospace grade aluminum and offer easy pitch adjustment of the blades"
