        "text": "About Us\n\nAircraft Propeller Works, Inc. is an FAA certified propeller and governor repair station. Our expert staff has over 75 years of combined experience in the aviation industry, and our lead technicians boast over 20 years each in aircraft propellor and governor repair and assembly. Our shop is certified to work with composite blade propellers and all of our assembly technicians have been factory trained by the major manufacturers. We also employ two technicians who are certified NDT Level II as specified by the American Society of Non-Destructive Testing.\n\nWe have the knowledge, manpower, and equipment to uphold the highest industry standards when it comes to repairing, refurbishing, or replacing your constant-speed, fixed-pitch, or turbine blade propellers and governors—and we look good doing it!\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally known as Propworks, we have been in continuous operation since 2001. With an eye for expansion and a knack for business, Arthur Michaud bought the company in 2006, changing the name to Aircraft Propeller Works, Inc. Later moving to our current location in Auburndale, Florida, Art—as he is known to friends and customers—piloted APWI into becoming central Florida’s premier aircraft propeller and governor repair & sales station. In 2016, current proprietors Jeff and Wanda Curtiss assumed ownership of APWI, pledging to maintain our excellent reputation for customer service and quality work, while also modernizing and streamlining all aspects of the operation."
