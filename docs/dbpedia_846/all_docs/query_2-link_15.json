        "text": "just a question if any of yall can help.... i run a 12'6 big O with a straight valve O-540... i had a 3 blade H series sensenich and it puched pretty good and ran the hill well and all that, but a bolt went through it and tore it up, so we went ahead and ordered a 3 blade Q series.... now it wont be in till later this week and i wanted to go to the lake cleanup yesterday so i borrowed my buddy's 2 blade Q series and it pushed my boat really good.. better than the 3 blade H series... my question is, to whoever has experience running both props- will the 3 blade Q series out push that 2 blade or will it be the other way around or about the same?? i ran the 2 blade at 2800 RPMs and plan on running the 3 blade Q the same..... any advice or comments are appreciated....\n\ni was spinning the 2 blade that i borrowed at 2800 RPMs on pitch mark #2-- we wended up gettting the 3 blade Q series, ill let u kno what i think when it comes in in a few days... i ran one on that boat back in deer season for a weekend and it pushed the boat pretty well... ill let yall kno what i think about it all when my new prop comes in :lol:\n\nThat sounds awful. I thought the Q was suppose to be the quietest prop available. Maybe the 3 blade will be quiet. If I am going to spend $1500 to $2000 for a prop, I want one that has good performance but also as quiet as possible. My mufflers work great but the prop noise takes over above 1500 RPMs. Let us know which proves best.\n\nThis is from the Sensenich FAQ for Carbon fiber props\n\nA) We do 4 different sizes: narrow, medium, wide, and super wide! We offer a narrow blade about 8” wide, a\n\nmedium blade about 10 ½” wide, a paddle style blade about 12” wide, and a super wide blade about 15” wide.\n\nNarrow and medium blades work well on direct drives and reduction drives, while the wide and super wide\n\nblades are only for use on reduction drives. They are all designed for reduced noise and improved “snap”.\n\nWhat width are the Q series blades considered?\n\nThe H is the narrow blade 8 1/2 inches.\n\nThe Q is the swept medium 10 1/2 inches.\n\nThe K is the wide paddle prop blade 12 inches for reduction units only.\n\nThe S is the superwide blade 15 inches for reduction only.\n\nI know Waterthunder said he had the Q for his quiet boat but he also has the reduction unit and was able to get on plane at 1400 rpm. That sounds more like a wide blade. I just want to get one that is more quiet than the wood prop I currently have.\n\nThunder ran the Superwide at the Quiet Demo. The biggest problem he was having that day was holding it down to the 25mph that the testers wanted coming by the microphones ! He'd hit the skinny water in the test area and the thing would take off.\n\nSuperwides are quiet too. You don't have to turn em as fast.\n\nI know he called it a Q blade but it makes more sense that it was an S blade. They only turn up to 2300 RPM max which would definitely make it quiet with such a low tip speed. I have a 72 inch wood prop but I think a 70 inch Q might be the way to go. I'll keep an eye on the forum and see if anyone else has good ideas.\n\nThe WW props are too confusing for me. Whirl wind or water walker. I think they are made by different people who like the WW initials. Then they had a powershift which changed its name. From what I read they must not be very good or they wouldn't have changed. I think a guy needs to just try different ones.\n\nMan, thats a lot of prop for 260 hp Lyc. 0540. Sensenich recommended the 76\" 3 blade \"H\" for my brother in laws 0540 and he upgraded from a 2 blade PS Signature. He runs it on a 13 x 8 Air Ranger, matter of fact Faron posted a pic of his rig the other day. The \"Q\" may work for you pitched flat and still push pretty darn good.\n\nKeep us updated, I would like to see how that configuration works on a 0540.\n\nNot to get off the subject but the Sensenich \"S\" Swept Superwide that Water Thunder ran for the sound test was a custom made 16\" wide 3 blade, the factory standard is 15\" on that prop.\n\nAny way JMO I hope the prop works like you expect, it's always nice when things meet and exceed what your original vision was.\n\nwell like i said i ran the 3 blade Q series on that 260hp O-540 for a weekend during deer season when my H was down- it was 72 inch and it was pitched at like 1 1/2 mark... the boat spun it no prblem at like 2750 rpms... i ran the 2 blade Q this past weekend pitch at 2 spinning 2800 rpms... the gap in between running the two props is to long for me to rmember correctly which one pushed better so i was just asking some opinions... my 3 blade Q (72 inch) should be here this week, ill keep yall posted...\n\ndrspud, I currently have a Florida Airprop wood prop on my boat. It is a 72x32 that is 10 1/2 inches wide. It is perfect for quickly getting on plane and pushing the boat over 50 mph. The only problem is above 1500 RPM the prop is loud. What do you recommend as a quiet replacement? The 2 blade 72 Q sounds like it would work but is a 3 blade quieter?"
