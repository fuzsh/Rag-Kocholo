        "text": "November 17, 2011\n\nWater Walker\n\nDefinitions of Pitch for Airboat Propellers plus a Short Story.\n\nFirst, the short story;\n\nA year or so after I introduced the hollow composite carbon based propellers for airboats, the Sensenich Company, with my encouragement started to make and sell their versions of these “breakthrough” propellers. (I even hosted their engineer Steve out to Colorado to see my procedures and perhaps learn from them. They expressed appreciation at the time.)\n\nThen some time after that I introduced the “Signature Series” propeller blade for larger aircraft engines.\n\nDon, Steve and I arranged to meet (on the quiet) at an aircraft engine builder’s place near Orlando (I remember a “Wally”) who had completed an angle valve IO-540 Lycoming powered boat for a customer that had been dyno’ed at 300 HP at 2800 RPM. Don and Steve brought their best hollow carbon three blade propeller and I brought a new three blade Signature set. They were both 72” propellers.\n\nI had designed the Signature blade to achieve a possible 4 pounds of thrust per HP and had posted a money prize (not a large amount) to the first actual user that would demonstrate this possible 1200 pounds from a 300 HP aircraft engine. The prize was won that day. I had brought a new set of scales. It turned out that Don and Steve had brought scales and also Wally had scales. There was “friendly distrust”, so we quickly decided to place all three scales in line in the chain to the oak tree and the tests began.\n\nThe signature went first, was set at its’ reference pitch mark and stopped the engine right at 2800 RPM. This was a good first sign of its design parameters. At full throttle, all three scales registered a steady 1200 pounds of thrust. This result was there-to-fore “unheard of”. I wish I could remember the young boat owner’s name but his comment was that he was going to take his girlfriend out for a fancy dinner with the prize money.\n\nDon and Steve then mounted their propeller set and with a couple of adjustments stopped the motor right at 2800 RPM. The three scales rose steadily and each stopped at 1100 pounds of thrust. While still much more than would have been possible from a then available wood stick propeller they were not at the 4 pounds of thrust per HP. Steve’s friendly quote was “Well Don, “back to the drawing board”. This must have been about 12 years ago.\n\nThe Signature went on to become Dick Hoffman’s (a famous airboat racer) propeller of choice with which he bested all comers until his unfortunate illness and passing.\n\nThen the Falcon blades were introduced and the Ground Rattler was born with Falcon fangs.\n\nOn recent posts on this forum, Waterthunder speaks of achieving 2000 pounds of thrust on his tester setup (which looks to me like a good setup & I would like to see it someday.) I applaud David for his work and say that it is good for every airboater when such proof tests are done in a controlled way. If they are regularly demonstrating this “ton of thrust”, with 500 HP, then Steve has spent his time well on the drawing board, so to speak. “So, its hats off first to Steve for the R Blade and to you David as well for these procedures and tests”.\n\nPropeller pitch descriptions;\n\nI thought that the following descriptions of propeller pitch might help after seeing the several comments from cntry141ig on Waterthunder’s recent thread. Cntry questions the correctness of setting the differently designed (by separate companies) propellers only by their Tip Angles”. He is perceptive and correct about this, in my opinion.\n\nAnd now about propeller pitches.\n\nWhat are the Standards of Descriptions of air thrust propellers? How do we determine them and how do we use them?\n\nIn the older style wooden “stick” propellers, they were and still are referred to in terms of “inch pitch”. This means “how many inches will a propeller move a column of air rearward in only one revolution. This supposes no slippage in the air and is if you were propelling a mass of Jello rearward in a column. Seldom is a wood or “fixed pitch” propeller described in any term other than “inch pitch”.\n\nImportant concepts to understand is that because a propeller moves in a circle about a center of rotation, each further distance from the center outward from the hub towards the tip moves at an increasingly larger speed through the air while having to have a decreased angle of pitch to arrive at the common “inch pitch” destination. On say a 32” pitch wood propeller, each distance out the propeller blade would require a lessened pitch angle to travel an increased distance around its bigger circle to arrive at the same 32 inches “down the road”.\n\nGround adjustable hollow carbon propellers are adjustable as a complete set of pitch angles along the pitch distribution across the blade length. Any adjustment, even small ones, changes the “inch pitch” of that blade considerably. So the “inch pitch” as a description becomes less meaningful. The range of adjustment might change the blade from say a 40” pitch blade to a say 50” pitch blade within the range of its adjustment envelope.\n\nIn old propeller nomenclature, for fixed pitch props the inch pitch is said to be measured at a distance out the blade of 75% of the total blade length. On say a 36” blade from a 72” prop 75% would be at 27 inches out from the center of rotation. With the prop hub vertical and the blade horizontal, one should measure the pitch angle of the cord of the airfoil at that position on the blade. The cord in this case is an imaginary line from the center of the front edge of the airfoil to the center of the trailing edge of that airfoil section (at this point the angle is measured from vertical).\n\nUpon measuring that angle, (Let’s say you measured 10.89 degrees) Next, one computes the circumference that the 27 inch station would circumscribe. (27 X 2 = 54 times pi 3.14---- = 169.65 inches.) Then take the sine of the angle that you measured (the sine of 10.87 degrees is .18892) and multiply it times that circumference and the resulting number in inches is the rated “inch pitch” of that specific propeller. (.18892 X 169.65 = 32 inches.) This example computes to be a 32 “inch pitch” propeller no matter what the rest of the pitch distribution angles including the “Tip” angle are.\n\nIn the case of a Water Walker propeller model, the closest one might come to determining an inch pitch rating would be to set the blade accurately in the hub at its pitch reference mark as later described. Then follow the above procedure to get a rating in “inch pitch” for the blade. Remember though that when you change the pitch setting it changes. You could re-compute the inch pitch again by the same procedure for your new setting. However if you were to rate the blade you should stick with the design pitch mark readings and computations. Sounds simple doesn’t it.\n\nDoes it matter that we know all this stuff? Actually no it doesn’t unless you are particularly interested. Just put the damn thing near the pitch reference mark and have at it.\n\nWhen I developed these styles of blades, I thought about all this and determined that a user would only really need to know how to set the blade at its designed center of performance general pitch setting and how would he do it? The two halves of the hub (that I first designed and most everyone is now using) meet at the center of the shank cavity and give an excellent “point of reference” from which to make this first “center of performance reference setting”.\n\nThen I experienced an “epiphany”. (As Rush would say, “For those that live in Rio Linda”) that means “a good idea”. I could just put a mark on the blade shank that would be matched up with the mating line of the hub halves. Just put the blades there and “you have it”. Now, how and where to put the mark? A simple chisel mark in the aluminum propeller mold would show on every blade made from that mold. Note that the mark would represent a total of all of the many design features and parameters into one total for setting and that our summation is highly likely to be considerably different than such a summation that might be used in other maker’s blades.\n\nThe trick was “where to put the chisel mark in the mold”? We figured that out so a user wouldn’t have to. Then adjustment became just a small amount ahead of or behind that resulting mark. Later to make adjustment easier, propellers began to show up with little stickers about the mark to give users some reference to talk about and hence one hears such as “I am set at say +3 on the setting scale”.\n\nPitch distribution is where it’s at.\n\nNow for the magic of propeller design as we all reach for perfection. In my experience it is largely in “pitch distribution” where the best possible thrust to HP in performance is achieved. Said another way, how hard should each distance out the length of the blade (from shank to tip) should the pitch and airfoil of that portion of the blade be asked to work (to produce thrust) before its drag spike would rise too much?\n\nIt is here where cntry was so perceptive and correct in his questioning of the tip angle settings for those tests not being the absolute reference to matching performances between different propeller makers. It is when a given propeller blade is set at the best overall average of all of these pitch distributions (at its reference mark at the hub) that we arrive at that propeller’s best designed overall performance results. At this optimum setting for that blade, the tip absolute pitch angle might then vary in degrees from another’s optimum overall setting.\n\nUsing the unchanging laws of physics, once the perfections sought for by everyone is very nearly reached after nearly 20 years of hollow carbon propeller designing and manufacture we arrive at what both Chuck at Airboat Pros has said and what David of Waterthunder has said at least once on his recent posts. “There is not much difference in the performances”.\n\nCompetition and the lack of tight regulations for airboat design and use (as compared to the Federal Aviation Administration and aircraft) has enabled airboats to arrive at and enjoy perhaps the most modern, safest and best performing propellers out there.\n\nFor our part, we at Water Walker are proud of what's done and are “moving on” and beginning to reach for the next breakthrough level of fuel efficiency, performance by developing the new Operator Adjustable Variable Pitch Propeller which we hope will give the airboater excellent performance and quietness over the whole range of operations with less required HP and less required expensive fuel burn for use on car motor airboats.\n\nThere is a working model, pictures of which have been previously posted on this forum. We will begin serious hard testing of it in late winter and the early spring.\n\nAgain, we are being the pioneers. In this effort and as in the past as the pioneers in hollow carbon composite propellers in general, we have received some “arrows in the back” and will likely see some in the future. It comes with the “heat of the kitchen”.\n\nWe appreciate the support we have had over the years and hope that more will be forthcoming.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nI invite lots of comments, all are important.\n\nDavid Wine\n\nWaterWalker said:\n\nNovember 17, 2011\n\nWater Walker\n\nDefinitions of Pitch for Airboat Propellers plus a Short Story.\n\nFirst, the short story;\n\nA year or so after I introduced the hollow composite carbon based propellers for airboats, the Sensenich Company, with my encouragement started to make and sell their versions of these “breakthrough” propellers.
