        "text": "SUMMARY: The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Hartzell Propeller, Inc., McCauley Propeller Systems, and Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Company, Inc. propellers. This AD requires maintenance actions amounting to an overhaul of the affected propellers. This AD results from the investigation of a failed propeller blade and subsequent inspections of various propeller models returned to service by Southern California Propeller Service, of Inglewood, CA. We are issuing this AD to prevent blade failure that could result in separation of a propeller blade and loss of control of the airplane.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nPlease visit the FAA's website to view the entire Airworthiness Directive."
