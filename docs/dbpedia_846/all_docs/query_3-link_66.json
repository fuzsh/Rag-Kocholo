The Curtiss Wright Juniors can often be found with Scimitar Fahlin or other straight propellers as can be seen at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, but we have yet to find one with this original Sensenich Propeller.\n\nI can't imagine many of these survived. Definitely one of the first propeller designs Sensenich manufactured.\n\n75-1/2 Inches in Length and Weighs Less than 25 lbs.\n\nDes. 755\n\nNo. 1372\n\nAtc. 388\n\nPropeller is in excellent condition (see photos) for a prop that's been around for almost 90 years.\n\n(2) Original Sensenich Brothers Decals"
