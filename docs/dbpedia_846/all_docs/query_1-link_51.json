        "text": "Description\n\nCirca 1930s antique Sensenich Brothers airplane propeller.\n\nPropeller Model: W76JR\n\nPitch: 53\"\"\n\nMaterial: Aircraft grade Birch and laminated using resorcinol glue\n\nUsed with (Aircraft & Engine)\n\nStinson 108, 108-1, 150\n\nFranklin 6A4 150 B3/150\n\nStinson 108, 108-1 Seaplane\n\nFranklin 6A4 150 B3/150\n\nStinson 108-2, 108-3\n\nFranklin 6A4 165 B3/165\n\nStinson 108-2 Seaplane\n\nFranklin 6A4 165 B3/165\n\nIt all started when two boys, Harry and Martin Sensenich, got tired of trudging through the snow on their Pennsylvania farmhouse to go to the mailbox. The brothers decided to build an engine and propeller driven ice sled to make the trek.\n\nSensenich Propeller was established in 1932 to manufacture fixed pitch wood aircraft propellers for the growing aviation market. In 1949 they began to manufacture wood propellers for the burgeoning airboat market. Aluminum propellers for aircraft was added to the product line in the 1950’s. During the 1960’s the use of UAV’s became prevalent and Sensenich was right there with propellers for the new industry. In 1999 they began a highly successful line of ground adjustable composite propellers for Airboat, Aircraft and UAV’s."
