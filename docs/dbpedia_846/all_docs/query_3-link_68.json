        "text": "We found an old wood Sensenich prop hanging on an office building at our air taxi. It has been there for many years and no one knows its history.\n\nPart Number W82RS72 S/n ending in 2965.\n\nThe prop seems to be a Grumman G-44 Widgeon prop from a ranger engine. I am hoping to identify which aircraft this prop was installed on. If it was one of the Alaska pioneers of aviation who lived here in Talkeetna Alaska we would like to know. Please respond with any ideas for tracking down the history of this prop.\n\nI think the only way to associate it with a specific aircraft is find (as in \"stumble upon\") the airframe/engine logbooks for that plane. To my knowledge there would be no other record held by Sensenich that would have identified the plane. Even a sales receipt is unlikely to help unless it connected to a chain of documentation leading to the aircraft logs.\n\nWe tend to think of propellers as an integral part of the aircraft history when in fact they were more like tires on an automobile. You had to have one that fit and they frequently were replaced due to damage and/or wear.\n\nyes, I figured as much. We are trying to track down the few aircraft that were here. they should still be flying. If we can find them we can ask the owners to check their logs."
