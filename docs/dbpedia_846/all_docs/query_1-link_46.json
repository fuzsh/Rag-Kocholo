        "text": "After flying my Aymar-Demuth extreme cruise pitched wood prop on an O-320-D1A up to Johnson Creek, Idaho and back home last week with my plane filled with camping equipment... I am now suddenly very interested in this prop.\n\nMy friend's O-320 equipped RV-4 with Sensenich 70CM series metal prop (I think pitched to at least 81\", maybe even as much as 83... I'll have to ask him) flat outright blew my wings off on takeoff, climb, and even cruise speed performance up high in the the mountains. Now granted, his plane was loaded down somewhat lighter than mine, but the disparity in performance between these two RVs at the higher density altitudes was waaaaaaaay lots more than could be accounted for only by weight and the usual 4-vs-6 performance differences... even when we emptied out our camping gear and went on a day trip to another airstrip, my plane was still a dog compared to his. At lower altitudes, my top end cruise is just fine (just takes a long time to for me to build up to speed once leveled off, however) and then the two planes are pretty closely matched. Here in the flatlands of Texas the two planes are not all that far apart in climb or cruise.\n\nI am now thoroughly convinced I need a different prop.\n\nOf course, the \"real fix\" is to convert to CS but I simply haven't got the $10K budget to bankroll that. This new ground adjustable prop may be just what I need.\n\nI have two big questions remaining about it however.\n\n1) How many times /how frequently can you realistically adjust it, before you wear it out from disassembly/reassembly? In other words, is it made to withstand frequent repitching as a part of normal use and service, or it it designed only to try a few different pitches when first installed in order to find the best comprise pitch and then you must lock it down and leave it there for the duration? If, say for instance, I make even as much as 2 or 3 trips from Texas to the mountains and back, will re-pitching it back and forth along the way up there and back at my fuel stops be an \"abusive\" frequency?\n\n2) The galvanics issues between the carbon fiber and metal contact... what measures can be taken to mitigate this from becoming a real problem? I would assume that as long as you keep any water out of the contact areas, that galvanic corrosion will be kept to a minimum. Would coating these contact areas with something like a thin layer of EZTurn/FuelLube grease be of any benefit since that would pretty much seal out any water, and it's thick enough that it's not all going to get too easily slung out by centrifugal force, and it's got a high enough melting point that it's not all going to get melted out by heat either. Thoughts?\n\nThe spinner is carbon but it has a glass isolation ply over the carbon to prevent any corrosion from forming.\n\nHow about the carbon fiber bulkheads? Do they also have a fiberglass isolation layer over the carbon to prevent corrosion where they contact the prop hub? I could not really tell from the photos you posted earlier. The one bulkhead photo only shows the rear side of the aft bulkhead and it looks kinda like there is no glass layer where it would contact the crankshaft or prop spacer.\n\nThis is my primary concern here. Back when I owned my Cherokee 140, I got a service advisory letter from the maker of my aftermarket composite spinner about corrosion problems with their carbon fiber spinner bulkheads they sold for PA28 models. The letter included photos showing corrosion pitting on the front and back of a Sensenich aluminum prop that ate pretty deep into the metal where it had contacted the bulkheads. Luckily, I had good old fashioned aluminum bulkheads and this company's earlier model of plain fiberglass spinner so I didn't face the corrosion problem on my Cherokee.\n\nBTW, the bulkhead photo posted earlier looks an awful lot exactly like the same construction style as the company who made the aftermarket composite spinner components for my old Cherokee. SensenichMike said their spinner were outsourced... I wonder if it is the same spinner company?\n\nMy new Sensenich ground adjustable prop just arrived. It looks pretty much exactly like the photos Brice Johnson posted earlier, except mine is white with red tips. When I called Sensenich on Monday morning they did not have any white ones in stock and normally would be about two weeks out from being able to ship, but pulled a set of blades from the production line and had them painted/tested/balanced in a rush order especially for me and shipped everything overnight so that I'd have the new prop and spinner by this weekend and still have a chance to make it to Oshkosh this year.\n\nNow that level of customer service on a new customer order out of the blue is nothing short of phenomenal and my hat's off to Donald Rowell, Cindy Keene, and the rest of the folks at Sensenich who pulled this together to get me a new prop, in the colors I wanted, into my hands before the work week was out!\n\nI'll get it installed tomorrow and will take photos and prepare an installation and flight testing/performance report thread as soon as I can.\n\nWe got the Sensenich GA prop in the 68\" diameter configuration for Marilyn's 160 HP RV-4. It's a 1987 completion, short gear leg RV-4 with old style wheel pants and sheet metal intersect fairings. She's been flying it with this prop for a couple of months now, which being winter in the Great Northwet, hasn't been too many flights.\n\nMarilyn is not a speed or performance nut like some of us guys, and never flys at full throttle except for take off.\n\nI haven't flown it with the new prop yet, I work on the RV-8 while she flies.\n\nShe is TOTALLY JAZZED by this prop.\n\nShe reports very good subjective performance, smoother than the Metal Sensi, or the wood Hendrickson on the T-18, and KILLER looks.\n\nSorry, she's not going to do GPS runs at full throttle or anything.\n\nHowever she did report an indicated airspeed of 175 MPH part throttle @ 2600RPM flying at 2000' altitude, also it has great sustained climb rate to 6500' were she met the class B airspace floor. None of this is remarkable, considering it's winter and the outside air temp is near freezing, but she loves it, I had a good time installing it, with absolutely no problems even though it also got a new Saber extension & bolts. Everything fit first try and it tracks perfectly.\n\nSo I'm reporting satisfaction as a seat of the pants comparison for performance, but the fit, finish, communication etc all get top marks.\n\nPS; my link has 3 pic of the prop."
