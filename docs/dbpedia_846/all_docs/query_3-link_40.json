Revises AD 69-09-03 R2, Amendment 39-1102.\n\nApplicability: Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Company Inc. Models M76EMM, M76EMMS, 76EM8, and 76EM8S( ) metal propellers. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this airworthiness directive (AD) do not apply to those propellers installed on the following solid crankshaft Textron Lycoming O-360 series reciprocating engines: O-360-A4A, -A4D, -A4G, -A4J, -A4K, -A4M, -A4N, -A4P, and -A5AD, or additional engines identified by suffixes having a digit “4” or higher in the second position. These propellers are installed on but not limited to the following aircraft: Piper PA-28-180, PA-28-181, American General Aircraft Holding Co. Inc. (formerly Gulfstream American) AA-5 series, Beech B23 and C23, Cessna 172Q, Avions Pierre Robin R-3000/160, and aircraft modified under various Supplemental Type Certificates (STC’s).\n\nNOTE: This AD applies to each propeller identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For propellers that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (f) to request approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition, or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any propeller from the applicability of this AD.\n\nCompliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.\n\nTo prevent propeller blade tip fatigue failure, which can result in loss of control of the aircraft, accomplish the following:\n\n(a) Commencing with the next flight after the effective date of this AD, do not operate the engine in continuous operation between 2,150 and 2,350 RPM.\n\n(b) Within the next 25 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, mark engine tachometer with a red arc from 2150 RPM to 2350 RPM.\n\n(c) For propellers with 500 or more total hours TIS, or unknown TIS on the effective date of this AD, inspect and rework, within the next 50 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, in accordance with Sensenich Propeller SB No. R-14A, dated July 28, 1995. Remove from service those propellers that do not meet the inspection and rework requirements of Sensenich Propeller SB No. R-14A, dated July 28, 1995.\n\n(d) For propellers with less than 500 total hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, inspect, and rework or replace, as necessary, prior to accumulating 550 total hours TIS, in accordance with Sensenich Propeller SB No. R-14A, dated July 28, 1995. Remove from service those propellers that do not meet the inspection and rework requirements of Sensenich Propeller SB No. R-14A, dated July 28, 1995.\n\n(e) Mark with a suffix letter “K” propellers that have been inspected and reworked in accordance with Sensenich Propeller SB No. R-14A, dated July 28, 1995, and found satisfactory.\n\n(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the initial compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office. NOTE: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York Aircraft Certification Office.\n\n(g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.\n\nh) The actions required by this AD shall be done in accordance with the following Sensenich Propeller SB’s:\n\nThis incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Company Inc., 519 Airport Road, Lititz, PA 17543; telephone (717) 569-0435, fax (717) 560-3725. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.\n\n(i) This amendment becomes effective on June 13, 1996"
