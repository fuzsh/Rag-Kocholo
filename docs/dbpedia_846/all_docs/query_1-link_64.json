        "text": "For our school we are designing a 'boat on wheels' sort of like a swamp boat. On land we are going to us a regular car ingine for wheels and for water we are going to use 'big' fan propeller..something that you would see on a swamp boat. We need to find out which propeller size and how many blades will give us the maximum propulsion thrust.\n\nSpecs for the engine: 70 Volkswagon engine. Torque of 82 ft-lbs @ 3000 rpm and 57 horsepower @ 4400 rpm.\n\nSeems like we need to work with either 2 or 3 blade propeller, which everone will give the greatest thrust. Also we want to make sure that increasing the number of the blades does not affect the torque's efficiency.\n\nWe are thinking of the prop diameter of around 48 inches. So each blade will be 24 inches long.\n\nAny information from anyone who has used something like this for their past designs would be greatly appreciated. We all are in lacey and if someone knows a place to find propellers, it would be really helpful. I am saying this because this is is a school project and we have a limited budget.\n\nAny questions about this...please do let me know.\n\nAgain thanks in advance for help.\n\nBM\n\nI'd try to find a local EAA (experimental aircraft association) chapter. VERY likely someone there either has a VW powered small plane or knows someone that does. They should be able to help.\n\nAlso, a web search for homebuilt airplanes that use VW engines might be fruitful.\n\nProps aren't cheap, and using one that isn't in perfect condition isn't a great idea. Not trying to talk you out of something, but please do be VERY careful. The EAA sells a small and inexpensive booklet on how to make propellors. It really isn't rocket science, but it does require patience and craftsmanship.\n\nTools\n\nMy grandfather and uncle built an airboat back in the 60's using a VW motor and a straight 48\" prop. I reassembled it in the mid 80's using a stock 1600 CC VW twin port motor. I don't remember much about the prop.I think it had a 12\" pitch. I gave it to a guy a couple years ago to try to make a windmill. The prop was direct mounted to the crank and the motor was started by wrapping a rope around the original pulley. No need for any of the original sheet metal for cooling. The boat (flat bottom) went fast enough on flat water to be a lot of fun and rattle your teeth out. I never had the courage to really open it up but I guess it would have done 40MPH+. The flat drift corners were a little exciting too. Nothing like going fast without actualy being attached to the water. I used it to tow a friends tri-hull back to the dock, it had more than enough power to get the job done but he got a lot wet from the spray. The prop was LOUD, a muffler was a waste of time except at idle. I was much younger then and looking back there were more than a few safety issues, but I am sure yours will be addressed. The previous posts about the VW powered planes sound like a good prop source. I think that is where my prop came from. I sure wish I could find my pictures, make sure you post yours here.\n\nSteve\n\nspeaking in generalities, the longer the prop blade(s), and the slower it turns, the more efficient. OTOH, gear drive or belt drive adds complexity and weight.\n\nThe fewer the number of blades, the more efficient. Sensenich (and probably others) experimented with counterbalanced controllable pitch, single blade (yep, only one) props for \"small\" aircraft engines. However, there are lots of reasons why 2 blades is a better starting point, easy balancing being a good one. Sometimes a 3 blade prop is smoother, and may climb faster, but will seldom be as fast (up to several hundred HP) as an \"equally optimal\" 2 blade.\n\nIf your diameter is limited and the HO \"high\", you may have to experiment with pitch, and with \"multiple\" blades to absorb available HP, albeit as decreased efficiencies.\n\nLots of people have carved their own very efficient props. OTOH, given prices mentioned above, it would be hard to beat $300 - 400 for a factory prop optimized for your app.\n\nEAA, as others have noted, is a great place to start.\n\nsmt\n\nHere are some rules of thumb passed to me by Russ Harper that will get you started.\n\nThe lower the disk loading (within limits) the more efficient the drive.\n\nLimiting speed on an airplane propellor as I recall is 700 fet per second tip speed. Any faster and you exceed the speed of sound in localized areas of the outer few inches of the prop and this is a real HP gobbler.\n\nFigure the prop pitch to pump air at about 10% - 12% faster than your top speed.\n\nA VW motor is a poor choice for an airplane engine. It's heavy for its displacement, has a weak case, it's undersquare design is RPM limited, and has poor breathing for constant high RPM operation. You can bolt a bunch of high tech parts on one but it's still 1930's technology; not much more advanced than a Massey-Ferguson tractor engine. I know there are people who absolutely love VW stuff but these are inescapable facts.\n\nHello Bio,\n\nTo determine propeller size and pitch, you need to know the approximate speed of the vehicle while its being driven by propeller thrust. For a 2 bladed propeller, the tip speed needs to be appoximately 4 times the speed of the vehicle and pitch should be such that a full power static engine run equals RPM for max torque. Using a prop that is sized and pitched for an airplane will give poor performance because there won't be enough static thrust to overcome vehicle drag resulting in blade stall and sharp loss of efficiency. An airplane prop won't work anyway cause I don't know of any that are carved for a VW engine in pusher configuration.\n\nJust guessing on the vehicles performance, it will be difficult to get propeller efficiency above 50% without a propeller speed reduction device as someone has already said. Or you can choose a higher h.p. slower turning engine.\n\nWell, to offer a counter point of view on a few points.\n\nI'll bet there are pusher VW props, VW's are used in SCADS of ultralights and certified homebuilt aircraft. VERY good chance there's a number of pushers in there.\n\nWhile it's true that the high RPM of a VW makes for a \"poor\" choice of an aircraft engine, the practical folks of the world have definitively proven that it works just fine. I'd be wary of increasing the HP much. Can't really have it both ways, either HP or reliability. I'd go with reliability since you're not entering a high purse money race or flying over the himalayas, besides, it's cheaper.\n\nA gear reduction DOES increase the efficiency of the powertrain, BUT increases cost, complexity and weight. In the simple planes VW engines are used in, the trade off doesn't outweigh those considerations.\n\nMy advice would be to just get this going. Your best bet on a cost effective prop is to find some guy who had one prop and then wound up switching to another pitch. Afterall, safety is primary consideration, a working project is next, performance can then be worked on.\n\nBy the way, I'm going to build an airplane, called a Pietenpol. It's going to be powered by a Ford Model A engine. No kidding. It produces 40hp at 1800rmp, and has torque. It'll swing a 72' wood prop. The plane was originally designed in 1929 by Bernard H Pietenpol, from WI, and has no failures attributed to poor design. FWIW, VW's have powered a bunch of this design.\n\nLet us know how your project progresses! You'll find this site an enormous resource. Consider my counter opinion, offered to give you a broader range of opinions and choices (and given with due respect to others). I won't be \"yelled\" at like you'll find in many bulletin boards.\n\nIf you do decide to gear reduce, you'll want to talk to the guys who use chevy and subaru engines in planes. They tend to do the most gear reducing. There are units available. Insofar as souping up the engine, usually the methods that ALSO reduce weight are very popular, like headers instead cast iron manifolds, an aluminum head on the Ford A engine, etc.\n\nTools\n\nTools"
