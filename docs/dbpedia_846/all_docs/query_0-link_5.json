        "text": "Original Item: Only One Available. This is a fantastic WWII U.S. wooden propeller produced before or during World War Two by Sensenich Bros. of Lititz, Pennsylvania. The propeller is in very good condition and is constructed of laminated wood with steel tips & edge lining and still retains original Sensinich Bros. decals on both blades, though they are partly flaked away.\n\nThe hub has several stamped markings, including SENSENICH as well as one larger one:\n\nPT-17 AIRPLANE\n\nR-670-5 ENGINE\n\n220 HP\n\n2100 RPM\n\nPART NO. 42K19593\n\nSER. NO. 52898\n\nThese markings give the specifications of the propeller, including the stock number and serial number. Per Sensenich Propeller's references, serial numbers without a letter prefix were made sometime between January 1932 and October 1943, which doesn't give much detailed information, however definitely proves that it was made before or during WWII. More importantly, it gives the specifications of the type of Engines and Airplanes it was designed to work with. This would be the Boeing-Stearman PT-17, which was a version of the Model 75 equipped with a R-670-5 radial engine. The PT-17 (Primary Trainer 17) was one of many trainers widely used during WWII for pilot training.\n\nDimensions of the propeller are 98 ½ inches x 9 x 6 and weighs approximately 30 lbs.\n\nThis is a fantastic rare piece of aviation and WWII history that will display beautifully.\n\nPlease note: The airplane shown in the main picture is a PT-17 \"Kaydet\" on display at the Museum of Aviation, Robins AFB, and is not the airplane that the skin section came from. It is shown for illustrative purposes only.\n\nThe Stearman (Boeing) Model 75 is a biplane formerly used as a military trainer aircraft, of which at least 10,626 were built in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. Stearman Aircraft became a subsidiary of Boeing in 1934. Widely known as the Stearman, Boeing Stearman, or Kaydet, it served as a primary trainer for the United States Army Air Forces, the United States Navy (as the NS and N2S), and with the Royal Canadian Air Force as the Kaydet throughout World War II. After the conflict was over, thousands of surplus aircraft were sold on the civilian market. In the immediate postwar years, they became popular as crop dusters and sports planes, and for aerobatic and wing walking use in air shows.\n\nThe U.S. Army Air Forces Model 75 Kaydet had three different designations, PT-13, PT-17 and PT-18, depending on which type of radial engine was installed. The PT-17 was the version with aContinental R-670-5 engine, of which 2,942 delivered were delivered to the USAAF.\n\nSensenich Propeller, founded in 1932, is an American manufacturer of wood, metal and composite propellers for certified, homebuilt and ultralight aircraft, as well as airboats. The company headquarters is located in Lititz, Pennsylvania."
