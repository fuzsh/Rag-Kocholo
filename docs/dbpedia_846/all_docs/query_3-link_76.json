I said it's not a far or regulatory.\n\nBut the type certificate says \"\n\nPropellers of models described herein conforming with this data sheet (which is part of Type Certificate No. P886) and other approved data on file with the Federal Aviation Administration, meet the minimum standards for use in certificated aircraft in accordance with pertinent aircraft data sheets and applicable portions of the Federal Aviation Regulations provided they are installed, operated and maintained as prescribed by the approved manufacturer's manuals and other approved instructions.\"\n\nThe faa takes the position that stripping off the corrosion protection that was on it when it was certified does not meet the type certificate. I have talked to a few prop shops that have refinnished props that the faa has tagged due to being polished. Is it beatable in court? I do not want to spend the lawyer fees to find out.\n\nSo, if you think it's a good idea to do something the manufacture say don't do in their manuals, the faa says don't do in their ac's, and is generally accepted as something that should not be done.

Plus also ...\n\nAnd ...\n\nIt may appear like a lot of futzing around, but once you get the hang of it, it doesn't take long and will ensure that your prop is in airworthy condition at all times. Blade dressing is a learned procedure and needs a licenced mechanic to certify it after repair. I would consider simple surface sanding, alodine treatment and paint touch up a preventative maintenance item and as such may be certified by an owner.\n\nMy 2 cents worth.\n\nGlennAB1\n\nEjection Handle Pulled\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n4,889\n\nLocation\n\nHome will always be Vandalia, OH\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nGlennAB1\n\nOct 16, 2017\n\n#65\n\nDid you get all that, Tom?\n\nTom-D\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n34,740\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTom-D\n\nOct 16, 2017\n\n#66\n\nWhen you need to know anything about a Sensenich Prop go here, all old publications have been updated by these instructions.\n\nhttp://www.sensenich.com/support/documents\n\nSensenich does a much better job of publishing their maintenance requirements than McCauley.\n\nnote-- this is what JAWs referred to, note the title.\n\nhttp://www.sensenich.com/files/docu...ocess_of_a_Metal_Prop_Overhaul_1311618307.pdf\n\nSensenich maintenance is given by SB.\n\nhttp://www.sensenich.com/support/documents\n\nnotice-- R15A\n\nLast edited: Oct 16, 2017\n\nJAWS\n\nCleared for Takeoff\n\nJoined\n\nOct 7, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,251\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJAWS\n\nGlennAB1\n\nEjection Handle Pulled\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n4,889\n\nLocation\n\nHome will always be Vandalia, OH\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nGlennAB1\n\nOct 16, 2017\n\n#68\n\nHey Tom, that's why service bulletins and repairs are listed separately, huh?
