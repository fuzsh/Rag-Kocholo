        "text": "​​​McCauley\n\nFor more than six decades, McCauley has set the standard for propeller design. Our engineering and performance accomplishments are unequalled in the industry. And our line of piston and turbine propellers continues to push performance to new limits. McCauley's family of propellers is as diverse as it is durable. We offer a full array of propellers, including:\n\n​Fixed Pitch\n\nA full line of aluminum fixed pitch propellers for single - engine aircraft provides maximum performance - and minimum operating costs.\n\nConstant Speed\n\nAlready in use in thousands of single-engine aircraft, this propeller series is highlighted by McCauley's unique one-piece, oil-filled hub with thread- less blade retention. That means greater dependability, coupled with low cost and high performance.\n\nFull-Feathering\n\nWhen they were first introduced more than 30 years ago, McCauley's full-feathering propellers for reciprocating twin-engine and turbine powered aircraft utilized many of the design features found on our constant speed models. Since then, product enhancements that were specifically developed for full-feathering propellers - like the oil-filled hub and thread-less blade retention - have become standard, not just on these models but also on our constant speed models, for the lowest operating costs with high performance and reliability.\n\nMT-Propeller\n\nMT-Propeller Entwicklung GmbH was founded in 1981 by Gerd Muehlbauer and is well known in the world of acrobatic and general aviation as the leading manufacturer of natural composite propellers for single and twin engine aircraft, airships, wind tunnels and other special applications.\n\nHartzell\n\nHartzell Propeller Inc. is an engineering and manufacturing company offering the broadest range of propeller and governor systems for the aviation industry. Hartzell designs, develops, tests, manufactures, and supports constant-speed aluminum and composite propeller systems for all categories of aircraft ranging from general aviation to military applications.\n\nSensenich\n\nSensenich Propeller was established in 1932 to manufacture fixed pitch wood aircraft propellers for the growing aviation market. In 1949 Sensenich began to manufacture wood propellers for the burgeoning airboat market. Aluminum propellers for aircraft were added to the Sensenich prodcuct line in the 1950’s.\n\nWoodward / Ontic\n\nOntic is an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solutions for the aerospace market. Ontic governors optimize the performance of private and commercial fixed wing and rotorcraft aircraft.\n\nHamilton Standard\n\nThe original Hamilton Standard Company was started in 1929. Hamilron Standard was the primary propeller manufacture of pre and post World War I and World War II aircraft. Today, Hamilton Sundstrand designs, manufactures and services aerospace systems and provides integrated system solutions for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft.\n\nEdo Air This governor is no longer manufactured. It has been replaced by the Aero 5000 governor. Call us for pricing.\n\nGarwin This governor is no longer manufactured. It has been replaced by the Aero 5000 governor. Call us for pricing."
