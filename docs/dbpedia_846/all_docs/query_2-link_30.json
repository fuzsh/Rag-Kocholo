        "text": "NR Prop, Luga Prop, Kiev Prop, Aero Prop, Kool Prop...they're all pretty much the same, born from the same original designer and shop. Test one, you've tested them all.\n\nI reached out to Roman a while back to see how he was doing after a particularly bad Russian missile strike hit Kyiv, Ukraine, where his shop is located. He said he was fine, and still shipping props. So I bought one, then asked if anyone else on my FB group wanted me to order while I was at it. I got a few takers and here we are.\n\nWhat prompted me to buy my own foam-core saber blade prop was the recent news that Rotax has come out with the 915 and 916 turbos which weigh just 20-30 lbs more than my YG4s, and put out similar HP. So, for the first time since I built & flew the YG4 Air Command in 2011 there is perhaps another (stock) engine that has a shot at out-climbing my gyro in the two-place category. Finally, some serious competition may be here.\n\nI was told - and therefore expected - that replacing my WD prop with NR would result in a huge improvement in climb, GPH, and AS at any given settings.\n\nWould it surprise you if that ain't so? Well, it surprised the hell out of me, though I have only run a couple of tests on the new NR prop.\n\nHere's what's posted on FB in the Yamaha Aircraft Engines group for Mohawk Aero:\n\n\" Still need to run some more tests on the NR prop but the preliminary data indicates the Warp Drive edging out (pun) the NR/Luga/Aero/Kiev/Kool foam-core saber prop in every category, both climb and speed. Oddly enough, in the cockpit the AOA of the aircraft is definitely greater yet the resultant actual climb angle, or rate of climb (ROC) is worse than my old Warp Drive. The NR jumps off the ground and is better in the first 100 feet of climb, but then the WD leaves it in the dust in virtually every parameter, at every pitch setting.\n\nIn most of the long climbs I find one or two data points where the climb \"pops\", either from a burst of wind or me intentionally jigging the stick. This chart is sorted first by category of length of climb, with over 600' on top, then 500-600 ft, then 400-500 ft, etc. Then each category is sorted with best ROC at top. The bottom section in mauve is the \"pop chart\", best ROC found at any single data point regardless of how long the entire climb test was. I added a column to see what happened when I took the point before and after these pops and averaged them out. In the pop chart the WD is clearly head and shoulders above the NR, it's not even close. In fact, the 3-pt. average is fully 200 FPM above the next closest NR data.\n\nI only just started continuing my climbs to well over 1000' since installing the NR a few weeks ago, so there is an absence of WD data to compare with NR at a full 1000+ ft, which I'll get to later.\n\nTo be fair, I've only done one flight with the NR set at 9500 ERPMs, where my RX1 YG4 puts out a full 140 HP on a good day, so I will run many more NR climb tests in cooler weather before calling this comparison finished.\n\nMy next testing after this season is over will be with a 3:1 gearbox, and we will see if there is a remarkable, comparative difference in running the NR slower than I'm running it now with my 2.72 sprag-clutched Arrow gearbox. I have been told by the vendor that WD props generally fare better than other props at higher speeds, up to 2850 and as high as 3000 (68\" dia), and this test, to date, bears that claim as fact.\"\n\nNone of this is surprising. People keep looking at engine RPM as a gauge of performance instead of power being produced (fuel used).\n\nThe only prop you will find that is significantly lower performance maybe the HTC prop from AutoGyro Gmbh since they decided to design and make their own prop and they are not prop designers. All the props actually designed and made by propeller manufacturers pretty much fall very close to each other if they are the same diameter for the same engine.\n\nI like Kiev prop because in a blade strike, it gives up quickly and I have never seen it damage the engine or even the gearbox. Warp drive is likely to damage the gears in a Rotax engine. A blade or two are less expensive to replace than gears in a Rotax. For rough fields etc. Warp drive would be my choice. Also when we have to claim ASTM compliance and if design standard requires ASTM compliant prop. Warp Drive is a good choice because I have seen their testing report when working on Searey certification with CAAC. Also, it helps that they are Made in the US.\n\nThere is a lot of noise about a French prop called E-Prop. My ex-partner Larry at Evolution Trikes sells them for the US. Larry is the best guy at convincing himself that what he is selling is the best and then he can convince an Eskimo to buy the best ice in the world. I tested it back to back with Kiev. Hardly any difference. Same machine, same weight, same weather. Same with Duc Flash 2. The main difference was double the price and whole bunch of marketing BS. Only real difference in performance will come from diameter of the prop and actual power/fuel being used (not engine RPM).\n\nProps Comparison\n\nProps Comparison Peszke Bollie Warp Drive\n\nNone of this is surprising.

He didn't have numbers or anything just seat-of-the-pants stuff.\n\nBarry Maggio showed up at Barnstormers one year with one of those very thin-blade, 6-blade E-Props. Might have been on one of your machines, a bronze colored job, in fact. It was VERY quiet! He said he loved the performance, but on successive gyros he never ran one or showed up with one again, so...hmm. I would try one but at something like $3500 it's hard to justify the cost on my budget.\n\nI had issues getting an IVO prop to provide predictable performance as the flexible design bends backwards with increasing thrust. Not a fan.\n\nThanks for your input, it helps a LOT to other folks' observations to compare notes.\n\nI think all the 914/915/916 gearboxes run stock slipper clutches for prop strike protection. Those work. They are optional equipment on 912's. I was running an Arctic Cat sled slipper clutch (same exact thing as a Rotax slipper, in fact the same damn $1250 Rotax 912 slipper clutch is sold for their sleds for $450!) when I rolled my YG4 on the beach near Savanna in '16, breaking two blades off the Warp Drive and nearly chopping my arm off in the process. No damage to the prototype Silent Drive (Hy-Vo chain) PSRU, no damage to the YG4.\n\nI did run another climb test on the NR prop with similar results. The Warp Drive beat it in every category, again, under excellent conditions - including S&L flight IAS at a given power setting. I would have liked to have had calm winds, though. It makes this old fart (read shit-for-a-pilot) plenty nervous to maintain a 1200' sustained climb under that kind of power-to-weight ratio (140 hp, 570lbs dry, 803 lbs TOW with 1 hr fuel), at that climb angle (the gyro is pointed much higher/steeper than the actual climb angle that the data suggests) with variable winds moving the gyro around at the same time...If I flew more frequently it would allay that discomfort. Frequent practice = confidence + ability.\n\nI think the power I'm putting through the gearbox may be having its wear effects on my sprag race. When I free-wheel the prop during post/pre-flight inspections I can hear/feel a kind of buzzing that only fits (in my mind) the scenario of the sprag race becoming scalloped, or pitted, where the dogs engage it. Like a race car... If I locked up the brakes on the GT1 Porsche going into a turn, it would flat spot the tires. From then on the tires would more and more easily lock up in that same flat spot, increasing the wear at that point. The sprag does the same thing. So I'm sticking closer to home flying these days, and not doing any aggressive climbs away from the RW. Chances are if the sprag ever rolls (fails) it will be under full power, so I'm not all that concerned to cruise around.\n\nI like what Abid wrote about mistaking ERPM for performance, I am finding more and more that to be spot on. I expected, and actually felt in seat-of-the-pants feedback, that the more ERPM (thus more HP) would absolutely result in better climb and S&L cruise numbers. The best short-time climb fits this notion, but the extended climb as well as S&L cruise is coming on at (prop pitch limited max) 9200 ERPM/ 137 hp - not 9500 ERPM/ 140hp.\n\nAgain, I expect this to change when I test the 3:1 PSRU next season. I would do it now, but I must first move the empennage back a couple of inches, as I have it snuggled right up to the prop to take best advantage of thrust produced.\n\nOff-topic: Something I find very interesting is the \"bow wave\" effect I have observed since installing airfoils over all the struts to reduce drag early 2015, then again 2021. These are held in place on the round tubes with tie wraps, able to seek the AOA of least resistance/turbulence. I set them at a flat AOA, and every time I return home the foils on the port side are all angled down ~30° and the starboard foils are all angled ~30° up! The prop is turning CW, facing from the rear, while the bow wave twist is CCW, against the prop - not with it. This indicates a (low pressure) vacuum-induced wave ahead of the prop. I never got far enough along in Aero engineering to study induction wave stuff, so I'm on my own here.\n\nBet you thought the air was coming straight at the prop until chopped up by it, right? Not so. Considering rotor wash as the cause does not explain the observations of what's going on with the starboard foils at all, it can only be cause by the prop. Next time I run the Silent Drive, which turns the prop in the same direction of the PTO, CCW, my theory can be tested and proven should those air foils then twist in opposite directions to what they rest at in this configuration.\n\nConsequently much of what I thought was torque roll was actually propeller induction lift, and drag over the airframe! That's pretty amazing when ya think about it.\n\nI love those aluminized, mylar air foils. I can't count the number of FW & gyro pilots who've tell me, \"I can see the sun glint off those things from miles away!\"\n\n\"NR Prop, Luga Prop, Kiev Prop, Aero Prop, Kool Prop...they're all pretty much the same, born from the same original designer and shop. Test one, you've tested them all.\" - That's not quite true, or rather, it's not true at all. And I have written about it many times on my pages. Different developers, different development history, different cities, different schools, different design, different sizes.\n\nI will try to make it clear again.\n\nThe first blades for Kyivprop were developed by designer Petrenko in Kiev. I call these blades \"pseudo-arrow-shaped\". Later Petrenko organized his own company, and Kyivprop continued to develop this series of propellers.\n\nClassic straight blades were developed by Aero firm in Lugansk, head Perevoznyuk. Now, in wartime, he is now working in other directions.\n\nLugaprop was spun off from his company and continued to develop propellers with straight blades.\n\nSaber-shaped blades were developed at our firm Lilienthal in Kharkov by engineers Dimitrov and Vasiliev. This propeller was called VN-3 and was produced until about 2000. The project was bought out by Lugaprop and received serious changes in design and technology. Since then Kharkiv and Luhansk people worked together.\n\nLater, the firm NR-prop separated from the firm and moved to Kiev after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nThe remaining part of Lugaprop moved from Lugansk to Russia.\n\nThe Canadian firm Kool-prop sells almost the entire range of Ukrainian and Russian propellers.\n\nWe in Kharkov continue to cooperate with NR-prop, we have a single nomenclature of blades and hubs.\n\nEach company developed its own nomenclature of blades and hubs based on the basic blade geometry. Currently, they are highly inconsistent. The original blade geometry for a 67\" diameter propeller has evolved to diameters from 63\" to 82\". After the classic and saber-shaped blade, elliptical and saber-shaped truncated blades appeared. There appeared particularly strong versions of the blade called \"Eagle Wings\" and \"Black Wings\", designed for gearless engines and engines up to 160 and even up to 300 hp. Different hubs are produced for different bolt-on systems, including Rotax, Jabiru, SAE-1, and SAE-2.\n\nAs for efficiency, over 30+ years of propeller work, I have encountered so many very different evaluations and comparisons, often directly opposite, that I now treat them with great caution. There have been days when my test pilots have brought me speed-lift results of 33 ft/s after using an extension spacer hub! Just comparing performance in a dynamic environment with continuously changing temperature and pressure is a very difficult endeavor even for professional testers. So when people tell me about the fabulous performance they've gotten, I don't disagree, but I don't jump to conclusions. Usually time puts everything in its place.\n\nMost of my operators gave completely disparaging assessments of the Warp drive and rave reviews of our propellers. Therefore, for balance, the opposite point of view should also appear. It is stimulating and encouraging to further work and development.\n\nAttachments\n\n083c87d6-adba-48f3-8e32-a2e473be587a.JPG\n\nспас.jpg\n\nExcellent info! THANK YOU very much for helping with this valuable information.\n\nAllow me add some more detail information to bolster credence of this study to date.\n\nFirst, I have measured absolute pitch, with hub at 90° from level, along the radius of the two props mentioned above in two ways: 1.) increments of 1\" from root to tip, and (2.) as the distance measure between/to each 1° variation.\n\nNext I averaged absolute pitch along the entire blade, and matched the average to the correlating point on the blade to determine a theoretical \"pitch\" in terms of distance the prop should ideally screw through the air with one revolution, since this lies somewhere in the middle of the blade and is non-linear. This method of direct angular measuring works perfectly for Warp Drive with it's flat thrust surface, but I had to increase true AOA from measured angle on the NR prop because its airfoil design does not allow a direct measurement of AOA off the thrust face of the blade. It is instead actually an imaginary line passing through the leading edge of the blade. The factor of correction turned out to be a multiple of 1.1, and with that the actual IAS numbers all fell into place alongside the Warp Drive, on the spreadsheet.\n\nI checked my local airport AWAS before and after each test for accurate density altitude, winds,and temperatures, and made notes of weather app humidity to boot, though this has a rather insignificant bearing on anything and differences were +/- 1 %.\n\nWhen I writeand report \"similar conditions\", I literally mean +/- 100 ft density altitude, +/- 2 mph wind conditions, and TOW +/- 5 lbs (fuel).\n\nEach test I have done has been exceptionally repeatable, and the GPS data is accurate to +/- 3meters per data point per 2.6 seconds, or 10 feet, per 2.6 seconds.\n\nI have found that each data set recorded and processed accurately matches all earlier testing to an extremely fine percentage and am confident these data are as good as it gets.\n\nNone of this testing and data has anything to do with panel instrument readings or any other pilot-recorded information, fudge factors or pilot seat-of-the-pants assessments. It is all purely scientific GPS raw data and hard math.\n\nTime after time, using these methods I find I am getting the very same results to within a highly accurate 2% error, when in fact these type of tests are typically provided a test error margin to within +/-3%. I have not observed any wildly variable results you alude to in my testing, which indicates my methods are inscrutable.\n\nIt is always valuable and quite necessary to consider all other assessments done by others in any scientific testing regimen such as this, but until a certain set of tests can be completed with a high degree of repeatability they are of far less value. I woudl really like to see something nire than a report that your fellows' findings are all over the place, so to speak. It really doesn't give much credence your findings though your candor speaks volumes to your excellent character here .\n\nI have no dog in this show. My interest is purely in finding out what works best for my application, nothing more.\n\nI coined the term \"eurotub\"over a decade ago to lump all semi-enclosed, non-aluminum framed gyrocopters into a single category so that we could easily discuss them as a type airframe without a lot of bother. It took on unflattering connotations as dealers and owners of these expensive gyros showing up to gyro fly-ins became dismissive, arrogant and in certain cases even hostile in personal interactions with the folks flying aluminum frame gyros. These folks have ever since taken umbrage to the term eurotub, but then that's \"not my pig, not my farm\". It is a popular term that's not going away.\n\nIn light of the education now so cordially provided and received on the various prop manufacturers described above it is fitting, helpful, and futuristically expeditious to lump the aforementioned foam-core props into a new category: \"Europrops.\"\n\nWhich is perfect, given that all of the eurotubs seem to come with them as standard equipment, hanging off of Rotax engines.\n\nLooking forward to Barnstormers next weekend. I plan to trailer the Gunslinger AIr Command tandem YG4 140 up and bring 2 or 3 props along, I've been flying the two hours up and two hours return for several years, but no one is taking a trailer up that I can throw fuel and equipment in this time, so...trailor it is.\n\nI'll bring my portable Garmin Etrex GPS and a laptop to crunch the data dumps so we can get some hard results from other gyros there. I'm not going to call it a race, or a competition, though I see no reason why some good-natured ribbing shouldn't take place, eh?\n\nI've been saying for 11 years that I have a tandem gyro that no one can beat in an all-out climb from a full-stop touch-and-go to at least 1000 ft., but now there are Rotax engines flying that should be able to put up a decent challenge to that claim. It should be interesting to see how this plays out. Some of us - me included - are thinking that the newest ELA (Eclipse I thnk it is?) enclosed 916 can beat out my Gunslinger. I'll be sad if it does, but not surprised. Hope the blue one from Ohio is there again! It's my favorite.\n\nGreg's AR1 Edge 154 might have a shot at this, too - but only if it shows up.\n\nThe weather is looking like she'll cooperate, so let's see ya'll there!"
