        "text": "This SB is a visual inspection of the front prop hub. Unfortunately, on the RV-12 there is a Front Spinner Plate blocking the view necessary to inspect the front prop hub. To remove the Front Spinner Plate all six bolts that hold the front prop hub must be removed. Blade pitch angle will need to be re-established when front prop hub is reassembled and re-torqued. This is a lot of work for a repetitive inspection every 50 hours of flight. I fly ~ 150 hours/year so I will have to do this inspection three times annually.\n\nAt some point Sensenisch redesigned the front hub to eliminate the pitch cylinder. Perhaps the large hole in the aluminum hub reduced strength and now cracks are developing along the thinnest edge at 90? to the axis? Maybe this becomes a problem because of the way the Rotax 912 stops so suddenly when you shut it down.\n\nThe new design front prop hub eliminates the large hole and instead has three smaller holes along the central axis of the hub. See drawing below. Special pins are inserted in the two outer holes to rough in the blade pitch angle. Once set, the pins are removed. No more large pitch cylinder and corresponding large hole in front prop hub.\n\nSo I?m wondering if Sensenich will offer the new front prop hub as a one-time fix for this service bulletin. Perhaps discount price, or free replacement, like they did for SB11-04-15 where 2A0R5 revision B Hubs were replaced free because a small percentage of hubs were prone to prop blade pitch loss.\n\nIt will be real nice if I don?t have to disassemble my prop three times/year?\n\nHUB FAILURE\n\nReference this SB and Sensenich Service Bulletin. I was the single failure on a Rotax 912ULS in a 2013 RV12 SLSA. Happened on 6/19/1018 while returning to Prescott, AZ. Was flying at 11,500 at 5300 RPM when a sudden significant harmonic vibration occurred. Not sure what it was but suspected the Prop. Safely returned to Prescott. Upon examination, a crack was observed in the front hub. The crack started at the first pitch setting mark and propagated around the hub. After removing the six bolts, the hub fell off in TWO pieces.\n\nI strongly recommend that anyone who has a Sensenich Prop with the nylon plug for setting pitch, closely follow Sensenich?s SB and inspect their prop ASAP. Had I shed a blade, probably would not be writing this.\n\nHopefully these links to the photos will work. If not, PM me and I'll sent the pictures of the broken hub.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/r9y0zdwzl...opbox.com/s/6mi823v5g8gsoc8/IMG_0148.jpg?dl=0\n\nHere is the complete narrative of the circumstances of the hub failure on N233VA. The narrative was provided to Van's.\n\nPROP HUB FAILURE IN FLIGHT\n\nVans Aircraft SLSA RV12 N233VA Serial # S12007 882 hrs TTSN Hobbs .\n\nOn, 6/19/2018, while flying from Big Bear California to Prescott, AZ, at 11500 ft. I experienced a harmonic vibration that was different than anything I have experienced in an RV12. Although running with some harmonic vibration, I was able to safely return to Prescott, AZ.\n\nAfter returning, I removed the top cowl and the spinner. I suspected the prop but also checked the prop blade pitch. The blades had not moved. Checked the slipper clutch and it was at 456 Inch lbs. Checked the torque on the prop bolts and they were all at 240 inch lbs. While checking the torque on the prop bolts a crack was observed on the front hub. After further examination it was determined that there was a crack on both sides of the hub. Once the prop hub bolts were removed, the front hub fell off in two pieces.\n\nThe aircraft is equipped with a Sensenich Ground Adjustable Prop 2A0R5R70EN-V. Hub Serial Number 21193C , Blade Serial Numbers 34421/R70E and 34218 /R70E.\n\nI contacted Sensenich and spoke with Don Rowell. He stated that there was a service bulletin for cracks in the hub of earlier model hubs, such as the one on my RV12. I told him the details of my experience and he asked me to send Sensenich the hub and blades. He advised that Sensenich would replace the Hub with a newer version and also replace the pins in the prop blades to fit the new version. Prop was a ?C? hub.\n\nThe Prop Blades and Hub were shipped to Sensenich for examination. Van's Aircraft was also notified of this incident.\n\nI checked Vans Support site for bulletins/notifications and could not find any reference to Sensenich prop hubs on Rotax engines. I also checked Sensenich. and found one service bulletin (SB2016-06), \"Inspection of adjustible pitch Jabiru hubs for cracks\". It also references, \"2 blade aircraft hubs with pitch cylinder for Jabiru or other direct drive engines\". It does not mention Rotax Engines, which are a geared engine. However, this bulletin does show exactly the crack location and propagation of the cracks that occurred in this aircraft.\n\nFeel free to contact me at 928-899-0277 or by email should you have further questions.\n\nPhotos Available.\n\nRobert J. Liddell\n\n3110 Adobe Springs Drive\n\nPrescott, AZ 86301\n\n928-899-0277\n\n[email protected] or [email protected]\n\nI didn?t sleep well last night after seeing the picture of the broken prop hub and thinking about what could have happened if one blade separated from the hub. The remaining blade would cause horrific imbalance and most likely shake the engine loose from its mount thus causing an uncontrollable CG shift.\n\nSo today I have decided that I will not fly my plane again until the prop hub is replaced with the improved design. It is unconscionable that I should have to examine the prop hub every 50 hours to look for an eminent failure mode that is documented and known to the manufacturer.\n\nI didn?t sleep well last night after seeing the picture of the broken prop hub and thinking about what could have happened if one blade separated from the hub.

Could be manufacturing defect. Could be improper installation. Bottom line is hub design needs to be robust. Sensenich redesigned the hub and eliminated the large hole - we don't know the reason, but suffice to say, the original design is no longer available.\n\nI inspected my front hub cover i/a/w the SB and found what appeared to be two cracks in the areas indicated in the SB -- the cracks are very difficult to see. I shipped the hub to Sensenich for their evaluation. My 4.5-year-old RV-12 has 650 hours, the prop was dynamically balanced, and the prop has not been used for pushing/pulling the aircraft on the ground. It will now be interesting to see how Sensenich responds to this issue and how long impacted aircraft will be grounded.\n\nPeople keep talking about dynamically balancing prop. Yes, this is good practice but not required by the manufacturer. Prop hub is (should be) designed to withstand significant weight difference in a pair of blades. Manufacturer would do over-stress testing for a critical safety-of-flight product.\n\nI inspected my front hub cover i/a/w the SB and found what appeared to be two cracks in the areas indicated in the SB -- the cracks are very difficult to see.

It will now be interesting to see how Sensenich responds to this issue and how long impacted aircraft will be grounded.\n\nDHeal -\n\nWere you able to inspect the front hub per the SB with the front spinner plate remaining in place or did you have to remove six thru bolts, spacers, and then the front spinner plate?\n\nIt's in the KAI and the maintenance manual - I always look it up and never rely on memory. The bolts use Nord-Lok washers, reusable if you have to remove them.\n\nDuring my first annual last year I of course removed the prop for inspection and noticed the Nord-Lock washers no longer had sharp edges to the tooth pattern ... they had become rounded so I did not feel comfortable using them again.\n\nI attributed this to the need to tighten and loosen the bolts during the pitching process (which I needed to do twice prior to first flight). So I think one may get by reusing the Nord-Lock washers once, but I would suggest if the washers show the slight amount of rounding of the tooth pattern that they should be replaced.\n\nThe washers are quite inexpensive from Senenich so I ordered a handful and plan on replacing them every inspection. As a side note, I attempted to procure Nord-Lock washers locally and discovered the outer diameter of the Nord-Lock washers Sensenich uses is much larger than the standard AN5 Nord-Lock washer size typically stocked in nut & bolt supply houses here locally.\n\nDHeal -\n\nWere you able to inspect the front hub per the SB with the front spinner plate remaining in place or did you have to remove six thru bolts, spacers, and then the front spinner plate?\n\nAfter I removed the spinner I looked at the small bit of hub cover that was visible behind the still-installed front spinner plate -- I saw what appeared to be a very small crack located near one of the pitch degree indicator marks. That was enough for me to be concerned and I proceeded to remove the six bolts, front spinner plate and hub cover. Further close inspection of the now-removed hub cover revealed the cracks. I strongly encourage all to remove the hub cover for the inspection per the SB.\n\nps -- Today I assisted a fellow RV-12 builder/pilot in complying with the SB on his aircraft. His is an older RV-12 (circa 2009? with 800+ hours) with a gold-anodized prop hub that did not appear to be on the compliance list. His hub cover looked fine -- no evidence of cracks. He is going to ask Sensenich if his prop hub's serial number (we could find no \"model number\" on the hub) is outside of the compliance list.\n\nAs others have pointed out already, there just isn't enough room to adaquately inspect the hub without removing the spinner plate. Fortunately, mine looked good after 450h but its tedious to re-pitch each blade to the exact same angle as before.\n\nAfter putting her back together, I flew down to Maryland and had Dave Farmer balance the prop (had been meaning to do this for a while). With a couple of small weights the IPS reading was 0.04 which apparently is good. Started out at 0.19. Definitely flys smoother.\n\nI'm comfortable flying her to OSH, but I would hope Sensenich would set up some sort of credit or trade in program to replace these hub setups with something deemed more reliable. These inspections are not something I want to add to my list of chores every 50h. (I'm also going to need a larger RV-12 SB binder after this year...)\n\nI complied with Sensenich SB2016-06A today and was able to make a good inspection with front spinner plate in-place. 10X magnification and a bright LED flashlight did the trick. As mentioned above, the milling cutter marks add a little challenge.\n\nMy original “B” hub was sent back to Sensenich on 9-16-16 with 168TT for SB11-04-15 (loss of pitch) and replaced with an exchanged “B” hub. This replacement hub is anodized a shiny yellow/gold color which I think would show crack propagation easily. TT on this hub is 198 hours. I also don't know if this hub was new or someone else's hub that was reworked.\n\nIts hard to say how many prop hubs with large pitch cylinder are flying on RV-12’s. Say 1000 RV-12’s flying and maybe half with the old style hub. One catastrophic failure and one hub found with cracks per the SB does not make a good warm feeling. A critical part that is safety-of-flight would need a failure rate something near six sigma (3 per million).\n\nI will wait for Sensenich follow-up on this SB. Hopefully a replacement hub is in the offing...\n\nReference this SB and Sensenich Service Bulletin. I was the single failure on a Rotax 912ULS in a 2013 RV12 SLSA. Happened on 6/19/1018 while returning to Prescott, AZ. Was flying at 11,500 at 5300 RPM when a sudden significant harmonic vibration occurred. Not sure what it was but suspected the Prop.

After removing the six bolts, the hub fell off in TWO pieces.\n\nI strongly recommend that anyone who has a Sensenich Prop with the nylon plug for setting pitch, closely follow Sensenich?s SB and inspect their prop ASAP. Had I shed a blade, probably would not be writing this.\n\nLooking at this photo, I?m struck by three things. 1- The surface finish of the entire part (ignoring the paint) is riddled with irregulaities- not done to the standard I?d expect on a modern critical part. 2- It appears that one of the deep hatch marks may have served as a stress riser from which the crack initially propagated. 3- The irregularity and extreme granularity of the face of the actual failure zone makes me wonder about the consistency of the alloy.\n\nYou are fortunate that the secondary failure was symettrical to the first, such that each blade was retained by three bolts, as I doubt that two bolts could have retained a blade for very long.\n\nIf my math is correct, 50 hours at 2500 RPMs equates to 45 million power strokes(actually, multiply that by the gearbox reduction ratio). After seeing this photo, I?d want to inspect this part far more frequently than that. I?ll bet there is a lot of scrambling behind the doors at Sensenich right now- it will be interesting to see what they come up with as a final fix here.- Otis"
