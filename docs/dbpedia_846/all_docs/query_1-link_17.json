        "text": "From their website:\n\nABOUT SENSENICH PROPELLER COMPANY\n\nSensenich Propeller was established in 1932 to manufacture fixed pitch wood aircraft propellers for the growing aviation market. In 1949 we began to manufacture wood propellers for the burgeoning airboat market. Aluminum propellers for aircraft was added to our product line in the 1950’s. During the 1960’s the use of UAV’s became prevalent and Sensenich was right there with propellers for the new industry. In 1999 We began our highly successful line of ground adjustable composite propellers for Airboat, Aircraft and UAV’s.\n\nEmail Entry\n\nFir​st Na​me:La​st Na​me:Name:Email address:Subject:Message:"
