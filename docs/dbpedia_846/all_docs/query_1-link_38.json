        "text": "Thank you in advance for your help in identifying this propeller. A friend found a 72 inch 2 blade laminated wooden propeller (end to end) with metal along the edge in the barn. Her husband passed away and they were cleaning out. Husband was a truck driver who picked this up on one of his trips. The propeller appears to have a strike. One blade with metal damage and cracked blade. The propeller is dirty where it has been in storage for awhile. I started to clean the propeller up but after reading some of the forum, thought I shouldn't. The propeller has 72LXL46 stamped in the hub area with AF0576 and AF0526 at the blade area. 6 hole pattern (hub about 8 inches across). Early inquiry said this was an airboat propeller with the X in the number. Any help in identifying the propeller manufacturer, age of the propeller and value would be helpful.\n\nsuggestion\n\nHello from Seattle.\n\nDave is right, its really not worth anything because of what it is and its condition. All that being said, and this is just a suggestion. Being that you have nothing invested in it, and its not going to bring any kind of money that is of any high value, and that its already in such a condition that you cant go wrong with incorporating it into a great piece of kinetic sculpture.\n\nIf it were mine, I would get the right dimension bearing to fit the hub as a pressed fit on a simple shaft so that it can turn freely, and then with a bit of simple innovative mating of the right materials, I would make it into a very cool \"wind mill\" of sorts that would be on a fence or where ever you feel it would be a pleasure to watch it spin freely. You could even give it a coat of clear to seal it from water, and even mount some little LED lights on the tips so that you get a red circle at night as it spins in the wind. You have the luxury of having a piece that cant be wrecked anymore than it is, so in essence you have a great piece to experiment with as far as making into an art piece. Let your imagination run wild as this piece isnt a musuem collectable................cheshire grin!\n\nEnclosed is a couple of shots of one of the windmills on my front porch, it a simple one made from a vintage water pump from the front of a engine that drove the fan with a belt, the piece its connected to, is the housing from the front of the engine that was a water passage. This particular hub is a type that was a sealed unit full of oil that could be filled by simple removal of the brass plug. The person I bought this from at a swap meet said it had been in a barn for over 70 years, and it looks it, but the oil resevoir had never been opened, and I will tell you, this thing spins freely in the slightest breeze. Total investment, $20.00\n\nSo there is some inspiration for you to possibly make your air boat prop into a windmill that is able to stand the elements as well with a new life to spin freely. Just a suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDennis Hicklin\n\nSeattle Washington"
