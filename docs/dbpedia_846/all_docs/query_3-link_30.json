        "text": "MT-Propeller Gerd Muehlbauer GmbH\n\nService, Sales and Repair of products from McCauley, Hartzell, Sensenich, Woodward, Goodrich\n\nMT-Propeller Company History\n\nThe FAA and EASA certified service company MT-Propeller Gerd Muehlbauer GmbH was founded in 1980 by Gerd Muehlbauer, who had already 20 years of experience in propeller development and service at this time.\n\nHe started his new own company on January 2nd 1981 at the Airport Straubing-Wallmuehle (EDMS) in Germany with 6 employees in a small, one-storey airport owned building.\n\nIn 1988 MT-Propeller Gerd Muehlbauer GmbH already has received the distributership of all well-known propeller manufacturers in the world.\n\nDue to the quality in work and service and the fair prices, more and more customers placed their confidence in the company and soon, the old airport building was bursting at the seams. A new and - above all - two-storey company building needed to be built at the airport because of the huge Regional Airliner propeller, which more and more came in for overhaul and repair.\n\nNowadays MT-Propeller Gerd Muehlbauer GmbH is well known to customers in Europe and the Middle East for overhaul, repair and sales of products manufactured by McCauley, Sensenich, Hartzell, Hamilton, Dowty, Piaggio, Woodward and Edo-Aire as well as the overhaul and repair of our own MT-Propeller products.\n\nThe all in house composite repair, chemical treatment (anodizing, cadmium plating), NDT, hub rework, tear down inspections and erosion sheath replacement on composite blades is carried out by highly skilled factory trained personnel.\n\nA large stock of spare parts ensures a short turn around time.\n\nExchange propellers are on stock for almost every standard propeller model.\n\nElectronically controlled dynamic propeller balancing on the aircraft can be carried out directly at the Airport Straubing-Wallmuehle (EDMS), the MT-Propeller headquartersâ location.\n\nMT-Propeller is authorized by the manufacturers for warranty repairs and gives also a 12 months or 1000 hours warranty (whichever occurs first) on labour and parts for all work done by the shop.\n\nMany years of experience combined with the continuous training of long term employed propeller specialists enables the company to provide the highest level of quality, which is appreciated by an ever-increasing clientele."
