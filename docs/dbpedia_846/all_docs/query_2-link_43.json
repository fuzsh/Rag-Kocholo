        "text": "Hello Guys,\n\nI have a Rotax 912 on a Rans S12-XL I am going to intall a 3 blade Warp Drive Prop.\n\nI have the following:\n\nOne Set of 6 press fit lugs Rotax Part No.842-634\n\nSix Prop Mount Bolts 8mm X 75 drilled head.\n\nI was checking page 121 on the Rotax Manual about what torque to use on does prop bolt and it say:\n\nROTAX 912 UL, A, F for i = 2,2727: 238 Nm (176 ft.lb.) (at propeller)\n\nROTAX 912 UL, A, F for i = 2,4286: 255 Nm (188 ft.lb.) (at propeller)\n\nROTAX 912 ULS, S for i = 2,4286: 315 Nm (232 ft.lb.) (at propeller)\n\nThen on Warp Drive web page it say the following:\n\nPropeller Bolt Torque Values--All Standard, HP and HPL hubs that use 1/4\" bolts to clamp the blades in the hub should be tightened to 120 inch pounds. All Rotax bolt patterns that use 8 mm bolts to mount the prop to the gear box flange should be tightened to 175 inch pounds. All Standard, HP and HPL hubs that use 3/8\" bolts to clamp the blades or mount the prop should be tightened to 35 foot pounds. Warp Drive propeller installations on direct-drive aircraft engines and other engines used on airboats must tighten the 5/16\" clamping bolts to 200 inch pounds and tighten the 1/2\" flange mounting bolts to 60 foot pounds. Adherence to these torque values is imperative for reasons of safety.\n\nI am including here a pic of my warp drive prop\n\nSo whats your advice????\n\nTHX,\n\nIsaac"
