        "text": "Airframes Alaska recently started selling the Sensenich wood composite seaplane props. They are 80\" and come in pitch between 42 and 47 (I think.) At 17 lbs vs 34 lbs for the aluminum McCauley Borer, and cheaper, it seems like a good alternative.\n\nThe issue seems to be that it's intended for a 180hp engine. Trimmer has the STC for the PA-22 with O-360, but there is also an STC for the PA-18 with O-320 (IIRC) but no STC for PA-22 with O-320. The Borer is STCd.\n\nIs this just an issue of \"no one has gotten around to trying to certify that yet\"? Or is there some real reason it shouldn't be run on an O-320? Guys have been running 8042 and even finer for decades on -18s and -22/20 with no issues other than takeoffs being too short.\n\nHow should I summarize the work description on my field approval 337?\n\nDon't quote me on any of this but I just got off the phone with one of my long time part venders who will be selling this propeller.\n\nPrice is about $4500 for both the 0320 and 0360 model with mounting kit.\n\nThey only have two props that are loaners out for testing. Both went to Valdez so the players out there this weekend could wring it out.\n\nNo current stock but orders taken at AA show last weekend. Hmm, heard that before...\n\nProp is manufactured under car4 so users who have the TCDS that's says \"wood prop...\" Can just bolt on and go?\n\nKevan Asher has some STC\n\n0360 stc is 20/22 tail dragger\n\nTrimmer is working on other STC\n\nHe did say he had one small group of testers bring it back and not like it . Most were positive though.\n\nThey are saying if one is running a 8242 bore the 8038 is a direct replacement.\n\nWood prop with glass Carbon sheath.\n\nMuch wider, 2\"?, cord then Borer...\n\nRocket\n\nSo I just realized something: this new Sensenitch prop is not new at all. It is their original prop dressed in a glass/carbon sheath.\n\nThis is a personal pet peeve of mine.\n\nThis is what sucks about legacy providers.\n\nIn another life I played with a couple gentlemen who specialized in propeller design. I won't bore you with the details of many late night discussions of propellor theory over shots of vodka but propeller efficiency is all about length and optimizing performance by modifying the center of pressure via cord distribution allowing aerodynamic twisting moment to change pitch accordingly. Did I mention the Vodka?\n\nTake a look at the Catto... Whirlwind... not the same old blade shape.\n\nI believe that technology will always drive the strength of aviation into a future of growth, be it a healthy pilot community or sales for those who dare.\n\nShame on another legacy provider to give us the same product wrapped in carbon and a pretty paint job.\n\nRocket\n\nShame on another legacy provider to give us the same product wrapped in carbon and a pretty paint job.\n\nYes, and while we are at it shame on Catto and Whirlwind for giving us new products that don't have type certification. Their new technology is useless to us if we aren't allowed to screw them on to our airplanes.\n\nThe problem here isn't the manufacturers, legacy or newer. As far as I can tell they are all trying to be successful by offering products in very specialized markets. Since none of them are offering the desired product, a more efficient certified propeller, it's a good guess that none of them have been able to justify the investment needed. The propellers that Sensenich is offering for airboats have some interesting shapes (http://www.sensenich.com/product-category/airboat/). So why don't they offer new technology for our aircraft? My guess is the cost of certification vs the number of props they estimate they could sell.\n\nI think the real problem is the regulations under which we have to fly/maintain these airplanes.\n\nTim\n\nTim,\n\nThere is nothing wrong, well much, with the flying and maintaining regulations. I believe we have the most freedom of any country in that regard.\n\nI do agree that the regulations regarding manufacturing of new products is the problem.\n\nAs a rule I usually only think out comments like the one I made above, sometimes type them out, but almost always delete them. I not a fan of complaining without first having a solution to offer up. I should delete this one too\n\nI think our legacy providers have all the means to tackle the FAA. Instead I fear they use their clout to tackle competition. The FAA knows nothing about making propellers or engines or avionics and I am sure they have to go to those who do. I have to service a couple Garett Otters and before I touch them my first call is to our Honeywel rep. Now if I called Ben about a PT6 he might tell me they are junk because he wants All the Otters to have the Gerett burner. I specifically recall reading about Cessna lobbying to keep New AN -2 aircraft from being imported to America. Something about inferior hardware, on an aircraft and power plant that had proven itself for over fifty years.\n\nI think Sensenitch blew it when they didn't off to ether team up or purchase outright the Catto product; or Hartzell or whoever.\n\nThe key value of American business is in innovation and growth. When we end up with stifling them to protect legacy interest it will be those willing to team up that win.\n\nRocket\n\nRocket,\n\nWell I'm glad you did post your thoughts this time. I think it's important for the future of flying that we talk about this stuff.\n\nOne point is that I've worked on FAA certification projects for a legacy provider, and tackling the FAA was not at all how it went. It was a huge amount of work. Any ignorance of the subject matter only made them less comfortable to approve anything. So you end up doing analysis and/or testing that really isn't needed but they want to see it. Maybe your experience has been different?\n\nWhen it comes to the legacy players using the regulations to stifle competition I agree that's a problem. And it's not unique to this industry. You'll find examples anywhere that has significant government regulation. Great example I read about recently was with Uber. For years now they have fought taxi regulations in city after city to be able to offer an alternative that many customers prefer to traditional taxi cab service. But now that Uber has clout they are supporting new regulations in certain cities that would limit transportation services to large fleet providers, i.e. Uber. This is designed to keep smaller start-ups from out-innovating the innovator. So this happens all the time when a firm reaches a dominant position. But if you take away the regulation you take away the opportunity to play this game. In your example, Cessna would have no choice but to compete head to head with the AN-2.\n\nIf regulation is stifling innovation, I don't understand how teaming helps in this situation. It doesn't change the cost of certifying a new product, correct? So how does it help?\n\nTim\n\n\"Prop is manufactured under car4 so users who have the TCDS that's says \"wood prop...\" Can just bolt on and go?\"\n\nThe PA-22 and PA-200 TCDS both specify a fixed pitch metal propeller with a Lycoming O-320.\n\nThe only engine option that allows for a wooden prop is the Lycoming O-290 and that is limited to a maximum diameter of not over 74 inches.\n\nThe only way I can see for a 80\" wood prop on an O-320 would be via STC. Unfortunately.\n\nProps, at least older designs are designed and manufactured to CAR 14, not CAR 4. The PA-20 and PA-22 series are CAR 3 airplanes, so prop installation would be CAR 3.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
