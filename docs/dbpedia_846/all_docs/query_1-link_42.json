        "text": "I flew the 5 place Sherpa with IO-720 and big 3 blade propeller. It flew slow, took off short lightly loaded but I would not want to fly it day in day out against a light weight nimble cub.\n\nI never flew the 8 place Sherpa with the IO-720 but the concept was similar to the 5 place. The engineering on the Sherpa was hit and miss I think, they took cub like design and made it bigger.\n\nThe 5 place Sherpa had some quirks that made it less then user friendly, when you got it slow with full flaps it felt unstable. When you put the power to it on take off it was very pitch'y.\n\nThey then put a turbine engine with the same wing and fuselage that the 8 place had. I flew in that airplane (back seat) as Paul Claus test flew it and it was not right, in fact Paul was not impressed from what I remember, it was not safe according to Paul. Then a person decides he has to have one and Sherpa is more then happy to sell one to him. On the test flight the test pilot that has a lot of time in the IO-720 8 place almost wrecks it and refuses to fly it again. They then call a real test pilot (that is what he does for a living) and he almost bails out of it flying it from SPB to UAO where it is to undergo a complete make over. The engineer determine that the airplane is to short coupled and needs the fuselage stretch more then 4 feet but the guys hangar is not big enough to go more then 4 feet so that is what they decide to do (better then nothing). When you are building airplanes hangar size should not dictate engineering requirements. They also determine that the wing is to far forward by feet not inches and decide to change that also. The rudder and vertical are to small and the horizontals and elevator also I believe. They make all theses changes and the test pilot makes return trips to evaluate the stages of changes because they want to spend the least amount of money to make it airworthy so they do it in steps based on what the test pilot thinks is going to be most effective in making this airplane safe to fly. What I say here is just to illustrate that more needs to go into building an airplane then just bolting on a bigger engine with more HP, maybe Mike has done all the calculations to make this airplane right maybe it will be just PFM. Since he is sharing as he builds it, it is hard to see if there was serious thought about all that needs to happen to make an airplane work correctly.\n\nI know nothing about Draco except for what I have seen and it is impressive but could anyone with say a lot of Turbine Otter time just hop into that airplane and fly it safely. Or is it an airplane that has quirks that would make it dangerous.\n\nThere is not a single thing about Draco that transfers over to the kind of Cub flying that I can afford and enjoy. It is a eye catching, money sucking show plane that only average mortals can only slobber over. All that being said I like his crazy ideas so keep them coming.\n\nIf he needs someone to prove that a guy with a lot of off airport time and a little turbine time can fly Draco just fine have him give me a call.\n\nIf he needs someone to prove that a guy with a lot of off airport time and a little turbine time can fly Draco just fine have him give me a call.\n\nContrived or not he does not need to call me to fly the Scrappy Cub unless it is PFM. I think it is going to be a less than fun for contrived off airport flying.:lol:\n\nI think you meant to say a lot of contrived off airport time for sport and the camera.\n\nBesides, if you want to fly Draco so bad, you should call him.\n\nI have never called anyone to fly an airplane and never will. Every airplane I have ever flown is because someone called me and wanted me to experience it. In most cases I was somewhat apprehensive as I don't consider myself a person with a lot of experience in different types of airplanes... That being said I moved out of my comfort zone for the experience because I figured I would never get a chance at affording my own airplane of that type. In every case when I got back into my own airplane it was a relief to be in something that felt natural again.\n\nGreg\n\n.

In every case when I got back into my own airplane it was a relief to be in something that felt natural again.\n\nGreg\n\nDone a bunch of first flights on my own scatter brained designs as well as a few for others. I have found that we all are obliviously more partial to what we spend our time in. Have always told folk who move to a new mount, Don’t make any decisions on it till you have at least 50 hours.\n\nA lot of times, the things that you are obsessed about in the first few hours turn out to be no concern after you get use to it. Sometimes the quirks can be an advantage when you learn how to use it. In aerobatics, When you move to a new mount, Even if it’s of the same design, you are not effective with it usually till around 60 to 80 hours. It’s then you are feeling the wings lift in your hand and the rudder in your feet!\n\nSo it’s no surprise when a pilot spends on a few hours in a new mount that they always feel theirs is a better flyer.\n\nOn Pateys new design, With his history of past builds....My money is on it doing exactly what he’s designing it to do !"
