        "text": "The “R” Series composite ground adjustable propeller was Sensenich’s 2nd generation wide blade introduced to market as a improved design over the original K series blade. The 79R series incorporated improvements in airfoil design and laminate technology to achieve superior performance over the 1st generation wide blades. It was also the 1st wide blade option introduced to the market with the integrated I-beam laminate construction. The swept blade shape technology helped to reduces noise and decreases metal leading edge wear. These blades can be used on automotive and aircraft engines with reduction units suitable for 2.0 up through 3.5+ ratios. The 4 blade R Series was one of the most popular propellers found on Airboats producing 450 – 1000+ HP, but after the introduction of the 79NGR series blade, the R series sales tapered off. Today, many R series blades are built mostly as replacements for customers that do not want to upgrade to a newer design or that have an older Powershift / Water Walker hub and just need a set of blades to get them back on the lake.\n\nThe R Series is an awesome prop for all around performance on all engines with reduction units, it offers great low end push coupled with tremendous top end speed.\n\nAll Sensenich composite ground adjustable blades are manufactured using an internal pressure, closed mold system. Aerospace grade epoxy pre-impregnated composite materials are cured at an elevated temperature to give the optimum strength at the minimum weight. A co-cured stainless metal leading edge is bonded on flush with the airfoil.\n\nThe R series blade is only available for use in Legacy 3 ring style hubs."
