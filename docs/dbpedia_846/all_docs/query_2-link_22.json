I was told $2850 for the composite ground adjustable for the 0-320 and $2900 for the fixed pitch aluminum. I think the only reason not to use the composite may be longevity but I dont know anybody who has had one for all that long so who really knows. It would be really great if sombody would do some performance trials with the two and post them. I have a good friend who changed out his fixed pitch wood prop to one of these and got a huge performance boost.....gained a bunch of speed with no rate of climb loss. Problem is he was flying a cubcrafters cub with a continental 0-200 so no chance the numbers will translate. He is convinced that his speed gains are due to propeller efficiency, not pitch change. In any case it looks pretty groovy...\n\nCheers.\n\nEvan\n\nI asked about these the other day while on the phone with Vans and they do have them with a discount.

In any case it looks pretty groovy...\n\nCheers.\n\nEvan\n\nEvan,\n\nWho did you speak with? I emailed the same question just today and was told that the only Sensenich props they sell are what's on the order form. All metal.\n\nSensenich Ground Adjustable Propeller\n\nI saw the recent announcement that Sensenich is coming out with a new composite prop for RVs with 0320s at a price of $3,500 and went to their website for more information. The website listed a composite ground adjustable propeller for 0320s for $3,750, which apparently has been listed since 2010. I found that confusing, so I emailed them for clarification as to whether this recently announced prop was the same or a different prop, the correct pricing, and any info re the spinner or other associated equipment they were apparently coming out with.\n\nCharley at Sensenich in Plant City just replied as follows: (a) \"It is the same propeller. It is just now coming entering production\", and (b) \"The spinner manufacturer is working on the tooling now. The price of this 13? carbon spinner will be about $625.00.\" He didn't respond re the fact that the announcement says the price is $3,500, whereas the website is showing $3,750 (at least it was when I emailed them a few days ago), but it seems obvious the newly announced price of $3,500 must be the one. I'm assuming you don't need to order their spinner unless you want it.\n\nI too will be looking forward to hearing the results of the side by side comparisons between the Catto and the new Sensenich. However, I note that the Catto Jesse said he will be using in the comparison will be a 68x70. I called Craig Catto about a year ago regarding a possible new prop for my RV-4 and said I was most interested in getting top end speed. I told him I used to have (before it got nicked) a Warnke (74x74 I believe, but I could be mistaken) that really hauled *** and hope to duplicate the performance. Craig said he has put many props on RV-4s, and the prop he found that gives @200mph at @2800rpm is his 70x71 model. Obviously, everyone's speed will vary depending on the usual variables, but I understood him to mean that if you're most interested in top end speed, that's the one to order from him for the 0320.\n\nCraig said he has a totally different way of measuring pitch than Warnke had, so the fact that I had a really fast Warnke at a particular pitch doesn't translate at all for purposes of ordering a prop from him.\n\nAnyway, the point is, the 68x70 doesn't sound like Craig's fastest prop for the 0320. Do you guys know whether the 68x70 Catto is regarded as a climb prop, or something in between a cruise and climb prop? Whatever, the test results should be interesting. In my opinion, that Sensenich would have to be pretty darn good to justify the price difference and for that reason alone I'm probably sold on the Catto already.\n\nNevertheless, after reading the posts from the guys with constant speed props that are leaking oil/grease and having to be shipped for expensive overhauls, the ground adjustable prop in comparison has a lot of appeal.\n\nNo weapon too short...for a brave man\n\nWe don't do that with constant speeds, and perhaps that's the advantage of a ground adjustable.\n\nNo, but you do have hub AD's (if you care), inspections, RPM restrictions, maintenance and $$$ overhauls. You also glide like a brick with a loss of oil pressure. I know, I've owned three. For many builders (me included) the higher cost and weight of CS is simply, prohibitive.\n\nA ground adjustable pitch, light composite prop for RV's (or Thorps or Tailwinds etc...) from Sensenich is a home run IMHO. Living here in Sensenich's test area, the hub and blade design was extensively tested on Lycoming powered Airboats for the past 8 years in some of the most challenging environments out there, water and sand. Airboaters told me stories of tree limb trimmings, water strikes, debris dropped by passengers sucked through the prop (ice chests, fishing poles) with no damage.\n\nHaving owned both FP and CS, I still prefer a light nose, light weight airplane. My RV's have been exposed to every possible challenge including lots of form flying, 1V1's, Sport Aerobatics and numerous visits to the USFS strips in the Idaho and MT backcountry and gross weight takeoffs from Leadville. My 150HP RV4 with a \"tree-derived\" propeller held it's own and excelled in every arena. Just like the Van's brochure claimed...\n\nFlown properly a well matched FP propeller mated to a very light airframe can easily match or exceed the capabilities of any CS out there for less weight and cost. Being able to adjust the pitch for specialized flying (aerobatics, very short strips or racing) is even better. If it's half as good as my Catto prop, it will be a winner.\n\nV/R\n\nSmokey"
