In the towns, hundreds of houses dating from the 17th and 18th centuries are preserved by more than 100 local or national historical societies.\n\nState or private organizations maintain numerous sites important in Connecticut’s past or associated with illustrious individuals. Notable among these are Fort Griswold State Park in Groton, Old New-Gate Prison and Copper Mine in East Granby, the homes of Harriet Beecher Stowe (1871) and Mark Twain (1874) in Hartford, the Tapping Reeve House (1773) and Law School (1784) in Litchfield, and (William) Gillette Castle State Park in East Haddam. Perhaps the best-known is Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, where a small New England seaport has been re-created with all its ships and shops. Outdoor enthusiasts can hike the many miles of trails and camp in the 30 state forests or 90 state parks that in all cover some 250 square miles (650 square km). Colourful autumn foliage draws large numbers of visitors to Connecticut and the rest of New England. Minor league baseball and ice hockey are popular, as is the Connecticut Sun, a professional women’s basketball team based in Uncasville. Sport fishing, particularly for bluefish, is popular in Long Island Sound. Two large gambling casinos operated by Native Americans also attract many visitors.\n\nArt exhibitions are held annually in many cities, a number of which have art galleries and museums. The best-known are three facilities at Yale—the University Art Gallery, the Center for British Art, and the Peabody Museum of Natural History—all located in New Haven; the Bruce Museum of Arts and Sciences, in Greenwich; the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, in Hartford; and the New Britain Museum of American Art. Symphony concerts and concerts by smaller groups are presented regularly in the larger communities. Several educational institutions have public concerts throughout the year. Repertory companies operating in or near resort areas in the summer include the Westport County Playhouse in Westport and the Oakdale Musical Theatre in Wallingford. The American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, and the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam are well known. The Yale School of Drama (founded 1925) was the first such school at an institution of higher learning. Southwestern Connecticut is also within easy reach of the vast artistic resources of New York City."
