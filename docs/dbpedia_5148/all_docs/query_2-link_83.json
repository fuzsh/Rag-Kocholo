Maybe the repetition, though, can drum into our heads a lesson we try to keep out: “Modern societies are not immune to the horror of a war of extinction,” and American society could also “descend into barbarism and obliteration.” After all, America sent about 750,000 bodies into obliteration between 1861 and 1865. Southerners could have accepted in 1861 the original thirteenth amendment, approved by both the House and the Senate, which guaranteed that slavery could continue in the states where it already existed. They refused. Why? Erik …\n\nHow Adverse Childhood Experiences Turn into Homelessness\n\nWould you rather be rich or loved? Many of us might want to be both, but Rob Henderson, author of Troubled: A Memoir of Foster Care, Family, and Social Class, understands what's most important: \"For happiness, it's better to be poor and loved than rich and unloved.\"\n\nComing Out of Trouble\n\nRob Henderson’s Troubled: A Memoir of Foster Care, Family, and Social Class (Gallery Books, 2024) is well worth reading. I’ll give you two reasons Henderson’s life and book are not exceptional, then two reasons why they are. 1. Sad to say, Henderson’s background does not make his book exceptional these days. Mother: drug addict. Father: nowhere in sight. Number of foster care placements: ten, more than the national average of seven or eight. Once a child gets past three he often lives with dread, the word Henderson says best summarizes his feelings while growing up and sliding down. He dreads “suddenly being moved somewhere else. . . . The dread was sharp — I’d see an unfamiliar car outside or a puzzled look on a foster parent’s face and …\n\nThe Foster-Care-to-Homelessness Pipeline\n\nEarlier this month I wrote about the regular Wednesday dinners for unhoused humans at the University Avenue church. This week I'll write about a Friday night fundraising dinner in a church gym four miles further north. The beneficiary: Safe Families for Children of Austin — one of a hundred Safe Family chapters in 30 states that try to keep children from having the traumatic experiences that contribute to the psychology of homelessness.\n\nCould Shared Housing Help Curb Homelessness?\n\nThis week I'm writing about an unconventional man mostly ignored, Michael Ullman. My January 13, 2023 column examined his work, which grows out of his 25 years of experience in managing and researching homeless services, and his hundreds of conversations with people living in shelters and on the streets. He is still rowing against the current with his National Homeless Information Project.\n\nThe Blazing World: A New History of Revolutionary England\n\nOn July 4 we celebrated the rare revolution that worked. This page focuses on two wonderfully readable books about the mostly unsuccessful 17th century revolution that preceded America’s 18th century one, and the partly successful 19th century revolution that followed. Jonathan Healey’s The Blazing World: A New History of Revolutionary England, 1603-1689 (Knopf, 2023) features vivid, specific detail. Some on the Puritan side who opposed any physical depiction of Jesus “used a statue of Christ for musket practice, cheering when they hit it in the face.” In London, Sir John Clotworthy used his halberd—an ax blade topped with a spike—to rip up a Rubens painting of the crucified Christ. That’s what happened to objects. Subjects—human beings—often had it worse. In the …\n\nCommunity — Not Housing — First\n\nCan people, laden with childhood traumas plus the hard experience of years of homelessness, overcome their pasts? On a Monday afternoon in May, I threw that question at Alan Graham, founder and CEO of Austin's Community First! Village (CFV), where close to 400 formerly homeless humans now live.\n\nA Church Dinner for the Homeless\n\nAt 5:50 pm on a drizzly day in May, in the parking lot closest to the church's back entrance, backpacks held spots in line for the central Austin homeless who sat on a nearby patch of grass, waiting for dinner.\n\nHomelessness is Exceptionally Hard to Solve\n\nSunrise pastor Mark Hilbelink said its navigation center last year helped more than 800 people get off the streets. Michael Busby was typical among those who benefited. He told the press that Sunrise staffers \"helped me out a lot. They helped me restore my sanity. They help out with housing, they help out with medication, they keep your meds for you, and they give them out to you every day or every week.\"\n\nMiddle America Has a Lot to Teach us About Homelessness\n\nIn this episode, I’m joined by Discovery Institute Senior Fellow Marvin Olasky who is the author of 29 books, the former editor of WORLD Magazine, and has spent the last year living in homeless programs across the U.S. to learn from the people living in them. We discuss the bias of West Coast journalism, what makes programs successful, and the stories of people Marvin has lived …\n\nNot In My Backyard: When Serving the Homeless Clashes with Neighbors\n\nFive miles southwest of \"Church Under the Bridge\" is Sunrise Community, a church that's part of everyday trench warfare against homelessness. At 11 am on Wednesday, May 22, 60 people (mostly in T-shirts and worn jeans, and carrying plastic shopping bags) waited patiently in two quiet lines. One line was for lunch: Two volunteers sat at a table handing out cups of cold water and plates of pizza and sandwiches. The other line was for everything else, including picking up ID cards and bus passes. One window was for getting mail — for thousands, it's their only address.\n\nMission Possible: Feeding Bellies and Hearts in Austin\n\nLast month, starting on a Sunday morning, I learned more about the intractability of homelessness in my home city, Austin, Texas. During three decades of \"Church Under the Bridge\" Sunday morning services, some of the faces have changed but the overall tragedy of lost lives has not.\n\nFamilies, Politics, Baseball, Movies\n\nWe all tend to favor life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but what happens when the pursuit ruins children’s happiness (and sometimes keeps them from life itself)? Melissa Kearney’s The Two-Parent Privilege (U. of Chicago, 2023) shows that the national Wars on Poverty and Drugs have been less effective than the War on Family that the cultural left has waged for sixty years. In 1960 5% of births were to unmarried mothers: Now the figure is about 50%. Some reasons—worse job prospects for working class males, better prospects for women—have economic roots. Some are cultural: Kearney notes, “The conventional mores in the United States today are to treat matters of family and family formation with a dedicated agnosticism, avoiding any suggestion that one type of family …\n\nBeyond the “Vets, Pets, and Kids” View of Homelessness\n\nThis column starts my third year of weekly writing about homelessness, with the goal of learning, teaching, and eventually turning the columns into a book. Both human interest and intellectual interest propel me. I'll start with the human interest and the two words \"suffered enough.\" The expression comes to mind every time I live in a homeless shelter for a few days and ask residents about their pasts.\n\nHelping New York Orphans: What Went Wrong, and Right\n\nThe past two weeks I’ve given a largely positive view of how Charles Brace and others helped homeless children in New York (and other northeastern cities). But when orphan trains headed west from 1853 to 1929, sometimes things went wrong.\n\nGo West, Children: How Charles Brace Placed Orphans in Families\n\nLast week I wrote about how Charles Brace set up homes for homeless children but did not see institutionalization as ideal. He wondered whether it was possible to find thousands of families willing to take responsibility for the children of the streets. The problem seemed enormous. Brace wrote: \"How were places to be found? . . . And when the children were placed, how were their interests to be watched over, and acts of oppression or hard dealing prevented or punished?\"\n\nCaring for Orphans in New York City\n\nTwo columns ago I mentioned Charles Brace's concern about high rents in New York City. When Brace founded the New York Children's Aid Society in 1853, he began by setting up religious meetings aimed at orphaned or abandoned boys from 10 to 18 who slept in alleys.\n\nThe Wrongs of Spring\n\nTwo decades ago John Judis and Ruy Teixeira prophesied big changes in their book The Emerging Democratic Majority. Their new book asks, Where Have All the Democrats Gone? (Henry Holt, 2023). Essentially, college-educated professionals (some with unorthodox lifestyles) have now pushed out “many of the people in the deindustrialized towns and small cities of middle America stripped of essential elements of their identity.” Now that Democrats are no longer “the party of the common, average, ordinary man and woman,” good Republican candidates often win. The Hollow Parties by Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld (Princeton University Press, 2024) shows why both Republicans and Democrats aren’t able to select the candidates most likely to win: Money talks and political parties no …\n\nGo West, Young Man (and Woman)\n\nWe often think westward migration was for males only. In 1862 the Homestead Act allowed land claims from “any person who is the head of a family, or who has arrived at the age of twenty-one years.” Women, including those widowed by the Civil War, made one third of all homestead claims. Some men and women who made it to the Midwest and went no further became homeless."
