BENJ. BRODIE WINBORNE. May, 1906.\n\nHERTFORD COUNTY COURT HOUSE, WINTON, N.C\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nHertford County is rich in the character of her families and in the acts and deeds of her sons, in war and in peace, but poor in her records.\n\nOn the night of August 22, 1830, the entire records of the county were destroyed by fire. One Wright Allen was indicted in our Superior Court for forging the name of Timothy Ridley of Maney's Neck, and thinking that the note was in the court-house and that by burning the same be could destroy the evidence of his guilt, he touched the torch to the building, and quickly the court-house and all the records of the county, from its foundation, were consumed by the flames. The records of seventy years of the county's history were within a few hours blotted from human eyes. Again on February 20, 1882, the records of this splendid county, together with the court-house were ruthlessly burned by the Union soldiers during the cruel war between the American States. The date of this fire is hard to determine. I find reliable authorities fixing it February 20, March 20, and May 20. It is, however, immaterial. The will books since 1830, and a few of the old record books of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, which happened to be in Murfreesboro, where the Clerk resided were saved. Hence appears the reason why I have undertaken the Herculean task of trying to reproduce some of the past history of the county. I have been practicing law in the county since 1875 and I have so often felt the dire need for these lost records.\n\nI beg that my imperfect history may be read with sympathy for its author. Much of my information I secured\n\nfrom old deeds among my father's papers. His deeds carry me back to 1812, and one as far back as 1762, and gives the name of the first Clerk of the County Court. The deeds and old wills and copies of records of other families which have been kindly furnished me, have enabled me, with the old Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, to bring together this imperfect history of a noble people.\n\nBENJ. B. WINBORNE.\n\nMay, A. D. 1906.\n\nThe Colonial and State Political History of Hertford County, N. C.\n\nPUBLIC PRIDE.\n\nFor centuries and ages, nations and subdivisions of nations, and governments, have honored their heroic and noble dead. Monuments, statues, histories, and other records have been resorted to as far back as recorded time to commemorate and perpetuate the deeds, the acts, the successes and the mistakes of prominent and leading characters. Not only that those in the future may live and profit by the noble deeds of the past and shun the ignoble deeds and mistakes of a preceding generation, but to gratify and perpetuate their pride of their great dead.\n\nWe have been unable to find in recorded history of the civilized world any nation; any government, any state, any county, or any political division of a territory, that was not proud of its noble men and women; and in some way were willing to hand down to future generations the history of the proud deeds of its subjects and its sublime characters.\n\nSuch is the history of religion, of the science of goverments of literature, of philosophy, of the science of war, and everything else. What we know and enjoy to-day is due to our knowledge of the past. Our Christianity, our civilization is, today, the acme of our knowledge of the past. We are all the time building on the past, without which we could not obtain a solid foundation, but would be building on a sandy foundation. What would we know about our Savior and the sufferings of Jesus of Nazareth on the cross, and the beauties and attractions of Heaven, but for the recorded words in the Holy Bible? What would we know of the world, and its great men, its inventions, its advancements in civilization, and the progress of mankind in everything, were it not for the histories, the monuments, statues and other\n\npyramids, written and erected for the guidance of those to come afterwards?\n\nA nation, a country, a state, a county that has not pride of its noble dead, is composed of a mankind fit only for \"treason, strategem, and spoils,\" and for the habitation of Hell. We have been often asked why we should be interested in writing a history of the by-gone days of Hertford County. Why, they are the most glorious days of our life! All the sunshine, all the hopes, and all the beauties of life are in those days. Ancestors, parents, friends, and other noble men and women, help to make the grand history of this old political subdivision of the State. We are proud of its history; proud of its dead. We love to sing the songs of its praises. A being who has no love for his county and the noble deeds of its dead has no soul. He is like the \"lean and hungry Cassius\"—dangerous. Let us remember—let us love until the end of time.\n\nWhen we think of the true, and devoted sons of the Colonial days, of the brave and loyal sons of the Revolutionary times, of the determined and self-sacrificing sons of the infant days of the State and Republic, and the gallant and courageous soldiers of the county whenever the liberties, rights and freedom of the people of the States were involved, and the part its great men took in shaping the laws of the country and in the perpetuation of its institutions, we feel like exclaiming \"O, fortunate country, who had such sons to be the herald of thy fame!\"\n\nAMERICA.\n\nTo know well the child we should know its parents.\n\nColumbus discovered America—the New World—the unknown land—in the year 1492. It was a beautiful part of Nature's landscape Its coasts, its level lands, its hills and valleys, its magnificent forests, and its grand and placid streams of water filled the hearts and souls of Columbus and his companions with untold and indescribable joy. It\n\nwas uninhabited except by wild beasts and savage tribes of Indians. Where the Indians came from we do not know. They seemed to be indigenous to the soil. The Great God of Nature created and placed them here, as he did the beasts of the forest. Columbus returned to the Old World, his native land, and told of the New World he had discovered. He told them of its beauties and its attractions. The popular mind soon became emblazoned with imaginary pictures and pent-up glories and blessings of this fairy land beyond the broad and deep waters. The whole of Europe became excited. Soon, voyages began to be made, in crude crafts, across the billows of the mighty oceans to reach the new land of flowers and take possession of it and make it the home of the free and the asylum of the oppressed. Old England quicky proceeded to profit by the discovery of Columbus and take possession of this new and far-off land, about which the Old World had become so much aroused by the reports of Columbus, a native of Italy the land of valor and beauty.\n\nBancroft's History of the United States is the most delightful treatise on the early and primeval days of the Western Continent the reader can obtain. Of the discoveries of the lands along the musical and poetic borders of the Rio Grande and of the mighty Mississippi Valley, the widespreading lap of the Western Continent, the reader can find no more pleasing and fascinating accounts than Prescott's Histories of Mexico and Peru. Ridpath's recent History of the United States is, also, written in a most interesting style. Its rhetoric is ornate and easy.\n\nThe early settlers of the New World experienced great troubles with the native Indians and many of them were murdered by these wild, barbaric natives. The New World was called America in honor or Amerigo Vespucci, which was an undeserved honor.\n\nOn the 25th day of March, 1581, Queen Elizabeth of England granted to Sir Walter Raleigh a charter authorizing him to take possession of an extensive territory of land in America, extending from the 33d to the 40th parallel of north latitude, and to people it and organize a state, to be governed by Raleigh, as lord-proprietor. This territory was called Carolina. The granting of this charter was the first step in the work of English colonization in America. Five voyages were made under it, but without success in establishing a permanent settlement. Raleigh's vessels landed at Roanoke Island, where he landed his colonists and attempted to effect a settlement, but the hostility of the Indians was too great. One of his colonies left on the island, consisting of 108, were lost, and no account of them has ever been given. It is known as the \"lost colony.\" The Indians evidently destroyed them. On the 18th day of August, 1585, Virginia Dare was born on this island. She was the first English white child ever born in the New World.\n\nRaleigh finally abandoned his efforts.\n\nAgain, on the 20th day of March 1663, King Charles, the Second, granted a charter for Carolina to Edward, Earl of Clarendon George, Duke of Albemarle, William, Lord Craven, John, Lord Berkley, Anthony, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkley and Sir John Colleton, to be Known as the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. They were granted all the land extending from the north end of the island called Lucke Island, in the southern Virginia seas, and with six and thirty degrees of the north latitude, and to the west as far as the South Seas, and southerly as far as St. Matthias River, on the coast of Florida. The territory of country was not named Carolina in honor of Charles II, as some writers have it, but it was named \"Carolina\" by John Ribault, a French navigator, as early as 1562.\n\nThe Lords Proprietors were invested with power to set up a form of government of their own, to make laws for the government of the people, to hold courts, and do all acts and exercise all other powers desired to gratify their lordships.\n\nThe first permanent settlement in Carolina is stated by Bancroft to have been made immediately after the expulsion of the Quakers from Virginia in 1662.\n\nOn July 30, 1665, King Charles II. granted the same Lords Proprietors a second grant, extending the boundaries of Carolina north and eastward as far as the north end of Currituck River, upon a straight westerly line to Wyanoke Creek and so on.\n\nThe area of Carolina, under this charter, was a million of square miles, and included a large part of Mexico, all of Texas, all our territory south of 36 deg. 30 min. and west of Arkansas, and the lands now embraced in the States of North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana. But the grantees only had possession of a small part of the territory.\n\nIn 1669, John Lock, of England, wrote the first constitution for the Proprietary government of Carolina. Ashley Cooper, one of the Lords Proprietors, afterwards wrote an amendment to it. But the framework of the whole fabric was too impracticable and metaphysical, and it was never fully put in operation. It was finally abrogated, in 1693, by the Lords Proprietors.\n\nOn September 8th, 1663, Sir William Berkley, Governor of Virginia, and one of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina, was directed to visit the settlement on Albemarle, and organize a regular government. He did so. George Drummond was appointed Governor, and a council of six was also appointed, and thus was formed the infant colony thereafter known as the County of Albemarle.\n\nNORTH Carolina.\n\nIn the year 1697 that portion of Carolina lying north of the Santee River became known and recognized as North Carolina, and the southern portion as South Carolina. The County of Albemarle was in North Carolina. Later this colony became subdivided into three counties.\n\nHertford County was not one of the original subdivisions of the territory of the colony of North Carolina. At the close of the Indian War of 1711, North Carolina was divided into three counties—Albemarle, Bath, and Clarendon. These counties were subdivided into precincts. Albemarle was divided into Currituck, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Chowan, Bertie, and Tyrrell precincts. Bath was divided into Beaufort, Hyde, Craven, and Carteret precincts. Clarendon County had only one precinct, New Hanover. Bertie precinet was carved out of Albemarle County territory in 1722. Northampton County was formed in 1741 from a portion of the territory of Bertie.\n\nGOVERNORS OT THE COUNTY OF ALBEMARLE.\n\nGeo. Drummond, appointed in fall 1663.\n\nSamuel Stevens, appointed in October, 1667; died early in 1674.\n\nSir Geo. Cartwright, President of the Council, 1674. He returned to England in 1676.\n\nThomas Miller, appointed, to fill vacancy, in 1677.\n\nCULPEPPER'S REBELLION.\n\nIn Nov. 1777, Sir Geo. Eastchurch was appointed Governor of the County of Albemarle, and left England, but when he reached the West Indies he fell in love with a beautiful girl and lingered there. After making known his devotion they were married. He then renewed his journey to North Carolina. When he reached the shores of the new country he found that one Culpepper had, in December, 1677, usurped the government and proclaimed himself governor. Eastchurch\n\ntried to suppress Culpepper's usurpation, and secured the aid of the Governor of Virginia, but failed, and thereby by the simple act of a lover, lost his government, and also his life, as he was killed in his efort to assert his authority. Lovers should not neglect their business, as they may lose all, is the lesson here taught.\n\nJohn Harvey was appointed President of Council in 1680.\n\nJohn Jenkins, appointed Governor, June, 1680, and died December, 1681.\n\nHenry Wilkinson, appointed Governor February, 1681.\n\nSeth Sothel, appointed Governor 1683. This man, Seth Sothel, was a great rascal. He was expelled as Governor of the County of Albemarle shortly after his appointment. He then went to Charleston, in South Carolina, and, in 1690, was elected Governor of that county, and was there impeached and expelled. An honest public servant is a prize to any people. No mean, insincere, selfish, and untrue man ought ever to be allowed to hold any office or place of trust.\n\nPhilip Ludwell, appointed Governor 1689.\n\nAlexander Lillington, appointed deputy Governor 1693.\n\nThomas Harvey, appointed deputy Governor 1693.\n\nFrom April, 1693, to 1712, North and South Carolina had the same governors.\n\nPhilip Ludwell, appointed 1693.\n\nThomas Smith, appointed 1693.\n\nJoseph Blake, appointed 1694.\n\nJohn Archdale, appointed 1695.\n\nJoseph Blake, appointed 1696.\n\nJames Moore, appointed 1700.\n\nNath'l Johnson, appointed 1703.\n\nEdward Tynte, appointed 1706.\n\nRobert Gibbes, appointed 1710.\n\nTARY GOVERNMENT FROM 1699 TO 1729.\n\nThey took the oath of office as follows:Henderson Walker, President of the Council, 1699.Robert Daniel, Deputy Governor, 1704.Thos.

So, to truly understand the history of Hertford, we must understand the histories of its mother counties. We want to know the men, the families, who controlled and shaped the destinies and affairs of these mother counties. Many of our ancestors occupied official positions in those counties. We speak of counties. There were only three counties in North Carolina, until 1738. The other sub-divisions of the territory were called precincts. In 1738 the precincts were dignified by the names of counties.\n\nBERTIE PRECINCT.\n\nIn 1722, Bertie Precinct was carved out of Albemarle County by the Lords Proprietors under their charters from King Charles the Second. The boundaries were as follows:\n\n\"That part of Albemarle County lying on the west side of Chowan River, being a part of Chowan Precinct. Bounded to the northward by the line dividing the government from Virginia, and to the southward by the Albemarle Sound and Moratuck River, as far up as Welsh's Creek, and then including both sides of said river and the branches thereof, and as far as the limits of the government, be, and the same is hereby declared to be erected into a precinct by the name of Bertie Precinct, in Albemarle County.\"\n\nLater, in 1729, the boundaries of Bertie Precinct were fixed as follows: The Roanoke on the south and west, the State line between Virginia and North Carolina on the north, the Chowan River and Albemarle Sound on the east.\n\nDuring the governorship of old Gabriel Johnson, some writers put it in 1741 and some in 1743, another act of the Royal General Assembly was passed, establishing out of the territory of Bertie County, the county ofNorthampton .\n\nThe representatives of Bertie County in the Colonial Assembly from the ending of the Proprietary Government in 1729 to the formation of Hertford County in December, 1759, were as follows:\n\n1731-2. Arthur Williams, James Castellow, Col. Thos. Pollock, Isaac Hill, Capt. George Wynns.\n\n1733. The same members, except William Kinchen in place of Col. Thomas Pollock.\n\n1734. Castellow, Williams, Capt. G. Wynns, John Lawson, and John Harrell.\n\n1735-6. The same as, above, except, John Hodgson and John Harrell represented one vote.\n\n1737-8. Thomas Bryant, John Dawson, John Hodgson, Benj. Hill, James Castellow and Arthur Williams.\n\n1739-40. Benj. Hill, James Castellow, Thos. Bryant, John Dawson and John Browne.\n\n1741-2. Not given.\n\nNorthampton is now formed, and Bertie given three members and Northampton two.\n\nBERTIE'S REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n1743. Benj. Hill, James Castellow, and Thos. Bryant.1744. Benj. Hill, James Castellow, and Thos. Barker.1745. Benj. Hill, James Castellow, and Thos. Barker.1746. John Wynns,-,-.\n\nHere the colonial records show that, there was a breach between Gov. Gabriel Johnson, which had been brewing for sometime, when some of the northeastern counties—Chowan, Perquimans, Tyrrell, Bertie, and others, in the east-refused to send members to the Assembly, or rather their members elect would not attend, and the Governor could not get a quorum to transact business. Gov. Gabriel Johnson was an arbitrary and unpopular ruler. His trouble with his eastern counties was that he wanted to deprive them of their proper representation. He met with the same rebellious spirit as did later King George the Third, when he and his aristocracy\n\ntried to crush the American colonies and deprive, them of proper representation. This deplorable condition continued about ten years. In 1746, John Wynns was the only member of Bertie who appeared. The Governor issued his mandates that the, members must attend the, sessions and represent the freeholders. But they defied the commands.\n\nThe next time we find Bertie and the other indignant, counties being represented in full was in 1754.\n\nBertie sends in 1754-5-6-7-8-9, John Campbell, Thomas Whitnel, and Benj. Wynns.\n\nJohn Campbell yeas Speaker of the House for two, or more years. He did not attend in 1756 on account of sickness. He lived at Coleraine, in Bertie County, and was one of the most distinguished men in the State in his day.\n\nIn 1760, after Hertford County was formed, Bertie's members were William Williams, and John Hill.\n\nThe justices of the peace, appointed for Bertie in 1739 were Benj. Hill, Esq., Needham Bryan, Wm. Cathcart, William Kinchen, Peter West, Thos. Bryan, Thos. Handsford, Rowland Williams, Thos. Whitnel, John Prat, James Castellow, John Dawson, and John Edwards.\n\nIn 1746, the list of justices of the peace of Bertie County was revised, and George Gould, Wm. Cathcart, James Castellow, Benj. Hill, John Harrell, Needham Bryant, George Lockhart, John Brown, Samuel Scally, Samuel Ormes, George Patterson, Robert Hunter, and Edward Bryan were appointed.\n\nIn May, 1759, the list was again revised, and Robert Sumner, Lillington Lockhart, Peter West, Thos. Slater, and James Moore were added to the list.\n\nThos. Barker, Needham Bryant, Thos. Whitnel, Edward Bryan, and Thos. Turner had become, citizens of Northampton County, and could not serve. John Harrell, Jr., had died, and John Harrell, Sr., Robert Hunter, Robert Summer, William Wynns, Jacob Blount, Robert Hardy, and Peter West\n\nhad been cut off into Hertford County, and were dropped from the list.\n\nBenj. Wynns, Clerk of the Court, was also cut off into Hertford, County, and his place was declared vacant. In 1754 the Clerk of the Court of Bertie County was Samuel Ormes. John Prat was Sheriff in 1739.\n\nCHOWAN COUNTY'S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE ASSEMBLY.\n\n1744-5\n\n. James Anderson, Henry Baker, and Dempsey Sumner.\n\n1746-7\n\n. Peter Payne, Joseph Blount, James Anderson, and John Benbury.\n\n1757-9\n\n. Dempsey Sumner, Joseph Blount, Timothy Walton, Joseph Heron and Edwin Vail.\n\n1754-9\n\n. Thomas Barker, for .1760. Thomas Child, Thomas Barker, Francis Corbin, Samuel Johnston, and Edwin Vail.JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.\n\n1746. John Montgomery, Esq., James Anderson, Thomas Garrett, Henry Baker, John Sumner, Dempsey Sumner, and William Hunter.\n\nCLERK OF COURT.\n\n1754. William Halsey.\n\nNORTHAMPTON COUNTY.\n\nThis county was carved out of Bertie County in 1741-3, and for about twenty years a portion of Hertford County was within her borders, hence we are interested in her political history during that period when we were nursing partly at, her breast. Northampton County's first representation in the Colonial Assembly began, so far as We can find from the record, in 1744. Her members being as follows (she was entitled to two):\n\n1744. Samuel Taylor and John Dawson.1745. John Dawson and James Washington.1746. Benj. Hill and James McDowell. 1747. John Dawson and James Washington.1748. John Dawson and James Washington.1749. John Dawson and James Washington.\n\nThe same interregnum in the legislative branch of the government was participated in by this county, as in the other counties heretofore mentioned.\n\nGov. Gabriel Johnson had made himself extremely offensive to the people in the east and their representatives. He was an arbitrary and bad man. In 1754 James Washington and Robert Jones, Jr., were the representatives.\n\n1755. James Washington and Robert Jones, Jr.1756. James Washington and Robert Jones, Jr.1757. James Washington and Robert Jones, Jr.1758. William Murfree and Robert Jones, Jr.1759. William Murfree and Robert Jones, Jr.\n\nAfter the passage of the bill creating Hertford County, the, county was represented in 1760 by James Washington and Robert Jones, Jr.\n\nThe justices of the peace in Northampton County during the twenty years next preceding the establishing of Hertford County were: William Cathcart, William Kinchen, John Dawson, Roland Williams, James Washington, James Maney, William Short, John DeBerrey, John Moore, John Drew, Nathan [Unknown], Williams, John Duke, John Gilliam, Osborn Jeffries, John Lamon, William Battle, and Arthur Harris.\n\nSHERIFFS.\n\n1741-52\n\n.

John Hooker.\n\n1748-65\n\n. John Edwards.\n\nJames Dancy.\n\nNorthampton County was, known as the Northwest Parish. But on account of its great length it was, in 1758, divided, by virtue of an act of the Colonial Assembly, into two parishes, namely, Northwest and St. George.\n\nThe following vestrymen were named for the Northwest Parish: William Murfree, James Washington, James Turner, Samuel Thomas, Joseph Sykes, Charles Skinner, William Battle, Joseph Smith, Benj. DeBerry, Robert Warren, James Maney, and John Figures.\n\nThe vestrymen of St. George were: William Cathcart, John Jones, William Allen, Harwood Jones, Thomas Barrett, William Winborne, Green Hill, John Dukes, William Pace, Thomas Winborne, and William Short.—State Rec. of N. C., vol. 23—499.\n\nThis new county included all that part of Bertie County bounded as follows: \"All that part of Bertie lying north and west, of Sandy Run and a direct line front the head of said Run to the head of Beaver Dam Swamp and Meherrin Creek and River.\" This included the Menola section of St. John's Township, the most of Murfreesboro Township, and the whole of Maney's Neck Township, now in Hertford County, in the boundaries of the new county of Northampton.\n\nHERTFORD COUNTY.\n\nOn the 12th day of December, 1758, John Campbell, a member from Bertie in the Colonial General Assembly of North Carolina, presented, a petition asking for, the erection of Hertford County from the territory of Chowan, Bertie, and Northampton. On the 18th day of December, 1759, Benj. Wynns, one of the members from Bertie, was ordered to prepare and bring in a bill pusuant to, the prayer, of the petition, which he did, and the same was presented and passed and sent to the Council. On December 19, 1759, it was endorsed and sent to the upper house, where it was first\n\nread and passed. The bill was finally passed December 29, 1759, and the county given two members in, the General Assembly. The boundary being as follows:\n\nBeginning in Bertie County at the first high land on the northwest side of Mare Branch on Chowan River Pocosin, running thence by a direct line to Thos. Outlaw's plantation, near Stony Creek, thence by a direct line to Northampton County line at the plantation whereon James Rutland formerly lived, then along Northampton County line to the head of Beaver Dam Swamp, then by a line direct to the easternmost part of Kirby Creek, thence down the creek to the Meherrin River; then up the Meherrin River to the Virginia line; then easterly along the Virginia line to Bennett's Creek; then down Bennett's Creek to Chowan River; then across the river to the mouth of the said Mare Branch; and up the branch to the beginning, and all of said territory shall be known as Hertford County, and parish of St. Barnabas.\n\nIn 1764 the line between Hertford and Northampton was changed, as follows:\n\n\"Beginning on Kirby's Creek, where the dividing line joins said creek, running thence up the creek to the fork thereof (which is in the fork of the Vaughan Mill Pond), then up Turkey Creek to Maple Fork; then by a direct south course till it intersects the present dividing line.\"\n\nDECADE I.\n\n1760-1770.\n\nHaving traced the history of the discovery of America, the settlement of Carolina, the division of Carolina into North and South Carolina, the subdivision of North Carolina into counties and precincts, then precincts into counties, and the establishment of Hertford County, which received its name in honor of Francis Seymour, Marquis of Hertford, a great friend of liberty and of the American Colonies, and who introduced in the House of Lords in 1765 a bill to repeal the infamous Stamp Act; we will now proceed to briefly notice the prominent events in the history of this little but illustrious county of Hertford, and its people who figured in shaping its destiny and perpetuating its fame. This is not to be a general history of the State, but purely a county history. The reader must read other works for general historical information. For convenience, the writer will divide his writings into Decades instead of Chapters.\n\nArthur Dobbs was made Governor of the Province of North Carolina November 1, 1754, and remained in office until October, 1764, when he was succeeded by William Tryon, October 27, 1764, and who remained in office until he was appointed Governor of New York, June 1, 1771.\n\nThe citizenship of the county was of a high type, many of its men had been educated in the schools and universities of the old countries. Its women were beautiful and attractive. Its early settlers were French, Irish, Scotch, and Scotch-Irish principally. Col. James Jones, of Hertford County, was a member of Governor Dobbs' Council and one of the leading men of the Province. He aided greatly in securing the establishment of the loyal and graceful little county of Hertford.\n\nOn May 9, 1760, an order for an election of members to represent Hertford County in the General Assembly was\n\nissued by the Clerk of the Crown. Notwithstanding the writ of election was issued in May, 1760, we find no record showing any representation from Hertford County in the General Assembly until 1762.\n\nThe list of the members elected to first represent Hertford County in the General Assembly is given on page 801, vol. 6, Col. Rec., by Col. Wm. L. Saunders, the compiler, as being Messrs. Benj. Wynns and William Murfree; but this is a mistake. The records do not show that Benj. Wynns was ever sworn in or ever took part in the deliberations of the body. Benj. Wynns was during this time Clerk of the Court. The records do show that William Murfree and Henry Winborne presented certificates of election from Hertford County, and they were sworn in and seated as the first members in the Colonial General Assembly of North Carolina from Hertford County. Col. Rec., vol. 6, pages 810 and 916. When the county was formed, Benj. Wynns lived in Winton and was one of the representatives from Bertie, and William Murfree lived near the present site of Murfreesboro, and was one of the members from Northampton. Both of these distinguished gentlemen were cut off from their respective counties and embraced in the territory of Hertford.\n\nThe laws of the Colony were enacted by an Assembly composed of freeholders, elected in the several counties. The member was required to be the owner of at least one hundred acres of land, and the voter was required to own in fee at least fifty acres of land, and the King's Council, which was referred to as the Upper House or Council. The Councilmen were appointed by the King, generally upon the recommendation of the royal governor of the Province, and the Council was presided over by the Governor, and sometimes by the Chief Justice.\n\nHertford County was represented in the Council for some years in the person of Col. James Jones. The colonial member of the Assembly or House were:\n\n1762-63. Henry Winborne, William Murfree.\n\n1764-65. Benj. Wynns, Robert Sumner.\n\n1766-68\n\n. Benj. Wynns, Matthias Brickle.\n\n1768-70\n\n. Peter Wynns, Edward Hare.\n\n1770-72\n\n. Benj. Wynns, Edward Hare.\n\n1772-74\n\n. Benj. Wynns, Sr., Benj. Wynns, Jr.1775. Wm. Murfree, George Wynns.\n\nThe Assembly was dissolved, or prorogued, at the will of the Governor. The bills, after passing the House, were sent generally by two members of the House, appointed by the Speaker, to the Upper House or Council. Bills after passing both branches, if of any political importance, were still subject to the approval or disapproval of the King, speaking through his Governor. We will speak briefly now of these representative citizens.\n\nWm. Murfree was a, former citizen of Northampton County, living in that part of Northampton where the present town of Murfreesboro is located, when Hertford County was formed. He first appeared in the Assembly from Northampton as the successor of James Washington, resigned, in 1757, and continued as a member of that body until Hertford was formed, when he became a citizen of Hertford County. Being a man of, ability and experience, his new county made no mistake in returning him to the Assembly. He married Mary Moore, of Northampton, and they were the parents of the great warrior and patriot, Col. Hardy Murfree, of Hertford County. He was the second colonial sheriff of this county, and served several years after his return from the Assembly.\n\nHenry Winborne, a substantial planter, living in the central, part of the county, was his collegue in the House. Winborne came to the county from Nansemond County, Va., in 1742, with his companion, Bryan Hare, from the same county. They bought from Daniel Hough, of Bertie, 400 acres of land on Meherrin (now Potecasi) Creek, December 8, 1742. A certified copy of the old deed is now in the possession of the author. He was the greatgrandfather of the late Maj. S. D. Winborne, of this county.\n\nThis was his first entrance in political life. He was a man with a strong, and vigorous intellect and was an active and useful member of the House. He was one of the colonial justices of the peace of the county, and served his county well as the presiding member of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, which was the chief court of the people in those days. He married Sarah Hare, a Quaker lady of Nansemond County, Va. She died about 1759, and they left, as is known, two sons, William and Thomas, and one daughter, Sarah. There may have been other children.\n\nHenry Winborne's daughter, Sara, married the first Starkey Sharp, and they had two daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth, and one son, Jacob. Sarah married Thos. E. Hare, Elizabeth married Nathan Harrell, and Jacob married a Miss Hunter of Gates County. His son William Winborne and his wife Judith were the parents of the late John Winborne, who lived below Harrellsville. His son Thomas married Sarah Copeland, aunt of James Copeland, who represented the county in the House and Senate in the seventh decade, and they were the parents of Elisha Winborne and Sarah A. Winborne. Elisha married Martha Warren, of Southampton County, Va., and they were the grandparents of the author. Sarah married John Gurley, and their descendants are now living in Mississippi. The author's book, \"The Winborne Family,\" published in 1905, gives a full history of all the old Winborne families in North Carolina. Henry had a brother by the name of Thomas, and probably others, in Northampton County.\n\nHenry Winborne was one of the first two representatives in the legislature from the new county, and his direct descendant, Robert Warren Winborne, was the first Democrat elected in the county, in 1884, to the legislature, after the days of reconstruction and the enfranchisement of the negro in 1868. Another of his direct descendants, B. B. Winborne, the author of this book, represented the chivalrous little county of Hertford in the legislature in 1895 and again in\n\n1905. The first and last stand 143 years apart on the roll. He still has younger descendants in North Carolina and Virginia, bearing his family name to do, him honor. Micajah T. Winborne of Alabama, the late Maj. S. D. Winborne of this county, Dr. Robert H. Winborne of Chowan County, Mrs. Britton Moore late of Murfreesboro, and Richard Winborne late of Tennessee, were his great-grandchildren. The old representative and chairman of the county court owned about 1,200 acres of land in the central part of the county, in and around the present town of Union.\n\nBenj. Wynns was a member of the Assembly in 1759 from Bertie, when Hertford was formed. He lived where the town of Winton is now located, and had been a member of the House of Commons from Bertie constantly since 1754, and was a man of great wealth, long experience as a public officer and legislator. He drew the bill to create Hertford County, and was also the author of the bill to incorporate the town of Winton. Before Hertford was formed Mr. Wynns, in 1754, introduced a bill to locate and incorporate a town on his land at Barfields. That failed, and ten years later, while a member from the new county of Hertford, he, in 1764, introduced a bill to establish a town on his land, where the town of Winton is located. The bill passed in 1768, and he donated 150 acres of land for the town, which was named Winton in his honor. Henry Hill, Wm. Murfree, John Baker, Matthias Brickle, Joseph Dickinson, Henry King, and Benj. Wynns were appointed commissioners in the act, to have the town laid off, the streets named, lots numbered, and a map made of the town. Fifty acres were to be set apart for town commons. Godwin Cotton surveyed and plotted the town. This was the first incorporated town in the county, and stood alone in its glory for twenty years. It soon became the centre and the Mecca of Hertford's dignitaries. Benj. Wynns owned all the land and river front from Folly Branch to Hare's mill-race, besides other large bodies of land in the county. He was the first Clerk of the\n\nMICAJAH T. WINBORNE,\n\nGreat Grandson of Henry Winborne.\n\nDied in 1843 in Mobile, Ala., of Yellow Fever, aged 23 years.\n\nCourt in the county, from 1760-1764, as appears from old deeds found among the papers of the late Maj. S. D. Winborne, and of Oris Parker, Esq., the grandson of the first Peter Parker. John A. Wynns, of Winton, was also very probably the son of Benj. Wynns, Jr.\n\nBenj. Wynns and John Wynns were men of prominence in Bertie Precinct as far back as 1735. They were deputy surveyors under the Surveyor-General of the Crown in 1844, and their depositions were taken on behalf of the Crown to prove charges of corruption against Gov. Gabriel Johnson, for violating the land-grant laws. The offices held by Benj. and John Wynns were of great importance in those days, and only worthy and efficient men were selected to fill them. Both of them were freeholders and on the jury list of Bertie in 1740. John Wynns was Deputy Clerk of the Court of that county in 1741, aged 39. Col. Rec., vol. 4, p. 1117. George Wynns, who was still older, was prominent in Bertie as far back as 1719.\n\nAt the General Court for Chowan Precinct, held at Queen Anne's Creek, (Edenton), July 28, 1719, Geo. Winns was a member of the grand jury. In 1723 he was a witness in a land suit tried in court, held at A-hot-sky (Ahoskie). April 9, 1724, Winns, was appointed a justice of the peace for Bertie Precinct. Was Clerk of the Court of his county, and in 1728 is mentioned in the Colonial Records as captain in the militia. He represented Bertie Precinct, after the Lords Proprietors surrendered their charter rights to the Crown, in the Assembly of the Province in 1731-2-3-4-5-6. John Wynns was in the Assembly from Bertie in 1746. William Wynns was a justice of the peace in Bertie six years prior to the formation of Hertford, and was also a justice in Hertford. George Wynns, Jr., was made Major in the colonial militia in 1764, and entered the Continental Army in 1777. In 1780 he was captured by the British and carried to London and heldNOTE.—Geo. Winns and wife Rose conveyed 150 acres of land on Wiccacon Creek to John Early, July 14, 1714.\n\nas a prisoner of war until the close of hostilities, when he returned to his native county of Hertford. He was a member from his county in the convention of the State in 1788, to consider the ratification of the United States constitution. The Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica has it that Gen. Thomas Wynns was the prisoner. That is a mistake. The General was never a prisoner.\n\nThe Wynnses lived in and around Winton, except George Wynns, who lived on the farm on which Dr. R. P. Thomas now resides. Benjamin, John, William and George, Jr. (who was made major in 1764), must have been sons of George Wynns, Sr. Benj. Wynns had a son of the same name, who was Public Register of the county from 1760-64, and Clerk of the Court from 1764-72, and again in 1802, and a member of the Assembly in 1773-74. We do not find John Wynns mentioned in public life after 1746. Peter Wynns was in the Assembly in 1769-70, but after this we lose trace of him.\n\nBenj. Wynns, Jr., left four sons-Benjamin, George, William, and Thomas. The latter was the youngest, and was born about 1758 or 1759, according to the notice of his death, published in the Raleigh Register in 1825. His age was given in the Register at his death as being about 66 years. BENJ. WYNNS\n\nThe Third.\n\nBenj. Wynns, III., left four sons-Benjamin IV., Thomas, James Dean, and William B. Wynns. The U. S. Census of 1790 shows that at that time John A. Wynns, Matthew Wynns, Maj. George Wynns, and Gen. Thos. Wynns, and Wm. Wynns were living in this county and were heads of families. The others had died previous to that date, except Benj. III. The Wynns families were among the oldest and most\n\nprominent in the county in those, days. The official record of the county indicates how they were regarded by their fellow citizens. The name is printed in various ways in the old colonial and Sate records. We find it spelt Winn, Wynn, and Wynns. But the old members spelt it Wynns, as shown by their signatures seen by the writer. The name is spelt in the charter of Virginia of 1609, Wynne. Capt. Thomas Wynne, Capt. Peter Wynne, and Capt. Edmond Wynne are, there mentoned in the list of granites in the charter from King Charles II. Of this illustrious family, Col. James M. Wynns, of Murfreesboro, the only surviving son of William B. Wynns, is the only survivor of the older Wynns. He and his brother, the late Thomas P. Wynns, have children living in this county and in Virginia. Col. J. M. Wynns' uncle, Benjamin, has descendants in Florida.\n\nRobert Sumner was a wealthy old bachelor, who lived and enjoyed life at St. John's, where courts in olden times were held. He dressed well, drove fine horses, drank the finest liquors, enjoyed the standard literature of the times, as well as the current news, and was fond of entertaining his friends. He had figured much in public life and was regarded as probably the strongest and ablest of his compeers in Hertford. He was the grand-old-man on all public occasions. Moses and Josiah Sumner, also, lived in that part of the county, and each served as Sheriff of the county at a later, period. He was in the first list of justices of the peace for the county, and the presiding officer at one time of the old court of the county. In the next decade the reader will learn more of this lofty old gentleman.\n\nMatthias Brickle lived at the old Daniel Valentine place, near Winton, which is sometimes called Oak Villa. He was one of Hertford's most worthy and valued citizens. He came to the county before its formation. He vied with Col. Robert Sumner for the mastery in the county. He had a liberal education as well as Sumner. He had the advantage of Sumner however, in that he was the head of a most interesting\n\nand intelligent family of sons and daughters. His father, Rev. Matthias Brickle, of Bertie, was the first resident preacher west of the Chowan River. He entered upon his mission about 1730, and preached with great power at old St. John's and at old St. Luke's chapels. The latter chapel was near the present church Buckhorn. Rev. Brickle died about 1758, and Rev. Wm. Gurley succeeded him in his grand work. His son, Col. Matthias Brickle, first married, on November 6, 1748, Rachel Noailles, of a French Huguenot family. By this marriage he reared several children: Sally, who became the wife of Col. Hardy Murfree; James Noailles Brickle, who became a notable physician and a distinguished soldier and legislator. The latter died in Tennessee and was buried by the side of his brother-in-law, Colonel Murfree. William and Matthias Brickle, Jr., were also sons of this marriage. He had several other daughters by this marriage. One of whom married Maj. John Brown, a retired British navy officer, who had located in this county near old St. John's, long prior to the war of 1776. The late James L. Anderson owned the place where Major Brown lived and died. William and Matthias both rose to prominence and distinction in the county and State. Colonel Brickle was the first High Sheriff of the county up to 1766, preceding in that office his worthy contemporary, William Murfree, who was in the office from 1766-1771. Colonel Brickle's wife, Rachel, died February 17, 1770, and some time after that he married Mrs. Nannie Jones, the widow of the second James Jones, of Pitch Landing, and reared several children from this marriage. One of his daughters by his first marriage, married Dr. Bryant Bembury, a celebrated physician, who emigrated to America in 1783, from Clonmel County, Ireland, and located in Hertford County, where his father and his family had preceded him. Dr. Bembury died in Murfreesboro, October 15, 1809, and is buried in Winton in the family burying-ground, between the court-house square and the river. Dr. John Brickle, a noted physician in Edenton,\n\na ripe scholar, a philosopher, and an historian, was uncle to Colonel Brickle. Miss Levinia Bembury Brickle, a granddaughter of Colonel Brickle, died in Murfreesboro, July 27, 1799, and was buried in Winton. Godwin Cotton, of Hertford, married Sarah Brown, the daughter of Maj. Jno. Brown, and granddaughter of Colonel Brickle. Maj. John Brown and his wife, Sarah, were also the grandparents of the late John A. Anderson, of Winton, Eliza Brown, wife of the late James M. Trader, of Murfreesboro, Mrs. Polly Everett, who lived near old St. John's, and Dr. Godwin C. Moore. Col. Matthias Brickle died October 17, 1788.\n\nCapt. Arthur Cotton, son of John Cotton of Bertie, whose will was probated in 1727, married Elizabeth Rutland, daughter of James Rutland, who built the house where the boundary lines of Hertford and Northampton corner, and they were the parents of Godwin Cotton, who married Sarah Brown. Godwin Cotton, by his marriage with Miss Brown, reared several children. Their daughter Betsey married Col. John Johnson, once prominent in Bertie, but moved to Hertford County before his death, and died at Mulberry Grove in 1807, near St. John's. They left two children—Rev. Dr. Samuel Iredell Johnson, and Sally Johnson, who afterwards married James D. Wynns, of Hertford County, and uncle to our Col. James M. Wynns. Their other daughter married James Wright Moore, and they were the parents of the late Dr. Godwin C. Moore, the late Mrs. Sallie M. Westray, of Nash County, and the late Mrs. Emeline Le Vert, wife of Dr. Henry B. Le Vert, of Mobile, Ala. It was this distinguished physician, Dr. Le Vert, and his good wife who administered to the comfort of young. Micajah T. Winborne, uncle of the writer, during his last illness in 1843, in Mobile, away from his loved ones. He was buried in their private burying ground, and a beautiful monument was erected at his grave by this noble lady and his other friends in his distant home. The goodness in our fellow-man excites admiration. It makes us love to say:\n\n\"There is so much bad in the best of us,And so much good in the worst of us,That it hardly behooves any of usTo talk about the rest of us.\"\n\nEdward Hare, one of the representatives from the county from 1768-72, lived in Maney's Neck, inhere the late J. W. Barnes resided, and belonged to the prominent Hare family of the county. He and Moses Hare lived in Chowan County in 1740, and afterwards moved to, Hertford. Jesse Hare, his brother, was one of the colonial magistrates of the county. Moses Hare lived in the county prior to the Revolution of 1776, and was the father of Jamima Hare, the second wife of Starkey Sharp, the first, (1743-1791). Since writing \"The Winborne Family,\" a further investigation enables the writer to give more information of the Hare family. It is there stated that Thos. E. Hare, son of Edward Hare, who married Henry Winborne's granddaughter, Sarah Sharp, left no children. This was a mistake. They left several sons—John, Jacob, and Starkey S. Hare. John lived in Murfreesboro and often served as an election officer. He married Elizabeth R., the daughter of Lewis Meredith, and left several children—Thomas, John, Emma, Francis, and Eliza E. Hare. Jacob married a Miss Ware, and served the county in the Senate in 1830. Starkey S. Hare first married Mary A. Askew, sister to the late John O. Askew, and after her death he married Mary E. Askew, sister to the late Dr. A. J. Askew, of Bertie. They left two sons—Starkey S. Hare, Jr., and Thomas E. Hare. The former married Susan Brown. These families emigrated to Fayette County, Tenn. The old colonial law-maker, Wm. Haywood, of Edgecombe County, N. C., married Charity Hare, of this county, daughter of Moses Hare. In 1790, Moses Hare, Sr., and Moses Hare, Jr., resided in that part of Gates County which was formerly a part of Hertford.\n\nNOTE.—Edward Hare's will dated May 16, 1772. Bryan Hare, Benj. Wynns, Jr., Isaac Pipkin. and many others, are mentioned. He was the son of Edward Hare of Chowan and wife Mary Scott.\n\nThe Colonial and State Political History of Hertford County, N.C.\n\nBY BENJ. B. WINBORNE. MURFREESBORO, N.C.\n\nAUTHOR OF \"THE WINBORNE FAMILY,\" AND \"THE HISTORICAL BRIEF OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\"\n\n\"God bless our native land!Firm may she ever standThrough storm and night;When the wild tempests rave,Ruler of wind and wave,Do thou our country saveBy thy great might!\"\n\nA.D. 1906.\n\nPRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY EDWARD & BROUGHTON.\n\nCol. William Haywood was a colonel in the War of 1776, and married Charity Hare, of Hertford County, in March, 1754. John Haywood (1755-1827), who was State Treasurer for forty years; Sherwood Haywood (1762-1829), U. S. Commissioner of Loans; Wm. H. Haywood (1770-1857), Clerk U. S. District Court, and father of the U. S. Senator, Wm. H. Haywood, Jr.; and Stephen Haywood (1772-1824), planter and State Senator, were sons of this marriage.\n\nPUBLIC LANDINGS.\n\nThe King's public landings and places of inspection of flax seed, pork, beef, rice, flour, indigo, butter, tar, pitch and turpentine, staves, headings, lumber, shingles, and other commodities, for sale or export, in the county, were, at the large \"warehouses\" on Chowan River. Vanpelt's, on Wycacon Creek, and Catharine Creek; Hill's Ferry and Murfree's Landing, on the Meherrin River; Maney's Landing, on Chowan River; Bennet's Creek Bridge; at Mt. Sion, and at Winton, on the Chowan. There were warehouses at each of the above places and an inspector appointed and kept at each place. This was kept up for many years after the War of 1776. The inspectors were appointed annually by the old County Courts up to a short time prior to the Civil War of 1861-'5.\n\nCOURT OF PLEAS AND QUARTER SESSIONS.\n\nThis Court was abolished in North Carolina by the Canby Constitution in 1868. It existed in England, it was the principal court of the people in Colonial time, and was continued by the State. It was presided over by the justices of the peace of the county. When Hertford County was established in 1759 the act provided that this court should be held by the justices of the Peace on the fourth Tuesdays of May, August, November and February of each year, at Cotton's Ferry, on Chowan River, which is now known as Barfield\n\nUnder the colonial laws, it had jurisdiction to try and determine all criminal offenses, not punishable with death, and to, try and determine all civil actions not involving the title to land, and where the amount involved did not exceed forty shillings, proclamation money, all matters pertaining to the settlement of estates, the proof of conveyances, wills and the like.\n\nJUSTICES OF THE PEACE.\n\nThe colonial justices of the peace appointed for Hertford County after its formation were: Scarbrook Wilson, Henry King, Jesse Hare, John Brown, John Baker, Henry Hill, John B Tickle, Robert Sumner, Henry Winborne, Peter West, and Robert Hardy.\n\nThey were appointed by the General Assembly for life or during good behavior, as were all justices of the peace in North Carolina prior to 1868. Whenever any important county business was to be transacted, such as levying taxes, electing county officers, and accepting their bonds, making contracts for the county, and the like, a majority of the justices were required to be present and preside. But other business could be transacted by three justices.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace has its origin in ancient times, and has always been regarded as a dignified, honorable and important position. Peace is the very end and foundation of civil society, as Blackstone writes, and the common law of England, as well as the American law, has ever had a special care and regard for the preservation of the peace of society. This officer has been found necessary, through the ages, and is to-day, an indispensable officer in the administration of justice and the: orderly enforcement of the, laws of society. It is a position of great honor and importance, and every man should feel highly honored when clothed with the dignified and important powers and authority of a justice of the peace. At common law a justice of the peace had the power, when a felony or a breach of the peace had been committed in his presence, to personally arrest the offender, or\n\ncommand, others to do so, and had the same power to prevent a breach of the peace, which was about to take place in his presence. If, however, the crime was not committed in the presence of the justice, he could not arrest or order an arrest, except by his written warrant, based upon oath or affirmation. Such is still the law wherever this office exists. The Constitution of the United States directs that \"no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\"\n\nThe justice or magistrate was the king's main reliance for the preservation of order, and in America he has been the principal officer in the administration of the laws of organized society.\n\nCONSTABLES.\n\nThe office of constable is another important office, finding its origin in the remote days of antiquity. The constable has always been the ministerial officer of the justice's court. He must act whenever commanded by the justice, when acting within his jurisdiction.\n\nIn North Carolina, prior to 1868, the counties were divided into military districts, called captain's districts, and in each district was a militia captain, and a constable, appointed by the justices of the peace of the county.\n\nIt has been impossible to ascertain the names of any of the constables during this decade. But the other county officers may be found in the \"List of Officers\" in the back part of this book.\n\nSOME INTERESTING FACTS.\n\nDuring the colonial times, the Assembly, selected a list of persons, in each county, qualified for jury service, and only freeholders were selected. In 1740 the following persons were selected for Bertie, some of whom were cut off in 1759 into Hertford, and became ancestors of many of our citizens, viz.: Thomas Jenkins, John Worrell, Benj. Hill, Daniel Dickinson, Edw. Harrell, Abner Harrell, William Hines,\n\nThomas Barfield, John Taylor, Nich. Tyner, Jr., John Brown, Samuel Harrell, Patrick Carter, Isaac Parker, Edw. Harrell, Jr., William Barfield, John Bird, Edward Bird, William Rosberry, William Jordan, William Boon, James Rutland, Sr., Peter West, Thomas Hayes, James Barfield, Benj. Wynne, Richard Barfield, Thomas Banks, John Griffin, John Beverly, Henry Jones, James Maney, Joseph Bridgers, Nathan Joyner, John Vanpelt, Daniel Vanpelt, Robert Lawrence, James Jones, Benj. Bridges, William Whitley, James Dukes, Josiah Liverman, David Legatt, John Harrell, Sr., and John Harrell, Jr. In Chowan County there were on the jury list of same date, John Vann, William Vann, Edw. Hare, Moses Hare, Henry Baker, and Michael Slaughter. The last four became citizens of Hertford County. Most of these names are familiar names in Hertford County to-day.\n\nCOLONIAL MINISTERS.\n\nRev. Matthias Brickle, Rev. Wm. Gurley, and Rev. John Alexander, of whom King George II. wrote, \"He is a curious and eccentric genious, but true to his church.\"\n\nMILITIA IN HERTFORD.\n\nIn 1766, there were in Hertford County 1,893 white men over 18 years of age, capable of bearing arms. At the general muster of the Hertford Reg. of Militia, May 28, 1772, Col. Benj. Wynns made the following report: \"Since last muster day, Lt.-Col. Henry Hill, Capt. Michael Ward, and Capt. Emelius Deming have died. Capt. Sam. Cryer has removed from the county. Commissioned officers in the regiment are: Benj. Wynns, Col.; John Baker, Maj.; James Boon, Capt.; John Harrell, Lt.; Benj.

The colonists felt that the mother country was cruel and oppressive.Governor Tryon had been a most tyrannical ruler. His previous cruelty to the Cherokee Indians won for him the appellation of the \"Great Wolf of North Carolina.\" The colonists began to entertain the same notion of him. When the English Parliament insisted upon enforcing the Stamp Act in the colonies, and refused to listen to the eloquent appeals of William Pitt (Lord Chatham) in behalf of the colonies, who were being taxed without their consent, and when it became known in North Carolina, the Assembly was in session. The excitement among the members became intense and threatening. Governor Tryon, recognizing the fury ahead, prorogued the Assembly at once. The act. was finally repealed, but the feeling between the mother country, the Governor and the colony was such that war was inevitable. The King and Parliament continued their cruelty and refused to listen to the just appeals of the colonies. They began to prepare for war. In 1773, John Harvey, Speaker of the House of Commons, laid before the House resolutions from Virginia and several other Provinces, asking that a committee be appointed to inquire into the encroachments upon the rights and liberties of the colonies by the British Government. The Assembly did so. In August, 1774, Governor Martin protested against these meetings. But the people refused to listen to tyrants, and on August 25, 1774, the first Congress of the people, independent of the King, met at New Bern, composed of delegates from most of the counties. Hertford did not send delegates to this congress. When the delegates assembled, they recognized His Majesty, George III., as the lawful King of Great Britain, and declared their true and faithful\n\nallegiance to him as their sovereign. But protested in twenty-seven resolutions adopted against their treatment by the mother country, and proclaimed that the very essence of the British constitution was that no subject should be taxed but by his own consent, freely given by himself in person or by his legal representative. The work of this convention was a profound warning to the British Government, that the American colonies, while they claimed no more rights than other Englishmen, yet those rights they intended to enjoy. The resolutions were sent to the King, who paid no attention to them. The colonies seeing that British tyranny would continue, councils of safety were at once provided for the whole Province, and for the several district. Gen. Lawrence Baker and Day Ridley, of Hertford County, were appointed on the Committee of Safety for the Edenton District. The preparations and preliminaries for a bloody and determined war at once began on both sides. For the resolutions, the reader is referred to Vol. 9, Cola Rec., pp. 1043 et seq. Edgecombe, Guilford, Surry and Wake counties, and the towns of Hillsboro, Brunswick and Campbeltan (now Fayetteville), also, failed to send delegates to this congress or convention.\n\nThe next congress or convention of delegates of the people was held at Hillsboro, August 21, 1775. sent to this convention an able and patriotic delegation, who were, Wm. Murfree, Lawrence Baker, Matthias Brickle, Day Ridley, and George Wynns. Active preparations for war were made. Maurice Moore, William Hopper, Richard Caswell, Joseph Heroes, and Robert Howe were appointed a committee to prepare an address to the inhabitants of the Province, calling upon them to unite in defence of American liberty, and take up arms and assume control of the militia. Col. Rec., Vol. 10, p. 164. On September, 1775, the following persons were appointed by this congress, officers from Hertford County: Benjamin Wynns, Colonel; Matthias Brickle, Lt.-Col.; Lawrence Baker, 1st Maj.; George Little, 2d Maj.; Hardy Murfree, Capt. During the war, Major Baker was\n\npromoted to the rank of general, and Captain Murfree promoted to the rank of major and later to colonel.\n\nThe Provincial Congress next met in the town of Halifax, on April 4, 1776. In that body Hertford Was represented by Robert Summer, Col. Matthias Brickle, Maj. Lawrence Baker, William Murfree, and Day Ridley. Col. Rec., vol. 10, p. 523. Vast preparations were made by this body for the war, and members were pledged to secrecy as to the acts and discussions in congress, under penalty of being expelled and considered an enemy to America. The officers appointed in the provincial militia by the congress of August, 1775, were re-appointed by this congress with same rank. This congress called upon the people to elect delegates to a congress to meet November 12, 1776, to prepare a Bill of Rights and a constitution for the independent and sovereign State of North Carolina.\n\nHertford County sent to this congress Maj. Lawrence Baker, William Murfree, Robert Summer, Day Ridley, and James Wright. Col. Rec., vol. 10, p. 913. A committee to draft the Bill of Rights and a constitution reported, and the same was adopted by the congress, and it is a lasting monument to the wisdom, patriotism, and ability of the patriots of North Carolina in those trying and exciting days. Col. Rec., vol. 10, p. 1006.\n\nThe war was against tyranny and for liberty, and had been raging for over a year. The first battle was fought at Lexington, Mass., April 18, 1775, which was won by the British, and they moved on to Concord. The country was wild with excitement. Americans were determined and loyal to the cause of liberty. Disloyalty was promptly crushed. The patriotic call to arms was sounded throughout the borders of the colonies, and the patriotic hosts of America responded with all the courage and determination of true lovers of libertyNOTE.—Col. Day Ridley's will dated March 9, 1777, and recorded in Edenton. He speaks of his wife and two sons, Timothy Sharp Ridley and Nathaniel Ridley. Timothy Sharp and Richard Taylor were his executors.\n\nLittle Hertford was not asleep. She furnished her quota of as brave soldiers as ever followed the flag of liberty.\n\nWho wrote the Constitution of North Carolina which was adopted by the congress of November, 1776, has been an unsettled question. On the 6th day of December, 1776, Thomas Jones, of Chowan, reported that the form of the constitution was ready. Mr. Wheeler, in his history of the State, says: \"It was believed to be the production of Thomas Jones, Thomas Burke, and Richard Caswell. But this is disputed by Hardy Murfree Banks, of the Murfree family. He sternly claims that it was written by William Murfree, one of the members from Hertford County, although he was not a member of the committee of the congress to draw a constitution. The Provincial Congress of the State assembled at Halifax in April, 1776, appointed a committee, to prepare a civil constitution, and an election was ordered to be held October 15, 1776, to elect delegates to a congress to meet November 12, 1776, at Halifax, to adopt a constitution and form of government. It was during this interval, it is claimed, that William Murfree prepared his form of a constitution. Others did the same. All of them were submitted to the congress when it met. It is claimed by this distinguished gentleman that all the forms submitted were rejected except the one drawn by William Murfree, aced that one was finally adopted by the congress.\n\nSOME OF THE HERTFORD COUNTY OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS IN\n\nTHE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE IN ADDITION TO THOSE\n\nALREADY NAMED.\n\nGodwin Cotton, aide-de-camp of Col. Howe, of Chowan; Col. Thomas Wynns, Maj. George Wynns; Maj. George Little; Capt. Abner Parry, of St. John's; Capt. Joseph Walker, of Murfreesboro; Capt. Isaac Carter; Capt. Thomas Coleman, of Maney's Neck; Capt. Thomas Brickle, of Winton; Capt. James Jones, of Pitch Landing; Capt. Samuel Jones, of St. John's; Capt. Harry Hill, of Maney's Neck; Lt. John\n\nWinborne, of Winton; Lt. John Baker, of Harrellsville; Henry Winborne, of Winton; Joseph Dickinson, of Winton; Lt. Wm. Murray, Capt. John McGlaughon, Lt. John Harrell.\n\nThere were other officers from the county. Some were killed, and others advanced in rank. Same why entered as privates were promoted. It is impossible to give the names of all of Hertford's sons, as the old records do not name the counties from which the soldiers enlisted.\n\nThe following are a few additional names, contained in one of Col. Hardy Murfree's reports: Matthias Brickle, Ens.; John Burton, Adjt.; Benj. Baker, David Boon, William Butler, Giles Carter, Caesar Chavis, John Duke, Thomas Davidson, Boble Gay, Thomas Green, James Hall, Kinchen Hollomon, Richard Johnson, Barnaby Johnson, Jesse Knight, William Knott, Thomas Lassiter, Jacob Lassiter, Dr. William Lewis, Lewis Lilly, John Morgan, Moses Manley, Michliam McKeel, Nottingham Monk, Southam Manley, Marmaduke Moore, James Morgan, Thomas Pierce, Exum Powell, James Pierce, Stephen Ray.\n\nHertford County furnished ten companies of true soldiers to the war. The county should seek to have a complete roster of her troops.\n\nThe American people were true and loyal subjects to the mother country. They loved the old land, its traditions, its history, and its families. But they could not supinely submit to the wrongs and exactions of a bigoted aristocracy. The colonies tools up arms against the old country because they were forced to do so. The American people did not belong to a servile race. They breathed the spirit of liberty and of freedom. The courage, bravery, valor, suffering, and love of freedom of the Continental soldiers have never been surpassed in the history of the world. They were the true sons of liberty. Patrick Henry, of Virginia—the immortal Patrick!—when he exclaimed just before the battle of Lexington, Mass., which was the first battle of the war, that \"the war is inevitable and let it come. The next gale that sweeps\n\nfrom the north will bring to our cars the clash of resounding arms,\" etc.-met with a hearty echo and re-echo in the hearts of the American people. These patriots looked to God for help. And while the ways of God are mysterious, yet when they attack, they are like a thunderbolt. Quoting from Ridpath: \"The love of freedom was intense, and hostility to tyranny a universal passion\" with North Carolinians. In the time of Sothel, it was said of the North Carolinians \"that they would not pay tribute even to Cæsar.\"\n\nThe soldiers in the War of 1776-1782 from Hertford made a proud record. There were Tories within our borders, as in other counties, but her true sons won laurels on the fields of battle, in the war for freedom from the British yoke of oppression.\n\nWilliam Murfree, of whom we have written, was a gentleman of great prominence and experience in governmental affairs daring the colonial days, leading up to the war, and a patriot. He, furnished to his county, his State, and to the American army, a son, who made a record that will perpetuate the fame of Hertford County until the end of historic time. This son was Col. Hardy Murfree, who entered the Continental Army as captain, afterwards promoted to the rank of major, and later to colonel, on account of the most gallant service to his country. The revolutionary history of North Carolina, yea, of America, would be incomplete without the sublime military record of this great man. He was in command of the North Carolina troops in some of the mast bloody and decisive battles of the war. He was in command of the troops in the, campaigns in Pennsylvania and New York in 1778 and 1779. After the Americans had been defeated in the first engagement at Stony Point on the Hudson, in New York, General Wayne determined to make an effort to retake it from the enemy. It looked like a hopeless task, and to attempt it would be like walking in the mouth of hell. The fort was thoroughly fortified and garrisoned, and with a full-armed force on the inside. General Wayne\n\ncalled for Col. Hardy Murfree, with his North Carolina band of patriots to make the assault. Col. Hardy Murfree agreed to lead in the forlorn hope of attacking the fort in the dark hours of the night. General Wayne was about a mile off. Major Murfree, with forty brave and undaunted North Carolinians, advanced along the deadly causeway and hillside to reach the side of the fort where the enemy were not on the lookout. Shortly before midnight, with unloaded guns and fixed bayonets, through a storm of cannon shot and musketry, the gallant band of continentals, with Murfree in the lead, without firing a gun, scaled the heights of the fort and quietly entered the fort and captured every British soldier who had not been bayonetted in the assault. General Wayne and the body of his army was about a mile off, and he received a wound in the head. Some few of Murfree's brave hand were also wounded. This was one of the most brilliant feats of arms during the whole war, and filled both armies and the two countries with wonder and admiration. Major Murfree's heroic conduct, gallantry, and soldierly daring on this occasion is referred to by General Wayne in a letter to John Jay, with great appreciation. Major Murfree and his brave and fearless soldiers were like the Saxons, of whom Sidonius, the Bishop of Clermont, wrote as follows: \"They overcome all who have the courage to oppose them. They surprise all who are so imprudent as not to be prepared for their attack. When they pursue, they inevitably overtake: when they are pursued, their escape is certain. They despise danger. Tempests, which to others are dreadful, to them are subjects of jay.\"\n\nMurfree was commissioned lieutenant-colonel, April 1, 1778. Lt. John Winborne, of Hertford County, who was under the command of Colonel Murfree and was one of the brave forty continentals, died from a wound, received in this*NOTE.—Some writers fix the number at 80. While Maj. Murfree was moving in the rear Gen. Wayne and Col. DeFleury assaulted the Fort from other directions. The British lost in the engagement 63 killed and 543 captured. The Americans lost 15 killed and 83 wounded.\n\nmiraculous feat of daring soldiers. Henry Winborne, of the same county, the oldest known North Carolina Winborne, and the great-grandfather of Maj. S. D. Winborne, and who enlisted in the Continental Army in Capt. Jos. Walker's company, May 24, 1777, was also one of the immortal forty, who was willing to throw himself in the jaws of death to save the honor of his country. He came out, with his leader, Colonel Murfree, unhurt. We imagine that we can see this strong, courageous and patriotic old private, climbing the heights of the fort, and with his bayonet-spiked rifle, weeding his way through the enemy.\n\nColonel Murfree, who lived in Murfreesboro, married, February 17, 1780, Sarah, the accomplished daughter of Col. Matthias Brickle, of Hertford County, and reared three children—one daughter, who married a Mr. Burton, and two sons, Matthias Brickle Murfree and William Hardy Murfree.\n\nMrs. Burton and her husband, and Matthias B. Murfree, moved to Tennessee, where they settled. William H. Murfree married Elizabeth M. Maney, of Murfreesboro, his native town, remained in Murfreesboro until about 1823, when he moved to Tennessee.\n\nMaj. John Brown, of St. John's, a retired British navy officer, immigrated to America same years before the war, and settled in the St. John's section in Hertford County, and married before the war another of the daughters of Col. Matthias Brickle. He was an uncompromising Tory. He was too old to enter the war, but had several sons. His son John Brown, Jr., did not share his father's sentiments, but was a loyal and patriotic continental. His father was so bitter in his opposition to his son's sympathies, that the latter went to Virginia and joined a Virginia company, and fought under the command of Gen. La Fayette. When the war was over he returned to his father's home, but the old gentleman was so unforgiving and so unreconstructed, that young John Brown left and made his home in Georgia, and is the ancestor of some of Georgia's most distinguished people.\n\nDuring the earlier days of the war, Col. Benj. Wynns, of Hertford County, the great-grandfather of our Col. James M. Wynns, was in command of the continental troops at Norfolk, Va., and there met Governor Dunmore, the former British governor of Virginia, who was in command of the British forces. In a conflict between the two armies, Colonel Wynns succeeded in driving Dunmore back in a speedy retreat. After the victorious campaign of Colonel Wynns' forces around Norfolk, he returned through the Albemarle section, which had been in a great state of excitement on account of the threatened invasion of that section by the unscrupulous Dunmore and his army, and he (Colonel Wynns) was met with great rejoicing among the people and was rewarded with the unbounded praises of the Americans along his route. Our Hertford County soldiers fought for the cause of liberty, not only on the soil of Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia, but also on the soil of South Carolina, on her own soil, and finally at Yorktown, when Cornwallis surrendered his arms.\n\nThe war ended in 1782. But the British were still mad. God was with the oppressed, and it seems that He has touched the Stars and Stripes with His holy hand.\n\nThe war between the British Government and the American colonies for liberation of the colonies from the British Crown was the most important war and produced grander results than all the previous wars of recorded time. It was the Greater Magna Charter of the world.\n\nThe Americans were taught to beware of the Englishmen. Eternal vigilance became the watchword of the American people. A strong militia was kept organized, and the best navy that the government was able to support was kept equipped, for action against the old enemy. It was during this period when the American victories were being closely guarded, that some of her younger sons were advanced in her well-organized militia and State troops, and received their military titles.\n\nWhile the war was raging, the State of North Carolina kept up the legislative branch of its government. Richard Caswell was elected Governor of the State by the convention of November, 1776, and continued in office until 1779. Hertford was represented in the Senate in 1777, 1778 and 1779 by her grand old bachelor of St. John's, Robert Summer. And in the House of Commons in 1777 by Joseph Dickinson, an Irishman, who came among us in 1740, and the father of the late eminent son of the county, Gen. Joseph F. Dickinson, and by Joseph Garrett, who lived on the north side of Chowan River, and who represented Gates County in the House in 1780. In 1778, by William Baker, a brother of Gen. Lawrence Baker, and James Maney, the second, of Maney's Neck. And in 1779 by William Wynns, a great-uncle of James M. Wynns. William Wynns lived west of Winton, at the James Jordan place, the parental home of Mrs. A. I. Parker, of Winton, and by Nathan Cotton, who also lived near Winton. These sessions of the, General Assembly were held under the new Bill of Rights and new Constitution, adopted in November, 1776. The Constitution provided for a General Assembly, to be composed of a Senate and a House of Commons. It will not be amiss to copy a few sections of this famous document.\n\n\"1. That the legislative authority shall be vested in two distinct branches, both dependent on the people, to-wit, a Senate and a House of Commons.\n\n\"2. That the Senate shall be composed of representatives, annually chosen by ballot, one from each county in the, State.\n\n\"3. That the House of Commons shall be composed of representatives annually chosen by ballot, two from each county, and one for each of the towns of Edenton, New Bern, Wilmington, Salisbury, Hillsborough, and Halifax.\"\n\nA senator was required to have usually resided in the county for at bast one year immediately preceding his election, and the owner of 300 acres of land in fee.\n\nNOTE.—William Wynns married Zilpha Blanchard January 2, 1752.\n\nA member of the House was required to have usually resided in the county for at least one year preceding his election, and have possessed 100 acres of land in fee for at least six months prior to his election.\n\nOnly freeholders, 21 years of age, owning 50 acres of land, and who had been citizens of the county for twelve months immediately preceding the day of election, were allowed to vote for a senator. All freemen, 21 years of age, who had resided in the county 12 months immediately preceding election day, and who had paid his taxes were allowed to vote for a member of the House of Commons.\n\nThe General Assembly elected the Governor and other State officers, and appointed the Justices of the Peace for the counties, who held their offices for life or during good behavior. In 1779 the county of Gates was formed out of Hertford, Chowan and Perquimans. All that part of Hertford County bounded by Bennett's Creek, the southern boundary of Virginia, and the Chowan River way made a part of Gates, and all of Chowan and Perquimans counties lying north of Catharine and Warwick Creeds was, also, placed in the new county of Gates.\n\nBy this use of the political knife, Hertford County lost some of her most valued citizens. Far the county officers during this period, see List of Officers of the county, in the back of the volume.\n\nJUSTICES OF THE PEACE.\n\nAfter North Carolina became a sovereign State the General Assembly, on December 28, 1778, appointed the following justices of the peace for Hertford County: Col. Matthias Brickle, Maj. George Little, Gen. Lawrence Baker, James Wright, William Murfree, James Boone, John Harrell John Northcott, James Riddick, Edward Hare, Josiah Sumner, and Benj. Brown, Esquires.\n\nRICHARD WINBORNE.\n\nYoungest Son of Elisha Winborne, and Grandson of Thomas Winborne,\n\nand great grandson of Henry Winborne.\n\nDied in 1862 in LaGrange, Tenn, aged 33.\n\nIn the year 1779 the county of Gates was carved out of Hertford, Chowan and Perquimans counties, taking from Hertford all that part of her territory lying north of Chowan River, and between said river, the southern boundary of Virginia, and Bennett's Creek. This took from Hertford County some of her distinguished men, such as Gen. Lawrence Baker, John B. Baker, James Garrett, and many others of her most distinguished families, and men who had given luster to her history. Thereafter William Wynns and Henry Winborne were added to the list of the justices for Hertford County. Wynns resigned in 1783, and Thomas Winborne, the son of Henry Winborne, was appointed. In 1789, Henry Winborne and his son, Thomas Winborne, were among the justices selected to hold the county courts. Henry was then in his 69th year and Thomas in his 32d year.\n\nCOURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION.\n\nIn 1774, the colonial assembly established in the Province a Court of Oyer and Terminer, to be presided over by the Chief Justice and two other justices of the Province. This court was given general jurisdiction to try all matters and to hear appeals from other courts. The terms of this court for Chowan, Perquimans, Pasquotank, Currituck, Bertie, Tyrrell, Hertford, and Martin counties, were held in Edenton on the first days of July and January of each year. Hon. John Montgomery, of Tyrrell, who was for a long while Attorney-General in the Province, was appointed Chief Justice by the King to succeed Chief Justice Wm. Smith in 1740, who had returned to England. Montgomery was succeeded as Attorney-General by Jos. Anderson, Esq., of Chowan, and as Chief Justice by Geo. Berry. The latter in 1767 was succeeded by Martin Howard. Chief Justice Maurice Moore and Richard Henderson as Associate Justice presided at the sessions of the new court. This court was superseded, in 1806, by the Superior Court, two terms of which were required\n\nto be held annually at the court-house in each county. The first term of the Superior Court ever held in Hertford County, was held in Winton in September, 1806, and presided over by Judge David Stone, of Bertie County. Prior to the establishment in 1774 of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, there was no court of general jurisdiction in the Province. The former Superior Court was abolished in 1773, on account of trouble between Governor Josiah Martin and the Assembly. The Superior Court for each county still exists in North Carolina, presided over by a district judge, and the criminal docket prosecuted on behalf of the State by a district solicitor, except that the attorney-general of the State was required to perform the duties of solicitor in the third district, in which Wake County was located, up to 1868. After that date a solicitor was required to be elected in each district. W. N. H. Smith, of Hertford County, succeeded David Outlaw, of Bertie County, as Solicitor of the district in 1847, and Smith was succeeded in 1857 by Elias C. Hines of Chowan. Hines was succeeded in 1863 by Jesse J. Yeates, of Hertford, and Yeates was succeeded in 1867 by Mills L. Eure, of Gates. The judges and solicitors, prior to 1868, were elected by the General Assembly; since that date they have been elected by the people. The Superior Court judges have always been required in North Carolina to rotate and hold the courts of a different district each spring and fall, except the period between July, 1868, and 1876. Since 1868, Hertford County has not been allowed to remain in any judicial district long enough for any of her sons to aspire to judicial honors in the district.\n\nFrom 1773 until after the Revolutionary War, there were but little court facilities for the people. The country was in a state of chaos and uncertainty, as it was during the Civil War between the States, from 1861-1866, that trials of civil matters between citizens were almost absolutely suspended, and only matters pertaining to the public welfare occupied the attention of the people.\n\nGEN. LAURENCE S. BAKER.\n\n1861-5.\n\nIn the colonial and Revolutionary times of the American colonies, Hertford County's sons ranked with the best of the land. If space would permit it would afford the author wonderful pride to write the biography of each of her great men. He has read so much about these patriots, that he feels that he lived with them and saw them in all their grandeur. But we are compelled to content ourselves with a brief notice of them.\n\nAmong that galaxy of patriots and high-born gentlemen, none stood out more prominent than Gen. Lawrence Baker, whose principal home and plantation was located in that part of Hertford County lying north of Chowan River, at Buckland, not far from the present town of Gatesville.\n\nGen. Lawrence Baker sprang from along line of noble ancestors. In 1644, Lawrence Baker came from the old country and settled in Surry County, Va. He served in the House of Burgesses from 1660-1676, and died in 1681, leaving a son, Henry, who settled in Isle of Wight County, Va., and there died in 1712, leaving also a son, Henry, who lived at Buckland, in Chowan County, N. C., but which was cut off into Hertford County when it was established in 1759. His wife was Miss Angelico Bray. At his death in 1739, his son Henry became the owner of Buckland. This Henry married Katharine Booth, of Southampton County, Va., and also lived and died, in 1770, at the old Buckland homestead, leaving surviving four sons—William, Henry, Bray, and Lawrence. Henry and Bray died young without ever marrying, so far as we can learn. William, under the old law of\n\nprimogeniture, inherited the old home, Buckland, and married Judith Norfleet, the daughter of our oldest Marmaduke Norfleet. They left children. Lawrence Baker became the owner of \"Cole's Hill\" plantation, not far from Buckland, then in Hertford County, and married Anne Jones, daughter of Capt. Albrighton Jones, of Southampton County, Va. Captain Jones came from Wales and married the daughter of Col. Charles Simmons, of England. Gen. Lawrence Baker left one son by this marriage, Dr. Simmons J. Baker, who afterwards became distinguished in this State as Senator from Martin County, and two daughters—Elizabeth and Agatha. His first wife having died, he married Maria Burgess, a daughter of Rev. Thomas Burgess, an Englishman, who lived in this country at different times, in Southampton and Nansemond Counties, Va., and in Halifax County, N. C. General Baker left by this marriage one son, Dr. John Burgess Baker, and one daughter, Martha Susanna Baker. While the General's plantation and home was at \"Cole's Hill,\" he spent much of his time around Murfree's Landing. After he was cut off into Gates County in 1779, he continued his visits to the old place of his many joys in the palmy days of his useful manhood.\n\nBuckland was first claimed by Nansemond or Upper Norfolk County, Va., but the survey of the boundary line between the Provinces of Virginia and North Carolina in 1727 threw it in Chowan Precinct, N. C. In 1759 it was in Hertford, and in 1779 it was included in the boundaries of Gates County.\n\nGeneral Baker was one of Hertford's delegates to the Hillsboro Convention of August 21,1775, and he and Day Ridley, of Hertford, were appointed on the Committee of Safety in the Edenton District. He was also one of her delegates to the Halifax Congress of April 4, 1776, and by that body appointed First Major in the Continental Army, and was again a delegate from his county in the Congress of November 12, 1776, that framed and adopted the first Bill of\n\nRights and first Constitution of the State. In all of these important patriotic bodies his wise counsel was of the greatest value. During the session of the Congress of November, 1776, he was excused from further service, that he might engage in the active duties of an officer on the battle fields. In 1778 he, with other such men, was named by the Assembly of his State as one of the Justices of the Peace of his county. The best men in these days filled these places. He much regretted being cut off from his native county. He loved the name of Hertford.\n\nAfter the war he was made General in the State Troops, which office he held for some years. The last office he filled was Clerk of the Court in Gates County, which office he was filling when he died, about 1806. During the same time Gen. Isaac Pipkin, of Gates, was Public Register. He still has a granddaughter, Mrs. Susan J. Myrick, living in Murfreesboro, and grandsons, Dr. Richard Baker, of Hickory, N. C., and Gen. Lawrence S. Baker, of Suffolk, Va., whose likeness appears above. The latter was one of the famous generals of the late Confederate States Army, and a granddaughter, Mrs. Edw. Neal, now of Washington, N. C.; all of whom are over 84 years of age and yet are active and in full possession of all of their faculties. His grandson, William J. Baker, late of Norfolk, Va., has children living in that city.\n\nDr. Simmons J. Baker resided in Martin County, N. C. He was educated in Scotland, and was an eminent physician and a wise and intelligent legislator from that county. He was in the House of Commons from Martin County in 1814 and 1815, and in the Senate in 1816, 1817 and 1818.\n\nDr. John B. Baker married Mary Wynns Gregory, and resided at his father's place in Gates County, and represented that county in the House of Commons in 1811 and in the Senate in 1818, 1820 and 1822.\n\nDECADE III.\n\n1780-1790.\n\nThe war is still raging. General Cornwallis, with his army in South Carolina, is winning victories over the Continentals, under the command of General Gates. Cruel Tarleton is murdering prisoners. The American nation is almost bankrupted; the Continental soldiers are poorly clad and fed, and they are gloomy. General Greene is put in command of the Continentals in the South, in place of General Gates. South Carolina and Georgia are in possession of the British, who are cruel and oppressive to the people. The British next invade North Carolina. The first battle occurs October 7, 1780, on King's Mountain, and Colonel Campbell, with his Continentals, wins a great victory. This encouraged the Americans. Active war then ceased for two or three months. The Continentals rested and became ready to renew the conflict. Benedict Arnold, who had been made Major-General by Congress in 1777, after the battles of \"Bemis' Heights,\" turned traitor, was court-martialed, convicted and severely reprimanded by General Washington. Afterwards he was allowed to command the American troops at West Point. He soon again traitorously arranged with Sir Henry Clinton to surrender West Point, its garrisons and stores, to the British, in consideration of 10,000 pounds and a promise of being made a Brigadier-General in the British Army. His plans were frustrated, but he made his escape on the Vulture, an English war vessel. Great Britain was not only involved in trouble with the Colonies, but was in disfavor with France, and also became involved in trouble with the Dutch government. General Greene, after the battle of King's Mountain, and after resting his men and recruiting his army, divided it into two divisions: the Western Division was placed under the command of General Morgan,\n\nwho proceeded to pursue Cornwallis and Colonel Tarleton in South Carolina, and the British met inglorious defeat in every engagement. The two armies next encountered at Guilford Court-house, and the Americans again won.\n\nCornwallis becoming disheartened, leaves for Virginia soil. The Continentals continue the pursuit and struggle until Cornwallis, on October 18, 1781, surrendered to the triumphant Continental Army. On the next day the terms of surrender were signed, and General Cornwallis led the whole British Army out of the trenches around Yorktown into an open field, \"where, in the presence of the allied ranks of France and America, 7,247 English and Hessian soldiers and 840 sailors laid down their arms, delivered their standard and became prisoners of war.\" The British still have control of South Carolina and Georgia. The King's army evacuated Savannah July 11, 1782, and Charleston December 14, 1782. Thus ended the great war for liberty.\n\nPreliminary Articles of Peace between Great Britain and the United States were executed November 30, 1782, at Paris. On September 3, 1783, a final treaty of peace was entered into at Paris between all the warring nations. In \"The Treaty of 1783\" the American States were recognized as independent sovereign States. Great Britain re-ceded Florida to Spain, and all the remaining territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes was surrendered to the United States. The boundaries of the Carolinas extended from the Atlantic to the Mississippi River. The thirteen original States covered all of this territory. This territory of land has been subdivided into States, until we now have embraced within the borders of the first thirteen States the following additional States: Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Vermont and Maine. The State of Florida was ceded to the United States by Spain in 1819.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Peace there arose the momentous questions with the victorious Americans of securing and retaining the results of their struggles, and of forming a general government between the States for their mutual protection.\n\nLiberty, like the Goddess of Justice, needs to be guarded. Eternal vigilance is to be the watchword of the God-favored Americans. The property of the Tories and traitors is to be seized to help pay the great war debt with which the country was burdened. The wisest statesmanship was needed. The old Articles of Confederation between the States were too loosely drawn in 1776 to afford the protection needed by the States. The sovereign States were willing to join in a close compact, but were jealous of the plans of some of the leaders. They had been once pinioned to the British government, and they were careful how they pledged their rights. The Congress of the United States, which was holding its sessions under the Articles of Confederation, drew up a Declaration of Rights and a Constitution for the thirteen American States, and submitted it to the States for adoption.\n\nAs before stated, this is not intended to be a general history, so the reader should refer to some general history for a more accurate detail of the movements of the country during this period.\n\nNorth Carolina called a convention to meet in Hillsborough on the 21st day of July, 1788, to consider the Bill of Rights and Constitution, drawn for the American States to adopt and ratify. This convention was composed of 288 members. Hertford County sent as her delegates Maj. George Wynns, Gen. Thomas Wynns, Rev. Lemuel Burkitt, Maj. William Little and Maj. Samuel Harrell. After an exciting session, the Convention refused to adopt the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, and adjourned, members returning home to consult their constituents.\n\nThe State in 1789 called another convention to meet in Fayetteville, on the 2d day of November, 1789, to again\n\nconsider whether North Carolina would join the Union. The delegates met. Many of the objections that existed to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, submitted in 1788, had been removed by amendments, and this Convention ratified and adopted the same, and North Carolina became a devoted member of the Union. Hertford County sent to this Convention some of her ablest statesmen—Gen. Thomas Wynns, Robert Montgomery, Esq., Col. Hardy Murfree, Henry Hill, Esq., and Henry Baker, Esq. North Carolina was next to the last of the thirteen original States to join the Union. Gov. Samuel Johnson, of Chowan County, was president of both conventions. Maj. George Wynns and were brothers, and also brothers of Benjamin Wynns, Jr., and William Wynns. Thomas was the youngest of the four brothers, and was colonel in the latter part of the War of 1776-'82. He was made general in the State troops after, the war. George was first made Major in 1764, in the Colonial militia.\n\nRev. Lemuel Burkitt was a profound and eloquent Kehukee Baptist divine, and was one of the ablest men in the Convention. He was well versed in the history of the long struggles of the Baptists and Quakers for Higher Liberty and freedom of conscience, and he pointed out the dangers that might follow by an adoption of the Bill of Rights and Constitution as then submitted. This grand old man lived near old St. John's. Some of his writings on the Old Testament are at this day referred to as among the clearest explanations of that Great Book. We are unable to give his ancestry. We find, however, in 1720 and 1721 and later, the names of John Burkitt, Sr., and John Burkitt, Jr., mentioned among the inhabitants of the Albemarle section.\n\nMaj. Samuel Harrell was on the jury list in Bertie in 1740, and had often served his county in the capacity as Clerk of the Court, and was made major in the State troops after the war, and resigned the office in 1783. The old veteran private soldier, Henry Winborne, who was one of the\n\nimmortal forty that climbed the walls of the fort at Stony Point, was appointed major to succeed Samuel Harrell. William Little was brother of Maj. George Little, of Maney's' Neck. Of this family we write in the 5th Decade. A new delegation was sent to the second Convention in 1789, except Gen. Thomas Wynn.\n\nRobert Montgomery lived near Montgomery's Mill, in this county, and was the owner of that mill. He and his wife are buried there at his old homestead. He was a lawyer of splendid ability. He was a descendant of John Montgomery, of Tyrrell County, and afterwards of Edenton. John Montgomery was Attorney-General under the King for a number of years, and succeeded William Smith as Chief Justice about 1740.\n\nCol. Hardy Murfree was the hero of Stony Point, and a great man. He had served his country gallantly in war. He served his State as Commissioner of Confiscated Property in the Edenton District for ten or more years after the war, and was holding this office when he was in the Convention. This was his first civil office. He was an able member of the Convention, and was said to be one of the handsomest men of his day, and was regarded by his State as one of its greatest soldiers, statesmen, and patriots. He was appointed also by the Legislature of 1784 as one of the commissioners to have the Albemarle Sound cleaned out to lessen the dangers of commerce. He lived on the hill in Murfreesboro, near the river. In 1790 he was the largest slave-holder in the county, and his friend, Maj. Henry Winborne, was the second (See Census of 1790). For some years they worked their slaves together in subduing the forest and cultivating the soil, and making and selling tar, pitch, turpentine, and tobacco, which were the most profitable enterprises in those primeval days of American Statehood. Colonel Murfree, who bad received grants of large bodies of land in the territory, which afterwards were embraced in the State of Tennessee, moved to that State from Murfreesboro, in Hertford\n\nCounty, in 1807, and settled on Murfree's Fork of West Harpeth River, near the town of Franklin, Tenn. His wife died five years before he left Hertford County, and he only lived about two years after reaching Tennessee. He died in 1809, and was buried in his adopted soil with great Masonic and military form and ceremony.\n\nOn this occasion Gov. Felix Gundy, of Kentucky, delivered a most eloquent oration on the life, character, and public services of this great American. The Nashville papers, in speaking of the occasion, said: \"The surrounding hills were covered with vast numbers of people, and the awful silence which pervaded such an immense crowd evinced the feelings of the spectators for the memory and virtues of the deceased. Colonel Murfree was said to be really the last survivor who commanded a regiment durin"
