        "text": "James Marvin Cluff, age 90, passed away peacefully on February 29, 2024, in Bountiful, Utah. He was born on April 23, 1933, in the Mormon mountain colony of Pacheco, Chihuahua, Mexico, to Lora Johnson and Nelson Omer Cluff. Marvin was sealed to Joy Faller in the Logan Utah Temple on July 23, 1964.\n\nAs a child, Marvin lived in Mexico until his family moved to McKelveyville and Superior, Arizona, and finally to Bloomfield, New Mexico, where Marvin was raised on his father's farm. He herded turkeys and cows at a young age. Marvin liked gardening and often shared what he grew with neighbors and friends.\n\nMarvin attended high school in Aztec, New Mexico. He went to one year of college in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and then served two years in the U.S. Army before he was called to serve in the Northern Mexico Mission for two and a half years. Marvin requested to be sent to the country of his birth so he could learn the language of his native birth. After his mission, Marvin attended 4 years at BYU majoring in languages with a minor in genealogy. He worked for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in family history for thirty-seven and a half years as a researcher, cataloger, and indexer, doing European, American, Canadian, Indian, and royal Spanish lines.\n\nMarvin loved people but had a 90% hearing loss, making conversations a challenge. He was a great tease with his grandchildren whom he loved dearly. Family was everything to Marvin.\n\nThroughout his life, Marvin was known for his service. He served three missions with his wife Joy. They served in San Antonio, Texas, for one year, then a humanitarian mission for one and a half years, and a four-year mission at the Centerville, Utah, Home Storage Center. He was a dedicated volunteer for fourteen and a half years at the Bountiful Food Pantry and helped in the kitchen and laundry areas of the Bountiful Temple for over ten years until the COVID shutdown.\n\nHis many church callings over the years included serving in the Meadows Branch presidency and as a stake missionary in the Bountiful Tenth Ward and Meadows Branch. He also served as executive secretary and later second counselor in the Tenth Ward Bishopric. He also spent years working with the Regional Handicap Mutual. Most recently, he has been a library assistant and self-designated chapel door greeter. His all-time favorite calling over the years was in the nursery playing with the kids. He served as a Scoutmaster for several years and went to Scout camp and girls camp many years when his children were in the youth programs. He even went on a fifty-mile Young Men's hike in his late sixties.\n\nMarvin is preceded in death by his father, Nelson Omer Cluff, his mother, Lora Cluff, brothers Kenneth and Nolan Cluff, his twin sister Margaret Murray, and two grandsons, John Nobriga III and Brennan Cluff.\n\nMarvin is survived by his brother Roger Cluff and sister Wanda Frandsen, as well as his wife Joy Cluff and children: Carla and Steven Chamberlin, Lorann and John Nobriga, Richard and Kimberlee Cluff, William and Carol Cluff, David and Kirsten Cluff, Julia and Barclay Tucker, and John Cluff. As well as thirty-one grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11:00 a.m. Monday, March 4, 2024, at the Bountiful 10th Ward, 1145 North 200 East, Bountiful, Utah. An evening viewing will take place from 6:00-8:00 p.m. Sunday, March 3, 2024, at Russon Mortuary, 295 N. Main Street, in Bountiful. A morning viewing will be held Monday from 9:30-10:30 a.m. at the church prior to services.\n\nServices will be streamed live on Russon Mortuary Live Facebook page and this obituary page."
