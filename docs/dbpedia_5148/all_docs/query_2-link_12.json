Kennedy's chain of command.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Branagh's life other than that he was held in high regard by his colleagues within the Raccoon Police Department for being an exemplary police officer who looked out for his friends up until the very end.[1] Branagh was also friendly with the Special Tactics and Rescue Service and was notably close to at least two other officers: Rita Phillips and Kevin Ryman.\n\nRaccoon City Destruction Incident[]\n\nIn the early hours of September 23, the t-Virus contaminated Raccoon City's drinking water leading to a dramatic rash of violent incidents over the following day and by the evening of the 24th, tens of thousands of people had transformed into zombies.[2] Lieutenant Branagh was working overtime on his routine shift due to the limited resources as the mass panic began. Branagh would still attempt to file paperwork through the worst of the outbreak, but was ultimately forced to halt all investigations in order to assist full-time in the disaster relief efforts.[3][4]\n\nWith Chief Irons locking himself into his office with the mayor's daughter and Deputy Chief Douglas having been killed the night prior, the Raccoon Police Station quickly fell into complete disorganization with very little chain-of-command and very few, yet non-sensical orders being given by Irons.[5][6] By the next morning, martial law had been imposed on the city and the Army National Guard had established a quarantine around Raccoon City. Unfortunately, many of the civilians that had sought shelter in the station to escape the initial walls of undead the night prior had begun to transform into zombies themselves.[4] This lead to heightened paranoia, confusion and violent distrust among the officers and civilians. Nevertheless, Branagh was placed in-charge of the station and its officers due to his rank and steadfast composure, he ensured an (albeit temporary) sense of order within the walls of the station.[4][7]\n\nOn September 26, the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service was deployed into the city with the goal of rescuing civilians and combating the t-Virus threat. Branagh and the remaining officers coordinated to organize a mass-scale operation, in which dozens of the remaining police officers and the entirety of the Raccoon SWAT unit would be deployed to the Johnson National Bank to directly engage the zombies, with the goal of establishing a larger perimeter and defending the streets that immediately surrounding the station, thus allowing the precinct to serve as a stronghold for further tactical operations. Unfortunately, despite the organized effort, most of officers involved were wiped out as the zombies were numerous and resilient to much of their firepower, this led some officers to flee and the line to fall.[8]\n\nAs much of the department's cache was already scattered and missing, this failed offensive meant that much of the weaponry and ammunition the officer's had been reliant on had now been lost.[7] This left the station and its remaining survivors extremely vulnerable. Soon enough, zombies began to breach both sides of the station, with numerous casualties among the refugees and officers.[9] Barricades were erected, shutters were engaged, and riot gas was deployed in a last-ditch attempt to limit the movements of zombies that had entered the station. Unfortunately, this only led to the survivors themselves being divided into small pockets and scattered without reliable communication or safely traverse, leading many to die or turn in the rooms they had hid in, with several officers being hunted by Chief Irons or killed by the newly emerging Licker colony.[5][7][10]\n\nIt's unclear if the zombified Branagh was terminated by the survivors, or if his body was left to wander the station, but in either case, he was dead by the morning of October 1st, when the police station, along with the rest of the city was annihilated by an experimental thermobaric weapon.[19]\n\nSources[]\n\nnotes"
