        "text": "As Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 15, appendix page 31\n\nBorn at Lyme in this State, February, 9th, 1787; and was educated at Yale-College, where he graduated in 1809. He studied law with Joseph Wood, Esq., of Stamford, three or four months, and afterwards with Matthew Griswold, Esq. of Lyme; was admitted to the bar in New-London county, in December, 1811; and immediately settled in the practice of law, in his native town. He was a representative from that town in the General Assembly in 1826; and in 1830 and 1831, he was a senator in that body from the 9th senatorial district. In May, 1834, he was appointed an associate judge of the superior court and of the supreme court of errors, to hold the office from and after the 30th of December, 1834, to fill the vacancy which would then occur, by Ch. J. Daggett’s going out of office and the succession of Judge Williams to his place.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 35, pages 597 - 599\n\nHENRY MATSON WAITE, late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, was born at Lyme in this state, on the 9th day of February, 1787, and died at that place on the 14th day of December, 1869.\n\nOn his father's side he was descended from an old and highly respectable family, originally English. An ancestor moved from Sudbury, Mass., to Lyme about the commencement of the eighteenth century. Among the descendants of this ancestor who have been distinguished in this state may be mentioned Marvin Wait, a prominent lawyer of New London in his day, and John Turner Wait, his son, now one of the foremost lawyers of Eastern Connecticut. His mother was a Matson, of an equally honorable race. She was a sister of Gov. Buckingham's mother, who was in many respects a remarkable woman.\n\nJudge Waite prepared for college at Bacon Academy, Colchester, then the most flourishing institution of the kind in the state, and had for his schoolmates the late Gov. Ellsworth, his brother Henry L. Ellsworth, Henry R. Storrs, and others who have since been men of mark in the country. In 1806 he entered the Sophomore class in Yale College, and was graduated in 1809 with high honors. Soon after this he taught school for a short time in Fairfield county, and began the study of the law with Joseph Wood, Esq., of Stamford. For about a year he was assistant preceptor of Bacon Academy, and then recommenced his legal studies with the Hon. Matthew Griswold at Lyme, occasionally reciting to and receiving instruction from Gov. Roger Griswold, one of the ablest men whom the state has ever produced.\n\nAfter being admitted to the practice in New London county in 1812, Judge Waite opened an office for a short time at Middletown, and then returned and devoted himself to his profession in his native town. In January, 1816, he married Maria Selden, a daughter of Col. Richard Selden of Lyme, and granddaughter of Col. Samuel Selden, a distinguished officer of the Revolution. This family has given many eminent men to the country, among whom the most conspicuous at the present day are Judges Samuel Lee Selden and Henry R. Selden of the state of New York.\n\nIn the years 1815 and 1826 Judge Waite represented the town of Lyme in the General Assembly, and in 1830 and 1831 he was a member of the Senate for the 9th district. In both bodies his good sense, his rectitude of purpose, and conceded ability gave him, even when in a minority, a full share of personal influence. In politics he belonged to the old Federal party, and when that had ceased to exist, and had become with many a theme of derision, he adhered to its principles and defended its character.\n\nIn consequence of the pecuniary embarrassments and changes in the condition of property which followed the war of 1812, there was a large amount of litigation, and he went immediately into a full and profitable practice. This, his character for integrity, industry, promptness, and sagacity, and especially his prestige of success, enabled him to retain and increase during the whole of his professional career. It was his habit to be thoroughly prepared in season both on questions of law and fact, so as to be able to seize the earliest moment to press his cases to trial, and he thereby avoided, as far as lay in his power, \"the law's delay,\" which has tended so much to sully the fame of an honest and honorable profession, and to bring reproach upon the administration of justice.\n\nHe never affected what is usually understood as the art of oratory, depending mainly upon voice, gesticulation, posture, and expression of countenance--what the great Athenian pleader denominated \"action.\" But his judgment in selecting the prominent points of a case and skill in applying the evidence, his perspicuity of language, and earnestness of manner, and perhaps as much as any one quality, his subtle knowledge of character, rendered him a successful advocate with the jury.\n\nIt was, however, rather in questions of law that his strength especially lay; and his legal erudition, patient research, power of discrimination and terseness of argument, were fully appreciated by an able and learned court.\n\nOn the retirement of Judge Daggett in 1834, Judge Waite was elected a Judge of the Superior and Supreme Courts. In 1854 he was advanced to the position of Chief Justice, and this high office he held until the 9th of February 1857, when he arrived at the age of seventy, the constitutional limit of his official term. During this period of more than twenty-two years be enjoyed the perfect confidence, respect and esteem of the bar and of the entire community. To the younger members of the bar he was particularly kind, and many who now occupy the front rank in the profession remember gratefully the aid and encouragement which they received from him in their earlier efforts.\n\nHe was careful in forming and modest in expressing his legal opinions, but was firm even to boldness in adhering to them when he conscientiously believed them to be right. Hence it will he observed in examining the reports that he was not unfrequently in a minority, and sometimes stood alone among his brethren; yet it is safe to say that not very often have his decisions been reversed by the ultimate judgment of the bar. In the language of another, \"he contributed his full share to the character of a court whose decisions are quoted and opinions respected in all the courts of the United States and the highest courts of England.\" The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by Yale College in 1855.\n\nSoon after Judge Waite left the bench he became subject to a painful malady from which he suffered greatly, but with entire patience and cheerfulness, with an unclouded mind and an undiminished fondness for intellectual and social enjoyment to the close of his life. Mrs. Waite, who was in every respect worthy of him, and contributed much to his success and incalculably to his happiness, died a short time subsequently to the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage. This occasion had been celebrated with great satisfaction by a large circle of relatives and friends.\n\nTwo of their sons, Morrison R. Waite and Richard Waite, are now eminent lawyers in the state of Ohio.\n\nIn his official stations Judge Waite was able, upright, and impartial; in private life he was just and true, pure in his morals, exemplary in his habits, and faithful in the discharge of all his duties.\n\n*Prepared, at the request of the Reporter, by Hon C. J. McCurdy, Ex-Judge of the Supreme Court.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 10, page iii\n\nAppointed Associate Judge, in May 1834, to hold the office from and after the 30th of December 1834.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 23, page iii\n\nAppointed Chief Justice in May, 1854, to hold the office when vacated by Judge Church.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 25, page iii\n\nJudge Waite's term of office expired by constitutional limitation on the 9th day of February, 1857.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 48, pages 602 - 610\n\nLOREN PINCKNEY WALDO died September 8th, 1881, at Hartford, where he had long resided, in the eightieth year of his age. He was born in Canterbury in this state February 2d, 1802. Of French descent in the paternal line and (as his name indicates) of Waldensian blood, he inherited the energy and resolution, the love of civil and religious freedom, and the inflexible honesty which characterized him. His school education was completed when he was fourteen years of age. From that age to twenty-one he taught school every winter, devoting the rest of the time to labor on the farm in support of his father's family, the poor health of his father making it necessary that he and his brother should assume the entire family support. He however devoted all his leisure-time to study, and during this period mastered the higher branches of mathematics and then taught, and acquired a good knowledge of the Latin language. He also thoroughly studied Hedge's Logic in the fields, in the brief intervals of labor, and for two years before he became of age read law during the winter evenings.\n\nAt twenty-one he left home with nothing but the clothes he wore and entered the law-office of his uncle John Parish, in the town of Tolland, pursuing his studies and at the same time earning his living till he was admitted to the bar at Tolland County in September, 1825, at the age of twenty-three.\n\nOn the 22d of November of the same year he married Frances Elizabeth Eldridge of Tolland, and soon after removed to Somers in the same county and began the business of his profession.\n\nFew men have commenced life under greater disadvantages, few have encountered such obstacles with equal courage and persistence, or have been more successful in surmounting them. His brave struggles for an education and his well-known integrity recommended him to public confidence and respect, and he soon obtained a good degree of prosperity in his business. In all his labors and trials at that time and throughout life he was sustained and cheered by his wife, a noble woman, whom he survived not many years.\n\nHe was postmaster in Somers for two years, and also one of the superintendents of public schools. For a considerable time he taught a private class of young men who were qualifying themselves for teaching. His interest in the cause of education was great and continued through life. He was also a zealous advocate of the cause of temperance, and practiced throughout life total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors.\n\nIn 1830 he removed to Tolland, where he resided until 1863. During this time he represented that town in the General Assembly in the years 1832, 1833, 1834, 1839, 1847, and 1848. He was State's Attorney from 1837 until 1849, and was Judge of Probate for the district of Tolland for the years 1842 and 1843. In 1847 he was chosen by the legislature one of a committee of three for the revision of the statutes of the state, since known as the revision of 1849. He was also afterwards appointed one of the committee which made the revision of 1866.\n\nIn 1849 Mr. Waldo was elected by the democratic party, to which he belonged through life, to represent the first district, comprising the counties of Hartford and Tolland, in the thirty-first Congress of the United States. He was distinguished in Congress as elsewhere for his untiring industry, and won universal respect and confidence by his faithfulness and integrity. At the expiration of his term he was appointed Commissioner of the School Fund for this state. During the administration of President Pierce he was appointed Commissioner of Pensions, in which service he continued until elected a judge of the Superior Court for a term of eight years. At the expiration of this term, having with Judge (afterwards Chief Justice) Seymour failed of a re-election on political grounds in circumstances which are explained in the obituary sketch of Judge Seymour next preceding, he removed to the City of Hartford, where he pursued his profession until his death, in partnership with Ex-Governor Hubbard and Alvin P. Hyde, his son-in-law.\n\nJudge Waldo was a man of religious convictions and life. In early life he joined the Congregational Church of Canterbury, and during his residence in Hartford was a constant and devout attendant upon and communicant in the South Congregational Church in that city, although he had come to reject some of the tenets of the Calvinist creed and to hold the theological views of the conservative Unitarians. His unsectarian and Christian spirit made him not only a sympathetic attendant upon the public worship there, but a cordial participant in the Christian activities of the church.\n\nThe love of music was very strong in Judge Waldo throughout his life. In his earlier years he was a fine singer and to the last his deep bass voice was heard in the congregational hymns in public worship.\n\nAt a meeting of the Hartford Bar, called upon the occasion of Judge Waldo's death, the following admirable sketch of his character and tribute to his memory was given by Ex-Governor Hubbard.\n\nGOVERNOR HUBBARD'S ADDRESS.\n\nI have long had--I hope I may never cease to have--some of my choicest personal friends amongst my brethren at the bar. And so, as one after another has fallen from our ranks, I have occasionally, as a kind of pious duty, attempted a word or two of tribute. But to-day I hesitate. I have just come from chambers which lack a familiar presence, and where stands in its mute eloquence a vacant desk. If I were to consult my own feelings I, too, should remain mute. But when the whole bar is met to utter its common grief for one who has been to us all friend, father and brother in one, how can I, who have known him so long and loved him so well, refuse to break silence with a few broken words?\n\nI have known Judge Waldo ever since my admission to the bar. For the last fourteen years I have been connected with him in business, and during all those years have been not only in daily but in intimate relations with him. Let me, then, measuring my words by my knowledge of the man, attempt a passing estimate of his professional and personal character.\n\nHe was not a man of large general knowledge nor of very extensive literary culture. I have heard him say that he never attended school after he was fourteen years old, and only two months after he was thirteen, and that he studied Hedge's Logic while at work in the potato field. But he had a marvelous genius of industry, and by force of this he came up out of the common school into the profession, and through the profession into distinguished stations in the state and general government.\n\nNeither was he a brilliant lawyer. In a strict sense I hesitate to call him an eminently learned one. But his acquirements were very ample in all the common learning of the profession; and in particular branches, such as municipal, statutory, probate and practice law, and especially in the great field of elementary law which governs the common affairs of common life, he had few superiors. His opinions on these subjects had an almost judicial authority with the community; and so it resulted that not a few of the differences between man and man which in bad hands itch and fester into law suits, sometimes into hereditary enmities, were composed almost at the outbreak by his sagacious counsels and friendly mediations.\n\nHe lacked somewhat the qualities which give reputation to an advocate; that one-sidedness, or rather many-sidedness of intellect which lights up one side of a cause and casts the other in shadow, as the sun kindles in turn one hemisphere and darkens the other; that light artillery of wit, satire, invective and technical assault which always worries and sometimes wastes an antagonist; that deadly insight--Rufus Choate once called it an \"instinct for the carotid\"-- which discovers as it were by intuition an adversary's weak point and drives through it by strategy, surprise or main force. Some natures there are that seem strongest in repose; others that like an athlete need the point of an enemy's weapon to sting them into strength. His nature was not at all of this make and temper. Quite the contrary. The whole drift of his mind and the whole moral constitution of the man tended to the things which make for peace. He had little taste, therefore, for the hot and heady contentions of the forum, little stomach for its duels of wits and stormy antagonisms.\n\nAs a natural consequence his field of practice was more largely that of a counsellor than an advocate. This office is seemingly more humble than the other, but not, let me add, one whit less responsible, and I have sometimes thought, of higher grade and value, for it accomplishes some of the best professional results by reason and without the expense of bad blood and litigation. And then, besides all and above all, it comes home closer than any other to the conscience of a client, and, if well exercised, tries his reins and discovers whereof he is made. It is not unfrequently the great and solemn confessional of the law which carries with sealed lips the cares, and fears and perplexities of men, the peace and honor of families, the successions of children and of children's children, the casuistries and restitutions of the living and the anxieties and testaments of the dying. With what religious fidelity and good conscience our friend discharged this almost priestly function I have no need to tell; the name and fame of it are still fresh amongst us. More than any other man I have ever known in the profession--as much as any I have known even in the sacred calling--he was a peacemaker amongst men, a pacificator of their strifes and quarrels.\n\nIn a word, his practice represented not so much the battles and sieges of professional warfare as its truces, diplomacies and treaties of peace.\n\nI have spoken of our friend as a counsellor. Let me now say a word of him as a judge. Without possessing great boldness of purpose or the highest range of intellect, he had--what else his mind might possibly have lacked--a most admirable poise for the judicial office and a very delicate appreciation of natural equities. He took pleasure in determining the controversies of man by the standard of the judicial conscience. He delighted less in the cast-iron forms and rules of law than in the flexible modes and \"uncovenanted mercies\" of chancery. Accordingly he used to stretch the administration of law as near as might be--a legal doctrinaire might say perhaps too near--to the lines of equity, and the lines of equity as near as possible to the lines of good conscience.\n\nNo judge was ever more patient and painstaking in investigation, more steady in temper, more courteous in bearing, more dispassionate in judgment, in a word, more clear and conscientious in his great function as a minister of justice. When he put on his office he put off affection and favor, as if always mindful that the measures we mete to others are to be meted to us in turn. We have had abler judges on our bench, without doubt, but never one I think more hard-working, faithful and useful.\n\nI have already said that our deceased brother was greater as a counsellor and judge than as an advocate; let me now add that as a man he was greater than either, and equal, I think, to the best.\n\nWithout anything whatever of pretension, his life was a pattern of all those things which are honest and of good report amongst men. His industry was incessant; rest with him was rust; and he husbanded every day and hour of his life as if lent him on a usury for good. His chief purpose was not to gain riches or applause, but to walk justly in all things. Such qualities as these sometimes engender something of censoriousness in judgment, something of austerity in morals, but none of these things tended in the least to narrow the breadth of his social life or freeze up any of its warm currents. On the other hand, he was full of the gentlest humanities, singularly free from evil-speaking, and as large and tender almost as a woman in his love and sympathies.\n\nFrugal and temperate in his habits, afflicted with neither poverty nor wealth, his manhood was passed in the practice of all those virtues which conduce so largely to the health both of body and mind; and he ripened at last into an old age that was almost youthful. If gray hairs be, as is so often said, a crown of glory, the crown is not seldom set with thorns; for with old age there come in the order of nature I know not what infirmities of temper, what physical dishonors like as it were a moth fretting a garment, what darkenings of the sun and the moon and the stars, what vain struggles by spent swimmers against the swift current, what enforced marches with reverted eyes and sealed orders into the land of shadows.\n\nNothing of all this in the declining years of our friend. The day was far spent and the night at hand, yet he was as trustful and even-tempered as a child. Nothing barren or wintry in this old age of his--I speak that which I have myself seen--but everything ripe and genial; as when a mellow autumn sets in upon the toil and scorch and sweat of summer, and, though verdure and flower and the voice of the bird are gone, yet the song of labor is on the hillsides, and the harvests gather themselves into garners, and the wasting of foliage flushes into purple, and the sloping sun yellows into gold. All this perhaps I have little need to relate, for you have seen it all under your own eyes; only I may add that with this disappearing old man disappears a life which would be thought as gentle as old George Herbert's, if as gentle a pen as good old Isaac Walton's could be found to sketch it. You may easily find greater men, but where a better, a more white-souled one?\n\nI have thus given you my idea, founded on much observation, of the character of our deceased brother. `Tis a friendly portrait, I will not deny--I would not have it otherwise--but true, I hope, to modesty of nature.\n\nI cannot close without calling to mind in a common memory those other patriarchs of our profession, the fellows of the deceased in age and rank--the roll of them I will not call--who have passed away since yesterday, as it were, leaving behind them--am I not right, or does affection mislead my judgment?--no successors of equal rank and stature. The last of that great patriarchate is gone. The roll closes.\n\n\"Abiit ad pluras.\"\n\nAnd now as I look over our broken ranks, and my eyes miss this white-haired and venerable leader, this loved and fatherly presence gone hence where go the judges and counsellors of the earth till the heavens be no more, may I not here and now, before our ranks close again and we move on and leave our dead comrade behind--some short marches only behind--may I not here and now, in the presence of this brotherhood which knew him best and loved him most, borrow for my last words that golden benediction of our Supreme Counsellor and Judge--Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.\n\nThe following extract from the sermon delivered at Judge Waldo's funeral by his pastor, Rev. Dr. Parker, gives a most felicitous sketch of his character, especially in its moral and religious aspects.\n\nFROM THE SERMON OF REV. DR. PARKER.\n\nSeventeen years ago Judge Waldo came from his family into this parish and entered into communion with us in this congregation and society. He has been with us until now, in all simplicity, sincerity, integrity, serviceableness, and honor. During that time no one has manifested a truer, livelier interest in the welfare and prosperity of this religious society, no one has been more personally identified with its various services and activities.\n\nTill within a recent period his venerable figure was regularly seen in the Sunday-school, and up to the time of his last sickness he was a regular attendant upon all the public services of worship. How much he loved, prized and enjoyed the services of this sanctuary can hardly be told, the reason being, I suppose, that he put so much interest into them.\n\nSpeaking now as pastor of this congregation, I testify of his great and signal services to us, of our great and grievous loss in his death, of our universal esteem, respect, reverence, and affection for him. His was the towering form and commanding figure in this congregation even to the last. His counsels were as freely given as they were wise and prudent. Even in his old age he was a tower of strength to pastor and people.\n\nOf my own personal indebtedness to him, friendship and affection for him, I cannot trust myself to speak. So had he dwelt with us here, going in and out before us in all humility, uprightness, purity, peaceableness, and godliness. And as in this congregation, so in this community, and so in the face of all with whom, anywhere, he has held relations, social or professional. There is but one testimony. It is multitudinous, but absolutely in unison. He was good all through--thoroughly good. For faithfulness, truthfulness and integrity, and for purity of life, the name of Judge Waldo is a synonym. But goodness means more than any combination of these qualities. Goodness is that supreme spirit which organizes all such separate virtues into a lovely, kindly, beautiful unity of character. This goodness was his pre-eminently. And it shone out more conspicuously, perhaps by reason of the fact that Judge Waldo was a particularly plain and simple-minded man--of transparent nature. What was in him shone out clearly, in word and deed.\n\nMoreover he was what we may venture to describe as an old-fashioned man in many of his manners and habits. This he was by Puritan birth and training, by early conditions of life, by temperament and education. So that his goodness was manifested in certain quaint forms that were all the more delightful, as suggesting and perpetuating a type of manners, stately, yet benignant, dignified, yet simple, which was more prevalent among our fathers, in the grand old homespun age of New England which Dr. Bushnell has described.\n\nIf one stands in the nave of the cathedral of Cologne, he sees on one side two splendid windows of modern design, and opposite, two windows of older device. Both are beautiful, as the same light streams through them, but to most the older windows, by reason of their ancient and quaint patterns, are the more attractive and pleasing. And somewhat so we may compare the old men like Judge Waldo, in whom ancestral manners and habits have been preserved, with others who have grown up in new conditions of life when the same light and glory irradiate them.\n\nIt has often been my privilege and pleasure to hear Judge Waldo talk, in a free way, of the conditions, pursuits and struggles of his early life. He unconsciously showed in such conversations when and how the foundations of his success in life were laid. Quitting the school at the age of fourteen to help out the meager support for the family, taking upon him the burdens that belong to mature life, with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, studying by fire-light of evenings, and in the intervals of hard field-labor, teaching school from district to district in winters, and boarding from house to house, teaching private classes, studying law at evening after work-days, borrowing money to purchase law books, and so struggling and fighting his way--he came at last to the point of marrying the noble woman who was his help-meet almost through life, and starting in his profession with nothing Such was his heritage and discipline in youth--worth more to him probably than a princely fortune would have been. It was a charming story to hear from the old man's lips, as he told it with kindling eye and kindling spirit. That courage, perseverance, fidelity, integrity, and diligence were sustained throughout life, giving him success in business, the unbounded confidence and honor of men, and above all a character that no storms could shake. \"The child was father of the man.\"\n\nOf Judge Waldo's religious character I forbear to speak much. I should be ashamed to defend it. I should insult this congregation and this company of lawyers, and this community, and his memory, by stooping to suggest that notwithstanding some doctrinal variations from orthodoxy he was a Christian man.\n\nThe orthodoxy or unorthodoxy has nothing to do with it. Such characters as his demonstrate this. Would to God, gentlemen, that you and I and all who hear me this day, and all Christian men and ministers, were as good Christians as he was. His notions and opinions, never obtruded, and always held with equal modesty and firmness, were his own. His spirit was that which all good men and women have in common, from the time of righteous Abel until now: the spirit which pervades and unites the blessed company of all faithful people. But enough. It seems but a little while since we brought hither the body of his beloved wife. Her, too, we all knew and loved. That kindly face, those gentle eyes full of the pleasant light of a most lovely spirit, some of us will never forget. A mother in Israel!\n\nAnd now his body awaits burial. Can we ever forget that tall frame, that white head, and rugged but often radiant face, that honest voice, that benignant aspect, that kindly courteousness of the gracious gentleman, that patriarchal simplicity of life? \"The memory of the just is blessed.\" \"The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.\"\n\nFarewell! oh friend and father, well-beloved! Farewell.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 103, pages 766 - 771\n\nTHOMAS MACDONALD WALLER died at his home in New London on January 25th, 1924. His death brought to a close one of the most brilliant and picturesque careers in the history of the State. He was born in the City of New York in 1840, the eldest son of Thomas Christopher and Mary MacDonald Armstrong. He was of Irish ancestry on both sides. By his parents, he was placed in school at an early age. When only eight years old, by the death of his father, mother and only brother, he was left an orphan and thrown at that tender age upon the world, practically unguarded upon the streets of a great city and dependent upon his own resources. The only relative known to him at the time was an aunt and she, by reason of her circumstances, could do little for his assistance.\n\nUndaunted at the prospect and with the self-reliance and courage which never failed him throughout all the vicissitudesof a long and eventful life, he began the battle for existence as a newsboy on the streets of New York, his only capital a few newspapers furnished him by the generosity of a stranger.\n\nHis struggles as a newsboy were similar to those of many other poor boys following the same humble calling. He continued in this occupation during the months of one summer. The independence of mind and sound common sense which in later years characterized the man, appeared even at that early age. The newspapers which he then sold were the Sun, Tribune and Morning Star, and these papers, at that time, were filled with glowing and oftentimes exaggerated accounts of the recent discovery of gold in California. The boy was not even then swayed from his balance by the accounts which he read. In a speech delivered many years afterward at Brooklyn, he thus described his feelings at that period of his life: “I was a very small boy way back in ’49 when gold was discovered in California; but I remember that the papers I was then selling on the streets of New York were so filled with accounts of the discovery of mountains of gold, that I thought gold would not be ‘worth a cent’; and, with this apprehension, instead of going with the Star of Empire westward, I went to Connecticut.”\n\nSelling his papers in Fulton Market, he met Captain Haven, the owner of a fishing smack, and shipped with him as a cabin boy, and a little later arrived at New London on that vessel. While wandering about New London, he made the acquaintance of Robert K. Waller, who kept a grocery store on the corner of Truman and Blinman Streets. Like all grocery stores of that day, Mr. Waller sold fruit and candy. The boy was fond of candy and frequently went to Mr. Waller’s store to buy it. A mutual liking developed and eventually the boy was adopted by the kindly merchant and was given his family name; and from that time on, he bore the name of Thomas MacDonald Waller, and New London was ever after his home.\n\nBy his adopted parent, young Waller was sent to the public schools of New London. At the age of seventeen, he graduated from the Bartlett High School, being awarded first prize in oratory. After graduating from high school, he studied law in the office of the late Andrew C. Lippitt, and in due course was admitted to practice in the courts of Connecticut. In his profession, his success was unusually rapid. He quickly gained a reputation as a successful advocate and acquired a lucrative practice.\n\nA Democrat in politics but a loyal supporter of the Union, at the opening of the Civil War he responded to President Lincoln’s first call for volunteers in April, 1861, and enlisted in the Second Connecticut Regiment for a three months’ campaign and, with his comrades, went to the defense of Washington after the first battle of Bull Run. Because of a painful disease of the eyes, from which he suffered more or less during life, he was unable to continue in the army. He did, however, everything in his power by public speeches and otherwise to recruit soldiers and uphold the cause of a united country.\n\nMr. Waller was elected a member of the Legislature in 1867 and again in 1868; and we find him as a member of the Legislature at the age of twenty-eight taking a prominent part in promoting a great public improvement, the bridging of the Connecticut River.\n\nIn 1870 Mr. Waller was elected Secretary of State; two years later he was elected mayor of New London and at the expiration of his term of office, was reelected, serving the city nearly six years. In the centennial year of 1876, he was elected speaker of the House of Representatives. At the close of the legislative session, the judges of the Superior Court appointed him State’s Attorney for New London County. The appointment of Mr. Waller by the judges to be State’s Attorney signified that at the age of thirty-six, he had attained the highest rank in his profession; and, at that time, the bar of New London County had no occasion to apologize for the quality or character of its membership. Among the contemporaries of Mr. Waller at that bar, were such men as Jeremiah Halsey, Augustus Brandegee, John M. Thayer, Solomon Lucas, John T. Waite, and Lafayette S. Foster, lawyers whose professional attainments would have distinguished them anywhere and would have been an honor to any bar.\n\nMr. Waller held the office of State’s Attorney for New London County by reappointment until 1882, when he was elected Governor of the State. While State’s Attorney, he had occasion to conduct the trial of a number of criminal cases which attracted wide attention at the time, the evidence and arguments of which were published daily in many of the large metropolitan journals. Among the cases which attracted particular attention was the trial of Kate Cobb, indicted and tried at Norwich for the poisoning of her husband; and the trial of Herbert Hayden, a Methodist Minister, for the murder of one of his parishioners. The latter trial was conducted by Mr. Waller at New Haven by designation of the judges because of the disqualification of the State’s Attorney for New Haven County to try the cause, by reason of a previous professional connection with the accused.\n\nThe administration of the affairs of the State by Mr. Waller as Governor was recognized by men of all parties as dignified and conservative. The contemporaneous criticism of the press of the State shows that his messages, public speeches and other State papers, which are a matter of record, were accorded unstinted and general commendation. The delegates of the State Convention which first nominated him for Governor, were quite evenly divided in their preference between him and other candidates, but at the close of his two year term, his party convention re-nominated him without a division and with enthusiastic acclamation. He received in his second canvass for the distinguished office a plurality of the votes of the people and a larger number of votes than Grover Cleveland, who was the candidate for President at the same election and who carried the State. Governor Waller failed, however, to obtain a majority over all and as the General Assembly at the time was Republican, the candidate of that party, Hon. Henry B. Harrison, notwithstanding the popular choice, was chosen by the Legislature Governor of the State. President Cleveland offered Governor Waller the appointment as Consul General of the United States at London, the most lucrative office, it was said at the time, within the patronage of the Federal Government. Mr. Waller’s administration of the office was not only most popular among the people with whom he came in contact, both in business and socially, but, in addition, the Department of State expressed to him its official satisfaction on more than one occasion in the most complimentary terms. At the expiration of his term of office at London, Mr. Waller returned to this country and engaged in his profession as a member of the firm of Waller, Cook and Wagner in New York City.\n\nMr. Waller was nominated by Governor Morgan G. Buckley as a commissioner for Connecticut to the World’s Columbian Exposition held at Chicago in 1893 and was appointed to the position by President Harrison and elected by the National Commission its vice-president.\n\nWhen, in 1896, the Democratic party took a position upon the currency question, which appeared to Mr. Waller to be unsound and to imperil the financial prosperity of the whole country, he did not hesitate, although a life-long Democrat and the recipient of signal and extraordinary honors from that party, to prefer the welfare of the whole country rather than party allegiance, and to come out squarely and without equivocation in favor of sound money based upon the single gold standard and against the policy of free and unlimited coinage of silver favored by his party. He supported Palmer and Buckner as against Mr. Bryan, the regular nominee of the majority of the Democratic party, and in that campaign by public speeches and every means within his power, Mr. Waller did all that he could to prevent the country from embarking upon what he regarded as the dangerous experiment of an inflated and fictitious currency.\n\nMr. Waller’s fellow citizens of New London, in appreciation of his political courage and admiration of his independence of mind, nominated and elected him, in 1902, as a Democrat, a member of the Constitutional convention of that year. The convention chose him one of its vice-presidents.\n\nMr. Waller was a born orator. He was perhaps best known to the public because of that gift. He had a marvelous ability to extemporize and was endowed with native Irish wit in its happiest form, the kind of wit which convulses with laughter but leaves no sting. He was heard at his best in the actual trial of cases and in public speeches when called upon unexpectedly and before a hostile audience.\n\nMr. Waller’s brilliance as an orator perhaps obscured in the minds of many his pre-eminent legal ability. As a matter of fact, he was first of all a lawyer, and devoted to his profession. Long after he ceased active practice, he read with interest legal publications and the decisions of courts and followed with eagerness the discussion of legal problems. During his active years at the bar, a law school education was not as general as at the present time; and he always had one or more students in his office. Everyone of these students will testify to the thoroughness of his instruction. In the preparation of cases, he was most diligent and painstaking, investigating every point of fact and law with the greatest possible care and overlooking nothing which hard work and diligent application could overcome. Fully conscious of his own strength, he scorned to gain advantage by the slightest approach to trickery or deception, and exemplified in his practice the highest standard of professional ethics.\n\nAs a citizen, Mr. Waller stood for high ideals, for liberty and law. He was congenial, democratic and approachable. He drew men to him by a charm that lured and fascinated. He was by nature conservative. He believed in progress but not in radical change. In the days of his practice, personal injury cases were defaulted and tried to the court. He urged the right of jury trial in place of the defaulting system. He contended for the property rights of women and for their emancipation from archaic forms of law. He spoke in favor of woman suffrage when it was everywhere unpopular. He lived to see his contentions become established facts. He believed in reform and progress but was not a fanatic.\n\nMr. Waller was a consistent and loyal member of the Episcopal Church. In 1859, when a very young man, he married Charlotte, the daughter of Mr. Charles Bishop, of New London. Mrs. Waller died in 1910. He was survived at his death by a daughter, the wife of William R. Appleby, a professor in the faculty of the University of Minnesota, and by five sons, Tracy, Martin B., Robert K. and Charles B., all lawyers, and John M., of the theatrical profession.\n\nTo have known Mr. Waller personally was a great privilege. The story of his life from such humble beginnings to positions of honor, power and usefulness to the whole community is an inspiration and shows what can be done by ability, energy and character in this blessed land of opportunity. God grant that so it shall always remain.\n\n*Prepared by Judge Christopher L. Avery of the Superior Court, at the request of the Reporter.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 62, pages 607 - 614\n\nSamuel Larkin Warner was born at Wethersfield, in this state, on the 14th of June, 1828, and died at Middletown, where he had for many years resided, on the 6th of February, 1893. His ancestors on both sides were among the first settlers of Boston and Ipswich, Massachusetts, and his father's family sprang directly from the sturdy founders of his native Wethersfield.\n\nIn his youth he attended the common schools of Wethersfield, and afterwards completed his home studies at the academy in that town. After this he conducted a common school for four years. At the termination of his career as a school-master, and about the time he had attained his majority, he determined to adopt the law as his profession. He commenced his legal studies in the office of William N. Matson, Esq., at Hartford. After remaining there some time, closely and thoroughly applying himself to the study of legal principles, he entered the Yale law school, and afterwards completed his course of study at Harvard law school. He was admitted to the bar in Boston, in 1854, and then returned to Hartford, intending to commence the practice of law in that city. But Governor Pond, then recently elected, proposed the make him his executive secretary, and he accepted the office. This was a responsible and honorable position for so young a man but was wisely bestowed as the result showed, for young Warner prosecuted the duties of the office with diligence, thoroughness and ability, receiving the commendation of the leading men of that time. At the close of Gov. Pond's administration he removed to Portland and commenced the practice of law in that town, where he soon secured a successful and lucrative practice. At this time he took quite an interest in politics, and by study and observation became well posted upon public questions. In 1858 he was chosen to represent the town of Portland in the state legislature.\n\nAs his practice increased his reputation as a painstaking and acute lawyer grew proportionately in Middlesex County, and he soon found it necessary, in order to accommodate his growing practice, to establish himself in the city of Middletown. Here he secured a large clientage and a reputation as a successful practitioner and jury lawyer. He soon attained a prominence in the courts of the state, where he contended against many eminent lawyers, holding his own, and often with excellent success.\n\nIn 1852 he was elected mayor of Middletown. He was ambitious to increase the popularity of his adopted city in every direction, and he applied himself earnestly to the task. It was mainly through his efforts that the splendid system of the public water supply and sewerage was established there. All this time he took a deep interest in politics and at the breaking out of the civil war, though a zealous democrat before this period, he arrayed himself on the side of the federal union. First, a union democrat, he soon became an ardent republican. His prominence in public affairs soon drew to him the voters in that part of the state, and in 1862 he was nominated for Congress against the late Gov. English, a strong and popular man in the district, and was defeated. In 1864 he was again nominated, and now, just at the close of the war, and upon the successes of the federal arms, he was elected by Congress by a handsome majority. His term in Congress was marked by the close attention to his duty, and by enthusiastic and efficient support of the republican administration. He was a warm supporter and great admirer of Abraham Lincoln, and at the latter's second nomination for the presidency he supported him as a delegate at the national convention.\n\nAt the centennial celebration of Middletown, held on July 14th, 1884, by invitation of the committee appointed for that purpose, he delivered an oration. It was an able presentation of historical information connected with the event.\n\nAfter the close of his congressional career, although he always took a deep interest in political affairs, he turned his attention once more to his professional duties.\n\nMr. Warner was philanthropic in his nature; a lover of his fellow men, he hated slavery and oppression; and it was this sentiment that drove him from his old party and into the ranks of the union democrats just previous to the breaking out of the civil war. While he was an earnest student of public questions and dipped deep into the theories of political economy, he took a great interest in all measures pertaining to local affairs in his own town, county and state. He was foremost as an adviser and participant in all progressive movements looking to the improvement of the moral and material welfare of his own community.\n\nAs a lawyer he was studious and industrious and thorough in his investigation of legal principles and precedents. He was especially successful as an advocate in the trial of jury causes, and in the court of last resort, where he argued many cases of importance, his briefs were prepared with great care and thoroughness and his arguments were able and weighty. He had a profound love for his profession and always exhibited an unwavering devotion to the interests of his clients. He was invariably kind, courteous and accommodating in his treatment of his brethren at the bar, and this trait of his character was especially noteworthy in his conduct towards the younger members of the profession.\n\nMr. Warner was married in 1855 to Mary E., daughter of John Harris Esq., of Norwich, Conn. By this marriage he had two sons, Harris, born in 1858, and Charles Winthrop, born in 1863.\n\nAt a special session of the Superior Court called for the purpose and held at Middletown, February 13th, 1893, at which Judge Silas A. Robinson, himself a resident of Middletown, presided, appropriate resolutions expressive of the affectionate respect and high esteem in which he was held by his professional brethren were presented to the court by William T. Elmer, Esq., state attorney; upon which Mr. Elmer addressed the court as follows:\n\nREMARKS OF MR. ELMER.\n\nBefore taking up the consideration for final disposition of these resolutions, your Honor, I would submit a few remarks with reference to the death of our brother. This is hardly the time or place for forensic display, but what we have to humbly offer to-day over his grave must be tributes moved rather by the heart than by the head. It would argue him unknown to his brother members of the bar who knew him in his career so well, and which is now so familiar to the public, if I should enter into elaborate biographical details. We all know how he was the product of the good soil of New England, and the commonwealth of our dear state; he was born in a neighboring town, he received a good education in his youth, and then later, that sharp and healthy discipline which every young man gets who undertakes his own education, the experience of the country school teacher. We know, also, how after that he drilled in the law in two different law schools, one in this state, and one in Massachusetts; how, after that, he went to Hartford, and in the office of an eminent lawyer there prepared for admission to the bar, and was there admitted. Then afterwards, going to Portland, he became a practitioner there, then to Middletown, and you are all familiar with his long and successful career as an attorney here, in all our courts, state and federal. You also know how he was elected to Congress, and his association with leading statesmen; how in this community, not only as a lawyer but as a citizen, he was one of the best advisors in all matters which pertain to improvements for the benefit of the city; how it was his intelligence and push and determination that established one of our greatest improvements, which, though then considered by many a useless luxury, has become a necessity and blessing to-day. All these things are familiar, I believe, to every member of this bar. As the resolutions say, your Honor, his devotion to his clients and his clients' interests, through all phases, I may add, of legal warfare, in advance or retreat, in storm or sunshine, was knightly in its character. The whole case was absorbed in his personality; so he stood the client himself, until every redoubt was captured and every obstacle overcome. With untiring watchfulness, with inexhaustible perseverance, with terrible earnestness, never looking back over his shoulder, he advanced when many faint-hearted dropped by the wayside. Though the two characters were totally unlike in many respects, as it was said of the late Martin Welles (of the same birthplace, by the way, and he an eminent lawyer in his day,) Mr. Warner never yielded, never struck his flag, until the case was pushed to that point beyond which there was no further remedy in law or equity, and then yielded gracefully, which never could be said of the late Mr. Welles. Though he won oftener than he lost, if the latter fate befell his client he could rest assured that every resource known to the law had been exhausted. He was a powerful advocate, and had many winning ways with the jury; but woe to the luckless man who trifled with him in cross-examination. The tide of his wonderful earnestness and powerful analysis in jury trials often carried the ordinary juror off his feet, and swept him into Mr. Warner's camp before he recovered his reason. He always preferred a fair field, and an open enemy, a trial upon its merits, to the pitfalls and briary mazes of technicalities and special pleading. While he was an unrelenting foe in professional contests, he nursed no bitterness afterwards; he cherished (I speak advisedly when I say cherished) no petty resentments. When the fight was over, whether he lost or won, his heart was too tender to plan or nourish revenges. It was easy to him to forgive and forget. This was the true nobility of his soul. It was my fortune for a quarter of a century to be associated with him or arrayed against him in the trial and management of many causes, and no word of acrimony ever passed between us outside of these rooms. I never asked of him a favor but, if in his power, it was freely conferred; and when once his hand was given, no more loyal friend lived on earth. The satisfaction of having helped a friend seemed to him to be reward enough for the favor conferred. As counselor in all important matters his advice was only given after diligent investigation and mature deliberation, and it was given as freely and as conscientiously to the young lawyer, only to him it was without money and without price. As was said of another eminent practitioner, now also gone, \"with rare industry, with enthusiasm in his profession, with untiring devotion to the interests committed to his care, and with an unusual knowledge of men and tact in the management of causes, he united a high sense of professional honor and a firm allegiance to moral duty. He gained and retained to a remarkable degree the confidence of his clients, and even when the result of the litigation was less favorable then they had hoped, they were never disposed to attribute it to any failure of judgment, relaxation of effort, or want of ability on his part.\" He loved the law, and the logic involved in its investigation. To his profession he was devotedly attached. He loved its science, its eloquence, and its wit. As was said of the late Governor Hubbard, \"he was proud of its history, of its contributions to philosophy and literature, of its manifold struggles in defense of human rights and assaults upon human wrongs.\" He loved his profession with the zeal of enthusiasm and the loyalty of chivalry. He gave to his client the best of his brain, the best of his experience, the best of his vital energy and of his waning health, even unto the door of death. It was my fortune to be associated with him in the last case he ever tried in this court, and one of the most important ever presented here, exciting great public interest; and when I congratulated him upon the survival of his old time energy and legal acumen, he said sadly-- \"I think I shall not last until the end.\" Every man knows his own heart. He knew better than we, could see with clearer sight the clouds of decline that were settling slowly down upon his life; but he worked on until he realized his last triumph in court. But words, your Honor, will not add to his worth. We bow to the Almighty decree and to the fate that must come to us all. It will be well with us if, at the end, it can be said that our life work was so well finished. And over his grave, brethren, let us renew our allegiance to our noble profession and our loyalty to each other.\n\nOther addresses were made by Messrs. A. B. Calef, A. W. Bacon, W. U. Pearne, D. W. Northrop, M. E. Culver, and D. J. Donahue.\n\nJudge Robinson responded as follows: --\n\nREMARKS OF JUDGE ROBINSON.\n\nDoes any other member of the bar desire to speak on this motion? If not, I wish to say a few words with reference to this matter and to our brother.\n\nTo say that in the death of our Brother Warner the bar of the state has met with a great loss, expresses but weakly my feelings. The bar of this county, to a man, I think, feels this loss more sensibly than they can express. It seems but yesterday that we saw him in this room, earnest, active and vigilant in the cause of a client. Our brother died, so to speak, with the harness on. I think he preferred it so; with the restless activity of mind which he possessed, a life of enforced idleness or a lingering death, would have been well nigh intolerable. He has gone direct from the activities of his profession into the rest which eternity affords. I think he had almost no doubt as to the future life. He always talked of it calmly, and never believed, at least in later years, that the growth and development of the human mind, and soul ceased with this existence. He believed that the present was but a preparatory school for the grander education to begin at death; and always said that he had no fear of the change. His faith in the wisdom and goodness of God was profound.\n\nI think those who knew him best admired him most. No one who knew him well could retain anything but kindness for him. He had the frank, impulsive nature and sympathies of a boy, with the strong will and the strong intellect of a man. In many respects Brother Warner was a remarkable man. He came of an ancestry of hard sense; people who thought, and thought seriously; people who read and remembered; people to whom it was not the sole problem of life how to be fed and clothed; people who believed in character and character-building; an ancestry of hard, rugged sense, who believed in work and the benefits of work more than in the inspiration of genius. Born and bred in a New England atmosphere, with the education of the common school, the academy, and the law school, he, a boy from a farmer's home, rose to an enviable position at the bar of the state. Brother Warner was one of the best fruits of such an ancestry. Our friend had exceedingly bright talents, but he was a tremendous worker withal. He had a genius for work. He seemed to let go of work when obliged to, and take it up again with a facility that to me was astonishing. It seemed as if in the interim, whatever he may have been about, the unfinished work was carried right along in his mind. It seemed as if it never left him. He thoroughly believed in work, and the efficiency of work; and, as a worker, as an industrious, thorough preparer of cases, he has through his entire career been an example for the whole bar. No man ever sat down at the counsel table to try a cause with Mr. Warner for his antagonist who did not appreciate this, and who did not arise from it with a profound respect for his sagacity, his quickness, his learning, and his masterful strength. He was a hard antagonist, but he was a generous one. No one ever knew him to take a mean advantage of his opponent.\n\nHe was one of the most loyal men to his clients that I ever knew. So great was his sense of nearness to them that he disliked to hear them lightly spoken of as to matters even outside of a case. His clients he regarded as his friends, not to be spoken of in uncomplimentary terms in his presence without some protest from him. His clients rarely ever forsook him for anyone else. As a rule, once his client, always his client. He served to bind his client to him. He was a legal adviser who habitually inspired confidence. He was a courageous man, and an astute lawyer, and no one who advised with him could fail to see it. His great power as an advocate has for years been conceded by the bench and the bar of the state. He was, I think, you will all agree with me, facile princeps at the bar of this county, and the number of his equals in the whole state can easily be computed. When I was at the bar, I was with him in a great many cases as associate counsel, and I can say that he was always a most agreeable associate. He never concealed his ideas from his associate; his ideas were common property in the case, to be made the best possible use of to accomplish a successful result. No party jealousy of an associate ever entered his mind; and he always prompt and quick to give an associate credit for what was due him on the score of ideas. He never seemed to care whose idea or point won the case, so long as the case was won. He was always a strong, manly generous companion in arms; and I count among some of the pleasantest, most profitable, and instructive days of my professional life, those that I spent by his side in legal contests that took place in this county.\n\nHe was invariably kind to the young men in the profession. He seemed never to have forgotten his own timidity and sense of weakness as a young and inexperienced advocate, and it seemed to give him pleasure to offer encouragement to younger men. Many words of encouragement he has spoken to me. I remember with what trepidation I approached my first argument in the Supreme Court of this state. He had prepared his printed brief, and something occurred that took his associate out of the case, and he came in the office one morning and said--\"You will have to argue this case for me.\" I said--\"I can't do it Mr. Warner; I know nothing of the case. The facts are voluminous, and the law questions I am not familiar with.\" I said--\"Do you think I can argue it?\" \"Certainly you can,\" he said. \"There is nothing in the case that need cause you to hesitate.\" I looked at the brief, and looked through it, and I thought when I had completed the examination that there was a great deal to make me hesitate; but I thought, under the circumstances, I should be a great coward if I did not try to do what he seemed to think I could do; and so I went at the work of preparing a brief for myself to speak from. I argued the case; how I argued it I don't know. I managed to get through it in some shape; but the encouragement of his words, and the stimulus of such an experience, I had the greatest reason to be thankful for; and he paid me munificently for the work which I did; and he did this with great apparent pleasure. Such was his generosity and such his practical encouragement to one young man of little experience. And I am not the only one that he has helped and encouraged. He made no parade about it; he sounded no trumpet when he did it.\n\nOur brother was also one of the most generous men towards the weaknesses and faults of those of our profession. He was loyal to the profession. If any one spoke of the faults or weaknesses of a brother lawyer he would say-- \"Who has not his faults and weaknesses? I have mine. We must take men as we find them. There is good in everybody, if we get close to them and get to know them well.\" He tried to think well of his brethren and threw the mantle of charity over their shortcomings. I think I never knew a man whose sympathies responded so quickly to the voice of one oppressed or in suffering as his did; and his defense of such was always vigorous; and his assistance, pecuniary or otherwise, on such occasions, was rendered in such a way as to show that what he did was a real pleasure to him. Ten years and more we sat at the same desk, and in the same office, and I never knew him to refuse to espouse the cause of a man or woman because they lacked means to pay him.\n\nNo man that I ever knew was a better companion. He had a fund of humor and sincere good feeling that always made him enjoyable socially. He had a store of general information that always made him an interesting and instructive talker. His extensive reading, and his faculty for getting and retaining knowledge upon a great variety of subjects, and his facility in imparting it, made him a most desirable companion. His society was not shunned by the bar, but, on the contrary, was courted; and when he was a member of any little circle of lawyers, young or old, or both, whether gathered by accident or by invention, rarely did any one take his departure so long as Brother Warner remained. He was the life of such gatherings. He was not commonplace in his ideas or in his mode of expressing them. He always felt that he was a learner, and had the intellectual humility of a real learner; he was both a learner and a teacher; but what he said on such occasion was never said with air of an oracle, but as one friend would talk with another about something he had found which he wanted the other also to know and to enjoy the benefit of.\n\nThere were very many delightful traits in our brother's character; much in his life and habits worthy of admiration; much that it would be well for us all to follow; much that we can remember with profit and satisfaction; much the forgetting of which would make us losers. Much more could be said, and better than I can say it, of our brother's character. I have said but a little of what I feel; but what I have uttered has been prompted by a sincere affection, and comes from an intimate acquaintance with him of many years.\n\nGentlemen, the court heartily concurs in the set of resolutions presented, and hereby orders that they be entered by the clerk upon the records of this court, and made a part thereof.\n\n*Prepared at the request of the reporter by William T. Elmer Esq., of the Middletown bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 57, pages 592 - 595\n\n[The following sketch of Mr. Watrous was prepared by Ex-Governor Henry B. Harrison of the New Haven County bar for the American Bar Association and will appear in vol. 12th of its reports.]\n\nThe time has come when no man whose life has ended can be long remembered in this busy world unless he has had a career of eminent distinction.\n\nHe whose chief claim upon public regard consists in the fact that he has faithfully devoted high natural gifts of intellect and moral character, combined with thorough education and training, to the discharge of the duties of any profession, however honorable, must soon be forgotten.\n\nIt is right however that when such a man has lived, and loyally done his work, and finished it, and taken his departure, some friend of his should say for him a word or two of commemoration.\n\nGEORGE HENRY WATROUS, whose paternal ancestors were natives of Connecticut, was born in Bridgewater, Pennsylvania, April 26th, 1829. Soon afterwards his father's family removed to Conklin, New York, where his earlier years were spent. After preliminary training in the common schools and at Homer Academy and, for a short time, at Madison University, he entered Yale College, as a Junior, in 1850, and there graduated as one of the most brilliant members of the celebrated class of 1853. In 1855 he was admitted to the bar at New Haven, where his subsequent life was past. In 1857 he became a partner of Governor Dutton in the practice of law under the firm name of Dutton & Watrous. This association continued until 1861, when Gov. Dutton became Judge of the Supreme Court. Mr. Watrous remained in practice, conducting a very large and profitable business, until 1879, when he was chosen President of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company, of which corporation he had long been a director and the principal legal adviser and representative.\n\nIn 1857 he married Harriet J. Dutton, daughter of Gov. Dutton. She died in January, 1873, leaving two sons and one daughter. In 1874 he married Lily M. Graves, daughter of Hon. Henry B. Graves of Litchfield, who, with four children, survives him.\n\nConnecticut has always had its full share of able lawyers. Among those of his own time Mr. Watrous gained a conspicuous position in the front rank. It was inevitable, from his whole \"make-up,\" that he should do so. His intellect was acute, his industry was indefatigable, and his ambition was directed exclusively to success in his profession. His scholarly education and habits had highly developed in him a natural capacity for logical reasoning and for nice and critical distinctions, together with a natural taste for the expression of his thoughts in choice and strong English. Above all he was in hearty sympathy with the moral elements of the English Common Law. He shared its spirit of absolute justice, its hatred of fraud, its love of good faith in all things, its charitable temper, and its sound common sense. In fact his personal characteristics were to a great extent, morally, the characteristics of the law itself.\n\nDevoted as he was to the law he was not indifferent to the duties of good citizenship in affairs disconnected with his profession. His political convictions were strong, and in the earlier part of his career he was zealous among a group of young men who were specially active in originally organizing the Republican party in Connecticut. But his partisanship had no bitterness in it. In 1864 he represented New Haven in the General Assembly of the state, and at various times he was elected to municipal offices in that city, but every office that came to him came unsought.\n\nHis administration of the presidency of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company was eminently successful. He concentrated upon the management of that great corporation all his energies, both of body and of mind. The company grew steadily in strength and prosperity along many lines of development, until at last the health of Mr. Watrous broke down in its service and he consequently resigned his office in 1887. After more than two years of retirement from all business he died July 5th, 1889.\n\nThis is a very imperfect sketch of the life of an able and learned lawyer, an honest man, an accomplished scholar and a most kind and generous and courteous gentleman.\n\nAt a meeting of the bar of New Haven County held on the occasion of the death of Mr. Watrous, the following resolutions were passed:\n\n\"The members of the Bar of New Haven County have heard with deep regret that Hon. George H. Watrous, who for more than thirty years has been one of their most esteemed leaders, has departed from this life.\n\n\"During his long and eminently successful career at the bar he won respect for his commanding ability, honor for his rare integrity, admiration for his brilliant discernment and sound judgment, and affection for his unselfish nature. They unite with the citizens of New Haven in sorrow at his comparatively early demise and tender their profound sympathy to his bereaved family.\"\n\nREMARKS OF EX-GOV. CHARLES R. INGERSOLL UPON THE FOREGOING RESOLUTIONS.\n\nMR. PRESIDENT.--The resolutions presented by Judge Harrison so fittingly express the common sentiment of this bar that I know it is unnecessary for me to add to them a single word. But yet I cannot withhold the expression of my personal sense of the loss which has been sustained by this bar and the community by the death of Mr. Watrous. For although he came to the bar some years after I did, we have, ever since his admission to practice, been more or less associated, in many ways, both within and without the court-room.\n\nAnd, Mr. President, no one could be associated with George H. Watrous in any way, and particularly in his professional practice, without being very soon impressed by the force of his individuality and his personal worth. He was emphatically a strong man,--intellectually and morally a very strong man. As a lawyer, I think all of us who have been his contemporaries in practice will agree that he was unsurpassed at our bar in mental vigor and acumen. He was a learned lawyer also, and, as we all know, a most effective trier of cases, whether before court or jury. His vigorous grasp of a case was always tenaciously held until everything on his side was exhausted to his satisfaction. Perhaps this trait of perseverance led him at times to over-elaboration, but it never degenerated into weakness. Beyond all this he was, under all circumstances, a man of wholesome integrity,--of uncompromising integrity I might well say, in speaking of him professionally; for it was doubtless this high sense of the abstract right that made him so averse, as we generally found him to be, to the settlement of cases in which he felt that the right was on his side.\n\nI think, Mr. President, that we generally regretted his leaving the bar for the presidency of the railroad company, great as was the compliment to his abilities implied by the offer of that responsible and honorable position. We regretted to lose him as an associate, and we regretted to lose him from the profession. And I believe I can truly add that most of us also regretted it on his own account, for he had at that time achieved a position at the bar which, apparently, assured to him many years of successful leadership.\n\nI have thought that some such regret came to himself afterwards. And when he had laid down the burden of his railway office he seemed to be instinctively drawn to this court-room as the field of his life's ambition and pleasure. There was very much of sadness to me in those frequent visits here, when the busy actor became only the passive listener. I would have had him here in the fullness of his strength and activity. But he recalled the forest oak that had been transplanted in the years of its maturity. Very sad, too, have been the slowly advancing evidences of his failing life. And how solemnly has come the final shock Only this week, on Monday, I saw him at this table listening with interest to a case then under argument, and a day or two afterwards he spoke to me of the impressions he had received. A great change had, however, then come to him, and the contrast with the old days was most painful. But I could not have imagined, Mr. President, that before the week should close I should be here participating in this tribute to his honored life and memory.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 115, pages 731 - 734\n\nGeorge Wakeman Wheeler was born in Woodville, Mississippi, December 1st, 1860, and died at his home in Bridgeport July 27th, 1932. Though born in the south he had his roots deep in the soil of this State. His great-grandfather lived in Easton and was a judge of the Fairfield County Court. He prepared for college at Williston Seminary and was graduated from Yale University in 1881 and from the Yale Law School in 1883. Yale conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 1919, and Wesleyan that of Doctor of the Civil Law in 1931.\n\nFor ten years he practiced law in Bridgeport in association with Howard J. Curtis, his classmate and roommate in college. That partnership was dissolved in 1893 when Wheeler, at the age of thirty-two, was appointed to the Superior Court, upon the nomination of Governor Morris, and Curtis to the Fairfield County Court of Common Pleas. He went to the Supreme Court of Errors September 7th, 1910, and became Chief Justice of the State August 8th, 1920, serving until his retirement under the constitutional limitation, on December 1st, 1930, having completed nearly thirty-eight years of judicial service to the State.\n\nThe outstanding attribute of the late Chief Justice--the dominant note in his whole public career at the bar and upon the bench--was his love of justice. He said upon one occasion: \"I began the life of a trial judge loving justice and longing to hold true and high her sacred shield,\" and on another: \"In each day and each act I have tried with all my might to make the law truly serve justice.\" No one can say that he ever failed to be true to the high ideal which he had set before him. His life was truly one of service. His career upon the bench was marked by utter disinterestedness, undeviating courage, a rigid and unswerving devotion to duty and an unrivalled sense of justice. With a splendidly equipped mind, indomitable zeal and a passionate desire to do justice, he pursued his ideal of making the law the servant of justice. If upon occasion his decisions failed to be sustained upon appeal, who shall say that the cause of justice was more truly served by the decision of the appellate court than by that of the trial court? One cannot imagine him failing to meet any responsibility, or faltering in the performance of any judicial duty, or suffering any compromise with anything below his own high standards of conduct. As was said by Chief Justice Maltbie at the dinner tendered Judge Wheeler upon his retirement: \"One thought and one thought alone at all times has moved him--to serve justice truly, to follow whatever path it might point out, blind, not to the conditions of life as it exists, or to the ever changing needs of the times, but blind to all interests and motives save those which can stand the bright light of disinterested service to society and his fellow men.\"\n\nFor twenty years Judge Wheeler sat upon the bench of the highest court of our State, for ten years as Associate Justice and ten more years as Chief Justice. These were the fruitful, culminating years of his career, fraught with so much of benefit for the State. His opinions are to be found in thirty volumes of our reports. They have left an indelible impress upon the jurisprudence of the State. The same striving to make the law truly serve the cause of justice is to be found in them, whether he wrote for a majority of the court or in dissent when it appeared to him that the opinion of the majority had failed in that attempt. His opinions construing the Workmen's Compensation Act established the broad and liberal construction adopted in this State, and have strongly influenced the trend of compensation decisions in other jurisdictions, where they have been widely cited and followed. Many of his opinions have established the substantive law of the State in matters of great public interest or have pointed the way to remedial legislation by the General Assembly. His long experience, his profound knowledge of substantive law and procedure and his sound judgment gave extraordinary weight to his opinions in the conference room, and caused his associates to question carefully a conclusion which was contrary to his considered judgment.\n\nUpon his retirement the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts adopted the following minute:\n\n\"The notable achievements of George W. Wheeler as a trial judge are preserved, for all time, in the records of the Superior Court, covering a period of seventeen years preceding 1910. Grateful memories of his helpful kindness to young and inexperienced practitioners are treasured by many.\n\n\"His contributions to substantive law and to the cause of justice generally during ten years of service as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors and a decade as Chief Justice are permanently evidenced in the decisions of that court and widely recognized by the profession and the public.\n\n\"Fruits of his expenditure of time and talent are also abundant in statutes passed at his suggestion, the reports of the Judicial Council, forward-looking rules and statutes adopted in consequence, the work of the Law Institute, and in countless other contributions to the cause of justice and the public welfare.\n\n\"We heartily join in the generally entertained and frequently expressed pride in and commendation of these manifestations of his ability, wisdom, industry, energy and other outstanding attributes of mind and character, sentiments which are intensified in us by that familiarity with and appreciation of these achievements which we have gained by association and lesser participation in endeavor in the common cause--the administration and promotion of justice.\n\n\"Rarely has a man so lived in, with and for the law as, for many years, has our retiring Chief Justice. With indomitable energy and fervent zeal he has devoted himself to constant, intense, and unremitting toil; not otherwise could labors and results of such magnitude and scope have been accomplished.\n\n\"Maintenance of high ideals of judicial administration, the probity and dignity of the courts, efficiency and progressive improvement of procedure, the patient hearing and careful consideration of each cause, have been among the objects of his keen solicitude and zealous care as Chief Justice.\n\n\"Although thus engrossed in and pressed by his heavy responsibilities and the tasks in which he has been so steadily engaged, his loyalty to associates and friends has remained true and constant, his interest in them and theirs alert, and his sympathetic response to bereavement or affliction unfailing, instant, and of rare helpfulness in expression. These manifestations of friendly solicitude and consideration have engendered in us a deep and abiding personal affection.\n\n\"We cannot permit the occasion of his retirement as Chief Justice to pass without this permanent expression, however inadequate, of our appreciation of the rare privilege of his friendship and of our association with him, which has been and will continue to be to each and all of us an incentive and inspiration to high endeavor.\"\n\nThis expression of the admiration and affection of his associates upon the bench bears witness to the high regard and strong personal attachment felt by each and every one of them for the Chief Justice with and under whom they had served.\n\nJudge Wheeler's devotion to the law and to public service led him to give unstintingly of his time and energy to many causes outside of his judicial duties. He was largely influential in procuring the adoption by the Superior Court in 1890 of rules of admission to the bar providing uniform standards of admission and requirements of study to qualify candidates to take the examination, and establishing a state bar examining committee. He was one of the original members of that committee and its chairman from 1912 until 1919 when he resigned as such and from the committee in 1920, having rendered for thirty years invaluable service to the profession and the State in raising and maintaining the standards of admission to the bar.\n\nIn the formation of the Judicial Council, over which he presided from the time of its establishment until his retirement, the Chief Justice found a field of activity in which to do constructive work in an endeavor to make our judicial system a more effective instrument for justice. With characteristic zeal and enthusiasm he organized the Council and directed the work of initiating changes in the judicial system of the State and reform in practice and procedure. In this, as in every undertaking in which he engaged, he labored unceasingly and effectively.\n\nFrom 1924 until his death he was a member of the Council of The American Law Institute engaged in the work of simplification and restatement of the common law of the United States. This work of tremendous magnitude and importance, engaging the services of the ablest jurists and legal scholars in the country, was one which made a strong appeal to the Chief Justice, and to it he gave unsparingly of his time and energy. He never missed a meeting of the Council and devoted untold hours of labor to the critical examination and revision of the restatements of the law which were submitted to the Council for approval. Sound learning, discriminating criticism, great industry and marked patience characterized his work, which was recognized as an outstanding contribution to the jurisprudence of this country.\n\nUpon two occasions Judge Wheeler was tendered an appointment upon the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States for the Second Circuit, which he declined. As a member of the State Council of Defense during the late war he was indefatigable in patriotic services of the highest order. No opportunity for public service and no call of civil duty ever found him unresponsive. He was especially interested in the work of Americanization among our citizens of foreign birth and antecedents and his labors in that field bore abundant fruit.\n\nHis public career is a priceless heritage of the State and an incentive and inspiration to all who were associated with him in the many activities in which he rendered such notable service to his city, his state and to the nation.\n\nJudge Wheeler's private life was marked by devotion to his family and loyalty to his friends. His associates cherish memories of innumerable acts of kindness and expressions of sympathy in times of affliction. Many deeds of charity, never disclosed by him, are held in grateful remembrance by the recipients of his bounty.\n\nJudge Wheeler was married July 5th, 1894, to Agnes Leonard Macy, who died August 24th, 1919. Two children, Mrs. W. Parker Seeley and George Macy Wheeler, survive him.\n\n*Prepared by Hon. John W. Banks, of Bridgeport, at the request of the Reporter.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 83, page iii\n\nAppointed to Supreme Court April 14th, 1909, to take effect September 7th, 1910.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 94, page iv (also printed in volume 95, page iii)\n\nAppointed Chief Justice February 13th, 1919, to take effect August 8d, 1920.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 111, page iii (also printed in volume 112, page iii)\n\nRetired December 1st, 1930, under constitutional limitation as to age.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 47, pages 615 - 617\n\nHENRY WHITE, of New Haven, died on October 7th, 1880, at the age of seventy-seven years.\n\nHis name seldom appears among the counsel in cases reported in these volumes, but he probably tried during the half century of his active professional life more causes as a committee, auditor, or arbitrator, than any other member of the bar.\n\nMr. White was born and bred in New Haven, where his father, Hon. Dyer White, was a lawyer before him, and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas.\n\nHe was graduated at Yale College in 1821, taking the highest honors of his class, and after spending a year or two in the Divinity School, returned to the Academical Department as a tutor, holding this position from 1823 to 1825.\n\nThe next two years were spent at the Yale Law School, and in 1828 he entered the New Haven County Bar.\n\nHe had been, from boyhood, of a singularly gentle, modest, and retiring disposition, with none of the gifts of oratory, and little ambition for public distinction.\n\nThe only son of a family in easy circumstances, he and they were more anxious that he should make himself a good lawyer, than that he should strive to acquire at once a paying practice.\n\nHe comforted the writer of this sketch, when he found himself with little or nothing to do soon after his admission to the bar, by telling him that his own professional income during his first year was precisely six dollars.\n\nThe indexes to the land records of New Haven, at this time, were often untrustworthy. In 1832 Mr. White was left executor of a considerable estate, consisting largely of landed property, and his attention was particularly called to this and other difficulties in searching titles. The result was ten years of patient labor, often carried far into the night, in copying and bringing together in convenient form all the grants, devises, distributions and conveyances of land in the town, from the first settlement to the year 1800. This mass of material derived from the town, colonial and court records, was carefully digested and indexed, and, from that time forward, he was able, without going out of his own office, to trace the title to any land in New Haven down to within a few years, if not days. This soon became, in connection with the settlement of estates, the main business of his life, and the same system of investigation was, in several instances, extended to the records of neighboring towns.\n\nHe was probably the first Connecticut lawyer who deliberately selected a special line of professional practice as most suited to his tastes and circumstances, and pursued it almost exclusively. It was a bold undertaking in so small a place as New Haven then was, but the result showed that he was fully justified in believing that whoever did this one thing well would find it enough. A certificate of title from his office soon came to be required, as a matter of course, in almost all considerable real estate transactions, and though his customary charges were not predicated on the value of the property, and would seem absurdly small to a New York practitioner, he was so often called upon as to be for many years in receipt of a handsome professional income from this source alone.\n\nFor a long period of years Mr. White acted as executor, administrator, guardian, and trustee, more frequently than any other member of the profession in the city. There was probably hardly any large estate settled in the probate district of New Haven, between 1835 and 1875, with which be had not something to do. Two of the leading testamentary cases in this series of reports bear his name--White v. Fisk, 22 Corm., 31, and White v. Howard, 38 Conn., 342--in both of which he sued as executor for the construction of a will.\n\nTo these special branches of practice he confined himself closely, never taking part in the trial of contested cases except as a committee, auditor or arbitrator, in which capacity, as has been already said, his services were often sought, and in all parts of the state. His mind was eminently a judicial one, and whoever appeared before him felt that his case had been heard patiently and candidly, and that no pains would be spared to arrive at the right conclusion.\n\nFor a short time after the death of Professor Townsend Mr. White gave instruction in the Yale Law School. His style as a writer was clear and simple, and his lectures are spoken of with commendation by those who were then students there.\n\nMr. White was well known throughout the state as an authority in all matters of local history and family genealogy. He was for many years a Vice-President of the Connecticut Historical Society, and became, upon its formation, the first President of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, contributing two of the most important articles in the first volume of its published Papers. The map of New Haven in 1641, which is prefixed to Atwater's History of the Colony of New Haven, was made up, to a large extent, from data furnished by him. In 1876 he was requested by the Common Council of New Haven to prepare, as one of the memorials of the centennial year, a topographical history of the town, but failing health compelled him to decline.\n\nIn one way or another he was identified with most of the older institutions of the city in such positions as President of the Corporation owning Long Wharf, Chairman of the Committee of Proprietors of Common and Undivided Lands, Trustee of the Old Town Farm, and of the Hopkins Grammar School, and Auditor of Yale College.\n\nMr. White was one of those who, so far at least as human eye can see, seem to be Christians from their cradle. For more than half his life he was a Deacon of the First Church in New Haven, and his religion was an unmistakable part of his daily life. He was also a member of most of the national charitable societies, in which the Congregationalist denomination are especially interested, and long the President of one of them--the Society for promoting Collegiate and Theological Education at the West.\n\nIn 1830 he was married to Martha Sherman, a grand-daughter of Roger Sherman, the signer of the Declaration of Independence, and their golden wedding was happily celebrated a few months before his death. Four of his sons are members of the New Haven bar, and during the last few years of his life he left the active business of his office wholly to them, and except in closing up estates with which he was still connected, attempted nothing more serious than such light literary labor as his tastes inclined him to, in pursuing historical researches in his ample library.\n\nAt the time of his death he was the father of the bar in his county, a bar numbering a hundred and eighty-four members. When he entered it there were but nineteen lawyers in New Haven, four in Waterbury, and eight in other parts of the county. He long outlived all these, and he outlived also the next professional generation which came after them. He habitually worked late, often till past midnight, never was an early riser, and never took bodily exercise for the sake of exercise, but he probably survived his contemporaries because, without doing less labor, he took life more easily than they. He had not the ordinary conflicts of the bar or the excitement of the public platform to disturb the native serenity of his disposition. He was never in a hurry, and seldom had occasion to be. Kindness and courtesy, gentleness and moderation, belonged to his nature, and there was nothing in his professional life to make him ever forget them. It was a life quiet and peaceful, even in its flow, tranquil in its close.\n\n*Prepared at the request of the Reporter by Simeon E. Baldwin, Esq., of the New Haven Bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 87, pages 717 - 720\n\nHENRY CHARLES WHITE died at his home in New Haven February 7th, 1914. He was born in Utica, New York, September 1st, 1856, the son of Thomas Broughton White and Catherine Lydia (Stewart) White. His father, who had been a merchant in New York, died when Henry was but four years of age, and his mother two years later. He attended the Academy at Vernon, New York, the Hungerford Collegiate Institute in Adams, New York, and Phillips Exeter Academy, then entered Yale, graduating from the Academic Department in 1881 and from the Yale Law School in 1883, after which he took advanced studies in law and received the degree of Master of Laws in 1884. From that time he was in active practice in New Haven until within two years of his death. In 1889 he formed a partnership with Leonard M. Daggett, and they later associated with them for several years John Q. Tilson, who retired from the firm in 1908, then James Kingsley Blake until his death in 1911, then Thomas Hooker, Jr., and in 1913 the firm of White, Daggett and Hooker was consolidated, under the firm name of Bristol and White, with the firm in which Hon. Henry Stoddard, John W. Bristol and Samuel H. Fisher had been partners.\n\nQualified by character and temperament as a leader, and schooled from early youth in self-reliance by the early death of his parents, and coming to college somewhat older than his fellows, he from the start drew to himself the confidence, respect and devotion of all those with whom he worked and came in contact. While he always, in college and afterward, took a manly and wholesome interest in athletics and out-door life, and was active socially, yet his strong hold on other men, even in his early days, lay in his serious purpose and his resolution that he should bear his part in the serious work of life. While in college he took active part in the debating of his day, was a speaker at the Junior exhibition, a member of the Skull and Bones Society, a church member and active in church work.\n\nMr. White was a close student of the principles of municipal government and active in his advocacy of reform measures. From 1886 to 1892 he was an instructor in the graduate school of Yale, giving a course of lectures on the practical problems of municipal government, in 1889 was appointed by the legislature one of a special commission to investigate the New Haven town government, and in 1893 again one of a commission to report a revision of the city charter. The plan for consolidation of the Town, City, and School District governments, adopted in 1897, was largely the product of his labor, and in 1897 and 1898 he served on the newly constituted Board of Finance, by hard and effective work assisting in putting the new plan into successful operation. In 1899 he was appointed on the commission which made the Revision of the General Statutes adopted in 1902 and which at the same time drafted a new corporation law and a law for taxation of banks and insurance companies.\n\nIn his earliest years of practice he was employed by the New Haven Taxpayers Association, and later was frequently called upon by groups of public-spirited citizens to act in their behalf for the correction of public abuses. This interested and active service in matters of public concern naturally gave a characteristic color to his private practice. It would have been useless to ask his assistance to defend or perpetuate a wrong. His clients were not of the people who put the gains of commerce above the dignity of the law.\n\nThough successful in trial work, most of his work was outside of the courts; he was often named and accepted as committee by both parties in important cases. Two cases in which he acted as committee, of special importance, in both of which his findings were affirmed by the courts, were: Norwich Gas and Electric Company v. City of Norwich, 76 Conn. 565 (appraisal of property of public service company), and Murdock, State’s Attorney, v. Elliott, 77 Conn. 247 (accounting of trustees of Morgan School in Clinton). Much of his best work was done in matters of great complication, where his real success lay in the prevention of ruinous litigation, and in receivership matters, where clear-headed administration was more valuable to those involved than insistence on technical rights.\n\nHe was constantly at work, and in all that he did his success was due to the same qualities, whether the problem was of government, of business, or of human nature. His purpose was always the same, and he always began his work by clearing away the rubbish. Confusion and complication were never a discouragement - they were his opportunity, even his incentive, - and he never wavered in his purpose or feared for the result, for with him the desired result was whatever consequence might follow from patient and honest effort to learn the truth.\n\nIn the negotiation of settlements, in the embarrassing differences which, are bound to arise in the administration of both business and charitable organizations, in fact, in all his dealings with other men, Mr. White’s judgment and tact were exerted with unusual force. Always straightforward, always ready to concede good faith on the part of others, always giving to opposing claims their full share of merit, he often opened the avenue to a solution and adjustment acknowledged as satisfactory to all parties. Seldom suspicious of the motives of others, he was seldom met by others in any but a trustful attitude. His unusual quickness, too, to discern and discard what rang false, with a readiness of decision and a willingness to abide its consequences, made him a helpful executive in the conduct of business and other enterprises.\n\nAs a reader, he sought and found not only stimulus from those who have thought deeply and spoken clearly, but also the cheering sympathy of those who have brightened the world by their wit. What he read and what he himself thought he translated into simple speech, often driven home by a homely, but forceful, metaphor. His company was sought no less than his advice, and whether in work or recreation, his friendliness was so evident and his own experience of life so rich, that he bound to himself all whom he met. These things are spoken of here especially because they will help one to understand his position at the bar and in our community.\n\nHe took an active part in the development of the Trust Company now known as the Union and New Haven Trust Company, was one of its directors and a member of its executive committee, was for many years a director of the First National Bank, of the General Hospital Society of Connecticut, of the Organized Charities, and a trustee of the New Haven Orphan Asylum; since about 1892 had been a member of the State Bar Examining Committee and for several years its treasurer, and one of the Executive Committee of the State Bar Association. For about two years before his death he was unable to give any continued attention to business, but until nearly the last still hoped to get back into the traces and bear his share of the world’s work.\n\nHe had been since 1882 a member of Center Church and had filled the office of deacon. Rev. Oscar Maurer, in a sermon delivered the day after Mr. White’s death, paid him a very unusual tribute, closing with these words:—\n\n“There are some characters that are dwarfed by failure. They undertake some task and when they find it will not be successful, they begin to shrink. On the other hand, there are some great souls which seem to gain strength every time they are thrown to the earth. Not only this church alone, but the entire city, is mourning the death of a man who possessed this power. Mr. White knew what it was to suffer failure. Within the last few years again and again some treasured purpose of his has been thwarted by ill health and physical weakness; and yet the true greatness of Henry White’s character was never more visible than during the final weeks of his illness. Many a man in New Haven has gone forth from that "
