        "text": "2. Location and Climate Early Inhabitants Early settlement The Relation between the Natives and the New Settlers Religion Economy outlines Government\n\n4. Connecticut has lo ng, hot summers and cold winters. The climate does not vary greatly from place to place, although the northwest corner generally experiences more severe winters. Location and Climate\n\n5. 1614 1633 1636 1637 1638 1639 The Dutch navigator, Adriaen Block, was the first European of record to explore the area, sailing up the Connecticut River colonists from Plymouth built a trading post and stockade near the site of present-day Windsor. That same year the Dutch, anxious to protect their claim to the region, erected their first and only fort in Connecticut, at Hartford. The largest migration occurred when a well-known minister, Thomas Hooker, led about 100 colonists from Newtown (now Cambridge, Massachusetts) to settle at Hartford The Pequot people resisted white settlement, but they were defeated by the English in the short Pequot War representatives of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, the three principal settlements in the Connecticut River valley, met at Hartford to discuss plans to unite the settlements into a single colony On January 14, 1639, the colony of Connecticut was formed, and the colonists formally adopted a basic set of laws known as the Fundamental Orders\n\n6. The name \"Connecticut\" is an Algonquian Indian word It means \"long river\" and refers to the Connecticut River. There were originally many small American Indian tribes in the Connecticut area, including the Mohegan, Pequot, Niantic, Nipmuc, Mattabesic, Schaghticoke, Paugussett, and others\n\n7. Most powerful among the Connecticut people were the Pequot, who lived in the east and along the shore of Long Island Sound, an area they had conquered from other native groups at the end of the 1500s. Early in the 1600s, a number of Pequots split off from the main group. Led by a chief named Uncas, they called themselves Mohegan, and controlled an area near the Thames River. Early Inhabitants\n\n8. Most of the Native Americans were generally friendly to the colonists. Some native groups invited the English to settle nearby, hoping for trade and for allies against the aggressive Pequots, who dominated the area. Settlers purchased land from the native people, and though whites often encroached on native territory, disputes were usually settled without violence.\n\n9. Connecticut is known as the constitution state and the name refers to the fundamental order of 1638 – 1639 . these fundamental represent the frame work for the first formal government written by the representative body in Connecticut after the fundamental orders Connecticut was granted governmental authority by king Charles II of England through the Connecticut charter of 1662. Separate brands of the government didn’t exist during the period and the general assembley acted as the supreme authority . In colony’s early years , the government could not serve Connecticut teams . thus , for 20 years the governorship often rotated between John Hayurs and Edward Hopkim both of them were from Hartford . George Wyllys , Thomas Wells and John Wesster are Harford men , sat in the governor chair for brief period in the 1640s and the 1650s . The fundamental orders Framed by Hooker, Ludlow, John Haynes, and others, the laws provided for a self- governing colony whose inhabitants were to owe their allegiance to the colony rather than to England\n\n10. Congregationalism was established by law as the official religion of the Connecticut and New Haven colonies when the colonies were founded in the 17th century. It remained the official religion until the 1818 constitution was adopted. The congregation of each church was its own governing body, and there was nearly complete independence of all outside ecclesiastical control."
