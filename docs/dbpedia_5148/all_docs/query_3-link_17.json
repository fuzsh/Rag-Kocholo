The first settlement by Europeans in Colonial Connecticut were made in 1633 by Dutch settlers on the site of present day Hartford. In the same year a trading post was established on the Connecticut river by settlers from the Plymouth Colony, A colonist called John Oldham (1600-1636) of Massachusetts explored the valley and his favorable reports led to the founding of Colonial Connecticut by Thomas Hooker in 1636. Thomas Hooker was a leading Puritan clergyman who grew dissatisfied with the rigid practices and government of the Puritan church in Massachusetts. He established the new colony with about 100 colonists who shared his views. Thomas Hooker inspired the \"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut,\" which was one of the first written democratic constitutions that established a representative government. This famous constitution was in force for 180 years. In 1662 Colonial Connecticut secured a royal charter from King Charles II. The charter included the New Haven Colony.\n\nPicture of Thomas Hooker\n\nNative American Indians and Conflicts in Colonial Connecticut\n\nThe Native American Indians of Connecticut included the Narragansett, Mohegan, Wampanoag, Nipmuck, Pocumtuck, Abenaki and Pequot.
