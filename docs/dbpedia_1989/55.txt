OVERVIEW:

Classic Trucks magazine was a re-titling of Truckin' Classic Trucks which was originally started by McMullen-Yee Publishing in Anaheim, California. This new title went to a monthly schedule and continued to focus on classic pickups and trucks from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The title change also occurred with new ownership by K-III Inc. (later Primedia) under its McMullen Argus Publishing Division.

Like all truck magazines, this title had featured vehicles, "how-to" technical tips and event coverage. For a short while there was a good focus on restoration tips and techniques. It was "tech" and trucks; no cheesy bikini-clad models. Nice and simple.

Steve Stillwell was the carryover editor for the first six months or so, followed by Daniel Sanchez through mid-1999. Matt Emery had a short stint for less than a year, then he was followed by Jim Rizzo wo took the editor role in mid-2000. Mr Rizzo reported to Brian Brennan, the editorial director.

Publication continued until 2020 when print production ceased.
