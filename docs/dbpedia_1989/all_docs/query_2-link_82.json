        "text": "1 year ago: Colorado’s 14ers expected to see fewer visitors in 2023\n\nA June 30 report by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative found the number of people climbing Colorado’s 14ers fell by 8% in 2022r to about 279,000 hiker-use days — the second-lowest level recorded since the initiative began keeping statistics in 2014. Lloyd F. Athearn, executive director for the initiative, said he expected the numbers may be lower in 2023.\n\n“We had a really snowy start to the season … a lot of places really didn’t start to open up until July. I think we’re going to see an even smaller hiking season in 2023 than we did in 2022,” said Athearn.\n\n— From the Aug. 4, 2023, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n5 years ago: Dillon looks at increasing age requirements, licensing restrictions for nicotine sales\n\nThe Dillon Town Council voted unanimously on Aug. 6, 2019, to increase from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase nicotine products along with implementing new licensing regulations for nicotine retailers in town. The ordinance, which will return to the council for a second reading and public hearing later this month, could represent the first domino to fall as towns across the county work to pass changes to their own regulations. If passed, the new ordinance would raise the minimum purchase age for all nicotine products and accessories to 21 — including everything from cigarettes and vaporizers to chewing tobacco and paraphernalia like rolling papers.\n\n— From the Aug. 8, 2019, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n10 years ago: Climax Molybdenum mine shows off new $200M water treatment facility\n\nBus after bus unloaded hundreds of people in hard hats and protective glasses who wanted a glimpse of the new wastewater treatment plant at the Climax Molybdenum mine on Thursday, Aug. 7, 2014. The $200 million water treatment plant started discharging into the Ten Mile Creek about 5 miles south of Copper Mountain on July 7, 2014. The plant was built to replace the former second stage of the mine’s water treatment system, a tailings pond now used to deposit leftover rock from mining operations that restarted in 2012 after a 17-year hiatus.\n\n— From the Aug. 8, 2014, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n15 years ago: Stimulus funds move projects on Green Mountain Reservoir\n\nA $1.475 million infusion of stimulus cash likely won’t change operations at Green Mountain Reservoir, but the federal dollars will help the U.S. Forest Service complete major projects at the popular recreation site. Rich Doak, recreation manager for the White River National Forest, said a centralized boat launching facility will be “at the top of the list.” He said he expects contracts to be issued quickly for the projects, thoughmost of the work will probably have to wait until summer 2010. One project he expects will be completed in 2009 is putting down gravel on some of the roads around the reservoir.\n\n— From the Aug. 4, 2009, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n30 years ago: Summit County seniors excited to continue enjoying free skiing at Copper Mountain\n\nSummit County seniors say they are pleased with Copper Mountain Resort’s decision to continue offering free skiing to those 70 and older, and they plan to ski there this winter. Copper Mountain officials announced in July they will continue to offer free skiing to seniors 70 and older as well as expand the Over the Hill Gang program at the resort. Earlier in 1994, Keystone and Breckenridge resorts said they would start to charge those 70 and older $15 a day to ski.\n\n— From the Aug. 10, 1994, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n30 years ago: Frisco enters into annexation agreement for 75-acre ‘triangle’ plot\n\nThe Town of Frisco officially entered into an annexation agreement with developer Todd Crowe Tuesday, after council members voted 4-2 in favor of proceeding with development of the 75-acre Triangle. Crowe’s plan calls for 162 primary residences and 18 optional accessory apartments to be built on 57 acres of the Triangle. Mayor Tex Elie and Councilmember Gay Elliott cast the two dissenting voles, saying they still do not feel comfortable with water rights provisions in the agreement.\n\n— From the Aug. 4, 1994, edition of the Summit Daily News\n\n125 years ago: Another Breckenridge child dies of whooping cough\n\nAfter a short and painful batter with whooping cough, Richard Mattheissen, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Alex. Mattheissen, was taken by the death angel on Aug. 5, 1899. Richard was particularly young, having been born on May 8, 1899. With Mr. Mattheissen being engaged in mining in South Dakota, some distance away from a telegraph office, the funeral service and interment was delayed until Aug. 9. A short sermon was given by Rec. C. M. Cooper and the little casket was laid to rest in Valley Brook Cemetery. Whooping cough has taken several Breckenridge children over the past few months.\n\n— From the Aug. 12, 1899, edition of the Summit County Journal"
