        "text": "FAIRBANKS, Alaska (KTVF) - Four police officers who were part of an officer-involved shooting at Milepost 255 of the Parks Highway last year will not face criminal charges in connection with the death of 45-year-old Fairbanks man Michael Grimes.\n\nAn Office of Special Prosecutions review determined that Alaska State Trooper Sergeant Aaron Mobley, Trooper Scott McAfee, Trooper Trevor Norris and North Slope Borough Police Department Officer John-Ashton Swope legally used deadly force against Grimes on Nov. 1, 2023.\n\nThe review also said that a self-inflicted wound led to Grimes’ death.\n\nThe incident took place during a planned traffic stop north of Healy.\n\nOfficers had been investigating Grimes for illegally possessing and selling narcotics. They had a search warrant prepared that authorized them to search Grimes’ Dodge Ram truck, according to the Office of Special Prosecutions, and had staged a scene to pull over Grimes as he drove from Anchorage to Fairbanks.\n\nA 12-page summary of the review says video from the scene shows that Grimes shot in Sergeant Mobley’s direction after Grimes had attempted to drive away from troopers between mileposts 251 and 255.\n\nThe summary says Grimes continued trying to evade officers, with shots appearing to originate from both Grimes’ truck and Trooper Norris’ vehicle.\n\nGrimes’ truck then reportedly came to a stop, and officers exited their vehicles.\n\nThe summary says when Grimes’ truck began moving again, the four officers fired shots at the drivers’ side.\n\nThe truck stopped again, according to the review. After commanding occupants to exit the vehicle, the passenger, referred to as M.P. in the letter, got out.\n\nOfficers detained M.P., the summary says, then approached the truck and found Grimes unresponsive, bleeding from his head, and with three empty pistol magazine pouches on his left side, among other weapon accessories.\n\nInvestigators with Alaska Bureau of Investigation later found two pistols inside the car.\n\nThe state medical examiner determined Grimes’ head injury and a corresponding mark in his ball cap lined up with a bullet recovered from the truck’s ceiling. The examiner said those circumstances were consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot and, after analyzing the wound, ruled suicide as the cause of death.\n\nIn interviews with investigators, officers described the scene and said they had feared for their own safety or that of their fellow officers.\n\n“The officers’ reports of the events during these interviews were consistent with what was captured by the in-car cameras,” the summary reads.\n\nInvestigators also interviewed M.P., who said that Grimes “just pulled out his gun and started shooting,” the review says.\n\nThe review concluded that officers reasonably believed that “their actions were necessary to defend themselves, other officers, or civilians against an imminent risk of serious physical harm and/or death was reasonable,” making criminal charges unwarranted.\n\nDownload the Newscenter Fairbanks apps today and stay informed with the latest news and weather alerts."
