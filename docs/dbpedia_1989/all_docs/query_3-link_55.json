        "text": "The practice of stocking fish by authorities to create fishing opportunities in North Dakota is more than a century old. Yet, it wasn’t until the early 1960s that the Game and Fish Department established its first fleet of fish distribution units.\n\nThe timing coincided with the establishment of Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery, with an understanding to also help with shipping fish out of the Valley City National Fish Hatchery. The tanks used to haul fish over the road were custom created around what was then called the “California design,” which was based on a shallow tank, with a quick exchange circulation system.\n\nIt quickly became evident that a 500-mile day with a pickup pulling a trailer was much less demanding than the same trip in a 2.5-ton truck. Plus, it eliminated the work of climbing on and off the bigger vehicle.\n\nAbout the same time, a large expansion was underway at Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery in the form of a new trout and salmon production building to address growing chinook salmon and community trout pond fisheries.\n\nIn addition, the Department funded the construction of an additional 40 acre-and-a-half cool-water ponds to increase production to adequately address larger systems in the state like Lake Sakakawea and Devils Lake.\n\nAnticipating increased production from an additional 40 hatchery ponds, plus the new trout and salmon building, Game and Fish developed a new fleet of four fiberglass transport tanks to replace the first generation aluminum tanks that were in service for 25 years.\n\nThese tanks had two additional 160-gallon compartments, for a total size of 800 gallons, but were still mounted on trailers and pulled by heavy duty pickups. With the modern fiberglass on wood construction, the new tanks could safely transport nearly one ton of catchable trout or about a half-million walleye fingerlings per trip.\n\nNew technologies also increased the number of waters a Game and Fish Department driver could stock, including GPS navigation to help auto-route a driver to the dozen or more lakes stocked daily. Also, real-time oxygen monitoring systems allow for maximum loading, while increasing the quality of stocked fish and greatly improving the potential for stocking success.\n\nWith the second generation fiberglass tanks starting to show signs of failure after shipping more than 190 million walleyes fingerlings over more than several hundred thousand miles, a third generation tank was designed and put into service in 2017.\n\nFish distribution in North Dakota the last 10 years has focused on the dramatic growth of fishing waters across the state, including about 50 new prairie walleye lakes. The annual output of fish raised at hatcheries and transported across the landscape increased to more than 12 million fingerlings.\n\nThe biggest shift, more than 9 million fingerlings per year, is seen in walleyes. Also, the average number of lakes stocked today in North Dakota is 220, which is a record.\n\nWhile the Department has upgraded equipment needed to transport fish to all corners of the state and continued its financial investment in hatchery infrastructure, enough can’t be said about staff at the two federal fish hatcheries in the state."
