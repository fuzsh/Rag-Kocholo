        "text": "EASTHAMPTON — Local Burger’s Easthampton location is gearing up to celebrate an exciting new expansion: the opening of Beveridges Cocktail Lounge.\n\nBeveridges is already open for business, but its grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 6 will celebrate the bar as a new evening scene for the Easthampton community, as well as the fun events coming to the venue in the near future.\n\n“The whole kind of point of a bar here was to pay homage to the original Eastworks owner — his name was Frank Stanley Beveridge,” said General Manager Tabitha Saalfrank. “We tried to embody the kind of 50s theme they had going.”\n\nThe bar will feature posters from Stanley Home Products magazines throughout the establishment to serve as reminders of the cosmetic and cleaning supply company’s place in the building’s history as the previous owner.\n\nThe new bar will not only provide a place to relax and enjoy a refreshing drink, but staff at Local Burger have plans to host events such as weekly Bingo nights and other gatherings that will bring community members together for some friendly competition. Saalfrank said the staff is hoping to provide a variety of prizes, including the potential grand prize of catering an event for with the Local Burger food truck.\n\n“We’re hoping we can create kind of a tournament vibe,” said Saalfrank, who noted that the staff is experimenting with the idea of tournament punch cards that qualify frequent players for game nights with bigger prizes like the food truck service.\n\nCurrently, the first bingo night is scheduled for Aug. 15, and will likely take place weekly from there.\n\nSaalfrank and her fellow Local Burger staff members have also been gratified by the professional development opportunities offered by the restaurant’s several expansions. In opening an Easthampton location in the old Riff’s Joint space in EastWorks, some seasoned staff members were able to take on leadership positions. With the opening of a new bar, Saalfrank said more of the staff can “explore avenues that they’re interested in” by becoming bartenders.\n\nLocal Burger now has locations in Northampton, Haydenville, Easthampton and the New Hampshire town of Keene.\n\nBeveridges Cocktail Lounge opens on weekdays at 4 p.m. and on weekends at noon. The ribbon cutting will take place on Tuesday, Aug. 6 at 5 p.m., followed by refreshments and ice cream from Ice Cream Emergency.\n\nWesthampton community aggregation hearing\n\nWESTHAMPTON — There will be a virtual hearing for Westhampton’s municipal aggregation plan on Monday.

Other municipalities in the region have adopted this type of program in an effort to provide stable, competitive energy pricing for their residents.\n\nThe hearing will take place over Zoom on Aug. 5 at 10 a.m. Those interested can join at the link https://us06web.zoom.us/j/88074281427 from a computer, smartphone, or tablet, or dial in to the number 312 626 6799 and enter the meeting ID number 880 7428 1427.
