        "text": "New York State Idling Law (6 NYCRR 217-3)\n\nLess idling time is good for the environment because it reduces air pollution and noise, improves fuel economy, and saves money for motor vehicle operators and consumers.\n\n6 NYCRR Subpart 217-3 prohibits on-road heavy-duty vehicles, including non-diesel and diesel trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 8,500 pounds (3,855.54 kg), from idling for more than five minutes at a time. The idling regulation is enforced by DEC Conservation Officers. Fines range from $500 to $18,000 in the case of a first violation.\n\nExceptions include, but are not limited to, when an idling on-road medium/heavy-duty vehicle is:\n\nStuck in traffic or otherwise required to remain motionless\n\nPerforming maintenance tasks or powering an auxiliary function or apparatus, such as a refrigeration unit or lift, requiring power from the primary motive engine\n\nA fire, police, public utility, or other vehicle providing emergency services in emergency situations\n\nA diesel-fueled truck remaining motionless for more than two hours while ambient air temperatures are below 25°F (-3.9°C)\n\nUndergoing a roadside diesel emissions inspection\n\nVisit DEC's \"You're the Key to Being Idle Free\" webpage for additional information and resources for idling in New York State.\n\nAdvanced Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation\n\nNew York State adopted California's Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation (6 NYCRR Subpart 218-4) in December 2021. More details of New York's adoption of the ACT regulation can be found in the adoption rulemaking package (PDF).\n\nManufacturer ZEV Targets (6 NYCRR 218-4.1)\n\nThe ACT regulation requires applicable medium- and heavy-duty vehicle (M/HDV) manufacturers to sell a percentage of their total sales in New York State as zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) starting in model year (MY) 2025 with increasing ZEV sales through MY 2035. Transit buses, motor coaches, and emergency vehicles are exempt from the ACT regulation. The ACT regulation does not require M/HDV fleets, owners, operators, or dealerships to purchase ZEVs, nor does it directly require dealerships to sell certain percentages of ZEVs or near sero-emission vehicles (NZEVs).\n\nThe ACT ZEV sales percentages for M/HDV manufacturers for New York State are as follows:\n\nModel Year\n\nClass 2b-3\n\nClass 4-8\n\nClass 7-8 Tractors\n\n2025\n\n7%\n\n11%\n\n7%\n\n2026\n\n10%\n\n13%\n\n10%\n\n2027\n\n15%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n2028\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n2029\n\n25%\n\n40%\n\n25%\n\n2030\n\n30%\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\n2031\n\n35%\n\n55%\n\n35%\n\n2032\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n2033\n\n45%\n\n65%\n\n40%\n\n2034\n\n50%\n\n70%\n\n40%\n\n2035 and subsequent\n\n55%\n\n75%\n\n40%\n\nACT provides M/HDV manufacturers with flexibilities to comply with the ZEV sales percentages. These include:\n\nUse of NZEV sales, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) counting towards compliance, with certain limitations\n\nUse of \"early action\" banked credits from ZEV and NZEV sales made prior to MY 2025. M/HDV manufacturers were able to begin generating credits with the 2022 MY\n\nPurchase of excess ZEV and NZEV credits from other M/HDV manufacturers\n\nThe ability to use credits across the three different weight class groups. However, only Class 7-8 Tractor credits can be used for compliance with the Class 7-8 Tractors sales percentages (apart from the low-volume tractor flexibility)\n\nThe ability to make up a deficit in the next model year\n\nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) has proposed amendments to the ACT regulation to allow additional flexibilities for M/HDV manufacturers. These include:\n\nExtending the deficit makeup period from one model year to three model years\n\nCrediting sales once they are \"delivered for sale\" rather than \"sold to the ultimate purchaser\"\n\nThe Department will evaluate any CARB amendments to the ACT regulation for adoption in New York State.\n\nThe Department encourages New York State based fleets to consider M/HD ZEV adoption. M/HD ZEVs are practical for many use cases and the total cost of ZEV ownership is reaching parity with internal combustion powered vehicles. New York State also offers incentives using Volkswagen Settlement funds for ZEV purchases through the following programs:\n\nNew York Truck Voucher Incentive Program\n\nNew York City Clean Trucks Program\n\nAdditional sources of funding for fleets, owners, and operators of M/HDVs to purchase ZEVs or to install charging infrastructure are available through the following sources:\n\nNew York School Bus Incentive Program\n\nNew York State M/HD Make-Ready Pilot Program\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency Clean School Bus Program\n\nFederal Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit\n\nNYSDEC Municipal ZEV EV Rebate Grant Program\n\nACT One-Time Fleet Reporting Requirement (6 NYCRR 218-4.2)\n\nThe second section of the ACT regulation (6 NYCRR 218-4.2) is a one-time reporting requirement for large entities that operate or dispatch on-road vehicles with a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 8,500 pounds in New York State. The one-time fleet reports were due to DEC from applicable fleets by the extended deadline of December 1, 2023.\n\nEntities required to complete and submit the report are those that:\n\nhad gross annual revenues greater than 50 million USD in the U.S. for the 2019 tax year, including revenues from all subsidiaries, divisions, or branches, and had one or more vehicles under common ownership or control that were operated in New York in 2019; OR\n\nwere a fleet owner in the 2019 calendar year that had 50 or more vehicles under common ownership or control; OR\n\nwere a broker or organization that dispatched 50 or more vehicles into or throughout New York in the 2019 calendar year; OR\n\nwere a New York government agency, including all State and local municipalities, public authorities, or municipal instrumentalities such as special districts with independent commissions or those formed by interstate compact that had one or more vehicles that were operated in New York in 2019; OR\n\nwere a federal government agency that had one or more vehicles that were operated in New York in 2019.\n\nReporting exemptions are provided for entities that primarily operate school buses and for certain vehicles, such as transit buses operated by public transit agencies, military tactical vehicles, vehicles awaiting sale, emergency vehicles, and light-duty vehicles dispatched but not owned by transportation network companies.\n\nBelow are current versions of the reporting template and guidance documentation as of June 10, 2024. Fleet owners are required to use these documents for official fleet reporting. All applicable entities must submit their completed reporting template to DEC by emailing it to [email protected].\n\nFinal Reporting Form (Excel) (revised June 10, 2024)\n\nFinal Guidance Document (PDF) (revised June 10, 2024)\n\nData collected through the ACT one-time fleet reporting requirement, to date, has been made accessible through Open Data NY (last updated: July 16, 2024). This dataset will be updated periodically to account for reports that are newly submitted or corrected.\n\nA summarized version of the ACT one-time fleet reporting dataset, which contains a subset of the Open Data NY dataset for New York State fleet locations, is available below.\n\nACT Dataset Summary (Excel) (revised June 5, 2024).\n\nNote that certain State and regional public authorities are also required to complete separate annual Part 248 reports for diesel vehicles. Information on this reporting can be found here.\n\nNew York State Clean Diesel Grant Program (NYSCDGP)\n\nThe goal of the NYS Clean Diesel Grant Program (NYSCDGP) is to improve local air quality by reducing harmful diesel exhaust emissions. These harmful diesel exhaust emissions come from:\n\nolder trucks\n\nlocomotives\n\nmarine vessels\n\nother diesel-powered equipment\n\nNYSCDGP has received funding through the federal Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA) since 2008. DERA funds provide opportunities and incentives to public and private entities with eligible projects. Authority for DERA grant funding comes from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. NYSCDGP projects have reduced emissions across the State, including Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) and Potential Environmental Justice Area (PEJA) neighborhoods. DEC continues to work on DERA-funded projects to assist in meeting the State's air quality goals. A detailed summary of these projects is available as a downloadable PDF.\n\nProjects\n\nPart 248 Annual Reporting Requirements and Waivers (6 NYCRR 248)\n\nPlease send completed forms to [email protected]. Prime contractors should send their reports to their associated regulated entity, who will in turn provide it to DEC.\n\nEntities seeking information on the Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) One-Time Fleet Reporting requirements (6 NYCRR 218-4.2) instead of Part 248 annual reporting can find these requirements above.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nThe annual reporting period for 6 NYCRR Part 248 is from October 1 to September 30. Calendar Year 2024 reporting should reflect the period of October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. All Annual Report and Vehicle Inventory forms must be received by November 1, 2024.\n\nEntities required to submit annual Part 248 reports include:\n\nAll State-level government agencies\n\nState and regional public authorities and their affiliates and subsidiaries\n\nPrime contractors that contract directly with the above regulated entities to perform regulated entity work and who are responsible for the completion of the contract with the regulated entity\n\nRegulated entities and prime contractors must report all their on- and off-road heavy-duty diesel-powered vehicles (HDDVs) (including those exempt from best available retrofit technology (BART) requirements) on both the Annual Report and Vehicle Inventory forms. Prime contractors working for State agencies or public authorities should report to those agencies only those HDDVs operated on behalf of the State during the subject reporting period (including HDDVs exempt from BART requirements) on both the Annual Report and Vehicle Inventory forms. For the proposes of the Part 248, HDDVs are on- and off-road diesel-powered vehicles with a GVWR of more than 8,500 pounds.\n\nThe \"Total Quantity (Gallons) of ULSD Fuel Used in Past Year\" row of the Annual Report form should represent the total quantity of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for a State agency or public authority's fleet, both light-duty and heavy duty. Prime contractors only need to report the quantity of ULSD used while performing work on behalf of State agencies or public authorities during the reporting period.\n\nLow Usage Waivers from BART Requirements\n\nOn-road HDDVs operated less than 1,000 miles per year and off-road HDDVs operated less than 100 hours per year may be eligible for a BART low usage waiver. Low usage HDDVs are often used for short periods of time that may not allow engine exhaust temperatures to reach levels that allow the retrofit technologies to operate effectively. Examples of low usage HDDVs include trucks used for road construction signage, water storage, and other HDDVs that stay motionless at a job site for long periods of time. The BART low usage waiver is based, in part, on the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus Regulation Low-Use Vehicle Exemption.\n\nRegulated entities (State agencies and authorities) and prime contractors may submit an Application for Waiver of BART (PDF) based on low usage. If HDDVs meet the low usage criteria, there is no need to check the compatibility of the engine with the EPA or CARB for an acceptable emission control device.\n\nA BART waiver based on low usage must be requested every year and include odometer and hour meter documentation from the beginning of a specific one-year reporting period. State agencies and authorities must submit a DMV inspection report or a State vehicle fleet maintenance record that includes miles/hours documentation with a low usage waiver request. Prime contractors must attach a DMV inspection report or third-party maintenance record that includes mileage/hours documentation for each low usage waiver request. If an on-road vehicle's odometer or an off-road vehicle's hours meter is not functioning, the HDDV is not eligible for a BART waiver based on low usage.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, all on-road and off-road HDDVs operated by regulated entities must be Part 248 compliant. Low usage waivers should be applied for as soon as possible to avoid non-compliant HDDVs operating on behalf of the State in violation of Part 248 regulations. If approved, the low usage waiver becomes effective on the date the waiver is approved and expires one year from that date. For example, a low usage waiver with an approval date of January 15, 2024, expires one year later on January 15, 2025.\n\nRegulated entities seeking a low usage BART waiver are limited to HDDVs that operate less than 1,000 miles for on-road HDDVs and 100 hours for off-road HDDVs per year, even if a portion of the annual operational usage is outside of the State or if the vehicle is only operating on behalf of the State part of the time. Additionally, the 1,000 mile for on-road HDDVs and 100 hour for off-road HDDVs limitations includes miles driven or operated between and at work locations. If an HDDV that has received an approved BART waiver based on low usage goes beyond the low use mileage/hour limit threshold during the one-year waiver period, the BART waiver based on low usage in no longer valid and the HDDV must be brought into immediate Part 248 compliance."
