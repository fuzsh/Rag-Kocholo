Contact Schulte at dschulte@natso.com or (915) 526-5820 to learn more about the costs and details of this service.\n\nWhen Silver’s Travel Center rebranded its c-store location by franchising with On The Run by Circle K, it brought a new atmosphere to the store and led to a 15 percent increase in sales.\n\nAs part of the rebranding, the location underwent architectural changes and repositioned the point-of-sale. The store has a more open feel now that makes shoppers notice products more than they have in the past.\n\nSilver’s offers a variety of hot foods and cold foods, all single serve. The location has also placed different grab-and-go items around the counter because that appeals to a different customer base.\n\nTheir grab-and-go food program is supported by a robust coffee, iced tea and fountain program.\n\nRon Hicks, General Manager of Silver’s Travel Center, Henderson Travel Center and Frog City Travel Plaza, said the remodel hasn’t taken away sales in other areas of the location and has created a boost in local traffic.\n\nI noticed during my visit that all of the employees and customers seem happier since the remodel. The changes have added so much to the overall atmosphere of the store, adding to its overall success.\n\nYou can read more about Silver’s Travel Center in the November/December 2016 NATSO Stop Watch Magazine.\n\n/// Did you know most weeks you can find me visiting a NATSO member truckstop location, spending three to four days, using my merchandising and operations expertise to help them grow their business? I periodically share about those great retailers I visit here on the blog. Read more Truckstop Travels here.\n\nPhoto Credit: Darren Schulte/NATSO"
