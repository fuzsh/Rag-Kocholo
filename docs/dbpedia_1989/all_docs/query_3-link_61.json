        "text": "In the early 20th century, the automotive industry was just getting its footing. Ideas and technologies circulated the world, and in 1903, William Randolph Hearst–inspired by motoring magazines in Europe–launched a monthly newsletter containing automobile information from America and Europe. The newsletter, titled simply, “MoToR,” was so well received that it was converted into a full-fledged magazine that dealt with the contemporary issues and concerns of owning motorized vehicles. But just how did a monthly newsletter-turned-magazine evolve into one of the world’s leading automotive data suppliers?\n\nBy 1924, MoToR Magazine had changed. The pages that once were filled with stories and news targeting vehicle owners had become known as “the automotive business paper,” focusing on manufacturing, selling and servicing automobiles. This new focus of the magazine led to a wealth of reader responses, debating whether to charge by the hour or instead use a “flat rate” for repair service. As a result, the first MoToR’s Master Manual was published in 1930; today, this manual lives on as the MOTOR Labor Time Guide.\n\nThe company continued in its new endeavors into manuals with its 1937 debut of its first Factory Shop Manual, a 448-page guide that brought together all the most important repair data found in every shop manual produced since 1930. The company continued to evolve, responding to the current needs in the industry. By the middle of the century, one of these needs was a separate manual for collision shops; MOTOR quickly recognized the necessity of this, and, in 1954, released the first MOTOR Body Shop Flat Rates and Parts Manual. With the industry demands becoming increasingly more geared toward automotive data, in 1961, MOTOR Magazine officially changed its focus to the topics found in present-day issues–the aftermarket and independent repair facilities.\n\nThough MOTOR’s early data offerings centered around domestic vehicles, by 1965, that had changed, and the company began including foreign brands in its Flat Rates & Parts Manuals. This continually increasing focus on data led to MOTOR establishing their data licensing business in 1985, servicing the aftermarket with up-to-date automotive information. Gradually, the offerings expanded, and throughout the next several decades, MOTOR acquired significant assets and premiered numerous data products and services:\n\n1997: Acquires Chilton assets, including inventories of books and copyrights to all publications of labor guides.\n\n1999: Acquires Chek-Cart, positioning MOTOR as the dominant data provider of the quick lube industry–today, 95% of this industry relies on MOTOR data.\n\n2005: Launches e-Tech online, a subscription service offering access to heavy truck data. Since this time, e-Tech has expanded to include seven different modules.\n\n2005: Introduces Vehicle Information Library, consolidating MOTOR’s service and repair data.\n\n2006: Acquires light-duty parts database Technologue, providing MOTOR with a light-duty parts database.\n\n2007: Acquires FleetCross, an online database of repair and parts information for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.\n\n2009: Releases heavy-duty parts licensing via web services.\n\n2012: Releases heavy-duty labor licensing via web services.\n\n2015: Releases light-duty licensing via web services.\n\nThe past 115 years have seen an extraordinary growth in the automotive world. From its start as a monthly publication to its present-day position as one of the premier data suppliers, MOTOR has worked to meet the needs of its readers, customers and the industry as a whole."
