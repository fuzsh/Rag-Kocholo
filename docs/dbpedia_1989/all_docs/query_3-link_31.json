        "text": "TURNING WHEELS - Lee Fisher\n\nTURNING WHEELS\n\nLegend Nominee: Lee Fisher\n\nThey say the best adventures are shared with the ones you love. This Legend article features an over the road trucker whose life-long passion is to drive a truck, as his wife embodies the spirit of a traveling gypsy. Perfectly paired, I was able to catch up with the duo to discuss what works best for them in finding balance as a couple on the road. Each share tips on how they manage to eat healthy and stay active in a lifestyle where most of their time is spent inside of a semitruck moving from state to state. We cover an array of topics, such as, more preferred areas they tend to favor and a new-found desire to explore different cultures of food. Aside from the journey itself, one of the primary goals this couple shares are the intention of bringing awareness to their fast and growing outreach, Missing Truck Driver Alert Network.\n\n20-year veteran driver, Lee Fisher of Wheat Ridge, Colorado is a company driver for Transport Designs, Inc.; a dry freight carrier based out of Burnsville, Minnesota. Driving a big rig is the only job Lee claims would suffice his personality. “I could never see myself working in a cubical or office environment. None of that is for me. I’ve always just wanted to drive something somewhere. Plus, my wife loves seeing new places, so the trucking lifestyle is perfect for us.”\n\nKari Fisher, a traveling enthusiast with a passion for photography, is more than trucker’s wife. She established Missing Truck Driver Alert Network in 2012, with hopes of helping a mutual friend find their loved one. Using the power of social media, Kari posted the missing person’s photograph on Facebook. As the circulation expanded, she realized they had tapped into an undiscovered tool that could provide a nationwide search effort to help find and rescue missing truck drivers, similar to an amber alert. 200 cases of missing loved ones have been reported through Missing Truck Driver Alert Network, over the last 6 years.\n\nLee drives a 2015 Cascadia, with their fishing poles on-hand and a grill strapped to the cat walk. Kari assists with navigating and paperwork, stating her weaknesses are Lee’s strong points and vise versa, which ultimately strengthens their relationship in business and for leisure. Kari says, “We find cooking to be a helpful stress reliever. We try to eat healthy; in this line of work, eating clean is just as important as staying active. It’s extremely hard when you’re stuck in a moving truck for the most part, so we try our best to take advantage of our options that we can control, such as food.” Also, being a history buff, on Kari’s list of places to revisit are Virginia and Philadelphia; they both enjoy taking time away from the truck and exploring cities of interest together.\n\nBeing able to travel the country with her best friend, Kari describes as a lifetime adventure, one she never wants to end. Stating, the trucking industry has provided Lee an opportunity to support them through an economy that benefits all walks of life. Adding how Lee strives to be a perfectionist in everything he does and that ambition to succeed pushes him to perform his duties as a professional and to the best of his ability.\n\nPatience, passion and determination are a few of the positive qualities that Lee represents. With over 2-million lifetime miles under his belt, Lee is considered a mentor among his trucking community for his experience in the business. He never turns down the chance to offer advice when called upon or lend an extra hand if he sees an opportunity to help another. Originally from the State of Washington, Lee’s stepfather, Ray Westlake introduced him to trucks at an early age. As young as nine years old, the two rode together across Montana pulling a dry van of boxed flyers. They swapped the paper ads for wheat and transported them to Idaho. Their large household included a total of eight children, Lee being the youngest, he enjoyed those road trips and learned a lot about himself each venture out.\n\nGrowing up around trucks made a huge impression on Lee, years later his career choice was clear. At 18, Lee enlisted into the Marine Corp with the intent to serve our nation and drive. And so he did, in any and everything he could possibly train to operate. He was active duty for eight years, serving deployments overseas during the Gulf War in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, then twice to Okinawa.\n\nIn 1994, for Lee the transition back to a civilian lifestyle was fairly smooth, remaining along the same line of business -transportation services- he landed a driving position for Waste Management in Denver, Colorado. Lee dedicated 15 years to the Waste Industry as a residential driver and laborer. His work ethic also mirrored his military background. “I did everything for Waste Management. I was taught in Marine Corps, get in and get the job done,” he said. Discipline and loyalty go hand in hand in the military; once a Marine, always a Marine. Lee’s work ethic represents that brotherhood and his upbringing as a second-generation trucker.\n\nAlthough he contributed the same mindset and effort in his duties, the noncombative environment was obviously different, as he pointed out receiving orders per say, compared to given instructions on-sight came with some adjustment. Saying, “I remember thinking, people are asking me to do something, versus giving orders… this will take some time to get used to after serving in the military and working in a certain manner, the professionalism is similar, but in a different light.” How he operated as a driver, despite the change in scenery, his safety precautions never altered, starting with: paying attention to his surroundings at all times.\n\nThe one statement that stuck with Lee through military training and truck driving school, reiterated by his last instructor is that during any time of the day, if a driver is not driving properly in a truck that driver is putting his or her life at risk, along with other potential innocent victims. Which explains his response when I asked what he considers to be his biggest accomplishment based on his career thus far.\n\n“Driving trucks, from my time in the military, to pulling reefer and RGN trailers, and now dry van, just the principle of making it from point A to point B in a safely and timely manner is a huge achievement. I personally choose that difficult parking space that another driver probably wants to avoid, simply because I like to challenge myself. Knowing that I can maneuver a tractor trailer carefully without harming anyone is a skill that I take pride in, as any professional driver should.”\n\nLee left the Waste industry and went to work for a trucking company transporting groceries. In 2007, while on a delivery he met Kari at a local convenience store, the two later married in 2009. Kari has since joined her husband on the road and is considering getting her CDL to run team. Coming into the business as a passenger in the seat of a semi, Kari touches on a few of the issues that she wasn’t aware of as a driver, hoping to give more attention for other drivers like her to better understand truckers and the challenges they face when on the road…\n\nKari expresses her concerns that the image of our industry is misunderstood. First and for most, truckers are more than what they do. There are thousands of men and women in the trucking industry, throughout the entire country that truly care for our nation and express that devotion through participation with various organizations. Many truck drivers volunteer as mentors for our younger generation, as demonstrated through programs such as, Trucker Buddy International. Hundreds are affiliated with a non-profit organization, Truckers Against Trafficking; a nationwide organization committed to the effort of recognizing signs of human trafficking through training and awareness.\n\nLee has worked as a volunteer serving food for Truckers United for Charities in years past, all proceeds were donated to children’s hospitals within the charity’s area of the given event. Though the non-profit organization no longer serves food, the couple helped raise money working their Truckers United booth during the Mid-America Trucking Show, last year. In 2012, the Fisher’s joined the international association dedicated to professional truckers and small fleets; Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA). They also became members of Women in Trucking (WIT), in 2015.\n\nShe continues with sharing her first impression of the business on the road once she settled in. “Of all the years spent driving my personal vehicle, I was never aware of the blind spot that truck drivers have to deal with. It’s scary! I know that as professional drivers they are trained to see us whether there is a car in that blind spot or not, but scary for people who have no idea that there is such a place. I think all drivers need to be educated on how to help keep our roads safe when driving with these large-sized trucks nearby,” Kari said.\n\nAlso, the couple believes that the focus on truckers’ health and fitness tends to be left out of any major discussion involving imminent issues. Due to the stationary lifestyle of the job, the Fisher’s take comfort in parking at rest areas or any other locations that provide a nice space to get out and stretch. Seizing the opportunity to enjoy their walks in the evening, they both agree is a great way to unwind after a long ride. A Facebook page known as, Big Truck Health and Fitness Group was created by Kari, along with co-administrator, Darlene Ventura to offer support and motivation for men and women in the trucking industry looking to live a healthier life on the road.\n\nThe leniency and freedom that Transport Design, Inc. offers their drivers is the exact type of company that best fits Lee’s individuality. Stating, “The biggest part for me personally is that here with Transport Design, I’m not harassed or being micromanaged. I know how to do my job and they trust me to do it. They give me the freedom to run how I want. It’s the independence they give, but at the same time, provide the support to do well and not smothering me in the process. It’s an equal balance that can dictate one’s longevity with a company.” For drivers in search of a company to plant roots with too, Lee’s advice is to research all places of interest before committing and then once onboard, don’t be easily persuaded to believe the grass is greener on the other side. Assuring that companies will have their share of ups and downs, transitions and changes, in which most, if not all adjustment periods will leave their drivers with no option to include an opinion. That’s when Lee says to buckle in and just do your job; enjoy the bigger picture. Drive.\n\nAs for military veterans considering a career the trucking industry, he explains that the need for their strong work ethic is in high demand, the open space for self-determination is available, and fulfillment of providing a service among their peers is attainable.\n\nWith a place in Colorado, not often lived in, Lee and Kari choose to take their lives out on the road for months at a time. Along for the journey are their furry companions, two dogs and a 12-year-old cat. Batman is the oldest of the three, Chester (9) and Missy (4) are both Shih Tzus. As long as Lee keeps the wheels turning, Kari and their band of four-legged friendlies will continue to explore the country, hoping to shine a light on all things positive within trucking."
