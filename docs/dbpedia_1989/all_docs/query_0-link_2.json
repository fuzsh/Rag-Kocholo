        "text": "Fisheries Research Highlights\n\nFisheries research is the foundation of smarter, more efficient and effective fisheries management. The DNR’s Fisheries Research Program focuses on evaluating existing fisheries management practices, innovating new techniques, and advancing the science and technology used to improve fishing in Iowa’s lakes, rivers, and ponds. This focus helps the Fisheries Bureau ensure that fishing license dollars are spent wisely and as efficiently as possible.\n\nDNR’s Fisheries Research Program accomplishes all this with a relatively small group of highly skilled fisheries scientists. Seven research stations are located across the state. Each has a particular field of investigation. Five teams focus on fisheries in a specific Iowa water resource: natural lakes, reservoirs, small impoundments, interior streams, and the Mississippi River. The other two teams improve fish culture practices used in DNR fish hatcheries and investigate new ways to use technology to get information and data from fisheries managers to Iowa anglers.\n\nStream habitat is a key factor influencing the health of stream fish populations. Iowa’s river and stream fish resources have been greatly impacted by habitat degradation. Concerned with the continued degradation of river and stream habitats and fisheries, Iowa resource managers are interested in using stream rehabilitation practices to effectively improve these resources. This study began in 2010 to evaluate Iowa river and stream rehabilitation practices, and develop management guidelines to improve river and stream habitat, as well as fishing opportunities for Iowa anglers.\n\nThe first project being evaluated is the modification of the Vernon Springs Dam on the Turkey River at Cresco. The dam was converted into a series of rock arch rapids in late July 2010 to address safety and fish passage concerns. Pre-construction fish community and habitat sampling was done at three sites above the dam and two sites below. Over 3,900 game and non-game fish were marked below the dam to monitor fish movement over the new structure. Fish community and habitat sampling was also done at three sites on the Volga River to serve as control sites for the three upstream sites on the Turkey River. Post-construction sampling upstream of the project found 16 Black Redhorse, 11 Golden Redhorse, 3 Walleye, and 1 Northern Hog Sucker that moved upstream over the structure. Smallmouth Bass and Black Redhorse were sampled post-construction above the dam at sites on the Turkey River and N. Branch Turkey River where they were not found pre-construction.\n\nPre-project fish and habitat data were collected in 2012 and 2013 for a dam removal on the Shell Rock River in Rockford. The dam was removed in the winter of 2014 and four years of post-project sampling have been completed. Golden Redhorse and Northern Hog Sucker were collected for the first time at sites above the dam in 2014, and increasing numbers of these species were found upstream in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021.\n\nChannel Catfish numbers also increased at sites above the former dam. The project has restored riverine habitat in the former impoundment and improved the fish community (increased number of species, adult Channel Catfish abundance, and Smallmouth Bass abundance). Habitat conditions in the former impoundment are similar to the downstream site and the upstream control site in terms of stream width, mean depth, mean water velocity, and substrate composition. Dam removal negatively impacted downstream habitat initially, but habitat conditions largely recovered within 3-4 years post removal.\n\nA whitewater park and habitat improvement project was completed in spring 2015 at the site of the Marion Street Dam on the Maquoketa River in Manchester. Pre-project fish and habitat sampling was done at sites upstream and downstream of the dam in 2012-2014. Over 19,600 fish of 19 species were marked downstream of the dam to monitor fish movement over the new structures. Sampling in 2015-2021 found 826 marked fish representing 12 species that had moved upstream over the structures. Continued monitoring of these projects and investigations of additional stream rehabilitation projects will help guide future decisions and lead to improved methods, designs, and sharing of resources to improve Iowa’s river and stream fisheries.\n\nFood consumption advisories are more common now than 10 or 20 years ago. People are more aware of what they put into their bodies and what can be harmful. Most people have heard about mercury, and usually associate it with marine fish species. This pollutant can also be found in freshwater fish species in Iowa and may affect the at-risk population of people consuming these species. Children under 12 years old and women that might become pregnant, are pregnant, or breastfeeding should be aware of fish consumption advisories.\n\nIowa DNR promotes eating fish and studies show fish should be part of a healthy diet. Iowa anglers consumed an estimated 4.59 million meals of Iowa caught fish in 2018. Currently fish consumption advisories are issued on a lake by lake basis. A small portion of lakes and rivers in Iowa are sampled each year and results are used to post consumption advisories about how many meals a week anglers should eat from the specific waterbody.\n\nIn 2012, a more robust sampling schedule was set as part of a study to look at mercury contamination in fish found in Iowa. The goal was to sample a variety of lakes and rivers with all of the fish species in question and provide statewide advisories if needed. This study provided more information about mercury contamination in Iowa and itnalso generated more questions to answer before simple and easy to follow statewide advisories can be implemented.\n\nThe study found mercury contamination is higher in predator species like largemouth bass, flathead catfish, and muskie. Lower trophic level fish that eat mostly plankton and invertebrates, such as bluegill and perch, have little or no accumulated mercury and are safe to eat.\n\nThe goal of the new study started in 2019 was to sample 20 fish species from lakes and rivers. The sampling schedule was designed to collect 2,400 fish in three years. Targeted lengths were selected based on results from the earlier study. So far, 1,612 tissue samples have been collected from lakes and rivers. The additional samples collected in this follow up study will provide Iowa anglers with safe fish consumption recommendations for at-risk populatons.\n\nAdvancements in technology, specifically Global Information Systems (GIS), have provided new tools and methods to measure sediment accumulation in Iowa lake basins. All of Iowa’s significant public owned lakes (SPOLs) were surveyed between 2006 and 2016 to measure lake depth at a known elevation or lake level. Contour maps, similar to topographic maps, were created and provided for several user groups working and recreating on Iowa lakes. Engineers, management biologists, and anglers are some of the users that request the available depth data found on the Iowa DNR website. The known elevation is a bench mark allowing multiple surveys to be compared over time to compare apples to apples and measure accumulated sediment in lake basins.\n\nSurveys completed in 2012 can be compared with more recent surveys to calculate accumulated sediment in lake basins. Why is this important? Accumulated sediment can negatively affect water quality, change fish composition and size structure, and increase vegetation growth that have negative effects on recreational activities.\n\nDuring the last five years, 35 lakes have been surveyed for a second time. The initial surveys were completed about 10 years ago. We found sediment accumulation in these lakes to be between .35 percent and .64 percent each year. This means a 100 acre lake with a volume of 700 ac-ft can gain between 430 and 650 dump truck loads of soil each year depending on the size of its watershed and land use types. The accuracy of these sediment accumulation values is between 4 percent and 6 percent based on our results from this study. After this study is finalized, we will evaluate models used to estimate accumulated sediments and help improve longevity of restoration projects and benefit anglers.\n\nIowa’s Community Fishing Program started in 2016 to increase angling participation and opportunities within Iowa’s larger cities. New initiatives in Iowa, such as the Community Fishing Program, aim to bridge the gap between natural resources and urban populations and increase angler participation. Over 200 ponds can be found in these populated areas ranging in size from 0.5 to 232 acres, all of which are located within 38 communities. Several ponds are added to this list each year as new developments are constructed. Managing all of these systems for fishing requires a different set of tools than traditional methods used for rural ponds.\n\nDuring 2022, we collected trip information about anglers using urban ponds. Urban ponds were located in business parks, near schools, incorporated into parks with amenities, and part of neighborhoods. Preliminary analysis showed more fish were released than harvested, meaning people just wanted to catch fish to have a successful trip. The majority of angling in neighborhood ponds was by kids less than 16 years old. The average trip length was shorter in these community fisheries compared to rural ponds, urban lakes were between .7 and 1.1 hours. Many of these urban ponds are in backyards or only a short walk away from homes, therefore short trips would be expected. Angling effort can also be up to 10 times higher in urban ponds compared to rural locations. Urban ponds were similar to rural ponds regarding sport fish quality ranging from poor to excellent.\n\nEven though sport fish population collections are similar between rural and urban locations, fish sampling gear types may need to be changed. Some pond basins in urban locations were built as water control structures and didn’t consider angler access. Next year the Small Impoundment research team will collect additional data and provide managers with the appropriate tools to provide urban anglers with quality experiences.\n\nIn a recent survey, 76 percent of Iowa anglers rated the Iowa DNR as excellent or good in managing fishing and fisheries in Iowa. Fisheries managers need up-to-date information on fish populations to maintain this high level of angler satisfaction.\n\nIn the early 2000’s, the Iowa DNR collected bluegill age and growth information statewide from Significant Public Owned Lakes (SPOLs). Since then, a statewide bluegill bag limit was established and numerous fisheries were renovated through the Iowa DNR’s Lake Restoration Program. Bluegill age-growth information was collected sporadically during this period, primarily for special projects; but, a similar statewide assessment has not been completed for almost 20 years. This information is needed to evaluate the many management actions during this period.\n\nBluegill populations were surveyed in 23 lakes in the fall between 2020 and 2022. Age structures were collected from approximately 1,725 fish between 3- and 10-inches. These fish were also weighed, measured for length, and sex was determined for mature individuals. Results show males grow slightly faster than females, and the maximum age collected to date for this study is 11 years with the majority reaching 8 years. Length-at-age data also suggested a difference in fish size from northern latitude to southern latitude, fish were larger in southern impoundments than northern climate impoundments.\n\nLakes sampled in the next two years will add to these results and assist management biologists in making science based decisions for managing bluegill in Iowa.\n\nBluegill are a popular sport fish in Iowa with 58 percent of anglers indicating they fished for bluegill in a 2019 survey. Bluegill are found in most Iowa impoundments and are usually part of the first stocking in new or renovated lakes and ponds. When the Iowa DNR restocks bluegill after a lake renovation, the goal is for 8-inch bluegill to be available to anglers within four years after restocking.\n\nThis goal is achieved in some cases when water quality is improved, but there are exceptions. When these exceptions occur and are not explainable, fisheries managers question if the broodstock source might be a contributing factor. Bluegill stocking rates have been reduced in recent years to keep the initial year-class following a renovation from getting overabundant before the first year-class of largemouth bass can be established. If this initial bluegill stocking is supplemented from another source (e.g., fish escaping from ponds in the watershed or illegal stockings), it may result in density dependent growth that prevents bluegill from achieving the desired growth rate. Some bluegill sources may have genetics that lend themselves to faster growth.\n\nDuring the 2020, 2021 and 2022 sampling seasons, bluegill genetic samples were collected from fin clips.These fish were collected from multiple lakes representing five different bluegill populations and progeny from two fish hatcheries. Results showed bluegill populations were different between the three lakes. There is also evidence that certain genes may contribute to growth. Additional testing will be conducted to confirm these results.\n\nInformation from this study will be used to guide future bluegill restocking efforts following lake renovations. The ultimate goal for bluegill fisheries after renovation is to provide anglers with desirable-sized fish as soon as possible after a fishery renovation.\n\nWalleye are a popular sport fish in Iowa, ranking in the top two most fished for species. Walleye can be caught in lakes, interior rivers, and large rivers. Walleye are stocked into lakes as fry, fingerling, and advanced fingerling sizes to maintain quality populations across the state in lakes and rivers. Advanced fingerling fish are the largest of the three sizes ranging between 6-inches and 12-inches long and cost more to raise than the other two sizes of fish. When these fish are stocked, it is important to see them survive and grow so anglers have an opportunity to catch them or they become part of the broodstock population in Iowa lakes.\n\nNew fish rearing methods have been developed with the nationwide spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS), such as zebra mussels. These invasive species can cause significant damage to native ecosystems and infrastructure. Fish hatcheries can combat AIS species by switching from a flow-through system to using a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). This type of system uses clean water free of AIS species which reduces hatchery costs and problems associated with hauling fish to stock in lakes.\n\nRathbun Fish Hatchery, located in Southern Iowa, can raise walleye in a RAS from egg to advanced fingerling size and avoid AIS problems, but these fish have not been evaluated after stocking into a lake to see if their survival is similar to advanced fingerling walleye raised in a traditional flow-through system. In 2021, walleye were implanted with radio tags to monitor survival over 8 months. Results showed walleye reared in a RAS had similar survival rates to walleye reared in a flow-through system. This radio telemetry project also showed RAS fish moved greater distances between tracking events.\n\nIn 2019, 2020, and 2021 three different advanced fingerling walleye products were stocked into lakes in October and then sampled in 2020, 2021, and 2022 to evaluate how each product survived after stocking. Sampling results in 2020 and 2021 for age-1 fish were dominated with fish grown in a flow-through system. Walleye reared in a RAS and collected in 2022 at age-1 were sampled at a significantly higher number than in 2020 and 2021. Sampling results for age-2 Walleye were dominated by fish grown in a flow-through system and RAS fish were sampled in low numbers. These results suggest a quality RAS product can survive in lakes and more work is still needed to improve our understanding about the contribution of RAS reared Walleyes in Iowa lakes.\n\nEffective disease management and treatment at Iowa fish hatcheries is essential in raising quality fish for Iowa fisheries. Diseases can lead to fish mortality and reduce growth rates. In 2006, the Iowa DNR initiated a new project to dedicate more attention to obtaining approved hatchery drugs. Efforts will focus on improving prevention and management of Ich, a commonly occurring disease effecting our walleye production.\n\nThe Rathbun Fish Hatchery uses raw lake water that has not been disinfected in the tanks used to grow-out walleye. Since the water has not been disinfected, Ich infestations are common. Preventative treatments with formalin were used in the past to manage infestations. Formalin treatments are very effective, but increase the cost of walleye production. Beginning in 2009, research was conducted in production tanks to evaluate the reduced use of preventative treatment and the impact on Ich infection and the amount of formalin applied. A nine-hour formalin treatment every other day when Ich is first detected at less than 15 Ich cells per arch then daily treatments when more than 15 cells are detected is the most effective and economical treatment plan tested.\n\nIn 2014 a continuous 24-hour formalin treatment at 30 to 40 ppm was compared to the standard treatment tested in 2009. When 15 or more Ich cells were detected, continuous treatment began and continued until fish were resampled 4 to 7 days later and no Ich cells were observed. This treatment plan eliminated Ich infestations in seven days or less and compared to the standard treatment that was applied for two or more weeks. However, the final cost and amount of formalin applied between treatment plans was similar.\n\nThis research established a monitoring and treatment system used by hatchery staff to apply formalin judiciously resulting in cost savings and production of healthy fish. This study continues to garner knowledge to help hatchery staff reduce the cost of producing large walleye fingerlings.\n\nCurrently, all of Iowa’s large walleye are produced in a tandem pond to tank culture method where fry are stocked in ponds and grown on natural prey items, then converted to dry feed and grown to eight inches. Raising fry on dry feeds in tanks without first starting in a pond has been evaluated at the Rathbun Fish Culture Research Facility; however, the success of these techniques needed to be tested in production-scale tanks. Culture methods and tank designs may need changes before hatchery staff use this technology.\n\nIn 2016, we compared phase I fry production in 275-L tanks using Mississippi River brood stock sources and fed fry pelleted feed at 5-minute and 10-minute intervals until 38 days after hatch. All tanks of fry, regardless of strain, had ongoing deaths from cannibalism, either attempted or successful, because feed rates did not meet the appetite of fast growing fry. River source fry fed at 5-minute intervals survived at a rate of 53.8% while fry fed at 10-minute intervals had a 64.0% survival rate. This difference in survival was significant. The final size of fry was similar at 40 mm and 0.60 g. All river source fry were freeze branded to identify them in a comparison of pond rearing and tank rearing walleye fingerlings as part of another fisheries research study.\n\nThe training of pond fingerlings to eat commercial feed had been a challenge to production of eight-inch fingerlings until 2006. However, in the past five years hatchery staff observed poor survival during the feed training time which was believed to be from an unknown change in the Walleye Grower 9206 diet. In 2016, we compared survival and growth of pond-reared walleye trained to eat Otohime feed and then converted to WG 9206, BioVita, BioPro2, or Gemma Silk feeds. Fish fed BioVita had a survival rate of 76% while fish fed the other diets had a survival rate of 60.2% to 76.3%, but the difference was not significant. Final length of fish fed BioPro2 and BioVita was much greater than that of fish fed Walleye Grower 9206 and Gemma Silk.\n\nDiets and tank shape were compared in a growout study in the research facility. All fish were graded for uniformity before phase III tank stocking. Three round tanks and rectangular tanks were fed BioOregon diets (BioOlympic followed by BioTrout) and three round tanks and rectangular tanks were fed WG 9206. Death rate was much lower in rectangular tanks (2.4%) compared to round tanks (10.0 to 12.2%). Death was caused by Columnaris disease that infected eroded caudal fins of fish in round tanks. Caudal fin condition was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 with three being an intact tail with lower scores progressively more eroded. The lowest caudal fin score at the end of the study was in round tanks fed the BioOregon diets. Death due to caudal fin erosion was not seen in raceways. Fish fed WG 9206 in round tanks were significantly longer and heavier than fish in the other tank shape and diet combinations. More research is needed to determine the dietary link to higher rates of caudal fin erosion in walleye.\n\nIowa DNR staff gets hybrid striped bass fry from other states to improve fisheries and culture methods to offer Iowa anglers more opportunities. However, the supply of fry is limited and raising pond fingerlings has been inconsistent and below expectations. This study will examine concerns of moving fry and fish production techniques to develop a management plan to raise hybrid striped bass in plastic-lined (Rathbun Fish Culture Research Facility) and earthen (Mt. Ayr Fish Hatchery) ponds. The plan will include best management practices for: 1) moving fry, 2) timing of first stocking, 3) recommended stocking densities, 4) pond fertilization treatments, and 5) water quality management. In 2016, current best management practices were compared in earthen ponds at the Mt Ayr Hatchery. Production performance of Sunshine Bass fed once daily by hand or four times daily by feeder was compared in plastic-lined ponds at Rathbun Fish Culture Research Facility (Rathbun) with similar best management practices.\n\nSunshine bass fry were stocked at a rate of 140,000 fry/acre at Rathbun. Ponds 1, 4, and 5 at Mt Ayr were stocked on 10 May with Sunshine Bass from Keo Fish Farms at a rate of 248,306 fry/acre counted by volumetric method. An error in fry estimates in the stocking barrel resulted in those ponds being stocked with 77% more fry than the standard 140,000 fry/acre stocking rate. Ponds 2 and 3 were stocked on May 11 with Palmetto Bass fry at a rate of 144,927 fry/acre. A mixed fertilization treatment of alfalfa and soybean meal was used to increase pond productivity throughout the culture period in ponds that were not fed fish feed. In ponds that were fed fish feed, fertilization was stopped after day 14 when feeding began.\n\nSurvival rate at the Mt Ayr Hatchery was excellent with one pond having a survival rate of 29% and the other four ponds with survival rates between 42% and 95%. Feeding ponds at Mount Ayr resulted in larger fish size compared to ponds that were only fertilized. The higher stocking rate of ponds resulted in 889,331 fingerlings harvested, the highest hybrid striped bass fingerling production to date at the Mt Ayr Hatchery.\n\nHarvest at Rathbun was delayed to allow for a 35-day period of offering pelleted feeds so that any trend in growth or survival between feeding methods would become apparent. Feeding rates were increased from the initial feeding rate of 8 lbs/acre to 16 lbs/acre during the last week of feeding. Survival ranged from 40.7% to 58.0% among all ponds. Ponds fed by hand had a survival rate of 57.1% while those ponds of fish fed by automatic feeder had 47.3% survival which was not a significant statistical difference. Mean length was similar between feeding methods but the variation in length was significantly greater for ponds of fish fed by automatic feeder four times daily compared to ponds of fish fed once daily by hand. This finding suggests that fish size varies more which leads to cannibalism and reduced production with four daily feedings using an automatic feeder.\n\nProduction plans for 2017 include evaluating the best management practices at the Mt Ayr Fish Hatchery with pond feeding to increase fish size. Rathbun Fish Culture Research staff will evaluate the relationship of feeding methods and fish performance to produce a better product for stocking into Iowa’s fisheries.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources produces over 200,000, 6 to 9-inch walleyes each year intensively on formulated diets at the Rathbun Fish Hatchery (RFH) or Spirit Lake Fish Hatchery. Both hatcheries use surface water sources to produce these fish in culture systems that only use water once before being discharged. The surface water sources may carry viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens which can cause fish deaths. Additionally, surface water sources for both hatcheries are threatened by aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels. Disinfection systems to stop the spread of pathogens could be expensive using current culture systems. Though surface water sources at both hatcheries are plentiful, water quality and the presence of undesirable organisms are challenges to fish production. One fish pathogen, Ichthyophthirius multifilis, costs $25,000 to $35,000 each year to control during walleye growout at RFH.\n\nOne solution to these problems may be use of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology which uses a small amount of makeup water to replace water lost during waste processing. When compared to our traditional culture systems, which replaces 100% of its tank water every one to two hours, the RAS may replace only 5 to 10% of its water each day. To continually reuse water while raising fish at high densities requires special components to remove waste products. These components are: 1) self-cleaning circular fish tanks; 2) microscreen filter for solids removal; 3) water pumps; 4) biofilter for ammonia and nitrite removal; 5) CO2 stripping column; 6) oxygen and ozone contactor; and 7) ultraviolet disinfection unit for reduction of bacterial counts.\n\nThe use of RAS for sport fish production is a new trend among state agencies. Egg incubation to food size fish production in RAS has been well documented for many food fish species like trout and salmon. However, few studies have evaluated RAS for walleye production. A pilot-scale RAS was built at the Rathbun Fish Culture Research Facility in 2014-15 with the goal of testing walleye and other sport-fish production in this technology. Fish performance, system performance, and economics information gained will help the IDNR develop these systems for production scale use.\n\nIn July 2016, feed trained walleye fingerlings were stocked into three culture tanks in the RAS to test grow-out performance to the nine-inch fall fingerling size. After four weeks in the system, the caudal fins of some walleye became eroded and those fish later died. Fish samples were sent for diagnosis and a Flavobacterium species of bacteria was found on the caudal fin. The condition of caudal fins was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 with three being a complete tail with lower scores reflecting increasingly worse conditions of tail erosion. At the end of the study, 38% of walleye had a score of 3 and 62% had a score of 0 to 2. Final survival rate was 78% and fish were 8.1 inches long and shorter than fish produced at RFH because of the disease issue. Future research should evaluate disease treatments to stop bacterial fin erosion (e.g. hydrogen peroxide).\n\nWalleye fingerling growout occupied the RAS for about three months, leaving enough time to disinfect the system, repopulate the biofilter, and restock the system with cold-water species to culture overwinter. Walleye were harvested in October, the system was disinfected, and rainbow trout were restocked in December. The RAS was restocked with eight-inch rainbow trout from Manchester Fish Hatchery that were grown to a catchable size (11 inches) and stocked into urban fisheries in Ottumwa and Davenport, Iowa.\n\nThis project will determine how many fish can be produced in a RAS during summer and winter production seasons, using species that grow better at summer and winter temperatures that reduce the need to heat or cool water out of season. In the end, a more efficient production system will be developed to enhance fisheries for Iowa anglers.\n\nWalleye and sauger support popular and important fisheries on the Upper Mississippi River bordering Iowa. Walleye continually rank high in angler catch and harvest in summer pool wide and winter tailwater angler surveys. Saugers are the majority of fish caught and harvested at tailwaters fisheries from October – March. This study was started because of concerns with high sauger death rates, highly variable reproduction in Walleye, and the desire to maintain and improve these important fisheries.\n\nConcerns with deep water post-release hooking deaths of Sauger led to a study completed in 2012. Sauger were caught from the tailwaters of Guttenberg and Bellevue and held in a deep-water net pen to measure 72-hour death rates. Overall, hooking deaths was 18%, but rates increased with depth. Death rates were 7% for Sauger caught from depths of 20-29 feet, 17% from 30-39 feet, 25% from 40-49 feet, and 41% from 50 feet or greater. Sauger length was also found to be inversely proportional to depth. Larger Sauger were caught on average at shallower depths than small Sauger. Tailwater anglers can use this information to decide where they should fish. Fishing in deep water yields small Sauger; a large proportion of released fish will likely die. Fishing in shallower water yields larger fish and a greater proportion of released fish will survive.\n\nWalleye reproduction on the Upper Mississippi River is highly variable with boom and bust years. Increasing and stabilizing reproduction would improve the consistency of the fishery. Seventy percent of Walleye eggs come from 20-27 inch fish. Protecting this size class to increase the number of eggs in the system may improve future reproduction. In 2004, a 20-27 inch release slot limit was started from Lock and Dam 11 in Dubuque to the Missouri border. Evaluation of the Walleye slot limit has shown an increase of 20-27 inch Walleyes in pools where the regulation is in effect (Pool 13) versus pools without the regulation (Pool 11). While proportional stock density (% fish > 10” that are > 15”) was high at both Pools 11 and 13 (78 and 90 respectively), the percent of Walleye over 20 inches was only 15 in Pool 11 compared to 44 in Pool 13.\n\nNight electrofishing is done each October in the tailwaters of Pools 11 and 13 to measure Walleye and Sauger year class strength. High water levels have not allowed us to effectively sample the past few years. Surveys in 2016 showed weak Walleye and Sauger year classes at Bellevue (Pool 13) and Guttenberg (Pool 11); high water levels during sampling likely negatively affected catch rates. There are good numbers of 14-inch and larger Sauger available, so anglers should have good success in the tailwaters this winter and spring. The slot limit regulation appears to have been highly successful so far, yet future work on this project will continue to measure the effects of the slot limit on Walleye reproduction.\n\nFish telemetry has provided proof that the availability of overwintering habitat is a limiting factor for Centrarchid (e.g., Bluegill, Crappie and Largemouth Bass) populations in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). Centrarchids traveled long distances (> 3 miles) to reach suitable overwintering backwater areas with low current speeds, water depth > 1 m, water temperatures 1-3° C warmer than the main channel, and adequate dissolved oxygen levels. Lock and dam construction in the 1930’s greatly increased the total aquatic area of the UMR and provided deep backwater areas favorable to Centrarchid populations; but, sediment deposition in backwaters has reduced the quantity of deep-water lentic habitats. As the post-impoundment UMR ages and backwater sedimentation continues, abundance of Centrarchids will likely decline unless management actions are taken.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources works collaboratively as part of the partnership of state and federal agencies that make up the Upper Mississippi River Restoration - Environmental Management Program. Many Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Projects (HREP) are designed to increase sportfish populations important to Iowa anglers. Multiple HREPs have specifically focused on mitigating effects of backwater sedimentation through sediment dredging, restoration of aquatic connections between backwater and channel areas, and installing control structures that let oxygen-rich channel water enter into backwaters areas during periods of low dissolved oxygen. Research has documented positive effects of HREPs on Centrarchid populations in backwater habitat and identified habitat variables (e.g., dissolved oxygen, velocity, and depth) critical to Centrarchids.\n\nDespite our understanding of the benefits of overwintering HREPs, many questions remain. For example, we do not know how many or at what interval overwintering areas are needed in a pool to keep Centrarchid populations healthy. Information is lacking on the best size of an overwintering backwater and the “sphere of influence” for an individual overwintering backwater (i.e., area of the pool inhabited by fish from an individual overwintering backwater during the rest of the year).\n\nBy better understanding overwintering requirements of Centrarchids, we can ensure enough winter refugia is available to sustain a viable sunfish and bass fishery. There is also much to learn from studying newly constructed HREPs to ensure project features function as designed. While backwater restoration has received much attention on many projects, other habitat restoration techniques such as island construction, side-channel restoration, and bankline stabilization present future study opportunities as well. Evaluation of different HREPs and restoration features will provide information on which techniques are most beneficial to riverine sport fish populations.\n\nThis study, started in 2014, will help us gain a greater understanding of these questions and lead to improved efficiency and success of future overwintering habitat project design and placement.\n\nYellow Perch provide important and popular sport fisheries across their range. Yellow Perch in South Dakota are listed as the second most popular sportfish in the state, with several lakes in North Dakota and South Dakota receiving national attention for their recreational Yellow Perch fishing.\n\nYellow Perch have been documented in creel surveys within the Upper Mississippi River, ranking anywhere from the 7th to 9th most popular sportfish. It was also reported that Yellow Perch were only a minor constituent of the ice fishing catch from several backwaters in Pools 9 and 10; but, based on the Long Term Resource Monitoring Element’s annual sampling from 1993-2018, Yellow Perch populations have increased for the past 10 years in Pools, 4, 9, and 13. Yellow Perch have become an important sportfish in some locations of the Upper Mississippi River, including within multiple completed Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Projects (HREP). According to the most recent survey of Iowa anglers, Yellow Perch were the 3rd most popular panfish species, behind only Crappie and Bluegill; yet, only 8% of respondents said they had fished for Yellow Perch in Iowa in the past 12 months.\n\nHistorically, Yellow Perch fishing in the Upper Mississippi River in Iowa was only a minor component of those fisheries. Latent demand for Yellow Perch fishing in Iowa and recent population increases in the Upper Mississippi River may have created an opportunity for fisheries managers. But, despite understanding that this is a popular sportfish across its range and has the potential for increases in popularity on the Upper Mississippi River, there is limited information available on Yellow Perch in the Upper Mississippi River.\n\nThe objective of this project is to evaluate telemetry methodology and seasonal habitat use of Yellow Perch in the Upper Mississippi River. The findings from this research study could help with the development of more diverse HREPs, provide greater habitat diversity, and expand Yellow Perch fishing opportunities for anglers.\n\nIowa’s muskellunge stocking program started in 1960 when 40 fingerlings were stocked in two natural lakes. The goal was to help anglers catch trophy-sized fish without leaving Iowa. There was some early opposition to stocking a large predator, like muskellunge, into Iowa’s natural lakes. This was particularly true when other fish populations like yellow perch or walleye were in decline, even though muskellunge were not responsible for those downturns.\n\nManagers quickly learned that for successful muskellunge management in Iowa, specific population density targets needed to be established and that other important population parameters, such as growth and mortality rates, must be monitored closely. Low population density targets were set to allow for trophy growth potential and satisfy most anglers’ concerns of muskellunge and other sport fish species interactions.\n\nThe number of natural lakes stocked grew as the popularity of the program grew. currently, muskellunge are managed in Clear Lake, Black Hawk Lake, North Twin Lake, Spirit Lake, East Okoboji Lake and West Okoboji Lake. Since muskellunge are a long-lived species, even slight changes in death or emigration rates can substantially influence population density and size structure. Muskellunge population densities are closely monitored in these lakes by inserting tags into each fish stocked or captured during broodstock spring gillnetting and then using computer models to estimate adult population abundance from individual fish capture histories. With this information, managers can adjust stocking densities or evaluate the effects of various length-limit regulations to keep population densities within the objectives set for each lake.\n\nMuskellunge provide an important fishery to Iowa, but they must be managed in a way that is sustainable and beneficial to all sport fish populations and users. Monitoring muskellunge population densities each year is essential to ensure muskellunge fisheries in Iowa’s natural lakes stay consistent with management objectives. Yearly assessments combined with adaptive management allow managers to adjust stocking rates as needed to properly manage muskellunge in multi-species fisheries.\n\nNatural reproduction of walleye in Iowa’s natural lakes is very limited. Annual stockings of fry and fingerlings are needed to sustain these fisheries. Consistent survival of stocked fry and fingerling walleye is key to increase walleye numbers in many of Iowa’s natural lakes. These lakes often have high walleye harvest deaths, so stocking alone would not produce the walleye numbers needed to meet management goals. A combination of improved stocking survival and proper harvest regulations is needed to increase walleye populations. Since hatchery costs are dependent on the size of fish produced, most research in Iowa has focused on evaluating the survival of fall stocked walleye fingerlings. Several years of research examining age-0 and age-1 walleye electrofishing catch rates and population numbers concluded that large (>7 inches) walleye fingerlings are needed to meet adult walleye population goals.\n\nIn addition to stocking survival, managers also use harvest regulations to improve adult walleye abundance, size structure, and growth rates. In 2007, a protected slot limit of 17-22 inches (1 fish over 22 inches, daily bag of 3 fish) was implemented on the Iowa Great Lakes and Storm Lake. The minimum length limit of 14 inches was kept on Clear Lake. Angler surveys each year and spring broodstock gillnetting provide information about walleye numbers, walleye size structure and growth rates, as well as walleye harvest and release rates before and after the regulation change.\n\nThe protected slot limit has provided more consistent numbers of adult walleye in the Iowa Great Lakes and Storm Lake since the regulation change. The regulation change has experienced periods of high adult male walleye abundance within the protected slot that provide little benefit to anglers or broodstock production. In 2020, a study that evaluated the current 17-22 inch protected slot found that although this regulation was working, other combinations of protected slot limits could be used that allow harvest of slow growing adult males, yet maintain ever valuable populations of female walleye broodstock.\n\nThis study found that special regulations, such as protected slot limits, may improve the walleye fishery at Clear Lake. Based off these findings, in January of 2021, a protected slot limit of 19-25 inches (1 fish over 25 inches, daily bag of 3 fish) will be implemented on the Iowa Great Lakes and Storm Lake. At Clear Lake, the walleye regulation will change from a minimum length limit of 14 inches to a protected slot limit of 17-22 inches (1 fish over 22 inches, daily bag of 3 fish).\n\nFurther research monitoring broodstock densities, life history features of the broodstock populations, stocking success with creel surveys, mark and recapture tagging, and age and growth analysis is needed to understand the impacts of harvest regulations and stocking strategy changes. Findings from this research will guide walleye management decisions and strategies for Iowa’s natural lakes.\n\niowa’s muskellunge program was started in 1960 by stocking 40 fingerling muskellunge each into West Okoboji Lake and Clear Lake. Since those first stockings, muskellunge culture and management have advanced considerably thanks to nearly continuous stocking evaluations. These evaluations found that stocking muskellunge yearlings in the spring greatly improved adult population densities. By 2013, survival of spring-stocked yearling muskellunge was found to be extremely variable and resulted in declines in adult muskellunge densities in some lakes. Other factors, such as hauling stress, stocking technique, initial size at stocking, body condition, or physical deformities, were identified that may influence yearling survival. The focus of this study was to evaluate those factors and try to maximize yearling muskellunge survival in Spirit Lake and the Okoboji lakes.\n\nUnderstanding the individual factors that influence yearling muskellunge survival is necessary to effectively manage these fisheries. All yearling muskellunge stocked into the Iowa Great Lakes have been tagged before stocking since 2011 to identify factors such as total length or condition that may contribute to increased or reduced survival. In addition to tagging all stocked fish, a subset of yearling muskellunge stocked into Spirit Lake in 2016 and 2017 were tagged with radio transmitters to help estimate post-stocking survival and to determine if different stocking techniques were responsible for increased or decreased survival rates.\n\nResults from two years of tracking in Spirit Lake found that yearling muskellunge survival to 100 days was 50-65 percent and was related to size at the time of stocking, with larger fish surviving at a higher rate. Using this information, yearling muskellunge stocked in 2018-2020 were required to be at least 13 inches before stocking in May. Those that were less than 13 inches were held for an additional 30 day grow-out period to try to improve their size. On average, the grow-out period resulted in about a 1-inch larger fish at time of stocking in late June. A subsample of grow-out fish were implanted with telemetry tags and their movements and survival rates were recorded for 100 days. In 2018 and 2019, survival rates of grow-out yearling muskellunge was ≥75.0 percent. In 2020, the survival rate decreased to 50 percent, primarily from increased predation by great blue herons and fish predators.\n\nCollectively, we found that the grow-out period improved yearling muskellunge survival by at least 30 percent each year. In 2021, all yearlings stocked in Spirit and the Okoboji lakes were stocked using the grow-out technique. Finding the most efficient stocking strategies for Iowa’s lakes reduce production costs and provide desired muskellunge populations that meet the needs of anglers and hatchery production.\n\nRecent research has found that movement of walleye and muskellunge among the Iowa Great Lakes (chain of six natural lakes in northwest Iowa) can be substantial. Movement of these species in connected lakes is not uncommon, but can result in population imbalances within a connected lake chain or direct loss of fish into connected rivers. For successful individual management of these lakes, it is important to understand the extent to which populations of each species move among and out of lakes. If movement is significant, managers may be able to reduce loss by installing fish barriers at outlet connections or use other adaptive management techniques to counteract population imbalances. Recent research found that a pulsed direct current barrier was successful in deflecting walleye from a controlled, simulated barrier experiment. However, no information exists on how effective a barrier of this type would be for muskellunge or the effectiveness for either species in a field experiment.\n\nSince walleye and muskellunge are top-level predators and take several years to reach maturity, immediate losses of large quantities of fish through a spillway or outlet structure may have devastating long-term effects for that fishery. Specifically, these population imbalances and declines have been most prevalent in the Iowa Great Lakes muskellunge fishery, but periods of walleye escapement have also been observed.\n\nThis study will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of a low-pulse electric barrier to reduce both walleye and muskellunge loss into Milford Creek. One component of this evaluation includes recapturing fish within the river and using tag information to determine the approximate timing of movement over the barrier. Another component of this study is to use acoustic telemetry to determine long-term (> 4 years) movements and escapement of individual muskellunge that are fitted with acoustic tags. Field experiments will be conducted to evauluate individual fish response to different electric barrier settings to mazimize barrier effectiveness. Ultimately, this study with provide movement information that will be critical to determine the long-term effectiveness of such a barrier.\n\nIn a recent survey assessing Iowa anglers’ fishing preferences and behaviors, largemouth bass tied bluegill as the most-fished species in Iowa and bass (largemouth and smallmouth bass combined) tied walleye as the single species they most often fish for. This same study identified that monitoring fisheries populations is important to Iowa anglers.\n\nRelatively little is known about bass population dynamics across Iowa’s natural lakes. Iowa’s standard comprehensive survey sampling protocols for natural lakes seldom yield catch rates sufficient enough to collect the number of bass needed to estimate population parameters. In Iowa’s natural lakes, targeted bass population assessments are uncommon since bass are typically not stocked in natural lakes and are managed more as a function to manage water quality and habitat. Managers still desire information about bass populations so that trends in population abundance, size-structure, growth, and mortality can be examined and compared.\n\nTargeted night electrofishing during the spring typically provides the best index of bass density and size structure. For this study, natural lakes were inventoried using historical data to determine if bass populations were previously detected. Eighteen natural lakes were identified as having past bass populations. In 2019-2020, bass populations in these natural lakes were sampled capturing a total of 1,557 largemouth bass and 86 smallmouth bass. Highest catch rates occurred at Black Hawk Lake and the largest fish (20.7-inch largemouth bass) was captured from West Okoboji Lake. Dorsal spines were collected from a subsample of fish to determine age-and-growth characteristics and death rates each year for each lake.\n\nStarting in 2021, less frequent (once every five years) and more intense (at least 75 bass sampled) sampling of bass populations will occur in natural lakes to evaluate population characteristics and determine if management options can be implemented that may improve bass populations in Iowa’s natural lakes.\n\nYellow bass are an invasive species to Iowa’s natural lakes. Once established, yellow bass are difficult to manage due to their high reproductive levels and ability to adapt to lake environments. In some lakes, yellow bass can become so abundant that their population “stunts” and fish never reach sizes acceptable to anglers. In addition to being unusable to anglers, stunted yellow bass populations often lead to other problems within the fishery that become difficult to overcome with traditional management practices.\n\nLake Cornelia, a small relatively deep natural lake in Wright County, has historically been a popular destination for panfish and walleye angling. Yellow bass were first discovered in Lake Cornelia in 2006. By 2017, adult yellow bass catch rates were among the highest observed for natural lakes in Iowa and their growth was among the poorest. Declines in walleye, yellow perch, and crappie age-0 catch were also observed following the explosion of yellow bass. The stunting of yellow bass caused devastating effects that cascaded to the entire Lake Cornelia fishery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a yellow bass biomass reduction approach that includes: stocking adult predators, protecting adult predators with harvest regulations, and chemical or physical removal.\n\nUnfortunately, yellow bass have expanded their range to include many natural lakes in Iowa, as well as lakes in southern Minnesota. Lakes of glacial origin are extremely sensitive to ecological invaders and it is relatively unknown how these fisheries will respond to introductions of yellow bass and potential stunting of these populations. Exploring practical management techniques that can be used in deeper, natural lakes to control unwanted species will be of increasing importance as these populations expand.\n\nIt has been well documented that the simple introduction of a predator species to control unwanted prey or sport fish has inconsistent results. Designing and evaluating a hybrid approach to control stunted yellow bass populations could substantially improve natural lake fisheries for Iowa anglers."
