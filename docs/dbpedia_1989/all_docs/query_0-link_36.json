However, the interplay between these phenomena, particularly within the logistics sector, remains an underexplored area. This study investigates the complex dynamics between logistics intelligentization and decarbonization across 29 provinces in China from 2006 to 2019, providing a fresh perspective on a globally relevant issue. By employing Differential GMM, Systematic GMM, and instrumental variable-based GMM models, we evaluate the impact of logistics intelligence on carbon emissions while effectively addressing endogeneity issues inherent in the empirical analysis. Our findings reveal that the advancement of intelligent logistics correlates positively with increased carbon emissions, highlighting a significant incompatibility between decarbonization objectives and intelligentization efforts within the logistics sector. Additionally, we identify mediating pathways—specifically scale, structure, and technology effects—and moderating mechanisms that influence this relationship. These insights underscore the need for policymakers to establish environmental standards for intelligent technology adoption and to promote initiatives that reconcile intelligentization with sustainability goals. Ultimately, our study provides critical guidance for promoting sustainable and smart industrial growth in the logistics sector.

Generally, a time-varying magnetic field produces the required heat in the workpiece with a specially designed coil. The efficiency of the heating process depends highly on the coil design and the geometrical arrangement. A detailed and accurate finite element analysis of the induction heating process usually needs to resolve a coupled thermoelastic–magnetic problem, whose parameters values depend on the solution of another field. The paper deals with a shrink-fitting process design problem: a gear should be assembled with an axe. The interesting part of this case study is given the prescribed low limits for critical stress, the temperature of the gear material, and the heat-treated wearing surfaces. A coupled finite-element-based model and a genetic algorithm-based parameter determination methodology were presented. A thermal imaging-based measurement validated the presented numerical model and parameter determination task. The results show that the proposed methodology can be used to calibrate and validate the numerical model and optimize an induction heating process..

These processes are always accompanied by odor emissions, which are treated as pollution according to European legislation and are subject to legal regulations in many countries. Therefore, this publication presents the results of a study on the removal of odor from sewage sludge by adsorption on biochars produced from selected biowaste. Beekeeping waste (grain) and coffee brewing residues (spent coffee grounds) were selected for the study. Both materials were pyrolyzed to produce biochar which was applied for adsorption of odors from sewage sludge. Commercial Organosorb 200-1 Wi activated carbon was used as a comparison material. The odors were taken from dried sewage sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The obtained biochars are suitable for odor adsorption and can be an alternative to commercial adsorbents. The biochar from beekeeping waste showed the highest efficiency, allowing 100% odor removal. Slightly worse results were obtained for biochar from spent coffee grounds.

In a direct expansion system, R404A is the primary refrigerant and R744, a brine, is the secondary fluid. While there are abundant studies analyzing the theoretical performance of IRS, experimental research on IRS is lacking, and there are no papers that address the results of changes in the IHX in detail. In this study, the results achieved by modifying various parameters are experimentally evaluated to provide fundamental data for designing the optimal IRS. In the main results, looking at the trend of the increase in IHX efficiency, the change is very minimal when the efficiency is above 50%, so it is ideal to apply an IHX efficiency of about 50% considering economics and COP, etc. Applying the results in this study enables the operation and maintenance of IRSs as an eco-friendly system by achieving energy efficiency through optimizing the system coefficient of performance and securing economic feasibility by minimizing the R404A charging amount of the refrigeration cycle. To serve supermarkets and hypermarkets, R744 as a secondary fluid may help to realize an ecologically friendly, compact IRS system with a high heat transfer coefficient that can operate at low temperatures (−35 to 5 °C).

Biodiesel has the advantages of renewability, environmental friendliness, and good fuel properties, demonstrating broad application prospects. However, the use of biodiesel also faces some challenges, such as higher density and kinematic viscosity, lower calorific value, etc. The application of nanoparticles in biodiesel engines helps to achieve the goal of clean fuel. In terms of fuel characteristics, nanoparticles increase the calorific value, cetane value, and flash point of the fuel, improving combustion efficiency and safety, but increasing density may affect combustion. The use of nanoparticles can promote micro explosions and secondary atomization of fuel, improve combustion characteristics, and increase cylinder pressure, heat release rate, and brake thermal efficiency while reducing fuel consumption. Nanoparticles reduce HC and CO emissions, improve combustion through higher oxygen and reaction area, and reduce incomplete combustion products. On the contrary, nanoparticles also increase CO2 emissions because better combustion conditions promote oxidation reactions. For NOX emissions, some nanoparticles lower the combustion temperature to reduce emissions, while others increase emissions. Comparison shows that all nanoparticles offer varying degrees of improvement in engine performance and emissions, but the improvement provided by TiO2 nanoparticles is significantly better than that of other nanoparticles. In the future, the synergistic effect of multiple nanoparticles should be explored to further improve performance and reduce emissions, achieving effects that cannot be achieved by a single nanoparticle.

It covers both the technological aspects, such as proprietary electronics, and the overall architecture of the system for managing human and fixed assets. Its origins lie in the ever-increasing degree of automation in the management of company processes and the energy optimization associated with reducing the execution time of tasks in an intelligent building supported by in-building navigation. The positioning and tracking of objects in the presented system was realized using ultra-wideband radio tag technology. An exceptional focus has been placed on reducing the energy requirements of the components in order to maximize battery runtime, generate savings in terms of more efficient management of other energy consumers in the building and increase the equipment’s overall lifespan.

This study introduces a novel approach by employing two-dimensional numerical analysis through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to investigate the performance of VAWTs under varying turbulence intensity conditions, a topic that has been relatively unexplored in existing research. The analysis focuses on the self-starting capabilities and the effective utilization of wind energy, which are key factors in urban wind turbine deployment. The results reveal that while the impact of increased turbulence intensity on the self-starting performance of VAWTs is modest, there is a significant improvement in wind energy utilization within a specific turbulence range, leading to an average power increase of 1.41%. This phenomenon is attributed to the more complex flow field induced by heightened turbulence intensity, which delays the onset of dynamic stall through non-uniform aerodynamic excitation of the blade boundary layer. Additionally, the inherent interaction among VAWTs contributes to enhanced turbine output power. However, this study also highlights the trade-off between increased power and the potential for significant fatigue issues in the turbine rotor. These findings provide new insights into the optimal deployment of VAWTs in urban environments, offering practical recommendations for maximizing energy efficiency while mitigating fatigue-related risks.

The method considers the effects of wind and wave action when considering fouling and ageing. The ship resistance in calm, wave, and wind conditions has been defined using standard operating models, which have also been used to estimate the required engine power, service speed, fuel consumption, generated CO2, CII, and subsequent maintenance costs. The maintenance takes into consideration the effects of profit loss because of lost opportunities and efficiency over time. Any maintenance choice has total costs associated with it, including extra fuel, upkeep, and missed opportunities. Using a discrete-time Markov chain, the ship’s propulsion system maintenance schedule is optimized. A decision has been reached regarding the specific maintenance measures to be undertaken for each state of the Markov chain among various alternatives. The choice of optimal maintenance is related to a Markov decision process and is made by considering both the current and future costs. The developed method can forecast the propulsion system’s future states and any required maintenance activities.

Among the willow species, Salix pet-susu Kimura KKD (known as ezonokinu willow, EW) stands out for its growth, high production, storage stability, production stability, and business stability. Previous studies have investigated fuel characterisation through gasification (co-gasification) of various biomass mixtures to enhance feedstock flexibility for gasifier commercialisation. However, the synergistic effects of co-gasification using fuels containing EW blended with Japanese cedar, a commonly planted forest species in Japan, remain unexplored. Therefore, this study explored CO2 co-gasification with different blend ratios of EW/cedar blended char and evaluated the fuel characteristics for each blend ratio to elucidate the synergistic effects. The prepared char samples were utilised in the CO2 gasification test with TG-DTA as the analyser. The results suggest that in the initial stages of the willow/cedar blended char co-gasification reaction, pore size and specific surface area significantly influence the reaction rate. Subsequent stages of the reaction are influenced by the promoting and inhibiting effects of inorganic components, which impact co-gasification. The synergy factor results for the willow/cedar blended char co-gasification suggest a reaction pathway.

A proposed solution is to convert dissipated energy from human motion into electricity using piezoelectric materials. This study investigates lead–zirconate–titanate (PZT) piezoelectric materials in bimorph configuration, conducts performance tests to understand their characteristics and determine the optimal load resistance, and develops an energy-harvesting prototype. Performance tests adjusted input parameters and varied load resistance and input magnitude to optimize power gained from the PZT bimorph. A suitable human movement for the application of the bimorph is a mouse-clicking motion by fingers. A prototype was created by integrating the bimorph into a computer mouse to capture energy from clicks. The results showed that the deformation rate of the PZTs, input magnitude, and resistance load were key factors in optimization. The bimorph configuration produced 0.34 mW of power and 5.5 V at an optimum load of 5072 Ω, requiring less effort to generate electricity. For the computer mouse energy harvester case, it yielded a total average power of approximately 38.4 μW per click with a click frequency of 4 Hz. This power could be used to support IoT devices such as human sensors (e.g., CO2, temperature, and pulse sensors) and smart home sensors, enabling comprehensive health and environmental monitoring. In conclusion, input specifications, magnitude, and load resistance are essential for optimizing piezoelectric energy harvesters.

In a PV grid-connected system featuring controllable nonlinear loads, the interplay among PV grid-connected inverters, the loads, and the grid can potentially lead to voltage oscillations. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces an optimization-based method for suppressing oscillations, which carefully balances system stability with response performance. Firstly, an impedance model of the system is established by applying the harmonic linearization method, and system stability is analyzed using the “logarithmic frequency stability criterion”. Subsequently, impedance relative sensitivity is used to identify key parameters that affect system stability, and the interaction between key parameters is considered to analyze the stability range for these parameters. On this basis, a parameter optimization method based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to balance system stability and response performance. The effectiveness and robustness of this method are verified through a simulation analysis.

The effectiveness of these therapeutic properties is heavily influenced by the thermal treatment during drying and extraction methods. Traditional convective drying is a very energy incentive and lengthy process. Although some advanced and hybrid drying methods have been developed, these have not been applied in drying of banana inflorescence. In this study, we investigated the effects of freeze-drying (FD) and intermittent microwave convective drying (IMCD), as well as traditional convective oven drying (CD), on the polyphenol profile of banana inflorescence when extracted using the energy-efficient Accelerated Solvent Extraction method (ASE). Our findings revealed that the freeze-dried banana inflorescence powder exhibited the highest extraction of bioactive compounds when using 75% methanol at 100 °C as a solvent. It recovered 2906.3 ± 20.83 mg/100 g of the phenolic compounds and 63.12 ± 0.25% antioxidant activity under the optimal extraction conditions. While IMCD was found to be the second-best drying method in terms of preserving bioactive compounds, its operational time and cost were significantly lower compared to freeze-drying. Furthermore, our study confirmed the presence of medicinal compounds such as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, catechin, ferulic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin in banana inflorescence. The development of innovative functional foods and pharmaceutical ingredients through green extraction methods and optimal drying conditions holds significant potential to save energy in the process, enhance human health, and promote environmental sustainability and circular economy processes. These efforts align with supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 12.

However, based on current knowledge, carbon is expected to remain crucial in certain industrial sectors, e.g., the chemical industry. Consequently, it is essential to identify and utilize sustainable carbon sources in the future. In this context, various carbon sources were examined and classified in terms of their disruption of the Earth’s (fast) carbon cycle. Furthermore, the examined carbon sources were qualitatively analyzed with regard to their technical readiness level, their energy expenditure, and their current and future availability, as well as legal regulation within the European Union. As a result, only biogenic and mixed carbon from the ambient air can be considered genuinely sustainable within the Earth’s (fast) carbon cycle. Mixed carbon streams, e.g., from waste recycling, fall into a gray area. The same applies to certain process-related emissions that originally descend from fossil fuel energy. In terms of energy considerations, technical maturity, and exploitable potentials, prioritizing the utilization of biogenic carbon sources is advisable for the time being, especially for CO2 produced as a by-product originating from biogenic carbon carriers.

Photovoltaic (PV) projects, as a clean and sustainable energy technology, have garnered significant attention due to their notable environmental and economic benefits. However, traditional investment evaluation methods such as net present value (NPV) analysis fail to adequately capture the flexibility and future uncertainties inherent in PV project investments. This paper presents a case study analysis proposing a delay option model that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, providing a more scientific and flexible investment decision framework for PV projects. The case study results indicate that considering ESG factors significantly enhances the investment value of PV projects. This model not only provides comprehensive support for PV project investment decisions but also underscores the importance of establishing stringent carbon trading markets and policy incentive mechanisms to promote the widespread adoption and sustainable development of renewable energy projects.

The average value of the optimal factor tgφ to be maintained by customers depends on the efficiency of the network, the characteristics of the load, and the market costs of energy losses due to the transmission of reactive energy through the network that are covered by the DSO and the costs of reactive energy generation in receiving installations. The results presented for real MV/LV substations operating in the Polish distribution network demonstrate the application of annual measurements of active and reactive energy consumed and generated registered by AMI systems to calculate the optimal reactive power compensation level. They can be applied to verify the permissible levels of reactive energy compensation applied by the DSOs until now within the yearly tariffs for customers.

Using game theory, it reveals how NRE policies promote technological innovation, diversify energy supply, and strengthen international collaboration, thus advancing the global energy system towards a low-carbon transition and improving international energy governance. NRE policies significantly enhance national energy security by reducing dependency on single energy sources, facilitate the global shift to low-carbon energy, and intensify international cooperation. The effectiveness of these policies in driving energy transformation is notable, and they are expected to remain crucial for global energy security and sustainable transition. Recommendations include strengthening the stability and security of energy supply chains through enhanced oversight, increasing investment in R&D and innovation to reduce costs, fostering international cooperation for better policy coordination, and implementing diversified energy policies to encourage the adoption of NRE. These measures will address challenges from global geopolitical dynamics and drive the global energy system towards sustainability and efficiency.

In this study, simulation models of the nozzle at different angles between the normal and the injection hole inlet cross-section and the injection hole axis, as well as with different injection hole cone angles (a positive angle between the injection hole axis and its walls implies a divergent hole), were investigated by means of a previously developed numerical model that was validated based on experimental data from X-ray image technology. The results indicate that as the angle between the normal and the injection hole inlet cross-section and the injection hole axis increases, the cavitation asymmetry within the injection hole intensifies, accompanied by a decrease in the gas volume fraction. On one side of the injection hole, the hydraulic flip width expands, while, on the other side of the injection hole, the flow state gradually changes from hydraulic flip to super-cavitation flow, transitional cavitation and fully reattached flow. The divergent orifice layout intensifies cavitation, and the higher the positive injection hole cone angle, the bigger the hydraulic flip width. The convergent layout of the injection hole suppresses cavitation, and cavitation inside the nozzle disappears completely when the injection hole cone angle is less than −10°.
