        "text": "Taking you further with electric\n\nThe VNR Electric is proof of our commitment to reduce pollution, noise, and traffic on crowded urban streets. We are proud to introduce enhanced VNR Electric models that feature up to 85% improvement in range, faster charging, and a wider range of configurations.\n\nZero Emissions\n\nStand for sustainability\n\nAs the global leader in zero-emission electric trucks, Volvo is committed to reducing pollution, noise, and traffic on crowded urban streets. When charged with renewable energy, the VNR Electric is highly energy efficient with no climate impact.\n\nExterior\n\nWith great power, comes great range\n\nWhile the VNR Electric is revolutionary, the truck itself is immediately familiar, based on the highly popular Volvo VNR. Drivers will instantly recognize the maneuverability, visibility, and safety that are part of every VNR.\n\nInterior\n\nLess noise, better environment\n\nThe driving environment in the VNR Electric has been redefined to meet the needs of drivers operating in today’s competitive marketplace. Improved seating, instruments and controls are designed to put the driver comfortably and safely in command.\n\nProven performer\n\nWhile the VNR Electric is revolutionary, the truck itself is immediately familiar, based on the highly popular Volvo VNR. Drivers will instantly recognize the maneuverability, visibility, and safety that are part of every VNR.\n\nA great workspace just got even better\n\nWith electromobility comes several benefits like quieter cities, cleaner air, better traffic flow and a better working environment for all. Less noise also means less stress and reduced fatigue for the driver, improving their work environment.\n\nSafety\n\nIt’s apart of our DNA\n\nThe VNR Electric comes standard with Volvo Active Driver Assist, our collision avoidance technology. Combined with high-strength steel cab, heads-up display, and battery safety, the VNR Electric builds on our industry-leading safety technology.\n\nWe can’t compromise\n\nThe VNR Electric incorporates our highest safety standards in cab and chassis construction, with additional protection built into the battery cage. And includes the latest active safety features such as Volvo Active Driver Assist and lane departure warning.\n\nSafety is standard\n\nIncluded with the VNR Electric is Volvo Active Driver Assist, which is forward collision avoidance technology that helps drivers adapt and respond to changing traffic situations to help reduce the risk of collision. We take camera and radar technology and combine them together, working in unison to give the driver the best information available.\n\nBattery safety\n\nCollision tests. Barrier tests. Head impact tests. The VNR Electric cab has passed them all and they’re the toughest cabs around. You’re always well protected. Now, a side impact protection barrier integrated into the mounting system of the battery box.\n\nPower when you need it\n\nWith a CCS1 connector and a 250kW charger, the energy storage system can be fully charged in 60 minutes with a 4 battery configuration, and 90 minutes with a 6 battery configuration.\n\nCharging infrastructure\n\nVolvo Trucks will advise you as you select your third-party charging stations. We’ll also help as you define your requirements with local utilities.\n\nEnhanced configurations\n\nWe now offer an expanded six-battery system for greater hauling flexibility, with 6x2 and 6x4 options capable of covering up to 275 miles on a single charge. Additionally, our improved four-battery system is available in five configurations for both tractors and straight trucks, ensuring there's a VNR Electric model to fit your local delivery application.\n\nProven drivetrain\n\nThe VNR’s drivetrain is rated at 455 hp with up to 4,051 lb/ft torque. This allows for quick starts and excellent responsiveness in the close quarters of urban delivery. The fully-integrated driveline features Volvo’s two-speed I-Shift automated transmission for smooth acceleration. Our VNR Electric is capable of highway speeds.\n\nBattery monitoring\n\nUsing the industry’s most advanced telematics and real-time diagnostic system, our battery monitoring service allows the Volvo Uptime Center to proactively work with customers. The system forecasts the remaining useful life of the vehicle battery packages, maximizing battery life and optimizing maintenance and charging procedures.\n\nConnectivity\n\nVolvo is the hands down leader in connectivity, and the VNR Electric is no different. We've developed a best-in-class, real-time diagnostic system, available in every truck we build. Unparalleled connectivity and service experts available 24/7.\n\nUnparalleled experience\n\nWith you every step\n\nWe’ve spent years developing complete solutions for electromobility. No OEM is more qualified to help you walk through each decision as you develop your electric fleet.\n\nFinancing\n\nYour everything-you-need partner\n\nWe can assist you in securing financing for both vehicles and infrastructure, so your transition to electric is easier.\n\nExplore financing"
