        "text": "Summer might be winding down, but Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is ready to turn up the heat. About 50 restaurants will be offering special menus from Monday, Aug. 12, to Sunday, Aug. 18. Participating spots offer multicourse meals for a set price to show off their chops — literally. Check out the list and make reservations on Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s website.\n\nIn other Pittsburgh food news, James Beard Award-nominated chef Bethany Zozula announced via social media that her restaurant and bar, 40 North, had been permanently closed on July 28.\n\n40 North — a reference to Pittsburgh’s global latitude and the restaurant’s address — was hosted inside Alphabet City. Writer and artist sanctuary City of Asylum has operated out of Alphabet City since the organization opened the building in 2017. Brugge on North occupied the restaurant space from 2018 to 2020.\n\nIn the post announcing the closure, Zozula writes that staff was informed of the closure at 5 p.m., right when the restaurant’s usual dinner service began. After the closure, 40 North’s Instagram account was renamed “whatwaspgh.” The restaurant’s Facebook page has since been deactivated.\n\nThree days later, on the evening of Thursday, Aug. 1, Kathy Bzdziak — the chief financial officer of 40 North LLC, an independent entity that leases the space — sent a message to City of Asylum email subscribers confirming the restaurant has closed. Bzdziak did not indicate why 40 North had closed and never referred to the concept by name, only calling it “the restaurant in Alphabet City.” Bzdziak subsequently released a press release on Aug. 2, but it mostly reused information from the prior message.\n\n“We have loved providing our neighbors with beautiful food over the years and are thrilled to continue serving the community,” she wrote in the Aug. 1 message. “We are in this for the long term. We love the unique blend of ingredients that make up Alphabet City and building a community together.”\n\nBzdziak then announced that in mid- to late-August, the space would reopen as Alfabeto — a Northern Italian restaurant led by Executive Chef Maurizio Esposito. He carries a long and acclaimed resume from restaurants around the globe, and had been the Chef De Cuisine at the Richard DeShantz group’s Fish Nor Fowl since February.\n\nEsposito is also married to Caro Llewellyn, who joined City of Asylum as executive director in January.\n\nComments on the Instagram post announcing the closure ran the gamut. Some commenters thought the account had been hacked, others were confused as to why the post came one day after 40 North announced new specials. Others still were angry that management pulled the rug out from under the restaurant’s staff.\n\n“As a recent hire, just want to say that Chef Beth and every single other member of the [team] were excellent at their jobs, and the business owner made a huge mistake in throwing away this unique restaurant vision in an incredibly disrespectful and untimely way (mere minutes before the final shift of the work week),” Ami Furgang writes.\n\nIn an Instagram story on her personal account, Zozula wrote that she was stepping away from the internet for a moment but alluded to a return shortly.\n\nTo stay up to date on Alfabeto and Zozula’s future endeavors, follow our Eat & Drink coverage.\n\nI hope you’re still hungry, because that was just an appetizer. Here’s more Pittsburgh restaurant news:\n\nClosings\n\nThe Cadillac packed up and pulled out in the middle of the night — no, this isn’t the start to a ‘50s hit.\n\nThe Robinson eatery abruptly closed on Friday, July 26. Posted on the door was a sign that read: “We are grateful for the support of our community and encourage our guests to visit us at another Landry’s location nearby!”\n\nHospitality brand Landry’s bought Cadillac Ranch after its parent company filed for bankruptcy in late 2019, according to food-service publication FSR Magazine. Landry’s also owns the national chain Rainforest Cafe and the Grand Concourse at Station Square.\n\nUsers on the r/Pittsburgh subreddit write that Cadillac Ranch’s quality started declining at the same time.\n\n“Surprised it lasted another 5 years,” one user writes.\n\nLandry did not release a statement on the closure.\n\nJosh Sickels is rocking his pizzeria away from White Oak, but the concept won’t be gone for good. Sickels posted on Facebook confirming that Rockaway Pizzeria will leave White Oak for a new home in Regent Square later this year.\n\nIn the July 25 post, Sickels writes that he’s lived in Regent Square since Rockaway opened in 2017, and the move will make his life “a hell of a lot easier” — he’s since opened “irreverent food & cocktail” restaurant Hemlock House in the area.\n\n“As much as I’d love to keep the White Oak location open, I can’t,” Sickels writes. “Rockaway is my baby. It cannot exist without me. My employees are awesome, and do a great job of replicating my pizza, but Rockaway was a concept in my tiny Greenfield apartment long before I opened. Most of my recipes are done by taste, and that taste exists in my brain only. It cannot be replicated accurately by anyone but me. I have zero interest in running a half-assed version of something that I have dedicated my entire life to.”\n\nMore information on the closing and subsequent reopening is to come. For now, the White Oak location is still open Tuesdays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Fridays and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nOpenings\n\nBeercode, the Pittsburgh International Airport’s newest restaurant, brings a critical piece of the city’s identity to its biggest travel hub: the beer scene.\n\nThe gastropub was soft-launched in June ahead of its Thursday, Aug. 1, grand opening ceremony, and is the first of many new shops and restaurants that will populate the airport’s Airside Terminal when its modernization project is completed next year.\n\nBeercode keeps Dancing Gnome Beer, Helicon Brewing, Cinderlands Beer Co., Abjuration Brewing and 11th Hour Brewing Co. on tap. Its food menu hosts a mix of pub classics, healthier fare and Pittsburgh favorites, and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nYou can never go wrong with a burger, chicken Caesar salad, giant pretzel or pierogies, but don’t be scared to venture away from the norms. Beercode’s chicken and waffles are the perfect balance of sweet, savory and spicy, and most certainly understay their welcome — especially paired with 11th Hour Brewing’s New Cult, a New England-style IPA that’s light on the hops.\n\nFor August, the new spot’s connection to local brews is doubled; four of the vendors — Dancing Gnome being the exception — will offer beers that were made in collaboration with Black-owned organizations for Barrel & Flow, a local Black arts and brew fest that culminates this Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\n“We have like 50 collaborations on top of the 40 Black breweries that are here — that’s 80-some breweries,” says Barrel & Flow organizer Day Bracey. “Part of this festival is finding as many touch points as people can get when they’re coming into the city.”\n\n“With this, on your way in, if you want to grab a beer — or your way out — you could do so and you’ll still be supporting the festival and getting these beers that are exclusively made.”\n\nIn an interview after Beercode’s grand opening event, Bracey said that the airport had reached out too late for him to connect them with nationally recognized Black-owned brewers this year. But even though there aren’t any Black brews on tap, Bracey’s excited for the local recognition these collaborations might garner.\n\n“There’s going to be at least four Black entities that can tell their friends, ‘Hey, my beer’s on tap at the airport,’” Bracey says. “That’s huge.”\n\nThe Open Road has closed … on a storefront location for its new bar.\n\nThe Allentown-based nonalcoholic drink distributor is literally raising the bar at a forthcoming Garfield location. Owner Mel Babitz first posted about the move on Instagram on July 13.\n\nIn an email to NEXTpittsburgh, Babitz writes that the opening will occur in two phases. Open Road’s retail shop is expected to move from its current Allentown address to Garfield by late September. The on-premise, nonalcoholic bar, which will operate in the same space, is expected to open by the end of this year — “hopefully in time for Dry January.”\n\nAfter Jeremy Miller retired and closed Homestead staple Blue Dust in September 2023, the building didn’t stay empty for long.\n\nTen months of renovations later, food truck and catering service Rogue BBQ now calls the address home. The spot serves the usual suspects — smoked pulled pork, half chickens, brisket and ribs — alongside a slew of starters and mains.\n\nPlus, Wednesday nights are wing nights: $1.25 smoked wings and 60 cents fried wings from 4 p.m. until sold out.\n\nRogue BBQ is open Mondays through Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to midnight and Thursdays through Sundays from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.\n\nIf one food-truck-turned-brick-and-mortar-restaurant wasn’t enough for you this month, here’s a scoop of seconds: Tasty Taquitos now has a dedicated storefront in Millvale.\n\nOver the years, Taquitos has grown from food truck to food wagon to mainstay inside Point Breeze’s Evergreen Cafe. The Millvale spot, which opened on July 24, is in the old Millvale Diner.\n\nIn terms of the menu, there’s not much to elaborate on since the spot is born of a Mexican food truck. Tacos, quesadillas, burritos and more are all on offer, with a slew of interchangeable meat options from chicken and steak to al pastor and tinga. Taquitos’ chipotle cheese sauce is smooth with a slightly spicy bite, and the many different salsas can entirely change the taste of any dish. Plus, the tres leches is superb.\n\nTaquitos Millvale is open Mondays through Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Fridays and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nAfter seven years of proofing, pizza food truck Alberta’s is on the rise at a new brick-and-mortar spot in Pittsburgh’s North Side.\n\nOwner and Pizzaiolo Beau Mitall started making plans for the spot in 2023 after the success of his food truck and brewery pop-ups, the pizzeria’s website reads.\n\nFrom small plates and salads to Italian desserts and fresh-dough-daily pizzas, eaters pickier than my sister will still find something they like.\n\nAlberta’s is open Thursdays and Fridays from 4:30 to 9 p.m. and Saturdays from 3 to 9 p.m."
