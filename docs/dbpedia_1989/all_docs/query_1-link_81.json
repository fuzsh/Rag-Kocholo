        "text": "The participation stemmed from a collaboration between Penske Truck Leasing and Daimler Trucks North America to test commercial electric trucks in real-world situations and drive future improvements to the technology. Fastenal, which supports business partners with last-mile logistics as part of its supply chain management services, has been a valuable test case.\n\n\"Fastenal has been a tremendous partner in the testing of these electric vehicle (EV) units,\" said Paul Rosa, senior vice president of procurement and fleet planning at Penske Truck Leasing. \"Their sustainability goals and efforts along with their innovative way of thinking and approaching the future of our industry made them a natural fit to run EVs. We look forward to continuing to work together with Fastenal towards a more sustainable future.\"\n\n\"The program is helping us understand where electric vehicles might fit into our future,\" said Dan Florness, Fastenal's president and CEO. \"It also gives us a chance to help accelerate the development of commercial EV technology.\"\n\nFor over a year, Fastenal has been utilizing the two eM2 box trucks to run daily delivery routes from its Santa Fe Springs trucking terminal to surrounding branches and customer-specific Onsite locations. Together the trucks travel nearly 900 miles per week to service 16 Fastenal locations spanning from Inglewood in the west, to Santa Ana in the south, to Ontario in the east.\n\n\"The eM2 vehicles have performed well for us,\" said Kevin Larson, Fastenal's VP of transportation. \"Our drivers really like the instant torque and performance, and the trucks have proven to be highly reliable over time, with very few downtime days.\"\n\nFastenal was running the eCascadia tractor on a roughly 120-mile daily line haul normally run by a diesel tractor. The vehicle took off from Santa Fe Springs in the morning, headed north to pick up a full trailer in Valencia, then returned to Santa Fe Springs, where the load was broken up into multiple local routes (two of which are run by the eM2s). With the eCascadia test now complete, Penske can continue to focus on program development and Fastenal will continue to be a partner in this space as they work together on more sustainable transportation options.\n\nThe Penske and Daimler commercial EV testing program is supported by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), whose $15.7 million grant helped fund the program. South Coast AQMD focuses on improving air quality in large portions of Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including the Coachella Valley.\n\nPenske has also committed to certifying its over 5,500 truck drivers with TAT training. TAT provides companies with a training video as well as wallet cards that educate drivers on the signs of human trafficking and what a driver should do if they suspect it.\n\n\"This is an extremely important cause and we are honored to join with others in our industry to support an organization whose mission is so critical,\" explained Brian Hard, president & CEO of Penske Transportation Solutions. \"We are looking forward to providing our drivers with the tools they need to identify and report possible trafficking cases. We are aligned with TAT's overarching goal to saturate the trucking industry with educational information and ultimately combat this horrific crime.\"\n\nHuman trafficking has been reported in all 50 states, and victims are often found in locations frequented by truckers. Through its corporate partnerships, TAT is raising up a mobilized army of transportation professionals to assist law enforcement in recognizing and reporting this crime in order to assist victims and bring their perpetrators to justice.\n\n\"The level of commitment and support Penske is making to TAT not only ensures there will be thousands more trained professionals on the roads assisting law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, but also makes a statement about the importance the industry places on their role in setting and making social responsibility and sustainability goals that help to improve the lives of those who have been exploited,\" said TAT Deputy Director Kylla Lanier.\n\nPenske will also support TAT's Freedom Drivers Project, which uses a semi-tractor trailer that serves as a mobile educational exhibit on human trafficking. The exhibit has been seen by more than 47,597 people at 198 events and traveled to more than 41 states since it debuted in August 2014.\n\nYet, long before the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs take the first snap, Penske was running plays of its own to meet increased demand on the supply chain and for rental trucks in Miami.\n\n\"You have the two football teams that prepare, strategize and put together a game plan to come out successful for themselves, and we have to do the same thing,\" said Zac Bugay, manager of national rental accounts for Penske Truck Rental.\n\nWhen the 49ers take on the Chiefs Sunday, Feb. 2, at Hard Rock Stadium, the winner will take home the Vince Lombardi Trophy and bragging rights as the best team in the National Football League.\n\nPenske, the Official Transportation Partner of CBS Sports HQ on the Road, is sponsoring live coverage from Radio Row all week in Miami, including morning-hour blocks each day and game previews.\n\nOrganizers expect about 100,000 out-of-town visitors to come to Miami for big game festivities, generating $500 million for the local economy, according to the South Florida Business Journal.\n\nPerhaps the big game's greatest impact will be felt in local economies across the country.\n\nWith 194 million adults expecting to make plans for the big game, viewers are expected to spend $17.2 billion on food and beverages, merchandise and party supplies, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nSuiting Up For the Big Game\n\nStepping up to take the snap are third-party logistics providers like Penske Logistics, which prepares throughout the year for surge events like the big game.\n\n\"Events like the big game are one of the primary reasons companies look to third-party logistics companies for support because they are looking for access to resources which will allow their supply chain to flex up and then back down with demand,\" said Shaun Hodges, vice president of sales for Penske Logistics.\n\nCommunication with the customer is a key component to successfully preparing for the demand of signature events like the big game.\n\n\"As Penske Transportation Solutions, we have access to the largest fleet of vehicles in the U.S., a driver base of more than 5,000 and 30 million square feet of warehouse space to support surges like this and similar events,\" Hodges said.\n\nWhen it comes to the big game, consumables are scoring with consumers.\n\n\"Food and beverage is our fastest growing industry sector. We have great experience working with food manufacturers, distributors and retailers to insure sure their goods flow through various components of the supply chain ultimately resulting in the availability in the store or at the event to meet consumer demand,\" Hodges said.\n\nOn the ground in Miami, refrigerated vehicles will be vital to storing fresh products and other items that will be needed for replenishment. Having units on hand to meet that demand will be key, Hodges said.\n\nBoots on the Ground\n\nCaitey Spellman, district manager in Miami, said the excitement for the game has been matched only by the demand for rental trucks, especially refrigerated units and trucks with lift gates.\n\n\"The demand is so high that the region has brought trucks in from Jacksonville, Tampa, pretty much anywhere we have additional trucks,\" Spellman said. \"They have been kindly shuttling them into Miami, so we don't skip a beat in making sure that we have trucks to offer to our customers.\"\n\nThose businesses run the gamut of services from food preparation to furniture rentals. The demand for those industries has been so intense that some companies have had to bring in employees from other cities to operate the rental trucks as they perform their duties.\n\nSpellman applauded both the rental and maintenance departments with helping as many customers as possible.\n\n\"We are offering a lot of real possibilities to a company who in the 11th hour is still trying to find some equipment,\" Spellman said. \"The rental department is doing a really nice job of keeping a master list of who needs what and the minute something comes back we are calling the customer.\"\n\nOnce returned, the maintenance department makes sure the unit is cleaned, serviced and fueled, so that it is ready to go for the next customer.\n\n\"We can't lose the quality and the values that we have in customer service due to this high turnover of rentals,\" Spellman said. \"We want to make sure the reputation of high-quality trucks and high-quality service does not get lost in all of the excitement.\"\n\nPenske offers a wide variety of rental trucks from large commercial semi-tractors and trailers to small box trucks. We encourages retailers and businesses to make reservations by calling our hotline for business rentals, 1-800-PENSKE1.\n\nBy Bernie Mixon"
