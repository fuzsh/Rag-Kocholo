        "text": "My house in East Hampton is quite large and is more than 100 years old. When I purchased Lily Pond and had it restored more than 20 years ago, state-of-the-art oil burners were installed. Since that time, there have been many advancements in how homes are heated. The use of modulating gas burners is a much cleaner and greener, not to mention, cost-efficient approach. The time had come to replace my aging oil burners. After researching options, we chose Weil McLain, a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of gas- and oil-fired hot water and steam boilers for space heating in residential, commercial, and institutional buildings.\n\nUnlike a standard oil burner, which is either on or off, a modulating gas boiler measures the temperature inside the building and out, and uses only enough fuel to heat, based on those readings. This translates to less fuel used while keeping the home at a comfortable temperature. Itâ€™s also an eco-friendly system that also happens to reduce energy bills. We recently aired a television segment about this subject and I would like to thank Weil McLain for helping us with this project."
