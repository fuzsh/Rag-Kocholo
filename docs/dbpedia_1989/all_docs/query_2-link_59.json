        "text": "“We asked them if they were vaccinated, and about trust, and found that those two things were correlated,” Lazer says.\n\n“We also looked at whether expression of distrust predicted future vaccine status, as measured by self report on the survey, and it did.”\n\nThe paper did not specifically ask about people’s opinions about masking and vaccination mandates, Lazer says, “but, yes, trust was strongly related to those things.”\n\nIn response to several open-ended questions, people with lower levels of trust commented that “doctors were just in it for the money” and communicated problems with billing issues, he says.\n\nThe levels of distrust may come as a surprise because doctors traditionally enjoy a great degree of public confidence.\n\nLazer and his co-authors say a 2022 survey reported that U.S. adults had “greater trust in physicians and nurses than in any other institution, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”\n\nThe early results may have represented an inflation of people’s esteem for the medical profession at a time when hospital emergency departments were besieged by COVID-19 cases, Lazer says.\n\nThe survey results are concerning to the researchers, who say most adults see a physician regularly and rely on their health care provider for information on everything from diet and exercise and smoking cessation to seatbelt use and firearm safety.\n\nThe politicization of the COVID-19 epidemic helped fracture the connection between the public and traditional sources of health information, Lazer says.\n\n“If you don’t trust the establishment, if you don’t trust institutions, you’re more likely to go to Facebook groups who are making strange recommendations regarding health-related behaviors,” he says.\n\nSome of the distrust has deeper roots, particularly among marginalized groups including women and people of color who may doubt the medical system is representing their interests, Lazer says.\n\n“If people don’t see individuals like themselves in medicine, they may be less trusting of medicine,” he says.\n\nIn the short run, restoring trust in public health could mean working with trusted community partners to communicate health practices based on best evidence, including vaccination, Lazer says.\n\n“Then there are the longer-term solutions, which is to diversify medicine, diversify science,” he says. “It’s never too late.”"
