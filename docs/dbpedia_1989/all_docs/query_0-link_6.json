For the purposes of such calculation, exterior building walls on adjoining zoning lots abutting an open or roofed terrace shall not constitute an enclosure. A sun control device that is accessible for purposes other than for maintenance shall be considered a balcony;\n\n(11) floor space within stairwells:\n\n(i) at each floor of buildings containing residences developed or enlarged after April 16, 2008, that are greater than 125 feet in height, provided that:\n\n(1) such stairwells are located on a story containing residences;\n\n(2) such stairwells are used as a required means of egress from such residences;\n\n(3) such stairwells have a minimum width of 44 inches;\n\n(4) such floor space excluded from floor area shall be limited to a maximum of eight inches of stair and landing width measured along the length of the stairwell enclosure at each floor; and\n\n(5) where such stairwells serve non-residential uses on any floor, or are located within multi-level dwelling units, the entire floor space within such stairwells on such floors shall count as floor area;\n\n(ii) at each floor of buildings developed or enlarged after April 28, 2015, that are 420 feet or greater in height, provided that:\n\n(1) such stairwells serve a space with an occupancy group other than Group R-2, as classified in the New York City Building Code, that is located at or above a height of 420 feet; and\n\n(2) such floor space excluded from floor area shall be limited to:\n\n(aa) the 25 percent of stair and landing width required by the New York City Building Code which is provided in addition to the stair and landing widths required by such Code for means of egress; or\n\n(bb) the one stairwell required by the New York City Building Code which is provided in addition to the stairwells required by such Code for means of egress.

The Governing Group shall be a local development corporation, organized pursuant to the New York State Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, and affiliated with City government for purposes of the New York State Public Authorities Law, whose organizational purpose shall be limited solely to the purposes set forth in this Chapter. Each member shall have one vote, and all Governing Group decisions, as set forth below, shall be upon a majority vote at a public meeting at which a quorum is present. A quorum shall consist of a majority of the members.\n\nThe purpose of the Governing Group shall be to bolster and enhance East Midtown’s status as a premier central business district with a high-quality public realm, by allocating funds from the Fund to implement public realm improvement projects. The Governing Group shall establish and maintain a Public Realm Improvement Concept Plan (“Concept Plan”) for the purpose of creating a list of priority improvements, and shall have the authority to amend such Concept Plan, and associated list of improvements, as necessary. All priority improvements in the Concept Plan shall meet the criteria set forth in Section 81-683 (Criteria for improvements in the Public Realm Improvement Concept Plan).\n\nEstablishment of the Concept Plan, amendment of the Concept Plan, calendaring of items for a vote to fund, and designation of funding for a specific public realm improvement on the Concept Plan shall be decisions requiring a majority vote of the Governing Group at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If only members of the Governing Group appointed by the Mayor vote to calendar a particular public realm improvement for a vote to fund it, the Governing Group shall conduct a public hearing on the matter prior to such improvement being placed on the calendar for vote. In addition, if any member of the Governing Group puts forth a proposed public realm improvement, discussion of such improvement shall be added to the agenda of the next public meeting. Establishment of the initial Concept Plan shall be completed no later than November 1, 2017.\n\nIn the event that more than 20 million dollars remains in the Fund for more than three years, the Governing Group shall be required to hold a vote either to fund a public realm improvement project or to retain the funds.\n\nThe Governing Group shall adopt procedures for the conduct of its activities. Such procedures shall be consistent with the requirements of the New York State Open Meetings Law (Article 7, NYS Public Officers Law), which procedures shall also be consistent with the goals of the Subdistrict. Those procedures shall be publicly available by posting on the Department of City Planning’s website, and shall include rules requiring reporting and transparency including, but not limited to, the following: procedures on the adoption and amendment of the concept plan and opportunity for public comment thereon; requirements to provide a transcript or recording of all public meetings and hearings; and transparency and annual reporting requirements concerning deposits into and expenditures from the Fund. The Governing Group shall annually update the Concept Plan by providing a list of all projects on the Concept Plan to date, those added or removed in the past year, the dollar amount of funds designated to each project on the Concept Plan, to the extent available, the estimated cost of each project on the Concept Plan, and the schedule for all projects for which a decision to designate funding has been made by the Governing Group. Such annual update shall be posted on the Department of City Planning’s website no later than January 15 of each calendar year following the establishment of the initial Concept Plan. All meetings of the Governing Group shall be open to the public with advance public notice provided of all meetings and public hearings.\n\nA \"zoning lot\" is either:\n\n(a) a lot of record existing on December 15, 1961, or any applicable subsequent amendment thereto;\n\n(b) a tract of land, either unsubdivided or consisting of two or more contiguous lots of record, located within a single block, which, on December 15, 1961, or any applicable subsequent amendment thereto, was in single ownership;\n\n(c) a tract of land, either unsubdivided or consisting of two or more lots of record contiguous for a minimum of 10 linear feet, located within a single block, which at the time of filing for a building permit (or, if no building permit is required, at the time of the filing for a certificate of occupancy) is under single fee ownership and with respect to which each party having any interest therein is a party in interest (as defined herein); or\n\n(d) a tract of land, either unsubdivided or consisting of two or more lots of record contiguous for a minimum of 10 linear feet, located within a single block, which at the time of filing for a building permit (or, if no building permit is required, at the time of filing for a certificate of occupancy) is declared to be a tract of land to be treated as one zoning lot for the purpose of this Resolution. Such declaration shall be made in one written Declaration of Restrictions covering all of such tract of land or in separate written Declarations of Restrictions covering parts of such tract of land and which in the aggregate cover the entire tract of land comprising the zoning lot. Any Declaration of Restrictions or Declarations of Restrictions which individually or collectively cover a tract of land are referred to herein as \"Declarations.\" Each Declaration shall be executed by each party in interest (as defined herein) in the portion of such tract of land covered by such Declaration (excepting any such party as shall have waived its right to execute such Declaration in a written instrument executed by such party in recordable form and recorded at or prior to the recording of the Declaration). Each Declaration and waiver of right to execute a Declaration shall be recorded in the Conveyances Section of the Office of the City Register or, if applicable, the County Clerk's Office of the county in which such tract of land is located, against each lot of record constituting a portion of the land covered by such Declaration.\n\nA zoning lot, therefore, may or may not coincide with a lot as shown on the official tax map of the City of New York, or on any recorded subdivision plat or deed.\n\nParcels within City-owned tracts of land located in Broad Channel within the boundaries of Community Board 14 in the Borough of Queens that were numerically identified for leasing purposes on maps filed in the Office of Borough President prior to December 15, 1961, may be considered as individual lots of record as of September 10, 1981.\n\n(e) For purposes of the provisions of paragraph (c) hereof:\n\n(1) prior to issuing a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, as the case may be, the Department of Buildings shall be furnished with a certificate issued to the applicant therefor by a title insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York showing that each party having any interest in the subject tract of land is a party in interest (as defined herein); except that where the City of New York is a fee owner, such certificate may be issued by the New York City Law Department; and\n\n(2) a \"party in interest\" in the tract of land shall include only (W) the fee owner thereof, (X) the holder of any enforceable recorded interest superior to that of the fee owner and which could result in such holder obtaining possession of all or substantially all of such tract of land, (Y) the holder of any enforceable recorded interest in all or substantially all of such tract of land which would be adversely affected by the development thereof and (Z) the holder of any unrecorded interest in all or substantially all of such tract of land which would be superior to and adversely affected by the development thereof and which would be disclosed by a physical inspection of the tract of land.\n\n(f) For purposes of the provisions of paragraph (d) hereof:\n\n(1) prior to issuing a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, as the case may be, the Department of Buildings shall be furnished with a certificate issued to the applicant therefor by a title insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York showing that each party in interest (excepting those parties waiving their respective rights to join therein, as set forth in this definition) has executed the Declaration and that the same, as well as each such waiver, have been duly recorded; except that where the City of New York is a fee owner, such certificate may be issued by the New York City Law Department;\n\n(2) the Buildings Department, in issuing a building permit for construction of a building or other structure on the zoning lot declared pursuant to paragraph (d) above or, if no building permit is required, in issuing a certificate of occupancy for such building or other structure, shall accept an application for same from and, if all conditions for issuance of same are fulfilled, shall issue same to any party to the Declaration;\n\n(3) by their execution and recording of a Declaration, the parties to the Declaration, and all parties who have waived their respective rights to execute such Declaration, shall be deemed to have agreed that no breach by any party to the Declaration, or any agreement ancillary thereto, shall have any effect on the treatment of the tract of land covered by the Declaration as one zoning lot for purposes of this Resolution and such tract of land shall be treated as one zoning lot unless such zoning lot is subdivided in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution; and\n\n(4) a \"party in interest\" in the portion of the tract of land covered by a Declaration shall include only (W) the fee owner or owners thereof, (X) the holder of any enforceable recorded interest in all or part thereof which would be superior to the Declaration and which could result in such holder obtaining possession of any portion of such tract of land, (Y) the holder of any enforceable recorded interest in all or part thereof which would be adversely affected by the Declaration, and (Z) the holder of any unrecorded interest in all or part thereof which would be superior to and adversely affected by the Declaration and which would be disclosed by a physical inspection of the portion of the tract of land covered by the Declaration.\n\nA zoning lot may be subdivided into two or more zoning lots, provided that all resulting zoning lots and all buildings thereon shall comply with all of the applicable provisions of this Resolution. If such zoning lot, however, is occupied by a non-complying building, such zoning lot may be subdivided provided such subdivision does not create a new non-compliance or increase the degree of non-compliance of such building.\n\nWhere ownership of a zoning lot or portion thereof was effected prior to the effective date of this amendment, as evidenced by an attorney's affidavit, any development, enlargement or alteration on such zoning lot may be based upon such prior effected ownership as then defined in the zoning lot definition of Section 12-10. Such prior leasehold agreements shall be duly recorded prior to August 1, 1978.\n\nPrior to the issuance of any permit for a development or enlargement pursuant to this Resolution a complete metes and bounds of the zoning lot, the tax lot number, the block number and the ownership of the zoning lot as set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) herein shall be recorded by the applicant in the Conveyances Section of the Office of the City Register (or, if applicable, the County Clerk's Office) of the county in which the said zoning lot is located. The zoning lot definition in effect prior to the effective date of this amendment shall continue to apply to Board of Standards and Appeals approvals in effect at the effective date hereof."
