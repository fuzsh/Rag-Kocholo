        "text": "Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI for short) brought AD&D goodness to the world with the Gold Box series of games, but they also were well known for being masters of wargaming. Back in 1988 you could put your order in through their catalog service for multiple platforms: Apple II, Apple IIGS, Atari 8-Bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64/128, Commodore Amiga or IBM PC.\n\nWant to play Roadwar 2000 on your Apple? No problem, it’s just $39.95 + tax and shipping! ($44.95 + tax and shipping for the GS). Want to play Pool of Radiance on your Apple II, C64, as well as your IBM PC? You got it – just fill out your order and get your credit card ready!\n\nAnd the good news was that the catalog was included in the box with every new purchase!\n\nCheck out all the offers by clicking on the image of the front page (below)!\n\nFiled under: Catalog Cavalcade, PC Games, Uncategorized | Tagged: PC Games, product catalog, retro games, retrogaming, ssi | Leave a comment »\n\n“Forgotten Classics” is a celebration of obscure PC games that weren’t released to widespread fanfare – or simply fell of the radar of gamers at the time of their release – and deserve a second look. In this installment: The World of Aden: Thunderscape, an interesting 1995 role-playing game by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI).\n\nFirst, a little gaming history. The AD&D gold box PC game series was a huge hit for SSI back in the day, but eventually technology outpaced the game engine, regardless of how many tweaks they could add to it. This meant a new game engine needed to be developed, which is exactly what SSI did for its next release, Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. Of course, this kind of effort is expensive, and a company needs to either have a large cash cushion to absorb it, or a high sales payoff in the first game release using the new engine. Unfortunately, SSI had neither, and the company was bought out by Mindscape, Inc., ending an era.\n\nThe World of Aden: Thunderscape was the newly sold company’s effort to mirror the success of the Ultima series in the RPG market: an in-house game engine and concept that did not require 3rd party licensing. No fees paid to TSR for the right to use the AD&D worlds meant higher profits for the company. It all sounded so elegantly simple. So why don’t we still adventure in Aden today?\n\nThe answer lies in the gaming experience. Thunderscape was a world highly influenced by steampunk. Muskets were an option (albeit an expensive one) for adventurers. Steam golems, archaic-appearing robots, could appear to threaten the party, and other steam-related technology, such as steam engines, could be found in the game. Most other RPGs were classic medievalesque fare; because of its steampunk leanings, Thunderscape was something different.\n\nIn some ways, Thunderscape played like a standard SSI-produced RPG, which made the game world even more jarring. Character development followed a familiar pattern: the player forms a party of adventurers based on race (Human, Elf, Faerkin, Jurak, Rapacian, Goreaux, Dwarf, or Ferran), establishes their individual attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower), decides on their skills (fencing, sword, axe/mace, bow, shield, martial arts, polearm, knife, firearms, stealth, acrobatics, lockpicking, fast talk, see secrets, merchant, xenology, and cast spells), decide which spells any spellcasting characters may use, equip the character with weapons and/or armor, choose the portrait and name your character. Once the party is ready, off they go, looking for monsters to kill, treasure to covet, and quests to complete.\n\nThe game played out in a first-person perspective, attempting to give the “you are there” feel. There are 20 levels of fun, including caverns, cities, mines, castles, sewers, and the great outdoors. Movement is controlled using the mouse, with right-click accessing the directional arrows. Combat is also controlled by the mouse, with a special combat menu appearing when hostilities begin. And since many RPGs seem to be a scavenger hunt, accumulating inventory is also controlled by the mouse, with a hand icon appearing when you get close enough to something that your magpie-like characters want to add to their inventory slots.\n\nThunderscape wasn’t all hack ‘n’ slash, though. Puzzles needed to be solved to progress through the storyline. Clues were distributed throughout the gameworld that needed to be collected and used. Even combat required more than the standard, send in the walking tank while launching fireballs from the rear, as some enemies would not fall without discovering their weaknesses during gameplay. All in all, Thunderscape was a thinking person’s RPG, not a clickfest.\n\nFor all its good features, Thunderscape had some play issues. It followed in the time-honored path of releasing before all the bugs could be squished, but that’s what version 1.1 patches are for. Even so, the game did well enough to warrant a somewhat mediocre sequel, World of Aden: Entomorph Plague of the Darkfall. However, the sequel was not a huge seller, and became the final game in the World of Aden series.\n\nThunderscape remains a game that some recall with fond memories of many hours of deep gameplay, and others recall as a stopover between Menzoberranzan and Ravenloft titles. It’s a game that got lost in the shuffle, but a good enough gaming experience to warrant inclusion as a Forgotten Classic. For a little steampunk action that predates Sierra’s Arcanum by several years, give The World of Aden: Thunderscape a try!\n\nFiled under: Forgotten Classics, PC Games, Retro Gaming | Tagged: forgotten classics, pcgames, retrogaming, ssi, thunderscape, world of aden | Leave a comment »\n\nBy the 1990’s, turn-based strategy war games had become highly specialized with a very thin customer base. Most required a grognard’s ability to juggle multiple battle statistics at once, and had a limited visual appeal. Then, in 1994, Strategic Simulations Incorporated (SSI) released Panzer General and the wargame genre transformed into a mass market product.\n\nUnlike real-time strategy (RTS) games, turn-based strategy games permit the user time to ponder their next move without having to press the pause button. The drawback is that once you’ve committed your resources you must watch your turn – and your then your opponent’s – play out. To state the obvious, chess is an example of turn-based strategy.\n\nPanzer General offered players both single scenario play, in which they could assume the role of an Allied or an Axis general, as well as a Campaign Mode, in which the player attempts to win World War II for Germany. The campaign runs from 1939 to 1945, and as units gain battle experience, they become stronger, and the player (as general) gains access to upgrades and reinforcements – assuming they are victorious, that is. If the player achieves their scenario objectives with five or more game turns to spare, it is considered a “Major Victory,” which unlocks further game elements. Major Victories enable the player to alter history, such as invading Britain on the heels of victory in France, or even landing an invasion force in North America to capture Washington, D.C.\n\nThe game was published across several platform, including versions for the Panasonic 3D0 system, MS-DOS and Windows based computers, Sony PlayStation, and for the Macintosh. It also spawned a plethora of sequels, including: the 5-Star Series (Allied General, Fantasy General, Pacific General, People’s General, and Star General), Panzer General II, Panzer General 3D Assault, Panzer General III: Scorched Earth, and Panzer General: Allied Assault. Clearly gamers enjoyed wargames once again!\n\nPanzer General was both well-reviewed and well-received by the gaming public. Besides receiving high review scores from the critics, gamers just kept playing the game. To this day, there are sites on the Internet devoted to this game, with hundreds of scenarios, new units, and even new features. Mods are the fountain of youth for classic games, and Panzer General was no exception, as they managed to keep the game fresh and interesting years after its release. Ultimately, the game’s fabulous gameplay coupled with its genre-changing aspect make it a classic retro game that every retrogamer needs to play!\n\nFiled under: Game of the Week, PC Games, Retro Gaming | Tagged: 1994, magisterrex game of the week, panzer general, ssi, strategy, turn-based | Leave a comment »"
