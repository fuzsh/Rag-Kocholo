        "text": "Panzer General Forever version 1.02 - 12MB\n\nDownload Panzer General Forever (abbreviated PGForever) version 1.02.\n\nAfter downloading the package unzip it to the desired destination, open the root folder of the game and click on PGForever.exe to start the game. The main menu will offer you to play a remake of Panzer General or remake of Allied General or one of two experimental mods.\n\nAbout PG Forever\n\nPG Forever is a remake of Panzer General as well as Allied General because the two share the same game rules. The goal was to preserve characteristic look and feel of the original game while at the same time improve aspects like compatibility with modern hardware and operating systems. Improved UI and usability, H2H play, new AI, and easier customizability. Great attention was given in including exact game mechanics as the original game but the play still differs because of different AI. The gameplay is preserved very faithfully but some features from the old game were not included like battle animations, voice-overs, and PBEM. New features include different UI and better usability, combat log and extended combat prediction (invoked by L key), replay, already mentioned different AI, online H2H play, mods can be included and accessed from the main screen, customizability is easier and the game has PGDOS converter that enables conversion of old mods. Game was released in late 2009. Further improvements and polishing should not be expected because the project is discontinued."
