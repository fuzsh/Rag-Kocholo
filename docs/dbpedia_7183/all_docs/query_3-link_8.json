        "text": "This is a satisfying strategy game for those who do not mind the slow pace of old-school turn-based games.\n\nUser Rating: 7.5 | Panzer General: Allied Assault X360\n\nFor those of you who grew up in the mid-90s and were playing hard-core strategy games, you may remember fondly the Panzer General series. For these people in particular, do not expect to recognize this game, for it is Panzer General in name only. More of a card-collecting game played on a board, it has almost nothing in common with the Panzer General games of old, save the name and approximate setting. However, the good news is that it is still quite a fun little strategy game!\n\nBasically, this game is played on a large, square-shaped board where you and your opponent draw cards and place units on the map while trying to push into enemy territory and either capture their home-base, or wipe out all of their units. The strategy begins when you realize that your deck of cards are broken into units of different types and uses, combat cards, and other cards that bestow certain abilities. Of the unit cards, you can play a variety of infantry, artillery, or tanks, each of which has a different tactical value. Of the combat cards, you can attempt to increase or decrease various card parameters, such as health, defense, attack, or even support values. When it comes to the other cards, each of them offer something different, sometimes allowing you to bombard an enemy unit or force them to discard a couple of cards at random. Although the German and American decks have different cards, for the most part they feel balanced.\n\nAfter you take the various card types into consideration, you also must think about how different kinds of terrain will affect your units and how some units (such as artillery) are much more useful in a support role than a direct combat role. Another consideration comes from the ability to sacrifice cards during combat in order to gain an advantage over your opponent. As a final point, there is an amount of luck required to win because a die is rolled during combat to further add to the chaos of war!\n\nWhen it all comes together, this game can offer a great deal of satisfying strategic warfare. However, I often felt as though the enemy had an unfair advantage (especially during the single-player campaign) or simply had an unlikely amount of luck. Trial and error are required to complete the hardest missions in the campaign, but being screwed over time and again because of drawing poor cards or getting bad dice rolls is just infuriating. Thankfully, when you get tired of the campaign, you can either play one-off skirmish maps against the computer or you can look for an opponent online.\n\nAll things considered, this is a satisfying strategy game for those who do not mind the slow pace of old-school turn-based games. For those of you who need fast-paced action or prefer their strategy games without a luck element, you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nOther Helpful Reviews for Panzer General: Allied Assault\n\nRating:9\n\n\"In war, you can only be killed once, but in table-top card games, many times.\"\n\nDubbed as \"The War to End All Wars\", World War II has more than seen its share of games, mostly in first person shooter form.
