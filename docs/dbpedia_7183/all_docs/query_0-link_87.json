        "text": "Where are they now? - Michael Legg\n\nLegg was a writer, designer and lead programmer on Westwood Studios point 'n' click adventure, The Legend of Kyrandia\n\nEarlier this month, I was talking about how I love point 'n' click adventures and how the company Westwood Studios actually took a punt in this genre. This led me to talk about Jennifer Sward, who was the Producer and Voice Director for the classic The Legend of Kyrandia. Today I'm going to focus the spotlight on a colleague of hers called Michael Legg. Legg is a man that has been in the games development industry for almost three decades now but what is probably seen as pretty rare in the industry, has only worked for a couple of games development studios, namely Westwood Studios and Petroglyph Games (which is basically Westwood Studios Mk II). While at Westwood Studios, Legg worked on several classic games including all The Legend of Kyrandia games and 1997's Blade Runner. At Petroglyph Games, he's worked on games such as Star Wars: Empire at War and Universe at War: Earth Assault. He currently serves as co-founder, President and Lead Programmer at Petroglyph Games.\n\nHere are some of the milestones and highlights of his career in timeline format!\n\n1980 - Legg enrols at Bonanza High School.
