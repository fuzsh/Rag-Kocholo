        "text": "I bought this game at Gen Con in 2010. At the time, I was excited about getting this game. For several months I had been playing Panzer General: Allied Assault on the Xbox 360. A board game version of Allied Assault also exists, and Russian Assault was a follow up that premiered at Gen Con. I thought that many of the things that Russian Assault added to the game were very welcome changes. I thought that this would be a game that my wife would enjoy. I based this on the fact that she likes Memoir '44. Memoir '44 is a very \"gamey\", scenario based take on war as opposed to a simulation, and Panzer General is also scenario based and more game than simulation. I also thought she would like this because by this point she had begun enjoying the card combat of Warhammer: Invasion, and Panzer General has a CCG type of feel to it. However, I was completely wrong and she absolutely HATED this game. It has been a year and a half since she last played this game. So has she changed her mind or does she still hate this game?\n\nGame Overview\n\nTo play Russian Assault, players first set up the scenario. To create the scenario geomorphic tiles are assembled to make a board. The scenario also dictates how many points worth of units a player starts with, starting prestige, starting ammo, and victory conditions. When a player begins they first draw four cards. They may choose to draw from either their unit deck or from the common action card deck in any combination. Players will also collect ammo which is needed for artillery support. If a player has less than 10 cards at this point they may spend prestige to buy more cards. Next comes the operational phase. During this phase players can do all kind of things. They can play Operational action cards for various effects. They can play new unit cards to the boards. They may move units, and they may attack if able. Most units may only move or attack. A lot of the game revolves around combat. The combat phase is an 18 step process. The attack goes through many of these steps and resolves damage. If the defender survives then they \"return fire\" by repeating most of these steps, so the actual process is actually 30+ steps. This can be time consuming. For one combat (that did go kind of slowly) my wife timed it and it took about 8 minutes. Because of this I am not going to go through the whole process. Needless to say it involves a lot of minor calculations plus back and forth card play.\n\nAfter the operational phase, a player collects prestige. Each board tile that a player controls gives them a certain amount of prestige. After collecting prestige, a player has the option to buy more cards, and then it becomes the other player's turn. All scenarios have a time limit so the game ends when the victory condition is met or time ends.\n\nThe Game We Played\n\nWe played the Kharkov scenario. I played the Germans and my wife played the Russians. In this scenario, the Germans start with lots of resources and better units. The Russians start with control of the board except for the German home row. Bordering the German home row, the Russians have a line of fortresses. However, the Russians begin with a lot less resources and weaker units. There are five board tiles that have an objective marker. The Germans win if they capture three of these five objectives by turn five. The Russians win if they capture the German base or prevent the capture of the objectives.\n\nI began by using an Operation action card to bomb one of the Russian units. This left it with only one morale (hit point). I attacked and used an attack card which did one automatic hit to the opponent. This killed the unit, I took the ground and then attacked with my Panzer tank at another unit. Because of my first attack, I now was able to provide support to the Panzer attack. Due to more combat cards, I was able to kill this unit as well, and my Panzer took the tile which was also one of the objective tiles. On my wife's turn she started with few resources and so she did what she could, but all it did was bloody one of my units and bring a new unit into play.\n\nOn my second turn, I played an operations card that allowed me to move a unit twice. I moved the unit I first attacked with twice, and that allowed me to move deep in the map and capture a second objective marker. Finally, I made an attack got lucky with how the cards played, killed the defending unit and captured the third marker.\n\nMy wife now had a lot of resources, but she had to drive back one of my units from the objective tiles. She made one attack and severely hurt my panzer tank. She then made a second, desperate attack to dislodge it. This failed, she was out of options, and her turn ended. I won by the end of turn two. That sounds like it would be a quick game, but the game took about an hour.\n\nOur Thoughts\n\nMy Rating: 2.5 (Do not care for)\n\nMy Thoughts: I want to like this game a lot more than I do. I really like the board game/card game hybrid concept of the game. I like several of the ideas in the game as well, but the implementation is clunky and stilted at best.\n\nHer Rating: 1 (Never Want to play again)\n\nHer Thoughts: Giving this a \"1\" is being generous. The combat sequence is over the top ridiculous. Give me a couple of modifiers, and some dice to roll. All of the steps are annoying. I really dislike this game.\n\nVerdict\n\nCombined Rating: 3.5\n\nWhat can I say? We all make mistakes from time to time. Getting this game turned out to be a big misstep. I suppose the only silver lining is that I still have Allied Assault on the Xbox, and the video game version smooths out a lot of the fiddly bits of this game. When ever, I have a desire to experience the unique hybrid gameplay this game has, I can just turn the Xbox on. As far as this game goes though, we will be looking to trade it.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
