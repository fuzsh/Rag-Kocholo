The Germans in\n\nWWII had the best soldiers (arguable, but generally true in many\n\ninstances), the best equipment (not always, by any means, but consider the\n\nME-262 and the Pather tank if you need examples..), and downright spiffy\n\nuniforms, but the ruling party behind the war machine had a deplorable\n\npolitical stance that cannot *help* but factor in with the above pluses.\n\nNow, since conquering the world has an undeniable appeal among wargamers,\n\nand since the only realistic scenario for that sort of thing in the 20th\n\ncentury (WWI, in my opinion, would never have spread in a major way beyond\n\nEuropean borders, a WWIII would only be hypothetical) is the Second World\n\nWar. That said, by conventional moral standards, you lose this game when\n\nyou conquer Washington. The game could hardly throw up a text box reading:\n\n\"You've just conquered the world for fascism! Congratulations on damning\n\nhumanity to a new moral dark age!\", but that's essentially what you've just\n\ndone. Am I suggesting you not be allowed to win? Not at all. I'm just\n\nsaying that unlike winning for, say, The Empire of Star Wars fame, the\n\nconsequences of what you've done are much more palapable because they could\n\nhave occured historically, given the right combination of factors.\n\nNow, that doesn't make me *not* play Panzer General. I enjoy the game\n\nbecause I like historical wargames, but I've often found this moral\n\nsituation interesting, even if I can detatch myself from it while playing.\n\nTo me, then, this game does all it can to keep the nastier historical\n\nfactors at bay, while leaving you with pure military strategy to contend\n\nwith in an abstract fashion. That's why it's fun, and not an excercise in\n\nmoral sadomasochism.\n\nLouie Landale a écrit dans l'article\n\n\n\nSeveral points are to be stressed on.\n\nFirst, american officials didn't have a precise idea of what was a nuke\n\nbombing, and anyway, war is always an abstract thing for fat cats whatever\n\ntheir side is.\n\nSecond, Manhattan project costed a lot of bucks, and it would have been bad\n\npolicy not to demonstrate that it was spent adequately (It may seem cynical\n\nbut that's the way a bureaucracy functions)\n\nThird, in any war, specially a rather total one as was WWII, foe's tend to\n\nde-humanize each other, and probably nuke bombing japanese was not seen as\n\nsomething against humanity. Nor did japanese consider the torture of\n\nchinese, or british war prisoners as something \"against nature\". I dont'\n\nbelieve there's such thing as \"war laws\".\n\nFourth, by the time US where in position of using the bomb, the big issue\n\nwas no longer finishing up the war in japan, it was how to deal with after\n\nwar relationship, especially with USSR. Somebody said that Hiroshima &\n\nNagasaki were not closing act of WWII but opening of cold war. It was\n\nindeed a clear signal to Uncl' Joe not to touch to Western Europe (whether\n\nit was necessary/moral or not is another matter).\n\nIt is reported that in Potsdam Truman was having a hard negotiation with\n\nStalin, when he received a message saying \"babies well born\" meaning that\n\nfirst experiment of nuke bomb was a success ; its attitude shifted to total\n\nconfidence : he had a trump for the diplomatic round in progress.\n\nImho, moral very seldom take over when playing the big game.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the Japanese did not surrender\n\nprimarily because of the atomic bomb drops but because the Soviet\n\nUnion had just declared war and annihilated the bulk of their land\n\nforces in Manchuria. The Kwantung Army was the pride of the Japanese\n\nmilitary, with well over a million battle-hardened soldiers. It was\n\ncompletely wiped out in a couple of days by the Red Army. This ended\n\nany hope of continuing the fight from the mainland; once the Russians\n\nhad defeated the Manchurian forces they would have had no problem\n\nsweeping through the rest of Japanese-occupied China and Korea. This\n\nhope had been one of the main justifications for fighting for the home\n\nislands of Japan.\n\nI'm not saying the bomb had nothing to do with it, of course it\n\ndid. Nor do I have any great moral problem with them...they were a\n\nterror weapon, which all sides had used throughout the war with\n\nimpunity. But some Americans like to forget the contribution the\n\nSoviets made to the end of the war in the Pacific, in the same way\n\nthey minimize how important the Red Army was in defeating Hitler.\n\nOn 8 May 1997 13:13:12 GMT, \"Neale Davidson\" <nea...@erols.com> wrote:\n\n<snip>\n\n>Lastly, remember too that Japan didn't surrender until AFTER the\n\n>SECOND bomb was dropped, and the warning of a third such\n\n>bombing was issued.

They\n\ndidn't bomb Tokyo because they didn't want the country to plummet into\n\nanarchy, but Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both extremely significant, one\n\nfrom a industrial standpoint, and after that didn't result in a Japanese\n\nsurrender, one from a religious standpoint.\n\n>\n\n> Lastly, remember too that Japan didn't surrender until AFTER the\n\n> SECOND bomb was dropped, and the warning of a third such\n\n> bombing was issued.

The USA had only two bombs left after Nagasaki, and neither were\n\nto be used; one was to be preserved for science and one for the USSR.\n\nHirohito made the right choice, though, as even without a third nuke\n\nJapan would have suffered considerably before the inevitable surrender.\n\n> An invasion, however, would have been politically and socially\n\n> a disaster.

They\n\nwould have surrendered by '47 or '48, by which time Tokyo would be on\n\nthe verge of destruction. You're right, though, that an invasion would\n\nhave been a disaster. But I don't think the nuke was the right thing to\n\ndo. I think that that kind of weapon, the kind that causes mutated\n\nbabies and slow radiation deaths and massive human, civilian suffering\n\nshould never be used.

The Allies were superior on the ground, in the air and at sea\n\n(at least in '43 --->)\n\n2. Look at the story of chemical weapons during WWII, all major\n\nplayers had them, none used them (confirmed/large scale).\n\nThey were the only existing \"weapon of mass destruction\".\n\nHowever, nukes were harder and more expensive to make, their target\n\nwould probably have been civilian/production (Ruhr/London etc.),\n\nand the effect of early types was relatively small.\n\nConventional bombing of Germany did plenty of damage.\n\n> >> > And, if they only\n\n> >> > used it on Russians [first] would we have used it to retaliate against\n\n> >> > them?\n\n> >I think the British would have been the ones with a dilemma -- the\n\n> >Germans would have had no means to attack the U.S. with a nuke.\n\nYes they would.\n\nGranted, however, that GB would've been the easiest target.\n\n> All they would need is a rocket that is a step up from the V-2(Armed\n\n> with the nuke.V-3?).\n\nNope, the guidance system wasn't good enough. With only a few (<10)\n\nwarheads in probable production, you don't gamble.\n\nA Dornier bomber (refitted for range) could've reached the US\n\nfrom bases in Norway, making a precise delivery on, say, NY or\n\nWashington. Would've given Roosevelt/Truman something to think 'bout....\n\nBut, probably, wouldn't have made them leave the war.\n\nLook at Pearl - only \"awakened the sleeping giant\".\n\nOK, coming up on the main point: Germany couldn't build the bomb.\n\nTheir scientists didn't actually think it was possible, due to\n\nHeisenbergs (?) calculations of the critical mass for U-235.\n\nThey tried to build a nuclear reactor (and avoid being executed\n\nby their dictator). The best brains fled to the US before WWII\n\n(not counting Werner von Braun).\n\n> Either that or just put the bomb on a U-boat and sail it into New\n\n> York Harbor(or maybe up the chesapeak), since all you would need is a\n\n> bomb that is small enough to fit inside a submarine. Than all they\n\n> would have to do is avoid destoryer until they reached their target.\n\nA bomb placed under water, or on the ground, wouldn't have made\n\n\"enough\" damage, except the psychological. Also, you'd have to\n\neither drop off the bomb and flee, or die in a kamikaze mission.\n\nEnough Germans were fanatical to do this, but suicide missions\n\nwere not very common for them.\n\n--\n\ngjedrem*nospam*@hsr.no\n\nhttp://www.stud.his.no/~gjedrem/\n\nMember DNRC O-\n\nREALITY.SYS corrupted.

They have been firebombed, torpedoed, shot at, carriers\n\nsunk, fleet gone, cities in smoking ash with millions dead and you think\n\nsome experiment out on some atoll is going to impress them?\n\nIf we were in the mood for show and tell, why not gather Tojo and his reps\n\nand show him what 200 b29's could do to that atoll before we set them out\n\nto firebombing everthing? Oh, the humanity. Yet we want to do it with some\n\natomic bomb that has taken far less life than all the firebombs ore even\n\nbullets did.\n\nCripes, even after the second bomb was dropped the Japanese figured out\n\nthat people in shelters could weather it out. It was only after the\n\nintervention of the Emperorer that caused them to surrendure. And even\n\nthat was not easy, the Japanese warlords in charge contemplated a coup.\n\nThe WW2 military japanese* were total dedicates to their cause and\n\nreligion and it was miraculous that the emperorer mangaged to talk sense\n\ninto them.\n\nIt has been hotly debated whether or not the second bomb should have been\n\ndropped, but one might as well debate whether or not Dresden should have\n\nbeen fire-bombed or anything else. Given the state of mind of the Japanese\n\nmilitary, it is hard to say what the out come might have been, as the\n\nwheels of intrigue were turning. The second bomb greatly strengthened the\n\nEmporer's position. Whether or not he could have enforced his wishes only\n\nif the first bomb was dropped is a matter of speculation. At any rate, it\n\npales to what has gone on before, with the 20-30 million dead mentioned\n\nearlier. The thoughts going on in the US at the time were not how to\n\nreduce Japanese casualties, but how to reduce our own. War is war,\n\nhorrible and often unconditional. It is fortunate poison gas was not used\n\nin the field.\n\nBest Regards\n\nSteamFaxx\n\n*Note the military japanese had taken over the government in the 20's and\n\n30's. They are quite different in outlook and philosphy than the\n\ncounterparts they replaced through intimidation and assasination.

As for the Sov. to take\n\nplace and swallow the world, perhaps it was true for western Europe, but\n\nFar East?. Their basic stance in the war was to -defend- themselves from\n\nthe Germans, they suffered the most losses of all countries (China\n\nexcepted) involved, and close to singlehandedly won the war. They got\n\nsome land back lost from 1905's war, but I wouldn't dare to think they\n\nwere willing/able to invade Japan, their navy was kinda non-existent in\n\nthe Far East.\n\nA side point : IMHO, the reason the bomb was first dropped was more\n\nhuman : It was too much a temptation to use, just to see what it really\n\ndo.

In that event the western\n\nallies would probably have still been unable to contemplate deploying\n\ntheir own weapons, espescially if intelligence was able to prove that\n\nno more devices existed. If more devices were located by intelligence\n\nthen there would obviously have been greater pressure from some allied\n\nquarters to use ours pre-emptively. The heads of free governments\n\nfighting for the allies would certainly not have supported the use of\n\natomic weapons on or adjacent to their native soil regardless of any\n\nintelligence findings. Together the free nations would have formed a\n\nformidable power block which if it split from the allied cause would\n\nhave probably meant the cessation of hostilities in the west and\n\nprobably south [denying use of territories, manpower, resources etc].\n\nIt is therefore possible to see that Axis use of nuclear weapons\n\nagainst the Soviet Union could have resulted in a collapse of the\n\nAllied cause and the continuance of Nazi Germany despite its weak\n\nposition in '44-'45.\n\nGiven the allies airpower in the latter stages of the conflict it\n\nwould appear unlikely that axis could have successfully developed\n\nand/or deployed their device even if they were crazy enough to wish\n\nto. It is my view that the realists in Germany knew in 1943 that there\n\nwas no real chance of victory. It seems to me that most were fighting\n\nfor the 'honourable draw'.

And I'm not sure how you can argue that the Western\n\nFront was \"easier\" for the Allies than the Eastern one. The terrain\n\nwas harder - the entire assault depended on first on capturing a large\n\nharbor, then crossing several major rivers. The Italian advance had\n\nshown that the Germans were quite good at delaying and inflicting\n\ncasualties, even in small numbers. I think the fact the Russians\n\nreached Berlin first speaks for itself - the Western Front crumbled\n\nlast, it was not \"easier\".\n\n\n\nI don't think so, especially considering the use of massive, city-\n\ndestroying firebombings that occured in Germany. I'm pretty sure the\n\nfirebombing of Dresden would be equivalent to the use of an atomic\n\nbomb, or even worse. And then later policy showed that the use of\n\nnukes on European territory was contemplated and accepted by both\n\nsides as a credible threat (and thus a deterrent). Surely the\n\nAllies were not *less* likely to use the bomb *during* a major war\n\nthan during the Cold War...?\n\nI think the main reason that the atomic bomb was not used in Europe\n\nwas that it was not ready. The war in Europe was over in May, and\n\nthe bombs went in August. Had it gone the other way, I think Berlin\n\nwould have been bombed.\n\n> In essence the answer is that Japan was cowed in 1945, but not beaten.\n\n> Those of us who have read a litle of the period can only imagine what\n\n> the pacification of the japanese homeland would have cost in Allied\n\n> lives.

And they had already\n\nreduced most of Germany to shoulder-high rubble - literally, not\n\nfiguratively. I'm not sure you understand the devastation that was\n\ninflicted by the use of conventional weapons. In a war of that scale,\n\nthe atom bomb was just another strategic option.\n\nThey had *already*, as you put it, incinerated the land and people\n\nthey invaded. None of my relatives and friends who fought in the\n\nwar - long before I was born - has ever spoken of liberating *Germany*;\n\nthey spoke of liberating the other countries, and uniformly expressed\n\nthe passionate desire to kill as many Germans as possible. And this\n\n20 years after the war, and later. Imagine what popular opinion was\n\nlike at the time. Or look at the pictures, if you really want to know.\n\n(Please, please, please note that I am describing a mindset of the\n\nperiod, to which no sensible person subscribes today. I bring it\n\nup to point out how strongly people felt, not to denigrate or offend\n\nor insult Germans.)\n\n> No-one was fighting to liberate Japan.\n\nNeither were they fighting to liberate Germany, but to liberate the\n\ncountries it conquered, and to *subdue* - or even utterly destroy -\n\nit and it's allies.\n\nIt's interesting to note that in some arguments, Western European\n\nsocieties are credited with influencing the world through a ruthless\n\ncampaing of imperialism, sophisticated warfare, slavery and other\n\ncultural abuses. In many senses, that is based on good information;\n\nEuropeans and Americans have outstripped much of the world by virtue\n\nof aggression and technology and advantageous terrain. You are\n\narguing essentially that Western Europeans would not do terrible\n\nthings to each other (this include Americans) - this is at odds with\n\nhistory, I think. They are *more* likely to fight than other\n\nsocieties, that's how they got where they are.\n\n(Western European societies, as used above, is referring to the\n\ncultures derived from those countries in Western Europe which\n\nactively colonized large areas of the world beginning in the 17th\n\ncentury, and not to the current governments, or people, of the\n\nstates of Western Europe.

The Soviets exercised their option\n\nunder the pact by invading Poland from the east on Sept. 17, 1939.\n\nBoth Germany and the Soviet Union had prior non-agression treaties in\n\nforce with Poland when they invaded, and yes, the French and British\n\nwere required by treaty to come to Poland's aid in repelling the Soviet\n\nattack as well. Treaties are pieces of paper. Governments will hold\n\nthem up and point to them when their terms suit current purposes.

The\n\nFrench (and thus the British as their allies) had direct access to Germany\n\nand therefore could envision a plan to open a second front with Germany and\n\npunish them for their transgression against Poland. Saving Poland from\n\nconquest was never a practical option - the troops could not have been\n\nmobilized and transferred to Poland in time, and even if they could have\n\nbeen, their lines of communication would have been perilous at best.\n\nAs for the Soviet invasion, once at war with Germany, the allies could not\n\nafford to drive the Nazis and Soviets into common cause by declaring war\n\nagainst the Soviets as well. In any case, a serious offensive against the\n\nSoviets would have had to wait until Germany was defeated, so no good\n\ncould come of signalling such an intention years in advance.\n\nIf you thought the Soviets were the real devils (as Churchill did), better\n\nto bide your time and enlist their aid in defeating the Nazis first. You\n\ncould turn on them next (as I think Patton suggested...). As it turned\n\nout, by 1945 the British leadership role had diminished, the Americans were\n\nstill involved in the war against Japan, and the Soviets were far stronger\n\nmilitarily than they had been in 1939. An attack against the Soviets at\n\nthat time just wasn't in the cards.\n\nSteve"
