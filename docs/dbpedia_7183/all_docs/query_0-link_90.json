        "text": "Other support cards not literally combat ones, are used as gambits that can cripple your opponent’s hand by taking cards away from them. Combat cards are used during these fights and work as secondary support, by buffing your units’ stats or detracting the enemy’s in a variety of ways. Not all cards work well in direct battles, but once put as support units in battle, i.e, in neighboring titles next to the enemy card, they can turn the tide of a fight.\n\nA tank can easily be destroyed by a battalion of well-protected and supported foot soldiers, thanks to how the game treats support and ranged attacks dependant on unit placement on the map. Using power up cards is the one of crux of Panzer General, and proves to be one of the aspects that makes it such a fun and intelligent game.Battle outcome is decided by a variety of factors, not only firepower. Protection can also come from passive abilities and cards, like the dig in power-up that adds protection to a unit and gives the initiative to strike first in a battle started by the opposite side. Placing artillery carts in hilly zones boosts their attack power, for instance, or leaving a platoon of soldiers by lakeside lowers it. On the other hand, movement is also dependant on the terrain of the map, which not only acts as an obstacle to the movement of units in some cases, but also as an advantage. Most cards can only move in one of four directions, with the occasional diagonally enabled unit like paratroopers. Drawing cards also depends on the amount of prestige each side has, which is earned by controlling titles on the board or by destroying enemy units. Units are what you expect to see from a war game, like an assortment of tanks, artillery and foot soldiers, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and value. Cards range in value and function, and can be units that are placed directly on the board, or action cards to be used on confrontations.
