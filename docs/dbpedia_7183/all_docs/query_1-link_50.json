        "text": "By the 1990’s, turn-based strategy war games had become highly specialized with a very thin customer base. Most required a grognard’s ability to juggle multiple battle statistics at once, and had a limited visual appeal. Then, in 1994, Strategic Simulations Incorporated (SSI) released Panzer General and the wargame genre transformed into a mass market product.\n\nUnlike real-time strategy (RTS) games, turn-based strategy games permit the user time to ponder their next move without having to press the pause button. The drawback is that once you’ve committed your resources you must watch your turn – and your then your opponent’s – play out. To state the obvious, chess is an example of turn-based strategy.\n\nPanzer General offered players both single scenario play, in which they could assume the role of an Allied or an Axis general, as well as a Campaign Mode, in which the player attempts to win World War II for Germany. The campaign runs from 1939 to 1945, and as units gain battle experience, they become stronger, and the player (as general) gains access to upgrades and reinforcements – assuming they are victorious, that is. If the player achieves their scenario objectives with five or more game turns to spare, it is considered a “Major Victory,” which unlocks further game elements. Major Victories enable the player to alter history, such as invading Britain on the heels of victory in France, or even landing an invasion force in North America to capture Washington, D.C.\n\nThe game was published across several platform, including versions for the Panasonic 3D0 system, MS-DOS and Windows based computers, Sony PlayStation, and for the Macintosh. It also spawned a plethora of sequels, including: the 5-Star Series (Allied General, Fantasy General, Pacific General, People’s General, and Star General), Panzer General II, Panzer General 3D Assault, Panzer General III: Scorched Earth, and Panzer General: Allied Assault. Clearly gamers enjoyed wargames once again!\n\nPanzer General was both well-reviewed and well-received by the gaming public. Besides receiving high review scores from the critics, gamers just kept playing the game. To this day, there are sites on the Internet devoted to this game, with hundreds of scenarios, new units, and even new features. Mods are the fountain of youth for classic games, and Panzer General was no exception, as they managed to keep the game fresh and interesting years after its release. Ultimately, the game’s fabulous gameplay coupled with its genre-changing aspect make it a classic retro game that every retrogamer needs to play!"
