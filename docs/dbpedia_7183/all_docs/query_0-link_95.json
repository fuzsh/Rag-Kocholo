Whenever we are able to advance in the grid we will acquire Prestige points as a result of each turn, while through the cards relating to particular abilities we will be able to influence the parameters of our units at will, increasing their attack, defense or implementing special powers to use.\n\nDespite the predominance of the tactical component, the approach to the game structure still manages to be accessible and gradual, thanks above all to a carefully packaged tutorial that will illustrate the rules and behavior of the cards in the various situations of the conflict in the smallest details.\n\nTaking an adequate view of the grid and the conformation of the terrain will be a fundamental component to implement winning strategies and avoid possible encirclement, which will almost certainly lead to the premature loss of our platoons. The enemy forces are about to be defeated by the Allies: the dice have worked in our favor. Clearly, we will have to take care to position our troops wisely, so that we can ensure greater chances of victory in the inevitable battles with the opposing forces. Each card represents a specific section of our army with a brief description and relative dispositions of use: infantry, artillery, air forces, etc. Our aim will be to choose the cards from the deck in our possession and place them gradually within the grid placed on the battlefield. In single player mode you will be on the side of the Allies. Therefore, the territories in which the real fight took place and all the vehicles and military means used by the various armed forces will be called into question. Although we fight only through a chessboard in which to arrange the elements of our deck, the game does not take any liberties, following step by step the most significant events of the conflict.\n\nPanzer General: Allied Assault is essentially a card game in strategic sauce, set in the furious days of the Normandy Landing, which will give us the opportunity to eradicate the N**i threat from the Old Continent for the umpteenth time. The world of video games, however, continues to maintain the ability to reserve pleasant surprises, perhaps when you least expect it and, for my (and your) luck, the game developed by Petroglyph Games falls rightfully into the category of products worthy of attention.\n\nPANZER GENERAL ALLIED ASSAULT DOWNLOAD\n\nAnother game dedicated to the Second World War, in Live Arcade format and in the form of a boardgame? I have to be shamelessly honest: while I waited for the download to complete I was wondering how much boredom / frustration I would have to put up with in testing the Ubisoft title."
