Ubisoft announced today that World War II-themed card game Panzer General: Allied Assault is ready to draw from a deck of destruction this fall on XBLA. The game is being developed by Petroglyph and is a different take on the strategy game classic, to which Ubisoft apparently gained the rights after the most recent installment back in 2000.

Along with the digital game, Petroglyph will also release a physical board game with 240 action and unit cards. The game is being called a "lite" WWII game and will also be available this fall for $60. We're currently following up with Ubisoft to see if the game will be playable at GamesCom.
