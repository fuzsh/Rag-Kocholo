        "text": "Ah, Springtime! As thoughts turn to the renewal of life, love, baseball season, and whether pollen or cicadas will be the etiology of this year’s sleep deprivation, vinyl enthusiasts are looking at only one date on their calendars:\n\nThat’s right, April 20, 2024, is Record Store Day! This manufactured “holiday” was conceived to drive foot traffic into independent record stores by luring vinyl collectors with the promise of limited/exclusive pressings. Over time, it’s become a significant event for vinyl enthusiasts and record stores. While a certain over-commercialization and/or jadedness has soured a few folks on participation, it remains a celebration for most. The special Record Store Day releases, with their potential to uncover rare gems and previously unknown recordings, are only one reason to shop. Supporting your local community establishment while chatting with fellow music enthusiasts is a fun day and a great way to make new connections.\n\nJazz titles have always been a big draw across the record label spectrum on Record Store Day. In many cases, it’s an opportunity to reissue long out-of-print titles or expand on an existing classic. But when it comes to previously unreleased jazz recordings, there’s one name that’s been responsible for emptying more wallets, catalyzing more excuses for buying Kallax shelving, and setting alarm clocks for the wee hours to ensure that you’re first online at your favorite vinyl store—Mr. Zev Feldman. Zev—aka “The Jazz Detective”—is a music industry veteran. His lifelong passion for music became one of those clichés: “started in the mailroom as an intern” stories. Zev’s career took him through independent and major label experiences in sales, marketing, licensing, and distribution while working with some of the biggest names in the business. But working with the flavor of the month wasn’t his calling. Zev’s heart beats in 5/4 time as he has bebop for breakfast, blues for lunch, and captivates you with an afternoon of jazz stories before dinner. And you should see his basement.\n\nZev’s superpower is the discovery, restoration, clearance, and release of previously unknown recordings from some of the most iconic names in jazz. Zev’s work with Resonance, Blue Note, Elemental, Reel to Real, and now his own label, Jazz Detective, has brought numerous titles to life. His efforts have unearthed incredible recordings by Bill Evans, Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Grant Green, and Jaco Pastorius. Blue Note and Verve have also tapped his talents to bring unreleased live material to fans from Lee Morgan, John Coltrane, and Stan Getz—a Discogs search reveals credits on over 100 releases so far. And on this forthcoming Record Store Day—April 20, 2024—you’ll see Zev’s production credits on TEN previously unreleased jazz albums, a whopping 26 LPs, and enough photos, text, interviews, and essays in the included booklets to keep jazz fans busy until NEXT Record Store Day.\n\nThose eyeing their vinyl budgets or getting the side-eye from their significant others may wonder: what possessed Zev to drop so many compelling releases all at once? Did Zev finally lose it after all this time dealing with record label lawyers? Does he need a grippy sock vacation? Or has cumulative jet lag from his global tape vault schlepping finally caught up with him? Perhaps the local barista has been slipping edibles into his coffee! Or maybe he’s going to the mattresses with the major labels by cornering the market and starting a trade war? Surely, he’s not trying to bankrupt the jazz enthusiast community, is he?\n\nNot at all.\n\nThose of us with catalog/reissue experience know the drill all too well—do a ton of work setting the table, and then it’s a game of “hurry up and wait” while the paperwork and clearances work through the various stakeholders. This can take a frustratingly RIDICULOUS amount of time, and there’s little one can do to affect the process or plan accordingly—you have to be ready to spring into action once you get the all-clear. That can come after several weeks, months, or sometimes YEARS after you’ve gotten the ball rolling, and much to Zev’s surprise this past autumn, everything everywhere happened all at once.\n\nFor most Record Store Day rollouts, Zev and his teams would be beyond busy with just a handful of releases. So when Zev’s Thanksgiving table looked more like a cross between a ransacked record label law office and a hamster’s cage, he knew the 2024 Record Store Day challenge was a new ballgame. From our phone conversation the other day, Zev’s description of December 2023 sounded like he was living in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago during their Midnight Sun—a sleepless, frantic month of scheduling, production, proofreading, mastering, financial planning, sales projections, marketing, and PR setup. By New Year’s Eve, Zev’s blood type was Red Bull, his marketing teams were begging for mercy, and pressing plants were ready to block his number—the pace and pressure were relentless. It took a village (and then some), but all TEN releases are ready for action.\n\nFear not, those without turntables or who don’t celebrate! First of all, these are “RSD First” titles, meaning the limited run hits first on 4/20 for Record Store Day, with standard vinyl editions to follow (except for the Reel to Real titles). The following Friday, April 26, you’ll also be able to enjoy them on CD or via your chosen digital music/streaming platform. So everyone can enjoy the music, regardless of circumstance or format. Here’s the lineup and some early thoughts based on my initial spins of the vinyl that Zev’s PR teams kindly provided for review.\n\nArtist: Art Tatum\n\nTitle: Jewels in the Treasure Box: The 1953 Blue Note Jazz Club Recordings\n\nRecording Date: Aug 16-28, 1953\n\nLabel: Resonance Records\n\nNumber of Discs: 3\n\nLineup: Art Tatum-piano, Everett Barksdale-guitar, Slam Stewart-bass\n\nSound Quality: I’m SO pleased with how this one sounds! I’m not looking for an artificially juiced, digitally enhanced production for crystalline sonic perfection. I want to hear the clink of glasses, the back-and-forth between stage and audience, and feel like I’m actually there. This recording is just exactly proper in that regard. It sounds wonderful. Don’t bring the check yet—I want to stay for the next set.\n\nNotes: I have a confession to make—this is my collection's first Art Tatum record. 😳 Not that I have any issue with Tatum. I’ve just never prioritized his presence in my library. Among the many enjoyable facets of my chat with Zev was hearing how important it was to him and Resonance Records head honcho (and renowned jazzerati) George Klabin to unearth and release a great Art Tatum project. Mission accomplished. The 39 songs over six sets captured in August 1953 seem like a time machine, and the banter is priceless. Like every project Zev takes on, the booklet is a treasure trove of insights, essays, and photos. Knockout.\n\nArtist: Yusef Lateef\n\nTitle: Atlantis Lullaby: The Concert From Avignon\n\nRecording Date: July 19, 1972\n\nLabel: Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Yusef Lateef-sax/flute, Kenny Barron-piano, Bob Cunningham-bass, Albert “Tootie” Heath-drums\n\nSound Quality: Terrific. Beyond my expectations, in fact. This gig was recorded initially for INA, and it’s a great pressing, too.\n\nNotes: Lateef leads the quartet, but Kenny Barron is the player you may remember best. He’s ON FIRE!\n\nI recommend this record to hear Kenny Barron dismantle his piano with his bare hands. But there’s also this—Yusef Lateef was one of Zev’s earliest musician relationships when he got into “the biz,” so like the Art Tatum release, this one is personal. As you hear the music and flip through the booklet, which has input from the likes of Mr. Barron, Joe Lovano, Bennie Maupin, Sonny Rollins, and more, you can feel the passion for the project oozing from each page and every groove.\n\nArtist: Sun Ra\n\nTitle: At the Showcase: Live in Chicago 1976-1977\n\nRecording Date: Feb 21, 1976 | Nov 10, 1977\n\nLabel: Jazz Detective/Deep Digs Music Group/Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Sun Ra-piano, John Gilmore-tenor sax, Marshall Allen-alto sax/flute/kora, Danny Davis-alto sax/flute, Elo Omoe-alto/bass clarinet, Danny Thompson-baritone sax/flute, Michael Ray, Ahmed Abdullah-trumpet, Emmett Mcdonald-bass trumpet, Vincent Chancey-French horn, Dale Williams-guitar ‘76, Richard William-bass Luqman Ali-drums, Eddie Thomas, drums/vocal, James Jacson-Ancient Infinity Drum/oboe, Atakatune-congas, June Tyson, Cheryl Banks-Smith, and Wister (Judith Holton)-vocals\n\nSound Quality: Broadcast quality and clear enough to invoke someone in the room to ask: “When will they be through tuning up?”\n\nNotes: Fear not—they’ll never find the body of the individual who dared utter such a thing. Once they were removed from Jazz and Coffee HQ (we don’t allow Sun Ra heathens here), the rest of the outer space journey went as it should. Like most Sun Ra records, this one is unpredictable. Sun Ra fans will eat this up. Don't start here if you’re still getting up to speed on Sun Ra—other points of entry will better serve you. A current favorite is My Brother The Wind. The audience interaction put a smile on my face. It brought me back to early Phish-going days and the “Phish secret language,” where the band and frequent Phish concertgoers seemed to know something that I didn’t. Well, it wouldn’t take long before I was in on the secret, and as this Sun Ra audience makes clear, membership has its privileges.\n\nArtist: Mal Waldron & Steve Lacy\n\nTitle: The Mighty Warriors: Live in Antwerp\n\nRecording Date: Sept 30, 1995\n\nLabel: Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Mal Waldron-piano, Steve Lacy-soprano sax, Reggie Workman-bass, Andrew Cyrille-drums\n\nSound Quality: Top freakin’ shelf—this could have been recorded yesterday.\n\nNotes: Mal’s name appears above Lacy’s, which is proper, though it should be even more prominent—it’s very much the Mal show, celebrating his 70th birthday. It sounds like a celebration; everyone gets plenty of time and space to party. Mal Waldron is another character with a long career that has many twists ‘and turns across multiple labels, and his intimidating discography leaves many scratching their heads while wondering where to begin. Get this record for a terrific intro to Mal’s piano stylings and GREAT liner notes that will make you curious about where to go next. I suggest Reminiscent Suite, recently reissued as part of the J-Jazz Masterclass Series.\n\nArtist: Sonny Rollins\n\nTitle: Freedom Weaver: The 1959 European Tour Recordings\n\nRecording Date: March 2, 4, 5, 9, and 11, 1959\n\nLabel: Resonance Records\n\nNumber of Discs: 4\n\nLineup: Sonny Rollins-tenor sax; Henry Grimes-bass; Pete La Roca, Kenny Clarke, and Joe Harris-drums\n\nSound Quality: Great! It beats the bootlegs without breaking a sweat.\n\nNotes: The crown jewel of Zev’s labors for this Record Store Day is a 4-LP set containing a massive booklet filled with interviews, photos, and killer notes from Bob Blumenthal. Between this set and the expanded Rollins Vanguard set coming on Blue Note the week after RSD, it’s an embarrassment of Sonny Rollins Trio's riches. Much of this material has been kicking around via live recording/trading enthusiasts for decades, so I’m pleased that an official release with a superior sound that compensates Mr. Rollins is now available. I’ll be unpacking all that’s going on here for WEEKS.\n\nArtist: Chet Baker and Jack Sheldon\n\nTitle: In Perfect Harmony: The Lost Album\n\nRecording Date: 1972 studio session\n\nLabel: Jazz Detective/Deep Digs Music Group/Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLineup: Chet Baker and Jack Sheldon-trumpet/vocals, Jack Marshall-guitar, Dave Frishberg-piano, Joe Mondragon-bass, Nick Ceroli-drums\n\nSound Quality: Perfect. And—for those who prize this—it’s an all-analog production from beginning to end. I even jotted these notes down with a pen on paper before typing to try and make the analog feeling linger.\n\nNotes: As I’ve written in previous posts, I’m a sucker for unreleased records. I’m perpetually fascinated by how they came to be, why they got vaulted, and how their legend grows over time. This Baker/Sheldon collaboration was new—I never even knew it existed. The band is excellent, and while I’m personally not big on Baker or Sheldon’s vocals, it’s an enjoyable listen. This session also predates by a year what most jazz buffs consider Chet Baker’s “comeback” years, so from a historical perspective, if you’re a Baker fan, you’ll want to hear it.\n\nArtist: Sister Rosetta Tharpe\n\nTitle: Live in France: The 1966 Concert in Limoges\n\nRecording Date: Nov 11, 1966\n\nLabel: Deep Digs Music Group/Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Sister Rosetta Tharpe-guitar, vocal, all-around awesomeness\n\nSound Quality: Superb! Take us to church, Sister Rosetta!\n\nNotes: This one blew me away more than any other release from this year’s batch. Admittedly, I’ve had Sister Rosetta Tharpe on the brain ever since catching a snippet of her during one of the interludes on Beyonce’s latest (which I encourage you to hear without the critical pontifications from the Pitchfork wannabes). One woman, a guitar, and her voice generate so much power that this concert could bring every Monsters of Rock festival in history to its knees. Profoundly excellent. Put this one atop your list.\n\nArtist: Cannonball Adderley\n\nTitle: Burnin’ in Bordeaux: Live in France 1969\n\nRecording Date: Mar 14, 1969\n\nLabel: Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Julian “Cannonball” Adderley-alto sax, Nat Adderley-cornet, Joe Zawinul-acoustic/electric piano, Victor Gaskin-bass, Roy McCurdy-drums\n\nSound Quality: Drum heavy but good enough for government work.\n\nNotes: A long-circulating bootleg has been cleaned up and given a deluxe treatment for Record Store Day. I’ve had various copies of the bootleg cassette and digital file for ages, and I dig these performances. I’m more partial to the George Duke ‘72 version of the band, but I’m sure some prefer the Zawinul edition over Duke, too. Either way, I’m pleased that now that this is an official release, money flows to the rights holders. TBH, and my personal Adderley preferences aside, I recommend you hear both Adderley RSD titles. If you only know him from Kind of Blue or Know What I Mean?, his famous Riverside LP with Bill Evans, this is another side(?) of the Cannonball.\n\nArtist: Cannonball Adderley\n\nTitle: Poppin’ in Paris: Live at L’Olympia 1972\n\nRecording Date: Oct 25, 1972\n\nLabel: Elemental Music\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Julian “Cannonball” Adderley-alto/soprano sax, Nat Adderley-cornet, George Duke-acoustic/electric piano, Walter Booker-bass, Roy McCurdy-drums\n\nSound Quality: Great! Crank it up!\n\nNotes: George Duke is THE MAN. This band cooks! I suppose I must’ve had a high-generation cassette copy that ran a little slow—this edition significantly improved what I’d previously heard. Again, this is an excellent booklet with (like its ‘69 sibling) great liner notes by Bob Blumenthal and contributions from a who’s who of subject matter experts. Did I mention how excellent George Duke’s performance is on this record? Duke was already fully immersed in the world of Frank Zappa, and you can hear his chops at their peak here.\n\nArtist: Shelly Manne & His Men\n\nTitle: Jazz From The Pacific Northwest\n\nRecording Date: Oct 4, 1958 | Sept 7 & 15, 1966\n\nLabel: Reel to Real\n\nNumber of Discs: 2\n\nLineup: Shelly Manne-drums, Monte Budwig-bass, Russ Freeman-piano (‘58), Hampton Hawes-piano (‘66), Herb Geller-alto sax (‘58), Frank Strozier-flute/alto sax (‘66), Stu Williamson-trumpet (‘58), Conte Candoli-trumpet (‘66), Ruth Price-vocals (‘66 on two tracks)\n\nSound Quality: Terrific!\n\nNotes: I was beyond excited about this one, as I’m a HUGE fan of every live recording I’ve heard from Shelly Man & His Men. Jazz From the Pacific Northwest does not disappoint, especially Frank Strozier and Hampton Hawes on the ‘66 session and the lengthy “Quartet (Suite in Four Movements)” that takes up all of Side B. All killer, no filler! Again, the included booklet is GREAT and adds enormous value to an already excellent package. The sheer number of contributors Zev gets for these booklets is impressive. It says a great deal about the artists and Zev’s insistence on providing maximum value (and context) for the projects. And Zev seems to invite anyone who has something interesting to say. It wouldn’t have surprised me to find a quote from one of Manne’s cousins recollecting how this friendly Jewish kid from New York became one of the foremost West Coast drummers: “My cousin Shel, always banging on those pots and pans—such a racket! Did he listen to our Bubbe and find a respectable trade? No! Poll Winners, Schmoll Winners, but his other cousin? He finished top of his class at Brooklyn Law. Very successful. Single too…are you taken?” (for the humor-challenged, that’s a blatant fabrication—Shelly Manne comes from a long line of drummers)\n\nSo that’s my take on Zev’s RSD minyan. Still, if you’d like to hear it directly from the source, Zev recently sat down with author, subject matter expert, and YouTube influencer Ken Micallef on his YouTube channel to give us the rundown (embedded below). You can also hear Zev during April (Jazz Appreciation Month) on Sirius XM on Mondays at 1 p.m. ET and Wednesdays at midnight. ET, and Thursdays at 6 p.m. ET."
