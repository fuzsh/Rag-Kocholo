        "text": "I once read a Blind Fold Test interview with a jazz guitarist listening to various inspirations and peers. When they played him Wes Montgomery and George Benson the musician said that everything they played was like ice cream — everybody loves ice cream — and just because ice cream is delicious doesn’t mean its not good. He added that some listeners want to be in a special club devoted to artists who others don’t “get” — he ended with a sentiment like, “Who the hell doesn’t love ice cream???”\n\nThat sums up Chet Baker’s musical style perfectly — everything he played was ice cream. His playing is easy to like — you understand it instantly, and, even people who don’t listen to much jazz at all still listen to Chet Baker (and lately I have seen him included on many lists of favorite artists of younger hip-hop and R&B acts). Everybody loves ice cream and that universal appeal doesn’t make it bad.\n\nA highly lyrical player, Chet, like the more technically accomplished Stan Getz and Bill Evans, made strong melodies even more beautiful when he played them and then crafted improvised solos that sounded like continuations of the melody. If this was easy to do everybody would do it. Lyricism is an ability. Baker himself was hurt that critics didn’t recognize his major strength — he felt he picked “the right notes to play.”\n\nTo this day Baker is often slagged off as an imitator of 1950s Miles Davis — only Miles kept evolving and Chet did not. But, Miles’ super strength was evolving and Baker was born with a gift for melody. Interestingly, the pronounced Miles influence came a little later with Chet. To hear the most original playing Chet Baker ever did you need to go back to the very beginning — at the dawn of the 1950s. First, check out his sides with Gerry Mulligan’s pianoless quartet. Then, jump right over to his first batch of recordings as a solo artist, four platters of which are captured on the vinyl box set The Complete Pacific Jazz Studio Recordings Of The Chet Baker Quartet With Russ Freeman.\n\nPacific Jazz is the label most associated with the 1950’s West Coast Cool sound. Label chief Richard Bock signed Gerry Mulligan when he had his groundbreaking pianoless quartet with Chet Baker, and then kept each artists as solo acts (he also signed Chico Hamilton, the quartet’s first drummer, who went on to became a star group leader and composer in his own right). Pacific Jazz did not have a huge roster but they signed the right people at the right time. Besides Jeru, Chet, and Chico, the label also released the likes of Bud Shank, Jim Hall, Clifford Brown, Art Pepper, and The Mastersounds (basically the Montgomery Brothers minus breakout star guitarist Wes). BTW, Clifford Brown was the horn player who Baker held in the highest esteem.\n\nPacific Jazz also got hip to the World music scene early, putting out Ravi Shankar in the Eisenhower 1950s, and releasing samba-meets-jazz recordings by Bud Shank and Laurindo Almeida. These West Coast “jazz folk-samba” meetings between an American saxophonist and a Brazilian guitarist would had little impact in the States. But, they would go on to have a profound effect on a group of free-thinking jazz listeners down in Rio, including Antonio Carlos Jobim. As the Cool jazz era ended, Pacific leaned hard into Los Angeles’ blacker Central Avenue sound with Groove Holmes, Gene Ammons, The Jazz Crusaders, and Gerald Wilson, a modernistic big band composer who combined the Duke-Meets-The-New side of Charles Mingus with the ten-barrel bombast of Stan Kenton.\n\nBut throughout the 1950s Pacific Jazz was very cool indeed and Chet Baker was their poster boy.\n\nArt\n\nMosiac box sets are highly respected, especially when it comes to the music they contain. They were definitely a bare-bones operation in the 1980s and ’90s, though, especially when it came to printing up the art. This Baker box is one of their better looking sets, mainly because Chet was better looking himself and also because the photo used was taken by the great William Claxton.\n\nWilliam Claxton was the star photographer at Pacific Jazz Records. Like most photographers of the time, Clax started shooting jazz concerts and sessions as a fan of the music. He jumped from shooting Chet Baker into a very successful portraiture career in fashion, advertising, print, and Hollywood. Much of Clax’s work is still widely seen, including his snaps of Chet and Steve McQueen (who was also a personal friend). A Los Angeles native, Clax’s cool, relaxed imagery helped shape the image of West Coast jazz and a clean, healthy, but still sexy, California lifestyle back when Manhattan still largely dominated America’s image of cultural life.

There is another Mosaic box set dedicated to the Baker/Freeman quartet’s official live sessions. Plus, the two recorded with larger groups together for Pacific Jazz, and other labels, as well. I’d recommend all of this material, starting right here with these quartet studio sides.\n\nChet Baker came to fame at around 21 years of age with Gerry Mulligan, who was the musical director of their quartet. Mulligan had been a respected jazz insider playing, composing, and crafting arrangements for Miles Davis on the aptly titled Birth of the Cool sessions and for other artists. But, the relaxed, yet dazzling, counterpoint solos between his baritone sax and Chet Baker’s trumpet made overnight stars of them both when they got together. They didn’t have a piano to lay down a net of chords and catch them when they fell — they just never fell. Ironically, it was partially Mulligan’s drug bust that ended the quartet — Chet was still living clean back then.\n\nWhen Baker went solo, the pianist Russ Freeman was his musical director and the structure of their quartet offered a more standard be-bop setting then Mulligan’s. The soloing in both quartets were totally different so instead of the snaking, intertwining counterpoint of the Mulligan sessions, Freeman and Baker politely took turns soloing. Still, Mulligan and Freeman, each classically trained, were struck by Chet’s natural improvisational ability. They each noted that Chet would unknowingly “break music rules” but that it always ended up sounding and feeling right. Baker also learned new tunes instantly, without the need of sheet music. Play him a new song once and he had the melody down, understood the chords, and could record it. Even Herbie Hancock was surprised when he cut a number with Chet — this is not common.\n\nThis is something else that today’s critics forget – Chet Baker came on the scene with a really rare ability, even in the jazz world, to improvise creatively every single night. Percussionist Larry Bunker, who followed Chico Hamilton in the pianoless quartet, and, who along with Shelly Manne, also plays drums on these sessions, said that “Baker could come up with something every night, every set, that would just bring you out of your seat. He was a stunning, creative musician, but a horse’s ass as a human being.” As a side note, Larry Bunker matched Chet’s improvisational talents to those of Bill Evans, who he played drums with for an 18 month stretch in the 1960s. But, even though the two soloists would develop very similar drug problems, Bunker viewed Bill Evans as a “personal hero” and Baker as a jerk.\n\nAnd, Baker was an asshole before drugs — he was clean during this entire period. That said, maybe the lack of hard drugs in his life also had something to do with the strength and vitality in his playing at this point. But, even here he wasn’t a particularly muscular or technically dazzling trumpet player compared with Dizzy Gillespie, Harry James, or even Art Farmer, another highly melodic favorite of mine who would go on to work with Gerry Mulligan. But, Chet is very quick on his feet and keeps a pure tone while offering up playing that most often hits that Baby Bear spot of sounding “just right.”\n\nThe platters included in this box set all pulled mainly from the below albums:\n\nRuss Freeman was a gifted pianist who was equally at home playing be-bop, tinkling the ivories in a vamping, bluesy style, or getting impressionistic on ballads. Freeman was also a gifted tunesmith with a knack for penning bright, upbeat numbers and slow, introspective songs. Check out the breadth of tunes (and the playing) between the frisky “Bea’s Flat” (where Chet charges ahead of the beat), the romp “Maid In Mexico,” which starts out with a complex Latin-ate beat and then shifts to 4/4 swing time, and the bomping, mid-tempo “An Afternoon At Home” . All of these numbers have a different feel to them — and are approached differently by the musicians. For how well Freeman and Chet do on the film noir ballad sound that would go on to define Baker’s career check out the ballad “The Wind” from a fine strings album they did for Columbia. “The Wind” remains Russ Freeman’s most recorded composition. Even here, this stately, cinematic ballad doesn’t remain lugubrious – it is full of optimistic, swinging playing as well as if happy memories blow in on the breeze that trails a melancholy autumn wind.\n\nThat bright mood is matched by Chet’s playing here — these tunes are very 1950s but they don’t sound or feel like 1950s East Coast cool jazz. The playing here, by everyone involved, is light, swift and sunny bop. A fair amount of credit goes to bandleader Russ Freeman though as with everyone involved with Chet Baker, he says that the trumpeter understood every tune, tempo change, and emotional shift intuitively. Like Baker, Freeman had played with Charlie Parker when he was in California. Freeman also worked with a number of West Coast jazz leaders, among them modernist arranger Pete Rugolo (who produced Miles’ Birth Of The Cool sessions) and Jimmy Giuffre, a gifted musician who went from being a Cool jazz star to being an early innovator of avant-garde jazz. I have no idea why Freeman’s recording dates trail off in the mid 1960s as he lived a long life all the way through 2002 but maybe he just lost enthusiasm for the business.\n\nRuss Freeman, who shares a name with a popular smooth jazz guitarist, had his longest associations with Chet, Shelly Manne, and Art Pepper. Of those three, only Shelly Manne was as beloved for his sense of fair play and respect for his fellow musicians, and humans in general, as he was for his musicianship. From what I have read, people spoke highly of Russ Freeman as well.\n\nChet Baker’s most famous sessions are part of this fine box set too — Chet Baker Sings, later expanded into Chet Baker Sings And Plays. This is the Chet most people know and love though it took a long time for these sessions to become universally beloved classics. Instead of cool modernism, and original tunes, you get Chet on the standards he grew up with, mainly 1940s Sinatra, put through a filter of 1950’s cool. The tracks here are enhanced by how Baker plays his trumpet before and after he sings and how his singing connects to his trumpet playing when he’s not. He doesn’t sound like Louis Armstrong at all but he shares this trumpet/voice synergy. Plus, for a guy who doesn’t have much of a voice, he sounds fantastic.\n\nA combination of the stripped down horn playing on these vocal sessions and the more complex bop of the instrumental sessions would define Chet Baker going forward as much as the Miles Davis comparisons would.\n\nPart of this may also be connected to Baker’s history of drug use because there are many times throughout the decades when he was clean where his soloing returns to being faster, more fluid, and brigher. I have a large selection of Chet Baker on vinyl but nowhere near all of them are essential. That said, its nice to have different flavors of ice cream available.\n\nI’d highly recommend the box set of the complete Barclay sessions Chet cut in Paris soon after most of these Pacific Jazz recordings. Likewise, Baker cut a fantastic LP for Ornette Coleman’s Artists House label a couple decades later in the 1970’s. I’d say the same for a live session from the early 1980s with a vital Chicago trio led by pianist Bradley Young. In the liner notes, Young recalls how nice it was having Chet hang out with him and his parents all week before their sets. A misconception about Chet was that he wasn’t that interested in music — but it consumed him. Chet was very happy to talk about music with younger guys from the Rock Generation. That said, it slowly dawned on Bradley Young that the temporarily clean Baker was actively looking to hang out with sober people so he wouldn’t be tempted to return to drugs. He always returned to them.\n\nI could go on recommending a lot more Chet Baker sessions but lets save it for another dozen posts or so. Even when he wasn’t playing at full strength Chet Baker’s playing was like ice cream — so easy to love and get joy from.\n\nStill, there is a sense of pure fun and sun-dappled optimism to these Pacific Jazz quartet sessions with Russ Freeman that I don’t know if Chet Baker ever quite captured again.\n\n— Nick Dedina"
