        "text": "This 4-album, 50-song set is a monumental achievement by both Clifford Brown himself, as well as transcriber Erik Veldkamp. Here, trumpeter Clifford Brown is heard on the most significant recordings from the first half of his tragically brief career. Whether co-leading a date with altoist Lou Donaldson, playing as a sideman with trombonist J.J. Johnson, interacting with an all-star group of West Coast players, or jamming with the first edition of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, Brown is the main star. Highlights are many, including versions of “Brownie Speaks,” Elmo Hope’s “De-Dah,” “Cherokee,” “Get Happy,” “Daahoud” and “Joy Spring.”\n\nThis book is a part of the highly ambitious Erik Veldkamp project to completely transcribe every note Clifford Brown ever put on record. You get the full tunes, complete with chord changes, expertly engraved, and ready for you to drop the needle and play along to your favourite records. Check out the full song list below, play some samples for free to the left, then grab an immediate PDF download above.\n\n50 Song Set-List"
