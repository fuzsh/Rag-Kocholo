        "text": "Pacific Jazz Labelography\n\nBSNPub seem to have difficulty in describing with words what is much more efficiently achieved with simple pictures\n\n“The first Pacific Jazz label was black with silver print and logo. “Pacific Jazz” on two lines above the center hole. This label was used from the start of the label to 1957 when the name of the label was changed to World Pacific. The second Pacific Jazz label was black with silver print used for monaural releases. “Pacific Jazz” on one line above the center hole. There is a silver bar across the center with the “World Pacific” logo. Stereo releases use a blue label with silver print. “Pacific Jazz” logo in silver above the center hole. There is a silver band through the center of the label with the “World Pacific” logo. On the left side is a silver vertical strip with the word “Stereo”. This label was used on Pacific Jazz 1 to approximately 100. The third label was used on the 10000/20000 series, it was black, orange and yellow with a blue, white and black logo to the left of the center hole.”\n\nGot that? Why people insist on trying to use words to communicate what pictures do effortlessly with flawless accuracy. May be they can’t take pictures, though that is a pretty weak justification in the 21st Century, when everything is “visual” On with the pictures.\n\n1.1 Black DG mono (1955) red vinyl\n\n1.2 Red “Mark 4” label – DG (1957)\n\nPrior to the name change to World Pacific, Pacific Jazz introduced a short-lived series, consisting of a dozen titles, at a suggested retail price of $3.98 in place of the regular $4.98 under the code name Mk4. The distinctive red labels were overprinted with giant Roman numerals, leaving a confused jazz buying public wondering exactly who “MIV” was.\n\n1.3 Pacific Jazz, date unknown, probably around 1956, deep groove\n\n2. World Pacific (1957)\n\nIn 1957 the label changed its name to World Pacific. A small logo box with an outline elipse and the legend World Pacific Records appears, however the former name Pacific Jazz remains prominent. A horizontal band of silver the width of the spindle hole is incorporated into the label design, separating the artist names from the song titles.\n\n2.1 World Pacific Black DG mono\n\nThe mono series is black with silver band, the stereo is blue with silver band and narrow vertical slice on left edge\n\nPicture as found online\n\n2.2 World Pacific Records – DG – 1958\n\nGiant logo for World Pacific displaces the Pacific Jazz name, in a classic serif font, and the ellipse is now a fully formed record disc shape. Other variants update the font to a more “modern” sans serif font, and there are many ad-hoc design changes, all of which indicates a preoccupation with design trivia, and a lack of understanding of strong continuous branding found in the East Coast labels like Blue Note and Prestige.\n\nBoth Blue and Black variants appear to be mono, in a typically Californian way, perhaps according to how the designer was feeling that day\n\nSome Stereo titles appear in a luxury Gold label. It’s STEREO phonic.\n\nPhoto as found online\n\n2.3 Pacific Jazz – bold sans-serif font – 1/3rd vertical line partition (early Sixties)\n\nThe mono (High Fidelity) equivalent is black, the stereo is blue, which makes sense, but the numbering system is chaotic. I blame all that sunshine.\n\n3. The Division of Liberty years (1965-70)\n\nNew PJ logo – A Product of Liberty Records"
