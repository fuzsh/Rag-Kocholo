        "text": "Great Pacific Jazz Band 1958-61\n\nGreat Pacific Jazz Band was a nine-piece group with second cornet and two banjos, consisting largely of former Bay City Jazz Band musicians.\n\nGPJB was among numerous Frisco Trad Jazz ensembles modeled on Lu Watters Yerba Buena Jazz band, that were formed in the Fifties and Sixties.\n\n(Not to be confused with Bob Ringwald's later Great Pacific band based in Los Angeles, 1979-95.)\n\nSincere thanks to\n\nJoe Spencer for providing the audio and photos from Lee Valencia on this page.\n\nOrganized by Charlie Sonnanstine and Robin Wetterau, Great Pacific Jazz Band played venues primarily at Muir Beach and Stinson Beach north of San Francisco, or at the Monkey Inn. The tape below originated with Ed Sprankle whose notes suggest they were playing there one or two nights per week from April through October of 1960.\n\nAround this time Charlie Sonnanstine switched from trombone to cornet, which he played for more than 30 years. He and pianist Robin Wetterau wrote out several dozen lead sheets and arrangements of obscure traditional jazz numbers, as well as several originals for the Great Pacific. Their transcriptions became the book for many subsequent bands in the Trad Jazz genre, and were recorded by Ted Shafer's Jelly Roll Jazz Band in the mid-1960s.\n\nNotable personnel included horn players Frank Goulette, Charlie Sonnanstine, Birch Smith and Bob Hodes; clarinetists Roy Giomi and Phil Howe; Sanford Newbauer and Bob Short trombones; banjo players Tito Patri and Lee Valencia. Dick Lammi, Walt Yost and Bill Carpender played tuba. Lloyd Byasse was the band's drummer, and had been in the Bay City and and Canal Street bands. Bret Runkle occasionally sat in on washboard.\n\nThanks to Hal Smith for assistance.\n\nJoe Spencer comments:\n\n\"The GPJB never really evolved into its full potential due to a lack of gigs. Robin and Charlie both worked for a piano shop in San Francisco and tried to find gigs. Monkey Inn was probably the most steady—for several months, but often they only had one cornet: Charlie. By late 1960 or early 1961 the Sonanstines embarked for London and Robin and Amber followed soon after. The final gig (actually a party at the Patri School) took place in August 1961.\"\n\n\"Bob Helm was quite friendly with Robin and Charlie and participated in some of their initial rehearsals in the basement of the City Lights book store on Broadway in SF. Bob was also playing with Ev and the Bay City at the time, and might have joined the GPJB, but in mid-May 1958, just before the band’s first job, he rejoined Turk. (Sonnanstine and Mayl had traveled to San Francisco in 1950 and sat in with Lu in the dying days of Hambone’s. Flora Sonnanstine told me that Lu had actually offered Charlie the trombone job full-time but he decided to go back to Ohio.)\"\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nCharlie and Robin had earlier been with the Red Onion JB in NYC 1952-53, and the Dixieland Rhythm Kings in Ohio 1953-55.\n\nA very young Bob Neighbor was also one of the band cornetists, and Jerry Fredgren one of the tuba players.\n\nARCHIVE MUSIC\n\nGreat Pacific\n\nJazz Band\n\nMonkey Inn 4.10.1960\n\nCharlie Sonnastine and Frank Goulette (cornets)\n\nRoy Giomi (clarinet)\n\nSanford Newbauer (trombone)\n\nRobin Wetterau (piano)\n\nLee Valencia and Tito Patri (banjos)\n\nBill Carpender (tuba)\n\nLloyd Byassee (drums)\n\nPhoto: Sanford Newbauer and Frank Goulette\n\nPrecious Lord.mp3\n\nWorking Man Blues.mp3\n\nMessin' Around.mp3\n\nOriginal Jelly Roll Blues.mp3\n\nBay City.mp3\n\nFroggie Moore.mp3\n\nGreat Pacific Stomp.mp3 (band original)\n\nSweet Baby Doll.mp3\n\nSnake Rag.mp3\n\nPerdido Street Blues.mp3\n\nWashboard Wiggles.mp3\n\nI'm a Little Blackbird.mp3\n\nArab Strut.mp3\n\nFriendless Blues.mp3\n\nEmperor Norton's Hunch.mp3\n\nJazzin' Babies Blues.mp3\n\nMabel's Dream.mp3\n\nAntigua Blues.mp3\n\nTuxedo Rag.mp3\n\nOriginal recording by Ed Sprankle.\n\nPhotos and audio transfer thanks to Joe Spencer.\n\nJoe Spencer further adds:\n\n\"Clarinetist Frank Powers has quoted Charlie as saying that he didn’t believe in too much improvisation in Trad Jazz. Though it sounds odd, I think he meant that in the same way Jelly Roll, in the Victor studio, told the Peppers to 'just play those little dots of mine.' Charlie and Robin both felt that Carl Halen (cornet), by the mid-1950’s had gone too Chicago, and his band was too busy. Charlie once commented about the Gin Bottle Seven to the effect that, 'there are only so many notes in the chords and everyone can’t play them all'.”\n\n\"After Robin left San Francisco in August 1961 and the GPJB disbanded, Phil Howe tried to carry on with a group called the Classic Jazz Band, with Bob Neighbor, Mike Starr, and Carpender among others. The band never played a gig but Ed Sprankle taped two rehearsals at Carpender’s house. Howe was playing beautifully at that time.\"\n\nThe archival recordings heard on these pages contain musical and technical flaws,\n\nand are offered as historic artifacts.\n\nARCHIVE AUDIO\n\nMonkey Inn 10.14 & 10.20.60\n\nJoe Spence: \"Chelsea on Down is by Robin. Supposedly based on a lament by Robin in the 1950s about the terrible drive from Boston to NYC. He noted that there wasn't a decent restaurant from ‘Chelsea on down.' The phrase stuck in his mind and he used it to name the tune.\"\n\nSubs:\n\nPhil Howe (clarinet)\n\nWalt Yost (2nd cornet as noted: 2tpt)\n\nWeeping_Willow-2tpt_Great_Pacific_JB.mp3\n\nMessin_Around_Great_Pacific_JB.mp3\n\nMerrymakers_Twine_Great_Pacific_JB.mp3\n\nMabels_Dream-2tpt_Great_Pacific_JB.mp3\n\nChelsea on Down_Great_Pacific_JB.mp3\n\nGreat_Pacific_JB_10.14.60_complete.mp3 18:32\n\nRight: Drawing of Wetterau by Sonnanstine, 1954\n\nRecordist Ed Sprankle kept detailed rundown sheets of his many Monkey Inn recordings of GPJB.\n\nThey document the band's personnel and appearances there during mid-1960.\n\nThanks Joe Spencer.\n\nARCHIVE MUSIC\n\nGPJB Final Gig & Party at the Patri art school 8.19.61\n\nThe band ended, not with a whimper but a bang!\n\nFrank Goulette and Bob Neighbor (cornets)\n\nTony Landphere (trombone, out on Palmer’s GG and El Producto)\n\nRoy Giomi and Phil Howe (clarinet)\n\nRobin Wetterau (piano, co-leader)\n\nLee Valencia and Tito Patri (banjos)\n\nJerry Fredgren (tuba)\n\nLloyd Byassee (drums)\n\nBlack Bottom Stomp.mp3\n\nEl Producto.mp3 (band original)\n\nPalmers Georgia Grind.mp3\n\nSunset Café Stomp.mp3\n\nWeary Way Blues.mp3\n\nThis page is under construction.

Possibly reflecting their sense of humor, or poor spelling, the Banjo parts in the arrangements are labeled 'Banji'.\"\n\nBanji players, Lee Valencia and Tito Patri\n\nSanford \"Mick\" Newbauer\n\nFrank Goulette\n\nand Roy Giomi\n\nAround this time Goulette was running the similarly-styled Original Inferior Jazz Band playing at The Honeybucket and Burp Hollow in San Francisco.\n\nSanford Newbauer\n\nLee Valencia\n\nOld Friends:\n\nCharlie Sonnanstine\n\nLloyd Byassee\n\nRobin Wetterau\n\nCourtesy Joe Spencer\n\nRelated band:\n\nPhil Howe's Classic Jazz Band\n\nPhil Howe's Classic Jazz Band, November 1961\n\nâ¨â¨This band never performed in public. These rehearsal sessions were a failed attempt to continue the Great Pacific Jazz Band of Sonnanstine and Wetterau.

However, he was capable of playing great ensemble parts, with an appropriate period sound when he performed with Turk Murphy, the Swinging A's and other traditional groups.\"\n\nLinks to related (this site):\n\nYerba Buena Jazz Band\n\nBurp Hollow tapes\n\nThe Honeybucket tapes\n\nMonkey Inn tapes"
