        "meta_description": "The Pacific Jazz Group by The Pacific Jazz Group, released 23 June 2023\n\n1. Bernie&#39;s Tune\n2. Maid in Mexico\n3. Line For Lyons\n4. Casa De Luz\n5. Festive Minor\n6. Nights at the Turntable\n7. Utter Chaos\n\nI spent many years living in the Bay Area. During that time, I developed a special affection for the music of the Pacific Jazz Label, an LA-based record company that started in 1952 and carried on through the 60&#39;s as World Pacific Records. West Coast jazz, people called it. And it was a thing. It was characterized often by the lack of a chordal instrument even though there were pianists and guitarists on the label, as well. The music itself was usually not difficult or intricate and the playing was more about sounding cool than blowing minds with awesome virtuosity. It was laid back and felt good. Some of the cats on the roster - Shorty Rogers, Shelly Manne, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Russ Freeman, Hampton Hawes, Bud Shank, Paul Desmond, Jim Hall, Chico Freeman, Jimmy Giuffre, Victor Feldman and Cal Tjader. The music reminds me of taking a drive down Highway 1 on a sunny day, of Golden Gate Park, of the beautiful redwoods of Muir Woods and Big Sur, of concerts by the sea on a Sunday afternoon. Even though the label was in LA, the music was the soundtrack for my time in Oakland and San Francisco.",
