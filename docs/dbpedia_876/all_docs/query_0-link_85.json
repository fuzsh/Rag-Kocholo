        "text": "Often as important as the musicians who recorded for jazz companies were the individual producers. They secured their places in jazz history through their selection of artists and attention to a specific area or category of music. One such producer is Richard Bock of Pacific Jazz, whose vitality and craft produced a unique body of recordings and began the evolution of cool jazz.\n\nLike so many stories about the birth of a jazz record label, the Pacific Jazz story started small—with the passions of a solitary man. Richard Bock was still a student at Los Angeles City College when he got work doing odd jobs for Albert Marx, owner of Discovery Records. There, at an Art Pepper session, he had his first taste of producing. And soon he was out each night, combing the jazz clubs of L.A., his feelers alert for fresh talent.\n\nThat’s where he first heard Gerry Mulligan. Bock convinced Mulligan to let him record some experimental sessions in his accountant’s living room. Immediately, Bock knew what he had. He talked some friends into pooling their money to start a record label with a focus on the cool jazz sound. And in 1952, Mulligan’s living-room recordings became the first Pacific Jazz singles.\n\nSoon Bock was recording Gerry Mulligan’s regular Monday night gig at the Haig. Because the Haig’s piano was removed to make room for Red Norvo’s vibes, the Mulligan Quartet developed without a piano. Within six months, Mulligan’s new music was written up in Time magazine, and suddenly the fledgling Pacific Jazz label had a “big time” success on its hands with the growing popularity of cool jazz.\n\nThen, Bock’s stock split. Chet Baker left Mulligan to form his own quartet with Russ Freeman, giving Pacific Jazz two hot groups instead of one. And a few months after that, Baker started singing, making him one of the hottest attractions in all of jazz.\n\nJust 18 months after his first living-room sessions, Dick Bock was running Los Angeles’ most important and successful jazz label. As such, he had his pick of local talent, and Pacific Jazz became the first label to record Wes Montgomery, Chico Hamilton’s ground-breaking cello quintet, Jim Hall, Joe Pass, Don Ellis, Richard Groove Holmes, Les McCann, Bud Shank, Bobby Hutcherson, and a host of others.\n\nIn 1954, Richard Bock began recording a series of albums featuring Laurindo Almeida and Bud Shank, which wedded jazz and Brazilian samba rhythms. This was “Bossa Nova” eight years before it had a name. The visionary Bock also recorded many landmark non-jazz recordings, including Indian classical music by Ravi Shankar, comedy by the legendary Lord Buckley, and blues by the great Lightning Hopkins.\n\nToday it’s hard to imagine the history of jazz without the cool jazz music movement that Richard Bock helped preserve. Hard to believe, too, that it began as humbly as it did, in an accountant’s living room and in one man’s heart."
