Mulligan was emphatic that for the sound he wanted he required just a snare drum and hi-hat cymbal, with a small tom-tom to give a light bass-drum effect. Hamiltonâ€™s deft brushwork and gentle touch on this minimal set-up became a key ingredient in the sound of one of the most influential and revolutionary of all jazz groups.
