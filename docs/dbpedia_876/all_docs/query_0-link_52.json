        "text": "THE 45-600 SERIES\n\nOur initial post examined the 78 RPM single line and the 45 RPM singles that were issued at the same time. We left off with 45-627 (label images still being sought) which was the last 78 single released, PJ-627, the Clifford Brown Ensemble. The 45-600 series would continue to be utilized by Bock, covering single tracks from selected LPs. Sometimes the material would be from the same LP release, other times different artists and LPs would be chosen and combined on a single 45 release. Our research indicates that X655 (the 45- prefix was dropped with X630) was the last number used in this series, and we have not discovered any releases beyond this number in the 45-600 series.\n\nThis series would also reflect the name change in 1957 to World Pacific and some of the labels displayed below exhibit the same numerical issue with the new labels.\n\nThe Steve White Quartet issued on 45-629 was not selected from an LP release. An edited version of MY NEW JET PLANE would be issued again in the 600 series on X651, backed by a Wes Montgomery selection. The flip side of 45-629, SWING EASY, was the only release of this item.\n\nThe insertion note above and below the World Pacific logo states – “A Musical Highlight From The 12” High Fidelity Long Play Album P-2007” but the P-2000 series contained only six releases ending with P-2006. The David Allyn (Allen) album originally issued in the Mark IV series would be reissued as WP-1295 with a new cover.\n\nThe Chico Hamilton vocal on X649 was not included on the 12″ LP with Freddie Gambrell. PENNY-WHISTLE BLUES on X653 is an edited version of A TRIBUTE TO THE AFRICAN PENNY WHISTLE from PJX 5000, issued on LP in South Africa only until it was included in the Mosaic Bud Shank set. The last label seen above with David Allen selections was a DJ promo item only."
