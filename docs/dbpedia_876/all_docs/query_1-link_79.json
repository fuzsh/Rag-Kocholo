        "text": "NEW YORK — Foreststorn ‘‘Chico’’ Hamilton, an influential jazz drummer and band leader who was an architect of the West Coast cool jazz style and a discoverer of key young talent, died Monday. He was 92.\n\nA National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master who was saluted as a Living Jazz Legend by the Kennedy Center, Mr. Hamilton recorded more than 60 albums as a band leader, beginning in the 1950s, and also appeared in and scored films.\n\nHe continued playing into his 90s and recorded an album ‘‘Inquiring Minds’’ last month with his Euphoria ensemble.\n\nSome of the future jazz stars nurtured in his bands included guitarists Jim Hall, Gabor Szabo, and Larry Coryell, saxophonists Eric Dolphy and Charles Lloyd, and bassist Ron Carter.\n\nBorn in 1921 in Los Angeles, Mr. Hamilton performed in a high school jazz band that included saxophonist Dexter Gordon, bassist Charles Mingus, and other classmates destined to become jazz greats. He told jazz writer Marc Myers that he believes he acquired the name Chico because ‘‘I was always a small dude.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe worked as a sideman in the 1940s with Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, and others. He toured with singer Lena Horne from 1948-55 and did studio work with bands in Los Angeles.\n\nThat’s where he hooked up with baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan in 1952. Mr. Hamilton’s subtle, creative drum playing was a key component of Mulligan’s groundbreaking piano-less quartet featuring trumpeter Chet Baker that was pivotal in the creation of the mellower, more lyrical West Coast cool jazz sound. Mr. Hamilton’s understated, seductive approach to the drums contrasted with the driving, hard-bop style typified by East Coast drummer Art Blakey.\n\n‘‘I’ve always seen the drums as a melodic instrument, not a percussive one,’’ Mr. Hamilton said in 2009. ‘‘I developed a touch. It may not be as loud but it’s mine.’’\n\nAmong those inspired by Mr. Hamilton was Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, who as a teenager heard a recording by Mulligan’s quartet.\n\n‘‘As it happened, Chico Hamilton was playing drums on the first record I bought,’’ Watts said in a Los Angeles Times interview. ‘‘I can’t really explain how the music made me feel. It was just something with the sound of the brushes. But I just fell in love with it.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1955, Mr. Hamilton began his career as a band leader. He recorded his first album as a leader of a trio with bassist George Duvivier and guitarist Howard Roberts. All three were soloists rather than strictly rhythm section players.\n\nLater that year, he formed an unusually instrumented chamber jazz quintet — which included cellist Fred Katz, flutist Buddy Collette, and guitarist Hall — that became one of the most influential West Coast jazz bands and gained national prominence.\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Hamilton was a founding member of the jazz faculty at the New School University, where his students included John Popper of Blues Traveler and Eric Schenkman of the Spin Doctors.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
