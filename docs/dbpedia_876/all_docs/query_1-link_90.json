        "text": "2018 Japanese CD reissue. Originally released 1955.\n\nIt is doubtful that any other combo leader in jazz has made the jump from sideman to maestro more rapidly or more successfully Than Chico Hamilton. The Los Angeles-born drummer, a sideman with name bands throughout the 1940s and subsequently a member of Lena Horne's accompanying trio for several years, did not really get into action as a leader until 1955, when he formed his quintet.\n\nTheir initial impact undoubtedly was helped by the quintets instrumentation. With Chico on drums, Buddy Collette on flute, clarinet and saxes, Fred Katz, cello, Jim Hall, guitar, and Carson Smith, bass, they presented an innovative sound."
