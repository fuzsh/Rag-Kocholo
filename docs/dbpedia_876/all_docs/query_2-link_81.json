        "text": "Jazz Crusaders (1960-1970) discography\n\nThis is a discography of albums by the Jazz Crusaders released between 1961 and 1970 and compilations that collect tracks from those albums..\n\nThe Jazz Crusaders were formed in Los Angeles in 1960 by a group of musicians from Houston. These musicians, Wilton Felder, Wayne Henderson, Joe Sample and Stix Hooper, were the core members of the group through the 1960's. The group released a series of albums on Pacific Jazz between 1961 and 1969.\n\nIn 1971 the group name was shortened to The Crusaders and the musical direction of the band changed. This group performed and recorded through the 1970s and periodically afterwards. Wayne Henderson revived the Jazz Crusaders name for a group he started in 1995 but, other than the name, there was little connection with the 1960s group. Discographies for the Crusaders and the 1990s Jazz Crusaders will be listed on a separate pages if added to the site."
