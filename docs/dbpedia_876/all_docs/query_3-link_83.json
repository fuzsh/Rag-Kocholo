As for the rest of your post, well, I think another side's earlier posts suffice as replies.\n\nthe musicians create the movements or the styles, the nicknames are attached by critics and marketing types who have to categorize stuff or get real jobs.\n\nthe main problem with the west coast jazz moniker is that's it's become a somewhat pejorative term for jazz that is seen to somehow be lacking in passion or grit- not the real thing. this is partly a racial code too. of course anyone using their ears will know that there was some fascinating music made on both coasts (and in many places in between)."
