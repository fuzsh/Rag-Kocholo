        "text": "Pacific Jazz: short company history\n\nThe Pacific Jazz label was founded in Los Angeles in 1952 by Richard Bock and drummer Roy S. Harte, initially to release West Coast jazz, including musicians such as Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan. In 1957 Bock changed the company name to World Pacific, to reflect the wider range of music styles in its catalogue, however maintaining the identity “Pacific Jazz” for jazz releases, though subsequently, both names were used more or less interchangeably.\n\nIn 1965 the label was sold to Liberty Records, who went on to purchase Blue Note the following year. Liberty Records continued new jazz releases on both Pacific Jazz and Blue Note, however Liberty became increasingly financially troubled , and in 1968, was sold to the financial conglomerate Transamerica, including both its World Pacific and Blue Note labels and their respective catalogues.\n\nTransamerica eventually consolidated all its music holdings into its United Artists division, in 1970, and for most of the next decade UA controlled re-issue selection, manufacturing, distribution and overseas licensing, but few if any new releases appeared, and the label had effectively ceased to exist.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s EMI acquired United Artists Records, including all of its former Liberty-owned labels. The Pacific Jazz catalog is now controlled by EMI’s legacy management division, “Blue Note Records”."
