        "text": "Dead Island 2, while not a traditional open-world game, is packed with locations and characters that bring the world to spectacular (un)life. Recently revealed to follow a more linear and constricted approach in regards to the story, many players imagined it would be on the shorter-scaled side in regards to its length. Still, now that it’s in our hands we’re pleasantly surprised to realize that this is not the case. And what makes it feel even larger is the amount of voice-over work that went into it.\n\nWhen talking about voices, you have to pay close attention to the six Slayers you can choose to play as during the entire game. Not only are each of them different in regards to gameplay and characteristics (you can figure out which one is best for you through this link), but they all get their own specific lines and reactions throughout the game’s campaign. Heartfelt and exciting, these are the voice actors behind the heroes of Dead Island 2:\n\nDead Island 2′s entire voice cast\n\nOf course, the reason why the world feels so good (and darkly funny) while you meet the characters is that there’s a colossal amount of people who contributed to the game. Below you’ll find the entire list of characters in alphabetical order, accompanied by the actors and actresses that voiced them."
