        "text": "Marilyn Monroe was an American actress, comedienne, singer, and model. Monroe is of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh descent. She became one of the world's most enduring iconic figures and is remembered both for her winsome embodiment of the Hollywood sex symbol and her tragic personal and professional struggles within the film industry. Her life and death are still the subjects of much controversy and speculation.\n\nShe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926. Her mother, Gladys Pearl (Monroe), was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, to American parents from Indiana and Missouri, and was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn's biological father has been established through DNA testing as Charles Stanley Gifford, who had been born in Newport, Rhode Island, to a family with deep roots in the state. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and rarely had contact with young Marilyn. Once Marilyn became an adult and celebrated as a film star, she paid a woman by the name of Inez Melson to look in on the institutionalized Gladys and give detailed reports of her progress. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.\n\nMarilyn was then taken in by Gladys' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan's Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan's Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace's husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace's Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana's advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddards. The Goddards planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.\n\nShe decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 400 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : \"Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy\", \"Anyone Can Tell I Love You\" and \"The Ladies of the Chorus\" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950) , resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.\n\nWhen she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955) , she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955) , she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York's Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller . True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier , fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So had an affair with Yves Montand . Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961) , written for her by departing husband Miller, was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something's Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.\n\nOn August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe's day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn's physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document \"Felt it was possible that Marilyn had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to.\" Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn's house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn't stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him to say that her second husband's son had called her. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the evening went on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a 'probable suicide' though many conspiracies would follow in the years after her death.\n\nAmanda Leigh Moore was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, on April 10, 1984, to Stacy (Friedman), a former news reporter, and Don Moore, an airline pilot. During her childhood, her family moved to Orlando, Florida, where she was raised. She has Russian Jewish (from her maternal grandfather), English, Scottish, and Irish, ancestry.\n\nAfter seeing the musical \"Oklahoma!\", she decided that she wanted to pursue a career in singing. As a child, she performed the National Anthem at several athletic events around her hometown of Orlando, Florida, and became known as the \"National Anthem girl\". At the ripe age of fourteen, while she was recording in a studio in Orlando, a Fed-Ex worker who happened to be passing through heard her and was interested in her talent. He happened to know someone at Sony as well. Moore worked on cutting a demo and shortly thereafter signed a record deal with Sony 550 Music. At 15, her first record \"So Real\" was released. Her first tour was with the Backstreet Boys.\n\nAs her touring and recording schedule demanded more of her time, Moore withdrew from Bishop Moore Catholic High School in Orlando and opted for a tutor/correspondence. She has stated that her education is important to her and says that the fact that she wants to go to college motivates her to continue with her schooling.\n\nThough Moore's record sales were not up in the ranks of Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, she has proved to be a formidable talent both in singing and in acting, and snagged an MTV Movie Award in June 2002 for her first feature film role in Nur mit dir - A Walk to Remember (2002). Her biggest dream, though, is to perform on Broadway someday.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Mandy headlined several films, ranging from the little-seen drama All I Want (2002) to mid-level releases like How to Deal - Wer braucht schon liebe? (2003), American Princess (2004), Im Rennstall ist das Zebra los! (2005), and the more broadly comedic Von Frau zu Frau (2007) and Lizenz zum Heiraten (2007). She also appeared in the odd-ball sci-fi film Southland Tales (2006), and voiced Rapunzel in the Disney blockbuster CGI animation Rapunzel - Neu verföhnt (2010).\n\nIn the mid 2010s, she re-emerged as a star actress, headlining the show This is Us: Das ist Leben (2016) and the hit thriller film 47 Meters Down (2017), with more film roles to come.\n\nMalcolm John Taylor was born on June 13, 1943 in Leeds, England, to working-class parents Edna (McDowell), a hotelier, and Charles Taylor, a publican. His father was an alcoholic. Malcolm hated his parents' ways. His father was keen to send his son to private school to give him a good start in life, so Malcolm was packed off to boarding school at age 11. He attended the Tonbridge School and the Cannock House School in Eltham, Kent. At school, he was beaten with the slipper or cane every Monday for his wayward behavior. Whilst at school, he decided that he wanted to become an actor; it was also around this time that his love for race cars began. He attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) to study acting. Meanwhile, he worked at his parents' pub but lost his job when the pub went bankrupt, his father drinking all the profits. He then had a variety of jobs, from coffee salesman to messenger.\n\nHis first big-screen role was in Poor Cow - geküßt und geschlagen (1967), although his two-minute scene was ultimately cut from the completed film. Soon after, he caught the attention of director Lindsay Anderson who cast him in the role of a rebellious student in his film If.... (1968). The film catapulted Malcolm to stardom in Britain but failed everywhere else. He was so enthusiastic about the film's success that he wanted to do another right away. He began writing what would become the semi-autobiographical Der Erfolgreiche (1973). Then he starred as Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick's controversial Uhrwerk Orange (1971), a role that gave him world fame, and legendary status (although typecasting him as a in villainous roles). In early 1976, he spent nearly a year working on what would later be one of the most infamous films of all time, the semi-pornographic Caligula - Aufstieg und Fall eines Tyrannen (1979), financed by Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione. Around that time, the British film industry collapsed, forcing him to flee to America to continue working. His first American film was Flucht in die Zukunft (1979). He then did Britannia Hospital (1982), the last part of Lindsay Anderson's working-class trilogy that started with If.... (1968).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the years of alcohol and drug abuse, including $1000 a week on cocaine, caught up with him. Years of abuse took its toll on him; his black hairs were now gray. Looking older than he really was, nobody wanted to cast him for playing younger roles. The big roles having dried up, he did many B-rated movies. The 1990s were kinder to him, though. In 1994, he was cast as Dr. Tolian Soran, the man who killed Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek - Treffen der Generationen (1994). He was back on the track, playing villains again. He played another in the classic BBC miniseries Our Friends in the North (1996). Today, with more than 100 films under his belt, he is one of the greatest actors in America. In 2021 McDowell got his American citizenship. Prior to getting his citizenship, McDowell has stated that he likes the no-nonsense American ways. He resides in the northern suburbs of Los Angeles, California.\n\nA classic beauty, blonde French actress Michèle Morgan was one of her country's most popular leading ladies for over five decades. Born Simone Renee Roussel on Leap Year Day (February 29) in 1920, she ran away from home as a teenager and studied acting under René Simon, beginning her film career at 16 working as a film extra to pay for drama classes.\n\nThe young actress soon caught the eye of director Marc Allégret, who cast her in Gribouille (1937), which clinched her stardom. Her remote, enigmatic features and gloomy allure had audiences comparing her to a young Greta Garbo. She went on to appear elegantly opposite Charles Boyer in the drama Orage (1938) directed by Allegret; opposite Jean Gabin in Die Motte und die Flamme (1938) directed by Marcel Carné, as well as both Das Korallenriff (1939) and Der Orkan (1941). She had her first top-billed roles in Herzdame (1939) and Das Gesetz des Nordens (1939).\n\nMichèle's eventual fled war-torn France for Hollywood and earned roles based purely on her European prestige. She did not stand out among the other female foreign imports of that time, however, such as Ingrid Bergman. Cast in rather routine sultry roles amid WWII surroundings, she received only a modest reception for such US-based films as Joan of Paris (1942) with Paul Henreid; Two Tickets to London (1943) with Alan Curtis; Fahrkarte nach Marseille (1944) opposite Humphrey Bogart; and the noirish The Chase (1946) starring Robert Cummings.\n\nMichèle succeeded much better at home continuing prolifically in such films as Aufenthalt vor Vera Cruz (1953), Geständnis einer Nacht (1952), Oase (1955), Das grosse Manöver (1955), Der Liebesroman einer Königin (1956) (as Marie Antoinette), Menschen im Hotel (1959), Der Frauenmörder von Paris (1963), Der Mord, der zweimal geschah (1964), Benjamin - Aus dem Tagebuch einer männlichen Jungfrau (1968) and Eine Katze jagt die Maus (1975). Back in the late 1940's, she received the very first Cannes Film Festival award for \"best actress\" for her touching performance as the blind heroine in Und es ward Licht (1946). She also received an honorary Cesar Award in 1992.\n\nMarried during the war and early post-war years (1942-1949) to American actor/singer William Marshall, Michèle's second husband was handsome Gallic star Henri Vidal and they appeared together in a couple of films, including both the historical drama Fabiola (1949) and romantic drama Die Karriere der Doris Hart (1950), plus Die sieben Sünden (1952) (albeit different \"sin\" segments) and Napoléon (1955). Following Vidal's sudden death of a heart at age 40 in 1959, the actress married a third time one year later to well-known French actor/writer/director Gérard Oury. They had unbilled cameos in Ein Mann und eine Frau - 20 Jahre später (1986). She was left a widow in 2006.\n\nSemi-retired by the 1970's, Michèle's last feature film was a small bit in the Marcello Mastroianni film Allen geht's gut (1990). She retired in 1999 after a few sporadic 90's TV parts. She died in her home town of Hauts-de-Seine, France on December 20, 2016, at age 96.\n\nMartin Sam Milner was born December 28, 1931 in Detroit, Michigan. His mother, Jerre Martin, originally from Oregon, was a dancer with the Paramount Theater circuit. His father, Sam Gordon Milner, a Polish Jewish immigrant, was a film distributor. The Milners moved to Seattle when Martin was a baby and to Los Angeles soon after. At age 15, Martin's father got him an agent and he was chosen to play the role of \"John Day\" in Unser Leben mit Vater (1947), Warner Bros.' version of Clarence Day, Jr.'s popular Broadway play. Milner contracted polio shortly after filming was completed and his career was put on hold for a year as he recovered from the illness. After graduating from North Hollywood High School and studying for one year at the University of Southern California, Milner worked steadily in films during the years 1949-1960. He appeared in films such as Du warst unser Kamerad (1949), Zwei rechnen ab (1957), Die Liebe der Marjorie Morningstar (1958) and Dein Schicksal in meiner Hand (1957). He put his career on hold again when he was inducted into the Army in 1952 for two years. Shortly after joining the Army, he was assigned to the Human Research Division, where he directed military training films and served as Master of Ceremonies for a touring show based at Fort Ord, California. Milner married television actress and singer Judy Jones in 1957 and they have four children--Amy, Molly, Stuart, and Andrew.\n\nMilner met Jack Webb during the filming of Okinawa (1951) and later worked with him on his \"Dragnet\" radio show as well as the TV series Dragnet (1951). Milner appeared as 17-year-old high school student \"Stephen Banner\" in the episode \"The Big Producer\" in 1952. According to Webb's biography \"Just the Facts, Ma'am\", Webb owed Milner money from a card game. When Webb called him to the studio to pay him back, he offered Milner a role in the \"Dragnet\" radio show. After that, Webb continued to find roles for Milner until he offered him the role of \"Pete Malloy\" on Adam-12 (1968). Milner continued to appear in films throughout the 1970s and 1980s and made many guest appearances on television shows such as Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), the \"Columbo\" made-for-TV movies, Macgyver (1985), and Diagnose: Mord (1993). Milner was an avid fisherman and has been co-host of the syndicated radio talk show \"Let's Talk Hook-up\" since 1993. He also hosts fishing trips through \"Let's Talk Hook-Up.\"\n\nApart from the Webb connection, Milner starred as \"Tod Stiles\" in his own groundbreaking CBS-TV series, Route 66 (1960). The series was notable for its coast-to-coast location shooting, eloquent scripts by co-creator Stirling Silliphant and others, impressive guest casts, and a distinctive theme song by Nelson Riddle. The series allowed Milner to explore a range of characterizations as his nomadic travels in a Corvette convertible took him from job to job all over the United States, where he dug deeply into the lives of the people he encountered there -- with traveling companions \"Buz Murdock\" (George Maharis) and, after Maharis left the show, \"Lincoln Case\" (Glenn Corbett).\n\nMarsha Mason has a wonderful, extremely engaging \"feel good\" quality about her, an innate warmth that makes you root for her whether she's playing a stubborn single mom, brittle prostitute, or strung-out alcoholic. She was a resoundingly respected and popular film actress of the 1970s and 1980s whose career skyrocketed in the bittersweet comedies/dramas of award-winning Neil Simon. Earning a string of leading lady Oscar nominations within a short span of time (three of them, courtesy of husband Simon), Marsha's movie career suffered a major fall-out when the famed couple parted ways in 1983 -- most probably due to her almost exclusive, amazingly successful association with him.\n\nThe elder of two sisters born to James Joseph Mason and Jacqueline Helena (Rachowsky) Mason in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 3, 1942, Marsha was raised, for a time, in Crestwood, Missouri, before moving to Webster Groves (a suburb of St. Louis) and graduating from Nerinx Hall High School. There, she attended Webster University and, after receiving her degree, moved to New York where she began taking acting classes and finding some work in TV commercials in-between regular job-hunting.\n\nMarrying fellow struggling actor Gary Campbell in 1965, Marsha made an inauspicious movie debut with the forgettable Hot Rod Hullabaloo (1966). Focusing intently on stage work, she made her professional debut in 1967 with \"The Deer Park\" at the Theatre de Lys and, the next year, joined the cast as a replacement in the established hit comedy, \"Cactus Flower\", at the Royale Theatre. Subsequent work came her way both on- and off-Broadway (\"It's Called the Sugar Plum\", \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June\", \"Richard III\"). She later hooked up with San Francisco's prestigious American Conservatory Theatre and appeared in an enviable number of their productions (\"The Merchant of Venice\", \"Private Lives\", \"You Can't Take It With You\", \"A Doll's House\", \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", \"The Crucible\").\n\nDaytime soaps played a vital part during this period of time (1969-1972), playing a hooker-turned-vampire on the popular Dark Shadows (1966) series and winning regular roles on Where the Heart Is (1969) and Love of Life (1951). Divorced after five years from actor Gary Campbell in 1970, the pert-nosed, dark-haired beauty met Neil Simon, a recent widower, when he cast her in his 1973 original Broadway production of \"The Good Doctor\". They had a whirlwind romance and married with a few weeks.\n\n1973 was an excellent year in other ways in that Marsha won the second femme lead in Heirat ausgeschlossen (1973), starring George Segal and Susan Anspach, and then beat out such stars as Barbra Streisand for the coveted role of the hooker opposite James Caan's sailor in the realistic drama Zapfenstreich (1973). The chemistry was electric between the two and Mason earned her first Oscar nod. Following a leading stage role in \"The Heiress\" (1975) and playing \"Roxane\" in a TV version of Cyrano de Bergerac (1975), Marsha earned two more Neil Simon-driven Oscar nominations with Der Untermieter (1977), opposite Oscar winner Richard Dreyfuss, and Das zweite Kapitel (1979), which reunited her with James Caan and was based on Mason and Simon's own relationship.\n\nSimon would offer his wife Oscar-worthy material one more time with Mrs. Hines & Tochter (1981), as an alcoholic trying to stay on the wagon for daughter Kristy McNichol. This would be Marsha's fourth Academy Award nod. The couple's last film project together came in the form of Max Dugans Moneten (1983), which was a major misfire.\n\nFollowing Marsha's divorce from Simon, her film product decreased rapidly in quantity as well as quality. With the exception of the Clint Eastwood vehicle, Heartbreak Ridge (1986), she made no other films in the 1980s. While her film output did increase in the 1990s, none of them -- Stella (1990), Mein böser Freund Fred (1991), I love Trouble - Nichts als Ärger (1994), Gegen die Zeit (1995) and 2 Tage in L.A. (1996) -- did anything to jump-start her waning cinematic career.\n\nOver the years, Marsha maintained by focusing on TV and stage work. More recent theatre credits have included \"The Night of the Iguana\", \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (another popular Simon work in which she appeared opposite Richard Dreyfuss in London), \"Wintertime\", \"Steel Magnolias\", \"I Never Sang for My Father\", \"All's Well that Ends Well\" and the Simon play \"California Suite\", some of which played Broadway.\n\nOn the small screen, Marsha starred in her own short-lived series Keine wie die andere (1991) and appeared in an Emmy-nominated recurring role on the series, Frasier (1993), as a love interest for Martin Crane. She has also appeared in a number of TV-movies, including one as Judy Garland's mother, \"Ethel Gumm\", in Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows (2001), and has guest-starred on such series as \"Seinfeld,\" \"The Education of Max Bickford,\" \"Lipstick Jungle,\" \"Army Wives,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"Madame Secretary.\" Her more recent recurring parts have been on the comedy series The Middle (2009) and Grace & Frankie (2015).\n\nOn a rare occasion, the veteran actress has directed both on film and TV. Feeling out of sorts in Hollywood at one stage, Marsha strongly pursued her spiritual side, primarily as a disciple of Swami Muktananda. She later moved to New Mexico in 1993 and she became an owner of an organic farm where she raised herbs and operated a wellness line of bath and body products. She also enjoyed professional race car driving at one point. An insightful, highly revealing autobiography came out in the form of \"Journal: A Personal Odyssey\" in 2000.\n\nEminem was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in St. Joseph, Missouri, to Deborah R. (Nelson) and Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr., who were in a band together, Daddy Warbucks. He is of English, as well as some German, Scottish ancestry. Marshall spent his early childhood being shoved back and forth from Kansas City and Detroit. He settled on the Eastside of Detroit when he was 12. Switching schools every two to three months made it difficult to make friends, graduate and to stay out of trouble. Marshall attended Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, 1986-1989.\n\nBeing a rap fan for most of his life, Marshall began rapping at the age of 11. Rhyming words together, battling schoolmates in the lunchroom brought joy to what was otherwise a painful existence. At the age of 14, he began to get very serious about his rapping but it wasn't until he was 17 that he actually made a name for himself, becoming M&M, which he would later respell as \"Eminem\". Being rejected by most fellow rappers because of his race, Marshall grew an anger that flows through his music to this day. After failing the 9th grade for three times in a row, he quit school, but has remarked that he does not consider himself stupid and does not advise that people should follow his example. He says that it just wasn't for him. Forcing himself on radio shows, freestyle battles, Marshall threw himself head first into the rap game, where he was swallowed up most of the time. His very first album was titled \"Infinite\" and, while the album sold less than a thousand copies, it was the gearing up stages for the rapper who became a millionaire. It was then that his daughter, Hailie Jade Scott, was born on December 25th of 1995 with long time girlfriend Kim Scott.\n\nHaving nothing to lose at all, flat broke and not knowing where he would be living the next week, Marshall set out to rant about life in general, the set quickly caught the ear of hip-hop's difficult-to-please underground. What came out of this was the \"Slim Shady EP\", the early work for the later Dr. Dre revised Slim Shady LP. Down to nearly his last dime, he went into the 1997 Rap Olympics in Los Angeles, basically hoping to win the $1,500 cash prize which he badly needed. After battling for an hour and throwing back every race diss thrown at him, Marshall made it to second place losing in a slip up. Furious that he had lost, Marshall didn't even notice that he had been spotted. In the crowd were a few producers from Interscope, and they were handed a copy of the \"Slim Shady EP\" tape by way of a demo.\n\nDr. Dre got to hear it and eventually tracked him down. The two instantly hit it off, recording four songs in their first six hours of working - three which made it to his first LP. After the album was finished, Dr. Dre asked Marshall to come work with him on his new album. He helped produce several tracks and was on the best songs of the album. Now officially making it, Marshall and Dre set to make his second LP. The album became the Marshall Mathers LP and won 3 Grammies and was the first rap album ever to be nominated \"Album of the Year\", selling more than 8 million records in the United States alone. He also stunned critics when he shot down all homophobic remarks by performing \"Stan\" with Elton John. Eminem made a movie, 8 Mile (2002). Though 2001 was a rough year for the rapper, being charged with weapon offenses, divorcing his wife, and almost going to prison, Marshall has explained his life in one word: \"Claimer\"."
