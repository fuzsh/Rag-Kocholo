        "text": "Eugene’s annual Pride in the Park celebration is planned to kick into high gear this weekend. The event has taken place in August since the early 1990s — purposefully scheduled after the University of Oregon’s graduation and additional track and field events hosted by the city — and provides an occasion for members of the LGBTQ+ community to connect.\n\nConcerns arose in late July about a lack of available parking for Pride attendees at Alton Baker Park due to a sold-out Ween concert scheduled at the Cuthbert Amphitheater for the same evening, which has since been canceled. Public testimony at a July 22 Eugene City Council meeting saw numerous speakers addressing the parking concerns. Following the meeting, EugPRIDE posted that a solution for the parking issues had been reached. Despite the original concert's cancellation, event coordinators for Pride still encourage attendees to utilize alternative transportation.\n\n“Thank you City of Eugene Government staff for all you are doing to support our Festival and make sure folks can access this all volunteer-led and run event,” EugPRIDE wrote. “The teams in Cultural Services, City of Eugene, Parks and Open Space, City of Eugene Government Transportation Planning and others are doing incredible work to make the City work for our LBGTQ+ community.”\n\nEugPRIDE expects this year’s festival to be its largest ever with about 12,000 anticipated attendees. Organizers are encouraging attendees to use diverse modes of transportation to join in on the festivities. Biking, walking and busing are all encouraged, and parking at Alton Baker Park is only available for ADA uses or for carpools with four or more riders. Locations for car lots, bike paths, bus and shuttle routes and details on accessible transportation services are available at www.eugenepride.org/festival-24/transportation.\n\nA $5 suggested donation helps support the nonprofit festival to provide scholarships and grants aimed at uplifting the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nWHEN: Aug. 10. The march is planned to meet at 8:30 a.m. and begins at 9:15 a.m. The festival runs from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nWHERE: The march begins at Kesey Square, located at 10 E. Broadway. The Pride festival takes place at Alton Baker Park at 200 Day Island Road.\n\nSCHEDULE: Performances at Alton Baker Park are spread out across two stages: the Main Stage and the Community Stage. Acts range from choir performances and comedians to drag artists and dancers. Main Stage performances include artists like the Soromundi Lesbian Chorus, Elite Dance Company, the Eugene Gay Men’s Chorus and Comedy Hour with Jen Jay and Friends. Community Stage performances include sets from DJ Fallon Love, Sketchy the Clown, Poetry with Jalen Thompsen and Fanny Rugburn’s Magic Queendom. A full event schedule can be found at www.eugenepride.org/stage23.\n\nHannarose McGuinness is The Register-Guard’s growth and development reporter. Contact her at hmcguinness@registerguard.com"
