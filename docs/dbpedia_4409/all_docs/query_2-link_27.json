        "text": "Dead Island 2 has a large cast of human characters, some of whom don’t die horribly. Even better, the overall quality of the voice acting is excellent. But who are these characters voiced by and where might you have heard them before? This is what you need to know about all the voice actors in Dead Island 2.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDead Island 2’s Voice Actors, in Alphabetical Order of Their Characters.\n\nWe’re not going to risk delving too far into spoiler territory, but there are some dramatic and genuinely moving moments throughout Dead Island 2. Those moments wouldn’t be half as heart-breaking if not for the voice actors who lent their voices to these characters.\n\nThe game’s six protagonists are voiced (though not motion captured) by the following actors:\n\nAmy – Skye Bennett\n\nBruno – Jay Rincon\n\nCarla – Carolina Ravassa\n\nDani – Michelle Fox\n\nJacob – Okezie Morro\n\nRyan – Ronan Summers\n\nWe’re particularly happy that each protagonist gets unique lines. It’s not just a case of each actor reciting the exact same script. Yes, we’re looking at you, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. As for the other characters, here’s who plays who.\n\nAlex – Derek Siow\n\nAmanda Styles – Becca Stewart\n\nAndrea – Mia Soteriou\n\nAva – Clara Emmanuel\n\nBoz – Joshua Collins\n\nBud/Bundy – Sean Power\n\nBurt – Kyle Soller\n\nCadenza/sKOpe/PA Announcements – Norma Butikofer\n\nCarlos – Andrew Wheildon-Dennis\n\nCarmen – Oliva Carruthers\n\nCurtis Sinclair – Paul Kelleher\n\nDanny – Josh Cowdery\n\nDelgado – Joshua Collins\n\nDenise – Rebecca Crossdale\n\nDenise/Angelina – Kristen Alminta\n\nDez – Nneko Okoye\n\nDr. Reuben Reed – Colin McFarlane\n\nElizabeth – Karina Fernandez\n\nEmma Jaunt – Hannah Steele\n\nEsta Navarro – Michelle Assante\n\nEvie/Janet – Jennifer Armour\n\nEzekiel – Mark Ebulue\n\nFrancesca/Major Booker – Christie Meyers\n\nGreg/PA Announcements – Mitchell Mullen\n\nHana – Arina II\n\nJessie – Thaddea Graham\n\nJimmy Montana/Joshua – Eric Loren\n\nJohn/Roger – Chris Ragland\n\nKai – Kevin Shen\n\nKen/Steve – Nicholas Bailey\n\nLola Konradt – Pippa Winslow\n\nLuciana – Elena Sanz\n\nMichael Anders/Sean – Joseph May\n\nPatton – Mel Raido\n\nRainier – Niko Kaim\n\nRav – Priyank Morjaria\n\nRikky Rex/Noah – Glenn Wrage\n\nRonnie – Henry Garrett\n\nRosa/Nora – Megan Maczo\n\nRoxanne – Jo McCallin\n\nSam B – Cavin Cornwall\n\nSarah Sheppard – Cissy Jones\n\nSebastian – Hyoie O’Grady\n\nSid/Dougie/sKOpe – Joe Corrigall\n\nSpanish PA Announcements – Carolina Ravassa\n\nTan – Chris Lew Kum Hoi\n\nThurston – Ako Mitchell\n\nTisha Reed – Jessica Hayles\n\nTodd – Arthur Lee\n\nTrent/Luther/Zephron – John Schwab\n\nValentia – Angelique Fernandez\n\nW.O. Melissa Rodriguez/Rita – Gloria Santillana Garcia\n\nAmong the biggest names is the returning character Sam B. He was voiced by Phil LaMarr in Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, but here he’s played by Cavin Cornwall. Cornwall was also in Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (though sadly uncredited) as the excellently named Pemmin Brunce.\n\nYou might also recognize Colin McFarlane who, voicing Dr. Reuben Reed here, previously played Commissioner Loeb in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\n\nSkye Bennett, who voices Amy, also cropped up in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.\n\nIn fact, most of the cast members have appeared in other games. Bruno’s voice actor, Jay Rincon, was in Atomic Heart and Horizon: Forbidden West. Jennifer Armour, who plays both Janet and Evie, also appeared in that latter game, among others.\n\nSo, if you were wondering about all the voice actors in Dead Island 2 or wanted to know why Dr. Reed sounded so familiar, there’s your answer."
