Wilma Dykeman\n\nTennessee Women: Their Lives and Times examines women’s private and public experiences within the context of more than two centuries of history and the South’s richly diverse geography and cultures. These eighteen biographical chapters focus on women whose stories are familiar and others whose lives have remained in shadow, revealing a history that is often unexpected and complex. As historian Margaret Ripley Wolfe, author of Daughters of Canaan: A Saga of Southern Women (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1995), observed, “Coming to terms with females below the Mason-Dixon line demands attention to the subtleties and nuances of women’s private worlds of life and work in addition to the dynamics of the public arenas of their eras” (5). Envisioning these women in the times and spaces they inhabited inspires a heightened sense of place, a greater appreciation of the role of gender and race in the stories of our lives, and a clearer understanding of the uniqueness of Tennessee history. The focus on women in Tennessee, a racially diverse mid-South state with a competitive political system and extraordinary musical cultures, sets this volume apart from more general studies of southern women. Likewise, the placement of women at the center of the historical stage, with Tennessee as a setting and backdrop, re-envisions the state’s past. These women left intriguing footprints in Tennessee’s history. While their biographies tend to heighten the significance of individual women, grouping these women’s life stories in a single volume encourages a greater appreciation of women’s history as an integral part of Tennessee’s history. These eighteen women reflect the state’s three principal geographic regions and larger regional cultures. A defining characteristic of Tennessee is its vastix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nness, as it stretches for five hundred miles, from North Carolina in the east to Arkansas in the west, sharing common borders with seven states. Kinship and community networks cross state lines and variously influence personal orientations. While some subjects knew and interacted with each other, others remained circumscribed and separated by great distances, thick forests, steep mountains, and wild rushing rivers—terrain that isolated even as it inspired. Women living within the hollows and ridgelines of the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee shared conditions experienced by mountain women of Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina to the north and east and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to the south. Knoxville, located in the center of East Tennessee’s Great Valley at the headwaters of the Tennessee River, became the urban center of this region as it drew migrants from nearby mountain counties to work in industries based on coal, lumber, marble, textiles, and energy generated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. A much different landscape defined women’s lives in West Tennessee, where proximity to the Mississippi River encouraged a more metropolitan orientation. River traffic between St. Louis and New Orleans, before and after the Louisiana Purchase, hastened the transformation of an ancient American Indian trading center into what became Memphis—a world capital for the cotton trade. As floods regularly inundated the delta, the bluffs on the Tennessee side of the river provided safe haven for people working the rich lowlands of Mississippi and Arkansas. The cultures, lifestyles, and skills of African Americans who migrated from these regions especially shaped Memphis, just thirty miles north of the Mississippi state line, into a unique southern city. Middle Tennessee represents yet another geographically and culturally distinct region, defined by the Cumberland Plateau and the Cumberland River, which flows from eastern Kentucky into northern Tennessee then back into western Kentucky, where it joins the Ohio River. Middle Tennessee’s natural resources (especially coal and mineral deposits) and transportation provided by the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers fueled the growth of Nashville. This key port along the Cumberland River became the region’s commercial and industrial center. Influences from the north, especially from Kentucky and Ohio, helped establish educational institutions that gave Nashville its reputation as the “Athens of the South.” Legislative battles in Nashville, the state capital, determined the laws and policies that shaped women’s lives from the Great Smokies to the Mississippi River and provided common ground for Tennessee women across the distances. The book begins with early tensions and interactions between ethnic groups, focusing specifically on Nan-ye-hi, the “Beloved Woman” of the Cherokee, and\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nFanny Wright, founder of the abolitionist, feminist / egalitarian commune of Nashoba. As native women endured the relentless encroachment of Europeans, they also became part of emerging mixed-race societies of slave and free populations that extended their claims into Tennessee. Nan-ye-hi’s vision of peaceful coexistence of native and new people, as interpreted by Cynthia Cumfer, reminds us also of the violent experiences and subjugation of the region’s first inhabitants and the circumstances under which Tennessee, as a state within an evolving nation, began. Fanny Wright’s biographer, Celia Morris, illuminates Wright’s struggle to create new freedoms for women and people of color in the midst of patriarchal, racist, and slave-based societies and how important the land itself was in shaping her extraordinarily modern vision. Beverly Greene Bond’s treatment of Milly Swan Price, a free woman of color whose life spanned generations before and after the Civil War, emphasizes the difficulties of maintaining family connections in a society and legal system in rapid flux, especially where the rights and protections of African Americans were concerned. Cherisse Jones-Branch picks up on this theme in her portrait of Mary Church Terrell, a familiar historical figure. Jones-Branch invites us to revise our understanding of Terrell by seeing her in the context of a family and community, rooted in Tennessee, that fundamentally inspired Terrell’s dedication to seeking justice even at the highest political levels. These roots become even more meaningful in Linda T. Wynn’s chapter on Diane Nash and the early civil rights activism of students at Fisk University in Nashville in the 1960s. Nash, whose grandparents migrated from Memphis to Chicago, represents the return of Tennessee’s African Americans to challenge the southern roots of racism. Her willingness to stand up to Nashville’s political authorities and to lead her fellow students to defy Jim Crow is an important part of the larger story of the modern civil rights movement. Nash’s goal of peaceful coexistence, based on mutual respect and recognition of a common humanity regardless of race, seems an old and hauntingly familiar dream in the context of Tennessee history. Indeed, Melissa Checker finds a similar influence running deep within the generations of her subject, Doris Bradshaw, whose efforts to expose health hazards posed by toxic waste in African American communities began in the 1990s and continue today. In a related theme of women’s rights activism, several chapters focus on Tennessee women as feminists and political players. Tennessee’s critical role as the thirty-sixth state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment, which in 1920 granted women the right to vote, is well known. But two Tennessee women, Sue Shelton White and Charl Ormond Williams, have often been neglected or misunderstood in treatments of the woman suffrage and women’s rights movements.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nWhite and Williams seem at first to represent different locations on the feminist spectrum, but both eventually emerged as militant advocates for women’s rights. Williams’s strategy of attacking the inadequacies in public education in the South by working for federal support remains controversial. Her story reminds us of work that remains and of a Tennessee woman’s potential to influence public policy, even if she has to go to Washington, D.C., to do it. Connie L. Lester’s portrait of Lucille Thornburgh, a lifelong labor organizer, shows the tremendous obstacles arrayed against working-class Tennesseans. Even as antiunion forces and gender discrimination threatened her efforts, Thornburgh kept organizing. Her political support of Estes Kefauver, a homegrown liberal politician and Democrat, seems to have helped protect her. Several of our subjects were deeply involved in Kefauver’s three successful U.S. Senate campaigns (1948, 1954, and 1960) and in his unsuccessful vice presidential and presidential bids in the 1950s. Another subject, Martha Ragland, supported him in order to combat corruption and advance progressive agendas, such as birth control and anti–poll tax movements. The ideological evolutions of Thornburgh and Ragland illuminate feminist and labor activism during the 1940s and 1950s—a period ordinarily associated with progressive inactivity. The importance of Tennessee in the history of gender politics is illustrated further by Gail S. Murray’s chapter on Jocelyn Dan Wurzburg, a civil rights and feminist organizer and pioneer in conflict mediation. It is due in part to Wurzburg’s work on the Tennessee Commission on the Status of Women that the history of women in the state received some attention in the 1970s with the publication of Tennessee Women: Past and Present, written by Wilma Dykeman, edited by Carol Lynn Yellin, and sponsored by the commission (privately published, 1977). Melissa Walker gives us a fine portrait of a Tennessee woman in her chapter on Dykeman, whose beloved stories of Appalachian communities, mountains, rivers, and sacred natural spaces that call, comfort, and renew the soul touch a chord in many who abhor the environmental desecration and disappearing beauty of Tennessee. This volume also emphasizes the importance of Tennessee women in creating phenomenal movements and trends in music. The cultural influence of Tennessee women has rocked the world, and their voices and performances receive particular attention here. Alberta Hunter, raised in Memphis, was part of a long line of extraordinarily talented blues women who migrated north. As Michelle R. Scott illustrates, Hunter found her voice and livelihood in the music of her Memphis childhood. Like Hunter, other powerfully creative Tennessee women not included in this collection—such as Chattanooga’s Bessie Smith; Tina Turner, a native of Nutbush; and Dolly Parton, from the mountains of\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nSeiverville—are part of much more than Tennessee’s musical heritage as their performances and compositions influenced music across the globe and generations. It is interesting that women from this state have in common a potency that is liberating and undeniable and that reaches across ideological, cultural, and racial divides. This force spawned music industries that draw millions to Memphis, Nashville, and Appalachian hill towns, millions who hope to touch whatever is the source of that amazing music. Three of our authors give us new perspectives on how the industries evolved and the central roles women played in the music business—certainly one of Tennessee’s unique legacies. Laura Helper-Ferris, in her essay on Bettye Berger, shows us the interracial side of the music business and club scenes in Memphis, as well as the activities of impresarios and entertainers like Sam Phillips, Elvis Presley, and Ivory Joe Hunter. Nashville’s country music industry owes a tremendous debt to Sarah Colley Cannon (Minnie Pearl) and Jo Walker-Meador, who turned this genre of entertainment into a global force. Authors Kristine M. McCusker and Diane Pecknold illustrate the importance of combining feminist scholarship with the study of southern musical cultures. This volume also examines two women who challenged traditional female stereotypes through demonstrations of remarkable physical talent and endurance. Phoebe Fairgrave Omlie, a record-breaking aviator and stunt woman, began in the 1920s to amaze the world with her piloting prowess, high-flying trapeze acts, and wing-walking techniques. Her skill and courage later proved invaluable when she tested new aircraft and trained pilots during World War II and the Cold War. Janann Sherman recounts how, in the dawning modern age, Omlie’s dreams and beliefs in what women could do truly took flight. And yet, as Aram Goudsouzian’s biography of Olympic track star Wilma Rudolph reveals, racism and sexism continued to permeate traditionally male-dominated fields in the 1960s. Even such a talented and determined African American woman, who broke records in the sports world with her explosive strength, could not break the back of Jim Crow. The arrangement of these biographies is more or less chronological, based on the women’s birth dates (all subjects were born prior to 1955) and some common themes. Many of the women lived long and active lives, so there is a good deal of temporal overlap. For example, the African American civil rights pioneer Mary Church Terrell began life in Shelby County in the age of slavery and died just months after the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawed racial segregation in public accommodations. The white Shelby County education activist Charl Ormond Williams was born in 1885, as “lynching bees” swept the South, and\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\ndied shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis in 1968. Both women worked in Washington, D.C., within blocks of each other, from the 1920s to the 1950s. While the authors treat their subjects individually, readers can imagine the women occupying the same world—perhaps literally crossing paths through time, space, and history. Tennessee Women: Their Lives and Times explores a broad range of women’s experiences gleaned from a great variety of public and private sources. Many of these have only recently been discovered or catalogued. Some common themes emerge, such as the formative power of the land itself in the development of the women’s values, purposes, and opportunities. An appreciation of the environment as something sacred and fragile is a central part of many of these women’s stories, linking across nearly three hundred years the lives of Nan-ye-hi, Wilma Dykeman, and Doris Bradshaw. Likewise, extending through colonial times, the modern civil rights movement, and the second wave of feminism, we find a common thread of heartache and uncertainty as women struggled to survive. But not found within these pages are accounts of the desperate and embattled lives of women during the Civil War. Our authors preferred to focus on the very long journey from slavery and slaveholding to a society that valued freedom in equal measure for all. Many women represented here dedicated themselves to righting inequity and injustice in order to protect future generations from unnecessary misery and deprivation—a struggle that continues in the new millennium. This single volume does not provide a comprehensive treatment of Tennessee women’s history but, instead, begins our efforts to reveal this past. With this collection, we hope to inspire new interest in sources and sites that are important to Tennessee women’s history—evidence that is in our own backyards—and convey messages from the past that resonate, become “less strange,” and reveal a history more “pertinent to the present.” Beverly and I wish to thank the eighteen contributors to this book for helping to make this the exciting, dynamic project we envisioned several years ago. Each of these persons, an expert in his or her own right, graciously consented to add this project to their already busy schedules. We also appreciate the generous support we have received from the history departments at our universities, the University of Memphis—which served as our institutional base—and Arkansas State University. We are particularly grateful for the assistance of Edwin Frank and the Special Collections staff at the University of Memphis, John Dougan and Vincent Clark at the Shelby County Archives, and the staff of the Memphis Room at the Memphis Public Library. They have helped us uncover little-known facts about Alberta Hunter, Milly Swan Price, Mary Church Terrell, and Charl\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nOrmond Williams, which we incorporated into our own essays or passed along to the other authors. Our contributors have also worked with archives, research libraries, and special collections throughout the country. These include the State Historical Society of Wisconsin; the Library of Congress; Harvard University’s Houghton Library; the Theresa Wolfson Papers, Martin Catherwood Library, School of Labor and Industrial Relations, Cornell University; the National Archives and Records Administration; the Women’s Studies Manuscript Collections, Charl Ormond Williams Papers, and Martha Ragland Papers at the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College; the Lucille Thornburgh Collection at Wayne State University’s Walter P. Reuther Library; the Country Music Foundation Oral History Collection at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum Library; the Grand Ole Opry Museum Archives; and the Tennessee State University Special Collections. We especially thank our associate editor, Laura Helper-Ferris, and Stephanie Gilmore, who both provided editorial assistance when this book was in its developmental stages. Lou Paris contributed additional editing assistance in the final stages of manuscript preparation. Elizabeth Anne Payne and Martha Swain have been guiding spirits in the conception and development of this work. The model and standards set by our sisters to the south in Mississippi Women: Their Histories, Their Lives (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2003) inspired us to extend the torch of inquiry up and into Tennessee’s challenging historical terrain. We are deeply appreciative of their example, encouragement, and advice, which helped make this book possible. Kriste Lindenmeyer and Kathleen Berkeley suggested authors and topics. We reserve special appreciation for Nancy Grayson, editor-and-chief of the University of Georgia Press, for providing priceless encouragement and guidance throughout this project, and for our husbands, Geraldus “Fuzz” Bond and Herschel Freeman, and our children—Christopher and Julia Bond Ellingboe, Amelia and Ingrid Ellingboe, and Ben David (“bd”) and Molly Freeman—whose generosity, good natures, and assistance enhanced the personal value of this communal venture.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nTennessee Women\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward) (c. 1730s–1824)\n\nDiplomatic Mother Cynthia Cumfer Called “the Pocahontas of her people,” Nan-ye-hi, also known as Nancy Ward, is the most eulogized of the Cherokees. Authors portray her as an exceptional woman who was a friend to frontier people in the Tennessee region in the late eighteenth century, a woman who sought harmony between her nation and the settlers. Many stories position her as a peaceful foil to her more warlike “cousin” Tsi-yugunsini (Dragging Canoe). Writers are conflicted about her motives— some see her as peace loving while others claim that she embraced the more advanced white civilization or that she sought to placate the more militarily powerful whites.1 Growing evidence suggests that eighteenth-century Native American women in communities throughout the eastern woodlands of what is now the United States had an important voice in international affairs through marriage, adoption, and authority in decision making. In order to manage tensions about values, conquest, and nationhood that arose from American mistreatment of Native Americans, white mythologizers have constructed a narrative about some of these women that describes them as acting in remarkable ways to befriend white people. In these accounts, the recognition of white superiority by farsighted Native American women implicitly confirms the white rationale for displacing indigenous peoples.2 These stories often mask the motivations behind women’s diplomacy, overlook the intricacies of clan and tribal relationships, and misconstrue the identities that the women constructed.3 An exploration of Nan-ye-hi’s life as a diplomat and as a member of the Wolf clan and the Women’s Council allows us to understand more fully the role that Native American women played in foreign affairs during the Revolutionary and post1\n\n2\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nRevolutionary period and how embedded their actions were in clan and communal connections. Reclaiming Nan-ye-hi as a Cherokee woman prompts us to probe more deeply into why authors create romanticized stories about powerful Native American women. Very little is actually known about Nan-ye-hi; only a handful of contemporaneous sources mention her, and we are uncertain about most of the details of her life. Historians place Nan-ye-hi’s birth at various dates between 1684 and 1739. More recent writers tend to put her birth date in the 1730s, and a later birth year is most likely correct, since she bore a child after 1755. No records establish her birthplace but some writers record that she was born in Chota, an Overhill town in what was then claimed by the colonists as the western region of North Carolina and is now eastern Tennessee. Many biographers state that Nan-ye-hi lived most of her adult life in Chota. These undocumented assertions are part of an argument that Nan-ye-hi devoted her life to peace, since Chota was important to Cherokee diplomacy and was known as the Beloved Town, a place of refuge where no violence was permitted. But contemporaneous sources indicate that she lived in Citico, a town about twelve miles from Chota, at least by the early 1770s and for many years thereafter.4 Nan-ye-hi was born into a society undergoing considerable change. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Cherokees lived in clusters of towns in present-day South Carolina, North Carolina, and eastern Tennessee. As the century progressed, white settlements pushed the Cherokee towns west into present-day Georgia and Alabama. The Overhill towns, those situated west of the Appalachians, were removed from early colonial settlements but engaged in considerable trade with South Carolina and Virginia. These towns were in a region that both the English and French, and later the Spanish, sought to control.5 At the time of Nan-ye-hi’s birth, the Cherokees believed in a spiritual world in which the universe was composed of opposing forces, such as those between war and peace, animals and humans, and men and women. Harmony was achieved by balancing these forces. Women and men did not dominate, but complemented each other. Like men, women had considerable freedom, including the right to choose their husbands and to leave them if they were unhappy. Kinship was the nucleus of Cherokee society, which was structured around seven clans with equal rights, although some clans at times were more influential than others. Cherokee society was matrilineal, rooted in a cosmos in which all Cherokees were descendants of Selu, a corn goddess who was the first mother. The primary identity of each Cherokee was the clan of her or his mother. Because women did not marry within their clans the father was not\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n3\n\nrelated to his children. One of the mother’s male kin, usually her oldest brother, formed the closest male parental relationship with them. Individuals without clan ties, whether they lived in Cherokee villages or were members of other nations, were considered strangers. Clan ties affected virtually all social and political arrangements in Cherokee society. Spiritual principles dictated the economic relations of the Cherokees. They believed that the creator gave them their lands. They were attached to them because their ancestors were buried there and the spirits of the dead lingered in some localities. They owned their land in common, with occupants having rights to tenure. Women did most of the farming and child rearing while men hunted. Personal property was individually owned, but a strong ethic of reciprocity required that those who had goods shared with those who did not. With the growth in trade, some individuals increasingly owned more property than others during the last half of the century, including the ownership of black men and women as slaves. Merchants also brought disease, including a devastating smallpox epidemic in 1738–39 that killed approximately half of the Cherokee people. Each town governed itself through councils. Although women and men had some separate areas of authority, they generally shared governance. Women could override the council on issues reserved for men—for example, the decision to go to war—through the Women’s Council, a body composed of delegates from each of the seven clans chosen by the women of the clan. The Beloved Woman, the most prominent woman in the nation through whom the Great Spirit spoke, headed the Women’s Council. She also had the authority to punish or pardon prisoners. Individuals who disagreed with the councils were not compelled to abide by their decisions. The English colonial authorities made efforts to organize the Cherokees by designating a male national chief, a practice continued by the Americans. These chiefs governed by influence, not compulsion, although over the course of the eighteenth century their access to treaty goods enhanced their powers. Historians believe that Nan-ye-hi was a member of the Wolf clan. Through her mother, Tame Doe, Nan-ye-hi had important diplomatic clan connections. Her great-uncle was Kanagatucko (Old Hop), the leader of the Cherokee nation during the war between the French and English from 1756 to 1763. Her mother’s brothers included Attakullakulla (the Little Carpenter) and Willinawaw (Great Eagle). In the Cherokee clan structure, these were the most important male clan figures to Nan-ye-hi. Attakullakulla traveled to England in 1730 and the British recognized him as one of the major peace chiefs of the Cherokees during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. Willinawaw was also involved\n\n4\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nin diplomatic affairs and by 1770 was one of the most important peace chiefs in the nation. Nan-ye-hi had one brother, Tuskegateehee (Long Fellow), who also became a chief and diplomat. Because of the relative unimportance of the father, who was not a clan member, the significant influences on Nan-ye-hi’s life were from her Wolf clan relatives, so it is not unexpected that Nan-ye-hi’s father is unknown.6 Like many Native American peoples, the Cherokees conducted diplomacy through two venues. Women commonly integrated traders and diplomats into tribal life and into the clan system by marrying or adopting them. Through these unions, the Cherokees gained access to material goods and at times to the loyalty of white merchants and diplomats. Traders spoke and often wrote English, making them valuable as scribes and translators. By midcentury, women and men considered women’s alliances with merchants to have significance comparable to that of heroic war deeds. Women extolled their accomplishments in obtaining goods from the traders who loved them in the same councils in which warriors boasted of their exploits.7 To establish diplomatic connections with peoples who remained outside the clan structure, the Cherokees reconstituted foreign communities as diplomatic kin. This method of conducting foreign affairs centered on relationship and mutuality, in which the parties achieved harmony by a balance of obligations. The parties were careful to avoid blaming one another, since the atmosphere at peace talks and not the agreements reached were central. The parties maintained their relationships over time by frequent visits to one another.8 Around 1750 Nan-ye-hi married Kingfisher, a Cherokee man of the Deer clan. They had two children, a daughter, Ka-ti, also known as Catherine or Caty, and a son, Hiskyteehee, later known as Little Fellow or Fivekiller. According to accounts written generations later, Kingfisher fought in the war with the Creeks in the decisive battle at Taliwa in 1755. Nan-ye-hi accompanied her husband and chewed bullets to make them more destructive when he fired them. When Kingfisher was killed, Nan-ye-hi seized his gun and joined the fight, helping to defeat the Creeks. The victory ended a long war between the two nations and resulted in a large land cession to the Cherokees. Nan-ye-hi shared in the property seized by the Cherokees, including a slave, and earned the office of Beloved Woman.9 After Kingfisher’s death, Nan-ye-hi responded to the growing importance of trade in Cherokee life by marrying an Irish trader, Bryan Ward, who had also participated in the battle at Taliwa. Through this marriage, Nan-ye-hi became known as Nancy Ward, and the couple had a daughter, Betsey. Responding to mistreatment by the British, the Cherokees attacked their former ally in 1760\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n5\n\nduring the period when the British were fighting the French. Bryan Ward left the Cherokee nation and joined the English army but returned to his wife and family after the Cherokee war was over in late 1761. By 1764 Nan-ye-hi and Bryan had separated and Bryan returned to South Carolina.10 The Cherokees recognized Great Britain as the governing authority for the eastern seaboard colonies, but it was a troubled alliance. After the defeat of the French in 1763, England attempted to strengthen the alliance by issuing the Proclamation of 1763, which forbade settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, but migrants pressured Cherokees by settling on their land on the eastern slope of the mountains. The Cherokees were ambivalent about the newcomers, wanting trade but uncomfortable with the encroachments on their lands. To accommodate the new settlements, English negotiators, led by John Stuart, superintendent for the Southern Department, pressed for land cessions from the Cherokees from the mid-1760s until the early 1770s. The chiefs, including the primary chiefs of the Overhill Cherokees, Oconostota and Attakullakulla, and the Women’s Council headed by Nan-ye-hi considered how to handle these new challenges. The Cherokee councilors initially agreed to sell property in return for British promises to provide trade at good prices and to establish firm boundary lines, a strategy that kept the peoples separate while allowing for commercial interaction. On each new marking of the line, in 1767, in 1769, and in the early 1770s, Cherokee women and men observed the surveying of the lines to ensure that they were accurate.11 By the time the parties marked the boundary in the early 1770s, settlers and their slaves were already moving onto Overhill Cherokee lands, which were on the western side of the Appalachians into what is now eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, lands claimed by North Carolina and Virginia. Nan-ye-hi and her daughters, Ka-ti and Betsey, and Ka-ti’s husband, John Walker, resided in Citigo, a small village in this region. The trans-Appalachian settlements represented a different experience for the Overhill people. Traders previously lived in the Cherokee villages, married Cherokee women, were largely integrated into Cherokee life, and in significant measure were under Cherokee control. But the new settlements, involving larger numbers of whites governing themselves, threatened these arrangements.12 The Cherokees’ greatest concern was the encroachment by immigrants on Cherokee lands. Many frontier people settled on Cherokee land, believing that as civilized white farmers they had superior land rights to those of savage natives who used large tracts of land for hunting. The most dramatic appropriation of Cherokee property occurred with Henderson’s Treaty in 1775. William Henderson, a North Carolina speculator acting as a private party, asserted that he\n\n6\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nobtained deeds from the Cherokees conveying much of present-day Kentucky and Tennessee north of the Cumberland River. Although there is no documentation that Nan-ye-hi attended Henderson’s treaty conference, it is likely that she was present. Attakullakulla, Oconostota, and Willinawaw were the primary chiefs present, and Ellis Harlan and Isaac Thomas, traders who were Nan-yehi’s close associates, served as interpreters. The Cherokees believed that whites could only change boundary lines with the consent of the British government and contended for years afterward that they did not give up their lands. Along with the chiefs, the women almost certainly did not support a land cession. Oconostota’s wife became very uneasy when a trader told her that the chiefs had signed a deed for the lands, and she went to talk to the chiefs about it.13 During the year after the conference, whites made it clear that they interpreted the deeds as land grants, and new settlers flooded into the region. Many of the Cherokee warriors and chiefs threatened war against the settlements at the same time that rebellious colonists on the east coast were declaring their independence from England. While British Indian superintendent John Stuart urged restraint by the Cherokees because he wanted to protect loyalist settlers, a delegation of Shawnees from the north came to a council in Chota in the summer of 1776 and called for war. The elderly Attakullakulla and Oconostota refused the war belts proffered by the Shawnees, and Nan-ye-hi responded coolly to the northern Indians. Attakullakulla’s son, Tsi-yugunsini, and his followers accepted the belts. Led by Tsi-yugunsini, the warriors decided to drive the whites off of Cherokee lands.14 Many historians portray Tsi-yugunsini as Nan-ye-hi’s cousin—casting the two as the major players in a family drama between a warrior who fought for his country and a woman whose main goal was peace. However, this characterization is misleading on two counts. In Cherokee terms, Tsi-yugunsini was not related to Nan-ye-hi. Attakullakulla was Tsi-yugunsini’s father, but Tsi-yugunsini belonged to his mother’s clan. Attakullakulla was related to Nan-ye-hi as her uncle because he was her mother’s brother, making both of them members of the Wolf clan. Historians do not know which clan Tsi-yugunsini belonged to, but since Cherokees did not marry their own clan members at that time, he was not of the Wolf clan. The second problem with characterization is that both Tsi-yugunsini and Nan-ye-hi pursued similar goals. Both wanted to preserve Cherokee lands, and both sought trade relations that would benefit the Cherokees. But the two disagreed about the best strategy to realize their goals.15 Tsi-yugunsini’s war plans ran counter to Nan-ye-hi’s strategies of containment and alliance. The British, Attakullakulla, Nan-ye-hi, and the Women’s Council saw the tramontane people as disobedient British subjects to be dealt with by\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n7\n\nthe English, who would honor the boundary lines. Nan-ye-hi dispatched two traders, Isaac Thomas and William Fallin, to alert the settlers of Tsi-yugunsini’s attack. This warning allowed many of the settlers to repel the warriors. Writers, particularly those who portray Tsi-yugunsini as a hero resisting white encroachment, explain Nan-ye-hi’s actions as something other than betrayal by casting her as a woman of peace who sought friendship with the culturally or militarily superior white people.16 However, Nan-ye-hi opposed the war not because she loved white people or thought them more advanced or stronger, but because she believed that conflict would weaken British efforts to control the encroachers and would destroy necessary commercial relations. During the attack, the warriors took as a prisoner Lydia Bean, one of the oldest settlers, and condemned her to burn. Nan-ye-hi acted to avoid further bloodshed by exercising her prerogative as a Beloved Woman to free the captive. In contrast to the traditional custom, Nan-ye-hi did not adopt Bean, because Nan-ye-hi did not intend to incorporate her into the tribe. Rather she dispatched her brother and her son to return Bean to her home, where allegedly her husband gave Nan-ye-hi one hundred pounds sterling in gratitude.17 The Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia militias responded to the Cherokee attacks by waging a new kind of war on the Cherokees—destroying towns, supplies, and homes. Approximately four hundred Cherokees attended a peace conference with North Carolina and Virginia commissioners at Long Island in the Overhill country in July 1777. The major chiefs present were Oconostota, Attakullakulla, Willinawaw, Onitossitah (Old Tassel), and Savanukeh (the Raven). Oconostota told the conference that because of his age he assigned his power to speak to Onitossitah and Savanukeh, who conducted all of the negotiations. The Women’s Council did not concern itself with the conference, probably because it understood the purpose to be to make peace after the latest war, a task primarily for the warriors. To the surprise of the Cherokees, the North Carolina commissioners forced a land cession by threatening more military actions. Breaking with past custom, North Carolina refused to compensate the Cherokees.18 North Carolina’s arrogant actions at the treaty negotiations alienated many important peace chiefs, and several, including Savanukeh and Nan-ye-hi’s Wolf clan relatives Willinawaw and Tuskegateehee, joined Tsi-yugunsini, creating a realignment of power in the peace faction. After Savanukeh’s defection, Onitossitah continued as the primary peace chief of the Upper Towns until his murder in 1788. Upon Attakullakulla’s death around 1778, Nan-ye-hi became the most prominent diplomat in the Wolf clan and asserted a stronger role as the peace chief speaking for the women.19\n\n8\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nBy 1778 the Women’s Council and the peace chiefs realized the implications of the spreading Revolutionary War—Britain no longer controlled its American subjects. Militias made war as a way to take land and to destroy towns. The Women’s Council and the chiefs worked to establish a kinship with American officials who could control the immigrants in order to protect their lands and to sustain commerce. As head of the Women’s Council, Nan-ye-hi used the diplomatic strategy of marriage, and Nan-ye-hi and other members of the Women’s Council, for the first time, exerted their authority as matriarchs to speak at treaty conferences. Cherokee women exercised power through the political influence of their kin, a route taken by Nan-ye-hi through the marriage of her daughters to important white traders and diplomats. Nan-ye-hi’s older daughter, Ka-ti, married John Walker, a white trader who provided access to goods during the early years of white settlement, and later Ellis Harlan, a trader, interpreter, and emissary for Nan-ye-hi. Nan-ye-hi’s younger daughter, Betsey, made the most influential match, marrying Joseph Martin, North Carolina and Virginia’s Indian agent to the Cherokees. Following a common practice, Martin had a Virginia wife and children who were aware of the arrangement. The marriage probably took place in 1778, and the couple had dual residences—one home at Long Island near the white settlements in eastern Tennessee and another with or near Nan-ye-hi, Ka-ti, and Harlan at Citico. Their son, James, was born in Citico in 1780, and after that they had a daughter, Nanny. The Wolf clan recognized Martin as a relation—giving him connections to the most influential clan of the nation.20 Joseph Martin came to share many of Nan-ye-hi’s goals for the Cherokees. He was an early settler in Tennessee who planned to speculate in land. Although he never abandoned his speculations, Martin came to see events from the Cherokee perspective and to view the Cherokees as a people entitled to fairness. Often reviled and occasionally threatened by the frontier people for his support of the Cherokees, Martin pleaded their case to the North Carolina legislature and to various Virginia and North Carolina governors. In response, Virginia governor Benjamin Harrison recognized Indian rights and equated their rights to those of white people. Martin also encountered opposition from the militant factions of the Cherokees and relied on the Wolf clan for protection.21 Nan-ye-hi, Onitossitah, and Martin faced a formidable task. By 1780 westering people established towns in the Cumberland region 150 miles to the west, around present-day Nashville. Angered by the new encroachers, the dissidents, now called Chickamaugans, increased their attacks. Led by Colonel Arthur Campbell from Virginia, the militias in late 1780 invaded the Overhill country.22\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n9\n\nNan-ye-hi and Martin struggled to maintain a connection with the frontier people that would temper the violence. As the war heated up, Savanukeh plotted to kill Nan-ye-hi’s associate Isaac Thomas and some other American traders in Citico, men he believed supported the settlers. Nan-ye-hi and several other women aided the traders’ escape from Citico on November 22, 1780. On December 24, 1780, Campbell took possession of Chota. Two days later Nan-yehi intervened as a diplomat—approaching him with information, overtures of peace from the friendly chiefs, and cattle for his hungry soldiers. Undaunted by Campbell’s military force, Nan-ye-hi invited Campbell into a kinship in which he would be obligated to reciprocate with favorable treatment of the Cherokees. Campbell accepted the offer of food but deferred peace talks in order to destroy all the principal Overhill towns, including Chota and Citico. In spite of the destruction of her town, Nan-ye-hi honored her commitment by supplying the cattle. The militia took seventeen prisoners, including members of Nan-yehi’s family who, according to Campbell, “for their good offices we considered in another light.” Martin took the prisoners and Nan-ye-hi and her family to his house on Long Island where he lived with his wife, Betsey, and son, James. Martin persuaded Nan-ye-hi’s brother, Tuskegateehee, to return from Chickamauga. The destruction by the militias and pressure from the peace faction convinced the Chickamaugans to relocate further from the white settlements over the next several years. They eventually settled around Muscle Shoals (in present-day southern Tennessee and northern Alabama) in communities that became known as the Lower Towns, in contrast to the Overhill Cherokees’ Upper Towns.23 The devastation of the Overhill towns and the burning of Chota propelled the Women’s Council to undertake a more visible diplomatic presence. Ignoring white men’s denigration of women in diplomacy, Nan-ye-hi and other women pursued their diplomatic strategy by speaking publicly at several peace conferences in the 1780s. The women used matriarchal images to assert a common humanity between Cherokees and whites—a strategy that encouraged recognition of Cherokee land rights by white negotiators. In 1781 General Nathanael Greene, commander of the Continental Army in the South, convened peace talks with the Cherokees after the campaign of 1780–81. Described by Joseph Martin’s white son, William, as “one of the most superior women I ever saw,” Nan-ye-hi spoke through an interpreter for the first time to white negotiators at Greene’s conference. Nan-ye-hi ignored the Cherokee custom in which diplomats avoided assigning blame in order to create an atmosphere conducive to peacemaking. Although most of her remarks are lost or illegible, what is preserved contradicts the mythology that Nan-ye-hi spoke for peace because\n\n10\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nshe was a friend to the white people. Nan-ye-hi prefaced a plea for peace with an explicit indictment of white conduct that led to the war. “You came [illegible] and settled on our land and took it [illegible] by main force; therefore we call you [illegible]. Why then will you quarrel with us?” Invoking her considerable matriarchal authority, she chastised the Americans for breaking the 1777 Long Island treaty. “We [women] did never concern [ourselves with] the former treaty, which has been broken, but we do in this and on our account, who are your mothers, let it never be broken.”24 Nan-ye-hi understood that settlers believed that white claims to land were superior to those of “savage” Indians. She crafted a web of fictive motherhood to challenge these assumptions: “You know women are always looked upon as nothing, but we are your mothers. You are our sons. Our cry is all for peace. Let it continue because we are your mothers. This peace must last forever. Let your women’s sons be ours, and let our sons be yours.”25 Nan-ye-hi’s metaphor extended beyond the linkage of motherhood with peace to suggest that native and white men should consider themselves to be the sons of both races—an image that dissolved racial and cultural boundaries in a vision of parity. Five older women, almost certainly members of the Women’s Council, affirmed this vision of universal humanity in their address to the council on behalf of women at the conclusion of the peace talks. They sought to bolster their authority by having a male chief, Scolacutta (Hanging Maw), whose wife was an important woman and probably on the Women’s Council, accompany them. They whispered their speech to him, which he delivered to the assembled audience. A transcribed version of only part of their remarkable address survives in the Nathanael Greene Papers: We the women of the Cherokee nation now speak to you. We are mothers, and have many sons, some of them warriors and beloved men. We call you also our sons. We have a right to call you so, because you are the sons of mothers, and all descended from the same woman at first. We say you are our sons, because by women, you were brought forth into this world, nursed, suckled, and raised up to be men before you reached your present greatness. You are our sons. Why should there be any difference amongst us? We live on the same land with you, and our people are mixed with white blood: one third of our [people are] mixed with white blood.26\n\nBuilding on Nan-ye-hi’s construction, these women imagined a diplomatic motherhood, one they linked to Selu, the first woman and a powerful spiritual figure. They reminded white men of the importance of women. Responding to white notions of superiority, they stressed the similarities between Indians and settlers, pointing to the fact that all were descended from the same woman\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n11\n\nand occupied the land, and that the Cherokees were increasingly people with “white blood.” During negotiations, Colonel Arthur Campbell, now one of the American commissioners, pressed for a land cession from the Cherokees as compensation for their aggressions. Nan-ye-hi answered that such a transfer impaired Cherokee survival. “We know that the white people are more and stronger than us, but will you take everything from us and leave us to starve?” Coming shortly after her support of Campbell during his military campaign, her plea successfully invoked mutual obligations between diplomatic kin who shared a common humanity. The commissioners concluded the treaty without forcing a land cession. Although Nan-ye-hi prevented a property loss, negotiations about prisoner exchanges continued into the next year. Nan-ye-hi’s influence was critical in ironing out this issue as well. A “great and beloved woman,” almost certainly Nan-ye-hi, spurred Virginia Governor Benjamin Harrison to agree to a prisoner exchange in 1782.27 After the successful establishment of a kinship in the treaty proceedings of 1781, Nan-ye-hi and Martin engaged in a series of actions that encouraged a balance of mutuality between the Cherokee and American nations. Nan-ye-hi persuaded the Upper Towns to provide corn to the starving settlers in 1782, which allowed women in the Upper Towns to convert their traditional role as farmers for their community into relationships with whites that produced greater prosperity for the Cherokees and, at times, social bonds with white fictive kin. The settlers depended on the corn for survival. By 1785 the Upper Town settlements lived primarily on the strength of the sale of their crops to the new settlements. Nan-ye-hi participated in this market, supplying crops and cattle. During his tenure at Long Island, Martin also linked the two societies, feeding needy Cherokees who visited and concluding a peace treaty with the Lower Towns in 1783, an agreement that lasted until it was broken two years later by local whites.28 Upon the conclusion of the Revolutionary War in 1783, Congress moved to establish peace with the Indians throughout the extensive western territory now claimed by the United States. After making treaties with the northern tribes, U.S. Commissioners met with the Cherokees at Hopewell in November 1785. Because North Carolina had not ceded its claims to its western lands to the United States, North Carolina sent William Blount, a major speculator with lands in the Tennessee region, as a treaty commissioner to object to the proceedings.29 Onitossitah was the primary peace chief for the Cherokees. He sought payment for Cherokee lands taken illegally by settlers and refused to give up more lands. He then introduced “one of our beloved women . . . who has born and\n\n12\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nraised up warriors.” Now about fifty years old, Nan-ye-hi followed Onitossitah’s grievances with a vision of a matriarchal kinship: I am fond of hearing that there is a peace, and I hope you have now taken us by the hand in real friendship. I have a pipe and a little tobacco to give the commissioners to smoke in friendship. I look on you and the red people equally as my children. Your having determined on peace is most pleasing to me, for I have seen much trouble during the late war. I am old, but I hope yet to bear children, who will grow up and people our nation, as we are now to be under the protection of Congress, and shall have no more disturbance. The talk I have given, is from the young warriors I have raised in my town, as well as myself. They rejoice that we have peace, and we hope the chain of friendship will never more be broke.30\n\nAs she had in 1781, Nan-ye-hi suggested that the settlers had caused the disturbance because they did not abide by the rules of “real friendship,” which required that they respect Cherokee land rights. She countered by casting red and white children as equal, then gathered both progeny into her clan. Moreover, her claim to speak for young warriors established that she had acquired authority beyond that traditionally bestowed on Beloved Women, who spoke only for the women. Nan-ye-hi and the other Cherokee negotiators persuaded the federal government to recognize the boundaries set in the 1777 treaty, except for some areas in Cumberland and in eastern Tennessee with numerous settlers, for which the Cherokees were paid, and to void claims to Cherokee lands made by North Carolina in 1783 and by settlers in eastern Tennessee in 1785. On behalf of North Carolina, William Blount protested the agreement.31 Because the United States had no authority in the Tennessee region, settlers continued to move onto Cherokee lands. The Chickamaugans allied with the Creeks and resumed their attacks. Angered by the murder of an encroacher’s family in the French Broad area in May 1788, a militia company headed by local leader John Sevier lured Onitossitah and several other Upper Town chiefs to a peace conference the next month and murdered them. The Cherokee nation united in war against the eastern settlements, launching a major attack on Gillespie’s Station in eastern Tennessee in October that killed a number of settlers. This time Nan-ye-hi did not warn the settlers. Fighting continued into the winter. Nan-ye-hi’s ally Joseph Martin worked with the women and the friendly chiefs to protect them from the effects of the war. Martin provisioned his hometown of Citico with corn at his own expense, supplied salt to the women, and sent some Cherokees to his South Carolina and Georgia plantations to protect them from Sevier.32\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n13\n\nIn North Carolina, the United States and the Cherokees carried on peace talks from fall 1788 until May 1789. Although the Chickamaugans now exerted a strong diplomatic presence, the Women’s Council also spoke in these talks, urging peace for the sake of the children. In a Grand Talk from the head men and warriors of the nation addressed to the Governor of North Carolina in 1789, the women made their voice explicit at the conclusion of the talk: “Now, this is our beloved women’s talk; they say they have heard our great talks, and they hope to live at home in their houses in satisfaction, and they have told their warriors to be at peace from this time out, that they may raise their children in happiness.” When North Carolina ceded its western lands to the United States in 1789, Congress organized these lands into the Southwest Territory. President George Washington rewarded North Carolina for its cession by appointing William Blount, the speculator who protested the 1785 treaty, as governor and as Indian commissioner, replacing Joseph Martin.33 Washington’s actions were a victory for the settlers seeking new lands and a setback for the Cherokees. Upon losing his appointment, Martin returned to his family in Virginia, leaving Betsey Ward and his daughter in the Cherokee nation but taking their son with him to educate him so that when he was grown he might be useful to the Cherokee people. With Martin’s departure and the growing power of the Chickamaugans in diplomacy, Nan-ye-hi no longer spoke at treaty conferences, but she maintained her position at the head of the Women’s Council. As late as 1819 Indian agent Reuben Lewis related that Nan-ye-hi’s “advice and council borders on supreme.” Most of Nan-ye-hi’s extended family lived with or near her, and Nan-ye-hi also exercised influence through her clan, primarily through her brother, Tuskegateehee, and her children, Ka-ti, Betsey, and Hiskyteehee, and their extended family connections.34 Operating under a new constitution, the United States signed its first treaty with the Cherokees in 1791 on the Holston River near Knoxville, where Governor Blount met a new coalition of Upper and Lower Town Cherokee headmen. The record does not reflect whether Nan-ye-hi was present. Her brother, Tuskegateehee, was one of the treaty signers. Chickamaugan diplomats conducted almost all of the negotiations on the Cherokee side and were joined by Scolacutta, now the primary Upper Town peace chief. The Chickamaugans advanced many of the points raised earlier by the Women’s Council and the Upper Town chiefs. They pressed Governor Blount to agree that red people had the same right as any other human being to enjoy their property, and Blount agreed that the federal government considered Cherokees “as good as ourselves, not one better than the other.” The conference notes taken by the secretary for the Southwest Territory, Daniel Smith, reflect that the Cherokees\n\n14\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nopposed a land cession but inexplicably reversed their position and agreed to the treaty.35 During the next several years, much of the nation united in war in opposition to the purported Holston land grant. Through her family, Nan-ye-hi sought to maintain a kinship with the federal government. Following the methods used by his sister, Tuskegateehee and other chiefs in 1792 warned John Sevier that six hundred troops were advancing toward the settlements. Tuskegateehee was part of the Cherokee delegation that arranged a peace mission to Congress in Philadelphia in 1793. Nan-ye-hi’s daughter, Betsey Ward, was one of the diplomats gathered at Scolacutta’s house to journey to Philadelphia when a Tennessee militia attacked the gathering, killed eight people including several chiefs, and wounded Scolacutta, his wife, and Betsey Ward. Samuel Candy, probably the son of Nan-ye-hi’s daughter Ka-ti, was one of the interpreters chosen by the Cherokees at the December 1794 talks—one of several conferences that resulted in a lasting peace between the Cherokees and the United States.36 By the time of peace in 1795 the Cherokees inhabited a different world. The settler population in the region exploded. Newcomers vastly outnumbered native peoples and created strong pressures for more Indian land. The Cherokee people themselves disagreed about how to deal with the United States until 1809, during which time a cacophony of voices spoke for the Cherokees on international affairs. White agents took advantage of the divisions to pressure, and in some cases to bribe, the Cherokee negotiators to agree to more land sales. The Women’s Council was concerned about the land sales but deferred to the chiefs’ judgment about diplomacy in this chaotic period. Tuskegateehee was one of the representatives who agreed to cessions. In 1798, 1802, and 1805, Tuskegateehee signed treaties that ceded land to the United States. By 1806 the United States recognized Tuskegateehee as a chief in his region by giving him annuity money to be distributed to his district. In 1809, though, Tuskegateehee and a group of dissident chiefs, almost certainly supported by the Women’s Council, unified the Cherokees to halt land sales.37 Although the Women’s Council failed to press its agenda opposing land sales prior to 1809, women continued to advance the Cherokee notion of a relational peace that included reciprocal obligations by visiting governmental officials and by attending peace conferences. Women also insisted on the permanence of the Cherokee nation by marking treaty lines. Although white norms meant that federal government officials often ignored the presence and voice of the women, local officials took notice. When Governor John Sevier of Tennessee discussed the goods he needed for the upcoming treaty in 1808, he penned a rare acknowledgment of the women’s authority. “The goods would have a pleas-\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n15\n\ning and alluring effect on the Indians,” he wrote, “particularly the females and young men, who have their weight and influence.”38 With peace achieved after 1795, many women turned their attention to building a stronger economy that would support an independent nation and improve their own well-being. Women increasingly joined men in hunting. Women also supplied food, livestock, and cotton to the exploding immigrant population, bringing in considerable cash. Nan-ye-hi and her family continued the traditional practice of allying with white men who linked them to material resources. Visiting Bryan Ward and his family in South Carolina on numerous occasions, Nan-ye-hi and Betsey Ward maintained a connection with Ward that had economic advantages for all parties. By the 1790s Nan-ye-hi and Betsey were prosperous. Moravian missionaries who visited Betsey’s residence in Wachowee on the Hiwassee River in 1799 described it as a “fine plantation” of four houses surrounded by high fences. She grew a number of crops, had livestock, spun cotton, and owned black slaves. Many of Nan-ye-hi’s other female descendants married merchants.39 Nan-ye-hi’s adoption of some American economic practices does not tell us how she incorporated them into her Cherokee identity. She may have accepted Euro-American ideas of self-interest, or she may have seen her increase in wealth as part of a process that benefited all Cherokee people. We do not know if she observed the traditional practices of redistribution. Although the federal government sought to “civilize” the Cherokees by encouraging them to farm rather than hunt, to accept white gender roles, and to convert to Christianity, Nan-ye-hi retained much of her Cherokee heritage. Unlike many Cherokees who welcomed white travelers, no travelers report visiting Nan-ye-hi in her village. Nan-ye-hi’s active involvement in political affairs throughout her life defied American civilized gender expectations. While several other prominent Cherokee women converted to Christianity in the early part of the eighteenth century, there is no evidence that Nan-ye-hi or any of her close kin did, and they may have been opposed to it. When Moravian missionaries visited her daughter Betsey’s home, in her absence they spoke to Betsey’s “cousin” Walker, probably Ka-ti’s son. Walker listened politely to their explanation about God but refused to convene the Cherokees so that the Moravians could spread their message about Christianity.40 After the War of 1812 the government again urged the Cherokees to sell or exchange their lands and to move across the Mississippi. Shortly after a secret meeting in 1817 between the federal Indian agent and some of the Lower Town chiefs who favored the move, Nan-ye-hi and twelve other women drafted a petition opposing the exchange of land for property across the Mississippi.\n\n16\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nNan-ye-hi made her last recorded appearance in May 1817 at the Cherokee Council of Amohee, where she submitted the petition to the council. Speaking now as mothers of the nation, the women implored the chiefs to refuse to agree to a land exchange: Our beloved children and head men of the Cherokee nation, we address you warriors in council. We have raised all of you on the land which we now have, which God gave us to inhabit and raise provisions. We know that our country has once been extensive but by repeated sales has become circumscribed to a small tract and never have thought it our duty to interfere in the disposition of it till now. . . . We do not wish to go to an unknown country which we have understood some of our children wish to go over the Mississippi but this act of our children would be like destroying your mothers. Your mothers your sisters ask and beg of you not to part with any more of our lands. We say . . . you are descendants and take pity on our request, but keep it for our growing children for it was the good will of our creator to place us here and you know our father the great president will not allow his white children to take our country away. Only keep your hands off of paper talks for it is our own country. . . . Nancy Ward to her children warriors to take pity and listen to the talks of your sisters. . . . I have great many grand children which I wish them to do well on our land.41\n\nFive of the other twelve signers were related to or connected to Nan-ye-hi through her daughter Ka-ti. Ka-ti signed as Caty Harlan, her name after her marriage to Ellis Harlan. Signer Jenny Walker McIntosh was Nan-ye-hi’s granddaughter by Ka-ti and her first husband, John Walker. Elizabeth Walker and Asty Walker, probably related to John Walker, were also petitioners. Jennie Walker McIntosh had previously been married to Charles Fox, who was likely related to Susanna Fox, another signer. The petition was successful—the Council of Amohee in 1817 adopted a new governmental structure designed to prevent further land cessions. Legend says that Nan-ye-hi sent a relative with her walking cane to vote at Amohee.42 In spite of the action at Amohee, federal agents pressured some of the chiefs into signing a vaguely worded treaty in July 1817 that the United States interpreted as granting large tracts of land in Georgia and Tennessee. After the treaty, Nan-ye-hi acted to secure land for her family by registering a piece of land on Mouse Creek and bequeathing it to her “beloved” granddaughter Jenny McIntosh and her heirs. In 1819 the government obtained another cession of much of the Overhill land under duress, forcing many Cherokees, including Nan-ye-hi, to move from their ancestral homelands.43\n\nNan-ye-hi (Nancy Ward)\n\n17\n\nLater generations say that, after losing her home, Nan-ye-hi ran an inn at the Womankiller Ford of the Ocowee in eastern Tennessee. The traveling public called her Granny Ward. Nan-ye-hi died around 1824 at Womankiller Ford. Her great-grandson said that those attending her on her deathbed reported that she died at dawn and “when her breath left her the light that was in the room went out and a dim light was seen going out at the door.” Twelve years after her death, the United States moved almost all the eastern Cherokees west of the Mississippi along the Trail of Tears. After the Cherokee removal, Nan-ye-hi’s heirs filed suit for the land that Nan-ye-hi gave to her granddaughter Jenny in 1818, but the United States rejected their claim in 1847.44 In the end, what do we know about Nan-ye-hi? The evidence we have suggests that the mythology about Nan-ye-hi tells a misleading story. Nan-ye-hi did not act in exceptional ways to promote peace because she was a friend to white people, admired their civilization, or felt defeated by the militias. Rather she used her clan connections and acted in concert with other Cherokee women and peace chiefs to create diplomatic kinships in order to retain ancestral lands and to preserve Cherokee well-being. Nan-ye-hi challenged the idea that whites were superior and resisted most acculturation promoted by the United States— she exercised her considerable power as a Cherokee woman, lived most of her life within the Cherokee community, avoided American visitors until forced from her home, and refused to adopt Christianity. Nor did Americans reward her for her imagined role as a friendly Pocahontas. Although she had considerable success, she eventually lost her ancestral lands. Not long after her death, her people were removed and her granddaughter’s heirs lost the land that Nan-ye-hi tried to retain for them. If Nan-ye-hi’s story is ultimately one of defeat, why do biographers rewrite the story of her life? Why do writers create a narrative in which she successfully sought peace rather than one in which she failed to preserve her homeland? The mythology about Nan-ye-hi serves several purposes. It allows those who are not indigenous to this continent to imagine an American history in which farsighted Native Americans acceded to white superiority rather than one that acknowledges the damage that newcomers caused the first peoples. This account also constructs Nan-ye-hi’s biography to be a success story in a tradition that prefers to write American history as a chronicle of progress. In this retelling of Nan-ye-hi’s life, authors in an era that promotes multiculturalism dream a world in which a concordant relationship between very different cultures is possible. How would Nan-ye-hi tell her story? Perhaps she would not see it as one of disillusionment but a story of persistence—of a woman of the Wolf clan with\n\n18\n\nCynthia Cumfer\n\nmany descendants and of a leader of a people who survive today. She might rue her losses but remember her life in a beautiful country—the home of her ancestors. She might believe that white people had irretrievably destroyed the kinship between Cherokees and whites, or she could have faith in the spiritual forces that she believed in as a Cherokee woman, hopeful that Cherokee and American women and men will someday restore balance between the Cherokees and their diplomatic kin.\n\nNotes This chapter is drawn from Separate Peoples, One Land: The Minds of Cherokees, Blacks, and Whites on the Tennessee Frontier by Cynthia Cumfer.

Nearly six feet tall and strong-featured like Minerva, she was a Scotswoman brought up in England to be a lady out of the pages of Jane Austen, and by now she was an ornament in the drawing rooms of the rich and famous on both sides of the Atlantic. Brilliantly educated even by the standards of the upper middle class among whom she was raised, she had recently spent a week with Thomas Jefferson at Monticello and shortly thereafter parted from her beloved friend and mentor, and possibly her lover, the Marquis de Lafayette. Emulating the pattern of his passionate involvement in the American Revolution and inspired by a bold vision of racial justice she was striking out in this, her second visit to the United States on her own.1 At thirty years old, Frances Wright was on the verge of becoming the first woman in America to act publicly to oppose slavery. After her initial two-year visit with her younger sister Camilla in 1818, when she was twenty-three, she published Views of Society and Manners in America, a panegyric to a republican experiment disdained by most Englishmen of her class. But she considered slavery both a blight and a menace to an otherwise superior social and political system. To take personal responsibility and address this evil directly, then, she had decided to establish a commune to discover how slaves could be responsibly educated and subsequently freed with no financial loss to those who owned them—an experiment that, if successful, could be emulated by people all through the South.2 23\n\nFanny Wright 1881. John Chester Buttre, engraver. Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.\n\nFanny Wright\n\n25\n\nHer companion in this bold venture was an impressive and engaging squarejawed Englishman named George Flower, who had emigrated from Hertfordshire less than a decade earlier and, with a handful of compatriots, had founded a fiercely antislavery farming community in Albion, Illinois. She had met him at Harmonie, Indiana, a town on the Wabash River built by an evangelical German sect called the Rappites and labeled by some the “Wonder of the West.” They were now leaving this, their first American home, for a new location outside Pittsburgh, and Harmonie had just been bought for $125,000 by the controversial Welshman Robert Owen to become New Harmony, the site for his New Moral World. Early nineteenth-century America was dotted with intentional communities, and even before Fanny Wright got the idea, Flower, who was nine years older, had imagined that slaves could surely build a town and create a community like illiterate German peasants had at Harmonie in little more than a decade. Flower was at once a kindred spirit, a practical farmer, and a man who treated black people as peers, and soon Fanny had come to consider him an equal partner in this hugely ambitious undertaking.3 Tennessee had seemed a sympathetic site for their experiment, as the state had twenty antislavery societies by 1823, with a membership of about six hundred. So Fanny Wright and George Flower made a special trip to Nashville to see General Andrew Jackson, who tacitly approved their plan and directed them to a tract of land along the Wolf River on the Chickasaw Bluffs about fifteen miles inland. By late November 1825 Fanny had bought 320 acres there. The soil was second rate, but she thought the area relatively healthful, as it was back from the Mississippi River and away from the marshes. She continued to negotiate for other 320-acre sections and by 1828 owned about 1,800 acres. That fall she also bought ten slaves—six men and four women—in the markets of Nashville, and using the Chickasaw name for the little Wolf River, she called her commune Nashoba. They then wrote a proposal, had it printed as an anonymous circular, and sent it to journals like The Genius of Universal Emancipation and to a number of people they considered sympathetic. Fanny had inherited a small fortune from an uncle who had owned valuable land in India, and she was plunging a substantial portion of it into Nashoba. George Flower would donate his time, skill, and experience, and others they had met along the way had seemed interested in joining them. To succeed they would need considerable help, for their goal was to create a model others could emulate. It was in the infinite extension of her plan that Fanny saw the doom of slavery, for when planters discovered that Nashoba’s way of working was economically superior to the slave system, surely, she thought, they would be inspired to follow her example.\n\n26\n\nCelia Morris\n\nSo in the fall of 1825 they were trolling for donations of money and slaves, proposing initially to put fifty to a hundred slaves to work on the equivalent of two sections of public land, and calculating that after five years, under the system they envisioned, a slave could repay his or her purchase price. To inspire the slaves to work sufficiently hard and purposefully, they would hold out the promise of liberty along with the liberty and education of their children. The centerpiece of their proposal was a school where adult slaves could be educated in the hours after their work in the fields—a notion inspired by the evening study meetings where the nineteenth-century British working class fought so doggedly for its self-respect. At the same time, their children would learn in schools of industry similar to those Robert Owen had established in New Lanark, Scotland, and now proposed for New Harmony, Indiana. Informed by the most progressive educational methods of their day, the teachers would never push their students beyond their strengths but instead would blend their time to learn and their time to work. Calculating that they could begin such an establishment with just over $40,000, they counted on making about $10,000 a year in cotton. They considered their proposal’s details provisional and expected to improvise as they went, but essentially they were trying to do good by exploiting people’s greed. Flower argued that the great obstacle to ending slavery was the amount of money bound up in slaves, so he reasoned that if Nashoba could make at least a 6 percent profit, which he thought a low estimate, they could persuade capitalists to invest in such institutions and make money. Finally, they assured their potential donors that freed slaves would be colonized outside the United States. Though skeptical of colonization societies and a true egalitarian, Fanny had acquiesced to Jefferson’s fears of a biracial society by tying her plan to colonization. She simply thought it politically necessary to do so. Although for personal reasons Fanny refused the $8,000 Lafayette offered, he did what he could, sending copies of the proposal to such influential people as James Monroe and Chief Justice John Marshall and asking them to judge it candidly and to write him or Fanny with their suggestions. Monroe approved the project on the understanding that the slaves would be colonized. James Madison was highly skeptical, pointing out that the Harmonists and Shakers were inspired by a religious fervor for which Fanny could offer no substitute of remotely equal power. But Jefferson, though evasive, was by no means discouraging. Wondering too if “moral urgencies” were sufficient to prompt slaves to work hard, he nonetheless concluded on a positive note: “You are young, dear Madam, and have powers of mind which may do much in exciting others in\n\nFanny Wright\n\n27\n\nthis arduous task. I am confident they will be so exerted, and I pray to Heaven for their success, and that you may be rewarded with the blessings which such efforts merit.”4 In mid-November 1825 Flower left Fanny in Memphis to supervise the building of cabins and the clearing of land, and in eleven winter days he rode the 370 miles to Albion, Illinois, where he expected to gather up his wife and three children, along with Fanny’s sister Camilla, and return soon to Nashoba. Meanwhile, he wrote the Rappites in Pittsburgh to inquire about a steam engine that would run both a grist mill and a cotton gin, and he ordered glass, cotton shirting, linsey for jackets and trousers, nails, hoes, axes, and assorted farm equipment. By the first of December he had sent a flatboat laden with meal, corn flour, a yoke of oxen, a wagon, two horses, and “sundry furniture and implements of husbandry” down the Mississippi toward Memphis. Fanny, in turn, wrote the Quaker merchant Jeremiah Thompson in New York that asking for money, albeit in a good cause, was a task for which she felt unsuited, but as she needed to establish a store to bypass merchants who made “exorbitant profits” on “a ruinous system of long credits,” she commissioned him to send her stout domestic cotton for shirts and sheets, white and red flannels, heavy blankets of different sizes, printed calico, several dozen heavy wool men’s socks, and sturdy shoes for men and boys. In response, Thompson donated goods worth $580 to begin the store, calling it, in his engaging Quaker way, “my mite in aid of thy good efforts.” And then their troubles really started. The winter of 1825 was so cold that the Mississippi River froze over in places, and the flatboat Flower had sent from Illinois was stopped along the way and lost, apparently forever. Then, unexpectedly summoned to Memphis, Flower was seized by a violent fever some twenty miles south of New Harmony. Terrified of catching the plague, most people shunned him, and after a frenzied search, his wife, Eliza, found him alone in a cabin, filthy and on the verge of starvation. For days he lay near death, and more than a month passed before he began to mend. Stuck in Albion due to the ice, Camilla discovered that Eliza Flower had no faith in Nashoba’s chances for success, which may be one reason the Flowers would eventually settle in Memphis, some fifteen miles from the farm George expected to manage. Benjamin Lundy, editor of The Genius of Universal Emancipation, found that many people dismissed Fanny’s idea and more than a few were hostile. A number of antislavery papers refused to publish their proposal, and Lundy innocently printed misleading information, saying that Fanny had “ample funds\n\n28\n\nCelia Morris\n\nat command, as several wealthy gentlemen have contributed largely.” But nobody had. Many had said they would send their slaves when Nashoba was flourishing, but the only contribution Fanny got was from one Robert Wilson of South Carolina, who had inherited a family of seven slaves—a pregnant mother and her six daughters—whom he had been directed by the deceased to educate and emancipate when they came of age. Revolted by slavery and unwilling to take on this huge responsibility himself, Wilson agreed to take them seven hundred miles to Nashoba. In February 1826, then, Fanny paid Wilson $446.76 for his expenses in bringing them and thereby took on seven people ludicrously unsuited to the brutal work of clearing forests, building fences, and raising cabins. The only other person who joined her during that lonesome winter was James Richardson, a Scotsman who, when she met him, had been recovering in Memphis from a painful illness. In time, Robert Dale Owen, Robert Owen’s eldest son, would describe him as “an upright, impractical, and acute metaphysician of the Thomas Brown school,” but Fanny liked talking with him. She trusted him with Nashoba’s bookkeeping and wrote that he “unites to the invaluable qualities of trust prudence and accurate attention to business a finely cultivated mind with every liberal and generous opinion and sentiment.” Only one other person she would so radically misjudge would do her such deep and lasting harm. Despite all these problems during that winter of 1826 Fanny was caught up in the thrill of a grand adventure that would call on all her strengths and resources —a possibility virtually unknown in the early nineteenth century to most white women of her class. Her contemporary Mary Shelley would be awed by the image she was creating for herself: “a woman, young rich & independent, quits the civilization of England for a life of hardship in the forests of America, that by so doing she may contribute to the happiness of her species.” Within the limits of imagery, this was true, and though accustome"
