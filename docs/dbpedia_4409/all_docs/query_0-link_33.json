        "text": "This one was a long time coming. After a four month wait, numerous behind the scenes issues and a very... poor advertising campaign, The Adventure Begins has been released! So, here's my long awaited review of it!\n\nI want to stress before I get started that my views here are not going to be reflective of the long time gap between the US and UK release; I've already complained about that enough here. I also won't be focusing on the marketing being a total shambles, as I've done that here. I'll just be focusing on the DVD as it's been released and my thoughts of the special (although I may mention them in the final thoughts section).\n\nFront Cover\n\nI've always loved the front covers of Arc's specials and this one is no exception. The dawn/dusk background is beautiful and I really like the addition of the book behind Thomas; it does a great job of encapsulating the old with the new.\n\nThat being said, considering how large Edward's role was here, it's a shame he's not standing proud next to Thomas, instead being relegated to said book. Other than that, though, I love it.\n\nRear Cover\n\nAsda haven't provided a picture of the rear cover, but take my word for it: it's great. Really understated, very simplistic, but still well done.\n\nSpecial (SPOILER ALERT)\n\nThe basic idea of the special is to tell the story of how Thomas grew from a shunting engine to the owner of his own branch line. But before anyone thinks it's just Thomas the Tank Engine adapted word for word again, there's actually much more to it than that.\n\nThe special actually starts at The Three Railway Engines, and Thomas is nowhere to be seen. Yet James is. And I'm going to tackle this now. No. I don't care. For all we know, James could have been there on trial before The Fat Controller bought him. It would explain why he's in his original black livery before his accident (by the way, that was a really lovely touch).\n\nEdward and Gordon\n\nThe special pretty much follows the main bot of the story, with Gordon getting stuck on the hill and Edward needing to help him. It starts out in the yard by Knapford Station with Gordon moaning about goods trains. For me, this part of the special shows its biggest strength overall: it's very much character driven. It shows that Thomas and Friends can keep its classic storytelling style without sticking to the storybook format.\n\nI also really liked how each character was introduced; a quick description by the narrator of the vital information, then let the characters do the rest. It was a bit of a shame the original team didn't try this route too much with the model adaptations, but I can understand them wanting to keep the familiar style of the books.\n\nThomas' Arrival\n\nI think the best introduction though went to Thomas. He's just so sweet and adorable. Also, if you listen carefully in the background, you can hear him say he comes from Brighton and has a slight boast about it. It's a really fun little tidbit that younger fans won't get, but older ones - and rail enthusiasts - would. It displays his character really well.\n\nAlso, I love his green livery. I know some have been complaining slightly since the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway livery was brown, but can you really imagine this livery selling that well?\n\nFor me, the livery they chose is the best of both worlds. It's green, which is a pretty simple colour to market, and it's based on the livery of the Southern Railway, which isn't too far away from the LB&SCR, so they could have just used that as a temporary livery since they knew he was going straight to the North Western Railway. I also like that his number is 70, a not so subtle nod as to what the special was made to commemorate..!\n\nI really liked the montage of Thomas shunting in the yard and generally getting things wrong, although playing Really Useful Engine there was pretty odd, since he wasn't particularly useful then. The montage ends with the catalyst of Thomas and Gordon, which leads to another thing I really like: things flow more naturally than the book and the original adaptation. I'm not saying they're bad by a long shot, but it's just another example of the team using the classic storytelling style without the storybook structure.\n\nThe Sad Story of Henry\n\nWe're then introduced to Henry, and told of his incident in the tunnel through Edward and shown with flashbacks. I really like this, to be honest. Remember, this is Thomas' story, so breaking away from it drastically by showing Henry's plight in its entirety would have been jarring. Besides, it was still faithful, apart from one aspect...\n\nHenry in his new shape. I'll say this: it's a distraction, nothing more. Changing Henry's shape wouldn't be like changing Thomas and James' liveries; they would have had to build a completely new model, which would probably be difficult to do thanks to time constraints. The only real problem it causes is a hand-waved excuse for Henry being unable to pull his train later, but even then, it wasn't that bad; boiler issues can affect any engine.\n\nUsing James to try and push Henry out was a very smart move. Considering the original illustration depicted an engine that looked similar to him, it made sense for the actual James to be used here. It was also better handled than the series 1 adaptation, which used Thomas because... reasons. A tank engine pushing a huge train out made absolutely no sense and lacked believability. This fixed both issues really well.\n\nThere are two other reasons why I liked Edward telling the story. The first one was subtly explained later: Henry may have felt embarrassed by the whole incident (that and he was probably focusing on the current rainfall intently). Secondly, Gordon's reaction when they reached his broken safety valve was brilliant. The humour here (visual and verbal) is another example of the team using another aspect of classic Awdry storytelling, which is lovely. It keeps everyone invested.\n\nThomas Turns Blue\n\nWe're then taken to the Steamworks where there's another montage of Thomas being repainted. I really like that the new location is used as it encapsulates what the team want to do perfectly: mixing old with new. And I also liked the pink undercoat nod to Tickled Pink. While some may think that Thomas' reaction to it was enforcing stereotypes (I'll admit it irked me on re-watch), it's not something that they dwell upon, so it's just another distraction."
