        "text": "Scroll for updates**\n\nIt’s a busy news day for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex!\n\nFirst up — Harry and Meghan will appear in an exclusive sit-down interview with Jane Pauley for “CBS Sunday Morning” where the couple share details about their latest initiative, The Parents Network which supports parents whose children have been impacted by online harm, set to launch next week.\n\nDuring the interview, Meghan praised their children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3, calling them “amazing.” She emphasized the natural desire of parents to protect their children, especially in the current digital age.\n\n“All you want to do as parents is protect them. And so, as we can see what’s happening in the online space, we know that there’s a lot of work to be done there. We’re just happy to be able to be a part of a change for good,” Meghan shared.\n\nHarry highlighted the critical role parents must play amid the growing social media crisis.\n\n“At this point, we’ve got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder. And even the best first responders in the world wouldn’t be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this,” he said.\n\nThe full interview with Jane Pauley will air this Sunday at 9am EST on “CBS Sunday Morning,” where the Duke and Duchess will delve deeper into their continued efforts to support parents who have lost children to online bullying and abuse. The couple’s dedication to creating safer online environments for children is a testament to their ongoing commitment to making a positive impact.\n\nSee a preview of the interview below —\n\nIt is also available to stream on the CBS News app starting at 12 PM EST on Sunday.\n\nRead about the Parents’ Network on Archewell here.\n\nHarry and Meghan Are Planning a Tour of Colombia\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are gearing up for their next international adventure, and this time, it’s to the vibrant country of Colombia. This trip marks their first joint visit to South America, focusing on mental health activism and creating safer online environments for youth.\n\nThe announcement of their upcoming tour came from Colombia’s Vice President Francia Márquez. In her statement, she highlighted the significance of the visit —\n\n“During their trip, The Duke and Duchess will join me in visiting Bogotá, as well as the Caribbean and Pacific regions of Cartagena and Cali. In these vibrant locations, they will have the exceptional opportunity to engage with leaders, youth, and women who embody the aspirations and voices of Colombians committed to progress. In addition to these meaningful interactions, The Duke and Duchess will experience the rich heritage of Colombia.”\n\nHarry and Meghan’s visit is centered around their continued advocacy for mental health and safer online spaces for young people. Their engagements in Colombia will involve discussions with local leaders and organizations dedicated to these causes, fostering global collaboration and understanding.\n\nBeyond their philanthropic activities, the couple will immerse themselves in the cultural richness of Colombia. From the bustling streets of Bogotá to the coastal beauty of Cartagena and the vibrant life of Cali, the couple will experience the diverse culture and history that Colombia has to offer.\n\nThis Colombian tour will be the Sussexes’ third international trip this year. In February, they visited Canada to celebrate the preparations for the 2025 Invictus Games for winter adaptive sports. In May, they traveled to Nigeria, where they attended events supporting military families and participated in athletic activities, including a basketball game and a polo match.\n\nFor the interview Meghan wore Ralph Lauren and Cartier.\n\nHer button down shirt is the Ralph Lauren Adrien Relaxed Fit Linen-Blend Shirt, reg. $890 now $620.\n\nMeghan’s trousers are the Ralph Lauren ‘Evanne’ Linen-Blend Pant, reg. $1090 now $760.\n\nGet the look with these options from Gap and Old Navy!\n\nGap linen shirt, $27 / Gap linen pants, $60 w/50% off at checkout – $30 / Old Navy linen shirt, $28 / Old Navy linen pants, $25\n\nUPDATE 8/4: Meghan wore a pair of nude, d’orsay style, double ankle strap pumps.

Meghan first wore the earrings in September 2023 during the Invictus Games in Germany.\n\nThanks to our follower, Amy B. for spotting the earrings!\n\nIn Other News —\n\nIf you’ve been glued to the Olympics this past week like I have, you’ve undoubtedly witnessed some incredible moments across various events. Personally, two of my favorite events are Women’s Gymnastics and Swimming. It’s been thrilling to watch the U.S. teams clinch medals and create unforgettable moments.\n\nTuesday brought the excitement of Simone Biles’ All-Around Gold medal, followed by Sunisa Lee’s Bronze medal in the All-Around event today! The women still have their individual events this weekend, where Simone has the chance to win a few more medals and become the most decorated US gymnast.\n\nAnother team that amazed me this week is the US Women’s Rugby Team, who won their first Olympic medal, taking home the Bronze! Pair that with the outstanding performance of the Women’s Water Polo team, and the excitement just keeps building!\n\nIn Swimming, Katie Ledecky secured another gold medal in the 1500m Freestyle last night and followed it up with a silver in the team Freestyle medley today, bringing her impressive medal tally to 13!\n\nPeacock streaming services covers all of the events while DirecTV and cable offer coverage on NBC, USA, E!, CNBC in addition to a few other channels based on your service.\n\nGo Team USA!"
