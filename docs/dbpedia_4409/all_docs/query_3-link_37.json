        "text": "-READ IT!!!!-\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN– Oh, forget it!!!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled Review, Already in Progress-\n\nHello, I’m The Detective Librarian and at last, I get to review the one thing that I’ve been waiting for, a long LONG time!!!!!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: You mean, Season 6 of “MLP: FIM” this spring?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: No, Ted!! Season 6 hasn’t even aired yet. Besides, I’m hyped up for it too, ya know? Especially with that CUTE, WITTLE, FLURRY HEART/SHINING ARMOR AND PRINCESS CADENCE’S (MI AMORE CADENZA’S) BABY ALICORN THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS AND DUMBO!!!!!!!! :’D :\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Oh. Right. Sorry, continue.\n\nThank you. As I was saying, I’m going to review the one thing all you “Thomas” fans like me have been waiting for: Season 19 of “Thomas & Friends”!!! YES, I’M REVIEWING THE NINETEENTH SEASON OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD ICONS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFAMOUS “ENGINE ROLL CALL”!!!! Just like Season 17 & 18, Season 19 starts off as a Walmart exclusive on DVD with “Whale of a Tale”, containing six episodes from this season on June 9, 2015. It then aired in the UK on Milkshake on September 21st of the same year, before reaching the US nearly a month later on October 13th on PBS Kids. Speaking of “Engine Roll Call”, this season contains a new “Engine Roll Call” and intro with a different tune, footage, and inclusion of everyone’s favorite Great Western Pannier, Montague AKA Duck!!!!!:\n\nBut, hey, at least it’s better than the usual crappy “Engine Roll Call”. But, I THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL OPENING FROM SEASONS 1-7 WOULD’VE BEEN, MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!!!!! AGAIN, HERE’S THE TRUE AND ORIGINAL OPENING RIGHT NOW!!!!:\n\nAs you can tell, I LOVE the original “T&F” opening from Season 1-7/Classic Series, while I HATE, HATE the “Engine Roll Call”. But, I digress, just like The Unlucky Tug/TheUnluckyTug02’s review of Seasons 14 & 15 and SteamTeam3211’s review of Season 15, I’ll be listing the episodes from which they aired on TV or DVD and give them my personal opinions about it and my final score, before giving the season my official scoring results of what I think of it. With that said, let’s take a look!!!\n\n#1.) “Who’s Geoffrey?”: In this season opener, Thomas causes an accident and Brendam Docks and tries to get himself out of trouble, by lying that a made-up engine named “Geoffrey” from the Mainland caused the accident. But, the lie gets out of control and now, everyone on Sodor believes that Geoffrey is real, when in reality, he isn’t!! As much as people love this episode itself, I think it’s a great start to this season because it was funny, well-written, and clever!!! I can agree with NewController01 that it would’ve been more funnier, if Geoffrey was an real engine and I think I read one comment about this episode that he or she depicted Geoffrey as Arthur (one of the many Classic Series characters who hasn’t returned in AGES) and I agree, even if Sodor Island 3D/Trainz Simulator depicted Geoffrey a different engine. Yeah, I know, a lot of you laughed at not two of my favorite parts of the episode, one of the best moments in “T&F” history: “The Accident at Brendam Docks” & “Thomas Pretending to Be Geoffrey”.:\n\nAside from that, since Martin T. Sherman (the former voice of Thomas and Percy in the US dub) left the show and Keith Wickham (Percy, James, STH/The Fat Controller, and other characters’ voices) dropped his role as Percy, we get to hear Percy’s new US and UK voice for the first time, which are Christopher Ragland in the US and Nigel Pilkington and I can honestly say, Chris does a pretty good job voicing Percy. But, Nigel does an okay job voicing him and it’s actually pretty good too. Here’s a comparison between those two and you’ll get what I mean!:\n\nAll in all, I love this episode!! It’s not only one of the best episodes in this season so far, this is one of the best “Thomas” episodes I’ve ever seen!! It was funny, well-written, and the animation’s improving too!!! I’d give it a 9.5/10!!!\n\n#2.) “The Truth About Toby”: In this episode, Toby runs out of coal when delivering some empty cars/trucks to Cronk Scrapyards and is left stranded there. However, as Thomas, Edward, and other engines pass by, they accidentally start a rumor that Toby is going to be scrapped. For me, this episode was okay and it wasn’t really my taste. I know that there was a mixed reception for this episode, but, I’m on both sides because if Toby was really going to be sent for scrap, Sir Topham Hatt/President McFatFace would tell the other engines about it immediately and he would never scrap any of his engines that are “RESPONSIBLE, RELIABLE, AND ‘REALLY USEFUL'”!!!!!!! “USEFUL!!!!!” From the title of this episode, I would’ve expected Toby NOT being the REAL Toby back at his old tramway at East Anglia, before it was shut down and the harbor he used to work at with his classmates and the other engines know about the lesson of not spreading rumors by now, ESPECIALLY IN THE SEASON 5 EPISODE: “THOMAS AND THE RUMO(U)RS”!!!!\n\nAside from my rants about this episode, everything else was solid, especially Toby’s new UK voice. He’s now voiced by James and Stanley’s new US voice, “Rob Rackstraw”/Travis’ UK voice from “Bob the Builder”, while his original UK voice (Ben Small/Thomas and Rheneas’ old UK voicer). I think it sounds MUCH better than his old UK voice, but, his US voice (William Hope) could’ve been better and I think it’s high time we get a new US voice for Toby. Even if sounded more country/American, Toby’s UK voice is just perfect and here are clips from the episode to see what I’m saying, here!:\n\nThe other few good things about this episode is Stanley getting a speaking role again (except for a few seconds), Toby (FINALLY) going back to his old, caring, and wise personality, Toby and Henrietta’s interaction similar to “Tobias and the Half-Pariah”, and a few funny moments from this episode. Overall, this episode was average and it needed both some major and minor adjustments. I’d rate it a 5/10. Moving on to the next episode!\n\n#3.) “Lost Property”: This time, some Railway Inspectors come to the Island of Sodor and Thomas has to take them and Fatto on Annie and Clarabel. But, they come across some dilemmas during the inspection of the North Western Railway, such as some bratty children, cows on the line, and a kid pulling the emergency cable on Annie (just like in Season 18). The first time I watched this episode, I thought it was okay, but now, I think it’s pretty good. I especially love the scenes with Fatty, when he plays with a ball on a string twice and every time he does it, he ends up getting two black eyes!!!! The first time I saw that scene, I laughed at that! But, the scene where Thomas picks up the bratty kids at Dryaw Station on his branchline would’ve been more funnier, if Fatto started beating the living crap outta them, like this!:\n\nNah, too violent. Anyways, I liked this episode because the shots were amazing, Arc’s animation has done it again, and the humor was funny as always! For a pretty good episode, I’ll give it a 7.5/10.\n\n#4.) “Henry Spots Trouble”: And, of course, the bad episodes come in when we have Henry’s wussy-personality return! This time, when Henry sees Fatto’s grandchildren get chicken pox, Henry fears about getting it as well. Alright, I can seriously go on about how awful this episode was because I hate the fact that they still made Henry a coward, since Seasons 8-16, and– REALLY???!!!! HENRY’S AFRAID OF GETTING A HUMAN ILLNESS THAT CAN’T SPREAD TO ANY ENGINE OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORT??????!!!!!!! Andrew Brenner, if you’re reading this, for the last time, HENRY IS NOT A COWARD!!! HE IS A KIND AND MATURE ENGINE THAT SOMETIMES ACTS LIKE GORDON AND JAMES AND THE REASON WHY HE HID INSIDE HIS TUNNEL IN “THE SAD STORY OF HENRY”/”COME OUT, HENRY” WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN’T WANT TO GET HIS GREEN PAINT WITH RED-STRIPES SPOILED BY THE RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST WISH THAT HENRY WAS NO LONGER A GIANT WUSS THAT IS LIKE FLUTTERSHY FROM “MLP: FIM”, EXCEPT THAT FLUTTERSHY’S A GREAT CHARACTER IN MY OPINION, EVEN IF SHE IS A COWARD AS WELL FOR A SHY SPIRIT OF KINDNESS OUT OF THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY AND THE MANE SIX!!!!!\n\n…..*Deep Sigh* Sorry, it’s just that, I despise the fact that even if Andrew Brenner watched the classic TV series and read the “RWS”, he (the head writer himself) still made all the other writers do Sharon Miller’s way of writing the show, by still making Henry a giant worrier that worries about, every single thing he comes across. Although, there a few things I like about this episode, including the scene where Fatto accidentally rips his trousers and reveals the back of his underwear. It’s like that scene from one of the classic “Spongebob” episode, “Ripped Pants”, when Spongebob accidentally rips his pants and everyone at Goo Lagoon and his friends laugh at him, which, of course, is repeated many times, until the joke gets old. Well, yeah, I laughed at that too. All in all, I give this episode a 3.5/10, I really didn’t like it very much and it’s definitely one of this season’s worst!!\n\n#5.) “A Cranky Christmas”: Now, it’s time for the show’s annual Christmas/Holiday-themed episodes, when Cranky the Crane accidentally drops a Christmas crate for Thomas to take to Town Hall, before Thomas does the same process on what Cranky did when he slips on the icy rails at the Town Hall. Now, for this season’s first Holiday-themed episode (unlike the dreaded “WINTER HOLIDAYS” for the sake of “Political Correctness”), I didn’t like this one too much. It just didn’t feel well-written for me, either, again, even there were a few I actually liked, I don’t have a lot to say about this episode. If Cranky was worried about breaking the cargo he accidentally dropped a crate at Brendam Docks, I bet the Dock Manager would let him know about it, ahead of time!! For a below average episode, I would give it a 3/10, it wasn’t that good.\n\n#6.) “Snow Place Like Home”: In this pun-worthy title of something Carl Azuz from CNN Student News would come up with, we learn that Victor doesn’t like snow, but Kevin at the Sodor Steamworks foolishly decides to go and play in the snow. As you’d expect, things go awry, when Kevin gets caught in a pile of snow, beside the Steamworks, forcing Victor to go and look for him the snowstorm. Since this is the 3rd episode that focuses on Kevin (or as missoliverandblossom/DaWillstanator/William Grubb would say: “Sodor’s Own Jerry Lewis”) and the 2nd episode to have Victor the main character, it did have some faults, such as Kevin acting like a doofus as usual. But, it’s actually not bad. As usual, the animation’s fantastic and I do like how Victor got more character development. But, other than that, I again don’t have anything else to say about this episode, it’s a 5.5/10 for this one.\n\n#7.) “The Beast of Sodor”: As you can tell, we get ANOTHER Henry-focused episode and it’s about Henry worried about “The Abominable Snowman”/”The Yeti”, while Spencer/The Duke and Duchess of Boxford’s private engine (who is stuck on Sodor because of the Vicarstown Drawbridge closing down due to snow) teases him about it. The first time I read about this episode, I honestly thought that it was gonna suck, like other newer Henry-episodes (not the older ones from Season 1-7). But, when I first watched it, I actually enjoyed it. The plot was good, the humor was amusing, especially the part where Fatto gets chased by a bull in a field (possibly Champion from Season 4 episode: “Bulls Eyes”) and how the dramatic cue from “Spongebob” is played four times in this episode, like this scene, for example!:\n\nGotta love “Spongebob” and their music/dramatic cues from “Ren and Stimpy”!!! Overall, despite Henry’s cowardness returning once again, I actually liked it and the humor was great as always. I’d give it a 7.5/10!!\n\n#8?????) “Toad and the Whale”: As you can probably tell by the title, this episode is about Oliver the Great Western Engine’s brakevan, Toad. This time, Toad spots a whale stranded on the beach at Bluff’s Cove. He, Oliver, and the Sodor Search and Rescue Center work together to get the whale back into the ocean. Now, Toad has been getting a lot of screentime lately, ever since he and Oliver (officially) returned in Season 18 (not counting “Tale of the Brave”) and despite this is Toad’s 3rd episode focused on him, it was pretty good. Although, Oliver did act like an ignorant jerk towards Toad when Toad spotted the whale. Can you guess on how Oliver reacted? He thought that Toad was making a joke about it!!!!:\n\nI’m not even joking, here!!!! Oliver thought that Toad was kidding about an ACTUAL WHALE THAT IS DRYING AND DYING AT THE SAME TIME ON BLUFF’S COVE BEACH, WHILE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH DUCK!!!!!! 😡 I SHOULD BE PISSED OFF, I SHOULD BE BUCKING ANGRY THAT OLIVER IS AN IGNORANT IDIOT, INSTEAD OF BEING A HARD-WORKING ENGINE THAT HAS A HOT-TEMPER WHO ESCAPED FROM SCRAP BY DOUGLAS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, at least Toad singing “Beside the Seaside” from Season 18 was one way to pay Oliver back for telling Toad his lifestory on how they came to Sodor in the first place in their returning episode, “Toad’s Adventure” from Season 18, here!:\n\nDespite my complaints, it’s still a pretty solid episode and I sure hope that in the next season, Oliver will get his own episode again, just like he did back in Seasons 3-7!! I give this episode a 7/10.\n\n#9?????) “Wild Water Rescue”: In this episode, the Search and Rescue Center celebrates its 1,000th rescue and Percy’s been given the job to take the Mayor of Sodor to present the new SS&RC bell to celebrate this wonderful occasion. But, the Devious Diesel himself strikes again when he sets Percy on a wild goose chase to pick up the Mayor at the old quarry mine, while he picks up the Mayor instead, in order to get his picture taken in the newspaper. For me, this episode was pretty average and I felt like the title could’ve been better, I think it should be called “On the Front Page”, “Stealing the Spotlight, Like Thomas Would Do”, or “Special Attraction Part II: ‘How to Get Away with Fooling Someone With an Obvious Lie, While Getting To Do the Thing You Wanted to Do, MUWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!” Also, the plot might have nothing to do with the title of this episode. Although, I do like how Kerry Shale (the UK voice of Diesel) gets to be Diesel’s new US voice, while replacing Martin T. Sherman and I can say that Kerry Shale is MUCH better than Michael Brandon and Martin’s voice for our favorite black and sly BR Class 08 shunter!!! Also, the scene where Percy practices for his picture on the newspaper were really amusing and would definitely be perfect selfies!!!\n\nWell, here comes Sodor’s next big meme. Anyway, this episode was alright and could’ve been better, a 4.5/10.\n\n#10????) “Very Important Sheep”: This episode is about “SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Or should I say, similarity to MOAB’s “Sheep” joke in his review of “Muddy Matters”, when Percy has to take some sheep to a funfair in Maithewaite Station. But, the sheep escape and cause chaos for Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel and on the Mainline. As you can tell, this episode is the third version of the ultimate worst “Thomas” episode yet, “WONKY WHISTLE”!!!!!!!! But, this time, Percy is in a hurry, rather than being a moron, like in Seasons 8-16!! Also, what really impressed me was Trevor the Traction Engine returning in CGI, except that he made a cameo in “Emily and Dash” from Season 15 and this episode, sadly. It would’ve been very fantastic, if Trevor got a speaking role in this episode, like he did in the past. Overall, this episode was a really good one and it really felt like “Wonky Whistle”, IF it was done correctly, that is with Percy as the main focus!! As soon as I give this episode an 8/10, let me make this quote from MOAB/DaWillstanator to move onto the next episode………………“SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\n#11????) “Salty All at Sea”: Not to be confused with the Season 3 episode: “All at Sea”, when Salty has been chosen to work at the Mainland harbor, much to his horror. He lets his own imaginary fantasies get the better of him, when he races around the Island/the NWR to get away from going to the Mainland, instead of having to go to the Vicarstown Drawbridge, connecting to the Mainland. Oh my Luna, I absolutely don’t like this episode because of how Salty was portrayed in it!! I can agree with many of you that Salty being afraid of travelling on the ocean is one of the dumbest explanations I’ve ever heard in my entire life, compared to “The Middle”!! Because Salty afraid of travelling, instead of going to the Mainland through the you-know-what at you-know-where, REALLY??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is “Sharon Miller-Logic” if you ask me!!!!:\n\nEXACTLY, RARITY!!!!! Besides, wouldn’t it make more sense, if Salty went to the Mainland by the Vicarstown Drawbridge???!!!! Still, I didn’t like this episode for Salty’s 3rd episode and you know what, NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!! It’s a 2/10, it was just that awful!!!\n\n#12????) “Den and Dart”: In this one, when Mavis has an accident at Ffarqhuar Quarry, Den and Dart, the Vicarstown Dieselworks diesels, are forced to work separately. I mean by having Den take Mavis’ place, until she is repaired, while Dart helps with Mavis’ repairs. I can say that this episode is actually very good with having an interesting characterization and plot, even if we’ve seen Den and Dart separate back in Season 16 (*UGH*). It’s actually quite similar to the episode from WildNorWester’s “Sodor: The Modern Years” (spin-off of “Sodor: The Early Years”) episode, “Separation Anxiety”, which involves Ben having to work on his own, when Bill has an accident at the Containment Yard and is taken away to be repaired. Also, the music when Den shunts the trucks with confidence was very good and imagine if it was heard in the classic episodes from Seasons 1-7!!!!:\n\nIt is, without a doubt, one of the best music pieces in the CGI series and the show itself, so far!!! All in all, I really love this episode and it’s one of my favorites out of the season thus far and I would give it a 9.5/10!!\n\n#13????) “Helping Hiro”: When Thomas accidentally causes Hiro to have an accident, Thomas feels extremely guilty about it. He decides to help Hiro, by going to the same woods Hiro was found at in “Hero of the Rails” to find some of the lost engine parts that was used to restore him. The first time I saw this episode, I enjoyed it, but after seeing SamTheTrainFan’s thoughts on it on Twitter, I kind of changed my mind about it. It didn’t seem to go in any direction, really and had no moral or lesson, but I think the moral is that accidents happen and you should realize that it’s best to forgive yourself and move on with your life. But, here, it felt more or less of a sequel to “Hero of the Rails” and Thomas should know that the Sodor Steamworks has plenty of parts to repair Hiro. Other than, this episode wasn’t that good and needed some major rewriting!!! The score is a 3/10.\n\n#14 & 15?????) “Diesel’s Ghostly Christmas” (Parts 1 & 2): This episode manages to be a (yet-another) “Thomas”-version of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol”, by having Diesel play as Ebeneezer Scrooge when he refuses to be “helpful”. This causes Thomas and his friends pretend to be the “Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future”, in order to teach Diesel a lesson. Just like “Duncan the Humbug” from last season, this episode was a very fantastic adaptation of a really great Christmas classic “A Christmas Carol”!! I love the way how it’s set up, having it be a double-featured episode was a very splendid idea, it felt like an actual “MLP: FIM” episode, the animation was great as always, and I do love the part where Paxton as the Ghost of Christmas Present broke the fourth wall by saying to the audience:\n\nPAXTON: “Then I must be good at pretending.”\n\nYep, gotta love Paxton and his young, adorable, kind, goofy, and naive personality for a BR Class 08 diesel like Diesel, Arry and Bert, Sidney, and Splatter and Dodge. Although, I would admit that Diesel kinda acted gullible over the other engines pretending to be ghosts and he would’ve recognized the other engines, if he heard their voices. It might be like “Ghost Train”/”Percy’s Ghostly Trick” from Season 2 and “Thomas, Percy, and the Dragon” from Season 3 all over again, where Thomas claimed that he was pretending to be scared, when Percy pulled that prank on Thomas about him pretending to be a ghost. But, aside from that, this episode was very well-done for another “Christmas Carol” adaptation in the “Thomas” franchise and it’s like cactus190706’s “Gordon’s Christmas Carol” from 2010 and MilkTankerMedia’s 2015 Christmas special: “Making Spirits Bright: A Sodor Christmas Carol”!! I’d give this (these) episode(s) a 9/10!!\n\n#16????) “Best Engine Ever”: In this one, Emily wishes that she could be streamlined like Caitlin. Here’s the funny thing, when the Wooden Railway model of Emily’s streamlined version in her fantasy in this episode came up, it was pretty surprising to be fair. Even if I’m not a big Emily person because of how she replaced Duck, Oliver, and Donald & Douglas since Season 8 and her annoying personality, this episode is a good enough Emily episode. I really appreciate the fact that they expanded Emily and Caitlin’s personalities, instead of being (ya know) JUST ANOTHER TOY!!!!! As for the scene where Emily saves Caitlin at Ulfstead Castle was executed very well and needless to say, Emily is starting to be slightly likable, even if I’m still not an Emily fan. I would give this episode an 8/10!!\n\n#17????) “Slow Stephen”: From the episode’s title, Stephen the Rocket proves to the other engines that being slow is good sometimes, when he helps prevent Gordon from crossing the unstable Sodor Suspension Bridge. This episode is not only much better than Stephen’s last episode, “The Afternoon Tea Express” from Season 17, it’s definitely one of the best ones yet, since Stephen’s one of my favorite characters!!! Also, the Suspension Bridge collapsing was so BUCKING excellent in CGI and is way more dramatic than it was in “Calling All Engines” and “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”!!! No offense. This episode is an 8.5/10 for this one!!\n\n#18????) “Two Wheels Good”: In this episode, after hearing the Thin Controller/Mr. Percival mentioning his bike being “Two Wheels Good”, Thomas, Spencer, and Bertie argue on which set of wheels are good, while they, along with Harold take the Duke and Duchess of Boxford to Lord Callan’s Castle. As you can tell from the plot, Lord Callan returns in CGI and I gotta say, it’s a really nice comeback and nice to see Lord Callan again after a long time of absence in the series (of course). But, his voice, Keith Wickham, is at the point when I realized that all fans were right that Keith is running out of voices for the characters he plays in the CGI series because Keith’s voice for Lord Callan sounds more like Skarloey, but with a Scottish accent. I think it’s time we add more celebrities, cast members, and guest stars in the show. Other than that, it’s a 9/10 for me.\n\n#19????) “Reds VS. Blues”: Thomas and James compete against each other, when picking up football/soccer (in the US) fans and taking them to the Dryaw Football/Soccer field. But, this (of course) leads to disastrous results. For me, this episode was pretty good, even if it is predictable from beginning to end, I especially liked the part where Fatto kicked a football/soccer ball and accidentally caused it to break a window and the part when Percy breaks the fourth wall, by stealing the narrator’s line: “And then there was trouble!”:\n\nMan, Fatto’s becoming from a strict, but a open-hearted controller of the NWR to a very funny comedian/clown. I would rate this episode a 7/10!\n\n#20????) “The Little Engine Who Raced Ahead”: This episode introduces our new toy– Uh, I mean character: Philip (no, it’s not Phil Aardman from turtlesandthomas’ “Sudrian Conflict”), an energetic and child-like diesel boxcab (played by British actor, Rasmus Hardiker). His introductory episode focuses on him winning a race against Gordon, even though he had no idea that Gordon never raced him at all. This episode was a really good one and I like Philip as a character. Sure, he can get a bit annoying now and then and later, but, he’s actually a pretty cute character and it’s nice to see more diesels introduced in the show. But, ya gotta love his personality of him acting like a little kid and I can agree that many fans can relate to Philip when they were younger. But, not everyone’s a fan of Philip. Just look on how Philip tried to interact with Daisy in EE93’s “Enterprising Engines”.:\n\nAll in all, I rate this episode an 8/10 for another fun character from Andrew Brenner!!\n\n#21????) “Philip to the Rescue”: As you can tell, Philip saves James (who is trying to prove that he’s not a showoff) from a nasty accident at the bridge/tunnel at the bottom of Gordon’s Hill. For Philip’s second episode, this episode is probably better than the last one and James’ accident was brilliantly animated. Also, I love the fact that they showed James’ driver telephoning Fatto for help, like in the older episodes. Well, at least Philip is better than other annoying and idiotic characters like Samson and Billy!! This episode is an 8.5/10.\n\n#22????) “No Help at All”: At the China Clay Pits, Bill and Ben think Timothy the Oil-Burning engine is “No Help At All” and they decide to ask Fatto to send Timothy to Brendam Docks, during the events of “Salty All at Sea” and “Den and Dart”. As how much I love Bill and Ben, I actually love this episode for many good reasons!!! It’s a nice way to have an episode take place between two different episodes and it’s a very great concept. Also, we get a remastered version of the “Down By the Docks” song from Season 6 and even if it’s not as good as the original version, it’s still another great classic “T&F” song. Here’s a comparison between the original and this episode’s version of it!!:\n\nIt’s like “The Adventure Begins”, except that was a very great 70th Anniversary special from last year!!! Also, Marion’s goofy antics kick in again for this episode and I love the ending when she’s still working and (as usual), it’s very funny!!! Overall, great episode with a returning of Bill and Ben and a remastered version of another great classic “Thomas” song!! I’d rate it a 9/10!!!\n\n#23????) “The Other Side of the World”– I mean, “The Other Side of the Mountain”: After Bertie the Bus teases Thomas about the other side of a mountain on Thomas’ branchline, Thomas is determined to figure out what’s on the other side of that mountain. You know, the mountain in this episode reminded me of the Culdee Fell Mountain Railway from the “RWS”, except that the Culdee Fell engines are the engines that we DEFINITELY need to see in the CGI and the TV series, as long as HIT tells the tale of Godred’s tragic crash correctly. This episode was a pretty good one and the crash was very unrealistic and it felt like “Toby Takes the Road” from the “RWS” all over again. But, the scene when Thomas dreams about him having wings like an airplane (reference to “Thomas and Bertie”/”Thomas and Bertie’s Great Race” from Season 1) felt like “Sticky Toffee Thomas” from Season 10, but without the goggles and helmet on his face and smokebox. Well, at least it isn’t *UGH* “JAY JAY THE BUCKING JET PLANE”!!!!!!!!!!!! Other than that, this episode was a good one and I’d give it an 8.5/10.\n\n#24????) “Thomas the Babysitter”: In this episode, Thomas has to deal with an annoying baby and his mother on his two coaches, Annie and Clarabel. For me, this episode was great and adorable at the same time, it really reminded me of “MLP: FIM” episode: “Baby Cakes” from Season 2. Both of those episodes were really adorable and “Thomas the Babysitter” felt like an actual “RWS” story that the Rev. W. Awdry or Christopher Awdry would’ve come up with, years ago. Especially the scene when the workmen (Alfred) and his wife decide to name the baby “Thomas”, just like how the Baby Cakes’ first words were this!:\n\nNow, anyone got a tissue. <:’) Anyways, it’s a 9.5/10 for such an ADORABLE, LITTLE EPISODE!!! <:’D\n\n#25????) “Rocky Rescue”: In case you haven’t read the title, this episode is about Rocky, but NOT as the main character. It’s just the ENTIRE Search and Rescue Team because after Rocky lifts Henry back onto the rails at Ulfstead Castle, he ends up having his own accident when he derails on the Mainline. Instead of (ya know) having the OTHER Breakdown Train/Crane (including Jerome and Judy from “The Adventure Begins) from Seasons 1-9, the entire S&RC has to come and rescue him, but they learn that it’s best to work together–:\n\nOkay, for me, this episode wasn’t that great and it felt like it would’ve been better, if it was written differently, like have Rocky’s accident be taken alternately. It would’ve been way better in my opinion. Still, I have nothing else to say for this episode and I’d rate it a 6.5/10, it could’ve been better.\n\n#26????): “Goodbye Fat Contoller” (“Goodbye Sir Topham Hatt”): In the (possible) season finale, Percy sees/overhears a bunch of workmen near Fatto’s office at Knapford Station. He worries that Fatto’s really going away forever and the other engines try to work hard in order to keep him from leaving permanently. But, as you’d expect, it’s all a major misunderstanding!!!! For an episode that had Percy act like a naive idiot again, it’s actually a very great one because it (once again) felt like a “RWS” story, the animation improves again, and the humor was great, too. Also, we get a really great musical recreation of the original theme for Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller in his Season 1-2 and Season 5 theme!! But, during the montage when the other engines try to work hard and the Season 14 “Sir Topham Hatt” jazz song was playing, I would’ve preferred a recreation of the “Sir Topham Hatt” song from Season 5, like this!:\n\nOh well, the jazz version was more fitting anyway. Also, the scene when Fatto’s temporary office is at the shed really made me laugh and after seeing Ken Friedel’s video with the scene, while MOAB’s “T&F” Christmas Short #3 was playing, I can agree with him that those two scenes are very similar to one another.:\n\nFor the season finale, I’d rate this episode a 9.5/10! NOW, ONTO MY FINAL THOUGHTS FOR THIS SEASON!!!\n\nOverall, is this season better than Season 18? Well, the answer is “YES”!! There were a lot of good episodes, nice references, funny jokes, and great recreations of original songs from the show!! Also, the animation from Arc Productions has improved BIG TIME!!!!! However, there are a few episodes that were unlikable or mediocre, including one of Henry’s episodes, “Salty All at Sea”, etc.. But, that doesn’t stop me from loving this season!!! It’s definitely an improvement over the last season!! Heck, the show itself is improving from the crappy writing we’ve gotten from Seasons 8-16, but I would’ve preferred more returning characters, but I’m happy over what we’ve gotten this time!!! This gives me my final score for Season 19 of “Thomas & Friends” a 9.5/10 for not only one of the best seasons in the CGI era, one of the best “T&F” seasons yet!!!!\n\nNow that that’s settled, we’ll look forward to Season 20 this year and the next special this year, “The Great Race”!!! Let me know in the comments below on what your thoughts are on this season. As always, I’m The Detective Librarian and I’ll see you in my 110th Review Special next time for Rainbow Dash’s “Birthaversary”!!!! Toodles!!!! 😉\n\n-THE END-\n\n*******READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**********\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! TURN BACK IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN– FORGET IT!!! HERE ARE THE VIDEOS OF THE “THOMAS CREATOR COLLECTIVE’S” FIRST INSTALLMENT THAT CAME OUT ON YOUTUBE MANY MONTHS AGO, LAST YEAR ON THE “T&F” YOUTUBE CHANNEL, AS WELL AS THE FULL VERSION OF IT WITH BONUS SCENES IN THE END!!!!!!!!!!!:\n\nAnyways, please proceed!!!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled Review, Already in Progress-\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON “THE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN”:\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Hey!! Earth to Detective!!! Uh–I mean, Equestria to Detective!!!!\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:………..Why?…………Why should I forgive…HIM?!!….After all the things he did to Twilight…………… <:(\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: What? You mean, Shining Armor?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:….Ye–Yes. Ted………..I’ve been having these….VISIONS that Shining Armor will come and betray me. Was he really planning to stab us in the backs, or stab her and ME in the backs?\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Come on, Detective. You shouldn’t take it personally, it was just because of Chrysalis’ disguise as Cadence brainwashing him during the events of “A Canterlot Wedding”.\n\nDR. VICK NEWTON: Listen! Detective, I know that you still hold a grudge against him, but think about it. When have you ever given him a chance to forgive him?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: I sort of forgave him in my review of “Equestria Girls”, but that still won’t make things easier between the both of us!\n\nDR. VICK NEWTON: But, what if he really meant his apology? What if he really means well and committed the one sin in a state of anger and disappointment after being brainwashed by the impostor? I think the only cause of the rivalry between you and Shining was because of your anger on his mistake. Don’t ever forget that. Forgiveness is something that is needed at all times, even if you don’t want to, it’s best to forgive others, rather than think about yourself.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Yes.. I do. I’m SO, SO sorry I held a grudge against you!! I want to be officially friends, instead of enemies or rivals anymore!!!! You really are one of the best friends I could ever have and I really mean that!!!! <:’) Again, I’m really sorry we kept fighting. If you’re really sorry, than I should forgive you and if I really mean that I’m “Sorry”, you should forgive me too.\n\nSHINING ARMOR: Thank you, Detective and I forgive you. I’m sorry, too, I should’ve have been so harsh on Twily in the first place. Seeing how my actions affected you and her, that was one of the worst events I’ve ever experienced in my entire life.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Thank you and I forgive you as well…..BFF or should I say B.B.B.F.F…..\n\nBOTH DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN AND SHINING ARMOR:\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Now, let’s go home….ALL OF US!! It’s New Year’s Eve and it’s time to celebrate the end of 2015 and the beginning of a new year known as 2016. *Everyone Else Leaves*\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON:….. <:’)\n\nDR. VICK NEWTON: *Enters A Mysterious Room* *Activates a Computer*\n\nTHE REVIEW MASTER (COMPUTER/HOLOGRAM): Hello, Newton. Happy New Years of 2016!!!\n\nDR. VICK NEWTON: Same to you…Sir!! All will commence as you planned this year in 2016………\n\nLINK TO PREVIOUS REVIEW:\n\nSeason 4: Review #4: “MLP: FIM”: “A Canterlot Wedding: Aftermath” ****FINAL REVIEW FOR 2015/NEW YEAR’S SPECIAL****\n\n-Now, Onto the Actual Review-\n\nHello, I’m The Detective Librarian and some of you may have remembered my review of “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”/the 2nd installment of the “Thomas” Youtube channel series called the “Thomas Creator Collective”!! Well, I should’ve reviewed today’s installment first because this is the one installment that started the whole “Thomas Creator Collective”. In case you don’t know, the “TCC” is a series when the “T&F” Youtube Channel asked popular “Thomas”-fans with their own fan-series/films/projects like Enterprisingengine93 (creator of “Enterprising Engines”), Tines Sensahthe (well-known for making “Tobias and the Half-Pariah”), DieselD199 (made “TOMICA Thomas & Friends”), BrendenReis10 (made “T&F” remakes with Hornby and Bachmann models and is making “Thomas the Movie”), etc…. As you can tell, ALL of the popular “T&F” fans have been asked to make their own fan-series/story for the “T&F” Youtube channel to make two installments, the one I reviewed for X-mas and the first installment/today’s story, “Secrets of the Stolen Crown”!! It was first uploaded on November 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th, 2015, which would make it two-and-a-half months old. Now, keep in mind, this is supposed to be a sort-of-sequel to the latest “T&F” special, “Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure”, which take place after the events of the special. Is it as good as the special and is it a good kind-of-sequel? Well then, let’s dive in!!\n\nSo, the story starts off on the Mainline where everybody’s favorite blue E2 tank engine/screen-stealing puffball, Thomas (voiced by DieselD199), and his BFF, Percy the Small Engine (played by Enterprisingengine93), racing across the countryside to get to the Sodor Maritime Museum for a new exhibition and announcement, while the titles roll. As they get to the Maritime Museum, all the other engines (including Marion, Skiff the Railboat from “SLOTLT”, who is also played by EE93, and none other than Diesel 10, played by, also, DieselD199) are there, as well. Percy, however, is suspicious over Skiff, seeing as how he was forced by his former owner, Sailor John, who was also from “SLOTLT” to steal Captain Calles’ lost pirate treasure, until he helped stop him at Arlesburgh Harbor during the chase scene at the end of the special/film. Even if Thomas and Skiff are still friends, Percy still doesn’t trust him, but he and Thomas are also suspicious of Diesel 10 attending the ceremony at the Museum. However, it’s brushed aside when the Museum Curator continues his announcement when it’s revealed that during the events of the special, when Marion, the goofy steamshovel herself (played by Allison Philips/ToyTrains4U) discovered the Lost Treasure and dropped it on Thomas by accident, she noticed a writing on the bottom of the Treasure Chest. The writing, however, is actually a riddle that Captain Calles wrote that could lead to more lost treasure he stole, including a crown belonging to the King of England that was rumored to have been stolen by Calles, but it actually happened. He put the stolen valuables separately, just in case the Treasure Chest was found once more, like a sneaky pirate/dude who is a villain and knows how to cover his/her tracks, instead of being a doofus and letting our heroes/his or her enemy stop them without doing anything at all!!!!:\n\nThank you, Pinkie Pie!!! Anyways, you’re wondering about Captain Calles’ riddle. Well, here’s how it goes!:\n\n“Who is the one who is hiding my treasure? That isn’t a question, it is the answer!! But, know that who is not who they seem! Their true source is hidden, if you know what I mean. Follow their waters to where they do fall and peer behind their watery wall. Then, shift the rocks to find your prize for behind one my lost treasure lies.”\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Hmph! Sounds more like a poem/rhyme to me! Unless, if Sharon Miller wrote this again because repetitive and ungodly annoying rhyming is her specialty!!!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Um, Detective? Aren’t most poems rhymes, like the Riddler from “Batman”?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Well, yeah, that’s true! But, rhyming is SO EAR-RIPPING THAT IT MAKES YOU WANNA WATCH “THE MIDDLE”, THE REMAKE OF “HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS” MOVIE BY DR. SEUSS, AND THE INFAMOUS, “CAT IN THE HAT”, MOVIE WITH MIKE MYERS ADAPTATION THAT IS CONSIDERED “AWFUL”!!!! EVEN THE NOSTALGIA CRITIC DESPISES THIS FILM AND CONSIDERS IT ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES HE’S EVER REVIEWED AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY!!!!!!……*Sigh*, sorry. It’s just that, RHYMING BEING ADDED IN NEWER EPISODES FROM SOMETHING NOSTALGIC IN MY CHILDHOOD IS REALLY OUT-OF-PLACE, EVEN THE REV. W. AWDRY WOULD BE ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE AGAIN AND IT MAKES IT FELL LIKE A DR. SEUSS BOOK!!!–\n\nREV. W. AWDRY: “Rule 55!” YOU CAN’T DO IT!!!\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: As SkarloeyRailway01/The Engine Inspector would say, I’m sorry, but I had to!! It’s just for the sake of doing another joke that’s inspired by people I follow, used to, or look up to/watch!!\n\nBut, I digress, after the Curator tells everyone about the riddle, Diesel 10 sneaks out, while the Curator is still talking about how all the engines need to find the Treasure, blah, blah, blah! Thomas and Percy decide to follow him, which leads them straight to the Sodor/Vicarstown Dieselworks, where Diesel 10 is telling the other diesels about the whole thing, including Dart, Diesel (played by Tines Sensahthe), Arry, and Bert. It’s revealed that the diesels want to find the lost treasure/Lost Crown, in order to (you guessed it) prove that diesels are better than–:\n\n–Steam engines!!!! Also, they want to get more diesel fuel that Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller/Fatty refuses to buy for the other diesels! Wow, didn’t see that coming. 😐 Even I thought that his actions in “SLOTLT”and *Shivers* “Shed 17” were more harsh than this, as well as the infamous scene with Shining Armor and Twilight Sparkle (“Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle”) in “A Canterlot Wedding” from “MLP: FIM”. But, THIS JUST TAKES THE MOTHERBUCKING CAKE!!! But, (Again), I digress, as Thomas and Percy try to get a head start for finding the Lost Crown before the diesels, Percy accidentally goes forwards, instead of backwards and bumps into some oil tankers/trucks. After this, Diesel 10 orders Arry and Bert to come and inspect the noise Percy accidentally made.\n\nBefore our heroes about to get caught, Thomas goes with the one and only perfect distraction a steam engine/locomotive can do in the “RWS”/TV series: “Blow Off Steam At Arry and Bert, Leaving Them Distracted, While Thomas and Percy Escape To Find the Crown Before the Diesels Do”!!! Well, at least that didn’t happen to James when he accidentally let off steam at Fatty’s new top hat in “James and the Bootlace”/”James Learns a Lesson” from Season 1 and in the “RWS”. Otherwise, the whole “Bootlace” incident would happen again. Anyway, as our heroes puff through the Countryside to find the Crown, they repeat the Riddle from earlier, which makes Percy realize that it could mean a waterfall, like the waterfall on Toby’s Branchline/a reference to HIT’s writing and Season 3. Along the way to the waterfall on the bridge in Toby’s Branchline, they encounter Skiff again, who claims to have solved the Riddle. Skiff tells our heroes that he believes that the Crown is at the River Who, a river that he and Sailor John once sailed before the events of “SLOTLT”. But, Percy, however, is not convinced and is still going with his theory that the Crown is at the waterfall on Toby’s Branchline.\n\nDuring their journey, they encounter cameos of (wouldn’t you know it) Splatter and Dodge/Splodge from “Thomas and the Magic Railroad”. They might even be after the treasure and I just realized something, the events of “TATMR” are canon to the show!!! It looks like Youtuber named Thomas1Edward2Henry3’s theory about the events of “TATMR” taking place in an alternate universe, seeing as how they weren’t mentioned in episodes and movies/specials after it came out, were incorrect. No offense, though. But, (ONCE AGAIN), I digress, as Thomas, Percy, and Skiff arrive at the waterfall on you-know-who’s Branchline, their drivers check the waterfall for the crown, but to no avail. That means that they have to go inside the source of the River Who at Morgan’s Mine from “The Great Discovery”, when Thomas followed a runaway truck/freight car inside the Mine, unrealistically floated across the river, leaped over the waterfall, and landed in a field beside the line. As they go inside Morgan’s Mine, the trio go to the right side of the points leading to the Crown, while doing a musical interlude with the “Monsters Everywhere”/another Disney-esque song from “Tale of the Brave”. I have to admit, it was really funny because it’s very true about most kids’ movies unexpectedly going to a song like it’s some sort of musical, a Disney film, or something.\n\nSo, Thomas, Percy, and Skiff go in-front of the waterfall, where the Crown/Treasure is waiting as quickly as they could. But, as they continue remembering the Riddle, they spot Diesel 10 still struggling to find the Lost Treasure. He furiously uses his claw/Pinchy to smash through the rocks, which causes the rocks to open like a door, revealing the Lost Crown. Diesel 10 grabs the Crown and the chase is on between Diesel 10, Thomas, and his friends for getting the Lost Crown to the Museum, until he uses his horn loudly to start an avalanche/a rock slide to block our heroes and derail Percy. Percy apologizes to Skiff for doubting him, just because of the events of “SLOTLT” and he thought that Skiff was truly a thief. Of course, it’s now up to Thomas/the title character to save the day, by stopping Diesel 10 from getting away with the Crown, while leaving Percy stranded with Skiff to pursue after the villains.\n\nHe catches up with Diesel 10, Arry, and Bert and we get one final chase scene, while recreation music of the “SLOTLT” chase scene is playing in the background. As Thomas pushes Diesel 10 so much, he causes Pinchy to release the Crown and land it on his bufferbeam, while using scrap, Arry, and Bert to stop him. But, of course, they fail, when Bert derails, Pinchy gets damaged on top of Diesel 10’s roof, and Arry is stopped by Gordon the Big Engine (played by also, DieselD199) with the Express on the Mainline. As Thomas realizes that Fatso is conveniently heading towards the Mainland, he orders the signalman from the nearest/convenient signalbox nearby to alert the other signalboxes, the Museum Curator, and Ryan at Knapford Station to alert the bridge-keeper raise the Vicarstown Drawbridge and stop Diesel 10 from escaping. This (of course) works, resulting in Diesel 10 to land in a barge full of sludge, just like in “TATMR”!!! See, I told that this was both a sequel to “SLOTLT” and “TATMR”, except that “TATMR” is bad, but can be a guilty pleasure once an a while for a “Thomas” film. Besides, that chase sequence was pretty awesome, but even these chase scenes could be as awesome as this!!:\n\nBut, enough rambling right now, let’s just cut to the ending! Thomas, Skiff, Percy, and Ryan are congratulated for not only finding the Lost Crown, stopping Diesel 10 from escaping with the Treasure. Although, Thomas and Percy still have unfinished work/jobs to do that they and the audience actually forgot about the ENTIRE TIME!!!! As for Diesel 10, well, he’s still in the barge full of sludge, like in “TATMR” and makes a reference to his final quote about “cruises”. And that’s pretty much the end, except if you’re watching the full version because the full version includes bonus scenes, including the diesels trying to find the Lost Crown, but end up with unexpected results, especially being in foreign places, randomly, and Percy pushing Skiff, like Thomas pushing Skiff and Sailor John in– Forget it, let’s just end it here.\n\nAnd that was “Secrets of the Stolen Crown”. Does it stand out to be a great start to the “Thomas Creator Collective”, while “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor” being slightly superior to it? Well, I would say “Yes” on that. Even if the story is pretty predictable, I still really enjoyed it. I appreciate the way that the show is listening to us fans of the show we’ve known and loved from out childhood, while showing our own creations on Youtube as a fan-series or fan-film with some really talented and amazing fans! They include EE93, Tines Sensahthe, turtlesandthomas (the creator of “Sudrian Conflict”, which I just checked out), Calebtrain, DieselD199, etc… But, even though missoliverandblossom/DaWillstanator is moving on from his “T&F” channel and is a brony, like me, what if he was involved in the production? If he still had his “Thomas” channel, instead of his Brony channel, he would definitely continue making “Thomas”-related content and use his Hornby and Bachmann models, even if he is still using Microsoft Paint or not for the faces and their actions. Well, maybe not, seeing as how his content is NOT for kids, along with, trainboy7 and trainlover476/Joey Turner/DaJoestanator.\n\nBut, overall, I really enjoyed “Secrets of the Stolen Crown”, even if it was a predicable sequel to “SLOTLT” and “TATMR” with some funny moments, nice references, directing, acting, and good action, written by some very amazing “Thomas” fans that have some very great stuff to look at. I highly suggest you go check out EE93, DieselD199, turtlesandthomas, and Tines’ videos. But, remember, some of their videos may be inappropriate for younger audiences, such as language, action, intensity, and scary scenes! So, please view at your own discretion!!:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DieselD199\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcZ2C-b0jVtqw8nPn2WMjA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Enterprisingengine93\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Trensahnethetram\n\nIf you enjoy those channels, I highly suggest that you like, comment, and subscribe to them because they’re really talented fans who deserve great praise!! Now, let’s rate my final score for “Secrets of the Stolen Crown” a 7.5/10. But, I think that other “Thomas” fans like TheScotsmanReturns (the creator of his “Everything Wrong with ‘Thomas’ Special”/Parodies of CinemaSins’ “Everything Wrong with” Videos and his upcoming fan-film, “Rails to Salvation”) should be a part of the “Thomas Creator Collective”! But, I wonder when he’ll be asked to do that?……..But, I can speculate. I’m The Detective Librarian and I’ll see you next time for more reviews and posts!!! Ta, ta for now, folks!!!! 😉\n\n-THE END-\n\n-Before I start this review, I do apologize I’m going out of order for reviewing the current “Thomas Creative Collector” series. But, it would only make sense to see the first one, “Secrets of the Stolen Crown”, first, before watching/seeing the actual version and the review of today’s series. I will be reviewing it sometime soon, probably next year after Christmas or the New Year’s Eve celebrations.-\n\nHere they are now!:\n\n***READ IT!!!!!****\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!! TURN BACK IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THESE VIDEOS OF THIS SERIES FOR THE OFFICIAL “T&F” YOUTUBE ACCOUNT!!!!:\n\nAnyways, proceed!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled Review, Already in Progress-\n\nHello, I’m The Detective Librarian and we’ve only got a few days left until “The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” officially comes!! That’s right, “Christmas”/The Holidays/Decemberween!!!! So, are you ready for one more X-mas special review as a gift, before we move onto my upcoming Christmas special????!!!!\n\nAUDIENCE: YES!!!!!\n\nOkay, then, before we dive into today’s special, I’ll remind you about something called the “Thomas Creator Collective”. It’s a series that involves various fans of “Thomas & Friends”/”Thomas the Tank Engine” that have their own fan-series/make their own “Thomas” videos on Youtube be involved in making their own miniseries that takes place after the events of the latest special for this year, “Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure”, that features characters, such as Ryan and Skiff (played by Academy Award winner, Eddie Redmayne, and Jamie Campbell Bower), play an important role in the story. Except that the current US/UK voice cast for the CGI series are not involved in it. This time, it’s the fans themselves, including Enterprisingengine93 (creator of “Enterprising Engines”), DieselD199 (creator of “TOMICA Thomas & Friends”), Tines Sensahthe (composer and creator of fan-films like “Tobias and the Half-Pariah”), Calebtrain, etc…. That’s right, HIT Entertainment has asked the “T&F” Youtube account to ask various well-known fans of the show that have made their own fan-work have joined forces to create their own miniseries for younger audiences. The first one was “Secrets of the Stolen Crown” (which I’ll get around to later) and the latest version of this Christmas, “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”.\n\nThe first installment came out earlier this month, December 4, 2015, while the next three chapters were uploaded the next few weeks, December 11 & 18. Now, keep in mind, this takes place after the events of the previous series of the “Thomas Creator Collective” because this series will include some references to it. So, let’s see how the fans will do a good job, two times in a row, for making something for the official “T&F” Youtube channel, instead of doing it for other fans, kids to an adult audience. Well, let’s dive right into “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”!!!\n\nSo, the series starts off on the Island of Sodor in EE93’s filming style (as usual), where Arry and Bert, the two BR Class 08 Shunter diesels from the Smelter’s Yard, deliver some coal trucks/cars up Gordon’s Hill in the snowy environment, a few days before Christmas. But, as soon as they reach the top of Gordon’s Hill, the Troublesome Trucks (of course) have their chance to be up to their old mischievous ways by snapping the coupling connected to Bert and the trucks as the back engine and pushing Arry down the Hill. This causes the two diesel twins to derail and into the snow, before cutting off to DieselD199’s layout, where we see Knapford Station. There, everybody’s favorite vain, red #5 of the North Western Railway, James, (played by UpsideNow/Nathan Tiemeyer) meets up with (of course), the #1 blue title character himself, Thomas the Tank Engine, (played by DieselD199) and Ryan (voiced by Calebtrain/Caleb Richardson). Ryan, however, doesn’t like snow (just like Henry, when he had his accident with the Flying Kipper in Season 1), meaning that Ryan must have a reason for disliking snow, of course.:\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: YES!\n\nSo, the fat man controller of the NWR himself, Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller, arrives and tells Thomas and Ryan to deliver the rest of the coal train Arry and Bert were delivering, before they had their accident at the bottom of Gordon’s Hill, earlier, to each station across the Island and on the Mainline, before an upcoming snowstorm hits later tonight, as well as deliver mail vans/trucks filled with Christmas mail and parcels from the Mainland and back to the Island. You know, Fatto, this is something Percy would do, since carrying the Mail is his favorite job on Sodor, even after the Mail Train’s first appearance in the Season 3 episode, “Thomas, Percy, and the Mail Train”/”Thomas, Percy, and the Post Train”, and it’s been that way since HIT took over and ruined (almost) everything, until Andrew Brenner came and corrected (nearly) the entire franchise from that point on!! Even though we have to have the #1 Blue Puffball involved, I think Percy should play an important role in it. But, I digress, as Thomas and a concerned Ryan huff away to fetch the coal trucks and make their deliveries, they come across a patch of snow on the line. Luckily, Thomas manages to go as fast as he could to push the snow aside, while Ryan nervously pushes the snow with his snowplow. Meanwhile, we see James get coupled on with a mail truck by Stafford (played by BrendenReis10) (please remember that James is also involved in delivering parcels for the Holidays as well), while he gets surprised to see Thomas and Ryan arrive and get coupled on to their mail trucks, as well. As they go on their journey to complete the Christmas mail, the stationmaster gets a phone call, telling him that the snowstorm is going to get worse than ever before.\n\nHe tries to stop and warn Thomas, Ryan, and James about the blizzard worsening, but it’s already too late because they already left for their journey ahead. As our heroes battle their way through the storm, an avalanche comes out of nowhere and nearly bury them alive. Also, I would like to point out that Thomas, James, and Ryan don’t have any brake vans behind them. I’m serious, just look at their trains behind them. No offence, EE93, but a brake van is supposed to keep an engine safe on the Mainline when going down hills or through runaways as extra brakes in case of an emergency. But (again), I digress, we then cut to Tidmouth Sheds (which I also forgot to point out earlier) for the second time, where Henry and Edward (played by Tardisrescue) are talking about the three engines’ absence in the blizzard, as well as make a reference to “Percy Takes the Plunge” from Season 2 (“Water’s Nothing to An Engine with Determination), before the power at Tidmouth Sheds go out, due to the storm.\n\nBack with our heroes, as the blizzard continues, James somehow races ahead of Thomas and Ryan and mysteriously disappears in the storm. As Ryan derails in the snow and gets put back on the rails again, he and Thomas continue their journey through (that is not Henry’s Tunnel, likely) a tunnel, maybe Henry’s Tunnel, and their search for James. But, as soon as they get inside, the front of the tunnel gets blocked by a giant pile of snow, along with the back of the tunnel behind them, trapping our heroes. Ryan get so nervous that he reveals the reason why he doesn’t like snow so much, which would be interesting, seeing as how more merchandising characters like Ryan need to get more character development, just like in EE93’s series, “Enterprising Engines”. But, this could screw up the continuity issues of a project I may do sometime soon and I was thinking of doing, “1014: The Untold Story of Ryan”. So:\n\nSorry about that, EE93, I was only doing it to HIT Entertainment (of course). It turns out that years before Ryan comes to Sodor, Ryan used to work at a coal mine on the Mainland during the winter, only temporarily. Yes, Ryan the GNR N2 tank engine temporarily worked for a mine, instead for British Railways. One night, after the workmen went home, Ryan was sleeping on a siding, until an avalanche came and completely buried him for days. But, he was found again and dug out of the snow and has been afraid of the snow, ever since, meaning that Ryan has PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) over snow. Now, it’s up to Ryan to work with Thomas in order to conquer his fear of snow (while following Gator’s advice on being brave, like Percy did) by pushing the snow bank in-front of them as hard as they can. But, the snow falls on top of them, but they luckily survived it, but can’t get through safely.\n\nJust then, the Scottish/Caledonian twins, Donald and Douglas arrive with their snowplows and (by making a reference to “Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree” from Season 2) clear away the snowdrift for Thomas and Ryan to go on unscathed. They later find James, derailed and stuck in the snow and rescue him to continue the story, before we get an alternate version of the “We Make a Team Together” song from “SLOTLT”, but with alternate lyrics.:\n\nDespite most musical numbers kinda waste time, it’s still here to entertain the audience and it’s still a really good song. As the three engines deliver the last of the Christmas mail, they go towards the Sodor Suspension Bridge, where more trouble laid ahead for them. As soon as they cross the Suspension Bridge, it starts to collapse, however, they manage to escape, just before it falls with them entirely and into the ravine below. So much for collapsing in the dreaded special known as “Calling All Engines” and in the Season 19 episode, “Slow Stephen” (except that “Slow Stephen” was awesome), but I would’ve preferred the bridge almost derailing Thomas, Ryan, and James. But, (ONCE AGAIN), I digress, Thomas and his two friends deliver the final package for Christmas just as the sun rises, before heading back to Knapford Station. Ryan soon realizes that he was brave today, even if it was hard for him to, before Fatty shows up and congratulates our heroes for delivering the parcels on time for Christmas. He rewards them by being a part of the Christmas party at Knapford tonight.\n\nDuring the party, all the engines hear the tale of Thomas, James, and Ryan’s adventure, while ending the series by singing “We Wish You A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year”!!! As for the compilation/full version of the series, just like the previous series, we end the series with bonus scenes of the characters and include credits. So, we’ll call the special quits!\n\nAnd that was “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”. Is it as good as the “Secrets of the Stolen Crown”. Well, I would say “Yes”, but a little bit better. The plot was pretty good, the filming was really well done, the music was put together nicely (as always), and I do like how Ryan got more characterization. Although, some parts felt kinda forced, especially the part of where the Suspension Bridge collapsed (for the third time in the franchise). But, at least it didn’t have some pointless subplots, like “The Polar Express” movie did, along with “Thomas and the Magic Railroad”. Besides, “TATMR” and “The Polar Express” movie can both be a guilty pleasure and like the “Thomas” version of “The Room”, one of those movies that are so bad, it’s good, even though “TATMR” was still pretty bad.\n\nOverall, this was a really good entry to the “Thomas Creator Collective”, where many talented “T&F” fans, like Enterprisingengine93, Tines Sensahthe, DieselD199, and even Calebtrain get together and help the show’s Youtube account create their own story. I would highly recommend you go check EE93, Tines, and DieselD199’s videos and fan-works out. But, remember, some of their videos contain images and language unsuitable for younger audiences, so please view at your own discretion!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKdOfFxC9AMdbNDWNQlxiqQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Enterprisingengine93\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DieselD199\n\nOther than that, I would recommend seeing “Secrets of the Stolen Crown” first, before seeing this really good series with some really good things about it. Hope you keep up the good work, guys! 🙂 This gives me into giving this series an 8/10. Stay tuned for my Christmas 2015 special on my blog tomorrow on Christmas Eve, and as always, I’m The Detective Librarian and have a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, and Happy Holidays everyone!!!! 🙂\n\n-THE END-\n\n-Now, before we start off today’s review, I would like to say is, “YES”, I have watched the current episodes of Season 19 of “Thomas & Friends” and so far, I think it’s going good. Although, there are a few bad or okay episodes so far, but some are enjoyable, like “Who’s Geoffrey”, which is one of my favorites so far. But, when this season ends with ALL the episodes being finished on either TV or DVD, I will share my official thoughts on it on my blog. Thank you and have a nice day and let’s get to the REAL review!-\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!! TURN BACK IF YOU HAVEN’T– Whatever. If you haven’t seen this fan-film, please (DON’T) do so. But, remember, it contains some language, horrifying scenes for children, nightmare fuel, dark/grim scenes, and an unsettling atmosphere. If you don’t want to watch this film, it’s probably for the best and if you want to now what I mean, please read this review NO MATTER WHAT THE COST!!!!!:\n\nAnyways, proceed!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled (“SPOOKY”) Review, Already in Progress-\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON “THE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN”:\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: But, at least it’s not as weird and freaky as the new fan-“Thomas & Friends”-film titled “Shed 17”!\n\nRANDOM GIRL: HEY! Why not review THAT instead of this movie?!\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: NO! There’s NO way I’m reviewing a movie called “Shed 17”, even though the script says I’m doing it soon.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN (THINKING): Maybe. 😐\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Hey, Detective! Wanna review “Shed 17” right now?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: NO!!! That sounds like some type-of knock-off of a sci-fi-horror movie. But, anyways, adios, amigos!!! 😉\n\nLINK TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: https://detectivelibrarian.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/90th-review-specialseason-3-review-22-9-movie/\n\n-Now, Onto the Actual Review-\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: *Knocking at Door* Hey, Detective! A new “Thomas & Friends” marathon of the classic episodes from Season 1-7 are on! Wanna come and watch it with me?…….Detective, are you there? *Slowly Opens Door*\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: *Lying on the Ground*\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: “The Detective Librarian”! Are you alright?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN (INSANE): *Rising, While Having Insane Laughter* Hey, you! I need you all to do yourself a favor and GO!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Oh, no. Detective’s going psycho again over something he just witnessed. I better go and calm him down with a “MLP: FIM” character, like Twilight Sparkle (“Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle”). Come on, Detective. Wake up with your own Twilight.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN (NORMAL): Eeee–Oh, hey Twilight “Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle” and Ted!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Detective. Are you okay–\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: *Puts Ted Against the Wall* I’M NOT OKAY!!! I HAVE JUST SEEN THE ABSOLUTE-MOST-TERRIFYING FAN-(“THOMAS”)FILM FOR HALLOWEEN OF ALL TIIIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: “Tobias and the Arcane Merchant”?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Of course, not! It’s not only until 2017.\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. What’s it called?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:….It’s…Called…….”Shed 17″!!!……………….\n\nTrust me, most of the “Thomas” fandom was as shocked as you are! ANOTHER “THOMAS” CREEPYPASTA THAT MAY SEEM SILLIER THAN THAT “TIMOTHY THE GHOST TRAIN”/”GHOST TRAIN” AKA “PERCY’S GHOSTLY TRICK” DELETED SCENE!!! BUT, IT ISN’T!!!!\n\nTIMOTHY THE GHOST TRAIN: Not as scary as me?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: Sorry, Timothy. But, it IS scarier than YOU!!\n\nTIMOTHY THE GHOST TRAIN: Awww… But I wanted to celebrate with all those people who believe in me, but, screw it! I’m going back to the Internet, where I belong. So, bye! *BAM!*\n\nAnyways, this half-an-hour long film came out last week on October 6, 2015, just in time for Halloween, which is appropriate for the spooky/scary tone AKA the most horrifying holiday of the year, according to most people. Please note that this is no ordinary fan-film, it’s just a “mockumentary”/probably a documentary-parody and what makes it so scary??!!! SO TRAUMATIZING, SO DARK, SO…SO…..EEEVIILLLLL!!!! Okay, not really, but it’s still scary to watch for younger kids!! *Sigh* I’m sure all of you curious folks out there want to know. Since the audience from my review of “9” wanted this, let’s take a look at the “HORRIFYING HORRORS” of “Shed 17″…..Are you really sure that you want to turn back, this is the last chance!!….Okay…..\n\nSo, we start off this film with the logos of the creator of this fan-film (Pauls Vids), which makes it look like the video is still buffering, as well as images of the Island of Sodor on what it REALLY and currently is with unsettling music in the background and stock footage from the original opening titles of the show. Including an odd image at Ffarquhar Station, where we see the scrap remains of an American locomotive (for some reason, probably to make the tone more scarier), before we cut to the narrator of this “mockumentary” reveal to us that the tales of Thomas the #1 Tank Engine/Blue-Screen-Stealing-Hog are lies and the REAL truth behind the Island of Sodor/North Western Railway is no ordinary children’s story and it’s VERY horrifying. Gee, this might be “Sodor: The Dark Times” all over again, except without Trainz Simulator/Sodor Island 3D, like most “Thomas” fans on Youtube, almost. Except that it also shows that the Island of Sodor was once a detention center for Germans in England, due to the Nazis lead by Adolf Hitler during World War II. It’s told by one of the human character interviewed (like an actual documentary), a former Fireman of the engines on Sodor named Keith Hartley, who mentions another human character, a German professor named Vilham Gurter, who joined Hitler and his Nazis during the war because of an image shaking hands with Hitler. When the war broke out across Europe, he, his wife, and his four-year old son named Hans fled Germany and escaped to England, but was banned there, even though citizens were friendly towards him because they were going to give him another chance, I guess, before Hans grew up and left his family when he turned 18 and studied biology at his University.\n\nHe decided to start his own facility on the Island of Sodor called Sodor Research Ltd., which was a small lab located in Arlesburgh (on Duck’s Branchline, the Little Western, and one of the locations of the Arlesdale Small Railway) in 1962. Six years later, his wife got pregnant and had a baby named (you guessed it) Thomas and you can probably guess what’s going to happen to the human version of Thomas, later, since he’s been a cheeky Tank Engine/the last survivor of the LBSC E2 tank engines in England for decades in the “RWS” and the TV series, whose had his own branchline with his two coaches, Annie and Clarabel. While growing up, the young boy named Thomas watched the railways with interest and recorded them with his first camera and used it at platforms at various stations, but one reveals that Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller/President Fatlord/Fatty is a jerk after yelling at Thomas to get off his platform. Wow, I first I thought that the way he treated Thomas in “Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure” was more harsh, but THIS JUST TAKES THE CAKE and I can assure you, he’s going to act evil, instead of a stern, but kind-fatherly-figure towards the engines of the NWR. Whoever knew that Fatty was such a harsh man for everybody’s favorite controller of Sodor? He even shows that when we learn that he shut down various branchlines and stations, while pushing the NWR away!:\n\nYes, I swear that I am NOT joking, here! STH is a greedy moron in this alternate-universe movie!!! But (AGAIN), I digress, we then see Thomas and his father (which doesn’t look like his father called Hans) rush towards the level crossing, while being recorded on camera by Thomas. However, he fails to read the warning signs and we get our first jumpscare, everybody: When Thomas looks right and left, he then gets run over by (what it looks like) a BR diesel. I have to admit, that made me jump when I first saw that scene, even in one of the reviews of this film, NickonAquaMagna (one of the people who reviewed this film) jumped back when he first saw it, as well.:\n\nAnyways, Thomas’ body (which would already be torn to pieces by now) is taken to the Sodor Research and inside one of the sheds called “Shed 17”. There, he gets rebuild into the blue tank engine we know and love and it gets shown to people who were invited for a presentation for Thomas’ transfer to his steam engine body, coming out of the Shed 17. As you’d expect, many people are horrified over what they’re witnessing, including Keith Hartley, who goes next to the other side of the Shed to vomit. Really though, I laughed when I first saw it and it turns into a running gag when Keith gets interviewed at various news broadcasts when they bring up Thomas being his usual tank engine self and he (you know the picture) vomits, even though he doesn’t in the present. But, I have to agree with NickonAquaMagna that he eventually got over it. We learn that Thomas’ body is inside the tank engine body, along with his organs, muscles, and bones and humans who have been transferred to engines and vehicles (like Harold the Helicopter and Bertie the Bus) are not allowed to work on the North Western Railway. Why: Because if the engine begins to start operating, its organs would start to erupt from inside his body and cause him to die/burn to death, alive.\n\nHowever, many rich people foolishly decided to be turned into engines and Fatty decided to accept the offer and have other humans be turned into engines, while using a substance called biofusion, which is part of the process of engine-transformation. After they (like doofuses) get turned into engines, things start to go awry when footage of the new engine experiments are shown, including James and Edward, failing. One of the videos was about Edward filming for the TV series, when he was whistling to children and causes blood to spew out and about one of the first diesel/fuel-powered engines being tested with unseen footage. No, it’s not the well-known Devious Diesel (AKA Jasper in MilkTankerMedia’s series and given different names in other fan-series/films), it’s just Mavis this time. As she gets fueled up, things begin to go well, until it takes a dark turn, when Mavis gets caught on fire, her internal organs get burned, and she dies, too late. Wow, and I thought that Mavis’ death in “Tobias and the Half-Pariah” was her only death, but this is more grimmer because of her soulless face when the fire spreads to her and the aftermath of her.\n\nSo, we partake in more footage of engines spewing their guts/blood out, when it turns out that the engines being displayed during the off-season are actually failed experiments that were either already dead or too ill to be in full operation. But, Thomas is one of the only engines that never had any problems while he was still in-service and Sodor Research began to sell their research to international countries will railways, even though they wanted to keep their work, secret. Even failed biofused engines were being displayed in public, leaving Hans shocked over what it could be: “Slave Labor” for engines that are actually humans inside their bodies. This leaves Vilham into committing suicide by shooting himself in the mouth and instead of actual blood coming out, we see what looks like sawdust from wood, which is what the humans were made out of, back when the series had the models. Well, at least it wasn’t over the top like Johnny’s (played by the writer and director, Tommy Wiseau) suicide from “The Room”, where he had a silly rampage and the usual bad acting, which lead into putting his life to an end by shooting himself in the mouth. But, let’s take a look at that scene and see how over-the-top it is, shall we?:\n\nBut, at least “The Room” is one of those movies that it’s so bad, it’s good! But (ONCE AGAIN), I digress, more footage/experiments are filmed, including Gordon the Big Engine (no surprise), when his boiler, his eyes (with blood coming out), and HIS ENTIRE BODY explodes. The other piece of footage is about Harold flying, but ending up spewing blood out and crashing to the ground, while getting killed as well, seeing as how his organ system is connected to his rotor-blades and if they spun around, vital organs would get drawn out and kill him, during the process. At this point, you might end up feeling very shocked by this, as much as I am about it or even feeling insulted by it. Remember, if kids were about to watch this, you HAVE TO STOP THEM ASAP, BEFORE THEY SUFFER THE SAME FATE TO THOSE WATCHED THIS MONSTROSITY!!!!!!!!!!! But wait, THERE’S MORE!!! JUST WHEN YOU THINK THAT THEY CAN’T POSSIBLY CREATE ANYMORE HORRORS TO THIS CREATION, THEY DECIDE TO TELL US ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON THE EVENTS OF HENRY’S ACCIDENT WITH THE FLYING KIPPER IN THE SEASON 1 EPISODE AND THE “RWS” STORY, “THE FLYING KIPPER”!!!!!! Here’s how the REAL story of the Flying Kipper accident is told.\n\nOne night, when Keith unlocked the doors to Shed 17, Henry took a peek inside, reversed back outside, and confronted Fatty about it. He later warned Thomas about Shed 17, before you-know-who orders Henry to take the Flying Kipper from the docks and take it one winter’s night. But, remember when the points leading to a siding were frozen and it sent Henry to crash into a goods train, before being sent to Crewe to get rebuild to have a larger firebox and a new shape, so that he can’t use special coal, again? Well, it turns out in the REAL story that Fatty sabotaged the points, by freezing the points and placing a railway spike at the points and he never liked Henry and his cheerful personality (back when Britt Alcroft got the characters’ personalities right) and the goods train that Henry crashed into was actually a train of tankers, causing them to explode, and his crew freezing to death after jumping clear in the snow. He sends Henry to Crewe to (NOT BE REBUILT INTO A BLACK 5 LOCOMOTIVE) be scrapped, while screaming.:\n\nOh, thank GOD that we’re almost at the end. Okay. That night, even though his crew are already gone for the night, Thomas has already enough fuel/coal/steam in his firebox to brave his way through the Sodor Research Ltd. and to figure out what’s really behind Shed 17. As he goes inside, we FINALLY learn the big, real, disturbing, and shocking plottwist!!! It’s revealed that the current Thomas is not the boy who got run over, but is actually a clone and there were many attempts to create another Thomas, but failed, while the current Thomas had the human boy’s memories and DNA.:\n\nThat’s not the only horrifying thing in this film because we finally get to see what’s inside Shed 17 after all this time and (probably) one of the SCARIEST scenes in the entire flick!! When Thomas gets closer to the tank inside Shed 17, a skeleton hand bangs the glass window keeping him inside and Thomas gets so shocked by his real-failed self, his human body starts to come out, revealing his skeletal and organ body, while screaming VERY intimidating screams. See, I told you that it beat that “Timothy” creepypasta and even these scenes could be as disturbing as this!:\n\nBut, aside from that, this scene BEATS THEM ALL!!! We finally end this SCARY fan-film with the government investigating Sodor Research Ltd. and the Island, banning Biofusion (including Europe, after the Windscale Nuclear Flask Test in July 1984), Fatty vanishing without a trace, and Thomas going through twenty-three reconstruction surgeries. However, China is only country that allows biofused-engines, where prisoners are turned into engines, while being poked by an electric-stick thingy or a taser. Just when you think you’re allowed to turn off your computer and try to recover from this creepy misery, we gotta have a post-credits scene, where we see a cruise ship sinking to the bottom of the ocean, where the camera zooms into the cruise ship’s face. *DEEP SIGH*\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:…………..I shall never show you this film again!…\n\nI mean it, people. It’s scary, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HORRIFYING!! But, actually, it’s not bad. The plot was good, the acting is not bad, the suspense was carried out well, the humor was funny, and I really felt like that this is a twisted version of “Thomas” and the jumpscares are really hard to ignore, especially that “Skeleton-Engine” scene! Although, the animation is not that good and it could’ve been better and there are a few things wrong with the plot, like the big reveal about Thomas being a clone and I have to admit, it was a little weird to begin with. Seriously, what was that all about? Wouldn’t it make more sense to make a different version of Thomas, instead of doing those other tank engine clones?\n\nBut, it’s just my opinion. Overall, this film is a mixture of both scary and bizarre, I’m not saying that I don’t like or hate it or anything, I mean that it has some strange problems and explanations. I know a lot of people were traumatized when they first saw this and scared as well and they’re actually right. It may be so horrifying that you don’t want to show this to you kids (which I would do if I had kids) and make sure you show them the ONLY GOOD episodes of the show (including the Classic Series 1-7 and the revived version from Season 17 to onwards), especially Season 5, which had REALLY intense episodes. This leads me into putting my final score for “Shed 17” a 7.5/10 and let’s just hope that I don’t get forced into doing more scariness like this. I’m The Detective Librarian and I HAVE JUST SEEN THE ABSOLUTE SCARIEST FAN-“THOMAS-FILM/HALLOWEEN SPECIAL I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Hey, Detective! Wanna play “Five Nights at Freddy’s” with me?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN:\n\n(Sort of a “Nostalgia Critic” Reference)\n\n-THE END-\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! TURN BACK IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THIS SPECIAL YET!!!!!!!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled Review, Already in Progress-\n\nHello, I’m The Detective Librarian and some of you may have already remembered me doing a “Trailer Reminder” of today’s “Thomas” special, during my review of “Hero of the Rails” and mentioning it during my review of the last “Thomas” special I reviewed named “Day of the Diesels”. Well, I can assure you, it really was worth the wait and watch because of old characters coming back, great CGI animation from Arc Productions, three well-known celebrities joining the voice cast, having so much action, catchy songs, and having more characters and locations from “The Railway Series”. That way I can enjoy “Thomas & Friends” more, I will feel more happiness inside my heart. What is the special you may ask? It’s “Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure”, which recently came out on iTunes in the US on August 25, 2015, VUE Cinemas in the UK on July 17th, and will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the US on September 8th and in the UK on September 28th. I call this special “The Special with the Most Returning Characters, Locations, and Joining of Well-Known Celebrities” because of having Academy-Award Winning Actor, Eddie Redmayne be in the cast, along with Nathan Clarke, Sir John Hurt, and Jamie Campbell Bower.\n\nSo, let’s see if this special is worth having these three well-known celebrities and having all those returning characters. This is “Sodor’s Legend of the Lost Treasure”.\n\nSo, the special starts off on Thomas’ branchline, where everybody’s favorite screen-stealing hog AKA Thomas the Tank Engine is happily huffing along his branchline with his two coaches, Annie and Clarabel, He sees Bertie the Bus and he (of course) decides to have a race with him, but he nearly has a collision course with Toby and Henrietta, but manages to dodge them, unscathed. As for Bertie, he spots Oliver the Excavator (our first returning character that isn’t Oliver the Great Western Engine) on the road and heading to work on a new branchline, as well as a cameo of the Rev. W. Awdry AKA The Thin Clergyman riding on a bike. After this, we get cool opening titles that go like this.:\n\nAfter Thomas wins the race and stops at Ffarquhar Station, where Bertie sadly loses once again. He tells the news about the new branchline that’s being built from Arlesburgh to Harwick, before Thomas and his coaches chuff away. Annie and Clarabel get concerned that their branchline might close down, but Thomas is sure that their beloved branchline they’ve known for so long won’t get closed down, just because HE’S the Fat Man’s #1 AKA the #1 of the North Western Railway. Wow, what a way to foreshadow future events, Thomas, even for a title character that is a screen-stealer!!! Meanwhile, Marion the Steam-Shovel (the one voiced by Olivia Colman and first appeared in “Tale of the Brave”) comes across a forest, while she’s on her way to the construction yard of the new branchline. She describes it as an enchanted forest, until something zooms by her in gold dust (not Mr. Conductor’s gold dust from “Shining Time Station” and “Thomas and the Magic Railroad”). She shuts her eyes, until she bumps into Oliver the Great Western Engine and his breakvan, Toad, who are near the Arlesdale Small Railway and are collecting ballast from the Ballast Hopper.\n\nThe Small Railway Engines include Rex, Bert, and Mike from the “RWS”. Now, THIS IS, HONEST TO GOD EFFORT, FROM ANDREW BRENNER!!!! But, we don’t see Jock, Frank, Sigrid of Arlesdale, or Blister I & II, which are also from the “RWS”, which will (hopefully) appear some other time or in the next few seasons or years. Anyways, Oliver’s trucks are loaded with ballast and he and Toad take them to the new branchline, while Marion concludes that the Small Railway Engines are magic because of the way they zoomed by her earlier. Meanwhile, we see Duck (who is also helping out with the project) at the Construction Yards, where we see the return of Donald and Douglas, the Scottish Twins, who last appeared in Season 12.:\n\nWell, it looks like this special IS worth spending your money watching, instead of Sharon Miller-written crap! After Donald and Douglas’ (FINALLY) return, we then cut to the next scene, where Oliver the Excavator arrives at the construction of the new branchline, as well as seeing Jack the Front-Loader and the return of Alfie the Excavator (played by Nathan Clarke) and the official building of the branchline begins. Meanwhile, we cut to the next scene where Thomas is late for shunting some express coaches for Gordon the Big Engine, who is impatiently waiting at the platform, at Knapford Station, as well as making a reference to “The Big Engine Strike Trilogy”, when Gordon, Henry, and James went on strike because of them claiming that “Tender Engines Don’t Shunt”. 😉 After Gordon calls Thomas a “Silly Little Engine”, which makes Thomas to cheekily play a trick on Gordon to get back at him for calling him that insult. The trick involves Thomas pulling Gordon’s coaches out of the station, but things go awry when Thomas accidentally derails the coaches, causing a humongous mess!!!!! Back at the new branchline, we continue the subplot involving Marion’s silliness when she spots Oliver the Excavator and this scene is also funny because she thinks that the OTHER Oliver turned into an excavator (whom she believes is still magical) thanks to the wish Marion made earlier about being a digger/excavator. But, one of the tracks of the recently dug-cutting get unstable, which forces everyone to reroute the entire track into another line.\n\nBack at Knapford, Fat Man inspects the damage over Thomas’ accident and (of course) is not pleased over the mess Thomas made and punishes him by having him to work on the new branchline, while he has a new tank engine, which is Eddie Redmayne’s character, called Ryan. And to answer your question, the voice Eddie Redmayne gives Ryan is not the same voice as he did as Balem from “Jupiter Ascending”, which was terrible, but humorous. Let’s take a look with Ryan’s and Balem’s voice, shall we?:\n\nI’m not even joking, that’s how Eddie sounded in “Jupiter Ascending” and it really makes him sound like an emo, no offense. Anyways, Thomas arrives near the Small Railway and crossly tells Rex, Bert, and Mike about the whole situation and we get our first song of the special. Okay, folks, get ready for the biggest Disney and “Veggietales” knock-off (even though it’s enjoyable), you have EVER seen!:\n\nSo, after that song that looks like a Disney or “Veggietales” song and Thomas acted like he was tripping on ballast, Thomas takes the train full of ballast to the Construction Yard. There, he notices some flatbeds of rails and sleepers and idiotically decides to show everybody how useful he can be, by pulling the flatbeds to the construction area. The workman try to stop him, until Thomas destroys the danger signs, goes on the unstable track, falls down the track that creates a giant hole, and lands inside a cave. Inside the cave, he discovers an old pirate ship, while Ryan takes Annie and Clarabel out on Thomas’ branchline. Soon, Thomas is rescued by Rocky the Breakdown Crane and is scolded by Sir Topham Hatt AKA The Fat Controller once again and is sent to the Steamworks to be repaired, but doesn’t the chance to tell Fat Man about the pirate ship he just saw. However, a mysterious sailor named Sailor John (played by John Hurt, coincidence) and his boat named Skiff (voiced by Jamie Campbell Bower) are watching them in the ocean, while Skiff is spitting out water from the sea. Now, you can definitely tell that they’re the villains of the special and the Sailor John is MORE sinister than Diesel, Diesel 10, and other villains in the series.\n\nLater, Thomas receives news from Edward at the Steamworks that Rocky just lifted the pirate ship out of the caverns, even though Thomas ACTUALLY FOUND IT FIRST!!!! Wow, Thomas is really being put down by Sir Topham Hatt in this special and believe me, there are going to be more harsh scenes from this guy, later. Everyone decides that just because there’s a pirate ship, that must mean that there’s–:\n\n–Pirate treasure or something. The Marion subplot continues when Marion decides to wish that she could find the lost treasure from the Small Railway Engines. So, the Pirate Ship is held on display by Donald and Douglas, while Sailor John and Skiff AKA Jamie Campbell Bower are spying on the ship and the Scottish Twins themselves. That night, Henry the Green Engine is pulling the Flying Kipper (possibly), until he spots a white figure (which is actually Skiff, who is now a Railboat, and Sailor John) and gets frightened by it, which causes him to come to a complete stop at some buffers at a siding. He tells the other engines about his encounter the next morning at Brendam Docks, saying that it was a Ghost Ship, but no one believes him. However, Salty realizes that this may be connected to a legend of “The Lost Pirate” AKA the Ship and the Treasure’s backstory.\n\nDecades before this story begins, the Lost Pirate AKA Captain Callas sailed across the Seven Seas, while attacking Merchant Ships (which looks a bit similar to the Marine or the Navy) and stealing valuables and treasures. The Navy and the Merchants attempted to get back the treasure and chased after the Lost Pirate, but the Lost Pirate hid inside a cavern with his ship, while the Navy and the Merchants couldn’t find him. He buried the treasure and put it in a hole, as well as drawing himself a map in order to find it once again. But, he never got the chance because one stormy night, he lost the treasure map when the wind blew it away into the night. Now, the Lost Pirate roams around Sodor, looking for his lost treasure. However, all the other engines are not convinced, except for Henry because of him claiming that he did see a “lost pirate” that night. Meanwhile, Thomas continues his work at the Construction Yard, while taking on bad coal and finding out that Ryan is now part of the project.\n\nHowever, he still can’t go back to his branchline, yet because Percy’s now taking over it, like in “Trouble in the Shed” from Season 1. While we partake in more Marion filler, Thomas shows off black smoke and sparks from the bad coal he just took to the Small Railway Engines. That night, all the bad coal is removed from Thomas’ firebox, fresh coal is taken from a good coal hopper, and Thomas decides to sleep on a siding all by himself, even though Ryan offered him a place at the sheds. Later that night, Thomas is awoken by a boat figure and decides to follow it, which leads him to Skiff and Sailor John near the danger signs. Thomas nervously introduced himself to Sailor John and decides to help Sailor John and Skiff find the treasure, which remember, sounds like he’s partaking in stealing the treasure. Down at the cavern, Sailor John discovers the treasure map and comes back up, only to also discover that daylight is coming. He lies to Thomas that they forgot their shovel to find the treasure and they’ll continue their search tomorrow night.\n\nBut, the wind has died down, meaning that Skiff can’t go anywhere. Unless, if Thomas pushes Sailor John and Skiff, all the way to the ocean at Arlesburgh Harbor with Ryan noticing it, while he’s sleeping. Yep, I was right!! Later, Ryan asks Thomas about the other night, but Thomas lies to him that he didn’t see him pushing Skiff. This convinces Ryan that he’s only half-asleep and he was dreaming the whole time. However, unbeknownst to him, Ryan is taking on the bad coal, before he goes to Brendam Docks to collect some trucks, which will be important to the plot, and Thomas doesn’t warn him about. I guess it’s because Thomas still doesn’t trust Ryan AKA Eddie Redmayne and it happens.\n\nLater, Ryan returns and he starts to have the same side-effects Thomas had when he took the bad coal, yesterday. Sparks start to fly out of his funnel and land into his trucks, causing them to have black smoke coming out. It turns that Ryan’s cars are full of D-Y-N-A-MITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:\n\nHurry, everypeoples!! ALL THE FANGIRLS WILL GO NUTS OVER EDDIE REDMAYNE’S CHARACTER NEARLY BEING KILLED, ONCE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IN A “THOMAS” SPECIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HURRY!!!! Now, they have to get rid of the burning dynamite before it explodes. Marion and the other diggers pop up and she puts in her shovel, tosses to Alfie, then to Oliver the Excavator, and to Jack, who puts it back in the trucks full of dynamite. Yep, it’s official, just like in the Season 19 episode, “Lost Property”, “Thomas & Friends” has turned officially into a cartoon! Thomas tries to get rid of the trucks of dynamite, by pushing them, but he pushes them towards Ryan (while Fat Man is watching by in his car).\n\nLuckily, Ryan is switched onto a siding, while Thomas pushes the dynamite into the hole where the cavern is and we get a great, big, epic, outstanding, and awesome K-A-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!! Or in “Team Fortress 2”.:\n\nNow that Thomas has saved the day again, everybody is pleased, except for Fat Man, who is furious! He scolds Thomas severely and sends him to his shed to stay there for the rest of the afternoon, but doesn’t listen to Thomas telling the truth! It’s even harsh than the events of “A Canterlot Wedding” from “MLP: FIM”!!:\n\nGee, Thomas. I feel very sorry for you for having Fat Man turn into a MAJOR JERK THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SPECIAL!!!! This is “Tale of the Brave” all over again, where James acted like a bully towards Percy when he constantly teased him and scared him, ALL THROUGHOUT THE SPECIAL!!! But, at least James learned his lesson when Percy saved him from a landslide at the Clay Pits and apologized in the end. Anyways, back with the story, Marion continues digging and discovers that she found the treasure! But, there’s no one here to be told by her, so Marion will have to wait until morning. That night, Thomas finds Skiff and Sailor John again and we get a montage of them trying to find the treasure, while the song “We Make a Team Together” is playing in the background, but to no avail.\n\nNow, Sailor John realizes that someone has beaten them into finding the treasure, which is clearly OBVIOUS, ISN’T IT?!! Now, dawn is breaking out and that means that Skiff is going to remind John to get out quickly in a funny way.:\n\nSo, Sailor John and Skiff escape, without being noticed, while Marion shows her discover of the treasure to Thomas. The news later spreads to Sir Topham Hatt AKA the Fat Man, himself, who decides that (of course) it would be perfect for the Museum, while he sends Ryan to collect more dynamite and Thomas to collect construction waste to Whiff’s Waste Dump. Later that day, Thomas encounters John Hurt AKA Sailor John and Jamie Campbell Bower AKA Skiff again, who demands Thomas to know where the treasure is. As soon as Thomas tells Sailor John about the treasure being put in the Museum, as you’d expect, Sailor John is furious because it turns out that he WANTED the treasure for himself, instead of giving it to the Museum. Now, this is serious because Thomas pushes the Sea Duo out of the way and continues his job and stops at Knapford to overhear a phone conversation between Fat Man and the owner of the Museum about the treasure. However, the Museum looks like won’t accept the treasure, leaving Fat Man to keep it inside his safe (which sounds like a dumb idea because of an evil sailor/pirate with the voice of John Hurt stealing the treasure for himself, like most villains).\n\nLater that evening, Ryan encounters Thomas again, who thanks him for saving him from the burning dynamite and apologizes for getting him into trouble for the third time in a row. However, Thomas explains to him that HE should be the apologizing one because of him not warning Ryan about the bad coal in the first place. Now, Thomas has to be on guard at Knapford Station, just in case Sailor John breaks in here and steals the treasure. Later that night, Thomas keeps a sharp eye on Knapford, while the EVIL Sailor John himself shows up, breaks into Fat Man’s office, and steals the treasure from his safe! See, I told you that was a dumb idea! Maybe handing it over to the Museum would’ve worked, after all! Now that Sailor John is escaping with the Treasure and Skiff, Thomas has to chase after him and stop him!\n\nBut, during the chase scene, Thomas discovers that John has stolen the Pirate Ship, too and it’s too birds with one stone! Meanwhile, Ryan puffs around, who can’t sleep and have his driver and fireman be brainless robots and wonder about what Thomas had said to him earlier, until he discovers Sailor John and Skiff, pushing the Pirate Ship, which alerts the Small Railway Engines, who are sleeping beside him. Rex, Bert, and Mike decide to use ballast trucks to stop the villains and the Ship from escaping, which causes them to lose power (“Never Overlook a Little Engine”). Now, it’s Ryan’s turn to play his part when a rope from the ship, somehow ties up on his left buffer and drags him along the line and into another set of buffers. This causes the ship to crash to the ground, leaving Skiff and Sailor John, alone. Now, I totally get it, now!\n\nHIT Entertainment and Andrew Brenner wants the new characters voiced by famous celebrities to play important roles to the story because it would be a shame to leave celebrities as characters not on one big of a note and be sold for more toys, as usual. Anyways, the chase continues down to Arlesburgh Harbor and Sailor John tries to stop Thomas, by using various tools and dynamite, but is easily foiled. But, as soon as they reach a set of points, the villains switch to the track that leads them to escape, but Thomas luckily stops them at a crossed-track and pushes them to the ocean. But, Thomas’ firebox burns out, due to the water, allowing Sailor John to getaway scot-free, but not for long because the treasure on Skiff is causing him to rock-and-roll across the waves, until a giant wave causes Skiff, Sailor John, and the treasure to fall to the bottom of the ocean. Luckily (again), Skiff and John aren’t dead, Skiff’s just floating on the ocean, while John’s on top of him. As morning comes, the police arrive on Captain and arrest Sailor John, while Thomas is lifted onto a flatbed by Rocky and expects Fat Man to be cross with him. But, Fat Man is pleased because Ryan told Fat Man about Thomas preventing Sailor John AKA Pirate John from escaping with the treasure.\n\nBut, he assures Thomas that his engines are more important than any treasure and Thomas is his “#1”! I’m gonna take that as an apology scene, even though it’s obvious that Fat Man apologized to him, off-screen. Anyways, the new branchline is finally completed and the grand opening ceremony is held with Marion realizing that Oliver didn’t turn into an excavator at all and there are actually two Olivers on Sodor. At the ceremony, Fat Man announces that Ryan will be the goods engine at the Harwick and Arlesburgh Branchline while, you guessed it, Daisy the Diesel Railcar is going to be the passenger engine there, even though she’s supposed to be on Thomas’ branchline. We end this special with many things!:\n\n1.) Thomas cuts the ribbon, opening the branchline and he gets his branchline back.\n\n2.) The test tour starts and we get cameos of Max and Monty in full CGI.\n\n3.) Skiff now has his own “Railboat Tours” and gets a brand new paint job.\n\n4.) The treasure is found by some divers and Captain.\n\n5.) The branchline opens and Skiff and Thomas watch some fireworks at Arlesbu"
