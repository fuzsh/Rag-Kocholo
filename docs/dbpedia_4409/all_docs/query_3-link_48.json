MAY SHUT DOWN ON SUND AY SHOWS ENTIRELY Keith-Proctor and Percy O. Williams Consider Ad- visibility of Eliminating Seventh Day Per- formances for the Present at Least. Following an action brought by the city authorities to revoke the licenses of four New York theatres — Hammerstein's Victoria, the Alhambra, the American Mu- sic Hall and Hurtig & Seamon's 126th Street establishment, for violations of the \"Sunday law/' the threatened managers gathered in the United Booking Offices headquarters Tuesday morning and seri- ously considered the advisability of clos- ing down entirely on Sunday. It was de- cided to give no vaudeville show but either to leave the houses dark or give a mov- ing picture entertainment. It is understood that Percy G. Williams and the Keith-Proctor people advocated that action, while William Hammerstein stood firm against it, declaring that he would continue to give Sunday concerts, selecting his act, so as to keep within the requirements of the Doull ordinance. George Leventritt, William Morris's legal adviser, said that the American as well as the other Morris houses in the metropolitan district would give Sunday shows as usual. Mr. Williams and Messrs. Keith and Proctor up until Thursday morning re- fused to say what their action would be in the matter, but it was the general opinion among their business associates that they would take the safe course and keep their houses dark. If they do so the action may have a far-reaching influence on New York thea- tricals, for according to the opinion of a lawyer who is generally considered an expert on matters theatrical any manager who closes his house for a considerable length of time, thereby puts himself in the position of admitting that Sunday concerts are in violation of the law and 1 would be at a serious disadvantage should he ever be called upon to defend a charge of violation in the future. The City of New York brought pro- ceedings against the four theatres this week, the papers having been prepared on Monday by the corporation counsel. The action is an order upon the managers to show cause why their licenses should not be revoked. Papers were served Tuesday upon George Leventritt, for Morris in the American Musical Hall case, as well as upon a member of the Hurtig & Seamon firm, Mr. Williams or the Keith-Proctor people had not been served up until Wednesday evening. An action to revoke a theatre license is without appeal. It is probable that the four cases, like the recent proceedings against Hammerstein's, will be given over to a referee, although the Supreme Court has the option of passing upon the ac- tion summarily. This will probably not be done unless the city makes out a par- ticularly clear case in its original papers. If the city authorities secure a convic- tion they may impose a fine of $600. A significant point in this connection is that under the charter the decision of the Su- preme Court is final and without appeal. Should the case go against the managers they will not be able to carry the decision into a higher court. ORPHEUM BACK TO VAUDEVILLE. The Orpheum Theatre in Yonkers, under the management of Harry Leon- hardt, went back to its original policy of straight vaudeville this week, after ex- perimenting for a fortnight with moving pictures. On Monday a show of seven acts was booked in, changing Thursday with a bill of the same number playing Stainach & Newell's house in White Plains. The lat- ter firm is one of the biggest billposters in Westchester County. This system of bi-weekly change of riudeville will be continued at both i *r:es, the bills changing houses for the day matinee. MORRIS AFTER GARDEN, CHICAGO. Chicago, Dec. 30. William Morris has for some time been in negotiation for control of the Garden Theatre here, and upon his return to Chi- cago will probably close a lease upon the house. He is also understood to be dicker- ing for the Alhambra. The Garden is adapted to the use of vaudeville, although it will probably be necessary for Morris to spend $30,000 in repairs and alterations. It has a capacity of 1,600 and is located in a high-class resi- dential section on Wabash avenue, three blocks below the Auditorium. It was formerly Brooks' Casino, but has been remodeled and tables have been placed in the balcony and behind the orchestra. Thomas Noonan is the present manager and the current attraction is a musical comedy of the lighter sort called \"A Winning Miss.\" If William Morris takes the place over the annual rental will be at least $25,000. ADVERTISING WILLIAM PENN. St. Louis, Dec. 30. The program for the Harry Lauder Show at Odeon Hall carries an advertise- ment stating that among the theatres operated and controlled by William Mor- ris, Inc., are the Broadway Theatre, New York, and William Penn Theatre, Phil- adelphia. The William Penn is under a heading \"In Course of Construction.\" The others listed with it are The Orpheum at Wash- ington, Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago. ANNOUNCEMENT LOOKED FOR. Chicago, Doc. 30. While no details are obtainable, it ; « assured that negotiations are on for a South Side site, where it is intended to erect a theatre for burlesque. Shrewd surmises by well-informed peo- ple say they are quite positive I. M. Wein- garten, manager of the Trocadero (East- ern Burlesque Wheel), is promoting the enterprise, and the new house will take the place, when completed, of Mr. Wein- garten's \"Troc.\" It is said that n formal announcement will be given out in a few days, and that the new theatre will be up and doing business by the opening of next season. ARTISTS RESENT INTERFERENCE. (Special Cable to Variety.) London, Dec. 30. The warring artists are submitting a proposition to the agents to-day. It is reported that if it is declined a general strike will result. The artists resent the appearance of interference on the part of the managers. ENGLISH AGENT HERE. A. Braff, of the London agency of Schreck & Braff, arrived in New York a few days ago. His visit is designed partly to give him a first-hand inspection ,of American vaudeville conditions. Incident- ally he will make an effort to place sev- eral of the firm's big stars on tour In this country. He has already opened negotiations with William Morris, Inc., for contracts for Yvette Guilbert, the chanteuse. Other In- ternational artists under direction of Schreck & Braff are Maud Allen and Harry Frags on. MORRIS WANTS KANSAS CITY Sltl, Kansas City, Dec. 3& ; William Morris was in Kansas City this week. He admitted during his stay in town that he was looking about for a de- sirable site for a local vaudeville theatre. What was the result of his search did not develop. \"I have no doubt but that there is room in Kansas City for another vaudeville the- atre,\" he said to an interviewer. \"The fields looks very promising to me. \"William Morris, Inc., has five theatres in the East already and wc expect to in- crease this number by additions in Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis sill Kansas City. The St. Louis deal has been concluded and only last week I made arrangements for Detroit. \"An arrangement which will give Wil- liam Morris, Inc., access to a string of vaudeville theatres from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast is likewise under consideration.\" SAY LEASE IS READY. Baltimore, Dec. 30. There is a report here that a lease for the Lyric Theatre has been drawn, and it only remains for the official signature of William Morris, Tno.. to be attached. If signed the Morris Circuit will take possession on March 2G. VARIETY BECK'S BOOKING SCHEME BEING HELD IN ABEYANCE Latest Report Is That Martin Beck Is Fortifying Against a Future Emergency. The latest report, and the one gener- ally accepted as Martin Beck's plan of organizing his own booking department, independent of any other agency, is that Mr. Beck has been planning to fortify Mm«*if against a future emergency, pending the expiration of the instrument which at present binds the East and the West in a territorial agreement. This agreement, -which has about a year yet to run, prohibits the Orpheum Circuit or the interests represented in the Western Vaudeville Association, from playing vaudeville in the East in which it may be directly interested. From Chicago comes the report that everything is not at all harmonious in the. relations between several important members of. the Western coterie and the , United Booking Offices. E. 0. Kohl, of Kohl & Castle, Chicago, ..Is said to be somewhat antagonistic to- ward any move the United may have on foot, and Mr. Kohl is even rumored to have said that at a \"show-down\" he would enter New York. - The Eastern people laugh at this, claim- ing that Kohl was one of the first of the Western crowd to call for quarter when Klaw & Erlanger placed vaudeville in the Auditorium, Chicago, and it has been gen- erally accepted as true around New York that the Western contingent forced the United-K. & E. settlement. About Broadway this week, however, it seemd to be generally accepted that the purpose of Mr. Beck at present and for a few weeks past has been to place himself in a position where, if any un- toward event occurred, he could immedi- ately proceed on his own hook. SOME LAUDER RECEIPTS. From a fairly authentic source the fol- lowing receipts during the Harry Lauder tour, from the opening December 14 at Philadelphia to Christmas day at Chi- •cago, have been obtained: Philadelphia (2 shows) $6,000 Baltimore (night) 1,030 Washington (mat.) 1,060 Philadelphia (2; return) 6,600 Baltimore (night; return) 1,060 Pittsburg (2 nights; one mat) . 0,600 Cleveland (2 shows) 4,600 Detroit (2 shows) 6,000 Toronto (2 shows) 7,200 Buffalo (2 shows) Unknown Chicago (6 shows) 18,000 Milwaukee (mat.) 1,650 Up to Christmas day Toronto held the record for one day's receipts with $7,200, Baltimore taking the honors at the other end. Before the show opened in Chicago there was an advance sale of $10,000. An attempt by speculators in Chicago to se- cure tickets was checked and on the re- turn engagement (Decern be i 31 -January 1) every effort will be made to have only the legitimate purchasers secure the pasteboards. The Lauder tour is expected to end Jan. 10 at some Canadian oity, which so far has been kept secret. Jan. 9 at Mon- treal has been the date given out for the termination of the trip, but the Sunday following will be played. SPECULATORS ARMING FOR DEFENSE The ticket speculators, lately dislodged from their license privilege by a city ordi- nance, are preparing to fight. They are collecting a large fund for the purpose of retaining the most prominent lawyers in the State to represent them when the clash comes. Both ex-Governor Frank S. Black and lion. Alton B. Parker have been ap- proached to carry the case of the sidewalk men into rourt The method of procedure will probably be .this: The ordinance goes into effect January 15. When it is in operation a selected member of the speculators will attempt to ply his trade. He will be ar- rested, arraigned in a magistrate's court and probably held for Special Sessions. At this stage of the game habeas corpus proceedings will be instituted in order to get the matter before a Supreme Court judge without loss of time and the battle will be fought along these lines. It is possible that it will even get into the United States Court of Appeals. APPEAL TEST CASE. The legal proceedings to test the valid- ity of the contract issued to artists dur- ing the life of \"Advanced Vaudeville\" are not yet over. Maurice Goodman, counsel for the United Booking Offices, which took over many of these contracts, re- ceived permission this week to appeal the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the case of George W. Day against the United. Day, who is a comdeian, laid off two weeks under an \"Advanced Vaudeville\" contract, and refused to accept substitute time from the United. He was sustained by the Supreme Court. On appeal this verdict was sustained, one of the three judges dissenting. It was on account of this division of opinion among the judges that the further appeal to the Appellate Division was permitted. The judgment in Day's favor sustained the legality of the K. & E. contract. The United hopes to have it set aside or re- versed. In which case they will contest a number of suits now pending. DOROTHY RUSSELL ILL. Dorothy Russell, who recently played a vaudeville engagement at Hammerstein's, was seriously ill in the home of her mother, 161 West 67th Street. She caught cold during the Hammerstein week, and for a time it was feared that it would develop into pneumonia. She is now out of danger. \"TWO-DAILY\"; GENERAL CHAHGE. Chicago, Dec. 80. Following the last, visit of. Martin Becfc.- to this city, tip report has gotten out that Mr. Beck, in conference with E. C. Kohl while here, agreed that there were about fifteen houses booked through the Western Vaudeville Association and at present playing three shows daily, which could easily succeed with but two daily instead. The twice daily would increase the standard of the shows and the patronage, it is claimed, and the plan will shortly be placed in operation, according to re- port. The general scheme of the Western people, it seems, is to spread-eagle all available vaudeville territory in this section. BIDDING FOR SINGER. Several of the agents have sought to secure the signature of Alice Neilsen, the singer, for vaudeville contracts. Miss Neilsen returned recently from a concert tour under the management of Henry Russell, and is staying at the Hotel Will- Rrd, New York. None of the agents has so far succeeded in attracting the prima donna's attention. MATTHEWS REPLACES FABISH. Chicago, Dec. 30. While William Morris was in the city last week he changed the manager, Ar- thur Fabish, of the local branch by in- stalling J. C. Matthews in his stead. Mr. Matthews had come on here in ad- vance of the Lauder show. It is not known whether he will be permanently the Morris Chicago manager, but prob- ably will for some time anyway. Mat- thews will still maintain his booking agency in New York City, where Al Jundt is in charge. Fabish may start in a booking agency of his own. He has been the Morris manager for about two years. At one time the Morris Chicago office had sev- eral small houses to book. At the time of Mr. Fabian's departure there remained but Rock Island, III., and Davenport, la. Since Matthews assumed charge several agents around the city, according to re- ports, have offered (for a consideration) to place their bookings with Matthews and also enter the Morris office in the capacity of employees. If Matthews accepts these propositions it will go a considerable way toward building the Morris branch up around Chicago. It had deteriorated a great deal of late. The advent of Morris with his Lauder Show has brought his name out promi- nently hereabouts. On Saturday night last Matthews re- ceived a wire from M. Friedenwald that the Rock Island house had closed. The same manager directs the theatre at Davenport, playing the Morris shows. One removed the other from the Morris books, leaving Mr. Matthews a clean sheet in the office. Maurice Freeman and Co. open on the Poli time next week. Charles Bornhaupt, of the New York Marinelli office, protests that Fred Wal- ton did open at the Wintergarten, Berlin, and after one performance agreed to re- tire from the bill upon receipt of an in- demnity. He was booked immediately for a London appearance. POSSIBLE ST. LOUIS DEAL. St. Louis, Dec. 80. There > a pnMibtnty of a \"deal* here whereby the American Theatre (con- trolled by the Oppenheimer Bros.) will discontinue vaudeville, playing either stock or musical stock instead, leaving the vaudeville field solely to the Colum- bia, directed by Tate & Middleton. Tate & Middleton have, according to report, a one-half interest in the Ameri- can, and the losses there, caused by the Columbia's opposition, is* rapidly taking away the major portion of the Tate &, Middleton's profits on their own house. When the American opened last sea- son in a clear field, it started off with a bang, but with the opposition of the Co- lumbia, which has been improved at n cost of $70,000, the American, located poorly for a high class vaudeville show, dropped off in receipts until lately the account book has bean showing a de- ficiency of around 12,000 weekly.' While Martin Beck and Pat Casey were here the situation waa gone over, and the probable change in policy is ss id to be the outcome of that conference. Louis Oelal, who was the original \"big boy 1 ' of the American, is rumored to draw down $60 weekly from the American, with ten per cent, of the net profit the house earns. EXTENDS CARRIE DE MAR'S EN- GAGEMENT. London, Dec. 23. The engagement of Carrie De Mar at the Coliseum has been extended by Os- wald Stoll, who has proposed to Miss De Mar that she play the entire Moss Stoll Tour, returning again to the Coliseum at the expiration of the trip. Jos. Hart, Miss De Mar's manager, has taken the offer under advisement, his star having developed into a big popular suc- cess on this side. WILLS AND FIELDS TO STAR? A report was abroad in New York this week that Nat M. Wills, the tramp co- median, and W. C. Fields, the comedy juggler, might next season go on a tour with a show of their own. It was said that the pair were considering a play written by Stanley Murphy as their vehicle. KEITH OPENS THE HIPPODROME. Cleveland, Dec. 30. At 1:30 Keith's Hippodrome threw its doors open to the public. A small at- tendance was expected for the afternoon, but the house was sold out (4,600). Big changes have been made. The entire the- atre has been re-decorated, fine draperies have been put up and the walls adorned with costly pictures. , The bill included: The Morton- Jewel I troupe of five; Little Hip, performing ele- phant; \"A Night on a House Boat\"; James and Sadie Leonard and Richard Anderson, travesty; Gillette's Dogs and Monkeys; Johnson and Well, \"In the Sunny South,\" with ten colored players; Walter C. Kelly, \"Virginia Judge\"; Jef- ferson De Angelis and Co., \"The Re- hearsal\"; the Mirza Golem troupe of acro- bats. A big party from New York, in- cluding A. Paul Keith, witnessed the opening.

Besides selling the machines, the concern propose to institute a com- peting taxicab business around the New York theatres and hotels. John Neff, formerly a member of \"The Brigadiers,\" opened this week at the Olympic, Chicago, with a novel single specialty. Musical instruments are spread all over the stage and Neff uses them as an incidental to his talk without playing. Geo. W. Englebreth, after being amuse- ment and booking manager, Coney Island, Cincinnati', Ohio, five years, has renewed his contract for two seasons more, begin- ning April 5. He is building a new sum- mer theatre, which will be finished by that date. Ray Reveridge is ill with a severe cold nt the Hotel Rreslin. She caught cold while posing at the American Music Hall last week. During her final number she was forced to stand in a strong draught from an electric fan, which moved the light draperies about her. The Davis-Gledhill Co., bicyclists, who recently played the William Morris time, were offered an engagement in a popular priced Family theatre in Pennsylvania last week. Eight shows a day are given there. The cyclists ride five miles at each performance and declined to engage in a six day bicycle contest. A new art was placed this week in the olio of \"Miner's Merry UurleBquers.\" It is a now offering with Harry Fox, the principal comedian and the Millership Sis- tors, featured. Tom Miner personally su- perintended the staging of the sketch in Buffalo last week. Several minor changes were also made in the show during Tom's visit Billy Inman, of \"The Golden Crook\" Co., purchased a numbered ticket for a gold watch raffle last week in Chicago. Billy drew \"32,\" paid 32 cents and won tho watch. Jack Reid, with the same show, looked the gold affair over, and said that in his opinion, as an expert on phony jewelry had Billy drawn \"3\" instead he might not have been \"stuck.\" William Dillon was suffering somewhat this week from an accident sustained while returning to the American Theatre from a club engagement Christmas evening. He was hurrying to the Music Hall in a cab when it was struck by a street car. Dil- lon was thrown violently on his side, receiving a severe blow over the heart. He played the evening performance al- though in distress. James E. Curt in, of the London The- atre, New York, became a grandpa on Christmas, when a telegram notified him that his daughter, Mrs. J. J. Applegate, of Beaumont, Tex., had presented her hus- band with a 12-pound girl. Mr. Curtin declared that the news was his beat Christmas gift, and insists that although he is not at all puffed up, being a grand- pa really requires a little added dignity of bearing. A curious thing about the beginning of the holidays was that last week both matinee and night performances on Satur- day were larger in attendance than on Christmas day. This has led several man- agers to consider for next year the ad- visability of closing their houses during the five days preceding Christmas, and playing a combination for the remaining day, it being, of course, impossible to secure an adequate variety entertainment for the single day. As a peculiar sidelight on the mental processes of police officers assigned to the duties of Sunday night critics at the vaudeville theatres one of those worthies refused positively to permit the appear- ance of Harry Gilfoil at the Fifth Avenue Sunday, even without makeup, because, he said, Mr. Gilfoil's reproduction of the growls of wild animals was an imitation and therefore under the ban of the law. A lawyer who was on hand to advise Man- ager Irwin, argued that Mr. Gilfoil's offer- ing was perfeetly proper, and gave it as his opinion that it was no violation. The policeman was obdurate and the manager finally decided to be on the safe side. Billy Rock won the \"Apache\" race only by a few days. G. Molasso and Mile. Corio, recently at the Moulin Rouge, Paris, arrived last Saturday to play on the Mor- ris time with a number similar to Rock's new dance, which opened at the Fifth Avenue Monday. The foreigners were scheduled to open at the American late this week. Molasso was on this side five years or more ago. With Salvaggi he did a straight ballet dance at Koster & Rial's. This did not catch on, and sev- eral girls were added to make what was known as the Molasso- Salvaggi troupe. Lnder Salvaggi's name the company toured the country until recently. Molas- so r^-'-ncd to Europe. This is his first appearance on this side since then. -' T I I H»- s -\\ VARIETY TO REPLACE DETROIT HOUSE. Chicago, Dec. 30. A new burlesque theatre at Detroit to replace the present Gaiety is contemplated by the Columbia Amusement Co. (East- ern Burlesque Wheel). Manager J. M. Ward of the Gaiety is searching the city for a desirable site. He has an option on two, and the probabilities are the new structure will commence building next summer. THOUGHT \"LAUDER\" \"LOUDER.\" Chicago, Dec 30. Harry Lauder will return to Orchestra Hall on New Year's. The Morris show played to capacity there last week, and will probably do so again. It is a curious commentary, however, on the reflection of a metropolitan's rage outside of the big city, that Lauder was little known here before the press de- partment commenced to work. Chicago knew all about Scotch whisky and $12 Scotch suits, but it was a bit hazy about who Lauder was. J. C. Matthews came on here in ad- vance of the show. Jim enthusiastically boomed his star, and even told a crowd of professionals while eating in the Col- lege Inn what a fine performer Lauder was. Someone around the table remarked the College Inn orchestra didn't seem crazy over Lauder's music, so Matthews called the head waiter, saying: \"Tell the orchestra to play Lauder music\" The director of the restaurant returned in a moment and, addressing Matthews, said: \"I have told the orchestra to play louder, sir, and hope you will hear it all right now.\" Jim collapsed. OFFER FRANCHISE TO COMEDIENNE. The officials of the Columbia Amuse- ment Co. have offered to lease a fran- chise for a burlesque show on their cir- cuit next season to Daisy Harcourt, the English comedienne, with the proviso that she travel with the organization as the star and feature. Miss Harcourt, since her return to this country, has once or twice played in the Eastern Wheel houses around New York as special attraction, and in each case has scored a tremendous success. It is this that makes the managers anxious to have her enter their wheel. FRENCH WRESTLER HAS SHOWING. Chicago, Dec. 30. Bedini and Arthur are playing at the Olympic, Chicago, this week, having left Scribner's \"Big Show\" for the occasion. The \"Big Show\" is at Euson's in that city, with the new French wrestler, de Rouen, as the extra attraction. De Rouen has been in this country about a month. He is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. Last Sunday night while wrestling Anderson, a local man, de Rouen was so rough in his tactics the audience hooted. The Frenchman threw Anderson in eleven minutes, having agreed to forfeit $50 if he could not secure a fall within fifteen minutes. De Rouen is a Graeco- Roman wrestler only, but givos his opponents leave to use any style of hold. PLIMMER HOME. Walter J. Plimmer returned to New York late last week, after a long absence in Eng- land. He will remain here until next Au- gust placing English acts. After that he goes back to the other side to resume with \"Happy Hooligan,\" the show which closed after a disastrous tour in England. Mr. Plimmer said the show did well enough until it ran into a long list of book- ings in Lancashire, where there was a cot- ton strike on and the people were without money for amusements. Next year's tour commences at the Lyric Opera House, Hammersmith, London. Lester Mayne wil remain in charge of the Plimmer agency. BEEHLER LEAVING SIOUX CITY? Sioux City, Dec 23. There is a strong likelihood that David Beehler, manager of the Orpheum, will be promoted to a position in the New York headquarters of the Orpheum Circuit. Mr. Beehler has made the theatre and himself very popular since assuming the management when the house opened. Geo. Harrison, present manager of the Or- pheum, Spokane, is spoken of as Mr. Beehler's successor. BEDINI TO BE WHEEL MANAGER. Chicago, Dec. 30. Jean Bedini has been offered an option on the proprietorship for next season of Sam Scribner's \"Big Show,\" an Eastern Burlesque Wheel property. Bedini's con- trol will probably be in the nature of a lease, the lessee taking over for the time being the franchise and bookings of the organization. The terms are the payment of $2,000 to Mr. Scribner and a weekly payment of $100 to the Columbia Amusement Co. Mr. JVdini will probably close his option by the middle of January. Bedini and Arthur were a feature of \"The Big Show\" until Monday, when they left and accepted an engagement at the Olympic Music Hall. SECOND APPEAL. T. W. Dinkins has carried his suit for an accounting on a partnership agreement with Weber & Rush into the New York Court of Appeals, the final tribunal in this State. The original suit as well as the first appeal went against Dinkins. LIVELY CHICAGO BALL. Chicago, Dec. 30. The Theatre Employees' Association held its eighth annual ball Saturday night at the Coliseum Annex. It was a masque, and some of the masqueraders were very picturesque. A large crowd attended, the affair reaping a substantial profit for the association. The Committee of Arrangements in- cluded H. Murray Byers, Frank Burns and Sam Weiss. \"CONTINUOUS\" IN BALTIMORE. Baltimore, Dec 30. Marion S. Pearce & Philip J. Scheck opened their \"Victoria\" Monday night, the first continuous vaudeville in Baltimore. The seating capacity is 1,600, and the house was packed. The vaudeville that greeted the first patrons of \"The Victoria\" included The Four Musical Kings, musical; Humes and Lewis, comedy acrobats; Starbuck and Mandell, hand balancers; Archionri, jug- gler; Shayne and King, Hebrew come- dians; George C. Davis, monolog; Clara Maehammer, singer, and the Divo Twin Sisters, sister act. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE LEADERS, WE LEAD THE FOLLOWERS. 12 MINUTES IN \"ONE.\" \"Vardon, Perry and Wllber, \"Those Three Boys,' are three young men from the west, appearing first In a colored long coat and bat. tna boya afterward change to light suits. Popular songs are sung, but none of the many much-hammered variety. Seldom has an act played New York for the first time allowing such good Judgment In the handling of their offering. While they arc engaged In a number, one concludes how well a colored Ugh: would look upon them, nad lo! the next moment, the light la there which shows that the trio have studied the beat effect*. Besides the singing, string instruments aro played, the trio being their own accompanists, subduing the music and volume to obtain the best results. They sing just enough of each selection to make the audience ask for more. In this way they are giving mora songs In eleven minutes than a great majority of singing trios and quartets are doing in double the time. It's different from the rent, and the muBlc is of merit, both the vocal and Instrumental.\"— (SIME.) They ping, dance and play, all at the same time. Will consider offers for Vaudeville, Burlesque or Musical Comedy. All playing parts. Address care VARIETY, AGENTS APPLYING. The applications of practically all the agents doing business with the United Booking Offices are in the hands of the chief executives and it is probable that they will be passed upon and licenses is- sued under the new system by the first of next week. The absence of A. Paul Keith and other United officials in Cleveland to attend the opening there of the Hippodrome, prevented earlier action on the applications. The new split commission plan went into effect Monday when official notification was sent out to all the agents. \"A COUPLE OF KINGS.\" When Same Rice, of \"The Merry Maid- ens,\" read Dave Marion's greetings in the Anniversary Number of Variety, in which Mr. Marion styled himself \"The King of Burlesque,\" Sam rang for a mes- senger boy and despatched the following to that comedian: \"Dave Marion, Star, Cleveland. \"Compliments to King Dave and Queen Agnes from King Sam and Queen Lulu.\" \"Queen Agnes\" is Agnes Behler (Mrs. Marion), the leading woman of the \"Dreamlands.\" \"Queen Lulu\" is Lulu Beeson (Mrs. Rice), who is appearing in her own highly successful vaudeville number. PLAYS WITH BROKEN LEG. Frank Moore, \"the Tin Man\" comedian with \"The Behman Show,\" at the Star and Garter this week, is playing with a broken leg. The injury was sustained in an accident last week. In spite of doc- tors' advice Mr. Moore insisted on playing and managed with the aid of splints and plaster casts to walk through his part. MLLE. JOLY VIOLETTA. Mile. Joly Violetta is famous in all capitals of Europe and South America, whence she imported the famous dances which have contributed to her great repu- tation. She made her artistic debut at the age of 8 in the opera, Paris, and since then has succeeded in making herself considered the first of all European stars, as much for her originality as for the fine quality of her productions. Mile. Violetta had several times the honor of appearing before sovereigns and notably before his majesty, the late Don Carlos I, of Portugal, and his royal family, and again recently before his Majesty Nicholas II, of Russia, and the imperial family, on the occasion of the marriage of his Royal Highness William G'uillaume de Sudermanie and her Im- perial Highness Princess Marie Paulovua in the Imperial palace of Tsarokee-Salo. iS.he will present for the first time in North America, one of her latest crea- tions, at the Olympic, Chicago, Jan. 4. The offering consists of a series of paro- dies of European stars and her unique dances, in which she is assisted by Sr. Arnaud. Mike Bernard and Blossom Secley have smoothed out their differences, and are playing at Louisville this week. Sign a Roberts opens at Montgomery, Ala., next week for a tour of the Ma- jestic Circuit. VARIETY LEO CARRILLO'S CARTOON OP THE WEEK CHANGES LAUDER'S ROUTE. Springfield, 111., Dec. 30. William Morris's \"Harry Lauder Show\" will give a matinee performance here to- day at the Chatterton Opera House. A night performance will be given at the Grand Opera House, Peoria. These two dates take up the intended appearance of Lauder at Indianapolis. The routed date for Cincinnati has been shifted to an extra day at Detroit (on the return engagement), where Lauder will play January 2-3 instead of January 2 only. The partnership between Jack Levy and Bill Lykens ends to-day. Mr. Levy re- mains alone in the same suite of offices at 140 West 42d Street. Mr. Lykens goes to the Charles K. Harris establishment. William Morris is due to arrive in New York Saturday, leaving the Lauder Show at Chicago New Year's. NO CHANGE OF POLICY. Paris, Dec. 22. As reported by cable the Casino de Paris was sold Saturday, 12, and the new management, Richard W. Reith & Co. took charge. The only notice given to the public of the change was a note inserted in the papers of that day stating that the Casino de Paris had been taken over by an American director, to whom all com- munications should be addressed. R. W. Reith, Rue de Clichy, was asked for details of the transfer, but declined to give any further particulars, simply stating that he will manage the Casino himself, that no alterations are to be made, and that the hall will stick to vaudeville. Somebody still has faith in the popular- priced dramatic business. \"The Bad Man's Wife,\" organized in Chester, Pa., late last week for a tour of the Stair A Havlin Circuit. SHOWMAN AND EX-SHERIFF MEET. Butte, Mont., Dec. 30. While Jack Sutton, of the Tasmanian- Van Diemans, was putting up his appa- ratus at the Family Theatre last week, he was approached by a local policeman named Youtz, who asked him if he were the same Sutton who was city marshal of Buena Vista, Col., in the lawless days of the 70's. Sutton replied that he was, and Youtz introduced himself as the deputy sheriff of Lake county in the same territory that time. They spent most of the week talking over old times, bad men, the rush to Leadville after the gold strike and old-time experiences when they played target for Colorado desperadoes. The Harris Amusement Co., of which John P. Harris, of Pittsburg, is largely interested, has taken the Kanter building in Detroit, and will convert it into a theatre. The corporation is capitalized at $100,000. SAM BERNARD NOT YET, BUT— Chicago, Dec. 30. The tour of the Sam Bernard show, \"Nearly a Hero,\" has been extended for two weeks. It will work into New York from Chicago. Mr. Bernard is scheduled to enter vaudeville via the Colonial, New York, the latter part of February. In conversation with a Vabiety repre- sentative this week the German comedian took occasion to deny the story that he contemplates opening a wall paper shop in Essex street. \"There's not a word of truth in it,\" said he. \"What do I know about wall paper? My Essex street enterprise is a kosha butcher shop.\" The Musical Johnstons nrrivcd l)?c 24 on the Adrfatic, after .■.■: nb'Nce in Europe of two year i.--y ,'i'> to re- main on this sirf' . ■. u year, return- ing for a tour of the Moss-Stoll time the latter part of 1009. 8 VtfttBTT London, Dee. 22. Edgar Lee, editor of the Encore, died Dec. 14, after a short illness. Alburtus and Millar move from the Hippodrome to the New Cross Hall next week. Frederic Melville and his Moto-Girl open the Stoll time at Liverpool next Monday, Dec 21. Vesta Tilley will probably be seen soon in America under the management of Percy Q. Williams. Kurkamp, the singing musical director from the States, is making good at the Holborn Hall. Fougere is held over at the Holborn this week. The French comedienne is making good here forty ways. Horace Goldin is working at New Cross Empire Theatre. Mr. Goldin just finished an engagement at the London Hippo- drome. The entire vaudeville situation over here just at present, as far as it relates to artists, agents and managers, remains un- changed. Callahan and St. George play Birken- head next week, where they will receive double the salary for which they came to England. The Empire, Oldham, one of the houses barred by the agents' association, has again been placed on good terms with this body. Last Monday at the Coliseum, Jos. Hart's \"Polly Picklet's Pets\" opened very big. At the Hippodrome Mr. Hart's \"Rain- dears\" did very well. Creasy will most likely be seen at the Palace in the spring, as an engagement has been offered him through Paul Mur- ray of the Morris office. Daly and O'Brien were successful at the Canterbury last week. Saturday night they received a whole garden of flowers from enthusiastic Yanks. Julian Rose made a tremendous suc- cess at the Lyceum in the pantomime, a new departure for Rose, who appeared in his Hebrew character. The Lyceum piece is built round Rose's \"Levinsky.\" The Great Monohan, roller skater, has been making a tour of England and Ire- land playing the rinks. TTe will be seen in London shortly at the Olympia Skating Rink. Marie Dressier has started rehearsals for her own play at the Aldwych Theatre. It is hoped that Miss Dressier will break the spell that has hung around this the- atre for some time. Bill Manning, formerly of Manning's Players, has secured the rights of the \"Mysterious Cross,\" an illusion, formerly owned by Carlton. Mr. Manning expects to travel with the act. LONDON NOTES VARIETY'S LONDON OFFICE. 418 ITEAVD, W. 0. (Mall for Americans and Euro|iran» In Euro|* If addrt-Raed can- VAItlETV, as above, will be promptly forwarded.) Alf Holt, the mimic, writes from New Port (England): \"My voic is all right again, and Mr. Stoll anticipates a tre- mendous business on that account at all houses along the line where I am booked: tt \"Sweet Inis Fails,\" the Irish dramatic sketch that opened with Mr. Barrasford at the Hippodrome, Brighton, was closed after the second night. This squares the management, for it was a sure enough bad one. Arrangements are being made for Helen Trix's appearance at the Hippodrome during the Pantomime season. A simi- lar act to Miss Trix's has never been shown at the Hip, and it will be a nov- elty for the house. In all probability B. A. Rolf e will open a producing agency over here. Mr. Rolfe thinks that there is an abundance of tal- ent on this side, and if handled properly a good share of it could be turned into good vaudeville productions. Fred Karno's \"Casuals\" is playing the Holborn Empire this week and getting away big at every performance. Karno has put a lot of clever people in the sketch, and the comedy all the way through is ahead of even bis other sketches. A report saying that the Alhambra, Brighton, has been taken over by the Barrasford Tour has been going around for the last week. If this is true Mr. Barrasford has this popular resort all to himself, that house being the only oppo- sition at present to his Hippodrome. At the Vaudeville Club a reform move- ment has been started. The time limit, which did not exist before, has been placed at 4:30, and some are sore. In the case of Frank Fogarty or \"That\" Quar- tet making another trip over here a spe- cial concession will have to be made. \"Willie\" (his last name doesn't make any difference) at the German Club is making preparations for the big New Year's affair that occurs in this place yearly. Willie said that the bunch made an awful dent in his wine cellar last year, but hopes for the be-t this year. Leon Zeitlin, who has for the last six months been associated with Brook's Agency, will take up the reins, with Will Collins as associate manager, of the Payne Syndicate Booking Office. Mr. Zeitlin was in the employ of the Syndi- cate office before he went into the agency business. 'Tis said that Belle Belmont is turning down oflVrs for pantomime right and left. A part of Belle's talk runs something like this: \"Say, Party, let me slip you a little talk. You know I have had enough of that first part, olio and afterpiece to steer me from that Panto thing. And I know they are just as close as the Dewey is to Ziemer's.\" Dorothy Kenton says that while wait- ing to go on at the Wintergarten, Ber- lin, one of the bears of an animal act that happened to be in a cage in the wings grabbed her, and tried to drag Dorothy through the bars into the cage. A trainer beat the hugging kid away, and Dorothy states that not much damage was done. Tis said that bears like blondes, and the banjo girl admits it was some hug anyway. Fred Ginnett's \"St. George and tha Dragon\" is also at the Holborn Hall. A witch's cave is the opening scene. The head witch has the seven champions of Christiandom, meaning the knights who had won the heavyweight title in their own country, in her power in the cave. The main witch is strong for St. George, who is champion of England (with apolo- gies, Gunner Moir). She shows the knights of the other countries to her white-haired boy (St. George), and she does it with a speech something on this order: \"This is St. of Spain, most gallant knight, but the everlasting friend of the sons of Britain.\" When a house full at the Holborn don't fall for that stuff then it ought to be enough. The same kind of a speech with every knight and not more than two hands throughout 1 Outside of this the act has nothing but bad acting and a fight between George on a pony with a dragon, which is good enough to look at, but it does not square the first part of the act by any means. There are seven ponies ridden by the knights. They look good enough to make up a capital f»nimal act. At the Sadler's Wells Music Hall this week the \"Kidnapped King,\" a dramatic sketch, is showing. There is nothing like keeping right with the audience. That is. the producer of this sketch must think so, for he takes a character out of one of the penny weeklies, called Sexton Blake, and puts him in this playlet. Blake has the same standing in England as Old Sleuth has in the States. In the plot there is a young king whose relatives try to get his job and kidnap him, sending him to the \"woods\" in charge of an old hag. Then Blake is put on the job, and the excitement commences. The detective does a \"R. A. Roberts\" all over the place, fooling all the king's false friends and re- lations. It's hard to tell how the plain clothes man gets away with all these im- personations, but he always was captain of the guard at the right time, and it did not take him long to find the king and settle the affairs at the palace. At the finish the court try to induce him to stay, but he, like the rest of 'em, says: \"No; I must go. There is much work to be done in London.\" This all happened in a country called Meislan. COLISEUM. Week Dec. 17. Enough vaudeville last night (first an- niversary, Dec. 10) to hold 'em for awhile. Twenty-five acts on the bill, and all but one appeared, Laurence Irving and Co. being the absentee. The show ran from 7:30 until midnight, and towards the end the audience grew restless. The turns towards the finish suffered through this. Carrie De Mar and Evie Greene were both on late, and only sang one song. The house favorites pulled through very well, despite the sleepy audience. Frederick Villiers, the war correspon- dent, another of the regular program, gave a very interesting lecture with pic- tures, but the act seemed slightly out of place. And then for a finish he makes a speech advising all sons of Britain to spend their spare moments practicing with a rifle, for \"no one knows how soon the clouds of war,\" etc., etc. All very well, but is a music hall the right place to express such sentiments. Dorothy Grimston and Co. and the Gems, two more regulars, were very well received. Howell and Scott and Barton and Ash- ley are another pair that get away nicely on the long bill. Gus Garrick, in a cos- tume of the R. G. Knowles type, imitates the different styles of the English comic singer in a very pleasing way. Steve Bartle, a concertina player, does the remarkable feat of giving an imita- tion of church bells without announcing the same. And some more farmyard imitations. Argo, by his announcements, tries to con- vey the impression that he is from the Continent. His imitation of the lion with the ever-present lamp chimney, was done in English. Of the added attractions Mrs. Cecil Ra- leigh and Co., in a sketch: Hubert Car- ter and Miss Edyth Olive, another sketch ; Maidie Scott; Elmer Spyglass, a colored comedian with a very good voice, and Helen Trix, the \"Piano Kiddo,\" were the ones to get away with the honors. JAY GOINES Of ANDERSON AND GOINES. The much talked about team of \"Polite Colored Corned I ana.\" New York City claims the act la far above the average of colored teams, being out of the ordinary. They acored very heavy at K.- P.'a 5th Ave. and 125th Street Theatres past two wceka. En route West, United time. VARIETY BRIGHTON HIPPODROME. London, Dec. 23. A show not worthy of the house ap peered leet week et Barraafontfs Brighton HelL It wee not until Friend and Down* ing ehowed in the fifth position that any- one realised it was a vaudeville show. Norah Stockelle, a girl with a fair voice/ opened, doing well enough. A play- let called \"Sweet Innisfall\" contains all the bad comedy, miserable \"pathos,\" \"red fire\" and poor acting possible in eighteen minutes. The man who owns the sketch is a London County councilor. Amy Russell, a nice soprano, came next and got away very fair. Vasey and Ram- sey, with the worst patter imaginable, were on the bill. The comedian is a nov- elty, but perhaps doesn't realize it. He is made up to look like a German, but has a dialect that may be Irish, French or Ger- man. The pair do a fair dance on a mar- ble slab table that pulls them through. Friend and Downing (first European appearance) were next. The boys with their talk had the house laughing all the while, and the parodies were a scream. It looks as though the pair will have to stay over here for some time from the way the Brighton folk accepted them. The Brilliants are two xylophonists who play long overtures, and are applauded on account of apparent hard work. The selections rendered by the girls are not made to sound as well as the average. The affectation of one of the girls is enough to get an audience sore if they wanted to take it to heart. George S. Melvin does very well with a little song and Scotch reel. He is a grace- ful boy. Willie Gardner was there with the skates. He does fully as well with the skates as most do in the regular clog shoes. Callahan and St. George were the head- liners, and held up that position finely. The team have made an addition to the act in the shape of a little Irish terrier. Surrie Linden's \"Monks at Play\" don't seem to make much difference to anybody. They dosed the show. PALACE, CHELSEA. Week Dec 14. Two good comedy sketches are the fea tures of a good bill at the Chelsea hall. \"The Ghost of Jerry Bundler\" brings forward Martyn Roland, who lately at- tempted a monolog. Roland can do this sort of work without using a net, for he is an honest and sincere artist, and has a good vehicle. Aleck Lauder, brother of Harry, showed in a sketch called \"The Christening.\" Lauder does an ignorant Scotchman who has taken unto himself a very wise wife. The missus does all the ehurch going for the family, and when it comes to the christening of Anderson's (Lauder) first, the wife tells him what to say to the minister when that gentleman calls. The comedy is all between the minister and Anderson during their talk. The act has plenty of good laughs, and caught on with the Chelsea audience. Millie Hylton is singing a Nell Brink- ley song, wearing the Brinkley clothes and pose. She looks very well in this number, and though not a singer of much note her appearance will carry her through. Her second song has an un- usually catchy chorus. With the aid of the orchestra leader Miss Hylton makes it a very good comedy number. Shirley LigghVs colored quintet were very popular through their singing. Joe Archer is a splendid comedian, but seems to get away too fast in his monolog. He has some old ones which he could leave out. His other material would make him the big laugh anywhere. Martin Hender- son, the Blind Musician, who opens the show, always gets away big. Ella Lo- raine is a vocalist who sings. She really does sing, but that's all. Minnie Mace was there as a comedienne, and Menotti, the single wire bicycle rider, closed the show. Miss Ellaine Terns and Seymour Hicks. \"Fly by Night\" Comedy; Musical. Palace, London. The musical comedy part of it will never make any difference, but one Sey- mour Hicks in vaudeville is a grand treat. Mr. Hicks and Miss Terris are on the stage about fifteen minutes together at one stretch, and showed that they could have dispensed with the stage settings and the good-looking girls that are used in a few choruses. For an act in \"one\" this pair, who will probably not remain in vaudeville long, take odds from none of them. Mr. Hicks is one of the best travesty men that has been seen in a music hall this long time. He and Miss Terris do a burlesque \"Apache\" dance that kept the house roaring. There is also a good bunch of local material nicely han- dled by the pair. Except for Miss Terris, who is a very pretty girl and can sing and act more than a little, and Mr. Hicks, there is nothing worth mentioning, but everybody seemed to be satisfied. WARNING TO CLUB AGENTS. The License Commissioner of New York has issued a general warning to club agents, notifying them that they must make good all their promises of furnishing attractive bills, and advising them that his office has knowledge of the general custom of making substitutions at the last minute. The warning followed a complaint of Arthur E. Burrows, of Burrows, Travis and Co., that his name had been submitted to a committee as part of a club bill by Shea & Shea, agents, at 112 West 38th Street, although he (Burrows) was never notified of the engagement. The com- plainant averred that the agents had no intention of playing him and submitted his name only to make the program look attractive. The commissioner dismissed the com- plaint, but took occasion to say in his written decision : \"I think that the agent Shea and all other theatrical agents to whom this de- cision may come should be warned against what has become a frequent custom — that is, the use of attractive names in printed programs for entertainments which do not appear at the entertainment and where fail- ure to appear is only explained to the audi- ence when the curtain goes up. \"The agent's final copy to the committee in charge of the entertainment should be exactly what is to be performed and he should keep faith. I believe that such an offense as this, if repeated, would justify a more severe penalty than a warning.\" The complaint by Burrows was made at the instance of the Actors' Union. (8tk PARIS NOTES BT EDWARD 0. KENDREW. v©0 Paris, Dec 21. Operette has been in a bad way for some years in Paris, originally the cradle of this kind of entertainment, and, al- though there has been much talk of a re- vival of the musical comedy in the gay city, I have not seen much of it yet. At the present time there is only one original work running on these lines, and that is \"S. A. R.\" (\"Her Royal Highness\"), founded on the comedy of \"Prince Con- sort,\" at the Bouffes Parisians, the score of which is by Ivan Caryll. This is a very pretty production, and from the business light music is still appreciated here. The operetta \"Vera Violetta,\" imported by Marinelli from Vienna, will shortly make place for a revue at the Olympia, now in rehearsing. Martyns, the stage manager, by the way, has left this hall and his functions are taken over by Jas. Price, formerly of the Price troupe of knockabouts. O Hana San finishes on the 31st and will go to the Vienna Apollo. Big business is expected for Christmas and New Year at all the Parisian resorts, for which occasion prices will be raised. At the Folies Bergfere, Olympia, Casino, Apollo and Moulin Rouge they will be al- most doubled for the evening perform- ances. The Alhambra was leased out, with a complete show, a few days ago to a com- mittee who organized a gala in aid of poor inventors, it being argued that there is an industrial crisis throughout the country, due to the lack of protection af- forded to inventions. Last week the or- ganizers had fixed the seats at such a figure that very few booked, then five days before the show they came down to just double the ordinary prices, after- wards a little lower, and finally when the doors opened tickets were sold at the usual rates of the theatre, with a result that the house was crowded by a mixed audience that had paid all different amounts for admission to the same priced seats. The winter revue \"Annec en TAir\" nt the Apollo, announced for the 18th, does not get a public show till the 21st. A good company is engaged for the opening, including Mmes. Mealey, Paulette Darty, Yonne Yma, Mary Hett, Pomponette, Nita Rolla, Fanny de Tender, Messrs. Frey, Tibard, Portal Strit and Little Canty, whom they have already baptized here \"the other Little Tich.\" Little Ganty is booked for South Africa after this revue, and he then goes to America on the Keith & Proctor Circuit, booked through Paul Schutz. Norman French is in Paris, on his way to Moscow, Russia, where he opens for two months on Jan. 1. I hear a rumor that the Moulin Rouge will change hands before long — I should say, change managers, for the man who lias been supplying the money for this hall will probably continue to finance the new enterprise. M. Bruette is spoken of as the probable successor of Mr. Aumont. Word comes from Lyons that Charley Williams, who has been boxing at the Cirque Rothe, in that city, with Sam Mc- Vey, Kid Davis, Dick Green, F. Drum- mond and a number of \"music hall box- ers,\" will remain there to open a special school in the art of self-defense. This kind of \"attraction\" has been imported into Italy by Mr. Freiman, of Warner's Agency, for he has just sent six boxers for the Politeama, Genoa. He also booked the CKabe Japanese troupe for this same opera-circus. Wrestling matches now form the fea- ture at the Lyons Oasino-Kursaal, man- aged by Mr. Ed Rasimi, who also owns the Scale and the Eldorado in that city. The Tschinn-Maa Chinese troupe, Street, the Brothers Durval, A. Cabaret and his dogs, Sheldon, the illusionist (from the London Empire), and the Troquays, gym- nasts (from the Berlin Apollo), were at this hall last week. Romain Noiset, who worked the circle in the circle act at the Alhambra some years ago, has a new trick which he is trying to place here. It is the Flying Motor Cycle. The cyclist appears on a platform which gradually revolves, worked by an electric motor. At a given moment the platform folds automatically into the form of Id wings which project the motor cycle and rider into the air. At the same time the cyclist works a fan, which enables him to remain, as a flying machine, in the air for a couple of minutes. During this time the platform returns to its former shape, so that the cyclist can again return to it. The Bobino Music Hall and the Gaits Rochechouart, two small caf6 concerts in the exterior parts of Paris, have both produced revues this week which occupy the whole evening's program. That at the former establishment, managed by Mr. Richain, which was produced on the 18th, is particularly clever. There is a troupe of dancers called the Eight Little Cherries, but they have every appearance of being French. The Gala to be given at the Moulin Rouge Sunday night under the auspices of the Paris \"Journal\" in aid of the home for aged performers, promises to be par- ticularly brilliant. A great draw will be three comic singers, Vilbert, Claudius and Dranem (the latter president of the Union of Lyrical Artistes) in a scene from Mo- liere's \"Misanthrope.\" The Manchester Rabies, a dozen English girls of about 15 years, playing in the revue every evening, will likewise lend their services. I hear that special precautions are be- ing taken at the Olympia to protect artists' property, several articles having recently disappeared from the dressing rooms. One of the Tiller girls is moan- ing over the loss of a $\">0 kimono, for which she will be held responsible, while another artist is minus a $40 mufT. . 10 VARIETY RENTERS HAVE NEW SCHEME TO OPPOSE MANUFACTURERS To Deal With Domestic Makers Located In Canada as Well as Unlicensed Foreigners. A certain coterie of American renters, memben of the Film Service Association are making plans to handle films made dj independent American producers, who will Jocete in Canada as well as foreign manufacturers who remain outside the new combination. There are said to be at least forty renters in this country who have pledged themselves to the movement. The leaders of the coterie declare that they have discovered a projecting machine which does not in any way infringe upon the Edison or Btograph patents (Warwick Camera patent and the loop and shutter patents of the piograph) and is at least eighty-five per cent, as effective. These forty renters, according to their present plan, will form an immense cor- poration with big capitalization. The carrying out of these plans, of course, is dependent upon the attitude taken by the manufacturers when they meet the renters in New York, Jan. 9. None of the New York manufacturers were acquainted with these facts, but they were inclined to regard the claim of the discovery of a new projecting machine lightly. Lawyers for the Edison and Biograph companies made a minute search of the patent office at Washington and reported to their principals that they had the moving picture business tied up and sealed. PICTURE SHOWS STILL RUNNING. Despite the interference of Mayor McClellan with the moving picture show- men of New York, deemed by many to be utterly unwarranted, the places in the large majority are still running under a court order restraining the police from dosing them up, pending a decision by Justices Blackmar and Gaynor in Brook- lyn. Those who listened to an argument be- fore Judge Blackmar on Tuesday came away reasonably satisfied from his atti- tude that he would not permit the whole- sale closing. On Christmas eve Mayor McCellan or- dered all picture places in Greater New York operating under a common show license, about 600, to close their doors. This of course did not affect the Man- hattan, 14th Street, Unique, Dewey, Gotham, Star and half a dozen other houses which held a theatrical license. The general license costs $600 and the common $26 yearly. They ran Christmas day, although the newspaper reports of the closing kept many people away, due to their misunderstanding of the situation. They remained dark Thursday and Friday. On Saturday afternoon lawyers for the Exhibitors' Association secured restrain- ing orders which prevented the police from interfering with the shows of mem- bers, and they have been doing business since. At the hearing Tuesday Justice Black- mar asked Assistant Corporation Counsel Crowell, who appeared for the city: \"As a matter of fact there was no cause for the revocation of license in a great number of cases, was there ? Of course the Mayor does not have to wait for an accident to begin, a reform What I am interested, in here is whether the Mayor received enough evidence to make an omnibus revocation. He might have found that many violated the law but it was not just to revoke 600 licenses for the offense of 200.\" Mr. Bamberger, who appeared for the exhibitors, conceded that the Mayor had a right to revoke the . common show li- censes without a hearing, but contended that he must have good cause. He said that the violation of the law by one show house did not warrant the closing down of all by the Mayor. Mr. Bamberger said that one of the showmen for whom he appeared had ex- pended $100,000 in the building of his place. He declared that it was perfectly safe, and yet the Mayor withdrew the license. Mr. Crowell said that the Mayor \"had been very much taken\" with the at- titude of the Exhibitors' Association toward those who violated the law. PLAN PREPARATORY MEETING. Chicago, Dec. 30. The film renters of Chicago have started a movement to collect all the association members in New York for a meeting pre- paratory to the convention, scheduled for January 0. They propose to get together and talk things over before they enter the convention room. The plan has met with general favor and will probably be fol- lowed. It is expected that about fifteen new renters will be taken into the association at the convention, mostly independents now made eligible by the merging of in- terests between the Biograph and Edison factions. CHANGE RELEASE DAYS. The American Mutoscope and Biograph Company announced this week that its re- lease days beginning next week will be changed from Tuesdays and Fridays to Mondays and Thursdays. This comes as a result of the new com- bination. A rearrangement of all release days has been made, so that the production of all the licenses shall be evenly distribu- ted through the week. Under the new scheme about the same number of feet of new material will be released each day of the week. AWAITING DECISION. Montreal, Can., Dec. 30. The case of the authorities against the moving picture show managers in the matter of opening Sundays is expected to-morrow. It has been before the courts for ten days or more. No one ventures to forecast the result. This week the regular theatre man- agers went into court in an effort to test their rights as to opening their houses on the seventh day. Evidence was heard on both sides, and it is likely that a rul- ing will be handed down week after next. The theatrical managers take the position that if the moving picture men can run as they have been doing, they should be granted the same privilege. WAR CLOUDS IN CHICAGO. Chicago, Dec. 30. Two local newspapers, taking their cue from recent New York happenings, have gone a-cruscding against the local moving picture shows. From those on the inside it is said that the attack is inspired by one A. S. Trude, attorney for one of the newspapers in question in the interests of local vaudeville theatres. E. C. Kohl, of Kohl & Castle, is likewise said to be interested in one of the crusading news- papers, and has added the weight of his influence to the attack. The Chicago American will take side with the oppressed picture men and n lively editorial war is in prospect. So far the attack has had no effect on business in the moving pictuic houses. NO TROUBLE IN PHILADELPHIA. Philadelphia, Dec. 30. There has been no uneasiness among the picture show proprietors on account of the trouble in New York, and Director of Public Safety Clay has declared there will be no other action than usual against any of the places. The shows are watched here, and if objectionable .pictures are shown they will be reported and the li- cense taken away.' No such complaint has been made yet. State Factory Inspector Delaney has declared he will submit before the next Legislature two bills, one giving the de- partment increased power over theatres and another placing all moving picture houses under his and his deputies' con- trol. Director Clay objects to this, accept- ing it as a reflection upon the methods employed by the city in directing the small theatres, and he intends to tight the bills. Rigid inspection is made here by the Fire Marshal, who personally inspects every place of amusement regularly. Coun- cils passed a bill last February giving the Police Department full control of the the- atres. A total of 184 picture theatres were recently inspected and the depart- ment will recommend that the 1009 li- censes be issued. Only minor defects were found. Irving B. Lee has written a new sketch called 'The Match That Went Out\" for Francis Mauer. The cast includes three characters. BIG ONE FOR NEWARK. Newark, N. J., Dec. 30. Newark is to have a big modern moving picture theatre. William Scheerer, presi- dent of the National Union Bank, has just announced that he will finance the building of a $25,000 house on Market Street. It will have a seating capacity of 1,000. A FRENCH SAMPLE. Paris, Dec. 21. The Path6 people have recently release I a long film (and are now showing it them- selves at the family resort run by them in the building of the Cirque d'Hiver, or Winter Circus), which is the acme of disgusting realism. A well-known Bel- gian actor, Henry Krauss, was engaged for the posing in the principal role of the following drama: A man is warned by his doctor that his heart is weak, but the invalid pays little heed. One evening, as the story runs, he has a suspicion that his wife is deceiving him, and on returning home from a bail he collapses from heart failure. The wife, aghast, places the supposed corpse in an arm chair, covering the face with a hand- kerchief. During the terrible ordeal her lover enters, and they kiss before the dead body of the husband. But he is not dead, and so witnesses the whole scene. The wife begs the lover to remain with the corpse while she attends to some do- mestic duties occasioned by the death of her husband. The husband, still suffering from the stroke, musters up all his force, with a superhuman effort ably portrayed by the actor, and while the lover is reading a journal he steals behind him, grasps him by the throat and strangles him. He then places the body in the arm chair and takes the lover's place. The wife enters and, going up to the spot where she had left her lover sitting, kisses the man. When she finds it is her husband the shock is terrific. The husband then seizes her and, dragging her to the side of the dead body, strangles her and crushes the two faces one against the other in his rage. How about this for a family cinfi- hallT We are having a series of blood- curdlers here. MORE GRIM FILMS. Paris, Dec. 21. The Steinheil murder case forms the subject of a film recently released by Ra- leigh & Robert, of the Continental War- wick Trading Co. \"The bank robbers\" and adventures of Nick Carter are repro- duced by the Eclair firm. The Itala are selling sensational fake stories through- out Europe. Truly, the moving picture industry is losing its good reputation as a popular educator. MOVING PICTURES PREACHED SERMON. While all this aimless talk anent the immorality of moving picture exhibitions is going on, it is perhaps not amiss to re- cite the circumstances of a Biograph pro- duction being the main attraction of a Christmas entertainment given in the Grand Central Palace under the auspices of the Salvation Army. The subject dealt with poverty in New York and the Army officials made special request to the biograph company for the use of the reel, saying that it was a revelation in picture production and point- ed a wholesome moral. The film was specially printed for the occasion. Nellie Florede replaced Adcle Oswold in the prima donna part at the Olympic Music Hall, Chicago, this week, Miss Oswold retiring. VARIETY 11 IMPORTANT CIRCUS MEN TO MEET AND ARRANGE ROUTES Rumor Has It That the Ringling, Buffalo Bill and Wallace Interests Will Be Represented. The Latter May Enter Combine. ARTISTS' FORUM Chicago, Deo. 30. Authentic information is at hand that pretty much all the important circus mag- nates in America will come together in this city about Jan. 10, at the Windsor- Clifton in a general meeting to go over routings for next season and close im- portant deals now pending. Ben Wallace will attend and it is the general opinion that he will be taken into the \"combination.\" That a meeting of some sort will be held is understood, but the conferees are not certain. The best information obtainable names The Ringlings, Major Gordon W. Lillie, Walter Main, Martin Downs, and Ed. C. Knupp and Al Stuart. This has of course led to a good deal of conjecture. One of the conferees said this week that \"something was coming off,\" the meaning of which was accepted as indicating that a movement was on to bring about a combination of interests, including the Hagenbeck-Wallace outfit and the others in the conference. There are no facts obtainable to support this. John and Otto Ringling have been in Chi- cago all this week. Among circus people here it is accepted as a fact that the rumored Sells-Floto- Rhoda Royal-Miller deal is all off, if it ever had any real foundation. Variety's first surmise that the whole Gates-Miller story was a \"pipe\" by Billy Thompson of the Miller press department is the ac- cepted version. \"ioi RANCH\" CLOSES. Miller Brothers' \"101 Ranch\" closed Saturday night in Mexico City and went directly to winter quarters in Bliss, Okla. It was in the Latin-American Republic a little over two weeks. Business started well, but fell off during the middle of the week in Mexico City. Capacity audiences were the rule during the Thursday, Satur- day and Sunday shows, but for the rest of the week the attendance was almost nothing. The outfit was to have played several more stands before leaving Mexico, but af- ter the advance agent had looked them over and reported upon conditions, it was decided to cancel the engagement in the capital. NORRIS & ROWS GOING OUT. Chicago, Dec. 30. The Norris <fc Rowe Circus, a Pacific Coast organization, which was recently in financial difficulties, will go out again next season, with H. S'. Norris as general manager. The equipment will be in- creased from twenty-eight to thirty-six cars. The Donaldson people, printers, of Louisville, Ky., who were reported to be heavy creditors of the show the season just past, will be interested in the tour. The show will open as usual at Santa Cruz, March 5, moving thence as far east a3 Indiana, if present plans are > not changed. Bob Clemons, now manager of the Trocadero (Eastern Burlesque Wheel) will be assistant manager. SHOWS NEW YORK-CHICAGO JUMP. According to contracts already closed the Buffalo Bill Wild West will jump di- rectly from Madison Square Garden to Chicago at the end of its New York en- gagement. After that it will play in terri- tory west of the Windy City. ANOTHER VERSION. Chicago, Dec. 30. Denials and assertions continue to pile up around the report that John W. Gates is about to back an independent circus. The newest light to be thrown on the matter comes in the shape of a seem- ingly authentic report that Gates' whole connection with the circus business is the fact that while in Texas recently he signed a lease on certain properties be- longing to the Miller Brothers at Bliss, Okla. Traces of oil have been found on \"Ranch 101\" there, and Gates has taken leases on these lands with the idea of developing their supposed resources. So much for the Miller Brothers' connection. There remains only the talk of a deal with the Sells-Floto peoplo which has been admitted as pending by H. H. Tammen. \"JOHNNY\" MAY BUY SHOW. Friends of \"Gov.\" Robinson and his old- est son, Johnny, are trying to effect an ar- rangement whereby the younger member of the family will purchase the property under some arrangement and run it himself. The matter has been broached to both parties and it is said that negotiations are already well under way. Johnny was not with the show last season, and since the \"Governor's\" marriage, father and son have been almost entirely estranged. Friends of the family hope that by the son taking over the circus the worry of attend- ing to details will be lifted from the shoul- ders of the \"Governor,\" who is an invalid, and at the same time the family disagree- ment may be remedied.

Iff Editor Variety: Now then let us say a few words for England, so badly thought of by R, G. Knowles. For the show business there is no country like it under the sun. Where, in this country, could you play six months in one house? Where could you play six months in one town or city, two and three halls nightly, and different ones every weekt ' Where, in this country, could you have from ten to twenty musicians (I mean musicians), play your music the first per- formance without ever seeing either you or the music before? (cue music). Where, in this country, could you go from the finest and largest theatre or music hall, to, I might say, the smallest, or vice versa, the same week or any other week, without fear of cancellation ? Where, in this country, could you walk from the stage to the auditorium, or vice versa, to have a pleasant chat with the different managers (and gentlemen they are), while the show was going on? As for the advertising of the artists that come from the other side, it is only done after he or she has made a tremend- ous hit. It is too late for any one to even surmise that they are for the press comments (I mean the ones not paid for). As far as billing is concerned, we have a different method of billing. How do they bill Mrs. Langtry? Even at her own theatre, I thought she was the piano player, when I read the play bills. We were five years in England, and we would be there now, not for five years, but for life, if the climate agreed with us. O'Brien & Buckley. Detroit, Mich., Dec. 26. Editor Variety: We were very much surprised to read in the last issue of Vabiett of a well- known team of old-timers contradicting the Cleveland (Ohio) representative of Vabiett as to Conroy, LeMaire & Co. be- ing the \"laughing hit\" of the bill at Keith's Theatre, Cleveland. We will admit that the old-timers made them laugh \"some,\" but we made them laugh \"some more.\" Conroy, LeMaire d Co. ROBBINS GETTING READY. Preliminary work has already started in the winter quarters of the Frank A. Kobbins outfit in Jersey City (Communi- • paw Avenue) for next sea3on. The equip- ment is being repainted ind repaired. Robbins will again go ov on the rails with a show of ten cars r so. The Two Plamondon*, the ladder act. have signed with the I Tagenbeck- Wallace Circus for next season. Providence, R. I., Dec. 26. Editor Variety: I am sending you enclosed a couple of newspaper clipping which tell their own story. The sextet of male dancers, de- scribed as \"The Six American Dancers,\" who played recently at the Theatre Comique, in Lynn, are Providence fellows who have knocked around the streets and appeared at amateur nights at burlesque houses. They formerly called themselves the Imperial Dancers. I called up the manager of the Theatre Comique in Lynn by telephone to ascertain why the act was thus advertised, and he acknowledged to to me that he knew there was another act of the same name but that he booked this act through a Boston branch office and the contracts read \"The Six American Dancers.\" It seemed to me that any booking ofTVe must have known, in view of the prominence pained by the original Six American Dancers in the past year and a half, that this sextet could not have been the Six American Dancers, and it seems to me like a de- liberate attempt to pirate the original a«i and take advantage of their brains and efforts, especially in view of the great success made by the originals in I^ynn only a few weeks ago. I will thank ye* to return to me the clippings' enclosed. Any prominence which you may give the affair in your paper will be appreciated by the Six American Dancers as well ae by me. Chat. Lovenberg. TIN PAN ALLEY JINGLES. By WILLIAM JEROME. Well, it wasn't such a bad Christmas after all — nearly all the publishers found their stockings filled with hits. Williams and Van Alstyne have a new one entitled \"I Used to Be Afraid to Go Home in the Dark\"— I'm afraid it's a hit. Long hair never makes a song writer. The Sutherland brothers were popular Id Tin Pan circles. S. R. Henry and his £arn Dance are both very popular. I wonder what kind of statements Santa Clau« will bring this, year. There's many a slip between the pub- lisher and the printer that the song writer knows nothing about. Jules Von Tilzer made his New York apeparance in Green point last week. He will make his Brooklyn apearance in Mon- treal some time next month. His opening song, \"Once Upon a Time There Was An Honest Publisher,\" was a big hit. At last the sun is shining for Charles Horwitz. It's a boy, weighs nine pounds — not English money. Charlie always did write great lyrics. Every song writer has his Francis, Day & Hunter. Cheer Up Mary Note. — Kendis and Paley still \"keep on smiling\" at Remicks. Lullahys and dead marches are as popu- lar as ever in Philadelphia. Bert Cooper returned from Chicago. He says there is no truth in the report that Siegel and Cooper will appear at Hammer- stein's. Detroit is the original two-step city. Max Silver played the part of the brave fireman at the burning of Fred Mills' song factory. Eddie Madden and Ben Jerome are dis- playing a fine line of goods at the Casino. Popular song writers are not always ]ni|iul:ir. 12 VARIETY NEW ACTS NEXT WEEK Initial Presentation, First Appearance or Reappearance in or Around New York City. Eva Tanguay, Fifth Avenue.

Opening the intermission at Hammer- stein's is not an inviting spot for knock- about acrobatic act, let alone a single singing turn. That is where they have Josephine Davis this week and under the adverse conditions she is doing remark- ably well. Miss Davis sings only, she moves about the stage while singing and takes a few graceful steps, but they can hardly be classed under the head of danc- ing. The selections aro all of the tuneful order. There were four in all, one only Wing away from the straight. In this number Miss Davis shows how a German and a Hebrew maid say \"good-bye\" to their sweethearts. It is a first rate novelty and were the singer doing character work it would be of value to her. A whistle number was nicely done and hit a re- sponsive chord in the audience. \"You'll Have to Sing an Irish Tune\" was the opener and made a good introduction, al- though Miss Davis is more suited to the straight light numbers. The singer makes no costume changes. She looked pretty and demure in a neat ankle-length frock, but a change o - two would not be amiss. Altogether she has put together a light, pleasing specialty which will do very nicely. Dash. Josephine Branta. Songs. 14 Mins.; One. Fifth Avenue. Miss Branta, said to be the 'daughter of a prominent New York newspaper man, has a simple little character singing turn with much to recommend it. The songs, four in number, are all new and the singer has plenty of charm, although her voice is light in volume. It seems that she has made a poor arrangement of her selec- tions. The first song, a novelty number with an extremely catchy lyric would make a much better closing number than the one now in use, which might better be placed to open. A better costume scheme could also be devised. The singer appears in a pretty soubrette frock for the open- ing. Her second change is effected by putting a loose dress over this. A boy's coat goes over all for the third number, and the opening dress is again used for the •finale. The first song has to do with a girl who wore \"clockings on her stockings.\" The clocking are glar- ing apparent, and remain much in evidence during the rest of the act. This is not as it should be. Nevertheless, the turn was received with a good deal of enthusi- asm at the Fifth Avenue. It was first seen in New York this week. Rush. William Rock and Maude Fulton. \"The Apache Dance.\" 7 Mins.; Full Stage (Special Set). Fifth Avenue. Rock and Fulton are the latest to join the Apache ranks. Setting aside all argu- ment as to the desirability of the num- ber for vaudeville, it must be confessed that the musical comedy pair have made a most ambitious attempt to portray a dramatic incident! with elaborate attention to its scenic setting and atmosphere. As a \"production\" the dance is a splendid ef- fort. The cabaret is a cellar scene, en- trance being effected by a descending flight of stone steps back centre. At the open- ing the place is filled with a crowd of Parisian desperadoes and their women companions in their picturesque garb. Mr. Rock, dressed in the same red and black costume, enters in search of his girl. After scrutinizing each of the women he sits aside at a table. A waiter approaches. A search of the Apache's pockets fails to bring forth the wherewithal, and he waives the waiter away. One of the women habitues seeks to win his regard, but he roughly repulses her. Then Miss Fulton appears. The girl goes immedi- ately to her master and, giving him money, enters into pantomimic conversa- tion. He orders drinks. She does not want to drink, but he forces her and, after a quarrel, the dance begins, a par- ticularly brutal performance in its thinly veiled significance. At the finish the man throws his companion aside and goes to the woman who had previously sought his attention. As he is about to embrace her the girl of the dance creeps up behind, plunges a knife between his shoulders and staggers out. Monday night was the first performance. The score or more of peoplo who appear as supernumeraries acted rather ill at ease, sitting awkwardly dur- ing the whole performance. They should be trained to act more naturally, although any action on their part is necessarily handicapped by the fact that the whole proceedings are done without a spoken word. The audience was impressed. Ruth. Hymack. Lightning Change Novelty. xa Mine.; Full Stage (Special Interior). Orpheum. It is about a year since Hymack first showed his lightning change specialty in New York, following at that time a copy act which was put on with the idea of taking the edge off the original, which it failed to do* Hymaek'a present offering differs from his former one only in the presentation. Hymack impersonates a man about town. At his club on this particular day a discussion on hypnotism bad waxed rather hot. Hymack, -being on the side of the skeptie, scoffed at the stories of the mysterious psychic power. When he reaches his quarters he baa a telephone call from a club mate offering to bet him ten pounds that at nine o'clock he will go through various illuminating experiences. The bet is quickly taken, and at the hour of nine Hymack begins to act queerly. This gives him the op- portunity of going through the various changes shown in his former offering. The changing of the gloves, handkerchiefs, cuffs, boutonnlers are all accomplished with lightning-like rapidity. During the changes) he keeps up a constant talk, re- peating paasages, getting them turned and twisted in every possible manner. This, aa well as the fact that he would entertain his man, Saunders, while under the spell, waa also a part of the wager. The finale is a complete change of cos- tume. It is made with remarkable quick- ness. The act aa a whole is an improve- ment over the old offering. Doss. Charles Nichols and Co. \"Western Style.\" 15 Mine.; Full Stage. London Theatre, \"Champagne Girls.\" Charles Nichols comes forward again in his old dope-fiend character around which the sketch, \"Western Style\" has been built. The character is well enough done, but the vehicle is utter nonsense. Dopy Dan from Cheyenne (Nichols) visits an old side partner now living in the East (Billy Wild). They have a servant girl (Marie Fisher), whom they abuse, but whose fortune they are plotting to keep. For Dan's visit they all dress in western costume, making up the girl as an In- dian girl, and the friend and his wife (Marie Croix) as cowboy and cowgirl. There is much shooting of pistols and foolish business, and finally Dan discov- ers the plot against the girl. This leads to a climax, meant to be dramatic, but in reality broad farce. The sketch is not worth Nichols' consideration for a min- ute. Rush. Jock McKay. Songs. 14 Mins.; One. Colonial Jock McKay (pronounced McKy— to rhyme with sky) is a newcomer among us and it is perhaps as well to deal as lightly as possible with his failings. McKay haa a lot to learn about Amer- ican audiences. Some of his songs have a touch of the \"blue\" in them, but some of his gestures are a fine, startling, royal purple. The incidental business that went with his second song made the au- dience gasp for breath. That sort of mat- ter may do over in McKay's native land, but not for the Colonial audience, or any other intelligent gathering over here. It's a pity, too, because McKay has real humor. Some of the talk in the latter half of his turn was highly diverting. A lot of it had to do with the \"closeness\" i the Scot and it was fine, spontaneous, clean comedy. It would have gone much better had not the \"blue\" stuff preceded. McKay had queered his own game by that time. As an unctuous comedian we have use for him over here, but as a dis- seminator of raw business and lyrics, we can well spar> him to England. It's all up to Mr. McK y. He can make or break himself accordingly as he chooses his style of work. Aside from which dissertation, however, it might be permissible to sug- gcHt that the red nose makeup could go. \"The Devil and Tom Walker.\" as Mins.; Full Stage (Special Set). iasth Street John P. Hymer, besides being featured in \"The Devil and Tom Walker,\" is re- sponsible for writing and staging the piece. To Mr. Hymer must go the credit for giving vaudeville the best comedy novelty sketch that it has seen in many n- day. A good comedy act or a good nov- elty act at this stage of vaudeville ia worth noticing. When they both come to- gether it is a remarkable circumstance. That's just how good the new piece of Hymer's is. The special set shows % scene in Hades in the throne room of the Devil. Through a chute on one side of the stage Tom Walker (John B. Hymer) in blackface is shot into the domain of Hia Satanic Majesty. The Devil, upon hear- ing that there are two or three people impersonating him upon Broadway, de- cides that it is necessary for him to make a trip to the Gay White Way to sup- press his impersonators. It is necessary during his absence to have someone upon the throne entirely unfamiliar with the- workings of the lower regions take hi* place. The choice falls to Tom Walker. When the power which goes with the job- begins to dawn upon Walker the fun be- gins. There is a wireless system over which a message indicating each death that occurs on earth is flashed, and when the departing one is assigned to Hell a gong rings. Walker sits expectant, await- ing the news of the death of one Bilf Williams, a white man from hia town,, who has treated the darky badly in hi* day. When the news of his death and his. assignment to the lower regions is made known to Walker, he prepares a red hot. reception for his ancient enemy, who in due time \"gets him\" with interest. In the same way several others are brought before Walker, and with each there goes- a quantity of first-rate fun. When the Salome dancer is brought before the tem- porary King and wishes to perform her wiggles, The King only turns his head and remarks that they can't stand for that dance in Hell. To the dancer's assertion* that they stood for it on Broadway he answers: \"They stand for a lot of thinga on Broadway that don't go down here.\" Walker also finds that there is a chance to graft in Hell, and the Devil returns to find that Walker is allowing anybody that has two bits or more to depart in peace. The Devil returns with a society woman as his special prey, and in a scene with the woman the real Devil (David Walters) does a first-rate bit of acting. Six girls are employed besides Miss Elsie Kent, who is the favorite of the Devil. The favorite induces Walker to allow her to escape to the moon. Walker decides to go with her. The pair make their escape in an airship, which is the finale. The piece shows care and attention throughout. It has been nicely staged, and the girls, who sing and dance a little, have been well trained. There is a first- rate vein of comedy running throughout, varied by just about enough seriousness to make it effective. As the old colored man, John Hymer is excellent. He is al- ways funny, always has his character well in hand and never gets away from the ensemble for a second. David Wal- ters, a real actor, gives a capital perform- ance as the Devil. Dash. VARIETY 13 Annette Kelkrmann. \"On the Beech et Boulogne.\" is Mine.; Full Stage. Fifth Avenue. Annette Kellermann's new act consists of a very neet sketch arrangement which serves to introduce her various specialties smoothly and without interfering with the rapid running off of her exhibition. The stage setting remains much the same as before,"
