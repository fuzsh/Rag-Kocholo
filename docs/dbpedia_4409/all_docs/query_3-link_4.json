        "text": "Percy the Small Green Saddle Tank Engine (Percy) is a green saddle tank engine who was brought to Sodor to help run the railway during the big engines' strike. He is one of the youngest engines on the North Western Railway and is quite cheeky, often getting himself into trouble with his attempts to play tricks on the other engines. Percy's favourite/favorite job is to deliver the mail, and he works on Thomas' Branch Line as a goods engine.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nPercy is a cheeky but kind engine. He normally behaves well, yet he also gets himself in trouble by jumping into situations without adequately thinking them through first. He loves teasing other engines, especially bigger ones such as Gordon and James, but is always brought down to earth in due course by anyone who gives him the moral to learn, especially Sir Topham Hatt/the Fat Controller. He can also be somewhat timid.\n\nAs the television series has progressed, Percy has been dumbed-down in order to teach viewers difficult words: he would say \"dingy-fried\" whereas anyone else would say \"dignified\", \"demonstration\" into \"dimer-station\", \"railway inspector\" into \"railway inspectacles\", etc.\n\nPercy is incredibly accident-prone and has many accidents, sometimes due to his own silliness or his tricks backfiring. He holds the dubious record of the most accidents in one series - five; all of which happened in the second series - crashing into some buffers, falling into the sea, being pushed onto a brake van, colliding with a cart of lime and being hit by a falling crate of treacle. So far, his silliest accident yet was in the sixth series, when he slipped on oily rails and crashed through the chocolate factory and emerged covered in chocolate. Despite this, he always tries to do his best, learn from his mistakes and get his jobs done, a loyalty which Sir Topham Hatt has praised him for on many occasions.\n\nAlthough their friendship has been turbulent at times, Thomas is generally portrayed as Percy's best friend and is also good friends with Toby as well. While he has a small rivalry with Harold, stemming from their race, they are always willing to help each other when in trouble.\n\nPercy can also be seen as an easy target for teasing by the big engines, especially whenever he has an accident or when he is afraid of something. He also has held a grudge from them about their tricking him into misinterpreting a signal, but silenced this with some help from Duck. This shows that, when nonsense goes too far, Percy will not stand for it and seek help to settle the matter for good, even if he faces a reprimanding from Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller for it.\n\nWhy He Rocks[]\n\nHe is among a fan favourite/favorite of the main cast, and the franchise altogether.\n\nHis naive but positive personality is what makes Percy a likable engine.\n\nHe was given his own name by the Fat Controller/Sir Topham Hatt.\n\nHis friendship with Thomas.\n\nHe along with Toby started the Ffarquhar trio, Thomas, Percy (him), and Toby.\n\nHis green color resembles him well.\n\nHis episodes where he and James get the lead role together make him and James a very good duo, like how Ren and Stimpy are a great duo together.\n\nHis redesign in the \"Meet the Steam Team\" series videos looks really wonderful to him.\n\nHe tends to be kind, caring, and curious.\n\nHas the best crashes he could perform in the series much to the fact he is accident prone.\n\nWithout him, the railway would never be the same.\n\nBad Qualities[]\n\nLost his original personality to flanderization during Seasons 15-16 and the infamous \"Day of the Diesels\" as he was turned to a idiot, dimwit and a crybaby who obsesses over Thomas' attention and made a big deal over Thomas befriending Belle and Flynn in said special, yes Thomas may have ignored Percy, but that gives Percy no reason to behave like that. \"Percy and the Monster of Brendam\", one of his worst episodes, made him painfully dumb where he was asking to be scared by some so called \"monster of brendam\". His downfall was short lived like the Gene Deitch era of Tom and Jerry from 1961-1962.\n\nThe infamous episode where Percy's attempts at befriending animals because he wants to play whilst he might have work to do on the railway would be something very against his character as Percy usually likes animals, but he would never obsess over attention to animals.\n\nTrivia[]"
