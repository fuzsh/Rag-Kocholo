        "text": "Plot Summary\n\nAfter beating Gordon the Big Engine in a race to Vicarstown Station, Thomas the Tank Engine is introduced to Gordon's brother, The Flying Scotsman (Rufus Jones), who is taking part in The Great Railway Show on the Mainland, encouraging Thomas to try and take part as well. Though every engine on Sodor wants to take part, Sir Topham Hatt (Keith Wickham) has not made up his mind yet, and Thomas fears he won't be picked to go to the competition. After getting an idea to be streamlined for the competition, he passes his idea on to Sir Topham Hatt, who chooses Gordon to be streamlined instead of him.\n\nAt Brendam Docks, Thomas has a run-in with several of the competitors for The Great Railway Show (Teresa Gallagher, David Bedella & Rob Rackstraw) when their rail ferry docks there by mistake, and as a result, one of them is left behind. The engine, a beautifully-painted one from India named Ashima (Tina Desai), makes a bad first impression on Thomas after almost making him fall off the dock, but upon getting another idea regarding her paintwork from Annie and Clarabel, he heads to the Steamworks to be repainted, but is forced to reveal his new idea to Sir Topham Hatt, who selects James and Emily to be repainted instead. Running into Ashima again after learning she took Annie and Clarabel down his branch line, Thomas is convinced by her to just be himself and take part in the shunting challenge at The Great Railway Show since he is so good at shunting.\n\nHowever, thanks to a trick by Diesel involving Den, Dart, and Paxton, Thomas suffers an accident with Norman at Knapford Junction, and has to be left behind to have his front end mended while Percy takes his place. In the end, Thomas is able to go, despite not being fully repaired when he discovers that Gordon left without his safety valve being properly installed while he was being streamlined, which means his boiler could overheat at high speeds.\n\nAt The Great Railway Show, Henry loses the strength competition, James and Emily lose the Best Decorated Engine award to Ashima's fellow engine from India, Rajiv, and due to not waiting to have his safety valve installed, Gordon's boiler explodes and he loses the race. Thomas takes Percy's place in the shunting competition, but sacrifices his chances to win when he sees Ashima's track blocked by a derailed flatbed and switches tracks with her so he hits the flatbed instead. However, the judges decide to award Thomas the win alongside Ashima for his excellent sportsmanship. Sir Topham Hatt and the other Sodor engines are very proud of Thomas.\n\nWith The Great Railway Show over, Thomas invites Ashima to come back to Sodor to catch her ferry home to India there, allowing her to spend some more time with her new friends while Diesel, stuck in a crate, sails away on a ship leaving Sodor.\n\nMusical Numbers\n\n\"Will You Won't You\" - Full company\n\n\"Streamlining\" - Thomas, Annie and Clarabel\n\n\"I'm Full Of Surprises\" - Diesel\n\n\"You Can Only Be You\" - Thomas and Ashima\n\n\"The Shooting Star Is Coming Through\" - Gordon\n\n\"Be Who You Are, And Go Far\" - Thomas, Ashima, Philip, Gordon, Emily, James, Percy and Henry\n\n\"He's Full Of Surprises\" - Ian McCue, Oliver Davis, Andrew Brenner and David Stoten"
