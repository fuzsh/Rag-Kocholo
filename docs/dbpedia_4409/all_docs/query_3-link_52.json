        "text": "In this provocative and illuminating book, Patrick McGee looks at the ways in which certain texts resist the dominant cultural assumptions that condition their writing and reception. Challenging received notions of aesthetic and social value, he offers readings of modernist, postmodernist, and postcolonial works which suggest forms of relationship disruptive of social systems and institutional hierarchies.\n\nThis abstract book includes all the abstracts of the papers presented at the 7th Annual International Conference on Literature, 9-12 June 2014, organized by the Athens Institute for Education and Research. In total there were 40 papers and 43 presenters, coming from 18 different countries (Brazil, Cameroon, China, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, UAE, USA). The conference was organized into 10 sessions that included areas such as Language Learning, Formal Linguistics and Sociolonguistics, Literary History, Language Studies, Formal Linguistics e.t.c As it is the publication policy of the Institute, the papers presented in this conference will be considered for publication in one of the books of ATINER."
