By profession he was a lawyer, but politics and military affairs engaged much of his attention and won for him great popularity in his state. General Dechert was born in Reading, Penn., August 16, 1842. At the breaking out of the war, he enlisted in the Twenty-ninth Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers and remained in service until the end of the rebellion. Politically, Gen. Dechert was a Democrat. In 1866 he was admitted to the Philadelphia bar, and two years later he was appointed Assistant District Attorney of Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1870 he was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate, and one of his legislative achievements was the enactment of a law enabling criminals to testify in their own behalf. He was nominated for Auditor General in 1880, but was defeated. In 1884 he was elected County Controller of Philadelphia, and was re-elected in 1887. In 1878 he was chosen Colonel of the Second Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard, and served as such until May 7, 1890, when he was assigned to the command of the First Brigade, which office he fulfilled to his death.\n\nGen. Dechert came of a distinguished family. His grandfather, George Robert Porter, was a lieutenant during the Revolution, and afterward served for thirty years as President Judge of the circuit composed of Berks, Lehigh, and Northampton Counties. Judge Porter had three brothers who achieved distinction in public life ' David R. Porter, Governor of Pennsylvania, from 1839 to 1845, James M. Porter of Easton, Secretary of War under President Tyler, and George B. Porter, who immigrated to the west and became Governor of Michigan.\n\nDuring the war, Gen. Dechert early made for himself a reputation for bravery. Enlisting as a private when he was scarcely nineteen years old, his services gained for him rapid promotion. Within six months he was commissioned a Lieutenant. In April, 1863, he became a Captain, and in November, 1864, he became Major, and in 1865 he was brevetted Lieutenant Colonel for 'distinguished and meritorious services.' He participated in the battles and retreats in the Shenandoah Valley under Banks, and in the disastrous Virginia campaign under Pope, in the battle of Antietam under McClellan and of Chancellorville under Hooker, at Gettysburg under Meade, and in the march to the sea under Sherman.\n\nIn politics Gen. Dechert's mind was always clear. As a result, he was several times the only man elected on his ticket, notably when he ran for the City Controllership of Philadelphia.\n\n[Source: The New York Times, May 13, 1894.
