Bower, Revolutionary War Soldier, With 2000 Descendants in This Section Lies on Briar Creek Twp. Farm\n\n3 Sources\n\nBiography\n\nGeorge (Bauer) Bower is a DAR Patriot Ancestor, A012766.\n\nGeorge (Bauer) Bower performed Patriotic Service in Pennsylvania in the American Revolution.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower (German: Georg Michael Bauer) was born at Jagsthausen on the fourteenth of October 1745; he was baptized the following day with Johann Georg Horlacher, Georg Michael Bauer, tanner Johann Jacob Schnizer, and merchant Georg Elias (the latter two of Künzelsau) serving of sponsors.\n\nHis father was a butcher.\n\nThe family migrated aboard the ship Phoenix, arriving at Philadelphia from Rotterdam via Portsmouth on 25 Sep 1751. The surname's spelling was eventually anglicized to \"Bower\".\n\nThe Bower family lived somewhere in the southern portion of Greenwich Township, Berks County, occasionally appearing in the records of neighboring Richmond Township. George Michael signed a lease with his father for land on 22 Jul 1769; he married the following month on 15 Aug 1769 at Zion Moselem Lutheran Church to Hannah Martha Hill, where his father at the time served as a church warden.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower served at least from 1777–8 in Capt. Peter Smith's company in the second battalion of the Berks County Militia, consisting of men from Greenwich Township. He took an oath of allegiance on 15 Apr 1777 before Samuel Ely.[1] Ely and Bower later appear as witnesses to the will of Frederick Kramer on 9 Mar 1786 and proved 26 Apr.\n\nHe appears consistently in the tax lists of Greenwich Township through the 1780s, also appearing there in the 1790 Census. Several other Bowers appear in these records alongside George Michael though it is currently uncertain whether they are related, the surname being a possibly common one simply meaning \"farmer\".\n\nHe arrived in Briar Creek Township around 1796, settling at an area that eventually came to be known as Evansville.\n\n“John [sic] Bower, the grandfather of George Michael Bower, was born in Germany and emigrated to America in young manhood, finally settling on a farm in Briarcreek township, where he passed the remainder of his life. He and his wife, who was a Hill, were members of the German Lutheran Church, and are buried in Briarcreek township, at the old Brick Church. They were the parents of the following children: Jacob, who married Catherine Zimmerman; Solomon, who married Mary Evans; Abraham, who married Nellie Remley; Daniel; Esther, who married Bastian Kinter; Philipena, who married David Whitmire; and George Michael.”[2]\n\n“George Michael Bower came from Saxony to America at the age of thirteen and settled in Berks county, Pa. After his marriage to a Miss Hill he removed to Columbia county, near Evansville, and bought a farm of 120 acres from a man named Desser. He was a successful farmer and became one of the prominent men of his part of the county. He was the father of the following children: Jacob, Michael, Solomon, Daniel, Philena, Catherine and Abraham.”[3]\n\nNews article\n\nGeorge Michael Bower was the subject of several articles in the 1930s using extensive research by descendant C. W. E. Bower; the following transcription is from a piece across two pages in the 26 May 1933 issue of the Berwick Enterprise:\n\nGeorge M. Bower, Revolutionary War Soldier, With 2000 Descendants in This Section Lies on Briar Creek Twp. Farm\n\nServed With Army of General George Washington. — Came to Briar Creek in 1795. — Grave in Corner of Field.\n\nA Revolutionary War soldier, George Michael Bower, who fought two years under George Washington, lies buried in a Briar Creek field, with the grave little marked. It is not entirely neglected, although the location is known to but a small part of his large number of descendants in this section. Its lonely location, in the corner of a cultivated field, is in contrast to the flowers and flags of well kept cemeteries where most of the heroes of the nation receive each Memorial Day an expression of gratitude and remembrance.\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier's grave is but a short distance from the Orangeville-Berwick highway, just beyond Briar Creek borough line and on the hill above the \"old Stone Church,\", the birthplace and shrine of Methodism. The site is upon the Fester farm.\n\nThe grave until this year had its iron standard in which flowers and a flag could be placed. This has disappeared. The stone that marked the grave is now gone. Just how or why, no one appears to know.\n\n2,000 Descendants\n\nGeorge Michael Bower, the soldier has today something like 2,000 living descendants. Berwick has hundreds of them and there are other hundreds in the Briar Creeks and Centers. Practically all of the Bowers, the Kisners, the Whitmires and members of five generations of many intermarried families are included among the descendants of the Revolutionary soldier.\n\nC. W. E. Bower, of Centre township, Berwick R. D. 3, some years ago started to compile the family history of the Revolutionary War soldier who was his great-great-grandfather. C. W. E. Bower (father of Collis Bower the former county treasurer) has accumulated a wealth of interesting data and original documents, also records of the family lineage down many of the several score of lines to the present generation.\n\nNot the least interesting of his records, is the original marriage certificate of the Revolutionary soldier setting forth that on March 22, 1750, in Maxetany Township, Berks county, Hannah Matha Hill became his bride. Old parchment deeds, records some of which go back nearly 200 years, books, receipts and interesting family papers gave him accurate facts.\n\nTo Briar Creek in 1795.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower's connection with Briar Creek dates from 1795. In that year he came from Berks county and purchased 153 acres of land. His grave is upon this original tract. One hundred acres of the present Fester farm are part of the original farm.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower was born in Germany. The name was spelled Bauer. In the course of the years, the pronounciation and usage changed the spelling to Bower.\n\nWhen a boy of twelve years, he came with his father who settled in Berks county, arriving there on September 25, 1751.\n\nHe had been a resident of the United States twenty-four years when the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. In 1777, at the age of thirty-eight years, he enlisted in Captain Peter Smith's Company of Berks county militia that became a part of the army under personal command of General George Washington.\n\nIt is this authenticated record, with all the papers recorded at the capitol at Washington, that establishes the Revolutionary War service and incidentally makes a large section of the population of Berwick, Briar Creek and Center eligible for the Sons of the American Revolution, the Daughters of the American Revolution or any of the other societies for which direct descent from a Revolutionary War soldier is a requirement.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower was born in 1738. He died on Feb. 26, 1820 and in the custom of the time was buried in the family burial plot on the farm. Mrs. Bower died in 1825. There were twenty or thirty graves in the plot, all of which have been plowed over except he grave of the Revolutionary soldier. One of the sons succeeded the father in the ownership of the farm. In 1855 it passed into the Fester family and since then has been the Fester farm.\n\nSeven Children.\n\nThere were seven children of the couple who grew to adulthood. Six were married. Three died in childhood.\n\nDaniel Bower never married. The other six children who had large families and started the six lines of descent were;\n\nJacob Bower.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower, Jr.\n\nSolomon Bower.\n\nAbram Bower.\n\nCatherine Phillippa Bower, married David Whitmire.\n\nHester Bower, married Bastian Kisner.\n\nThe Marriage Certificate.\n\nThe marriage certificate, one of the prize records of C. W. E. Bower of Berwick R. D. 3, is the marriage certificate. It is elaborately decorated in hand drawings in ink of several colors and elaborately printed in German.\n\nThe interesting translation follows:\n\nMy God, when you are with me I lack nothing on earth or in Heaven. You only do I always adore. My God—My Body—My Consolation and Light— My Heart When I do not rely upon Thee, reprove me and laugh not at my misfortune.\n\nHANNA MARTHA BOWER.\n\nHanna Martha Bower born Hill. She was born on the 22 day of March in the year 1750 in Maxetany Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania. Her parents were John Hill and his beloved wife, Hanna, born Kuhelin. The 30 day of March, in the same year, she was christened by Mr. Wagner, the Evangelical Lutheran Minister. The witnesses were Willfred Kranner and the wife Hanna Martha. In the Lutheran Religion instructed, received the sacrament and was confirmed. In 1769 on Aug. 15 she was married to George Michael Bower.\n\nO most high God, keep me that I may always keeep you in my heart. For my whole happiness I look to you and to you only, my God, my Father do I trust when I am in distress. Never may pleasures nor friends cause me to forsake you. As you have promise your son also as a guide and comforter to whom to turn, so will my heart in Joy or Pain seek him and you O God may find me some day with him who gave his body for our salvation.\n\nShall I sorrow when life and soul are passing as long as I put all my trust in you, so long will I have no desire for earthly pleasure. When I am weary, you refresh me. I have all things because I love and abide with you. When I have you I have all that my soul desires. I fear not when with you; for you always uphold me. When you love me, what can I fear! I love and trust you. You are my Body, my Heart's desire, my Soul.\n\n'Diploma' as Butcher That Comes From Germany and of Date 1734 is Interesting Record of Bower Family. Before coming to Berwick in 1751, John Adam Bower (Bauer), father of George Michael Bower, Revolutionary War soldier, lived in Germany. He was married and has a family when he set out to make his home in the New World.\n\nIn the province of Wurtemberg, where he was born, John Adam Bower (Bauer) had beeen apprenticed out in the custom of the day to learn the trade of butcher. This he completed and received his \"diploma.\"\n\nThis interesting document has been preserved. A copy of it, that has much of interest in reflecting the day of apprenticeship that followed down to within a few generations of the present, is provided by C. W. E. Bower, of Berwick, R. D. 3, historian of the Bower family, who has the original, and follows:\n\nTranslation of John Adam Bower’s Diploma dated 1734.\n\nWe hereinafter named, Julian Leisen, citizen and butcher of the town of Mochmuhl in the Principality of Wurtemberg, and Conrad Rathgeber, citizen and butcher of the county estate of his noble highness and hero Entbaren at Jagsthausen, both connected with and custodians of the same Butchers Guild at Mochmuhl, were appointed to publish and make known to all mankind by this letter, that the honorable John Adam Bower and Adam Christopher Bower, citizens and fellow countrymen have petitioned us to set a date to meet at Jagsthausen to examine the honerable son (John Adam Bower) who has stated that he was known to be with George Lisenmengern, also a citizen and butcher of the same Butchers Guild and that he was bound out from 1731 to 1734.\n\nFaithfully and Well\n\nFaithfully and well he learned that for which he had served his time. That since he knew the necessity for admittance into membership of the Guild and given a certificate of recommendation and this certificate published, he was with prayerful thought and desire, eager that such a certificate of recommendation be granted to him.\n\nIf. after we, with good will, had judged this request and considered its benefits—that the truth would be mightally forwarded and great assistance rendered to him, we with the concurrance of the others should give a certificate and witness it.\n\nTherefore it has become our duty in so great and just a cause to find out the truth and state it in writing.\n\nIt has pleased us to summon John Adam Bower with his instructor, George Lisenmengern, our lodgemaster of the same Butchers Guild, to whom he was bound out for three years in accordance with the custom and usage of the Guild.\n\nHe made known to us how well, honestly and courteously with cleanliness and neatness and had learned in that time to serve with respect and courtesy and to cut well and properly.\n\nHe testified how with true diligence, the student, John Adam Bower, learned his duties.\n\nHow it was his greatest desire always to honor his instructor with all his love and respect and follow carefully the instructions of that one who had been as a parent to him.\n\nBoth have testified that he has completed his apprenticeship.\n\nHaving testified these things before the guild, they respectfully departed.\n\nCommended to Butchers Guild\n\nThis is required, that having been given this certificate he is recommended to all, not only those of small importance but more particularly to all masters of the Butchers Guild and we entreat for John Adam Bower diligent and friendly service; who with honor has completed his apprenticeship and with conduct beyond reproach, without wilfull negligence, has displayed to all great commendation and ambition.\n\nWe, in the beginning, named as regular members and custodians of the same Butchers Guild, have with our own hand signed this certificate and also with commendation, have hung upon it, the regular insignia of the Guild.\n\nGiven on the 25 day of December in the year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-four.\n\nFor the Guild and custodians.\n\n(Signed) Julian Leisen\n\nJohn Conrad Rathgeter.\n\nTerms of Lease in 1769 Give Interesting Insight Into Customs of The Early Colonial Day in Pennsylvania.\n\nGeorge Michael Bower, Revolutionary War soldier, before coming to Briar Creek in 1795, had come into possession of a farm through a lease from his father, John Adam Bower.\n\nThis lease is in possession of C. W. E. Bower, of Berwick, R. D. 3, who has for years been compiling a history of the Bower (Bauer) family. Its interesting form reflects the mode and conditions of the day and will be read with interest.\n\nThe lease reads as follows:\n\nLease between John Adam Bower and George Michael Bower, dated July 22nd 1769\n\nKnow and be it known hereby to those especially concerned, that on a certain set date, John Adam Bower, at present Church Warden of the Zion's Church in Richmond Township, Berks County, on the one hand, and George Michael Bower, his son, on the other hand, having of their own free will and accord agreed upon the following selling contract and bargain.\n\nThat George Michael Bower must pay to the seller, John Adam Bower, who up until this time was in possession of and enjoyment of the improvements on the 148 acres, more or less once successively owned by Peter Grimenveld, Harry Reamer, John Sassenmannshaussen and Christopher Roth and conveniently situated for his son, George Michael Bower in the before mentioned Township and County, who has agreed that he shall and will make payment therefor of Ninety Pounds Pennsylvania coin; and shall make the first payment on the 27 of November, 1770, and on the same day of each successive year as follows:\n\n27 November 1770—£10\n\n27 \" 1771— 10\n\n27 \" 1772— 10\n\n27 \" 1773— 10\n\n27 \" 1774— 10\n\n27 \" 1775— 10\n\n27 \" 1776— 10\n\n27 \" 1777— 10\n\n27 \" 1778— 10\n\nTotal £90\n\nAnd furthermore, the buyer, George Michael Bower has agreed to pay to his father, yearly, as long as he shall live; and has already made the first delivery for November, 1770\n\nWheat—5 bushels\n\nCorn—15 bushels\n\nYearly, one hog of 100 lbs (pork)\n\n1 acre sown in Buckwheat\n\n¼ acre of land on which he mather may sow his seed\n\n1 bushel salt\n\n½ lb pepper\n\n¼ lb allspice\n\n1 pair mens and one pair womens shoes\n\n—eggs (the number torn off)\n\n1 Gallon Drum\n\nCoin yearly to the amount of £1—10 shillings and George Michael Bower agrees to keep in pasture for his father 2 sheep and one cow.\n\nHis father agrees however to give his son the assistance of his advice and experience and also give to him beside\n\nOne horse\n\nOne young cow\n\nTwo sheep\n\nOne new plow\n\nOne barrow\n\nOne horse collar\n\nOne pair traces -|-\n\nFurthermore, the buyer, George Michael Bower, expressly states that his brother, Jacob, shall be allowed to stay on his place without cost and all those things which 'till now he has possessed and enjoyed, he shall be allowed to posssess and enjoy peacefully and without argument.\n\nJacob, when he has received his freedom, shall receive three acres of land and he may be allowed to cultivate this land without interference or charge.
