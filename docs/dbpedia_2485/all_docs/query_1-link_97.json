        "text": "2012: Big Sean and Jhené Aiko meet and have their first date\n\nBig Sean met Jhené Aiko at a party hosted by producer No ID, per Flaunt Magazine.\n\n“It was just very comfortable,” Aiko noted of their initial interaction. Despite reportedly having a boyfriend at the time, the two went on a date to a Lakers game.\n\n“I didn’t care,” Sean teased. “It was pretty obvious after a while it was a date. We had never really been alone together. It was really fun.” The next day, she did clarify that they weren’t dating.\n\nAiko continued, “I tweeted, ‘I’m not dating Big Sean LOL.’ And then Sean got mad at me like, ‘You gonna play me like that?’ I’m like, ‘But we’re friends!’” He liked that they were both serious and silly.\n\n2016: Their joint album, 'TWENTY88,' drops\n\nDuring the promotion for their joint album and new group — both titled TWENTY88 — Jhené and Sean were quite cozy. That spring, they were seen holding hands and kissing. She was married at the time, but filed for divorce that August citing irreconcilable differences — which had nothing to do with Sean.\n\nIn since-deleted tweets, Jhené explained that her ex-husband, Dot da Genius, “jumped ship” long before they officially divorced. “He wants to be victim and I’ll let his b**ch a** assume the role,” she tweeted.\n\nSean then gushed over his relationship with Jhené to Billboard saying, “Jhené is more than just a friend. I don’t know how else to describe it — me and her are just cool like that. I love her and I know she loves me. I was down to make that commitment [to be in a group together] — something that will last and be different from the rest.”\n\n2017: Jhené calls Sean the \"love of her life\"\n\nIn an interview with Billboard when discussing her album, Trip, Jhené declared Sean to be the love of her life.\n\nWhen she lost her brother Miyagi in 2012, she embarked on a journey to find herself and someone who reminded her of him — it was then that she met Sean. The singer explained, “When I met Sean, I had a boyfriend and he was showing interest in me, but I was like, ‘I have a boyfriend.’ But we were friends, it was never, nothing disrespectful ever happened between me and Sean. We were forced to really, really get to know each other on a friendship level, you know what I mean? And to the point where he was even at my brother’s funeral. We talked to each other on a friendship level throughout all of my relationship.”\n\nWhen they both became single, their relationship became romantic. “It just came to a point where it was like, ‘I’m single, you’re single, we love each other.’ We actually already loved each other as people and then it was like, ‘Okay, let’s just, you know, be together.’ So it was different because of that friendship. That comes first, we’re friends before anything,” Jhené noted.\n\n2018: Jhené covers Sean's portrait tattoo with a dragon\n\nEven though rumors swirled about a breakup, Jhené defended her decision to coverup her back tattoos with a fiery dragon and addressed the controversy.\n\n“Sometimes you don’t want to follow ur boyfriend/girlfriend on social media.. if it weren’t for u crazy blogs and ur speculation I would follow and unfollow him twice a day, everyday… [it’s] not that serious… I see him enough in real life and on my arm,” said the singer on social media.\n\nAs far as the tattoo is concerned, she explained, “NEW ART! NO BEEF! ALL LOVE!” and explained that she “covered ALL my tats w/ a big a** Dragon w/ a Phoenix wing” to represent “breathing life and light into a new galaxy.”\n\n2019: The two seemingly reunite for Sean's \"Single Again\"\n\nIn July 2019, Sean released “Single Again” that featured Jhené on background vocals.\n\nShe supported the record on social media, which led the rapper to respond, “I appreciate you supporting me on this one and I want to just say I love you unconditionally. You amazing, talented, every song we do special to me! People gon say whatever but it is what it is. I could have txt u this I know but I want people to know I appreciate you.”\n\n2020: A miscarriage that was \"None Of Your Concern\"\n\nAfter tapping Jhené for “Single Again,” she called upon her musical partner for her single, “None Of Your Concern.“\n\nSome speculate that he rapped about their breakup, but he definitely spit bars about their sex life, rapping, “I made you c*m nine times in one day/ Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face/ I realize you look as good as you taste […] I guess that’s none of your concern.”\n\nHe then revealed that they suffered a miscarriage in his song “Deep Reverence” as he rapped, “Probably why this s**t with me get crazy and we lost a baby.” Sean confirmed that with Sway Calloway.\n\nThey formally linked up as a couple for Sean’s “Body Language.” In the video, they paid homage to classic Black romances like Love Jones, Waiting To Exhale, The Best Man, and Poetic Justice.\n\n2022: They announce they're expecting their first child\n\nJhené was spotted with a baby bump in early July 2022 and news that she and Sean were expecting was confirmed shortly after.\n\n“The couple is overjoyed and looks forward to this next chapter,” a source told news outlets. It was Sean’s first child and Jhené’s second.\n\nWhen gushing over the announcement, the rapper wrote on his Instagram stories, “Whole new motivation forreal! Very grateful God continues to bless us, Thank You. Can’t wait to be a Dad.” The singer confirmed the news by posting a childhood photo of her holding her stomach.\n\nNovember 2022: They welcome their son, Noah Hasani Chilombo-Anderson\n\nNoah Hasani Chilombo-Anderson was born on Nov. 8, 2022. His parents shared news of his birth 10 days later.\n\nPaired with a picture of his son holding his finger, Sean wrote, “After 24 hours of Labor, A Lunar Eclipse, with rain from the beginning of labor til he was born, he’s here safe and sound. Happy, Healthy and everything we could ever ask for and more. Any and everything for you Son.”\n\nJhené took to her own page writing, “After 24 hours of labor, a total lunar eclipse, and while it was pouring rain… he came. my baby Yoda, my Sani.”\n\n2023: Parenting tributes, couple ceases breakup rumors\n\nOn her first Mother’s Day as a mom of two, Sean honored the mother of his child.\n\n“Seeing Jhené be such a great Mother makes me appreciate motherhood even more,” he wrote on Instagram. “Makes me appreciate my Mom more too cause it’s a lot i never even thought about until seeing first hand wit my boy all the love, time, patience and sacrifice that goes into being a great Parent, its unreal. We love you @jheneaiko.”\n\nFor his first Father’s Day, Jhené shared glimpses of their life as a family of four.\n\nA few months later, fans noticed they’d unfollowed each other online and she shared some cryptic posts on her Instagram including one that read, “The guy who has u explaining the meaning of empathy is not ur soulmate.”\n\nHowever, Page Six confirmed that they didn’t break up.\n\n2024: Big Sean details why he and Jhené aren't married\n\nSean appeared on Charlamagne tha God’s Out Of Context podcast on Aug. 2. He confirmed that he and Jhené didn’t secretly get married, and said the reason they haven’t jumped the broom is “a little personal.”\n\n“Just like any people who have dealt with love, we’ve had our ups and downs, you know what I’m saying? And I think it’s still finding the right navigation through it all,” said the rapper.\n\nSean feels “marriage symbolizes like the best relationship,” but that marriage itself is “almost a fear-based way of thinking.” Yet, he remains open to getting married even though he doesn’t like “putting our personal business out there like that either, but there’s a lot of work that needs to be done […] I can only speak for myself that there needs to be like more work done so we could keep going.”\n\nHe continued, “There’s a lot of focus on our family, there’s a lot of focus on careers and everything, and [marriage] is something that I feel like has not been the main focus.” He and Jhené have an almost two-year-old son, Noah Hasani, and the singer has 15-year-old Namiko Love with her ex-boyfriend, O’Ryan Browner."
