        "text": "Kristin Bauer van Straten is the American actor who portrays Maleficent on ABC's Once Upon a Time and Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.\n\nBiography\n\nKristin Neubauer, professionally known as Kristin Bauer van Straten, was born on November 26,[2] 1966[1] in Racine, Wisconsin to Sara and Ralph Neubauer. She is of German ancestry[3] and has a brother, Jeffrey, who is the president of an industrial packaging business, Kranz Inc., and was a former chairman of the state Democratic Party and an ex-state legislator and a sister, Jill.[2] Kristin graduated from The Prairie School[1] and grew up in Northern Wisconsin surrounded by wildlife and nature.[4]\n\nAfter high school, she studied fine arts at Washington University in St. Louis and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and Berklee College of Music in Boston and later moved to Los Angeles on a whim. Kristin began modeling lingerie for mail-order catalogs and calendars for motorcycle manufacturers, but switched to a serious future in acting.[1]\n\nIn 1995, she had her first recurring role in a television series, as Maggie Reynolds on The Crew. Other recurring roles are those of Geneva Renault in Total Security, Candy Cooper in That's Life, Rebecca Colfax in Dirty Sexy Money, and Belinda Slypich in Hidden Hills. Perhaps her best-known film role was in Dancing at the Blue Iguana in 2000. In 2001, she starred in the award-winning short film Room 302, and in 2004, she had a minor role in 50 First Dates, starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. In the animated series Justice League, she supplied the voice of the superhero Mera. Kristin was a series regular on HBO's True Blood as vampire Pam.\n\nShe has also made a number of guest appearances in several television shows, including LA Law, Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, Dark Angel, Two and a Half Men, Star Trek: Enterprise, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Desperate Housewives, and George Lopez. She famously appeared in a Seinfeld episode, \"The Bizarro Jerry\", as Gillian, Jerry's girlfriend with \"man hands\".\n\nIn-between acting jobs, Kristin likes professionally draw and paint. She is an environmentalist and activist; working for such causes as the International Fund for Animal Welfare's \"Tails for Whales\" campaign and donating money to The Best Friends Sanctuary dog rescue.[2] As an advocate against animal cruelty and testing, she joined actor Leonardo DiCaprio for the Animal Legal Defense Fund in freeing Tony, a ten-year-old Siberian-Bengal tiger who has spent every day and night of the last decade caged at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse TÃªte, Louisiana[5] and worked with Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine to promote cosmetics that are not tested on animals.[6]\n\nShe met her future husband, Swedish[3] South African-born musician Abri Van Straten, in 2009 after asking him out on a coffee date. Their rapport continued to build over the course of six months, which cumulated with a wedding ceremony[7] on her family's Wisconsin farm in August of the same year.[8]\n\nTrivia\n\nHer past odd jobs include working as a window washer, nanny and saleswoman for Herbalife.[4]\n\nShe and co-star Merrin Dungey took acting classes together.[9]\n\nEnjoyed working with Lana Parrilla in \"The Thing You Love Most\" so much that when her old show True Blood was over, she told her manager to let the creators of Once Upon a Time know that she was available to return.[9]\n\nOnce she heard that she was going to return for the fourth season, she chose not to watch the 2014 movie Maleficent, in order to make her portrayal of the character her own.[9]\n\nAppearances\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Season One \"Pilot\": \"The Thing You Love Most\": \"Snow Falls\": \"The Price of Gold\": \"That Still Small Voice\": \"The Shepherd\": \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\": \"Desperate Souls\": \"True North\": \"7:15 A.M.\": \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\": Absent Appears Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Skin Deep\": \"What Happened to Frederick\": \"Dreamy\": \"Red-Handed\": \"Heart of Darkness\": \"Hat Trick\": \"The Stable Boy\": \"The Return\": \"The Stranger\": \"An Apple Red as Blood\": \"A Land Without Magic\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Appears\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Season Four \"A Tale\n\nof Two\n\nSisters\": \"White\n\nOut\": \"Rocky\n\nRoad\": \"The\n\nApprentice\": \"Breaking\n\nGlass\": \"Family Business\": \"The\n\nSnow\n\nQueen\": \"Smash\n\nthe\n\nMirror\": \"Fall\": \"Shattered\n\nSight\": \"Heroes\n\nand\n\nVillains\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Appears \"Darkness\n\non the Edge\n\nof Town\": \"Unforgiven\": \"Enter the Dragon\": \"Poor\n\nUnfortunate\n\nSoul\": \"Best Laid Plans\": \"Heart of Gold\": \"Sympathy\n\nfor the\n\nDe Vil\": \"Lily\": \"Mother\": \"Operation Mongoose\n\nPart 1\": \"Operation Mongoose\n\nPart 2\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Absent Appears Appears Appears Absent Absent\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Season Seven \"Hyperion Heights\": \"A Pirate's Life\": \"The Garden of Forking Paths\": \"Beauty\": \"Greenbacks\": \"Wake Up Call\": \"Eloise Gardener\": \"Pretty in Blue\": \"One Little Tear\": \"The Eighth Witch\": \"Secret Garden\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent \"A Taste of the Heights\": \"Knightfall\": \"The Girl in the Tower\": \"Sisterhood\": \"Breadcrumbs\": \"Chosen\": \"The Guardian\": \"Flower Child\": \"Is This Henry Mills?\": \"Homecoming\": \"Leaving Storybrooke\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Archive\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland \"Down the Rabbit Hole\": \"Trust Me\": \"Forget Me Not\": \"The Serpent\": \"Heart of Stone\": \"Who's Alice\": \"Bad Blood\": Absent Absent Voice Only Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Home\": \"Nothing to Fear\": \"Dirty Little Secrets\": \"Heart of the Matter\": \"To Catch a Thief\": \"And They Lived...\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Specials \"Magic is Coming\":\n\n\"The Price of Magic\": \"Journey to Neverland\": \"Wicked is Coming\": \"Storybrooke Has Frozen Over\": Archive Absent Archive Absent Absent \"Secrets of Storybrooke\": \"Dark Swan Rises\": \"Evil Reigns Once More\": \"The Final Battle Begins\": Archive Archive Archive Absent\n\nNote: \"Archive\" denotes archive footage.\n\nKristin Bauer van Straten on Wikipedia"
