        "text": "This post is the second in preparation for a first-time ever Norlu Press event that will take place later this year. More posts to follow as the big days get closer.\n\nThe ongoing Norlu Press initiative found me searching for metal type to meet the requirements of composing text with German characters—umlauts, unfamiliar letters like “ß” and the like—for use in letterpress printing. In this post, I will share a little bit about what I have learned.\n\nI need to provide some context for this post. There is much to learn about letterforms and their use by linguists, programmers and typographers—all of whom apply mastery of terminology from their own perspectives. The following account of my personal experience with the German language and its connection to letterpress composition relies on a somewhat relaxed interpretation of the lexicon. Apologies in advance to Germans, academics and enthusiasts everywhere.\n\nThe German “Specials”\n\nI have a healthy respect for trying to print in German. Despite my German maternal ancestry, I do not speak German. The language learning firm Busuu, however, states that I already know more about the language than I realize: “German has all the same letters as English, plus a few more thrown in for fun. Once you can recognize the letters that might trip you up, you’ll be ready to test your skills!”\n\nWhat could be so difficult about composing words from 30 letters (the English 26 plus ä, ö, ü and ß)?\n\nWhen they appear in German text, I refer to these extra glyphs as “specials.” I realize this reflects an egocentric perspective, but to me, anything that I don’t see or use every day is special. It is a term of respect…an acknowledgment of the unique contribution that these characters represent in my current design and printing endeavors.\n\nMy most immediate need for German specials came from the requirement to set the German nostalgic form of the greeting “Merry Christmas.” While the common 21st Century recognition of the Christian holiday is “Frohe Weihnachten,” many of the postcards that were popular in the late Victorian era featured a more formal “Fröhliche Weihnachten.” The use of “Fröhliche,” rather than “Frohe” indicates a usage that my letterpress colleague Ernst Schäfer told me was “a little outdated.”\n\nFortunately, Google Translate recognizes glyphs that are not part of common 21st Century English. Pasting both “fröhliche” and “frohe” into its translation engine produces the same English translation of “happy.” Adding the German “Weihnachten” for “Christmas” produces, in both instances, “Merry Christmas.”\n\nFinding the Typeface\n\nA great thing about letterpress printing is that its highly engaged community is available as a resource. Through one of several letterpress Facebook groups, I met Michael Moore of The Letterkraft Press. He identified a large font of what we believed to be a face called Bradley in 36 points.\n\nI knew of this typeface, as Skyline Typefoundry casts new fonts of Bradley in 24 points. When I found an American Typefounders (ATF) advertisement for it in the November 1895 edition of Inland Printer that advanced its suitability for Christmas, I knew that Michael Moore was on to something…a Christmas font AND German specials? Wunderbar!\n\nMichael shipped the types to me in a USPS Flat Rate Box weighing about 25 pounds, and when I opened its internal meticulously wrapped packages, I was excited to confirm that the font includes the German alphabet’s specials of “ß,” “ä,” “ö,” and “ü.” Additionally, it includes ligatures (sometimes called digraphs) of “rg”, “ch”, and “ck” and the ligature/diphthong combos of “AE” and “OE” in both upper and lower case. The types bear no pinmarks and show signs of fairly heavy usage but are in good condition. There are even leaf ornaments that were part of early issues of the face and an alternate lower case “z” with a long descender.\n\nFurther research revealed that Bradley has a very interesting history that began with its appearance as hand-lettering in the 1894 Christmas edition of the Inland Printer. I also discovered that my types with the German specials are not Bradley, but rather a variation of that typeface. Herman Ihlenburg cut the original complete font of Bradley metal types for MacKellar, Smiths, & Jordan (the Philadelphia branch of ATF) in 1895. Shortly after ATF released Bradley, they issued a new series based on the face that included the German language specials and named it Ihlenburg, in recognition of his work on Bradley.\n\nBradley/Ihlenburg provides what digital type designer David Jonathan Ross describes as simplified, unadorned letterforms that are more accessible to American readers who are unaccustomed to blackletter. For me, the face provides the late Victorian/nascent Art Nouveau look that I wanted with the German “specials” that I needed for the printing I am working on right now.\n\nMy dad, who was a trade letterpress compositor and member of the International Typographical Union, used to tell me there are not really “good faces” and “bad faces” of type, but rather “appropriate” faces. Watch this blog for future posts that will feature the results of my German typesetting endeavor and help to determine if Bradley/Ihlenburg truly is, as ATF claimed, “a most suitable type” for Christmas.\n\nThis post is part of my preparation for a first-time ever Norlu Press event that will take place later this year. More posts to follow as the big days get closer.\n\nThe form of letterpress printing that the west has known since the middle of the 15th Century began in Germany, when Johannes Gutenberg and his associates Peter Schoffer and Johann Fust combined movable types with an adaptation of wine and oil presses to reproduce information in printed form with speed and quality theretofore unknown.\n\nAs an aside, this historical novel about what happened in Mainz is a great read and one of my favorite books on the history of printing.\n\nMy dad composed and printed his first lines of metal type in 1937 and although he was not of German heritage, he lived a printer’s life, immersed in the legacy of the famous German Gutenberg. He passed his passion for printing on to me and thanks to my mother’s genes, I enjoy a special connection to the land of Gutenberg. Mom’s great grandparents came from the European states of Bavaria, Hesse-Darmstadt and Baden, which all became part of modern Germany. I am unaware if any of my German ancestors were printers, but as I apply what I learned from my dad (who was born in Italy), I often reflect on the legacy of German printing.\n\nDad was proud that an Italian named Giambattista Bodoni designed one of the most enduring and beloved typefaces, but many of the technological advances in letterpress printing owe their discovery to Germany, the ancestral homeland of my mother.\n\nIn addition to Guttenberg, Fust and Schoffer, one must consider the Linotype type casting machine patented by German-born inventor Ottmar Mergenthaler. He perfected the technology to cast lines of letters and words as single pieces of metal type.\n\nHeidelberg printing presses made in Germany were known for their technical superiority and are central to what remains of the letterpress printing enterprise of the 21st Century.\n\nNot all of the German contributions to printing were demonstrations of mechanical superiority. The innovative and minimalistic Bauhaus school of design (1919-1933) introduced modernism to architecture. Its melding of technology and art influenced design of furniture, automobiles and eventually graphic design and typography.\n\nAfter learning the basics of letterpress printing as a teenager, my father used his World War II GI Bill to attend the printing program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. After graduation, he worked initially as a pressman, tending the workhorse printing press of his day, the Miehle Vertical that American of German descent Robert Miehle designed.\n\nI will share my progress as I invoke my German ancestry and prepare The Norlu Press for the upcoming engagement. In the meantime, here is a 19th Century lithograph from Nuremberg, Germany with a hint about what is coming up. Prost!\n\nPrinted with warm wishes for joyful holidays\n\nOn the occasion of the 80th Anniversary of The Norlu Press\n\nAs promised in my July 18, 2017 preview, I have printed very special Christmas and Holiday greeting cards as a way of celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of The Norlu Press. This post provides details about the cards themselves, but I am selling them in sets of five with a companion limited edition print. You can read a future post on this blog to learn more about the signed and numbered prints when they are ready for purchase, which I expect to be August 25, 2017.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nPress: 1863 Gordon Jobber\n\nRollers: Composition Rollers cast in 2013 on original cores by David Hauser at Tarheel Roller\n\nInks: Dense Black, PMS 485 Red, PMS 7740 Emerald Green and PMS 1235 Goldenrod by Southern Ink\n\nStock: Crane’s Lettra 100% Cotton 110LB/300gsm Fluorescent White Cover scored on press and Crane’s Lettra 100% Cotton 80LB/118gsm White Text from CutCardStock\n\nSize: A2 (5.5”x8.5”, folds to 5.5”x4.25”)\n\nFront Panel: Original American Type Founders (ATF) Holiday Decorator No. 817 in four colors from the 1929 Decorative Material for Holiday Printing supplemental catalog and circa 1937 casting of 30-point Trafton Script by Germany’s Bauer Type Foundry.\n\nBack Panel: 18-point Rondo by Amsterdam Continental, 10-point Gothic 554 by ATF, 8-point Engravers Roman by ATF.\n\nImpression: Front panel is a “21st Century Kiss,” a term I have begun using to describe just enough impression to create and emboss on the front with a very slight deboss apparent on the back. Back panel is a kiss with no emboss/deboss.\n\nTotal Number of Makereadies and Impressions per Card: Seven, including hits of black, red, green and goldenrod in close register.\n\nThese cards are not only a technical feat, but they are also beautiful. The fluorescent white Lettra stock took the specially formulated letterpress inks beautifully, and its weight allowed me to pump up the impression on the black engraving so that the snow on the roofs of the buildings appears to fluff up and out of the paper.\n\nI chose Trafton Script by the Bauer Type Foundry for the greeting line because it was originally cast at about the same time Louis DiRisio (my father) and his boyhood friend Norman Alfe founded The Norlu Press in 1937. The ATF Holiday Decorators, which appeared in the 1929 supplemental catalog, predate the founding of the print shop, but the image they combine to form evokes what I believe must have been the Christmas mood of my father’s early teen years in Fairport, New York.\n\nThe amount of time invested in each one of these cards is significant, as they required a total of seven impositions/lockups, makereadies and press runs on the Gordon Jobber that was my dad’s first press. The four colors in perfect close register from original metal dies are unlike any letterpress greeting cards that are available in the current market. The work was painstaking and precise, but the result is very much worth the effort.\n\nTwo versions of the card are available. One version bears the greeting of “Christmas Greetings,” while the other offers “Season’s Greetings. The debate on which is more appropriate, more traditional and more modern is significant. Rather than enter into it, I prefer to offer both versions, so that as many people as possible can share the quality, beauty and precision of fine handcrafted letterpress greeting cards. Options are also available for customers to add a verse, with or without personalization, to the inside of the card and to personalize the envelopes.\n\nThe run is limited to 20 sets of five Christmas Greetings cards and 20 sets of five Season’s Greetings cards. They are mailed with the complementary signed and numbered print in premium packaging and will be available on August 25, 2017 starting at $24 in my Etsy store at https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheNorluPress."
