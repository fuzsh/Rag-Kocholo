        "text": "In advance of the new annual Reckford Lecture in European Studies, join faculty from Art History and Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures for a panel discussion on (Anti-)Fascism and Avant Garde Movements! The event is on February 15, 2024, at 5:30 pm in Toy Lounge of Dey Hall. Refreshments to follow.\n\nProfessor Dan Sherman will be representing our department on the panel and speaking about Italian futurism and the so-called “return to order” in France after WW1, with emphasis on Le Corbusier.\n\nCongratulations to Assistant Professor of Studio Art Martin Wannam, who was just named to the 2023 Silver List.\n\nModeled on the idea of the Hollywood Black List (the best unproduced screenplays of the year), the Silver List includes 24 photographers selected by nearly 100 curators, educators, publishers, and researchers working in photography in North America. Respondents to the 2023 Silver List were asked to list up to ten artists working in or with photography, with the following criteria:\n\nThey love the artist’s work and feel it should be seen more widely\n\nThe artist uses the medium of photography (however they define it)\n\nThe artist is living and early in their career (however they define it)\n\nArtists who have previously been named to the Silver List are not included in this year’s list.\n\nThe resulting list of 24 artists represents the most frequently recommended artists. Collectively they represent a range of approaches to photography, and different ways of engaging with art discourses, contemporary concerns, and personal expression. The artists on the list represent an amazing range of approaches to photography.\n\nMFA alumnus Michael Bramwell, Joyce Linde Curator of Folk and Self-Taught Art at the MFA Boston, contributed scholarship to Unnamed Figures: Black Presence and Absence in the Early American North, the catalog accompanying an American Folk Art Museum exhibition that will be on view from November 15, 2023 to March 24, 2024. As a corrective to histories that define slavery and anti-Black racism as a largely Southern issue, this exhibition and catalog offer a new window onto Black representation in a region that is often overlooked in narratives of early African American history. The 300-page publication draws on years of research and archival work and contextualizes the exhibition as well as expanding upon its themes, including how Black representations may have been further marginalized or misconstrued by collectors of early American art and material culture."
