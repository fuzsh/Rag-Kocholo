Myles, who carried and gave birth to their baby and identifies as transmasculine, and Precious, his wife who is a transgender woman, have requested that the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) issue an accurate birth certificate that does not misgender them and either describes them both as “co-parents,” or alternatively lists Myles in the field reserved for “Father/Co-Parent” and Precious as “Mother/Co-Parent.”"
