        "text": "The 90's produced not only one of the greatest decades of R&B music, but also some of the most memorable artists our generation has ever seen, including Grand Rapids, Michigan native, International, Multi-Platinum, Award-winning R&B Icon Adina Howard.\n\n1995 was a milestone year for Adina. Signed to Mecca Don/EastWest records, she struck certified gold and platinum with her no holds barred debut album \"Do You Wanna Ride?\" and her #2 Billboard Hot 100 single \"Freak Like Me\". That year Adina Howard became a global household name.\n\nHoward is revered as one of the early pioneers of sexual expressionism for women of color. Her mega-hits \"Freak Like Me\" and \"T-shirt and Panties\" were more than just chart-topping singles, they were anthems for the sexually liberated.\n\nAdina was widely ridiculed for her bold lyrics and provocative image. Though she was ahead of her time, she would not be detoured from being comfortable with her stance, if a man can do it, she can too. Howard helped pave the way for future urban female recording artists to embrace their sensual side and creatively express it through their artistry, freely.\n\nIn 1996, she collaborated with Warren G for the Police Story 3: Super Cop soundtrack with the single \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" featuring a sample of the Tina Turner hit. The single was another hit for Adina, peaking at #2 on the UK charts.\n\nWhile working on her second album, Howard worked with actor/comedian, Jamie Foxx on the provocatively titled song, \"T-shirt and Panties\". Being the risk taker that she is, Adina wanted to lead with the rousing song as her first single from her forthcoming album \"Welcome to Fantasy Island\", but it was too racy for radio and the label shied away from promoting it. However, it found a home on the soundtrack to the film \"Woo\" featuring Jada Pinkett Smith and eventually was included on her third album, \"The Second Coming\". It became an R&B classic in the years following, becoming one of Adina's signature songs to perform.\n\nIn 1997, she prepared for the release of her sophomore album, \"Welcome to Fantasy Island\". It garnered critical raves and a moderate hit with the lead single, \"(Freak) And U Know It\", but was shelved by Elektra Records in 1997 due to conflict of interest. The album was leaked to the internet a few years later and promotional copies sold for hundreds of dollars on eBay.\n\nIn 2004, Adina's third studio album \"The Second Coming\" was released. Hampered by label woes, the success of the album was left to fate. Then in 2007, her fourth studio album \"Private Show\" was finally released after multiple delays. Due to the limited budget, the label had to work with \"Private Show\" didn't receive the push needed to garner attention.\n\nOn January 2010, Adina enrolled in Culinary school, temporarily putting her singing career on hold to pursue her passion for cooking. While she was working towards her Associate's degree in Culinary arts, she worked as a line cook at a Triple-A Four Diamond Resort in Chandler, AZ. In August 2011, Adina officially added another title to her belt, chef.\n\nResuming her singing career in 2013, Adina released her new single \"Switch\" which was to be the lead single off her fifth studio album, The Switch Up. It received positive reviews and won \"Best Dance/Club Single of the Year\" at the 2013 UB Honors, which was voted on by the public.\n\nAside from singing and songwriting, Adina has appeared in independent films such as Casanova's Demise, Poke the Sleeping Bear (Winner of Best Short, 2008 Solstice Film Festival) and the Relaxer. As well as appeared in the stage plays \"Man of God\",\" Do You Trust Your Best Friend\" and the stage reading \"For All My Girls\".\n\nWith all she has accomplished and continues to set out to achieve, Adina continues to find time to hit the studio and create future classics. In August 2015, she independently released the upbeat single \"Bad 4 Me\". This contemporary urban doo-wop-inspired ditty was a departure from what made her a household name.\n\nAdina Howard has evolved as a woman and an artist. All that she has left behind to become who she is today can be heard on her new album \"Resurrection\", released digitally, March 2018.\n\nHer socially conscience lead single \"Blasphemy\" has the nostalgic cadence of Lift Every Voice/Black American National Anthem woven into the melody. This urban battle cry encourages one to wake up and recognize the God within. Blasphemy is the perfect showcase for her legions of angels to hear her deliver vocals that's music to their ears and an empowering message that will inspire their soul.\n\nHer maternal grandfather, Frank W. Woolworth, founded the department store chain of the same name in New York at the turn of the century, with which he soon made a considerable fortune all over the world. Barbara Hutton therefore grew up in sheltered and wealthy circumstances. Her father died when she was a child; In May 1917, as a four-year-old, she found the body of her mother, Edna (n√©e Woolworth), who had committed suicide in her suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York. As the sole heir, she became a millionaire several times over when her parents died at the age of seven. She was considered the richest woman in the world. Hutton made several trips around the world and met the Georgian prince Alexis Mdivani, whom she married in Paris in 1933. The relationship did not have a happy outcome. They were separated again after their honeymoon and divorced in 1935.\n\nHutton achieved the same failure with her subsequent marriages. In 1935 she married Count Kurt von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow, with whom she lived in London and had their only child. Son Lance was born in 1936 and later had a career in automobile racing. When Hutton separated from her second husband in 1938, the son remained with the Count. This marriage ended in divorce in 1941. The wealthy woman's third marriage was to actor Cary Grant in 1942, with whom she remained married until 1945. Because she felt neglected by Grant, who was only concentrating on his film career, she caused the separation. The fourth marriage to Igor Trubetzkoj, a French prince of Russian descent, lasted from 1948 to 1951. This was followed by Hutton's fifth marriage in 1953: the relationship with the Dominican diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa, whom she had met in Paris, only lasted a few months and was broken off in the spring of 1954.\n\nIn 1955, Hutton entered into her sixth marriage to a long-time friend, the German tennis player Gottfried Freiherr von Cramm. In the beginning, she actually seemed to have found the right partner in Cramm. However, this relationship did not develop as desired, so it was dissolved in 1961. After a brief affair with the musician Lloyd Franklin, Hutton married Prince Raymond Doan Vinh of Laos for his seventh marriage. This last marriage lasted from 1964 to 1969. After the last divorce, Hutton retreated to California, where she spent the last years of her life in complete isolation and suffered from severe anorexia. In 1972, her son had a fatal accident in a car race. She couldn't get over the loss. Marked by the illness, she lived in a hotel in Los Angeles."
