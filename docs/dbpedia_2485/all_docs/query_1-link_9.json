        "text": "Hi, I'm wondering if the brothers who moved to Iowa moved to Greene County, Iowa? You're seeking their brother Michael, and it's possible that he moved near them, so maybe it would be worthwhile to share more specific details about them and their location.\n\nI'm also wondering how you know Michael and Bertha divorced? What is your source?\n\nI hope it's okay if I add more about the family - information that you already know. May help volunteer researchers to help you. You have posted some/most of this previously. These records add key information, such as approximate DOB of the sisters about whom you ask. A couple of details here might be new to you.\n\n1860 US Census\n\nCochecton, Sullivan, New York\n\nChristian Bauer 31 born about 1829\n\nCarolina Febrey Bauer 36 born about 1824 -[her maiden name?]\n\nSalomea Bauer age 8 born about 1852\n\nChristian Bauer age 4 born about 1856\n\nCaroline Bauer age 2 born about 1858\n\nMagdalena Bauer 7 months born about 1859-1860\n\nOn a Find a Grave memorial is posted an erroneous 1880 census for Caroline, the mother, as a widow in Buffalo, Erie, New York, which is presumably the WRONG family and should be corrected.\n\n1880 US Census\n\nMorristown, Rice, Minnesota\n\nChristopher Bauer 51 born about 1829 Baden\n\nCaroline Bauer 56 born about 1824 in Baden\n\nChristopher Bauer 23 born about 1857 in New York\n\nMatthias Bauer 19 born about 1861 in New York\n\nMichael Bauer 19 born about 1861 in New York\n\nON THE SAME CENSUS PAGE in 1880 - this could be Caroline Bauer (the daughter b abt 1858 in New York), although the birth year is off.\n\n1880 US Census\n\nMorristown, Rice, Minnesota\n\nJohn Weber 37 b Baden\n\nCaroline Weber 28 born in New York, father b Bavaria, mother b Wur\n\nJohn Jr. Weber 6\n\nReesena (?)

Gave his age as 42 and birth date as 27 February 1876, nearest relative father John Weber senior. In the section for physical handicaps, the form asks if person has lost an arm or a leg, and the form says \"right arm.\"\n\nAlso in the 1880 census in Morristown, Rice, Minnesota are Christian Bauer born 1800 in Baden and wife Lena (Lena can be short for Magdalena; if this Christian is related, Magdalena could be a family name).\n\nAlso in the 1880 census (on the page just after Christopher and Caroline) is a Matt Bauer of an age to be a sibling to Christopher:\n\n1880\n\nMorristown, Rice, Minnesota\n\nMatt Bauer, 45, born 1835 in Baden\n\nDora Bauer 44\n\nJohn Bauer 17, born New York\n\nJacob Bauer 15, born Minnesota\n\nChristian Bauer 10, born Minnesota\n\nLouisa Bauer 7, born Minnesota\n\nKate Bauer 4 months, born Minnesota\n\nAlso in the 1880 census in Morristown, Rice, Minnesota is Lena Bauer, age 18, born about 1862 in Minnesota, working as a servant in the home of John Gibson. This makes me wonder if the earlier Magdalena died and another girl was born to Christopher and Caroline and named after her.\n\n\"Your\" Michael Bauer married Abbie Kenney in 1883; one daughter, Bessie Ellen Bauer, born 22 November 1884.\n\n1900 US Census\n\nMorristown, Rice, Minnesota\n\nMary A Horton 37, b Aug 1862 married 22 yrs 12 ch 9 living\n\nEthel P Horton 19, born Mar 1881\n\nBertha E Horton, born 17 Jan 1883 <--Michael Bauer 2nd wife\n\nRoy A Horton 14 Dec 1885\n\nMary V Horton 11 Jun 1888\n\nInez C Horton 9 Nov 1890\n\nGrace A Horton 5 Jun 1894\n\nEvelyne M Horton 3 Sep 1896\n\nRuth B Horton 1 Aug 1898\n\nSophrona C Kenney 84 Jan 1816 9 children 6 living\n\n1904 MARRIAGE from Minnesota Official Marriage System (index at www.mncounty.com)\n\nBertha E Horton married Michael Bauer 07 March 1904 in Rice County, Minnesota\n\nBIRTHS indexed at Minnesota Historical Society:\n\nEvelyn Mary Bauer born 22 Nov 1905 in Paxton, Redwood, Minnesota.

But Michael also could have died after 1910 census and before Aug 1912. I don't see him at Minnesota Historical Society death index.\n\n1918 - John Leo Powers b 13 Feb 1878 registered for the World War I draft in Morristown, Rice, Minnesota - wife Bertha\n\nJohn Leo Powers seems to be buried at Waterville, Le Sueur, Minnesota (no Bertha and I did not search for her as that is not what you are asking about)\n\nI don't see a World War I draft registration for Michael Bauer.\n\nMichael Bauer's daughter Bessie Ellen Bauer, born 22 November 1884 married George William Whittet 32 May 1905 in Redwood County, Minnesota (per Minnesota Official Marriage System at www.mncounty.com)\n\nI suppose it is possible Michael is near his first-born daughter, so perhaps this is worth mentioning to any forum volunteers who try to help search for him.\n\nFind a Grave Memorial (created by you)\n\nBessie Bauer Whittet\n\nBirth: Nov. 22, 1884 in Rice County, Minnesota\n\nDeath: Nov. 27, 1911 in Redwood County, Minnesota\n\nBurial: Redwood Falls Cemetery, Redwood Falls, Redwood, Minnesota\n\nFollowing is an excerpt from History of Rice and Steele Counties, Minnesota:\n\n\"The German Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church of the Unaltered Augsberg Confession is located in section 4, Morristown township, about five miles to the northward of Morristown village. It belongs to the Minnesota and Dakota district of the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri. Ohio and other states. Surrounding it is quite a colony of German people, industrious, frugal, hardworking and prosperous. The church had its inception in 1864, with the arrival in this locality of John Weber and Susanna Weber, his wife, and their children, John. Jake, Christian. Christina, Salome and Dorothea, together with Salome's husband. Charles Wagner, and two children. Charles and Catherine (now Mrs. Frank Schneider), and Dorothea's husband, Mathias Bauer, and their son, John Leonhard Kruezer, and his wife, nee Susanna Weber, at that time lived in Kilkenny with their two children. A little colony was formed in the northern part of Morristown township, and braving the hardships of pioneer life, the people established the foundations of their future prosperity. July 27. the first child in this colony was born to Jacob Bauer. In September, 1866, a wedding was celebrated between Gerhart Niebel and Christina Weber. In August, 1868, Rev. C. G. T. Krause, of Faribault, having heard that these people were Lutherans, arrived at John Weber's home, and in the evening held service in Mr. Weber's log hut. making arrangements to come every third Sunday.....organized a church in the Weber settlement, at the home of Matthias Bauer. The first members were: Charles Wagner, Sr., Matthias Bauer, John Weber, Jake Weber, Christ Bauer, Gottlieb Oehler, Gerhard Xiebel, all of the town of Morristown, with Leonhard Kreuzer, of Kilkenny, and August Spitzack, of Shieldsville.\" etc."
