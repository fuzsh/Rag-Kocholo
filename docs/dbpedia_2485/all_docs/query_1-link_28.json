        "text": "Alexander Kaden Bauer The Great, aka ‘Alex’\n\nDate of Birth - November 18, 2010\n\nSire Alexander Kaden Bauer the Great really is great. This amazing golden retriever is hip certified GOOD, which is a strong health rating. He has a gorgeous coat - red with handsome blonde highlights. His hair flows like silk in the breeze. Believe me, he’s handsome and he knows it!\n\nAlex is one hot ladies' man. He is a gentle sire with a flirtatious playfulness, which really attracts the ladies. Breeding time or not, he enjoys running and playing with the ladies, as he bounces all about showing off his stuff.\n\nBeing the typical golden, this big boy loves people. He has enjoyed strutting his stuff in over 60 parades, as he holds his head high moving person to person for a quick pet or praise. He gets a big kick out of visiting nursing care facilities, hospitals, schools and festivals. I think being a social butterfly is his favorite role.\n\nSpeaking of being a people dog, this smart dog has mastered his service role in the arena of behavioral health. He works as a subbing servicer when in need. If a dog has been injured, retired or becomes ill leaving a client alone, Alex kindly steps up to service until a permanent replacement has been appointed.\n\nAll in all, he does it all: breeds, services, socializes and above all loves, loves his life. Owning him is an honor, loving him is my privilege.\n\nAvenue Grace Bauer, aka ‘Ava’\n\n​Date of Birth - March 23, 2014\n\nAvenue Grace is so incredibly special. She carries her mom, Anna's, disposition in that she is a loving, playful and spirited golden. This gorgeous girl, born March 23, 2014 took our family by surprise as she was absolutely breathtaking in beauty and brilliance. Her coat carried a soft cream tone with light red highlights. It was so soft to touch that my hand would glide across her body with grace. It was as though she was an angel sent by my dad to share a life of quality and kindness. Being she was born on my dad's birthday, we were certain of her heart's purpose.\n\nAva is our largest girl, weighing in at 113lbs. She is truly worth her weight in gold. Our big girl has enjoyed two very important roles: motherhood and servicing. She has found a clever way of linking these arenas into one. Though she is a great puppy mom, sharing her life with her pups as a super mom who loves, teaches and plays with her pups whole heartedly, her favorite role as a mom is to mother her recipient, our son, Michael.\n\nMichael was born with a serious health condition entitled ‘double malasia’. This is a breathing condition. He had been causing some trouble regarding the use of his equipment. The alarms on his machines were alerting, for no apparent reason. The hospital placed cameras to investigate the issue. Our son had been removing his breathing mask and pulsox finger sensor and placing them on his teddy bear. What a naughty boy. We had to find a way to cope with his actions. I felt the answer was to work with a service dog. Ava trained quickly, learning to alert if he wasn't breathing correctly. This beauty has worked hard to watch over her human pup, keeping him in line and very safe.\n\nTraining normally details making certain the pup or dog knows the human is in charge, but in the relationship between Ava and Michael, it is quite the opposite, she is his boss, his mom; a great pair these two. She is like a guardian angel loving and caring for her child.\n\nI thank God for this golden. Owning her is an honor, as she has proven her mark of gold began in heaven and shall return there once again, but not until her work here on earth is done.\n\nAbagale Karicia Rubbi Bauer, aka ‘Abby’\n\nDate of Birth - October 2, 2010\n\nAbby is our little love. She was born on October 2, 2010. She was chosen for her adorably chubby belly and spunky disposition. Abby is our smallest golden girl, weighing in at 62lbs. Her size may be small, but she carries a big attitude. This beautiful lady is strong willed, very energetic and happy to please.\n\nAbby has enjoyed her role as a loving mom. She gets so excited when playing with her pups. She likes teaching them new skills and playing silly tricks on her babies. I think I myself have learned a great deal from this smart sweetheart.\n\nI am certain motherhood has been her life's priority, but her love of people is a close second. She has been a highly skilled hunter, ready to hunt for dinner or enjoy a day walking in the woods. She sure knows how to get the job done.\n\nServicing has built an amazing life for this golden girl. She is in great demand at numerous care facilities, hospitals and schools. She is so spoiled, as she walks about room to room collecting snacks, pets and praises for being the best little golden girl. She doesn't mind sharing a kiss or two and a few light massages for treats. Her heart just melts away the medical hardships to make room for positive experiences.\n\nAnastacia Kimberli Rose Bauer, aka ‘Anna’\n\n​Date of Birth - October 2, 2010\n\nAnna, born October 2, 2010, is Abby's litter mate. These two ladies share many similarities: beauty, friendliness, motherhood and love for their recipients. They do however, have a few differences as well. Anna is much more the social butterfly, than her sister. This gorgeous golden girl is ready for action at any festival, parade, hospital, school or park. She isn't choosey. Show her a person and she will show them all the love and assistance they can handle. She takes control of all situations, which secures a safe and successful environment for her recipient. Anna is the boss, proving her abilities in all of her arenas: breed, service and pet. She is so good at everything it is hard to tell which role she enjoys the most.\n\nMotherhood is her gift to us. She is the most loving mom. I enjoy watching her play with her pups. Anna gets so excited when she plays games with her babies. It is her favorite way of teaching them life skills. She really inspects people when they come to select her little loves. I admire the manner in which she gets to know a person before she allows one of her pups to play with a stranger. Anna is protective, but social, always willing to give someone a try. She just demands the best for her babies.\n\nI am so proud to own this happy go lucky love bug. She makes life cheerful and comfortable, improving the quality of life for everyone she touches. Heart to heart, Anna loves being Anna, the best of the best!"
