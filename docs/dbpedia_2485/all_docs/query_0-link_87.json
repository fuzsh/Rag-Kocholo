        "text": "In 1932, my great grandmother Eri Etta (Byler) Yoder was 81 years old and lived in her own home at 1624 S. Eighth St. in Goshen, Indiana, along with her two daughters, Mary Yoder Burkhard and Anna Yoder. Mary Burkhard (my grandmother) was a retired missionary to India. Anna was an elementary teacher at nearby Parkside Elementary School. In September, my grandmother (Mary) wrote a newsy letter to my mother, Esther. One of the news items was that Mary Byler, a cousin, was visiting. She was a good friend of Mary’s daughter, Anna Lois, who was also visiting at the time. Anna Lois was also single. The girls would go out most nights on dates with young men that were very interested in them. In the words of my grandmother (Mary Burkhard), here is what happened on two evenings:\n\n“Mary staid till Sunday evening and the girls had a great time last week. John Planks and Jesse Richener took them out time and again. They brot them in rather late and one evening and the door was locked. Whoever unlocked the door on Sunday didn’t change the night-lock. They were terribly mortified to have to have some one open for them. We thot it a good joke on them.\n\n“The next evening they wanted to be sure they could get in without disturbing us. Grandma was equal to the occasion and proposed a joke. She said, “I wouldn’t want to lock them out but I would like to do something to make a noise. Anna and I fell right in and the three of us together did it. Grandma got a big pasteboard box. I got some playthings and a string. We put them in. Grandma said that wouldn’t make noise enough. She got some pie tins and an empty coffee can. We laughed as we haven’t laughed for a long time and behind Grandma’s back Anna & I laughed still more because of Grandma’s enthusiasm & leadership. We left the inside door open, put the box on the stair post & tied a string to the box and fastened the string to the screen door hook. Grandma said, “We don’t need to lock, if anyone tries to get in we will hear them.\n\n“After we were in bed, lo and behold! The doorbell rang. Before Anna got to the door—the Postman—for it was the Postman—said, “Special Delivery.” He didn’t wait for Anna to open, pulled the screen door and bang! He was scared terribly. Anna told him we had set a trap for some girls that were out late. Well, we had another good laugh!\n\n“The girls thot they’d get home earlier, but they didn’t. They were riding, then at John Planks & sang and about midnight Olive wanted something to eat so they went to Elkhart and waited—and had Chop Suey. So, it was later than before. I fell asleep but got awake before they got home & from my window saw them stop in the road in front of Harrys on the other side of the street. I watched & all this time they all tried so hard to be quiet. And when the girls opened the door, of course it went bang! They were shocked & amused & mortified and puzzled. Didn’t know the next morning what they would meet or what they would say. Well, it worked. They enjoyed the joke & I guess it did good too. Anna Lois said she never had such a good joke played on her all her life.“\n\nGreat reporting by Mary! And pretty good humor for an 81 year-old, I would say! Great grandma Yoder went on to live another six years, before passing away. Mary Byler went on to marry Jesse Rychener and they had a long and successful marriage. Mary and Anna Lois remained fast friends the rest of their lives. Both were music teachers and had families. More than fifty years later they played duets on the piano at talent nights at our family reunions. And they were good! They were a fun bunch!\n\nIt was a cold winter night in early 1955, when Bob Martin, in his first year as band director at UHS, assembled six of us boys from the band at Mike Cummins house with the idea of us forming a dance band similar to what Martin and his own friends had. Wayne Kimmel played tenor sax; Mike Cummins, trumpet; John Kauffman, trombone; Jerry Montgomery, string bass; Keith Humphreys, drums; and myself on the piano. Martin’s idea took hold of us, and we diligently rehearsed “Tenderly” many times. We thought we could become something, so we pooled some money together and sent off an order to New York for some real dance band music. Live dance bands in the 1950s were very popular even in small towns like Urbana. Even though Martin helped us start, we were not a school function, so there was a possibility we could be a band for hire like his.\n\nAfter rehearsing about a dozen or so songs of this new music, we got a Saturday night job at the Odd Fellows lodge on the second floor of a building on the first block of East Court Street. We play 9 PM to midnight and received $60 for our efforts. We were excited! But this first money went to ordering more music. Who wants a dance band that can play only a dozen or so songs over and over! With more music and rehearsals, we started performing for dances at the high school, the Masonic Temple and some other venues around in the county. It was a challenge for a bunch of teenage boys—and we had our differences—but we stuck together and it was a lot of fun. We called ourselves “The Barons.” I don’t know why the name was picked, but it stuck and that is how people knew us.\n\nA short time later, Les Mesler replaced Mike at trumpet, and classmate Pat Blankenship was an occasional vocalist. Most rehearsals were at my house on Washington Avenue. I don’t know how my mother put up with all that noise. She was a saint! I was the “director,” mainly because no one else wanted to do it. We usually played three numbers for a “set,” two “slows” and a “fast,” which translates to two popular ballads and one “rock an’ roll.” As “director,” I named the songs (and was overruled a lot) and gave the starting tempo. Looking back I think it was rather amazing that we teenagers could organize such a band and keep it going. But we did get jobs—and we were pretty cheap! We probably played six to eight dances during each of our junior and senior years. And if you have a 1957 “Tower,” you can see a picture of us, all dressed up in our suits, including bow ties, and ready to play.\n\nGraduation in 1957 broke the band up, but our last gig was in October 1957 for a dance at Mechanicsburg High School. We were scattered at various colleges (Capital, Ohio State and Miami), but we all made it there, which turned out to be a real challenge because the piano was tuned a good half note too low and the guys could not tune their horns to it. So I had to transpose everything a half step higher.\n\nFour of us, Les, John, Keith and I, still get together for occasional lunches in Urbana to reminisce, tell lies and remember the good ol’ times. Of the others, Mike and Wayne have passed away and Jerry lives in California and is not in good health.\n\nMy fourth great grandfather, Jacob Burkhart (1746-1821), and his wife, Maria or Mary (nee Hershey), had seven children, five sons and two daughters. They all appeared to have been born and raised on Jacob’s plantation in Caernarvon Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and they all eventually left this farm to go to other places. They all married. All five sons had children. I have not yet researched to see if the two daughters had children. I do not know why all of the sons chose to move to other areas rather than stay on this land. The farm and farmland in Caernarvon Township where Jacob had his land was and is still very productive.\n\nThe eldest, Jacob (Jr.) (1776-1863) , bought 135 acres from his father 1799 and then sold out in 1814 and moved to Cumberland County near Newville for the rest of his life.\n\nNext oldest, my ancestor John (1778-1857), moved to neighboring Brecknock Township early on and was on the tax rolls as a married man as soon as 1806. I am trying my best right now to determine where his land was, but he did his descendants no favors by never recording his deeds, both when he bought and when he sold land. When he died in 1857 he was retired and lived with his oldest son, Jacob.\n\nNumber three son was Peter (1780-1834). In 1820 he and his own family moved to Ontario, Canada, where he lived the rest of his life.\n\nNumber four son was David (1782-1854). In 1812, he bought 129 acres from his father. He then sold out in 1832 to move to nearby Leacock Township. He is buried near Bareville, Pennsylvania.\n\nJoseph (1789-1862), the youngest, bought the original plantation of 140 acres from his father in 1819 and held it until 1836 when he sold out to go to Franklin County to live near Upper Strasburg the rest of his life. He and his wife, Susanna (nee High), are buried at the Upper Strasburg Mennonite Church Cemetery, now located on the grounds of the Letterkenny Army Depot. This is now restricted federal government land. I was told you can visit this cemetery only once a year during Memorial Day weekend and only on an escorted military bus.\n\nFive sons. But no one to stay on their father’s land. These Burkhart men seem to want to move away from their parent’s home and influence. However, their father also moved away from where he grew up in Warwick Township. And then succeeding generations, these men continued to move to other places. John’s son, Christian (my 2nd great grandfather), moved from Brecknock Township, Lancaster County, to Brecknock Township, Berks County, and then back to Earl Township in Lancaster County. His son, Daniel, my great grandfather, left Lancaster County as a single young man and moved to Illinois. He married there and then moved to Nebraska for the rest of his life. His son, Jacob, my grandfather, taught school for a while in Nebraska and then after a year of college at the Elkhart Institute in Elkhart, Indiana, dedicated his life to mission work and worked as a Mennonite missionary in India (and died there at age 32).\n\nWere these five sons close to one another? We do not know. The first four were born at two year intervals from each other. One would think that they must have interacted a lot with each other. They certainly would have worked together on the many tasks required on a farm. And they all stayed farmers. But once they went their separate ways we have no records that would give us any information whether they even again saw each other.\n\nJacob, the oldest, also lived the longest. He lived from the time of the American Revolutionary War to the time of the American Civil War. All the others were born after the Revolutionary War or died before the Civil War.\n\nMy father-in-law, Harold Leland Yochum, was a man of his time and ahead of his time. In 1961, in the Alumni Bulletin of Capital University, he wrote an article about Federal aid to colleges and universities. This was a becoming a big issue for all schools at that time, and many were most willing to accept this new so-called “free” money. But as president of Capital at that time, he was dead set against it. In his view, there were several problems involving a loss of independence and a drift toward the welfare state. Boy was he right! He won the battle on this in 1961, but by 1969 when he retired from Capital he had lost the war, and Capital was then accepting Federal money. Capital, along with almost every college and university in this great land now accepts Federal funding in most aspects for their institutions. However, a little more than a week ago, I had a conversation with Dr. Beth Paul, current president of Capital, where she informed me that some schools are thinking about eschewing Federal aid. But if any would do so, it would be a difficult road. The only two schools that I know that do not currently accept Federal aid: Hillsdale College in Michigan and Grove City College in Pennsylvania.

Yochum_Harold_1961_Cap_Bulletin_p2\n\nHans Bauer/Bower, of Colebrookdale Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, my 5th great grandfather, died in the winter of 1748-1749. For a very long time it has been presumed that he was born about 1670 in Oberhofen, Switzerland, immigrated to Holland in 1711 and then to America in 1717. Indeed, Lister and Edna Weiss, in their book “Trail of the Pioneers, a History and Genealogy of Hans Bauer and his Descendants,” published in 1952, adhered to this premise, although they admitted in a footnote that they had no authentic proof of this assumption. And on the basis of this book, there are now literally hundreds of family trees on various sites on the internet that presume this fact. But they are wrong!\n\nThe work of Michael Georg de Boer of the Netherlands in the 1940s proves otherwise.\n\nDe Boer, a descendant of the Hans Baur born in Oberhofen, was a university-trained historian who looked at all the primary source documentation about Hans Baur in the Netherlands down to his children and back to a marriage in 1542 at the parish of Hilterfingen in Switzerland. He published his results in 1947 in a Swiss journal in an article entitled: “Vom Thunersee zum Sappemeer. Ein Täufer- und Auswandererschicksal aus drei Jahrhundereten” in “Berner Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Heimatkunde,” Vol. 9 (1947) pp. 1-24.\n\nDe Boer states that Hans Baur of Oberhofen, born about 1670, was the son of Hans Baur, born December 4, 1625, and his second wife Margaretha from Wald, who died June 3, 1711. His parents were married August 17, 1657. Hans married (on Feb. 19, 1702) Anna Willener of Sigriswil, baptized Oct. 28, 1648, daughter of Heinrich Willener and his wife Verena Kempf. De Boer states that his research shows that when the Baur family reached Holland, they stayed there, including all of their children.\n\nCivil records in Holland show that Hans and Anna Baur purchased property in Sappemeer in 1712 and 1714. They purchased another piece of land in 1738. In 1751 a land transaction mentions the Baur heirs, thus indicating that Hans Baur had died. They had four children, all of whom married there into other immigrant families. Those marriages are well documented by de Boer. De Boer is descendant from Hans’ son Abraham, and his wife Trijntje Stähli.\n\nIn the book “History of the Bernese Anabaptists” by Ernst Müller, published in 1895, it lists that a Hans Bauer, a vineyard farmer from Oberhofen, 41 years old, Reformed, his wife, Anna Willener, 34 years old, two sons and two daughters, all left Basel, Switzerland, on 13 July 1711, aboard the ship “Neuenberger,” for Amsterdam, Holland. They were part of a mass expulsion of Anabaptists from Switzerland at that time. After arriving in Amsterdam, they subsequently settled in Sapemeer, Holland. It appears that this is the reference from Müller that the Weiss’s used in assuming that the two Hans Bauers were one and the same person.\n\nThey should have researched further, for Müller states that Hans Bauer of Sappemeer had two sons and two daughters in 1711. Their names were Christian, Barbara, Abraham and Margaret. Hans Bauer of Colebrookdale, on the other hand, had only two sons, Samuel and Hans Jr., in 1711, and no daughters. Subsequently, our Colebrookdale Bauer had another son, Abraham born in 1712, a daughter Barbara born in 1716, another son, Michael, born in 1718, and another daughter, Susannah, born in 1720. All six of the Colebrookdale children are mentioned in Hans Bauer’s will in 1748. So the children of these two men were different in name, number, gender and reported birth years.\n\nConcerning land purchases, Hans Bauer of Colebrookdale Township, purchased a number of tracts of land at various times in what was then Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and now part of Washington Township, Berks County. In 1734 he warranted 150 acres from the Penn brothers, in 1742 he warranted another 150 acres, and in 1743 he bought 215 acres from Henry Hopkinson, a land speculator from Philadelphia. It would have been next to impossible for the same ordinary person to purchase land in Pennsylvania and Holland on two different continents in these time frames.\n\nTherefore, it is concluded that it is not possible that the Hans Bauer of Colebrookdale and Hans Baur of Oberhofen are one and the same person. And many searches by many persons for more information on the origin of Hans Bauer of Colebrookdale, so far, have been fruitless. We do not know his parents’ names, nor the date and location of his birth.\n\nHans Bauer of Colebrookdale is buried in the Washington Schwenkfelder burial ground in Clayton, now in Berks County, Pennsylvania, several miles distant from his extensive land holdings. His original grave marker has been replaced with a very nice granite monument that states that he is a “First Immigrant.” We know that he was a Mennonite and not of the Scwenkfelder faith, but George Sholtz, a friend and neighbor and co-executor of his will, was a Schwenkfelder.\n\nSources:\n\nDe Boer, Michael Georg, “Vom Thunersee zum Sappemeer.
