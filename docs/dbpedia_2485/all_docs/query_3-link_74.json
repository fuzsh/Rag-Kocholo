        "text": "A company that hired Massachusetts-based employees of a competitor and allegedly aided and abetted them in violating their restrictive covenants and fiduciary duties could not be liable under Chapter 93A because the conduct giving rise to the claim occurred “primarily and substantially” outside the state.\n\nThe Appeals Court made that determination in a 23-page decision in FTI, LLC, et al. v. Duffy, et al., Lawyers Weekly No. 11-066-24.\n\nIn 2016, defendants Robert Duffy, Stephen Coulombe and Elliot Fuhr, employees of plaintiff FTI Consulting, left to join defendant Berkeley Research Group, taking with them numerous FTI employees and clients.\n\nMassachusetts residents Duffy and Coulombe were based out of FTI’s Boston office while Fuhr, based in New York, supervised Massachusetts employees. The three traveled frequently, working with clients across the country.\n\nFTI filed suit, alleging that the individual defendants had violated their noncompetes and other restrictive covenants in their employment agreements. FTI also alleged that Berkeley Research Group violated Chapter 93A by encouraging the individual defendants to collect FTI’s confidential information and share it with their new employer and by using such information to recruit FTI employees and clients.\n\nA Superior Court jury ordered BRG to pay $12 million in compensatory damages on FTI’s aiding and abetting and 93A claims, and $18 million in punitive damages on the 93A claim.\n\n“In sum, ‘the center of gravity of the circumstances that g[a]ve rise to the claim’ was not here.”\n\n— Appeals Court\n\nBut the Appeals Court reversed, finding that the “center of gravity” giving rise to the claim was not in Massachusetts.\n\n“BRG, and those acting at the behest of BRG, executed most of [their] scheme during meetings that took place outside Massachusetts,” Judge Vickie L. Henry wrote for the panel. “The individual defendants first met with BRG in Washington, D.C. Additional in-person meetings occurred in New York City. Duffy’s contract with BRG, which the jury could have found included a bonus that incentivized him to bring over FTI’s employees, was signed in New York City. The recruiter who led BRG’s efforts, including the recruitment of other FTI employees, was located predominately in Washington, D.C. While Duffy aided BRG’s efforts by collecting FTI’s confidential information and giving it to BRG, he ‘liv[ed] out of suitcases’ and could have collected FTI’s confidential information anywhere in his travels.”\n\n‘Center of gravity’\n\nBRG’s attorney, Aliki Sofis of Boston, offered no comment other than to say she and her clients were pleased with the decision.\n\nNew York attorney John Siegal, who represented FTI, referred interview requests to an FTI spokesperson, who said the company does not comment on litigation matters.\n\nBut Boston business litigator Eric P. Magnuson said the decision underscores the “importance of focus” when a court conducts a “center of gravity” analysis under 93A.\n\n“Courts and litigants must zero in on where the wrongful conduct and its effects occurred,” Magnuson said. “Lawful conduct is sifted away. A defendant’s mere connections to Massachusetts, then, are not enough. The connections must be the stuff of an actionable Chapter 93A claim, something the Appeals Court decided was absent here.”\n\nMichael J. Lambert of Boston offered a similar take.\n\n“The appellate court found that the focus of the inquiry on a 93A claim against BRG could not simply be on an individual employee’s connections to the Boston office,” Lambert said. “As with all 93A claims, the proper focus is the center of gravity of the circumstances that gave rise to the claim and where the resulting harm was sustained. Here, the individual defendant’s tenuous connection to FTI’s Boston office was not enough to bring the claim against BRG within 93A.”\n\nI think a lot of courts would have found that [the conduct] occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts, and the ‘living out of a suitcase’ argument probably wouldn’t carry the day.\n\nBurlington lawyer David B. Mack said the decision makes clear that a company cannot necessarily look to Chapter 93A to protect its interests just because it has a presence in Massachusetts, even if that presence is significant.\n\n“Even in this era of the remote workplace, the location of in-person meetings still matters,” Mack said. “The brazen conduct of the defendants had a serious impact on the plaintiff’s Massachusetts office, but this was a case between two large companies headquartered out of state, with clients and offices all over the country.”\n\nHowever, John R. Bauer of Boston saw potential controversy in the court’s apparent finding that there could not be unfair competition in the case given that the focus was on the conduct of Duffy, who lived in Massachusetts, had contact with other Massachusetts FTI employees, accessed documents in Massachusetts, and ultimately played an important role in convincing Massachusetts employees to leave one employer and join another.\n\n“This decision really does suggest that salespeople who travel the country pretty extensively can immunize themselves in some way from Massachusetts law by traveling a lot,” he said. “I think a lot of courts would have found that [the conduct] occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts, and the ‘living out of a suitcase’ argument probably wouldn’t carry the day.”\n\nMass departure\n\nFTI is a Maryland consulting firm headquartered in Washington, D.C. BRG is a Delaware competitor headquartered in California.\n\nBoth firms perform work for clients across the country, including financial analysis and assistance with mergers and acquisitions.\n\nIn or around December 2015, a BRG recruiter reached out to Duffy, apparently to discuss Duffy joining the company.\n\nDuffy subsequently informed Coulombe and Fuhr of his conversations with the recruiter, and the three met with BRG in Washington in January 2016.\n\nDuring negotiations, Duffy apparently told BRG that acquiring him was like “buying a business” and that most of his clients would follow him.\n\nIn April 2016, the three individual defendants signed employment agreements with BRG.\n\nDuffy’s agreement, signed in New York, included a bonus he could earn by bringing in employees.\n\nAll three individual defendants’ agreements provided that they would not use confidential information or trade secrets of any party other than BRG, nor would they breach prior restrictive covenants.\n\nThe next day, the three defendants resigned from FTI in a joint phone call.\n\nIn hiring Duffy, BRG apparently sought to acquire other FTI employees and clients. The trial judge in the underlying case, in fact, found that Duffy had actively participated in such efforts, using FTI’s confidential information to do so while still working out of its Boston office.\n\nEvidence also suggested that Coulombe created, and Duffy maintained, a spreadsheet memorializing such efforts. It was apparently saved under the file name “Super Bowl” and listed confidential information about employees’ compensation, revenue generation, offers made by BRG, and descriptions of whether they were “definite,” “probable” or “likely” recruits.\n\nThe trial judge found that with the individual defendants’ help, BRG succeeded in convincing 36 billing professionals to leave FTI, half of whom came from the FTI Boston office.\n\nFollowing trial, a jury found the individual defendants liable for breach of contract and BRG liable for tortious interference.\n\nJudge Kenneth W. Salinger additionally found BRG liable for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties and 93A violations.\n\nThe jury awarded FTI $21 million in compensatory damages against all defendants. Salinger awarded $12 million in compensatory damages against BRG for aiding and abetting and 93A violations, and $18 million in punitives under 93A. He also stated that $12 million was “subsumed” within the jury award.\n\nBRG’s appeal followed.\n\nOut of state conduct\n\nThe Appeals Court panel found that BRG could not be found liable under 93A because the conduct that might give rise to such a claim did not occur “primarily and substantially” in Massachusetts.\n\nMost such conduct, which involved encouraging the individual defendants to collect FTI’s confidential information and give it to BRG, including through the “Super Bowl” spreadsheet, and using such information to poach FTI employees and clients, occurred through meetings in Washington and New York, the panel said, noting that the recruiter who led BRG’s efforts was located in Washington as well\n\nAs to Duffy’s actions on behalf of BRG, he “lived out of suitcases” and could have collected FTI’s confidential information from anywhere in his travels.\n\n“In sum, ‘the center of gravity of the circumstances that g[a]ve rise to the claim’ was not here,” Henry wrote. “Rather, this is a case where most of the wrongful conduct was ‘received and acted on’ outside Massachusetts by an out-of-State business, and where the injury was felt by another out-of-State business from employee and client defections across the country.”"
