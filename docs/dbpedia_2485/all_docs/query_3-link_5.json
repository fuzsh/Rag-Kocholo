        "text": "Week35-36: …You know, chillin’.\n\nI have spent the last couple weeks getting things ready for the art show in D.C. and writing more of my Born to Rewild book.

Don’t freak out now, it won’t kill me. I found out a while ago, but haven’t said anything because I wanted to learn more about it before sharing something this personal with the world. They call it, “basal cell carcinoma.” It refers …\n\nContinue reading “Urban Scout Discovers Cure For Cancer!”\n\nTo a Future More Feral Than Fiction\n\nI thought I would post my the text of the intro I gave to the Road Warrior at the film center. I hoped to film it, but that sort of fell through. Anyway, enjoy!\n\nBack to the Feral Future\n\nRoad Warrior Sunday October 28th, 7pm, $7 WHITSELL AUDITORIUM 1219 SW Park Avenue Portland, OR 97205 This Sunday (October 28th) I have the pleasure of introducing Road Warrior (the sequel to Mad Max) at the Eco-Sicko film series.
