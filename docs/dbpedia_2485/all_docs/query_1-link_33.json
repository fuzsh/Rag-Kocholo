        "text": "Everything Coming Up Bauers\n\nI recently got a copy of a Guiding Light Storyline Proposal from April 1969. It was written by Soderberg-Summer. The story prospective covers the several future major stories. One is the set up for the Ed – Leslie (Rick’s mom) – Mike (Awesomesauce) triangle. I still have 0 opinion of her. Anyone who marries Ed when Mike is available (as he was when she married Ed) is a complete and total idiot. Another big storyline which is covered lightly here is Bill Bauer’s death. They’re talking about the expected aftermath for Bert and the rest of the Bauer family. There is also talk about Charlotte Wearing including her car accident and potential future. They recommend that when Mike will marry Charlotte that Hope and Charlotte will make each other miserable as step-daughter and step-mother.\n\nSara McIntyre\n\nThe other story they dig into is the Sara McIntyre’s storyline. It’s weird to me that I watch old episodes and I remember every single other character on the episode, sometimes the action in the episode, but I have NO idea who this Sara is. She works at the hospital. She is in a relationship with Joe Wexler and they are bringing in a new character Lee Gantry. When they were doing quick episode cuts for the last big anniversary was of Gantry being killed. They lay out a year plus of potential story.\n\nFletcher Family Farewell\n\nThey are also starting to wrap up the Fletcher family. Peggy Fletcher and her son will be the last one standing, but they’re talking about moving on to the Wexlers as a replacement core family for the Fletchers.\n\nEd’s Self-Knowledge\n\nI hope to retype the entire document so I can share it at some point, but for now I wanted to give you a rundown because of one sentence. I think it’s a critical piece of understanding about Ed Bauer almost all the way through his run on the show.\n\nThrough Jackson and Bert, Leslie is pulled back toward Ed to help Ed during this crucial period in his life. Ed, at the same time, has begun to discover the secret of his sickness — it’s his refusal to become an adult and assume the responsibilities built into the condition of adulthood. Bill’s death may contribute to a hastening of this realization. Bert’s reliance on Ed can also contribute to his growth as an adult.\n\nEd also develops a deep insight into Leslie — and he knows she is trying to help him — and this time, he can ACCEPT her help. This acceptance is what traps Leslie.\n\nWe will play a period of time when Leslie is torn between the two-men [Ed and Mike] — both worthy men, and in their own ways, both needy men.\n\nAnd the bolded sentence I think clearly shows what’s the matter with Ed, why he drinks, why (like his father) he’s always looking for another woman to solve his problems, and why he’ll never be as awesomesauce as Mike.\n\nRick Comes Along\n\nWe also get a rundown on how we got Rick, I mean then Freddie.\n\n[Leslie] returns to Ed on a tentative basis — but a strange thing happens, Ed seduces is own wife during this interval period.\n\nLeslie becomes pregnant.\n\nEd is overjoyed by her pregnancy — overjoyed for Leslie — who has always wanted a child, and overjoyed for himself because this is the final proof of his maturity. He wants the child as much as Leslie ever wanted a child.\n\n—\n\nLeslie thinks the child is Ed’s — and now she is committed to Ed.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

They ended up dreaming up a long-lost half-sister and a suddenly close cousin (Hillary and Johnny respectively), but we should have seen more Bauers grow up. Ed had two children and Mike only one. Still there was a decent number of Bauer family members besides Michelle and Rick even if they weren’t on the show when Manny began. Where were they?\n\nMama Bauer, Michelle’s Great-Grandmother, died of cancer a couple of years after the family was introduced back in the 1940s.\n\nPapa Friedrich Bauer, Michelle’s Great-Grandfather, served as the moral center of the show for many years. He passed the role on to his daughter-in-law Bert at his death in the early 1970s.\n\nBill Bauer, Michelle’s Grandfather, let’s face it Bill was a disappointment. He had it in him to be a good person and he was smart and an excellent brother, but his lack of self-confidence and his seeking consolation in a bottle or the closest woman’s bed when things didn’t go just his way undercut his entire life. He took this to an extreme when he faked his death in a plane crash and later emerged again in Springfield with a double secret grown daughter in tow. He was later killed for real before Michelle was born by Annabelle Simms Reardon’s father when he went nuts.\n\nBert Bauer, Grandma Bert, Michelle’s Grandmother, was the heart of the show for decades. From 1949 thru 1984 she was played by Charita Bauer — over 3 decades. While she had been kind of whiny and schemey as a young wife wanting to live like she was in House Beautiful magazine, she matured greatly over the years and became the kind of person everyone wants for a grandmother, challenging you to be your best and being a soft shoulder to cry on when needed. Besides the double death of her husband and all his infidelities, Bert underwent a pap smear saving countless women’s lives in real life by encouraging the practice and having lost a leg to diabetes and learned to walk again which was also written in for her character. Charita Bauer who played her, died unexpectedly, and the character was kept alive for another year, partially so she could hold Michelle in her arms (off screen) before she died.\n\nMeta Bauer, Michelle’s Great-Aunt, her first husband Ted White and her second husband Joe Roberts with her step-daughter Kathy was the focus of the show up through the 1960s with Meta then leaving town seemingly for good after Papa Bauer’s funeral in 1973. But when soap opera icon Mary Stuart became available after her trademark soap Search for Tomorrow was cancelled she brought Meta back. Sadly Meta seemed to have forgotten a good deal of her history (including her son Chuckie and the husband she killed Ted White), but how can you NOT love or need the Aunt Meta she created. She is well known to Mannyacs.\n\nTrudy Bauer, Michelle’s Great-Aunt, was the Bauers’ answer to Jan Brady (but Trudy did it first) she left town back in 1966. She was contacted several times later and Meta went to stay with her for awhile in New York City lastly while Mary Stuart was in the Meta role, but she was never seen on screen again.\n\nEd Bauer, Michelle’s father, was doing charity work in Africa. He’d been recast with a guy who played Ed in the 1960s and dropped in and out “volunteering time in Africa.” Eventually that Ed and the show part ways. They actually pretend he maintained connection even though they didn’t specifically say he’d reached out or showed him on screen until the start of Manny. At that point they say he’s been out of touch. Later when he returns to the canvas they said he started back home and got captured on the way and apparently no one realized it. Despite the fact that Ross did call him once and got a hold of him during Michelle’s trial. They played fast and loose with that, but that’s later Ed is just not mentioned during this time.\n\nHope Bauer Spaulding, Michelle’s cousin, was part of my second favorite couple of all time Hope and Alan. In story Alan slept with other women despite the fact that he truly loved Hope. His father had really done a number on Alan. Hope was lost when she realized he wouldn’t change and fell into the bottle. She left town, taking Alan-Michael with her. After that she was only ever heard of by brief reference or a one-sided phone call and she was never shown again after she left town in the early 1980s.\n\nMike Bauer, Michelle’s uncle, is awesomesauce and actually later plays an off screen role in the Manny story keeping Robbie while Manny pull a con to get out of the mob all the way. At this time though he had a big government job in Washington, D.C. His last actual appearance in Springfield was at the anniversary party in 1997.\n\nRick Bauer, Michelle’s half-brother, is the only Bauer family who is around at the start of the Manny story. He is somewhat involved, more than any other family member, but is also upset about learning that Kevin wasn’t his kid after all.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

We follow the wonderful Mike Bauer aka Don Stewart‘s life focusing on recent romance. I should mention I’m not exactly how much of this “I want a wife that stays home” stuff is really from Don. It was a major theme of all the soap opera magazines I’ve read from that time in – every – single – interview. So while it might just reflect the mindset of the times, I think it more than likely reflected what the magazines thought their buyers wanted to read. It could be that it fit that mold and be true. It could also be that the interview was hammered into shape to fit that mold. Apparently he married relatively soon after this interview, within a couple of years.\n\nChapter 5\n\nA year ago, when I interviewed Don for the first time, the handsome bachelor confided that he was desperately looking for the right girl to marry and settle down with.\n\n“I think marriage is great,” he said then, his brown eyes reflecting his sincerity. “But it’s difficult to meet people in my business – to meet the type of girl who is attuned to marriage. I think girls are programmed for marriage at an early age. But the girls are programmed for the type of life one has to accept as a wife.”\n\nSince that interview, it has been rumored that Don has found the girl he’s been looking for and that he’s engaged to be married. However, when I sought to confirm the rumor that day in the actor’s CBS dressing room, he shock his head emphatically. “It’s not true,” he assured me. “I’m not engaged and I’m not getting married. I don’t know how that rumor got started. Everything I said to you the last time we talked still goes. I’m still looking for my future wife.”\n\nHe wants, understandably, a girl who is pretty. He’d also like the for her to have blue eyes, be lively and fun, and, while he definitely doesn’t want a Women’s Libber, he expects her to have a mind of her own. “I’d like a girl who is basically strong and knows where she is. I don’t like followers, either in men or women. I wouldn’t mind if my wife worked — I think it’s a good idea if a wife works. But her attitude would have to reflect the importance of being a wife.”\n\nThe latter remark does not mean he would expect her to be his slave. “I’m a male chauvinist, “he admits, adding with a smile, “I believe in ruling with an iron hand – covered with a velvet glove. I think,” he goes on more seriously, “women have always been the boss over men, and always will be. If a woman is feminine, she will always be the rulers. If not, she never will be.”\n\nThe girl who wins Don will have to have a liking for outdoor life, and will have to respect the love of flying that is still very much a part of his live. Don is a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserves, and once a month he flied jets out of Willow Grove Naval Air Station in Philadelphia. “Currently, I’m flying the P-E Orian, which is an anti-submarine patrol plane.”\n\nHe and buddy, Nick Coster (Robert Delany of Another World) sold the boat they owned together, but Don still loves boating, as well as golf and skeet-shooting.\n\nDon is close to his family and tries to make one or two trips a year out to Nebraska. His folks also make a point of catching his nightclub act whenever they can. “Dad and Mom were in Bermuda for a week when I was appearing at the Princess Hotel,” he says. “And my brother George and his wife came to see me at the Rainbow Grill.”\n\nDon and George are partners on the ownership of an enterprise known as Ernie’s Feed and Field Service Store in Storm Lake, Iowa. The store, which George ruins, is very successful, supplying, as it does, farmers with much needed fertilizer, seeds said grains. (Don’s younger brother Jack is an ecologist for the Nebraska Power Company.)\n\nDon also owns a farm in Minnesota where he grows corn, barley, and wheat, so even though he lives in sophisticated New York apartment, the country hasn’t been completely taken out of the boy.\n\nWhat with being an entertainer, a businessman, a farmer, and a weekend pilot, Don’s life is incredibly busy. Too busy, one might suspect, for him to really concentrate on finding that wife he says he wants so much. However, Don insists that the bachelor life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and if his dream girl would only come along, he would manage to find plenty of time to devote to pursuing and winning her. “Being in love is very important to me,” he says earnestly. “I think I am more romantic than any girl I’ve known.”\n\nIt certainly seems a shame for all that romanticism to go to waste!\n\nContinuing our article from Afternoon TV (see citation in the first post). We follow the wonderful Mike Bauer aka Don Stewart‘s life starting with his early years on the show.\n\nChapter 4\n\n“I never thought of the soap as a steeping stone,” Don says now, after five years on The Guiding Light. “I just thought of it as a job.”\n\nAlthough he was replacing another actor in the role of Mike Bauer — a difficult task for anyone — he won favorable audience response right from the beginning. “All the mail I received was favorable,” he confirms happily.\n\nUnaccustomed as he was to doing soap opera, however, he found those early days on the show something less than simple. “Even now I find learning a new script every day very difficult. So at the beginning, it was very hard to get adjusted to the hectic schedule of the show. It takes months to really get relaxed and feel easy in a part. You have to strive for relaxation with a script so the lines will seem real. I’d say that anyone who comes on a show like ours has a difficult time turning out a good performance in the beginning.”\n\nAlthough The Guiding Light is done on tape, it is shot exactly as if it were living, making no excuses for the forgotten lines or mishaps with props. On David Frost’s Festival of Soap Opera, Don recalled one of his more embarrassing bloopers. “My assistant said ‘What’s the matter with Lynell Conway?’ and I was supposed to say, ‘Well, Peter, I think it’s fear. It’s fear that she may tell what she knows and has been sitting on all these months.’ And I forgot to say ‘what she knows.’ I said, ‘It’s fear that she may tell what she’s been sitting on!'”\n\nDon describes Mike as “for right and honor and justice, and a good father, and a veteran.” On the Frost show he revealed that the Guiding Light writers pattern Mike after the character of F. Lee Bailey. “They have taken some of the things that F. Lee Bailey has talked about in his books and things like that. And then they write it into the script and I say, ‘This is the reason that I stand here and so forth, and this is the reason I cross-examine the way I do, and this is the way I staged it, and so forth.’ And this is out of F. Lee Bailey‘s books. They admire his work quite a bit.”\n\nAnd Guiding Light audiences admire Don‘s work. His dark, almost Gothic good looks reap several marriage proposals among his fan mail every week. “It’s the kind of mail I like to get,” he says with a chuckle.\n\nBut, while Don is gratified by his success as Mike, being a soap opera star is the last thing he expected to happen. “I never thought I’d make it as an actor before making it as a singer,” he confesses. He has never stopped pursuing his singing career, and is currently enjoying a great deal of success as a nightclub headliner. He has appeared at such impressive spots as the Princess Hotel in Bermuda, Palumbo’s in Philadelphia, and the Rainbow Grill and the Maisonette in New York City. “People come to hear me because I’m Mike Bauer. Women come out in droves, and I’m very well-received.”\n\nOnce, during a performance at New York’s now defunct Living Room, Don took off his jacket and asked a pretty young lady sitting ringside to hold it for him. “Hold my coat and I’ll pick it up at your house later,” he said with a broad wink. “Of course,” he explains, “I was joking. But she went along with the joke to the extent that she walked out with the coat.” Happily, she returned it to the club the next day and gave up her souvenir.\n\nMore recently, Don was signing autographs after a performance at a club in New Jersey. “A little girl about 13 years old came up and asked for my autograph, and after I gave it to her, I kissed her on the cheek. She looked sort of dazed and she said, ‘Now I’m going to start biting my fingernails again!”\n\nDon decided to go into nightclubs rather than continue trying to make it in Broadway musicals because, with the way theater is today, successful musicals are few and far between, and the ones that make it are usually written with a particular star in mind.\n\n“I went up to audition for a show called, Sugar,” Don says by way of explaining his disillusionment with legitimate theater. “I auditioned four times. The director and writers told me how marvelous I was, and I was starting to think about how I was going to spend all the money I was going to make. At the third audition, I sang a song called ‘I Want To Be Happy,’ which started with the lyrics, ‘I’m a very ordinary man.’ The show is the musical version of Some Like It Hot and the two male stars dress as women. I decided to surprise everybody and go on stage for the audition dressed like a girl. I got a wig from CBS and I rolled my trouser legs up and put my coat on backwards so it looked like a dress. And I went out there dressed in this ridiculous outfit and sang ‘I’m an ordinary man.’ They loved it and called me back for the fourth time. Later, I found out that Tony Roberts had been promised the part of David Merrick months before. So instead of wasting my time going to auditions for parts that had already been cast, I decided to create a nightclub act. And I’ve made more money and gotten as much recognition in a single weekend as I would get in a week in a Broadway show.”\n\nDon has had some help in the arranging of a few of his songs, but for the most part, the act is strictly his own. “I started taking a little of what everyone told me and I ended up writing my own act. So the act is completely mine. I received a lot of help from Earl Wilson and Julie Allen, his secretary. And my conductor is Sal Sicari, who was the conductor at the Copa Cabana.”\n\nSince The Guiding Light takes up so much of Don’s time during the week, he usually has to limit his nightclub engagements to weekends. This is a little frustrating for him since he loves singing so much, but he’s much too loyal to The Guiding Light and his daytime fans to consider parting company with Mike Bauer at this point.\n\n“The Guiding Light has helped to get an audience for me,” he says candidly. “This has been the real force and mainstay. So I don’t feel I should leave the show.”\n\nContinuing our article from Afternoon TV (see citation in the first post). We follow the wonderful Mike Bauer aka Don Stewart‘s life starting with his early years in show business.\n\nChapter 3\n\nAt first his life in New York considered mainly of attending the Hunter College Opera Workshop and singing in the choir at St. Bartholomew’s Church. Then he got a job singing in a quarter at Radio City Music Hall. “I did four shows a day,” he recalls. “I was really in the big time!”\n\nHe left Radio City after a month to join the chorus of the musical, Camelot. It meant doing only one show a night — plus Wednesday and Saturday matinees – but, after all, it was Broadway!\n\n“At the audition, I sang an operatic aria because I didn’t know any other songs to sing. Franz Allers was the conductor, and he was a real stickler on musicianship. The chorus members were all top-notch classical musicians. It was because of my classical training that I got the job.”\n\nWhile in the chorus, he understudied the role of Sir Lionel, and went on in the part a couple of times. Later, he became the understudy for Sir Dinadin and was second understudy for Mordred and Lancelot. He left the show for three months while he did summer stock, then returned to play Sir Dinadin and understudy Robert Goulet as Lancelot. Unfortunately – for Don, that is – Goulet was healthy and reliable, and Don never got the opportunity to sub for him.\n\nAfter Camelot, he went into the off-Broadway hit, The Fantasticks, playing the role of El Gallo for three months. He returned to Broadway to do the lead in The Student Gypsy, which was a spoof on the old operetta days and also featured Dom De Luise, but the show was not a success and lasted only a month.\n\nThe closing of the show in which he had the lead was discouraging, but Don continued to study (by this time he was studying acting with Sandy Meisner) and he kept busy doing summer theater and off-Broadway shows like Babes in the Woods, in which he appeared with Ruth Buzzi. He also understudied the leading role in the Broadway show, Anyone Can Whistle.\n\nIf Don thought being a pilot was a hazardous occupation, he soon found out that things can happen in the theater that are just as unpredictable.\n\n“Once,” he recalls with a smile, “I was playing in The Desert Song – sort of a camp version of it – and I had a deal where I was supposed to take off my sword and lay it on the bed with the frills and all the silk and all that sort of thing. So the first night, being a Method actor, I decided to play it straight, so I took it off and laid the sword on the bed with all those silk things on it. I’m supposed to say ‘Margo, come away with me,’ and of course that was the first night.”\n\n“The second night I decided, being a Method actor, I’m going to try something a little different. Now, mind you, these beds are made out of plywood. I decided not to lay it down, but I was going to throw it down. So I said, “Margo, come away with me.” Crack. And it fell on the bed and the audience broke up because it wasn’t a soft bed at all. It was plywood, and the audience broke up and my leading lady broke up and I broke up. We were in a dead heat for five minutes. Couldn’t say a word.”\n\nDespite such catastrophes – or possibly because of them — Don attracted the attention of Universal Studios and went to Hollywood with a contract in his pocket. The contract was for a year, and during that time he appeared on such TV shows as Dragnet, The Virginian, Loredo, and McHale’s Navy. (Blog Editor’s Note: I’ve got to try and find some of these episodes!) However, the studio lot was overflowing with handsome, young actor types, and Don felt he was “rather lost in the place.” When his contract expired, he stayed on in Hollywood for two more years. “I did a couple of movies,” he says, “but nothing really marvelous.”\n\n“I liked the life in Hollywood — the tennis and the golf and the weather. But the business is a lot different than it is here. And you’re expected to go to so many parties. I don’t drink, so I didn’t go to many of them. But that’s all part of the scene out there, I guess.”\n\nDon‘s career seemed to be in limbo until he was sent to audition for some Procter and Gamble people who were looking for someone to replace the actor who had been playing Michael Bauer on The Guiding Light. Although the show was shot in New York, they hadn’t been able to find the kind of Mike they were looking for there, so they had gone all the way to California to continue their search.\n\nWhen they saw Don Stewart, they knew their search was over. The next thing our guy knew, he was heading back to New York. And television stardom was just around the corner.\n\nContinuing our article from Afternoon TV (see citation in the first post). We follow the wonderful Mike Bauer aka Don Stewart‘s life starting with his boyhood in Nebraska.\n\nChapter 1\n\nChildhood: “I fought a lot.”\n\nAlthough he thinks of Norfolk, Nebraska, as his home town, Donald Bruce Stewart was actually born in Staten Island, New York, on a chilly November 14th. Dr. George Stewart and his wife Marian were already the parents of one son, George, and when Don came along, the arrival of a second healthy son was a real cause for celebration.\n\nPerhaps if he had spent his childhood in the New York area, Don, with his big brown eyes and his shy smile lighting up his eager, little boy’s face, would have found his way into show business earlier. But his parents moved to Norfolk when he was four, and he grew up amid farm lands, fresh air, and wide open spaces.\n\nWhen you ask him what kind of a kid he was, he’ll tell you that he fought a lot. “I remember we had a new kid on the block named George Kendall. I went up to him and said, “Tell me your name or I’ll beat you up.”\n\n“He said, “better not, ’cause my Uncle Bruce is looking out the window.\n\n“Actually, I didn’t want to beat him up anyway. I just didn’t know what else to say. How do you meet people when you’re a little kid? You don’t go up and introduce yourself.”\n\nDon also fought with brother George, to his disadvantage. “I was the only kid on the block he’d beat up,” he says, shaking his head. “The others, he felt sorry for.” Fortunately, Don also had a younger brother, Jack, who was NOT able to beat him up.\n\nDon‘s childhood ambition was to become a pilot (“I wanted them to lower the age requirement to seven years old during World War II so I could join the Air Force”) and, lucky for him, his father had his own private plane. Don began going up with him when he was fourteen. “I got my solo license when I was sixteen, and I got my pilot license when I was seventeen. We used to have fly-in breakfasts, when all the people who had planes around the countryside would fly to a particular airport for breakfast.”\n\nDr. Stewart was proud of his son’s competence in the cockpit, but he was not above administering discipline to the young pilot if he thought it was needed. “My parents were not terribly strict, but my dad was boss and we all knew it,” Don says. “I remember once I was out playing with George Kendall and my dad wanted me to do something. I said, ‘I’m busy.’ My dad said, ‘You’re going to do it or we’re going out to the woodshed.’ We had a woodshed out back, I said, ‘Oh, we’re going to cut some wood, huh?’ Well, I saw black. That was the last time I ever sassed him back.”\n\nDon doesn’t remember exactly when he started singing, but he does remember he was too shy to let anyone hear his early efforts. “In junior high school, I remember thinking that I had a better voice than the other kids, but I wouldn’t sing for anyone to show them. Anyway nobody cared. Mostly, I’d sing in the shower when my parents were out. But sometimes, if my friend Jerry Moss, who played the piano, was at our place and the family was just sitting around, my brother would throw me a quarter to sing a song. In those days, a quarter was a lot of money. I’d sing just about anything for a quarter.”\n\nAlthough he wouldn’t sing in public back then, he always seemed to have a flair for the show business, and a definite desire to take center stage. “When I was in second grade, we had a year-end talent show. I wouldn’t perform with the rest of the kids. I had to have my own spot. The teacher finally allowed me to get out and do my own act. She didn’t know what I was going to do– and neither did I! I got out there and I didn’t know what to do, so I told a story about the girl on the Morton Salt Box. I had seen the box in the kitchen that morning, and I decided to make up a story about the girl walking in the rain. I don’t remember what it was, but I walked back and forth across the stage and told it, and my mother said it was hilarious. It went over very well.”\n\nWhen Don was twelve, his folks purchased a farm on the outskirts of town. He and his brothers had chores to do and like most farm boys, they were members of the 4-H club. “We each had a calf and a hog to take care of. I also had to fix barbed wire fences. I still have the scars to remind me of it!”\n\nDon began noticing girls at an early age, but he was as shy around the pigtail-and-hair-ribbon set as he was about his singing. “In grade school,” he confesses with a reminiscent smile, “I was madly in love with a girl named Harriet Landers. I finally got up enough nerve to ask her to a Saturday movie, but I couldn’t go through with it. My brother and I had load some hogs that morning, and I used that as an excuse. But we finished early and I was able to go to the movie anyway. Harriet saw me there, and we never spoke to each other again.”\n\nThen there was the psychiatrist’s daughter, who asked him to a dance. “I decided the night before that I didn’t want to go, but my mother insisted because she said it was too late to back out. I went but, knowing me, I probably acted surly and didn’t speak to her the whole time.”\n\n“I was in love with the preacher’s daughter in junior high. She was the prettiest girl in school, and about the first girl I ever dated. Then I went away to St. John’s Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin, and she was unfaithful! She started dating my best friend — and a few others. I was broken-hearted. And when you’re in military school, it’s not as if you can be untrue to somebody to get back at them.”\n\nDon went to military school mainly because his brother had gone there. “I went to his graduation,” he explains, “and it was very glamorous. So I went, too.”\n\nAfter his own graduation from the academy, he enrolled in Hastings College. And it was there that Don got over his fear of singing – and regained his faith in women.\n\nI’m sharing a biography of Don Stewart who played the incomparable Mike Bauer, Michelle’s uncle on The Guiding Light. Mike was not only a great character in his own right, he was a serious missing piece in the Manny story. If I ever finish my current fanfic, I’m going to write one that shows it. This article was originally published in novelette fashion in the January 1974 issue of Afternoon TV. I broke it up according to the sections it was published in. The show is referred to as both THE Guiding Light and Guiding Light, but they will drop the THE next year and popular use seems to be heading that way already.\n\nSherwood, Debbie. “Don Stewart’s Life Story.” Afternoon TV, vol. 6, no. 1, January 1974, pp.27-38\n\nI met Don at the ancient CBS studio where The Guiding Light is shot. When he appeared, he kissed my hand , a courtly gesture which definitely got things off to a rousing start.\n\n“Let’s go to my dressing room,” he said, steering me through a maze of narrow corridors. “We can talk there until I have to rehearse.”\n\nI had been trying to interview this handsome daytime idol for several weeks, and each time we had set a date something came up and Don had to cancel.\n\n“I’ve really been busy,” he admitted when I told him how happy I was finally pin him down. “I’ve had a heavy schedule on Guiding Light and I’ve had a lot nightclub bookings on weekends. Also, I just finished two weeks of appearances in The Roar of the Greasepaint in Poughkeepsie, New York, and I’m going to be doing Camelot in Fishkill soon.”\n\nHis dressing room is good-sized and brightly lit, with a long make-up table stretching across one wall and a long mirror hovering over it. On the table were strewn books, photographs, old scripts and shooting schedules, and a pile of envelopes that looked as if they contained fan mail. An open closet door revealed several suits that Dan wears on the show.\n\nMy host offered me a comfortable stuffed chair while he took the straight-backed, less comfortable one. Out in the corridor I could hear the voices of other Guiding Light stars greeting each other as they went in and out of their own dressing rooms. I recognized the voices of Melinda Fee (Charlotte Bauer) and Nanci Addison (Kit Vestid) and I caught a glimpse of Anthony Call (Joe Werner) when Don opened the door to a production assistant who wanted to explain some changes in the day’s script.\n\nIt was exciting, and glamorous in an unostentatious kind of way. The dressing rooms of daytime stars aren’t the opulent things you might expect to see if you were visiting a movie star on a Hollywood sound stage. Not even a star of Don‘s magnitude rates a luxurious spread complete wit plush, wall-to-wall carpeting, chaise lounge and built-in her. XXXXXXXXX But as rehearsals and run -throughs progress, and air time nears, the atmosphere – plan as it is – fairly crackles with anticipation.\n\nOccasionally, during the course of our interview Don was called upstairs to the soundstage. But, like the pro he is, he always came back ready to resume our conversation where we left off. Each time he left I took I took advantage of the free time to look over the batch of pictures he had brought for me. It was delightful to see suave, handsome Don as a mischievous little boy…a gangling adolescent…a dashing Air Force pilot…an aspiring singer and actor. And as he, serious at times, chuckling at others, told me his life story, it was fascinating to visualize the path that took the Nebraska doctor’s son to singing and acting stardom.\n\nVets of Springfield\n\nEvery Memorial Day I stop to wonder about the lack of veterans in Springfield. As someone who likes old TV shows I can say that on shows in the 50s, 60s, 70s were dripping with vets. People on shows that had nothing to do with the military would have old army buddies show up. It seemed strange to me that I didn’t remember references to that kind of thing on Guiding Light. For a long time Buzz Cooper, who was introduced as someone who hadn’t come back from Vietnam (he had actually come back alive just not back to Springfield, his wife, or kids), was the only vet they talked about on the show. Even doing research when I started in deep I didn’t find those references, but as I go through episodes I have found a few more heroes.\n\nA Trio of War Buddies\n\nLast Memorial Day I came across a reference that Dr. Jim Frazier, one of Ed’s mentors, had served in the Korean War. In fact, Dr. Paul Fletcher and Ben Scott also served in the same unit. Dr. Paul Fletcher was then married to Robin Lang who was Kathy Roberts’s daughter. Kathy was Meta Bauer’s stepdaughter. Robin was also an ex-wife of Mike Bauer. Paul was the subject of Agnes Nixon’s novelization of Guiding Light. Ben Scott was the father who abandoned Peggy Scott who would be a nurse and major figure on the show for years, even marrying Roger Thorpe for a time. This trio of war buddies Jim, Paul, and Ben was much more to the pattern of TV shows right then and I’m glad I was able to find them. But that’s not all!\n\nMike Bauer — Veteran\n\nI always knew that Mike Bauer was a hero , but I did NOT realize he was a vet. 1984 is, from what we’ve been able to find. the second full blown invite everybody in town party style Bauer BBQ. Tony and Annabelle are talking with Katie and give an explanation for Mike’s absence. He is out of town during the Bauer BBQ because he is doing a week with the Naval Reserve. That was very fitting because his actor Don Stewart had servced and maintained his own membership in the Naval Reserve which requires a certain number of days in a year. He might even had been doing the same thing in real life right then.\n\nPrevious Memorial Day Posts\n\nRev.

The Santos and Bauer families, while they do have their similarities (immigrants who struggled to survive, who are now comfortably well off, a predilection for danger and for being involved with people’s deaths), the families were visually and storyline different. One way of reading the Manny is that it’s the story of a young couple who try to live in the world of one family, and then the other, and then finally realize they have to build their own family world based on the foundations of the past. The Santos family gets a lion’s share of the press, but I’m going to start some posts that look further back at the Bauer family. So here’s an introduction to that to start things off.\n\nBauer Power!\n\nThe Bauer family was introduced 11 years into the run of Guiding Light replacing the Rev. Ruthledge and his family as the central family of the show when the show location switched from Five Points to Selby Flats, California. The Bauer family moved to Springfield when the show did. (Ed got a residency at Cedars after graduating medical school and the extended family followed and most stayed, in later years they pretended everything that happened in Selby Flats really happened in Springfield.)\n\nThe Bauer family began with Mama (real name never given) and Papa (Fredrich – Rick was named after him) Bauer and their three children Bill (Ed’s father), Meta (of Aunt Meta fame), and Trudy (poor Trudy’s real name was Gertrude). While Meta had a good run of being the focus of the show Bill and his wife Bert had always been there and eventually took over that central focus. Their children Mike and Ed grew up and married, multiple times.\n\nThe Bauer name by then was associated with being of good stock. They were hard working high class and successful professionals who always reached out a friendly hand to those in need and volunteered to help others. That didn’t stop terrible things happening to them or them from being tied up with criminals or sociopaths, but they were considered community leaders.\n\nRead more about the exact lineage of Bauers.\n\nSeries of Bauer Posts\n\nIn order to balance the families I’m going to be doing a series of Bauer posts. I hope you enjoy them.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
