While all genre's other than classical music are represented, rock & jazz fans will likely be the most pleased with this week's selection.\n\nPrices continue to be drastically lowered on everything. The majority of cd's are priced between $1-$3. I'm also not holding any titles back. A few cd's & DVD's re also still available from the previous lists. You can view those here:\n\nCD's - A-D http://www.dandylionrecords.com/newsletter.htm Sold Out\n\nCD's - E-I http://www.dandylionrecords.com/newsletterlast.htm Sold Out\n\nCD's - J-M http://www.dandylionrecords.com/J_M__CD_Sale.htm\n\nCD's - N-R http://www.dandylionrecords.com/N_R__CD_Sale.htm\n\nCD's - S-V http://www.dandylionrecords.com/S_V.htm\n\nCD's - W-Z http://www.dandylionrecords.com/w-z_cd_sale.htm\n\nCD's - Reader's Digest, Starbucks & Timelife http://www.dandylionrecords.com/Time_Life.htm\n\nCD's - Classical http://www.dandylionrecords.com/Classical_CD.htm\n\nThe few remaining dvd's & blu-rays have also been given there own section: http://www.dandylionrecords.com/dvd.htm\n\nCD's are alphabetized, but other then Classical, Various Artists, & a pull from my personal collection (which will likely be on the final email) are not separated by genre. Due to the low pricing, you may see the occasional cracked or broken jewelcase &/or price tag on the case. As usual, I'll note any known issues with the cd or artwork.\n\nYou'll likely be receiving 1 more liquidation newsletter in the next. USA shipping is $4.00 for the first pound & $1 each additional pound.\n\nUnfortunately, the US postal service raised international postage drastically in the last 3 years. I strongly suggest for shipping outside of the USA that you seriously consider having me send the cd's & case art with no cases. We charge actual postage + $2.50 packaging\n\nAll items are used & US issue unless stated otherwise. Used items are mint- unless specified otherwise; with the possible exception of jewelcases. Quantities are limited. Please write early for best selection! If we have more then one of a title, the quantity will be noted in parenthesis after the listing.\n\nTo order, please email me your selections, & I'll send you back a total & a link to pay. I can also still run your card for you if you wish.\n\nIf you live local to Tacoma, Wa, you are welcome to come pick up your order in person at no charge.\n\nFinally, we are going to continue to sell collectable out of copyright films (& hopefully the occasional killer deal on high quality music & film titles). As soon as this project is completed, I have 2 tubs with hundreds of films to go through & add to our collectable film list. http://www.dandylionrecords.com/films.htm\n\nPlease email me if you'd like to subscribe to the collectable film newsletter! Or you can go here to browse & subscribe: http://www.dandylionrecords.com/films.htm\n\nThanks, & I hope you find some great bargains!\n\nCD's - Various Artists\n\n*** 90 Notti in Giro Per il Mondo Soundtrack (Sealed Italy issue) - 1963 soundtrack from Franco Tamponi.
