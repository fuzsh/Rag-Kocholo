        "text": "V-Discs\n\nV-Disc was a record label which produced - by special arrangement between the United States government and various American record companies - music for US military forces during and after World War II. The \"V\" in “V-Disc” stands for \"Victory\". The label came about as a way to help increase the morale among the forces. V-Discs were produced and distributed between October 1943 and May 1949. Over 900 V-Disc record titles were issued, and over 8 million discs were produced. In 1944 and 1945, the US Navy and the Marine Corps had their own V-Disc label. After September 1945, the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all shared the same label unit.\n\nMany popular singers, big bands, and orchestras contributed to the V-Disc program. A variety of sources were used for V-Discs: commercial recordings, radio broadcasts (including some from the Armed Forces Radio Service), rehearsals of radio shows, film soundtracks, and special recording sessions.\n\nMost V-Discs were pressed on a mixture of Vinylite and Formvar, making it much easier to distribute them without breakage (many of the ‘normal’ shellac records sent by relatives arrived in pieces). The discs were larger than commercial 78rpm records: 12 inches instead of 10.\n\nNew V-Discs were released once a month (after September 1947: once in every two months). Initially, a box of V-Discs contained 30 records. Later on, the number of discs per box was reduced: 20 between February 1944 and August 1945; 15 between September 1945 and July 1946; and 10 between August 1946 and May 1949.\n\nA V-Disc Discography was compiled by Richard S. Sears. You can access it on http://vdiscdaddy.com , a great website packed with information about the V-Disc program.\n\nV-Discs featuring Jo Stafford recordings\n\nV-Disc 33\n\nwith: ‘For You’\n\nIssued November 1943\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 102 (December 1944)\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 262\n\nwith: ‘I’ll Be Seeing You’, and ‘Someone To Love’\n\nIssued September 1944\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 42\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 290\n\nwith: ‘When Our Hearts Were Young And Gay’, and ‘Yesterdays’\n\nIssued October 1944\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 70\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 328\n\nwith: ‘I Remember You’, and ‘Love Is Just Around The Corner’\n\nIssued December 1944\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 108\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 378\n\nwith: ‘Carry Me Back To Old Virginia’\n\nIssued February 1945\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 155\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 393\n\nwith: ‘I Didn’t Know About You’, and ‘Tumbling Tumbleweeds’\n\nIssued March 1945\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 173\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 427\n\nwith: ‘Alone Together’\n\nIssued May 1945\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 207\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 467\n\nwith: ‘Baby, Won’t You Please Come Home’\n\nIssued July 1945\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 247\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 487\n\nwith: ‘Am I Blue’\n\nIssued August 1945\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 503\n\nwith: ‘Conversation While Dancing’\n\nIssued September 1945\n\nAlso issued on the Navy V-Disc label and the Marine Corps V-Disc label, V-Disc 263\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 537\n\nwith: ‘Bakery Blues’\n\nIssued November 1945\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 569\n\nwith: ‘Blue Moon’\n\nIssued January 1946\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 584\n\nwith: ‘Gee, It’s Good To Hold You’, and ‘That’s For Me’\n\nIssued February 1946\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 755\n\nwith: ‘Lonesome Road’\n\nIssued April 1947\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 851\n\nwith: ‘Haunted Heart’\n\nIssued July 1948\n\nDetails\n\nV-Disc 895\n\nwith: ‘I’m Comin’ Virginia’\n\nIssued May 1949\n\nDetails\n\nNOTE"
