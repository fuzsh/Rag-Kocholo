        "text": "Anne Shelton was a popular English vocalist whose career encompassed early years as an inspiring performer during World War Two, becoming popular on both sides of the Atlantic in post-war years, with her chart hits continuing through the rock ânâ roll era into the 1960s.\n\nShelton performed at military bases in Britain during the war and was invited by Glenn Miller to sing in France with him and his orchestra in 1944. She declined because of prior commitments. Miller died during this tour when his plane disappeared.\n\nThis 50-track, 2CD, set provides a selective overview of that career, with early recordings following her debut in 1940 at the age of 17 with Bert Ambroseâs orchestra, and then solo recordings for the UK Rex and Decca labels and the US London label, followed by releases on HMV and Philips [UK] and Columbia [USA]. It features all her hits in the UK and USA, including the 1956 UK No.1 Lay Down Your Arms and 1960 No.10 Sailor plus the US Top 30 hits Be Mine and Galway Bay and the UK Top 30 hits Arrivederci Darling, Seven Days and The Village Of St. Bernadette.\n\nShe was a hugely versatile performer, beginning life as a big band vocalist and becoming a sophisticated mainstream song stylist in the post-war years before turning her hand to poppier material through the â50s, her ability to achieve success in the USA underlining her broad appeal. Shelton appeared in three Royal Variety Performances, 1953, 1959 and 1978, and continued to play charity concerts almost until her death in 1994, aged 70.\n\nWe hope this selection of recordings from across more than two decades offers a representative overview of her career and an enjoyable showcase for her talents.\n\nTRACKS"
