        "text": "In July 1956, Louis Armstrong, after over 40 years of performing and over 30 years of recording, was at the height of popularity in his career. Just days after his interview for the Voice of America in Washington D.C., he’d be performing at Lewisohn Stadium in New York City with a symphony orchestra made up of members of the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Edward R. Murrow would be on hand to film the occasion for a theatrical documentary. And the other “fellow” Armstrong referred to in the above quote—George Avakian—would be there as well, recording it all for Columbia Records.\n\nAvakian had been exclusively producing Armstrong since September 1955 and it is no coincidence that Armstrong’s popularity began to skyrocket in this span of time. However, Armstrong’s relationship with Columbia would more or less end at Lewisohn Stadium; a fallout with Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser over signing a long-term contract with the label caused Armstrong to become a free agent, recording for over a dozen different labels in the last 15 years of his life. Though he still recorded some outright classics and had some bona fide hit records in that time, he never again received the care and attention on those dates as he did from Avakian. And Armstrong knew that, as the above quote makes perfectly clear.\n\nArmstrong’s small group, the “All Stars,” was formed in 1947 and was a top-drawing live attraction from night one. But Joe Glaser wanted hit records and RCA Victor’s few recordings with that group didn’t sell especially well. In 1949, he signed Armstrong up with Decca, where Milt Gabler would oversee Armstrong’s recorded output for the next five years.\n\nGabler, as the founder and longtime head of Commodore Records, knew and loved pure, no-frills jazz but more importantly to Glaser, he knew how to make records that sold in large quantities. Though he threw the All Stars an occasional bone—resulting in some wonderful albums such asSATCHMO AT PASADENA, NEW ORLEANS DAYS and AT THE CRESCENDO—Gabler mostly featured Armstrong covering other people’s hits, backed by larger studio groups. The result was a string of commercially successful records: BLUEBERRY HILL, THAT LUCKY OLD SUN, LA VIE EN ROSE, C’EST SI BON, A KISS TO BUILD A DREAM ON, I GET IDEAS and more.\n\nBut it also added fuel to the flame of long-standing criticism of Armstrong, that he had “gone commercial.” Armstrong liked to claim that he didn’t read reviews, but clearly, he knew the cries of “commercialism” were harming his reputation as the world’s greatest jazzman. Hence his line, “And that’s when you look around, people are wondering, ‘What happened to Louie Armstrong?’” in the Voice of America program.\n\nArmstrong was proud of his All Stars and knew what they were capable of based on the reactions they received during their live performances. But he needed a producer to trust that instinct fully and put the pop tunes on the back burner for a while. That producer was George Avakian.\n\nThis set is indisputably a tribute to Avakian (although he only produced roughly two-thirds of the music heard on this set), as well as to Armstrong’s All Stars. Both have had their critics over the years. In Avakian’s case, it was because of his pioneering use of splicing and editing. Some jazz producers of the 1950, including Norman Granz, deplored such methods, arguing that the full, unedited take, warts and all, was a truer representation of the music than anything created in postproduction.\n\nAvakian disagreed. As the man who popularized the use of Long-Play records, Avakian felt like his mission was to present the best total listening experience. And if that meant splicing in a better solo from a breakdown take or adding fake applause to make a studio date appear “live,” so be it. “I hate it when people get into the files at Columbia as they do now and then and come up with the ‘terrific discovery’ that there were three takes used in something,” Avakian told me in 2007. “That doesn’t matter! What matters is you’ve got to get the right performance that’s right for the artist.” More importantly, Avakian was proud to have the artists on his side. After he used splicing on a Dave Brubeck track, he was hammered by the editor of a jazz magazine, saying, “How can you do that? You’re altering the artistry of the musician, and you’re putting out a recording of something he didn’t actually play.” Avakian sent the editor to Brubeck, who simply responded, “George saved my ass.”\n\nIn some ways, this Mosaic Records boxed set reveals some of Avakian’s magic; the live albums he created with Armstrong—namelyAMBASSADOR SATCH and SATCHMO THE GREAT—are still masterpieces in their original form (and easy to find and download online at iTunes and Amazon, among other places). As the decades have passed, there is more interest in Armstrong—and especially his All Stars period—than ever before. Delving into Sony’s vaults—and occasionally Avakian’s own basement—Mosaic is able to present many of these performances and concerts as they were originally performed. In some cases, Avakian’s edits saved Armstrong and the All Stars’ asses, but hearing the unvarnished performances better illustrates what this band could do night in and night out, often when suffering extreme exhaustion. This was a hard-working band of road warriors and they played at 110% all of the time, with or without postproduction edits.\n\nOf course, that wasn’t enough to spare them from some of the most mean-spirited criticism of the decade in the 1950s. While his records were being derided as “commercial,” reviews of Armstrong’s live shows with the All Stars often focused only on the non-musical portions of the show. Quotes from critics of the era saw him as “mugging like mad,” complaining that the act “may have had its merits as vaudeville” and that it “[seldom rose] above the plane of a coon carnival” and that Armstrong was “generally lowering himself as a human being.”\n\nThis angered Armstrong to no end since he was just doing what he had always been doing: entertaining audiences with an ingenious mix of high-quality music, showmanship and comedy. Even the vaunted Hot Five recordings were filled with humorous moments, but critics in the 1950s liked to complain that Armstrong abandoned being a “serious artist,” a theory Humphrey Lyttelton punctured in the 1957 book, Just Jazz. “In the light of all this, it’s difficult to see any relevance in the criticism that Louis Armstrong deserted jazz at some stage in his career,” he wrote. “You cannot abandon principles which you have never held. If jazz is really some sublime, art-for-art’s sake form of music, quite untainted by commercialism, then it would be more honest to come right out and say that Louis Armstrong never did play jazz. And nor, for that matter, did the majority of the most successful and revered jazzmen of the Golden Age.”\n\nArmstrong frequently defended his choice to be a showman AND a serious musician. A 1959 interview in London preserved on Armstrong’s private reel-to-reel tapes found the trumpeter in a testy mood, ably defending himself against the frequent barbs he received in this era. “As long as I feel and hit the notes, I’ve got my own audience and no critic in the world can tell me how I should play my horn and I won’t do it anyway. That’s why they brought me over here, to be myself….[I]f they say ‘clowning,’ what is clowning? Anything to make the people get a little laugh, to put humor in your program and the note still comes out, that’s not clowning. Clowning’s when you can’t play nothing. And always remember that. So I don’t think that’s such a cute phrase.” Armstrong then summed himself up: “You don’t play 45 years and hit notes and do things nobody else can do. You’re not slipping….Whatever it is, can’t nobody do what I do. Now I’m egotistical to say that because I feel if they can try to get a little laugh, I’ll get one, too.”\n\nThough Armstrong made it clear in interview after interview that he was serious about his music, critics couldn’t get past something else: the feeling that Armstrong played the same songs and same solos every night and thus was somehow taking it easy. This is something else that followed Armstrong around in the last 20 years of his life, and still dogs his later reputation to this day. While the truth is the Armstrong band book was larger than given credit for (a subject for another essay), it cannot be denied that Armstrong, being so famous and having so many well-known songs, had to play the hits every night. On top of that, Armstrong was from an earlier generation of jazz musicians, a generation that worked on their improvised solos and once they had it set, never changed it (see the examples of his mentors, such a King Oliver’s “Dipper Mouth Blues” or Kid Ory’s “Savoy Blues” solos). “And always, once you got a certain solo that fit in the tune, and that’s it, you keep it,” Armstrong told Richard Meryman in 1965. “Only vary it two or three notes every time you play it—specially if the record was a hit. There’s always different people there every night, and they just want to be entertained.” Armstrong even told his All Stars to remember what they played in the spontaneous-sounding ensembles, telling an interviewer in 1952, “Whatever we play together, we try to remember that. It’s just like an arrangement.”\n\nCritics tried to claim Armstrong was coasting by playing many of the same songs and solos every night but most never seemed to take into account how much strength and endurance it took to perform those solos (deemed by Wynton Marsalis as “virtually impossible to play”) night after night always in front of completely different audiences. “What he played was Louis and nobody else could do it that well,” trombonist Trummy Young recalled. “I played the same numbers over and over with him and every night they sounded pretty to me. Because Louis felt it every night. He had one thing he went by—If you’re playing it good, it doesn’t matter. And also—If you don’t feel it, you can’t make them feel it. And he was right. There was a lot of logic in what he said. What most people overlook is that Louis was very sincere and very dedicated [in] what he did. He worked hard at making his music sound good all the time.”\n\nTrumpeter Max Kaminsky agreed with comparing Armstrong’s perfectly chiseled solos to great classical performances, telling Steve Voce in 1957, “The accusations they’ve been making about Louis….There’s four or five of these big guys been spreading stories about Louis being ‘Uncle Tom’ and Louis playing the same two choruses on a number for the last two years, and so on. To say these things about a man of Louis’ caliber is the grossest stupidity and insult. Suppose he had been playing these choruses the same way for some time—there isn’t anybody else could make them sound that way, anyhow. It’s like calling Tchaikovsky a bum because his piano concerto sounds the same way each time you hear it.”\n\nYes, certain songs are repeated multiple times in this set, but that allow listeners to hold Armstrong’s consistency in high regard and marvel at how he was able to execute these “virtually impossible” solos night after night, over 20 years after chops trouble almost made him put the horn down for good. One can equally appreciate his expert comic timing and completely natural way of making an audience laugh. And don’t forget that this was also the man who invented jazz singing and continued to refine his vocal approach, with remarkable results, in his later years. A triple threat performer, Armstrong’s mastery of the stage is what led him to reach new heights of popularity with the All Stars at a time when jazz began struggling to maintain a sizeable audience (a struggle the music is still dealing with today). Armstrong had the best defense against his critics in that 1958 interview: “So, whatever they're going to say about Louis Armstrong, all they say is, 'He blow like hell every time he hits that stand.' And that makes them mad. But I have to live my life and that's that.”\n\nOne could argue that Avakian himself inadvertently caused the backlash against the trumpeter in his later years about “going commercial” and not being the “serious artist” he was in the 1920s. By the end of the 1930s, Armstrong was still a major star—recording for Decca, appearing in movies and on the radio—and a musician both respected by critics and other musicians. But in 1940, Columbia Records began a new series of reissue “albums,” reaching into their back catalog to put out new collections of a single artist’s work. Avakian, then a 21-year-old student at Yale University, was put in charge of the Hot Jazz Classics series. Armstrong was the first artist featured with a collection of his seminal Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings from the 1920s, aided by a few previously unissued performances Avakian turned up in the Columbia vaults. The results were a big success Columbia, critically and commercially.\n\nThere’s no denying the importance of the Columbia reissues in cementing the reputation of Armstrong as one of the visionaries of jazz in the 1920s, but in some odd way, the caused the reputation of the living, breathing, performing Armstrong of the 1940s to suffer in comparison. New Orleans-centric “moldy fig” jazz fans already fed up with the Swing Era, rediscovered the Hot Fives and Hot Sevens and celebrated the younger Armstrong while denouncing the older veteran as a commercial artist and showman. “Armstrong is no longer a vital force in hot jazz,” critic Paul Edward Miller wrote in April 1941. “His influence on other players, admittedly a widespread influence, has pretty much petered out. Creatively and artistically, Armstrong is dead….Armstrong has chosen to play exclusively for the box office, has assumed a downright commercial attitude. Therein lies Armstrong’s failure.”\n\nArmstrong paid it no mind and continued moving forward throughout the 1940s with his big band. But by 1947, his, like many others of the period, was experiencing hard times. Throughout the decade, Armstrong had occasionally performed with small combinations of all-star musicians at special occasions, making it clear that he never lost his ability to play in a small group setting. In late 1946, he had a large role in New Orleans, a fairly rotten film that nonetheless gave the moldy figs their dream image of Armstrong in a small group setting surrounded by other masters such as Kid Ory and Zutty Singleton.\n\nIn 1947, the small-group performances were growing, including a successful Carnegie Hall set with Edmond Hall’s sextet in February and two different radio broadcasts with two different small groups on April 26. In each case, Armstrong sounded at home, pleasing listeners and fans more than he had in quite some time with his struggling big band.\n\nIt was at this point that press agent Ernie Anderson had an idea and decided to run it past Armstrong during an engagement at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia at the beginning of May. Anderson told this story numerous times throughout his life. This passage is taken from his final public telling on a BBC radio’s “Armstrong Legacy” documentary series hosted by Campbell Burnap in 1995, the year of Anderson’s passing:\n\n[Armstrong] said, 'I can't do anything until Mr. Glaser tells me it's okay.' So we're back to square one. We had to somehow convince Joe Glaser of this. So I went back to New York with [cornetist] Bobby [Hackett]. And I didn't have much money, but I got together a thousand dollars and I went to the bank and I got a cashier's check made out for a thousand dollars. Then I went up to Joe Glaser's office. There was a little window in the wall where a switchboard operator operated and I walked up to the window and walked up to the glass and said, 'Would you please give this to Mr. Glaser?' And I handed her a check made out to Joe Glaser, a cashier's check for a thousand dollars. That was quite a bit of money in 1947. And she said, 'What should I do?\" I said, 'Just give it to Joe Glaser and tell him that I'm out here.' Well, a couple of minutes later, Joe Glaser opened that door and he's holding the check in his hand and he says, 'What are you trying to do, you jerk?' He called me a jerk! That was the first thing he said. I said, 'Joe, Louie Armstrong is getting $350 a night for playing with a 16-piece band. That's for one night without the 16-piece band.' Well, he finally asked me to come in the office. I knew that he had that check in his hand. It was just like cash, a cashier's check, he'd never give that check up, I knew that because Joe was very hard with a dollar, you know. He was rude to me, but he couldn't give up the check so he agreed to the date.\n\nThe date was set for May 17, 1947. Anderson named Hackett as the evening’s musical director. A favorite of Eddie Condon’s circle of musicians, Hackett assembled a band that would have been comfortable at one of the guitarist’s own Town Hall Concerts of the 1940s (which were also produced by Anderson). Trombonist Jack Teagarden first recorded with Armstrong in 1929 and the two had performed at various all-star occasions in the ensuing years. Peanuts Hucko, a veteran of Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman’s big bands, and also part of Condon’s circle, got the call on clarinet. For the rhythm section, the great Bob Haggart was brought in on bass; Haggart was also a fine arranger who had dome some work for Armstrong at Decca in 1945 and 1946. Two drummers alternated, both legends: Condon favorite George Wettling and Armstrong favorite “Big” Sid Catlett, “the greatest drummer to ever pick up a pair of sticks” in the trumpeter’s estimation. The least known musician, though, made one of the biggest impressions: multi-instrumentalist Dick Cary manned the piano at Town Hall and impressed Armstrong mightily.\n\nAs Anderson told it, “We came to the hall at six o'clock, everybody that was on the concert that night to rehearse with Louie. We had cleared the hall for two hours and we were going to rehearse. And Louie came on the stage and he greeted everyone. He knew everyone, of course, and he was so pleased to see them. He just talked for a few minutes and Louie said, 'We don't need any rehearsal.' I was really hurt. I thought, 'Gee, this might end up being a clambake.' And he said, 'I'm going to go home to Corona and I'll come back and we'll hit at 11:30.' Well, he came at 11:30 and he started with 'Cornet Chop Suey' and it was just like 20 years ago. It was just wonderful!”\n\nTHE RECORDINGS\n\nSESSION (A), TOWN HALL, NYC, MAY 17, 1947\n\nThe 20 numbers that have survived from Town Hall, may or may not make up the complete concert (contemporary reviews featured differing numbers of how many songs were performed, one reviewer saying 20, another saying “no less than 27”). In 1983, French RCA released the THE COMPLETE CONCERT on its “Black and White” imprint. In the notes, Jean-Paul Guiter alluded to “the recent discovery of the original acetates” without giving any background as to their provenance, though it’s assumed that Anderson had it recorded. But no matter if this is 100% complete or not, the nearly 80 minutes that have survived are positively exhilarating, a priceless document of a historic evening.\n\nFor one thing, Armstrong is at the center of the entire show, from start to finish. After the birth of the All Stars, he always made a special point to feature his sideman, though he’d always find a way to play or sometimes sing on those features. That wasn’t the case at Town Hall. In their conversation before “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans,” Teagarden and Fred Robbins do reference an “intermission,” so Armstrong did get a short bit of rest, but other than three-and-a-half minutes on ST. JAMES INFIRMARY, he is front and center on 19 of the 20 surviving tracks. Goodness knows what his chops looked like the next day!\n\nArmstrong throws down the gauntlet on the opening number, CORNET CHOP SUEY a perfect beginning to this last phase of his career. Here was one of the vaunted Hot Five masterpieces, the kind of instrumental showcase that purists bemoaned the lack of in Armstrong’s big band repertoire. Armstrong probably hadn’t played it in two decades, but still manages to knock it out of the park.\n\nMost importantly, he never tries recreating the sound of the 1920s. He might have been playing his old hits, but from “Cornet Chop Suey” on down, Armstrong and the other men on stage treated everything as if it was the music of 1947. The rhythm section swings mightily, Wettling catching all of Armstrong’s phrases (big thanks to drummers Hal Smith and Kevin Dorn, who helped identify which tracks featured Wettling and which tracks featured Catlett). Cary’s piano is full of interesting harmonic touches in his own unique style.\n\nWhen Armstrong gets to the climactic stop-time chorus, he plays just enough of the original to show he remembered it, but also adds new phrases and twists and turns, swinging into a brand new rideout chorus with a high-note cadenza that is pure 1947 Armstrong.\n\nWith that demanding opening number out of the way, Armstrong strolled through a swinging version of Earl Hines’s OUR MONDAY DATE, playing well but also sounding like he was improvising a new set of lyrics during the bridge.\n\nWhat followed was one of the highlights of the evening, Armstrong and Cary’s duet on DEAR OLD SOUTHLAND. Originally recorded in 1930 by Armstrong and pianist Buck Washington, Armstrong was performing a more uptempo arrangement of it with his big band in the 1940s. The Town Hall version is not only stunning from a technical aspect (one of Armstrong’s finest operatic solos), but also because Armstrong probably hadn’t performed it this way in 17 years and was being backed by a pianist with whom he’d never played before—all without rehearsal. Armstrong would revisit this routine until at least 1957 with a variety of pianists, but he never topped this Town Hall version.\n\nBIG BUTTER AND EGG MAN opens with a little good-natured confusion. Poor Dick Cary has been blamed for the mess-up for years but to my ears, it’s Armstrong who blends BIG BUTTER AND EGG MAN into OUR MONDAY DATE in his second eight bars. Listening intently, Cary and Haggart change to suit the leader’s direction, right into the bridge, when Armstrong realizes he’s playing the wrong song. Without panicking or breaking down, Armstrong coolly steps up to the mike, to introduce BUTTER AND EGG MAN,winning some laughs from those in the know.\n\nLike OUR MONDAY DATE, Armstrong makes up some new lyrics during the vocal. The Hot Five version featured one of those perfect solos that has been analyzed for decades for the logical flow of its improvisation (though it was likely worked out and set in advance, like many of his later solos with the All Stars). Armstrong’s two-chorus outing at Town Hall is ripe for similar exploration, featuring some of his most rhythmically advanced playing of the period and building to a ferocious climax, obviously inspired by driving support of the rhythm section. I think it stands up with any of the other great jazz trumpet solos being performed in 1947 by Gillespie and the “bopping faction,” as Louis would say.\n\nWhile an entire concert of Armstrong fronting a rhythm section would have been a true dream, TIGER RAG brings on the rest of front line and also introduces Sid Catlett on drums. Everyone seems to have a little nervous energy to burn on this one—Armstrong almost starts it in the wrong key—but he relaxes as it goes on, taking yet another free-flowing solo, eschewing the high note pyrotechnics of his 1930s. Catlett unleashes the only extended drum solo of the evening and, as with all of his features, it’s not only a pleasure to listen to, but makes the listener wonder what it must have looked like, as his feats of showmanship frequently break up the audience.\n\nSTRUTTIN’ WITH SOME BARBECUE gets a good groove going and one can hear Armstrong organizing the jam session (“Look out there, Peanuts!” he shouts before Hucko’s solo). Once more, he sounds relaxed, spurred on by Hackett’s background figures to create playing unrelated to version of “Barbecue” before or after.\n\nThe original 1930 version of SWEETHEARTS ON PARADE was soft and lightly swinging, but in retrospect, sounds like a stomp when compared to the ballad treatment given to it here, Armstrong and company treating Carmen Lombardo’s opus as a gentle lullaby. Where the original also featured some of the trumpeter’s proto-bebop double-timing, this version is a seminar in melodic phrasing. After the vocal, Catlett turns on the heat in the last eight bars, creating a spine-tingling rideout.\n\nST. LOUIS BLUES is given another loose jam session treatment, Armstrong and Catlett really whipping matters up into a frenzy in the habanera sections. The recording quality kind of obscures Catlett’s cymbal work but you can just feel his Chinese cymbal pushing everyone along. Hackett’s rehearsal also comes into play with some nice responses to Armstrong’s clarion calls.\n\nWith PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, we’re finally into the first of six performances originally released by RCA Victor as an album of 12” 78s in 1948. While many musicians prefer to treat this number as a swinger, Armstrong always gave it a tender treatment. Instead of an opening instrumental chorus, Armstrong comes right in with the vocal. Hackett’s beautiful obbligato nearly stealing the show from Armstrong’s crooning. In fact, in a later interview held on one of Armstrong’s private tapes, he singled out Hackett’s work on this track, driving the point home by singing the first few bars of Hackett’s backing. When Brian Priestly praised Hackett’s work with Armstrong in 1974, Hackett responded, “Oh, you think that's easy, huh? I had such awe for the man that I was always a little shook up always in his presence, you know. And then to have to play the trumpet besides is a little too much. But he was so kind and would always make you feel comfortable. But it's a situation that's hard to explain because there wasn't anything that I could play that I didn't steal from him, something he did years ago. Well, it was always a thrill to be in the same city as him.” After the vocal, Armstrong shouts “Every tub” during Teagarden’s solo and everyone goes home together for 16 glorious bars.\n\nON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET is a tune we’ll encounter three separate times in this set, in three completely different approaches. At Town Hall, Armstrong gave it a swinging, uptempo take, much as he did with the big band in the 1940s. Catlett, as usual, is something to marvel at with his backing of Hucko and Teagarden and those roof-shaking backbeats in the outchorus. I CAN’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE also gets the swinging treatment, Armstrong on fire during his vocal (listen to him patting his foot during the break). “Take it piano!” ushers in another Cary solo—Cary makes his presence felt on every song—before Armstrong takes charge with a calm, “Let’s knock it out.” Like the bridge to SUNNY SIDE.Armstrong relays on a set pattern on his outchorus, solo, nailing the demanding high note excursion he had been playing on this tune for much of the decade (his concluding phrase, almost a nod to some of the Hot Five endings, is a decisive definition of swing).\n\nBACK O’TOWN BLUES and the next two numbers are also from the 1948 album, justly celebrated for the last 65 years. Though Armstrong sings and plays wonderfully, this particular version is best known for Armstrong’s sharp “Shut up, boy” takedown of a talkative audience member who was feeling the spirit a little too much. Never one to abandon something that works, future versions would cast members of the onstage All Stars in the roles of various hecklers. Teagarden’s solo is also spot-on, opening with a lick Armstrong originally played on Bessie Smith’s 1925 recording of ST. LOUIS BLUES and later incorporating a snatch of Dhrdla’s SOUVENIR that Armstrong first quoted on Clara Smith’s COURTHOUSE BLUES, also from 1925. SOUVENIR became a favorite quote of both Teagarden and Armstrong during the All Stars era.\n\nArmstrong originally recorded AIN’T MISBEHAVIN’ in 1929 and performed it consistently for the following 18 years. Though every note of his concluding solo was minted before the great stock market crash, it still sounds as riveting as ever here. One reason why this version heads towards the top of the pantheon of all the surviving versions of “Ain’t Misbehavin’” in the Armstrong discography (and there are many) is that everyone plays at peak form, contributing one top-notch solo after another, all enhanced by the mighty backing of Catlett. When Armstrong dubbed the 1948 RCA album to his reel-to-reel tape collection, he dedicated the entire reel to Catlett. No surprise with drumming like that.\n\nWith ROCKIN’ CHAIR, we move from a highlight of the concert to a highlight of western civilization. Hyperbole aside, this is as good as it gets. This was another 1929-vintage routine, one Armstrong had performed with a variety of “fathers,” but never Teagarden. Without any rehearsal, the two men simply nailed it, Teagarden, with his cool Texas drawl, providing the perfect foil for Armstrong’s more excitable character. But more than just going for laughs, there’s clearly a love between Armstrong and Teagarden that the audience in Town Hall felt that evening and that audiences listening at home can feel today. The laughter you hear in the audience is 100 percent genuine and completely contagious. When the routine is over and Armstrong leads the way out with his horn, the emotion of it all is enough to bring one to tears. In many ways, it’s a quintessential Armstrong performance: laughter, warmth and heavy drama, all in about five minutes.\n\nIt would have been tough to top that climax…and MUSKRAT RAMBLE doesn’t. With Wettling back on drums, it’s one of the sloppier performances of the evening, mostly due to the multi-strained nature of the composition. There seems to be a hesitation throughout the early going, as some musicians aren’t quite sure of when to insert the breaks or change strains. Everyone seems to sense this and Armstrong pulls the plug after barely two minutes. Wettling makes his presence felt with some superlative brushwork on SAVE IT, PRETTY MAMA. Like all the ballads performed that evening, it’s a masterpiece, Armstrong playing and singing with tremendous feeling. In his outchorus, listen for a quote from the pop tune “The Gypsy”; we’ll be hearing more from that later in this set.\n\nArmstrong finally takes a break as Teagarden steps up for his feature on ST. JAMES INFIRMARY, the final of the original six released performances. A true tour de force, Teagarden plays straight, sings the blues, then shows off his unique trombone-slide-and-water-glass sound in the last chorus. Everything you need to know about Jack Teagarden in just a few minutes.\n\nArmstrong originally jammed ROYAL GARDEN BLUES with King Oliver in Chicago in the 1920s, but this is the first time he ever performed it in front of a recording device. He sounds unsure of a few notes in the introduction, but soon settles into the routine, one that would become an All Stars favorite into the mid-60s. After a touching impromptu speech by Teagarden—“I’m really in heaven tonight,” he says—emcee Fred Robbins brings us up to date by introducing DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO MISS NEW ORLEANS, the theme of the brand new motion picture, New Orleans. Professionals that they were, the new song sounds like an old standard in the hands of this band. In fact, Teagarden sounds like he wants to take a solo after the vocal, but Armstrong stays in front, playing a heartfelt lead until the finish.\n\nFor a closer, Armstrong and Teagarden reprise their 1944 V-Disc performance of JACK ARMSTRONG BLUES, with Catlett back on drums. Both men seem a little unfamiliar with the original routine, Teagarden making up the lyrics and Armstrong missing his entrance and sitting out a chorus. But once he starts, watch out! Though they had been playing for almost 80 minutes and the clock was now past 1 a.m., everybody sounds as fresh as when the concert began (though not the recording equipment; apparently, the extra poor audio quality on this number was due to the acetate disc cutters overheating). Armstrong really digs into the solo, and especially comes alive with the organ backing provided by Hackett and company. A favorite moment occurs towards the end as Armstrong gets to the close of his third chorus. Not sure of when to end it, he pulls the horn from his lips and obviously makes some sort of “one more” gesture. As Catlett fills in the silence, Armstrong plays an ascending phrase that tops out on a jaw-dropping high concert F, the top of his range. That one note always surprises me as it’s one Armstrong didn’t reach for unless he was feeling extra good—of course, the first 79 minutes already illustrated that extremely well!\n\n“The concert was a tremendous hit,” Ernie Anderson concluded. “I mean, everybody just adored it. The reviewers were, to a man, overwhelmed by it. And I asked Joe Glaser what he thought of it and he said, 'Oh, it was wonderful.' And he said, 'I want to see that Jack Teagarden in my office tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.' When Jack Teagarden came to his office, Joe Glaser signed him up to a contract for seven years, which is the most time you could hold a man to a contract in those days. And of course, at the same time, he gave the notice to the 16 musicians that had been traveling with Louis in the bus.”\n\nIndeed, the writing was on the wall for Armstrong’s big band after the success at Town Hall, as it was officially broken up when Armstrong went to California for a month to film A Song is Born in July. Glaser would use the time to organize Armstrong’s new sextet, getting them a debut booking at Billy Berg’s in Los Angeles starting in August.\n\nIn addition to Teagarden, Sid Catlett was a natural holdover from Town Hall to join the group. Dick Cary’s playing had also impressed Armstrong to no end. While Glaser originally wanted to go after a bigger name like Earl “Fatha” Hines, Armstrong argued, “That little ofay who played Town Hall would be pretty good.” Instead of Hucko, Barney Bigard was brought in on clarinet. A native of New Orleans, Bigard was most noted for his long tenure with Duke Ellington. He was already based in California in the mid-1940s, enjoying the New Orleans revival scene, leading his own band and playing with the likes of Kid Ory. Another Californian, Morty Corb was hired as the group’s first bassist.\n\nOn August 13, 1947, “Louis Armstrong and the Esquire All Stars” debuted at Billy Berg’s, breaking box office records and garnering incredible reviews. Time famously said, “Louis Armstrong had forsaken the ways of Mammon and come back to jazz.”\n\nThough the nightclub engagement was a smash, Glaser was more impressed the concert-style setting of Town Hall. For the fall of 1947, he began booking the All Stars (they soon lost their Esquire sponsorship) in more and more concert halls. Armstrong had seen everything from the honky-tonks in New Orleans to the speakeasies in Chicago to the dancing crowds of the Swing Era; he would now have to get used to almost exclusively playing in front of quiet, sitting audiences, with all of their attention focused on what was happening on stage.\n\nArmstrong knew he would have to offer a show and more than just the Town Hall style jam session night after night. His first move was to bring back female vocalist and comedic foil Velma Middleton, a longtime hit with his big band. A frequent target of critics because of her large size and ability to do splits, Armstrong was more interested in her ability to bring down the house, which she always did.\n\nNext, when Corb chose to stay in California instead of touring with the All Stars, Armstrong reached into the personnel of his final big band and hired young Arvell Shaw of St. Louis as a replacement. In a band of so many heavy hitters, Shaw was the least heralded, but he was a swinging player, adept at soloing and a showman to boot. In 1950, Armstrong told The Record Changer that Shaw’s showmanship and ability to play featured solos were important to the success of his band. “If we're going to give concerts, that's the only kind of band I've got to have,” Armstrong said. “We got to stand out there two hours and a half, three hours and play. You've got to get somebody more than just play ordinary.” While the critics might have wanted to scream, “No! You don’t need to do that!” Armstrong’s method of quality music-plus-showmanship guaranteed a packed house every night for years to come.\n\nSESSION (B), CARNEGIE HALL, NYC, NOVEMBER 15, 1947\n\nIn November 1947, Armstrong had two high profile concert hall dates, first at Carnegie Hall on November 15 and then at Boston’s Symphony Hall on November 30. Anderson was all about documenting performances for posterity (later, his actions influenced Armstrong to purchase his first reel-to-reel tape deck for the purpose of recording his own shows in order to study them afterwards). After recording the Town Hall show, Anderson set it up to record both major concerts in 1947. Armstrong’s label at the time, RCA Victor, chose to put out the Town Hall album in 1948. By 1949, Armstrong was signed with Decca. Not long after, Anderson sold the Symphony Hall acetates to Milt Gabler, who released Satchmo at Symphony Hall on January 15, 1951 to rave reviews, the double-LP set immediately becoming known as one of the finest documents of a live All Stars concert (in 2012, Hip-O Select released SATCHMO AT SYMPHONY HALL 65TH ANNIVERSARY: THE COMPLETE PERFORMANCES).\n\nBut what of the Carnegie Hall performance? Interestingly, many Armstrong aficionados don’t even know this performance exists. It seems that Anderson also brought the acetates to RCA Victor shortly thereafter. Someone at RCA transferred about 90 minutes of the concert from acetate to tape. Why only 90 minutes? We can only speculate: perhaps they thought these were the best performances; perhaps Anderson didn’t have a good grip on the acetate disc cutter (some performances are incomplete). But the tapes were mislabeled as being from Symphony Hall (probably because Teagarden misspeaks on BASIN STREET BLUES and says “Symphony” instead of “Carnegie”) and they languished on the shelves until Ben Young discovered them in the RCA archives in 2001. He shared it with Belgian discographer Jos Willems, who immediately identified it as being the November 15, 1947 Carnegie Hall concert. Unfortunately, RCA was scaling back on its jazz issues at the time and the performance remained in the vaults for 13 more years, until this moment.\n\nEven though this is not the complete performance, this is historic stuff. For one thing, after being so familiar withSATCHMO AT SYMPHONY HALL or decades, it’s a real ear-opener to listen to so many of the same songs performed in the same way at Carnegie Hall two weeks earlier. The band had only been together for three months, yet they had their act down to a science. Though Armstrong was the one who later took all the criticism for playing set solos, it’s clear that the first edition of the All Stars featured many like-minded musicians. Everyone’s features are set in stone, from Teagarden’s showcase on LOVER to Arvell Shaw’s extended solo on HOW HIGH THE MOON (including Catlett’s joke, “Go ahead and have a fit then!”) to Catlett’s own legendary feature, STEAK FACE, with large chunks performed exactly the same way at Symphony Hall two weeks later.\n\nArmstrong’s showcases include ROYAL GARDEN BLUES and MAHOGANY HALL STOMP, each one taken at more foot-pattin’ medium tempos than they would sport in the ensuing decade. We also finally hear from Velma Middleton on I CRIED FOR YOU, one of her pop tune features. A few of the highlights from Town Hall are also reprised here, including a terrific BACK O’TOWN BLUES, with Armstrong going for a piercing high concert F towards the end.\n\nOddly, Armstrong seems to be losing his voice as the evening goes on. For all the impersonations and laughs about his unconventional, gravel voice, it was always remarkably full-bottomed and he always sang in tune. But by the time, they get to ROCKIN’ CHAIR, it’s clear he’s struggling. Fortunately, he has a sympathetic partner in Teagarden, who turns in his most aggressive turn as the father, coming up with more quips than usual to mask his leader’s fading vocal cords (this performance marks the only known time Teagarden uttered the autobiographical line, “I had 23 years of one-nighters—I don’t care to go no place!”).\n\nIn fact, where Catlett is the MVP of the Symphony Hall show (after Armstrong, of course), Teagarden is really the backbone of Carnegie Hall. In addition to LOVER and ROCKIN’ CHAIR, Teagarden also scores with his sentimental ballad, STARS FELL ON ALABAMA and a romp on BABY WON’T YOU PLEASE COME HOME, as well as of his old stand-bys, BASIN STREET BLUES. Of course, Armstrong himself had a history with that tune so it’s no surprise that he almost steals it with his solo—featuring a break once again made up of a quote from THE GYPSY.And at the end, after Catlett’s MOP MOP feature, Armstrong throws it over to Teagarden one more time to do ST. JAMES INFIRMARY, the big success from Town Hall. Teagarden’s role is pretty much the same as that iconic performance but this one has an extra benefit in that Armstrong gets to play a little horn in the background, always a nice touch. Armstrong even plays Teagarden’s theme song, I GOTTA RIGHT TO SING THE BLUES, as the closing theme, something he continued to do while the trombonist was in the band.\n\nAs at Town Hall, Fred Robbins is the emcee, making another fine speech (it’s no wonder he was chosen to deliver the eulogy at Armstrong’s funeral in 1971). “It’s really a thrill to be able to revel in a genius while we have him,” he says. “Not to be able to talk about him years from now but to appreciate him and enjoy him while he’s still able to put that vibrating lip to his golden horn.” It’s a wonderful sentiment and of course, one that adoring audiences would embody after every Armstrong performance for the next 24 years—except for many members in the jazz community. But once the novelty of the All Stars wore off, they became jazz’s favorite target, with Armstrong getting blasted by both critics and younger musicians.\n\nBy 1954, the personnel of the band had changed dramatically. Armstrong was now surrounded by Trummy Young on trombone, Billy Kyle on piano and Barrett Deems on drums, in addition to original stalwarts Bigard, Shaw and Middleton. Though Young, Deems and Kyle didn’t have the hall-of-fame credentials as Teagarden, Catlett and Earl “Fatha” Hines (who replaced Cary at the start of 1948), in many ways, they were better team players, there strictly to support Armstrong. Teagarden, Catlett and Hines were all former leaders who all eventually grew antsy playing sideman for Armstrong and left to go back on their own. Young, Deems and Kyle were just happy to be with a legend and gave him their all. And their resumes were nothing to sneeze at, Young being long featured with Jimmie Lunceford and later with Dizzy Gillespie and at Jazz at the Philharmonic; Kyle, as a member of the John Kirby Sextet, influenced young Bud Powell; and Deems, billed as “The World’s Fastest Drummer,” enhanced the bands of Joe Venuti, Wingy Manone and Muggsy Spanier, among others.\n\nThe All Stars had also become a global phenomenon by this point, conquering Europe in 1948, 1949 and 1952, Japan in 1953 and Australia in 1954. In a January 16, 1954 letter to Glaser, Armstrong already remarked about being called an “ambassador of goodwill.” But not only were the criticisms leveled against him reaching a fever pitch by this point, he hadn’t had a solid hit record since 1951.\n\nEnter George Avakian. After Avakian pioneered the jazz reissue series with releases of Armstrong’s Hot Fives and Sevens in the 1940s, he continued to do this in the long-play era, specifically with a best-selling four-volume series, The Louis Armstrong Story. Armstrong was paid a flat rate for those records in the 1920s and early 1930s so he received no royalties from any of the reissues. Avakian had grown dismayed about Armstrong recording almost nothing but pop tunes for Decca and wanted nothing more than to record the trumpeter in his present form, but Armstrong was locked in an exclusive contract with Decca from 1949-1954.\n\nAvakian had an idea: he offered Glaser royalties to Armstrong on all sales for THE LOUIS ARMSTRONG STORY series in return for permission to have him record an Armstrong album of W.C. Handy compositions. Glaser agreed and the result, LOUIS ARMSTRONG PLAYS W. C. HANDY, became one of the high-points of Armstrong’s career. Not only was it a strong seller, but it pleased the trumpeter (“They’re perfect—they’re my tops, I think,” he told Leonard Feather) and the critics (Nat Hentoff gave it five stars in DownBeat and wrote, “This LP is one of the greatest recordings not only of the year, but of jazz history. After years of wandering in a Decca desert (with very few oases) Louis finally had a full-ranged shot at the kind of material he loves, along with the kind of freedom that George Avakian provides at a jazz date.”).\n\nGlaser couldn’t deny the results. He refused to sign another exclusive contract with Decca, instead letting both labels take turns recording Armstrong throughout 1955. In April of that year, Avakian came up with the home run idea of having the All Stars cover nine tunes written by Fats Waller. SATCH PLAYS FATS once again became a hit, critically and commercially. Decca, meanwhile, was having Armstrong cover the Crew Cuts’ KO KO MO with Gary Crosby and doing his own versions of other people’s hits including early rock ballads like SINCERELY, PLEDGING MY LOVE and ONLY YOU The results didn’t make a dent in the charts. By September 1955, Glaser had seen enough; Avakian would have full reign to record the trumpeter over the next year.\n\nBut time was already ticking: on September 30, the All Stars were due to leave on a three-month tour of Europe, not returning to the States until December 31. On September 19, Avakian wrote to Glaser with an idea to record Kurt Weill’s MORITAT (BALLAD OF MACK THE KNIFE). Glaser finagled Armstrong’s schedule to have the All Stars record MACK THE KNIFE and BACK O’ TOWN BLUESfor Columbia on September 28, and the resulting single was an absolute smash hit for Armstrong, giving him another song he would have to perform at every concert for the rest of his career.\n\nAvakian was now three-for-three with his Armstrong recording projects and he wasn’t about to let the European tour stop him. In fact, he was more inspired than ever after seeing the reception Armstrong was getting in Europe this time around. It was time to record “America’s Ambassador of Goodwill” in action and Armstrong creating tremendous buzz and even literally causing riots from overly enthusiastic fans in Oslo and Hamburg, Avakian was ready to rely on the entire Columbia media empire to do it.\n\nSESSION (C), AMSTERDAM, OCTOBER 30, 1955\n\nThe first order of business would be recording a complete All Stars concert, which Avakian did at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam on October 30. The band had a new clarinetist in time for the tour in the form of Edmond Hall of New Orleans. Bigard had grown bored and tired by the end of his tenure and he could no longer disguise that fact in his playing. When Hall arrived in September, Armstrong wrote to Joe Glaser, “You sure did send a good man this time…Yea—Edman [sic] Hall is one of the very best, there is, on the Clarinet…A man whom I’ve always admired as a great musician, from the very first time I heard him, until, this very day…I personally, think that he will lift up the band a hundred percent.”\n\nArmstrong was right. Hall’s fire meshed perfectly with Armstrong’s powerful lead and Young’s roaring trombone. In the opinion of many—including this writer—this would be the greatest edition of the All Stars Armstrong would ever lead.\n\nAvakian recorded the complete concert, but didn’t think much of it was up to his high standards. His notes on the recording survive and contain complaints like, “Not very useful,” “not too good” and “tempo drags.” There’s also keys into Avakian’s mind in how he could salvage certain tracks: “Cut out bass solo (sloppy time),” “Cut Ed Hall's vocal and jump to his clarinet solo?,” “There are drum crashes before reprises of lst chorus which may be useful for cover-ups,” “Repair 1st phrase by copying repeat” and more.\n\nIn the end, Avakian would use two tracks, WHEN IT’S SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH and INDIANA, on Satchmo the Great, and four—TIN ROOF BLUES, DARDANELLA, UNDECIDED and MUSKRAT RAMBLE—on Ambassador Satch. He also saved edited versions of a few numbers (making the edits based on his aforementioned notes), a complete BACK O’TOWN BLUES that he did like and a closing SLEEPY TIME that could serve as a possible album closer. Unfortunately, that is all that apparently survives from Avakian’s recording; neither Sony’s vaults, nor Avakian’s private collection (now housed at the New York Public Library) contains the original Columbia reels of the full, unedited concert. A low-quality version of the complete concert does survive in the private hands of collectors and it illustrates a much better evening than Avakian’s notes allude to.\n\nClearly, what does survive is top notch. After Teagarden left in 1951, Armstrong recorded a vocal version of WHEN IT’S SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH with a Gordon Jenkins arrangement for Decca. Instead of offering it as a short, instrumental theme, he began singing it at the start of every show. “The people who are there come there to hear what we swing,” Armstrong said in a later television interview. “From the moment we hit ‘Pale moon shining,’ you know, the theme song, everybody sits right there and relax. And from that first note on, the warmth is there.”\n\nINDIANA followed, part of the standard one-two opening of almost every All Stars show, though the song doesn’t show up in the Armstrong discography until January 1951, when Armstrong called it to open his SATCHMO AT PASADENA show, recorded by Decca. It didn’t become the regular opener until after that album was released in 1952. He soon discovered that the tune made for an ideal warm-up for him to get his chops settled into a groove. Dedicated Armstrong fans could tell if their hero was going to have a good night or a great night based solely on his playing on “Indiana.” From that first 1951 performance to the 1955 version at the Concertgebouw, Armstrong rarely played the same solo twice. He worked on his 32 bars every night, first solidifying four bars, then eight and so on until he finally had a set solo he was proud of by 1956; once set, he rarely changed it into the late-1960s, when diminishing chops forced him to cut the solo entirely.\n\nTIN ROOF BLUES always made for a nice change of pace, a slower-than-slow blues originally made famous by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. It only appeared infrequently in the early years of the All Stars but after Jo Stafford had a hit record with a vocal version titled MAKE LOVE TO ME in 1954, it became a standard part of every show, always during Armstrong’s “trip down to my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana.” It’s an atmospheric treatment with few fireworks. This is not a bad thing; Armstrong’s lead playing is unwavering while Young and Hall take sober, effective solos.\n\nYoung and Hall are also featured on UNDECIDED and DARDANELLA respectively, two of their most frequently called showcases. Early versions of “Undecided” swung at an uptempo but Young began counting it off faster and faster as the years went by; later versions are even faster than this one. Though Young’s playing is as exciting as ever, Armstrong—like he did on many trombone features—almost steals it with his fiery solo and ensemble playing. The band messed up their entrance on the reprise, but Avakian smoothed it over with some fancy editing. Hall worked out the memorable treatment of “Dardanella” with pianist Kyle and it’s a good one, offering the clarinetist a chance to play softly at the start and finish, with his spiky tone generating heat in the middle.\n\nBACK O’TOWN BLUES is the only complete unissued performance that survives from Amsterdam (we have chosen not to included edited versions of MY BUCKET’S GOT A HOLE IN IT, PERDIDO, PRETTY LITTLE MISSY and BLUEBERRY HILL because they appear in complete form elsewhere on this set). Compared to the 1947 version, this one is pretty raucous, with a slightly faster tempo, more catcalls from the All Stars, a roaring Young solo and some more of that roof-shaking blues playing from Armstrong (who offers the quote of “Souvenir” that Teagarden introduced to the piece at Town Hall in 1947).\n\nMUSKRAT RAMBLE—dedicated to “all the musicians in the house”—is one of those performances that in just about six minutes completely sums up everything that made this edition of the All Stars so exciting. Though the band was technically playing an “arrangement”—the ensemble work and Armstrong’s strings of quotes had been chiseled and polished after years of performances—it’s still an intensely exciting performance as they pile up one climax after another. “Louis Armstrong and Trummy Young, those two guys…and Edmond Hall, that band, they could play louder than a nine man brass section of a big band, you know?” Arvell Shaw recalled. “And it wasn’t loud unpleasant, it was loud, it was just power, because those guys, they, they lived with their…profession, and they trained for it.” According to Phil Person, Dizzy Gillespie caught this edition of the All Stars and told drummer Barrett Deems that this was the hardest swinging band playing that style of jazz he’d ever heard. He’s still right.\n\nSESSION (D), PARIS INTERVIEW, C. NOVEMBER 17-DECEMBER 6, 1955\n\nAvakian now had an All Stars concert in the can, but he was only getting started. While in Europe for Armstrong’s tour, he ran into Edward R. Murrow, then at the height of his fame as the host of CBS television’s popular and influential documentary series, See It Now. Avakian told Murrow that he was in Europe recording Armstrong for Columbia and that Armstrong was blowing up as an ambassador of goodwill; perhaps Murrow wanted to film some of the tour? Murrow thought it was a great idea and built it into his trip, filming Armstrong’s arrival in Switzerland a week after the Amsterdam performance and some concert footage in Paris a week later, when Armstrong began a 19-day engagement at the Olympia Theater. After hours one night, Murrow sat down with Armstrong for an extended PARIS INTERVIEW, one that captured the trumpeter at his most animated and the journalist at his more stilted (has “boogie woogie” ever been pronounced with so much stiffness?). Armstrong’s in control from the outset, telling stories (the “solid-salad” one is a classic), teasing Murrow (“Dig Murrow, to-morrow!”), getting philosophical (his whimsical definition of a “cat”), getting in a knock at bop (“a passing fancy, dancy”) and even offering the time-honored story of the birth of the nickname “Satchmo” without being prodded.\n\nMurrow rushed the footage back to New York and it aired on December 12, 1955 on See It Now as part of an episode titled “Two American Originals” (the other being Grandma Moses). In the meantime, the publicity over Armstrong’s European tour had only continued to grow. On November 16, the front page of the New York Times featured an influential article by Felix Belair Jr. titled, “United States Has Secret Sonic Weapon—Jazz.” Running alongside a picture of Armstrong, Belair’s opening lines would be quoted in Murrow’s segment: “America's secret weapon is a blue note in a minor key. Right now its most effective ambassador is Louis (Satchmo) Armstrong. A telling propaganda line is the hopped-up tempo of a Dixieland band, heard on the Voice of America in far-off Tangier.” This was really the start of jazz musicians being viewed as an important tool in foreign relations. The State Department wasn’t involved yet but they didn’t need to be with the job Armstrong was already doing.\n\nMurrow and producer Fred Friendly loved having Armstrong as a subject and the positive reaction to the See It Now profile already had them thinking of ways to expand into a theatrical film. But before that could be done, Avakian still had an album to produce, one whose title now practically wrote itself: AMBASSADOR SATCH. Avakian met up with Armstrong at his hotel in Paris with an idea for a photo to use on the album’s eventual cover. “I decided that the album we would record would be called AMBASSADOR SATCH for the simple reason he was the greatest ambassador the United States could possible have,” Avakian said in 2014. “And to illustrate it properly, I thought why not have Louie on the cover of the album wearing an ambassador's morning clothes—but where do you get that in Paris on short notice?” Avakian asked Piet Beishuizen, Philips Records’ publicity director, where they could rent such an outfit. Beishuizen had the answer: “Oh, we don't have to do that,” he told Avakian. “Dr. E. B. W. Schuitema, the president of Philips, is going to give a speech tomorrow at an assembly of company presidents. He brought his morning clothes and we'll borrow it for the photograph from Dr. Schuitema.\"\n\nAvakian was skeptical. “And I said, 'Well, you can't do that! After all, he's the president of Philips Phonogram and what's more, Louis is 5 feet 4 inches tall and Dr. Schuitema is more like 6 feet 2!\" And Piet said, ‘It's not a problem. Lucille [Armstrong] can pin up the back of the jacket and we'll pin up his pants and it'll get by in the photograph.’” Avakian agreed and told Armstrong, who laughed and said, “Oh yeah, that’s the way to go!” Beishuizen and Avakian arrived at Armstrong’s suite with a photographer and did their best to make the suit fit the trumpeter, who chose to wear loafers for the occasion. (Avakian remembered his reaction: “Oh hell, he's wearing loafers.”)\n\nEverything went smoothly from then on but Avakian did relate one humorous incident to me in our 2014 conversation: “One of the delightful things about it is Louie took his horn out to blow a few notes for the hell of it—it had nothing to do with the photograph—and to my horror, he hit the spit valve, which means he ejected saliva that was clogging up part of the tubing, and spit landed, plop, just below the knot of the ascot that Louie had already put on! And I thought to myself, 'Well, it'll never show.' Of course, it did! But you know, of all the thousands of people who have seen that photograph, not one person commented on the fact that there seems to be a dark spot below the knot of the ascot. Nor did any one notice that Louie's trousers are flopping over the lip of the loafers—or even that he was wearing loafers with the morning clothes!”\n\nNow, with his cover photo already selected, it was time for Avakian to record more music.\n\nSESSION (E), MILAN, DECEMBER 20, 1955\n\nAvakian next caught up with Armstrong in Milan, Italy, where the trumpeter was immensely popular. After attending so many All Stars concerts on the three-month tour, Avakian knew that band was practically playing the same show every night, one that was very similar to the one he recorded in Amsterdam. He could have recorded a show in Milan and hoped for better quality performances, but instead, he had a smarter idea: to record the All Stars after an evening of playing and to treat it like a studio session instead of a live recording.\n\nAvakian booked the empty Teatro Leonardo da Vinci for the session, commencing at 1 o’clock in the morning immediately after the All Stars played two concerts at Teatro Nuovo (though Armstrong himself later claimed he performed three).\n\nThe theater wouldn’t be empty for long. Armstrong and the All Stars arrived with not only their usual entourage of wives, friends, girlfriends, valet and road manager, but also a few dozen overly enthusiastic young Italian fans. The revelers took their place in the seats but Avakian still wanted to treat it like a studio session, planning to add fake applause in postproduction. He demanded quiet and recorded the first number, another rollicking version of INDIANA, probably Armstrong’s request to make sure the chops were still “percolating” after such a long evening’s work. They certainly were.\n\nBut at this point, Avakian, probably taken in by the spirit of the fans who crashed the session, told the young fans to cheer and react as if it was a concert. They were more than up for the challenge, which turned out to be a smart move as Armstrong was always extra inspired performing in front of enthusiastic fans. A party atmosphere of pure love and joy between performers and fans began to arise.\n\nSOMEDAY YOU’LL BE SORRY was the next choice, Armstrong’s own composition that he debuted on record shortly after the Town Hall concert. He originally gave it a tender, ballad treatment but after Trummy Young joined the All Stars and their excitement quotient rose as a result, Armstrong began to jump SOMEDAY, always with fine results. Takes two and four are included here, both infectious and consistently excellent. Surviving correspondence shows that Avakian loved this performance and even worked out a deal with Decca to get permission to release it but for some reason, it didn’t make it on to the final album.\n\nNext Edmond Hall was given a chance to record CLARINET MARMALADE, one of his most exciting features. To give the impression that this was recorded in France, Avakian even had Armstrong record an introduction in French, with humorous results. He was covering all bases, recording announcements and even encores when appropriate, though this number also was left off the finished product.\n\nBecause the second reel from Milan is missing, the next three performances are heard as originally issued on AMBASSADOR SATCH, with Avakian’s postproduction work in place. WEST END BLUES is a special choice, as the 1928 original recording was one of the milestones of 20th century music. This one isn’t but that’s no reason to disparage it; in fact, it’s still an outstanding performance, one that has grown on me so much over the years, I listen to it almost as often as the iconic original version. The opening cadenza is slower and more dramatically paced than the original; he takes his time, to great effect. He might have lost a few miles off his fastball and a little of his breath control (he can’t hold the climactic note for the full four bars as he did in 1928), but just listen to his tone and the way he hits the high notes on the nose, especially the gigantic fat high C he hits after the descending arpeggios, conveying everything he wants to in just a single note. (Only a couple of sections from Trummy’s solo come from take 1—notice the change in cymbals. The rest is all take 2.)\n\nThe next tune only needed one take to nail, ROYAL GARDEN BLUES. Unlike the fast, but not-too-fast (half-fast?) versions from 1947, ROYAL GARDEN BLUES got a turbocharged treatment in the mid-50s and beyond. Like MUSKRAT RAMBLE from Amsterdam, it’s another one of the great Armstrong-Hall-Young performances in terms of excitement, with Armstrong in Herculean form during his solo and the encore. Avakian knew he had a winner and made this the opening track on AMBASSADOR SATCH.\n\nUp to this point, the All Stars had recorded only numbers already in their book but Avakian’s next choice came from out of left field: THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR, a German folk song originally known as DER TREUE HUSSAR and written circa 1825. Armstrong heard it in Dusseldorf but probably never played it until Milan. Fortunately for Avakian, it fit the band like a glove, especially Armstrong, with its melody based on three quarter-notes at a time (a rhythmic hallmark of King Oliver’s playing). Shaw also deserves credit for his tremendously powerful bass lines. Avakian recorded multiple takes, notating that take three was “exceptionally wonderful” and questioning that take four might have been “better?” Back in New York, he edited the best parts together to form a rocking, six-minute performance, complete with some gutbucket shouting by Young and Armstrong’s time-honored feat of playing the melody an octave higher in the encore (Armstrong also calls Billy Kyle “Crazy Otto,” a reference to the popular German jazz and pop pianist Fritz Schulz-Reichel). A humorous aspect involves Armstrong never being able to remember the title, leading him to announce it as “Huzzah Cuzzah.” Even though this was a session and Avakian could have corrected him, Armstrong’s mangling of it was too good to leave out. We have also included an edited single that Avakian rushed out for release on Columbia’s international label, Phillips, featuring none of the fake applause of the AMBASSADOR SATCHversion and a different solo by Kyle (with Trummy Young shouting out the name of boogie woogie pianist “Pete Johnson” amidst Armstrong’s cries of “Crazy Otto!”).\n\nThe rest of the Milan session does survive in full, allowing listeners the opportunity to hear how the rest of the issued—and unissued—material originally sounded in those early morning hours. TIGER RAG was an inspired choice Avakian credited to Hall. Though long associated with Armstrong, the tune does not seem to have made it into the All Stars’s repertoire after the 1947 Town Hall version. Thus, a bit of rehearsing had to be done as the band found a key, straightened out the changes and worked out a routine, centered around Armstrong and Young panicking about a tiger going to bite them, breaking up the Italians in attendance. Once everything was settled, the All Stars caught fire and delivered two burning takes, plus an encore, with the best parts spliced together to create the finale track on AMBASSADOR SATCH(a separate edit was issued as a single by Philips). The unedited takes can now be heard heard here for the first time without the fake applause. Hall especially commands attention with both his scorching solo and ensemble work.\n\nTrummy was up next with YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME, which Armstrong introduced in 1931 and was still featuring himself on at Pasadena in 1951. On December 6, Young and Shaw broke away in Paris one evening to record an LP for the Ducretet-Thomson label, TRUMMY YOUNG AND HIS FIFTY-FIFTY BAND with the likes of Guy Lafitte, Andre Persiany and Kansas Fields. A jumped version of YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME was a highlight of the session so it made sense for Young to call it two weeks later in Milan, even though this edition of All Stars had never played it together (the original session tape features Kyle leading the band through the bridge to make sure they have the right changes). Once the impromptu rehearsal ended (with Shaw instructing everyone to “Wail!”), the band again demonstrated just what pros they were by nailing it in one take, plus performing an extra encore. Young demonstrates the smooth, double-timed lines that made him an associate of the early boppers, as well as his more shouting style that endeared him to Jazz at the Philharmonic audiences (dig his quote of CANDY). Armstrong owns his solo and especially his full chorus and rideout lead during the encore; how much swinging can one band produce in a single night?\n\nAvakian’s next choice, LONESOME ROAD, might have seemed like a good idea on paper but it wasn’t suitable for the album. In 1931, Armstrong and his big band (and various friends) recorded a hilarious version of the quasi-spiritual, everybody taking turns joking around with “Reverend Armstrong.” Avakian thought they could recreate in Milan with the excited Italian fans, but without any rehearsal, the results have a “you-had-to-be-there” feeling, with some of the fans getting a little too anxious to sing along (the fan Armstrong tells, “Don’t sing louder than me, Brother” was Gianni Tollara, who still got a featured role in Avakian’s liner notes to the album). Once again, though, the All Stars’s instrumental spot is as serious as it gets, Deems really laying it down, while Armstrong alludes to I WANT A LITTLE GIRL at the start (right after he, too, can be heard urging the band to “Wail” in the background before picking up his horn).\n\nFor the final All Stars full band feature, Avakian chose the demanding THAT’S A PLENTY, which the All Stars probably hadn’t played since Young’s first night with the group in 1952. After a bit of rehearsing and a couple of false starts, everything came together for a positively incendiary take, Armstrong’s trumpet still hitting the high, hard ones after playing multiple concerts and a recording session that was now into overtime. An encore seemed like the perfect punctuation mark to the session—only for Avakian to call out, “Once again, would you?” Instead of balking, they counted it right off and did it one more time, though Young and Shaw can’t seem to get together on what strain they’re playing during the trombone solo, one of the pitfalls of the early jazz repertoire (Young actually seems to anticipate the changes incorrectly both times during the second strain). Everything eventually syncs, leading up to another exciting closing ensemble, Armstrong still knocking out those repeated high concert Bb’s, topping it off with a high concert D. Bravo, Pops.\n\nWith that, Armstrong earned a much needed rest, but Avakian still wasn’t done, wanting to capture Hall’s DARDANELLA again. On the two previously unissued takes here, Hall comes up with some new ideas but everyone sounds a little tired (with good reason); Avakian still ended up using the live version from Amsterdam. With that, the session was finally waved off in the early hours of the morning, Billy Kyle playing a few triumphant bars of Paramount’s newsreel theme as a humorous way to conclude what must have been one of the most exhausting nights of Armstrong’s life.\n\nBut instead of asking for pity, Armstrong felt triumphant. After the album was released, Armstrong sat down for a radio interview with disc jockey Joe Jeru in Benton Harbor, Michigan. When Jeru complimented Armstrong on his AT THE CRESCENDOlive album for Decca, Armstrong responded by making no secret of his preference. “Okay, but you can get a later album than that,” he said. “AMBASSADOR SATCH. That I made in Milano, Italy, just coming out over here. It’s better than THE CRESCENDO. Dig that. And we made that after the third concert in Milano. We did three concerts that day, with intermission included. And 1:00 that night, we begin to record that AMBASSADOR SATCH. And at 5:00 in the morning, we’re wailing WEST END BLUES. See what I mean? And TIGER RAG, you ain’t never heard TIGER RAG in your life like them cats, the longer they played it. But that’s what I’m talking about. If you didn’t feel good, you couldn’t do that. You can’t force those things.”\n\nAfter the HANDY and FATS albums,MACK THE KNIFE, the New York Times story, Murrow’s See It Now special and the Amsterdam and Milan recordings, Avakian was more sure than ever that Armstrong’s boost in popularity would only benefit Columbia. On December 29, he prepared to sign Armstrong to an exclusive contract with his label. In a letter to Goddard Lieberson, the head of the entire record division, Avakian recounted a phone conversation he had with Glaser in which Glaser said it would take a $50,000 advance to sign Armstrong. It was a lot of money, but he told Lieberson, “In any case I feel that to make a large advance to get Armstrong would be a worthwhile investment because Armstrong is certain to emerge in the immediate as well as long-range future as one of the very few great jazz musicians of all time. I think that any money invested in him now is better spent than it would be for any other purpose that I can think of off hand.”\n\nAvakian came back to the States with hours of material from Amsterdam and Milan to edit an entire album from. However, it didn’t take long before he received a devastating piece of news: Decca came out of the woods claiming that any Armstrong recording they released between 1951 and 1954 had a five-year restriction and could not be recorded and released by any other label within a five-year period of time. This included the complete SATCHMO AT SYMPHONY HALL, which Decca was holding to a January 15, 1951 release date, instead of the 1947 recording date, as well as SATCHMO AT PASADENA, recorded on January 30, 1951 and released in 1952.\n\nThose two albums alone contained a number of tracks Avakian could not release: MUSKRAT RAMBLE, ROYAL GARDEN BLUES, SOMEDAY YOU’LL BE SORRY (rerecorded for Decca in 1953, as well), YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME, THAT’S A PLENTY, WHEN IT’s SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH and INDIANA. In short, a good chunk of the recordings Avakian had already earmarked for AMBASSADOR SATCH were now off the table.\n\nAvakian dealt with this in two ways. After the All Stars arrived back in the States on December 31, 1955, they were in Hollywood by January 6 to begin filming High Society with Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra. While out there, Avakian scheduled a studio date in Los Angeles on January 24, 1956 to record a few more numbers for the album. He then realized that January 24 was nine days after the January 15, 1951 five-year restriction date for the SATCHMO AT SYMPHONY HALL tracks. Shrewdly, he gave MUSKRAT RAMBLE from Amsterdam and ROYAL GARDEN BLUESLos Angeles matrix numbers in line with the January 24 session. Decca couldn’t touch them because Columbia’s files said they were recorded after the restriction date. Of course, this threw discographical research into disarray for decades; as late as 2007, Avakian was still confused, telling me that those two numbers must have been done in Los Angeles because of the matrix numbers. It wasn’t until I had the time to study the Armstrong file Chris Albertson rescued from the trash at Columbia in the 1970s that it all made sense to me, with Avakian writing “Via 1-24-56 date” after “Royal Garden” and “Muskrat” on a list of “free and clear” tunes for the AMBASSADOR SATCHalbum. (It should be noted here that all the preceding and following quotes from Avakian memos, letters or session notes come from Albertson’s file. We owe him a heavy debt of gratitude for not only rescuing it, but for sharing the contents with the world on the internet.)\n\nAfter some debating over choices, Avakian chose to go with four tracks from Milan and four tracks from Amsterdam. He still needed two more and those would be recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nSESSION (F), COLUMBIA STUDIOS, LOS ANGELES, JANUARY 24, 1956\n\nAfter going from an actual concert recording to a “live” session with a partial audience, the finalAMBASSADOR SATCH date was a regular studio session with no audience present. First up was TWELFTH STREET RAG, a longtime staple of the All Stars’s repertoire and one that was a highlight of the See It Now piece. Avakian might have felt a connection to the piece since it was one of the “lost” Hot Seven recordings that he discovered and issued for the first time back in 1940. TWELFTH STREET RAG was Armstrong’s good-natured satire on the more corny strain of traditional jazz. On it, he always encouraged his sidemen to ham it up; onstage, Edmond Hall would break into a dance during his solo, Trummy Young would play hunched over, his slide almost hitting the floor, Barrett Deems would stand up and crash two hi-hat cymbals together bombastically with his hands and Arvell Shaw would take a bop-inspired “Oo-Shoo-Be-Do-Be” scat break. Everyone always had a good time though oddly enough Armstrong, for all the cries about his clowning, usually played quite seriously on TWELFTH STREET RAG, leading the ensembles with great strength and taking two riveting breaks in the first chorus.\n\nOn the Los Angeles date, Avakian first let the band perform its full arrangement as if they were on stage before suggesting they shorten it by having everyone split choruses. The sixth take was marked as the “Master” and we have treated it that way, but in actuality, the final master was made up of bits of takes three, five and the bulk of six, each heard here completely undoctored. Armstrong’s trumpet playing sounds a little strained by the sixth go-around but that’s when Hall and Young hit their groove. Young attempted to play smoother than usual on the first five takes but when he let loose a bit on the sixth take the way he normally he did on stage, Avakian grabbed that one for the master. Choices like this caused critics to complain that Young had become nothing but a “tasteless battering ram” (in the words of Jack Tracy in Down Beat) but the unissued takes showed he still possessed a smooth touch.\n\nOn the issued version, Armstrong could be heard speaking occasionally in the background, cheering on the soloists, but all of that was done in Los Angeles. Avakian simply recorded Armstrong in the studio shouting brief bits of encouragement (“Yeah yeah!”) and the names of his sidemen (“Edmond Hall!” “Yeah, Trummy!”). He chopped them up and peppered them throughout the album in postproduction; you can also hear it on ROYAL GARDEN BLUES and THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR. He really did think of everything!\n\nThe next—and final AMBASSADOR SATCH—track would be ALL OF ME, a brilliant choice. Armstrong first recorded it in 1932 and had a sizeable hit with it, but with the All Stars, it was a feature for Velma Middleton. Avakian recorded Middleton’s version in Amsterdam but wasn’t too thrilled by it so in Los Angeles, he suggested they do it as an Armstrong feature. It wasn’t easy; it would require nine takes to complete it, many early takes breaking down because of unfamiliarity with how they were going to approach it (on one early take, Armstrong angrily shouts, “Break, dammit!” when the rhythm section forgets to stop during his vocal). The previously unissued third take was the first complete one finished but one can hear the band still piecing it together, Armstrong verbally calling out in the background, “Next chorus, play the same thing we play for Velma,” a reference to the triplet phrases in the middle of the rideout, as well as the break and short tag at the end. Armstrong ends on a fat high note causing everyone to say, “Yeah,” upon its conclusion but Armstrong’s internal clock knows something is wrong, as he immediately says, “Too long.” Indeed, on ensuing takes, Hall and Young would split a chorus but there’s still some bumps along the way as even on take seven, there’s a misplaced break in the rhythm section during the vocal. But Armstrong and the All Stars overcame the challenges to turn in one of the highlights of the album. Hearing the unissued takes, Armstrong, in particular, was feeling creative, singing a completely different vocal on each take. The ninth and final take was the best from start to finish except for a trumpet clam in the opening chorus. Avakian spliced in the first chorus from the sixth take (which was a breakdown) and then bathed the result in fake applause, with a dramatic introduction in Italian by vocalist Ray Martino, recorded in Milan. For this set, instead of issuing partial takes, Andreas Meyer has replicated Avakian’s original splice between the sixth and ninth takes to offer an unfiltered listen to a track that has delighted Armstrong fans for nearly 60 years.\n\nWith that, AMBASSADOR SATCH, was a wrap. Avakian did his edits, rushed it through postproduction and released it in late April. On April 25, Avakian wrote, “I don’t think any album in record history has ever had such a send-off by any organization.” Even the cover photograph of Louis in Dr. E. B. W. Schuitema’s morning clothes in front of a plain white background created a buzz. Avakian originally wanted to just use the photo from the waist up, but when he saw how “wonderful” Armstrong looked standing up in the suit—even with the pants draped over his loafers—Avakian knew he had to use the whole image. “That picture really said the whole thing,” he said in 2014. “You look at it and there he is, smiling away happily, resenting the greatest democracy on the face of the earth and the most democratic music of all.” In the August 11, 1956 issue of Billboard, a panel of “experts in the field of industrial design and graphic arts” named it the “winner of first place in the Pop category.”\n\nThe Los Angeles session even featured a 16-minute conversation between Avakian and Armstrong, to be used as part of the promotion. Once again, Avakian tried maintaining the European feel of the album by pretending they were in Milan onstage after the session in December. It’s a wonderful snapshot of a long-standing friendship between two giants of jazz, Armstrong more relaxed around his friend than he was with Murrow (and for those listeners who don’t know why Avakian jokes about being uncomfortable with Armstrong wanting to go “around the world” with him, well, Google it!).\n\nAvakian now had enough material for the album, but he still wanted to record two more songs to make a single, considering that MACK THE KNIFE had officially become a hit while Armstrong was overseas. One tune he chose was the old Al Jolson chestnut, WHEN THE RED, RED ROBIN (COMES BOB, BOB BOBBIN’ ALONG), which was then featured in the Lillian Roth biopic, I’ll Cry Tomorrow, as sung by Susan Hayward. Though the finished performance clocked in at barely two minutes, it’s a pretty explosive, the final outchorus showing that the All Stars could find the heat in just about any material. A neat touch was Armstrong trading with himself, splitting a short muted trumpet spot with his scat vocal, something assumed to have been overdubbed later, but after hearing the two different takes included here, it’s revealed that Armstrong actually picked up his horn with lightning speed to contribute the different statements on each take. Avakian ended up making a few different edited masters, including adding fake applause to one 45-rpm release to pass it off as a live recording on some European issues. Once again, we’ve unraveled everything to include two complete, untouched takes.\n\nAvakian was so impressed with the All Stars’s performance of THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR in Milan that he smelled the makings of a hit. Back in the States, he wrote new lyrics to the old German song and called the result SIX FOOT FOUR. It was kind of silly, but as always, Armstrong sells it. After first attempting it at the same tempo as the Milan version, Avakian asked them to do it a quicker pace. Once they nailed it, he still wasn’t satisfied and after RED, RED ROBIN was in the can, Avakian had Trummy Young overdub some spoken responses behind Armstrong’s vocal, as well as having the trumpeter add an obligato to his own voice. This set includes a complete earlier, slower take, as well as the master with Louis and Trummy doing their thing.\n\nThough the album was finished, Columbia still didn’t have an official signed contract from Joe Glaser. Five days before the Los Angeles session, Avakian wrote to Columbia President Jim Conkling and told him how important it was to finalize the contract for AMBASSADOR SATCH “before anything happens like Decca casting our relationship with Armstrong into some sort of turmoil.” Glaser had made some last-minute financial demands and Avakian wanted to satiate him. However, Conkling was wary, writing back, “George, I am against this (because of the Economics) but am sending it along as you requested—to get the Album—and to keep Decca away for the moment.”\n\nWith the album approved, Avakian set his sights on signing Armstrong to a long-term contract with Columbia. He even had a summary of royalties drawn up for everything Armstrong had been paid on the four LOUIS ARMSTRONG STORY albums, plus LOUIS ARMSTRONG PLAYS W. C. HANDY, SATCH PLAYS FATS and MACK THE KNIFE. Columbia started paying Armstrong royalties for the early albums in 1954 as part of the HANDY deal; from that point to January 31, 1956, Armstrong had earned $22,089.74, which would amount to about $190,000 in 2014 money. Avakian was sure Glaser would be impressed and make a deal to stay with the label.\n\nGlaser wasn’t planning on going anywhere else for the time being. On February 2, Avakian and Glaser worked out a deal for Armstrong and Dave Brubeck to perform—and record—at Lewisohn Stadium in July. However, when the Stadium requested an additional date in case of rain, Glaser angrily wrote back that Armstrong was receiving between $4,000 and $6,000 per night and holding a rain date would result in conceding that kind of money. Clearly, the real money was being made in the live performances, not the recordings and that was something Glaser did not want to mess with.\n\nAt the same time, Glaser informed Avakian that Armstrong would be performing at a special concert on June 1 in Chicago, one that would be hosted by Helen Hayes and would benefit the Chicago chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Glaser wanted Avakian to record it, but Avakian wasn’t impressed. Not only was he unsure of Hayes was going to do but after recording Armstrong in Europe and coming up against all the Decca restrictions, Avakian wasn’t ready to run back so quickly and record another live album. “Next, I will have to make sure that Armstrong plays some repertoire which we can record,” Avakian wrote in a memo to Conkling. “This last is a point which I don’t want to stress to Glaser yet, but once we sign Louis I will have to shape his repertoire so that it includes material which he has not recorded in the last few years. It will not be easy to do this, and I will have to ask Glaser to put his foot down on the subject, and if necessary have the band lay off for a few days simply to rehearse new repertoire. I know from experience that they won’t do it while they are also working.”\n\nSESSION (G), CARNEGIE HALL, NYC, MARCH 17, 1956\n\nAvakian already had success in helping to shape Armstrong’s repertoire because the trumpeter had started featuring MACK THE KNIFE in his live shows in early 1956. A battle with conjunctivitis (caused by constant cigarette smoke getting in his eyes from the cigarette holder he held in High Society)landed Armstrong in New York’s Eye and Ear Infirmary in early February, before one more trip to Los Angeles at the end of the month to finish working on High Society. On March 9, the All Stars launched a joint tour with Woody Herman that would occupy them until April 1. It was at Carnegie Hall on March 17, that this fine version of MACK THE KNIFE was recorded, the All Stars already sounding very comfortable with it, though they had only been playing it live for a few weeks. Arvell Shaw’s bubbling two-beat bass playing is especially effective behind the vocal.\n\nAvakian liked this performance—and undoubtedly, Armstrong’s impromptu dedication of it to him—and later issued it in full on the later Satchmo the Great album. However, Avakian didn’t record Armstrong at Carnegie Hall; more-than-likely, it was recorded by Stephen F. Temmer, the founder of Gotham Studios and a man who frequently recorded performances at Carnegie Hall and who released another performance from this concert on an unnumbered Gotham LP. My conclusion is Temmer recorded the entire concert, knew Avakian would dig Armstrong’s dedication, made a copy of just MACK THE KNIFE and gave it to him because the this is only tune on the surviving reel. Avakian loved it and issued it but since he didn’t have permission to record it, gave it a Lewisohn Stadium location and a July 14 date. Though still sharp as a tack at age 94, Avakian is the first to admit that putting together these albums was such a whirlwind that he no longer remembers where all of the finished masters come from.\n\nGlaser was at Carnegie Hall—Armstrong calls out to him jokingly on THAT’S MY DESIRE—but might have been in a bad mood because of his most recent dealing with Columbia over SIX FOOT FOUR. Because THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR was a public domain number to begin with and only he was responsible for the new lyrics, Avakian was prepared to release the tune giving himself credit as lyricist (under the pseudonym “Dots Morrow”) and publishing it with April Music. But Glaser angrily wrote to Avakian that Armstrong should receive composer credit for THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR, co-composer credit for SIX FOOT FOUR and that the tune should be published with Glaser’s firm, International Music, instead of April. He was also upset about how Columbia wanted to split up the royalties.\n\nAvakian didn’t budge. “I gave Joe some mild but firm hell about how he always brags that his word is so good, and here he was not only going back on his word but also his signature,” he wrote to his bosses at Columbia. “He simply repeated, ‘It’s a bad deal and Decca wouldn’t never hold me to it,’ so I told him I would cancel the record at once.”\n\nWithholding the record bothered Glaser tremendously. He wrote to Avakian on March 22, “Under the situation that prevails, I have no alternative but to advise you and your associates that we will forget about recording Louis Armstrong in the future with Columbia Records.” Avakian figured Glaser was bluffing and told him to compare what Armstrong made from Columbia with what he made from Decca. But when Glaser did this, he compared Armstrong’s two years with Columbia with his 21-year back catalog at Decca. Naturally, the Decca numbers looked more favorable when skewed that way. Glaser ran with it and wrote to Avakian on March 28, “I deeply regret the fact that unless you want to give me the same terms on Louis Armstrong’s music, songs, etc. that I have obtained from Decca and Victor in the past, as I advised you in my recent letter, I am not interested in any contract with Columbia.”\n\nThis could not have happened at a worse time. On April 2, Armstrong was heading to Australia and Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly planned on following him there to record more footage for an expanded See It Now profile. “Also, we do not as yet have Armstrong under contract, although Friendly doesn’t know this—I didn’t tell him,” Avakian wrote to Conkling and Lieberson on April 2. “Therefore we can’t be very firm in our dealing with Murrow and Friendly at the moment.”\n\nThere was no more time to play hardball. That same day, Avakian wrote a separate memo to Conkling and Lieberson in which he laid out the terms of a proposed long-term contract for Armstrong at Columbia: “Length of contract: 5 years’ exclusivity for $250,000 advance (including talent cost of sessions), to be spread over 10 years. (I believe we gave in on our wish to make it 7 years, and I know we gave in on the idea of $200,000 for 5 years plus option for $50,000 for 2 more years.)....Minimum sides: 36 per year, costs deducted from advance. We also told Joe we would record as much more as was felt would be worthwhile, as we were anxious to build catalog. We said we would shoot for 48.”\n\nGlaser wouldn’t commit to any deal at the moment, which was okay because the filming of the Australian tour fell through, buying Avakian some extra time.\n\nSESSIONS (H AND I), EMPRESS HALL, LONDON AND ACCRA, GHANA, MAY 1956\n\nBy early May, Murrow and Friendly did get the green light to continue their Armstrong film. Not only would they shoot the band during Armstrong’s first trip to London since 1934, but Murrow had Glaser squeeze into Armstrong’s itinerary a three-day tour of the Gold Coast of Africa, soon to become Ghana. Murrow’s cameras caught many priceless images during this month: a stomping live performance of MY BUCKET’S GOT A HOLE IN IT at Empress Hall in London; the sound of the All Stars joining various African musicians on SLY MONGOOSE, re-titled ALL FOR YOU, LOUIS for the occasion; and a hot, extended jam session on ROYAL GARDEN BLUES that became the soundtrack to a stirring scene in which the native Africans enthusiastically danced with their American counterparts including Lucille Armstrong and Velma Middleton.\n\nMurrow knew he had captured some scenes that would really strengthen his resulting documentary, to be titled first, The Saga of Satchmo, and finally later, Satchmo the Great. Because the recording quality from the television cameras wasn’t as good as professional recording equipment, Avakian loaded up the eventual soundtrack with similar performances he had recorded in this period, only using “Sly Mongoose” directly from the soundtrack. Avakian’s brother, Aram, served as an editor of the film and he made copies of all of the film’s audio. In preparing this set, we found Aram Avakian’s original reels, made before Murrow overdubbed narration on top of the performances. “My Bucket’s Got a Hole In It” and “Royal Garden Blues” are being released here for the first time, the latter definitely worth some extra attention as it is a rare “jam session” performance from the All Stars as they improvise new variations for chorus after chorus, never letting the intensity drop (even though the tempo sure rises!) while playing for the dancers.\n\nJack Lesberg joined the band on bass for their overseas swing through Australia, the United Kingdom and Africa, later saying, “Nothing could ever top touring with Louis.” He replaced Arvell Shaw, who left on bad terms although the two men did settle their differences, with Shaw returning from 1963-1965, and once again for Armstrong’s final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1971. Shaw spoke of Armstrong only in glowing terms after the trumpeter passed, but he also managed to stretch the truth a bit, always placing himself on Armstrong’s two African tours, when in actuality, he made neither.\n\nSESSION (J), MEDINA TEMPLE, CHICAGO, JUNE 1, 1956\n\nWhile the All Stars were making headlines with their performances in the United Kingdom and Africa, preparations were underway for the Multiple Sclerosis Society benefit concert in Chicago with Helen Hayes. Though Avakian still didn’t have a long-term contract with Glaser, he did agree to record the concert to appease him. “Frankly, I expect nothing to come of the Armstrong-Hayes album idea,” Avakian wrote to Conkling back on March 23. “But I expect the collapse to come on Glaser’s side, and I also want to prevent Glaser from ever saying in his peculiarly charming way, ‘When I wanted you to record Louis Armstrong with Helen Hayes, you people. . . .”\n\nGlaser was still gung ho about the event so there was no collapse on either side. Glaser actually agreed about the need for different repertoire, writing to Avakian that “it would be silly to record a concert with Helen Hayes if he were to record the numbers he’s playing.” Glaser added, “However, if a deal can be worked out, I will see that Louis plays many different tunes as he has many, many numbers in his repertoire—unless you would have some specific numbers in mind for him to do and if so, let me know and I will discuss all this with Louis on Thursday of this week when he comes in for the concert at the Fox Brooklyn Theatre.”\n\nArmstrong always gave hell to anyone--including Glaser--who tried to tell him what to play onstage so Avakian might have feared broaching the subject. But he still had a job to do and had to at least make some suggestions of different material for Armstrong to perform in Chicago. On May 11, he wrote to Glaser with a list of songs Armstrong hadn’t played since the 1920s such as “Potato Head Blues,” “Wild Man Blues” and “Mandy, Make Up Your Mind.” Down Beat Editor Jack Tracy wrote a script for Hayes to read on the theme of the evening, “Fifty Years of Jazz.” Armstrong would perform in sections on New Orleans, playing on riverboats, Chicago and New York, each one interspersed with Hayes’s narration. After an intermission, the All Stars would finally get a chance to tear out with their customary set.\n\nGlaser agreed with the setup, though he warned Avakian in a letter from May 12, “Since Louis is in Europe and I don’t know whether he has the various numbers you mention in his book or whether the men he has with him now are familiar with the numbers, I am not in a position to confirm any recording date in Chicago whereby Louis will play these numbers.”\n\nSure enough, there was no physical way for the All Stars to rehearse any new material. After the grueling United Kingdom tour, there were the three nonstop days in Africa. The All Stars flew back on May 26 and were performing again in Asbury Park on May 28, just four days before the Chicago concert. Armstrong did read through the script and chose numbers from his current repertoire that would be appropriate for each section. He wrote them down in green ink on the back of a torn envelope, a precious artifact that survives in the Jack Bradley Collection at the Louis Armstrong House Museum.\n\nAvakian didn’t attend the Chicago concert but he heard from Mason Coppinger, his engineer in that city, on June 4, Coppinger telling him, “The show was very well received here.” However, there were some problems: “I had trouble trying to get Louis to work on our mike,” Coppinger wrote. “For the most part he used the P.A. mike.” There was also difficulty with Hayes’s narration, though she pre-recorded it just in case. Jack Tracy’s script wasn’t exactly a work of art; he sent his copy to Avakian with an almost apologetic note, signing off with, “At any rate, this is it.”\n\nAll of Avakian’s original suspicions about the night had come true: the script was weak, Hayes’s narration wasn’t worth listening to and Armstrong didn’t play any of his suggestions—in addition to playing portions of a few numbers into the wrong microphone. Avakian did use BLACK AND BLUE and part of the New Orleans funeral medley of FLEE AS A BIRD and OH, DIDN’T HE RAMBLE on Satchmo the Great and he’d pass off INDIANA as being from Armstrong’s forthcoming At Newport album, but that was about it. The tapes went back on the shelves and that was that…\n\n…until 1980. It was then that Columbia reissue producer Michael Brooks saw some reel-to-reel tapes about to be discarded from the vaults. He investigated and saw the full tapes of the June 1, 1956 Chicago concert. He rescued them and issued it as a two-LP set, Chicago Concert, eliminating Hayes’s narration and offering indispensable, Grammy-nominated liner notes by Dan Morgenstern. Armstrong had been dead for almost a decade and all worries about playing the same songs every night and Decca “five-year restrictions” had dissipated. Instead, the issue was fully embraced for presenting an incredible evening of entertainment from Armstrong’s most exciting edition of the All Stars.\n\nThough it had been an exhausting year, the band doesn’t sound remotely tired in Chicago. Lesberg didn’t stay on with the band when it returned to America, so Dale “Deacon” Jones was called in to fill the bass chair. Jones had already replaced Shaw once before in the summer of 1951, staying for over a year. Though his solos sometimes fell apart a bit rhythmically, Jones’s swinging lines and great use of showmanship made a fan of Armstrong. On one of his private tapes, Armstrong related that the addition of Jones over Shaw elevated the quality of the band a great deal in his opinion.\n\nThe Chicago event was more of a show than a standard concert; along with Hayes’s narration, sets were built onstage and the All Stars had to indulge in a little choreography. Thus, the opening funeral medley featured the band marching into the hall, Barrett Deems playing a snare drum on the back of the wagon. Hayes then talked about the riverboat days and Louis playing with Fate Marable. Armstrong made some concessions to the show here, playing ultra-short versions of MEMPHIS BLUES and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY before settling in on a lightning-paced version of TIGER RAG. Armstrong loved performing that number in Milan and after Amba"
