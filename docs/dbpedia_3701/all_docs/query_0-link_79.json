May 1945\n\n1061-BINonchalant Man voc Lord Essex #78 rpm: ARA RM 127A 1062(unidentified title)unissued 1063-AAt The El Grotto #78 rpm: ARA RM 127B 1064Spooks Ball78 rpm: Jazz Selection 611\n\nComments:\n\nThis session is often said to have taken place in Los Angeles, in September of 1945.\n\nDown Beat, May 15, 1945 (page 2):\n\nSign Tatum And Hines On ARA\n\nLos Angeles---American Recording Artists, new platter firm formed here last year by Boris Morros and rapidly becoming an important factor in the industry, has signed two of the foremost jazz pianists, Art Tatum and Earl Hines, under exclusive contracts. Pacts were negotiated by the Wm. Morris Agency.\n\nTatum was scheduled to do his first sides latter part of May with both solo and trio waxings. Morros himself went to Chicago to supervise the first sessions by Hines and his band.\n\nARA has its own pressing plant in operation here and will set up plants in two eastern cities as soon as material is available. Distribution has been handled directly from the home plant but Morros was expected to announce line up of distribution agencies in major cities upon his return.\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nArthur Walker, John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis), William Bill Douglas (tp); Augustus Gus Chappel, Clifton Cliff Smalls, Walter Woogie Harris, Druie Bess (tb); George Scoops Carry (as, cl); Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); René Hall (el-g); Earl Hines (p, dir); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d); Joe -? (mc).\n\nRadio broadcast, Apollo Theatre, New York, NY, prob.

On MJCD 148 Hines states were gonna play just one number, and the emcee says it is once again a pleasure to bring Hines to the microphone. This sounds to me like hes referring to Hines previous New York appearances - Hiness glad to be back in New York City seems to confirm this. Everybodys EV-3003 dates Tales Of The Vienna Woods January 10, 1945, and the liner notes do appear to be reliable, so it appears to me that this recording comes from another date. Hines states we got some fine talent back there as far as the amateurs is concerned, and some of its really great. This likely is from a Wednesday Amateur Night broadcast. Hines was probably at the Apollo only one more time while Wardell was in the band. (Apollo TH, New York, week of 22 June. APO notes; Stanley Dance, The World Of Earl Hines, page 302).\n\nSchlouch lists Bennie Green, Dick Harris, Clifton Small, Pappy Smith(tb). Schlouch and Salemann both listed this recording prior to the tracks first issue (Salemann called it Blue Keys).\n\nI have transcribed the unissued closing announcements below. The first name of the announcer heard on the opening is clearly Joe, and Doc Wheeler appears to refer to him as Joe Bryan (possibly spelled Joe Brian):\n\nJoe Bryan: Thank you very much Earl Hines, for that splendid rendition of Blue Skies. And now lets get back to Amateur Night in Harlem and once again Doc Wheeler. Doc? Take it.\n\nDoc Wheeler: Thank you Joe Bryan, thank you so much. Yeah that fella that draws music from ivory and ebony, Earl Hines, is truly one of Americas greatest musicians and hes got a very, very fine band. I think theyre marvelous dont you think so? Huh? [applause] Im sure you do. My friends, the War Department is conducting a campaign to, to cure workers at the Picatinny Arsenal, and this particular place is in . . . (recording ends).\n\nWYNONIE BLUES HARRIS WITH OSCAR PETTIFORD AND HIS ALL STARS\n\nUnknown (tp); Paul Quinichette (ts); unknown (p); prob.

This is certainly not Wardell Gray on this session. Hans-Joachim Schmidt, in his Oscar Pettiford discography, says the tenor player is Jack McVea, as does David Gasten in his Wynonie Harris Discography. Jan Evensmo assures me that this is actually Paul Quinichette on this session.\n\nThe Billboard, December 7, 1946 (pages 31 & 113) listed Apollo 378 in its Advance Record Releases section, and Apollo 387 was listed in The Billboards Advance Record Releases section in May 10, 1947 (page 122). Most sources say these titles were cut in September of 1945, at which time Wardell was in Chicago with the Hines band. Note that the Delmark CD incorrectly titles S 1138-1 as Time To Change Your Tune and S 1137 as Everybody Boogie.\n\nAge 25\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nArthur Walker, John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis), William Bill Douglas (tp); Augustus Gus Chappel, Walter Woogie Harris, Druie Bess (tb); Clifton Cliff Smalls (tb, p, arr); George Scoops Carry (as, cl); Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); René Hall (el-g); Earl Hines (p, dir); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d); Dolores Parker, Essex Scott (Lord Essex) (voc).\n\nRecording session for ARA Records, unknown studio, Chicago, IL, mid-February, 1946\n\n1179-3Rosetta voc Lord Essex78 rpm: ARA 149-B 1180-2Now That Youre Mine voc Dolores Parker #78 rpm: ARA 156-B 1181Straight Life #12-inch LP: Vogue CMDINT 9733; CD: MJCD 148; Properbox 55 1181-1Straight Life (master take) #78 rpm: ARA 156-A; CD: Classics 1041 1182-3BMargie voc Arthur Walker, Lord Essex, Dolores Parker78 rpm: ARA 149-A\n\nComments:\n\nThese sides are sometimes reported as having been cut in Hollywood in May 1946.\n\nVariety (Daily Edition), Out Of The Horns Mouth, February 15, 1946 (page 8): Lou Bring, ARAs musical director, flies to Chicago Saturday to supervise Earl Hines discing 4 sides.\n\nMJCD 148 contains only the alternate take of Straight Life, Classics 1041 has the master take (I have compared to a 78 rpm pressing of ARA 156). Salemann (p. 5) says: (N)ote: some sources give Vernon \"Geechie\" Smith (tp) for Bill Douglas, Mack Lewis and Druie Bess (tb) for Benny Green and Pappy Smith. Vernon \"Geechie\" Smith was the husband of Dolores Parker.\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nArthur Walker (tp, voc); John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis), William Bill Douglas (tp); Augustus Gus Chappel, Walter Woogie Harris, Druie Bess (tb); Clifton Cliff Smalls (tb, p, arr); George Scoops Carry (as, cl); Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); René Hall (el-g); Earl Hines (p, dir); Bill Thompson (vib); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d); Dolores Parker, Essex Scott (Lord Essex) (voc); George Dvorak, Ernie Bubbles Whitman (mc).\n\nAFRS Jubilee, NBC studios, Hollywood, CA, poss.

Note the addition of Bill Thompson on vibraphone. Also appearing on Jubilee No. 194 & No. 195 are Tommy Todd with Art Shapiro, and The Les Paul Trio featuring Peggy Lee. The opening/closing themes (One OClock Jump) are likely not performed by the Hines band. All titles are on CD: The Jubilee Shows, Vol. 9: Nos. 194 & 195.\n\nRainer E. Lotz (1985; second edition, Carl A. Hallstrom, 2005):\n\nAccording to CLEF MAGAZINE (# 1, June 4, 1946) the soloists are: Vernon Smith, Gene Thomas, Kermit Scott and Bill Thompson.\n\nThe reference is actually from Clef Volume 1, Number 4, June 1946 (page 5), and it is a review of the Hines band at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. No date is given, but Stanley Dance (p. 302) has Opens Orpheum TH, Los Angeles, 23 Apr. BBD 23 Mar. and Review show at Orpheum TH, week of 23 Apr.; features Hines, Smalls, pianos; Scoops Carry, alto sax; Chick Booth, drums, Lord Essex Scott, Dolores Parker, vocals, BBD 4 May. The personnel listed above are in accordance with the Clef review. Dance (page 285) prints extracts from the publicity manual, which was probably prepared a short time after Wardells departure. The manual tells us Smith joined the band to lead the trumpets in June 1946 after his discharge from the armed forces. Arthur Walker, Palmer Fats Davis and Willie Cook are listed in the manual as well, so it is likely the trumpet section remained stable from June 1946 until at least the remainder of Wardells stay with the band.\n\nIn the trombone section we have (according to the manual) Cliff Smalls, Walter Harris, Joe McLewis and Bennie Green at the end of Wardells stay, and the Clef review names Mack Lewis, Clifton Small, Walter Harris, Druie Bess, trombones. It looks to me as if Joe McLewis replaced Gus Chappel, and Druie Bess was replaced by Bennie Green a short while later.\n\nThe California Eagle, May 9, 1946 (page 14):\n\nJubilee Again Scores Heavily\n\nThe program Jubilee from NBC, which is emceed by the personable Ernest Whitman, scored another tremendous hit last Monday when Mr. Whitman rounded up Earl Fatha Hines and orchestra, which scored heavily, Peggy Lee, blonde singer, the Les Paul Trio, Rickey Jordan, and the Town Criers for duty on the Armed Service program.\n\nHines was good with arrangements on Rosetta and Symphony, both vocalized by Lord Essex, and Why Was I Born, sung by a great new discovery Art Walker, who also plays a fine trumpet. The program lasted a full hour.\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nArthur Walker (tp, voc); Vernon Smith, John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis) (tp); Walter Woogie Harris, Bennie Green, Joe McLewis (Mack Lewis) (tb); Clifton Cliff Smalls (tb, p, arr); George Scoops Carry (as, cl); Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); René Hall (el-g); Earl Hines (p, dir, voc); Bill Thompson (vib); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d); Dolores Parker (voc).\n\nRecording session for ARA Records, Los Angeles, CA, early July 1946\n\n1220I Aint Gonna Give Nobody None Of My Jelly Roll voc Arthur Walker, Dolores ParkerAFRS Jubilee No. 268; 78 rpm: Jazz Selection 611, Sterling 3005 1221Oh My Aching Back voc Arthur Walker, Dolores Parker, Earl Hines78 rpm: Jazz Selection 614 1222Lets Get Started #78 rpm: Jazz Selection 617\n\nComments:\n\nThe ARA label did not issue this session. See also the entry for Jubilee No. 268.\n\nLets Get Started is the same tune as Gene Rameys Say Forward, Ill March, which was cut by Jay McShann and His Orchestra for Decca on December 1, 1943. The McShann release is credited to Marie Ramey-Jay McShann-Skippa Hall and remained unissued until its appearance on the 10-inch Lp DL 5503 titled Kansas City Memories. On August 6, 1947 it was recorded by Lionel Hampton as Hamps Got A Duke and issued on 78 rpm Decca 24248 A (where it was credited to Curley Hamner-Gladys Hampton-Richard Garrette). Incidentally, the opening track on AFRS Jubilee No. 71, performed by McShanns band, is usually listed as Say Forward, Ill March. But it is actually Bottle It, another version of which opens Jubilee No. 72.\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nVernon Smith, Arthur Walker, John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis) (tp); Walter Woogie Harris, Bennie Green, Joe McLewis (Mack Lewis) (tb); Clifton Cliff Smalls (tb, p, arr); George Scoops Carry (as, cl); Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); René Hall (el-g); Earl Hines (p, dir); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d).\n\nRecording session for ARA Records, Hollywood, CA, July 1946\n\n1250Throwin The SwitchAFRS Jubilee No. 268; 78 rpm: Jazz Selection 618 1251Trick-A-Track (Trickatrack) (master take)78 rpm: Jazz Selection 614 1252Bambi (Bamby) (Wambi) #78 rpm: Jazz Selection 618 1253Blue Keys #AFRS Jubilee No. 268; 78 rpm Jazz Selection 617\n\nComments:\n\nAs was the case with the previous session, these recordings were never issued by ARA. Usually it is claimed that all titles remained unissued until they appeared on the Jazz Selection label in the 1950s. Close examination of Jubilee No. 268 reveals that two of these titles (Throwin The Switch and Blue Keys) were incorporated into that transcription.\n\nThe print version of The Jazz Discography by Tom Lord (Volume 9, page H636) lists Trick a track (alt take) as on Sterling 3005 and this information has appeared in other Wardell discographies (as well as the Bruyninckx Discography). While 78rpm Sterling 3005 B does say Trick A Track (and 1251) on the label this record actually plays the master take of Spooks Ball.\n\nThe information in the run-out groove area of Sterling 3005 is as follows:\n\nI Aint Gonna Give Nobody None O This Jelly Roll: STR 3006-A (stamped, scratched out), SR-1220 (etched, scratched out), 3005 A (stamped)\n\nTrick A Track: 3004-A (stamped, scratched out), SR-1251 (etched, scratched out), 3005 B (stamped)\n\nEARL HINES AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nProbable personnel for Scoops Carrys Merry:\n\nVernon Smith, Arthur Walker, John Willie Cook, Fats Palmer (Palmer Davis) (tp); Walter Woogie Harris, Bennie Green, Joe McLewis (Mack Lewis), Clifton Cliff Smalls (tb); George Scoops Carry, Lloyd Smith (as); Kermit Scott, Wardell Gray (ts); John Williams (bar); Earl Hines (p, dir); Eugene Gene Thomas (b); David Chick Booth (d).\n\n16-inch ET: AFRS Jubilee No. 268 (assembled program, various dates)\n\nD-20697Scoops Carrys Merry #AFRS Jubilee No. 268 1250Throwin The SwitchAFRS Jubilee No. 268, 78 rpm: Jazz Selection 618 1253Blue Keys #AFRS Jubilee No. 268, 78 rpm: Jazz Selection 617 B-10674Boogie Woogie On The St. Louis Blues (incomplete)AFRS Jubilee No. 268, 78 rpm: Bluebird B-10674\n\nComments:\n\nThis AFRS program presents an assembled battle of the bands between Harry James and His Orchestra and the Hines band (along with two numbers by Page Cavanaugh Trio). Two of the Hines titles (Blue Keys and Throwin The Switch) are ARA recordings from July 1946, presented here with overdubbed applause. Scoops Carrys Merry is announced as Fathas Idea and is sometimes said to have been recorded in 1944 but this is unlikely. It is this compilers guess that this is a fourth title from the ARA recording session in Los Angeles, cut in early July 1946, but this is merely speculation. Boogie Woogie On The St. Louis Blues is the same recording as issued on Bluebird B-10674.\n\nNote that there is a performance of Limehouse Blues on Golden Era LP-15059 and its equivalent, CD: Laserlight 15766. The Bruyninckx Discography says It may be possible that the above title is not by the Earl Hines Orchestra.\n\nERNIE LEWIS ALL STARS\n\nErnest \"Ernie\" Royal (tp); Jerome Richardson (as); Eddie Taylor (ts); Earl Boatley (g); Ernie Lewis (p); Vernon Alley (b); Earl Watkins (d).\n\nRecording session for Pacific Records, Los Angeles, CA, prob. late Spring 1946\n\nMS-126Vernons Alley Blues78 rpm: Pacific 610 MS-127Hit That Jive Jack78 rpm: Pacific 610; CD: Blaze 101\n\nComments:\n\nWardell Gray is not present on these recordings.

Sonny Criss (as); Wardell Gray (ts); Joe Mesheux (p); Ernie Lewis (g); Vernon Alley (b); poss. Roy Porter (d). This session also appears in Gazdars list Wardell Gray NOT present, contrary to previous information, on the under-mentioned.\n\nAn ad appears for Pacific 610 in the June 29, 1946 of The Billboard. The matrix numbers and personnel are as they appear on my copy of this record.

Tom Lords The jazz discography Volume 8 (1994, page 6540) lists Hunter Gray (ts) [rn Wardell Gray]. Also listed in Schlouch, Salemann, Gazdar, and Masters Of Jazz (see also the comments section for the following session).\n\nSupposedly Hunter Gray is Wardell using a pseudonym, but Hunter Gray was a tenor/alto saxophonist active in California during this period. Leona Gray seems to have been another name for Hunters wife, Leomine Gray, who was the pianist/vocalist in the Hunter Gray Trio:\n\nThe Billboard Oct 26, 1946 (page 43) has Hunter Gray held over for another four weeks at Zanzibar, Sacramento.\n\nFrom Last Word Café Is Ideal for Parties, The California Eagle, Thursday, May 23, 1946 (page 15): If you date your party for the evening, Hunter Gray and his accomplished combo will give you the music that pleases your desire, both sweet, swing and boogie.\n\nThe Billboard, August 31, 1946 (page 38): Hunter Gray Trio, featuring Leomine Gray, held over for another six weeks at Last Word, L. A.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Sun, June 29, 1947 (page 4): Third Street Presents the Sensational HUNTER GRAY TRIO Featuring LEOMINE GRAY Direct from Billie Bergs\n\nFrom Gertrude Gipsons column in The California Eagle, Thursday, July 8, 1948 (page 14):\n\nTHE MOST TALENTED fingers in the kingdom of swing are those of Leomine Gray, who is featured with the Hunter Gray trio. The outfit recently concluded a terrific week at the Million Dollar theatre with the famed Ravens and Johnny Otis band. Miss Gray does everything to a piano but make it stand up and whistle \"Nature Boy.\" Her style of playing is refreshing, and shes as talented as she is lovely! Dont take our word for it, youve got eyes. SO HAVE I ! ! !\n\nLeomine Gray Brightest Star On Musical Horizon\n\nEach week the Million Dollar theatre keeps topping its previous session with a sock flesh package, but the lineup of the Ravens, Johnny Otis band and the Hunter Gray trio, which closed the other Tuesday will be a tough one to beat. And that Hunter Gray trio with Leomine Gray on piano. Wow!\n\nThe Hunter Gray trio, who recently completed a sock four weeks engagement at the New Orleans club, San Francisco, is made up of Tony Gunn, drums, Hunter, Sax and Lemoine [sic] Gray, pianist and vocals. Of all the dolls who have zoomed across the musical horizon in a blaze of glory during the lear [sic] 1948, Miss Gray is without a doubt the most refreshing.\n\nSomewhat on a Hazel Scott kick, Miss Gray plays more piano with her left hand than La Scott does with both of hers. For personality, shell make Dorothy Donegan take a back set, which is saying a lot as I consider Miss Donegan to have personality plus. This Gray gal, who authored the Sherman Williams hit, Hello, is a tall, very attractive brownskin lass who needs only to be discovered by a talent scout to get the one big break her playing raes. [sic] Her slick salesmanship and youhftul [sic] personality is a solid click wherever the Hunter Gray trio plays.\n\nGray himself (who is very lucky to be married to one so charming and talented as Leomine) is a top saxist having formerly played with some of the countrys leading dance orchestras. He formed his trio a few months ago and with Gunn beating them skins Mrs. Grays little boy Hunter can just sit back and relax and wait as theyre bound to be \"discovered.\" They play too much music not to be. As for Leomine, well . . . remember that name as youll be hearing plenty about her one of these not-too-distant days. I dont know which I would rather do, listen to her play the piano or kiss her. Musically, thats a compliment!\n\nGip\n\nGazdar did not have access to these recordings. He names the band the Vernon Alley Band featuring Leona Gray, and incorrectly names the Trilon 121 sides Boogiewoogie Daddy and I Aint Got Nothin For You. He dates this session Aug. 1946, but Trilon 121 is listed in the Advance Record Data section of the June 29, 1946 issue of The Billboard.\n\nSalemann specifies ts-solo: WG for Jam and supplies an asterisk for the two titles on Trilon 121 (indicating it is not known if W. Gray plays a solo).\n\nEvensmo: WG has been reported to be present under the pseudonym of Hunter Gray on the LEONA GRAY ACCOMPANIED BY QUEDELLYS MARTYN AND HIS ORCHESTRA session in San Francisco, ca. 1946, four titles for Trilon. However, from Dieter Salemann comes the info that there really exists a tenorsax player named Hunter Gray! The few traces of tenorsax on Trilon 120 do not indicate WG either.\n\nVERNON ALLEY AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nErnest Ernie Royal (tp); Jerome Richardson (as); Wardell Gray (ts); Bob Skinner (p); Vernon Alley (b); Dick Saltzman (d); Brad Curtis (arr).\n\nRecording session for Trilon, San Francisco, CA, prob.

In August he took part in two San Francisco sessions led by bass player Vernon Alley, known for his earlier work with Lionel Hampton and Count Basie and, later, a U.S. Navy band. The first session spotlights vocalist Leona Gray and contains no tenor solo. However, Wardell can be heard on three of the four numbers from the second session. On For You his all too brief solo ends with a crisply played, well-placed sixteenth-note phrase, which is probably the earliest influence of bop on his playing.\n\nIVORY JOE HUNTER AND HIS BIG BAND\n\nErnie Royal (tp); Wardell Gray (ts); Ivory Joe Hunter (p, voc); Chuck Walker (d); others unidentified.\n\nRecording session for Pacific Records, San Francisco, CA, poss.

Claude Van Raefelgem has pointed out that both Pacific 621 and 622 are listed in the \"Advance Record Releases\" section of The Billboard, September 28, 1946 (page 34).\n\nI do not know which other tracks, if any, were recorded at this session. The remaining titles issued on Pacific 621 and 622 are as follows:\n\nMS-105Im Sorry voc Ivory Joe Hunter78 rpm: Pacific 622; CD: Classics 5015 MS-133Heavy Hearted Blues voc Ivory Joe Hunter78 rpm: Pacific 621; CD: Classics 5015\n\nMy guess is these are not from the same session. According to the labels on the original records, Were Gonna Boogie and Why Did You Lie are by Ivory Joe Hunter and his Big Band and have consecutive matrix numbers. Heavy Hearted Blues and Im Sorry are by Ivory Joe Hunter and His Combo (again according to the Pacific labels) and the matrix numbers are out of sequence.\n\nI remain unconvinced that Why Did You Lie and Were Gonna Boogie both come from the same session. Regardless, I do not hear Wardell Gray on any side other than Were Gonna Boogie.\n\nWARDELL GRAY QUARTET\n\nWardell Gray (ts); Michael Dodo Marmarosa (p); George Red Callender (b); Harold Doc West (d).\n\nRecording session at Sunset Recording Studios, Hollywood, CA, November 23, 1946\n\n162Dells Bells (take 1) (false start)unissued 162Dells Bells (take 2) (false start)unissued 162-1Dells Bells (take 3) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 162Dells Bells (take 4) (false start)unissued 162Dells Bells (take 5) (false start)unissued 162-2Dells Bells (take 6) (incomplete take)12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 162Dells Bells (take 7) (breakdown)unissued 162-3Dells Bells (take 8) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 163One For Prez (take 1) (false start)unissued 163One For Prez (take 2) (breakdown)unissued 163One For Prez (Marmarosa warm-up)unissued 163-1One For Prez (take 3) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 163One For Prez (take 4) (false start)unissued 163-2One For Prez (take 5) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 162Dells Bells (take 9) (incomplete take) #unissued 162-4Dells Bells (take 10) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Fontana FJL-907 162-5Dells Bells (take 11) (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 797 163One For Prez (Marmarosa warm-up)unissued 163-3One For Prez (take 6) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 163One For Prez (take 7) (breakdown)unissued 163-4One For Prez (take 8) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Fontana FJL-907 163One For Prez (take 9) (breakdown)unissued 163-5One For Prez (take 7) (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 803 164The Man I Love (take 1) (false start)unissued 164-1The Man I Love (take 2) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Fontana FJL-907 164-2The Man I Love (take 3) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Black Lion BLP 60106; CD: BLCD 760106 164-3The Man I Love (take 4) (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 803 165-1Easy Swing (take 1) (complete take) #12-inch LP: Fontana FJL-907 165-2Easy Swing (take 2) (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 797\n\nSame as above, except Chuck Thompson (d) replaces West:\n\n166-1The Great Lie - Part I (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 805 166-2The Great Lie - Part II (master take) #78 rpm: J.S. 805\n\nComments:\n\nRecordings from this session remained unissued for many years. All complete takes (and one incomplete take of Dells Bells) were eventually issued by Black Lion, on LP and CD: 60106.\n\nSchlouch wrote: The Great Lie was originally issued in France but was later bootlegged on a two-part 78rpm entitled The Great Lee. CD: Classics 1264 presented the two-part version from Jazz Selection 805 (as The Great Lee).\n\nAlun Morgan, excerpted from the liner notes to 12-inch Lp: Fontana FJL-907:\n\nNot the least surprising aspect of their issue is the discovery of the original recording sheets which show that the titles were made on November 23, 1946 (a fact confirmed by the original master acetates which also carry this same date). Until the issue of this present LP it was believed that the session took place during the summer of 1950 when Gray was a member of the Count Basie Sextet. This new information is important in that (a) it proves that Wardell was already a mature soloist with a readily-identifiable style of his own at the age of 25 and (b) the tune Easy swing, which is virtually the same as Charlie Parkers Steeplechase, was recorded by Gray nearly two years before Parkers version of the tune.\n\nParkers Steeplechase was recorded for Savoy in New York on September 24, 1948.\n\nAlun Morgan, excerpted from the liner notes to the Black Lion CD:\n\nThe complete session is contained here, false starts, snippets of studio conversation, previously unissued takes. It is the most revealing document for admirers of this singular saxophonist, master of his instrument and a man who appreciated the grace and elegance of Lester Young as much as he understood and used the rhythmic options and harmonic extensions of the boppers. There is nothing to be gained by giving a blow-by-blow account of the music for its clarity and timelessness are self-evident. It may be worth providing a few sign-posts; Dells Bells is, harmonically, What Is This Thing Called Love and you can appreciate the difficulties the quartet had in daringly trying to get into the theme statement on the early run-through without the help of Doc Wests hi-hat rhythm. One For Prez uses the chords of How High The Moon and the loping Easy Swing is, in fact, a tune which Charlie Parker recorded almost exactly two years later under the title Steeplechase, claiming the composer credit himself. The three takes of Man I Love are masterpieces of re-composition for none of George Gershwins melody remains as Gray produces some of the most memorable ballad tenor you will ever hear. With the four tunes satisfactorily recorded the session was over. Or was it? It seems likely that Doc West had to leave and it is possible that Chuck Thompson, a friend of both Wardell and Hampton Hawes (who may well have been in attendance at the date as a spectator, for he was close to Wardell), took over at the drums for the spontaneous The Great Lie, based on the Fine And Dandy chord sequence.\n\nThe false starts, snippets of studio conversation referred to by Morgan were not included on the CD or LP - they remain unissued. The take/matrix numbers assigned by Black Lion do not correspond to what is heard on my copy, which appears to present nearly the complete session. The take numbers listed above correspond to what is heard on the tape. Unfortunately, there are no outtakes of The Great Lie, nor is there studio chatter to help explain Chuck Thompsons replacing West for that title only. The take numbers I have assigned above assume the first take heard to be take 1.\n\nMark Gardner, excerpted from The Complete Dial Sessions:\n\nA glance through the Dial discography shows that Dial used a decimal numbering system starting at D1000, with the third digit changing for the next nine sessions before the series rolled on to D1100 and so on. A check through the session numbers reveals that there is no allocation for the D1061 option. The omission between the two Charlie Parker dates that were allocated the D1051 (February 19th.) and D1071 (February 26, 1947) series of matrix numbers has always intrigued producer Tony Williams, who has a plausible theory.\n\nRoss Russell was friendly with Eddie Laguna, who supervised a good many jazz recording sessions in Hollywood during the 1940s, and in fact was recruited by Ross to produce the Marmarosa Trio set in December 1947. Russell greatly admired the work of tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray, and signed him to record for Dial as a leader, but recalls that he was never able to organize a Gray date. A musician always in great demand Wardells working itinery [sic] with various bands created availability complications.\n\nTony Williams believes it is just possible that Russell may have asked Laguna to produce a Wardell Gray date, and that this might have been the Dells Bells/One For Prez session supervised by Laguna on November 23, 1946. It all happened nearly 50 years ago and details can be forgotten and Ross believes had he been offered that music by Laguna he would have released it. I love Wardell and those sides are very good he says. Laguna, realising the date had turned out especially well, decided to release the music himself later. It certainly is peculiar that the music was never issued in the USA and initially only appeared on the European labels Jazz Selection and Vogue. The session was eventually acquired in its entirety from Laguna by Alan Bates in the 1960s. Further evidence that the session may have been made for Dial in mind is that the rhythm section of Marmarosa, Callender and West, is that used by Dial for the Parker All Stars session held on February 26. 1947. If indeed the Gray session was actually recorded on February 23, rather than November 23, it would have slotted perfectly into the missing D1061 slot!\n\nThe clincher, as far as Tony Williams is concerned, is the matrix number pattern allotted to the Gray material. These run 162, 163, 164 etc. All that is missing is the zero after the 1. It is a pretty convincing thesis, when all the evidence is examined, especially since there is no other explanation for the missing Dial mystery session.\n\nI disagree with Gardners hypothesis (as Bob Porter has told me its too early for Dial and Wardell). There is some evidence this session may have been originally recorded for Keynote Records:\n\nThe Billboard, July 20, 1946 (page 21):\n\nKeynotes New Exec Set-Up; Ebbins May Head HWood Office\n\nHOLLYWOOD, July 13. Keynote Records, indie diskery which started in the East long before current record entry fad set in, is concentrating on West Coast output following a recent $300,000 issue of stock and a new board of directors set-up which includes Norman Corwin, Paul Robeson, Wee J.

Up to now Bernay contracted for his pressings on the outside, but a brand-new company-owned plant in Compton, Calif., augurs a bigger and brighter future for the Keynoters.

Inc., until recently specializing in the select hot jazz disk field, will make a strong bid for the classical record markets in announcing the acquisition of a complete catalog of symphonic recording under Czech government control. The arrangement, made with the government of Czechoslovakia, was confirmed in a cable from Prague to John Hammond, president of the Keynote Corporation, and makes available a complete collection of outstanding European recordings and music, previously impossible to obtain. . . . Keynote, as part of its side of the deal, will furnish the European diskery with some of its masters. Deal was negotiated for Hammond by Hughes Panassie, eminent French music critic and diskery exec for Pathe Marconi waxworks. Meanwhile, Keynote started shipping its first disks under the new Hammond reign. Firm sent out its waxing of Dumbarton Oaks Concerto and five hot jazz packages including disks by Lennie Tristano, George Barnes, Dave Lambert and Buddy Stewart, Willie Smith and an all-star tenor saxmens album.\n\nThe Billboard, February 28, 1948 (page 22):\n\nAbsorption of Keynote Nears\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 21.  Mercury Records probably will complete absorption of the Keynote diskery within the next few weeks, it has been learned. Official approval of terms of a stock-exchange agreement between Mercury and Keynote stockholders must wait on a formal meeting of Keynote holders to be held within 10 days. It is virtually certain, however, that they will be okayed since the majority of stockholders, led by Keynote Prexy John Hammond, who is also a veepee in Mercury, reportedly set up the initial plan.\n\nIf formal approval is rendered Mercury will take over the entire Keynote pop, jazz and folk catalog. Already handling Keynotes classical line (as well as the Keynote-acquired Czech longhair catalog), Mercury will be adding to its pot of masters items cut by Dinah Washington, Lennie Tristano, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Chubby Jackson, Bill Harris, Roy Eldridge and others.

Bernay and Laguna now are reactivating the Sunset catalog and will supplement that with new jazz wax. The latter consists mostly of the Gene Norman-Laguna bashes which were tabbed Just Jazz, a Coast counterpart to Jazz at the Philharmonic. The initial Just Jazz release, a 12-inch disk, will be available shortly. Distribution has been set for New York, Boston and Chicago so far.\n\nBernay will also put out some disks on his own label, Theme Records.

The correct date and venue were established by Joe Showler: the event was a benefit concert for the March Of Dimes held at the Joseph Le Conte Junior High School playground. Several titles from this event were used for AFRS Jubilee 228, 229, and 291. These recordings were combined with additional material, also featuring Woody Herman (possibly this material was recorded January 10, 1947). Gazdar and Masters of Jazz have Gray soloing on The Medium Blues only; Salemann wrote 2nd ts-solo:WG for Cotton Tail. The brief solo on Cotton Tail, which can be heard on Jubilee 228 and Jazum 56, does not sound like Wardell to me.\n\nThe California Eagle, Thursday, January 30, 1947 (page 18):\n\nDANCING ON A DIME SET TONITE\n\nJuke Box Faves in Big Show\n\nPromising to be the greatest outdoor show and dance ever presented in the Southland, KFWBs Dancing On a Dime Is Set for Thursday from 6:30 p.m. to Midnight at Le Conte Junior High playground, Van Ness and Fernwood, for the March of Dimes.

But the real star of the evening was the relatively obscure Wardell Gray, who had been working in Billy Eckstines backup band at Billy Bergs nightclub in Los Angeles and was just beginning to gain a reputation among the more aware jazz fans.\n\nThe twenty-six-year old tenor man was an unusually accomplished and versatile musician. Influenced by both Bennys old favorite Lester Young and Charlie Parker, with whom he had recorded a few months earlier, he combined Lesters characteristic sound and phrasing with Parkers advanced conception, bridging the gap between the old jazz and the new with long-lined, loose-limbed solos notable for their warmth, lucidity and unfaltering sense of swing. Over the course of the evening he proved equally adept playing high-powered pressure cooker bebop with Howard McGhee and more relaxed swing-oriented jazz with Erroll Garner. The recording of Blue Lou made with Garner at the concert contains what is widely regarded as one of his finest solos and was awarded the French Grand Prix du Disque the following year. Benny was also impressed with Wardells playing. If hes bop, thats great, he enthused. Hes wonderful. When Benny took part in another Just Jazz concert that December, he invited Wardell to join him onstage for several numbers, laying the groundwork for an experiment that was to free him from his heavy dependence on the past.\n\nFrom Flights of the Vout Bug: A Guide to the Recorded Music of Michael \"DoDo\" Marmarosa by Dieter Salemann and Fabian Grob:\n\nGene Norman remembers the bassist with the Howard McGhee All Stars . . . to have been Red Callender, who indeed is listed for some (or all) of their titles in the standard discographies and on many of the LP- or CD-reissues. Nevertheless Norman himself, when concluding AFRS Jubilee Program No. 261 with his sign off, mentions Charlie Drayton as bassist on BE-BOP. On the same occasion he wrongly announces this title as GROOVIN HIGH. As Gene Norman seems to be no reliable source, it remains uncertain who actually played bass on these titles. Elaine Cohen in her discography to Red Callenders autobiography Unfinished Dream does not include these titles.\n\nDEXTER GORDON QUINTET\n\nMelba Liston (tb); Dexter Gordon (ts); Charles Fox (p); George Red Callender (b); Chuck Thompson (d).\n\nRecording session for Dial, C.

The label attributes them to Frank Motley. Wardell Gray does not appear anywhere on this album  although he is listed in the title and a photograph of him appears on the front cover.\n\nMark Gardner, liner notes to Dial Collectors Jazz Vol. 7:\n\n\"The Chase was the main purpose of Dexters second session  the idea being to duplicate the jam session jousts between the two saxophonists. To allow them more time and space almost seven minutes were allocated and the performance was issued on both sides of a 78 rpm record. This disc outsold everything in the Dial catalogue  even the Charlie Parker sides. The tenors were backed up by a trio from the Bird-in-the-Basket, Jimmy Bunn, Red Callender and Chuck Thompson. The first two takes have been lost, and as is the case with the third they were probably false starts, but the D take is complete and gives some idea of the excitement and power this pair was able to generate.\"\n\nThe entire session is on CD: Stash STB-2513 and MJCD 156\n\nLOUIS OLES (or LEWIS OLES)\n\nLewis Oles (tp); Teddy Edwards (ts, arr); Wardell Gray (ts); 3 unknown (reeds); unknown (p); unknown (b); unknown (d).\n\nRecording session for Dick Bock, Los Angeles, CA, c. 1947 (?)\n\nBefore Dawn #78rpm 16-inch disc (unissued?)\n\nComments\n\nI have not heard this recording, which may be lost. Malcolm Walker, in his Wardell Gray Discography (page 40), wrote Cadence, April 1994, page 13 includes the news that Wardell Gray and Teddy Edwards were in the Lewis Oles Big Band which was Dick Bocks first recording session. No other details. This session is listed in Bob Weirs Teddy Edwards discography (page 21) with the date c. early 1958. Weirs source is also the April 1994 issue of Cadence (Teddy Edwards Interview Taken & Transcribed by Bob Rusch).\n\nPossibly the trumpeter named by Edwards is the same Louis Oles who played for Buddy Richs band (see Mister, I Am the Band! Buddy Rich - His Life and Travels by Doug Meriwether and Clarence C. Hintze).\n\nFred Jung: When jazz historians refer to West Coast jazz, they are making mention of white musicians like Chet Baker, Russ Freeman, Dave Brubeck, Shelly Manne, Art Pepper, and Gerry Mulligan.\n\nTeddy Edwards: Well, let me explain something to you, Fred, on why that came about. You see, Dick Bock at Pacific Jazz, Wardell Gray and I made his first record for him for free. He brought a trumpet player up to Salinas, California. He was a hippie type guy, who could play little on the trumpet, but somehow, Dick Bock wanted to record him. I did a five saxophone arrangement for one of my songs called, Before Dawn, that he recorded and that was his first venture into recording. Later on, when he decided to start Pacific Jazz label, I was working at the Lighthouse.\n\nCadence, Vol. 20, No. 4, April 1994 (page 13):\n\nCAD: Perception is that the West Coast Jazz scene more than most has been polarized racially.\n\nT.E.: When the West Coast Jazz thing cranked up Dick Bock [Pacific Jazz Records] came down and checked everybody out and he hired all the other guys and not me. I couldnt quite understand it cause I was the star, the one drawing the people. And I had been on the very first record he had ever made and did it for him for free, with Wardell Gray. He brought a trumpet player named Lewis Oles from Salina, California, who was nothing as a trumpet player hardly. I wrote an arrangement on one of my compositions, Before Dawn for five saxophones and one trumpet. Lewis Oles was the leader and he was the worst musician in the band.\n\n&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp See, the recording companies out of the East recorded mostly Black musicians, with exceptions of guys like Zoot Sims, Stan Getz and a few others. The music was hard and swinging out of the East and was light and delicate out of the West Coast thing. The Jazz out of the East was heavy and Black and out of the West light and White, thats the way it sounded. We had plenty of hard hitters there but we didnt get recorded. Sonny Criss, Hampton Hawes, Wardell, all of us, but we were ignored for mostly a racial thing. It was very racially motivated.\n\nHan Schulte interviewed Teddy Edwards on October 3rd, 1980. Teddy again talks about this record - I have transcribed the relevant exchange:\n\nHan Schulte: I was checking about the record you made in 1947...\n\nTeddy Edwards: Uh-huh.\n\nHS: And uh - you spelled the name to Peter last night, on the telephone, Louie Oles..., you know..\n\nTE: Oh, right!\n\nHS: And he was the leader,\n\nTE: Uh, Louis... Louis... Louis Oles. Right! And it was War- it was Pacific Jazzs first record, produced by - it was Dick Bocks who own - Dick Bock who owned Pacific Jazz records - that was his first record production. And we made up in a little studio up in Wes-- in the same one I had made the earlier things I made with Benny Bailey, at the same location.\n\nHS: He was the producer?\n\nTE: Dick Bock was the producer.\n\nHS: But Louie Oles was playing trumpet.\n\nTE: He was the trumpet player. He - Dick Bock brought us from some little town up north, in about the middle of California to make this record, and we made the record with him. And, ahhh - Im gonna see if his ex-wife has still got that copied rec - cause he had that record and I might be able to get you, get a tape on it.\n\nHS: Yeah?\n\nTE: Because she did have the record, his -- Dorothy, his second wife, she had that record.\n\nHS: Well, because - I checked all the, all the Pacific lists, you know\n\nTE: Its not on there.\n\nHS: But, -- no?\n\nTE: I dont think its on there.\n\nHS: Never issued?\n\nTE: It was issued, but not after they started making album, it was on a, it was on a, it was on a big disc but it wasnt like a thirty-three and a third disc... This was around 1947.\n\nHS: They made some albums, you know, they call it Jazz West Coast Volume One, Volume Two...\n\nTE: No, not on that. Not on that, not on that.\n\nHS: No? Never made out, never, uh - issued?\n\nTE: It was never on an album. It was issued! But never on an album.\n\nHS: So, its 78, uh...\n\nTE: Right. It was on a big disc, but it was 78. First made on a big disc.\n\nHS: How many - how many minutes, you know, on the--\n\nTE: Oh, I imagine, um ... that every song was runnin about three minutes durin that time, but the- I tell you I wrote this song, it was called \"Before Dawn\".\n\nHS: Yeah, you told me - Before Dawn.\n\nTE: Ah, yeah. For five saxophones and a trumpet. And we both play solos on the record.\n\nHS: Five saxophones, one trumpet?\n\nTE: Mm-hmm, and three rhythm.\n\nHS: And three rhythm?\n\nTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Huijts: Very short solos on those records...\n\nTE: Yeah, yeah... but we both play solos on this record. Im gonna see if I can, Ill call her - finally get in touch with her and see if shes got that record in her collection.\n\nHS: It was for Pacific.\n\nTE: Mm-hmm. That was his first recording.\n\nHS: For Louie.\n\nTE: For - no, for Dick Bock, the producer. The owner of World Pacific Records. Pacific Jazz.\n\nHS: Was made in Los Angeles?\n\nTE: Mm-hmm. Made in the same studio where I made, um, Bird Legs, and Steady With Teddy and all those things with Benny Bailey - Benny Baileys first record date. It was in that same studio.

Quite a bit of material was issued for the first time in this album, but note that the mastering on this set is extremely hot and there is significant clipping throughout. From the liner notes:\n\nWith the release of this compact disc set, we now have the good fortune to hear the complete recording of the concert-dance as it happened at the Elks Auditorium on that historic July evening. ~ Maxine Gordon\n\nAll announcements during the concert by producer Emcee Ralph Bass.

Lawrence Larance Marable: The drummers who really took some time with me, besides Roy (Porter), were Chuck Thompson and Ken Tim Kennedy. Thompson was from LA, while Kennedy was a drummer from Detroit whod moved here. (There and Back, Roy Porter and David Keller, p. 154.) All titles are on the 3 CD set: Savoy SVY-17441 - the personnel listed above is taken from that release.\n\nThe two brief performances of Rifftide (theme) first issued on Savoy SVY17441 appear as Unknown Theme take 1 and Unknown Theme take 2 in that releases liner notes. The tune was also recorded by a McGhee group in February 1948 as Merry Lee, issued on 12-inch Lp Savoy MG-12026 entitled Howard McGhee and Milt Jackson.\n\nFrom Dave Bailey comes the information that, although uncredited, the final soloist is Teddy Edwards. Edwards is heard after Grays solo on Jeronimo - Edwards confirmed this in a letter to Bailey, stating he arrived late to the concert.\n\nDuring Han Schultes interview with Teddy Edwards (October 3rd, 1980), Teddy mentions his appearance on Cherokee (Jeronimo) and talks about the situation while listening to the recording. I have transcribed portions of Teddys comments:\n\nIn fact on that record, the one that  the one that, Jeronimo  I had been over to a friends of mines house, and we had been practicin and I came in just time to play the solo The last chorus was me, although my name is not on the record, but I played the last  right! I played the last chorus on that solo [. . .] I noticed when they reissued it they didnt have my name on it, cause they probably didnt know. Cause I just got in on the tail end of the set, I showed up at the very end of the thing, you know [. . .] I was rushin to get to the bandstand . . . But I wasnt supposed to be on the gig, I had been over to a friend of mines house practicin, another saxophone player we been over there practicin in the book, you know. Prez Harris.

Lotz & Neuert have c. August 1947 ,?Hollywood and DATE OF BROADCAST : 10 October 1947 for Jubilee No. 242. If the October 10 date is correct the recording date of October 17 is obviously incorrect. Salemann has ca. May, 1947, Pasadena, Cal., McCormack General Hospital.\n\nThese recordings seem to have been conflated with those listed in the following session, causing much confusion. The description given in Mark Gardners Xanadu 200 Lp liners indicate these are the Portland recordings.\n\nFrom Jumptown: The Golden Years of Portland Jazz, 1942-1957 by Robert Dietsche (page 91):\n\nAmong the first recordings Criss made were some acetates with the Al Killian sextet done at the Savoy in Portland on October 17, 1947. They first came out on an LP titled Sonny Criss Immortal [sic] on Xanadu, an independent record company owned by the indispensable Don Schlitten. It was Schlitten himself who rescued these precious tapes from Sonny Crisss own clothes closet, where they were buried under empty gin bottles. They are the only commercial recordings of anything ever done on Williams Avenue. Unfortunately, they have been spliced, abridged, and completely doctored. Still and all, you can get a pretty good idea of the effect that the Al Killian sextet had on the crowd that rainy night at the Savoy, as well as the blazing artistry of Criss.\n\nThe closing One OClock Jump is duplicated on AFRS Jubilee 242 and 243. Jubilee 242 has Kay Kyser/Gene Norman voiceovers, and 243s presentation ends before Wardells solo. All titles except One OClock Jump are on 12-inch LPs: Jazz Showcase 5005 and Xanadu 200, and CD: MJCD 191. Jazz Showcase 5005 presents Blue Lou twice  it is the same performance. Schlouch lists seven titles instead of five: he also lists Blue Lou twice, and lists Semi-Quiet and Sonnys Bop as two separate recordings.\n\nMark Gardner, liner notes to 12-inch LP: Xanadu 200:\n\nBy 1947, singing star, valve-trombonist and defender of bop Billy Eckstine had reluctantly disbanded his superb large orchestra. Recently, he remembered what happened after the band broke up: I went out to California, and I organized a small band just to do some dates out there. I had Al Killian on trumpet, Wardell Gray and Sonny Criss, Chuck Thompson on drums, Shep Shepard on bass, and Hampton Hawes on piano. Just six, seven pieces. We used that up and down the Coast. It was organized not to stay together. It was just to fill out some dates I had out there.\n\nThe leader of this unit was trumpeter Killian, a high note man who had made novelty discs and mainstream records under his own name. According to Criss: Killian was interested in the modern sounds even though he was not capable of playing in that vein. He thought he would get the best people who werent currently tied up. I wasnt doing anything and Wardell was out of a job too so he called us both to join him and back Eckstine at Billy Bergs. After that we went on the road with Killian. We played in Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. We spent about six months in Portland and made some acetates while we were there.\n\nThe Portland performances, like most of the music on this album, came from the personal collection of Sonny Criss and are issued here for the first time. Evidently, by the time the sextet assembled in Portland, some personnel changes had taken place. Hawes had been replaced by St. Louis pianist Charles Fox, Shepard had yielded to Shifty Henry, and Tim Kennedy replaced Chuck Thompson.\n\nClaude Carrière (adapted from the French by Tony Baldwin), liner notes to MJCD 191:\n\nUnder Killians leadership, the same three horn men got together three months later for five rather mysterious sides. We know that they were made in Portland, Oregon, the first major city north if the Californian border. The tunes all fill the usual 78 length of around three minutes, though one of them, Blue N Boogie, ends suddenly in mid-solo. At the start of some of the sides there is applause but not at the end. Some sources credit Shifty Henry as the bassplayer [sic] but to our ears this is Ernie Shepard (cf. the solo on Blue N Boogie) who was to shine so brightly wih [sic] Duke Ellington fifteen years later. As for the pianist, this might be Charles Fox, who re-emerged with Clark Terry in the 1970's [sic].\n\nAL KILLIAN SEXTET\n\nAl Killian (tp); Sonny Criss (as); Wardell Gray (ts); Charles Fox (p); Ernie Shep Shepard (b); Ken Tim Kennedy (d).\n\nPrivate recordings, poss.

Unfortunately, these titles were not included in the Masters Of Jazz series (Gazdar: Material unissued commercially possibly because of poor sound quality). The date and location listed above appears in Salemann and Schlouch. Schlouch does not mention Blue N Boogie. These are lengthy performances with excellent solos by all  sadly the source discs were in terrible condition many years ago. The tune marked unknown title has a written theme and runs over 8 minutes.\n\nFrom Jumptown: The Golden Years of Portland Jazz, 1942-1957 by Robert Dietsche (page 84):\n\nThe single most important event at the Savoy in 1947 was the coming of Sonny Criss and Wardell Gray. They were in Portland for five months, according to Criss, but within weeks of their arrival it seemed that every saxophonist in the Northwest was coming under their domination. Legends in the making in your own backyard, on their way to the Hall of Fame. They came to the city in place of Billy Eckstine who had booked a tour of West Coast jazz cities but at the last minute was called away. So Eckstine put together a sextet featuring Criss and Gray and then picked Al Killian, the high- note trumpet champion, as leader. Killian was the leader, but Gray was the star.\n\nFletcher Smith is sometimes listed as the pianist (probably referring to the titles used by AFRS). Fortunately, Tim Kennedy established the correct personnel in an interview published in Jumptown (pages 86-87):\n\nGrays old shoe brush is the only memento drummer Tim Kennedy has of those days with the Al Killian sextet in Portland. Kennedy, in a phone interview from Harlem, talked about his days in Portland.\n\nI ended up with the shoe brush because Wardell and Sonny and me and the bass player Shep Shepherd all lived together in a private home. Kittys, I think it was. It was close to where we were playing. Killian had his girlfriend in Portland and Charley Fox, our piano player, had some other place to stay. We were filling up dates for Billy Eckstine, and Portland was our last stop. We stayed there quite a while because everyone loved the band so much.\n\nWe knew about the segregation in Portland, but to us Williams Avenue was Portland. One day for something different we went to the Coon Chicken Inn (now the Prime Rib) and laughed out loud at the sign outside and at the front door which was in the form of Little Black Sambos wide-open mouth. But you know what? They had the best chicken in town. Really. All we did all day and mostly all night was play jazz, mostly at the Savoy, right down from where we were staying. We were heavy, man. Nobody ever asked to sit in, thats for sure. Cause they would have felt the heat. Killian was older than the rest of us. My uncle played with him in the Basie Band. Sonny Criss wasnt even twenty but fast as hell. Charley Fox could play in any style, bop or anything, and Shep Shepherd was the rock on bass, but Wardell was way ahead of all of us. Of course, that was many years ago, but was probably the best time in my life. We had the best of everything: best music, best food, best women; all the people on the Avenue coming to see us. Yeah, it was definitely the best time of my life. When it died, Portland died for us.\n\nGENE NORMANS JUST JAZZ CONCERT\n\nShrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, CA, December 27, 1947\n\nJUST JAZZ ALL STARS\n\nErnie Royal (tp); Wardell Gray, Vido Musso (ts); Arnold Ross (p); Barney Kessel (el-g); Harry Babasin (b); Don Lamond (d).\n\nD-20841Sweet Georgia Brown (California Conquest) #AFRS Jubilee 271, AFRS JJ No. 16; 12-inch LP: Queen-Disc 39 D-20841C Jam Blues #AFRS Jubilee 271; 12-inch LP: Queen-Disc 39 D-20841Just You, Just Me (Just Bop) #AFRS Jubilee 271, 12-inch LP: Queen-Disc 39\n\nJAM SESSION\n\nErnie Royal (tp); Benny Goodman (cl); Wardell Gray, Vido Musso (ts); Red Norvo (vib); Mel Powell (p); George Red Callender (b); Lee Young (d).\n\nD-30904I Never Knew (to fade) #AFRS JJ No. 16, 12-inch LP: Spotlite SPJ-145\n\nComments:\n\nAll titles are on CD: MJCD 198.

I Never Loved Anyone is titled Anytime on MJCD 198 and I Never Loved Anyone in Evensmo. 78 rpm: Excelsior EX-28X by Frances Wayne was mentioned in The Billboard, January 31, 1948 (p. 31) and was first reissued in 2002 on CD: MJCD 195 where it is listed as having been recorded on July 3, 1947.\n\nThe timing indications on the LP jacket of Spotlite SPJ134 say: C Jam Blues (6:10) and How High the Moon (3:46). These timings are incorrect - the jacket and the disc label have reversed the titles for these tracks. The venue is also said to have been McCormick General Hospital, Pasadena, CA. All titles listed above are on DRCD-409. Wardell does not solo on the Frances Wayne features but his obbligato is prominent throughout.\n\nFrom Flights of the Vout Bug: A Guide to the Recorded Music of Michael \"DoDo\" Marmarosa by Dieter Salemann and Fabian Grob:\n\nThe above performance was not a Just Jazz concert as claimed by some sources due to the presence of Gene Norman as master of ceremonies.\n\nLotz and Neuert (AFRS Jubilee discography) suggest March 1948 as possible recording date. The program was broadcast for the first time on June 18, 1948.\n\nAll musicians of the above personnel are named by Norman on the show, except for the bass player. Other participators on Jubilee program No. 278 were the Bill Doggett Trio and Pete Dailey and his Chicagoans.\n\nThe announcement by Woody Herman to C-JAM BLUES on Swing House SWH-10 release does not derive from the above Jubilee Show, but from AFRS Jubilee program No. 229 and has obviously been dubbed in by the editor.\n\nThe announcement of Gene Norman to WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE on Dragon DRLP issue points at the placing of this title before HOW HIGH THE MOON in the original Jubilee concert show. The title was dropped by the sound engineers for the release of AFRS Jubilee program No. 278.\n\nAge 27\n\nBENNY CARTER AND HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nBig band including Benny Carter (as, arr, dir); poss.

During Stompin At The Savoy John Deagun announces Teddy Wilson as Teddy Williams. Cookin One Up is often mistitled Cookin On Up. Benny can be heard on an unissued announcement ...first wed like to play a tune, this is an original written by Mel Powell, called Cookin One Up.\n\nLimehouse Blues is incomplete on MJCD 198. Masters Of Jazzs source was a tape supplied by Coover Gazdar. The original source is an acetate recorded by Virgil Thomas. The bars missing from Thomass recording do exist; they are on an unissued tape recorded by Harry Foster. Fosters tape also contains the ending of Cookin One Up and various announcements not recorded by Thomas.\n\nRoss Firestone, Swing, Swing, Swing: The Life & Times of Benny Goodman (pages 344-345):\n\nOn May 24 the septet began a two-week engagement at the Click nightclub in Philadelphia. Bootleg recordings of broadcasts from the club reveal that this was easily the most interesting band Benny had led in years. The unusual front line of tenor saxophone and two clarinets gave the group a distinctive, wonderfully reedy sound. The arrangements featured long-lined, tightly voiced ensemble passages startlingly like the sort of thing the very advanced pianist Lennie Tristano was now doing with the saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne March [sic].\n\nAlthough much of the material from the Click engagement remains unissued, most of the recordings featuring solos by Wardell have been made available. CD: DRCD-183 presents the bulk of them. A June 1, 1948 performance of Marys Idea was issued only on 12-inch LP: Swedisc SWD 25-9016, and three tracks from May 24 appear exclusively on CD: MJCD 198. Three titles from Click with solos by Gray have never been issued; these are On The Sunny Side Of The Street (May 28), Marys Idea (May 29 - evening), and You Go To My Head (June 5, evening).\n\nWardell appeared as a member of the Goodman sextet for two Gene Norman concerts (March 26 and 27) before heading to New York. A Carnegie Pop Concert was scheduled for Monday, May 10, 1948 at 8:30 PM but this was canceled. Information from Carnegie Hall shows Fred Robbins was to host this concert which was billed as the first appearance in New York in two years of Benny Goodman and His Sextette. Goodman, Hasselgard, Gray, and Wilson were listed as performers in addition to Joe Bushkin, p; Jonah Jones, tp; and Morey Feld, d.\n\nThe Billboard, April 17, 1948 (page 30):\n\nFirst sideman drafted for Benny Goodmans return to activity at the Click nitery, Philadelphia, May 24, is ace pianist Teddy Wilson, who worked with Goodman in B.G.s early big band and chamber combo days.\n\nFrom Billy... Rowes Note Book, The Pittsburgh Courier, Saturday, May 8, 1948:\n\nBenny Goodman will have Teddy Wilson and a new tenor saxman with him when he presents his sextet at Carnegie Hall Monday. Wardell Gray by name, the latest beige discovery of the Goodman, is supposed to be the greatest since Coleman Hawkins came on the scene. Hes under contract to Benny and gets that loot, work or play . . .\n\nNew York Times, May 8, 1948 (page 12):\n\nThe appearance of Benny Goodmans sextet, scheduled for the Carnegie Pops Series on Monday, has been indefinitely postponed due to transportation difficulties, it was announced yesterday.\n\nThe Billboard, May 15, 1948 (page 4):\n\nBGs Carnegie Date Canceled\n\nNEW YORK, May 8.  Benny Goodmans Carnegie pops concert, skedded for Monday (10) has been canceled and will be staged at Carnegie at some later date. The reasons for the cancellation, just four days prior to the concert, are Bennys inability to assemble a satisfactory sextet for the session plus poor advance tic sales.\n\nThe Carnegie date was to have been Bennys first Eastern appearance since the announcement of his plans to return to the band biz. The clarinet tootlers next skedded date is a two-week run at the Click in Philly, prior to launching week-end dance dates at the White Plains County Center (which the orkster has leased for the summer) with a full crew.\n\nOn May 22, two days prior to the Click opening, Goodman appeared as a guest on a White Plains Parade Of Progress program broadcast over WFAS. No recordings are known to exist. Probably this was an interview/chat show with Benny plugging the Click engagement.\n\nOn May 25 Goodman appeared at a Swing Jamboree at the Helen Fleisher Vocational School in Philadelphia. He was presented with a birthday cake and an Annual Fellowship Citation for outstanding democratic practices. I have not seen reports of Wardell appearing with Goodman but according to The Philadelphia Inquirer (May 29) both Benny and Teddy Wilson performed. The Inquirer reported some of Bennys remarks: It is difficult to be born without the right kind of skin, however acts in our lives can do do things to make people forget the color of our skins . . . I have Negroes in my band because it is practical. If he plays the way I like it, his color is no handicap. Music is relatively free from prejudice, although all of us have some sort of prejudice, were no Saints, and there are a lot of good people on your side in America.\n\nD. Russ Connors tremendous works on Benny Goodman form the basis for this discographys coverage of Wardells time with Goodman. Rather than paraphrase Mr. Connor, Ive chosen to transcribe a number of his comments from Listen To His Legacy and Wrappin It Up and incorporate them into this discography.\n\nConnor (Legacy), page 191:\n\nBenny broadcast frequently from the Click and home recordists were kept busy. One Philadelphian had a tape recorder, a new device not in general use among amateurs until some five years later. His paper-backed tapes held up fairly well---to the authors knowledge, they are the first tapes of Goodman broadcasts ever made by a non-professional---but provided indifferent sound quality. Another had professional-type recording gear, and his acetates afford excellent audio fidelity. Unfortunately, mis-dating on the tapes led to erroneous assignment of this material in the authors earlier work on Goodman. The broadcasts are now correct as listed below. \"Note, too, that excerpts from the Click broadcasts are on Dragon (Sweden) and Swedisc (Japan) LP's---theres a switch. An attempt is made to match the LP tracks with appropriate performances, but there is no guarantee that these assignments are correct. Swedisc is dubbed from Dragon, which in turn was dubbed from tapes, possibly generations removed, supplied by the author to a collector before the broadcasts were realigned. Realignment changed the dates of some performances, and this information was not available to the bootleggers. Thus data herein may differ from LP liner notes. Here, then, an extensive array of Benny Goodman and Ake Stan Hasselgard, thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts Harry Foster (tape) and Virgil Thomas (disc). They knew what to record, even if they forgot when they recorded it(.)\n\nBENNY GOODMAN SEPTET\n\nBenny Goodman (cl, dir); Åke Stan Hasselgård (cl); Wardell Gray (ts); Teddy Wilson (p); Billy Bauer (el-g); Arnold Fishkind (b); Mel Zelnick (d); Patti Page (voc); Harry Fleetwood (ann).\n\nWCAU Radio broadcast, CBS Radio Network, Click Restaurant, Philadelphia, PA, May 27, 1948\n\nStompin At The Savoy (incomplete - ending only)unissued Swedish Pastry #12-inch LP: DRLP-16; SWD 25-9008; CD: Phont NCD 8802; MJCD 198 All The Things You Are12-inch LP: DRLP-16; SWD 25-9008; CD: Phont NCD 8802 You Turned The Tables On Me voc Patti Pageunissued Where Or When -TRIOunissued The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise QUARTETunissued The Man I Love voc Patti Pageunissued Marys Idea (Just An Idea) #12-inch LP: DRLP-16, SWD 25-9008; CD: MJCD 198 Dont Blame Me voc Patti Pageunissued Good-Bye (theme)unissued\n\nComments:\n\nAll The Things You Are is a clarinet feature for Goodman and Hasselgård.
