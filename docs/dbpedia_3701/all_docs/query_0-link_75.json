        "text": "Cheers of appreciation greeted the massive compact-disk issue recently of Bruno Walter performances on imported disks from CBS/Sony in Japan. To many, this was a sign that the new technology of laser-played disks would not result in ignoring the treasures of the old catalogue. Many of the Walter performances remain definitive, and it was reassuring to have them in remarkably fine sound on compact disks.\n\nAs if to reinforce the sense of historic commitment among many record companies as the CD boom progresses, RCA is about to release its big conducting gun from the past - 10 CD's devoted to performances of Arturo Toscanini with the NBC Symphony. All the performances, retained in their original mono sound, have been digitally remastered by RVC in Japan. All have been in the catalogue on disk and cassette continuously, so the CD release does not represent a reissue in a formal sense, but it does assure the continued presence in the catalogue of a giant among conductors.\n\nThe releases, of course, include some of the Beethoven symphony performances, which have long been considered among Toscanini's premier contributions to recorded music. There is the Third, coupled with the ''Egmont'' Overture; the Fifth, with Schubert's Eighth on the same disk; the Sixth, with the ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3, and the Ninth. The other disks contain Brahms's First Symphony; Mendelssohn's Fourth and Fifth; Dvorak's Ninth (with Smetana's ''Moldau'' as well); an anthology including such pieces as ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice''; Mozart's 40th and 41st; and a Respighi disk with ''The Fountains of Rome,'' ''The Pines of Rome'' and the ''Roman Festival.''\n\nA Sondheim Boom\n\nStephen Sondheim on recordings is beginning to be quite a little industry of its own. The latest entry in the field is Book-of-the-Month Records, which will release on May 15 a newly recorded three-record (two-cassette) collection of Sondheim songs. Mr. Sondheim himself had a hand in selecting the repertory, which includes the world premiere of a 27-minute ''Pacific Overtures'' Suite.\n\nIn his notes for the album, Mr. Sondheim points to the fact that this anthology ''has been created from scratch, and so have many of the orchestral treatments.'' In addition to selections from such shows as ''Sweeney Todd,'' ''A Little Night Music'' and ''Company,'' among others, the set includes music from the two films for which Sondheim wrote the scores - ''Stavisky'' and the movie version of ''A Little Night Music.'' The singers include Bob Gunton and Debbie Shapiro.\n\nThe set is available by mail order, of course (Book-of-the-Month Records, Camp Hill, Pa. 17012; $24.95 plus $1.75 shipping and handling plus sales tax for New York and Pennsylvania residents); but like other original productions of Book-of-the-Month Records, it will also be sold through retail stores.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
