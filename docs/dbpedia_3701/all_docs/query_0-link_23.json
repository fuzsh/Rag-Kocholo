The very first Pink Floyd compact disc to be distributed in the United States was Dark Side of the Moon, released in March of 1983, followed by Meddle, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall. These early issue CDs were pressed with a black Harvest label, and the cover and discs were made in Japan.Bar Codes: Bar codes are a group of vertical lines found on the back cover of some CDs that are used for scanning purposes. By passing a CD with a bar code over a scanner, the scanner can read information about the CD instantly. The information in bar codes begins with the vendor code (first 4 digits), the catalog number, a format code (\"1\" for LPs, \"2\" for CDs, \"4\" for cassette tapes), and sometimes there is a final digit that is the barcode checksum. In recent years, there has been a trend towards using the entire bar code number as the catalog number of the CD. DIDP & DIDX Identification Codes: DIDP, which stands for Digital IDentification Project, is an identification code created by by Sony Records to track thier compact disc manufacturing. Each album manufactured by Sony will have a DIDP number on the disc. DIDX, which stands for Digital IDentification eXternal, is a Sony Records code that was used to track the manufacturing of compact discs by Sony for other companies. Each album manufactured by Sony for another company, such as the early Dark Side of the Moon compact discs that were manufactured at Sony's DADC plant for EMI Records, will have a DIDX number on the disc. Label Codes: Label codes are the 4 digit numbers that are found on the labels of some CDs. These label codes are designated by the IFPI to indicate the company that owns the rights to the property on the CD. Some of the registered labels codes are:\n\nLC 0148 - Capitol Records\n\nLC 0149 - CBS Records\n\nLC 0162 - Columbia Records\n\nLC 0542 - EMI Records\n\nLC 1305 - Harvest Records\n\nLC 1331 - EMIDisc Records\n\nLongbox Packaging: In the late 1980s and early 1990s, CDs were often released in a longbox to help record shops display CDs in deep bins made for vinyl record albums. The longboxes were a 12 inch long by 6 inch wide cardboard box inside which was the CD in a jewel case. The longbox was discontinued in April 1993. Manufacturing Dates (EMI / Capitol Records):\n\n1983-1984 - The first Pink Floyd compact discs that were released in the U.S. (Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, David Gilmour-About Face) were manufactured for the U.S. market by Toshiba-EMI in Japan. These CDs have all black labels and \"Made in Japan\" is designated on the label and cover. 1984-1985 - In September 1984, Capitol Records began using the Sony DADC plant in Terre Haute, Indiana to manufacture CDs (prior to starting up their own manufacturing facilities in Jacksonville, Illinois). One of the first CDs that was produced at this plant was the first U.S. made issue of Meddle. 1985-1986 - Since CD manufacturing plants in the U.S. were still limited, many CDs sold in the U.S. at this time were imported from foriegn pressing plants. Some original releases of Pink Floyd compact discs by EMI in the U.S. were manufactured for the U.S. market by the following plants:\n\nNimbus, Monmouth, U.K. (Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets)\n\nPhilips/PolyGram, Hanover, West Germany (Ummagumma)\n\nVictor Company of Japan (JVC) (More, Atom Heart Mother)\n\nBMG Sonopress, West Germany (Obscured by Clouds)\n\n1986 - In late 1986, Philips DuPont Optical or \"PDO\" of West Germany opened a CD pressing plant in Kings Mt., North Carolina. PDO pressed copies of Dark Side of the Moon at this plant in late 1986/early 1987. 1987 - EMI began producing CDs for the U.S. market at its plant in Jacksonville, Illinois (CAPITOL JAX), which had been a vinyl pressing plant since 1964. Most of the Capitol /EMI compact discs released in the U.S. during the late 1980s and 1990s were pressed at this plant. 2004 - In March, 2004, EMI announced that it was going to cease producing its own CDs and DVDs. Cinram International, a Canadian company, would take over the production of CDs and DVDs for all EMI companies previously supplied by the Jacksonville, Illinois, plant, which would be closed. Cinram produces CDs and DVDs for EMI out of its plant in Richmond, Indiana.\n\nManufacturing Dates (CBS / Sony Records):\n\n1984 - The original Columbia CDs released in the U.S. were made in Japan. These included the first issues of Wish You Were Here, The Wall, The Final Cut, David Gilmour, and The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. 1984-1985 - The U.S. record industry began converting U.S. record plants to the manufacture of compact discs. The first such plant was the Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC) manufacturing plant in Terre Haute, Indiana, which opened in 1983 as a joint venture between CBS and Sony. The earliest U.S. pressings of Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, The Final Cut, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason were done by Digital Audio Disc Corp. DADC is now part of Sony Disc Manufacturing (SDM). 1985-1987 - In addition to manufacturing CDs at the Terre Haute, Indiana plant during this period, Columbia Records also used Nippon Columbia (Denon) and the Victor Company of Japan (JVC) to manufacture discs for the U.S. market. 1988-1989 - Columbia Records began producing CDs at its Pitman, New Jersey plant, which was an old CBS Records plant (it had been producing LPs since 1960) retrofitted to make CDs. This plant is still in operation today. 1995 - In spring 1995, Nimbus opened a CD manufacturing plant in Sunnyvale, California. Nimbus / CA pressed some Pink Floyd CDs, including P-U-L-S-E (1995), The Division Bell, Animals (1997 edition), The Final Cut (1997 edition), and Is There Anybody Out There? - The Wall Live 1980-81 (2000).\n\nMatrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers printed on a compact disc in the mirror band close to the center hole of the CD. Matrix information may be printed to be read from the top side (label side) of the CD, while other matrix information may be printed to be read from the bottom side of the CD. In some instances, matrix information is printed on both the top and bottom sides of the disc, with the bottom side matrix information being the mastering information, and the top side matrix information being the pressing information. In other instances, both the mastering and pressing information is printed on the same side of the disc.\n\nThe following matrix band information can be found on many compact discs:\n\nCatalog number - The identifying number given to the release by the record company. Manufacturer - On some CDs, on the plastic hub around the center hole (not on the shiny part of the disc), there is imprinted information about the disc manufacturer. (In this discography, this information is indicated in brackets.) For example:\n\n[CMU P] - Columbia Records, Pitman, New Jersey\n\n[CSR] - CBS / Sony Records, Tokyo, Japan\n\n[DADC] - Sony's Digital Audio Disc Corp., Terre Haute, Indiana\n\n[NIMBUS/CA] - Nimbus U.S.A., Sunnyvale, California\n\n[PDO] - Philips DuPont Optical, Kings Mt., North Carolina\n\nManufacturer's Work Order Number - This often is in the form of the scan code that can only be read by a special scanner. Mastering Information - On some CDs there are three numbers separated by dashes, such as 2-2-1. These numbers refer to the father, the mother, and the stamper. In the example given, 2-2-1, the first 2 indicates that the CD was made from the second father, the second 2 indicates that the CD was made from the second mother made from the second father, and the third number, 1, means that the CD was made using the first stamper made from the second mother (The stamper is what is installed in the mold machine). Pressing Plant - Pressing plant information is often found in the matrix, either as a part of the SID Code or as an abbreviation. For example, the letters \"JAX\" found in the matrix indicate that the CD was made at the EMI pressing plant located in Jacksonville, Illinois. Selection Source Master - On some CDs, the selection source master is designated by information such as RE2. In the example given, RE2 indicates that the selection source master is at revision level 2. SID Codes - On many CDs, there are two Source Identification Codes (SID Code) in the matrix band. The SID Code, which was introduced in April 1994, consists of the letters IFPI (which stands for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry), followed by 4 or 5 additional characters. There are two different SID Codes found on CDs:\n\nMastering Code - The first SID Code in the matrix band is the \"Mastering Code.\" The Mastering Code begins with \"IFPI\" followed by a sequence of digits beginning with the letter L, followed by two numbers that indicate the pressing plant, and then 1 or 2 additional digits that indicate the Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) that cut the glass master. The Mastering Code is put on the CD at the time the glass master of the CD is cut by the LBR, and it appears on all subsequent pressings of the CD sourced from that specific glass master. Mould Code - The second SID Code on a CD is the \"Mould Code.\" The Mould Code begins with \"ifpi\" followed by two digits that indicate the specific pressing plant that pressed the disc, and two additional digits that indicate the unique mould or stamper that pressed the CD.\n\nSID Mould Codes, which indicate where a CD was stamped or pressed, include:\n\n14 - EMI Records pressing plant, Greenbridge, Swindon, England\n\n15 - EMI Compact Disc BV pressing plant, Uden, Netherlands\n\n16 - EMI Records pressing plant, Jacksonville, Illinois\n\n2T - Nimbus Records pressing plant, Sunnyvale, California\n\n38 - Zomax Optical pressing plant, Plymouth, Minnesota\n\n45 - Sony Records pressing plant, Japan\n\n51 - Sony Records pressing plant, Terre Haute, Indiana\n\n65 - Sony Records pressing plant, Australia\n\n67 - Sony Records pressing plant, Canada\n\n72 - Sony Records pressing plant, Pitman, New Jersey\n\n92 - Sony Records pressing plant, Austria\n\nAA - EMI Compact Disc BV pressing plant, Uden, Netherlands\n\nTotal Time: The total time for each CD is provided in minutes and seconds. Total time readings can vary by a second or two depending on the CD player or software program used to do the readings.Track Peak Levels: The peak volume levels for every song on a CD have been noted in this discography. These peak volume levels were read using EAC software, and are measured as percentages, with the maximum possible peak level being 100%. It is useful to use peak level readings to compare different because CDs that have different peak levels reveal that the CDs were made from different masterings (and, therefore, sound different).\n\nNote: The matrix information listed in this discography is not intended to be complete listings. This is known matrix information only. Matrix information from multiple copies is listed if known.\n\nSamplers\n\nCapitol Records 50th Anniversary 8-CD box set\n\nTitle: Capitol Records 50th Anniversary (8-CD box set)\n\nRecord Company: Capitol Records\n\nCatalog Number: DPRO-79244\n\nRelease Date: 1992\n\nRelease Information: An 8-CD promo only box set that includes one Pink Floyd song.
