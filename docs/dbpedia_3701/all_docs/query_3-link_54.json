        "text": "Gordon MacRae was an actor on stage and screen as well as a radio and TV star who was also a recording artist, having hits from the late 1940s through to the end of the â50s, both as a solo artist and in duets with Jo Stafford. He is best known for his starring roles in two movie versions of Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals, âOklahoma!â in 1955 and âCarouselâ the following year. This compilation provides a comprehensive overview of his recording career from his early days with the Musicraft label and through his many years with Capitol through to the early â60s by which time his exploits as a chart artist were over.\n\nIt features his eight solo hits and his ten hit duets with Jo Stafford, including the 1948 No. 1 âMy Darling, My Darlingâ, and the Top 5 hits ââAâ Youâre Adorableâ and âWhispering Hopeâ. Other artists featured in duets with him are Gisele Mackenzie and June Hutton, and the recordings include performances with some of the top arranger/conductors of the era - Walter Gross, Carlyle Hall, Paul Weston, Les Baxter, Frank De Vol, Carmen Dragon, Alex Stordahl and Van Alexander. Comprising selected A and B sides of his single releases plus tracks from his albums of this era, the collection has been compiled and annotated by former national newspaper showbiz writer Geoff Wilding.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nâWith more than 100 tracks spread over 4 CDs, this new release from Acrobat, expertly compiled and annotated by Geoff Wilding, looks set to be the definitive Gordon MacRae collection on CD. It is not complete of course but it's as near as we are going to get, now that the international conglomerates that own the back catalogue of the once major record companies are no longer interested in their musical heritage. It's releases like this that collectors prize and which are becoming increasingly rare, so full marks and grateful thanks to Acrobat for continuing to issue a project such as thisâ¦ This is an extremely enjoyable and welcome collection, with all the usual attention to detail we have come to expect from Acrobat - full discographical details and a comprehensive liner booklet to add to the attractionâ - Gerry Stonestreet (In Tune Issue 338)"
