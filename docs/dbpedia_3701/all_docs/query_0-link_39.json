        "text": "FUNNY STUFF: WOODY ALLEN 1 (28:50)\n\nI recently discovered two reels of tape that I had made for my mother, which were 3.75 ips copies of my first 12 shows, so even though the quality isn't perfect, they still sound pretty good, and I can make them available here. I'd be a lot happier if I'd discovered almost any other 12 shows, since I certainly got a lot more relaxed on the air as the show progressed, but what the hell. Here, from January 7, 1983, is the very first edition of \"Bob Claster's Funny Stuff,\" featuring Woody Allen. In the early days of the show, KCRW Production Manager Tom Strother and I did a running gag at the top of every show, in which he'd be the incompetent engineer playing the wrong theme music every week. Pretty incredible how long it took us to realize it didn't really work.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: PETER COOK & DUDLEY MOORE (30:42)\n\nShow #2, from 1/21/83. If you've never heard this stuff, I envy you. I had always planned to end the show with a different incomprehensible quote that had something to do with a sense of humor, like \"If your sense of humor is in your wallet, you'll never be short changed,\" but when, here in show #2, I stumbled upon \"Always keep that sense of humor well exercised, because you never know when you're going to need it,\" it seemed surprisingly apt, and I just stuck with it. You never know when you'll be struck with an unexpected attack of actual sincerity. It's also worth noting here that already, in show #2, I had started running over time.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: NICHOLS & MAY (30:54)\n\nShow #3, from 1/28/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: CLASSIC CLOWNS OF RADIO (27:14)\n\nShow #4, from 2/11/83. I was going to be co-hosting a series of old-time radio comedies during the upcoming pledge drive, and so this show, featuring Laurel & Hardy, Fibber McGee & Molly, Abbott & Costello, Groucho Marx, Fred Allen (with Oscar Levant and Tallulah Bankhead), and Jack Benny. This reminds me of a story I find amusing. When I originally pitched the idea for \"Bob Claster's Funny Stuff,\" I put together a list of the various artists I would feature. You know, Woody, Newhart, Freberg, Cook & Moore, Lehrer, Nichols & May, etc. There was a man who was a consultant to the station, and he had the final say, since our then-station manager admittedly knew absolutely nothing about comedy. He looked over the list, and said he didn't understand why Jimmy Durante wasn't included. Happily, he gave his thumb's up despite the glaring omission of the Great Schnozzola.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: WOODY ALLEN 2 (28:49)\n\nThere was an error in the program guide, and it wasn't supposed to say \"Woody Allen,\" but since there was another great half hour of Woody Allen material, I figured, why the hell not. 2/25/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: TOM LEHRER (38:33)\n\nThis is the original edition of this show, which was later expanded to the full hour you find above. I know, it's confusing. For my money, you should skip this file altogether and just listen to the one-hour version above, but it's here for the obsessive-compulsives. I am embarrassed to admit that this particular half-hour program clocked in at 38:33. Luckily, everyone at the station was so excited about this interview, no one gave me a hard time about it. 3/4/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: CARL REINER AND MEL BROOKS (31:18)\n\nThe Two Thousand Year Old Man, as performed by Mel Brooks with Carl Reiner is one of the great comic creations of our time. However, most people don't know that these bits, as preserved on records, were mostly improvised and (rather clumsily) edited. And they're very uneven. Which is why I went through all of them and culled just the best moments and made my own clumsy edit. Actually, my edits are a lot better than theirs! There's also a fun promo tacked on the end of this. March 18, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: PETER SELLERS (30:08)\n\nOkay, so you love his movies, but if you haven't heard his comedy records, mostly produced by George Martin, you're in for a treat. This is from very early in the FS series, April 1, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SIXTIES IMPROV GROUPS (31:11)\n\nThe Committee, The Premise, Second City. Some really great stuff here, featuring the glorious Barbara Harris and Alan Arkin and more. April 15, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: EARLY BRITISH RARITIES (30:31)\n\nOne of my favorite corners of my comedy collection is the one with the rare British stuff, featuring early work of the Pythons, Beyond the Fringe, etc. This is a theme I'd revisit again and again (there's another later one below with some of the same stuff, but not all). April 22, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FIRESIGN THEATER (30:36)\n\nThis show was almost totally taken up with the original \"Nick Danger: Third Eye\" piece. Get out the headphones, and enjoy. It's brilliant. And then, go and listen to an interview I did with Firesign's Phil Proctor, 7 years later, in which you will find many fascinating insights into the way Firesign worked their magic. April 29, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BASEBALL '83 (31:20)\n\nI think I did a baseball special almost every year the show was on the air, either to celebrate Opening Day, or the World Series. This was the first one, from 1983. In addition to the obligatory Abbott & Costello, there's Bob Newhart, Danny Kaye, and the singing of Willie Mays, Jay Johnstone, and Ron Cey, as well as, in my opinion, the very best recording of \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" ever recorded. And... Helen Dell! Scroll down to find a two-part baseball series from '88 with a lot of different stuff. May 6, 1983\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THEODORE (aka BROTHER THEODORE) (31:01)\n\nThis is an almost entirely superfluous program, as it's almost entirely made up of the incredible \"Quadrupedism\" routine, which is also heard in its entirety on the one-hour show I did which also contained the interview I did with Theodore in 1989. Go listen to that instead. I only put it here because I could. From May 20, 1983\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FLANDERS AND SWANN 1 (30:58)\n\nThis was the first show I did featuring the marvelously witty songs of Flanders and Swann. \"Madeira M'Dear\" is one of the cleverest lyrics ever written. Syllepsis, gotta love it. This show features the better-known work from their two successful Broadway revues (\"At The Drop of a Hat\" and \"At The Drop of Another Hat,\" and a nice selection of songs from their album about animals, \"The Bestiary.\" Scroll down a bit to find a later show that has some more obscure goodies. June 3, 1983\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BOB NEWHART 1 (29:08)\n\nOne of the truly great all-time stand-up comedians. His monologues, usually consisting of one end of a conversation, often but not always on the phone, are beautifully crafted Swiss watches. His timing is absolutely impeccable, and his ideas are genius. Yes, he was wonderful on television in many series for many years, but this is where he really strutted his considerable stuff. People will be studying, marveling at, and laughing at this material forever. June 10, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: LILY TOMLIN 1 (28:49)\n\nThis is a nice overview of the many great characters created by Lily Tomlin with her partner, Jane Wagner. Edith Ann, Ernestine, Mrs. Judith Beasley, they're all here. A brilliant performer, still going strong today. There's another completely different Tomlin show at the end of October, so scroll down. June 17, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FOURTH OF JULY (29:08)\n\nA rousing patriotic batch of comedy featuring Albert Brooks, Stan Freberg, and Bob Newhart, great Americans all. July 1, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: HENNY YOUNGMAN (28:54)\n\nThe all-time king of the one-liners, Henny Youngman would come out with a violin, pay a few scratchy notes on it, and then tell the corniest, oldest jokes you've ever heard. And make no mistake, these jokes were only slightly less old and corny then as they are now. But his timing was impeccable, and his attitude was great. Gotta love Henny. (This recording just turned up, and is comparatively low-fi, but still enjoyable.) July 8, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: DANNY KAYE 1 (29:08)\n\nPeople tend to either love Danny Kaye or hate him. I'm in the former category. His children's album, \"Mommy, Gimme a Drink of Water\" was a key part of my childhood. It is in this show that I started begging for an invitation to Danny's house for Chinese food, a campaign that was completely unsuccessful. August 5, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: DAVID STEINBERG 1 (29:28)\n\nSteinberg is now known primarily as a TV director and host of a terrific cable show about comedy, but he used to be a rabbinical student turned standup comic, and made some very funny records, samples of which are here for your amusement. If you enjoyed this, scroll down near the bottom of this list, where you'll find another selection of Steinberg Stuff, which is somewhat similar, but has some different stuff that's also great. August 12, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS (34:41)\n\nIt's hard to imagine that there once was a time when people needed to be introduced to Monty Python, but it would seem that there was, and that's what happens in this program. I can't believe I actually said that there were five or six seasons of their TV show, either. Shame on me. Everyone knows they did 3 series of 13 and another series of 6 without Cleese, totaling 45 of the funniest and most innovative half-hours in the history of television. At any rate, I've gone through this one and made whole again certain bits I abbreviated for time, which is why it's an odd length. Interview excerpts contained in the show come from a promotional disk I was sent, and not from interviews I conducted myself, though if you'll scroll up, you'll find lovely interviews granted me by John Cleese, John Cleese + Michael Palin, and Terry Jones. Can you tell I love these guys? (By the way, the Shakespeare program mentioned at the end was called \"No Holds Bard\" and can be found here.) From 8/19/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ALLAN SHERMAN (27:37)\n\nFirst, perhaps the very stupidest of the opening schticks, featuring Tom Strother and current KCRW Chief Engineer Steve Herbert unable to save a truly stupid idea. Then, I read, somewhat badly, the liner notes from an Allan Sherman greatest hits collection, but... from then on out, it's a really nice hand-picked assortment of some very clever and utterly lovable work from Allan Sherman, including some lesser-known gems. (I went through this one and re-constructed it with modern stereo digital versions of this material, to make it more enjoyable.) Originally aired 8/26/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BOB NEWHART 2 (30:19)\n\nDespite the fact that Newhart's stand-up days were brief compared with his sitcom career, there are so many brilliant pieces. This half-hour, the second I did, has some stuff that's not even in the big CD set of his best bits, though I think they should be. This stuff is such a joy. September 16, '83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: IRENE HANDL with PETER SELLERS (31:25)\n\nIrene Handl was a great British character actress, but also a novelist and writer. She appeared in over 100 British films, and got to know Peter Sellers making the great film, \"I'm All Right, Jack.\" She did a number of pieces with Sellers on his records, which she wrote as well as performed in, and the two best ones are here. Then, because there's a little time left over, a few Sellers obscurities. From 9/23/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: LILY TOMLIN 2 (29:41)\n\nFirst of all, you really must realize that it is only my dedication to historical accuracy that keeps me from deleting these utterly incompetent attempts at comedy at the top of these shows. Once you endure that, there's a nice selection of Lily Tomlin / Jane Wagner brilliance. Most of the show is a solid chunk from Lily's first Broadway show, but there's a great Ernestine the telephone operator bit too. From 10/28/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: MAL SHARPE (30:17)\n\nMal Sharpe has made a career out of man in the street interviews. What makes them so special is the fact that he's not trying to ridicule or mock the people he's talking to. He's adorable, and finds adorable people to talk to, and the whole thing is just a lovely pleasure. He has mainly done this for radio and television commercials, but has done a lot of work for radio and a little for records as well. Rhino had just released an album of his called \"The Meaning of Life,\" and that's what is excerpted in this half hour. A year or so after this broadcast, I had the opportunity to interview Mal, and you can find that interview here. December 2, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE FIRST FAMILY (28:40)\n\nThis record, a comedic portrayal of President John F. Kennedy and his family, was a national phenomenon. Vaughn Meader, whose impersonation of JFK was spot on, seemed to be set for life. And then, one Friday in November 1963, it all came crashing down. At the time of this broadcast, it had been 20 years, and as of this writing it's been more than 50. To this day, this is still a record that you are almost guaranteed to find in the comedy bin of your local thrift shop. The record, surprisingly, holds up quite well. December 9, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: JEAN SHEPHERD (29:41)\n\nIt's hard to decide what was best about New York in the mid-sixties. It's sort of a tossup between the best pizza imaginable and Jean Shepherd on the radio every night. The holiday perennial, \"A Christmas Story,\" was based on his stories, and at the time of this broadcast, it had just opened in theaters. This program is taken primarily from the records he released, which, admittedly, aren't as good as his radio show was, or even the tapes on which he reads from his books. But even mid-level Shepherd is a glorious thing. December 16, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: XMAS '83 (31:44)\n\nThis was the first of many Christmas specials I did, and in it, I mostly get the low hanging fruit out of the way. Great stuff, certainly, but few surprises. December 23, 1983.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: NEW YEAR'S SPECIAL - CREDIBILITY GAP WITH HARRY SHEARER (32:19)\n\nHow great is this? The legendary Credibility Gap, a comedy group featuring Michael McKean, David Lander, Richard Beebe and Harry Shearer used to produce a simulcast audio to the Rose Parade telecasts, and here to introduce and discuss excerpts from this great stuff is Harry himself. From 12/30/83.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FIRST ANNIVERSARY (Part 1) (29:52)\n\nBasically, it's Funny Stuff's Greatest Hits. All classic bits. Nichols & May, John Cleese, Tom Lehrer, Woody Allen, etc. Can't miss. Originally broadcast January 6, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FIRST ANNIVERSARY (Part 2) (29:35)\n\nMore of Funny Stuff's Greatest Hits. Credibility Gap, Bob Newhart, Shelley Berman, Lily Tomlin, Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, Python, etc. Originally broadcast January 13, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: STEVE GOODMAN (28:04)\n\nSteve Goodman was a brilliant singer-songwriter, and while he wasn't primarily a comedian, he wrote some brilliantly funny songs. You'll find many of the best of them here. Originally broadcast February 10, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: A FUNNY STUFF SAMPLER (59:20)\n\nNot exactly sure how this came to be, but I had two afternoon one-hour slots in February of 1984, which mainly served as a teaser to get people to tune in in the evenings at the regular time. It's odds and sods and greatest hits, etc. This one has Woody Allen, Nichols & May, Shelley Berman, John Cleese, and many more. Originally broadcast February 17, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SHELLEY BERMAN 2 (28:33)\n\nThis was the second Shelley Berman show in the series, but it's all I've got at this point. Stay tuned, the first one may very well turn up. Meanwhile, here's some lesser-known stuff by this brillant performer. Originally broadcast February 17, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: MARTY FELDMAN 1 (28:14)\n\nIf you only know of Marty from his film work, you're in for a treat. He did some wonderful sketch comedy work on television in the UK, with some classic bits, many of which were written by then- and future-Pythons. This show is taken from a record of his best TV work. Scroll down near the bottom of this list to find another Feldman edition of this show that has some of the same stuff, but also includes some delightfully odd records he made. Originally broadcast March 2, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS (29:57)\n\n\"TW3\" was a briiliant TV show of topical satire in Britain that aired in 1962-3, and then there was an American version in 1963-4. Some of the brightest lights in comedy on both sides of the pond were involved in the writing and performing. Among the alumni are David Frost, John Cleese & Graham Chapman, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, and Dennis Potter over there, and Buck Henry, Woody Allen, Tom Lehrer, Nichols & May, Henry Morgan, and Calvin Trillin over here. This makes for a fascinating compare-and-contrast. Also, in this program, you can hear David Frost deliver John Cleese's \"Regella\" piece which he performed exclusively for us. Originally broadcast March 9, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: JONATHAN WINTERS (28:47)\n\nOriginally broadcast March 16, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BEYOND THE FRINGE (30:41)\n\nOne can not overstate the importance to the development of 20th Century Comedy of Beyond The Fringe. Nor can one deny how very funny they were. This 4-man group consisting of Peter Cook & Dudley Moore with Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett took the world by storm on both sides of the Atlantic in the beginning of the '60s. One could easily put together any number of great half hours from their material, and this is one of them. Originally broadcast March 23, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ALFRED HITCHCOCK (29:32)\n\nI'll never forget watching Tom Snyder interview Hitchcock on the late lamented \"Tomorrow Show,\" and hearing Snyder say, \"Everyone thinks of you as the master of suspense and horror, but tell us, does Alfred Hitchcock have a sense of humor?\" As much as I loved Snyder, that was probably the dumbest question he ever asked. Humor suffuses so much of Hitchcock's work, and it's a delicious, dark, macabre humor. This show is taken from a great album he put out called \"Music to be Murdered By.\" Some of the musical arrangements, by Jeff Alexander, are as tasty as the great director's commentary. Originally broadcast March 30, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: GARRISON KEILLOR 1 (29:07)\n\nThis is a collection of excerpts from Keillor's stories and songs, mostly taken from \"A Prairie Home Companion.\" If you haven't already, you might want to listen to the 1985 interview I did with him, and if you'll scroll down a little, you'll find another collection of Keillor stuff. Originally broadcast April 13, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE RAZZIES (34:51)\n\nThe Golden Raspberry Foundation gives out their Razzie awards every year just before the Oscars, to the worst films and performances of the year. They've come a long way since 1984, when this, their 4th Annual such ceremony, took place. And although a lot of the comedy that takes place at these events is visual, this audio recording is still quite amusing. One of the co-founders of the Foundation, Head Berry John Wilson, joins me to introduce this show. 1983 was a great year for bad movies, with Pia Zadora, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and John Travolta all with noteworthy entries. \"Lonely Lady\" was a tough one to beat, though. (The address for the foundation given at the end of the broadcast is almost certainly no longer their current address, so check their website for current contact info rather than using it.) Originally broadcast April 20, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: A SALUTE TO THAT OTHER MEDIUM, TELEVISION (28:57)\n\nA collection of stuff about the boob tube, with David Steinberg, Gabe Kaplan, Lily Tomlin, Firesign Theater, Stan Freberg, Monty Python and more. Many of the references may be foreign to the younger ones among you, but you have other things to compensate for that. Originally broadcast April 27, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE BIRDS AND BEES (29:22)\n\nThis is a collection of comedy about parents with kids who suddenly wonder where babies come from. If you still don't know, I'm not sure you'll get the answer here, and if you do have the answer, please drop me a line and let me know. No actual birds or bees were harmed in the making of this show. Marty Feldman, Shelley Berman, Cook & Moore, and others are included, but the main reason for doing this show was that it gave me an excuse to play a magnificent bit of comedy from an obscure album called \"The Sex Life of the Primate\" featuring Shelley Berman, Anne Meara, her husband Jerry Stiller, and Lovelady Powell. This comprises roughly the last ten minutes of this show, and if you've never heard it, you're in for a treat. Originally broadcast May 4, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: WOODY ALLEN 3 (30:02)\n\nOkay, I know I already did two collections of Woody Allen, and parts of this one were heard in one or the other of the previous two, BUT a lot of it wasn't, and there are also a few very rare chunks that I'll bet you've never heard. Originally broadcast May 11, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE TELEPHONE (29:50)\n\nI have no recollection as to why this is, but this is maybe the only non-pledge drive edition of this series that was done live in the studio as it aired. This is a collection of comedy having to do with Alexander Graham Bell's best idea. You may have heard a lot of this, but there's a prank call with Steve Allen and Jerry Lewis that you might not know which is great. Originally broadcast May 18, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SONG PARODIES (30:58)\n\nInspired by the ubiquity of Weird Al Yancovic's \"Eat It\" parody of Michael Jackson, this is an entire show of pop song parodies. And then I rant about \"Buffalo Bill\" some more. Originally broadcast May 25, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SHRINK RAP (30:17)\n\nFrom 1984, this is a collection of comedy having to do with psychiatry.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: NATIONAL LAMPOON (29:03)\n\nHere's a deliciously tasteless half hour taken not just from the National Lampoon's records, but also some stuff from their radio show, featuring early work of Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase, Joe Flaherty, John Belushi, and many more. Some very funny stuff here, including classic bits like the Chris Guest - Bill Murray Mr. Rogers parody, and one of my favorite pieces of writing by the great and terrible Michael O'Donoghue, \"Ice Capades - Grape Gum.\" Originally broadcast June 22, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: JOYCE GRENFELL (24:23)\n\nJoyce Grenfell was a great British comedic actress and monologist. If you like old British comedies (and you should), you'd recognize her face. Her monologues are more character study than stand-up, but that doesn't mean they're not as funny as they are sweet and charming. This was an abbreviated edition of the show due to station business, but I hope it's enough to cause you to fall in love with Joyce Grenfell. Originally broadcast Jun 29, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ALLAN SHERMAN 2 (30:00)\n\nAnother taste of the delightful work of Allan Sherman. Oddly enough, though most of this selection is new, I repeated a number of things from the first Sherman show (from the previous August). Mysterious were the ways of 1984 Bob. However, just for fun, I substituted the 1984 sequel record for the original \"Hello Mudda.\" If you want to hear the original, scroll up a bit, and it's in the first one. I have left in the KCRW ID at the end, because it was nice to hear the voice of the wonderful Georgia Griggs again. Originally broadcast July 6, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SPIKE JONES (29:21)\n\nSpike Jones and his City Slickers came along in the latter half of the Big Band Era, just in time to make sure it didn't take itself too seriously. First-rate musicianship was spiced up with sound effects, whistles, cow bells, gargling, and a wonderfully wacky sense of humor. Oh... at the end of this show, you'll hear me wonder aloud whether or not there is any surviving footage of Spike Jones and his City Slickers. This was before Google and before YouTube. The answer is yes, as they did a lot of television in the '50s. Go check it out, a lot of it is great. Originally broadcast July 13, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: TWO FUNNY LADIES; PHYLLIS DILLER AND JOAN RIVERS (31:00)\n\nI did a nice job on this one, I must say. I went through all of the records of these two pioneering comediennes (as they were called back then) and edited them together for an interesting compare and contrast. Really interesting, and a little horrifying, to hear all of this from a modern perspective. We have all, indeed, come a long way. Speaking of horrifying, I feel I must warn you that this show contains the sound of Phyllis Diller singing \"Satisfaction.\" She was actually a well-trained and accomplished musician, but there's no evidence of that whatsoever here. Also, at the end of this, you'll hear station announcements by the late Mitchell Harding, and Sarah Spitz, as well as a promo of mine for the following week's show. Originally broadcast July 20, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: RADIO ACTIVE (30:35)\n\nThis is a compilation of highlights from an album which is a compliation of highlights from a British radio show which parodies all the different sorts of radio, at least as heard in the UK. Pretty universal, though. Very funny stuff. This was originally heard on 8/10/84, but this is the rebroadcast from 10/30/87 which I chose because (a) it is better quality than the tape I have of the original broadcast, and (2) the rebroadcast was on my son's 2nd birthday, and I wish him a happy birthday in it!\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BURNS & SCHREIBER (29:18)\n\nJack Burns and Avery Schrieber were a great comedy team in the '60s, which sprang from The Second City originally. Their classic bit, \"The Cab Driver and the Conventioneer\" was, at the time, a fairly daring lampoon of bigotry. They both had widely varied careers in later life, with Burns being the head writer of \"The Muppet Show,\" and Schreiber starring in a series of well-known Doritos commercials. And that's Sarah Spitz wishing me goodnight at the end of the show. Originally broadcast Aug 17, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BRITISH OVERVIEW (27:47)\n\nAnother selection of wonderful comedy from Britain, this time featuring Beyond the Fringe, Flanders & Swann, Joyce Grenfell, Python, Kenneth Williams, Peter Sellers, Cook & Moore, and more. Originally broadcast Sept. 14, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BACK TO SCHOOL - BASEBALL (30:00)\n\nThis was basically a leftovers show, with the first half being Back to School stuff, and the second half being baseball things. Steve Goodman had just died, which I used as an excuse to play his glorious paean to the Cubs. Also represented herein are Klein, Cosby, Steinberg, Lehrer, Teresa Brewer, and Mickey Mantle. Originally broadcast Sept. 21, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: GARRISON KEILLOR 2 (29:52)This is another selection of comedy and stories from the commercially released tapes of highlights from \"A Prairie Home Companion.\" It would seem that this show marks the debut of the third and final version of the theme music I wrote for the show. And I played a little joke on Sarah Spitz at the end. If you haven't already heard it, you might want to also check out the 1985 interview I did with Garrison Keillor. Originally broadcast October 5, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE MARX BROTHERS (29:17)\n\nAlthough the recorded legacy of the Marx Brothers isn't as funny as their best movies, the fact is, nothing in the world is as funny as their best movies. This is a nice batch of rare radio appearances and concert recordings (mostly Groucho, obviously). If you love the Marxes (and if you don't, you're no friend of mine), you'll probably enjoy this. And you'll probably be glad you scrolled down to the three shows devoted exclusively to Groucho which you'll find below. Originally broadcast Oct 12, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SMASH FLOPS (28:32)\n\nThis is a silly one. There's a wonderfully goofy album called \"Smash Flops\" with songs by Richard Sherman (who, with his brother, foisted \"It's A Small World\" on us, among many other less obnoxious songs) and Milt Larsen (who did a lot of varied things including creating the Magic Castle in Hollywood), and so I tried to assemble a collection of intentionally bad songs, and threw in Bing Crosby's unintentionally hilarious interpretation of \"Hey Jude\" just for fun. There are some very rare things here by Steve Allen as well. Originally aired Oct. 19, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ALBERT BROOKS (29:18)\n\nAgain, you know his movie work, and he's funny when he turns up on TV, but you probably don't know his albums. This is a situation that can and should be rectified. Originally broadcast Nov 16, 1984.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: SECOND ANNIVERSARY (29:58)\n\nThis is an odd mishmash of things to celebrate two years on the air. Originally broadcast Jan 4, 1985.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: A WORD FROM OUR SPONSORS (29:40)\n\nA wide-ranging batch of comedy dealing with advertising and commercials. WIth some great Robert Klein stuff, Firesign Theater, National Lampoon, Bob Newhart, Lily Tomlin, and more. Originally broadcast Jan 25, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: OUR FURRY FRIENDS (29:20)\n\nA specially hand-picked assortment of choice morsels dealing with those below us on the food chain. Robert Klein, Bob Newhart, Garrison Keillor, Soupy Sales, and so many more. This is my favorite sort of FS show. Originally broadcast on Feb 8, 1985, this is from a July 23, 1989 rebroadcast.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ON BIRTH AND BABIES 1 (27:40)\n\nHere's a sweet show that I put together when my wife and I found out we were going to become parents for the first time. And then, I scheduled the repeat for the arrival date of young Maxwell Samuel Claster, but he showed up a few weeks early. If you or someone you know is expecting a visit from the stork, you might particularly enjoy this. Bill Cosby, Bob Newhart, John Cleese, Carl Reiner & Mel Brooks, Danny Kaye, Shelley Berman. Originally produced in 3/85, this is the tape of the 11/15/85 rebroadcast. If you scroll down, you'll find an expanded edition of this show, with some of the same but a lot of different stuff, which celebrated the birth of my other child, my daughter Zoe, in 1990.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: HOLLYWOOD (29:37)\n\nMovies and movie-making. Aired March 29, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BILL COSBY (29:18)\n\nThis is a tough one. Because obviously, we all feel a lot differently about Bill Cosby now than we did in 1985. The revelations concerning his behavior are disgusting and heartbreaking, mainly because of what the victims endured, but additionally because they make it difficult for us to enjoy his brilliant work. If you cant get past that, I completely understand. Seems very likely that the man is a monster. Skip this one. But the fact remains, this monster in his prime was one of the finest storytellers of his or any time. And this particular piece, about his childhood, is very possibly his masterpiece. Its called For Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With. Aired May 17, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: GROUCHO MARX 1 (29:48)\n\nThis is the first of a number of shows I did on Groucho. How can you not love Groucho? There is also a two-part episode from July 1988 which you'll find below that has a wide variety of things from various points in the career of the great Groucho, but this is exclusively an edit of highlights of the one man speaking tour he did near the end of his life. Marvin Hamlisch accompanies on piano! And there is also a show I did on the Marxes in October of '84. So much Marx to enjoy! Aired June 21, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: COMEDY ON 78s (30:03)\n\nAlthough most of them are long forgotten now, there were comedy 78s, and for this show, musician and musicologist Brad Kay brought by some choice goodies from his collection, dating back to 1903. Bear in mind that a lot of old comedy from that era would not pass contemporary standards of political correctness and taste, and some of it is downright racist, but it's still a fascinating and informative glimpse into the very early days of recorded comedy, featuring Arthur Collins, Cal Stewart, Nat M. Wills, Bert Williams, Will Rogers, and Fanny Brice. From July 19, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: STEVE ALLEN and FRIENDS (30:36)\n\nThis one makes me feel really old. At the time of this recording, in 1985, the topic of Steve Allen's company of repertory players (including Don Knotts, Tom Poston, Louis Nye, Bill Dana) was a lot less like ancient history than it seems now. l myself was a little too young to know their work firsthand, but they were still well known, like past cast members of SNL are regarded today. So, while I couldn't find any Tom Poston material on record, you will hear Allen's \"What is a Freem?\" as well as Knotts, Nye, Dana (as Jose Jimenez), and a great prank phonecall featuring Steve Allen with Jerry Lewis. I interviewed Steve Allen about these albums of prank calls, and while that tape still hasn't surfaced yet, I'm hopeful that it will. From July 26, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: UNINTENTIONAL COMEDY (29:58)\n\nA weird collection of weird records. Records made by witches, magicians, and Mr. Blackwell. I love this stuff, but there's no evidence that there's anyone else who does. From August 2, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: LENNY BRUCE (28:08)\n\nSome truly funny stuff from Lenny's earlier less-troubled days. Original broadcast Aug 9, 1985.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: THE BONZO DOG (DOO DAH) BAND (29:29)\n\nNot comedians per se, but still responsible for some very funny records. Neil Innes of this group went on to collaborate with the Pythons (mostly Eric Idle) on various projects, including The Rutles, whose sterling efforts are also sampled herein. This show contains a bit of McCartney trivia you might not know, and also a version of \"The Sound of Music\" to end all others. If only. Originally Broadcast Aug 16, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: RELIGION - PART 1 (30:21)\n\nA selection of comedy having to do with people's belief in invisible imaginary supernatural beings, and the various things they do in the name of this belief. In this part, we hear from Robin Williams, Burns & Schreiber, Alan Bennett, Monty Python, Marty Feldman, Emo Philips, and Tom Lehrer. Originally aired Aug 30, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: RELIGION - PART 2 (30:06)\n\nMore of the same. In this part, we hear from Lenny Bruce, Brooks & Reiner, John Cleese with Jonathan Lynn, David Steinberg, and Bill Cosby . Originally aired Sept 6, 1985\n\nFUNNY STUFF: A SALUTE TO RADIO (29:10)\n\nThis is a nice batch of lesser-known comedy material about radio. Bill Murray pitching in a public radio pledge drive, Jean Shepherd's classic piece about the Little Orphan Annie secret decoder pin, Stan Freberg, George Carlin, Robert Klein. Originally aired 4/18/86, this is the tape of the 11/25/88 rebroadcast.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: ROBERT KAPLOW (Moe Moskowitz) (30:00)\n\nKCRW was and is a proud member of NPR. In those days, their morning news program, \"Morning Edition\" was very popular, but had a very strict style and format. Every now and then, like a surprise party when it isn't even your birthday, along would come the insane intrusion of Moe Moskowitz, entrepreneur, agent, promoter, and all around pain in the ass to delightfully deflate everything. It was always a treat when the regular newspeople of the show would play along. Interestingly enough, Moe was the brainchild of a novelist and high school English teacher named Robert Kaplow. (One of his lovely books was made into a charming Richard Linklater movie called \"Me and Orson Welles,\" and there is reason to believe that a forthcoming Linklater flick will also bear his name. In this half-hour, you'll hear the best of the Morning Edition pieces, with Kaplow co-hosting over the phone from New Jersey. From October 12, 1986.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: BILLY CONNOLLY (29:25)\n\nAt one point, I asked my audience to tell me who they though the all-time funniest person was, as well as the funniest person currently working. This wasn't entirely a ploy to get mail, as I knew it would lead so some good programs. Like this one, when sterling listener David Ritchie came forth with the great Billy Connolly, a Scots comedian who, at that point, was utterly unknown to me, just as he was, at the time, utterly unknown to virtually all Americans. That kind gesture resulted in this program, in which David helps me introduce Billy, and later led to my meeting and interviewing Connolly in a program you can find above. Originally aired 3/27/87.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: DUCK'S BREATH MYSTERY THEATER (28:54)\n\nDuck's Breath Mystery Theater were a funny sketch comedy troupe that found a home doing occasional pieces for NPR in the '80s. Some of their characters, like Dr. Science and Ian Shoales, were quite popular for a while. Originally aired 4/10/87.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: LEFTOVERS (30:06)\n\nA bunch of stuff that was lying around, late additions, etc. Danny Kaye singing Gilbert and Sullivan, Garrison Keillor, a few more great Moe Moskowitz pieces. I upgraded the Kaye tracks, so the apology for how crappy they sound doesn't really apply anymore. Originally aired 6/26/87.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: CONTEMPORARY COMICS (Part 2 of 2) (28:23)\n\nThis is the second part of a 2 part show saluting the then-current crop of comedians. The ground rule was that they had to have been fairly unknown five years earlier. And I'm happy to say that I chose wisely. Part one, which I still haven't located, was Howie Mandel, Garry Shandling, and Emo Philips. In this part, it's Bobcat Goldthwait, Judy Tenuta, and Stephen Wright, and then close with a brief tribute to Jackie Vernon who had just passed away. Originally aired 11/13/87.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FUNNY STUFF IN SPACE (28:02)\n\nA selection of comedy having to do with the space program, including a nice little interview with Bill Dana making the case that his Jose Jimenez character was not an unflattering stereotype. Originally heard on 11/20/87.\n\nFUNNY STUFF: FIFTH ANNIVERSARY Part One (30:21)\n\nA sampler, or maybe a \"Greatest Hits\" collection? January of 1988."
