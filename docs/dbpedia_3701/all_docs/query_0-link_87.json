        "text": "This article started as a Toppermost post. It grew and grew way beyond that. I’d written the Toppermost based on what I already had and knew, then had a knee operation and was in recovery. I spent the time of being confined to home and partly immobile, in researching, downloading the later (and very early) rarities which were new to me, and expanding the piece. It owes a massive debt to NancySinatra.com, which is full of information and quotes. Few if any artistes communicate with their fan base as she does.\n\nThe edited version is on Toppermost, where writers select their ten favourite songs. That’s not relevant here, but I will repeat the lis of ten (we all love lists), and add another ten as “shortlist.”\n\nMY TOP TEN (chronologically):\n\nThese Boots Are Made for Walkin’\n\nSand\n\nSummer Wine\n\nSugar Town\n\nSomething Stupid\n\nJackson\n\nSome Velvet Morning\n\nArkansas Coal\n\nDid You Ever?\n\nBurnin’ Down The Spark\n\nTEN MORE:\n\nSo Long Babe\n\nHow Does That Grab You Darlin’\n\nFriday’s Child\n\nBang Bang\n\nHook and Ladder\n\nDrummer Man\n\nAnnabell of Mobile\n\nKind of A Woman\n\nDolly & Hawkeye\n\nFlowers\n\nNancy Sinatra. I hadn’t realized how much I liked her. I started with buying her Reprise 45s as they came out, and noticed right away that the B-sides were unusually strong; as good or better than the A sides. The bass sound was always incredible too. I was never a Frank Sinatra fan (Sorry). I was Bob Dylan & The Beatles generation and to me Frank Sinatra was a previous generation’s style and music. For decades Somethin’ Stupid was the only Frank Sinatra recording in the house (though I now have several albums … I got older and less blinkered in my tastes).\n\nNancy Sinatra’s critical reputation has suffered from a strong streak of rock snobbery. The first two editions of Rolling Stone Album Guide simply skipped her. The third gave her albums a dismissive two stars, then the fourth skipped her again. In The Heart & Soul of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles, Dave Marsh included Lee Hazlewood’s production of Rebel Rouser, then dissed his “silly duet” with Nancy on These Boots Are Made For Walking. OK, Dave, but a “duet” is a song with two singers. Lee does not sing on it. Maybe you should actually listen to it. In Rat Pack Confidential, Shawn Levy was gratuitously nasty mentioning ‘terrible songs,’ but was more interested in her shorts, boots and go-go dancers.\n\nBut the tide is changing, and things get better … in 2015 Rolling Stone placed Nancy & Lee ninth in their list of Twenty Greatest Duos of All Time. David Hepworth placed Summer Wine on his list of “Greatest B sides of all time” in 2018. He’s right.\n\nBasically, she suffered because she was popular music aristocracy right from the start, and her elaborate musical arrangements indicated a silver spoon beginning.\n\nIn 1999 she was quoted:\n\nNANCY: I’m still “Frank’s kid” which is absurd at this point.\n\nShe spoke to The Telegraph in 2004:\n\nNANCY: My peers don’t care. To them, I’m Frank’s daughter and all I ever did right was to be born to him. I have never been accepted. I’ll never make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They’re never going to let me in. They gave Barry Sadler the Grammy for Ballad of the Green Berets the same year that Boots came out. And who ever listens to that now?\n\nTim Geary interview, 14 June 2004\n\nAnother quote:\n\nNANCY: I used to write three- and four-part harmonies for my YWCA club in high school. We used to win all the song contests. But people would say, ‘Look who her father is. He probably did the whole thing.\n\nAn astute comment is from Nancy Sinatra: Rock Goddess a 2004 article in The New York Times:\n\nJODY ROSEN: In part, Ms. Sinatra was a victim of the cultural politics of her time. Rock ‘n’ roll divided the nation along generational lines, but Ms. Sinatra remained agnostic, a stubbornly independent hip square who kept a foot in both camps. Her high hemlines, big boots and tough-girl vocal style were nothing if not modern. But she also recorded standards, and she remained closely associated with her father, the towering symbol of the previous musical era. (The pair sang several duets, including the fizzy No. 1 hit “Somethin’ Stupid.”) From today’s perspective, her refusal to choose musical sides looks refreshingly cosmopolitan; but in the eyes of the first wave of rock critics, it placed her on the wrong side of the generational gulf.\n\nNew York Times, 26 September 2004\n\nMost of the rock critics of the late 60s / 70s era were my age or slightly older, early R&B adopters, and we were prejudiced against the whole swingin’ rat pack Sinatra / Martin / Davis aura. It happens again and again with music. The first rock ‘n’ rollers dismissed the Swing era. We Beatles / Stones fans dismissed the era of teen idols named Jimmy, Bobby, Billy, Frankie, Johnny, Micky, Willy, Tony or Freddie. The punks dismissed prog. The indie bands dismissed the new romantics. That’s why a new, younger generation of listeners, musicians and critics have been able to take an unbiased view of her work and appreciate it properly.\n\nTime dilutes rock snobbery. I remember when the rock snobs hated ABBA and The Carpenters, both now lauded. All these years later, with so many songs, so many albums, Nancy Sinatra’s quality as a singer is apparent. In terms of “second generation artists” I can’t think of any that were more successful, or more accomplished, than her.\n\nIt’s re-assessment time. Last year (2018) Bobbie Gentry’s box set Chickasaw Country Child was selected as Reissue of The Year by Mojo (and by me). It was near the top in every other roundup of releases. Nancy Sinatra is due just such a respectful and comprehensive box set, and I believe it would gain similar acclaim.\n\nEARLY YEARS ON REPRISE\n\nFrank Sinatra founded the Reprise label at the start of the 1960s – its first 45s appeared in the UK (distributed by Pye) in September 1961. Sinatra had been negotiating to buy Verve and was beaten to it by MGM, and in retaliation set up his own label with several disgruntled Verve employees, most notably the accountant, Mo Ostin. Nancy Sinatra signed for Reprise in 1961. It remained Frank Sinatra’s own label, until 1963 when he sold it to Warner for 1.5 million plus a third share of the combined company. Warner saw buying out Reprise as a mere sweetener to obtain Sinatra’s acting services.\n\nNew Musical Express Annual 1962. Reprise Cover advert\n\nBack in 1961, it wasn’t a cool label, and at that point, neither was Warner Bros:\n\nFRED GOODMAN: Like Warner Bros. Reprise was not in the rock ‘n’ roll business, as this was music Sinatra was vehemently and publicly opposed to. The Reprise roster was a mix of Sinatra’s Las Vegas cronies like Sammy Davis Jnr and Dean Martin, plus Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Dennis Day, The McGuire Sisters and Dinah Shore – all well past their commercial peak. Early Reprise albums like The Ol’ Calliope Man Visits a German Hoffbrau, Sing Along in Greek, The X-15 and Other Sounds of Missiles, Rockets, Jets and Lou Monte’s Great Italian-American Hits had nothing on Warner Bros when it came to dreck.\n\nFred Goodman, The Mansion on The Hill, 1997\n\nRobin & The 7 Hoods, UK EP. Reprise’s public image\n\nJAMES KAPLAN: (Nancy Sinatra) had originally been signed to Reprise on the condition that she not record any rock ‘n’ roll. Obediently she cut a few novelty songs with the former Mousketeer Annette Funicello’s producer, a man named Tutti Camarata.\n\nJames Kaplan, Sinatra The Chairman\n\nKaplan wrote a long book on Frank Sinatra, and I wonder where he got the ‘condition not to record any rock ‘n’ roll.’? It seems possible. Frank’s quote is well-known:\n\nFRANK SINATRA: Rock ‘n’ roll smells phony and false. It is sung, played, and written for the most part by cretinous goons and by means of its almost imbecilic reiteration…it manages to be the martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth.\n\n(Frank Sinatra 1957, in ‘Western World’)\n\nElvis Presley had replied in dignified tones:\n\nELVIS PRESLEY: It’s the greatest music ever, and it will continue to be so. I like it, and I’m sure many other persons feel the same way. I also admit it’s the only thing I can do. He has a right to his opinion, but I can’t see him knocking my music for no good reason. I admire him as a performer and an actor, but I think he’s badly mistaken about this. If I remember correctly he was also part of a trend. I don’t see how he can call the youth of today immoral and delinquent.\n\nFrank’s quote was already four years old by the time Nancy signed with Reprise. Frank had helped organize the ‘Welcome Back’ show when Elvis left the army, and had Nancy greet him on his return with a box of dress shirts. Presley was booked to appear on Sinatra’s TV Special for Timex, Welcome Home, Elvis a month later for a then unprecedented $125,000. On that show, Nancy Sinatra duetted with Frank on You Make Me Feel So Old (Young).\n\nThen Frank recorded Everybody’s Twistin’ to align himself with the dance craze. People change.\n\nHER EARLY REPRISE SINGLES\n\nNancy Sinatra’s early attempts are available digitally as Bubblegum Girl Volumes 1 & 2. She often sounds little girlie in contrast to her later songs. The quality on download is surprisingly crisp and clear. Available digitally recurs a lot – some of her albums haven’t been treated to the comprehensive CD reissue programme one would expect. Japan had a penchant for early Nancy – a 1994 CD Tonight You Belong to Me collects it together.\n\nBubblegum Girl, Volume 1\n\nThe titles of her 45s alone say it all.\n\nCuff Links & A Tie Clip / Not Just Your Friend 1961\n\nTonight You Belong To me / You Can Have Any Boy 1962\n\nLike I Do / To Know Him Is To Love Him 1962\n\nJune July & August / Think of Me – 1962\n\nYou Can Have Any Boy / Tonight You Belong To Me 1962\n\nI See The Moon / Put Your Head On My Shoulder 1963\n\nThe Cruel War / One Way 1963\n\nThanks To You / Tammy – 1963\n\nWhere Do The Lonely Go / Just Think About The Good Times 1964\n\nThis Love of Mine / There Goes The Bride 1964\n\nTrue Love / The Answer To Everything 1965\n\nthen\n\nThink of Me / Tonight You Belong To Me was issued in Scandinavia and Italy in 1963, and as a 3 track EP in Italy along with Pensa Me\n\nHer first release was Cuff Links & A Tie Clip, on her Dad’s own label Reprise in September 1961. This guy turns up for a party formally dressed with cuff links and a tie clip. Wrong day. She’s got her pin curls in and is wearing chinos. She’s singing about having a party anyway (but just for two) with a hi-fi and the lights down low, just like easy listening LP sleeve photos, and we get a conversational interjection from a petulant male voice (Marty) complaining she’s got cold cream all over her face, a barrier for snogging no doubt. She removes his cuff links and tie clip. In other words, slight raunchiness, the girl leading the action, a touch of undressing even, and a contrasting male voice in dialogue. That’s four years before she met Lee, but in the same territory in a milder way. A lot of similar humorous stuff was a hit at the time. There was a whole genre of ‘clothes songs’ circa 1958-62 … Tight Skirt & A Sweater, Bobby Sox to Stockings, Pretty Plaid Skirt & Long Black Socks, Venus in Blue Jeans, Red Blue Jeans and a Ponytail, White Bucks and Saddle Shoes, No Chemise, Please, Straight Skirt, Checkered Continental Pants, Black Slacks, Blue Serge and White Lace. The fashion industry had discovered teen spending power. The music industry reflected it.\n\nBritish single. In 1961, a picture sleeve was rare in the UK. A colour picture sleeve was extremely rare. (Collectors note that copies with a picture sleeve are valued at £20).\n\nNANCY: I wasn’t really interested in a career. I was a happily married young woman, who wanted to be a good wife and raise a family. But when I told my father that I thought I could make a hit record, he said, ‘Try it.’ In those days, it didn’t cost a fortune. I went to Tutti Camarata, who was Disney’s musical director and produced Annette Funicello’s records, and told him that I wanted to do what she was doing, only with a couple of changes. One of my first singles for Reprise, ‘Like I Do,’ was successful in Japan, Italy… all over the world, except the United States. And my dad said, ‘You’re right, you do know how to make a hit record.’ Also, I repaid his recording company’s investment, which was very important to me.”\n\nAt that point, her father could make an album in three days with elaborate orchestration for $22,000. Nancy had chart hits in Italy from 1961 on … Like I Do was a major Italian hit (#2 in 1962). The Sinatras had some useful Italian connections, perhaps. A big Italian hit was an achievement as it was one of the largest European markets. In 1961, Italy was the coolest country, and Italian records were infiltrating the British charts at the time.\n\nFrom Billboard\n\nLike I Do is a set of lyrics to Dance of The Hours (La Danza delle Ore), from La Giaconda, just as Allan Sherman did soon afterwards with Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh. Hers was the first release of Like I Do, and also went Top Ten in South Africa, Japan and The Netherlands. In the UK Kay Starr and Maureen Evans covered it, and Maureen Evans got a major #3 hit in early 1963, and she skipped the novelty spoken bits in Nancy’s version, which improved its chances. In both the UK and the USA, they flipped Nancy’s original and put Phil Spector’s To Know Him Is To Love Him on the A-side, a bizarre choice as the Teddy Bears original had already been a US#1 hit in 1958.\n\nShe continued focussing on Italy, recording Italian language versions of Think of Me (as Pensa Me), There Goes The Bride (as Ecco Espossa) and True Love.\n\nA lot of the problem was being assigned producers from her dad’s era, like Tutti Camarata and Don Costa who pigeonholed her in the little girl category, coupled with a series of covers and weak songs. Camarata had helped get Disneyland Records under way in 1956, and he was a great arranger and conducted classical albums and produced 300 albums at Disney. Camarata was born in 1913 and came to prominence in the Tommy Dorsey era in the 1930s. Hardly the cutting edge guy for a girl in 1961.\n\nDon Costa was ten years younger, and was a great Frank Sinatra producer. Costa had her re-make Put Your Head On My Shoulder, and he had arranged Paul Anka’s #2 hit version back in 1958. Then The Lettermen charted with it. So what chance did another version have? These guys were still living in the sheet music era, where the song, not a particular recording, was the property and you had as many people record it as you possibly could.\n\nNANCY: the [bubblegum] music didn’t help. It was crappy music. It was OK in its time because there were a lot of us doing it. Like Lesley Gore and Annette [Funicello] and me. We had great arrangers like Don Costa and Tutti Camarata, but it was just not quality stuff. They walked the edge between pop and rock, but they never fell over the edge into rock. And it’s sad, because we could have made much better records earlier on.\n\nThe Believer, 1st July 2014\n\nTo my ears, they also walked close to the edge between pop and easy listening. The other “pop” girls like Lesley Gore, Brenda Lee and Helen Shapiro got more rocking arrangements. Take It’s My Party by Lesley Gore … the backing is simpler, sharper and more rhythmic. The backing chorus could be the other part of a girl group, not a chorus of staid male vocalists and female vocalists. You can almost hear the tuxedos and long frocks in the backing on Nancy’s backing singers. Crucially, It’s My Party was Quincy Jones’ first pop hit single as producer, and it made #1 on both R&B and Pop charts … the first recording, pre-Lesley Gore, had been The Chiffons. Now Nancy could have sung it equally as effectively as Lesley Gore. The difference is quality of production and material. Quincy Jones had first worked with Frank Sinatra back in 1958 too.\n\nOne wonders what chance she had in covering Tammy, which had been a US #1 hit in 1958 for Debbie Reynolds. Major hits were kept on catalogue then, and hearing her on radio you might just buy the original. This was particularly true in Britain. We were used to covers, as BBC Radio’s Light Programme had to play mainly live music, so had dance bands covering current hits. Then you’d go out and buy the original, or if short of money, go to Woolworths and buy the Embassy Records cover version. The version she did has lashings of echo and the backing arrangement starts off just like Debbie Reynolds.\n\nAccording to iTunes, her most popular song from the era is her bouncy cover of Tonight You Belong To Me, originally from 1926, but done by Patience and Prudence in 1956, which version appears in American Horror Story.\n\nThere Goes The Bride was a July 1964 B-side to This Love of Mine, which stands out with a male voice in front of hers (dum doo dooby dooby), with her voice ethereal and back in the mix. Ecco Espossa was the same song with the same male track. When they put on the Italian language vocal they brought her voice forward, and the male voice back, which makes it less unusual.\n\nIt’s Spring was her own composition. It’s not a pointer of things to come. It sounds like a mid-1950s film theme with orchestration from the same era.\n\nA glimpse of possibility is on her cover of Fats Domino’s 1961 song I’m Walkin’. It comes from a 1961 TV show, but has walking acoustic bass, and finishes with just her voice and the bass. It’s the sort of R&B song that Brenda Lee or Helen Shapiro would have done, and she could easily have gone down that path with success. Mind you, while the white socks were suitably teen for the USA, they would have been regarded as weird in Britain.\n\nVIDEO LINK: I’M WALKIN’ TV 1961\n\nShe had married teen pop singer Tommy Sands in 1960, and appeared on TV with him, duetting on the Ed Sullivan Show with Hey, Good Looking.\n\nBubblegum Girl Vol 2 – they’re chronologically divided\n\nNancy made a play for the burgeoning folk scene by recording the earnest folk club favourite, The Cruel War with guitar and harmonica (so right) then had the “Muzak in the Mall” male chorus doing the response line (so wrong). Her voice is excellent, avoiding the piercing sopranos the female folk singers used for this sort of material. The song may date from the American Civil War, but Peter, Paul and Mary had just had a US #35 hit with it as the superior B-side of Stewball. The thought process of the producers and label is revealed by putting the bubblegum One Way on the B-side. So you’re doing folk. They couldn’t find another folk song?\n\nIn 1963, the merger with Warner Bros took place, and Mo Ostin moved from being head of just Reprise to be head of the new Warner-Reprise combination. The new company was still not yet cool (that happened in 1967 after the Monterey Pop Festival).\n\nFRED GOODMAN: Even after the merger, both Warner and Reprise remained indifferent to changing tastes, and rock signings were a rarity. At the height of the British Invasion, The Kinks, signed to Reprise via a licensing deal with their English distributor, Pye Records, was the only successful band the labels signed out of the UK.\n\nFred Goodman, The Mansion on The Hill, 1997\n\nNANCY: When Reprise moved to Warner Brothers, Mo Ostin put me with producer Jimmy Bowen saying “This girl has had hit records all over the world. Let’s get her one here.” Jimmy’s roots were country and he didn’t quite know what to do with Sinatra’s daughter. We both tried hard to cut a commercial record. But though we did some interesting sides, like Cole Porter’s True Love with an ominous rhythm feel, we didn’t make magic.\n\nTrue Love was recorded in 1965. It’s the Cole Porter song which Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly performed in High Society. Richard Chamberlain (Dr Kildare) had just had a hit with it in 1963. Another oldie played right off the sheet music? Not at all, the backing is huge Phil Spector style, thudding away at the bottom with violins on top.\n\nNANCY: I love True Love because it was the first single that led me into another sound (and feel) and out of the bubblegum phase of my work, much more funk and a lot tougher sound. It was a perfect bridge to the work with Barton Lee Hazlewood.\n\nShe’s not singing high up either. It’s a splendid arrangement, produced by Jimmy Bowen, and as I’ll repeat so often, the very 1950s backing singers were the only mistake. She needed the funky girl group that she later found with The Blossoms. Jimmy Bowen had been a pop star himself, hitting US #14 with I’m Stickin’ With You in 1957 and selling a million. He moved into production with Reprise in the early 60s.\n\nNANCY: For some reason (my producers) Tutti Camarata and Don Costa chose to keep me upstairs in the highest possible keys (on my early recordings) and I think I sound squeaky up there struggling to sound like a soprano when I was already an alto. It was Jimmy Bowen who recognized this and moved me down for In The Wee Small Hours and True Love.\n\nGenerally, she’d covered well-known songs and by 1965, none of it was going anywhere much any more. Jimmy Bowen had contemplated getting Andrew Loog Oldham to come over and produce her, but Oldham was too busy with The Rolling Stones and Marianne Faithfull. Allegedly, Mo Ostin, his position at Warner-Reprise consolidated, was looking to drop non-selling acts, including her.\n\nIt’s surprising that such an LP-oriented label had never put out an album by her. There’s enough material on Bubblegum Girl Volumes 1 & 2, and several tracks which only emerged later were not singles or B-sides, such as In The Wee Small Hours, Like A Girl Like Me and Personality. Both Like A Girl Like Me and Personality have that teeny-bop bounce that was missing elsewhere. Personality is a good version of the Lloyd Price 1958 hit, but too many people had done it.\n\nA 1967 Japanese LP Golden Nancy Sinatra put her recent hits on Side one, and the early singles on side two for contrast (or shock, disappointment.)\n\nShe was doing better with movies as an actor, and on TV. She appeared in The Virginian TV series in 1963 with Doug McLure, in an episode called If You Have Tears.\n\nNancy sings in The Virginian – the song has never been released\n\nVIDEO LINK: IF YOU HAVE TEARS from The Virginian\n\nFor Those Who Think Young was a teen movie in 1964, starring James Darren, who later became godfather to her daughter.\n\nShe appeared in Get Yourself A College Girl in 1964 (aka The Swinging Set), where she met The Animals – decades later she duetted with Eric Burdon. No songs in the film.\n\nMarriage On The Rocks was in 1965, with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. It was being filmed as she was divorcing Tommy Sands.\n\nThe Ghost In The Invisible Bikini filmed in 1965 was part of the long “beach party” series. This one starred Boris Karloff. Nancy co-starred with Dean Martin’s daughter, Claudia Martin. They must both have had industry contacts somewhere. Nancy sang Geronimo in the movie.\n\nNancy Sinatra with the Bobby Fuller Four\n\nVIDEO LINK: GERONIMO FROM THE FILM\n\nShe was backed by the Bobby Fuller Four, best known for I Fought The Law. That one, Geronimo, rocks, almost approaching Lulu territory with vigorous male backing vocal, and the sound is beat group, unusually for her, and it works. It’s not a great song, it’s not even a good song, but it is a great combination. The background dancing is awful in the movie.\n\nIn The Oscar (1966) she briefly plays herself, and Frank Sinatra and Merle Oberon play themselves also.\n\nFilm and music were competing for her attention. Lee Hazlewood was talking after These Boots Are Made For Walking was a hit:\n\nLEE HAZLEWOOD: Well, the records are really only made to help along her film career. She’s completed several films recently, including one which is highly controversial – politically, socially and every way.\n\nMelody Maker, 30 April 1966\n\nMeanwhile… Enter Lee Hazlewood\n\nBarton Lee Hazlewood was held by some to be the initial Svengali. After Korean War service he worked as a DJ in Phoenix, met Duane Eddy and Al Casey and started his own record label, VIV. In 1956 he wrote and produced his own song, The Fool, finding Sanford Clark to sing it. It took him three weeks to get the voice how he wanted it, but said as studio time was $8 an hour he could keep trying. The drum beat is a Campbells soup box on a drum stool. Al Casey played the guitar part which is a lift from Smokestack Lightnin’. Lee went on and produced Duane Eddy, scoring a major hit when a DJ flipped Stalkin’ and played the B-side Rebel Rouser. They went to Jamie Records and he became Duane Eddy’s co-writer and producer for a long string of hits.\n\nListen to Duane Eddy’s Because They’re Young with the full string section behind the twangy guitar. That’s Lee Hazlewood’s cinematic sound. Already he was showing expertise in getting a fine sound … something that runs all the way through his recordings with Nancy Sinatra. He said later that when he booked a string section, he never booked violas … he wanted the highs of the violins and the depth of cellos and basses without interference in the middle.\n\nHis first solo album was Trouble Is A Lonesome Town in 1963, though he said he conceived of it as a set of demos, but it also had a concept of Trouble, a make-believe town. The original sleeve notes described it as “Americana” and that was back in 1963.\n\nWhen he was introduced to Nancy she was already twenty-five. He was eleven years older. He was comfortably off from Duane Eddy records and living in Hollywood in semi-retirement.\n\nLEE: I was disgusted that everything you heard on the radio was Beatles. Not only that, but they were hailed as innovators when they were doing things that were done four years earlier by the Everly Brothers. I enjoyed my eight months off. I sat in my back yard watching the bugs swim across my pool.\n\nAce records Biodata on Lee Hazlewood\n\nNancy had been trying to get her singing career under way for several years. Lee Hazlewood was already working with Reprise, with great success on Dean Martin’s cover of Lee’s song Houston. Reprise had him do his own album, The NSVIPs (The Not So Very Important People). They liked him.\n\nLee Hazlewood’s first Reprise album\n\nLee Hazlewood had been producing Dean Martin and Desi Arnez’s’s kids as Dino, Desi & Billy in 1965.\n\nLEE: I did Dino, Desi and Billy as a favour to [producer] Jimmy Bowen, knowing that working with two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old is gonna make you want to slit your wrists. These kids made one appearance on The Dean Martin Show, and they got 30 tons of mail, and I said that I really don’t want to do three million albums on them in that year I had them, and I had a royalty that was better than theirs, and still after all that profit margin I quit at the end of the first year. They were hell to work with. (Interview with Keiron Tyler, The artsdesk.com)\n\nHis work on Dino, Desi & Billy’s The Rebel Kind was impressive with grungy guitar and basic drumming so it might even just about sound as if the kids had played it themselves if you were gullible. On TV they used (or rather mimed with) a Rickenbacker guitar and a Hofner violin bass, just like The Beatles.\n\nThe trouble was the lyric, They call us the rebel kind.\n\nYou react, Oh, no they don’t. Not even in your wildest dreams.\n\nSo in July 1965 when Lee was invited to meet Nancy, he expressed understandable reluctance. He said he wasn’t doing any more “second generation” artistes. He described the meeting in a 2012 interview:\n\nLEE: Everybody knows I drink Chivas. When I walked in their house to meet with Nancy (she was living with her mom then), all along the walls, cleverly displayed, were all these bottles of Chivas lined up. And a bunch of my friends were there. It was Bobby Darin, a bunch more, and I’m thinking. Wait a minute, What is this? I haven’t seen these people in months.\n\nQ: So they threw a little party for you!\n\nLEE: In a way. We were getting along alright, cause Nancy and I, we never had any problems. Halfway through the evening her dad comes through the door and meets me. They go in the kitchen and they’re talking. He comes out, shakes my hand and says I’m glad you kids are going to be working together, and then walks out the door. I had only said that I’d come over and meet her!\n\n(Loserslounge.com, 2012)\n\nI guess with Frank, “No” was not an option. Nancy Sinatra said that Hazlewood played her the bass line of These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ on a guitar and sang it on that initial meeting in front of her and Frank Sinatra. Nancy thought it sounded aggressive and macho from a male singer, but realized how sexy it might be with a female singer.\n\nNANCY: Lee auditioned songs for me. I particularly liked a song he played that only had two verses and I asked him if he could write a third verse. He said, “It’s not really a girl’s song. I sing it myself onstage.” I told him that coming from a guy it was harsh and abusive, but was perfect for a little girl to sing. He agreed. When he left, my father, who had been sitting in the living room reading the paper, said, “The song about the boots is best.” (Los Angeles Magazine, 2016)\n\nWhen they decided to record it, they needed that third verse. Hazlewood said he composed it in the seven minute car ride from his house to hers.\n\nLee Hazlewood is credited with the full makeover. He told her to sing in a deeper voice, according to Nancy, six notes below her preferred register. (However see above – Jimmy Bowen had already done that on two songs).\n\nLEE: “She’d been singing up here like this,” he says, approximating Nancy’s erstwhile high-pitched, girly keening, “but I wanted her down here where I could hear her right. We lowered her singing about two keys. I made her sound like a tough little broad. I wanted her to sing like a 16-year-old girl who screwed truck drivers. “She said, ‘I can do that.'”(Daily Telegraph, 2004)\n\nThe Telegraph interviewed both of them separately in 2004 (in other interviews, Lee had said that he actually said 14 year old, not 16). The tale dates back to the rear sleeve of Boots where it says:\n\nHow should I sing this?\n\nLike a 16 year old girl that’s been dating a 40 year old man. But it’s all over now.\n\nAs with any anecdote told by two participants over decades, versions differ. I like Nancy’s version:\n\nNANCY: We were ready to do the overdubbing at United Recorders Studio B. I asked Lee how I should sing the songs. He said, ‘Like a fourteen-year-old girl in love with a forty-year-old man.’ I didn’t know what he was talking about. Lee and [engineer] Eddie [Brackett] fattened my voice with a tape reverberation technique – in essence the same principle used in the slap-back echo effect on Elvis’s voice on ‘Heartbreak Hotel’ – only much less. It worked fine except I was still singing like Nancy Nice Lady. Lee hit the talk-back switch in the booth and his deep voice blew my ears off. ‘For chrissake, you were a married woman, Nasty, you’re not a virgin anymore. Let’s do one for the truck drivers.’ This was shocking to a somewhat sheltered girl like Sinatra’s daughter. ‘Say something tough at the end of this one,’ Lee ordered. ‘Bite the words.’ I did. I bit.”\n\nIan Geary, who interviewed them wrote:\n\nIAN GEARY: Hazlewood recognised that there was too much Doris Day in Nancy and not enough Janis Joplin. Here was a girl, after all, who left college in the Sixties “to marry and have sex because I was raised Catholic and Italian”.\n\nListen back to The Cruel War. For the song, she is surprisingly deep, as she is on True Love, so maybe Lee Hazlewood wasn’t the only one who could imagine her singing lower.\n\nSome say Lee also suggested the “English style” clothes. But …\n\nLEE: She did it all herself, with those little mini skirts and those big boots, and you wouldn’t mind her walking all over you in them, cos she was so small. Each time I’d see her, she’d be a little more like that. Nancy knew what to do. She’s campy and all that stuff, but she’s always been smart.\n\nThe Observer, 13 June 1999, “The Return of Nancy’s Boy.” (Ouch!)\n\nNancy had been to Britain, met The Beatles, and has said ‘I was one of the first people to wear the Carnaby Street miniskirt in Hollywood.’\n\nNANCY: Milton (Greene) shot some iconic photos and for one, Amy (Greene) put me in a black and white outfit and I had on one black boot and one white boot. With the hair, the look caught on like wild fire. In between Amy, Kenneth, Rosemary and Mary Quant, who I had discovered early on when I was on a promotional tour in London, we created a wonderful look, although I don’t think I was given any credit for it. A little bit later, Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy, the girls of the ‘British Invasion’, got the credit for that look, but I always grin and think, “Oh yeah, I was there first.”\n\nThe Ingenue, Issue 1, 2015\n\nHazlewood was always a brilliant producer, and working with Nancy on her Dad’s label (even though now part of Warner, Frank retained that third) was an opportunity. If he asked for six cellos, no one was going to tell him to make do with three.\n\nThe third part of the equation was Billy Strange, as arranger, orchestra conductor and guitarist. Billy Strange was at Lee and Nancy’s initial meeting, along with Frank’s producer, Jimmy Bowen. Strange had played guitar for Phil Spector’s classic girl group recordings, then on Beach Boys sessions and had arranged for Duane Eddy (with Hazlewood producing). He continued working with Nancy Sinatra both on record and conducting her live shows for decades.\n\nThe Hazlewood / Sinatra combination had instant magic, not that they were ever in a relationship, nor did he work exclusively with her. Some of the songs had been cut before or would be cut after her version, either solo or demo-ed with his girlfriend, Suzi Jane Hokum. She worked with him at his LHI label as singer, writer, producer and graphic designer. The versions with Suzi Jane Hokum were released as MGM singles under just his name in Germany and Scandinavia at the time. For his MGM singles, he used the same arranger (Billy Strange), the same engineer (Eddie Brackett) and the same studio (United) as with Nancy Sinatra. But less elaborate orchestration.\n\nSuzi Jane Hokum has said that she co-wrote some of the major duet songs without credit.\n\nSUZI JANE HOKUM: (The MGM singles) were his “expensive demos.” I’m sure MGM thought that they would be successful.\n\nLater Lee recorded duets with Anne-Margaret and Anna Hanski. Although Lee was a prolific composer, Nancy was also too savvy to put all her eggs in one basket on her albums. The Lee Hazlewood songs tended to be the singles. In the 2004 interview she expanded on Lee as the Svengali:\n\nTEXT: Hazlewood certainly deserves credit for Sinatra’s transformation but he is often given all the credit for Nancy’s hits.\n\nNANCY: That’s a very interesting place to be. Lee’s songs had been recorded by Lee and someone else but they weren’t hits. I told him that a couple of years ago. I said, `Just face it, buddy, you didn’t have any hits before me and you didn’t have any hits after me so I must have brought something to the mix.‘\n\nTim Geary interview, Telegraph June 2004\n\nand …\n\nNANCY: Lee’s lyrics were the guiding light for us, because he wrote these wonderful fantasies. Billy (Strange) took them and put them to music. And what I did was follow along. The beauty of it was that I added enough to it to make it happen. Lee had done a lot of this stuff with other people, and he didn’t get anywhere with it. Lee’s muse in those days was Suzi Jane Hokom. Suzi Jane sang on all those duets. And he sang with Ann-Margret and several other ladies. But it just didn’t have the magic that Nancy and Lee had. So I told him in no uncertain terms over the years that he really owes me a lot, too. He wasn’t the Svengali that he thought he was. So it was a symbiotic relationship that turned out some pretty damned special music. I’m proud of all of it and proud of my contributions to it.\n\nThe Believer, 1st July 2014\n\nBOOTS\n\nThe rear sleeve expanded the title:\n\nNancy Sinatra Sings The Facts of Love\n\nTHESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING\n\nAnd Other Lessons in Love\n\nREVIEW, DISC WEEKLY\n\nNANCY’S BOOTS ON A BEATLES KICK\n\nImagine As Tears Go By at an almost bossa nova tempo, and Run For Your Life with the big band backing. These are the sort of refreshing treatments Nancy gives to songs by Jagger-Richards and Lennon-McCartney. Coupled with her neat performances of other songs that have been done before – like the pretty In My Room and Bob Dylan’s It Ain’t Me Babe – she proves that is IS possible to take old songs and give them new leases of life. With this LP, Nancy disproves any worries that she might have been a one-hit wonder. A good collection, brightly sung.\n\nRay Coleman, Disc Weekly 19 March 1966\n\nSo Long Babe was the initial single in October 1965, which is puzzling because the subsequent album name suggested the title track. So Long Babe is a good record. It has her new voice and style, it has the bass guitar / acoustic bass sound, and inhabits a jangling Jackie de Shannon / Byrds / Searchers vibe. I’m guessing they knew that it was good enough to chart (it did, US #86) but that they needed to stir up interest before launching the big one.\n\nNANCY: My first chart entry in the USA. A new sound, a new look. A new vocal approach. A little bit country and a lot of Hazlewood and Strange.\n\nThen in December 1965 they brought out These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ as her second song with him. It became Reprise’s first credible major rock hit.\n\nNancy insisted that Lee Hazlewood and the label’s choice, The City Never Sleeps At Night, should be flipped to put Boots on the A side.\n\nNANCY: Not to follow up ‘So Long, Babe’ with another entry that made the charts would have been suicidal in such a highly competitive business. I’d probably not get another shot as good. We recorded ‘The City Never Sleeps At Night.’ And the B-side was the song my dad liked, the one with two verses. Lee added a middle verse.\n\n(Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985)\n\nThey were right to avoid The City Never Sleeps At Night. While it has memorable horns and a kind of playground chant feel, it sounds early 60s. Lee Hazlewood thought it one of his best songs. Lee cut it again in 1966 in a semi-novelty version as The Shacklefords, with four vocalists including himself. This studio band was named after Lee’s first wife, Naomi Shackleford, and later included Glen Campbell. The expression The city that never sleeps at night was applied to New York. Coincidentally the words turned up in the 1977 lyric of New York New York by Liza Minelli, which Frank Sinatra covered in 1979.\n\nBILLY STRANGE: She said I’m gonna record that song, and Lee fought her tooth and nail, and he said ‘You don’t really want to record that!’ and she said, ‘I am going to record that song!’ And we recorded Boots. It was done in one take, bad notes and all. And it was the one song on the session that was a monster hit. She’s always right.\n\nThese Boots Are Made ForWalkin’: original UK Reprise single\n\nHazlewood expressed surprise that These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ never got banned, as in Oklahoma, where he came from, “Messin’” meant simply and unequivocally “fucking.” (You been messin’ where you shouldn’t’ve been messin’). He told Esquire how the idea came to him in 1999:\n\nLEE: I was sittin’ in this bar in southern Texas and there’s this fella in there who’s about 35, who had just married an 18-year-old girl. And they’re teasin’ him and tellin’ him his wife had called and he better get on home and all this kind of stuff. So we all had a few more drinks, and then he says I just wanna tell you guys somethin’. In my house, I’m boss, cause if I’m not the boss …  and he threw his foot up on one of the barstools … these boots are gonna walk all over her! I just said God almighty!\n\nThat start, with the long bass guitar run, then tambourine and then Hal Blaine and Jim Gordon on drums was the signature. The horns on These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ are held back until the second verse, and then take the fade out ending. Hazlewood used two basses. On that slide, it was Chuck Berghofer on double bass. Then it was Carol Kaye on electric bass guitar playing in unison with Chuck Berghofer on acoustic double bass to get the sound. The same effect was used on The Beach Boys Pet Sounds also with Carole Kaye and Chuck Berghofer, but note that Boots was recorded in 1965, while Pet Sounds sessions were early 1966. The Wrecking Crew were on both, and Billy Strange played guitar on both as well as arranging. Billy Strange claims the sliding bass run was his idea, but that contrasts with the story of Nancy first hearing Lee play the bass line. A sliding bass run was popular on guitar instrumentals, Lee’s previous forte, plus he had this to say in London in 1966:\n\nLEE: Really, I’m a record producer at heart. The idea for Boots” which was really written for a boy, came from an old jazz record of the ’20s. I can’t remember the title, and in fact the record was taken away by someone after I wrote “Boots.” A lot of people have said that the descension is a series of good notes, followed by bad, but this isn’t true. The bass part- it can only be played on a non-fretted instrument like the (double) bass – it uses quarter tones, and this has been used for a long time in jazz. To say that they are the wrong notes is just showing that the people don’t know what they are talking about.\n\nMelody Maker, UK, 30 April 1966\n\nLater he said:\n\nThere’s a guy called Chuck Berghofer, a bass player. I used Chuck all the time because Chuck worked at the jazz club that wasn’t too far from my house in Toluca Lake, LA. He’s a great jazz player, so I absolutely wanted him when it got to Boots. And it was no problem., Chuck wasn’t overworked.\n\nAs told to Wyndham Wallace, in Lee, Myself & I\n\nIt’s hard to believe anyone thought the bass part wrong, but … someone did …\n\nSTEVIE WINWOOD: It’s the record player. It sounds like a skiffle group. Good God! This has got to be a hit. I suppose it’s American – oh, dear. It’s terrible, it’s bad. I’ll remember that one. Hear that double bass run? Yeah, skiffle’s coming back. This is unbelievable. Either she’s bad or the band. I’m sure they’re all trying their best to make it bad. Who’s it by? Yeah? Must be (Frank) Sinatra on bass .\n\nMelody Maker, 15 January 1966\n\nIn Stevie’s defence, this was the era of Juke Box Jury and music papers found it amusing to play the week’s new releases to a star without giving any information. He was still only seventeen. But he did think it would be a hit. During the May 1966 visit of Nancy, Lee and Billy Strange to London, Melody Maker did the same to Alan Price, playing him Strangers In The Night by Frank Sinatra. His response is telling on her new status:\n\nALAN PRICE: Frank Sinatra? It may do something on the strength of his daughter’s publicity. MelodyMaker, 14 May 1966\n\n12 February 1966. #1 in the UK, Melody Maker\n\nBy early 1966, it was #1 in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, New Zealand as well as #3 in Italy. The LP sleeve introduced her “look” and she was stuck with one type of boots or another in photographs ever after. Nancy described the attitude in the song:\n\nNANCY: With Lee’s backing, Nancy Nicelady (Lee’s nickname for her) did, I guess, the first white girl version of what the black girls had been doing: a rebel kind of music. People like Ruth Brown and LaVerne Baker singing stuff like ‘Don’t give me any shit, man. Get lost! …I grew up listening to all of that.\n\n(Nancy Sinatra, The Guardian, 2008)\n\nLEE: People always used to ask her about the content of the songs, but she played dumb, ‘Lee writes ’em and I sing ’em. That’s the agreement.’ She was a smart walnut. DJs used to ring me up in disbelief at some of the lyrics. “How can you get away with that. It’s unbelievable! All these double and triple meanings! I don’t know how you can make Nancy sing that stuff! Does she know what she’s doing?’ I’d reply, ‘She knows exactly what she’s doing.’ She’s one of the few women artists who took one song and made an image out of it.\n\nShindig, July-August 2010\n\nJon Savage in “1966” sums it up:\n\nAn extraordinary mixture of Las Vegas and Los Angeles, of S&M fantasy and feminine revenge.\n\nThen David Hepworth in Nothing Is Real:\n\nTo hear musicians Carole Kaye and Al Casey talk about how they arrived at the backing sound … is to realize how much of a hit record’s emotional stickiness arises from the uniqueness of a particular performance. This in turn owes a huge amount to the idiosyncratic ear of a certain musician. Nancy Sinatra has performed that song thousands of times since that recording date but she hasn’t found anyone who can play the distinctive bass line like the combination of Chuck Berghofer on string bass and Carole Kaye on electric did on that day. “It’s very difficult to capture,” she says.\n\nOr Wyndham Wallace in his biography Lee, Myself and I:\n\nLike much great pop, it’s hard to know what separated it from the mass of music released every week to make it the success it became. It’s the kind of composition that often ends up slipping through the cracks – as had most of Nancy’s work until lee started working with her- but something about it captured the world’s imagination. Perhaps it was Nancy’s coquettish delivery and her easy-going feline charm. Possibly it was the lyrics which hinted at female emancipation in a manner blithe enough to disguise the song’s intent. Most likely it was the novelty of its bass line – performed on both upright and electric bass – which slid down a quarter tone at a time.\n\nSo Long Babe had sold 60,000. These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ sold six million. Those were the days before video promos, but Nancy filmed it for Color-Sonics, a then new video jukebox system.\n\nVIDEO LINK: COLOR-SONICS PROMO FILM\n\nLee was getting his feet under the table at Reprise, bringing over his old friend Duane Eddy for an album produced by Lee, The Biggest Twang of Them All with a guitar cover of Strangers in The Night plus This Guitar Was Made For Twangin’ which is a retitled instrumental cover, strangely credited on the record as written by Duane Eddy.\n\nWas the success appreciated?\n\nLEE: When ‘Boots’ was #1 in half the countries in the world, Nancy came over to my house, and she was crying. She said, ‘They didn’t pick up on my option at Reprise and they said I owed them $12,000.’ I said, ‘You’re kidding, we’ve got the biggest record in the world.’ I rang my lawyer in New York and I rang Nancy the next day and said, ‘How would you like $1 million? I’ve got three labels that are offering that for you right now and I can get something pretty good for myself as well.’ She talked to her father and he said she could write her own contract with Reprise – after all she was selling more records than him at the time.” (From 1000 UK Number One Hits)\n\nThe Boots album was stuffed with cover versions … As Tears Go By, Day Tripper, It Ain’t Me Babe, Run For Your Life, Lies, Flowers On The Wall, and most of them were recent too. I guess they were short of originals, but covering stuff that was still so warm from the charts was odd. Nancy Sinatra’s distinctive voice (courtesy of Hazlewood’s makeover) adds interest to covers, as does Hazlewood’s production. Given that Boots was a #1 US LP the songwriters must have been delighted that she’d covered them.\n\nIn Britain, with most of us too skint to buy LPs, it was common practice to divvy up an album onto four track EPs. Two EPs were issued from Boots: Run For Your Life and I Move Around. The first, Run For Your Life, aimed at the success of Beatles covers in the charts with Run For Your Life and added Bob Dylan’s It Ain’t Me Babe to increase its chances.\n\nUK EP: Run For Your Life, It Ain’t Me Babe, So Long Babe, Flowers On The Wall.\n\nThe second, I Move Around re-used the album sleeve picture and tried the other Beatles cover, Day Tripper with a touch of Jagger / Richard on As Tears Go By (plus I Move Around and In My Room).\n\nUK EP: I Move Around\n\nAs Tears Go By was the first Jagger / Richards composition after Andrew Loog Oldham locked them in a room until they wrote a song. Marianne Faithfull recorded it, and it was UK #9, US #6. We won’t go into the long contradictory arguments over whether it was written for her. The Rolling Stones recorded it themselves in 1965. This version starts out so well with guitar and voice, and a touch of bow on a bass. As the second verse starts, the guitarist (Billy Strange, I assume) suddenly thinks he’s playing Girl from Ipanema, and the bass and tinkling piano and drum come in and suddenly we’re into a swinging, sophisticated Latin American rhythm … samba, bossa nova, I can never remember the difference. The playing is immaculate, the singing beautifully pitched but somehow it takes the song away from its origins and places it in the corner of the cocktail lounge with an ageing quartet in white tuxedos on guitar, bass and drums (and piano, but it isn’t mic’d) and a much younger and more attractive female singer in a black cocktail frock trying to sing over the conversation.\n\nIt does allow a dramatic contrast to Day Tripper. Both Beatles songs, Day Tripper and Run For Your Life got strong arrangements and few bass players would dare add such a long bass run to a Paul McCartney part in the brass-heavy Day Tripper. The main riff is taken by trombones. The horns seem to comment on the words behind her. It’s in my playlist of best Beatles covers. She adds ‘One nighter’ at the end.\n\nI Move Around is a Lee Hazlewood song with Nancy’s tough chick swagger. The central narrative voice works. I would have cut the backing vocalists, or rather changed them for soul chicks. The instrumental section is fabulous.\n\nOne I have heard most is It Ain’t Me Babe, because I have so many Dylan covers in playlists. It’s disconcerting hearing such a big arrangement, with stabbing horns, and cooing backing vocals compared to the sparse original, but it works. Her warm voiced delivery is mixed close up to the listener and is captivating.\n\nThen comes These Boots Are Made For Walking.\n\nIn My Room is not the Brian Wilson song, but an English version of El Amor. Both Verdelle Smith and Connie Stevens released versions in January 1966. Nancy did it in February, quickly followed by Julie Rogers, then by The Walker Brothers who went along with Nancy’s epic treatment. Nice touch of Hammond organ to open it and throughout.\n\nLies had been a recent #20 hit for The Knickerbockers, who did such an extremely Beatlesque version that some thought it the Fab Four. Nancy stayed deep and added a treble girl group backing.\n\nSo Long Babe is placed next.\n\nFlowers On The Wall is another with a long and gorgeous bass run … their signature on three tracks. It had been a #4 hit (country #2) for The Statler Brothers almost as they were recording Boots (though it had been released nine months earlier). It’s one of those songs that’s horribly catchy.\n\nIf He’d Love Me was written by Mirriam Eddy (aka Jessi Colter later), then married to Duane Eddy, so Lee’s old pals. A good song, more conventional mid-60s popular. It could have been a hit … the heavy background percussion is Spector-ish. Nice whispering from Nancy at the end.\n\nHer version of Run For Your Life wasn’t a single, but was a radio hit on the US East Coast. Another notable Beatles cover. She uses the girl group backing with her.\n\nCD REISSUE BONUS TRACKS:\n\nThe City Never Sleeps At Night is a bonus track on the CD reissue. See earlier.\n\nIn Our Time / Leave My Dog Alone was a single released in 1966. Both sides appear as bonus tracks on the Boots CD reissue. iTunes has the bonus tracks on downloads of the album. In Our Time has the jangly folk rock guitar of The Byrds coupled with the crunchiest reverberant bass guitar sound. Whenever you hear a 12 string guitar among the Wreckin’ Crew, it will be Glen Campbell. It has a protest song declamatory style of delivery too, though like Life’s A Trippy Thing it’s from the opposite viewpoint. Lee Hazlewood wrote it.\n\nHere’s Lee thinking he can go shaggy head to shaggy head with the hippie rockers—and he’s right. This is a righteous Beatles homage/rip (note “Day Tripper” riff), replete with faux-psych-pop lyrical babble …\n\nDave Segal, The Stranger, Lee Hazlewood’s Ten Best Songs, 11 September 2015\n\nGirls were once suffragettes\n\nNow they’re out takin’ bets\n\nSmokin’ filter cigarettes …\n\nHoldin’ hands in the Louvre\n\nUsed to be such a groove\n\nNow some take trips and never move\n\nLeave My Dog Alone is a concoction that approaches Bonzo Dog instrumentation, tuba, bells and distort guitar, which are much more interesting than the lyric.\n\nThe final bonus track is the mono 45 single mix of These BootsAre Made For Walkin’.\n\nHOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU?\n\nThey went straight into a second album, How Does That Grab You with brown boots and a chunky short sweater dress on the cover. Hold on, that was on the rear of Boots, the album before. As an album, I find it more satisfying than its predecessor.\n\nIt opens so softly right away with just acoustic bass and voice on Not The Loving Kind. Then a touch of gentle guitar. I assume Chuck Berghofer and Billy Strange. It was a Lee Hazlewood song that he’d cut with Dino, Desi & Billy in 1965, then it was all chiming Rickenbacker, sounding like The Searchers and a US #25 hit. It couldn’t have been done more differently than the trio rethink with Nancy. To me that’s the way to do a cover version: it’s like changing a familiar Herman’s Hermits’ hit into a Peggy Lee torch song. Lee Hazlewood must surely have thought of the lyric as for a mature woman, not a boy band.\n\nThe album, as with Boots, was padded out with more cover versions … Call Me (Petula Clark), The Shadow Of Your Smile (from the 1965 filmThe Sandpiper), Let It Be Me (Everly Brothers), Crying Time (Buck Owens), Time (Pozo-Seco Singers). The covers show versatility … from Latin on Shadow of Your Smile, to country & western cover on Cryin’ Time. Lee was later asked about the number of cover versions and said Some were favours for friends.\n\nThen we have a straight twelve bar blues with massed trombones on Baby Cried All Night Long … she ends with ‘the moral of this story is you just shouldn’t be caught messin’ where you shouldn’t be messin’ or you’ll end up cryin’ all night long …. Another Lee Hazlewood song. I’d assumed they’d added the ending because of the success of Boots, but it’s on Lee’s earlier solo version too which was recorded in December 1965.\n\nLet it Be Me starts out with just voice with deep bowed double basses which impress and make a change, and gentle guitar. I enjoy the first verse so much, I’m annoyed when the snare rim (again) and chorus arrives. The bits in French are showing off but at least we’re back to bowed bass and acoustic guitar. The song is best-known from The Everly Brothers (US #7, UK #13, 1960). Wiki points out that the Betty Everett / Jerry Butler version in 1964 charted higher (US #5, R&B #1). OK, but 99% will identify it with The Everlys first, due to so many compilation LPs. So many people have covered it. It’s a French song by Gilbert Becaud (Je t’appartiens).\n\nCall Me written by Tony Hatch has an understated European café sound. There had been two recent significant versions, Petula Clark on album and EP in 1965, then Chris Montez covered it (US Easy Listening #2). Then everyone covered it in 1965-1966 … Jackie de Shannon, Lulu, Nancy Wilson, Brenda Lee, Sarah Vaughan, Astrud Gilberto. It’s so familiar that I had to check – neither Petula Clark nor Chris Montez had a UK hit. Frank Sinatra covered the song as well on Strangers In The Night, the same year, with a quite different Nelson Riddle arrangement. Frank’s solo version was also the B-side of Somethin’ Stupid. Nancy’s version has the Latin sound, though for me Astrud Gilberto edges it and would be my chosen version.\n\nThey followed up the success of These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ with How Does That Grab You Darlin’ (US #7, UK #19) in April 1966. It had a similar bass and drum rhythm track to These Boots Are Made For Walkin’. It has a nice guitar figure, stellar horns. Most of all, it continued that tough girl image. She sings to her ‘Tom Cat’ boyfriend, saying that she’s on the prowl too. As Lee Hazlewood has expressed pride in getting away with “salty” lyrics, I wonder about:\n\nI’m gonna go out and prowl\n\nDon’t come lookin’ for your pussy cat …\n\nAs she addresses the boyfriend as Tom Cat, I wondered if Hazlewood had intended a comma after ‘pussy’ and a capital C for ‘cat.’ She finishes with a long Grrrr … before the horns take it away. Red Rhodes played the dobro part.\n\nDisc & Music Echo, UK, 14 May 1966\n\nJim Reid of Jesus and Mary Chain said of How Does It Grab You, Darling?:\n\nJIM REID: Lee Hazelwood produced this and wrote most of the songs and the little blurb-y parts like that (from back cover: “Grab us good says all the people. Lovely tunes and marvy melodies. All of them gravid with meaning. All of them like to mess your head forevermore”). It’s like something out of Clockwork Orange! The idea appeals to me that Nancy Sinatra was totally mainstream pop music, but the lyrics to some of these songs . . . I like the idea that they can be taken on loads of different levels. The very fact that this stuff could appeal to me and appeal to whoever must have put that record at Number 5 in the American charts or whatever is astonishing. It seems like there’s a revival of Nancy.\n\nQ Interview, 1994. April Skies, The Jesus & Mary Chain fan site\n\nSorry ‘Bout That sounds even more like These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ with semi-spoken additions, and to my amazement was written by Baker Knight rather than Lee Hazelwood, and Baker Knight had recorded it himself in late 1966, produced by Jimmy Bowen, Frank’s producer. Knight also wrote Somewhere There’s A Someone, a major hit for Dean Martin (these guys all knew each other!) Sorry ‘Bout That was perhaps a too obvious follow up to Boots. I suspect it was composed as a deliberate attempt to flog it to Nancy as a follow-up, but Pye issued it as the title track of an EP in Britain, which also included Bang Bang. Listening to both side by side, it may have fared better in the charts, being so similar to Boots.\n\nSorry ‘Bout That, UK EP 1966. Reprise.\n\nTime is credited to Michael Merchant and Lee Hazlewood, it’s a soft shuffling number, and the folk singer Michael Merchant was the sole source, given that it was a hit for the Pozo-Seco Singers in April 1966 (US #47, Easy Listening #3) with Susan Taylor as lead singer. They had recorded it in late 1964 and it had been a regional hit around San Antonio before Columbia took it for national release. The arrangement of Nancy’s version is very close to the Pozo-Seco record. It relies on guitar, simple bass and tapping on the snare rim. None of the orchestration though you do get a sizeable chorus behind her, but the Pozo-Seco record has the backing vocals too.\n\nThe Shadow of Your Smile has a similar arrangement.The same rhythm guitar, drum tap, the same cooing chorus, but horns are added.\n\nIn retrospect, the best known song on How Does That Grab You is Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) a cover of a then recent Cher hit, enlivened by Billy Strange’s stellar solo work on guitar. That’s all there is, her voice, his guitar.\n\nNANCY: My recording of ‘Bang Bang,’ like so many of the others that really struck a chord with people, was a stick-on after an album session. Maybe Sonny Bono’s best song. My choice to change it from Cher’s version created a melancholy ballad. Billy Strange made it work with his haunting guitar.\n\nBILLY STRANGE: I had a wah-wah pedal which was a vibrato thing. It’s got the deepest bass quality you ever heard … and it made just the right sound for the particular piece.\n\nNancy Sinatra’s sparse version was re-used by Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill Volume1 in 2003. The minimalism makes it colder as befits a Tarantino film. The precise vocal phrasing is perfectly complemented by the guitar. If I only wanted one version I’d probably go for Cher, but it’s a Sophie’s Choice, and the Nancy Sinatra unexpected stripped down version is intoxicating.\n\nNANCY: Picking the cover versions for the album was a team effort with Lee Hazlewood and Billy Strange and myself. I was the one who came up with the reinterpretation of some of the rock things, like Cher’s ‘Bang Bang.’ That was me. I saw the lyrics differently, they just read like poetry.”\n\nFollowing on from Bang Bang, she always did one song in live concerts with just her vocal and Billy Strange’s guitar.\n\nNancy Sinatra’s rendering is considerably more grim (than Cher), slipping into the storytelling with a relish, as she seems to lick each note with a sobering smirk. Ripped off her How Does That Grab You? album, “Bang Bang” is heaved into the ground, and Sinatra’s voice moves at a snail’s pace, intentionally making the listener’s skin crawl as a result. It comes in waves, as the story unravels, and while it could be perceived as a murderous, southern-gothic tale of revenge, it’s simply about heartbreak. (Sonny) Bono crafted a story that begins with two kids, who play cowboys and indians, and as they grow older, they fall for each other and get married. But the honeymoon phase wears off pretty abruptly, and the narrator’s lover runs away off into the sunset for a journey no one will ever know or fully understand. “Now he’s gone I don’t know why / Until this days sometimes I cry / He didn’t even say goodbye / He didn’t take the time to lie,” Sinatra sings, musician Billy Strange’s tremolo guitar quivering with angst and misery in much the same way a ghost haunts its former life.\n\nJason Scott, B-Sides and Badlands, August 2018\n\nSand. Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood on the label at last and it’s a B-side\n\nMy choice from the album is Sand, because we now have Lee Hazlewood joining Nancy to duet, creating their future very successful template. When you think of great male / female duet teams, Nancy and Lee are surely up there with the best: Bobbie Gentry & Glen Campbell, Otis Redding & Carla Thomas, Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell, Leonard Cohen and Jennifer Warnes.\n\nLee described the beginning of the duets:\n\n‘I’d written some Boy / Girl songs,’ he checks I realize he’s being sarcastic before continuing, ‘I had a couple or three of them lying around. I just used to sing the songs to her. ‘I like that one. No not that one.’ OK, forget it. ‘No, I want to do that one too.’ Thats the way she was. So we hunted around for people to sing with her, and she just said, ‘Stop it. If anybody sings with me, it’s got to be you, because they won’t sound right. ‘Cos if I’m gonna do these songs, I do them with you. ‘Cos I’ll be unhappy if I don’t hear that old whisky voice.’\n\nAs told to Wyndham Wallace, in Lee, Myself & I\n\nSand wasn’t released as a single until later in 1967, and then was a B-side to Lady Bird which was also by Nancy and Lee. The jangling acoustic guitar introduces a Western movie theme. They’d discovered the contrast in their voices. Lee was fond of the image of a gnarled drifter and a younger woman, a recurring theme. Nancy Sinatra was the perfect foil for the theme.\n\nThe lyrics are full of thee and thy and the ‘young woman’ addresses the ‘wandering man’ as sir, as if they were Amish or if it were the 18thcentury.\n\nOh sir, my fire is very small\n\nIt will not warm thy heart at all\n\nBut thee may not take me by the hand\n\nHold me, and I’ll call thee Sand.\n\nSorry, years of English teaching … line 3 should be but thou may not … and Word’s grammar checker spots that too, but whatever her fire starts to burn hotter and hotter. The sexpot image was maintained.\n\nLEE: Sand is my favourite. Nancy liked that song first time she heard it. Sand was very filthy and Biblical at the same time.\n\nShindig, July-August 2010\n\nThe guitar solo was outstanding, but weird, and was played by Glen Campbell. Sand holds the psychedelic distinction of being the first record to feature backwards recorded guitar, predating The Beatles’ Rain. Sand had been recorded on March 8, 1966; Rain was recorded on April 14 and 16, 1966.\n\nNANCY: Sand,’ the very first Nancy & Lee recording, is my favourite of all my duets with Lee. Everybody likes the song ‘Sand.’ I think it’s a real fantasy/fairy tale kind of recording. A lot of that was Billy Strange’s arrangement. The combination of talents painted pictures that drew you in, absorbed you. You could bring your own experience to it, or you could take the song into your own relationship and act accordingly. ‘Sand’ was Lee’s ‘Norwegian Wood.’ That weird sound is a guitar that was recorded frontwards and then played backwards to try to copy a sitar which we couldn’t find at the time.\n\nThe cover on the Total Lee! tribute album was by Calvin Johnson and Mark Pickerel which loses the gender interplay, but adds interesting horns.\n\nLEE: They wouldn’t sing it Biblical, would they? I used “thee” on purpose.\n\nsleeve notes, Total Lee!, 2002\n\nThe CD reissue added Lightnin’s Girl, and The Last of The Secret Agents. This was the theme song for the comedy spy movie The Last of The Secret Agents in which Nancy played Micheline and sang the title track. That was written by Lee Hazlewood, and in keeping with the tone of the movie, it opens as pure pastiche dramatic James Bond, but references her biggest hit with the throbbing Boots-style bass part. She sings it with remarkable conviction given the humorous lyrics.\n\nHe’s never caught one spy, I’m told\n\nHe’s never even caught a cold\n\nGot his degree from Disneyland\n\nBut he’s the last of the secret agents,\n\nAnd he’s my man\n\nNancy described how Bacharach and David had written a song for her in the movie, Papa Leo’s Place, but the film was running over-budget and out of time, so they scrapped the idea. Then she was at #1 with Boots just as the film was about to come out, so Lee Hazlewood hastened to write a song, and Lee and Billy Strange deliberately did it as a James Bond spoof and put it over the titles.\n\nItalian poster for “The Wild Angels” – her popularity in Italy meant a special Italian poster putting her in the centre.\n\nIn 1966 she also co-starred in the Roger Corman movie the Wild Angels with Peter Fonda, which was his inspiration to go on and do Easy Rider. Surprisingly, she’s not on the soundtrack. I found one the other day and was about to buy it until I turned it over and read the credits.\n\nNANCY IN LONDON\n\nUK LP\n\nThey were off to Britain in 1966 for Nancy in London, one of the batch of Reprise albums reissued properly on CD with bonus tracks and notes by Sundazed in 1995. The rear sleeve notes that Friday’s Child leads off an exciting new album … It leads from the position of track six on side two, which I would call “finishes off an exciting album …”\n\nWhile Hazlewood produced, Billy Strange arranged at Pye Studios at Marble Arch. Due to British Musician’s Union rules, Strange wasn’t allowed to conduct, so Johnny Harris took over. Eddie Brackett was their long-time engineer. Lee Hazlewood wrote The Pope’s Daughter: His Fantasy Life With Nancy and Other Sinatras in 2002, and it’s written in a Spike Milligan / John Lennon absurd style and states ‘This is a work of fiction.’ Nevertheless the comic absurdity covers the same events as real life.\n\n“This is a good recording studio?” repeating echoed Eddie B, sterling engineer.\n\n“That sounded like a question.”|\n\n“It Was.”\n\nThe Pope’s Daughter: His Fantasy Life With Nancy and Other Sinatras\n\nI’ll take that as a comment. Pye distributed Reprise in Britain. Pye Studios was in the basement of its owners offices, ATV, in an ugly 50s building. There are iconic studios which draw artistes to record there, but Pye wasn’t one of them. The Kinks hits were done there, but in later years a lot of ultra-budget covers records were done there too. I’ve never seen Pye studios mentioned with affection. She’s pictured on a London red bus with her booted foot prominent.\n\nSo why were they in London? The 1995 sleeve notes by Nancy suggest they were there to record the James Bond theme You Only Live Twice with John Barry conducting the 80 piece London Philharmonic. That carried over to the album where she describes her youthful Wrecking Crew American backing musicians, and contrasts them:\n\nNANCY: Recording in London was definitely a different experience\n\nthan recording in America. First of all, because the guys in America were my age and younger. On BOOTS you know, we had Jimmy Gordon on the drums, he was like a baby; and Chuck Berghofer on bass. Donnie Owens and Al Casey on acoustic guitars, and we had kind of a young trombone section, you know. It was just a youthful kind of a look. When you walked into the studio in London there were guys with grey beards and white hair and it was a little scary, a little intimidating to be recording in London with these wonderful, experienced London Philharmonic-type musicians. And me with my little bitty voice. (sleeve note to Nancy in London Sundazed reissue)\n\nRecording in Britain had become a well-trodden route in the wake of The Beatles, led by The Everly Brothers Two Yanks in England. Brenda Lee did an album in 1964. Del Shannon did Home And Away with Andrew Loog Oldham in 1967 although it wasn’t released for decades. Tommy Roe recorded in the UK. Bobby Vee recorded The New Sound From England but did it with Snuff Garrett in America. Usually the point was using British producers and session men, and most often going for British songwriters – both Brenda Lee and Bobby Vee had a go at She Loves You. But Nancy was in London with Lee Hazlewood and Billy Strange and some of the songs such as Hutchinson Jail were country. There are no British songwriters on there either, though when it was issued on CD in 1996 John Barry’s You Only Live Twice was a bonus cut. You have to wonder what the point of doing it in London was.\n\nFor the third time, we have covers … On Broadway, Wishin’ and Hopin’, The More I See You. Lee Hazlewood was possibly restricting the flow of his own compositions (or was diffident) and she had not yet found another songwriter to provide her with new original material. It would be a long time before Mac Davis took on that role.\n\nOn Broadway was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, and in its best and most famous version recorded for The Drifters, adapted and produced by Leiber & Stoller. (US #9, R&B #7) in 1963. In my memory it was a major UK hit and I pride myself on spotting it and Up On The Roof on release, but not so according to the chart books. It’s such a marvellous song, that a cover four years on was a reasonable idea. A powerful vocal and instrumental backing. Who booked her backing singers? A perennial issue. These guys are not up to The Drifters.\n\nThe End is a cover of the 1958 Earl Grant song, not The Doors psychotic Oedipal drama. That would have been a fascinating combination. Nancy’s version has had a later life in adverts. It’s very late 50s pop, yet has such a huge orchestra and massive chorus over her semi-spoken early verses.\n\nThe next song Step Aside is country and western. It’s credited to Tommy Jennings, brother of Waylon Jennings. It was recorded by Lee Hazlewood’s first discovery, Sanford Clark in 1966 as the B-side to a re-recording of his first hit, The Fool written by Hazlewood. The guitarists on the Sanford Clark session were Al Casey, who played on the original 1956 version, and Waylon Jennings. If this hadn’t been recorded in London, no doubt Al Casey would have played on Nancy’s version too. Waylon went on to record the song himself, in a very Johnny Cash’ stripped down style. I assume Lee sourced the song, and he must have decided to push the song in two directions. Nancy’s version is more elaborate than either Sanford Clark or Waylon Jennings, and while the piano and country bass line sound country, the horns are not a country item.\n\nI Can’t Grow Peaches On A Cherry Tree is folky. It had been a recent American hit by Just Us, a duo which consisted of Chip Taylor and Al Gorgioni. (US #34, Adult Contemporary #3 in 1966). It gave its title to their album. It’s credited to E. Levitt-C. Monde. Chip Taylor was a major songwriter himself. Good song. As expected, Nancy’s version has the orchestral arrangement, but retains its folky lilting melody.\n\nShe makes an excellent job of Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s Wishin’ and Hopin’ and it suits her voice, but my first choice would be Ani di Franco and my second Dusty Springfield for this song. Dionne Warwick had been the first to record it in 1963. Nancy Sinatra has some of the clipped delivery which Ani di Franco used in her later bare, stripped back version for My Best Friend’s Wedding in 1995. This Nancy take on the song is big and dramatic and she goes for rapid after the solo. Dusty Springfield did it in 1964, and scored a US #6 hit, but it was held back in the UK because Dusty was already #3 with I Just Don’t Know What To With Myself. So The Merseybeats covered her version and went to #13. She remained identified with the song in the UK, performing it on TV with The Merseybeats at the time. A good cover of a well-known song is usually a good idea on an album, but what did they expect to gain from doing it?\n\nThe best track of all is Summer Wine … the last track on side one … which wasn’t released as a single until it became the B-side of Sugar Town. See below.\n\nThis Little Bird was a John D. Loudermilk song which had been covered in 1965 by The Nashville Teens (UK #38), then by Marianne Faithfull (UK #6 in May, US #32 in July), so there was a British hit connection, and her second Marianne Faithfull cover after As Tears Go By on Boots. Nancy’s version was issued as a single in Japan two years later and was a #15 Japanese hit in January 1969.\n\nShades is the first Lee Hazlewood to appear on the LP, and as soon as you hear the orchestra at the start and then the loping pace and the deep voice, you know it. Fabulous. Shades was also recorded by Lee Hazlewood solo (arranged by Billy Strange) in August 1966, and was slated to appear on his aborted 1967 album for MGM, Something Special. It was shifted to his LHI album in 1967, Lee Hazlewood Presents the 98% American Mom & Apple Pie 1929 Crash Band, and every track on that was a solo version of a Nancy Sinatra hit, except for Houston.\n\nThe More I See You was another major hit to be covered. It was an older song than I thought … 1945. Like many, I met it it with Chris Montez’s 1966 UK #3 hit. Montez had recorded Call Me which Nancy had covered on her previous album. It was on the same MoR album The More I See You. For me, Chris Montez is Let’s Dance and I never liked his shift to this sort of material. Nancy does it with vibes and horns and soars above it. I never liked the song though.\n\nHutchinson Jail is Lee Hazlewood, with the cowboy in the cold, cold, cold jail after being accused of shooting a man. Nancy sings “I got a man in Wichita and a man in Saginaw” and I thought she meant she’d shot some people there too, but then she adds “They both ain’t heard from me in some time.” Then I realised by “got a man” she meant “a male friend or partner.” It was transparent when Lee had sung “I got a wife in Wichita and a girl in Saginaw.” Lee had recorded it in 1966 solo with simpler backing. He’d told her Boots wasn’t a girls song. This definitely isn’t, but then folk tradition is to ignore the gender of a narrator within a song. Bows on the bass (es). There is a town of Hutchinson in Kansas, not too far from Wichita.\n\nThe first single from Nancy in Londonwas Lee Hazlewood’s Friday’s Child (US #36 . It had been the title track of Hazlewood’s solo LP for Reprise in 1965, before working with Nancy. It had not set the world on fire. There’s Nancy singing on her own, a 30 piece orchestra, nice crisp chanting chorus. Britain had some good backing vocalists and these sound like rock backing vocalists rather than the Anita Kerr-style choir used on her American recordings. The most memorable thing is the blues lead guitar solo running all over the song. So if it was recorded in London, it’s not Hazlewood’s regular studio team. So who is the lead guitarist? The blues obsession guitar sounds British to me (Answers on a postcard to …). I’d like to think it was a pimply young British ace, but Billy Strange was there arranging and conducting and is a guitarist with such a wide range that I suspect it’s him. The drums also sound great, just dragging the beat a tad. It doesn’t sound “British session man” to me, but it might be.\n\nLee Hazlewood again for 100 Years. It’s like he wanted a suite of three compositions together to end the second side. As expected, after a dramatic faux-classical piano opening, there’s a marvellous bass guitar sound on 100 Years and it’s not the usual Kaye / Berghofer sound either. So were they all British session players? If so, they do a brilliant job of sounding country. 100 Years was a subsequent single.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nThe CD reissue has both sides of the single, You Only Live Twice ad Tony Rome plus Life’s A Trippy Thing which has its own section below.\n\nSUMMER WINE / SUGAR TOWN\n\nSummer Wine- my original copy of my first choice of all. Note discrete Lee credit.\n\nIn January 1967, they released the advance single from the Sugar album, which was Sugar Town, coupled with her and Lee Hazlewood on Summer Wine from Nancy in London. I’m choosing both sides in my ten, not that Lee would approve:\n\nThe B-side of ‘Sugar Town’, a frisky duet with Hazlewood ‘Summer Wine’, started to pick up airplay in 1967, igniting a demand for further Nancy and Lee duets. “Then you know you want to slit your wrists because they played ‘Sugar Town’ for three months, it sold about a million and a half,” Hazlewood confessed. “Then they turned it over and it sold another half a million with that on the other side. So what I did is give them a $2 record for a dollar. That hurts your producer ‘s mind, and it hurts your publishing mind and it hurts your writer’s mind and your performer’s mind. No, the performance worked out fine, but all that other stuff you gave it awfully. You gave a two-sided hit. And I don’t believe in two-sided hits. So that’s how my wonderful singing career began.”\n\nIan Johnston Soundlab\n\nLee Hazlewood had just founded his own label, LHI Records, and signed The International Submarine Band with Gram Parsons, though that was at the prompting of Suzi Jane Hokum, who produced them. Their album Safe At Home pre-dates Sweetheart of The Rodeo’s claim as the first country rock album. So Hazlewood wasn’t unaware of the mood of the year on the West Coast. (And it was Hazlewood who took legal action and had Parsons voice removed from some tracks on Sweetheart of The Rodeo.)\n\nSugar Town is, on the surface at least, unusually pop for Hazlewood, both in tune and lyrics. It’s jaunty, laid back and cheerful. Nancy takes it on her own. It stands out as at odds with the Sugar album. It was a hit (US #5, UK #8). Lee Hazlewood later claimed it was full of double entendre which “the kids” would get. OK, but I never did. On the 1997 CD reissue, Nancy Sinatra was explicit:\n\nNANCY: It was hard to put any other songs with Sugar Town. It was basically LSD, but it was not publicized as such. It was Lee’s Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. It went against my image, which made it tough to choose the other songs for the same collection.\n\n(Sleeve notes to Sugar CD 1997).\n\nSo the laid back, whoozy gentle feel refers to sugar lumps with LSD, in the sense of Smoke’s My Friend Jack Eats Sugar Lumps.\n\nLEE: Sugar Town was an LSD song if ever there was one. I was in a folk club one night and saw some kids with an eyedropper putting LSD on sugar cubes. That’s what I meant by ‘Just lay back and laugh at the sun’. One columnist called Walter Winchell, the New York critic who invented the gossip column, said it was the dumbest lyric he ever heard. Reprise didn’t believe in that record at all but it went Top Ten. But I never took LSD myself. I’ve never had much dope, period.\n\nShindig interview, July-August 2010\n\nSummer Wine is a duet, and right into the favoured Western Movie scenario again … I’m sure that was the intention of his male original idea for These Boots Are Made For Walkin’. Hazlewood’s character walks into town:\n\nI walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too\n\nA song that I had only sung to just a few\n\nShe saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time\n\nAnd I will give to you summer wine\n\nThis is also leaning towards Some Velvet Morning stoned (whether alcohol or drugs) aspect:\n\nMy eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak\n\nI tried to get up but I couldn’t find my feet\n\nShe reassured me with an unfamiliar line\n\nAnd then she gave to me more summer wine\n\nThe story is an old one (compare New York Girls) for when he does wake, his silver spurs have gone, along with a dollar and a dime. The orchestration is extraordinary, sitting on a simple tap from Hal Baine, and a repetitive bass line. The urgent strings soar higher and ever stronger above her sultry siren voice. The horns towards the end are James Bond movie style. If you listen to her phrasing, the way tiny pauses, or stretched words are used, you can see that she inherited magic vocal timing from her dad.\n\nNANCY (on Summer Wine): A running theme in his songs … was the young girl with the older guy.That was his fantasy and he captured it beautifully in song. … With me, he took the little girl quality and put it with adult ideas and something very interesting happened.\n\nYou have to wonder why such a strong song (it was my first choice of all) was a B side in the first place. However, Hazlewood had some contractual arguments with MGM over recording as an artist with Nancy in 1967, so may have held it back – and the B-side still earns the same money. The original Sugar LP says Lee Hazlewood sings on Summer Wine courtesy of MGM Records.\n\nIn 2002 the Lee Hazlewood tribute album Total Lee! covered several Lee and Nancy songs, including Summer Wine by Evan Dando and Sabrina Brooke. They had Lee listen through and comment for the sleeve notes.\n\nLEE: She (Sabrina Brooke) sings ‘strawberry’ just like Nancy says it. It’s scary. The original was cut in London. It was at the time when 007 was big. Billy Strange wrote that brass line in, and said ‘Please don’t take that out!’ so I never did.\n\nSUGAR\n\nSugar was the February 1967 album, based around Sugar Town.\n\nNANCY: (Sugar Town was) Barton Lee Hazlewood’s homage to LSD. I don’t like performing this song but it’s an audience favourite so I have them sing it! It was difficult to build an album around it so we went with some Dixieland Jazz. The best thing about the album was the cover.\n\nThe cover photo got it banned in some places, and making it fuzzier doesn’t help much.\n\nThat was four albums in a year and it shows in the track selection. Anyone for Sweet Georgia Brown? Oh, You Beautiful Doll, Let’s Fall in Love? Hard Hearted Hannah? On the cover there’s no sign of boots and she’s back to California in a pink bikini. The back sleeve added “sings Sugar Town and sweet soulful serenades from the old timey years.” Mostly it sounds 1920s and virtually all of it is. You could say “Songs of the 1920s plus a couple.”\n\nThe CD reissue adds two contemporary singles, Love Eyes and Something Stupid. On the rear sleeve, Lee writes “What Is Nancy Sinatra?” including:\n\nShe’s so square she can get high on a glass of water.\n\nShe’s so hip that she can make you believe she’s high on a glass of water.\n\nOn line this quote turns up again and again. I don’t know which songs she meant.\n\nNANCY: I was successful with mediocre material because of a good recording voice that people really liked at that time.\n\nIt’s puzzling. It’s not so much mediocre material, they’re all classic melodies and lyrics, so much as material that was misguided just as her career was taking off so well. Nowadays we’d call some of it Great American Songbook, a category dominated by her father; some Dixieland (as she does). What possessed them to record this stuff at that time though? It’s a specific genre, and if I’d bought this album on release (my secondhand copy is much later) I’d have returned it to the shop as so far from what I expected. They do it very well and a few years ago I discovered The Beautiful Old with such retro songs which has helped me appreciate this better.\n\nThe LP sleeve lists the crew which was unusual for mainstream chart in those days … including Al Casey, Glen Campbell, Jimmy Helms & James Burton on guitars, Don Randi and Larry Knechtel on pianos, Carol Kaye and Chuck Berghofer on basses, Jeff Porcaro on percussion, Hal Blaine and Jim Gordon on drums. Five trumpets. Four trombones.\n\nFull credits were unusual for the era\n\nNANCY: I think we blew it on a couple of tracks, like What’ll I Do (I call that the duck song, Waddle I Do) and My Buddy should have stayed.in three quarter time.\n\nSleeve notes to reissue of Sugar on CD\n\nI think they blew it on more than a couple of tracks. I think they blew it on the concept. In the early 60s, Britain had a great deal of trad jazz … Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk. Then we had novelty English bands like The Temperance Seven and the New Vaudeville Band, or Clinton Ford solo, or later, The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, playing in an old fashioned way. Maybe the style was a novelty in America, It was a perplexing choice for Britain. What you have here is often very much like trad jazz / New Orleans jazz, or 1920s dance hall, but instead of being played sloppily by cheerful beery British blokes, or by authentic New Orleans jazzmen, it’s being played by the cream of LA session guys, who don’t usually play this stuff, but play it with far greater precision. Instead of the normal trumpet, trombone and clarinet of the trad line up, you have five trumpets and four trombones.\n\nSweet Georgia Brown dates back to 1925. You can’t knock the choice really, as The Beatles did it with Tony Sheridan in 1962. It features almost a rap over rich bass, but with a massive trad instrumental at the middle and end. Nancy veers unusually somewhat towards a black accent. It’s more convincing than The Beatles effort.\n\nVagabond Shoes was a hit (US #17) for Vic Damone in 1950. The band drowns her.\n\nOh, You Beautiful Doll goes back to 1911 and countless recordings, most famously Al Jolson. She continues pairing her voice with the bass player and keeping the horns separate.\n\nHard Hearted Hannah was written in 1924, and would be fine in a 30s or 40s or 50s movie about a night club singer. Both Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald had a go at it, as did Britain’s Temperance Seven. Nancy lost the subtitle ‘The Vamp of Savannah.’ Cher in Burlesque was doing this sort of thing more recently.\n\nAll By Myself keeps us in the 1920s. Irving Berlin wrote it in 1921. Another with so many covers from Bing Crosby to Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, Ella Fitzgerald, Connie Francis, Kay Starr, Brenda Lee. Trad band style with muted trumpet. Billy Strange gets special sleeve credit for the guitar solo on All By Myself.\n\nThe only other Hazlewood composition on the album is Coastin’. Another James Bond start, and bass guitar rather than acoustic bass (or both in unison). The trumpet solo is very fine. It was used as a B-side. The lyrics are gentle by Lee Hazlewood standards:\n\nWhen I kissed your angel face\n\nMy whole world fell into place\n\nMama Goes Where Papa Goes … guess what? 1923. Kay Starr sang it in 1948. A feature of the album is mixing Nancy’s voice up front and dropping instrumental sections back, except for lead horns. She speaks a lot of the lyric, most effectively. The song is semi-novelty. People seek the origins of rap, citing songs like Shopping For Clothes by The Coasters. If the 1923 original was anything like Nancy’s take on the song, you can go further back.\n\nLet’s Fall In Love starts out gently, a touch like Sugar Town. The CD album has this wrong, attributing it to Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. That’s the 1933 song that Frank Sinatra later recorded in 1961. He also recorded a completely different song with Shirley Maclaine in 1960 for Can-Can, and that’s the song here which is correctly entitled Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall in Love) or Let’s Do It and was written by Cole Porter in 1928. The 1967 British LP has the wrong title too, and the wrong attribution on the inner label. i.e. They’ve been paying the royalties to the wrong composers and publisher for fifty years. However Wikipedia wins … it lists Nancy’s version under the Cole Porter song (correctly) but not under the Arlen / Koehler song. I’m glad we’ve cleared that up. Thank you notes from the Cole Porter Estate gratefully received. Electric bass is the loudest instrument on the track … the rest retreat. They go for a touch of comic dialogue with the chorus. It’s deceptively difficult, an extremely hard song to sing well (she does) – I remember abandoning it for a pantomime years ago in rehearsals, which may be why I remembered it was by Cole Porter.\n\nWhat’ll I Do is Irving Berlin. 1923. It’s another one that her dad had recorded, twice in 1947, and in 1962. In interviews, she continually stresses Frank’s wise advice to distance herself from his material. Not on this album. A couple of chords on guitar, then it’s Nancy’s voice; intimate, mixed at the front with gentle guitar behind for a verse. (Too) predictably percussion and bass arrive on the first chorus. A meandering horn in the background. It’s sparse, bare, subtle. As a version of What’ll I Do it’s brilliant, but looking at my computer as I type, I shake my head at iTunes definition of every song here as “rock.”\n\nLimehouse Blues starts with a bit of Fu Manchu tinkling (China has been mentioned) before lurching into a burlesque show swing. As the title shows, it’s Chinatown London, or where it used to be pre-World War Two, and is British in origin from 1921. At the end she says:\n\nConfucius he say\n\nPeople who live in lime houses\n\nShould maybe\n\npaint them a different colour?\n\nSugar Town comes next. The plinkety plunk surprisingly fits in with the album, though this is so far and away the best song on there as well as the best performance.\n\nButton Up Your Overcoat. 1929. Around the same time as Sugar, Connie Francis recorded Connie & Clyde – Sings Songs of The 30s with this song on it. Maybe 20s / 30s song tributes was an Italian-American thing! In the same sort of pastiche style the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band had done it as a B-side in 1966. Nancy was not alone. You might think the Bonzo Dog was an old version – you can tell hers is later.\n\nMy Buddy is 1922. Everyone did it in the 30s and 40s. In her sleeve notes Nancy cites My Buddy as the personally important track, which she sang after returning from a three week singing tour to US troops in Vietnam, which she remembered for life and she has worked for vets ever since. It’s just that for me the tune and treatment might work in a World War II situation … I think of far tougher stuff for Vietnam. However, there are photos of her with injured GIs, so it’s clearly a sincere choice.\n\nThe CD reissue bonus tracks are Love Eyes, which had been a single in May 1967 (see below under Late 60s Singles), and the mega-selling Somethin’ Stupid.\n\nYOU ONLY LIVE TWICE\n\nI’m not a fan of James Bond films, nor do I share the wide enthusiasm for the over dramatic film theme songs, but taking the lot of them, You Only Live Twice and McCartney’s Live and Let Die are my favourites. You Only Live Twice was, like the other early themes, a John Barry and Leslie Bricusse composition. Barry tried it twice before deciding on Nancy Sinatra. First up was Julie Rogers with tinkling Chinese bits over the orchestra and sounding serious and operatic (available on Bond CD retrospectives). Then they cut it with Lorraine Chandler (in full Shirley Bassey mode). No one was happy, and John Barry wanted Aretha Franklin to try it. Bond producer Cubby Broccoli wanted Frank Sinatra to do it.\n\nJOHN BARRY: Cubby Broccoli was a friend of Frank Sinatra’s. So he phoned him up and said we’d love you to sing the song in the movie. But Frank said no, he didn’t want to do it, but my daughter is really good! Have Nancy do it.\n\nIt’s now available as a bonus track on the CD release of Nancy in London. It was recorded at CTS Studios in Bayswater with a 60-piece orchestra on 2nd May 1967. In the sleeve notes she says she was terrified singing in front of the huge orchestra.\n\nNANCY: You Only Live Twice was difficult in a lot of ways. The fact that is was quite rangey, and I wasn’t used to that, I was used to my little octave and a half. I even asked John, are you sure you want me to do this because maybe you need Shirley Bassey? But they said no, we want you, we want your sound.\n\nJohn Barry calmed her nerves by saying they would track the vocal separately.\n\nJOHN BARRY: We took about maybe twelve takes and then when she had gone, we literally took pieces from all these takes that we had done and we stuck them all together and made the one tape that finally went out with the movie. As we say, it was a hatchet job. But she loved it and when she heard it she called me up and said you made it sound wonderful.\n\nOn the DVD commentary track John Barry ups the number and says the final version is 25 takes, while Nancy says that she sounded like Minnie Mouse. Nancy:\n\nNANCY: There were bad notes, they just edited it together. They didn’t want to embarrass me. I tried my best – I was 26 years old and really scared\n\nSoundtrack LP, US version\n\nThe CD reissue sleeve notes that the bonus track is ‘the rarer double-voiced single version which was actually recorded in LA, not London.’ The single version is not the same as the soundtrack version. The single was re-recorded and produced by Billy Strange because Lee Hazlewood felt the full instrumental version was too lush for a 45 single. It’s still pretty lush, but a guitar replaces what remained of the Oriental bit, and the orchestra has more treble and a more prominent bass part. Her voice is mellower on the soundtrack version, harder-edged on the Billy Strange version.\n\nNancy adds that she could sing it better now (1995). For me, Shirley Bassey fell (way) over the top in the over-dramatic stakes and would have bellowed and wept where Nancy sings. The single did well (US #44, UK #11).\n\nA different version on the 45 single. UK copy\n\nELVIS & NANCY\n\n1967 was a busy year … she was Elvis Presley’s co-star in Speedway (released to screen in 1968). She had been assigned to greet Elvis on his return from the army in 1960, bearing gifts from her dad. She got equal billing on the Speedway poster. She danced with Elvis and sang a few lines in the last part of There Ain’t Nothing Like A Song. She is wearing a white mini-dress and those long white boots, which is probably one reason she was cast.\n\nVIDEO LINK: THERE AIN’T NOTHING LIKE A SONG\n\nOn his 17thfilm soundtrack, she became the first co-star to get a full solo song: Your Groovy Self, written by Lee Hazlewood naturally. Elvis’s problem in the film era was material. The great songwriting teams, Leiber & Stoller and Pomus & Schuman were no longer prepared to go along with Colonel Parker’s demands for a major cut of the publishing. So Elvis generally ended up with workday songwriters who would, notably Ben Weisman and Sid Wayne. A selection can be found on Glen Campbell Sings For The King (2018) a selection of demos of Weisman material which Glen Campbell did between 1964 and 1968 for Elvis to follow faithfully, probably with the same Wrecking Crew musicians that Nancy used. Nancy Sinatra must have pressed for a Lee Hazlewood song rather than more of Elvis’s low-grade film songs.\n\nYour Groovy Self was recorded quite separately to Elvis’s songs, with her usual backing musicians, not the ones who backed Elvis on the rest. In the film, she mimes with Elvis’s supposed band, some of whom are dancers posing as musicians. It’s the best song in the movie. It is also available on her 1999 compilation You Go Go Girl.\n\nVIDEO LINK: YOUR GROOVY SELF from SPEEDWAY\n\nElvis Presley: Speedway LP. With Elvis, the worse the film, the rarer (and more valuable) the soundtrack album is.\n\nThe choreography on Your Groovy Self is clichéd, but she sings in a laconic, almost sleazy way, and the band sounds burlesque with a powerful drum part, as if about to break into a striptease. We won’t investigate how Lee Hazlewood came to rhyme ‘bus’ with ‘dangerous.’\n\nThe film wasn’t well received, but …\n\nSpeedway has a script that ran out of gas before Elvis Presley was born. Presley pictures can be unpretentious fun, but this one is both uninspired and too much of an imitation of too many of his previous movies … There aren’t even very many songs to break up developments too predictable to outline here … Nancy Sinatra’s one song was the high point of the picture.\n\nKevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times, 22 May 1968\n\nTHE INCEST SONG\n\nMy original copy, bought new\n\nSomethin’ Stupid was a duet between Nancy Sinatra and her dad. It was written by Carson C. Parkes for his male / female duo, Carson & Gaile, and recorded in November 1966. Gaile Foote was Carson’s wife. It appeared on their album San Antonio Rose. Carson Parkes was the older brother of Van Dyke Parkes. Call Me by Frank alone was the B-side.\n\nCARSON C. PARKES: My manager Wally Brady knew Mo Ostin (head of Reprise) and he got a tape of the song to Mo and asked him to put it on the top of the pile. Frank used to fly up every Friday from Palm Springs to Burbank to do the business things. Well, it seems that Frank called Nancy and said “We gotta do this.” Mo thought it was a dog, but Frank thought it was Top Ten. The song was in the right place at the right time. Nancy was on the teen market stations, a market Frank hadn’t cracked, and at that stage Nancy hadn’t cracked the MoR stations.”\n\nRichard Havers “Sinatra”\n\nNancy had another version of the story:\n\nNANCY: Him (her dad) influence me? You’re joking. Do you think it was an easy job getting him to record commercial songs? It’s like pulling teeth. I had to drag him bodily into the studio.\n\nRichard Havers “Sinatra”\n\nIt was known by those around at the time as ‘the incest song’ though perhaps not in Frank Sinatra’s hearing. Havers also says it was called “The dumb dumb song around Reprise.” Ah, well, it just proves who had the right ears for a hit. The session was recorded on 1st February 1967.\n\nLee Hazlewood said:\n\nLEE: Frank played it for me, and says “You’ve been wanting me to do something with the kid.” He wanted me to produce it but I said I can’t. Jimmy Bowen produces you, so we’ll both have to do it. I didn’t pay attention to Jimmy and he didn’t pay attention to me. We brought in our rhythm section – Hal Blaine, Don Randi, Al Casey, Donnie Owens– and got rid of Frank’s. Nobody mentioned a follow-up.’\n\n(Sleeve notes to “Califia”, Ace)\n\nSomethin’ Stupid: South African Reprise. South African #1 single. “Nancy & Frank Sinatra” sounds more incestuous than the “Nancy Sinatra & Frank Sinatra” elsewhere\n\nLEE: (Frank) was an iron-fisted father making sure he got the best out of his daughter with the best musicians. The director of the film we were shooting of the sessions was so afraid of Sinatra, he’d ask me if I’d ask them if they’d mind doing one more take. So I’d tell Frank we needed another and he’d say “You got it.” It was nothing but easy. We went right through it. My concern was for her, but she was perfect, as he was in the end.\n\nShindig, July-August 2010\n\nIt was a #1 hit in Britain and the USA, and in South Africa, Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, Norway. Frank’s smooth delivery and unique sense of timing makes it special.\n\nIt went onto Frank’s album The World We Knew. Al Casey and Glen Campbell were the guitarists. Carole Kaye on bass guitar as usual, paired with Ralph Pena on acoustic bass. Hal Blaine on drums. The song is mentioned in The Wrecking Crew film. Al Casey had played the original guitar part for Carson & Gaile. Frank Sinatra asked "
