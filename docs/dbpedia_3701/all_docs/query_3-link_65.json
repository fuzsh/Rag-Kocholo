        "text": "1942\n\nCapitol Records was born out of Johnny Mercer frustration not being able to obtain satisfactory recording conditions for his work, and upon a suggestion from Glenn Wallichs.\n\nMercer made an initial arrangement in January 1942 with Buddy DeSylva (at that time head of production at Paramount Studios), who will agree to put in a total of $25,000 to help things start.\n\nOn February 7, Liberty Records was created. Due to the failure to obtain rights on the name, though, it was changed to Capitol Records, which was effectively created on April 9.\n\nLater in May was held the first recording session of the new label (a Paul Whiteman session), like most of the early recordings, at C.P. MacGregor's Recording Studios (729 S. Western Avenue, Hollywood, CA, USA).\n\nOn May 21, Cow-Cow Boogie (the first gold Capitol single) is recorded by Freddie Slack.\n\nLater on, Glenn Wallichs invent the concept of giving away promotional pre-releases to disc-jockeys - soon imitated by other companies, that move was crucial in making Capitol early success - including Cow-Cow Boogie.\n\nOn June 4, Capitol officially starts activity in a new office, 1483 Vine Street, Hollywood, CA, USA. Capitol will stay there until 1946. The first batch of employees includes (besides Mercer & Wallichs) Dave Shelly, Floyd Bittaker, and Dave Dexter, Jr. (later on famous for turning off the Beatles twice).\n\nOn June 12, Billie Holiday records with Paul Whiteman (Travelin' Light).\n\nSoon after, the first reviews of Capitol records appears in Billboard Magazine.\n\nOn July 1, Capitol finally releases a first batch of 9 singles, numbered 101 to 109, soon the be praised and a commercial success.\n\nOn July 30, the Petrillo Ban starts, helping in the end of Big Band orchestras.\n\nBy the end of the year, Capitol made $195,000, signing Tex Ritter, Martha Tilton, Johnny Mercer, Ella Mae Morse, Freddie Slack, Margaret Whiting and Johnnie Johnston, and hiring Paul Weston as musical director.\n\n1943-1955\n\n1955\n\nBought by EMI.\n\nNotes\n\nHad subsidiaries: SBK, EMI America Records and EMI-Manhattan Records.\n\nDistributed by: Capitol Records (US), Parlophone/EMI Records (UK)"
