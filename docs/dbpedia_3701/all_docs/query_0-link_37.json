        "text": "The Peggy Lee Bio-Discography:\n\nA Gallery Of Various-Artists Compilations\n\nFrom The Capitol-EMI Family Of Labels\n\n(Excluding Serialized Albums)\n\nby Iván Santiago\n\nScope And Contents\n\nThis album gallery focuses on compilations from the Capitol-Emi family of labels. Besides their connection to Emi or Capitol, the chosen compilations have two other elements in common: their track listings feature various artists and, naturally, Peggy Lee is one of them. The gallery's first section covers anthologies from the 78-rpm era (i.e., Capitol releases that originally came out on shellac). Subsequent sections highlight vinyl (domestic LPs in section II, non-domestic LPs in section III), tapes, cartridges (IV), and compact discs (V-X). Divided by label, the CD sections bring attention to not only Emi's branches and sub-companies but also its partners and licensees. To wit: Blue Note (VI), Emigold, Music for Pleasure, Toshiba (VII), Disky (VIII), Virgin (IX), HMV (X), and Capitol's own Special Markets branch (V).\n\nI. CAPITOL COMPILATIONS ON 78-RPM DISC\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n1 & 2. Title: New American Jazz (Criterion Series) / Format: 78-rpm Album / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Cd 3 [also Set A3] / Tracks: 8 / Rel. Year: 1944 / Note: Includes The Capitol Jazzmen's recordings of \"Ain't Goin' No Place\" and \"That Old Feeling,\" both of which feature Peggy Lee on vocals. Recorded expressly for inclusion in this 1944 album, these two vocals were Lee's earliest appearances in any Capitol release. The album's front cover is pictured in image #2, and the inner side of that same front cover on image #1. Note that, on the front cover, the issue is identified as CD3. (Not pictured herein, the album booklet identifies itself as Set A3.) Photos of the session participants can be found in both the booklet and the above-seen cover.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n3-6. Title: Jerome Kern's Music (Criterion Series) / Format: 78-rpm Album & EP & 10\" LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Cd 41(10072-10075) & Ccf 210(F 155501) [reissued as Ebf 210] & H 210/ Rel. Year: 1947 [78-rpm album] & 1950 [10\" LP] / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"She Didn't Say Yes.\" Displayed in the images above are the back and front cover, as well as the inner sides of this 78-rpm album. Additional images can be found here, under session dated September 23, 1946.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n7-10. Title: Somebody Loves Me; The Beloved Songs Of Buddy DeSylva (Criterion Series) / Format: 78-rpm Album / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Cd 49 (10085-10088) / Rel. Year: 1947 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Somebody Loves Me.\" On display in the third mage is not the album but an advertisement that Capitol placed in music trade publications. A physical copy of the album is seen in all the other images above .\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n11-14. Title: Collector's Items - Top Drawer Jazz Classics (Americana Series) / Format: 78-rpm Album / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Ad 62 (48012-48015) / Rel. Year: 1948 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Baby (Is What He Calls Me).\"\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n15-19. Title: Songs From Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific / Format: 78-rpm album & 10\" LP & 45-rpm Album / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Cd 162 (57 596-599) & H 163 & Cdf 163 (54 600-603) / Rel. Year: 1949 & 1950 / Note: The album under discussion includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"Bali Ha'i\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair.\" It is presented above in all the formats in which it was released, beginning with the 78-rpm album (cd 162). The cover of the 78-rpm album can be seen in the first image (front) and also in the fourth image (inner side of the same front cover). A CD reissue is featured in the last image.\n\nAs for vinyl configurations, the EP version (Cdf 163) is spotlighted in the fifth of these images. It is a boxed 45-rpm release. Songs From Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific also came out as a 10\" LP, but not as a 12\" LP. A ten-inch LP copy of the album can be inspected in the second image above, and another one on the third image.\n\nIt must be noted that these two 10\" LP copies are fairly different. I have not been able to inspect actual physical copies of either 10\" LP. I do not have specific details about them, either. Hence I can only speculate. (The images themselves were grabbed from online commercial sites, which offered scant information.) One possibility is that the 10\" LP was issued twice in the United States. An alternate possibility would be that one of the depicted albums is a non-domestic item, in spite of online claims that both are American issues. This subject matter (i.e., 10\" LP versions of the issue under discussion) is actually a bit more complicated than what the present paragraph suggests. For further discussion, see image #21 and its corresponding note.)\n\n20. Title: The Best Of Broadway, Vol. 1: South Pacific - Kiss Me, Kate / Format: CD / Label: DRG / Cat. Num.: 19113 / Rel. Year: 2008 / Note: Digital twofer reissue. Peggy Lee participates in only one of the two reissued albums, Songs From Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific. As already indicated elsewhere, she is heard singing \"Bali Ha'i\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair.\"\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n21. Title: Songs From South Pacific / Format: 10\" LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: H 163 / Rel. Year: probably 1949 / Note: In the 10\" LP format, there would appear to have been at least three American versions of Songs From [Rodgers & Hammerstein's] South Pacific. Two of them have already been shown above. Then there is the one seen in this photo, issued both in the US and the UK. (For the latter, see next image.) Despite having made various efforts to find information on the matter, I still cannot provide an explanation for the apparent multiplicity of versions.\n\nThe musical South Pacific was of course hugely popular once it premiered. Given such a measure of popularity, the of versions on all the major labels labels is far from surprising, and ditto for its existence in many album configurations. But the question posed here is why Capitol would have seen it fit to release not just two but three 10\" LP versions with differing designs, and within a short time span. One factor to take into consideration is that, when Capitol issued its very first batch of 10\" LPs in September of 1949, this album [H 163] was among them. Could it be that Capitol originally issued its 10\" LPs in rather plain monochromatic covers such as the one seen in this image, only to decide soon afterwards to shift to more alluring coverwork? I would also like to bring attention to the slightly different title of this version; it misses the names of the songwriters. Perchance, after the original release of the album, the songwriters requested the inclusion of their names in the album's front cover, thus leading to the reissuing of a somewhat reconfigured album?)\n\n22. Title: South Pacific Selection / Format: 10\" LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom) Lc 6540 / Rel. Year: unknown; possibly in or around 1950 / Note: British edition of the American item discussed in the preceding entry. Similarly plain design, but different catalogue number.\n\n23. Title: Rodgers And Hammerstein's South Pacific And The King And I / Format: LP / Label: EMI / Cat. Num.: (Australia) Enc 9042 / Rel. Year: unknown / Note: Australian reissue of Capitol's album Songs From South Pacific, coupled with the song contents of another show. Peggy Lee is heard only in the South Pacific portion of the album, singing \"Bali Ha'i\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair.\"\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n24 & 25. Title: The Capitol Jazzmen - Metronome All Stars (\"Capitol Jazz Must Item\" Series) / Format: LP / Tracks: 16 / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: (Japan) Cr 8801 / Rel. Year: probably between 1965 and 1970 / Note: Essentially a vinyl reissue of the 78-rpm album New American Jazz (entries #1 & #2 above), with additional tracks culled from the additional sessions that The Capitol Jazzmen recorded in later years. Naturally, this album includes the two masters that Peggy Lee waxed with The Capitol Jazzmen (\"Ain't Goin' No Place,\" \"That Old Feeling\"). Incidentally, note that The Capitol Jazzmen - Metronome All Stars is a 33.3-rpm vinyl LP, not a 78 shellac disc. It is included in the present section (dedicated to 78 material) only because it is, as already stated, a reissue of item #1. The same point applies to all remaining vinyl entries in the present section.\n\n26. Title: The Giants Of Jazz And The Capitol Jazzmen (\"Immortal Jazz\" Series) / Format: LP / Label: R international / Cat. Num.: (Italy) Snir Cp 25.021 / Tracks: 13 / Rel. Year: 1971 / Note: Contains all masters from the Capitol Jazzmen's three earliest sessions -- a dozen. (There is one additional tracks in this album: \"The Song Was Born,\" which features the so-called Giants of Jazz -- Louis Armstrong, Charlie Barnet, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, et cetera. Though listed as only one unit in the back cover, this track might actually combine the Giants of Jazz' two takes of the song.) Presumed to be a Public Domain release.\n\n27. Title: The Capitol Jazzmen, 1943-47 / Format: LP / Label: Swaggie / Cat. Num.: (Australia) S 1406 / Tracks: 18 / Rel. Year: 1984 / Note: A licensed vinyl reissue, containing the tracks found in item #24, as well as related tracks. The latter are credited to two other ensembles, Jack Teagarden's Chicagoan and the Hollywood Hucksters.\n\n28. Title: The Capitol Jazzmen; Hollywood Sessions / Format: CD / Label: Jazz Unlimited / Cat. Num.: (Denmark) 2044 / Tracks: 22 / Rel. Year: 1995 / Note: A digital, Public Domain issue that contains the Capitol Jazzmen tracks on the preceding items, as well as additional ones by this and other Capitol-invented ensembles. Among the additional tracks are those recorded at a special instrumental date on which Peggy Lee played drums.\n\n29. Title: Classic Capitol Jazz Sessions / Format: LP & CD / Discs: 19 [LPs] & 12 [CDs] / Label: Mosaic / Cat. Num.: Mq19 (LP) & Md12 170 (CD) / Rel. Year: 1997 / Note: Digital set containing the Capitol material found in the preceding LPs and CD, as well as in the 78-rpm album New American Jazz, plus many more tracks from the label's vaults. For additional photos and detail, consult section I of the Capitol Promos and Retrospectives page.\n\nGeneral Note: I believe to have listed above all the various-artists US Capitol compilations from the 78-rpm era in which Peggy Lee is featured. If there are any others, I would appreciate being told about such omissions.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n30 & 31. Title: Listen And Relax; Capitol Vocalists Sing / Format: 78 Album / Discs: 6 or 12 (or more) / Label: Capitol-King / Cat. Num.: (Japan) unknown/ Rel. Year: unknown / Note: This various artists album contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"Mañana\" and \"Why Don't You Do Right,\" both of them on the above-seen 78-rpm disc, whose catalogue number is Z-10. The catalogue number of the album itself is not known to me, and neither is the release date, which could not be earlier than 1953. The other artists in the compilation are June Christy under Stan Kenton (\"Tampico,\" on Z-195) Gisele MacKenzie (\"Jolie Jacqueline,\" \"Fairyland,\" on Z-51), Helen O'Connell (\"No Other Love,\" \"Night For Love,\" possibly on Z-205), Anita O'Day with Stan Kenton (\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine,\" on Z-195), Frank Sinatra (\"My One And Only Love,\" \"I've Got The World On A String,\" on Z-204), Kay Starr (\"Change Partners,\" and \"I'll Always Be In Love With You,\" on Z-224). Those 12 tracks on six discs are the only ones that I have seen in listings of this set.\n\nHowever, such listings could be incomplete. Listen And Relax; Capitol Vocalists Sing could have consisted of two 78 album sets, or even more than two. The rationale behind this hypothetical scenario of mine: twelve singers are listed in the above-shown front cover, yet only six of them sing in the 78-rpm discs that I just itemized. (The missing artists are Nat King Cole, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Ella Mae Morse, Tex Ritter, Jo Stafford, and Margaret Whiting, whose Rodgers & Hart 78 songbook was borrowed to create the cover if this various-artists compilation. See also next entry.\n\n32 & 33. Title: {Wandering Swallow / Begin The Beguine [solo sung by Jo Stafford]} / / Format: 78 / Label: Capitol-King / Cat. Num.: (Japan) Z 73 / Rel. Year: unknown / Note: I suspect this 78-rpm disc to be part of the album set described in the preceding entry. However, my suspicion could be off the mark; instead, the disc could simply be a single.\n\nII. CAPITOL COMPILATIONS ON LP (A SAMPLE)\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n1. Title: Today's Top Hits By Today's Top Artists, Volume 1 / Format: 10\" LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: H 9101 / Rel. Year: 1951 / Note: Part of a Capitol album series.

Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Fever,\" in its stereo version.\n\n6. Title: Esquire's World Of Jazz / Format: LP / Disc: 2 / Label: Capitol / Rel. Year: 1963 / Cat. Num.: Tbo 1970 / Note: Includes the Capitol Jazzmen recordings of \"That Old Feeling\" and \"Ain't Goin' No Place,\" both featuring Peggy Lee on vocals. Prepared by Dave Dexter, Jr. (who produced the original session, and was behind many other jazz-oriented projects at Capitol Records), this album identifies itself as being from Capitol's \"Dimensions In Jazz\" series, to which Peggy Lee's original LP Mink Jazz also belongs. The album was also devised by Dexter, Jr. as a complement to the coffee table book Esquire's World Of Jazz, which the editors of that magazine had recently published.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n7.

Num.: 1A9332 (also Ql 6953) / Rel. Year: 1974 / Note: A quadraphonic album, prepared for the electronics company Magnavox. Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"You'll Remember Me.\"\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n16. Title: Stereo Music Demonstration Record / Note: This image shows part of the back cover of the LP itemized in entry #13. In the visible annotation, we are told that \"[e]ach selection in this album has been carefully selected from the Capitol Records library of master recordings and reproduced from the original master tapes.\" The process is explained in some detail, and photos are used as supplementary aid (A80 Studer tape machine, Neve console, Neuman cutting lathe, the latter with a SX-74 cutting head). In the portion of the back cover that is not shown above, each track is granted one paragraph of commentary. When it comes to the number sung by Peggy Lee, we are told that it is one of her \"finest recordings, both artistically and technically. The carnival band type of arrangement can be fully heard and appreciated because of the superb sound engineering.\"\n\n17. Title: The Sylvania Challenge / Note: Back cover of the LP itemized in entry #14. The visible liner notes spell out the titular challenge: album listeners are asked to \"[p]ick any selection on this record and listen to it come alive with new brilliance on Sylvania Stereo-Plus components. Then try the same selection on any other stereo. And take it home and listen to it on your present equipment. You'll be amazed how much you've been missing all these years.\" This LP is just one among more than a handful of albums prepared by Capitol for Sylvania. (There was even one Sylvania LP entirely dedicated to Peggy Lee: The Sounds Of The Seventies.)\n\n18. Title: Magnavox Presents A 4-Sound Experience / Note: Back cover of the LP itemized in entry #15. The text touts Capitol's quadraphonic sound as \"a major advancement in the art of recording,\" through which decoder owners can enjoy the optimal \"reproduction of sound from four separate channels.\" The photo on the left shows sound engineer Carson Taylor at the Capitol Tower, mixing one of the performances (from the 16-channel master tape) for its release as a quadraphonic or four-channel experience in the album. Magnabox's chief audio engineer Ron Barber is seen in the photo on the right.\n\nIII. NON-DOMESTIC COMPILATIONS ON LP (A SAMPLE FROM CAPITOL-EMI, ELECTROLA, MUSIC FOR PLEASURE, ODEÓN, AND TOSHIBA)\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n1. Title: Those Were The Hits Of 1950-1951 / Format: LP / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) 1A 022 15 8405 1 / Rel. Year: 1986 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"(Ghost) Riders Of The Sky.\" This album is actually part of a long series that ran until the 1970s (if not further). Another Peggy Lee track (\"Fever\") can be found in one of the subsequent volumes, Those Were The Hits Of 1958.\n\n2. Title: Those Were The Hits Of 1958 / Format: LP / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) 1A 022 15 8412 1 / Rel. Year: 1986 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's Capitol hit \"Fever.\"\n\n3.

Year: 1979 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"The Sweetest Sounds\" and \"Hey There.\" A mail order item, this gatefold LP comes with a full-size booklet (last image above), which contains photos of the artists and transcriptions of the lyrics). Not shown about is the album's centerfold, featuring the same model seen on the front cover and the LP's sleeve, posing in an one-piece bathing suit for the occasion. (The used of a centerfold, featuring a female model, was a standard practice of this series, and obviously a lure for the targeted customers. Even the albums entirely dedicated to male singers featured one. It is not much of a paradox, however, that the Julie London LP in the series features London herself as its centerfold.)\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n10. Title: The Capitol T Album / Format: LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: (The Netherlands) 5C 026 85599 X / Rel.

Year: unknown / Note: Includes one of Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings, possibly from her Beauty And The Beat album. The exact title remains unknown to me. This LP appears to be part of a series released by Toshiba under the \"World Record Club\" imprint. I do not know if Toshiba used the club's name solely as an imprint, or if it actually established a Japanese branch of the mail-order club which bore that name. (During the 1960s, the World Record Club reissued Capitol albums in Australia and the United Kingdom.) Red vinyl.\n\n15. Title: Softly As I Leave You / Format: LP / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat.

Title: Martini Musique / Format: CD / Label: El Paso Chile Company - Emi Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 719212 83006 9 / Rel. Year: 2002 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"What A Little Moonlight Can Do.\" El Paso Chile is (was) a food business created in 1980 by the Kerrs, a mother-and-an team that specialized in Mex-Tex, Southwestern cuisine. By 1992, they had published two books, the one from that year being The El Paso Chile Company's Texas Border Cookbook.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n7. Title: New York, With Fond Memories / Format: CD / Label: City Songs - Emi Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72438 19956 2 4 / Rel. Year: 1998 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's self-penned Capitol recording \"New York City Blues.\"\n\n8 & 9. Title: San Francisco, With Fond Memories / Format: CD / Label: City Songs - Emi Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 07777 57023 2 3 / Rel. Year: 1990 (reissued 1994, reprinted 1998) / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's self-penned Capitol recording \"San Francisco Blues\" and Mel Tormé's self-penned Capitol piece \"Got The Gate On The Golden Gate,\" in which Peggy Lee sings under a pseudonym. Though the date of the earliest edition of this CD is generally given as 1990, a Billboard article gives it as 1989. The first of the two above-seen front covers belongs to the 1989 or 1990 edition, the other cover to the 1994 and 1998 reissue(s). One difference between the 1989/1990/1994 editions and the 1998 reissue pertains to the exchange of the excellent number \"I'm Always Drunk In San Francisco\" (sung by Carmen McRae) for \"San Francisco (You've Got Me)\" (performed by The Village Voice). I do not know the reason for the substitution, but I would not be surprised if I were to hear that tourism offices (for whom these CDs were originally made) raised objections to the title of the McRae rendition.\n\n10. There are no Peggy Lee tracks in the item shown herein (Southern California, With Fond Memories, catalogue number S21-18018, 1995). I have included its image because it is the only other item from the \"With Fond Memories\" CD series highlighted through the three preceding images. These CDs are tourism sampler discs, produced by Capitol (CEMA) Special Markets at the request of City Songs, Inc. That corporation was created (1989) and presided by Mary Stephenson, a former tour guide and bus driver who, in the early days of the CD era, noticed the lack of city-themed discs and their desirability as tourism tools. City Songs originally conceived the CDs as the main components of gift packs prepared for the Convention And Visitors Bureaus of San Francisco, Los Angeles and, later on, New York City. The Bureaus issued them in media kits, particularly at TIA Discover America International Pow Pows. With the passing of the years, all three CDs ended up being sent to and sold at commercial stores -- most notably, Tower Records. In 1997, City Songs was claiming to have sold 80,000 units of the California CDs. In 2014, Stephenson further stated that a total of 2,000 units were pre seen between 1989 and 2000.\n\nVI.

Title: Something Old - Something Blue (Blue Note Trip, Mixed By Maestro, Vol. 6) / Format: CD / Volumes: 2 / Label: Blue Note / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) 094639 6170 2 9 / Rel. Year: 2008 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Spinning Wheel.\"\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n4. Title: Blue Note Plays Bossa Nova / Format: CD / Volumes: 3 / Label: Blue Note / Cat.

Title: California Cool (\"Blue Pacific\" Series) / Format: CD / Label: Blue Note / Cat. Num.: Bn 0007 80707 2 6 / Rel.

Year: 2000 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"Always True To You In My Fashion\" and \"On The Street Where You Live.\" Also includes the instrumental \"Mambo In Miami,\" from the Peggy Lee - George Shearing album Beauty And The Beat!.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n7. Title: Pure Jazz Chillout / Format: CD / Volumes: 2 / Label: Blue Note?; Virgin EMI / Cat. Num.: (Australia & United Kingdom) 7243 8 12798 2 3 & VTDCD459 / Rel. Year: 2002 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Fever.\" Definitely released on EMI's Virgin imprint in the UK. Less clear is whether an earlier edition had been released by Blue Note in Japan.\n\n8. Title: Jazz Chillout / Format: CD / Volumes: 2 / Label: Blue Note (also EMI International) / Cat. Num.: (Australia) 7243 5 36418 2 5 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Days Of Wine And Roses.\" I should also note that Lee is not credited at all in various websites, where the performer is identified instead as the song's own composer, Henry Mancini. Since I do not own a copy of this CD, I cannot confidently ascertain whether this double credit to Mancini is incorrect, but I am inclined to believe that it is.\n\n9. Title: Jazz Chillout III / Format: CD / Label: Blue Note / Cat. Num.: (Australia) 639725 / Rel. Year: 2006 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"Basin St. Blues\" and \"Senza Fine.\" In a related note, it is worth adding that there are other releases in this Blue Note series. One of them bears the title Jazz Chillout II, and its front cover sports a drawing of a goth-style woman, dressed in black, her flesh rendered in blue. That CD does not include any Peggy Lee tracks. Yet another release is entitled Jazz Chillout (just like item #8). There are no Lee tracks in that 2CD set (7243 5 37971 2 6 1; also seemingly reprinted with catalogue number 7243 5 39466 2 3), whose front cover shows a burning candle against a blue background.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n10 & 11. Title: Blue Berlin; Blue Note Plays The Music Of Irving Berlin / Format: CS & CD / Label: Blue Note / Cat. Num.: 99095 / Rel.

Num.: (Japan) 5855 / Rel. Year: 1993 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Here's That Rainy Day.\"\n\nGeneral Note: I would actually like to include images for all Blue Note CDs featuring Peggy Lee. There are probably a few more such CDs, besides those already above, and I hope to eventually come across images of them. This section will thus remain indefinitely under construction.\n\nVII. NON-DOMESTIC CD COMPILATIONS (A SAMPLE FROM EMIGOLD, MUSIC FOR PLEASURE, AND TOSHIBA)\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n1. Title: Sophisticated Ladies / Format: CD / Volumes: 3 / Label: Emigold / Cat.

Year: 1999 / Note: Opens with Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"Love And Marriage\" and closes with her recording of \"The Folks Who Live In The Hill.\" There's also another Lee track, \"Always Something There To Remind Me,\" in the collection's second CD. Also found with the release years 2000, 2002, and 2004, all of which point to various reprints, or could alternatively be mistakes. Furthermore, I have a listing for what would seem to be an earlier 5CD/CS version of this set: 1995 Music For Pleasure Cddl 1302 & 7243 8 36550 2 1, maybe British and supposedly including 4 more PL vocals, \"I Won't Dance,\" \"It's A Good Day,\" \"Mañana,\" and \"Fever.\" However, the only online site on which I've located details about that 5piece set does not look highly reliable to me.}\n\n2. Title: Glamorous; The Greatest Divas Collection / Format: CD / Label: Emi & Minos / Cat. Num.: (Greece) 7243 597254 2 0 / Rel. Year: 1999 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recordings of \"Cheek To Cheek\" and \"I'm Gonna Go Fishin'.\" Also issued by EMI on its \"HMV Easy\" series, under the title The Greatest Divas Collection, with different artwork but the same tracks.\n\n3.

Year: 1998 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of \"On The Street Where You Live.\"\n\nGeneral Note About This \"Favourite\" Series: The four preceding items obviously belong to a series. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find specifics about the series itself. There must be at the very least 4 more volumes. I actually know the titles of two: Favourite Male Vocalists and Favourite Seventies. Neither includes Peggy Lee tracks. I should also add that this series' country of origin could be Australia instead of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, some online listings attribute selected CDs not to EMIgold but to Music For Pleasure, which could in turn be an indication that the series was originally released by MFP, possibly in the early 1990s.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n13. Title: Classic Easy; Vocal; The Very Best Of Easy Listening / Format: CD / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom) Mfp 6258 / Rel.

Year: 2002 & 2003 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rarely anthologized Capitol recordings of \"Oh, You Crazy Moon\" and \"Let's Fall In Love.\" The listings which I found claim that the Japanese edition dates from 2002, the British edition from 2003; corroboration is needed.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n17.

Title: Romantic Jazz Vocal / Format: CD / Label: Disky / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) Bx 902497 / Rel. Year: unknown / Note: Part of a boxed edition that will be further showcased below. Leaving aside the very different artwork and the catalogue number, this CD issue is the same one presented in entries #3 and #6 above (same title, same tracks).\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n10. Title: The Jazz Collection Series / Format: CD / Label: Disky / Rel. Year: 1999 / Discs: 10 / Note: Here are the ten discs that Disky separately sold as part of the label's Jazz Collection series. In addition to those which have been showcased above and below, the other five (none of them featuring Peggy Lee vocals) are Jazz Piano For Lovers, Jazz Piano Delight, Jazz Ballads For Late Nights, Jazz Ballads For Easy Listening, and Sweet And Dangerous Jazz Blues.\n\n11. Title: The Jazz Collection / Format: CD / Label: Disky / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) Db 990622 / Rel. Year: 2000 / Discs: 8 / Note: Includes the Peggy Lee vocals \"Days Of Wine And Roses,\" \"Strangers In The Night,\" and \"Mack The Knife.\" This is a 2000 packaging of the above-shown CDs, along with five other discs that do not feature Lee. All eight CDs had been individually sold in 1999, as part of a 10CD series. Two CDs were thus left out of this boxed set, and both of them happen to also feature Lee recordings. Hence they have been itemized below.\n\n12. Title: The Jazz Collection / Format: CD/ Label: Disky / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) Db 902490 / Rel. Year: 2004 / Discs: 8 / Note: Includes the Peggy Lee vocals \"Days Of Wine And Roses,\" \"Strangers In The Night,\" and \"Mack The Knife.\" This is a reissue of the preceding item. It foregoes of Katsumi Aoyama's original illustrations, which featured a female faces, opting instead for a color-coded if nondescript design. See also note under preceding entry.\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n13. Title: Late Afternoon Jazz Vocal / Format: CD / Label: Disky / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) Dc 854642 / Rel.

Num.: (Japan) Fjc 3201 / Rel. Year: unknown / Note: Japanese-market edition of the preceding item (same artwork, same tracks). This is presumably one of at least two Japanese editions. The other one, which I have not seen yet, would be on the Pigeon label. Furthermore, it stands to reason that the First Disc company might have also issued the other albums in this series, but I have no information on the matter.\n\n15. Title: Jazz Vocal At Night / Format: CD / Label: Disky / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands) Dc 854662 / Rel.

Both within the EMI family of labels and outside of it (i.e., among Public Domain labels), numerous compilations named Memories Are Made Of This have been released. Quite a few of them happen to include Lee numbers. British EMI had an entire such series, of which one above-shown item seems to have been part. Then there are multiple Disky CDs bearing the same moniker, including another item seen above. Some of these CDs do open with the song \"Memories Are Made Of This,\" which was a #1 hit for Dean Martin. Obviously, the chosen title formed part of a strategy to appeal to certain demographics groups, too.\n\nX. CD COMPILATIONS ON EMI'S HMV SERIES (A SAMPLE)\n\nArtwork Shown:\n\n1.
