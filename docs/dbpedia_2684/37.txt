Dinteloord is a nice old town that has existed for more than 400 years. It even has a marina and was the center of a gigantic reclamation project with royal features.

Marina

Dinteloord is probably named after the river Dintel on which it is located and has a nice marina on the north side. Along this harbor you first take a nice walk around the village through the greenery before walking back into the ancient town on the other side. The name Dinteloord was already mentioned in 1448. Strangely enough, it feels somewhat Dutch, even though you are here in Brabant.
