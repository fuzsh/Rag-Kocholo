Dinteloord has all the characteristics of a polder place. The history of the village begins shortly after the reclamation of the Prinsenland, the area between the rivers Vliet and Dintel, in the year 1605. It was the largest reclamation project in West Brabant. Dinteloord was also founded in the same year.
