        "text": "Van Oers United will start construction of a new location in the middle of the company’s cultivation area of French beans and sprouts. On 4 July last, Co Konings and Bert van der Beek gave the official starting signal on behalf of Van Oers United. In the presence of Paul Mesters and Paul Hagens (Suikerunie) and Petra Lepolder (the alderman of the municipality of Steenbergen), signatures were placed for the purchase of a building plot at industrial estate Agro & Food Cluster Nieuw Prinsenland in Dinteloord, the Netherlands.\n\nLeft to right: Paul Hagens, Manager Site Development, Suikerunie; Bert van der Beek, Project Leader New Construction, VOU; Co Konings, Operational Manager, VOU; Petra Lepolder, alderman Steenbergen municipality; Paul Mesters, CEO Suikerunie. The picture was taken in the boardroom of the historic office building of the Coöperatieve Suikerfabriek.\n\nVan Oers United BV, part of French cooperation Agrial since 2015, will build a new company building at this site, where it will focus on the French bean and sprout activities. The new building will have 13,700 metres of production space, and will be taken into use during the third quarter of 2018. The main branch will remain located at the fresh produce trade centre in Ridderkerk.\n\nBy realising this new production location, Van Oers United creates possibilities to realise its ambitions for growth. The production processes can become more efficient. The new building will be built according to the highest sustainability standards. The goal is to achieve the level Outstanding on the BREEAM certificate. Doing business with an eye for nature and society is an important element in the philosophy of Van Oers United. The BREEAM standard doesn’t just encourage an energy-efficient building, it also takes into account the welfare of the employees and the surrounding environment.\n\nVan Oers United consciously decided to choose the location at the Agro & Food cluster Nieuw Prinsenland. This industrial estate in Dinteloord (Steenbergen municipality) has a good connection to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp via the A4 motorway. The Food & Agro cluster offers opportunities for doing sustainable business. The cooperation with companies will be looked for in the field of: reusing water, composting waste, combining transports and making residual flows sustainable. The new location offers Van Oers the opportunity to continue living up to their mission statement ‘Delivering Excellent Produce’ every day!\n\nPublication date: Tue 8 Aug 2017"
