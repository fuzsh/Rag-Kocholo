Johannes parents were Carel Fontyn (1622-1687) and Catharyn De Baile 1622-1707 in France. They were married in Honnechy, Nord, France in 1647. This is a record of them: Fonteyn, Frenchman and wife, immigrated May 17, 1658 in the Gilded Beaver, the wife's name, as we find elsewhere, was Catherine de Balie. No children are mentioned, evidently they were a young married couple and clearly Huguenots as we find their children baptized in the Dutch Reformed Church. One family tree said that Carel might have been the father of Cornelia de Fonteijn, wife of De La Grange. Cornelia and her husband came to New Amsterdam in 1658 and lived for years in Bushwick, now part of Brooklyn.In 1680 they were in Wallabout visiting his aunt Catalina Trico. It is assumed that Carel Fonteijn who came to New Amsterdam in 1658 and lived for years in Bushwick was the son of Mary Flamegh (sister of Catalina Trico) actually half sister and nephew of Catalina Trico, making Catalina the great aunt of Cornelia De Fonteijn. Mary Flamegh’s parents wereSacryas FLAMEN b: ABT 1572 in Valenciennes, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France and Michele SAUVAGIE b: ABT 1574 in Paris, Seine, France.

Jan Jurriaensen Becker, son of Jurrian Becker of Amsterdam, Holland, was born about 1630, died after 1694 and before December 16, 1697. Jan Jurriaensen Becker came to New Amsterdam on the ship \"Solomon\" in 1653. In 1660, he kept school in New Amsterdam and was also a tavernkeeper. He moved to Beverwyck (Albany) in 1661 and was schoolmaster for the patroon. In 1663, he moved to Greenbush where he was Notary Public, Draftsman, Mapmaker, and Surveyor to the Colony of Beverwyck. He was elected City Chamberlain of Albany in 1686, Alderman in 1690 and Treasurer and Public Notary until his death in 1697. His will was dated August 31, 1694, administered December 16, 1697. In it, he mentions his son Johannes and a daughter Martina. Jan Jurriaensen Becker has no known relationship to Hans Jurriaensen Becker, whom Mr. Rickard refers to as the progenitor of Dutch Lineage. The first indication of trouble is a letter from William Beekman (Vice-Director of the South (Delaware) River portion of the New Netherland colony to Director-General Peter Stuyvesant at New Amsterdam, in which he complains about Jan Becker selling liquor to Indians and to soldiers on credit. This letter is dated 8-Nov-1659.\n\nIn a letter from Beekman to Stuyvesant dated 14-Jan-1660, the peeved Vice-Director describes Becker's activity in more detail:\n\n\"...I have to inform your Noble Worship again of the irregularities of Jan Juriaen Becker in selling strong drinks. He incites the soldiers to drunkenness, as he offers to sell them brandy on account or to give them credit and some, principally of the new men, have already spent for drinks 2 or 3 months' wages, before they have been here 6 or 7 weeks, while he takes their bond, wherein is set forth, that he had advanced such a sum for the necessities of life. I have secretly warned him not to do it, whereas they often come to the Fort at night singing and boisterous, also several times quarrels among them have been caused; nevertheless it was continued and I have finally been compelled, to forbid him not to sell any more strong drink by the small measure.\n\nYet it goes on still, although secretly. The said crediting has caused, that two soldiers, being drunk, burned a little Indian canoe, whereupon the natives threatened to set fire to a house or to kill some cattle, so that I was obliged to satisfy them immediately. Nor has he ceased to sell liquor to the natives, notwithstanding that I have several times reproved him for it, so that several difficulties have arisen by it, as on the 7th November, when 6 natives, being quite drunk, made a great commotion in the evening among Jan Becker's neighbors, so that they came to me for assistance: while doing this act of hostility they took from Sander Boyer's house his gun or the Honorable Company's musket, which up to this time I have not been able to recover. The farmers have informed me, that these natives kept going to and from Jan Juriaensen's house the whole afternoon. On the 18th of the same month, Pieter Mayer met far in the woods or bushes a native, who had with him a two-quart-measure full of liquor and said he had bough it from Johannis. The native requesting him to sit down and drink with him, he did so at different times. Next morning this native was found dead a little farther into the woods, the can with a little liquor in it lying near him: hereupon the natives threatened Johannis, as they call him, with death, they said that he had poisoned the native. The declaration of Pieter Mayer, that he had drank several times with him in the afternoon, when the native had bought the liquor, gave some satisfaction to the natives. They placed this dead native upon a hurdle and put it on four great prongs opposite to the house of Jan Juriaensen in the bushes. Some say, that, whereas he has drunk himself to death, he is not yet worthy of a grave, other natives say, that he must curse there the house, where he got the liquor; on the 12th of December, Jan Juriaensen with his wife and girl being at New Amstel, a native came to his house and knocked with a can, which he had with him; two of our soldiers' wives, who live thereabouts, hearing this asked, what he wanted; he said: I bring back the can, which was fetched from here with liquor; he gave the can to the women and requested them to hand it to Johannis: this can was directly brought to me and I know the can very well, as Maria Becker has had it often with her in the canoe, when she went with me to New Amstel.\n\nNevertheless I have not been able to catch him again, since the soldiers are somewhat devoted to him for giving them liquor on credit and other reasons. I dare not let him come near to my papers, especially to copy letters and other things, for he is only a tell-tale: he does not perform any other service here, than to read aloud on Sundays, which I can have done by the Sergeant or any other. If your Honor required him at another place, I can, under correction, miss him here very well. ...\"\n\nThe Trial of Jan Jurriaensen Becker\n\nThe following account is based on information recorded in Documents Relative to the Colonial History of New York , Vol. 12, Dutch and Swedish Settlements at the Delaware River, Fernow, LoC Cat #: 71-93943. It displays a unique slice of life in that remote, rough and ready settlement on the shores of the Delaware River, Fort Altena being located at the site of the current city of Wilmington (this fort was known by the name of Fort Christina by the Swedes who had settled there in 1638, but the Dutch took the fort by force in 1655).\n\nThe Complaint\n\nThe first indication of trouble is a letter from William Beekman (Vice-Director of the South (Delaware) River portion of the New Netherland colony to Director-General Peter Stuyvesant at New Amsterdam, in which he complains about Jan Becker selling liquor to Indians and to soldiers on credit. This letter is dated 8-Nov-1659.\n\nIn a letter from Beekman to Stuyvesant dated 14-Jan-1660, the peeved Vice-Director describes Becker's activity in more detail:\n\n\"...I have to inform your Noble Worship again of the irregularities of Jan Juriaen Becker in selling strong drinks. He incites the soldiers to drunkenness, as he offers to sell them brandy on account or to give them credit and some, principally of the new men, have already spent for drinks 2 or 3 months' wages, before they have been here 6 or 7 weeks, while he takes their bond, wherein is set forth, that he had advanced such a sum for the necessities of life. I have secretly warned him not to do it, whereas they often come to the Fort at night singing and boisterous, also several times quarrels among them have been caused; nevertheless it was continued and I have finally been compelled, to forbid him not to sell any more strong drink by the small measure.\n\nYet it goes on still, although secretly. The said crediting has caused, that two soldiers, being drunk, burned a little Indian canoe, whereupon the natives threatened to set fire to a house or to kill some cattle, so that I was obliged to satisfy them immediately. Nor has he ceased to sell liquor to the natives, notwithstanding that I have several times reproved him for it, so that several difficulties have arisen by it, as on the 7th November, when 6 natives, being quite drunk, made a great commotion in the evening among Jan Becker's neighbors, so that they came to me for assistance: while doing this act of hostility they took from Sander Boyer's house his gun or the Honorable Company's musket, which up to this time I have not been able to recover. The farmers have informed me, that these natives kept going to and from Jan Juriaensen's house the whole afternoon. On the 18th of the same month, Pieter Mayer met far in the woods or bushes a native, who had with him a two-quart-measure full of liquor and said he had bough it from Johannis. The native requesting him to sit down and drink with him, he did so at different times. Next morning this native was found dead a little farther into the woods, the can with a little liquor in it lying near him: hereupon the natives threatened Johannis, as they call him, with death, they said that he had poisoned the native. The declaration of Pieter Mayer, that he had drank several times with him in the afternoon, when the native had bought the liquor, gave some satisfaction to the natives. They placed this dead native upon a hurdle and put it on four great prongs opposite to the house of Jan Juriaensen in the bushes. Some say, that, whereas he has drunk himself to death, he is not yet worthy of a grave, other natives say, that he must curse there the house, where he got the liquor; on the 12th of December, Jan Juriaensen with his wife and girl being at New Amstel, a native came to his house and knocked with a can, which he had with him; two of our soldiers' wives, who live thereabouts, hearing this asked, what he wanted; he said: I bring back the can, which was fetched from here with liquor; he gave the can to the women and requested them to hand it to Johannis: this can was directly brought to me and I know the can very well, as Maria Becker has had it often with her in the canoe, when she went with me to New Amstel.\n\nNevertheless I have not been able to catch him again, since the soldiers are somewhat devoted to him for giving them liquor on credit and other reasons. I dare not let him come near to my papers, especially to copy letters and other things, for he is only a tell-tale: he does not perform any other service here, than to read aloud on Sundays, which I can have done by the Sergeant or any other. If your Honor required him at another place, I can, under correction, miss him here very well. ...\"\n\nThe Investigation\n\nThe governing council at New Amsterdam gave the following instructions to Nicasius de Sille, who was being sent to the South River to prosecute the murderers of some Indians who had been killed, which created a crisis: \"...Whereas at different times several complaints have reached our ears against Jan Juriaensen Becker and his wife in regard to the sale of brandy to the natives, whereby already several difficulties have been originated and more are to be apprehended, he shall, in presence of the gentlemen accompanying him, Mr. Paulus Lendertsen vad de Grist, Ex-Burgomaster and Jacob Backer, managing Scheepen of this City, inquire of the Commissary Beekman and others, whom it concerns and at the same time examine the said Commissary, why the said Jan Juriaensen Becker is not, for his assistance, employed as secretary or clerk, for which he was expressly sent and engaged. If he discovers any evidence, proof and sufficient reason for the one or the other he is to bring here the said Becker, that further proceedings and measures may be taken against him according to law and his deserts. ...\"\n\nThe Indictment\n\nIndictment of and Proceedings against Jan Juriansen Becker for selling liquor to the Indians, and Papers connected with his case.\n\nTo their noble Worships, the Director-General and Council of New Netherland.\n\nHonorable, Noble, very Worshipful Gentlemen,\n\nWhereas Jan Juriaensen Becker of Amsterdam, residing outside of Fort Altena on the South River, has at present been brought here by the undersigned Fiscal, because he did not hesitate, contrary to the strict interdict and in contempt of the issued and repeated placats of Director-General and Council of N.N., to sell brandy to the natives, for which he has long been notorious, as the evidences extant thereof sufficiently prove, viz. the declarations by Bartolomeus Aertse, Jan du Parck, and Pieter Klaessen of 14th of October 1659, also the declarations of the 18th of November 1659 and of Janneke Baernts and Teuntje Jurriaens of the 12th of December 1659 further the affidavits of Jeams Andriesen and Mary Andriesen of the 7th of March of this year; and whereas this is a matter of very bad consequences, from which, as is found by experience, a great deal of mishap has resulted and more is to be expected, unless it be stopped and punished according to the placats as an example to others; therefore the Fiscal concludes ex officio, that Jan Jurriaensen Becker be brought to the place, where sentences are usually executed, be put there into the pillory with a brandy-measure around his neck and also be sentenced to pay a fine of five hundred guilders according to the Placats and to be banished this province, but be kept in prison provisionally, until your Honorable Worships' sentence or finding shall be executed. Done at Fort Amsterdam, the 1st of April, 1660.\n\nYour Honorable Worships' servant,\n\nNicasius de Sille\n\nThe Plea\n\nTo Their Honorable, Noble Worships, the Director-General and Council of New Netherland\n\nHonorable, Noble, Very Worshipful Gentlemen,\n\nThe defendant denies upon the true word of man, that in contempt of your Noble Honorable Worships' placats he has sold brandy to the natives, much less made a profession of it whereby he should, since a long time, have become notorious; but it is thus, that the persons, who have declared and testified this of him through secret hatred and envy, they belong mostly to those, who deserve no or only little credence, to with Bartolomeus Aertse, Jean du Parck and Pieter Claessen are soldiers, who had been sent out by Mrs. Beekman with a native, having Mr. Beekman's own can, to impose upon him, the defendant, pretending, that he had the consent of the said gentleman, to get brandy, which however he did not receive. Pieter Mayer is inclined to the party, as he himself makes it a profession to sell brandy to the natives, with which Mr. Beeckman is not unacquainted. Jannetje Barentsen is likewise not impartial, having at present a lawsuit with the defendant about a case of theft committed by her. Teuntje Jeuriansen is notoriously disreputable, as she has been in the service of disreputable people, for instance in that of Margareth Davits, alias the Scotch Woman, herself a known prostitute and keeping a thieves' den. Jams Andriesen and Maria Andriesen, being ... man and wife, have been forbidden by the former Swedish Commander, Jan Rysingh, to appear before his court on account of their troublesome and slandering talk. Consequently it is nothing but envy and villainy, with which they have tried to bespatter the defendant and to make him hated by your Honorable Worships; for having formerly by your Honorable Worships' favor provisionally filled the position of Commissary, he is therefore until now considered as a chief by the natives and hence he is often given by the native Sachems a goose, a duck or a deer or a turkey, in return for which, it is true, the defendant never hesitated to give or present them a drink of brandy, but that only to such Sachems, as Meckeck Schinck, Wechenarent, Areweehingh and Hoppaming etc. whom neither Dutchmen nor Swedes disdain openly to provide with liquor or to drink with at the tavern, which is done so free, frank and open, as anything, that is allowed, can be done, consequently the defendant never conjectured, that he made himself liable to punishment thereby, the more so as such bartering, even the sale of brandy was there a common and necessary custom, as can be seen formt the annexed affidavit, and if the Honorable Fiscal had been pleased to inform himself more in this respect on the South River, he would most likely have found no or only few persons among the Dutch as well as the Swedish nation, who were exempt from (the charge of) selling liquor to the natives, because without it is hard to get provisions. The defendant prays therefore very humbly, that what has passed as related above may not be charged to him, an old servant of the Company, as a misdemeanor, but if there was nay wrong in it, that it might be graciously overlooked, as having been done in ignorance and not through contempt of your Noble, Honorable Worships' placats and ordinances, while he promises to avoid in future this and all other mistakes.\n\nThus doing, etc., Amsterdam in N. Netherland, 12th of April, 1660.\n\nYour Noble Honorable Worships' obedient servant,\n\nJan Jeuriaens Becker\n\nThe Judgment\n\nJan Becker remained imprisoned waiting for the next sitting of the court on the 26th of April, when the following judgment was handed down:\n\n\"Whereas Jan Juriaens Becker, former Clerk and Reader in the service of the Honorable Priv. West-India Company at Fort Altena on the South River of New Netherland, has not hesitated, contrary to the strict interdict and in contempt of the repeatedly published placats of Director-General and Council of New Netherland, to sell and trade strong liquors to the natives, which is a matter of very bad consequences and influences, whereby at different times and places many mishaps have resulted and occurred and therefore can and must not be suffered, but must be punished as an example to others, Resolved that Director-General and Council of New Netherland after examination of the Fiscal's complaint and the defendant's, Jan Juriaensen Becker's, own admission and confession and after consideration of everything, which has to be considered in this case, administer justice in the name of their High Mightinesses the Lords States-General of the United Netherlands and theh Noble Lords-Directors of the Priv. West-India Company, Department of Amsterdam, and sentence, as they hereby do, the aforesaid Jan Juriaensen Becker to the payment of a fine of five hundred guilders to be applied according to the tenor of the placats issued against the sale of liquor to the natives; they further degrade the said Becker from his office as Clerk and Reader and order, that as quickly as possible he and his wife break up their household and remove from the said South River, also pay the costs and expenses of law incurred hereby, while they reject the further complaint fo the Fiscal.\n\nMercy of the Court\n\nUpon hearing Jan Becker's appeal and considering the affidavit, which showed still more evidence that he was right concerning the widespread sale of liquor to the natives, the following decree was promulgated:\n\n\"The above petition was taken up and read and after deliberating upon it and considering the petitioner's circumstances, the question having been put it was decreed:\n\nThe petitioner is for reasons relieved of the payment of the fine, provided that he arranges with the Honorable Fiscal for the costs and mises of the law.\n\nDone at Amsterdam in New Netherland, the 3rd of May, 1660.\"\n\nJan Becker, his wife Maria and young daughter would remain in New Amsterdam for another year or so.

Records,Wills, I., p.211.\n\nRef: The Early Records of Albany and Colony of Rensselaerwyck, 1916,\n\nThe University of the State of New York\n\n\"Paulus Martense Van Benthuysen is listed as a witness to a deed on pages 353 and 18. A footnote on page 18, where the name is signed as Paulis Marten, reads, 'This signature is the same as that of Paulus Martense Van Benthuysen, and as that of Paulus Martense Van Rynsburch.' Benthuysen, or Benthuizen, is a village about six miles southeast of Leiden. Rynsburch, or Rjnsburg, is the name of a village and of an ancient and wealthy abbey, three miles northwest of Leiden. This abbey had large landed possessions in various parts of the province of South Holland. The natural inference, therefore, is that Paulaus Martensen came from the vicinity of the abbey of Ben- thuysen, but from the land which belonged to the jurisdiction of the Rynsburch. Footnote: pg 32, Raemaecker is a contraction of Rademaecker meaning 'wheelwright'.\n\nPaulus took the name of Van Benthuysen when he imigrated from Holland between 1646 and 1654. Van Benthuysen means\"of the city of Benthuizen. His last name was Oem.

Elisabeth was his second wife. Pacasius Justus Turcq was a Physician. He was born in Flandres. He wandered through Europe and studied literature at the unversities of Rome, Bologna, Padua, and Pavia. In his time he was known a gifted and civilized man, a perfect humanist. He was often seen as a guest at the royal courts of Europe. In Pavia, in the year 1561 he wrote his best known book: Pascasii Justi de Alea, sive de curanda ludendi in pecuniam cupiditate (The game of dice by Pascasius Justus from Eeklo, Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine, being two books discussing a way to cure people from the passion of playing for money). The book was printed in Basel [Swi], reprinted in 1616 in Frankfurt [Ger], and again in Amsterdam in 1642.After writing this book, he took up residence in Bergen op Zoom and was subscribed to the Guild of St. Anthony. There he became court-physician of Jan IV, marquis of Bergen op Zoom. From October 28, 1562 he also was designated \"Master of Medicine of the City\". Still later he became the court-physician of the Duke of Anjou-Alencon, an ally of prince William of Orange. When the latter got severely wounded in an assasination attempt by Jean Jaurequy on March 18, 1582, Turcq was able to stop the Prince?s bleeding. From that time on he was on a friendly basis with Prince William. His son Israel from his first wife was Mayor of Bergen.\n\nTURK: A combination of an extraction project of the TURK Surname Society, focusing on New York State, along with the Y-DNA results of a couple of TURK Surname Y-DNA project members, who relate as seventh cousins and descend from Paulus Jacobszen TURCK (1635-1703), have seemingly identified this lineage’s Haplogroup, which has been confirmed by an SNP as G2. FTDNA defines the G2 Haplogroup as:\n\nThis lineage may have originated in India or Pakistan, and has dispersed into central Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The G2 branch of this lineage (containing the P15 mutation) is found most often in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nChronology, geography and Y-DNA seem to suggest that the origin of this branch of the TURK surname is grounded in the Spanish Netherlands with genetic roots reaching into Moorish Spain. The year 1500 is frequently associated with the rather general emergence of surnames in Western Europe. The terms “Turk” and “Moor” were frequently used interchangeably. It seems plausible that this is the root origin of the early New York Turk family name. 1. Records of Nancy Turk, 519 S. Main, Sycamore, IL 60178, (815) 895-8484, [email protected] [TURCQ].\n\n2.
