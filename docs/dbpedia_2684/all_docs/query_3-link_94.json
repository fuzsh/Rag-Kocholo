        "text": "Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans (Montagne) de Bary is the most serious disease in Japanese potato cultivation. Heavy infection of foliages and tubers by this pathogen leads to severe losses of potato quality and yield. As a result, control strategies for late blight in Japan often rely on the application of fungicides. The total chemical treated area for potato late blight was 389,485 ha and 15 active ingredients including 55 formulations are currently registered for the control of potato late blight in April, 2007. Because of growing public concerns, a major focus has been placed on ways to protect the environment. Therefore, integrated management of potato late blight plays an increasingly important role for control in Japan. Fungicide use is the most effective measure and will be one of the best long-term solutions in the control of late blight. To meet current requirements such as high efficacy, cost reduction, labor reduction and environmental protection for disease control, new technology has been required. Efforts, such as trying to develop safer and more effective products, formulations, and spray techniques for the control of late blight will open the way for improved control of the disease. This paper reviews potato cultivation, late blight pathogen, potato cultivars, chemical application and fungicides for the control of potato late blight in Japan.\n\nPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) has been remained an important agricultural crop in resolving global food issues through decades. The crop has experienced enormous growth in terms of production throughout the world in recent decades because of improvement in agricultural mechanization, fertilizers application and irrigation practices. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of this valuable crop is still vulnerable to losses due to prevalence of different viral, bacterial, fungal and nematodes infestations. Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is one of the most threatening pathogenic diseases which not only results in direct crop losses but also cause farmers to embrace huge monetary expenses for disease control and preventive measures. The disease is well known for notorious 'Irish Famine' which resulted in drop of Irish population by more than 20% as result of hunger and potato starvation. Globally, annual losses of crop and money spend on fungicides for late blight control exceeds one trillion US dollars. This paper reviews the significance of late blight of potato and controlling strategies adopted for minimizing yield losses incurred by this disease by the use of synthetic fungicides. Advantages and disadvantages of fungicides application are discussed.\n\nIn times of increasing societal pressure to reduce the application of pesticides on crops, demands for environmentally friendly replacements have intensified. In the case of late blight, a devastating potato plant disease, the historically most widely known plant destroyer has been the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. To date, the most important strategy for control of this pathogen has been the frequent application of fungicides. Due to the aforementioned necessity to move away from traditional chemical treatments, many studies have focused on finding alternative ecofriendly biocontrol systems. In general, due to the different modes of actions (i.e. antagonistic effects or induction of plant defencemechanisms), the use ofmicroorganisms as biological control agents has a definite potential. Amongst them, several species of lactic acid bacteria have been recognised as producers of bioactive metabolites which are functional against a broad spectrum of undesirable microorganisms, such as fungi, oomycetes and other bacteria. Thus, they may represent an interesting tool for the development of novel concepts in pest management. This review describes the present situation of late blight disease and summarises current literature regarding the biocontrol of the phytopathogen P. infestans using antagonistic microorganisms."
