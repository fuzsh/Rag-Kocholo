        "text": "Streetlight from Priess Solar A/S standalone solar-columns. By an access road around a greenhouse complex, three 8-metre Plectre Sun columns were installed in January 2021. The access road is located in a three-road system and is angled at 90 degrees behind the greenhouses. Plectre sun columns have been placed at the 90-degree bends and at the end of the road in order to alert traffic to the curves in the road.\n\nEach Solar column is remotely monitored via the Priess cloud log service, enabled by internet access (GSM access) on the Master control units. This means a service team will be warned in the event of any operational failures and will be able to then act accordingly as soon as a problem occurs."
