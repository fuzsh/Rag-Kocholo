        "text": "Hi Pierre,\n\nHow interesting that you found my message posted in 2005. It has been floating around in Cyber Space for over 4 years. I also, recently, received an e-mail from a distant relative, in Switzerland, who also found my message on the net.\n\nAmazing!\n\nI visited Holland last year (2008) along with a sister and my daughter. We went to Dinteloord, where our great grandfather and a few generations before him, lived.\n\nThere are still dozens of “Sulkers” families living in that town, south of Rotterdam, in North Brabant. We met a number of “Sulkers” there, but unfortunately the church in that town was bombed and burned, during WWII and all of the old town records were destroyed.\n\nWe were able to get the direct line of the “Sulkers” family from other sources and I now have our family tree back to the early 1700’s.\n\nThere are no stories attached, unfortunately, but I do have names, dates of birth and death.\n\nI also have a copy of an article printed on godutch.com, published on June 23, 2003. This gives a little of Herm’s family history. You could possibly find this on their website or contact Vanderheide Publishing Co. Ltd. at 1-800-881-0705. It is a copyright article.\n\nI have read all of the information that you sent to me and some of it is new to me.\n\nI thank you for passing on the stories of other men that survived the sinking of the Athabaskan. Herm was among those hauled out of the water and taken as a POW. The family didn’t know if he lived or died until those prisoners were rescued at the end of the war. Herm didn’t talk much about those days, but I do remember him saying that bombers from both the Allies and the Enemy, flew over them every day and they never knew when the facility that they were imprisoned in, would be bombed, perhaps even by the Allied planes.\n\nIt must have been hell on earth for those men.\n\nAgain, thank you for your e-mail.\n\nLet me know when you publish your next article about Herm.\n\nI’d love to read it.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nEv Howard.\n\nWell, now you know who is Evelyn…\n\nI warn you again…\n\nGenealogy is addictive, so is my blog…\n\nIt’s not to late to stop…\n\nProceed with caution…\n\nAhead one-third…\n\nFull speed ahead…\n\nAflevering 2.\n\nHerman Sulkers kan ook benaderd worden via email (veel 83-jarigen kunnen dat tegenwoordig) via athabaskan1@shaw.ca.\n\nWie brengt hem in het contact met naamgenoten en mogelijk achterneven en -nichten.\n\nZ’n opa en oma vertrokken ongeveer 110 jaar geleden uit D’oord naar omgeving Zaandam vanwaar in 1910 naar Winnipeg, Canada!\n\nDinteloorders, groot nieuws!\n\nEen nazaat van een gezin uit Dinteloord, dat van Hermanus Sulkers (geb. 22 april 1852) en Maria Johanna Vriens hoopt in juli 2003 vanuit het verre Canada waar hij 83 jaar geleden geboren is, Dinteloord te bezoeken.\n\nNatuurlijk is hij op zoek naar verre familieleden en kan daarbij hulp gebruiken.\n\nHij en twee nichten zijn al een paar jaar aan het vroeten naar hun ‘roots.’\n\nMy Dutch is not that good…\n\nBut in this forum post I know that Hermanus Sulkers (geb. 22 april 1852) means Hermanus Sulkers (born 22 April 1852).\n\nWe now have Herm’s grandfather’s birthdate.\n\nThis is a translation done on an Internet translation site…\n\nEpisode 2.\n\nHerman Sulkers can also be accessed via email (many 83 year olds can do nowadays) via athabaskan1@shaw.ca.\n\nWho brings him into contact with possible namesakes and nephews and nieces. His grandparents left about 110 years ago, D’haven from which to nearby Zaandam in 1910 to Winnipeg, Canada!\n\nDinteloorders, great news!\n\nA descendant of a family from Dinteloord that of Hermanus Sulkers (born April 22, 1852) and Maria Johanna Vriens hopes in July 2003 from the remote Canada where he was born 83 years ago, Dinteloord visit. Of course he is looking for distant relatives and can thereby help.\n\nHe and two cousins have been a few years to Vroet to their roots.\n\nWell, I think we get the message…\n\nIt says that Herm is going to visit Holland.\n\nNow for my inbox…\n\nThis was in it…\n\nThanks for the e-mail!\n\nYes, I know the history of the Athabaskan and Herm Sulkers, my first cousin, was a wonderful guy. We shared a lot of family history information during Herm’s later years. I have a number of articles about Herm and the Athabaskan. I’m not sure which ones you posted, but thanks for writing, anyway.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nEv Howard\n\nI sent her this message…\n\nHi,\n\nI was looking for more information about Herm on the Internet and I found your message posted in 2005.\n\nI took a chance to help you in your search. Have you found more ancestors in Holland other than Hermanus?\n\nTomorrow I will write an article on my blog about Herm’s genealogy.\n\nhttp://athabaskang07.wordpress.com/\n\nHerman Sulkers was a great man and my articles on him are to pay homage to a man who served\n\nhis country. My wife’s uncle was also on the Athabaskan. He’s 81 but he doesn’t want to talk about the ordeal\n\nhe went through. He said he was rescue by the Haida.\n\nMy blog Lest We Forget pays homage to him and to his comrades.\n\nPierre Lagacé\n\nNow we are going somewhere, maybe to Holland… Who knows?\n\nSee you tomorrow.\n\nUpdated 1 September 2022\n\nWelcome if you just came in from my blog on wartime memories.\n\nIf you did not, then I have another blog about war memories. It is called Lest We Forget…\n\nWhile doing my articles on Herm Sulkers, I found this on the Internet about him.\n\nThis is the message… It appears to be a newspaper article. I added the picture.\n\nDigging up Dutch roots new pastime for Winnipeg-born senior\n\nCHILLIWACK, British Columbia –\n\nDiscovering family roots for the North American Dutch often is a tedious process. It covers great distances and could span a lifetime. The need to know did not come overnight to third-generation Dutch Canadian, Winnipeg-born Hermannus Sulkers, now 83, but became more compelling when he, accompanied by his daughters Catherine and Jane, in 1998 visited the Netherlands for the first time. He returned home with more questions than answers about his ancestors. This summer, another trip, his fourth, has been planned when he hopes with two sons to link up with namesakes in ancestral Dinteloord, a village south of national nature park Biesbosch.\n\nComplicating Herm’s searches are a lack of sufficient fluency in the Dutch language, no known family and the fact that his grandparents launched their overseas venture from a different place than their ancestral town.\n\nThe Sulkers family left in stages for Canada from around Zaandam. In 1906, their 17-year-old son Herb left for Winnipeg to be followed two years later by siblings John, Cornelis and Antonia. In 1910, their Dinteloord-born parents Hermannus and Maria Johanna Sulkers (Vriens) embarked for Canada on the ship S.S. Victorian with eight of their other nine children. The one daughter who had stayed behind died in 1945 and was buried in Zeist.\n\nS.S. Victorian\n\nReturn to Netherlands\n\nGrandfather Sulkers soon deeply regretted his emigration to Canada and was troubled over the family’s separation from the daughter who because of health reasons had been denied permission to come along. He died fairly soon after arriving in the country. In the early decades of the twentieth country, a significant number of Dutch immigrants around Winnipeg, like their counterparts near Chicago, made a living as market gardeners. They and most of the Sulkers’ grew vegetables which they sold in the city, usually off the back of their horse-drawn wagon or truck. Although a steady trickle of newcomers joined the Dutch community of Winnipeg, few went the opposite direction. Herm’s father Peter and his mother went in 1951. Of the others who did, it will be quite safe to state, nearly all had joined the Canadian war effort, Herm as a navyman on Canadian destroyer Athabaskan. Following of a disastrous naval battle during which the ship was sunk off the French coast in May 1944, Herm was rescued and send to a German POW camp. While he never came close to setting a foot on Dutch soil then, Sulkers’ interest in Athabaskan commemmorations and reunions eventually brought him back to Europe.\n\nBiesbosch\n\nThis year’s visit to Dinteloord will be Sulkers’ second. Accompanied by a fellow Dutch genealogy enthusiast who has assisted him with his research he had no contacts for the first visit to the 17th century village in Prinsenlandpolder (so named after a son of Prince William I, the Taciturn, who spearheaded the diking project for the area around 1600). With help from sources in Canada, Sulkers learnt that his surname is most common in a half-moon around the Biesbosch where his upcoming visit already has been announced.\n\nSulkers’ grandparents with their four eldest children left Dinteloord during the 1890s for a farm job in the Zaandam vicinity, likely joining others who had migrated there earlier (the Haarlemmermeer reclamation works of 150 years ago also attracted people from the Western part of Brabant). Circumstances around Dinteloord in the late 1800s were far from ideal for farm labourers.\n\nLink to the ship…\n\nFootnote:\n\nI found the article thanks to Evelyn.\n\nThis is the link.\n\nWho is Evelyn? I found her in Cyber space…\n\nAnother footnote:\n\nI found the Sulker family on Elmwood street in Winnipeg in the 1911 census.\n\nClick here for the image file.\n\nThis is part of the page.\n\nThe picture is fuzzy but we can see the Sulkers came from Holland. Mary Sulkers (Vriens) came in 1910 with some of her children while others came in 1909 and Herbert in 1907.\n\nIn the census we have an Anton, a son, but the article says Antonia came to Canada. It’s a woman’s name. Is there an error in the census? I found many errors while searching in censuses…\n\nI will dig in for more information about the Sulkers…\n\nStay tune…"
