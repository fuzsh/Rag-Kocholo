        "text": "The Memorial was placed at the Raadhuisplein with a bronze plaque.\n\nThe Memorial exists of a bronze statue group of a standing men figure, a kneeling women figure and a lying down child figure. The statue is a symbol for the pain that World War Two caused. The desperate woman grieves for a lost or wounded child, the man tries to comfort her and points out to a future in freedom.\n\nThe Memorial was found in memory of the 55 fellow citizens who died in the occupation years by acts of war.\n\nThe text on the Memorial reads:\n\nIn memory of all victims in our community 1940 - 1945\n\nDo you have more information about this location?
