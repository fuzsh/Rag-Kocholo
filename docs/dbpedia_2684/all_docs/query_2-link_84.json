        "text": "Gerard VanSaarloos, 5 November 1934 to 4 March 2021\n\nIt is with sadness that we announce the passing of Gerard VanSaarloos at the Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre on 4 March 2021, in his 87th year. Gerard was the loving husband of Ruth (nee Wolfraim) and the late Conny (nee denHaan); proud father of Wilma (Bruce) and Alice (Robert); Opa to Kirsti, James, Theodore (Rose), Victoria and Jennifer; and stepfather to David (Carol), Sandra (Scott) and Debbie. Mourning his passing in the Netherlands are his younger brothers, Ad (Katerina), Ger, and Hans (Lutgart), many nieces and nephews, and extended family. He was predeceased by his parents Herbert and Tanneke and granddaughter Caitlin.\n\nDad was born in Dinteloord, the Netherlands. Having survived the occupation of Holland during the Second World War, his hometown was liberated by the Canadians on his 10th birthday, a story he retold every year. What a wonderful birthday present. While helping to clean up after the great flood of 1953, Dad got to know the prettiest girl in Dinteloord. They started dating and, in 1961, after completing his compulsory military service, Gerard married Conny. A short 6 weeks later they departed on the SS Rijndam destined for Canada, where they settled in Barrie.\n\nDad and Mom lived in various locations around Barrie before buying a house in 1967. Dad was always very handy and always keeping busy. His pride and joy was the family room he helped build onto the back of the house. Dad enjoyed the family camping vacations to places in Canada and the US. He loved having family from the Netherlands come visit and showing them around his new homeland. In later years, he and mom travelled to the Netherlands frequently.\n\nIn Barrie, Dad worked several jobs before he was hired by Canadian General Electric. He stayed at CGE for most of his working life, even after they were bought out by Black & Decker. When B&D left, Dad and Mom decided to stay in Barrie and Dad secured a job with the Canadian Standards Association in Toronto. Dad loved the work but the commute was hard and he retired in 1994. After he retired, Dad started his own business, GV Video Transfers. Dad loved helping people transfer slides and 8mm movies to VHS and DVD.\n\nWith some free time in retirement, and after Momâs passing, Dad returned to playing the piano. He had learned to play at a young age and entertained many people at events in Holland as a young man. He also taught piano to many children in Barrie in the 1970âs. Dad played piano for the Kiwanas and the Simcoe Songsters, and during various events at Collier United Church. Dadâs love of music and playing the piano drew him to another music lover, Ruth. They developed a friendship and eventually married in 2011. Dad and Ruth enjoyed travelling together to visit family across Canada, and in the Netherlands and New Zealand.\n\nDad finally moved out of the only house he ever bought after 52 years to a new life at Allandale Station Retirement Home. Unfortunately, the pandemic meant many periods of isolation, but he didnât complain and was happy to be taken care of in his new home and looked forward to when he could visit with family again.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at RVH, at Barrie Manor (Bayshore side), and at Allandale Station Retirement Residence for all the wonderful care provided to Dad over the last year. It hasnât been easy but there have been so many examples of human kindness and going above and beyond to make the best of a difficult time. We are eternally grateful.\n\nInternment will take place at Midhurst Union Cemetery later in the spring,\n\nAs an expression of sympathy, memorial donations may be made to the Salvation Army or your local food bank."
