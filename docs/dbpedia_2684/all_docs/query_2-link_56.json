Largest cities are 's-Hertogenbosch (provincial capital), Eindhoven, Tilburg and Breda. Until recently this was a predominantly catholic and agricultural province. To a large extent the current province has its roots in the old duchy of Brabant. In the west were two manorials with a relatively big autonomy, the Marquisate of Bergen op Zoom and the Barony of Breda, while the east belonged to the Meierij of 's-Hertogenbosch, which remained the unquestioned territory of the duke, although the area was divided in four sections (Kwartieren), each ruled by a nobleman in name of the duke. With the partition of the Netherlands in a northern and a southern part in 1648, the new border ran over the territory of the former duchy. The northern part of Brabant came under the rule of the Republic and was ruled as a colony directly from Holland, while the south of Brabant remained a flourishing part of the Habsburg empire, first under Spanish, later under Austrian rule. In 1795, thanks to an invasion by the French, equal rights were restored to the citizens of this part of Brabant and the region Bataafs-Brabant (\"Batavian Brabant\") was formed. When most of the Northern and Southern Netherlands were reunited again from 1815 until 1830, the old Brabant was not, but remained partitioned into various provinces, including Noord-Brabant. The current province however is a little more than just the northern part of the former duchy of Brabant. In the north two former parts of Holland were added to its territory. These were the regions Land van Heusden and Altena, with towns such as Werkendam and Woudrichem, and the Langstraat, with towns like Geertruidenberg and Heusden. These two regions form the predominantly protestant northern part of the province. From the province of Zeeland came a tiny part with the village of Nieuw-Vossemeer. Furthermore, a few former enclaves in the east were added to the new province. These were the territories of Bokhoven, Megen, Ravenstein, Uden, Gemert and Boxmeer, all of which had managed to stay outside the Republic until the French occupation of 1795 and had known freedom of religion, resulting in a surviving catholic culture there. Excluded from the province of Noord-Brabant are a few small enclaves in the mid-south of the province, which together are called Baarle-Hertog and belong to Belgium."
