        "text": "Reviews:\n\n''La Leyenda'' (English: ''The Legend'') is the name of the 66th posthumous release and 3rd box set from the Tejano pop singer Selena that was released by Capitol Latin/EMI and Q-Productions labels. The album was released on March 9, 2010. This box set was released in three formats: a four-disc box set, a two-disc special-edition album, and a single-disc album. According to Suzette Quintanilla's YouTube video, EMI teamed up with Q-Productions (a division of Selena's father's recording studio) to release this box set, and Quintanilla asks Selena fans around the world to contribute a special message to Selena that may or may not be included in the new box set. The Box-sets will contain an exclusive \"Selena\" charm and four booklets that include messages from Selena's family, friends, and fans from around the world. Selena fans around the world were told to collaborate pictures of themselves to be part of the ''La Leyenda'' bound books, but in early February 2010, Q-Productions and EMI Latin decided to cancel the transaction due to legal actions with copyrighted images from fans. - Wikipedia"
