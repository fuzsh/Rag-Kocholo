        "text": "It's official. Nov. 3 is now Selena Day in Los Angeles. The iconic Mexican American singer, Selena Quintanilla, is getting her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Friday night, 22 years after her death.\n\nKnown as the \"Queen of Tejano Music,\" Selena rose to fame in the early nineties as a Spanish language singer. Her crossover into English pop was cut short when she was killed by the former president of her fan club. She was only 23 years old.\n\nToday, Selena's memory is alive and well, Justino Aguila of Billboard magazine told Take Two. He was joined by Deborah Paredez, author of \"Selenidad: Selena, Latinos, and the Performance of Memory,\" and KPCC listeners Angelica Reyes, Lorena Bernal Cowell, Victor Lomeli, Lauren Romero, Silvia Nevarez, Claudia Pena and Valeria Sanchez.\n\n\"Selena was definitely somebody who changed the game,\" Aguila said. \"The '90s was also a time when I think Latin music was trying to figure it out. What do we want? Who’s our base? Is to going to expand? Is it English? Is it bilingual? And so her influence I think helped carry Latin music to a different place where it was accessible.\"\n\nAlthough her initial rise to fame was within the Spanish language genre, Selena didn't speak Spanish fluently as a child. \"Like a lot of Tejanas who grew up in the United States, she struggled with Spanish and this produced a tentativeness with the language and a feeling of insecurity sometimes around our place as Latinos,\" Paredez said. \"What was so amazing about Selena is that she performed publicly that struggle with Spanish saying, ‘Estoy muy excited.’ And that moment of endearing vulnerability provided, for so many of us like her, this opportunity to say, it’s okay that we share this linguistic neither-here-nor-there-ness with regards to Spanish and English.\"\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nSelena was especially meaningful to Latino audiences in the U.S. for providing a positive and empowered representation in the media. Listener Lauren Romero remembers a famous scene from the Selena biopic starring Jennifer Lopez. Edward James Olmos played Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Sr.\n\nRomero thought that Olmos said it the best. \"You have to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the Americans. Nobody knows how tough it is be a Mexican-American.\"\n\nSelena's untimely death hit her fans hard. Deborah Paredez thinks that in part, \"Selena’s death, and her life, provided an opportunity for many of us to celebrate some of the promises that our future might hold. But also to have a kind of sanctioned space to grieve. Not just for the loss we felt with her absence but the many losses that our lives were marked by.\"\n\nParedez also thinks that Selena continues to stay relevant as a public figure because Latinos continue to face the same challenges in the U.S.\n\n\"Part of her legacy and her resurgence I think at this particular moment has a lot to do with the similarities to the particular political moment we’re living in now – between now and the 1990s,\" Paredez said. \"It’s a moment of extreme anti-immigrant and especially anti-Latino rhetoric in mainstream political culture. Being drawn to Selena give us this opportunity to mourn that ongoing and very resurgent situation.\"\n\nIt's true, Selena's fans still look to her as a role model all these years later.\n\nThe dedication ceremony for Selena's star is Friday at 6:30 p.m. in front of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood."
