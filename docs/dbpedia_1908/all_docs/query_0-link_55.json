        "text": "As a first-generation Mexican-American growing up in the ’90s, it was empowering and rare to see a Latinx such as Selena Quintanilla on mainstream television. She was even dubbed the “Mexican Madonna” by tv journalist Tom Brokaw. Although no disrespect to Brokaw, Selena Quintanilla is an artist in her own right.\n\nSo in honor of the queen of Tejano’s would be her 48th birthday today, we wanted to honor and commemorate her legacy, which will always live on thanks to her timeless music. We remember Selena the way we know best, through her music, so we’ve compiled a list of our favorite 10 Best Selena Quintanilla songs. Although we wish we could list them all.\n\nGod’s Child (Baila Conmigo) Featuring David Byrne\n\nThis obscure track introduced me to the Talking Heads legend at a young age. Little known fact, written by Byrne with the help of Selena and recorded before Selena’s murder. I was completely enamored and fascinated with this sultry track, its prominent bassline, and a distinct drumbeat that is classic Byrne’s.\n\nBesides being featured on the soundtrack for the film Blue in the Face, it’s also on Selena’s posthumous album Dreaming of You. You’d never think that Selena and David Byrnes go together, yet their voices are perfectly intertwined and compliment the other.\n\nVen Conmigo\n\nThis song takes me back to Mexico. Such richness is evident with the cumbia/ranchera hybrid. Selena y Los Dinos’ musical composition continued to evolve, and this track showcased Selena’s voice.\n\nVen Conmigo was her first to be certified gold by the RIAA (the 1990 album would eventually receive double-platinum certification, which helped dissolve the male hierarchy in the typically sexist Tejano music industry where women were commercially inferior.\n\nAdditionally, it also ended the long-standing view that a female performer could not draw comparable audiences to a man for the genre. In an interview with Joe Nick Patoski, Selena had this to say, “The more doors they shut on us, the more determined we became. We’ve just started seeing a change.”\n\nBaila Esta Cumbia\n\nThis irresistible song is hard not to dance along to, even if you have no rhythm, do the “washing machine.” It’s a perfect cumbia song composed by Selena’s brother AB Quintanilla y Los Dinos backup vocalist, Pete Astudillo. AB even remixed it with his band Kumbia Kings that I played to death back in the days. They also performed it for Selena Vive with Selena’s widower, Chris Perez.\n\nNo Me Queda Mas\n\nThe string arrangement in this track is stunningly beautiful. The earnest heartache captivates the listener and connects through something we’ve all been through, a love that fizzles. No Me Queda Mas is one of those songs that you blast at full volume when you’re trying to get over a breakup. The mariachi version is even more heartfelt and, best of all, in my humble opinion.\n\nBidi Bidi Bom Bom\n\nMy favorite song as a kid; I even remember watching the music video for the first time. I also remember watching Sabado Gigante just for her (and for the chacal, but I digress) and learning the meaning behind the song, “It’s the sound the heart makes when you see a man pass by. It sounds like, ‘Bidi bidi bom bom,’ ” Selena told Don Francisco.\n\nLa Llamada\n\nLa Llamada’s my older sister’s favorite song; I remember we’d be driving in her silver Mustang and listening to this on repeat. We’re big fans of the kick-him-to-the-curb anthems that didn’t put up with cheating men, and this song was our go-to whenever we’re healing our broken hearts.\n\nDonde Quiera Que Estes (Wherever You Are) featuring Barrio Boyzz\n\nFirstly, I remember watching this music video when I was younger, enthralled, and even tried to recreate the choreography. Donde Quiera Que Estes (Wherever You Are) is the first and only crossover collaborative effort that reflects Selena’s Latino American fusion cohesion, a then marketing strategy by Jose Behar (the then-president of Capitol EMI Latin). Selena had the Tejano-Cumbia fusion while the Barrio Boyzz had the Latinx modern-day (at that time) R&B and soul; thus, it’s an amalgam of the cultural richness of their roots that worked in a beautiful duet.\n\nLa Carcacha\n\nSuch a crowd pleaser and with good reason, because of Los Dinos. They were multifaceted, and it showed. Especially live during this song; it’s an absolute diamond of Tejano music. Selena’s widower Chris Perez’s guitar riffs, the scintillating keyboards, and the timbales breakdown are too catchy to resist.\n\nSi Una Vez\n\nThis track is very, very high on my list. It’s one of my favorites (it was difficult to pick this song or Tus Desprecios, Que Creias, Tu Solo Tu, Techno Cumbia, Ya Ves, or Amor Prohibido), and I listen to it often. It’s another empowering track that I used to sing into my hairbrush as a kid or now can karaoke in a dive bar because it’s so damn good.\n\nComo La Flor\n\nComo La Flor’s also written by Selena’s brother (AB Quintanilla) with their Los Dinos partner (Pete Astudillo) about the perspective of a woman whose love withers.\n\nIt’s the song that skyrocketed the band to the Latin charts in the United States and Mexico. Despite already garnering success, this song captured the hearts of Latinx fans everywhere, catapulting Sel right into our hearts. She’s our goddess, our diva except without the attitude.\n\nObviously, we’re longtime fans. We want to honor her legacy as she’s impacted Latinx in such a monumental way. While Selena Quintanilla may no longer be with us, her music continues to transcend and still connect with intergenerational fans alike. Therefore we hope you enjoy our Play Into It playlist down below.\n\nFollow us via Spotify and Apple Music, we’ll follow back."
