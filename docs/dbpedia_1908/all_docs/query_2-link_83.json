        "text": "How are you finding the vinyl? Getting quiet copies, or no? I've had back luck with Capitol vinyl. Namely, I've been trying to find a clean copy of a George Shearing album (mono only--Latin Escapade) and haven't had luck. When I find one that's almost clean enough, it has too much groove wear. At this point I have three copies--one with the green/silver label, one black/rainbow with the logo at high noon, and another black/rainbow with the logo off to the left. I have a Nat King Cole LP with Shearing, but it's on the yellow Capitol label with the large red \"Capitol\" at the bottom of the label. The first minute or two of the LP on both sides is noisy as hell, but better when you get to the 2nd tracks on each side. I have a copy of Shearing's Latin Affair, stereo, that is dead quiet and beautiful. Like you say...warm, and very inviting.\n\nI think I'm more curious to know if I'm just finding over-used or dirty vinyl, or if Capitol vinyl wasn't always the quietest. Since Latin Affair is so clean, I think I'm just having overall bad luck in finding clean recordings.\n\nSteve...wow.\n\nDo you think that the 1959 cut could have been done on a tube lathe, and maybe the 1964 cut on a transistor lathe? And that maybe thats the difference?\n\nRudy, I'm having pretty good luck with the Lettermen stuff. I have a hunch that The Lettermen got the \"Top of the line Treatment\" for their Lps. They pretty much, all sound great. Some are better than others, as Steve pointed out, but by and large they have full fidelity and the orchestra stuff really sounds smooth. I'm thinking the early/mid 60s Lettermen stuff must have been cut on a tube lathe. Or at least the first few Lps, that have a midrange \"sheen\" that the 1968 Lps, for example dont have. Sounds like tubes made the diff in the mastering chain.\n\nBruce Spizer explains how to tell where your Beatles -- and by extension, other Capitol -- LPs were made (both covers and records, as they were made at different places at times) in his book about Beatles LP, and also from which lacquer and stamper. Unfortunately, my copy of the book's in the office and I'm at home!\n\nOne I can remember is that albums made at Winchester, Va. (which opened in the late 1960s) have a \"wineglass\" in the trail-off wax (an engraving that looks like an upside-down triangle with a stem coming from it).\n\nA couple of Beatles LPs, because of demand, were actually pressed at RCA and Decca in addition to using Capitol's plants.\n\nTrue, but earlier the coding was different and the same letters were used for west and east coast (and mono & stereo) cuttings. I don't know the exact year, but I'd say it system changed (to the above for west and east coast) sometime around 1962 or so.\n\nI gave these LP's a quick spin and listened to a couple of songs off of each LP.\n\nAll of them sounded quite good, but one was clearly exceptional. That was the George Shearing's White Satin. Plenty of bass, real nice warmth and just overall lush.\n\nIncentally this album was shown in the Hard Day's Night film, it was Paul's grandfather who was looking it over in the hotel room.\n\nThe Cole Lp's are pretty good, but it seems that the bass is lacking compared to the Shearing White Satin.\n\nJust goes to show you that Capitol could cut some decent LP's when they wanted to."
