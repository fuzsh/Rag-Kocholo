Sources close to the situation say Balvin’s exit from Universal Music Latino, whom he’s been signed to for the last 10 years, comes just as the Colombian singer gears up to release a new album later this year.\n\nBalvin’s incoming project will be under the supervision of the newly-minted Interscope Capitol Miami division (Interscope and Capitol merged earlier this year), spearheaded by Nir Seroussi. They will work together with Tom March’s team at Capitol Records.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nWill Smith Joins J.

The label also boasts Latin acts ranging from Kali Uchis to regional Mexican stars Xavi and Iván Cornejo. His most recent album, 2021’s “Jose,” was released on the Suenos Globales imprint and distributed by Universal. News of the new deal was first reported by Billboard.\n\nBalvin officially joined Roc Nation as a management client last year. He was previously managed by Fabio Acosta and Scooter Braun’s SB Projects, with whom Balvin parted ways with in 2022, after a short three-year stint together.\n\nBalvin’s new record will be his first full-length effort in over two years, and his first since “José.” He’s already released singles “Amigos,” and the DJ Khaled-featuring “Dientes.” He is reportedly working with producers Mura Masa, Tainy, Mambo Kingz and more.\n\nThe Latin music superstar has been on the road for his European “Que Bueno Volver a Verte” tour, which will close on June 5 with a stop at the O2 in London, England. Balvin also appeared at Coachella earlier this spring.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in June 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in June 2024"
