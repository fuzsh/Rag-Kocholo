Quintanilla, Jose BeharSelena chronology\n\nThrough the Years / A Traves de los Años\n\n(2007) La Leyenda\n\n(2010) Enamorada de Ti\n\n(2012)\n\nLa Leyenda (English: The Legend) is the name of the third box set from the Tejano pop singer Selena that was released by Capitol Latin/EMI and Q-Productions labels. The album was released on March 9, 2010.[1] This box set was released in three formats: a four-disc box set, a two-disc special-edition album, and a single-disc album.[1][2][3] According to Suzette Quintanilla's YouTube video, EMI teamed up with Q-Productions (a division of Selena's father's recording studio) to release this box set, and Quintanilla asks Selena fans around the world to contribute a special message to Selena that may or may not be included in the new box set. The Box-sets will contain an exclusive \"Selena\" charm and four booklets that include messages from Selena's family, friends, and fans from around the world. Selena fans around the world were told to collaborate pictures of themselves to be part of the La Leyenda bound books, but in early February 2010, Q-Productions and Capitol Latin decided to cancel the transaction due to legal actions with copyrighted images from fans.\n\nBackground and production\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2009, EMI teamed up with Q-Productions for the box set and agreed on releasing the album in three different formats:[1] one four disc box set, two special edition albums, and a single disc album. In mid-October 2009, Selena's sister released a public video about this project in which she reached out to the fans to contribute a special message for Selena that may or may not be used for this album's release.[4]\n\nAround early December 2009, the video for the information was later gone from the site but still exists on YouTube. It stated in the video that there aren't enough space for every Selena fan that they must submit a message that included all lower case letters, and the submitter may include a photo of themselves.[4]\n\nIn mid-December 2009, the album name, La Leyenda was released to the public by Amazon.com's selling market. There the three formats were given but no track list has been announced.[1]\n\nThe albums was released on March 9, 2010, as verified by Amazon.com.[1] The release marks the fifteenth anniversary of Selena's death, after being killed on March 31, 1995.\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2009, Univision Network released a Selena special entirely in Spanish called Selena: La Historia de una Leyenda (Selena: The History of a Legend) and again during the last week of November 2009, Univision released the video, this special was a preview to the upcoming DVD \"Johnny Canales presenta Selena\" planned to be released the fall of 2010 by Q-Productions.\n\nAs told in the video, Selena's fans will have a big part in being publicly viewed on the box set.

Continually, the promotion has caught eyes for all Wikipedia projects as well as Wiki Music Guide[7] which frequently reveals the album.\n\nOn February 27, 2010, Wal-Mart officials stated promotion for the box set will begin once the album is officially released on March 9, 2010 in all stores in Texas.[8] To assist the album's promotion, a Selena biography, which was provided by Macrovision Corporation,[9] has become available at the Wal-Mart website. The superstore will also be giving out a free promotional poster of Selena along with the La Leyenda four disc box-set to any customer who bought their copy at any participating Wal-Mart stores.\n\nQ-Productions (which is Selena's recording studio) has released its version of their promotional banner which is displayed on their web-site.
