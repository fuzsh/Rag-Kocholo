        "text": "Carmen DeLeon has signed a worldwide recording agreement with Capitol Music and Universal Music Latin Entertainment, the UMG companies announced Wednesday (June 5).\n\nDeLeon was born in Caracas, Venezuela and relocated to Tampa and later to Barcelona when she was in her early teens. At just 14 years old, she competed in La Voz Kids, Spain’s version of The Voice Kids.\n\nFollowing her time on the TV show, DeLeon amassed a devoted fanbase and broadened her local following with a series of successful concerts and online covers. Her YouTube channel — where she has posted several vlogs and covers of pop hits like Demi Lovato‘s “Sorry Not Sorry” and Beyoncé‘s “Halo” — currently boasts over 27,000 subscribers.\n\n“Carmen is a truly talented artist with an unmistakable voice and undeniable charisma,” said Capitol Music Group executives Jeremy Vuernick and Sergio Vega jointly in a statement. “We are approaching her development from a global perspective that’s befitting to her ability to sing flawlessly in both English and Spanish. This will allow her to further bridge the gap between Latin and Anglo audiences. We are incredibly excited to be welcoming her to the Capitol family.”\n\n“We warmly congratulate Carmen DeLeon on joining our newly created synergy between UMLE/Capitol,” added Victor González, Universal Music Latin Entertainment’s president. “It is a privilege to include her unique talent in our roster of a new generation of Latin singers, writers and performers. We wish her much success in this electrifying new stage of her professional career.”\n\nDeLeon, who is represented by Jared Paul and Janelle Lopez of Faculty Management, is currently preparing her U.S. debut that is slated to be released later this year."
