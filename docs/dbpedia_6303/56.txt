I recently bought the propeller for the engine from Sterba props in Ocala, FL. She’s a beauty! Ed did a great job on my prop at a great price, and it comes with lifetime mods. Since I’ve done some performance improvements to my engine and expect to put in an EFII system, I suspect I’ll squeeze some extra HPs out of my O-360. So I asked Ed to spec it to 200 hp and we can take some out at a later date after doing some test flying. I highly recommend working with Ed if you need a prop for a plane like this.
