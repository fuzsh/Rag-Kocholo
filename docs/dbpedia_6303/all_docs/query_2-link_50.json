        "text": "Does anyone supply experimental Lycoming flywheels. I have a good one off a American Yankee that is perfect for\n\nmy needs except it has the larger diameter pulley that drives alternator. I would prefer the smaller of the two pulley\n\nsizes to keep the alternator turning slower. This flywheel is drilled for both SAE 1 and SAE 2 crankshaft flanges which\n\nis also perfect as I have two engines with one of each type.\n\nThanks\n\nJim Miller I have had my cub project on hold as I have acquired a RV3 less engine. It is now flying with the 0235 that was\n\nin my Colt. The colt was sold to a guy who had his Colt badly damaged in a storm. The RV3 is one of the best decisions\n\nI have made. It flys 160MPH in no wind cruise and flys great. I will try to post a photo. I started flying it with a grand\n\ntotal of 8 hours tailwheel time all in a champ plus a hour of unofficial duel in a RV8. I now have 30 hours in the RV3.\n\nJM\n\nAttachments\n\nRV3-DC3 (5).JPG\n\nRV3-DC3 (7).JPG\n\nRV3-DC3 (8).JPG\n\nYou're ruined now. The RV3 is one of the most bang for the buck airplanes to ever come along. 160 mph cruise and a low stall speed, can't beat it. Wonder how it would look with bushwheels? Great looking airplane.\n\nYou're right, its certainly the most fun to fly airplane I have ever flown. I was very worried about my miniscule tailwheel experience but\n\ndidn't have any serious problems learning to fly it. The 0235 and the Ed Sterba prop gives plenty of performance. The prop is a little over\n\npitched 68 X 64 and only turns up to 2500 RPM but I wanted a cruise prop anyway and the climb is still 1200 to 1500 FPM. I normally cruise\n\nat 2350 to 2400 like I did in the Colt. Is the link to the flywheel company the same people who make the flywheels for Javron? The link\n\nwould not load directly so i am going to do a search for the same site.\n\nThanks\n\nJM\n\nThanks for the link. I looked at their site. Great looking flywheels but they only make the large pulley version. If I find a used small\n\npulley flywheel would it not be easy to have it redrilled to have the smaller SAE2 hole spacing? Maybe javron could do that for me.\n\nThe engine I plan to use in my Cub has the less common SAE2 flange. The flywheel that came with it is unusual in that it is drilled\n\nfor both SAE1 and SAE2 but with large pulley diameter. I think only the older 0235 c series engines have the small pulley, but only\n\ndrilled for the larger SAE1 flange.\n\nJM\n\nYou've got that backwards Jim. SAE2 (4.75\") is the normal lyco pattern.. there is only the very odd SAE1 (4.375) on a lycoming, they're usually reserved for dem Continentals.\n\nI've found numerous flywheels on ebay.. in both small and large pulley over the years. Unfortunately I don't have any under the bench that I can share with you."
