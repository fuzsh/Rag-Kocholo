It has laminated leading edge protection.\n\nThis prop has never flown. It was ordered last spring for my project, used for some test engine runs. but never spun passed 1500rpm. Always stored horizontally in my dry hangar.\n\nThis prop is for an O-320 with 3/8 propeller bolts. I will include a bolt set from Saber Mfg (length is set for a 1/2 crush plate and .080 spinner bulkheads)\n\nAsking 500$\n\ndylanxpeters\n\nRegistered Users\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n94\n\nReaction score\n\n39\n\nLocation\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMay 9, 2020\n\n#2\n\nuser 7922\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 18, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n2\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n#3\n\nLast edited: May 15, 2020\n\nuser 7922\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 18, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nReaction score\n\n2\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n#4\n\nLast edited: May 15, 2020\n\ntakair\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 18, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n222\n\nReaction score\n\n84\n\nLocation\n\nOxford, CT.
