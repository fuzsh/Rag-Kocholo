I flew an RV-4 160HP delivery flight for a friend from Fla to NC with a Sterba 68X76 that couldn't get to 2350 RPM at full throttle yet cruise was around 150Kts. Variations in tach indication, AS indicator accuracy and other factors may hide the truth. Go fly awhile and use calm day GPS ground speeds to give you some comparison.\n\nWood props...\n\nI have a Sterba 68X74 , 160HP Lyco on my RV-4, and get about 150kts at 8K, but that's turning 2600 RPM..its definitely a climb prop and I can easily hit 2800 RPM or more.

He was a MASTER at carving props and his are still some of the best-looking, if not THE best, of all the props out there. The only problem I had with such a great-looking prop was wanting to hang it on the wall rather than put it on the airplane! RIP, my good man! My fellow aviators miss your amazing talents!\n\nProp making is a mixture of art, science and a little Grey Magic that few people have mastered. Bernie called his the \"Almost Constant Speed Prop\" and I can actually feel it start to grab the air better once it spools up. My imagination? Perhaps! But I like it! Add me to your list of those who only tried one prop and were happy! Mine was perfect right out of the box. Bernie said if it wasn't performing the way I wanted, to send it back and he would tweak it if necessary. No need!\n\nI pulled out my travel logs from several years and 2400/18-22 was typical zipping around at an average 152kts sipping 6.5-7.5 gph. Altitude changes the MP but not much else. She will get close to 200kts throttle full forward but that little O-320 is working hard and tickling 2600 while sucking down 10+ gph. Naaaa. I'm was used to a Cub, for crying out loud! Anything faster than 75kts made me a happy man!\n\nI consider myself fortunate to have such a beautiful piece of aviation ART that does a most excellent job of pulling SuzieQ and I around!\n\nHow do you compare propellers with different lengths? I have a copy of a Ted Hendricks 68\" x 76\" propeller for my RV4 and it is a 'climb' prop. With 2350 RPM I have a speed of 125 kts which isn't enough. I've seen props with diameter of 72\" but with pitch around 40-44. I know that a prop with greater diameter can have a lower pitch and still have the same performance. Is there a way to compare prop?\n\nDiameter is determined most of the time by ground clearance or rpm limitations. Pitch, no matter the diameter sets the speed range. Most RV types are pitched between 68\"(climb) to 78\"(cruise). This is for most wood props. Lots of other factors, what's your operating field elevation, empty weight of the plane, rpm range you'd like to operate at(I've had customers run an O360 past 3300rpm). So lots of variables to consider. Then, every mfg measures Pitch different. Never apples to apples\n\nMy RV6 with O360 would cruise at 200mph at 2600 rpm at 7500ft DA. I don't recall the mp. At 2700 it was 210mph.\n\nBernie Warnke is where Clark Lydick learned to craft props. Clark taught me\n\nI'm back with som more questions. Is there a rule of thumb how to exstimate change in static RPM for a change in propeller diameter and pitch. To get my static RPM down and get more cruise speed I was thinking of ordering a new prop with different specs. i have a Ted Hendrickson 68\" / 76\" and a prop with 70\" diameter and 78\" or 80\" pitch could possibly do the trick. Before ordering I need to be more sure what I'll get. Any ideas?\n\nPer Tony B. publishing, a rule of thumb has it that when you decrease the propeller diameter by one inch, or decrease the pitch by one inch, the rpm will increase by about 50 to 100 rpm . . . say, on the average, 80 rpm.\n\nTalk with Catto props. Tell them what engine, airframe you have and your expectations and they will tell you exactly what you need in a FP in either 2 or 3 blade versions.\n\nI'm back with som more questions.

Before ordering I need to be more sure what I'll get. Any ideas?\n\nWhat you need to do is not try and calculate what you want for a diameter pitch value, but contact someone you want to have make you a prop and talk with them about what you want to focus on performance wise and then let them handle the rest.\n\nThe reason this is important is that not all prop makers measure their pitch value the same. I.E., if you order a 70 X 79 prop from three different prop makers and test all three on your airplane, you will likely get different performance #'s from each.\n\nPretty much any prop maker currently in business is very familiar with all of the different RV models. Knowing your model, engine size, and a few other details, they will make you a prop that does what you want.\n\nI don't see that you have ever mentioned in this thread whether you finally got all of the gear fairings installed. If not, that will have a much bigger effect on performance than most people ever believe. This is particularly true with a fixed pitch prop."
