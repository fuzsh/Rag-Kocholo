(They flex too much)\n\nok now that we cleared up what Tom's mystery word was I have a question.\n\nEach object will carry it's own natural resonance. Regardless of the material it is made up of there is a resonant frequency. That is the frequency the system will oscillate at it's maximum and can actually increase. I did a lot of work on large space structures in the 1980's looking at structural resonances and seen this happen. It can be a lot of fun to watch!!\n\nI can understand that wooden props have a different resonant point over metal ones. I can understand that the wood tends to have less of a rotational mass than metal and thus cause less system vibrations at the system frequencies. But I don't understand what you mean by \"carry\" resonance.\n\nHelp me understand what it is you are observing. I just want to know more about the difference between the two materials for props and why one would be chosen over the other. I am not trying to start a jihad of questions like we are seeing on other threads these past couple of weeks. I think this is a semantics issue more than anything else.\n\nDan Thomas\n\nTouchdown!

It makes no sense not to \"track the prop\" before final toque of the prop bolts. A few paper shims and you can get it pretty close. I mounted the Sterba prop and got it to about 1/32\". Close enough for government work.\n\nBTW, I had Sterba take 4\" of pitch out of the prop, but I can't feel or see (RPM's) where it made much difference. Maybe due to the cold temps now, but the good news is the RV-3 is airworthy again, AND I need to fly it more for more test data! Even with an 0-235 she is a hoot (and cheap) to fly.\n\nLast edited: Jan 9, 2009\n\nTom-D\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n34,740\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTom-D\n\nJan 9, 2009\n\n#28\n\nMy O-200 has TDC, as well as 22-32 degrees BTDC, marked on the prop flange.\n\nIf you place those marks at the TDC alined with the bottom case seam, which cylinder are you aligned with?\n\nor does it matter?\n\njmaynard\n\nCleared for Takeoff\n\nJoined\n\nJun 7, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,487\n\nLocation\n\nFairmont, Minnesota\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJay Maynard\n\nJan 9, 2009\n\n#29\n\nIf you place those marks at the TDC alined with the bottom case seam, which cylinder are you aligned with?\n\nor does it matter?\n\nYou know, that's a good question.

Proper track will cut down on vibration.\n\nDo you check the track visually or is there an instrument? Is tracking valuable for 3 blade props as well as 2 blades?\n\nRotorAndWing\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,496\n\nLocation\n\nOther side of the world\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nRotor&Wing\n\nJan 9, 2009\n\n#31\n\nDo you check the track visually or is there an instrument?

Bring the next blade around and it should be in the same position. If not measure the difference. If you have a 3rd or 4th blade do the same.\n\nSometimes the fix is as simple as moving the prop a bolt hole left or right one, or even reinstalling the prop 180 degrees from previous. If it's way out some other things need to be looked at.\n\njesse\n\nTouchdown!

Even with an 0-235 she is a hoot (and cheap) to fly.\n\nGood deal, let me know when you get sick of flying it, I can help out\n\nGeico266\n\nTouchdown!

Here's perhaps the most famous example of resonance causing destruction:\n\nHere's what happens when a helicopter goes into ground resonance:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEj69NANc8\n\nLast edited: Jan 10, 2009\n\nDave Krall CFII\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n5,022\n\nLocation\n\nSeattle WA\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nDave Krall CFII SEL SES, Cmcl HELI\n\nJan 10, 2009\n\n#35\n\nIt's simple. place something like a block just behind the blade so the back of the first blade is just barely touching the block.

I guess for that super slow motion video might show it.\n\nDan Thomas\n\nTouchdown!

I'll have to see next time I've got the spark plugs out.\n\nDon't bother. On a four-banger the firing order is 1-3-2-4, so the TDC mark will line up with the case seam on both 1 and 2. The prop will be at the 8:00 - 2:00 position in either case. You don't need #1 at TDC, just the TDC mark at its index whether it's the case seam on a small Continental or the starter dimple on the Lyc. The only time you need to know whether #1 is at TDC (or more correctly, at the firing position ahead of TDC) is when you're installing or timing a mag.\n\nDan\n\nDan Thomas\n\nTouchdown!

Expensive and not necessary for most props. They use different coloured reflector tape on each blade so they can determine which blade is running high or low (or forward or back).\n\nDan\n\nRotorAndWing\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,496\n\nLocation\n\nOther side of the world\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nRotor&Wing\n\nJan 10, 2009\n\n#38\n\nYes that would be easy enough.

Just a static track and you're good to go.\n\nTom-D\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n34,740\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTom-D\n\nJan 10, 2009\n\n#39\n\nThere are strobe setups available for checking propeller and helicopter rotor blade tracking while at RPM.

You see pink its in track, you see 2 lines one red, and one white, it is not tracking.\n\nadd throttle see the lines move forward and back\n\nits best done in the dark."
