So itâs a rare state of affairs for me to be caught off guard by a new purchase. Still, looking back on nearly three years of airplane ownership, I can identify a handful of things I wish I had known from the beginning. 1. Beware of homemade parts and accessories. My airplaneâs previous owner was a retired rocket engineer who had it for roughly 40 years. He spent his career working in various facets of aviation and aero- space. His work is literally aboard the Voyager space probes at this very moment. If ever there was a guy who could properly care for a single-engine Cessna, I rea- soned, this was the guy. And he did indeed take good care of itâ¦and he also fab- ricated a few things himself, like custom cowl plugs to prevent birds from nesting in the engine. The plugs were well-made and easily utilized by any reasonably in- telligent individual. However, the cowl plugs were not idiot-proof. More specifically, they lacked any obvious visual indication that they were in place. I learned this during my very first\n\nlesson in my airplane when I neglected to remove them, overheated the engine, cracked multiple cylinders, and was forced to have a top overhaul done on the engine. It was entirely my fault. But had I used a mass-produced cowl plug that was de- signed with idiots in mind, I would almost certainly have spotted the red flags or streamers from the cockpit, removed them prior to engine start, and avoided an embarrassing and costly mistake. The lesson? Beware of amateur-built items like cowl plugs, wheel chocks, gust locks, and similar accessories. Determine what makes them different from mass-produced versions, and consider whether these differences could be the first link in a chain of events leading toward an unfortunate incident. 2. A good engine monitor is an extremely worthwhile investment. Prior to the panel upgrade I made last year, my airplane had a variety of anti- quated engine gauges, including a digital cylinder head temperature (CHT) read- out that only ever displayed the temperature of one of my six cylinders. The other gauges were all positioned on the far side of my panel, well outside the normal field of vision. When I installed a Garmin GI 275 EIS engine monitoring display, this single unit replaced nine individual gauges while bringing far more engine infor- mation into my field of view. It also logs and stores engine data to help mechanics diagnose tricky engine issues.\n\n4 Aircraft For Sale | June 2024\n\nRotax 916iS powered RV-9\n\nâ¢ Stunning performance with simple engine operation. â¢ Automatic ECU controlled lean of Peak EGT operation for optimum mixture and efficiency at any density altitude. â¢ 750 lbs Useful load â¢ Maximum Takeoff power available to 15,000 ft DA. â¢ 170 knot Cruise at 12,500 ft 7.5 GPH. â¢ 190 knot cruise at 17,500ft.\n\nContact LOCKWOOD AIRCRAFT for more info. 863-655-4242 â¢ www.Aircam.com\n\nMulti-Engine Seaplane Training AirCam Transition Training You can now obtain your\n\nWe have the latest Generation III AIrCam available for checkouts and transition training.

For example, just as I refer to a target rpm and airspeed on takeoff, I now also use a target CHT during climb out. This ensures Iâm not inadvertently subjecting the engine to unnecessarily high temperatures, and it makes me won- der whether such an upgrade would have alerted me to high CHTs earlier and prevented the engine damage I incurred during the unfortunate cowl plug incident. 3. A good mechanic is an effortless solution to annoy- ing problems. Over the past few years, Iâve come to realize something re- lated to aircraft ownership and financesâany problem that requires a total investment of only three figures to remedy is an absolute no-brainer, worthy of your immediate attention. Iâm fortunate to have the means to say this, and it makes my scrimping and saving in other areas of life a bit less pain- ful. But it took me a while to understand. For example, I spent the better part of a year putting up with a stubbornly tight fuel sump. Every time Iâd pull a sample out of the left tank before a flight, Iâd have to position my fuel strainer just so and then put muscle into pushing it upward. Half the time, the strainer would slip, and Iâd end up with a fuel-covered hand. It was annoying. It was similarly annoying to deal with my 170âs original mixture knob. It was the old kind that resembled a carb heat knob. It had about 2 inches of stiff travel, and precise adjust- ment was simply not possible. I hated it from the get-go. I eventually made each of these annoyances disappear for- ever with the wave of a credit card and a call to my mechanic, who, conveniently, is willing to drive to my airplane. A new fuel sump was only around $20, a new McFarlane vernier mixture control was a few hundred, and each required only a small amount of time for him to fix. Had I realized just how quick and easy it was to clear my mind of annoyances that distract me from flying duties, I would have addressed them far earlier than I did. 4. Donât put up with poor checklists just because the pre- vious owner did. The checklists that came with my airplane were absolutely terrible. For some reason, the run-up checks were included in one massive âBefore Takeoffâ checklist. This meant that when hammering out landing after landing with full-stop taxi-backs, I had to sift through and omit the various steps of the runup when running through the lengthy before-takeoff checklist. It wasnât long before I missed an important item. On perhaps my sixth or seventh takeoff of the day, I ap- plied power and was surprised when the airplane leaped off\n\nthe runway far earlier than usual. I was similarly surprised when, after getting into ground effect, it stubbornly refused to accelerate. Within seconds, I put two and two together and realized the flaps were still set at 40 degrees. Gingerly retract- ing the first couple of notches to avoid settling, I cleaned up and cleared the departure-end trees with a healthy margin. It spooked me, though. And like the aforementioned small annoyances that continually pestered me on every flight, I realized Iâd been needlessly putting up with this checklist annoyance for too long. I ultimately created new and bet- ter checklists, and I supplemented them with a five-item pre-takeoff flow that I perform after lining up in position and immediately prior to advancing throttle for takeoff (fuel selector, trim, flaps, mixture, and carb heat). Since making these two changes, Iâve never missed an item before takeoff. 5. Itâs OK to not be adventurous or to not fly at all. Airplane ownership has been a lifelong goal for me. The flying Iâd do in my head, sitting in seventh-grade social stud- ies or, later, in aviation law or advanced meteorology, was downright majestic. I envisioned myself setting off on adven- tures every weekend, exploring new airfields, and meeting new challenges as though I were starring in my own weekly Indiana Jones -inspired miniseries. Reality has proven to be far less grandiose. Grappling with the daily challenges of a demanding full-time job, an addi- tional part-time job, and all the other duties that weave their way into saving for a house and retirement leaves me men- tally exhausted more often than not. Accordingly, simple, un- remarkable flying has proven to be the most enjoyable over the past few years, and itâs not uncommon to want to unplug and relax even when presented with a picture-perfect day. For a long time, I felt pretty guilty about this. Here I am, having finally obtained the airplane of my dreams, one thatâs equipped with all the necessary mods to set off on epic back- country trips, and Iâve only been using it to hone my tailwheel skills on mundane grass strips. And here I am, often opting not to fly at all on many days with beautiful flying weather. Eventually, I realized that there was plenty of time to tackle the more exciting kinds of flying Iâve always envisioned. It took me decades to achieve airplane ownership, after all, and if taking a relaxed approach to my flying hits the spot for the time being, thatâs OK. Itâs both comforting and intriguing to know that by saving up and buying a more capable airplane, Iâve got one I can grow into rather than out of, abilitywise. And it feels good to know that plenty of adventures lie ahead. Jason McDowell is a private pilot and Cessna 170 owner based in Madi- son, Wisconsin.

Whether itâs a single-day business trip allowing for dinner plans at home to stay intact, or the entire family loading up to visit friends in a neighboring stateâliving with your airplane unlocks opportunities. For most, living in a fly-in community requires a trade-off between the amenities expected from a master-planned development and those required by an operating airportâto satisfy everyoneâs needs in the householdâand thus it remains a dream. At its core, The Fields has been developed to solve this dilemma. Designed by pilots and keeping family, friends, and non-aviation residents in mind as a priority, The Fields marries the best of fly-in community living with world-class amenities everyone can enjoy. âWe wanted to design a development that has community at its core, allowing for pilots to enjoy the advantages aviation unlocks while focusing on the key aspects that make a new urbanist community attractive,â says Jon Ricketts, partner in The Fields. âThis concept is unique to aviation, as other developments donât cater to the non-aviation spouse or family. We wanted a community that our spouses would be proud to call home and invite their friends to visit.â In addition to the onsite amenities surrounding a 4,300-foot runway, The Fields is strategically located in southeastern Tennessee. The area features a long list of beautiful flying adventures nearby, close proximity to major metropolitan areas, and a tax-friendly state for residents. By pilots, for pilotsâThe Fields is the new standard for fly-in communities.\n\nFLYTHEFIELDS.COM\n\nFLYTHEFIELDS.COM/AMENITIES\n\nDISCOVER AT THE FIELDS\n\nNEW RUNWAY & TAXIWAY HOMESITES ONE OF THE MOST AMENITY-RICH COMMUNITIES IN TEXAS\n\nFly-in Living in the Fastest Selling Airpark in Texas from $ 189,900\n\nLocated in Granbury, Just 35 Miles from Fort Worth â¢ Runway Frontage and Taxiway Access Homesites â¢ 3,100 ft.
