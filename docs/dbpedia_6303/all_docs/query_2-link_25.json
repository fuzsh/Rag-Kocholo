Did that data ever get tabulated and if so is the file available here? If not, can anybody suggest an appropriate diameter, pitch, and direction of rotation for the propeller on a CX4?\n\nMark, it is mostly on if you want a cruise or power prop. Mostly it depends on the horsepower of the engine you select. I have a 2180 73 hp . engine and swing\n\ntwo different props. One is an Tenn. prop 54X46 (2950 on takeoff) and a Ed Sterba prop 54X44. (3050on takeoff) I believe the guys on the website will be able\n\nto explain it better than I can.\n\nOn Monday, October 21, 2019, 9:27:51 AM EDT, Mark Weitkamp via Groups.Io <mark_weitkamp@...> wrote:\n\nI seem to remember that some time ago someone was collecting information about which engine/propeller combinations everybody was using.

I think I remember from somewhere that the direction of rotation on our Volkswagen engines is opposite to the direction on my Continental C-85 on my Baby Ace. Can anybody confirm that?\n\nYes, opposite rotation. You will need left rudder on takeoff and climb.\n\nThat is very easy to get used to.....almost immediate.\n\n--\n\nGLEN BRADLEY\n\nCX5 14GB\n\nI recommend you talk to your choses prop supplier since pitch numbers vary a LOT for the same physical pitch. I have one prop from Jeff at Props Inc that is pitched at 40 in and it flies the same as my 46 in pitch from Tenn Props. BTW I am sad to say that JEFF RETIRED.\n\n--\n\nGLEN BRADLEY\n\nPROTOTYPE CX5 14GB\n\nGlen, thanks for your input. I am not absolutely set on a chosen prop provider, but I am leaning toward Culver Props, because she made a prop for my Baby Ace that I like. But I would like to have a little more info before I call her. Is there a specific prop length or diameter that we all agree on?\n\nYes it does. CCW from the cockpit. You have to push on LEFT rudder on take off.\n\nOn Monday, October 21, 2019, 9:46:43 AM EDT, Mark Weitkamp via Groups.Io <mark_weitkamp@...> wrote:\n\nThank you for the reply Harold.

Or does this make it uncomfortable once at cruise or during descent at a lower power setting?\n\nRegards\n\nPeter How\n\nTel : +27 71 657 4424 (Gariep Office)\n\nMobile : 083 265 0581\n\nFax : 086 693 0581\n\nwww.pjaviation.co.za\n\nwww.stemme-africa.com\n\nwww.li-start.co.za\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nFrom: thatcher-aircraft@groups.io <thatcher-aircraft@groups.io> On Behalf Of GLEN BRADLEY\n\nSent: Monday, 21 October, 2019 17:36\n\nTo: thatcher-aircraft@groups.io\n\nSubject: Re: [thatcher-aircraft] Propeller selection\n\nYes, opposite rotation.

I hope you don’t mind if I mention your name when I call Alaina. Do you remember when you got your prop from her, and how long was the lead time between ordering and receiving?\n\nI don’t mind if you use my name as a reference and I think it was about 5 years ago. Delivery as I remember want too bad at the time. They could then check there records to confirm prop size as well.\n\nGuys\n\nI have a 58X32 vw prop...any one know its use? for sale ...Herb\n\nSent with ProtonMail Secure Email.\n\n‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nOn Tuesday, October 22, 2019 5:19 AM, Doug Garin via Groups.Io <douger1@...> wrote:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nI don’t mind if you use my name as a reference and I think it was about 5 years ago.

BOTH props fly identically. I get 3250 on takeoff WOT. I cruise 28-3000 rpm./ 21-23 inches MP. That is a good combination climb/ cruise prop I think. If you wanted JUST climb you might want 2 inches less pitch.\n\n--\n\nGLEN BRADLEY\n\nPROTOTYPE CX5 14GB\n\nAce Mccool\n\nFWIW, I fly with a Sterba 54/46 on my 2180. You can check the video to see what happens on TO. I'm usually up in about 700' or so. On the video I have no headwind and a mild crosswind, so I held it on a bit longer, (The orange cone is the 750 mark)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqen-axY0Kg\n\nIf you go to full screen you can see the instruments quite well\n\nAce Mccool\n\nPS, on the big screen TV, even better\n\nJim, the two canopy side latches you have on your plane, where may I buy a set?
