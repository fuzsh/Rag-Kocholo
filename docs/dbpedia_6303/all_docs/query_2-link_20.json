Constant speed propellers can change the angle of attack of the blades to take a smaller or larger \"bite\" of air as it rotates. A shallower angle of attack requires the least horsepower, but the highest RPM because the propeller is not moving very much air with each revolution. The first constant-speed propellers were counterweight propellers driven by mechanisms which operated on centrifugal force.",
