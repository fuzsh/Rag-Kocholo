Beyond that you must reduce the engine to a max 5500 rpm's with a significant reduction of HP (100). The 912S = 100 HP and the 912UL at 80 HP. I don't know if the 912 and 912S engines are max continuous or not. Doesn't matter to me anyway as I find them too anemic for any of the EZ's.\n\nCost wise the Mattituck Continental \"Experimental\" O200, IO240 or Lycoming O320 engines are the best new engine buys on the market. I find the Rotax 914 Turbo more than a bit pricey at their suggested retail of $30,000 especially when compared to a Continental or Lycoming Mattituck engine of more than equal HP and proven reliability.\n\nCurrently Mattituck is selling their XP O200 for $15, 275 and their IO240 for $17,620.
