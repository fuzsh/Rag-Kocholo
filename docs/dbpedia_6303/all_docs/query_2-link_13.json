Little better performance in climb. Will have to look up the pitch.\n\nRemoved an 82/43 borer and put on a 82/41 catto. Started easier, I have a sky tech starter. The takeoff was shorter, climbed better, cruised faster, much smoother and it seemed to land shorter. Better throttle response. It was almost as big of a difference as going from a 74/56 cruise to a 82-43 borer. But it was smoother and more throttle response. The 82/41 catto is more of there cruise prop. I would get around 100 mph with the borer. I was getting 105 or so with the catto same rpm. I don't have any numbers for takeoff but it was around a hundred feet. Same with the landing. I was taking off and then landing across a taxiway, so it might have been shorter. I debated the 84/37 which is there hauling, getting out short prop. But they said with a Supercub you would be at 90-95/2500 rpm. But they said it should static 2500. I didn't want to give up that much in cruise. The 82/41 catto static was 2200. I'll check what the borer does next week.\n\nAll this was on my 0-320 160hp super cub. 3\" extended uncovered gear and Thrustline.\n\nTom\n\nRe: Has anyone used a Cato Prop 84&quot; by 36 Pitch?\n\nRemoved an 82/43 borer and put on a 82/41 catto.

I realize it is a Composite core glass propeller, similar to a warp drive or a Kool prop.\n\nGary\n\nIt is not a composite core. The props are wood core made from maple. They are covered with carbon fiber and resin to achieve the structural strength and finish. As I see it, here are the advantages:\n\n1. Weight - I recently installed a 2 blade Catto on a friend's RV-6. The Sensenich that came off weighed in at a hefty 44#. The Catto inclusive of crush plate and bolts was 22#. Not only a reduction of overall weight, but less loads on the crankshaft and engine mount.\n\n2. Performance - The owner wanted to achieve better T/O performance while not sacrificing cruise speed. Catto Props has been able to achieve this through subtle changes of the blade profile over the length of the blade (I am not an engineer, so I can't explain it). The RV-6 achieved higher static RPM with better T/O performance, yet maintained the same (if not a slight increase) in cruise speed.\n\n3. Vibration Reduction - The Catto Props that I have flown have resulted in a marked decrease in engine vibration throughout the normal RPM range. I recently flew another aircraft that had one of Catto's \"in development\" propellers. Overall, the prop was quite smooth, but I noted an increase in vibration at about 2000 RPM, which dampened out at about 1500. This was reported to Craig, and he will check on it.\n\nI am very optimistic that the future will bring Catto Propellers advancements to the SWP arena. When that day arrives, Catto Props has a standing order for an O-320 powered PA-20 prop!\n\nIt is not a composite core. The props are wood core made from maple.

The Compostie , in one of its various forms is the propeller of the future, combining strength and low weight, plus a thinner cross section than an aluminum propeller.\n\nMy question was (and I don't have any ax to grind) what makes Catto better than a half dozen other brands that I can think of. I'd really like to know.\n\nI am carving my own propeller for my tandem Wagabond (maple) and it will be carbon covered and epoxy bagged.\n\nGary\n\nHi Gary,\n\nGood question about Catto. For me I cannot determine that Catto is better than any other What I do know is props are his passion and life. Theare the most helpful people I have ever met. My prop will be ready in a couple of months. I will fly it t his shop where he will install the prop for free. They will re pitch it once if I don't like its performance If I am still not satisfied they will refund my money.\n\nI have been fly for 45 years and hat I the first time any vendor ever made that promise.\n\nThere maybe others out there with that confidence and customer service philosophy but I haven't hard of them.\n\nBlue Skies\n\nRon"
