(~2000ASL)\n\nSterba 54/46 on my 2180 and he rocks! Bought it in 2012 for $350 and part of the hardened leading edge came off during ground run...he fixed for free. In 2019 I saw something in the grain that I thought might be a crack so I sent it back and he sent me a new prop...no charge. You just keep the original shipping container and if you want the pitch changed (less climb, more cruise) he will do it. Don’t know how he makes money but I’m sold!\n\nSince my favorite prop maker, Props Inc, is no longer making props, I bought a Sterba prop. It looks great but I have not flown it yet.\n\nYou should be able to get the pitch you need from other 2180 engine owners.\n\nglenb\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Sun, Oct 18, 2020 at 9:37 AM Harold McCollum via groups.io <phantom32068=yahoo.com@groups.io> wrote:\n\nEd Sterba Ocala Fla.\n\nContact Sterba Propeller Company by phone: 1-941-778-3103 by mail: 9660 SE 72nd Ave\n\nOn Sunday, October 18, 2020, 08:02:27 AM EDT, <andrew.k26@...> wrote:\n\nThanks.
