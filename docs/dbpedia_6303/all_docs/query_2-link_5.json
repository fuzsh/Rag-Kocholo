        "text": "Wood Propellers are a fantastic choice for your RV. They are light,inexpensive,and low maintenance.\n\nI've started this thread to help those who have questions about Wood Propellers.\n\nA few topics to start are:\n\n1)Maintenance- They are LOW maintenance Not NO maintenance. As always inspect you Prop before each flight.\n\na. Moisture is a slow destroyer of a wood propeller. Any sort of damage which breaks thru the finish should be addressed as soon as possible.\n\nb. Torque should be checked at each annual-I suggest checking the torque on new propeller installations after the frist flight or at least after the first hour.\n\nc.All Wood Propellers need to be refinished every few years to prevent moisture damage. Check with the Manufacturer to determine what process is used for the finish. some are simple varnish others are automotive clear coats.If you chose to refinish yourself check the balance. its easy to get off.\n\n2)Cost-Wood propellers are the most economical of choices. Typically they start at 800.00 and go up to 2700.00 depending on application.(two or three blade)\n\n3)Weight-A typical two blade weighs 11 to 12 pounds then you add the extension(6lbs), crush plate(2lbs) and bolts(2lbs). So the installed weight is around 21 pounds.\n\n4)Aerobatics-\n\na.Wood propellers do not work fatigue like aluminum props. This is a big advantage with props used in aerobatic applications.\n\nb.Wood propellers have a much lower polar moment of inertia which results in a lower gyroscopic effect thereby giving a more responsive aircraft.\n\nThese are a few bits of information on Wood Propellers. Please feel free to ask if you have questions. From time to time I'll be adding information.\n\nI beg to disagree!\n\nWood props, properly sized are great for racing and you can hardly argue with the price. But for all-around use I would not recommend wood props for most RVs. You MUST slow down and reduce RPM at the first sign of rain or you risk destroying the finish on wood props. The first time your buddies leave you behind will convince you that perhaps a metal or composite prop would have been a better idea.\n\nBefore you flame me, note that I said \"for all-around use\". I will argue that wood props are definitely not preferred for SERIOUS aerobatics or formation flying where a CS prop is needed. Personally, I would never consider a wood prop on my RV.\n\n(Let the flaming begin... )\n\nWood Props\n\nNo flaming required...but\n\nNo idea why anyone would think a wood prop or more specifically a FP prop hinders formation flying in any way? Unless maybe you are talking a max performance section take-off at high elevation..otherwise it is completely a non-issue. I can understand for airshows having all players matched in configuration would make it much easier for lead but for general point A to B formation flying not a problem. In fact, when formation flying was invented the planes all had wood props...\n\nCurious what defines \"serious aerobatics\" in an RV? I would hope anyone performing aerobatics in their RV take them \"seriously\"?\n\nI've been working on the Primary and many of the Sportsman figures all summer with my FP wood sensenich and nothing bad has happened - should I be afraid now\n\nI had 2 Clark Lydic props with a pusher airplane that cruised faster than the RV's and they held up quite well. Yes, they had to be refinished about every year but that was no big deal and easy to do with spar varnish or clear epoxy. Rain does a much worse job on the Catto than it did with the Performance prop. It has a tough leading edge which the Catto does not have (before the stainless option).\n\nLaminated wood is very strong for its weight. The first prop lost a blade when a piece of exhaust pipe went through it, the other 2 blades while damaged did not depart. The light weight of the unit limited vibration to the point where there was no damage to the engine. If that had happened with a metal prop, the engine would have departed.\n\nOver all, you get what you pay for. The Catto or this prop are very good compromises and show excellent performance - but not as excellent as a CS unit, especially on take off. There days I wish I had 2700 rpm for take off. The Performance design is quasi CS in that static rpm was 2350-2400 whereas the Catto runs at 2200. (mine is actually about 2180 most days but it gets wound up quick once in the air)\n\nNo flaming required...but\n\nNo idea why anyone would think a wood prop or more specifically a FP prop hinders formation flying in any way?

SERIOUS formation pilots enjoy the rapid acceleration AND deceleration that only a CS prop provides. High speed descents will leave fixed pitch airplanes behind as they throttle back to avoid overspeeding their engines. Similarly, SERIOUS aerobatics demand high speeds and propeller braking in the RV. Team RV enters over-the-top maneuvers at 200KTAS, too fast for fixed pitch props. The CS provides the braking action needed to avoid exceeding Vne on downlines and during formation aerobatics the CS provides the braking action to avoid overtaking the lead aircraft while rolling out of a barrel roll from the outside position.\n\nAll Team RV aircraft have CS props. Some converted from wood or metal FP props. None have gone back!\n\nI am not discouraging anyone from flying formation from A to B or doing aerobatics with their FP prop. But if you take either formation flying or aerobatics to the edge of the aircraft envelope, you will eventually find that the FP propeller will be a limiting factor. If you stay well within the center of the envelope you may never exceed the capabilities of your FP propeller and will continue to enjoy the benefits described in the leading post to this thread. It's your airplane. You make the choice.\n\nRivethead-Yes, they work Great on all the RVs\n\nSmokey-No flaming here\n\nI don?t want this to become a mine is better thread- just want to help inform people.\n\nI have many customers who use their Wood propeller for all around use. And yes, you throttle back when entering rain but at 2300rpm and indicating 165mph I can hardly call that slow, I would suspect most would not enter rain at speeds near Vne.\n\nAll Around Use:\n\nWhen a Wood prop is used in IFR conditions it Will need to be refinished more often. Some have this done at Annual and the propellers have been in service for well over ten years.\n\nNote: If the propeller doesn?t have any sort of leading edge protection Do Not fly thru rain! It will erode the propeller away.\n\nI install a polymer-alloy leading edge and glass the tips to protect against damage. This holds up very well for all around use.\n\nAerobatics: Properly designed- the wood propeller is great for aerobatics.\n\nI can limit the overspeed problem on th down side with proper design.\n\nRVs, OneDesign, Pitts, Laser, Bucker Jungmann & Jungmiester, Skybolt, and Starduster are some of the airframes that have Performance Propellers on them. I would venture to say they are SERIOUS about Aerobatics.\n\nFormation: Yes, for those who choose to participate in formations may be better suited with a CS propeller. This all dependes on your intended mission of your airplane.\n\nRivethead-Yes, they work Great on all the RVs\n\nSmokey-No flaming here\n\nI don?t want this to become a mine is better thread- just want to help inform people.....\n\nI appreciate the information you have presented. Ultimately it is the builder who will decide what prop to hang on his airplane. The more information he has, the better. We all have our prejudices and preferences. The informed builder will try to separate hype from fact and make a decision that will fit his mission. Isn't it wonderful to have so many choices?\n\nRe-Pitch\n\nJim- To repitch a wood propeller, Usually it can go only one way. Less-Pitch, I basically remove material the Old School way. With a Rasp.\n\nWhat I do is measure the existing blades, input the data, determine the amount of adjustment needed, print out the new station pitch data and get after it with the rasp.\n\nI can make fine adjustments (Ex. 50rpm) up thru major ones like repitching a propeller originally for an O360 for a O320. The tolerance I keep is within 1/10th of one degree. Adjustments can also be made for more rpm at static only or across the operating range.\n\nWood if I could...\n\nI installed a Sterba prop on my RV4 in 1995 and flew it for 1000 hours. Wood props are smooth, cheap and pretty. However, I really liked the following props I tested on my 4. Gary Hertzler ([email protected]) Craig Catto (www.cattoprops.com) Margie Warnke (retired)\n\nMy current RVX has an MT fixed pitch wood composite which I believe to be the best of both worlds. MT will make you a wood finished prop with their SS leading edge if you like.\n\nSome considerations, many already noted:\n\n1. 2200 RPM max in rain.\n\n2. Check bolt torque every 25 hours for the first 100. Do not over torque!\n\n3. Inspect thoroughly for cracks, erosion.\n\nMisnomers:\n\n1. You need constant speed to fly good formation. (Nope, Just lots of practice under duress\n\n2. They are slower than metal or composite, properly pitched. (definitely not true)\n\n3. Can't be re-pitched. (yes they can, see Frank's post)\n\n4. Indestructible. (In a word, no I have seen 2 inflight failures)\n\nEmail me off line if you'd like to discuss further.\n\n[email protected]\n\nA few favorites:\n\nSterba\n\nColin Walker (I think)\n\nCulver\n\nHertzler\n\nWood props truly are beautiful - I still have a chunk of one off the airplane I helped to rebuild (and soloed in) as a teenager. No, it wasn't the prop's fault that gave me the chunk - someone (else) put it in the trees. if a point solution for a prop is right for you, they are a great idea to put in the mix for evaluation. Wood, metal, composite....FP, CS, Ground adjustable....they are all viable choices if it fits what you want your airplane to do - just like VFR or IFR, Trike or Taildragger....\n\nBuild the airplane that's right for you, equipped in a way that's right for you!\n\nPaul"
