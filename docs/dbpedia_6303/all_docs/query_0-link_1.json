The bolt size denotes the torque value and the 7/16” bolts on the 0-320 should be 19-23 ft lbs. Here is a wood prop torque value chart.\n\nhttps://propellerman.com/assets/Recommended_bolt_torques_for_Sensenich_Wood_Propellers.pdf\n\nI didn’t like how my 3/8” bolts became “loose”in less than 25 hours so I drilled my prop to 1/2”, installed the larger bolts and crush plate from Saber MFG and bumped the torque to 25 ft lbs. They would hold torque until a 50hr oil change afterward. Additionally every year during the CI I would refinish it with spray Spar Varnish from Lowe’s. Ed makes a great prop for a very reasonable price, keep an eye out for cracks along the grain, delamination and keep it properly torqued and varnished. It will serve you well.\n\nhttp://www.sabermfg.com/bolts.htm\n\nEventually I sold the Sterba on my RV4 in lieu of installing a composite test prop from a little known (at that time) prop maker named Craig Catto.\n\nThe rest as they say is history....\n\nV/R\n\nSmokey"
