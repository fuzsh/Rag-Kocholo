        "text": "143 mph IAS@3160 rpm (166 mph TAS) - 4.5 gph => 31.8 mpg (wide open throttle)\n\nThis info is pretty stable data collected from my EIS data during the flight, usually at least 30 seconds within 5' of the the same altitude (although not all are at exactly 8500'), during stable flight (no diving or climbing). You get the idea... my KR is not a bad way to travel these days! I guess I mention this because the September issue of Kitplanes showed the new Arion Lightning kitplane doing 25 mpg doing 170 mph TAS at 7500' burning 6.7 gph, and I can do 166 at 40 mpg at 8500' burning 4.5, but again, I'm running lean of peak. It uses a Jabiru 3300cc engine, and mine is a 2700cc Corvair, for a few more weeks, anyway. It supposedly takes off and lands quicker, so it must have more wing area. That and the nose gear probably explains a lot of the difference, but I don't know how a 3300cc engine can drink that much at 7500'.\n\nHere's an example of the tabulated data that comes out of the EIS, which I collect with the laptop that I always fly with. You can see that it stores one data point per second, and it's as rock steady as I can fly the plane. If you do the numbers on OAT (outside air temperature), IAS (indicated airspeed), barometric pressure, and indicated altitude, I was doing 151 mph True Airspeed while getting 40.8 miles per gallon. I've done better with more agressive leaning, but that ain't bad for just flying along.\n\nThe data is saved as tab delimited text, and then it's an easy matter to import into Excel later. It's collected by using an executable called EISlog.exe, available for $10 (with free DB-9 serial connector) from Grand Rapids Technologies. Serial to USB converters also work, but I've found that when I use one of those with a hub (to connect XM-WX weather and GPS) things can get fouled up depending on which device snags what COM port first. It's very dependent on what you kick off first, and sometimes it's still hosed, so my most recent laptop purchase had a serial port, and I'm thoroughly pleased by the cooperation between USB and serial device now.\n\nBy its nature though, you have to remember to save the file and rename it after the flight. If the laptop craps out before you save it (like halfway through the flight), you lose the information. That's why I save the info a few times during the course of a long flight, just in case I forgot to plug it in or something. I use a $20 115V inverter that's wired to a breaker and mounted under the panel to provide laptop power, although a 12V converter could be used in the \"cigarette lighter\" if my laptop didn't require 19 volts!\n\nI've posted an example of one of these files, in both raw space-delimited text, a html version of the spreadsheet (although it's missing the colored fields that make it easy to see where the measurements came from, and the Excel spreadsheet (preferred if you have Excel). This was a prop comparison run that I made between my usual Sensenich 54x58 propeller and a Sterba 56x56 propeller. Both runs are in the same file, because I never switched off the EIS while swapping props. The Sensenich prop was first. Note that the data is serial, so in the text file the last data point appears first. In the Excel file I've flipped the data so the first is at the top, but in the text file the end of the flight is at the top. This is easily done in Excel by inserting a column A that is nothing but a series of numbers, then using that column to invert the whole file, then deleting that column. The Excel file is formatted and labeled, making it far easier to understand what I did and what the results were. The large areas of green and blue were used to calculate average climb rates, while the yellow areas are top speeds. The two runs were around my usual test points, 1500' and 7500'.\n\nSince I'm a lazy scud, I just use this web-based True Airspeed Converter to do the dirty work.\n\nIn April of 2006 I did some tufting during various flight regimes, just playing around. I forget exactly what I was doing that caused this, but it's clear that some sort of Hoerner tips would stop it, and turn it into lift. Maybe I'll get around to testing that one of these days...\n\nSee more at Tufting"
