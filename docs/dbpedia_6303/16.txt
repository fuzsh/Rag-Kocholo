Propeller Ethos: No. 1 Commit to People

Eight ethos guide our work and serve as the foundation of our culture. That begins with our commitment to people which manifests itself in our interactions with colleagues, clients, and the community.

No. 2 Serving Exceptionally

Service is the heart of our business. Serving exceptionally is more than simply delivering what’s asked. It is approaching the work with intention and humility. It is helping clients along their journey. It is building trust.

No. 3 Do Good Work

Good work requires a love of what you do. It requires insatiable curiosity, an ability to see beyond what’s now to uncover what’s next. We take action to improve what’s around us.

No. 4 Be Humble Yet Smart Enough to Have an Ego

Clients want tangible results and an effortless experience. This means shifting the focus from the challenges and merits of our work to the larger goal of helping clients succeed. Their success is your success.

No. 5 Harness Grit

Easy is boring. Our individual and collective grit is what drives our exceptional results and keeps us coming back for more.

No. 6 Uplift Our Communities

Strong and sustainable partnerships are best forged when we live and work in the same communities as our clients. We are committed to giving back to our communities with time, strategic thinking, and support for our non-profit partners.

No. 7 Embrace Our Differences

Acceptance is the baseline and individualism and authenticity are encouraged. We welcome all dimensions of diversity and foster an inclusive culture where everyone is given equal opportunity to succeed. Our differences are what make us collectively stronger.
