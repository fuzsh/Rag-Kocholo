I want to start a listing of prop manufactures that will make a prop that can be used on a VW powered Sonerai.

Please add to the list.

Sterba Propellers (whatever size and pitch you want)

Prince Aircraft (whatever size and pitch you want)

Sensenich propellers (limited sizes, nothing under 54" dia)

Catto Propellers (will not make one for VW applications)

Gary Hertzler (limited sizes, not applicable to VW)

Props Inc (need details)

Tennessee Propellers (need details)

A couple of updates to this thread:

Add Cloudcars propellers to the list. A number of people from KR, Quickie II and Sonerai groups are seeing some pretty good performance from these props, especially for what they cost.

Sensenich now say they will make a prop under 54". However, I ordered one 6 months ago and have not heard a peep from them and it was 3 times the cost of a Cloudcars prop.

Jeff,

A friend was just talking to the people at sensenich about ordering his prop and lead times. They mentioned to him if he is getting close to finishing the plane and he still hasn't received his prop to get in contact with them. The guy was basically telling him the squeaky wheel gets the grease, or prop in this case. ;-)

Sadly, if you're being patient it may be at your cost.
