        "text": "By conventional standards, Barbra Streisand is not considered beautiful. ''On the one hand I'll be compared to an Egyptian sculpture and on the other hand people think I'm awful-looking,'' she said. ''My opinion of myself is probably a little bit of both.''\n\n''Since childhood,'' she added, ''my looks have always been talked about in some strange way.''\n\nPhysical beauty -- the obsession with it, the yearning for it, the relevance and meaning of it -- dominate not only Ms. Streisand's new film, ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' (Tri-Star), which will open on Friday, but also, in many ways, her life. ''There are traumatic moments like, 'Ma, I want to be an actress,' and the answer is, 'Well, you're not pretty enough; you better cut your nails off and become a typist so you'll have a job,' '' she said. ''When she saw me act for the first time she said, 'Your arms are too thin.' ''\n\nMs. Streisand was sipping tea late the other afternoon in the comfortable but elegant living room of her Los Angeles home, decorated with early American folk art and artifacts. Her third directorial effort, ''The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' in which she also stars, is essentially a romantic comedy about an ugly duckling turned princess. She acknowledges that the character bears some striking resemblances to her Fanny Brice role in ''Funny Girl,'' which made her a star more than 25 years ago. There is also a resemblance to her view of herself.\n\nMs. Streisand said she initially asked others to direct the movie, including Robert Zemeckis and Herbert Ross, but they declined, partly perhaps because of her reputation for being a perfectionist or difficult or both. ''At one point, I asked Garry Marshall, and he said to me, 'Are you going to tell me where to put the camera?' '' she said. ''And I thought, 'It will never work.' ''\n\nAdapted loosely by Richard LaGravenese from a French film of the same name, ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' is about a Columbia University literature professor (Ms. Streisand) whose yearning for romance is ignited by another teacher (Jeff Bridges), who has been hurt by so many passionate relationships that he yearns only for the friendship of a woman, without sex.\n\n''I wanted to examine the complications of relationships, I mean how hard it is, how difficult it is, to find people, especially in your middle years,'' said the 54-year-old actress, who was married to the actor Elliott Gould years ago and has a grown son, Jason Gould, also an actor. ''And at the end of the script, I wanted to explore this theme that I knew as a teen-ager when I went to the Loew's Kings in Brooklyn on Saturday afternoons to escape my life. And you see lovers kiss and you hear music play, and you wonder why your life isn't like that.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
