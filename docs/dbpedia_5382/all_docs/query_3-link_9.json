        "text": "“For All We Know”\n\nPerformed by: Barbra Streisand\n\nProduced by: Barbra Streisand & James Newton Howard\n\nWritten by: J. Fred Coots & Sam M. Lewis\n\nOrchestra Arranged and Conducted by: Johnny Mandel\n\nSaxophone Solo by: Kirk Whalum\n\nRecorded at Capitol Studios by: Shawn Murphy\n\nMixed at Schnee Studio by: Bill Schnee\n\nJohnny Mandel started working with Streisand on “For All We Know” in late spring 1991. “I played some synthesizer parts for her and she sang,” he said. “I worked out what chords I needed, then went home and wrote the arrangement.”\n\nMandel then took about a week to score the chart for the song before returning to the studio to record it. “The recording, done in June in Capitol Records' Studio A, didn't take long,” Mandel said. “Barbra came in, and we did eight or nine great takes, each one of which could have been a release.”\n\nStreisand wrote some interesting liner notes for this song:\n\nOne of the presents my son Jason gave me for my last birthday was a CD of the classic Billie Holiday album “Lady in Satin”—it was one of the few albums I'd ever bought when I was 16 years old.\n\nI needed a melody for a scene in THE PRINCE OF TIDES where Nick Nolte and I dance together at The Rainbow Room. One of the songs on Billie's record was “For All We Know”. It was so beautiful and the lyric was so perfect—as if it were written especially for the film ...\n\nKirk Whalum, the jazz saxophonist from Memphis, soloed on this track. “[Streisand] heard my version of 'For All We Know' and wanted me to be a part of the movie The Prince of Tides,” Whalum told Memphis Flyer. “In the studio, she sang it and I played the solo. Everybody was sort of holding their breath, because she can be a perfectionist. She looks over at me and says, 'What do you think?' Yeah, I'm a boy from Memphis sitting there in Hollywood and Barbra Streisand is asking me what I think. A moment that will live in infamy.”\n\n“Places That Belong To You”\n\nPerformed by: Barbra Streisand\n\nProduced by: James Newton Howard & Barbra Streisand\n\nMusic by: James Newton Howard\n\nLyrics by: Alan & Marilyn Bergman\n\nOrchestra Conducted by: Marty Paich\n\nArranged by: Brad Dechter, Marty Paich, Humme Mann\n\nRecorded at Sony Studios Scoring Stage by: Shawn Murphy\n\nMixed at Conway Recording by: John Arrias\n\nI had the great fortune to interview Marilyn and Alan Bergman for Barbra Archives when they were in Washington, D.C. in 2007. I asked them about “Places That Belong To You”.\n\nMatt Howe: I love that song.\n\nMarilyn Bergman: It’s a beautiful melody that James Newton Howard wrote.\n\nMH: I reviewed the lyrics and the song is from Barbra’s character’s perspective, right?\n\nAlan Bergman: You have a combination of the character and the story. Also, the melody is indigenous to that story.\n\nMB: Actually, it’s [Dr. Lowenstein’s] story. In the movie, it’s her story, in a way. It’s their relationship, I guess. The book is told from the perspective of [the character] Tom Wingo. At the end of the movie, as I remember, he’s driving over a bridge and he says her name (“Lowenstein, Lowenstein…”).\n\nAB: It’s ambiguous at the end, really.\n\nMB: It’s that idea that whenever there’s a deep relationship in one’s life, even though it’s in the past, there’s always a part – we’ve written about this a few times. We wrote it in “Where Do You Start” – there’s always a little part that stays, that sticks to the lining of your heart.\n\nAB: It’s the same idea, though. Something remains.\n\nMB: We really believe that. The idea keeps coming up.\n\nStreisand explained in her liner notes for the CD why she did not utilize this song in the actual movie:\n\nAs the director of THE PRINCE OF TIDES I felt it wasn't right for Barbra Streisand (or Susan Lowenstein) to sing at the end of the film. But it was such a beautiful melody that we asked Alan and Marilyn Bergman to write a lyric to it so I could include it on this soundtrack recording. If Lowenstein did sing, I think this is what she would say.\n\nBarbra elaborated about keeping the song in the movie to the Boston Globe in 1991: “It's his story,” she said of Nick Nolte's character. “That's why I didn't sing the song at the end of the movie. I would have been paid a lot of money to sing the song, as much as I got paid to produce. But I felt it wasn't right. It was his story and what right would I have to come in and sing this song? My character is a secondary character.”"
