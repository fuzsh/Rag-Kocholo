        "text": "Barbra Streisand is looking to make the final scene in The Tattooist of Auschwitz memorable and poignant as the credits roll after recording a new song, “Love Will Survive,” for the Peacock and Sky original drama.\n\nMarking her first ever recording for a TV series, Streisand has performed the end title anthem for the series about two young Jewish prisoners in the Nazi concentration camp who fall in love and commit themselves to survive the Holocaust together.\n\nHans Zimmer and Kara Talve composed the original song for the limited series that stars Harvey Keitel, Melanie Lynskey, Jonah Hauer-King, Anna Próchniak and Jonas Nay, and which Streisand recorded to in part recall the memory of the Holocaust and the specter of antisemitism resurfacing again.\n\n“Because of the rise in antisemitism around the world today, I wanted to sing ‘Love Will Survive’ in the context of this series, as a way of remembering the six-million souls who were lost less than 80 years ago. And also to say that even in the darkest of times, the power of love can triumph and endure,” Streisand said in a statement.\n\nThe lyrics to “Love Will Survive” were penned by Charlie Midnight, and the song will be released April 25, ahead of limited series premiering May 2. The Tattooist of Auschwitz is inspired by the real-life story of Lali and Gita Sokolov, which was captured in the Heather Morris book of the same title.\n\nThe six-parter sees Keitel playing an elderly Lali Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew who arrived at a nightmarish Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazis’ largest concentration and extermination camp during the Holocaust, in 1942. Sokolov worked as tätowierer (tattooist), who inked identification numbers onto fellow prisoners’ arms. As a young man, Sokolov, who is played by Jonah Hauer-King, tattoos the arm of Gita Sokolov (Anna Próchniak), only for the two young Jews to fall in love at first sight and pledge to survive the Nazi death factory together.\n\nStreisand had recorded the scores and end title songs for a host of movies, including Evergreen, The Way We Were, Nuts and Woman in Love. The song “Love Will Survive” is produced by Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher, with Streisand, Jay Landers and Russell Emanuel executive producing.\n\nDirected by Tali Shalom-Ezer, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is executive produced by Claire Mundell, Jacquelin Perske and Serena Thompson."
