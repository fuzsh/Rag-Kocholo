I don't enjoy public performances and being up on a stage.\n\n\"I don't enjoy the glamour. Like tonight, I am up on stage and my feet hurt,\" Streisand said after receiving a lengthy tribute at the Globes.\n\nStreisand reportedly earned more than $5m (£3m) for her millennium night's work. The concert also smashed box office records for ticket sales with takings of more $14m (£8.5m).\n\nNethertheless, after scaling down her tour dates in recent years, Streisand said directing would allow her to enjoy a slower, normal life with her husband of two years, actor James Brolin.\n\nGlowing career\n\nOver the last two decades, Streisand has also collected more Golden Globe awards than any other entertainer, including best actress for Funny Girl and A Star is Born.\n\nDirecting: 1983's Yentl was Streisand's first big venture\n\nAfter her latest accolade - awarded for \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment field\" - the star gave her thoughts on success.\n\n\"I've been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good,\" she said.\n\n\"It's easy to be sort of good. If you care so much you kind of get punished for it.\"\n\nAfter Funny Girl in 1968, Streisand became one of the top female box office stars of the Seventies with movies such as The Main Event and A Star is Born.\n\nBut 1983 was when she also began achieving as a director. Her first big venture, Yentl, also saw Streisand taking on the role of producer, writer and star.\n\nSince then, she has had directing successes with The Prince of Tides in 1991 and The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996 - projects for which she again took on multiple roles including that of star."
