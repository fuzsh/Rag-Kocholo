        "text": "Columbia Records released Comedy Highlights and Music from the Soundtrack – The Owl and the Pussycat in 1971. The vinyl LP featured actual dialogue from the film, mixed with the rock songs by Blood, Sweat & Tears.\n\nThe album has never appeared on CD.\n\nBack in the 1970s, dialogue albums were often released. The home video market had not yet arrived, and there was really no way to see a movie again after it played in your local movie theater. But a soundtrack album with dialogue and music was a way to relive the movie in your own living room.\n\nA review in Billboard (1/2/1971) stated: “This soundtrack is actually dialog between Barbra Streisand and George Segal, extracted from the movie. The music that is heard is performed and written by Blood, Sweat & Tears and fits in with the dialog quite well. It is a big band sound with a little rock added for seasoning. The dialog itself runs the gamut from absurdly sublime material to simply ridiculous material.”\n\nIn 2014, Blood, Sweat & Tears released an album titled Rare, Rarer & Rarest which contains only their music for The Owl and the Pussycat—there is no Barbra Streisand/George Segal dialogue.\n\nThe information contained in these pages represents historical documentation and is intended for personal, noncommercial and educational use only.
