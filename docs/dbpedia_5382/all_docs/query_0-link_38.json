        "text": "Barbra Streisand's The Mirror Has Two Faces was the ultimate vanity trip as far as movies go, so it's surprising that she only makes her presence felt on two tracks on the film's soundtrack. Most of the album is a hodgepodge of songs performed in the movie, ranging from a new Richard Marx song and David Sanborn's slick version of \"Try a Little Tenderness\" to Luciano Pavarotti singing Puccini's Nessun Dorma. Although all of this music is fine, it doesn't quite hold together as a consistent album, especially when the two new Streisand songs are the only reason most people will be purchasing the album. And, while they aren't bad, neither \"All of My Life\" or the Barbra and Bryan Adams duet \"I Finally Found Someone\" are particularly distinguished; the latter becomes stronger upon each play, while the former is merely pleasant. Both songs are essential for any Streisand completist, but it's hard not to feel somewhat cheated by the album's inconsistency.\n\n&copy Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo\n\nMore info\n\nAlbum review\n\nBarbra Streisand's The Mirror Has Two Faces was the ultimate vanity trip as far as movies go, so it's surprising that she only makes her presence felt on two tracks on the film's soundtrack.
