        "text": "There is a revolutionary idea lurking beneath the sheen of Barbra Streisand's third directorial effort, The Mirror Has Two Faces. Romantic love between mature adults without sex? What a novelty, especially in the movies; a bedroom farce in which only one partner wants to slip between the sheets.\n\nThe fact that it's the man saying no almost shifts the film into science fiction, except that screenwriter Richard LaGravanese so literately maps out this comedy of abstinence. Mild-mannered hunk professor Gregory Larkin may be the new sensitive male prototype; men have a reputation as \"dogs\" but Gregory is neutered, affectionate and obedient to the notion that courtly love can be upheld in the sex-fueled 1990s.\n\nIt's a difficult premise to buy into, since Gregory is played by that underrated actor and handsome guy Jeff Bridges. Even in a bow tie, scribbling equations on a blackboard, Bridges can't disguise his rascally sex appeal. We learn that Gregory had an intimate relationship with a woman played by supermodel Elle McPherson and we're not surprised. When she dumps him, Gregory's sudden decision to seek a new companion without regard to physical appearance or sex sets the movie-machinery gears clicking into place.\n\nGregory places a suitable ad in the personals column. One unwitting applicant is a fellow professor at Columbia, Rose Morgan, played with as much frump as the buttah-glamorous Streisand can muster. He sneaks into one of her stand-up academic routines in which the topic turns to (click, click) courtly love without lust. Gregory likes what he hears and the risque games begin.\n\nSince Rose's ad reply was sent by her superior-in-all-ways sister Claire (Mimi Rogers), she isn't aware of Gregory's celibacy. Streisand and Bridges have their best moments as reality sets in, a pair of understated screwballs who don't say a thing about the twin beds he selects for their home. La Gravanese doesn't feel as comfortable with double entendres so much as soliloquies _ he wrote The Fisher King, after all _ so the muted humor builds at a deliberate pace. Very French, as befitting the screenwriter's inspiration, the obscure import Le Miroir a Deux Faces.\n\nAlong the way, we discover why Rose's self-esteem has been stunted: Lauren Bacall takes a marvelous curtain call in her long career as Hannah Morgan, who hasn't seen the beauty behind her daughter's cosmetics-challenged face. Bacall sweeps through the movie with such confidence that even La Streisand seems humbled. Watch the moment when Rose asks her mother what it felt like to be beautiful all those years. Bacall's close-up and response betray bygone eras for Hannah and Hollywood.\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces loses its bite when Streisand finally succumbs to lesser cinematic instincts, right after Rose and Gregory nearly give in to their respective desires. The director has a choice: Cap off what has been an interesting flight of intelligent sexual tension with a romantic eruption or douse the fire. The filmmakers choose the latter, sending The Mirror Has Too Faces into another hour of misty-eyed detours _ the best involve Bacall and fellow survivor Brenda Vaccaro _ to get to a fade-out kiss preordained by the stars' billing.\n\nThe extra footage causes the plot to contradict itself a few times and those provocative ideas of the first half get lost in the shuffle. By the end of the film, I wasn't sure if the message was that beauty is only skin deep or a necessity, whether sex is important or not to a relationship. When in doubt, cavort in Manhattan streets with Streisand and Bryan Adams crooning on the soundtrack.\n\nStreisand's renowned control over her productions has resulted in a smooth, professional film, without any signs of discord on the set that resulted in several firings when things weren't up to her standards. She's less self-conscious, more straightforward in her presentation than in Yentl or The Prince of Tides. The role gives her a chance to dull her image, and her performance is her most convincing riff of self-effacement in years. Streisand has rare clout for a woman in Hollywood and she used it to an admirable end.\n\nBridges is always enjoyable to watch and the role of Gregory allows him to plumb comic instincts he hasn't used in 20 years. The rustiness shows in his voice, which lifts to a higher octave when he's stressed, and in Gregory's unfunny dizzy spells. Not enough, however, to keep Bridges from racking up points as a romantic lead without his characters' usual dark side. Although any movie that still relies on piano man Marvin Hamlisch for background music could use a little of that danger.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW B\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces\n\nDirector: Barbra Streisand\n\nCast: Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Pierce Brosnan\n\nScreenplay: Richard LaGravanese, based on the film Le Miroir a Deux Faces by Andre Cayatte and Gerard Oury\n\nRating: PG-13; sexual situations, profanity\n\nRunning time: 126 min."
