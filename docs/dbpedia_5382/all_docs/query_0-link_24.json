        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nIn this romantic comedy-drama, Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand) is a plain and pudgy middle-aged college English professor who shares a house with her mother, Hannah (Lauren Bacall).\n\nRose got the brains in her family, but her sister Claire (Mimi Rogers) got the good looks, and as Claire prepares for her wedding to Alex (Pierce Brosnon), Rose can't help but despair over her longtime crush on Alex.\n\nGregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) teaches mathematics at the same school as Rose, and he has come to the conclusion that sex serves no purpose but to complicate relationships between men and women; after a series of disastrous romantic affairs, Gregory is looking for an intellectual relationship with a woman — and nothing more.\n\nAfter placing a personal ad that Claire answers on behalf of Rose, Gregory joins Rose's lecture hall as she discusses the role of chaste love in literature, and he's intrigued; he takes her out on a date and is impressed by Rose's quick wit and broad range of knowledge.\n\nGregory is so taken with Rose that he proposes marriage, but under the condition that theirs be strictly a meeting of the minds, without sexual relations.\n\nWhile Rose is very much attracted to the handsome mathematician, the prospect of spending the rest of her life either alone or with Hannah seems far worse than a marriage without passion, and she agrees to his proposal.\n\nHowever, Rose's affection for Gregory makes it difficult for her to stop with a handshake, and one night she puts on her best nightgown and attempts to seduce her husband, much to Gregory's annoyance and confusion.\n\nGregory leaves on a lecture tour shortly afterward, and after Hannah reassures a heartbroken Rose that she was beautiful as a child, Rose goes on a crash course in self-improvement.\n\nShe goes on a diet, starts working out, changes her hairstyle, learns a few makeup tricks, and revamps her wardrobe, and by the time Gregory returns, he discovers that Rose has changed.\n\nCan Rose have it all: love, lust, sex and romance?\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces was Barbra 's sixteenth film and third as director. The movie continued her big screen exploration of the mystery of appearances, the intricacy of relationships, the possibilities of personal transformation, and the part love plays in it all.\n\nBarbra Streisand summed up the movie: “The theme of The Mirror Has Two Faces is that beauty is in the heart of the beholder. It also deals with the fact that the world often mirrors back to you your own perception of yourself, which is usually based on your experiences as a child. It is a romantic comedy that has serious overtones dealing with mother-daughter issues, the beauty myth, self-esteem, transformation. It's about two disillusioned university professors who enter into a sexless marriage and then fall in love.”\n\nScreenwriter Richard LaGravenese related, “The illusion of superficial beauty and the sexual intensity it assures creates enormous problems. We are bombarded with advertisements, movies and television commercials in which impossibly perfect people hear fabulous music when they are attracted to each other. Normal looks, normal attractions, normal emotions seem somehow lacking. Isn't it curious, and confusing, that while more and more people are devoting greater effort to working on their inner selves, the frantic search for beauty is more desperate and intense than ever?”\n\nTriStar and its Chairman Mike Medavoy acquired the rights to the French film in the early 1990s as a vehicle for the comedy actor John Candy. Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, The Bridges Of Madison County) recalled that after he watched the 1958 film, he came to TriStar “with a different take, a romantic-comedy take.”\n\nLaGravenese explained, “[Barbra] became involved about late ’91 or early ’92. She had a lot of reservations about doing Mirror. She was very aware that the material was something she had already explored in the early part of her career.”\n\nStreisand remembered, “When I first read the script, the woman had plastic surgery, and I thought that wasn't right. I was more interested in self-esteem from within, not from without.” That didn’t keep the showbiz columns from reporting that Streisand would star in a movie about plastic surgery, and that her own looks would be digitally altered by George Lucas’ special effects house, Industrial Light and Magic.\n\nBut at that time, Streisand was also developing other films. “I was going to do The Normal Heart,” she said, a movie version she worked for years on which was based on Larry Kramer’s play about the AIDS crisis. “That was going to be my next project … I couldn’t raise the money, and then the actors I wanted weren’t available—they wanted me to wait until this spring coming up. So, then I reread The Mirror Has Two Faces after working on it with Richard in 1992 and not thinking it was right then. The studio also wouldn’t pay me my salary, and I thought, ‘I’m just not going to do it anymore.’ So, I didn’t make the movie for four years. But I reread the script and I thought, no, no, no, I see this, and I can do this and maybe expand the mother-daughter relationship, and maybe this element could happen. It began to really interest me, so I made the movie.”\n\nStreisand vacillated between directing and starring or hiring another director. She asked Robert Zemeckis and Herb Ross to helm the picture, but they declined. “At one point, I asked Garry Marshall, and he said to me, ‘Are you going to tell me where to put the camera?’” she said. “And I thought, ‘It will never work.’”\n\n“I hadn’t directed a movie in eight years, and I was totally frightened,” Barbra stated, referring to her last film, The Prince of Tides. “But after getting into it, it was, ‘Oh, yeah, I remember this,’ and trusting my instincts.”\n\nShe went on to say, “One of the reasons I decided to do The Mirror Has Two Faces is that it had a happy ending. I was tired of doing movies where the woman never gets the guy.” Streisand also found aspects of the character, as LaGravenese had written it, that appealed to her. “I must ask him, did he think of me at all? I never asked him that question. We had a lot in common, I would say, and that's why one chooses to play that role -- you understand that character.”\n\nLaGravenese confessed that the Mirror screenplay was challenging for him. “Honestly, I feel that Mirror was something which I never cracked,” he said. “I wrote four different versions of it, and I liked the third version the best, but it was the fourth version which got made. I did a version where she doesn’t get plastic surgery, and I did another where she does. In one version the surgery changed her personality, in another it didn’t. In the third draft, I came up with a character who represented that lover who comes in and out of your life, and you’re so in love with them that every time they leave they break your heart, and when they reappear they can open you up again. You have no immunity to them. And that’s why in that draft the Jeff Bridges character decides that he wants to have a loveless marriage, because he’s so obsessed with this woman that he can’t put himself at emotional risk. But I just never felt like I cracked that version.”\n\n“Revised First Draft” September 7, 1991\n\nThis early version of the screenplay by Richard LaGravenese reads very similar to the final movie script. There are a few major differences, though:\n\nThe script opens in flashback, with college-aged Gregory screaming outside the window of the red-haired girl he loves even though she broke up with him. This scene is meant to bookend the final scene where Gregory yells outside Rose’s window.\n\nFor the first few drafts, Rose’s mother goes to see Gregory at the university for lunch, where she asks him what his intentions with her daughter are. In later drafts, Rose has Gregory over for dinner, where Hannah grills him at the table.\n\nRose’s mother doesn’t treat her to a makeup makeover – she pays for plastic surgery. “[Rose’s] jaw and chin seemed to have been tightened. Her eyes lifted. Her eyebrows thinned. Her hair lightened. She is about thirty pounds lighter.”\n\nAfter Greg and Rose go their different ways, Rose accepts the attention of one of her sexy students, Luke. He romances her on his rooftop, and they sleep together. Later, she tries to make her sister, Claire, jealous by telling her, “I fucked an eighteen year old blonde God the other night.”\n\nAlthough Harrison Ford’s name was tossed around as a potential romantic lead for Streisand, it was Jeff Bridges who got the job. Bridges was an established star of such films as The Last Picture Show (with Barbra’s What’s Up, Doc? director, Peter Bogdanovich), Starman, and The Fabulous Baker Boys. “I’ve always liked his work,” Streisand said. “He’s a wonderful actor, and I think he’s very sexy. You can just feel his love for women.”\n\nJeff Bridges – the son of Lloyd and brother of Beau – appreciated Streisand’s talent. “As a director, she’s terrific,” he said. “The whole perfectionistic thing works for her I think, as far as a director. When you come to a person who has that much talent and is so highly thought of, we would often have conversations where she has this real down-to-earth manner. She values that, and she values vulnerability.”\n\n“I never once felt I was acting in a scene with the director,” Bridges said. “She was totally Rose each time the cameras rolled. Yet she has this uncanny ability to view the entire scene and all the characters – but you’re never aware of it during the scene. Then, immediately after we cut, she knows everything that’s happened and what was perfect and what needed to be changed. It is astounding.”\n\nBarbra Streisand cast the legendary Lauren Bacall to play her mother, Hannah, in The Mirror Has Two Faces. Bacall, born Betty Joan Perske, made her film debut in To Have and Have Not in 1944, starring alongside Humphrey Bogart. She made three more movies with Bogart, who she married in 1945. Lauren Bacall transitioned to a Broadway when she starred in ‘70s and ‘80s musicals like Applause and Woman of the Year; she also married actor Jason Robards – Barbra’s costar in her 1967 television special, The Belle of 14th Street. Mirror was Bacall’s first major role in years, spending most of the 1990s doing small film roles.\n\nIn her memoir, Bacall wrote: “I was called to go to [Barbra’s] apartment and read a scene with her, playing her mother. For actors, auditions never cease.” Bacall wrote that “I was finally called back to the living room. I'll never forget the setting. Barbra and Cis [Corman] were seated on a small sofa, Barbra pointing out some of her beautiful and valuable antiques. She said: ‘You were very good. We'll be in touch.’ As I headed for the door, Barbra said: ‘So, you think you could play my mother?’ I replied, ‘Yes, I can play your mother.’”\n\nAbout a week later, Bacall’s agent called her with the news she’d been cast. “What a joyous moment that was. I was truly happy, thrilled at the prospect, the best part I'd had in years. I had seen movies that Barbra had directed and knew how good she was. The movie was to be shot in New York, which was ideal for me as I could be at home and sleep in my own bed.”\n\nStreisand explained that Bacall “had a very good idea, because the mother didn’t work in the first script. And she said, ‘Well, what does she do all day? Because you have to cook dinner for her.’ And I said, ‘You know, that is a good idea, you should go to work.’ Then, I remembered growing up as a 13-year- old with my best friend Susan Dworkowitz, and her mother was a cosmetician. So I thought, and since the theme, one of the subtexts of this movie is beauty and the application of beauty products, and all that outer stuff, she became a cosmetician. She wears just a little too much rouge, you know?”\n\nStreisand hired comedy actor Dudley Moore (Arthur, 10, Six Weeks) to portray Henry, Gregory’s friend. Streisand filmed two scenes with Moore at Columbia University right at the beginning of the shooting schedule. Moore tried ad libbing his lines, which did not please director Streisand. When she asked for precise line readings from Moore, the crew had to produce large cue cards to assist his memory. But Moore still wasn’t delivering the scene, so they wrapped the day’s work, and Streisand met privately with Moore, asking if he was okay. “They fired me because I couldn't remember my lines after a certain point. It was devastating,” Moore told Barbara Walters.\n\nStreisand managed to get her Owl and the Pussycat costar, George Segal, to step into the role. The newspapers had a field day with the news; they said Moore’s firing was another example of Streisand as an out-of-control diva director. The truth is that Moore caused the film to fall behind schedule, and Streisand had no choice but to replace him. Time would reveal that Moore’s unprofessional actions on set were caused by the first symptoms of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a brain disorder that would kill him in 2002.\n\nGeorge Segal appeared on George Hamilton and Alana Stewart’s daytime talk show and was asked about working with Barbra, as he was in the middle of filming. “She said, ‘Well, how do you feel now that we’re playing together and now I’m directing you?’ But it feels great because she’s really good at it, and she gets inside an actor’s head. She brings out the best in you.”\n\nVaccaro, a star for years on the Broadway stage and in movies like Midnight Cowboy, Once is Not Enough, and Capricorn One, was also good friends with Streisand for “a very long time. She is a wonderful friend, extremely loyal and devoted to her friends.”\n\n“I first met Barbra in New York when she was doing I Can Get It For You Wholesale, and I was doing Cactus Flower,” Vaccaro stated. “Elliott Gould, her husband to be, and father of their son, Jason, was also in the musical with her. That’s how I met them both. We were across the street from each other.”\n\nDo you know who really wanted the role of Rose’s best friend? Donna Karan – Streisand’s best friend. The iconic designer told columnist Liz Smith: “I wanted to be in that movie. I told Barbra I would be perfect for the role of her character’s best friend. I begged and pleaded. She just laughed.”\n\nYears later, speaking with Bravo’s Andy Cohen, Karan revealed more. “I told her I wouldn’t do a collection, I would take off and do the movie,” Karan said. Streisand wanted Karan to read a scene. “Why? I can’t remember lines,” Karan replied. Andy Cohen asked: “You wanted to, what, just ad lib it?” Karan replied, “Totally.”\n\nMr. Brosnan had just filmed his first movie as James Bond — GoldenEye — and his work on The Mirror Has Two Faces had to coincide with his publicity commitments to the Bond film. But Streisand made it work and was thrilled to have handsome Brosnan opposite her as the object of Rose’s affection, Alex.\n\nBrosnan toasted Streisand when she received the 2013 Lincoln Center Chaplin Award. At the podium he said: “When I took that job to play Alex in ‘The Mirror Has Two Faces,’ all I really knew about Barbra was that she had a reputation for the two T words: Talented and Temperamental. I quickly discovered that the first T word, Talented, was 100 percent on the mark. As a director she was funny and accessible, quirky and intelligent. She was also connected to every step of the film. So, for me, the second T stands for the word Thorough. To explain this, we one day had a walk-and-talk scene. Before we began she didn't like the tie I had picked out to wear. I thought, Okay, she's the director. I had no ego about this when it comes to wardrobe, so I went and got another tie. She didn't like that one either. So I went and got another one. She didn't like that one any better than the first one. I realized then that the solution was simple: Let her pick the tie and tell me what to wear and what to do. I'm a married man, so it's something I'm used to.”\n\nIn the role of Barry Neufeld, Rose’s geeky suitor, Streisand cast her old What’s Up, Doc? costar, Austin Pendleton. “I loved the part,” Pendleton said. “It’s a very, very small part. I don’t know if I would have done it for anybody else, but it’s a great part.” Pendleton auditioned with Streisand for the role. “Well, a couple of days before she sent the script. I learned my lines in about a minute and a half. I went in there, and we talked a little bit, and I read the whole part for her, which took about three or four minutes\n\nPendleton enjoyed working with Barbra the Director. “She is exactly as she is an actress – very supportive. She understands exactly what she’s asking from you. And then she’s also in the scene. She’s like Woody Allen in that way. You can be playing a scene with them, and they’re completely in it. You look in their eyes, and they’re right there with you. And then they say, ‘Cut! OK, I think that light needs to be moved.’ You don’t know how they do it.”\n\nIn general, though, the set of Mirror was a harmonious place for Streisand and her actors.\n\nLauren Bacall wrote in her memoir: “When we started shooting, I saw first-hand how Barbra functioned. It was very odd for us at the beginning because she would be directing the scene behind the camera, then come around in front of the camera and act in the scene. How she did it, I'll never know.\n\n“She is meticulous in her direction — every detail is as important to her as the words. I remember her telling me that she woke up at four o'clock in the morning and sketched exactly what the cape I wore should look like. Then she couldn't go back to sleep.”\n\nStreisand enjoyed directing the legendary Bacall. “I loved Betty, but since she hadn’t been in a film in a while, she was a bit insecure and tended to overdo things. First of all, I would tell them never to cut the camera. ‘I’ll tell you to cut, but don’t cut.’”\n\nFor the scene late in the movie between Hannah and Rose in the kitchen, Streisand wanted verisimilitude from Bacall’s performance. She said: “After working all day we were rehearsing a scene that we were going to shoot the next morning and I could see that she was very tired. Her hair was messy, she had a toothpick in her mouth. And I thought, this is good, this is good, keep the toothpick, this is it, let’s just stay here, we'll stay a little later and get this on film right now. She said, ‘But I don’t know the lines yet.’ And I said, ‘That doesn’t matter, they're on the chair over there and you can look if you need to. Meanwhile, just talk to me. Tell me what you feel. Tell me about your life now.’\n\n“She started off with something like, ‘I thought I was going to be young forever.’ And then, by engaging her in real conversation beyond the script, the scene now had this whole other layer, about growing older. She was letting us into her life. It was a golden moment, the kind I always look for on screen. They reach out and touch everyone because they’re so true. And the Academy recognized her performance with an Oscar nomination.”\n\nEarlier in the movie, Rose asks Hannah what it was like being beautiful. Streisand said Bacall’s “first reaction was ‘Wonderful, wonderful!’ And then I say, ‘Cut,’ you know, and they have to reset the camera …” Streisand spoke with Bacall one-on-one, saying, “‘You know, Betty, when you did those movies with Humphrey Bogart and all that, what was that like?’ And she went — she thought. That’s what I wanted to see, her really think. And she said, ‘It was wonderful.’ That’s what’s in the film. Got it.”\n\nIt was December 1995 when Streisand’s director of photography, Dante Spinotti (Nell, L.A. Confidential), left the film, citing “creative differences.” Streisand told columnist Liz Smith it was a “mutual parting of the ways” — they just didn't have a “shared vision” about the movie. A source with the production told the New York Times, “[Streisand] had been complaining about the camera work almost from the beginning of the production. There were too many gauzes around the lens. Her eyes – one of her best features – got very soft.”\n\nJeff Bridges produced a photography book of the wide-angle photos he took during the filming of the movie. In it, he wrote, “Dante and Barbra butted heads a bit. Something had to give … and it was Dante. This was the end of one of the many seasons of our movie.”\n\nMost of Spinotti’s crew quit the film shortly after, and Streisand brought Andrzej Barkowiak (Nuts) in to finish photographing The Mirror Has Two Faces. Both cinematographers share screen credit.\n\nStreisand also dismissed editor Alan Heim and replaced him with Jeff Werner. Although reporters blamed “diva Streisand,” a 2017 interview with Heim revealed the real reason for his dismissal was probably the difficult transition from the old fashioned Moviola to the new, digital Avid machine – a video editing software that became more commonplace in film editing in the mid-1990s. “Sony wanted me to do it on the Avid. So now I have to learn another system. And Sony said they would give me an instructor,” Heim explained. “Well they gave me the guy who was doing maintenance on the lot and my assistant and I, she never worked on a film either on Avid … we spent three intense days just stuffing whatever I could into my head. And at one point I remember just putting my head on the keyboard, three or four, in the afternoon on Friday and I said, ‘That’s it. I can’t do anymore of this.’”\n\nStreisand and her crew returned to New York at the top of May 1996 to film the last scenes of the movie. Streisand revealed, “I was going to do this helicopter shot that went up, you had to see Central Park, you had to see the whole city. So we had to postpone shooting for a month to come back when the leaves were on the trees. Meanwhile, we still did the scene with long underwear under our clothes.”\n\nBridges and Streisand’s street dance was filmed outside 505 West End Avenue. Streisand experienced a serendipitous moment at the location. “A man who lived there came over and told he me he remembered me when I was 18 taking [voice] lessons there with my first teacher, Peter [Daniels],” she said. The co-op building was paid $2,500 a day for the film crew to shoot in and around the apartments. (In 2018, one of the apartments in the building was listed for $2.9 million!)\n\nMirror filmed at this location from about 2:00 a.m. until dawn. “I thought it was someone blasting their car radio,” Shanti Narra told the New York Times. “Then I realized it was Barbra Streisand. At first I was annoyed, but my roommate said, ‘How often do you get Barbra Streisand singing and dancing down your street?’”\n\nStreisand imagined the final scene differently than what was written in the script. “One of our drafts had a jingle of an ice cream truck going by. And I said that’s not truthful. Why would an ice cream truck be going by at six in the morning, you know?”\n\nWhile she was scouting locations for the film and standing in front of the apartment building, “this idea came to me about the man in the window, and Puccini and, see what I’m saying?”\n\nProduction provided sound proofing blankets to the neighbors, plus blacking-out material for 115 windows to keep the light of the floodlights out. Some residents of 505 West End were relocated by the production to nearby hotels.\n\nWhile filming, Streisand and Bridges danced to “You Put a Move On My Heart” by an artist named Tamia, produced by Quincy Jones (the movie's theme song hadn't been written yet). Water trucks had to wet down the pavement every thirty minutes – this is a filmmaking trick (called a “wet-down”) and it makes the otherwise dull and boring black pavement look sexy and sleek."
