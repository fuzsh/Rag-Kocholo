        "text": "SHOULD'VE WON: \"The Way He Makes Me Feel,\" Yentl\n\nNow this is a toughie.\n\nIn 1983 Best Original Song, a category dominated by Flashdance and Yentl, I could really make a solid case for four of the nominees. (The fifth, \"Over You,\" from the Oscar-winning Robert Duvall vehicle Tender Mercies, is a sloppy piece of adult contemporary, performed by the usually great Betty Buckley yet sounding more like the Oscar-winning dreck from Maureen McGovern in the early '70s.)\n\nFlashdance is not a great picture. It's a supremely silly one, though it does work on at least two levels - as a star-making debut vehicle for the charming Jennifer Beals and as the bearer of a plenty memorable soundtrack.\n\nIndeed, while \"Flashdance...What a Feeling\" is not my personal pick in '83, I cannot knock its victory too much. Performed and written by the reliable Irene Cara, with a moving and iconic Giorgio Moroder production, it's a record that begins as a slow, steady ballad for Cara before morphing into an irresistible dance number that recalls the best of '80s pop. I'm also quite fond of the other Flashdance nominee, \"Maniac,\" which, like the Cara-Moroder tune, is instantly recognizable from the get-go. \"Maniac,\" which marked a collaboration between writer-performer Michael Sembello and the legendary producer Phil Ramone, was (to my great delight) inspired by the 1980 slasher cult classic of the same name.\n\nAlas, much as I enjoy the Flashdance tracks, I think I'm ever-so-slightly more enamored with the two nominees here from Yentl, Barbra Streisand's directional debut which, really ever since its release, has gotten its fair share of shit from film critics but I would argue is an impressive, even exemplary piece of cinema, one of the last great, ambitious original musicals on the big screen.\n\nWhat's interesting is the Academy didn't even nominate my favorite song from Yentl here, the sublime finale \"A Piece of Sky.\" Instead, they went for arguably the picture's two most recognizable tunes, \"Papa, Can You Hear Me\" and \"The Way He Makes Me Feel.\" Both are stunningly performed by Streisand, with incredible music and lyrics from Michel Legrand and Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all four artists are completely operating at the tops of their game here. I do think \"Papa\" is perhaps tad too...let's say, on the nose, lyrically speaking. \"The Way He Makes Me Feel\" is the more intriguing and affecting song, particularly within the context of the picture.\n\nThe Oscar-winners ranked (thus far)..."
