        "text": "Barbra Streisand has recorded a new song which will serve as the end-title theme for upcoming Stan Original Series The Tattooist of Auschwitz, premiering on May 2.\n\nIt's the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award-winning singer's first-ever song pegged for a TV series and marks her first release of new and original material since her 'Walls' album in 2018.\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz will premiere May 2 only on Stan.\n\nThe song, titled 'Love Will Survive', will come out globally via her longtime label Columbia Records on April 25.\n\n\"Because of the rise in antisemitism around the world today, I wanted to sing Love Will Survive in the context of this series as a way of remembering the six-million souls who were lost less than 80 years ago,\" Streisand said.\n\n\"And also to say that even in the darkest of times, the power of love can triumph and endure.\"\n\nLove Will Survive is composed by two-time Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer in collaboration with Emmy-nominee Kara Talve, part of the Bleeding Fingers Music composer collective, and Grammy-winner Walter Afanasieff, with lyrics by Grammy and Golden Globe-nominee Charlie Midnight.\n\nZimmer and Talve have also composed the original score for the upcoming, six-part, limited series which stars Harvey Keitel, Melanie Lynskey, Jonah Hauer-King, Anna Próchniak and Jonas Nay.\n\nWATCH: Stan drops official trailer of adaptation of The Tattooist of Auschwitz starring Harvey Keitel\n\nStreisand, whose career spans over six decades and includes multiple award-winning and global hits such as her own composition Evergreen, The Way We Were and Woman in Love, is accompanied on this new recording by the world-class London Symphony Orchestra conducted by William Ross.\n\nThe song is produced by multiple Grammy winners Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher.\n\nBarbra Streisand, Jay Landers and Russell Emanuel are Executive Producers.\n\nThe Stan Original Series The Tattooist of Auschwitz is the story of one man, Lali (Hauer-King), a Slovakian Jew, who, in 1942, was deported to Auschwitz, the concentration camp where over a million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.\n\nShortly after arrival, Lali was made one of the Tätowierer (tattooist), charged to ink identification numbers onto fellow prisoners' arms.\n\nOne day, he met Gita (Próchniak) when tattooing her prisoner number on her arm, leading to a love that defied the horrors around them.\n\nSo began a courageous and unforgettable story. Under constant guard from a volatile Nazi SS officer Stefan Baretzki (Jonas Nay), Lali and Gita became determined to keep each other alive.\n\nIn Pictures\n\nA closer look into the cast of Billions' lives away from the series\n\nHow two co-stars suffered unimaginable tragedy.\n\nView Gallery\n\nAround 60 years later, Lali (Keitel) now in his 80's, meets aspiring writer Heather Morris (Lynskey).\n\nRecently widowed, Lali finds the courage to tell the world his story. In recounting his past to Heather, Lali finally confronts the traumatic ghosts of his youth and relives his memories of falling in love in the darkest of places.\n\nClaire Mundell, Executive Producer for Synchronicity Films, adds: \"Barbra Streisand is one of the most renowned artists in the world, and we are deeply honoured to be working with her.\n\n\"Barbra and her team have crafted the most beautiful song, based on Hans' and Kara's main theme for the show, and it sums up the key message of the series – love will survive.\n\n\"Recording the song with Barbra's iconic vocals and William Ross conducting the LSO at Abbey Road Studios was an unforgettable moment and a memory I will treasure forever.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to honour the memory of Lali and Gita in this way, with this beautiful original piece of music.\"\n\nDirected by Tali Shalom-Ezer, the Stan Original Series The Tattooist of Auschwitz is executive produced by Claire Mundell through her company Synchronicity Films and is produced in association with Sky Studios and All3Media International. Australian Jacquelin Perske is Executive Producer and lead writer alongside episode writers Evan Placey (Associate Producer) and Gabbie Asher.
