        "text": "The thing that made me laugh was that Barbra the Director shot that to show how gorgeous Barbra the Star was.\n\nIt was like when Barbra the Director had Barbra the Star look in a reflection to see beautiful she was in The Prince of Tides.\n\nFunny, because the movie theater I was at, there were whistles and cheers when this scene was played. One guy even went \"Owwww!\" which elicited some laughs.\n\nShe should have been nominated for Best Director for this.\n\n[quote] She should have been nominated for Best Director for this.\n\nPlease tell me you're kidding. Some amazing movies came out in 1996 (like \"La Promesse\", which is one of the greatest films ever made) and you think Babula deserved a BD nomination for this?! You better start watching some real movies, hon.\n\nR15 Nope, I'm motivated by my good taste in movies.\n\nC'mon, it's obvious that Babula's film career was largely a failure, thanks to her gigantic ego. She's been in the biz for more than 50 years and \"Funny Girl\" remains the only good film she's ever done.\n\nI know that some people have nostalgic memories of some of her other movies (like that godawful \"A Star is Born\" remake) but I wasn't around yet back then so I can judge her films more objectively.\n\n[quote](like \"La Promesse\", which is one of the greatest films ever made)\n\n[quote]I'm motivated by my good taste in movies.\n\nI think this speaks for itself.\n\nSlap some subtitles on a movie and have the actors speak in French and people think it's a masterpiece. Greatest ever made, too!\n\nSo, has anyone seen the French film Le miroir à deux faces (starring the gorgeous Michele Morgan) that this movie was based on? I'd love to watch it but I can't find a subtitled version anywhere.\n\nApparently the transformation is much more drastic in that one (the leading character even goes under the knife to become more beautiful). And it looks like Morgan had to sport a huge pinocchio-like prosthetic honker in her \"before\" scenes.\n\nR30 Yeah, j'adore MM too. I even made a DL thread when she died but it didn't get many responses. I was hoping more DLers would comment on her sexual orientation, because I always got a strong lesbo vibe from her.\n\nAnd I love that film (though the correct english title is \"The Proud and the Beautiful\"). Don't know why, but I still can't get that scene where she searches the pockets of her contagious husband's body to find his wallet out of my head. I'm not a huge fan of Sartre, but his script for that film was pure perfection.\n\nWho could ever forget sourpuss Stephen Bogart rolling his eyes when Mme. Binoche stole his momma Oscar? And that forced smile on Betty's face was equally painful to watch.\n\nIt was obvious Binoche's performance was miles ahead of Bacall's, who didn't really have much to do in The Mirror. But then again, people have been given unofficial lifetime achievement Oscars for much more insignificant roles - like Don Ameche's bizarre win for Cocoon. Did he even have any fucking lines in that film?\n\nI can understand why Binoche was in supporting category, despite having the same amount of screentime as Kristin Scott Thomas (sorry, I meant to say DAME Kristin Scott Thomas). I thought the Italian scenes were the most interesting part of the film but it was still obvious that the whole story was built around that dull Fieness-Thomas romance, so Binoche's character did feel somehow secondary to me, at least as far the film structure is concerned. It would be a much better film if they trimmed down the African scenes and focused more on Binoche's character.\n\nEven many film critics noted how hilariously awful that shot of revamed Babs was:\n\n[quote] The points of Streisand’s story, however — that beauty comes from within, that everyone deserves love, that even insecure people can be big stars — are lost. In a scene designed to unveil the revamped Rose, Streisand the director has the camera pan down Streisand the actress, pausing to admire the woman’s Elvira-like cleavage and fine ankles. It’s a moment almost giggle-worthy in its self-conscious conceit, and therefore, ironically, a shot of the star at her most vulnerable. It’s a Barbra-rific moment, one that is sure to be reenacted in cabaret acts for years to come. It’s Barbra in the mirror, and all we can do is gape\n\nShe was advised against it by her vocal coach (Judy Davis??), R43.\n\nBesides, it would have to have been in place before her star began to rise-and what the hell, maybe she's really quite comfortable with it. Work with what ya' got, I always say. Sometimes Babs worked her stuff pretty well..\"What's Up, Doc?\" comes to mind.\n\nBesides, too many Jewish girls in my old school went for the coming-of-age nose job and picked something far too perky. Michele Lee comes to mind.\n\nWhy can't ugly women accept they're ugly ? There are other values. In the olden days, not everyone thought they were pretty. Even movie stars. Katharine Hepburn knew she was a dog, she developped her acting skills. Davis didn't aspire to beauty. She even said of her arch enemy, Crawford, 'I wish I were half that beautiful, but....( something horribly derogatory) '. I remember my grand mother, who was a very plain, very sweet lady, talking about her exact contemporary, Vivien Leigh. She had the sort of reverence, admiration, that clearly showed no envy. ( of course in this case it was also the achievements, but she could aknowledge Leigh's beauty as superior). Since when every woman demands to be regarded as beautiful and sexy ?\n\nThe missed opportunity of her fighting with L.C and killing The Normal Heart was timing and the size of the audience receiving it's message. A larger and more mainstream audience would have seen the Streisand film.\n\nLarry and Barbra are both neurotic cunts but both are talented. Pettiness and ego could have been put aside .\n\nAnd let's face it, the t.v. mess that was finally produced was awful and 10 years too late. Prince of Tides isn't a bad film. She could have done at least that well with it.\n\nPeople who don't get Streisand, we know. People didn't get Picasso, Wagner and Sarah Bernhardt either. But their immense talents are undeniable to many.\n\nShe is a genius, and one of the very few of the modern era. She has been able to carve out careers in acting, singing, directing and even interior design to great success. She has been awarded just about every prize there is out there, save for the Nobel.\n\nHer Yentl is a masterpiece. To watch it in a theater full of people is akin to listening to Garland at Carnegie Hall. The rawness of pure emotion projected onto the silver screen in a way very few have ever mastered to do. The only time people have ever given standing ovations after musical numbers IN A MOVIE THEATER. Steven Spielberg compared it to Citizen Kane. That's how good she can get, folks.\n\nThat's talent. Her first ten years is a body of work that will be studied by professionals entering the business fifty years from now. To inspire and to teach.\n\nThere's nothing else to say.\n\nShe’s too much of a control freak and her ego directed “Mirror”, not her. She called up Steve Cook because she didn’t like how Siri pronounced her name. Can you imagine working with a director where every set decision required director approval? She should have known better than to direct and star in that film given the premise. It showcased in so many ways how self unaware and detached from reality she is.\n\nI think Bacall is rather good in the film and it's probably one of her better performances. I think the main reason she lost was that she was known for being super cunty.\n\nStreisand is a far better director than she is an actress. I remember hearing her say how she started by wanting to play all the great, classical roles. I couldn't help but laugh. She's honestly never been that great of a dramatic actress because she's so scared to let go and be seen in an unflattering light. She has a great flair for comedy, but even there she has the same problem that she has in dramas - she wants to always look her best.\n\nThis is why I could never imagine her playing Rose in GYPSY even when she was younger and age appropriate for the role. She's too afraid to let go and really play a monster.\n\nWas English Patient the first of the Weinstein fixes? It was such a lousy movie.\n\nBacall's unpopularity made her vulnerable to a loss. Enter Weinstein, who props up Binoche.\n\nVotes tabulated, and a surprise winner.\n\nA win for Hershey or the non nominated Courtney Love would have made more sense.\n\nNUTS was to go first to Winger and then to Cher, either of which would have been superb in the part. Barbra snatched it up and was entirely ill-suited to it. It was a waste and one of the very few films she did in that period. Such a shame that she hardly worked and when she did, made bad choices.\n\nStreisand is a great singer. Perhaps the best pop singer ever. Her voice is extraordinary. I 've only ever seen her in 'the way we were'. 'prince of tides' and ' the mirror has two faces '. She should have refrained after the Redford chick flick. Her films are an embarrassment to womanhood. She is notable as a director only in the sense that she's female. A genius ? ROTFLMAO. Please. But superiorly gifted as a singer. Unfortunately her legacy is evil. The 'screaming diva' is a calamity that was born with her. Sad\n\nFor those busting Barbara, she was a face on film that actually had expression. Pretty enough to do but more important than that, full of expression, funny and moving. People don't want performers onscreen, anymore. They want carved statues.\n\nThe point of her character in TMHTF was that he loved her, anyway. Gussying up the exterior was supposed to be something personally for him. That was why it was very attractive. It was a story, with character development, even if the delivery had its cheesy moments.\n\n[quote]The point of her character in TMHTF was that he loved her, anyway. Gussying up the exterior was supposed to be something personally for him. That was why it was very attractive. It was a story, with character development, even if the delivery had its cheesy moments.\n\nYou've got to stop defending this movie. It was awful, pure and simple.\n\nI remember a really odd TV commercial for the Broadway production of Nuts from when I was a kid.\n\nShe'd stand there saying stuff about the moon and looking all deranged and unhinged. It only ran a few months I think. Funny that it even got a film made of it considering it wasn't much of a hit.\n\nR177 Darlin', Babs is worth the trouble. Take her word for it. If you want the best...DO you want the best, R177? Babs is talking about taking your body to heaven and sending your mind south. She's talking about spoiling you so bad you will hate every other woman you touch. She's talking about her mouth on your mouth, and her tobgue anywhere you want it. She's talking about indulging your every fantasy, and then giving you those fantasies, one by one. Just for you. All for you. Nobody but you. You get all that, darlin'? Would you like that, baby? Do you get what she's telling you? [quote]Do you all GET what she's tellin' you??\n\nR175 - the play's move from off-Broadway to Broadway was financed by Universal Pictures who also bought the film rights. The season lasted 96 performances on Broadway. I think Winger was first attached with director Mark Rydell at Universal. They could never get a script everybody was happy with, and the project moved to Warner Bros who wanted Streisand instead and apparently lowered the price offered to Winger to force her to withdraw. I have never heard that Cher was approached. Rydell withdrew because he clashed with Streisand but then it was said that she had a rocky relationship with Martin Ritt too, who reportedly thought she was not right for the part. But since she also became the film's producer, he was a hired-hand only and she had final cut.\n\nThe year before Nuts was filmed Babs still had the frizzy fro from the 70s, and her look was really very garish. This was her big transformation. She became quite subtle and it's basically the look she kept. Donna Karen (lots of creams and tans), linebacker fitted shoulders and the flattering new hair-do. This was the new Babs.\n\nThis movie angered Larry Kramer because he thought Barbra was going to do \"The Normal Heart\" and then she did this movie. He made some comment along the lines of \"A character who gets plastic surgery is more interesting to Ms. Streisand than one who is trying to solve the AIDS crisis.\" He unleashed his full pissed off gay fury on her. And it caused a rip in the gay time/space continuum because gays didn't know which icon to side with.\n\nThe problem for me was that Barbra never allowed herself to appear unattractive at the beginning of the film. At most she was dumpy looking with a frau hairdo, no makeup, sweats, and a steady diet of junk food and baseball games.\n\nThe only “transformation” was glamming her into the Streisand we’ve all seen for years. The change was a vast improvement, but the movie acted like she had become some goddess that only they could see.\n\nBabs should have either let some else play the part or someone else direct, neither of which she would have tolerated. Creatively she’s her own worst enemy because she never lets go of being Streisand.\n\nThat said, for all its flaws, I still like the movie, if you’ve ever struggled with feeling unattractive-or “less than” because of it, there are parts of the film that resonate with you. The scene is the kitchen with Rose and her mother is very powerful.\n\n[quote]The problem for me was that Barbra never allowed herself to appear unattractive at the beginning of the film.\n\nShe did the same thing in Yentl. She refused to cut her hair to look like a boy. She wore a Joey Heatherton wig and a quart of foundation and eye make-up.\n\nR205 She can walk, but just barely. Remember this video where she went to visit her old dressing room on Broadway? She's moving around like a little old Jewish grandmother here, with very slow movements. It was obvious Gypsy was dead years ago. And I think the same can be said for that Catherine the Great movie she was gonna direct."
