        "text": "Barbra Streisand is back with her first new song in six years, releasing “Love Will Survive” for Peacock’s The Tattooist of Auschwitz Thursday (April 25).\n\nThe emotional track finds the eight-time Grammy winner adding her famous vibrato to poetic lyrics penned by Charlie Midnight, crooning over cinematic piano and strings. “Until I’m near you, somehow I’ll hear you,” she sings. “Your voice will echo inside me forever.”\n\n“Love Will Survive” marks Streisand’s first proper release since 2018’s Walls, which debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200. Since then, she’s also dropped a handful of compilation, anniversary edition and live albums, including Evergreens and Release Me 2.\n\n“Because of the rise in antisemitism around the world today,” Streisand said in a statement, “I wanted to sing ‘Love Will Survive’ in the context of this series as a way of remembering the six-million souls who were lost less than 80 years ago. And also to say that even in the darkest of times, the power of love can triumph and endure.”\n\nStreisand’s first-ever recording for a TV series, “Love Will Survive” serves as the end title for The Tattooist of Auschwitz, which premieres on Peacock May 2. The ballad was composed by Hans Zimmer, Kara Talve and Walter Afanasieff.\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz tells the story of a Slovakian Jewish man named Lali, played by Jonah Hauer-King. After being deported to the deadly concentration camp Auschwitz, he’s forced to tattoo identification numbers on incoming prisoners’ arms.\n\nListen to Barbra’s new single below."
