Again the hackstuph is brutal, but I like the charachters, and the music, and fashions etc. Not that i wear those clothes and listen to the music all the time or anything.\n\nAnti-trust is a really good, open source, geeky movie.\n\nThe Core has hacking references (\"He wants me to hack the planet?!?\")\n\nThe extended version of Independence day has some brief hacking references.\n\nThe Italian Job(the new version) has some minor Hacking references.\n\nWargames(Duh!)\n\nI hated Take-down, as kevin Mitnick was portrayed very badly in it, but its worth a look.\n\nSneakers is cool,\n\nNot a movie but a documentary, which you should have in your collection is Freedom Downtime.\n\nThats all I can think of for now.\n\nI love hackers.

I like the idea that hackers, like in \"hackers\" itself, they are characterised, as strong, attractive, physically co-ordinated individuals, with dress sense, and a sense of themselves.\n\nIts a mirror image of most of the hackers I know. Who arent really any of the above. Me included.\n\nIf you don't belive in a black and neon green colour scheme you should see my PC! and yes the text does go at ridiculous speeds too.:D\n\nHackers was a great film. I liked gone in 60 seconds too after seeing it I wanted to go out and steal cars. But the Matrix is the best all though totally abstract it could be real because of the concpets involved.\n\nIf it does exist I am morpheus If not I am the Architect currently building the matrix :p\n\nthe movie that was \"based\" (… sortaish) on kevin mitnick is called operation takedown… yah just saying\n\nother than that a really good hacker movie is Freedom Downtime. Its a documentary about the \"Free Kevin\" Movement (if you can call it that) that was going on, its made by the guys over at 2600 magazine.\n\n– Edit : syklops already mentioned freedom downtime, didnt see it sorry.\n\nI love the film hackers :) It realy is one of my favourite films of all times and yes i am a romantic :D But i just like the ideals in it of looking after youre friends and getting one back at authority…. But really am I the only one who wishes they had friends into this type of thing?\n\ncubeman372 wrote: If you don't belive in a black and neon green colour scheme you should see my PC! and yes the text does go at ridiculous speeds too.:D\n\nHackers was a great film.

The Shell and Command Prompt are the two greatest inventions in the computer world. I myself do prefer the Black text on an Amber background (easier on the eyes) but hey that is just me right?\n\nWindows GUI has made so many people dependant on a Graphical User Interface that they do not ever touch a Shell screen. It saddens me!"
