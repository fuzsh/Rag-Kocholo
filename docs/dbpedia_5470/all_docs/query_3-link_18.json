        "text": "mobucks said:\n\nI'll take a good book about war over a war docu. I watch one WWII docu on TV. I watch another. I notice half the footage used in film B was also in film A. I pick up book.\n\ni notice the same thing, but this makes me even more curious where the raw footage reel is from.\n\neveryone saw these snippets in ww2 docus, a snippet of people running across the street, a snippet of a smoke collumn rising, a snippet of some brave soldiers shooting intoa random direction (just as likely, they are posing, shooting at nothing)\n\ni am often wishing i could watch the entire roll of film. most of it would probably be quite dull, just like many a raw reel from modern conflicts often are. raw footage of libya for example, mostly showing dusty streets, some dude sitting w his rifle, and nothing more for hours.\n\nbut in itself, such footage would be the detailed-most representation of visual media\n\nimages can be very documenting, like vuk says, because they offer a whole new perspective on an issue.\n\nthat was my point with bringing up the article that \"pwns\" the book, each medium has its purpose.\n\nGoing to avoid the subject of Moore like the plague, but here's my personal picks and suggestions:\n\nAnything by Louis Theroux although I find it hard watching sometimes because I can get so riled up by the people he interviews. I think the one on fundamentalist Christians had me gnawing on my couch and frothing at the mouth.\n\nThe Cove. I can't vouch for its authenticity or truthfulness, but it was certainly an eye opener on the way dolphins are mercilessly butchered in Japan and the health risks of eating dolphin meat (which they do). I'm no animal rights activist, but it was pretty heavy stuff.\n\nThere's a series of documentaries on TV over here about drugs but I can't remember what they're called. Inside <nameofdrug> or something, maybe? They're interesting.\n\nDocumentaries about the making of my favourite movies and series. The one for Jurassic Park is an old favourite.\n\nBiographical documentaries about musicians and interesting people in general.\n\nOutlaw Comic: The Censoring of Bill Hicks because I'm me and no post of mine would be complete without a bit of Goatboy.\n\nWry said:\n\nAnything by Louis Theroux although I find it hard watching sometimes because I can get so riled up by the people he interviews. I think the one on fundamentalist Christians had me gnawing on my couch and frothing at the mouth.\n\nlouis theroux is usually quite good, but he pissed me off when visiting south african hunting safaris.\n\nas a \"neutral observer\" he should have either - not asked to participate in the hunt - or actually made the damn shot once he was involved -\n\nor the very very least not included that whole spectacle of \"oh gawd i cannot hurt an animal like some insensitive barbarian!\" into the finished documentary.\n\nhe ended up totally guilttripping his subjects, and alienating them as \"the bad guys\", and obviously, they noticed it and the whole docu took a sour turn. it really annoyed me\n\nWry said:\n\nThe Cove. I can't vouch for its authenticity or truthfulness, but it was certainly an eye opener on the way dolphins are mercilessly butchered in Japan and the health risks of eating dolphin meat (which they do). I'm no animal rights activist, but it was pretty heavy stuff.\n\nIt's a rather distressing watch this one. And when you find out that they only butcher the dolphins because the government thinks it will help keep their fish stocks up, well it makes you sick to the stomach."
