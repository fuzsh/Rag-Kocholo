        "text": "Geeking out and complaining about inaccuracies is fun. But it is like junk food. Too much is bad for your health. We’ve done the Top 10 worst portrayals of hacking in movies/TV as well as a Part 2 due to high demand. Now it is time for the good stuff. Take it in and feel those healthy positive portrayals revitalizing your brain.\n\nHere are the Top 10 best portrayals of hacking, based off your comments and feedback. Be sure to let us know what we missed, because there are probably some good ones that got left out.\n\n10 Real Genius — Ice coin trick.\n\nDry ice in the shape of a coin. Seems feasible with the vending machines shown. It is smart and funny. However, I haven’t ever actually seen real proof that this works, so maybe I’m mistaken in including it.\n\n09 NMAP in movies.\n\nDear movie making people. It takes 5 seconds to as the nearest IT guy “name some tools people use for security”. Then take a few screenshots of those tools. Not only did you save money on graphic designers, your movie suddenly just gained some added credibility.\n\n08 Social Network.\n\nEverything looks fairly legit, if possibly in Fast Forward.\n\n07 Bourne Ultimatum\n\nSomeone did some homework! We see postfix, SSH, NMAP a BASH shell. I believe there’s a scene where he changes the MAC address of a router too, but I can’t find it.\n\n06 Real Genius — [Laslo] games the game\n\nOften dismissed as an overly hokey ending, [Laslo] arrives at the end of the movie with a trailer full of winnings from a sweepstakes. It is a bit hokey, but it is also based off of true events at CalTech. Some students at CalTech in 1975 noticed there was the following line in a sweepstakes being held by McDonald’s “Enter as often as you wish.”. And that they did, 1.2 MILLION times. Ultimately winning $10,000 worth of prizes including a car.\n\n05 Wargames — paperclip payphone\n\nYeah, remember payphones? Well many of you probably remember actually doing this exact thing. Causing a bridge between the speaker housing and the coins lot would result in a free phone call.\n\n04 Flight of the Phoenix\n\nThe movie release was pretty cheezy. However, the core story is true. A plane crashed, and from the rubble a new plane arose.\n\n03 Sneakers.\n\ngreat examples of social engineering. Nothing is more effective than pizza and balloons.\n\n02 Wargames\n\nWar-dialing exists.Though it existed well before the movie, the name was quickly adopted."
