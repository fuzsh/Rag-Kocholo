        "text": "Story\n\nSteve Connolly was born into a family of vaudevillians, leftists and writers. He lived fast and loose with a ‘stick it to the man’ vibe. His schooling at Brinsley Road Free School encouraged the pupils “not to colour in, but to colour out.’ If there is such a thing as an artistic gene, Steve inherited it. An ideas man from an early age. Focus and determination got him a long way. But eventually he needed to produce material that sold. Compromise proves difficult when you have an incorrigible belief in your own vision.\n\nThis is not a straight telling of Steve’s life, fascinating though it was. The film is shot through with observations from industry professionals, venue owners, and front barrier fans who discuss that 80s/early 90s pub rock scene which spawned many successful acts but which lost many more to pressure, stress and substances. In the age before the internet, social media and mobile phones, the only way to publicise your music was via the traditional, locked up avenues of TV, radio and newspapers. This live scene was a shot in the arm for independent bands and Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls/ Messengers were amongst the best. A tight knit unit comprised of drummer Michael Barclay, bassist Jon Schofield and keyboardist Peter Bull they rode a wave of success for 7 years and 5 albums. Then it ended suddenly.\n\nPicking himself up after The Messengers folded Steve expanded his skills with the celtic folk rock of The Troubles and recorded a demo with Steve Lucas (of X). Never one to stand still Steve turned his hand to producing. Taking the reins for albums for Kaarin Fairfax and Kev Carmody’s before co-producing Archie Roach’s ‘Charcoal Lane’ and producing Sherry Rich and The Grievous Angels. But by 1994 Steve’s long neglected health began failing. He had started up his own band, The Usual Suspects and had recorded tracks for a solo album that would relaunch his career. Though the instruments were recorded, Steve had only laid down his guide vocals before falling seriously ill. An infection and cardiac issues combined and after a short stay in hospital he passed away from a bacterial infection of the heart. His last album was posthumously released.\n\nSteve’s musicality shines consistently however His self-taught guitar style snakes around the melody, embellishing delicately and his use of harmonic’s and feedback serve the emotion of the song. Once heard, never forgotten. Steve wasn’t a showy guitarist. His talent lay in his hands and he complimented the musicians around him. For his era, one of Australia’s best guitarists. And yet he’s in danger of being written out of history. A paving stone lies at Windy Hill in his honour (original home ground of the Essendon Bombers). He will always be remembered for the low sound that lingers. As the the lyric from ‘Too Her Door’ goes – ‘and his heart was singing like a low down guitar.’ This film is a celebration of Steve’s life and musical work and a critique of that period he thrived in.\n\nThank you to those who have agreed to be interviewed."
