Foreword We humans are born with an inner drive to explore the nature of our surroundings. As young men, both Kevin Mitnick and I were intensely curious about the world and eager to prove ourselves. We were rewarded often in our attempts to learn new things, solve puzzles, and win at games. But at the same time, the world around us taught us rules of behavior that constrained our inner urge toward free exploration. For our boldest scientists and technological entrepreneurs, as well as for people like Kevin Mitnick, following this inner urge offers the greatest thrills, letting us accomplish things that others believe cannot be done. Kevin Mitnick is one of the finest people I know. Ask him, and he will say forthrightly that what he used to do - social engineering – involes conning people. But Kevin is no longer a social engineer. And even when he was, his motive never was to enrich himself or damage others. That's not to say that there aren't dangerous and destructive criminals out there who use social engineering to cause real harm. In fact, that's exactly why Kevin wrote this book - to warn you about them. The Art of Deception shows how vulnerable we all are - government, business, and each of us personally - to the intrusions of the social engineer. In this security-conscious era, we spend huge sums on technology to protect our computer networks and data. This book points out how easy it is to trick insiders and circumvent all this technological protection. Whether you work in business or government, this book provides a powerful road map to help you understand how social engineers work and what you can do to foil them. Using fictionalized stories that are both entertaining and eye-opening, Kevin and co-author Bill Simon bring to life the techniques of the social engineering underworld. After each story, they offer practical guidelines to help you guard against the breaches and threats they're described. Technological security leaves major gaps that people like Kevin can help us close. Read this book and you may finally realize that we all need to turn to the Mitnick's among us for guidance. Steve Wozniak\n\n5. Preface Some hackers destroy people's files or entire hard drives; they're called crackers or vandals. Some novice hackers don't bother learning the technology, but simply download hacker tools to break into computer systems; they're called script kiddies. More experienced hackers with programming skills develop hacker programs and post them to the Web and to bulletin board systems. And then there are individuals who have no interest in the technology, but use the computer merely as a tool to aid them in stealing money, goods, or services. Despite the media-created myth of Kevin Mitnick, I am not a malicious hacker. But I'm getting ahead of myself. STARTING OUT My path was probably set early in life. I was a happy-go-lucky kid, but bored. After my father split when I was three, my mother worked as a waitress to support us. To see me then - an only child being raised by a mother who put in long, harried days on a sometimes-erratic schedule - would have been to see a youngster on his own almost all his waking hours. I was my own babysitter. Growing up in a San Fernando Valley community gave me the whole of Los Angeles to explore, and by the age of twelve I had discovered a way to travel free throughout the whole greater L.A. area. I realized one day while riding the bus that the security of the bus transfer I had purchased relied on the unusual pattern of the paper-punch, that the drivers used to mark day; time, and route on the transfer slips. A friendly driver, answering my carefully planted question, told me where to buy that special type of punch. The transfers are meant to let you change buses and continue a journey to your destination, but I worked out how to use them to travel anywhere I wanted to go for free. Obtaining blank transfers was a walk in the park. The trash bins at the bus terminals were always filled with only-partly used books of transfers that the drivers tossed away at the end of the shifts. With a pad of blanks and the punch, I could mark my own transfers and travel anywhere that L.A. buses went. Before long, I had all but memorized the bus schedules of the entire system. (This was an early example of my surprising memory for certain types of information; I can still, today, remember phone numbers, passwords, and other seemingly trivial details as far back as my childhood.) Another personal interest that surfaced at an early age was my fascination with performing magic. Once I learned how a new trick worked, would practice,\n\n6. practice, and practice some more until I mastered it. To an extent, it was through magic that I discovered the enjoyment in gaining secret knowledge. From Phone Phreak to Hacker My first encounter with what I would eventually learn to call social engineering came about during my high school years when I met another student who was caught up in a hobby called phone phreakin. Phone phreaking is a type of hacking that allows you to explore the telephone network by exploiting the phone systems and phone company employees. He showed me neat tricks he could do with a telephone, like obtaining any information the phone company had on any customer, and using a secret test number to make long-distance calls for free. (Actually it was free only to us. I found out much later that it wasn't a secret test number at all. The calls were, in fact, being billed to some poor company's MCI account.) That was my introduction to social engineering-my kindergarten, so to speak. My friend and another phone phreaker I met shortly thereafter let me listen in as they each made pretext calls to the phone company. I heard the things they said that made them sound believable; I learned about different phone company offices, lingo, and procedures. But that \"training\" didn't last long; it didn't have to. Soon I was doing it all on my own, learning as I went, doing it even better than my first teachers. The course my life would follow for the next fifteen years had been set. In high school, one of my all-time favorite pranks was gaining unauthorized access to the telephone switch and changing the class of service of a fellow phone phreak. When he'd attempt to make a call from home, he'd get a message telling him to deposit a dime because the telephone company switch had received input that indicated he was calling from a pay phone. I became absorbed in everything about telephones, not only the electronics, switches, and computers, but also the corporate organization, the procedures, and the terminology. After a while, I probably knew more about the phone system than any single employee. And I had developed my social engineering skills to the point that, at seventeen years old, I was able to talk most telco employees into almost anything, whether I was speaking with them in person or by telephone. My much-publicized hacking career actually started when I was in high school. While I cannot describe the detail here, suffice it to say that one of the driving forces in my early hacks was to be accepted by the guys in the hacker group. Back then we used the term hacker to mean a person who spent a great deal of time tinkering with hardware and software, either to develop more efficient programs or to bypass unnecessary steps and get the job done more quickly. The\n\n7. term has now become a pejorative, carrying the meaning of \"malicious criminal.\" In these pages I use the term the way I have always used it - in its earlier, more benign sense. After high school I studied computers at the Computer Learning Center in Los Angeles. Within a few months, the school's computer manager realized I had found vulnerability in the operating system and gained full administrative privileges on their IBM minicomputer. The best computer experts on their teaching staff couldn't figure out how I had done this. In what may have been one of the earliest examples of \"hire the hacker,\" I was given an offer I couldn't refuse: Do an honors project to enhance the school's computer security, or face suspension for hacking the system. Of course, I chose to do the honors project, and ended up graduating cum laude with honors. Becoming a Social Engineer Some people get out of bed each morning dreading their daily work routine at the proverbial salt mines. I've been lucky enough to enjoy my work. n particular, you can't imagine the challenge, reward, and pleasure I had the time I spent as a private investigator. I was honing my talents in the performance art called social engineering (getting people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily do for a stranger) and being paid for it. For me it wasn't difficult becoming proficient in social engineering. My father's side of the family had been in the sales field for generations, so the art of influence and persuasion might have been an inherited trait. When you combine that trait with an inclination for deceiving people, you have the profile of a typical social engineer. You might say there are two specialties within the job classification of con artist. Somebody who swindles and cheats people out of their money belongs to one sub-specialty, the grifter. Somebody who uses deception, influence, and persuasion against businesses, usually targeting their information, belongs to the other sub-specialty, the social engineer. From the time of my bus-transfer trick, when I was too young to know there was anything wrong with what I was doing, I had begun to recognize a talent for finding out the secrets I wasn't supposed to have. I built on that talent by using deception, knowing the lingo, and developing a well-honed skill of manipulation. One way I worked on developing the skills of my craft, if I may call it a craft, was to pick out some piece of information I didn't really care about and see if I could talk somebody on the other end of the phone into providing it, just to improve my skills. In the same way I used to practice my magic tricks, I practiced\n\n8. pretexting. Through these rehearsals, I soon found that I could acquire virtually any information I targeted. As I described in Congressional testimony before Senators Lieberman and Thompson years later: I have gained unauthorized access to computer systems at some of the largest corporations on the planet, and have successfully penetrated some of the most resilient computer systems ever developed. I have used both technical and non- technical means to obtain the source code to various operating systems and telecommunications devices to study their vulnerabilities and their inner workings. All of this activity was really to satisfy my own curiosity; to see what I could do; and find out secret information about operating systems, cell phones, and anything else that stirred my curiosity. FINAL THOUGHTS I've acknowledged since my arrest that the actions I took were illegal, and that I committed invasions of privacy. My misdeeds were motivated by curiosity. I wanted to know as much as I could about how phone networks worked and the ins-and-outs of computer security. I went from being a kid who loved to perform magic tricks to becoming the world's most notorious hacker, feared by corporations and the government. As I reflect back on my life for the last 30 years, I admit I made some extremely poor decisions, driven by my curiosity, the desire to learn about technology, and the need for a good intellectual challenge. I'm a changed person now. I'm turning my talents and the extensive knowledge I've gathered about information security and social engineering tactics to helping government, businesses, and individuals prevent, detect, and respond to information-security threats. This book is one more way that I can use my experience to help others avoid the efforts of the malicious information thieves of the world. I think you will find the stories enjoyable, eye-opening, and educational.\n\n9. Introduction This book contains a wealth of information about information security and social engineering. To help you find your way, here's a quick look at how this book is organized: In Part 1 I'll reveal security's weakest link and show you why you and your company are at risk from social engineering attacks. In Part 2 you'll see how social engineers toy with your trust, your desire to be helpful, your sympathy, and your human gullibility to get what they want. Fictional stories of typical attacks will demonstrate that social engineers can wear many hats and many faces. If you think you've never encountered one, you're probably wrong. Will you recognize a scenario you've experienced in these stories and wonder if you had a brush with social engineering? You very well might. But once you've read Chapters 2 through 9, you'll know how to get the upper hand when the next social engineer comes calling. Part 3 is the part of the book where you see how the social engineer ups the ante, in made-up stories that show how he can step onto your corporate premises, steal the kind of secret that can make or break your company, and thwart your hi-tech security measures. The scenarios in this section will make you aware of threats that range from simple employee revenge to cyber terrorism. If you value the information that keeps your business running and the privacy of your data, you'll want to read Chapters 10 through 14 from beginning to end. It's important to note that unless otherwise stated, the anecdotes in this book are purely fictional. In Part 4 I talk the corporate talk about how to prevent successful social engineering attacks on your organization. Chapter 15 provides a blueprint for a successful security-training program. And Chapter 16 might just save your neck - it's a complete security policy you can customize for your organization and implement right away to keep your company and information safe. Finally, I've provided a Security at a Glance section, which includes checklists, tables, and charts that summarize key information you can use to help your employees foil a social engineering attack on the job. These tools also provide valuable information you can use in devising your own security-training program. Throughout the book you'll also find several useful elements: Lingo boxes provide definitions of social engineering and computer hacker terminology; Mitnick Messages offer brief words of wisdom to help strengthen your security\n\n10. strategy; and notes and sidebars give interesting background or additional information.\n\n11. Part 1 Behind The Scenes\n\n12. Chapter 1 Security’s Weakest Link A company may have purchased the best security technologies that money can buy, trained their people so well that they lock up all their secrets before going home at night, and hired building guards from the best security firm in the business. That company is still totally Vulnerable. Individuals may follow every best-security practice recommended by the experts, slavishly install every recommended security product, and be thoroughly vigilant about proper system configuration and applying security patches. Those individuals are still completely vulnerable. THE HUMAN FACTOR Testifying before Congress not long ago, I explained that I could often get passwords and other pieces of sensitive information from companies by pretending to be someone else and just asking for it. It's natural to yearn for a feeling of absolute safety, leading many people to settle for a false sense of security. Consider the responsible and loving homeowner who has a Medico, a tumbler lock known as being pickproof, installed in his front door to protect his wife, his children, and his home. He's now comfortable that he has made his family much safer against intruders. But what about the intruder- who breaks a window, or cracks the code to the garage door opener? How about installing a robust security system? Better, but still no guarantee. Expensive locks or no, the homeowner remains vulnerable. Why? Because the human factor is truly security's weakest link. Security is too often merely an illusion, an illusion sometimes made even worse when gullibility, naivete, or ignorance come into play. The world's most respected scientist of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein, is quoted as saying, \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.\" In the end, social engineering attacks can succeed when people are stupid or, more commonly, simply ignorant about good security practices. With the same attitude as our security-conscious homeowner, many information technology (IT) professionals hold to the misconception that they've made their companies largely immune to attack because they've deployed standard security products - firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or stronger authentication\n\n13. devices such as time-based tokens or biometric smart cards. Anyone who thinks that security products alone offer true security is settling for. the illusion of security. It's a case of living in a world of fantasy: They will inevitably, later if not sooner, suffer a security incident. As noted security consultant Bruce Schneier puts it, \"Security is not a product, it's a process.\" Moreover, security is not a technology problem - it's a people and management problem. As developers invent continually better security technologies, making it increasingly difficult to exploit technical vulnerabilities, attackers will turn more and more to exploiting the human element. Cracking the human firewall is often easy, requires no investment beyond the cost of a phone call, and involves minimal risk. A CLASSIC CASE OF DECEPTION What's the greatest threat to the security of your business assets? That's easy: the social engineer--an unscrupulous magician who has you watching his left hand while with his right he steals your secrets. This character is often so friendly, glib, and obliging that you're grateful for having encountered him. Take a look at an example of social engineering. Not many people today still remember the young man named Stanley Mark Rifkin and his little adventure with the now defunct Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. Accounts of his escapade vary, and Rifkin (like me) has never told his own story, so the following is based on published reports. Code Breaking One day in 1978, Rifkin moseyed over to Security Pacific's authorized-personnel- only wire-transfer room, where the staff sent and received transfers totaling several billion dollars every day. He was working for a company under contract to develop a backup system for the wire room's data in case their main computer ever went down. That role gave him access to the transfer procedures, including how bank officials arranged for a transfer to be sent. He had learned that bank officers who were authorized to order wire transfers would be given a closely guarded daily code each morning to use when calling the wire room. In the wire room the clerks saved themselves the trouble of trying to memorize each day's code: They wrote down the code on a slip of paper and posted it where\n\n14. they could see it easily. This particular November day Rifkin had a specific reason for his visit. He wanted to get a glance at that paper. Arriving in the wire room, he took some notes on operating procedures, supposedly to make sure the backup system would mesh properly with the regular systems. Meanwhile, he surreptitiously read the security code from the posted slip of paper, and memorized it. A few minutes later he walked out. As he said afterward, he felt as if he had just won the lottery. There's This Swiss Bank Account... Leaving the room at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he headed straight for the pay phone in the building's marble lobby, where he deposited a coin and dialed into the wire-transfer room. He then changed hats, transforming himself from Stanley Rifkin, bank consultant, into Mike Hansen, a member of the bank's International Department. According to one source, the conversation went something like this: \"Hi, this is Mike Hansen in International,\" he said to the young woman who answered the phone. She asked for the office number. That was standard procedure, and he was prepared: “286” he said. The girl then asked, \"Okay, what's the code?\" Rifkin has said that his adrenaline-powered heartbeat \"picked up its pace\" at this point. He responded smoothly, \"4789.\" Then he went on to give instructions for wiring \"Ten million, two-hundred thousand dollars exactly\" to the Irving Trust Company in New York, for credit of the Wozchod Handels Bank of Zurich, Switzerland, where he had already established an account. The girl then said, \"Okay, I got that. And now I need the interoffice settlement number.\" Rifkin broke out in a sweat; this was a question he hadn't anticipated, something that had slipped through the cracks in his research. But he managed to stay in character, acted as if everything was fine, and on the spot answered without missing a beat, \"Let me check; I'll call you right back.\" He changed hats once again to call another department at the bank, this time claiming to be an employee in the wire-transfer room. He obtained the settlement number and called the girl back. She took the number and said, \"Thanks.\" (Under the circumstances, her thanking him has to be considered highly ironic.)\n\n15. Achieving Closure A few days later Rifkin flew to Switzerland, picked up his cash, and handed over $8 million to a Russian agency for a pile of diamonds. He flew back, passing through U.S. Customs with the stones hidden in a money belt. He had pulled off the biggest bank heist in history--and done it without using a gun, even without a computer. Oddly, his caper eventually made it into the pages of the Guinness Book of World Records in the category of \"biggest computer fraud.\" Stanley Rifkin had used the art of deception--the skills and techniques that are today called social engineering. Thorough planning and a good gift of gab is all it really took. And that's what this book is about--the techniques of social engineering (at which yours truly is proficient) and how to defend against their being used at your company. THE NATURE OF THE THREAT The Rifkin story makes perfectly clear how misleading our sense of security can be. Incidents like this - okay, maybe not $10 million heists, but harmful incidents nonetheless - are happening every day. You may be losing money right now, or somebody may be stealing new product plans, and you don't even know it. If it hasn't already happened to your company, it's not a question of if it will happen, but when. A Growing Concern The Computer Security Institute, in its 2001 survey of computer crime, reported that 85 percent of responding organizations had detected computer security breaches in the preceding twelve months. That's an astounding number: Only fifteen out of every hundred organizations responding were able to say that they had not had a security breach during the year. Equally astounding was the number of organizations that reported that they had experienced financial losses due to computer breaches: 64 percent. Well over half the organizations had suffered financially. In a single year. My own experiences lead me to believe that the numbers in reports like this are somewhat inflated. I'm suspicious of the agenda of the people conducting the survey. But that's not to say that the damage isn't extensive; it is. Those who fail to plan for a security incident are planning for failure. Commercial security products deployed in most companies are mainly aimed at providing protection against the amateur computer intruder, like the youngsters known as script kiddies. In fact, these wannabe hackers with downloaded software are mostly just a nuisance. The greater losses, the real threats, come from sophisticated attackers with well-defined targets who are motivated by\n\n16. financial gain. These people focus on one target at a time rather than, like the amateurs, trying to infiltrate as many systems as possible. While amateur computer intruders simply go for quantity, the professionals target information of quality and value. Technologies like authentication devices (for proving identity), access control (for managing access to files and system resources), and intrusion detection systems (the electronic equivalent of burglar alarms) are necessary to a corporate security program. Yet it's typical today for a company to spend more money on coffee than on deploying countermeasures to protect the organization against security attacks. Just as the criminal mind cannot resist temptation, the hacker mind is driven to find ways around powerful security technology safeguards. And in many cases, they do that by targeting the people who use the technology. Deceptive Practices There's a popular saying that a secure computer is one that's turned off. Clever, but false: The pretexter simply talks someone into going into the office and turning that computer on. An adversary who wants your information can obtain it, usually in any one of several different ways. It's just a matter of time, patience, personality, and persistence. That's where the art of deception comes in. To defeat security measures, an attacker, intruder, or social engineer must find a way to deceive a trusted user into revealing information, or trick an unsuspecting mark into providing him with access. When trusted employees are deceived, influenced, or manipulated into revealing sensitive information, or performing actions that create a security hole for the attacker to slip through, no technology in the world can protect a business. Just as cryptanalysts are sometimes able to reveal the plain text of a coded message by finding a weakness that lets them bypass the encryption technology, social engineers use deception practiced on your employees to bypass security technology. ABUSE OF TRUST In most cases, successful social engineers have strong people skills. They're charming, polite, and easy to like--social traits needed for establishing rapid rapport and trust. An experienced social engineer is able to gain access to virtually any targeted information by using the strategies and tactics of his craft. Savvy technologists have painstakingly developed information-security solutions to minimize the risks connected with the use of computers, yet left unaddressed the most significant vulnerability, the human factor. Despite our intellect, we\n\n17. humans - you, me, and everyone else - remain the most severe threat to each other's security. Our National Character We're not mindful of the threat, especially in the Western world. In the United States most of all, we're not trained to be suspicious of each other. We are taught to \"love thy neighbor\" and have trust and faith in each other. Consider how difficult it is for neighborhood watch organizations to get people to lock their homes and cars. This sort of vulnerability is obvious, and yet it seems to be ignored by many who prefer to live in a dream world - until they get burned. We know that all people are not kind and honest, but too often we live as if they were. This lovely innocence has been the fabric of the lives of Americans and it's painful to give it up. As a nation we have built into our concept of freedom that the best places to live are those where locks and keys are the least necessary. Most people go on the assumption that they will not be deceived by others, based upon a belief that the probability of being deceived is very low; the attacker, understanding this common belief, makes his request sound so reasonable that it raises no suspicion, all the while exploiting the victim's trust. Organizational Innocence That innocence that is part of our national character was evident back when computers were first being connected remotely. Recall that the ARPANet (the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the predecessor of the Internet, was designed as a way of sharing research information between government, research, and educational institutions. The goal was information freedom, as well as technological advancement. Many educational institutions therefore set up early computer systems with little or no security. One noted software libertarian, Richard Stallman, even refused to protect his account with a password. But with the Internet being used for electronic commerce, the dangers of weak security in our wired world have changed dramatically. Deploying more technology is not going to solve the human security problem. Just look at our airports today. Security has become paramount, yet we're alarmed by media reports of travelers who have been able to circumvent security and carry potential weapons past checkpoints. How is this possible during a time when our airports are on such a state of alert? Are the metal detectors failing? No. The problem isn't the machines. The problem is the human factor: The people manning the machines. Airport officials can marshal the National Guard and\n\n18. install metal detectors and facial recognition systems, but educating the frontline security staff on how to properly screen passengers is much more likely to help. The same problem exists within government, business, and educational institutions throughout the world. Despite the efforts of security professionals, information everywhere remains vulnerable and will continue to be seen as a ripe target by attackers with social engineering skills, until the weakest link in the security chain, the human link, has been strengthened. Now more than ever we must learn to stop wishful thinking and become more aware of the techniques that are being used by those who attempt to attack the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer systems and networks. We've come to accept the need for defensive driving; it's time to accept and learn the practice of defensive computing. The threat of a break-in that violates your privacy, your mind, or your company's information systems may not seem real until it happens. To avoid such a costly dose of reality, we all need to become aware, educated, vigilant, and aggressively protective of our information assets, our own personal information, and our nation's critical infrastructures. And we must implement those precautions today. TERRORISTS AND DECEPTION Of course, deception isn't an exclusive tool of the social engineer. Physical terrorism makes the biggest news, and we have come to realize as never before that the world is a dangerous place. Civilization is, after all, just a thin veneer. The attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., in September 2001 infused sadness and fear into the hearts of every one of us - not just Americans, but well- meaning people of all nations. We're now alerted to the fact that there are obsessive terrorists located around the globe, well - trained and waiting to launch further attacks against us. The recently intensified effort by our government has increased the levels of our security consciousness. We need to stay alert, on guard against all forms of terrorism. We need to understand how terrorists treacherously create false identities, assume roles as students and neighbors, and melt into the crowd. They mask their true beliefs while they plot against us - practicing tricks of deception similar to those you will read about in these pages. And while, to the best of my knowledge, terrorists have not yet used social engineering ruses to infiltrate corporations, water-treatment plants, electrical generation facilities, or other vital components of our national infrastructure, the potential is there. It's just too easy. The security awareness and security policies\n\n19. that I hope will be put into place and enforced by corporate senior management because of this book will come none too soon. ABOUT THIS BOOK Corporate security is a question of balance. Too little security leaves your company vulnerable, but an overemphasis on security gets in the way of attending to business, inhibiting the company's growth and prosperity. The challenge is to achieve a balance between security and productivity. Other books on corporate security focus on hardware and software technology, and do not adequately cover the most serious threat of all: human deception. The purpose of this book, in contrast, is to help you understand how you, your co- workers, and others in your company are being manipulated, and the barriers you can erect to stop being victims. The book focuses mainly on the non-technical methods that hostile intruders use to steal information, compromise the integrity of information that is believed to be safe but isn't., or destroy company work product. My task is made more difficult by a simple truth: Every reader will have been manipulated by the grand experts of all time in social engineering - their parents. They found ways to get you - \"for your own good\" - to do what they thought best. Parents become great storytellers in the same way that social engineers skillfully develop very plausible stories, reasons, and justifications for achieving their goals. Yes, we were all molded by our parents: benevolent (and sometimes not so benevolent) social engineers. Conditioned by that training, we have become vulnerable to manipulation. We would live a difficult life if we had to be always on our guard, mistrustful of others, concerned that we might become the dupe of someone trying to take advantage of us. In a perfect world we would implicitly trust others, confident that the people we encounter are going to be honest and trustworthy. But we do not live in a perfect world, and so we have to exercise a standard of vigilance to repel the deceptive efforts of our adversaries. The main portions of this book, Parts 2 and 3, are made up of stories that show you social engineers in action. In these sections you'll read about: • What phone phreaks discovered years ago: A slick method for getting an unlisted phone number from the telephone company. • Several different methods used by attackers to convince even alert, suspicious employees to reveal their computer usernames and passwords. • How an Operations Center manager cooperated in allowing an attacker to steal his company's most secret product information.\n\n20. • The methods of an attacker who deceived a lady into downloading software that spies on every keystroke she makes and emails the details to him. • How private investigators get information about your company, and about you personally, that I can practically guarantee will send a chill up your spine. You might think as you read some of the stories in Parts 2 and 3 that they're not possible, that no one could really succeed in getting away with the lies, dirty tricks, and schemes de, scribed in these pages. The reality is that in every case, these stories depict events that can and do happen; many of them are happening every day somewhere on the planet, maybe even to your business as you read this book. The material in this book will be a real eye-opener when it comes to protecting your business, but also personally deflecting the advances of a social engineer to protect the integrity of information in your private life. In Part 4 of this book I switch gears. My goal here is to help you create the necessary business policies and awareness training to minimize the chances of your employees ever being duped by a social engineer. Understanding the strategies, methods, and tactics of the social engineer will help prepare you to deploy reasonable controls to safeguard your IT assets, without undermining your company's productivity. In short, I've written this book to raise your awareness about the serious threat posed by social engineering, and to help you make sure that your company and its employees are less likely to be exploited in this way. Or perhaps I should say, far less likely to be exploited ever again.\n\n21. Part 2 The Art Of The Attacker\n\n22. Chapter 2 When Innocuous Information Isn’t What do most people think is the real threat from social engineers? What should you do to be on your guard? If the goal is to capture some highly valuable prize--say, a vital component of the company's intellectual capital - then perhaps what's needed is, figuratively, just a stronger vault and more heavily armed guards. Right? But in reality penetrating a company's security often starts with the bad guy obtaining some piece of information or some document that seems so innocent, so everyday and unimportant, that most people in the organization wouldn't see any reason why the item should be protected and restricted HIDDEN VALUE OF INFORMATION Much of the seemingly innocuous information in a company's possession is prized by a social engineering attacker because it can play a vital role in his effort to dress himself in a cloak of believability. Throughout these pages, I'm going to show you how social engineers do what they do by letting you \"witness\" the attacks for yourself--sometimes presenting the action from the viewpoint of the people being victimized, allowing you to put yourself in their shoes and gauge how you yourself (or maybe one of your employees or co-workers) might have responded. In many cases you'll also experience the same events from the perspective of the social engineer. The first story looks at a vulnerability in the financial industry. CREDITCHEX For a long time, the British put up with a very stuffy banking system. As an ordinary, upstanding citizen, you couldn't walk in off the street and open a bank account. No, the bank wouldn't consider accepting you as a customer unless some person already well established as a customer provided you with a letter of recommendation. Quite a difference, of course, in the seemingly egalitarian banking world of today. And our modern ease of doing business is nowhere more in evidence than in friendly, democratic America, where almost anyone can walk into a bank and easily open a checking account, right? Well, not exactly. The truth is that banks understandably have a natural reluctance to open. an account for somebody who\n\n23. just might have a history of writing bad checks--that would be about as welcome as a rap sheet of bank robbery or embezzlement charges. So it's standard practice at many banks to get a quick thumbs-up or thumbs-down on a prospective new customer. One of the major companies that banks contract with for this information is an outfit we'll call CreditChex. They provide a valuable service to their clients, but like many companies, can also unknowingly provide a handy service to knowing social engineers. The First Call: Kim Andrews \"National Bank, this is Kim. Did you want to open an account today?\" \"Hi, Kim. I have a question for you. Do you guys use CreditChex?\" \"Yes.\" \"When you phone in to CreditChex, what do you call the number you give them-- is it a 'Merchant ID'?\" A pause; she was weighing the question, wondering what this was about and whether she should answer. The caller quickly continued without missing a beat: \"Because, Kim, I'm working on a book. It deals with private investigations.\" \"Yes,\" she said, answering the question with new confidence, pleased to be helping a writer. \"So it's called a Merchant ID, right?\" \"Uh huh.\" \"Okay, great. Because I wanted to male sure I had the lingo right. For the book. Thanks for your help. Good-bye, Kim.\" The Second Call: Chris Talbert \"National Bank, New Accounts, this is Chris.\" \"Hi, Chris. This is Alex,\" the caller said. \"I'm a customer service rep with CreditChex. We're doing a survey to improve our services. Can you spare me a couple of minutes?\" She was glad to, and the caller went on: \"Okay - what are the hours your branch is open for business?\" She answered, and continued answering his string of questions. \"How many employees at your branch use our service?\" \"How often do you call us with an inquiry?\"\n\n24. \"Which of our 800-numbers have we assigned you for calling us?\" \"Have our representatives always been courteous?\" \"How's our response time?\" \"How long have you been with the bank?\" \"What Merchant ID are you currently using?\" \"Have you ever found any inaccuracies with the information we've provided you?\" \"If you had any suggestions for improving our service, what would they be?\" And: \"Would you be willing to fill out periodic questionnaires if we send them to your branch?\" She agreed, they chatted a bit, the caller rang off, and Chris went back to work. The Third Call: Henry McKinsey \"CreditChex, this is Henry McKinsey, how can I help you?\" The caller said he was from National Bank. He gave the proper Merchant ID and then gave the name and social security number of the person he was looking for information on. Henry asked for the birth date, and the caller gave that, too. After a few moments, Henry read the listing from his computer screen. \"Wells Fargo reported NSF in 1998, one time, amount of $2,066.\" NSF – non sufficient funds - is the familiar banking lingo for checks that have been written when there isn't enough money in the account to cover them. \"Any activities since then?\" \"No activities.\" \"Have there been any other inquiries?\" \"Let's see. Okay, two of them, both last month. Third United Credit Union of Chicago.\" He stumbled over the next name, Schenectady Mutual Investments, and had to spell it. \"That's in New York State,\" he added. Private Investigator at Work All three of those calls were made by the same person: a private investigator we'll call Oscar Grace. Grace had a new client, one of his first. A cop until a few months before, he found that some of this new work came naturally, but some offered a challenge to his resources and inventiveness. This one came down firmly in the challenge category.\n\n25. The hardboiled private eyes of fiction - the Sam Spades and the Philip Marlowes - spend long night time hours sitting in cars waiting to catch a cheating spouse. Real-life PIs do the same. They also do a less written about, but no less important kind of snooping for warring spouses, a method that leans more heavily on social engineering skills than on fighting off the boredom of night time vigils. Grace's new client was a lady who looked as if she had a pretty comfortable budget for clothes and jewelry. She walked into his office one day and took a seat in the leather chair, the only one that didn't have papers piled on it. She settled her large Gucci handbag on his desk with the logo turned to face him and announced she was planning to tell her husband that she wanted a divorce, but admitted to \"just a very little problem.\" It seemed her hubby was one step ahead. He had already pulled the cash out of their savings account and an even larger sum from their brokerage account. She wanted to know where their assets had been squirreled away, and her divorce lawyer wasn't any help at all. Grace surmised the lawyer was one of those uptown, high-rise counselors who wouldn't get his hands dirty on something messy like where did the money go. Could Grace help? He assured her it would be a breeze, quoted a fee, expenses billed at cost, and collected a check for the first payment. Then he faced his problem. What do you do if you've never handled a piece of work like this before and don't quite know how to go about tracking down a money trail? You move forward by baby steps. Here, accord- mg to our source, is Grace's story. I knew about CreditChex and how banks used the outfit - my ex-wife used to work at a bank. But I didn't know the lingo and procedures, and trying to ask my ex- would be a waste of time. Step one: Get the terminology straight and figure out how to make the request so it sounds like I know what I'm talking about. At the bank I called, the first young lady, Kim, was suspicious when I asked about how they identify themselves when they phone CreditChex. She hesitated; she didn't know whether to tell me. Was I put off by that? Not a bit. In fact, the hesitation gave me an important clue, a sign that I had to supply a reason she'd find believable. When I worked the con on her about doing research for a book, it relieved her suspicions. You say you're an author or a movie writer, and everybody opens up.\n\n26. She had other knowledge that would have helped - things like what reformation CreditChex requires to identify the person you're calling about, what information you can ask for, and the big one, what was Kim's bank Merchant ID number. I was ready to ask those questions, but her hesitation sent up the red flag. She bought the book research story, but she already had a few niggling suspicions. If she'd been more willing right way, I would have asked her to reveal more details about their procedures. LINGO MARK: The victim of a con. BURN THE SOURCE: An attacker is said to have burned the source when he allows a victim to recognize that an attack has taken place. Once the victim becomes aware and notifies other employees or management of the attempt, it becomes extremely difficult to exploit the same source in future attacks. You have to go on gut instinct, listen closely to what the mark is saying and how she's saying it. This lady sounded smart enough for alarm bells to start going off if I asked too many unusual questions. And even though she didn't know who I was or what number I was calling from, still in this business you never want anybody putting out the word to be on the look out for someone calling to get information about the business. That’s because you don't want to burn the source - you may want to call same office back another time. I'm always on the watch for little signs that give me a read on how cooperative a person is, on a scale that runs from \"You sound like a nice person and I believe everything you're saying\" to \"Call the cops, alert the National Guard, this guy's up to no good.\" I read Kim as a little bit on edge, so I just called somebody at a different branch. On my second call with Chris, the survey trick played like a charm. The tactic here is to slip the important questions in among inconsequential ones that are used to create a sense of believability. Before I dropped the question about the Merchant ID number with CreditChex, I ran a little last-minute test by asking her a personal question about how long she'd been with the bank. A personal question is like a land mine - some people step right over it and never notice; for other people, it blows up and sends them scurrying for safety. So if I ask a personal question and she answers the question and the tone of her voice doesn't change, that means she probably isn't skeptical about the nature of the request. I can safely ask the sought after question without arousing her suspicions, and she'll probably give me the answer I'm looking for.\n\n27. One more thing a good PI knows: Never end the conversation after getting the key information. Another two or three questions, a little chat, and then it's okay to say good-bye. Later, if the victim remembers anything about what you asked, it will probably be the last couple of questions. The rest will usually be forgotten. So Chris gave me their Merchant ID number, and the phone number they call to make requests. I would have been happier if I had gotten to ask some questions about how much information you can get from CreditChex. But it was better not to push my luck. It was like having a blank check on CreditChex. I could now call and get information whenever I wanted. I didn't even have to pay for the service. As it turned out, the CreditChex rep was happy to share exactly the information I wanted: two places my client's husband had recently applied to open an account. So where were the assets his soon-to-be ex-wife was looking for? Where else but at the banking institutions the guy at CreditChex listed? Analyzing the Con This entire ruse was based on one of the fundamental tactics of social engineering: gaining access to information that a company employee treats as innocuous, when it isn't. The first bank clerk confirmed the terminology to describe the identifying number used when calling CreditChex: the Merchant ID. The second provided the phone number for calling CreditChex, and the most vital piece of information, the bank's Merchant ID number. All this information appeared to the clerk to be innocuous. After all, the bank clerk thought she was talking to someone from CreditChex -so what could be the harm in disclosing the number? All of this laid the groundwork for the third call. Grace had everything he needed to phone CreditChex, pass himself off as a rep from one of their customer banks, National, and simply ask for the information he was after. With as much skill at stealing information as a good swindler has at stealing your money, Grace had well-honed talents for reading people. He knew the common tactic of burying the key questions among innocent ones. He knew a personal question would test the second clerk's willingness to cooperate, before innocently asking for the Merchant ID number. The first clerk's error in confirming the terminology for the CreditChex ID number would be almost impossible to protect against. The information is so widely known within the banking industry that it appears to be unimportant - the very model of the innocuous. But the second clerk, Chris, should not have been\n\n28. so willing to answer questions without positively verifying that the caller was really who he claimed to be. She should, at the very least, have taken his name and number and called back; that way, if any questions arose later, she may have kept a record of what phone number the person had used. In this case, making a call like that would have made it much more difficult for the attacker to masquerade as a representative from CreditChex. MITNICK MESSAGE A Merchant ID in this situation is analogous to a password. If bank personnel treated it like an ATM PIN, they might appreciate the sensitive nature of the information. Is there an internal code or number in your organization that people aren't treating with enough care? Better still would have been a call to CreditChex using a nun bank already had on record - not a number provided by the caller – to verify that the person really worked there, and that the company was really doing a customer survey. Given the practicalities of the real world and the time pressures that most people work under today, though, this kind of verification phone call is a lot to expect, except when an employee is suspicious that some kind of attack is being made. THE ENGINEER TRAP It is widely known that head-hunter firms use social engineering to recruit corporate talent. Here's an example of how it can happen. In the late 1990s, a not very ethical employment agency signed a new client, a company looking for electrical engineers with experience in the telephone industry. The honcho on the project was a lady endowed with a throaty voice and sexy manner that she had learned to use to develop initial trust and rapport over the phone. The lady decided to stage a raid on a cellular phone service provider to see if she could locate some engineers who might be tempted to walk across the street to a competitor. She couldn't exactly call the switch board and say, \"Let me talk to anybody with five years of engineering experience.\" Instead, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, she began the talent assault by seeking a piece of information that appeared to have no sensitivity at all, information that company people give out to almost anybody who asks. The First Call: The receptionist The attacker, using the name Didi Sands, placed a call to the corporate offices of the cellular phone service. In part, the conversation went like this:\n\n29. Receptionist: Good afternoon. This is Marie, how may I help you? Didi: Can you connect me to the Transportation Department? R: I'm not sure if we have one, I'll look in my directory. Who's calling? D: It's Didi. R: Are you in the building, or... ? D: No, I'm outside the building. R: Didi who? D: Didi Sands. I had the extension for Transportation, but I forgot what it was. R: One moment. To allay suspicions, at this point Didi asked a casual, just making conversation question designed to establish that she was on the \"inside,\" familiar with company locations. D: What building are you in - Lakeview or Main Place? R: Main Place. (pause) It's 805 555 6469. To provide herself with a backup in case the call to Transportation didn't provide what she was looking for, Didi said she also wanted to talk to Real Estate. The receptionist gave her that number, as well. When Didi asked to be connected to the Transportation number, the receptionist tried, but the line was busy. At that point Didi asked for a third phone number, for Accounts Receivable, located at a corporate facility in Austin, Texas. The receptionist asked her to wait a moment, and went off the line. Reporting to Security that she had a suspicious phone call and thought there was something fishy going on? Not at all, and Didi didn't have the least bit of concern. She was being a bit of a nuisance, but to the receptionist it was all part of a typical workday. After about a minute, the receptionist came back on the line, looked up the Accounts Receivable number, tried it, and put Didi through. The Second Call: Peggy The next conversation went like this: Peggy: Accounts Receivable, Peggy. Didi: Hi, Peggy. This is Didi, in Thousand Oaks. P: Hi, Didi. D: How ya doing? P: Fine.\n\n30. Didi then used a familiar term in the corporate world that describes the charge code for assigning expenses against the budget of a specific organization or workgroup: D: Excellent. I have a question for you. How do I find out the cost center for a particular department? P: You'd have to get a hold of the budget analyst for the department. D: Do you know who'd be the budget analyst for Thousand Oaks - headquarters? I'm trying to fill out a form and I don't know the proper cost center. P: I just know when y'all need a cost center number, you call your budget analyst. D: Do you have a cost center for your department there in Texas? P: We have our own cost center but they don't give us a complete list of them. D: How many digits is the cost center? FOr example, what's your cost center? P: Well, like, are you with 9WC or with SAT? Didi had no idea what departments or groups these referred to, but it didn't matter. She answered: D: 9WC. P: Then it's usually four digits. Who did you say you were with? D: Headquarters--Thousand Oaks. P: Well, here's one for Thousand Oaks. It's 1A5N, that's N like in Nancy. By just hanging out long enough with somebody willing to be helpful, Didi had the cost center number she needed - one of those pieces of information that no one thinks to protect because it seems like something that couldn't be of any value to an outsider. The Third Call: A Helpful Wrong Number Didi's next step would be to parlay the cost center number into something of real value by using it as a poker chip. She began by calling the Real Estate department, pretending she had reached a wrong number. Starting with a \"Sorry to bother you, but .... \" she claimed she was an employee who had lost her company directory, and asked who you were supposed to call to get a new copy. The man said the print copy was out of date because it was available on the company intranet site. Didi said she preferred using a hard copy, and the man told her to call Publications, and then, without being asked - maybe just to keep the sexy-\n\n31. sounding lady on the phone a little longer - helpfully looked up the number and gave it to her. The Fourth Call: Bart in Publications In Publications, she spoke with a man named Bart. Didi said she was from Thousand Oaks, and they had a new consultant who needed a copy of the company directory. She told him a print copy would work better for the consultant, even if it was somewhat out of date. Bart told her she'd have to fill out a requisition form and send the form over to him. Didi said she was out of forms and it was a rush, and could Bart be a sweetheart and fill out the form for her? He agreed with a little too much enthusiasm, and Didi gave him the details. For the address of the fictional contractor, she drawled the number of what social engineers call a mail drop, in this case a Mail Boxes Etc.-type of commercial business where her company rented boxes for situations just like this. The earlier spadework now came in handy: There would be a charge for the cost and shipping of the directory. Fine - Didi gave the cost center for Thousand Oaks: \"IA5N, that's N like in Nancy.\" A few days later, when the corporate directory arrived, Didi found it was an even bigger payoff than she had expected: It not only listed the names and phone numbers, but also showed who worked for whom - the corporate structure of the whole organization. The lady of the husky voice was ready to start making her head-hunter, people- raiding phone calls. She had conned the information she needed to launch her raid using the gift of gab honed to a high polish by every skilled social engineer. Now she was ready for the payoff. LINGO MAIL DROP: The social engineer’s term for a rental mailbox, typically rented under an assumed name, which is used to deliver documents or packages the victim has been duped into sending MITNICK MESSAGE Just like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, each piece of information may be irrelevant by itself. However, when the pieces are put together, a clear picture emerges. In this\n\n32. I case, the picture the social engineer saw was the entire internal structure of the company . Analyzing the Con In this social engineering attack, Didi started by getting phone numbers for three departments in the target company. This was easy, because the numbers she was asking for were no secret, especially to employees. A social engineer learns to sound like an insider, and Didi was skilled at this game. One of the phone numbers led her to a cost center number, which she then used to obtain a copy of the firm's employee directory. The main tools she needed: sounding friendly, using some corporate lingo, and, with the last victim, throwing in a little verbal eyelash-batting. And one more tool, an essential element not easily acquired - the manipulative skills of the social engineer, refined through extensive practice and the unwritten lessons of bygone generations of confidence men. MORE \"WORTHLESS\" INFO Besides a cost center number and internal phone extensions, what other seemingly useless information can be extremely valuable to your enemy?. Peter Abel’s Phone Call \"Hi,\" the voice at the other end of the line says. \"This is Tom at Parkhurst Travel. Your tickets to San Francisco are ready. Do you want us to deliver them, or do you want to pick them up?\" \"San Francisco?\" Peter says. \"I'm not going to San Francisco.\" \"Is this Peter Abels?\" \"Yes, but I don't have any trips coming up.\" \"Well,\" the caller says with a friendly laugh, \"you sure you don't want to go to San Francisco?\" \"If you think you can talk my boss into it...\" Peter says, playing along with the friendly conversation. \"Sounds like a mix-up,\" the caller says. \"On our system, we book travel arrangements under the employee number. Maybe somebody used the wrong number. What's your employee number?\" Peter obligingly recites his number. And why not? It goes on just about every personnel form he fills out, lots of people in the company have access to it - human resources, payroll, and, obviously, the outside travel agency. No one treats an employee number like some sort of secret. What difference could it make? The answer isn't hard to figure out. Two or three pieces of information might be all it takes to mount an effective impersonation - the social engineer cloaking himself in someone else's identity. Get hold of an employee's name, his phone\n\n33. number, his employee number--and maybe, for good measure, his manager's name and phone number--and a halfway- competent social engineer is equipped with most of what he's likely to need to sound authentic to the next target he calls. If someone who said he was from another department in your company had called yesterday, given a plausible reason, and asked for your employee number, would you have had any reluctance in giving it to him? And by the way, what is your social security number? MITNICK MESSAGE The moral of the story is, don't give out any personal or internal company information or identifiers to anyone, unless his or her voice is recognizable and the requestor has a need to know. PREVENTING THE CON Your company has a responsibility to make employees aware of how a serious mistake can occur from mishandling non public information. A well thought-out information security policy, combined with proper education and training, will dramatically increase employee awareness about the proper handling of corporate business information. A data classification policy will help you to implement proper controls with respect to disclosing information. Without a data classification policy, all internal information must be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified. Take these steps to protect your company from the release of seemingly innocuous information: The Information Security Department needs to conduct awareness training detailing the methods used by social engineers. One method, as described above, is to obtain seemingly non sensitive information and use it as a poker chip to gain short-term trust. Each and every employee needs to be aware that when a caller has knowledge about company procedures, lingo, and internal identifiers it does not in any way, shape, or form authenticate the requestor or authorize him or her as having a need to know. A caller could be a former employee or contractor with the requisite insider information. Accordingly, each corporation has a responsibility to determine the appropriate authentication method to be used when employees interact with people they don't recognize in person or over the telephone. The person or persons with the role and responsibility of drafting a data classification policy should examine the types of details that may be used to gain\n\n34. access for legitimate employees that seem innocuous, but could lead to information that is, sensitive. Though you'd never give out the access codes for your ATM card, would you tell somebody what server you use to develop company software products? Could that information be used by a person pretending to be somebody who has legitimate access to the corporate network? Sometimes just knowing inside terminology can make the social engineer appear authoritative and knowledgeable. The attacker often relies on this common misconception to dupe his or her victims into compliance. For example, a Merchant ID is an identifier that people in the New Accounts department of a bank casually use every day. But such an identifier exactly the same as a password. If each and every employee understands the nature of this identifier - that it is used to positively authenticate a requestor--they might treat it with more respect. MITNICK MESSAGE As the old adage goes - even real paranoids probably have enemies. We must assume that every business has its enemies, too - attackers that target the network infrastructure to compromise business secrets. Don't end up being a statistic on computer crime - it's high time to shore up the necessary defenses by implementing proper controls through well-thought-out security policies and procedures. No companies - well, very few, at least - give out the direct dial phone numbers of their CEO or board chairman. Most companies, though, have no concern about giving out phone numbers to most departments and workgroups in the, organization - especially to someone who is, or appears to be, an employee. A possible countermeasure: Implement a policy that prohibits giving internal phone numbers of employees, contractors, consultants, and temps to outsiders. More importantly, develop a step-by-step procedure to positively identify whether a caller asking for phone numbers is really an employee. Accounting codes for workgroups and departments, as well as copies of the corporate directory (whether hard copy, data file, or electronic phone book on the intranet) are frequent targets of social engineers. Every company needs a written, well-publicized policy on disclosure of this type of information. The safeguards should include maintaining an audit log that records instances when sensitive information is disclosed to people outside of the company. Information such as an employee number, by itself, should not be used as any sort of authentication. Every employee must be trained to verify not just the identity of a requestor, but also the requestor's need to know.\n\n35. In your security training, consider teaching employees this approach: Whenever asked a question or asked for a favor by a stranger, learn first to politely decline until the request can be verified. Then - before giving in to the natural desire to be Mr. or Ms. Helpful - follow company policies and procedures with respect to verification and disclosure of non public information. This style may go against our natural tendency to help others, but a little healthy paranoia may be necessary to avoid being the social engineer's next dupe. As the stories in this chapter have shown, seemingly innocuous information can be the key to your company's most prized secrets.\n\n36. Chapter 3 The Direct Attack: Just Asking for It Many social engineering attacks are intricate, involving a number of steps and elaborate planning, combining a mix of manipulation and technological know- how. But I always find it striking that a skillful social engineer can often achieve his goal with a simple, straightforward, direct attack. Just asking outright for the information may be all that's needed - as you'll see. AN MLAC QUICKIE Want to know someone's unlisted phone number? A social engineer can tell you half a dozen ways (and you'll find some of them described in other stories in these pages), but probably the simplest scenario is one that uses a single phone call, like this one. Number, Please The attacker dialed the private phone company number for the MLAC, the Mechanized Line Assignment Center. To the woman who answered, he said: \"Hey, this is Paul Anthony. I'm a cable splicer. Listen, a terminal box out here got fried in a fire. Cops think some creep tried to burn his own house down for the insurance. They got me out here alone trying to rewire this entire two hundred- pair terminal. I could really use some help right now. What facilities should be working at 6723 South Main?\" In other parts of the phone company, the person called would know that reverse lookup information on non pub (non published) numbers is supposed to be given out only to authorized phone company MLAC is supposed to be known only to company employees. And while they'd never give out information to the public, who would want to refuse a little help to a company man coping with that heavy- duty assignment?. She feels sorry for him, she's had bad days on the job herself, and she’ll bend the rules a little to help out a fellow employee with a problem. She gives him the cable and pairs and each working number assigned to the address. MITNICK MESSAGE It's human nature to trust our fellow man, especially when the request meets the test of being reasonable. Social engineers use this knowledge to exploit their victims and to achieve their goals.\n\n37. Analyzing the Con As you'll notice repeatedly in these stories, knowledge of a company’s lingo, and of its corporate structure - its various offices and departments what each does and what information each has - is part of the essential bag of tricks of the successful social engineer. YOUNG MAN ON THE RUN A man we'll call Frank Parsons had been on the run for years, still wanted by the federal government for being part of an underground antiwar group in the 1960s. In restaurants he sat facing the door and he had a way of glancing over his shoulder every once in a while that other people found disconcerting. He moved every few years. At one point Frank landed in a city he didn't know, and set about job hunting. For someone like Frank, with his well-developed computer skills (and social engineering skills as well, even ,though he never listed those on a job application), finding a good job usually wasn't a problem. Except in times when the economy is very tight, people with good technical computer knowledge usually find their talents in high demand and they have little problem landing on their feet. Frank quickly located a well – paying job opportunity at a large, upscale, long-term care facility near where he was living. Just the ticket, he thought. But when he started plodding his way through the application forms, he came upon an uh-oh: The employer required the applicant to provide a copy of his state criminal history record, which he had to obtain himself from the state police. The stack of employment papers included a form to request this document, and the form had a little box for providing a fingerprint. Even though they were asking for a print of just the right index finger, if they matched his print with one in the FBI's database, he'd probably soon be working in food service at a federally funded resort. On the other hand, it occurred to Frank that maybe, just maybe, he might still be able to get away with this. Perhaps the state didn't send those fingerprint samples to the FBI at all. How could he find out? How? He was a social engineer--how do you think he found out? He placed a phone call to the state patrol: \"Hi. We're doing a study for the State Department of Justice. We're researching the requirements to implement a new fingerprint identification system. Can I talk to somebody there that's really familiar with what you're doing who could maybe help us out?\"\n\n38. And when the local expert came on the phone, Frank asked a series of questions about what systems they were using, and the capabilities to search and store fingerprint data. Had they had any equipment problems? Were they tied into the National Crime Information Center's (NCIC) Fingerprint Search or just within the state? Was the equipment pretty easy for everybody to learn to use? Slyly, he sneaked the key question in among the rest. The answer was music to his ears: No they weren't tied into the NCIC, they only checked against the state's Criminal Information Index (CII). MITNICK MESSGAE Savvy information swindlers have no qualms about ringing up federal, state, or local government officials to learn about the procedures of law enforcement. With such information in hand, the social engineer may be able to circumvent your company's standard security checks. That was all Frank needed to know. He didn't have any record in that state, so he submitted his application, was hired for the job, and nobody ever showed up at his desk one day with the greeting, \"These gentlemen, are from the FBI and they'd like to have a little talk with you.\" And, according to him, he proved to be a model employee. ON THE DOORSTEP In spite of the myth of the paperless office, companies continue to print out reams of paper every day. Information in print at your company may be vulnerable, even if you use security precautions and stamp it confidential. Here's one story that shows you how social engineers might obtain your most secret documents. Loop-Around Deception Every year the phone company publishes a volume called the Test Number Directory (or at least they used to, and because I am still on supervised release, I'm not going to ask if they still do). This document was highly prized by phone phreaks because it was packed with a list of all the closely guarded phone numbers used by company craftsmen, technicians, a others for things like trunk testing or checking numbers that always ring busy.\n\n39. One of these test numbers, known in the lingo as a loop-around, was particularly useful. Phone phreaks used it as a way to find other phone phreaks to chat with, at no cost to them. Phone phreaks also used it a way to create a call back number to give to, say, a bank. A social engineer would tell somebody at the bank the phone number to call to reach at his office. When the bank called back to the test number (loop-around) the phone phreak would be able to receive the call, yet he had the protection of having used a phone number that could not be traced back to him. A Test Number Directory provided a lot of neat information that could be used by any information-hungry, testosteroned, phone phreak. So when the new directories were published each year, they were coveted by a lot of youngsters whose hobby was exploring the telephone network. MITNICK MESSAGE Security training with respect to company policy designed to protect information assets needs to be for everyone in the company, not just any employee who has electronic or physical access to the company's IT assets. Stevie’s Scam Naturally phone companies don't make these books easy to get hold of, so phone phreaks have to be creative to get one. How can they do this? An eager youngster with a mind bent on acquiring the directory might enact a scenario like this. Late one day, a mild evening in the southern California autumn, a guy I'll call him Stevie phones a small telephone company central office, which is the building from which phone lines run to all the homes and businesses in the established service area. When the switchman on duty answers the call, Stevie announces that he's from the division of the phone company that publishes and distributes printed materials. \"We have your new Test Number Directory,\" he says. \"But for security reasons, we cant deliver your copy until we pick up the old one. And the delivery guy is running late. If you wanna leave your copy just outside your door, he can swing by, pick up yours, drop the new one and be on his way.\" The unsuspecting switchman seems to think that sounds reasonable. He does exactly as asked, putting out on the doorstep of the building his copy of the directory, its cover clearly marked in big red letters with the \"COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL - WHEN NO LONGER NEEDED THIS DOCUMENT MUST BE SHREDDED.\"\n\n40. Stevie drives by and looks around carefully to spot any cops or phone company security people who might be lurking behind trees or watching for him from parked cars. Nobody in sight. He casually picks up the coveted directory and drives away. Here's just one more example of how easy it can be for a social engineer to get what he wants by following the simple principle of \"just ask for it.\" GAS ATTACK Not only company assets are at risk in a social engineering scenario. Sometimes it's a company's customers who are the victims. Working as a customer-service clerk brings its share of frustrations, its share of laughs, and its share of innocent mistakes - some of which can have unhappy consequences for a company's customers. Janie Acton's Story Janie Acton had been manning a cubicle as a customer service rep f Hometown Electric Power, in Washington, D.C., for just over three years. She was considered to be one of the better clerks, smart and conscientious It was Thanksgiving week when this one particular call came in. The caller, said, \"This is Eduardo in the Billing Department. I've got a lady on hold, she's a secretary in the executive offices that works for one of the vice presidents, and she's asking for some information and I can't use my computer I got an email from this girl in Human Resources that said 'ILOVEYOU.’ and when I opened the attachment, I couldn't use my machine any more. A virus. I got caught by a stupid virus. Anyways, could you look up some customer information for me?\" \"Sure,\" Janie answered. \"It crashed your computer? That's terrible.\" \"Yeah.\" \"How can I help?\" Janie asked. Here the attacker called on information from his advance research to make himself sound authentic. He had learned that the information he, wanted was stored in something called the Customer Billing Information System, and he had found out how employees referred to the system. He asked, \"Can you bring up an account on CBIS?\" \"Yes, what's the account number.? \" \"I don't have the number; I need you to bring it up by name.\" \"Okay, what's the name?\" \"It's Heather Marning.\" He spelled the name, and Janie typed it in.\n\n41. \"Okay, I have it up.\" \"Great. Is the account current?\" \"Uh huh, it's current.\" \"What's the account number?\" he asked. \"Do you have a pencil?\" \"Ready to write.\" \"Account number BAZ6573NR27Q.\" He read the number back and then said, \"And what's the service address?\" She gave him the address. \"And what's the phone?\" Janie obligingly read off that information, too. The caller thanked her, said good-bye, and hung up. Janie went on to the next call, never thinking further about it. Art Sealy's Research Project Art Sealy had given up working as a freelance editor for small publishing houses when he found he could make more money doing research for writers and businesses. He soon figured out that the fee he could charge went up in proportion to how close the assignment took him to the sometimes hazy line between the legal and the illegal. Without ever realizing it, certainly without ever giving it a name, Art became a social engineer, using techniques familiar to every information broker. He turned out to have a native talent for the business, figuring out for himself techniques that most social engineers had to learn from others. After a while, he crossed the line without the least twinge of guilt. A man contacted me who was writing a book about the Cabinet in the Nixon years, and was looking for a researcher who could get the inside scoop on William E. Simon, who had been Nixon's Treasury secretary. Mr. Simon had died, but the author had the name of a woman who had been on his staff. He was pretty sure she still lived in D.C., but hadn't been able to get an address. She didn't have a telephone in her name, or at least none that was listed. So that's when he called me. I told him, sure, no problem. This is the kind of job you can usually bring off in a phone call or two, if you know what you're doing. Every local utility company can generally be counted on to give the information away. Of course, you have to BS a little. But what's a little white lie now and then - right? I like to use a different approach each time, just to keep things interesting. \"This is so-and-so in the executive offices\" has always worked well for me. So has \"I've got somebody on the line from Vice President Somebody's office,\" which worked this time, too.\n\n42. MITNICK MESSAGE Never think all social engineering attacks need to be elaborate ruses so complex that they're likely to be recognized before they can be completed. Some are in- and-out, strike-and-disappear, very simple attacks that are no more than.., well, just asking for it. You have to sort of develop the social engineer's instinct, get a sense of how cooperative the person on the other end is going to be with you. This time I lucked out with a friendly, helpful lady. In a single phone call, I had the address and phone number. Mission accomplished. Analyzing the Con Certainly Janie knew that customer information is sensitive. She would never discuss one customer's account with another customer, or give out private information to the public. But naturally, for a caller from within the company, different rules apply. For a fellow employee it's all about being a team player and helping each other get the job done. The man from Billing could have looked up the details himself if his computer hadn't been down with a virus, and she was glad to be able to help a co- worker. Art built up gradually to the key information he was really after, asking questions along the way about things he didn't really need, such as the account number. Yet at the same time, the account number information provided a fallback: If the clerk had become suspicious, he'd call a second time and stand a better chance of success, because knowing the account number would make him sound all the more authentic to the next clerk he reached. It never occurred to Janie that somebody might actually lie about some thing like this, that the caller might not really be from the billing department at all. Of course, the blame doesn't lie at Janie's feet. She wasn't well versed in the rule about making sure you know who you're talking to before discussing information in a customer's file. Nobody had ever told her about the danger of a phone call like the one from Art. It wasn't in the company policy, it wasn't part of her training, and her supervisor had never mentioned it. PREVENTING THE CON A point to include in your security training: Just because a caller or visitor knows the names of some people in the company, or knows some of the corporate lingo or procedures, doesn't mean he is who he claims to be. And it definitely doesn't\n\n43. establish him as anybody authorized to be given internal information, or access to your computer system or network. Security training needs to emphasize: When in doubt, verify, verify, verify. In earlier times, access to information within a company was a mark of rank and privilege. Workers stoked the furnaces, ran the machines, typed the letters, and filed the reports. The foreman or boss told them what to do, when, and how. It was the foreman or boss who knew how many widgets each worker should be producing on a shift, how many and in what colors and sizes the factory needed to turn out this week, next week, and by the end of the month. Workers handled machines and tools and materials, and bosses handled information. Workers needed only the information specific to their specific jobs. The picture is a little different today, isn't it? Many factory workers use some form of computer or computer-driven machine. For a large part of the workforce, critical information is pushed down to the users' desktops so that they can fulfill their responsibility to get their work done. In today's environment, almost everything employees do involves the handling of information. That's why a company's security policy needs to be distributed enterprise-wide, regardless of position. Everybody must understand that it's not just the bosses and executives who have the information that an attacker might be after. Today, workers at every level, even those who don't use a computer, are liable to be targeted. The newly hired rep in the customer service group may be just the weak link that a social engineer breaks to achieve his objective. Security training and corporate security policies need to strengthen that link.\n\n44. Chapter 4 Building Trust Some of these stories might lead you to think that I believe everyone in business is a complete idiot, ready, even eager, to give away every secret in his or her possession. The social engineer knows isn't true. Why are social engineering attacks so successful? It isn't because people are stupid or lack common sense. But we, as human beings are all vulnerable to being deceived because people can misplace their trust if manipulated in certain ways. The social engineer anticipates suspicion and resistance, and he's always prepared to turn distrust into trust. A good social engineer plans his attack like a chess game, anticipating the questions his target might ask so he can be ready with the proper answers. One of his common techniques involves building a sense of trust on the part of his victims. How does a con man make you trust him? Trust me, he can. TRUST: THE KEY TO DECEPTION The more a social engineer can make his contact seem like business as usual, the more he allays suspicion. When people don't have a reason to be suspicious, it's easy for a social engineer to gain their trust. Once he's got your trust, the drawbridge is lowered and the castle door thrown open so he can enter and take whatever information he wants. NOTE You may notice I refer to social engineers, phone phreaks, and con-game operators as 'he\" through most of these stories. This is not chauvinism; it simply reflects the truth that most practitioners in these fields are male. But though there aren’t many women social engineers, the number is growing. There are enough female social engineers out there that you shouldn’t let your guard down just because you hear a women’s voice. In fact, female social engineers have a distinct advantage because they can use their sexuality to obtain cooperation. You’ll find a small number of the so-called gentler sex represented in these pages The First Call: Andrea Lopez Andrea Lopez answered the phone at the video rental store where she worked, and in a moment was smiling: It's always a pleasure when a customer takes the trouble to say he's happy about the service. This caller said he had had a very good experience dealing with the store, and he wanted to send the manager a letter about it.\n\n45. He asked for the manager's name and the mailing address, and she told him it was Tommy Allison, and gave him the address. As he was about to hang up, he had another idea and said, \"I might want to write to your company headquarters, too. What's your store number?\" She gave him that information, as well. He said thanks, added something pleasant about how helpful she had been, and said goodbye. \"A call like that,\" she thought, \"always seems to make the shift go by faster. How nice it would be if people did that more often.\" The Second Call: Ginny \"Thanks for calling Studio Video. This is Ginny, how can I help you?\" \"Hi, Ginny,\" the caller said enthusiastically, sounding as if he talked to Ginny every week or so. \"It's Tommy Allison, manager at Forest Park, Store 863. We have a customer in here who wants to rent Rocky 5 and we're all out of copies. Can you check on what you've got?\" She came back on the line after a few moments and said, \"Yeah, we've got three copies.\" \"Okay, I'll see if he wants to drive over there. Listen, thanks. If you ever need any help from our store, just call and ask for Tommy. I'll be glad to do whatever I can for you.\" Three or four times over the next couple of weeks, Ginny got calls from Tommy for help with one thing or another. They were seemingly legitimate requests, and he was always very friendly without sounding like he was trying to come on to her. He was a little chatty along the way, as well - \"Did you hear about the big fire in Oak Park? Bunch of streets closed over there,\" and the like. The calls were a little break from the routine of the day, and Ginny was always glad to hear from him. One day Tommy called sounding stressed. He asked, \"Have you guys been having trouble with your computers?\" \"No,\" Ginny answered. \"Why?\" \"Some guy crashed his car into a telephone pole, and the phone company repairman says a whole part of the city will lose their phones and Internet connection till they get this fixed.\" \"Oh, no. Was the man hurt?\" \"They took him away in an ambulance. Anyway, I could use a little help. I've got a customer of yours here who wants to rent Godfather II and doesn't have his card with him. Could you verify his information for me?\" \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\n46. Tommy gave the customer's name and address, and Ginny found him in the computer. She gave Tommy the account number. \"Any late returns or balance owed?\" Tommy asked. \"Nothing showing.\" \"Okay, great. I'll sign him up by hand for an account here and put it in our database later on when the computers come back up again. And he wants to put this charge on the Visa card he uses at your store, and he doesn't have it with him. What's the card number and expiration date?\" She gave it to him, along with the expiration date. Tommy said, \"Hey, thanks for the help. Talk to you soon,\" and hung up. Doyle Lonnegan's Story Lonnegan is not a young man you would want to find waiting when you open your front door. A one-time collection man for bad gambling debts, he still does an occasional favor, if it doesn't put him out very much. In this case, he was offered a sizable bundle of cash for little more than making some phone calls to a video store. Sounds easy enough. It's just that none of his \"customers\" knew how to run this con; they needed somebody with Lonnegan's talent and know- how. People don't write checks to cover their bets when they're unlucky or stupid at the poker table. Everybody knows that. Why did these friends of mine keep on playing with a cheat that didn't have green out on the table? Don't ask. Maybe they're a little light in the IQ department. But they're friends of mine--what can you do? This guy didn't have the money, so they took a check. I ask you! Should of drove him to an ATM machine, is what they should of done. But no, a check. For $3,230. Naturally, it bounced. What would you expect? So then they call me; can I help? I don't close doors on people's knuckles any more. Besides, there are better ways nowadays. I told them, 30 percent commission, I'd see what I could do. So they give me his name and address, and I go up on the computer to see what's the closest video store to him. I wasn't in a big hurry. Four phone calls to cozy up to the store manager, and then, bingo, I've got the cheat's Visa card number. Another friend of mine owns a topless bar. For fifty bucks, he put the guy's poker money through as a Visa charge from the bar. Let the cheat explain that to his wife. You think he might try to tell Visa it's not his charge? Think again. He knows we know who he is. And if we could get his Visa number, he'll figure we could get a lot more besides. No worries on that score.\n\n47. Analyzing the Con Tommy's initial calls to Ginny were simply to build up trust. When time came for the actual attack, she let her guard down and accepted Tommy for who he claimed to be, the manager at another store in the chain. And why wouldn't she accept him--she already knew him. She'd only met him over the telephone, of course, but they had established a business friendship that is the basis for trust. Once she had accepted him as an authority figure, a manager in the same company, the trust had been established and the rest was a walk in the park. MITNICK MESSAGE The sting technique of building trust is one of the most effective social engineering tactics. You have to think whether you really know the person you're talking to. In some rare instances, the person might not be who he claims to be. Accordingly, we all have to learn to observe, think, and question authority. VARIATION ON A THEME: CARD CAPTURE Building a sense of trust doesn't necessarily demand a series of phone calls with the victim, as suggested by the previous story. I recall one incident I witnessed where five minutes was all it took. Surprise, Dad I once sat at a table in a restaurant with Henry and his father. In the course of conversation, Henry scolded his father for giving out his credit card number as if it were his phone number. \"Sure, you have to give your card number when you buy something,\" he said. \"But giving it to a store that files your number in their records - that's real dumb.\" The only place I do that is at Studio Video,\" Mr. Conklin said, naming the same chain of video stores. \"But I go over my Visa bill every month. If they started running up charges, I'd know it. Sure,\" said Henry, \"but once they have your number, it's so easy for somebody to steal it \" You mean a crooked employee.\" No, anybody - not just an employee.\" You're talking through your hat,\" Mr. Conklin said. I can call up right now and get them to tell me your Visa number,\" Henry shot back. No, you can't, \"his father said. \"I can do it in five minutes, right here in front of you without ever leaving the table.\"\n\n48. Mr. Conklin looked tight around the eyes, the look of somebody feeling sure of himself, but not wanting to show it. \"I say you don't know that you're talking about,\" he barked, taking out his wallet and slapping fifty dollar bill down on the table. \"If you can do what you say, that's yours. \"I don't want your money, Dad,\" Henry said. He pulled out his cell phone, asked his father which branch he used, and called Directory Assistance for the phone number, as well as the number of the store in nearby Sherman Oaks. He then called the Sherman Oaks store. Using pretty much the same approach described in the previous story, he quickly got the manager's name and the store number. Then he called the store where his father had an account. He pulled the old impersonate-the-manager trick, using the manager's name as his own and giving the store number he had just obtained. Then he used the same ruse: \"Are your computers working okay? Ours have been up and down.\" He listened to her reply and then said, \"Well, look, I've got one of your customers here who wants to rent a video, but our computers are down right now. I need you to look up the customer account and make sure he's a customer at your branch.\" Henry gave him his father's name. Then, using only a slight variation in technique, he made the request to read off the account information: address, phone number, and date the account was opened. And then he said, \"Hey, listen, I'm holding up a long line of customers here. What's the credit card number and expiration date?\" Henry held the cell phone to his ear with one hand while he wrote on a paper napkin with the other. As he finished the call, he slid the napkin in front of his father, who stared at it with his mouth hanging open. The to poor guy looked totally shocked, as if his whole system of trust had just gone down the drain. Analyzing the Con Think of your own attitude when somebody you don't know asks you for something. If a shabby stranger comes to your door, you're not likely to let him in; if a stranger comes to your door nicely dressed, shoes shined, hair perfect, with polite manner and a smile, you're likely to be much less suspicious. Maybe he's really Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, but you're willing to start out trusting that person as long as he looks normal and doesn't have a carving knife in his hand. What's less obvious is that we judge people on the telephone the same way. Does this person sound like he's trying to sell me something? Is he friendly and outgoing or do I sense some kind of hostility or pressure? Does he or she have the"
