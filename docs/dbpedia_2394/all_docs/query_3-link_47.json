        "text": "In fact, you can see Masaccio’s “Trinity”, Giotto’s “Crucifix” and Brunelleschi‘s wooden “Crucifix”, the same artist and architect who designed the dome of the Duomo of Florence. Another remarkable work kept in Santa Maria Novella Church is “The Nativity” scene made by a young Sandro Botticelli placed above the main door of the church.\n\nThe second church visit of our Florentine Churches Tour is the “Basilica of St Lawrence”, located in the city’s main market district and it is the burial place of the main members of the Medici family. The design was commissioned to Filippo Brunelleschi, but the church was completed after his death. The interior design is completely different from the rough façade, it was designed with Classical architecture of simple lines that come together in the altar which makes the interior look more spacious and creates a pleasant sensation of light. The main visitors’ entrance is through the “cloister” which is a green space elegantly framed by Ionic style columns and the “loggia” above while the members of the Medici family are buried in the crypt just after the cloister, including “Lorenzo the Magnificent” and his grandfather “Cosimo de’ Medici”.\n\nAfterwards, our guide will lead you to visit the “Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore” better known as the “Duomo” -, the “Baptistery of St John” and “Giotto’s Bell Tower”. These buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the dome of the cathedral, designed by “Filippo Brunelleschi”, is still the largest brick dome ever built. The Duomo is a vast Gothic structure, and it took two centuries to be finished but it was consecrated when even the façade was not completed. Aside from the complex architecture, inside you can see beautiful frescos such as the “Last Judgment” designed by Giorgio Vasari and a peculiar clock above the entrance setted with the “ora italica” where the day ends at sunset.\n\nThe Florentine Churches Tour offers a guided visit to the Santa Croce Church, the biggest Franciscan church and one of the symbols of Gothic art in Italy. This Church was the witness of the meetings of great Renaissance artists, theologists and politicians.\n\nAccording to the legends, the Santa Croce Church was founded by “St Francis” himself and among its most remarkable features are its 16 chapels which many of them are decorated with frescoes by “Giotto” and its pupils."
