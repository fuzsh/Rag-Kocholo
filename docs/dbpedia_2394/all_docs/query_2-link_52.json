        "text": "DECEMBER\n\nThe month of December is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. With most of the month being taken up by the season of Advent, the month’s devotion to the Immaculate Conception highlights as an important time of preparation, for both Jesus and Mary, as she was prepared by God to be sinless so that she would be worthy of being the Mother of God.\n\nDecember 3 – St Francis Xavier\n\nDecember 3 is the feast day of Saint Francis Xavier, a 16th century Spanish missionary who co-founded the Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuits.\n\nBorn into nobility in the Kingdom of Navarre in 1506, his father died when he was just nine years old. In 1525, he went to study in Paris at the Collège Sainte-Barbe, University of Paris, where he spent the next eleven years, gaining a reputation as an athlete.\n\nIn 1529, he shared a room with his friend Pierre Favre, when a new student, Ignatius of Loyola, came to join them. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest but couldn’t convince Francis. Over the next few years, he gradually won him over however.\n\nIn 1534, seven students, including Ignatius, Pierre and Francis, met in the crypt beneath the Church of Saint Denis, and made private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the Pope, vowing to go to the Holy Lands to convert people. Francis began study for the priesthood that year and was ordained in 1537.\n\nIn 1539, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order called the Society of Jesus. The order was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.\n\nAfter another member of the order fell sick, Francis was sent on the first Jesuit mission to Asia. He departed from Lisbon in 1541 and arrived in Goa, the capital of Portuguese India in 1542. His first mission was to restore Christianity among the Portuguese settlers. His mission began to spread beyond the settlers however, to the native Indian population.\n\nHe set out for Portuguese Malacca (modern-day Malaysia) in 1545, preaching the gospel there. In 1547, Francis met a Japanese man, Anjiro, who had heard of Francis. Anjiro became the first Japanese Christian.\n\nWhile Francis was forced to return to Goa for a brief period, he returned to southeast Asia and reached Japan in 1549. He was given a friendly welcome but forbidden from converting anyone to Christianity, under threat of death. Despite this, Francis worked in Japan for more than two years, helping to establish Christianity in Japan, despite it being forced underground.\n\nIn 1552, he attempted to go to Mainland China, but could only reach the island of Shangchuan. He died of fever on the island in December 1552, while waiting for a boat to take him to the mainland.\n\nHis body was initially buried on the beach on the island before being taken and temporarily rebuired in Portuguese Malacca in 1553. Later that year, it was taken to Goa, where it now sits in the Basilica of Bom Jesus.\n\nFrancis was beatified by Paul V in 1619 and canonised by Gregory XV in 1622, along with his old friend, Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nDecember 4 – St John Damascene\n\nDecember 4 is the feast day of Saint John Damascene, an 8th century monk, priest, hymnographer and apologist.\n\nBorn in Damascus in 675, he was raised in a Christian Arab family. His father encouraged him to not only learn about Islam, but also the Greeks. According to one account, he was tutored by a monk called Cosmas, who had been kidnapped by Arabs from his home in Sicily. Under his tutelage, he studied music, astronomy, theology, geometry and arithmetic.\n\nFollowing his study, he became a priest and monk at the Mar Saba monastery near Jerusalem. When the Patriarch of Constantinople, Emperor Leo III, issued an edict against the veneration of images and their exhibition in public places, John undertook a spirited defence of holy images.\n\nHis writings played an important role in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 when the icon dispute was settled.\n\nAccording to tradition, he died at Mar Saba in 749. He was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII in 1890.\n\nDecember 6 – Saint Nicholas\n\nDecember 6 is the feast day of Saint Nicholas, an early Christian Bishop whose reputation for secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus.\n\nVery little is known about his life because he lived during a turbulent time in Roman history and so many contemporary accounts have been lost. Traditionally, he was born in the city of Patara, a port on the Mediterranean Sea, to a family of wealthy Greek Christians. His uncle was the Bishop of Myra and ordained Nicholas as a priest.\n\nWhen his parents died, Nicholas distributed their wealth to the poor. In many cases, he distributed money and other gifts to those in need, in secret.\n\nOn a trip to the Holy Land, the ship he was on endured a terrible storm but when Nicholas rebuked the waves, the storm subsided. Following his visit to the Holy Land, he returned to Myra, where he was quickly made Bishop.\n\nNicholas also attended the First Council of Nicaea, where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism. According to legend, he lost his termer and slapped an Arian across the face during the council which led Constantine to revoke Nicholas’s miter and pallium.\n\nThroughout his life, he is said to have performed many miracles. He died in 343 at the age of 73.\n\nFollowing his death, the traditional model of Santa Claus began to evolve from Dutch traditions of gift-giving associated with Saint Nicholas.\n\nDecember 7 – St Ambrose\n\nDecember 7 is the feast day of Saint Ambrose, a theologian and statesman who served as Bishop of Milan in the 4th century and was a fierce critic of paganism and Arianism.\n\nAmbrose was born into a Roman Christian family in 339. His father died early in his life and the family moved to Rome, where Ambrose studied literature, law and rhetoric. He entered public service and became governor of the province of Liguria and Emilia in 372.\n\nIn 374, the Bishop of Milan died, several Arians challenged the succession. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place to prevent an uproar. His address was interrupted by calls for him to be made Bishop.\n\nWhile he initially refused the office of Bishop, within a week he was baptised, ordained and consecrated as the new Bishop of Milan. He immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle and donated all of his land, making him popular with the people.\n\nAs the heresy of Arianism began to spread through the Western and Eastern empires, Ambrose became one of its key critics, but struggled to balance the ecclesiastical unity of the Church with the true understanding of the faith.\n\nAmbrose was a passionate theologian and his sermons helped convert Augustine of Hippo to Christianity. Ambrose also baptised Augustine.\n\nAmbrose died in 397. His body remains in the church of Saint Ambrogio in Milan.\n\nDecember 8 – Feast of the Immaculate Conception\n\nDecember 8 is the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, celebrating the sinless life and Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe feast takes place nine months before the feast of the Nativity of Mary and is one of the most important Marian feasts in the liturgical calendar.\n\nEastern Christian churches were commemorating the feast of the conception of Mary as early as the 5th century in Syria and was widely spread by the 7th century. The feast made its way into the Western Church in the 8th century.\n\nIn 1708, Pope Clement XI made the feast a Holy Day of obligation.\n\nDecember 11 – St Damasus I\n\nDecember 11 is the feast day of Saint Damasus I, the Bishop of Rome in the late 4th century who presided over the Council of Rome which determined the canon of Sacred Scripture.\n\nBorn in Rome in 305, his father became a priest at the Church of San Lorenzo in Rome. Damasus began his ecclesiastical career as a deacon in his father’s church, before becoming a priest at the same church.\n\nIn 366, Damasus succeeded to the papacy following the death of Pope Liberius, in the midst of factional violence. During his papacy, he was active in defending the Church against the threat of schism, condemning Apollinarianism (belief that Christ was not fully divine or fully human) and Macedonianism (deniers of the godhood of the Holy Spirit).\n\nHe presided over the Council of Rome in 382, which helped determine the official list of Sacred Scriptrue. He commissioned Jerome to produce a new Latin translation of the Bible, which was called the Vulgate and became the Church’s officially promulgated Latin version of the Bible.\n\nDamasus also encouraged the veneration of Christian martyrs, restoring and creating access to their tombs.\n\nHe was pope for 18 years and two months, passing away in 384. He was buried beside his mother and sister although the site of the grave has been lost.\n\nDecember 12 – Our Lady of Guadalupe\n\nDecember 12 is the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a Catholic title for Mary associated with five Marian apparitions which occurred in Mexico in the 16th century.\n\nIn 1531, the Virgin Mary appeared for times to Juan Diego, an indigenous Mexican peasant Chichimec, and his uncle. The woman spoke to Juan Diego in his native Nahuatl language and identified herself as the Virgin Mary. She asked for a church to be built at the site in her honour.\n\nThe Archbishop of Mexico City, Fray Juan de Zumarraga, did not believe him at first, telling Juan Diego to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. He would see her four more times. When his uncle became ill, Juan Diego was forced to attend to him. He journeyed to get a Catholic priest to hear his confession and minister to him on his deathbed.\n\nAfter being intercepted by the Virgin Mary, she chided him for not having made resource to her, saying: \"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\" She assured him his uncle was now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren. He obliged and found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.\n\nThe Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego’s cloak and when he opened his cloak later than day before Archbishop Zumárraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. He found his uncle fully recovered to.\n\nThe Archbishop kept Juan Diego’s cloak, first in his private chapel, then in a chapel erected on Tepeyac Hill where the apparitions occurred. In 1695, the Old Basilica of Guadalupe was built on the site. Due to the huge number of pilgrims visiting the site, a new Basilica was built in the late 20th century.\n\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.\n\nDecember 13 – St Lucy\n\nDecember 13 is the feast day of Saint Lucy, a virgin and martyr who was killed during the Diocletianic Persecution of the early 4th century.\n\nAccording to tradition, Lucy was born to noble parents in 283 AD. Her father died when she was just five years old.\n\nLucy had consecrated her virginity to God and hoped to distribute her dowry to the poor. Her mother arranged for her marriage to a young man of a wealthy pagan family. Her mother suffered from a bleeding disorder and made a trip to St Agatha’s shrine to ask for a cure.\n\nSt Agatha came to Lucy in a dream and told her, her mother would be cured. She convinced her mother to give away more of her riches to the poor.\n\nLucy’s betrothed heard about the family’s wealth being given away and denounced her to the Governor of Syracuse, who ordered her to burn a sacrifice to the emperor’s image. When she refused, she was met with death by sword, thrust into her throat.\n\nIn other accounts, she was tortured by eye gouging, however her eyes were miraculously restored when her body was being prepared for burial. Her body remained in Sicily for 400 years before it was transferred elsewhere in Italy. Today, parts of her body remain in Syracuse, while the remainder of her relics are in Venice.\n\nDecember 14 – St John of the Cross\n\nDecember 14 is the feast day of St John of the Cross, a Spanish priest, mystic, Doctor of the Church, and Carmelite friar who was a major figure in the Counter-Reformation.\n\nBorn Juan de Yepes y Álvarez in a small town near Avila, in 1542, he was descended from Jewish converts to Catholicism. His father, Gonzalo, married his mother, who was an orphan of a lower class and he was rejected by his family. Gonzalo died when John was just three years old.\n\nHis family moved to Medina del Campo for his mother to find work and he entered school to receive a basic education. While studying there, he was chosen to serve as an altar boy at a nearby Augustinian monastery. He later studied at a Jesuit school from 1559 to 1563. In 1563, he entered the Carmelite Order and adopted the name John of St Matthias.\n\nHe made his First Profession in 1564 and studied theology and philosophy. He was ordained a priest in 1567. He met Teresa of Avila in Medina where she was hoping to found the second of her new convents. She talking to him about seeking to restore the purity of the Carmelite Order and she asked him to follow her. In 1568, he helped found a new monastery for Carmelite friars, following in her principles.\n\nHe adopted the new name John of the Cross. He became the spiritual director and confessor to Teresa and the 130 other nuns at the Convent of the Incarnation. Over the next few years, he would remain with Teresa. During this time, he had a vision of the crucified Christ.\n\nTensions began to increase between the Carmelites and the reformers with Teresa and John. In 1577, a group of Carmelites opposed to reform broke into John’s dwelling in Avila and took him prisoner, after he refused to leave the town. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a monastery, enduring a brutal regime of lashings and isolation. He managed to escaped in 1578 and was nursed by to health by Teresa’s nuns in Toledo.\n\nIn 1580, Pope Gregory XIII signed a decree which authorised the separation of the new “Discalced” Carmelites, from the old order. Through the rest of his life, he helped to establish new convents, even after the death of Teresa.\n\nWhile at an isolated monastery in Andalusia, he fell ill and travelled to another monastery for treatment. His conditioned worsened and he died of erysipelas in 1591. He was beatified in 1675 by Pope Clement X and canonised by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. In 1926, he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XI.\n\nDecember 21 – St Peter Canisius\n\nDecember 21 is the feast day of Saint Peter Canisius, a Jesuit priest who was an ardent defender of the Catholic faith during the Protestant Reformation.\n\nBorn in Nijmegen in the Duchy of Guelders in 1521, he was sent to study at the University of Cologne where he earned a master’s degree at the age of 19.\n\nWhile studying, he met Peter Faber, one of the founders of the Society of Jesus. Canisius joined the society and through his preaching and writings, became one of the most influential Catholics of his time.\n\nIn 1574, he attended several session of the Council of Trent and became an influential figure in Germany through his German Catechism which defined the basic principles of Catholicism in the German language.\n\nHe moved to Germany and served as the main preacher in the Cathedral of Augsburg from 1559 to 1568, defending Catholicism as the wave of Protestantism swept through Germany.\n\nBy the time he left Germany, the Society of Jesus had become a powerful tool in the Counter-Reformation. He founded several educational institutions in the country.\n\nIn 1591, at the age of 70, he suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed although he continued to write. He died in 1597 in Fribourg, Switzerland, at the age of 76.\n\nHe was beatified by Pope Pius IX in 1864. He was canonised and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1925 by Pope Pius XI.\n\nDecember 25 – Nativity of the Lord\n\nDecember 25 is the Feast of the Nativity of the Lord, (commonly known as Christmas Day) celebrating the birth of Jesus, our Lord and saviour.\n\nThe birth of Christ is described in the biblical gospel of Luke and Matthew. They recount Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judaea, in a manger. His birth was announced to shepherds, who then came to adore the young Messiah.\n\nThis was followed by the Magi, who followed a bright star to find the Lord and adored him too.\n\nDuring the Nativity of the Lord, we celebrate the joyous news of His Birth. It represents the first day of the Christmas season, which runs until the Baptism of Jesus in early January.\n\nOn Christmas day, we gifts with one another, sharing in the gift-giving of the Three Wise Men, who came to give gifts to the young Messiah.\n\nDecember 26 – St Stephen\n\nDecember 26 is the feast day of Saint Stephen, the first martyr of the Church, who was stoned to death for preaching the message of Christ.\n\nStephen was first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as one of the seven deacons appointed by the Apostles to serve the community of the early Church.\n\nStephen was also a teacher and his teachings drew the opposition of many people. His teachings were challenged by members of several synagogues but he bested them in debate. After being humiliated by them, they suborned false testimony that he had preached blasphemy and dragged him before the Sanhedrin.\n\nIn a long speech to the Sandhedrin, he appealed to the Jewish scriptures to show how Jesus fulfilled the laws of Moses, not subverted them, denouncing the listeners as “stiff-necked” people who rejected the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe angered the people in the crowd, and they began to throw stones at them. Paul the Apostle was among those who began to stone him. Stephen prayed the Lord would receive his spirit and his killers would be forgiven. He sank to his knees and died.\n\nIn the aftermath of his death, the remaining disciples, except the Apostles, fled to distant lands.\n\nHe is venerated as the first of millions to die for the Christian faith, spreading the Good News of Jesus.\n\nDecember 27 – St John the Apostle\n\nDecember 27 is the feast of Saint John the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus who wrote a number of books of the New Testament.\n\nJohn was the son of Zebedee and younger brother of James the Great, another of the Twelve Apostles. He and his brother were fisherman before following Jesus.\n\nJohn, along with James and Peter, had a special place in Jesus’ ministry. They were the only Apostles present at the Raising of Jairus’ daughter, the Transfiguration of Jesus, and the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\nFollowing Jesus’ ascension, he and Peter took a prominent role in founding and guiding the Church.\n\nTraditionally, it’s believed he was the only Apostle to not have been martyred, dying at Ephesus sometime after 98 AD during the reign of Trajan.\n\nHe is said to have authored the three Johannine epistles, the Book of Revelation, and the Gospel of John.\n\nDecember 28 – Massacre of the Holy Innocents\n\nDecember 28 is the commemoration of the Massacre of the Holy Innocents, when Herod the Great ordered the execution of all male children who were two years old and younger.\n\nThe event is recounted in the Gospel of Matthew:\n\n“When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men.\n\n“Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: 18“A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.”\n\nThese children are seen as the first Christian martyrs, who died instead of Jesus, and whose sacrifice bore the fruit of salvation for all.\n\nDecember 29 – St Thomas Becket\n\nDecember 29 is the feast day of Saint Thomas Becket, a 12th English nobleman who served as Archbishop of Canterbury and was murdered due to his conflict with King Henry II.\n\nBecket was born in 1119 in London to noble parents. During his childhood, Becket encountered hunting and hawking.\n\nAt the age of 10, he was sent as a student to Merton Priory in Surrey, later attending a grammar school in London. After his father suffered financial troubles, Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk, eventually acquiring a position in the household of Theobold of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHe was entrusted with several important missions to Rome and he was sent to Bologna and Auxerre to study canon law. He was named Archdeacon of Canterbury in 1154. He was appointed Lord Chancellor, in 1155, by King Henry II.\n\nHe was nominated Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162 following the death of Theobold. He became an ascetic during this time. He was ordained as a priest in 1162 and consecrated as archbishop a day later.\n\nA rift began to grown between King Henry II and Becket, as Becket sought to extend the rights of the archbishopric. Becket refused to sign 16 constitutions which would have sought less clerical independence and weaker connections with Rome, which led to him fleeing to Europe.\n\nWhen becket excommunicated three Bishops who intended to crown the heir apparent of King Henry II, he excommunicated all three. This led King Henry II to utter the phrase \"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\".\n\nFour knights set out to confront Becket and he was viciously killed by them in 1170.\n\nHe began being venerated as a martyr shortly after his death and was canonised by Pope Alexander III in 1173.\n\nDecember 30 – Feast of the Holy Family\n\nDecember 30 is the feast day of the Holy Family, comprising Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.\n\nThe feast day commemorates the Holy Family as a model of tranquillity and harmony for all families.\n\nSaint Josemaria Escrivá describes the Holy Family as a model for ordinary holiness: “What was family life in Nazareth like? In the home of the Holy Family in Nazareth, Jesus, Mary and Joseph sanctified their ordinary life, without doing anything spectacular or newsworthy. They led a life that was to all appearances, the same as that of their neighbours, a life that was important, not because of the material things they did but because of the love that they put into these things, in perfect union with the Will of God the Father.”\n\nDuring the Christmas season when many families are united and reunited, the feast of the Holy Family represents a beautiful time of reflection to understand how we can emulate the Holy Family in our own family units.\n\nDecember 31 – St Sylvester I\n\nDecember 31 is the feast day of Saint Sylvester I, the Bishop of Rome from 314 to 335.\n\nLittle is known about his life however several large churches were founded and built during his pontificate, including the Basilica of St. John Lateran, Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, Old St. Peter's Basilica and several churches built over the graves of martyrs.\n\nHe did not attend the First Council of Nicaea, which took place during his pontificate, however he was represented by two legates and approved the council’s decision.\n\nAccording to legend, he was responsible for the conversion of the Emperor Constantine to Christianity. He is said to have cured Constantine of leprosy through the power of God.\n\nFollowing his death, Sylvester was buried in the Catacomb of Priscilla.\n\nJANUARY\n\nThe month of January is dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus, commemorating the naming of the child Jesus following his birth at Christmas. The feast has historically been celebrated at various points through January and so the whole month has been dedicated to devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus.\n\nJanuary 1 – Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God\n\nJanuary 1 is the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, honouring the Blessed Virgin Mary and her motherhood of Jesus Christ.\n\nMary’s title as Mother of God was first declared at the Council of Ephesus, in 431. The early Church celebrated a feast called the anniversary of the Mother of God however this began to be overshadowed and by the 7th century, it was simply celebrated as the octave day of Christmas, the eighth day following Jesus birth, when he was circumcised.\n\nIn the 13th century, January 1 began to be celebrated as the feast of the Circumcision of the Lord, while still being orientated towards Mary, glorifying her maternity. In 20th century, the mention of the circumcision was removed, and the day was dedicated to Mary as the Holy Mother of God.\n\nJanuary 2 – St Basil the Great and St Gregory Nazianzen\n\nJanuary 2 is the feast day of Saints Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen, 4th century bishops and two of the Cappadocian Fathers, who helped advance the development of many key elements of Christian theology.\n\nBasil was born in 330 into a wealthy Cappadocian Greek family, receiving a formal education in Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia, where he met Gregory Nazianzen. Gregory had been born to Greek parents in 329, in the village of Arianzus, near Nazianzus, in southwest Cappadocia.\n\nAfter being ordained, both men went on to be bishops. Basil became Bishop of Caesarea in 370 and Gregory became Bishop of Sasima in 372. Throughout their lives, they defended the Church from the heresy of Arianism, which had been infecting the Church at the time.\n\nTheir strong stance drew fierce criticism but they remained faithful to their teachings. Their volumes of writings helped to define some of the most important elements of Christian theology, including Christ’s divinity and the Holy Trinity.\n\nWhile both men were known for their intelligence and writings, they were also known for their faithfulness and piety.\n\nBasil distributed food to the poor during famines and he encouraged all his clergy not to be tempted by wealth. He built a large complex outside Caesarea which consisted of a poorhouse, hospice and hospital to care for people.\n\nGregory donated most of his inheritance to the needy and lived an austere existence through his episcopate.\n\nBoth men are honoured as Doctors of the Church due to their extensive writings, contributions to Christian theology and fierce defence of the Church against heresy.\n\nJanuary 3 – Most Holy Name of Jesus\n\nJanuary 3 is the feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, commemorating the naming of the child Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\n\nThe feast has been celebrated in the Church since the end of the 15th century. Observance of the feast was officially granted to the Franciscans in 1530 and spread through the Church. It was celebrated in January although on different dates by different orders.\n\nThe day began to be celebrated towards the start of January and is now celebrated on January 3. The entire month of January is also dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.\n\nJanuary 7 – St Raymond of Penyafort\n\nJanuary 7 is the feast day of Saint Raymond of Penyafort, a 13th century Catalan Dominican friar who compiled a key collection of canonical laws, which formed a key part of Church law for close to 700 years.\n\nBorn in Vilafranca del Penedès, a small town near Barcelona in 1175, he was educated in Barcelona and at the University of Bologna where he received doctorates in both civil and canon law. He taught canon law from 1195 to 1210 and became Chair of canon law at the University of Bologna.\n\nWhile teaching, he became attracted to the Dominican Order and received the habit at the age of 47 in 1222, at the Dominican Convent of Barcelona.\n\nHaving gained a reputation in the juridical sciences, Pope Gregory IX ordered Raymond, who had become his chaplain and confessor, to help in rearranging and codifying canon law, which had previously been scattered across several sets of documents.\n\nRaymond’s collection of canon law, known as the Decretals of Gregory IX, became a standard for almost 700 years.\n\nHe is well known for a famous miracle performed while serving as confessor for King James I of Aragon on Majorca. When Raymond reproved the king and asked him to dismiss his concubine, he was told he would not be allowed to leave the island of Majorca. Raymond went to the seashore, rigged his cloak to his walking staff to form a mast and boat. He set off sailing to the astonishment of the nearby sailors and made it to Barcelona in the space of six hours.\n\nHe died at the age of 100 in Barcelona in 1275. He was canonised by Pope Clement VIII in 1601 and buried in the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia in Barcelona. He is the patron saint of canon lawyers.\n\nJanuary 8 – Epiphany of the Lord\n\nJanuary 8 is the feast of the Epiphany of the Lord, celebrating the revelation of Jesus Christ as God incarnate.\n\nThe feast principally commemorates the visit of the Magi to the Christ Child, that even being Jesus’ physical manifestation to the Gentiles. The word epiphany means manifestation or appearance.\n\nThe Epiphany was first celebrated as a feast as early as the 4th century and originally combined a celebration of his baptism. In 1955, the two celebrations were separated, and the Baptism of Jesus now follows the celebration of the Epiphany.\n\nJanuary 9 – Baptism of the Lord\n\nJanuary 9 is the feast of the Baptism of the Lord, commemorating Jesus’ baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River.\n\nThe baptism is described in the three synoptic Gospels of the New Testament. In the Gospels, Jesus goes to the Jordan River to be baptised by John the Baptist. After he is baptised, the Holy Spirit descends upon him and a voice from heaven says: \"You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\".\n\nThe baptism of Jesus is considered to be the start of his earthly ministry.\n\nThe celebration of his baptism has existed since the very early Church, but was often celebrated along with the Epiphany. In 1955, it was instituted as a separate liturgical commemoration.\n\nJanuary 13 – St Hilary\n\nJanuary 13 is the feast day of Saint Hilary, a 4th century Bishop and Doctor of the Church, who was a key defender of the Church against Arianism.\n\nBorn in Poitiers near the beginning of the 4th century to pagan parents, he studied Old and New Testament writings and ended up abandoning his pagan faith. His wife and daughter were baptised and received into the Church.\n\nHe became so respected by the Christians of Poitiers, they unanimously elected him as their bishop. At the time, Arianism was threatening to overrun the Western Church so Hilary undertook to repel it.\n\nAfter writing to Emperor Constantius II against the persecutions by which the Arians had sought to crush their opponents, Hilary was exiled for four years in 356, although the exact reason for his banishment remains unclear.\n\nWhile in Phrygia, he continued to govern his diocese and write important works of theology. In his works, he attempted to show the difference between certain doctrines and beliefs was in words, rather than ideas. During his time in exile, he made repeated requests for public debate, which proved so inconvenient, he was sent back to his diocese in 361.\n\nAfter returning to his diocese in 361, he continued to spend much of his life defending the Church against heretics. He died in Poitiers in 367. He was recognised as a Doctor of the Church in 1851 by Pope Pius IX.\n\nJanuary 17 – St Anthony the Great\n\nJanuary 17 is the feast day of Saint Anthony the Great, a 4th century Egyptian monk who is known as the Father of All Monks, due to his important influence on Christian monasticism.\n\nAnthony was in Korma in Lower Egypt to wealthy landowner parents in 251. His parents died when he was 20 years old, leaving him with the care of his unmarried sister. After placing her with a group of Christian virgins, Anthony gave away all his family’s property, donating the funds to the poor and pursuing an ascetic life.\n\nHe became the disciple of a local hermit, working as a swineherd. He maintained a strict diet of bread, salt and water, never eating meat or drinking wine. He would fast for days at a time.\n\nDuring his time in isolation, he would face demons in the shape of wild beasts, who would inflict blows upon him.\n\nAfter 15 years living as a hermit, he decided to retire to absolute solitude. He went into the desert to a mountain by the Nile and live in an abandoned Roman fort for 20 years. Food was thrown to him over the wall and he was visited at times by pilgrims, who he refused to see.\n\nOver the years, a colony of hermits began to form. They begged Anthony to come out and be their guide in the spiritual life. Eventually he yielded, devoting himself to the instruction and organization of a great body of monks. After five or six years, he retreated into solitude again, although he would freely see visitors.\n\nIn 338, he left the desert to visit Alexandria and help refute the teachings of Arius.\n\nIn 356, sensing his death approaching, he commanded his disciples to give his staff to Macarius of Egypt, and to give one sheepskin cloak to Athanasius of Alexandria and the other sheepskin cloak to Serapion of Thmuis. After his death, he was interred in a grave next to his cell.\n\nWhile not the first ascetic or hermit, he became known as the Father of Monasticism due to the organization of his disciples into a community.\n\nJanuary 20 – St Fabian\n\nJanuary 20 is the feast day of Saint Fabian, the Bishop of Rome in the mid-3rd century who is said to have been chosen as Pope after a dove descended upon his head, marking him as the choice of the Holy Spirit.\n\nFabian was born to a noble Roman family although little else is known about his background.\n\nFollowing the short reign of Pope Anterus, Fabian came to Rome when the new papal election began. While many names were being considered, a dove suddenly descended upon the head of Fabian, a sign to the electors that he was a man of dignity. He was at once proclaimed Bishop of Rome.\n\nDuring his 14 year reign, he ensured the return of the bodies of many martyrs from Sardinia, who had died in hard labour in the mines. He also initiated considerable work on the catacombs, where honoured Christians were interred.\n\nDuring his papacy, he also split Rome into seven districts, each supervised by a deacon.\n\nWhen Emperor Decius ascended the throne, Roman’s tolerance towards Christianity temporarily ended and he ordered everyone in the Empire to demonstrate loyalty to Rome by offering incense to deities representative of the Roman state.\n\nMany Christians, including Fabian, refused and were imprisoned or were martyred. Fabian was martyred in 250, at the beginning of the Decian persecutions.\n\nJanuary 20 – St Sebastian\n\nJanuary 20 is the feast day of Saint Sebastian, an early Christian martyr who was killed during the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians, after initially surviving an execution attempt.\n\nAccording to tradition, Sebastian was from Gallia Narbonensis, who was educated in Milan. He entered the army in Rome in 283 to assist the martyrs and became one of the captains of the Praetorian Guards, unaware he was a Christian.\n\nWhen two twin brothers, Marcus and Marcellianus, who were both deacons, refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods and were put in prison, Sebastian succeeded in converting the son of the local prefect, Saint Tiburtius, to Christianity.\n\nAnother local official, Nicostratus, and his wife Zoe, also converted because of Sebastian. While Zoe had been mute for six years, upon her conversion, her speech returned to her. When the local prefect also converted, he set all the prisoners alongside Marcus and Marcellianus free and resigned.\n\nSebastian’s faith became known in 286 and he was reproached for his supposed betrayal of the Romans. He was bound to a stake and shot at with many arrows but they did not kill him. He was nursed back to health.\n\nHe went on to publicly harangue Diocletian for his cruelties against Christians. Diocletian gave orders he be beaten to death. After his death, his body was thrown in the sewer.\n\nAfter appearing to a lady named Lucina, Sebastian’s body was retreated and buried in the catacombs, where the Basilica of St Sebastian now stands. In medieval Christianity, he became strongly associated with defense against the plague and it was believed his intercession could help protect people.\n\nJanuary 21 – St Agnes\n\nJanuary 21 is the feast day of Saint Agnes, a 4th century virgin martyr who was killed when she was just 12 years old.\n\nBorn into a noble Roman family in 291, she was said to be very beautiful and had many suitors of high rank. She was devoted to religious purity however and had submitted her name to the pagan authorities as a follower of Christianity.\n\nThe Prefect Sempronius condemned her and ordered her to be dragged naked through the streets to a brothel. As she prayed, her hair grew and completely covered her body. All men who attempted to engage her against her will were struck blind.\n\nWhen the prefect’s son was struck dead, Agnes prayed for him, reviving him and causing her to be released by the prefect. A trial commenced against her however, even as Sempronius recused himself.\n\nShe was led out and bound to a stake. When the wood below her would not burn, she was beheaded.\n\nThe daughter of Constantine I, Constantina, was said to have been cured of leprosy after praying at Agnes' tomb.\n\nShe was venerated as a saint within decades of her death. She is a patron saint of girls, chastity, virgins, victims of sex abuse, and gardeners.\n\nJanuary 24 – St Francis de Sales\n\nJanuary 24 is the feast day of Saint Francis de Sales, a 17th century bishop who was revered for his deep faith and gentle approach to religious divisions during the Protestant Reformation.\n\nFrancis was born into a noble family, in what is today Thorens-Glières, Haute-Savoie, France in 1567. As the oldest of six sons, his father wanted him to attend the best schools to prepare him for a career as a magistrate. He enjoyed a privileged education, including at the Capuchin college in Annecy.\n\nIn 1578, he went to the Collège de Clermont to study rhetoric and humanities. In 1586, he attended a theological discussion about predestination, convincing him he was damned to hell, and a personal crisis resulted.\n\nAt the end of the year, he decided to consecrate himself to the Blessed Virgin Mary, dedicate his life to God with a vow of chastity and become a tertiary of the Minim Order.\n\nHe enrolled at the University of Padua in Italy, studying law and theology. After receiving his doctorate, he decided to become a priest, making a pilgrimage to Loreto, Italy and then returning home to Savoy.\n\nHis father secured him an appointment as a senator and chose a wealthy noble heiress for his bride, but Francis refused to marry and stayed the course for the priesthood. He was ordained in 1593.\n\nIn 1599, he became coadjutor bishop of Geneva. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Henry IV of France to negotiate the restoration of Catholic worship in Gex.\n\nHe became Bishop of Geneva in 1602 and became known for his efficient organization, zealous clergy and well-instructed laity. He resided outside the diocese though, because Geneva remained under Calvinist control. In Evian, he had a vision of St Francis of Assisi who said, despite his desire to, he would not achieve martyrdom.\n\nFrancis gained a reputation as a spellbinding preaching, and his goodness, patience and mildness become proverbial.\n\nHe died in 1622, suffering a stroke while traveling in the entourage of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.\n\nJanuary 25 – The Conversion of St Paul\n\nJanuary 25 is the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul, commemorating the Pauline conversion on the road to Damascus which led him to stop persecuting Christians and follow Jesus.\n\nThe story is recounted in the Acts of the Apostles:\n\nAs he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\"\n\n\"Who are you, Lord?\" Saul asked.\n\n\"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,\" he replied. \"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\"\n\nThe men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. Paul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.\n\nThe feast is an opportunity to reflect on the conversion experience of every Christian, both big and small.\n\nJanuary 27 – Sts Timothy and Titus\n\nJanuary 27 is the feast of Saints Timothy and Titus, close companions of St Paul the Apostle and bishops in the early Church.\n\nWhile both men lived very different lives, they are commemorated in a joint feast, noting their readiness to take on various offices despite being in difficult circumstances.\n\nTimothy was a student of Sacred Scripture from his youth and joined Paul after the apostle visited his home region of Lycaonia. After Paul was forced to leave the city of Berea, Timothy remained to help the local church. He would travel with Paul on and off for the next few years.\n\nHe endured a period of imprisonment for his missionary work. He endured martyrdom in 93 after taking a stand against the worship of idols, leading him to be killed by a mob.\n\nTitus was born into a pagan family but began reading the Hebrew Scriptures following a prophetic dream. He journeyed to Jerusalem and witnessed the preaching of Christ but only later received baptism from Paul.\n\nTitus became Paul’s assistant and interpreter, accompanying him to the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem in 51. He was ordained Bishop of Crete after Paul’s first period of imprisonment. He led the Church of Crete well into his 90s, dying peacefully of old age.\n\nBoth men were fundamental to the expansion of the early Church despite facing threats of martyrdom and imprisonment for their preaching and leadership.\n\nJanuary 31 – St John Bosco\n\nJanuary 31 is the feast day of Saint John “Don” Bosco, a 19th century Italian priest, writer and educator, who founded the Salesians of Don Bosco religious order.\n\nBorn in Becchi, Italy in 1815, Bosco was the youngest son of two farmhands. His father died when he was little more than two years old and his mother was left to support three young boys.\n\nThe poverty of his family prevented any serious attempt at schooling, and he spent his early years as a shepherd. He received his first instruction from Don Calosso, who was impressed by young Bosco’s memory and understanding of the homilies at the local church.\n\nHe left home at 12 because of repeated quarrelling with his brother, ending up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia. In 1830, he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified his natural talent and supported his first schooling. His money raised enough money to finance his education and in 1835, he entered the seminary at Chieri. He was ordained in 1841 by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.\n\nFollowing his ordination, he went to Turin with Cafasso, a city which had suffered the effects of industrialisation and urbanisation. While visiting the prisons with Cafasso, he became concerned with the recidivism of the young offenders. He began to work with orphaned and abandoned boys, teaching them catechism and finding them work.\n\nHe received an appointment as almoner of the Rifugio (Refuge), a girls' boarding school founded in Turin by the Marchioness Giulia di Barolo, so that he could remain in Turin. Serving and educating the poor boys of the city became his permanent occupation.\n\nHe began to open several schools to educate young boys who were poor, orphaned or abandoned. As his ministry went on, many of the boys he had helped decided to join him in working in the service of other abandoned boys. In 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians, and one high school boy and formed them into the \"Society of St. Francis de Sales\". He then founded a group of religious sisters to help out abandoned girls. They were called the \"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians\".\n\nIn 1874, he founded yet another group, the \"Salesian Cooperators\", who mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians but would not join a religious order.\n\nThe order expanded rapidly into France and Argentina, before gradually expanding further into Austria, Britain, Spain and South American countries over the next few years.\n\nBosco passed away in early 1888 and his funeral was attended by thousands. He was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and canonised on Easter Sunday in 1934.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nFebruary 2 – Presentation of the Lord\n\nFebruary 2 is the feast of the Presentation of the Lord, commemorating the presentation of Jesus at the Temple of Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke, Mary and Joseph took the infant Jesus to the Temple forty days after his birth to complete Mary’s ritual purification after childbirth.\n\nWhen they entered the temple, they encountered Simeon, who promised that “he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ”. He then prophesied: “Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.”\n\nThe feast of the Presentation was celebrated as early as the 4th century. It is celebrated forty days after Christmas.\n\nFebruary 3 – St Ansgar\n\nFebruary 3 is the feast day of Saint Ansgar, the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen during the 9th century who became known as the Apostle of the North because of his travels and missionary mandate to Northern Europe.\n\nAnsgar was born into a noble Frankish family in Amiens. His mother died when he was young, and he was raised in a Benedictine monastery. He is said to have learned in a vision that his mother was in the company of Mary, mother of Jesus, and this became his motivator in life.\n\nIn 822, Ansgar became one of many missionaries sent to found the abbey of Corvey in Westphalia, where he became a teacher and preacher. A group of monks, including Ansgar, were sent further north to Jutland.\n\nIn 829, the Swedish king Björn at Hauge requested missionaries for his Swedes and Ansgar was sent. He preached and made converts. In 831, he was returned to King Louis’ court at Worms and appointed Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. He was given the mission of evangelising pagan Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\nAfter Louis the Pious died in 840, Ansgar lost his abbey in Turholt and in 845, the Danes raided Hamburg where he had founded a school and monastery. Ansgar was forced to relocate in Bremen in 848.\n\nHe continued his northern missions and he established good relationships following the Danish civil war. He was able to build a church in Sleswick, north of Hamburg in recognition of Christianity being a tolerated religion.\n\nAnsgar passed away and was buried in Bremen in 865. Pope Nicholas I declared Ansgar a saint shortly after his death.\n\nFebruary 3 – St Blaise\n\nFebruary 3 is the feast day of Saint Blaise, a 4th century bishop and physician, who was martyred for his faith.\n\nLittle is known about his life, but he was a doctor in Sebaste in Armenia who was chosen to succeed the Bishop after his death. As Bishop, he instructed people as much by his example as by his words. He would cure many people of their bodily and spiritual ailments.\n\nIn 316, the governor of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia, Agricolaus, began a persecution of Christians at the order of the Emperor Linicius and Blaise was seized. He was interrogated, scourged, placed in prison and then beheaded.\n\nDevotions to Blaise became particularly popular during the Middle Ages.\n\nFebruary 6 – St Paul Miki\n\nFebruary 6 is the feast day of Saint Paul Miki, a 16th century Japanese Jesuit who was one of the 26 Martyrs of Japan.\n\nPaul was born into a wealthy Japanese family in 1562 and educated by the Jesuits. He joined the Jesuits and became a well known and successful preacher, converting several people to Catholicism.\n\nThe ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, began persecuting Christians amid fear of rising Jesuit influence. Paul was arrested and jailed along with several other Catholics, who were forced to march 1,000 kilometres from Kyoto to Nagasaki.\n\nPaul had his chest pierced with a lance while tied to a cross in 1597. His last sermon was preached from the cross, where he forgave his executioners.\n\nThere were 25 other Catholic clergy and laity martyred alongside him. All 26 were canonised by Pope Pius IX in 1862.\n\nFebruary 8 – St Gerolamo Emiliani\n\nFebruary 8 is the feast day of Saint Gerolamo Emiliani, a 16th century Italian humanitarian and founder of the Somaschi Fathers.\n\nBorn in Venice in 1486, he ran away at 15 to join the army following the death of his father. He participated in the defense of Castelnuovo against the League of Cambray and was appointed governor of a fortress in the mountains of Treviso. While defending his post, he was taken prisoner.\n\nHe escaped and despite not caring about God prior, he attributed his escape to the intercession of the Mother of God, and made a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Treviso. He was appointed magistrate of Castelnuovo di Quero but returned to Venice to supervise the education of his nephews. He spent most of his spare time devoted to studying and works of charity.\n\nHe began caring for the hungry and the sick, and showed a great zeal to look after others, particularly those orphaned by plague and famine. He helped build hospitals, erect orphanages and founded hostels for repentant prostitutes.\n\nWhile he remained a layman his whole life, wit the assistance of two priests, Gerolamo founded a religious society, Congregation of Regular Clerics, known as the Somascans. The principal work of the order was the care of orphans, poor and sick, and he demanded that dwellings, food and clothing would bear the mark of religious poverty. The congregation was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.\n\nDuring an epidemic, Gerolamo contracted the plague while assisting the sick. He died in Somasca in 1537.\n\nHe was beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in 1747 and canonised by Pope Clement XIII in 1767.\n\nFebruary 8 – St Josephine Bakhita\n\nFebruary 8 is the feast day of Saint Josephine Bakhita, a 20th century Sudanese-Italian who survived slavery to become a Canossian religious sister.\n\nBorn around 1869 in Darfur in Sudan, her father was the brother of the village chief, living a happy and carefree life. In 1877, she was seized by Arab slave traders who had abducted her older sister two years earlier. She was sold and bought by numerous owners over the next 12 years, during which she was forced to convert to Islam.\n\nIn 1884, an Italian man by the name of Augusto Michieli helped her escape from Sudan to go to Italy and her ownership was given to his wife. She became nanny to the family’s daughter Alice. When Michieli planned to return to Sudan, he left Bakhita in the care of the Canossian Sisters in Venice. There, she encountered Christianity for the first time.\n\nWhen Michieli returned to come and take her, Bakhita refused to leave. When the matter went to the courts, they deemed Bakhita had never legally been a slave. She chose to remain with the Canossians and was baptised in 1890. On the same day, she was also confirmed and received Holy Communion from Archbishop Giuseppe Sarto, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice and later Pope Pius X.\n\nIn 1893, she entered the novitiate for the Canossion sisters and took her vows in 1896. In 1902, she was sent to the Canossion convent in Schio, in Vicenza, where she spent the rest of her life. During her 42 years as a sister, she worked as a cook, sacristan and doorkeeper. He became known for her special charisma and sanctity.\n\nEven in her last years, when she was forced into a wheelchair, she retained her cheerfulness. She died in 1947. He body lay in repose for three days following her death and thousands came to pay their respects.\n\nPetitions for her canonisation began immediately and she was declared venerable in 1978 by Pope John Paul II. She was canonised in 2000.\n\nFebruary 10 – St Scholastica\n\nFebruary 10 is the feast day of Saint Scholastica, a 6th century religious sister who is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Benedictine nuns.\n\nScholastica was born in 480 in Nursia, Umbria, in modern-day Italy, to wealthy parents. She was the twin sister of St Benedict of Nursia. From a young age, she was dedicated to God, brought up alongside her brother before he left to pursue studies in Rome.\n\nScholastica established a hermitage outside Monte Cassino and this became the first convent of Benedictine nuns.\n\nOnce a year, she would go and visit her brother at a place near his abbey and the pair would spend the day worshiping, and discussing sacred texts and issues.\n\nOne night, after supper, when Benedict indicated it was time for him to return to his cell. When Scholastica asked him to stay, sensing her death was near, he refused. Scholastica closed her hands in prayer and a great storm appeared outside the guest house they were in, meaning Benedict was unable to return to his monastery and the pair spent the night in discussion.\n\nThree days later, Benedict saw his sister’s soul leave the earth and ascend to heaven in the form of a white dove.\n\nFebruary 11 – Our Lady of Lourdes\n\nFebruary 11 is the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes, commemorating the Marian apparition of the Blessed Virgin May to St Bernadette in Lourdes in 1858.\n\nIn 1858, Bernadette, her sister Toinette and neighbour Jeanne, went to collect some firwood. As Bernadette came close to a grotto, she heard a gust of wind and turned her head to look at the grotto, and saw a lady dress in white. Following several other appearances over several days, the lady revealed herself to be the Immaculate Conception.\n\nThe visions were verified by the local bishop in 1862. Pope Pius IX approved the veneration in Lourdes and supported the building of a Cathedral on the site in 1870. In 1907, Pope Pius X introduced the feast of the apparition of the Immaculate Virgin of Lourdes.\n\nThe water at the site has become known for its healing properties and Lourdes is now a major pilgrimage site. Bernadette was canonised by Pope Pius XI in 1933.\n\nFebruary 14 – St Cyril and St Methodius\n\nFebruary 14 is the feast day of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, two brothers and theologians from the 9th century.\n\nThe brothers were born in Thessaloncia, in moder-day Greece, in the early 9th century. Cyril was born Constantine but was given the name Cyril upon becoming a monk, shortly before his death. Methodius was born Michael and was also given the name Methodius upon becoming a monk.\n\nThe brothers lost their father when Cyril was 14. Cyril would become a teacher at the University of Magnaura. He was ordained some time after his education while Methodius would remain a deacon until later in life.\n\nIn 860, Byzantine Emperor Michael III and the Patriarch of Constantinople Photius sent Cyril on a missionary expedition to the Khazars who had requested a scholar be sent to them. Methodius accompanied Cyril on the mission. After returning home, Cyril became professor of philosophy at the University while Methodius had become a significant figure in Byzantine affairs, and an abbot of his monastery.\n\nIn 862, the brothers were sent on mission to Great Moravia (in modern-day eastern Europe). They translated the Gospels into the local language and traveled to Great Moravia to promote it. They also helped to develop a specifically Slavic liturgy.\n\nAfter having success in Great Moravia, they encountered other missionaries who were opposed to a specific Slavic liturgy and language. The brothers traveled to Rome to seek a resolution. Pope Adrian II gave Methodius the title of Archbishop of Sirmium in 869, giving him jurisdiction over Moravia and Pannonia, and authorized him to use the Slavonic liturgy.\n\nFeeling his end approaching, Cyril became a Basilian monk and died in Rome fifty days later. Methodius continued his work among the Slavs alone. East Frankish rulers and their bishops wanted to remove him however and he was captured and kept prisoner. Rome declared Methodius should be released and his enemies be punished.\n\nHe continued his mission for the rest of his life, until his death in 885. The efforts of Cyril and Methodius paved the way for the spready of Christianity through Eastern Europe.\n\nFebruary 17 – Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order\n\nFebruary 17 is the feast of the Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order, commemorating seven men from Florence who became bound to each other in a spiritual friendship that were eventually called by the Virgin Mother of God in a vision that they reportedly all shared in one and the same moment.\n\nThe group of men became united through the Laudesi, a pious confraternity of the Blessed Virgin. All the men saw an apparition of the Mother of God in 1233. Afterwards, they founded the Order of the Servites.\n\nAll seven withdrew to Monte Scenario, a mountain outside the city of Florence, for a life of poverty and penance.\n\nThe members of the order dedicated themselves to Mary under her title of Mother of Sorrows. Dedicating their devotion to the mother of Jesus, they adopted Mary's virtues of hospitality and compassion as the order's hallmarks. The distinctive spirit of the order is the sanctification of its members by meditation on the Passion of Jesus and the Sorrows of the Virgin Mary, and spreading abroad this devotion.\n\nPope Leo XIII canonised all seven of the men in 1888. After the canonisation, their feast day was inserted into the General Roman Calendar.\n\nFebruary 20 – St Peter Damian\n\nFebruary 20 is the feast day of Saint Peter Damian, a reforming Benedictine monk and Doctor of the Church who lived in the 11th century.\n\nPeter was born in Ravenna in 1007, to a large but poor noble family. He was orphaned at an early age and adopted by an older brother, who treated him poorly. After some years, another of his brothers, Damianus, who was archpriest at Ravenna, had pity on him and took him to be educated.\n\nHe made rapid progress in his studies of theology and canon law, so much so, that by the time he was 25, he was already a famous teacher in both Parma and Ravenna. In 1035, he gave up secular life and entered the isolated hermitage of Fonte Avellana, near Gubbio.\n\nDuring his time in the monastery, his fervour led him to extremes of self-mortification as penance however it affected his health. After recovering, he was appointed to lecture his fellow monks.\n\nIn 1042, he was appointed economus of the house by the prior and a year later, became prior of Fonte Avellana and remained so until his death in 1072.\n\nAs prior, he introduced a more severe discipline, which included the practice of flagellation. He also introduced a daily siesta to make up for the fatigue of the night office.\n\nHe spent time criticising several wicked bishops and doctrinal ignorance in the hierarchy of the Church at the time. Following the death of Pope Leo IX, Frederic, abbot of Monte Cassino, was elected Pope Stephen IX. Stephen determined to make Peter a cardinal but was forced to finally accept in 1057.\n\nHe was appointed administrator of the Diocese of Gubbio and impressed with the great responsibilities of his office. When Pope Stephen died and the church schismed, Peter became a vigorous opponent of antipope Benedict X, forcing Peter to retire temporarily to Fonte Avallana.\n\nWhen Pope Nicholas II was appointed, he sent Peter as legate to Milan to help correct the poor state of the clergy in the city. He helped to reform the state of the clergy in the city. He would later help Pope Alexander II in his struggle with antipope Honorius II.\n\nIn 1067, he was allowed to resign his bishopric. After a period of retirement, he served as papal legate to Germany in 1069 and persuaded the emperor Henry IV to give up his intention to divorce his wife.\n\nIn 1072, he was sent to Ravenna but once there, he caught a fever and lay ill for a week in the local monastery. On the night preceding the feast of the Chair of St Peter at Antioch, he ordered the office of the feast be recited and at the end of the Lauds, he died.\n\nPeter was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XII in 1828.\n\nFebruary 23 – St Polycarp\n\nFebruary 23 is the feast day of Saint Polycarp, a 2nd century Bishop who was martyred for his faith.\n\nPolycarp was a Syrian who met with many of the apostles and was a correspondent of Ignatius of Antioch.\n\nPolycarp was converted to Christianity by the apostles and was consecrated a presbyter. Irenaeus recounted how he had in turn converted to Christianity after hearing Polycarp preach.\n\nWhen his fellow Syrian, Pope Anicetus, was Bishop of Rome, Polycarp went to Rome to discuss the different practices of the churches of Asia and Rome. Anicetus allowed the Asian and Roman churches to practice their own observances for Easter, and allowed Polycarp to celebrate the Eucharist in his own church, which was regarded by many Romans as a great honour.\n\nPolycarp’s writings are among the earliest in Christian history and give valuable insight into soteriology, scripture, eschatology and the structure of the early Church.\n\nWell into his old age, Polycarp was burned at the stake and pierced with a spear for refusing to burn incense to the Roman emperor.\n\nFebruary 27 – St Gregory of Narek\n\nFebruary 27 is the feast day of Saint Gregory of Narek, a 10th century Armenian mystic, poet, monk, theologian and Doctor of the Church.\n\nGregory was born circa 945 to 951 and lived in the Armenian Kingdom of Vaspurakan. He was born in a village on the southern shores of Lake Van, and his father was ordained a bishop after being widowed.\n\nGregory was sent to Narekavank where he was given religious education. He was ordained a priest in 977 and taught theology at the school until his death.\n\nHe was a prolific writer. The Book of Lamentations is considered to be his masterpiece and was popular among Armenian Christians for centuries. He also wrote many poems, hymns, homilies and prayers, which are still used in Armenian Churches today.\n\nWhen he died, around the year 1010, he was buried inside the walls of the monastery, which survived until the mid-20th century until it was abandoned due to the Armenian genocide, destroyed by Turkish authorities and replaced with a mosque.\n\nThe exact date of canonisation is not known but he was already recognised as a saint by 1173.\n\nMARCH\n\nMarch 4 – St Casimir\n\nMarch 4 is the feast day of Saint Casimir, a 15th century prince of the Kingdom of Poland who was known for his piety and generosity.\n\nCasimir was born in Wawel Castle in Krakow in 458, the third child of the King of Poland.

Casimir was educated by the Polish priest Fr Jan Długosz, and knew Lithuanian, Polish, German and Latin.\n\nWith trouble in the neighbouring kingdom of Hungary and Bohemia, Casimir’s father decided to install him as the King of Hungary. The pair led a military campaign into the country but were forced to retreat and had to deal with disease and food shortages. The campaign ultimately failed.\n\nUpon returning he began to gain a reputation for his piety. He would refuse to have sexual relations with a woman, contracted a lung disease from fasting and would often be found kneeling before the church gates in the morning, waiting for a priest to open them.\n\nHis father tried to arrange a marriage for him around 1480 but he refused, preferring to remain celibate.\n\nJust a few months after his 25th birthday, his health began to deteriorate and he died in 1484.

His family had once been prominent but were now impoverished, but had great religious faith. When he was 8, he disappeared from his home.\n\nHe found himself a homeless orphan in Spain. He was taken in by a man and settled down as a shepherd. The man was so taken by John’s strength and diligence he wanted him to marry his daughter. To escape this well-meant but persistent offer, John joined a company of company of foot-solders.\n\nWhile serving with them, he was asked to guard an enormous amount of loot, much of which had been rifled with by the time he was relieved. Suspicion fell on him and he was condemned to death before a tolerant officer intervened to pardon him.\n\nHe returned to the farm for four years before once again joining some troops on their way to fight in Hungary against the Turks. For the next 18 years, he served as a trooper in various parts of Europe.\n\nAfter his service, he once again found work herding sheep but began to realise his occupation no longer satisfied him and he felt a desire to see Africa and help free the enslaved Christians there.

John promised to care for the family, nursing them and finding work to provide food to them.\n\nHe decided to return to Spain, feeling God’s call for him was not in Africa. He had a vision of the Infant Jesus who bestowed on him the name John of God. He had a major spiritual conversion while listening to a sermon by St John of Avila, who encouraged him to improve the life of the poor. He also experienced a vision of Mary, who encouraged him to also work with the poor.\n\nJohn spent all his energy caring for the neediest people in the city. He was largely alone in his charitable work at first, but began to receive support from clergy and physicians. The local bishop had a religious habit made for him and imposed on him for all time, the name John of God.\n\nHe slowly drew in a circle of disciples who joined him in his service. He organised them into the Order of Hospitallers, approved by the Holy See in 1572, dedicated to the service of the sick and the poor.\n\nJohn died in 1550, on his 55th birthday, in Granada. He had suffered from pneumonia after plunging into a river to save a young man from drowning.\n\nHe was canonised by Pope Alexander VIII in 1690 and named the patron saint of hospitals and the sick.\n\nMarch 9 – St Frances of Rome\n\nMarch 9 is the feast day of Saint Frances of Rome, a 15th century Italian mystic and organiser of charitable services.\n\nFrances was born in 1384 in Rome to a wealthy, aristocratic couple and christened shortly after. When she was 11, she wanted to be a nun but her parents forced her to marry a Roman trooper when she was 12.\n\nThe marriage lasted for forty years and despite being arranged, was a happy one. With her sister-in-law, she would regularly visit the poor and take care of the sick, inspiring many other wealthy women in the city to do the same.\n\nShe became mistress of the household when her mother-in-law died and she turned the family’s country estate into a hospital. During her marriage, she suffered many sorrows, losing two children to plague and being forced to deliver her son as a hostage.

They were not cloistered or bound by formal vows. In 1433, she founded a monastery to allow for a common life by those members of the confraternity who felt inclined.\n\nFrances remained in her own home, nursing her husband for the last seven years of his life.

He developed spiritually during his time in captivity. He strengthened his relationship with God and it led him to convert to Christianity.\n\nHe managed to flee his captures after six years and traveled 200 miles to port where he found a ship and convinced the captain to take him to Britain.

He refused to accept gifts for his work and was legally without protection as a foreigner.\n\nMany legends are associated with Patrick, including that he taught about the Holy Trinity using a shamrock and that he banished the snakes from Ireland.\n\nThe time of his death is not known due to the limited writings from the time. While Patrick was never formally canonised but he is still declared a saint and is widely venerated, particularly in Ireland.\n\nMarch 18 – St Cyril of Jerusalem\n\nMarch 18 is the feast day of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, a 4th century theologian and bishop of the early Church.\n\nLittle is known about his life prior to becoming a bishop although its believed he may have been born around 315, near the city of Jerusalem.\n\nHe was ordained a deacon by Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem in 335 and a priest some eight years later by Bishop Maximus. In 350, he succeeded Maximus as the Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\nAs Bishop, he faced several attacks and accusations, mainly from Acacius, a leading Arian of the time. He accused Cyril of selling church property, when Cyril had secretly sold sacramental ornaments and valuable robes to help feel the starving people of Jerusalem.\n\nCyril resisted Acacius’ summons to account for his actions. Acacius used a church council to depose Cyril in his absence and Cyril was forced to take refuge with the Bishop of Tarsus. In 359, the Council of Seleucia reinstated Cyril and depose Acacius. This was then reversed by Emperor Constantius in 360 and Cyril was exiled for a year before he was allowed to return.\n\nHe was once again banished by the Arian Emperor Valens in 367 but was able to return when Valens died in 378 and remained there until his death in 386.\n\nHe left important writings documenting the instruction of catechumens and the order of the Liturgy of his day.

Upon Herod’s death, an angel tells Joseph to return but avoid Herod’s son. He takes Jesus and Mary to settle in Galilee.\n\nHe is last mentioned in the Gospels in the narrative of the Passover visit to the Temple in Jerusalem, when Jesus was 12 years old. According to tradition, Mary was a widow during the adult ministry of Jesus.\n\nDespite having only, a limited role in the Gospels, his role in raising Jesus was of vital importance. Thomas Aquinas discussed the necessity of his presence in the plan of the Incarnation, saying she would have been stoned if she had become pregnant without being married, and Jesus needed the care and protection of a human father during his youth.\n\nIn 1847, Pope Pius IX declared Joseph to be the Universal Patron and Protector of the Catholic Church.\n\nSaint Joseph’s Day, his principal feast day, has been celebrated since the 10th century. The feast of Saint Joseph the Worker is celebrated on May 1.\n\nMarch 23 – St Turibius of Mogrovejo\n\nMarch 23 is the feast day of Saint Turibius of Mogrovejo, a 16th century Archbishop who helped to lead reform in the education of priests and was a key member of the Inquisition.\n\nTuribius was born in 1538 in Valladolid, Spain, to noble parents. As a child, he was pious and had a strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He fasted once a week and recited rosaries often. He began to study humanities in 1550.\n\nHe became a professor, teaching law to students in Salamanca. He gained a reputation for he piety and knowledge and was appointed Grand Inquisitor on the Inquisition Court stationed at Granada in February 1571 by King Philip II.\n\nIn 1576, King Philip II nominated him for the vacant Lima archbishopric, despite the strong protests of Turibius.

In 1580, he departed for Peru.\n\nWhen he arrived in Peru, he began his mission by baptising and teaching many of the natives. He traversed his entire archdiocese three times on foot, exposed to tempests, torrents, wild beasts, hostile tribes and fevers. While there, he baptised and confirmed almost a half a million people, including Rose of Lima, Martin de Porres, Francis Solano, and Juan Masías, all who were canonised.\n\nHe helped to build roads, schoolhouses, chapels, hospitals and convents. In 1591, he founded the first seminary in the Western Hemisphere. He was seen as a champion of the rights of the natives against the Spanish masters, and made a point of learning the local dialects.\n\nHe helped to reform diocesan priests, some of whom had been involved in scandal. He also worked to implement the decrees from the Council of Trent and made evangelisation a core part of his ministry.\n\nHe predicted the exact date and hour of his death. While on a pastoral visit, he contracted a fever but kept labouring. He dragged himself to receive the Eucharist once last time at the St Augustine convent and died not long after, on Holy Thursday.\n\nHe was beatified by Pope Innocent XI in 1679 and canonised by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726.\n\nMarch 25 – Feast of the Annunciation\n\nMarch 25 is the Feast of the Annunciation, commemorating the announcement by the archangel Gabriel to Mary, that she would conceive the Son of God.\n\nArchangel Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her she would conceive and bear a son through virgin birth and become the mother of Jesus Christ, marking the incarnation. Gabriel told her she would name the child Immanuel, meaning “God is with us”.\n\nThe feast was first celebrated as early as the 6th century, making the beginning of the new year. By 656, the feast was being celebrated throughout the Church.\n\nWhen the feast falls on a Sunday or during Holy Week, it is moved to a different date.\n\nMAY\n\nThe month of May is dedicated to Our Blessed Lady, the Blessed Virgin, Queen of Heaven and Mother of the Church. The pious practice of honouring Mary during May has been especially recommended by the Popes. Parishes often have a daily recitation of the Rosary during May and crown the statue of Mary with beautiful flowers representing Mary’s beauty and virtue. It is also a reminder to strive to imitate Mary’s beauty and virtue.\n\nRead More\n\nMay 1 – St Joseph the Worker\n\nMay 1 is the feast day of Saint Joseph the Worker, reflecting his status as a carpenter and patron of workers.\n\nWhile Saint Joseph has his principal feast day on March 19, the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker was introduced by Pope Pius XII in 1955 as an ecclesiastical counterpart to International Workers Day, also held on May 1.\n\nSaint Joseph was the foster father of Jesus and is held up by the Church as a model of the holiness of human labour. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is referred to as “the carpenter’s son”.\n\nPope Pius XII said Saint Joseph was a model of holiness to all workers.\n\n“The spirit flows to you and to all men from the heart of the God-man, Savior of the world, but certainly, no worker was ever more completely and profoundly penetrated by it than the foster father of Jesus, who lived with Him in closest intimacy and community of family life and work,” he said.\n\nThe feast day was established to both honour Saint Joseph and to make people aware of the dignity of human work, which has long been celebrated as a participation in the creative work of God.\n\nPope John Paul II wrote in his encyclical Laborem Exercens: “the Church considers it her task always to call attention to the dignity and rights of those who work, to condemn situations in which that dignity and those rights are violated, and to help to guide [social] changes so as to ensure authentic progress by man and society.”\n\nRead More\n\nMay 3 – St Philip the Apostle\n\nMay 3 is the feast day of Saint Philip the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus who was martyred for evangelising following the Ascension.\n\nSaint Philip was from the city of Bethsaida and was among those surrounding John the Baptist when Jesus was pointed out as the Lamb of God.\n\nHe features prominently in the Gospel of John. He was asked by Jesus how to feed the 5,000 people, and acts as a conduit between the Greek community and Jesus. He also asks Jesus at the last supper to explain the unity of the Father and Son.\n\nFollowing Jesus’ Ascension, Saint Philip became a missionary, preaching with his sister Mariamne and Bartholomew in Greece, Syria and Phrygia.\n\nHe was martyred in the city of Hierapolis after converting the wife of the proconsul of the city, angering the husband who had him tortured and killed.\n\nRelics of Saint Philip are in the crypt of Basilica Santi Apostoli in Rome along with Saint James, another of the Twelve Apostles, who was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I of Judaea.\n\nRead More\n\nMay 14 – St Matthias the Apostle\n\nMay 14 is the feast day of Saint Matthias the Apostle, who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot following his betrayal of Jesus and subsequent death.\n\nWhile he is not mentioned in the Gospels, according to the Acts of the Apostles, he had been with Jesus from the time of his baptism by John the Baptist, through to his Ascension.\n\nFollowing the Ascension, the Apostles asked the 120 disciples that had followed them to nominate two men to replace Judas. Matthias was nominated alongside Joseph Barsabbas. After praying, they cast lots and the lot fell to Matthias, so he was numbered with the 11 Apostles.\n\nHe went on to preach the Gospel and plant the faith in Turkey, Ethiopia and Georgia. He was martyred by crucifixion for his ministry.\n\nIt’s believed St Matthias’ remains were brought to Italy through the Empress Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine I. Part of the relics were buried in the Abbey of Santa Giustina, Padua, and the remaining in the Abbey of St. Matthias, Trier, Germany.\n\nMay 26 – Feast of the Ascension\n\nMay 26 is the Feast of the Ascension, commemorating Jesus’ ascent into Heaven, completing his redemptive mission on Earth.\n\nThe Ascension is commemorated on the fortieth day of Easter, reflecting Jesus’ ascent on the fortieth day from his resurrection.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke, on that day, Jesus led the eleven remaining disciples to the Mount of Olives and instructed them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAfter blessing them, he parted them and was carried up to heaven, to sit at the right hand of the Father.\n\nThe Ascension has been commemorated since the very beginning of the Church, and ranks with the feasts of the Passion, Easter and Pentecost.\n\nMay 31 – Visitation\n\nMay 31 is the Feast of the Visitation, commemorating the visit of Mary, pregnant with Jesus, to Elizabeth, pregnant with John the Baptist.\n\nThe visitation is described in the Gospel of Luke.\n\n“In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb.\n\n“And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.’”\n\nWorld Youth Day’s theme for 2023 is “Mary arose and left with haste”, describing Mary leaving to visit her sister Elizabeth after finding out she was pregnant with Jesus.\n\nThe visit is symbolic of Mary’s desire to share the good news of Jesus Christ with someone else, and Pope Francis has used this to underline his desire for World Youth Day 2023 to be a festival of evangelization.\n\nJUNE\n\nThe month of June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The term Sacred Heart is a symbol of God's boundless and passionate love for mankind. It is one of the most widely practiced devotions in the Catholic faith. Pope Leo XIII established June as a special month of devotion to the Sacred Heart.\n\nJune 1 - Justin Martyr\n\nJune 1 is the feast day of Saint Justin Martyr, an early Christian apologist who was beheaded in the second century for teaching the faith.\n\nSaint Justin was born around 100 AD to a Samaritan family and defined himself as a Gentile. In his own works, he said he searched for a belief system, studying Stoicism, Pythagoreanism and Platonism.\n\nHe then chanced upon an old Christian man who engaged him in conversation about God, telling him of the testimonies of the prophets.\n\nMoved by the man’s words, he decided to dedicate his life to the service of the Devine. His belief was bolstered by the lives of the early Christians and heroic examples of the martyrs.\n\nHe started his own school in Rome to teach the “true philosophy” of Christianity.\n\nWhile teaching, he got into a dispute with philosopher Crescens who denounced him to the authorities.\n\nHe was tried along with six of his companions, and beheaded, becoming a martyr.\n\nJune 5 – Pentecost\n\nThe 50th day after Easter is Pentecost (June 5 in 2022), commemorating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nIt is a moveable feast, meaning its date depends on the date of Easter, rather than a specific day like other feast days.\n\nThe feast occurs after the ascension of Jesus into heaven, with the descent of the Holy Spirit completing the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe story of Pentecost is recounted in the Bible in Acts 2:1-4:\n\n“When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.”\n\nJune 9 – St Ephrem\n\nJune 9 is the feast day of Saint Ephrem, a prominent Christian theologian and Doctor of the Church who lived in the 4th century.\n\nBorn in the year 306 in modern-day Turkey, Ephrem was baptised as a youth and was appointed as a deacon shortly after.

He eventually settled in Edessa and spent his late fifties apply himself to ministry in his new church, continuing his work as a teacher.\n\nDuring his lifetime, he composed hundreds of hymns, many of which still exist today.\n\nAfter spending 10 years in Edessa, he succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims, dying on 9 June 373.\n\nHe was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Benedict XV in 1920.\n\nJune 11 – St Barnabas\n\nJune 11 is the feast day of Saint Barnabas, a first century Apostolic Father who was among the most prominent Christian disciples in Jerusalem.\n\nOriginally named Joseph, he was given the name Barnabas by the Apostles, meaning “son of encouragement”.\n\nHe appears in the Book of Acts and several of Paul’s epistles, which recount he sold land he owned and gave the proceeds to the community.\n\nFollowing the conversion of Saint Paul, Barnabas introduced him to the Apostles. The pair evangelised together through the Mediterranean.\n\nDespite eventually splitting from Paul, it’s believed the two men remained good friends up until Barnabas’ death.\n\nAccording to tradition, while preaching in Syria, he was tortured and then stoned to death by some Jews in the area.\n\nJune 12 – Trinity Sunday\n\nThe first Sunday after Pentecost is commemorated as Trinity Sunday, celebrating the doctrine of the Trinity, the three persons of God: the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nIn the early Church, there was no special day assigned for the Holy Trinity although some of the faithful were already reciting the Office of the Holy Trinity, composed by Bishop Stephen of Liège in the early 10th century, the week after Pentecost.\n\nJohn XXII ordered the creation of the feast on the first Sunday after Pentecost in the 14th century and Pope Pius X raised it to the dignity of a primary of the first class in the early 20th Century.\n\nJust a week after celebrating Pentecost, the time when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus, the Church appropriately turns its attention to the whole of the Holy Trinity, recognising the gift given by each of the person.\n\nJune 13 – St Anthony of Padua\n\nJune 13 is the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua, a 13th century Catholic priest and early friar of the Franciscan Order who became a Doctor of the Church.\n\nBorn in Lisbon, Portugal as Fernando Martins de Bulhões, to a wealth and noble family, he entered the Augustinian community of Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross at the Abbey of Saint Vincent on the outskirts of Lisbon at the age of 15.\n\nHe asked to be transferred to the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Coimbra just a few years later, where he studied theology and Latin and was ordained to the priesthood.\n\nHe encountered some visiting Fransiscan friars and was strongly attracted to their simply way of life. He joined the order and adopted the name Anthony.\n\nHe set out for Morocco but became sick and was forced to return to Portugal however the ship was pushed off course and landed in Sicily.\n\nHe became well known through Italy for his preaching and teaching, coming to the attention of Francis of Assisi, the founder of his order. The two shared a bond and Anthony was assigned to provide teaching to members of the order.\n\nAnthony traveled to see Pope Gregory in 1228 and was hailed as a \"jewel case of the Bible\" by the papal court.\n\nIn 1231, he became sick with ergotism and died shortly after at the age of 35 in Padua. He was canonised as a saint within a year of his death and was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1946 by Pope Pius XII.\n\nJune 16 – Corpus Christi\n\nThe Thursday after Trinity Sunday is celebrated as the Feast of Corpus Christi, also called the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nThe feast celebrates the institution of the Blessed Sacrament, or Holy Communion, and proclaims the truth of the transubstantiation of bread and wine into the actual body of Christ during Mass or the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nThe feast of Corpus Christi originated in 1246 when the Bishop of Liege (in present day Belgium) ordered the festival be celebrated in his Diocese after being persuaded by a young prioress who had experienced a vision. This woman, Juliana of Mount Cornillon, would be officially recognised as a saint by Pope Pius IX in 1869.\n\nThe festival did not spread until Pope Urban IV ordered the whole Church to observe the feast. Shortly before Pope Urban issued his 1264 bull, St Thomas Aquinas had undertaken and completed the task of composing both the office, or official set of prayers for the Church, and the Mass for the feast.\n\nIn some parts of the liturgy today Acquinas’ work remains, in others it has been replaced. One hymn that has been excised but still remains well known, and performed, begins with the words Panis angelicus.\n\nPope Clement V proclaimed the feast universal and by the 15th century it had become one of the principal feasts in the Church.\n\nJune 22 – St Thomas More\n\nJune 22 is the feast day of Saint Thomas More, an English lawyer, judge and martyr who opposed the Protestant Reformation and was executed for opposing Henry VIII as supreme head of the Church of England.\n\nMore was born in 1478, the son of Sir John More, a successful lawyers and judge. He served the Archbishop of Canterbury as a household page from 1490 to 1492. The Archbishop nominated him for a place at the University of Oxford, where More began studying in 1492. He was called to the Bar in 1502 and became a lawyer.\n\nHe is believed to have considered abandoning his career at one point to become a monk.\n\nHe was elected to parliament in 1504 and became a secretary and personal advisor to King Henry VIII. More opposed the rising Protestant Reformation and actively worked to stop its influence growing in England.\n\nWhen King Henry VIII split from the Catholic Church, More refused to acknowledge him as supreme head of the Church of England, and did not attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as Queen of England.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for treason. He was found guilty by a jury after just fifteen minutes and was executed on 6 July 1535.\n\nPope Leo XIII beatified Thomas More, John Fisher, and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. Pope Pius XI canonised More and Fisher on 19 May 1935.\n\nJune 22 – St Paulinus of Nola\n\nJune 22 is the feast day of Saint Paulinus of Nola, a Roman poet and senator who abandoned his career and wealth to become a Christian, then later Bishop.\n\nPaulinus was born in Bordeaux, in France in 352, to a notable senatorial family.\n\nIn 375, when Emperor Gratian succeeded his father Valentinian, he made Paulinus suffect consul at Rome and appointed him governor of the southern Italian province of Campania.\n\nWhen Gratian was assassinated in 383, Paulinus went to Milan to attend the school of Ambrose before returning to Bordeaux in 384 and marrying Therasia.\n\nHe was baptised shortly after, crediting his conversion to St Felix, who was buried in Nola.\n\nWhen the couple lost their only child eight days after birth, they decided to withdraw from the world and live a secluded, religious life.\n\nIn 393, he was ordained a presbyter by Lampius, Bishop of Barcelona and moved to Nova in late spring of 395, where he remained until his death.\n\nHis wife died some time between 408 and 410, and Paulnius received episcopal ordination shortly after, becoming Bishop of Nola where he served for 20 years. He died at Nola on 22 June 431.\n\nThe renunciation of his wealth and station in favour of an ascetic and philanthropic life was held up as an example by many of his contemporaries—including SS Augustine, Jerome, Martin, and Ambrose.\n\nHe was subsequently venerated as a saint.\n\nJune 22 – St John Fisher\n\nJune 22 is the feast day of Saint John Fisher, an English Catholic bishop, cardinal and martyr who was executed by Henry VIII during the English Reformation.\n\nBorn in 1469 to a modestly prosperous merchant, he received early education in the school attached to the collegiate church in his hometown and later studied at Cambridge.\n\nHe received papal dispensation to enter the priesthood despite being under canonical age. He was appointed Bishop of Rochester in 1504 at the personal insistence of Henry VII. His reputation for preaching meant he was appointed to preach the funeral oration for both King Henry VII and the Lady Margaret.\n\nWhen King Henry VIII tried to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became her chief supporter, enraging the King. As Henry VIII’s attacks on the Church intensified, Fisher became one of its most public defenders.\n\nWhen Henry VIII went through with his marriage to Anne Boleyn, Fisher was arrested and later imprisoned. He refused to acknowledge the marriage of Henry and Anne, and refused to declare the King as Supreme Head of the Church of England.\n\nIn 1535, the newly elected Pope Paul III declared Fisher a Cardinal, however this only enraged Henry VIII further. Fisher was sentenced to death for treason and executed on 22 June 1535.\n\nIn his final moments, he retained a dignified courage, profoundly impressing those around him.\n\nHe was canonized by Pope Leo XIII with Thomas More and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886.\n\nJune 24 – St John the Baptist\n\nJune 24 is the feast day of the nativity of Saint John the Baptist, an itinerant preacher who baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.\n\nJohn was born to Zechariah, an old priest, and his wife Elizabeth, a relative of Mary, who thought they were unable to have children. His birth was foretold by the angel Gabriel.\n\nHe grew up to be a preacher, who taught about charity, baptized tax collectors and advised soldiers. He is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair and living on locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nWhen Jesus came to John, he was baptized by him in the river Jordan, after which, the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit descended.\n\nLittle is known about the rest of his life after this event.\n\nAround 30 AD, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife Phasaelis and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I.\n\nJune 24 – Sacred Heart\n\nThe third Friday after Pentecost is the feast of the Sacred Heart.\n\nThe term Sacred Heart is a symbol of God's boundless and passionate love for mankind. It is one of the most widely practiced devotions in the Catholic faith.\n\nWhile the entire month of June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus as a feast day 19 days after Pentecost.\n\nThis feast wasn’t always on the liturgical calendar. It took many centuries before it was established and spread throughout the world.\n\nSt Margaret Mary Alacoque, a French nun and mystic, received private revelations from Jesus on 16 June 1675, asking her to specifically promote a feast that honoured His Sacred Heart.\n\nThe first country to institute a liturgical feast was Poland and then in a decree from the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 23 August 1856, Pope Pius IX established the feast for the universal Church.\n\nSt John Paul II, a great devotee of the Sacred Heart, said: “This feast reminds us of the mercy of the love of God for the people of all times.”\n\nOn this feast day, the faithful are encouraged to discover the riches hidden in the Heart of Jesus that gives hope and trust and to love our neighbours.\n\nJune 27 – St Cyril of Alexandria\n\nJune 27 is the feast day of Saint Cyril of Alexandria, an early Church Father and Doctor of the Church.\n\nBorn circa 376, little is known about his early life however it appears he was well educated and received a formal Christian education standard for his day. His maternal uncle was Theophilus, the Patriarch of Alexandria from 384 to 412.\n\nIn 403, Cyril accompanied his uncle to attend the \"Synod of the Oak\" in Constantinople, which deposed John Chrysostom as Archbishop of Constantinople.\n\nWhen Theophilus died in 412, Cyril was made Patriarch of Alexandria.\n\nIn this role, he was a scholar and prolific writer, writing several exegetical documents.\n\nHe wrote extensively on the two natures of Jesus and is also noted in Church history for his fight for the title of Theotokos (God bearer) to be given to Mary and putting emphasis on her as the Mother of God.\n\nCyril is counted among the Church Fathers and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles Pillar of Faith and Seal of all the Fathers.\n\nHe was declared a Doctor of the Church on 28 July 1882 by Pope Leo XIII.\n\nJune 29 – St Paul\n\nJune 29 is the feast day of Saint Paul, one of the most prominent and prolific Christian apostles in the first century. He wrote 14 of the 27 New Testament books and founded several Christian communities across Asia Minor and Europe.\n\nThe feast day is celebrated as the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, honouring the martyrdom of both Paul and Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome.\n\nPaul was born to a devout Jewish family in Tarsus. He was given the name Saul and was sent to Jerusalem to receive his education but very little is known about his life after that.\n\nAt some point, Saul became a persecutor of Christians and even participated in the martyring of Stephen, an early deacon of the Church who is considered its first martyr.\n\nSometime after this, while traveling on the road to Damascus, he reported having a vision of Jesus who said to him: 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' He asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The reply came, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting'.\n\nPaul said he was blinded for three days and was only restored when he was baptised by Ananias of Damascus.\n\nFollowing his conversion, he became a prolific missionary and teacher of the Gospels. Several of his letters to various Christian communities across the region became Biblical Canon and he helped spread the word of God far and wide.\n\nHis ministry drew heavy opposition however and in 57 AD, he was arrested in Jerusalem. While travelling to Rome to stand trial, he was shipwrecked on Malta. He arrived in Rome in 60 AD and spent another two years under house arrest.\n\nAfter he was put on trial, he was executed, along with St Peter, some time between 64 and 68 AD.\n\nJune 29 – St Peter\n\nJune 29 is the feast day of Saint Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus and the first Bishop of Rome.\n\nThe feast day is celebrated as the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, honouring the martyrdom of both Peter and Saint Paul the Apostle.\n\nNamed Simon at birth, Peter was a Jewish fisherman in Bethsaida.
