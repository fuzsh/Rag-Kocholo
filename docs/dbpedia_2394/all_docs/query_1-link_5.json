        "text": "St. Eusebius of Vercelli was born in Sardinia, Italy in 283. He was the first bishop of Vercelli in Piedmont in northern Italy. His father was a martyr and he suffered exile by strongly affirming the divinity of Jesus & the Nicene Creed, and defending the Church against the Arian heresy. He died in 371 & is buried in the Vercelli Cathedral. His feast day is August 2nd.\n\nAugust 8th is the Feast Day of Saint Dominic de Guzmán, the founder of the Order of Preachers (the Dominican Order.) While he was born in Spain, he lived in Italy for several years, as the order was headquartered in Rome, and is beloved there. He believed in rigorous study of Scripture, philosophy, natural sciences and theology to preach and teach about Christ. He received the Rosary from the Blessed Mother herself and the Dominicans have spread the devotion ever since. His relics reside in the “Ark of Saint Dominic”, decorated by some of the most skilled artists including Michelangelo. It resides in Dominic’s Chapel in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. He is the patron of astronomers & natural scientists.\n\nSt. Clare of Assisi was a devoted follower of St. Francis of Assisi, who helped her found the religious order that eventually was called the “Poor Clares.” Completely devoted to Christ and contemplation of Him, she insisted the order follow extreme poverty, seclusion from the world, and almost complete silence. They constantly prayed, slept on the ground, ate no meat, and performed manual labor barefoot. Clare was the abbess of her monastery, a powerful position for a woman at that time, which enabled her to prevent even the Pope from changing the rule of life of their community to an easier one. She had a strong devotion to Christ in the Eucharist and is credited with saving Assisi from the Saracens by adoration of the Eucharist. In 1958, Pope Pius XII made her the patron saint of television, telephone, and telegraph because when she was ill, she was able to see & hear Mass on the wall of her room. It seems fitting that her spiritual daughter, Mother Angelica, who was a Poor Clare, founded EWTN, the largest radio & TV religious network in the world! St. Clare’s relics reside at the Basilica of St. Clare in Assisi, in the Province of Perugia. Her feast day is August 11th.\n\nBlessed Pier Giorgio Frassati. Born in Turin, Italy in 1901, Bl. Pier was an avid skier, mountain climber, swimmer, and most of all, lover of the poor. He gave up family vacations to help the poor, even giving the up the clothes and shoes he was wearing. When he died at 24 years old of an unexpected and quick case of polio, the streets were filled with mourners, hundreds of the poor followed his coffin. He is still beloved by young Catholics today, and there are Frassati groups around the world to encourage people in their faith and to help the poor. For more info: Read the book, and listen to Teresa Tomeo’s interview with the author about Bl. Frassati. His feast day is July 4.\n\nMaria Goretti was born into extreme poverty in 1890, in Corinaldo, the Province of Ancona, in the Kingdom of Italy. The third of seven children, her family had to leave their farm and eventually moved to Nettuno, in Lazio, south of Rome. Her father died when she was nine and her mother and siblings had to work the fields to survive, while she needed to cook, clean and take care of her baby sister, in a rented house with a man and his 20 year old son, Alessandro. Alessandro attempted to rape the 11-year old Maria three times, each time she vehemently protected her virginity, and pleaded with him not to attack her because it was a mortal in that would send him to hell. In the final attempt, after being told “God does not want it! It is a sin!” he violently stabbed her 14 times with an awl. She died the next day at age 11, while praying & forgiving him. Her attacker went to prison, and converted after seeing her in a dream handing him lilies that then burned him horribly. When he got out of prison he went to her mother and begged her forgiveness, and eventually joined a monastery to live out the rest of his life in penance. He attended her canonization. St. Maria’s relics reside at the Passionist Basilica Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti in Nettuno. She is the patron of teens and rape victims. Her feast day is July 6th.\n\nSt. Benedict was a monk and abbot born in Nursia, in Umbria, Italy in 480. His father was a Roman noble, his mother died at his birth. Founder of the Benedictine religious order, he is considered to be the “Father of Western Monasticism,” and he founded several monasteries, as well as working many miracles. His prime achievement was his rules for monks, the “Rule of St. Benedict,” known for its balanced discipline, and the rule “Ora et Labora” – Pray and Work, eight hours each of prayer, work, and sleep. Associated with him is the popular “Jubilee Medal” of St. Benedict, worn “to call down God’s blessing and protection upon us, wherever we are, and upon our homes and possessions, especially through the intercession of St. Benedict.” Benedict survived an attempt on his life when someone poisoned his cup. After saying a prayer over the cup, it shattered, preventing him from consuming the poison. He passed away of a fever at Monte Cassino, 80 miles southeast of Rome, in 547, not long after his twin sister, St. Scholastica died, and they are both buried there. He is the patron of Europe. His feast day is July 11th.\n\nSt. Bonaventure. Born in 1221 in Bagnorea, Italy he became one of the Church’s great philosophers and theologians, which led to him being appointed a Cardinal, and later proclaimed as a Doctor of the Church in 1588. As a Franciscan mystic he believed the goal of all art & science is to lead one to contemplation of God. Some interesting facts: He was healed from an illness as a child by St. Francis of Assisi, and St. Thomas Aquinas was his good friend. He died in 1274. He is considered the second founder of the Franciscan Order, having given the Order much needed structure and organization. His relics rest at the Cathedral of Saint Bonaventure in Bagnoregio, Italy, of which he is patron. His feast day is July 15th.\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua. St. Anthony was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1195, but served the poor in the town of Padua in northern Italy.

He died June 13, 1231. His relics reside in Padua at the Basilica of St. Anthony. His feast day is June 13th.\n\nConsidered a “model shepherd,” St. Giovanni Battista Scalabrini was born in Fino Mornasco, in the Province of Como, in the Lombardy region of Italy, near the border with Switzerland. He burned with zeal for God & his people. Pius IX called him the “Apostle of the Catechism.” As bishop of Piacenza, he exhausted himself spreading the catechism, love for the Eucharist, and tending the sick & poor, especially Italian emigrants forced to leave to other countries to survive. He started new religious orders, reformed seminaries, comforted prisoners, saved farmers and workers from famine by selling his valuables, chalice, and his horses, and afterward walking on foot to visit the people of his diocese. This amazing saint was newly canonized in October 2022, he is the patron of Italian immigrants, missionaries & catechists. His feast day is June 1st.

He was devoted to the Holy Name of Jesus and devised a symbol consisting of the first three letters in Greek of Jesus’ name, IHS on the background of the sun, in order to honor Him and counteract the many superstitious symbols popular at that time. Due to this connection, he is the patron of advertisers and public relations workers. He also is the patron of gambling addicts, the Diocese of San Bernadino in California, and several other cities that bear his name, especially in Italy. He died in 1444 and was quickly canonized a saint in 1450 by Pope Nicholas V. He is buried in the Basilica of San Bernardino, in L’Aquila, Italy, in the province of Abruzzo. His feast day is May 20th.\n\nSt. Philip Neri, whose feast day in the Catholic Church is May 26th, was known as the “apostle of Rome” even though he was born and raised in the Renaissance City of Florence. The Italian priest, who died in 1595, was well educated and came from a wealthy family. He was designated to take over a prosperous family business, but a profound mystical vision led to a major Christian conversion. He quickly lost interest in the family business and felt a call to serve God, so he headed for Rome. His goal was to help the poor and evangelize the Eternal City whose residents were no longer living moral Christian lives. He preached everywhere and anywhere including on street corners and in the piazzas or public squares. He encouraged faith-based gatherings and discussions and was known for starting conversations with the questions, “well brothers, when shall we begin to do good?” The “apostle of Rome” is also one of the city’s five patron saints.

As an active member of Catholic Action and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, she lived out her faith helping others. She received her medical degree and became a pediatrician.

Inspired by the life of Don Bosco and the example of Salesian priests, he joined the Salesians with the intention of becoming a priest himself, but because of his lack of education and his contracting tuberculosis from a young priest he nursed, he was unable to fulfill that desire.

The most popular of these is St. Valentine of Rome who was martyred by beheading around 270 AD for possibly marrying young Christian couples, when Christianity was forbidden.

The man she wanted to marry rejected her for her sister, and her petulant attitude caused her family to force her to join a Franciscan convent as a teenager. She refused the life of poverty, insisting on living a luxurious life even in the convent. After several years, her confessor discovered this, and urged her to be more humble. She changed her life and became well known for her devotion to the poor. She is a great example that if we are having trouble with humility, not to give up. Read more about her here.
