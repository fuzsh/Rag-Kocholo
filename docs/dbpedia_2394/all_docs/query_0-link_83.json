        "text": "A couple of days in Lucca last week were rain free – perfect for catching up on errands. My tasks included a stop at the lavandaria (cleaners), a quick visit to a local shop to buy a pretty pot for the chives I’ll grow on a sunny windowsill, a meet up with a friend for a coffee (there may have been a pastry involved), and a trip to the Ortofrutta to stock up on vegetables.\n\nThe best part of running errands here is that it never feels like a chore. No drudgery involved. How could there be when the errands are done on foot and all involve a walk through historic Medieval streets? There are ancient stone buildings, centuries old decorative brick work around windows, balconies full of flowers, and beautiful old wooden doors along every route. Add to that the sound of spoken Italian providing a soundtrack to daily life here and chores are fun.\n\nOn my errands I stopped into one of Lucca’s small and lesser known (at least to visitors; it’s a favorite of locals) churches. It was empty, silent, and unguarded. I was the only person inside, free to admire the architecture, artwork, and treasures within. To leave such a historic place, filled with valuable artifacts, so accessible would be unheard of in the US. Here in Lucca it is not unusual at all.\n\nThe church, officially the Church of San Salvatore in Mustolio, is more commonly known as the Church of the Misericordia because it is located right next to what was for many years the office of the Misericordia Ambulance Service.\n\nA few months ago the ambulance service moved outside of central Lucca, leaving a spot for some benches and flower pots in the space where the ambulances used to sit. The stone wall of the church is now easy to see and the historic carved lintel above the side door more visible.\n\nThe quiet church provides an oasis of calm. As an added bonus, it sits within the Piazza del Salvatore with Nottolini’s famous fountain topped by the Naiade statue. What a beautiful place to stop in the midst of running errands!\n\n** A huge thanks to The Wanderer’s Guide to Lucca by Brian Lindquist for the history of San Salvatore church. His book, and the accompanying Wanderer’s Map, remain the most valuable English language source for information on the historic churches and buildings in Lucca. It’s a must have for anyone living here or interested in Lucca’s history.\n\nSan Lorenzo is more than just a church – the complex also has a museum, the Laurentian Library, and the Medici Chapels. Underneath the Medici chapels is a recently discovered hidden room with rough sketches by Michelangelo covering the walls. Right now it’s the hottest attraction in town but it was not yet opened during my November stay in Florence. The library is not always open, and a special ticket is needed for the Medici Chapel. The entire complex is a bit too much for one visit.\n\nOn my recent off-season stay in Florence, I stopped by on the spur of the moment and purchased a ticket which included only the cloister and church, both of which were uncrowded and just right for a short visit.\n\nWhat is it that makes the San Lorenzo Basilica one of my favorites? It starts with the rough stone exterior. Unlike the polished marble façade of the Duomo, the San Lorenzo stands unadorned and underdressed. It was meant to have a white marble façade, designed by Michelangelo at the request of the Medici Pope Leo X. But the pope died, the money dried up, and the façade was never installed.\n\nInside, the basilica feels quiet and peaceful with its simple geometric floor anchoring graceful arches and columns in gray Pietra Serena (Serene Stone). The high, round, windows let in light through their clear glass. Even the ceiling, with its gold edged squares and central medallions (look for the Medici coat of arms) feels calming. Unlike more ornate churches (such as my other favorite, the very Baroque Santissima Annunziata), San Lorenzo has low contrast colors and finishes. This allows it to feel open and airy. The Basilica is a soothing space that supports quiet contemplation and an uncluttered mind.\n\nAnother reason to love this church is the way in which it showcases the work of Donatello. His two ornately carved pulpits, raised high atop marble columns in the center of the church, are considered his final masterpieces.\n\nThe biggest reason for my love of this church is the small Sagrestia Vecchia (Old Sacristy). Designed by Brunelleschi, it was the only portion of the church completed before his death. His perfectly proportioned design incorporates a square room with a ribbed dome on top, several graceful arches, and the same gray and white colors of the main church.\n\nOpposite the entry into the sacristy is a small marble altar, its design in white marble is in keeping with the simplicity of the rest of Brunelleschi’s design. Above the altar, in a smaller dome, is a remarkable blue and gold night sky. There has been some debate about the date represented by the constellations pictured. Initially it was thought to represent the day the altar was consecrated in July of 1422. Newer theories give the date as July 6, 1439, the date of the accord uniting the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity. Whichever date is correct, the constellations unite the sacristy with the heavens.\n\nThe Basilica of San Lorenzo is not the largest or most ornate church in Florence. It wears no colorful marble facade. But it is stunning in its simplicity and is of great historical and architectual importance. When visiting, don’t miss the literature with a QR code which links to an audio guide. The audio descriptions greatly enhanced any visit.\n\nEntry and Exit to the church is through the cloisters. This green space, surrounded by a two-story loggia, is a destination all of its own. The lower floor of the loggia surrounds a neatly kept space with low hedges and a big central tree. Under the arches is a walkway with walls filled with memorials to long ago Florentines. It’s a moving space embracing both the quiet of the church and views out into the “real world” of Florence. You can almost hear the rustling robes of those long ago monks as they walk through the cloister.\n\nI am not an art historian; far from it. I don’t even claim to be a serious student of art. And yet, it is impossible to live in Italy and not develop a profound appreciation for art. There are museums full of ancient art – Etruscan and Roman – displaying artifacts from those eras, from tiny jewelry pieces to funeral urns, mosaics, and classic statuary. And though there were also Roman painters, the examples that have survived are relatively few. In contrast, paintings from the late Medieval (Middle Age) and Renaissance periods fill Italian churches and museums. The differences between the two eras can be appreciated by even an untrained observer like myself.\n\nPrior to the Renaissance, Medieval paintings were characterized by religious subjects, often a single figure filling the center of a painting. The figures were flat and the faces often expressionless. The human form was not natural looking or sensuous. These were icons, not neighbors.\n\nBackgrounds and perspective were not very important components of medieval painting. And all that gold! Gold shows up everywhere in Italian art of the middle ages. In backgrounds, in halos, in elaborate detailing. Imagine how that gold appeared – as the richness of God, the divine light – and also, perhaps, an symbol of the wealth of the patron or church who commissioned the work.\n\nIn contrast, paintings from the Renaissance era (1400 – 1600 AD) make wonderful use of perspective and often place subjects in natural settings. The figures are realistic, their human-ness evident. The clothing drapes and swirls, the faces show a full range of emotions. The subjects are still largely religious, though portraits were also painted, usually for wealthy patrons (think of Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, painted in 1503). The names of Renaissance artists are familiar: Donatello, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael being perhaps the most widely known artists from the 1400’s.\n\nAnd in between the two periods, the Medieval and the Renaissance, came Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337). Giotto was that rare artist who was appreciated, even famous, during his lifetime. He even merited a mention by his contemporary Dante in The Divine Comedy.\n\nGiotto revolutionized Italian art, creating life-like figures and placing them in more natural settings. Giotto’s figures show a full range of emotions through their facial expressions. No flat, lifeless saints and madonnas here! Giotto’s scenes are populated by people who look like the neighbors down the street (at least what the neighbors would have looked like in 1300). His men are placed in realistic poses and settings, his ladies have (gasp!) breasts over which their garments drape. His angels fly, his flames flicker. And while the saints still have halos of gold, their clothing is colorful and the background is the most heavenly blue.\n\nAnd the history! From Etruscan tombs to Roman roads, from Medieval streetscapes to World War II bombs, the history of these villages is rich and fascinating. That they have so much in common, and yet each village has its own unique character, makes a trip through this area especially wonderful. Think of Monticchiello with its Teatro Povero and stone houses, Montalcino with its famed Brunello wine and steep streets, Bagno Vignoni with its thermal pools, and Pienza - the perfect Renaissance city - with its pretty houses and flowers filled window boxes.\n\nSan Quirico d’Orcia is yet another of the villages found in the Val d’Orcia. Named after a martyred child saint, it lies between Montalcino and Pienza, situated along the ancient Via Francigena, the pilgrim’s route between Canterbury and Rome. Today, modern pilgrims and adventurous walkers still pass through San Quirico as they follow the ancient path. Other tourists arrive more conventionally by car and stay to enjoy the many things that make this a most pleasant spot.\n\nIt’s also fun to wander the small side streets. On my most recent visit, during the height of the olive harvest, I found an active but very old frantoio (olive press) which was still using old stones to grind the olives. The friendly staff invited me inside to watch the process. The smell of the fresh olive oil was delicious!\n\nAnd on a side street just along the church of San Francesco is the wonderful Trattoria al Vecchio Forno, built on the site of the old town bakery (forno). I’ve eaten here on previous visits and it’s a place that never fails to please. My lunch, a honey drizzled sformatino and a pappa al pomodoro, eaten outside in the garden on a warm fall day, was delicious.\n\nHeading back to Pienza, the Chapel of the Madonna of Vitaleta is visible from the road. It is well worth the detour to stop and visit this tiny chapel, which is one of the most photographed spots in Tuscany. The chapel itself is not usually open, but the surrounding vistas are spectacular.\n\nSan Quirico was the last stop on my trip through the Val d’Orcia. There are so many other places left to explore, among them the famous wine towns of Montalcino and Montepulciano (which is just outside the Val d’Orcia) and also the gardens at La Foce.\n\nI guess I’d better start planning a return trip!\n\nBut for the September festival the crucifix is anything but simple. Instead, it is adorned with gold vestments – from crown to shoes – and the small chapel is opened for up-close encounters with what is, depending on your personal beliefs, a holy religious artifact or an important cultural and historical object. (For a more detailed description of the legend of the Volto Santo see “The Legend of the Volto Santo” post from September of 2017). Unfortunately this year, while the gold vestments are in place, entrance to the cathedral is limited which means that most of us will have to make do with memories and photos from past years.\n\nThe luminaria procession is an important event - calling home from around the world those with Lucchese roots - and has only rarely been cancelled. The last two cancellations were due to a terrible storm in 1976 and before that a disruption towards the end of World War II. This year the cancellation of the procession is due to concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 through the crowds of on-lookers that typically line the streets and the many participants in the procession. The candles were lit, but there was no procession this year."
