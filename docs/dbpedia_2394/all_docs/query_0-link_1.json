        "text": "St. Joseph of Cupertino was born in 1603 in a barn in great poverty. Learning disabled, but very devout, he began receiving visions and ecstasies at 8 years old. Challenging to most people he knew, Joseph’s ecstasies caused him to stop speaking mid-sentence, or drop whatever he was carrying, or doing, and stand motionless, his mouth agape. Misunderstood, rejected, and poorly treated, the Conventual Franciscan order allowed him to enter as a servant to take care of the donkey. Through a series of providential happenings, Joseph became a priest, even without an education. He became well known for miracles of healing, multiplication of food, bilocation, and of his friendship with animals and birds. Continuing to have ecstasies while in prayer, he frequently levitated, and even flew up into trees or hovered in the sky. Popular with the laity, he was kept in strict seclusion for years until his death. He is the patron saint of pilots, the learning disabled, and exam takers. His feast day is September 18th. His relics reside in the Basilica of San Giuseppe da Copertino, Osimo, Italy, Province of Ancona, Marche Region. Learn more about his difficult but amazing life here.\n\nSt. Pio of Pietrelcina, better known as Padre Pio, is one of the most famous saints in the 20th century, and the patron saint of Italy. He was well known for his daily long hours in the confessional, his miracles, bilocations and most famously for the stigmata. His monastery and the surrounding town of San Giovanni Rotondo is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in Italy. Learn more about him here. His feast day is September 23rd.\n\nSt. Eusebius of Vercelli was born in Sardinia, Italy in 283. He was the first bishop of Vercelli in Piedmont in northern Italy. His father was a martyr and he suffered exile by strongly affirming the divinity of Jesus & the Nicene Creed, and defending the Church against the Arian heresy. He died in 371 & is buried in the Vercelli Cathedral. His feast day is August 2nd.\n\nAugust 8th is the Feast Day of Saint Dominic de Guzmán, the founder of the Order of Preachers (the Dominican Order.) While he was born in Spain, he lived in Italy for several years, as the order was headquartered in Rome, and is beloved there. He believed in rigorous study of Scripture, philosophy, natural sciences and theology to preach and teach about Christ. He received the Rosary from the Blessed Mother herself and the Dominicans have spread the devotion ever since. His relics reside in the “Ark of Saint Dominic”, decorated by some of the most skilled artists including Michelangelo. It resides in Dominic’s Chapel in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. He is the patron of astronomers & natural scientists.\n\nSt. Clare of Assisi was a devoted follower of St. Francis of Assisi, who helped her found the religious order that eventually was called the “Poor Clares.” Completely devoted to Christ and contemplation of Him, she insisted the order follow extreme poverty, seclusion from the world, and almost complete silence. They constantly prayed, slept on the ground, ate no meat, and performed manual labor barefoot. Clare was the abbess of her monastery, a powerful position for a woman at that time, which enabled her to prevent even the Pope from changing the rule of life of their community to an easier one. She had a strong devotion to Christ in the Eucharist and is credited with saving Assisi from the Saracens by adoration of the Eucharist. In 1958, Pope Pius XII made her the patron saint of television, telephone, and telegraph because when she was ill, she was able to see & hear Mass on the wall of her room. It seems fitting that her spiritual daughter, Mother Angelica, who was a Poor Clare, founded EWTN, the largest radio & TV religious network in the world! St. Clare’s relics reside at the Basilica of St. Clare in Assisi, in the Province of Perugia. Her feast day is August 11th.\n\nBlessed Pier Giorgio Frassati. Born in Turin, Italy in 1901, Bl. Pier was an avid skier, mountain climber, swimmer, and most of all, lover of the poor. He gave up family vacations to help the poor, even giving the up the clothes and shoes he was wearing. When he died at 24 years old of an unexpected and quick case of polio, the streets were filled with mourners, hundreds of the poor followed his coffin. He is still beloved by young Catholics today, and there are Frassati groups around the world to encourage people in their faith and to help the poor. For more info: Read the book, and listen to Teresa Tomeo’s interview with the author about Bl. Frassati. His feast day is July 4.\n\nMaria Goretti was born into extreme poverty in 1890, in Corinaldo, the Province of Ancona, in the Kingdom of Italy. The third of seven children, her family had to leave their farm and eventually moved to Nettuno, in Lazio, south of Rome. Her father died when she was nine and her mother and siblings had to work the fields to survive, while she needed to cook, clean and take care of her baby sister, in a rented house with a man and his 20 year old son, Alessandro. Alessandro attempted to rape the 11-year old Maria three times, each time she vehemently protected her virginity, and pleaded with him not to attack her because it was a mortal in that would send him to hell. In the final attempt, after being told “God does not want it! It is a sin!” he violently stabbed her 14 times with an awl. She died the next day at age 11, while praying & forgiving him. Her attacker went to prison, and converted after seeing her in a dream handing him lilies that then burned him horribly. When he got out of prison he went to her mother and begged her forgiveness, and eventually joined a monastery to live out the rest of his life in penance. He attended her canonization. St. Maria’s relics reside at the Passionist Basilica Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti in Nettuno. She is the patron of teens and rape victims. Her feast day is July 6th.\n\nSt. Benedict was a monk and abbot born in Nursia, in Umbria, Italy in 480. His father was a Roman noble, his mother died at his birth. Founder of the Benedictine religious order, he is considered to be the “Father of Western Monasticism,” and he founded several monasteries, as well as working many miracles. His prime achievement was his rules for monks, the “Rule of St. Benedict,” known for its balanced discipline, and the rule “Ora et Labora” – Pray and Work, eight hours each of prayer, work, and sleep. Associated with him is the popular “Jubilee Medal” of St. Benedict, worn “to call down God’s blessing and protection upon us, wherever we are, and upon our homes and possessions, especially through the intercession of St. Benedict.” Benedict survived an attempt on his life when someone poisoned his cup. After saying a prayer over the cup, it shattered, preventing him from consuming the poison. He passed away of a fever at Monte Cassino, 80 miles southeast of Rome, in 547, not long after his twin sister, St. Scholastica died, and they are both buried there. He is the patron of Europe. His feast day is July 11th.\n\nSt. Bonaventure. Born in 1221 in Bagnorea, Italy he became one of the Church’s great philosophers and theologians, which led to him being appointed a Cardinal, and later proclaimed as a Doctor of the Church in 1588.

Some interesting facts: He was healed from an illness as a child by St. Francis of Assisi, and St. Thomas Aquinas was his good friend. He died in 1274. He is considered the second founder of the Franciscan Order, having given the Order much needed structure and organization. His relics rest at the Cathedral of Saint Bonaventure in Bagnoregio, Italy, of which he is patron. His feast day is July 15th.\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua. St. Anthony was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1195, but served the poor in the town of Padua in northern Italy.

He burned with zeal for God & his people. Pius IX called him the “Apostle of the Catechism.” As bishop of Piacenza, he exhausted himself spreading the catechism, love for the Eucharist, and tending the sick & poor, especially Italian emigrants forced to leave to other countries to survive. He started new religious orders, reformed seminaries, comforted prisoners, saved farmers and workers from famine by selling his valuables, chalice, and his horses, and afterward walking on foot to visit the people of his diocese. Pope Benedict XV thought of him as a “bishop beyond compare.” His last words were: “Lord, I am ready, let us go.” This amazing saint was newly canonized in October 2022. His relics reside in the Piacenza Cathedral in Piacenza, Italy, Province of Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna Region. He is the patron of Italian immigrants, missionaries & catechists.

He was a priest and Franciscan missionary, carer of plague sufferers, scholastic economist, and said to be the greatest preacher of his time, especially against the rampant paganism and sins of his day. He was devoted to the Holy Name of Jesus and devised a symbol consisting of the first three letters in Greek of Jesus’ name, IHS on the background of the sun, in order to honor Him and counteract the many superstitious symbols popular at that time. Due to this connection, he is the patron of advertisers and public relations workers. He also is the patron of gambling addicts, the Diocese of San Bernadino in California, and several other cities that bear his name, especially in Italy.

His feast day is May 20th.\n\nSt. Philip Neri, whose feast day in the Catholic Church is May 26th, was known as the “apostle of Rome” even though he was born and raised in the Renaissance City of Florence. The Italian priest, who died in 1595, was well educated and came from a wealthy family. He was designated to take over a prosperous family business, but a profound mystical vision led to a major Christian conversion. He quickly lost interest in the family business and felt a call to serve God, so he headed for Rome. His goal was to help the poor and evangelize the Eternal City whose residents were no longer living moral Christian lives. He preached everywhere and anywhere including on street corners and in the piazzas or public squares. He encouraged faith-based gatherings and discussions and was known for starting conversations with the questions, “well brothers, when shall we begin to do good?” The “apostle of Rome” is also one of the city’s five patron saints.

She found him, but on her return, she was captured, wounded, and imprisoned by Islamic pirates. She was eventually ransomed and returned home. She soon left for a dangerous pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and gave spiritual and physical aid and courage to other pilgrims. Over her lifetime she led pilgrims nine times on the grueling 1000-mile journey to Santiago de Compostela and Spain. She died in Pisa in 1207. Her relics reside in the Church of San Martino, Pisa, Italy, Province of Pisa, Tuscany Region.

By 1436, enough men had also come to live in solitude to found a religious order, which later became the Minims. They vowed poverty, chastity, obedience, and year-round abstinence from meat and other animal products, to encourage fasting among the laity during Lent. He cured the sick, raised people and even animals from the dead, ended plagues, gave advice and comfort to thousands of people, and even could carry burning coals in his hands, giving him the nickname “Francis the Firehandler.” The famous sanctuary where he lived as a hermit is among the most popular tourist destinations in Calabria. In 1562, vandals raided his tomb, destroyed his incorrupt body, and scattered the remains. People gathered the relics, which were given to several churches, including one in Paola.

Born in Milan in 1922, as the 10th of 13 children, she was taught by her family that life was a wonderful gift. As an active member of Catholic Action and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, she lived out her faith helping others. She received her medical degree and became a pediatrician. She prayed to know her vocation, so she could follow God’s will for her life. Discerning her vocation was to marriage, she married Pietro Molla with the intention “to form a truly Christian family.” An enthusiastic wife and mother of three, her pregnancy with her fourth child became endangered when a large benign uterine tumor was discovered early in the pregnancy. Encouraged to abort the child and possibly have a hysterectomy, she fought for her child’s life and chose to have the tumor removed and continue the pregnancy. Seven months later she had a caesarean section. She insisted the child’s life be saved before hers, if necessary. She, however, acquired peritonitis after the birth, and died a week later.

He dropped out of school at nine years of age due to his family’s poverty. His family moved to Argentina to find work when he was 17 years old. Inspired by the life of Don Bosco and the example of Salesian priests, he joined the Salesians with the intention of becoming a priest himself, but because of his lack of education and his contracting tuberculosis from a young priest he nursed, he was unable to fulfill that desire.
