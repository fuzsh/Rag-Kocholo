        "text": "\"About a thousand religious works of art have been moved to museums in Italy, especially after the Second World War,\" according to the latest issue of the Italian monthly, Il Giornale dell'Arte.\n\nBut the periodical reported that Eike Schmidt, director of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, is urging museums to return those objects of sacred art to churches where they were originally housed.\n\n\"The time has come for state museums to return paintings and altarpieces made for churches and chapels,\" Schmidt said at a May 27 press briefing to reopen the Uffizi after a ten-week COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nThe idea was originally proposed in 1996 by Giorgio Bonsanti, then head of the School for Research and Restoration of Works of Art (Opificio delle Pietre Dure).\n\n\"Italy distinguishes itself from other countries by the dissemination of its cultural heritage throughout the territory. This would restore their original value to the works of art and the places for which they were designed,\" said Schmidt.\n\nIn other words, it would be a matter of returning them to their original architectural and spatial context.\n\nSchmidt, a German art historian who has been director of the Uffizi since 2015, is not suggesting that all religious art be put back into churches, however.\n\nFor instance, works acquired over the centuries by the Medici or the Habsburg-Lorraine and \"part of very specific collections\" could remain in museums.\n\nBut religious paintings and altarpieces for which there has never been a formal transfer of property should be returned.\n\nHe pointed to Duccio's Rucellai Madonna as a clear example. The altarpiece was painted around 1275 for the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, run by Dominican friars.\n\nBut it was moved to the Uffizi in 1948.\n\n\"Certainly, this masterpiece offers the Uffizi the possibility of comparing its style with two other altarpieces on the same subject by Cimabue and Giotto. But its absence in Santa Maria Novella takes away from an essential part of the history of the basilica,” the 52-year-old curator said.\n\n“If we return it in 2021 it would be a beautiful way to celebrate the 800 years since the Dominicans arrived in Florence,\" he noted.\n\nA law would be necessary\n\nSchmidt said any restitution would require the guarantee for conditions of security and conservation, and is counting on a \"broad, fair and unprejudiced\" public debate to move his proposal forward.\n\n\"It's a smart idea, especially since the changes caused by the pandemic require inventing new approaches for visitors to enjoy our heritage,\" said Monica Barni, vice-president of the Region of Tuscany in charge of cultural affairs.\n\n\"This proposal deserves attention and approval,” said Cardinal Giuseppe Betori of Florence.\n\n“But it will have to be done on a case-by-case basis,\" he added.\n\nMonsignor Timothy Verdon, the US-born director of the Archdiocese of Florence’s Office of Sacred Art and Church Cultural Heritage, said the initiative was \"extremely positive, but difficult to implement\".\n\nIn principle, Schmidt’s idea would require an ad hoc bill before Italian parliament."
