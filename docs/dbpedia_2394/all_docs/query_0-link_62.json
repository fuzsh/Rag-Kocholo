        "text": "With the demise of the Roman Empire in the first half of the 5th century, Europe descended into what is appropriately known as “The Dark Ages”. During this time much of the intellectual, cultural, and scientific advances made in Greek and Roman antiquity (the ‘Light’) were lost, as Europe declined into a millennium of scant human advancement (the ‘Dark’).\n\nDuring the 15th century, Italy, not yet a unified country, was made up of many individual Republics …\n\nInternecine disputes between and within these Republics – and the families that ruled them – were plentiful, with some Republican rulers such as the Sforza family in the Duchy of Milan exerting a tyrannical rule. However, there were Republics in which tolerance prevailed towards creativity and free speech which, in turn, was further aided by a decline in the influence of the church. In fact, the church’s power had already been called into question by the early humanist, poet and scholar, Petrarch (1304-1374), and by the poet, Dante (1265-1321).\n\nOne of these Republics, centred on Florence, was the Repubblica Fiorentina (Florentine Republic), no longer existing but which nowadays forms a greater part of Tuscany.\n\nFirst established in 1115, the Florentine Republic was ruled over from 1434 until 1737 by the House of Medici, a rich family of bankers, who were to become a Florentine political dynasty. Their influence rose (and fell) through the generations during which time their number included Popes, Grand Dukes and Princes, with the first Gran Maestro (Head of the Florentine Republic) being Cosimo the Elder (1389-1464), Pater Patriae (father of his country) …\n\nThe unparalleled wealth of the Medici, as indeed the wealth of many merchants and bankers in Florence at that time, was accompanied by the humanist outlook of enjoying the ‘here and now’, celebrating human achievement and fostering an understanding of humanity’s place in the world. This marked a questioning of religious orthodoxy and a move away from medieval superstition and gothic art and culture. This, in turn, was accompanied by a desire of the rich, ruling classes to become patrons of literature, architecture, fine arts, philosophy, music, politics technology, and science.\n\nThe re-emergence of ancient texts and the subsequent rekindling of Roman and Greek culture led to a rebirth (i.e. renaissance) of things classical in which the Renaissance humanist ideals harked back to ancient times where beauty, the individual and nature were more to the fore than things mystical or spiritual.\n\nIn fact, the Renaissance was so entrenched in Greek and Roman culture that contemporary Florentine society designated Florence as the “New Athens” or “New Rome”, with the Medici subsequently becoming the “Godfathers of the Renaissance” inspiring, through their patronage, the greatest artists, scientists and intellectuals of the day.\n\nThe term “Renaissance” specifically relating to this period, was first coined by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 book, “The Lives of the Artists”.\n\nConsider first, for example, Sculpture. Unlike the classical nude statues of Greece and Rome, post-antiquity medieval statues were invariably clothed. Then, under the patronage of Cosimo de ‘Medici, came the Early Renaissance Florentine sculptor, Donatello (1386 – 1466) whose most famous work is the bronze statue of David (c. 1440, Bargello Museum, Florence). This, amazingly, was the first naked body sculpture depicted as a stand-alone statue since classical times …\n\nThis statue would have shocked many at the time, especially the Catholic Church; not least because it was a humanist expression of the male form.\n\nWhile Donatello was Early Renaissance (c.1400 – c.1500), a more famous Florentine sculptor was active during the High Renaissance (c.1500 – c.1530) – Michelangelo Buonarotti. While Michelangelo’s most famous and fabulous sculpture, the Pietà (c.1499, St Peter’s Basilica, Rome), adhered to the acceptable norms of the Catholic Church …\n\n… his David (c.1504, Galleria dell’ Accademia, Florence), although representing a biblical figure, certainly veered more towards the humanist ideal! …\n\nJust to take a step back, compare Michelangelo’s highly sophisticated, highly detailed Pietà with a pre-Renaissance, more naive representation from just a hundred years earlier (c.1380) …\n\n(OK, I know, one swallow doesn’t make a summer! One example like this can never be an absolute proof of anything. All comparisons given in this post are subjective and purely and unashamedly indicative. )\n\nIn Art, the difference between pre- and post-renaissance is as marked as in sculpture. Pre-renaissance art is typified by religious iconography. The churches had the funds to commission artists to decorate their buildings with representations of the Holy Family and the Saints. Medieval, pre-Renaissance, art would be devoid of perspective, real-world representations or backgrounds and would typically have stylised, unrealistic face-on or profile figures with plain or gold backgrounds. Take for example, the following detail from one of the frescoes in the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi, c.1320 – quite sophisticated for its time …\n\nNow compare that with the Renaissance art of just two hundred years later …\n\nOnce again, it’s not comparing like-for-like, and rightly so since a non-religious, humanistic painting such as this would have been rare pre-Renaissance. Notice now how Florentine Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (1483 – 1561) portrays a much more realistic, prosaic, almost everyday, scene here and draws in the real world as a backdrop in his Portrait of a Jeweller (c.1505-10. Florence, Galleria Palatina di Palazzo Pitti). The houses on the right now exhibit the ideas of perspective giving depth to the scene. The light and shade across the three-quarter face now imparts a much more intensely realistic feel, pre-empting the chiaroscuro (light-dark) technique made famous by Caravaggio (1571-1610), while the much more lifelike jeweller ponders what is very much an earthly object.\n\nOf course, it isn’t possible to mention High Renaissance Florentine art without mentioning Leonardo da Vinci (1452 – 1519) – “Renaissance Man” …\n\n… who, although born near Vinci, spent many years in Florence under the Medici before moving to Milan in 1482. An excellent example of Leonardo’s High Renaissance painting (although with a flawed execution) is on the refectory wall of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan – The Last Supper.\n\nAlthough a biblical context, (“One of you will betray me”), the scene is alive with action, as the disciples turn to each other in concern and disbelief. Both Jesus and the disciples are represented with earthly faces (and without haloes). There is a real-world landscape beyond, outside the room. The room has depth using the techniques of perspective – with the vanishing point on the face of Jesus. Nothing stylised, the artist has gone for realism.\n\nYou can read more about Leonardo on our post, “Ponte Buriano and the Mona Lisa Mystery”, here, or on our post, “Leonardo da Vinci’s Birthplace”, here.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was a polymath – an artist, engineer, and scientist. But perhaps the most famous late Renaissance Scientist was Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642) – born the year Michelangelo died …\n\nBorn in Pisa (then part of the Florentine Republic) in the final days of the Renaissance, Galileo’s family moved to Florence when he was eight. By 1588, having been inspired by the Renaissance Florentine artists, he was teaching perspective and chiaroscuro at Florence’s Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, but by 1589 he had become Professor of Mathematics at Pisa University.\n\nDuring his time at Pisa University Galileo performed the famous experiment from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in which he dropped similar spherical objects of different masses to the ground – although the actuality of this event is seen to be something of a fictional embellishment. Galileo, the practical scientist, performed this experiment to disprove the assertion of the philospher, Aristotle (384-322 BC), that ‘heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects’. Unlike the practical Galileo, Aristotle firmly believed that the universe and all within it could be understood by the power of reason alone.\n\nNow Aristotle was revered among medieval Christians, so much so that his teachings influenced the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church – where he was referred to as “The Philosopher”. His philosophies were sacrosanct, being almost embedded within the Church’s teachings. Anyone who contradicted Aristotle was branded a heretic. The reawakening and reassessments of the Renaissance put many writers, artists and scientists at odds with the Roman Catholic Church. Galileo’s work on falling bodies was one such example, such that in 1592 (age 28) he was not invited back to his position at Pisa University.\n\nFortunately, that year he secured a position teaching mathematics and astronomy at the University of Padua.\n\nRenaissance science and astronomy had progressed significantly before and during the time of Galileo, with the works of, amongst others, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) and Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543).\n\nBy 1609, Galileo was receiving plaudits for his development of the telescope …\n\nOn the wall of number 11 Costa di San Giorgio, Florence, along the road from a house once owned by Galileo, there is plaque on the wall relating to one of Galileo’s important discoveries …\n\nIn 1609 Galileo Galilei\n\nperfected the use of the telescope to carry out astronomical observations, which led him to the discovery of the “Medici Satellites” of Jupiter.\n\nMounted on the occasion of the 4th centenary by the municipality of Florence\n\nNote how Galileo dedicated the discovery of the four largest moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), calling them the “Medici Satellites”, to his patron at the time, Cosimo II de ‘Medici (1590-1621), Grand Duke of Tuscany (father of Ferdinando II de ‘Medici), together with the presentation of a telescope to Cosimo, possibly in the hopes of obtaining some position back in Florence. Not a coincidence then that by 1611 he became the Chief Mathematician (back again) at Pisa University, and ‘Mathematician and Philosopher’ to Cosimo II himself, for whom he had been childhood tutor between 1605 and 1608.\n\nThe house at number 19 Costa di San Giorgio, Florence, down the lane, was purchased in 1628 listing Galileo as the owner, but ostensibly bought for Galileo’s 22-year-old son, Vincenzo, and his wife …\n\n… above the door on the wall of the first floor there is a likeness of Galileo …\n\n… and below that there is a plaque …\n\nHere, where Galileo lived,\n\nhis Majesty Ferdinando II de ‘Medici [1610-1670]\n\ndid not disdain\n\nfrom bowing before the power of the genius.\n\n… the indication here, if translated correctly, being that the Medici family, who had by then bestowed fame, employment, patronage and protection, was willing to acknowledge the genius of Galileo and his work.\n\nWith the advent of Gutenberg’s printing press in Germany in 1440, the latest thinking in the Renaissance movement was becoming more readily and easily widespread. However, this proliferation produced further tensions between renaissance artists and thinkers and the beliefs of the Catholic Church – a church that was then seeing its authority undermined by Martin Luther’s influence in the European Protestant Reformation around the 1520s. Unfortunately, Galileo and his scientific discoveries eventually fell foul of religious orthodoxy as this tension became most manifest in his field of astronomy.\n\nThe Catholic Church had always subscribed to the ‘geocentric view’ of the universe, placing the earth at its centre, after all it was “… God who made the world and everything in it …” (Acts 17:24), further and once again underwritten by the geocentric teachings of Aristotle. However, the work of Copernicus (On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres, pub. 1543) and the astronomical observations of Galileo placed the sun at the centre of the solar system, the ‘heliocentric view’. This was bound to incense the Catholic Church.\n\nCalled to the Roman Inquisition in 1616, Galileo was ordered by Pope Paul V (from the Borghese family of Siena) to revoke the ideas of heliocentrism and to desist from teaching it at the university. After ‘some lapses’ however, he was called again in 1632 by the Inquisition for heresy, despite pleas on his behalf by his patron Ferdinando II de ‘Medici, to renounce heliocentrism and his support for the Copernican view. Galileo stood firm in his science, despite being under threat of torture and, avoiding imprisonment, was eventually placed under house arrest at his villa, the Villa Il Gioiello at Arcetri near Florence where he lived out most of the rest of his days.\n\nUpon Galileo’s death, a remorseful Ferdinando planned some form of memorial – but was overruled by the Church. The dichotomy between religious belief and science did not make for easy bedfellows during the Renaissance.\n\nIt was only by 1992 that the Catholic Church and Pope John Paul II went some way to vindicate Galileo.\n\nYou can read more about Galileo at the end of our post, “Padua’s Palazzo della Ragione“, click here.\n\nProfound changes were made in Architecture during the Renaissance. Gone were designs using ornate and asymmetrical medieval Gothic structures and in came the designs based upon classical (Greek and Roman) architecture, remains of which were plentiful throughout the Italian peninsula. Renaissance architects were guided by these archaeological remains and by the writings and designs of Roman architect, Vitruvius (c. 75BC – 15BC), that promoted, amongst other things, the classical temple style of architecture which included classical orders of columns, lintels and triangular pediments, symmetry, round arches, tunnel vaults, sculptures, and domes.\n\nNotable amongst Florentine Renaissance architects was Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) – another under Medici patronage. As well as rediscovering the lost art of linear perspective, Brunelleschi is particularly famed for the design and building of the great dome atop Florence Cathedral (whose crypt houses his mortal remains) …\n\nAt the time there was a problem with the existing methods of construction for what would be, at 46 m (150 ft) wide, the largest dome in the world, especially on a wide, octagonal-plan building. Buttresses had been widely used on Gothic cathedrals around Europe (e.g., Milan, Paris), but Florence required a buttress-less solution. Begun in 1296, the cathedral remained without a permanent roof until Brunelleschi’s self-supporting dome design (based on his studies of the dome of the Pantheon in Rome) won the competition of 1418, with work commencing in 1420.\n\nBrunelleschi’s Dome is a landmark of Florence and an icon of the city (even when it is part-obscured by modern cranes and the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio!) …\n\nBrunelleschi’s ingenious solution for the dome can be found on Wikipedia here.\n\nAlthough certainly at the epicentre of Renaissance development, Florence’s influence inevitably spread across Italy. In the Veneto, late-Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508-1580) totally embraced the ideals of classical architecture through Vitruvius’ De Architectura, Libri Decem (The Ten Books on Architecture) which had been rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini, early Florentine Renaissance humanist, with many found in poor condition in European monastic libraries. Palladio is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential architects of the late Renaissance through his designs of his Palazzi and Villas. His adoption of the classical style can certainly be seen, for example, in the Villa Capra “La Rotonda” in Vicenza …\n\n… where the Greek Temple frontage was so good that Palladio decided to put it on all four sides of the Villa!\n\nYou can read more about Palladio on our post, “Andrea Palladio’s Work and Legacy” here.\n\nIn its turn, Palladio’s Renaissance influence spread across Europe (in England influencing amongst others, Inigo Jones, Colen Campbell, Henry Flitcroft and William Kent) – and even to architect and 3rd POTUS, Thomas Jefferson, in the USA. The USA, trying to slough off all things Georgian and British after independence, readily adopted Renaissance (hence Greek/Roman) architecture in many of their official buildings, such as the Capitol building in Washington …\n\nSo, the Renaissance was a fundamental driving force in bringing Europe – and eventually, the World – out of the Dark Ages into the Light.\n\nIt was from Florence that the Renaissance spread across the world and, in its turn, from Renaissance humanism emerged the European 17th-18th century intellectual movement, the ‘Age of Enlightenment’ …\n\n… but that’s another story!"
