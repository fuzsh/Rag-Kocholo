Mary, holding her breast, says to Jesus, \"Dearest son, because of the milk that I gave you, have mercy on them.\" Jesus, touching the wound in his side, gazes up and asks, \"My father, let those be saved for whom you wished me to suffer the Passion\" as God the Father sends the Dove of the Holy Spirit down from Heaven."
