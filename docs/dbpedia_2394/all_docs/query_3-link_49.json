        "text": "Summary\n\nThe bronze medal depicts the 78 old Cosimo III deâ Medici in profile to the right, dressed in parade armour decorated on the chest with the Florentine lily and the cross of the Order of St Stephen. The reverse shows a scene of St Joseph offering the Florentine lily to the Christ Child, with six darting flying angels holding the Medici palle above. Cosimo was sincerely pious and played a central role in promoting the cult of St Joseph, to whom he was particularly devoted. In a solemn ceremony on 18 December 1719, the Grand Duke named Joseph as the patron saint of Tuscany. The medal was commissioned in 1720 to Giovacchino Fortini to celebrate the event.\n\nGiovacchino Fortini (1670-1736) was one of the leading Florentine sculptors of the late Baroque period. Born in Settignano near Florence, he came from a family of stonecutters and ornamental sculptors. He later trained in the workshops of sculptors Carlo Marcellini and Giuseppe Piamontini. Fortini was a versatile artist, he produced works in different materials, from marble and bronze to stucco and terracotta, and was also active as an architect.\n\nIn portraiture he developed a distinctive and highly recognisable style, which is well represented by his production of medals. The Grand Dukeâs effigy on the obverse clearly shows the sculptor's mastery in capturing the physical appearance and character of the subject at the same time. The sculptor intended to portray the features of the old sovereign truthfully. Indeed, he showed no desire to hide the pronounced bags under the Grand Duke's eyes, the sagging skin in the area under his chin and his baldness, all clear signs of the passage of time. The choice to render in detail, without idealising concessions, every feature of the Grand Duke's head does not detract from the image in terms of solemnity: the nobility of spirit of the effigy shines through in all its power, thanks also to the proud pose and the monumental, almost heroic armour he wears (Bellesi, VisonÃ 2008, pp. 177-178).\n\nIn the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, starting from the late seventeenth century, cast medals underwent a period of new flowering, directly promoted by Cosimo III. From a young age, he had developed a deep interest in the art of the medal. He soon devised a project for the renewal of medal-making in the Grand Duchy, probably also stimulated by the results achieved in this field in capitals such as London and Paris, which he had the opportunity to visit during his youth when he extensively toured Europe.\n\nIn its multifaceted nature as a work of art, monument, document and erudite means of communication, the medal enjoyed widespread success in the eighteenth century. As an instrument of celebration of the individual, it was well suited to perform representative functions for the holders of power. Medals had the capacity to transmit, through their inscriptions and figurative representations, a specific public image of the portrayed person and to convey clear messages about their ambitions, values, talents, or stories.\n\nBibliographic references\n\nSchmidt, Eike, Bellesi, Sandro, and Gennaioli, Riccardo, eds., Plasmato dal fuoco.
