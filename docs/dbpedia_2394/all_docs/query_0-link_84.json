        "text": "This year's Jubilee, the Roman Catholic Holy Year, is expected to draw tens of millions of religious pilgrims and other visitors to Rome. For those whose idea of a vacation is a leisurely visit to a half-empty museum, Rome may not be the place to be this year. At the same time, the Jubilee has inspired dozens of exhibitions, concerts and other activities, making this a unique time to go.\n\nReligious Events\n\nFor Roman Catholics, visiting Rome in 2000 is a spiritual pilgrimage, and the pope is expected to preside over ceremonies throughout the year. A calendar of liturgical events can be found at www.vatican.va, the Vatican's official Web site. To avoid the most crowded times, check the dates of the various Jubilee Days -- for example, May 1 is the Jubilee Day of workers -- as well as the obvious ones like Easter.\n\nSpecial blue Jubilee buses, comfortable and air-conditioned, are running throughout the city, connecting the basilicas and important stops in between. The fare is $1, and so far the buses are not crowded.\n\nWhile tourism is expected to be higher than usual throughout the year, Holy Week in April will be especially busy, beginning on Palm Sunday (April 16) in St. Peter's Square with the commemoration of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and ending on Easter (April 23), when the pope will celebrate Mass in St. Peter's Square. On the Jubilee of Youth Day on Aug. 20, more than a million young Roman Catholics from around the world are expected to participate in a Mass with the pope at Tor Vergata, a district of Rome. The Jubilee's end will be commemorated with a Mass and the Closing of the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica on Jan. 6, 2001.\n\nExhibitions\n\nThough the spiritual may predominate, there is much in store for lovers of the arts. The following are a few of the many exhibitions that will be held in 2000. A partial schedule of art shows can be found on the city's Web site, www.comune.roma.it, as well as on the Ministry of Culture's Web site, www.beniculturali.it.\n\nThrough March 5, the Villa Medici, Viale Trinita dei Monti 1, will be host to ''Villa Medici: The Dream of a Cardinal,'' important works from the collection of Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, a great patron of 16th-century art, including paintings by Andrea del Sarto. Admission $8.50 Information: (39-06) 67611.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
