During the reign of Cosimo III de' Medici, Nasini and Giuseppe Tonelli were commissioned to fresco an Allegory of the moral and religious virtues of the Medici for the ceiling of the gallery of the Uffizi that overlooks the river Arno.\n\nIn 1691, he completed frescoes for the Compagnia di San Luca (painter's guild) in the church of Carmine in Florence, and two ceilings in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi depicting Jove unleashes thunderbolts and Hercules and Giants. He also frescoes for the Landi Chapel in the church of the Carmine.
