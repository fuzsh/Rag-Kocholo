        "text": "The Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore\n\nSanta Maria del Fiore, or the Duomo, is the cathedral church of Florence, dedicated to the Madonna of Florence. The famous cathedral dominates the skyline of Florence, with its eight white ribs against a background of terracotta tiles. The basilica is one of the largest churches in Italy and until the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed. The church's three buildings form part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic center of Florence.\n\nThe church was originally built in the 6th and 7th centuries and then reconstructed several times in the Romanesque period. In the 13th century, it was deemed necessary to build a larger cathedral to suit the city's growing population and to match the constructions of other Tuscan cities. Arnolfo di Cambio designed the new church which was finally completed around the 15th century.\n\nFirenze, Duomo\n\nThe colorful exterior walls are made from marble; white from Carrara, green from Prato, and red from Maremma. The duomo is composed of the cathedral, the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto's bell tower. The majestic dome, the greatest of Brunellesci's woks, is considered a feat of unrivaled engineering skill. Weighing 37,000 tons and containing over 4 million bricks, the dome was the largest and highest of its time. 463 steps lead to the top of the dome, which offers a spectacular view of Florence.\n\nThere are several great works of art contained in the interior of the cathedral. Notable works include busts of Brunellesci, Giotto, and Michelin, Michelino's Dante, the Condottieri memorials, a sculpture of the prophet Joshua, and Paolo Ucello's Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood.\n\nIn 1436 in the Florence cathedral, Uccello completed a monochrome fresco of an equestrian monument to Sir John Hawkwood, an English mercenary who had commanded Florentine troops at the end of the 14th century. In the Hawkwood fresco, a single-point perspective scheme, a fully sculptural treatment of the horse and rider, and a sense of controlled potential energy within the figure all indicate Uccello's desire to assimilate the new style of the Renaissance that had blossomed in Florence since his birth. Following the Hawkwood monument, in 1443 Uccello completed four heads of prophets around a colossal clock on the interior of the west façade of the cathedral; between 1443 and 1445 he contributed the designs for two stained-glass windows in the cupola.\n\nThe baptistery is one of the oldest and most famous buildings in Florence, and its east door is the most celebrated work of Lorenzo Ghiberti. The door took almost Ghiberti's entire life to complete and Michelangelo is said to have called it the Gate of Paradise.\n\nGiotto di Bondone succeeded Arnolfo di Cambio (the first Master of the Cathedral Works)\n\nupon his death in 1334, and as the famous painter and architect was 67 years old, he concentrated his energy on the Campanile. He created a design that became a showpiece of Florentine Gothic style. He probably confined himself to designing the separate Campanile which stands like a tower beside the facade. In fact Giotto's Campanile is not entirely as he designed it. Only the lower story of the bell tower was realized from Giotto's design. There, set in the pink-coloured fields of marble, are figural reliefs, whose order and number were changed by later alterations. The design of the original 21 reliefs very probably came from Giotto. They were executed by Andrea Pisano (1290-1348), Giotto's successor as capomaestro.\n\nFlorence | The Duomo of Santa Maria del Fiore\n\nAddress Piazza Duomo, Florence (FI)\n\nOpening hours\n\nOpen from 8.30 am to 7.00 pm\n\nSaturdays: 8.30 am – 5.40 pm\n\n1st Saturday: 8.30 – 4.00 pm\n\nMay 1st: 8.30 am – 5.00 pm\n\nDays of closure\n\nClosed January 1, January 6, Thu-Fri-Sat Holy Week, Easter, April 25, June 24, August 15, September 8, November 1, Mon-Tue of the first week of Advent, Christmas, December 26.\n\nFor further information visit www.operaduomo.firenze.it\n\nDante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence 1465 [1]\n\nPaolo Ucello, Funerary Monument to\n\nSir John Hawkwood\n\nChiesa di San Miniato al Monte\n\nSan Miniato al Monte faces Florence from across the Arno\n\nThe Basilica of San Miniato al Monte is one of the oldest churches in Florence and is frequently called the finest Romanesque basilica in all of Italy. The church as we know it today was started around 1018 and took over one hundred years to complete. St. Minias was possibly from Armenia and believed to have been martyred around 250 (he was beheaded during the anti-Christian persecutions of the Emperor Decius and was said to have picked up his head, crossed the Arno and walked up the hill of Mons Fiorentinus to his hermitage and buried on this hillside). The church is in a wonderful state of preservation and there are several important works inside, including a tabernacle attributed to Rossellino, the tomb of the Cardinal of Portugal with works by Rossellino, Della Robbia and others, frescoes by Agnolo Gaddi, and an amazing fresco cycle of the life of St. Benedict by Spinello Aretino, to name just some of them.\n\nThe symbol atop the pediment is a gilded copper eagle clutching a bale of wool, the symbol of the Florentine Cloth Merchants Guild who financed the building of the church and facade and administered the wealth of the Benedictine convent from 1288. This facade inspired Alberti when he completed Santa Maria Novella, and was also the inspiration for the 19th century facades for the Duomo (Santa Maria del Fiore) and Santa Croce.\n\nThe Palazzo dei Vescovi (Bishop’s Palace) was the summer residence of the\n\nBishops of Florence until it became part of the monastery in 1534.\n\nArt in Tuscany | Florence | Basilica of San Miniato al Monte\n\nSanta Maria del Carmine\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria del Carmine in Firenze\n\nSanta Maria del Carmine is a church of the Carmelite Order. It is famous for its Brancacci Chapel which houses magnificent Renaissance frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale, later finished by Filippino Lippi.\n\nThe church, dedicated to the Beatæ Virginis Mariæ de monte Carmelo, began to be built in 1268 as part of the Carmelite convent, which still exists today. Of the original edifice Some Romanesque-Gothic remains of the original structure can still be seen on the sides of the church. The complex was enlarged once in 1328 and again in 1464, when the capitular hall and the refectory were added.\n\nRenovated again in 16th-17th centuries, the church was damaged by a fire in 1771 and rebuilt internally in 1782. The façade, like many other Florentine churches, remained unfinished. The fire did not touch the sacristy and fortunately many artworks survived, including the stories of St. Cecilia attributed to Lippo d'Andrea and the marble monument of Pier Soderini by Benedetto da Rovezzano. The vault of the nave has a trompe-l'oeil fresco by Domenico Stagi.\n\nThe Brancacci Chapel also survived the fire and was also restored due to the intervention of a Florentine noblewoman who firmly opposed the covering of the frescoes. The Chapel is home to famous frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino, considered the first masterworks of the Italian Renaissance. Masaccio's master, Masolino, commissioned by a wealthy merchant, Felice Brancacci, began work on the chapel in 1425 but the project was soon taken over by his pupil whose treatment of figures in space made the frescoes among the most important to have come out of the Early Renaissance. The scenes by Masaccio are the Expulsion from Paradise, The Tribute Money St Peter Healing a Lame-Man, and St Peter Raising Tabitha from the dead. The cycle was finished by Filippino Lippi.\n\nThe Corsini Chapel of the church was built by the Corsini, probably the richest family in Florence during the 17th-18th centuries. The chapel is dedicated to St. Andrew Corsini, a Carmelite bishop of Fiesole who was canonized in 1629. The architect Pier Francesco Silvani choose a Baroque style for the chapel. The small dome was painted by Luca Giordano in 1682. The elaborated rococo ceiling is the work of one of the most important 18th century artists in the city, Giovanni Domenico Ferretti.\n\nThe convent of the church has suffered several times from numerous disasters, from the fire to the flooding of 1966. Most of the artworks are therefore damaged: these include the Bestowal of the Carmelite Rule by Filippo Lippi and the Last Supper by Alessandro Allori, and remains of works from other chapels by Pietro Nelli and Gherardo Starnina.\n\nChurches in Florence | Santa Maria del Carmine\n\nArt in Tuscany | Masaccio | Brancacci Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence\n\nSanta Maria Novella\n\nSanta Maria Novella\n\nThe decorative marble facade of Tuscany's most important Gothic church incorporates billowing sails and ostrich feathers (emblem of the Medici). The Santa Maria Novella church houses immense artistic treasures, donated by wealthy patrons, many with chapels named after them.\n\nThe old church on this site, taken over in 1219 by a group of Dominicans led by Fra Giovanni da Salerno, was called Santa Maria della Vigne (the nearby Duomo was Santa Maria del Fiore). The foundation stone of the present church was laid in October 1279, and the church was finally consecrated 140 years later in September 1420.\n\nThe exterior is the work of Fra Jacopo Talenti and Leon Battista Alberti. The interior holds extraordinary works of art including Masaccio's Trinità, Ghirlandaio's fresco cycle in the Tornabuoni Chapel and Giotto's Crucifix, among others.\n\nThe convent was built between 1279 and 1357 by Dominican friars near a 7th century church located in the fields just outside Florence's medieval walls. The lower part of the marble facade, which is Romanesque in style, is believed to have been executed by a Dominican architect, Fra Iacopo Talenti da Nipozzano, while the upper part was completed only 100 years later in 1470 by Leon Battista Alberti. Thus, the facade is not only the oldest of all the churches in Florence but it is also the only church with its original planned facade in place. As you will see, the church of San Lorenzo never even received its planned marble facade while others were completed centuries later with new designs.\n\nThe church initially had been divided into two parts - the higher part was divided by a wall and reserved for the friars while the lower part was open to the faithful that entered by the eastern side door. The wall was demolished by Vasari in the 16th century but you can clearly see where the division used to be as Giotto's Crucifix hangs right above. This also explains why the pulpit is so far down the church in the lower part.\n\nThe side door was also closed off by Vasari and was just reopened in 2000 on occasion of the Jubilee celebrations which permits once again to correctly observe Masaccio's Trinity as it was intended.\n\nThe entire church was initially covered in frescoes but these were painted over in the 16th century by Vasari when he carried out massive works ordered by Cosimo de' Medici. The Trinità was covered by a massive painting and only rediscovered around 1860 when further refurbishments were carried out.\n\nThe Trinità or Trinity by Masaccio on the far wall right in front of you as you enter the church through the side door. The Trinità (1424-25) is one of the earliest paintings to demonstrate mastery of perspective. Also notice that the Virgin Mary is not portrayed as a young girl as in so many other paintings; here, she is older and is clearly a mother.\n\nThe Crucifix by Giotto hangs in the center of the central nave as all his crucifixes were intended: with empty air all around it, you were to be reminded of Christ's actual crucifixion on the wooden cross. While it is an early work (1288-89) for Giotto, you can see his mastery in the shading on Christ's body, the waves in his hair, the blood spilling out, the details in the background tapestry.\n\nThe Strozzi Chapel, to the right of the main altar, is dedicated to St. John the Evangelist and scenes of his life are portrayed in the beautiful frescoes by Filippino Lippi. He begun working on the chapel in 1487 but then the Strozzi were exiled from Florence by the Medici. The chapel was finished only in 1502 after the Strozzi returned to the city. As Lippi dies in 1504, this is one of his last works.\n\nThe Tornabuoni Chapel is the main chapel you see at the front of the church. The altar used to be smaller and placed in the center of the chapel but was enlarged in the 19th century with the large engraved marble altar we see today. The Tornabuoni chapel is dedicated to both the Virgin Mary, to whom the church is dedicated (scenes on the left), and to St. John the Baptist (scenes on the right). The frescoes are by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his workshop, in which a very young Michelangelo apprenticed. The three young lads giving their backs to the observer in the bottom right scene \"Mary visits Saint Elizabeth\" (pictured above) are said to be his work. After restoration, the vibrant colors are still stunning and Ghirlandaio's penchant for including important people of the day in contemporary clothing make his work \"photographs\" of his days. The beauty of his work has to be personally admired to be fully appreciated.\n\nArt in Tuscany | Santa Maria Novella, Firenze\n\nThe Tornabuoni Chapel\n\nChurch of Saint Apostoli\n\nChurch of Saint Apostoli, interior\n\nThe Church of Saint Apostoli was built in the 11th century, and, though remodelled in the 15th and 16th centuries, is one of the few in the city to have maintained its High Middle Ages features. It faces the Piazza del Limbo (\"Limbo Square), so-called for it anciently housed a cemetery for children who died before having been baptized.\n\nA slab on the façade attributes the foundation to Charlemagne and his paladin Roland, in the year 800, but scholars assign it to the 11th century. A small bell tower was added by Baccio d'Agnolo in the 16th century.\n\nThe simple façade, in Romanesque style, has a portal attributed to Benedetto da Rovezzano.\n\nInterior\n\nThe plan, with a nave and two aisles with a semicircular apse, still shows Palaeo-Christian influences. It has green marble columns from Prato with capitals stripped from ancient Roman remains (the Corinthian ones probably coming from the baths existing in the area). The richly decorated wooden ceiling was added in 1333. Noteweorthy is the pavement, with a mosaic from the original edifice which was later restored with the contributions of outstanding Florentine families (Acciaioli, Altoviti and others). the apse area has maintained the Romanesque appearance, with undecorated stones visible. The side chapels are from the 16th century.\n\nIn the church are conserved some stone splinters from the Holy Sepulchre which are used as a flint to light the fire-works during the \"Scoppio del Carro\" feast on Easter Sunday, in front of the Baptistery. On the left of the apse are a polychrome terracotta tabernacle by Giovanni della Robbia, and the Tomb of Oddo Altoviti (who financed most of the reconstructions) by Benedetto da Rovezzano. The tomb of Bindo Altoviti has a bust by Bartolomeo Ammannati (1570).\n\nSanta Croce\n\nFirenze, Santa Croce\n\nSanta Croce, rebuilt for the Franciscan order in 1294 by Arnolfo di Cambio, is the burial place for the great and good in Florence. Michelangelo is buried in Santa Croce, as are Rossini, Machiavelli, and the Pisan-born Galileo Galilei, who was tried by the Inquisition and was not allowed a Christian burial until 1737, 95 years after his death.\n\nThe cenotaph dedicated to Dante Alighieri, the Florentinian poet who was sent into exile and died and is buried in Ravenna (despite some attempts to bring his body back to Florence).\n\nConstruction of the basilica began in 1294 and it was consecrated by the pope in 1442.\n\nThe church exterior is covered with a polychrome marble façade added in 1863 and paid for by the English benefactor, Sir Francis Sloane. It looks onto the Piazza Santa Croce, which is the site of the annual soccer game in medieval costume, the Calcio Storico.\n\nThere is great artistic wealth in Santa Croce; frescoes (1380) by Agnolo Gaddi in the Cappella Maggiore tell the story of the holy cross, \"santa croce\", and beautiful frescoes by Giotto in the Bardi and Peruzzi Chapels show scenes from the life of St. Francis and St. John the Evangelist.\n\nTaddeo Gaddi, one of Giotto's pupils painted the Baroncelli Chapel in the church of Santa Croce in Florence around 1328, brilliantly employing the technical achievements of his teacher. The frescoes represent Scenes from the Life of the Virgin. He also frescoed the end wall of the refectory of the church with a Last Supper, a Tree of Life and Four Miracle Scenes. An unusual relief, the Annunciation, in gilded limestone by Donatello decorates the south nave's wall. Don't miss the memorial to the 19th century playwright Giovanni Battista Niccolini to the left of the entrance said to be been the inspiration for the Statue of Liberty.\n\nOutside the Basilica di Santa Croce is this statue of Dante Alighieri, the poet who wrote The Divine Comedy and who was responsible for the development of the modern Italian language.\n\nThe church of Santa Croce was severely hit by the flood of 1966, a tide mark shows far up on the pillars and walls.\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous pieces is Cimabue's Crucifix, which was badly damaged during the 1966 flood that hit the city of Florence, but is still on display in the refectory. The basilica's cloisters are also open to the public.\n\nChurches in Tuscany | Chiesa di Santa Croce, Firenze\n\nArt in Tuscany | Cimabue\n\nSanta Croce. Agnolo Gaddi and his assistants began decorating the Great Chapel and its walls in the 1380s\n\nOrsanmichele\n\nOrsanmichele (or \"Kitchen Garden of St. Michael\", from the contraction in Tuscan dialect of the Italian word orto) was constructed on the site of the kitchen garden of the monastery of San Michele, now gone.\n\nLocated on the Via Calzaiuoli in Florence, the church was originally built as a grain market in 1337 by Francesco Talenti, Neri di Fioravante, and Benci di Cione. Between 1380 and 1404 it was converted into a church used as the chapel of Florence's powerful craft and trade guilds. On the ground floor of the square building are the 13th century arches that originally formed the loggia of the grain market. The second floor was devoted to offices, while the third housed one of the city's municipal grain storehouses, maintained to withstand famine or siege. Late in the 14th century, the guilds were charged by the city to commission statues of their patron saints to embellish the facades of the church. The sculptures seen today are copies, the originals having been removed to museums.\n\nInside the church is Andrea Orcagna's bejeweled Gothic Tabernacle (1355-59) encasing a repainting by Bernardo Daddi's of an older icon of the 'Madonna and Child'.\n\nThe facades held 14 architecturally designed external niches, which were filled from 1399 to around 1430. The three richest guilds opted to make their figures in the far more costly bronze, which cost approximately ten times the amount of the stone figures.\n\nThe Badia Fiorentina\n\nThe Badia Fiorentina, frescoes by Nardo di Cione\n\nThe high point of the early phase of Lippi's development is the Vision of St Bernard, one of the finest lyric pictures of the entire Renaissance. The painting was commissioned by Piero del Pugliese, a wealthy cloth merchant, whose portrait we see in the bottom right hand corner.\n\nSt Bernard of Clairvaux, seated at a desk with his pen poised, experiences a vision of the Virgin, who regularly had been the subject of his writings. The confrontation takes place out-of-doors (rather than in his study or in a church), enframed ingeniously by an outcropping of rock that creates a natural bench and bookshelves for the scholar. Behind Bernard, in the dark reaches of the rock, are two chained demons, while in the zone above, Cistercian monks converse or look heavenward in front of their fine Renaissance abbey. Still higher in the composition, a sick old man is being carried down toward the building. On the other side, a sweet landscape sweeps the eye into the distance.\n\nThe format of the main figural group is echoed by the stony backdrop which, roughly speaking, forms a pyramid. Also included are the donor, Francesco del Pugliese, matched pictorially on the other side by the blond angel, leaning inward, hands clasped in prayer. The colours are confident, bright, and direct, adding to the exceptional visual excitement of the painting. Mary hovers above the ground facing Bernard. Her elegant form and finely silhouetted head are not dependent upon vigorous light-to-dark juxtapositions or even, as with Botticelli, a felicitously found, heavily accented line, but rather on the operation of fragile edges. The same is true for the figure of the saint, where light, colour, and lustrous paint, presumably oil, combine to produce the desired effect. The landscape is rather flat, despite all the implications of deep space. The painting, although not dated, may have been finished by 1485, the approximate completion date for another project of considerable importance, the Brancacci Chapel frescoes.\n\nFilippino Lippi, Apparition of The Virgin to St Bernard, 1486, Church of Badia, Florence\n\nBasilica di San Lorenzo\n\nBasilica di San Lorenzo\n\nThe two Pulpits with eleven panels in the Basilica of San Lorenzo are Donatello's last works. The chronology is known because the date \"1465 adi 15 Gug\" (on 15 June 1465) was traced on the ledge of the pulpit to the left of the Torture of St Lawrence. The two bronze pulpits were the scene of Savanarola’s fire and brimstone sermons.\n\nThe pulpits are obviously the result of collaboration between Donatello and his pupils Bertoldo and Bellano. While in the Deposition from the Cross and the Entombment this collaboration is apparent - in the extremely elongated figures and the unusually high degree of finish of the reliefs - the Agony in the Garden is considered to be the part where Donatello was working alone and where his ties to his youthful style are clearly visible. Everything is permeated by Ghiberti, from the landscape to the soft line connecting the images and the groups of sleeping disciples, each one clearly defined.\n\nIt is the general consensus of art historical opinion that in these eleven panels the collaboration of the pupils played a prominent part. The bas-reliefs were first modelled in wax, and it is probable that for as long as he could, Donatello carried out this process himself. But by degrees a progressive paralysis must have limited his direct participation, forcing him to give a free hand to his helpers, though he may have continued to direct them. When he died on 13 December 1466 the two pulpits were not in place, and their final positioning, which followed a sketch made by Donatello, did not occur until 1515, when Pope Leo X visited Florence.\n\nThe reliefs on the north pulpit contain scenes of the Harrowing of Hell, The Resurrection, the Ascension, and the Martyrdom of St Lawrence. The reliefs on the south pulpit narrate the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ. The reliefs on the pulpit are extraordinary in their expressionistic, occasionally violent, portrayal of these events.\n\nArt in Tuscany | Church of San Lorenzo, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenzia and the Capella Medici\n\nArt in Tuscany | Donatello\n\nPulpit of the Resurrection, showing the\n\nDescent into Limbo, the Resurrection,\n\nand the Ascension panels.\n\nThe Pulpit of the Passion, showing\n\nthe Crucifixion and Deposition panels.\n\nThe St. Trinity Church, or Church of Santa Trinita\n\nBasilica of Santa Trinita, Florence\n\nChiesa di Ognissanti\n\nThe Chiesa di Ognissanti (All-Saints Church) is a Franciscan church in Florence, Italy. Founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, the church was dedicated to all the saints and martyrs, known and unknown.\n\nIt was completed during the 1250s, but almost completely rebuilt on Baroque designs of Bartolomeo Pettirossi, about 1627, with a façade - by Matteo Nigetti (1637) - that conserved the grand glazed terracotta lunette in the manner of the Della Robbia, now attributed to Benedetto Buglioni, over the doorway: Ognissanti was among the first examples of Baroque architecture to penetrate this Renaissance city. Its two orders of pilasters enclose niches and windows with fantastical cornices. To the left of the façade is a campanile of 13th and 14th century construction.\n\nThe Umiliati, by the dedication and probity of the lay brothers and sisters, gained a reputation in Florence, and dedicated works of art began to accumulate in their severely simple church. Giotto's celebrated Madonna and Child with angels, now in the Uffizi, was painted for the high altar, about 1310, and recently, cleaning has also revealed Giotto's hand in the Crucifix in the left transept. During the sixteenth century the Umiliati declined in energy, and the Franciscan order assumed control of the church in 1571, bringing precious relics such as the robe Saint Francis of Assisi wore.\n\nIn the interior, the Baroque remodelling, which provided a completely rebuilt apse with a pietre dure high altar and a sotto in su perspective (1770) on the vaulted nave ceiling, preserved quattrocento frescoes in the nave chapels, by Ghirlandaio and Botticelli, who is buried in the church near his beloved Simonetta Vespucci. Botticelli's fresco of Saint Augustine in his Study, balances Ghirlandaio's Saint Jerome in his Study in the chapel facing it across the navel, both executed in 1480. Perhaps the greatest of Ognissanti's frescoes is Ghirlandaio's Last Supper in the refectory between the two cloisters, a work with which Leonardo was intimately familiar.\n\nIn the Vespucci chapel, a fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio with his brother David (about 1472), of the Madonna della Misericordia protecting members of the Vespucci family, is reputed to include the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child.\n\nArt in Tuscany | Firenze | Chiesa di Ognissanti\n\nDomenico Ghirlandaio, Madonna of Mercy, c. 1472, fresco, Ognissanti, Florence\n\nLamentation over the Dead Christ, c. 1472, fresco, Ognissanti, Florence\n\nDomenico Ghirlandaio, Lamentation over the Dead Christ, about 1472, fresco, Ognissanti, Florence\n\nThe Basilica della Santissima Annunziata\n\nOne of the most beautiful piazzas in Florence, Piazza della Santissima Annunziata exemplifies the stylistic harmony of some of the greatest architects of the Renaissance. The church that gives the piazza its name, the Santissima Annunziata, lies behind the central portico of the piazza.\n\nThe Basilica della Santissima Annunziata (Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation) is a Roman Catholic minor basilica in Florence and the mother church of the Servite order. It is located at the northeastern side of the Piazza Santissima Annunziata.\n\n'One of the most highly venerated Marian shrines in Florence, the church was founded in 1250 as the Oratory of Cafaggio, by the Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order. These noble Florentines, having been vouchsafed a vision of the Virgin, retired from the city to a wild hermitage at Monte Senario, north of Florence.\n\nThe history of their new Oratory is closely connected to the cultus of a painting of the Madonna, showing the Annunciation, which is still preserved in a chapel at the entrance to the basilica. Popular piety relates that the fourteenth-century artist, a certain Friar Bartolomeo, was having difficulty in painting the face of the Virgin, when he fell asleep; on waking he found that the fresco had been finished by angelic hands. The religious fervour aroused by this reported miracle led to the church being enclosed by houses in the 14th century as people wanted to be near the place where the miracle had happened.\n\nThe present structure took shape between 1444 and 1477, when Michelozzo began the tribune with its radiating chapels, later finished by Leon Battista Alberti.\n\nThe breath-taking interior, with arches and piers sheathed in coloured marble (16th and 17th century), has a golden ceiling decorated between 1664 and 1670 to a design by Baldasarre Franceschini, known as Volterrano, who also painted the canvas of the Assumption.\n\nHigh up between the windows there are panels and medallions, painted with Miracles of the Annunciate by 17th-century artists.\n\nTo the left of the entrance is the Chapel of the Most Holy Annunciate, where the highly venerated image of the Virgin is preserved.\n\nThe elegant tempietto which encloses it was designed by Michelozzo and built by Pagno Portigiani in 1448; the small oratory next to it has a panel of the Holy Face by Andrea del Sarto.\n\nThe many side chapels in the nave are mainly of the 17th and 18th century, such as the Feroni Chapel, by Giovan Battista Foggini and others, a jewel of the Florentine baroque.\n\nThe Tribune has nine chapels which were completely transformed in the baroque period. Andrea del Castagno, one of the principal exponents of the Florentine renaissance style, was especially active in Santissima Annunziata: one of his frescoes is of St Julian, in the Feroni Chapel, another is of the Holy Trinity with St Jerome, in the adjacent chapel.'[3]\n\nSantissima Annunziata | Chiesa della SS.

Following a tradition, Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Domenico met in 1211 in the hospital that was located at the side of the church.\n\nThe church was founded in 1078 on the initiative of the noblesman Uguccione della Pressa, and was once known also under the names of Santa Lucia dei Bardi (from the most important family of the quarter) or Santa Lucia delle Rovinate (referring to the landslips of the near hill of San Giorgio).\n\nIn 15th Century the church passed under the protection of the family Da Uzzano, who had built a palace near the church palazzo (today Palazzo Capponi delle Rovinate) and subventioned the frescoes in the main chapel. Other noble families (among them, Capponi and Mozzi) contributed to the decoration of the church: their coats of arms are to be seen on the façade and in the interior of the church.\n\nSanta Lucia was frequently damaged by the landslpis of the hill of San Giorgio, and was rebuilt (and modified) in 1732, but subsequent restorations in 19th and 20th Centuries re-discovered the structure and decorations of the 15th Century. The façade was restored a few years ago.\n\nWalking in Tuscany | Florence | San Niccolo Neighbourhood in Oltrarno\n\nThe Chiesa di San Jacopo Soprarno shows elements from different periods and styles - from Romanesque to Baroque. The San Jacopo in Soprarno was built in the 10th-11th century in Romanesque style. The church experienced heavy modifications, including the addition of a triple-arched portico; the has a Romanesque 12-13th century three-arched loggia taken from San Donato in Scopeto, which was destroyed in the siege of 1529.\n\nAccording to the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, Filippo Brunelleschi built here a chapel, the Ridolfi Chapel, in which he studied, in smaller scale, architectural elements later later used in his famous dome of Santa Maria del Fiore. The chapel is now destroyed. Since 1542 it was held by Franciscans of the Minorite Order. The entrance portico was remade by order of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1580. The bell tower was designed by Gherardo Silvani in 1660.\n\nThe church was damaged when the Arno River flooded Florence in 1966. Repairs of the church after flood led to the restoration of some of the historical architectural features[1], and the discover of columns belonging to the original Romanesque church in the Baroque interior.\n\nChiesa di San Jacopo Soprarno\n\nThe Basilica della Santissima Annunziata (Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation\n\n) stands in a Renaissance piazza with rounded porticoes and fine decoration. In the center, there is the equestrian statue of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I, a work from 1608 by Pietro Tacca who was responsible for the very original bronze fountains alongside. The church itself was founded in 1260 to be the Oratory of the Servants of Mary. However, it was very soon renovated and enlarged because of growing devotion to the fresco of the Annunciation. The present church is preceded by a portico that leads you into the so-called \"small cloister of votive tablets\" and you pass from here into the main church which consists of one single nave with side chapels and a large round tribune at the end.\n\nThe interior was reconstructed in the mid 15th century, and renewed again in the second half of the 17th in a sumptuous Baroque style. Particularly worthy of note is the wooden ceiling, decorated in gold with paintings and precious in-lay carvings.\n\nThe front piece of the high altar is a splendid work in silver made by the Grand Duke's silversmith, Cosimo Merlini, an artist with Baroque tastes.\n\nBasilica della Santissima Annunziata\n\nThis Chiostro dello Scalzo forms the entrance to the chapel of the Confraternity of the Disciplinati of St John the Baptist, known as the Cloister of the Scalzo, founded in 1376.\n\nAt various intervals between 1509 and 1526, the great Florentine artist Andrea del Sarto painted the walls with frescoes depicting Scenes from the life of St John the Baptist and the Virtues, except for two episodes that were painted by Franciabigio.\n\nIt is called \"dello Scalzo\" (barefoot) because the friar holding the cross used to go barefoot. The Chiostro dello Scalzo really shows Andrea del Sarto's painting path: it is an absolute masterpiece in the constant dialogue of space, architecture and figures highlighted by the use of monochrome.\n\nAddress: Chiostro dello Scalzo, Via Cavour 69.\n\nOpen Mon, Tue, Sat 8,15am-1.50pm.\n\nAdmission: free.\n\nChoistro dello Scalzo, Florence\n\nThe Chiesa Santo Stefano al Ponte is a church in Florence.

The interior is rectangular, and originally had three aisles, which were merged into a single nave by F. Tacca between 1649 and 1655. The roof has exposed trellisbeams that are at two different elevations.\n\nThe church has now been deconsecrated, and hosts the Orchestra Regionale Toscana."
