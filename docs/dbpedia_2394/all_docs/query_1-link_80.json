        "text": "Florence in March - Make the most of your trip!\n\nComing to Florence in March?\n\nPlan for it to be a little chilly and rainy.\n\nAfter all, March is still mostly a winter month.\n\nBut it's also the calm before the storm.\n\nThe crowds are not quite here yet, but they are on the way.\n\nMarch in Florence - at a glance\n\nHere's what you need to know about coming to visit Florence this time of year:\n\nWhat's the weather like? Does it rain a lot?\n\nWhat to pack for visiting Florence in March? What to wear?\n\nIs March a good time to visit Florence?\n\nWhat food is in season in March?\n\nWhat are some things to do in Florence in March?\n\nMarch weather in Florence Italy\n\nI've lived in Italy since 2001.\n\nIt never fails.\n\nEvery single year, on March 1, I somehow expect it to be spring, because \"March is a spring month.\"\n\nThe reality is that it's never spring in the beginning of March (spring technically begins on March 20.)\n\nI am always chagrined to find the beginning of March full of blustery cold days, with plenty of rain and sometimes sleet.\n\nThe cooler period in Florence lasts from November through to March so it is not as warm as I want it to be!\n\nAnd I think this is one reason the beginning of March is still low season.\n\nIt is, after all, still winter.\n\nAnd school vacations are not in swing yet.\n\nBut there is inevitably one day in March - it changes from year to year - sometime late in the first half, when I start seeing school groups all around Florence.\n\nAnd then I know.\n\nThe arrival of spring and pleasant weather is coming, and high season is just around the corner.\n\nAs for rain, well yes, March can be a rainier month than others, because it's spring/pre-spring.\n\nBut it's hit or miss, and sometimes you just have glorious blue-sky days.\n\nSimilar to what happens when it rains in Rome, you can usually go out in the rain in Florence. You'll find you have more sites to yourself, and sometimes you can get stunning pix like puddle reflections or dramatic sunsets.\n\nThe weather in March is on the cooler side, especially at the start of the month with lows (at night) averaging 40-44 Fahrenheit/4-6 Celsius, and highs of about 54-58 Fahrenheit/12-14 Celsius.\n\nTowards the end of the month spring is in the air, with the average temperature reaching highs of 16-18 Celsius/60-64 Fahrenheit during the day.\n\nWhat to pack for Florence in March\n\nPacking tips for March in Florence\n\nWhen packing for Florence in March be sure to think about layers.\n\nThe weather can be a bit unsettled, going from sunshine to rain showers very quickly so it's best to be prepared!\n\nIf the sun is shining it can feel warm so pack a mix of lighter and heavier layers, as well as a good raincoat or waterproof jacket to keep you dry if it does start raining unexpectedly.\n\nI always recommend bringing a rain-hat, which is small and light and easy to pop in your bag.\n\nI would also suggest bringing a quality travel umbrella along with a waterproof jacket or coat.\n\nThese are my personal recommendations for packing for Florence in March:\n\nAffiliate Disclosure:\n\nBelow you see photos of products I've researched and in some cases, own. If you click the picture, it will take you to Amazon.com, and if you purchase anything there, I will earn a small commission.\n\nPlease rest assured, the prices are the same whether you click from here or buy directly.\n\nThanks for supporting my site!\n\nThe weather in Florence in March can be very iffy at times, with rain showers, and sometimes even hail appearing out of nowhere! A rain hat like this quilted one is ideal as it is small and warm, yet so lightweight you can easily pop it in your bag and have it ready in case of an unexpected rain shower.\n\nThis waterproof rain hat is similar to the one Alessandro wears when walking around Florence. When it's raining, he doesn't leave home without it!\n\nI own these e-tip gloves and just love them. They are perfect for cold weather, and I can keep them on while I use my phone to make calls or take pictures. I've washed them more than once, and they still look brand new.\n\nA scarf should be on your packing list whenever you visit Florence.In winter and early spring, I find that a large pashmina such as this one is a better option compared to a regular scarf, as it can be used in multiple ways. I prefer to go for a scarf with a blend of cashmere and silk because it's not too hot, and also doesn't make me itch.\n\nThe best jacket you can wear when sight-seeing in Florence in March is a waterproof hiking jacket, with removable lining, unless you have an event or fancy dinner. I have several of these jackets which are mainly worn when I go hiking, but I also wear them during the winter and early spring when it can be colder than you might expect!\n\nThis is a men's version of the same type of jacket: waterproof, sporty, and with removable lining. It's actually 3 jackets in one so this is perfect for including in your March packing for Florence!\n\nI will always bring a good travel umbrella with me wherever I travel. I can highly recommend including one in your packing for Florence - you can always buy one here if you forget, but the quality likely won't be as good. I love mine, that has features like wind-resistant ribs, and a cool open AND close button.\n\nHeavy cotton pants or comfortable jeans are an excellent idea for men, women, and children alike.\n\nA warm cardigan, pullover, or turtleneck is a good idea as well. Even when you take off your jacket, you will still stay warm and cozy.\n\nAnother handy thing to pack for rainy weather in Florence is a light rain poncho. I've seen so many people shelling out money to street vendors when it rains unexpectedly. Bring your own and come prepared!\n\nWhen packing for Florence in March, don't forget to include the following items in your packing list:\n\nWarm, comfortable socks\n\nLip balm or chapstick\n\nGeneral Florence packing tips\n\nWhat else do you need to consider when packing for Florence in March?\n\nThese are a few of my essential packing recommendations, any time of year:\n\nDisclosure : If you make a purchase through a link on this page, I may receive a small commission - at no extra cost to you. Thank you for supporting my site!\n\nSunglasses! Yes it can be rainy in Florence occasionally, but the sun will be shining more often than not so you'll want a good pair of sunglasses.\n\nAny medications you take, along with a list of these medications. I would recommend keeping these with you in your carry-on in a dedicated organizer, rather than packing them in your checked luggage.\n\nPhotocopies or clear photographs saved on your phone of your passport - much safer than carrying your actual passport around Florence!\n\nPlug converters for your dual-voltage appliances. Voltage in Italy is 220, and in the US and some other countries, it's 110. Most electronic devices will default to dual voltage, but you will need a plug adapter as the plug shapes are different here. This universal adapter covers you in multiple locations, perfect for travel to different parts of the world.\n\nCarrying a well-stocked first-aid kit gives you peace of mind when traveling. I always like having one with me when I travel, it’s very handy for when you need something quickly.\n\nFinally, travel insurance isn't something to pack per se, but it is something you should not forget!\n\nIt is not uncommon these days for visitors to have to deal with lost luggage or cancelled or delayed flights, and your credit card coverage may not be as extensive as you think.\n\nChances are you are not covered for what you need when these things happen!\n\nWhat to wear in Florence in March\n\nSo how should you dress when you visit Florence in March?\n\nYou will probably be walking a lot, so you need comfortable shoes.\n\nRule 1: Be Comfortable!\n\nMy number one rule for sightseeing in Florence, at any time of year: be comfortable.\n\nThis is most important when it comes to your shoes. It is crucial to wear good walking shoes, and good quality socks.\n\nI would recommend only bringing shoes you have already broken in, and don’t worry about looking like a tourist - that’s exactly what you are!\n\nRule 2: Dress in Layers\n\nThe next rule, which is very appropriate for March is: dress in layers.\n\nSince the weather in Florence can vary a good deal from day to day, as well as from day to night, it's essential to wear breathable layers that you can remove/put on easily such as light cotton t-shirts, cardigans/pullovers/jumpers and waterproof jackets.\n\nI would also recommend wearing a backpack as you travel around the city center, so you can have a place to put your layers if you take them off, along with your umbrella or rain hat ready in case it rains.\n\nBottom line, when packing for Florence in March, don't forget to:\n\nWear good walking shoes\n\nDress in jeans or heavy cotton pants\n\nWear a light cotton top with a sweater/cardigan\n\nBring a waterproof coat/jacket\n\nBring a rain hat and/or an umbrella\n\nLast but not least, don't forget the Italian MUST WEAR - a scarf. Always a scarf.\n\nIf you are planning to go to an event, for example a wedding, opera or dinner at a special restaurant, then you may wish to bring something elegant to wear.\n\nOtherwise, it is fine to wear more casual clothes to eat out at many restaurants in Florence so you do not need to pack much, if any, evening-wear.\n\nIs March a good time to visit Florence?\n\nI know I'm biased and think every month is a great time to come to Florence, but March is definitely a good choice!\n\nHow crowded is Florence during March?\n\nThe first half of March will still be winter-cold, certainly at night.\n\nAnd March is a rainy month, so be prepared.\n\nBut in those first two weeks, it's also still fairly quiet in Florence.\n\nIf you want to visit Florence on a budget, you will find great deals on accommodations in the beginning of March.\n\nNot a lot is happening just yet.\n\nIf you come the second two weeks, be prepared for crowds, in particular school groups.\n\nThis does not mean it's a bad time to come to Florence!\n\nBut you should plan for it, and book some things ahead like Santa Croce, the Uffizi Gallery and the Duomo.\n\nFlorence Seasonal Food in March\n\nIt is still artichoke season (globe artichokes), but you will also still see plenty of winter greens too: broccoletti, broccolo romanesco, and chicory.\n\nAsparagus and strawberries are also starting to show up.\n\nThere is also a very particular green to get in early spring: agretti.\n\nAgretti look like grass, taste like spinach, and are a very seasonal, very Italian green.\n\nTry it with pasta, in omelettes or quiche, or simply sautéed and served as an accompaniment to Florentine steak!\n\nWhat to do during March in Florence\n\nMarch holidays and special dates in Florence 2025\n\nSpecial dates in March include International Women's Day, the Feast of the Annunciation, Father's Day and for 2025, Easter.\n\nMARCH 8 - INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\nInternational Women's Day or Festa della Donna on March 8th is a major international holiday around the world (for some reason that escapes me, it's barely heard of in the U.S.).\n\nAlthough it's not a bank holiday, it's still widely recognized.\n\nThe tradition is to give some yellow mimosa flowers to the women in your life.\n\nIn early March, you will see a lot of these yellow flowers for sale in Florence.\n\nOn this day, Florence's civic and state museums are free for women.\n\nMARCH 17 - SAINT PATRICK'S DAY\n\nSaint Patrick's Day is not a huge celebration in Florence, but you will find plenty of bars and Irish pubs in the city center getting in on the Irish spirit!\n\nMARCH 19 - FATHER'S DAY\n\nIn Italian it's called La Festa di San Giuseppe.\n\nGiuseppe is Italian for Joseph and of course the day celebrating fathers here is named for the one of the most famous fathers, at least in Catholic history.\n\nWhy is this important if you're visiting Florence?\n\nBecause you will want to load up on some fritelle, sweet fried dough balls made only at this time of year!\n\nmarch 25 - feast of the annunciation\n\nTraditionally the New Year in Florence was celebrated on the Catholic Feast of the Annunciation, March 25.\n\nFlorentines would come together in the Piazza Santissima Annunizata to commemorate the beginning of spring, as well as the date the angel Gabriel told Mary about her divine pregnancy (exactly 9 months before Christmas).\n\nWhen the Gregorian calendar was adopted in 1541, the Florentine people refused to change their New Year celebrations to January 1 and continued to celebrate as they had always done.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1700's that Florence finally got on the same calendar as the rest of Europe, but the remembrance of the March date lived on, and today the city officially marks the 'New Year' every year on March 25.\n\nNowadays you will find the Piazza Santissima Annunizata full of stalls around March 25, selling all sorts of items.\n\nYou can also attend a special morning mass in the church on the piazza - be aware that this is very popular with the locals so plan ahead!\n\nLAST WEEKEND OF MARCH - DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME BEGINS\n\nThe last Sunday of March is the beginning of Daylight Saving Time in Europe (this date differs from the U.S. and some other parts of the world).\n\nWe LOSE one hour.\n\nIn 2025, we set our clocks ahead on the night of Saturday March 29 at 2:00 AM (March 30.)\n\nBe aware of this if you have any Sunday morning plans like a tour or flight.\n\ncarnival sunday and Fat TUESDAY\n\nIn 2025 some of the Easter celebrations take place in March.\n\nCarnival Sunday is on March 2 and Fat Tuesday is on March 4.\n\nFind out all about Easter in Florence with our dedicated page!\n\nCurrent exhibits and events at Florence's museums in March\n\nThe cooler winter months are a great time to take in the arts indoors. Some of the city's museums stay open later on the weekends.\n\nThere are several Florence events in March 2025 at various locations around the city:\n\nFlorence Concerts, Operas and other shows on in March\n\nThere are lots of concerts and other events available to book for your trip to Florence in March - take a look at some of our suggestions here:\n\nFree Things to do in Florence in March\n\nOn the first Sunday of each month you can access Florence's state museums, archeological parks and cultural sites for free - yes, completely free!\n\nThis includes the Uffizi Gallery, Palazzo Pitti, Boboli Gardens, Accademia Gallery and many more.\n\nThese free entrance events are very popular, so plan to arrive early to be sure you get in.\n\nMore ideas for things to do in Florence in March\n\nMaybe it's your 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) time in Florence.\n\nOr you have more than 3 days here, or you just want to see and do lots of fun things.\n\nBesides the obvious must-see tourist attractions, there are lots of great things to see and do in Florence!"
