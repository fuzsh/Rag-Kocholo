        "text": "A Calendar of Saints\n\nThe Temptation of St Anthony (c. 1494) by Bernardino Parenzano, Galleria Doria Pamphilj\n\nJanuary 17th: Feast of St Anthony Abbot\n\nSt Anthony Abbot (c. 251-356), also known as St Anthony the Great, is regarded as the father of monasticism. As a young man, he distributed all his belongings to the poor and set off into the Egyptian desert. There he lived alone for two decades, striving to overcome all temptations of the flesh. His struggles with temptations, which he called his 'demons', have been the subject of many works of art. He acquired such a reputation for spiritual strength that many came to live near him.\n\nIn art, St Anthony Abbot is portrayed wearing the robe and hood of a monk; his main attributes are a pig, a bell and a Tau Cross.\n\nSt Anthony Abbot is invoked by people with skin diseases. In the past, many such afflictions, including ergotism, erysipelas and shingles, were referred to as St Anthony's fire.\n\nTowards the end of the 11th century, circa 1095, the Hospitallers of St Anthony was founded by Gaston of Valloire, with the express purpose of caring for those suffering from St Anthony's fire. The Hospitallers of St Anthony, also known as the Antonines, raised pigs, as pork fat was used to alleviate the inflammation and itching. By a special papal dispensation, the Order's pigs were allowed to roam freely in the streets.\n\nSt Anthony has left a trace on the English language with the word 'tantony', the name given to the runt in a litter of pigs.\n\nSt Sebastian by Giuseppe Giorgetti, San Sebastiano fuori le Mura\n\nJanuary 20th: Feast of St Sebastian\n\nAccording to legend, Sebastian was an officer in the elite Praetorian Guard during the reign of the emperor Diocletian (r. 284-305). He was condemned to death for being a Christian and was ordered to be shot with arrows. He was left for dead by his executioners, but was nursed back to health by a widow named Irene. Sebastian returned to confront the emperor with a renewed avowal of his faith and this time he was beaten to death with clubs. His body was then thrown into the Cloaca Maxima, the main sewer of Rome.\n\nThe ancient church of San Sebastiano Fuori le Mura (St Sebastian Outside the Walls) is built over what is believed to be his burial place in the catacombs on the Via Appia.\n\nThe church of San Sebastiano al Palatino stands on the putative site of the saint's 'first' martyrdom.\n\nIn art, St Sebastian is depicted semi-naked, his body pierced with arrows. He is the patron saint of soldiers and archers. St Sebastian was also commonly invoked as a protector against the plague. ​\n\nSt Agnes, Sant' Agnese in Agone\n\nJanuary 21st: Feast of St Agnes\n\nSt Agnes lived in Rome during the reign of the emperor Diocletian (r. 284-305).\n\nAt the age of thirteen, she declared herself to be a bride of Christ and refused to marry the son of the Prefect of Rome, who was in love with her. The Prefect tried to make her change her mind, by having her taken to a brothel where she was stripped naked. She prayed to Christ for help and her hair grew to great length, covering the whole of her body. The Prefect then ordered her to be burned alive, but she stood unharmed in the midst of the flames. Finally, a soldier was ordered to cut off her head with his sword.\n\nThe 17th century church of Sant' Agnese in Agone is built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian, once a popular haunt of prostitutes. The 9th century church of Sant' Agnese fuori le Mura, is built above the catacombs where she was buried.\n\nIn art, St Agnes is depicted with a white lamb, a symbol of purity.\n\nThe Dream of St Joseph by Domenico Guidi, Santa Maria della Vittoria\n\nMarch 19th: Feast of St Joseph\n\nSt Joseph, husband of Mary, was a carpenter in Nazareth. He is often depicted with a flowering staff, a reference to the legend that when the Virgin Mary was fourteen years old each of her suitors left a staff at the Temple hoping for a sign to indicate which of them was favoured by God. In the morning Joseph's staff was discovered budding into leaf.\n\nIn art, a flowering staff is St Jospeh's main attribute. He is the patron saint of carpenters and fathers.\n\nSt Mark by Isaia da Pisa, San Marco\n\nApril 25th: Feast of St Mark the Evangelist\n\n​St Mark was the travelling companion of Paul and Barnabas on St Paul's first missionary journey. He is said to have later travelled to Alexandria, where he founded the first Christian community in the city. It was in Alexandria that he was martyred. Centuries later his body was stolen by Venetian sailors and taken to Venice, where he became its patron saint.\n\nSt Mark's main attribute is a winged lion.\n\nTomb of St Catherine of Siena, Santa Maria sopra Minerva\n\nApril 29th: Feast of St Catherine of Siena\n\nSt Catherine of Siena (1347-80) was a mystic and a lay member of the Dominican Order. St Catherine had a strong influence on Pope Gregory XI's decision to return to Rome from Avignon in 1378, thus bringing to an end the so-called 'Babylonian captivity of the Papacy'.\n\nSt Catherine, who is interred in the Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, was canonised by Pope Pius II (r. 1458-64) on April 29th 1461.\n\nSt Philip Neri by Alessandro Algardi, Chiesa Nuova\n\nMay 26th: Feast of St Philip Neri\n\nSan Filippo Neri (1515-85), commonly called the second apostle of Rome, was the founder of the Congregation of the Oratory, better known as the Oratorians.\n\nSt Philip Neri, who is interred in the Chiesa Nuova, was canonised by Pope Gregory XV (r. 1621-23) on March 12th 1622.\n\nSt Anthony of Padua by Benozzo Gozzoli, Santa Maria in Aracoeli\n\nJune 13th: Feast of St Anthony of Padua\n\nSt Anthony was born, on August 15th 1195, in the Portuguese city of Lisbon. He died, on June 13th 1231, in the Italian city of Padua, where he is buried. Less than a year later, on May 30th 1232, St Anthony was canonised by Pope Gregory IX (r. 1227-41).\n\nSt Anthony of Padua is the patron saint of, inter alia, lost things, lost people and lost souls.\n\nIn art, St Anthony is most often depicted holding the Christ Child and/or a lily. He is less frequently portrayed holding a flaming heart.\n\nHead of St John the Baptist by Igor Mitoraj, Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri\n\nJune 24th: Feast of The Nativity of St John the Baptist\n\n​St John the Baptist forms a link between the Old and New Testaments, as he is regarded as the last in line of the Old Testament prophets and the first of the saints of the New Testament, in which his story is told. John was the son of Zacharias, a priest of the Temple, and Elizabeth, a relation of the Virgin.\n\nJohn was a preacher, who baptised, in the river Jordan, all who came to him in a penitent spirit. At the baptism of Christ, the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove was seen to descend from heaven.\n\nJohn rebuked Herod Antipas (son of Herod the Great) for marrying his dead brother's wife. He was imprisoned and later beheaded, the result of a rash promise that Herod made to his step-daughter Salome.\n\nIn art, St John the Baptist holds a lamb, which may have a cruciform nimbus. The lamb refers to the fourth gospel: \"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!\" (John 1:36).\n\nSt Peter & St Paul, Palazzo del Quirinale\n\nJune 29th: Feast of St Peter and St Paul\n\n​St Peter, 'the Prince of the Apostles', was a fisherman from Galilee, and the brother of Andrew. Peter and Andrew were called to be 'fishers of men' (Matthew 4:16). St Peter's special attribute is a pair of keys: 'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven' (Matthew 16:19). His other attributes are an upturned Cross and a cockerel.\n\nSt Paul was born Saul, a Jew from Tarsus, circa 10 CE. He was converted to Christianity while on the road to Damascus. His attributes are a sword, with which he was executed, and a book or scroll.\n\n​\n\nSt Peter and St Paul are the patron saints of Rome.\n\nSt Thomas by Pierre Legros the Younger, San Giovanni in Laterano\n\nJuly 3rd: Feast of St Thomas the Apostle\n\nSt Thomas, also called Didymus (twin), is popularly known as 'doubting Thomas'. His main attribute is a builder's set-square.\n\n​\n\nSt Thomas was absent when Christ first appeared to the disciples after his death. When told about the Resurrection, Thomas refused to believe it until he had seen Christ for himself. Christ appeared again when Thomas was with them and said to him, 'Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed' (John: 20:27).\n\n​\n\nSt Thomas is the patron saint of builders and architects.\n\nSt Benedict, Abbazia delle Tre Fontane\n\nJuly 11th: Feast of St Benedict\n\n​Benedict of Nursia (480-547) was a monk who founded the Benedictine Order. Benedict penned (circa 530) a set of rules, the famous Regula Sancti Benedicti, for his fellow monks to follow.\n\n​St Benedict is acclaimed as the 'Father of Western Monasticism'.\n\nSt Mary Magdalene, facade of Santa Maria Maddalena\n\nJuly 22nd: Feast of St Mary Magdalene\n\nMary, who came from the village of Magdal, near the Lake of Galilee, was the woman 'out of whom came seven devils' (Luke 8:2). This may mean that she had epilepsy, which, at the time, was attributed to demonic possession. Mary Magdalene witnessed the crucifixion; saw where Jesus' body was laid; and was the first person to whom the risen Christ appeared (Mark 16:9).\n\nSt James the Greater by Camillo Rusconi, San Giovanni in Laterano\n\nJuly 25th: Feast of St James the Greater\n\nSt James was the son of Zebedee, a fisherman from Galilee, and the brother of John. He was among the circle of men closest to Christ, being with Peter and John at the Transfiguration.\n\nSt James is generally portrayed wearing the pilgrim's broad-brimmed hat and cloak, on either of which appears his special attribute, a scallop shell. ​\n\nVirgin and Child with St Anne by Andrea Sansovino, Sant' Agostino\n\nJuly 26th: Feast of St Anne\n\n​According to tradition, St Anne was the mother of the Virgin Mary.\n\n​St Anne is the patron saint of women in labour.\n\nSt Ignatius Loyola by Camillo & Giuseppe Rusconi, St Peter's Basilica\n\nJuly 31st: Feast of St Ignatius of Loyola\n\nIn 1539, St Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), the Spanish soldier-turned-priest, founded the Society of Jesus, better known as the Jesuits. He died in Rome on July 31st 1556. He was canonised by Pope Gregory XV (r. 1621-23) on March 12th 1622.\n\nSt Ignatius is interred in the Chiesa del Gesù, the mother church of the Jesuits.\n\nA detail of the facade of the church of Santi Domenico e Sisto\n\nAugust 8th: Feast of St Dominic\n\nSt Dominic (1170-1221), who was born in Spain of noble parentage, was the founder of the Dominican Order, also known as the Order of Preachers.\n\nIn art, St Dominic is depicted wearing the habit of his Order, a white tunic under a black hooded cloak. He may hold a lily, a sign of chastity, and a book (the Gospels). He is also often represented as a dog with a flaming torch in its mouth, a pun on the name of his Order : Domini Canis (Dog of the Lord).\n\nSt Dominic, who was canonised by Pope Gregory IX (r. 1227-41) on July 13th 1234, is the patron saint of astronomers.\n\nSt Lawrence by Stefano Galletti, San Lorenzo fuori le Mura\n\nAugust 10th: Feast of St Lawrence\n\nSt Lawrence was ordained deacon by Pope Sixtus II (r. 257-58) and was executed shortly after, on the orders of Emperor Valerian (r. 253-60) in 258.\n\nAccording to legend, St Lawrence's death was particularly gruesome; he was roasted alive on a gridiron. At one point during his ordeal he is said to have remarked: 'Turn me over, I'm done on this side!', a wry observation that led to him becoming the patron saint of both cooks and comedians.\n\nWhat purports to be the gridiron on which St Lawrence was martyred is kept in the ancient church of San Lorenzo in Lucina.\n\nSt Bartholomew by Michelangelo, The Last Judgement, Sistine Chapel\n\nAugust 24th: Feast of St Bartholomew\n\nThe New Testament mentions Bartholomew only by name, but says nothing about his life.\n\nIn art, his attribute is a knife, for according to the Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend, c.1259-66), he was martyred by being flayed alive. St Bartholomew is generally depicted with his flayed skin draped over his arm.\n\nSt Bartholomew is the patron saint of tanners and dermatologists. The saint's relics are preserved in the church of Sant' Bartolomeo all' Isola.\n\nSt Augustine Defeating Heresy, Sant' Agostino\n\nAugust 28th: Feast of St Augustine of Hippo\n\nSt Augustine (354-430), theologian, one of the four Fathers of the Latin Church, and author of The City of God, was bishop of Hippo Regius in the Roman province of Numidia (modern-day Tunisia).\n\nSt Augustine's mother, Santa Monica, is interred in the church of Sant' Agostino in Campo Marzio.\n\nIn art, St Augustine is commonly portrayed with a mitre and a crozier. His attribute is a flaming heart, a symbol of religious fervour.\n\nSt Matthew and the Angel by Caravaggio, Contarelli Chapel, San Luigi dei Francesi\n\nSeptember 21st: Feast of St Matthew the Evangelist\n\nSt Matthew was a tax-gatherer from Capernaum and, by tradition, the author of the first gospel.\n\nSt Matthew's attribute is a winged figure resembling an angel, who may be seen dictating as the saint writes. St Matthew generally has a book, pen and an inkhorn, the standard attributes of a writer.\n\nSt Michael the Archangel by Peter Anton Verschaffelt, Castel Sant' Angelo\n\nSeptember 29th: Feast of St Michael the Archangel\n\nSt Michael appears in the Book of Revelation (12:7): 'And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him'.\n\nIn art, St Michael wears a coat of mail and is armed with a shield and a sword or spear.\n\nSt Francis of Assisi (1927) by Giuseppe Tonnini, Piazza di Porta San Giovanni\n\nOctober 4th: Feast of St Francis of Assisi\n\nSt Francis of Assisi (1181/2-1226), one of the most venerated figures in Christianity, founded the Order of Franciscans.\n\n​\n\nSt Francis was canonised by Pope Gregory IX on July 16th 1228.\n\nIn art, St Francis is portrayed in a brown habit with a rope around the waist. The rope has three knots, symbolising the Franciscan's vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. His hands and feet bear the stigmata, the wounds of Christ.\n\nSt Luke by Francesco Fabi-Altini, San Paolo fuori le Mura\n\nOctober 18th: Feast of St Luke the Evangelist\n\nSt Luke was described by St Paul as the 'beloved physician', but he does not appear in art in this role. As he was thought to have been an artist, he is portrayed as such, generally painting an image of the Virgin.\n\nSt Luke's main attribute is a winged ox.\n\nSt Cecilia by Stefano Maderno, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere\n\nNovember 28th: Feast of St Cecilia\n\nSt Cecilia (third century virgin and martyr), who is the patron saint of musicians, is interred in the church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.\n\nSt Andrew by Francois Duquesnoy, St Peter's Basilica\n\nNovember 30th: Feast of St Andrew the Apostle\n\nThe brother of Peter, and the first to follow Christ, St Andrew is usually portrayed as an old man, bearded and white-haired. His main attribute is a saltire, an X-shaped cross.\n\nSt Andrew is the patron saint of fishermen.\n\nSt Barbara, Santa Barbara dei Librai\n\nDecember 4th: Feast of St Barbara\n\nAs a young woman, St Barbara, who is said to have lived in the 3rd century, was locked up in a tower by her possessive father, a pagan who feared she might marry and leave home. Hearing of Christianity, she became interested and invited a Christian disciple disguised as a physician. As a result of the visit, she converted and was baptised. Realising that the tower only had two windows, she arranged for a third to be added when her father was absent.\n\nOn her father's return, she confessed her faith and explained that the soul received light through three windows: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Enraged by her conversion, the father handed her over to the authorities, who had her tortured. He then asked for permission to cut off the head of his own daughter, which he duly did. As he returned home, having committed this awful deed, he was suddenly struck dead by a bolt of lightning. As a result of this punishment, St Barbara became the patron saint of gunners and fire workers. She is also invoked against accidents and sudden death.\n\nSt Barbara's main attribute is a tower, usually one with three windows.\n\nSt Lucy by Innocenzo Spinazzi & Ferdinando Lisandroni, Santa Lucia del Gonfalone\n\nDecember 13th: Feast of St Lucy\n\nSt Lucy, a virgin and martyr from Syracuse in Italy, died (circa 304) during the emperor Diocletian's persecutions of the Christians.\n\nSt Lucy's main attribute is a pair of eyes, which lie on a dish or sprout like flowers from a stalk in her hand. According to legend, St Lucy plucked out her eyes and sent them to a unwanted suitor who would not cease from praising their beauty. God rewarded her with a new pair. It is not hard to see (no pun intended!) why St Lucy became the patron saint of opticians.\n\nThe Stoning of St Stephen by Fra Angelico, Cappella Niccolina\n\nDecember 26th: Feast of St Stephen\n\nSt Stephen is regarded as the first martyr, or 'protomartyr'. He was stoned to death after arousing the anger of the Sanhedrin with his sermon which, accused them of having murdered the Messiah, whose coming their prophets had foretold.\n\nIn art, St Stephen's attribute is a handful of stones, which usually rest on his head or shoulders. He is appealed to for relief by people suffering from headaches.\n\nSt John the Evangelist, Santa Maria in Aracoeli"
