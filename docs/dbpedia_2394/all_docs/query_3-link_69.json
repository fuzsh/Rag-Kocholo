The new 1 has prove Just as d namic as Mattei's- and the present center-left government in Rome, except for a new law providing greater scrutiny of the budget, has allowed ENI a relatively free hand. Premier Moro and his ministers are pre- occupied with more pressing problems, and ENI con- tinues to enjoy a certain immunity from criticism because it has been so consistently successful. Still expanding, at home and abroad, ENI has continued its efforts to increase trade with the USSR and to im- prove relations with US and other foreign oil com- panies, and it has been even more energetic in push- ing its African ventures than in Mattei's day. Mattei's Legacy Italy's emergence on the international oil scene was largely Mattei's personalachieve- ment. Named by the then Premier de Gasperi in 1945 to dispose of the Fascist government's almost bankrupt oil monopoly, AGIP, Mattei instead immediately stepped up explorations in defiance of Rome. The discovery of enormous deposits of natural gas in the Po valley in 1946 vindicated his stand and led eventually to the creation of ENI, a complex which now includes more than 75 com- panies and is still growing. Thereafter Mattei and a succes- sion of Italian governments seemed to agree that \"what is good for ENI is good for Italy.\" Mattei ran ENI virtually as a private empire, subsidized newspapers, and made big contributions to most of the political parties. He was considered by many to be the most powerful man in Italy. In a few years' time, ENI greatly reduced Italy's depend- ence on fuel imports. Fuel marketed by ENI now satisfies half of Italy's total energy needs. By building its refin- ery at Gela in Sicily and other industrial installations in the South, ENI has also made a major contribution toward rehabilita- tion of that region, which is one of Italy's principal eco- nomic objectives. The varied operations of ENI, with a multi- billion-dollar yearly turnover, include a sizable tanker fleet and a machine-tool business which produces most of the drill- ing and other equipment needed by the national oil industry.

While a heavy financial contributor to the Christian Democratic Party, Mattei also contributed to most of the others. Little is known of Cefis' activities in this re- gard, but he has reportedly halted such subsidies by ENI and is not expected to renew them on the Mattei scale. Cefis' personal preferences appear to lie with the Socialists or the Social Democrats. In the last analysis, however, he is a businessman and would probably work with any democratic govern- ment except perhaps one including the Liberals, who might be in- clined to try to break up ENI. Current ENI Financial Status ENI's annual account for the period 1 May 1962-30 April 1963 25X1 showed a profit of only $388,400 Reorganization of ENI's administration, however, would open many problems for Premier Moro, who is already overburdened with Italy's current economic taining harmony among the four parties of his coalition--each of which might seek a share of any senior jobs that might become available in the process.

This apparently sudden drop was partially attributable to the reduction in dividends paid to the holding company by ENI's operating subsidiaries, partic- ularly the marketing company, AGIP. The main pipeline com- pany, SNAM, distributed no divi- dends. The profit drop is also partially explained by ENI's current efforts to stress a self- financing policy geared to the present tight money market in Italy and to retaining more capital by increased deprecia- tion allowances. The company needs a large amount of capital to carry out the programs it has mapped out for the next few years, and estimates of its lia- bilities range from $100 million to a high of $1 billion. However, the real drop in profits may not have been so sharp as shown. The US Embassy notes that in Mattei's day the records of profit and loss were \"notoriously unrevealing\"; cur- rent accounting probably is more candid, but still not completely indicative of the financial pic- ture. ENI is still believed to have a healthy cushion of profits each year from its Po valley natural gas monopoly, although a declining rate of production in these fields is said to have set in, and this source of funds is expected to diminish greatly over the next ten years. expand. According to a state- ment by the Minister of State Holdings in 1963, ENI plans to invest $1,159 million over the next four years as compared with the $937 million which ENI invested in the ten-year period 1953-62. The complex of ENI refineries under con- struction or planned for the next three years in Italy, West- ern Europe, and Africa would provide an added capacity of 320,000 barrels per day. The program is expected to bring the total annual capacity of refineries controlled or par- tially owned by ENI to 25 mil- lion tons, as compared with 8 million tons at the end of 1962. Expert and official forecasts vary, but by the end of 1965 Italy may have as much as 40 percent of the refining capa- city of the EEC as a whole. Shortly before his death, Mattei had indicated concern over the problem of maintaining the high level of production in the ENI manufacturing subsidi- aries--which turn out such di- verse products as fertilizer, rubber, and textiles. ENI's new management is under even greater pressure to do so be- cause of the current serious deficit in Italy's foreign trade. In negotiations with the private international oil com- panies and with the Soviet Union, ENI is said to have insisted on the purchase of its products and services in return for its purchases of crude petroleum. The size and range of ENI's activities, however, continue to Foreign Oil Contracts While the new ENI regime will fight any attempts to SECRET Approved For Release 2006/12/27: CIA-RDP79-00927AO04400080004-4 Approved For Release 2006/12/27: CIA-RDP79-00927A004400080004-4 SECRET abrogate its monopoly of domestic oil exploration, it is also con- tinuing Mattei's policy of ag- gressively seeking new sources of cheap oil in any part of the world. Following a trip to Mos- cow by Boldrini last year, ENI agreed to purchase 4.2 million tons a year of Soviet crude over a period extending to the end of 1970. The new leadership has re- affirmed Mattei's declaration that ENI was buying Soviet crude because such purchases reduced ENI's dependence on its major Western competitors, and because the USSR offered favorable rates on barter terms. ENI spokesmen justify the Soviet and other for- eign connections on the ground that Italy must have a variety of sources of supply. They say the importance of this \"cannot be overemphasized\" because of sheer volume of its import re- quirements, now running at about 43 million tons per year. The flow of Soviet crude to Italy from the Black Sea would not be affected if the Suez Canal should be cut off. Official spokesmen have indicated that ENI may expand its petroleum purchases under its 1966-69 contracts with the USSR; an earlier provision that not more than 14 percent of Italy's crude oil imports were to come from that source has been dropped from these agreements. Neverthe- less, in view of projected future increases in total Italian petro- leum imports, Foreign Ministry officials predict that the portion bought from the USSR will actually fall below 14 percent. The ENI president also has stated that he had discussed \"great projects\" with the So- viets, including plans for ENI to construct a refinery in the USSR which could \"cover the en- tire range of petroleum industry products.\" Capacity of the re- finery would be about 18 mil- lion tons, making it the largest in the world. Boldrini told the American Embassy in Rome he was pleased with the progress made in devel- oping business arrangements with US oil companies. ENI's most important for- eign contract to date--signed with the Gulf Oil Corporation in February--assures ENI of a crude oil supply estimated to be worth $20 million. In addi- tion one of ENI's subsidiaries gets full control of Gulf's con- cession for the exploitation of the Ragusa oil field in Sic- ily, the largest oil deposit in Italy. In 1963 Standard Oil of New Jersey contracted to supply ENI with 10-12 million tons of crude from the Middle East over SECRET Approved For Release 2006/12/27: CIA-RDP79-00927A004400080004-4 Approved For Release 2006/12/27: CIA-RDP79-00927AC400080004-4 SECRET a five-year period. There are also reports that Esso has agreed to purchase goods from ENI sub- sidiaries. Expansion in Africa and Asia Boldrini has said ENI will continue to seek to expand its operations in Africa. ENI already has a foothold in a number of African countries which have allowed it exploration concessions, refinery rights, or marketing outlets. Boldrini sees excellent prospects for rapid commercial growth there. Among the initiatives ENI has undertaken in Africa since Mattei's death is the 600,000-ton oil refinery under construction at Banana, near Matadi in the Congo, which will be able to pro- duce an estimated 12,000 barrels of petroleum products daily. This is a 50-50 venture between the Congolese Government and ANIC, an ENI subsidiary. This rate of production is beyond the Congo's needs, and competing oil companies have charged that ENI is seeking to squeeze them out of the distri- bution field for the new refin- ery's products. During 1963 ENI also made new investments in its subsidi- aries in Sudan and Kenya. It is expected to make a capital invest- ment of $14 million in Nigeria during the next four years. ENI now is making a strong bid for the Algerian domestic market hitherto dominated by France. It recently signed an agreement on a 50-50 basis with the Ben Bella government to build a refinery at Arzew with an ini- tial capacity of 1.25 million metric tons and the possibility of expansion to 2 million tons at a later date. The joint enterprise has been guaranteed half of the Algerian domestic market for petroleum products and the entire market for as- phalt. During the first ten years, exportable surpluses would be sold abroad by ENI. This operation is generally viewed as a first step toward a sharp expansion of ENI activities in Algeria. ENI may also participate in the development of India's oil resources. The question of increased participation was recently discussed in New Delhi ENI has also reportedly done some dickering with Peiping. e irm as so Small finery to Communist China and is also negotiating to supply the Chinese with more synthetic rubber. Although the projected refinery involves only about $5 million, it represents an opening wedge for ENI--one of the first Western oil com- panies to resume dealings with mainland China.

Future Italian governments will probably continue to under- write ENI's efforts. It is also likely, however, that in due course efforts may be made to curtail ENI's activities. Since ENI is one of the most important organizations in all of Italian industry, it and other government agencies would inevitably be affected by any determined ef- Such an effort is, however, not yet in sight, and so far ENI has apparently not even be- come a subject of active party controversy. The magnitude of the other problems calling for drastic reform--the tax system, the educational system, the civil service--is so great that the present government may well be content to leave relatively undisturbed an organization which has been a major factor in achieving Italy's postwar economic miracle, in helping to rehabilitate Southern Italy, and in boosting Italian prestige abroad.
