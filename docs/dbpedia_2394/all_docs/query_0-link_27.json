He completed a long training process at the Universities of Perugia, Bologna and Pisa, where he graduated in law in 1618.

He was then an auditor first of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldini, also a Florentine, during his legation in Bologna (1623-1627), then of Cardinal Carlo de 'Medici. Only at a relatively advanced age did he undertake a curial career, a choice that appears linked to a more comprehensive strategy of his family, and in particular of his brother Pietro, a great banker in the service of the Holy See, general depositary and contractor of the pontifical customs.
