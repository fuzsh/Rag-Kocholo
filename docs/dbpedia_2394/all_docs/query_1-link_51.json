We’ll explain everything you need to know to visit Vatican City from how to get tickets to when to go, the best Vatican tours to take, and more.\n\nPro Tip: Planning can be tough, but it’s easier to organize your trip when you have all your resources in one place. Create a browser folder and bookmark this post along with our dedicated guide to planning your visit to the Vatican, where you’ll find everything you need. Also, check out our article on the best Vatican tours.\n\nVisiting the Vatican City: What We’ll Cover\n\nVatican City is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church and the smallest independent country in the world. No matter your religious affiliation, it welcomes all who want to visit—around 19,000 people per day! It is home to some of the greatest works of art in the world.\n\nVisiting the Vatican is an unforgettable experience not only for lovers of art but also of history, culture, and architecture. In this guide, you’ll find information on how to visit Vatican City, the Sistine Chapel, St. Peter’s Basilica, and more. Here’s what we’ll cover:\n\nFacts and History of the Vatican City\n\nOpening hours and tickets\n\nHow long to budget for your visit\n\nHow to get to Vatican City\n\nWhat to see at Vatican City\n\nGuided tour options\n\nVisiting the Vatican with kids\n\nWhere To Eat Nearby and Inside\n\nFacts and History of Vatican City\n\nConstantine’s Vatican\n\nThe early establishment of the Vatican began with Constantine’s St. Peter’s Basilica, which stood where the current Basilica stands today. Jesus gave Simon the name Peter when he first met him and said, “You’re the stone upon which I will build my church.” After Constantine legalized Christianity in A.D. 313 with the Edict of Milan, he quickly began building that church. For Constantine, Jesus would have been as old as George Washington is in relative history to us.\n\nThe Vatican’s Name\n\nI have read many versions of how the Vatican got its name. The most likely is that the Etruscan society living in this area referred to it as Vatica prior to Roman settlement. It was a marshy area called Ager Vaticanus. There are a lot of other theories which may well be correct. It is an old word with many possible roots.\n\nThe Leonine City\n\nIn A.D. 846, Pope Leo IV commissioned a 39-foot wall to be constructed around the old St. Peter’s Basilica and other areas used by the clergy as a protective measure. The Saracens attacked Rome and caused significant damage to St. Peter’s Basilica, which motivated the pope to build out defenses. The area, which was larger than the current Vatican City, was proclaimed the Leonine City and stayed that way for some time.\n\nSottopassaggio\n\nIn 1277, there was a half-mile-long underground passageway and wall that connected the papal residence adjacent to St. Peter’s Basilica to the Castel Sant’Angelo. This was a major fortification for the pope in case of attack.\n\nVatican Museums\n\nThe Vatican Museums have residents. You won’t see the pope walking around as you visit, but he’s there. The collection of art is a mix of ancient and Renaissance or Baroque. There is even a modern religious art section.\n\nSt. Peter’s Basilica and Tomb\n\nThe Basilica of St. Peter is basically the largest and most beautiful gravestone ever built. According to Vatican dogma, it was built on the grave of St. Peter, which you can visit with special Scavi tickets. The Basilica, built during the 16th and 17th centuries, was completed in 1615 with contributions by almost every great Italian artist.\n\nSovereignty\n\nIn 1870, Italy was unified under the leadership of Italian-American Giuseppe Garibaldi. The government of the newly-defined Italy allowed the pope to keep a small area under sovereignty. Pope Pius IX would not agree to the terms until 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed under Benito Mussolini, which granted the Vatican sovereignty. This sovereignty extends beyond the Vatican City to other churches, including the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome.\n\nNot ready to book a tour? Find out if a Vatican tour is worth it.\n\nVatican Opening Hours and Tickets\n\nVatican Museum Ticket Prices:\n\nAdult (18+): €17\n\nChildren (ages 6 – 18): €8\n\nStudents (ages 19 – 26): €8\n\nMembers of the clergy: €8\n\nBe prepared to show proof of eligibility at the door. Without that, they’ll either make you pay more or disallow entrance without a refund. Tickets include access to the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel.

The Vatican Museums is a bucket-list place you absolutely should visit at least once with a tour guide.\n\nVatican Dress Code:\n\nTo gain access, you’ll have to abide by the Vatican dress code. Cover your shoulders and avoid shorts and short dresses and skirts. We know that Rome gets hot in the summer, we suggest bringing a light scarf to wrap around yourself when you need to. Hats, food, and metal tools like knives and scissors are also not allowed.\n\nHow Long To Spend at Vatican City\n\nShort Answer: 3 to 5 hours\n\nThis is a great question! The Vatican is an immense complex of artwork. You could spend a few hours inside and see a lot of art or you could spend 3 – 5 hours and really learn the history. It depends on your level of interest.\n\nMost people visiting the Vatican for the first time, without an art-history background, will follow the signs for the Capella Sistina or Sistine Chapel until they get there, snap their photo, and leave. Our goal is to help you have a more enriching experience. Here is a proposed Itinerary:\n\nSpiral Staircase\n\nPinecone Courtyard\n\nPio Clementino Gallery\n\nGallery of Candelabra, Tapestries, and Maps\n\nRaphael Rooms\n\nSistine Chapel\n\nSt. Peter’s Basilica\n\nIf you’re an art aficionado, also visit the Pinacoteca. Further on in this article, you’ll see a more comprehensive list of Vatican must-see artwork. If you’re going to go it alone, be well prepared. Check out our top things to see at the Vatican.\n\nNot ready to book a tour? Find out if a Vatican tour is worth it.\n\nHow To Get To Vatican City\n\nLuckily, getting to Vatican City is really easy. Depending on your preferences, you can take the metro, a bus, catch a cab, or just walk.\n\nMetro (about 20 minutes):\n\nThere are two metro stops located near the Vatican Museums entrance: Ottaviano and Cipro. These stops are located on the A-line (orange line). So, if you jump on near the Spanish Steps (Spagna) or Termini train station, make sure you catch the A-line going towards Battistini and get off at either Ottaviano or Cipro.\n\nThe entrance to the Vatican Museums is a 5-minute walk from either of these stops. Of course, you can also catch the A-line from many other stops, just check the Rome Metro schedule. You can buy tickets at the metro station or a corner store, but not from the driver.\n\nPro Tip: Always budget an extra 10 to 20 minutes if you have a scheduled event like a Vatican Tour. This way you don’t have to rush and it’ll give you time for that quintessential morning espresso.\n\nBus (about 20 minutes):\n\nFrom the Termini train station, head outside and get on bus number 64. The bus ride will take about 20 minutes and your stop is the last one on the route: P.za Stazione S. Pietro. Getting to the Vatican Museums’ entrance is about a 15-minute walk from the bus station.\n\nYou can also take the number 81 bus from the Colosseum area (the bus stop is located right outside of the metro station—B-line). The 81 bus route ends in Piazza Risorgimento, which is a five-minute walk to the Vatican Museums’ entrance.\n\nTaxi (depends on the departure point):\n\nA taxi ride should cost no more than €20 if you’re staying in the historic center of Rome. When you get in the taxi, tell the driver to take you to the Vatican Museums’ entrance, otherwise, they’ll probably take you to St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nThe most typical way to get a taxi in Rome is to go to a taxi stand. These are located near every major tourist attraction. If you aren’t located near one, you can always order a coffee and pastry at a café and ask the people working there to call you one.\n\nWalking (about 20 minutes):\n\nYou can easily walk to the Vatican Museums if you’re staying near Piazza Navona or in Campo de’ Fiori. Prati is also within walking distance. Technically, you can walk to the Vatican from basically anywhere in Rome, depending on your level of fitness.\n\nIt’s important to take into consideration that you’ll be on your feet for 3 hours or more as you visit the Vatican. I would recommend taking public transport because you’ll be on your feet plenty in Rome.\n\nPro Tip: A neat trick for using your map app on your phone is to set your course while you’re on wifi on airplane mode. GPS will still show your location while you’re on airplane mode—it won’t reroute you if you go off the route but it will show you where you are.\n\nPopular Vatican Tours\n\nNot ready to book a tour? Find out if a Vatican tour is worth it.\n\nWhat To See at Vatican City\n\nThis is a list of the top things to see at the Vatican—an excerpt from our much more elaborate mega-guide on the top things to see at the Vatican Museums written by a Vatican guide. Check it out for more in-depth descriptions, history, and images.\n\n1. Spiral Staircase\n\nThe staircase was built by the famous architect Giuseppe Momo in 1932. It was commissioned by Pope Pius XI and was to be created for the new entrance to the Vatican Museums.\n\n2. The Terrace with a view of the Basilica and Vatican Gardens\n\n3. The Pinacoteca (For art lovers)\n\nPinacoteca means “painting gallery” in Italian and, considering that all the popes have historically been the main patron of the arts for centuries, they don’t disappoint. Be sure to see:\n\nTransfiguration (Raphael)\n\nThe Annunciation (Raphael)\n\nCrowning of the Virgin (Raphael)\n\nSt. Jerome (Da Vinci)\n\nSt Matthew (Guido Reni)\n\nDeposition (Caravaggio)\n\nThe Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Guido Reni)\n\nMartyrdom of St. Erasmus (Nicolas Poussin)\n\nAstronomical Observations (Donato Creti)\n\nAdam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Wenzel Peter)\n\n4. The Pinecone Courtyard\n\nThe pinecone courtyard is a massive courtyard that connects the main galleries leading to the Sistine Chapel with the Pio Clementino and Braccio Nuovo Galleries. Reports have been written of jousting tournaments and bullfights taking place under the Borgia Pope AlexanderVI in the 15th century and supposedly Pope Leo X housed his pet elephant, Hanno, here in the 16th century. Be sure to see:\n\nColossal Statue of Augustus\n\nSphere within a Sphere\n\nThe Pinecone\n\n5. The Pio Clementino Gallery\n\nThe collection of classical statues you will see in these galleries was started at the beginning of the 16th century by Pope Julius II. The gallery is named, however, for popes from a much later date: Clement XIV(1769-1774) and Pius VI (1775-1799), who created the current galleries you’ll walk through. Much of the artwork here was taken by Napoleon and returned to the Museum after his defeat. Be sure to see:\n\nApoxyomenos\n\nApollo Belvedere\n\nLaocoön Group\n\nThe Belvedere Torso\n\nThe Bath of Nero\n\nStatue of Hercules in Bronze\n\nSarcophagus of Saint Helena\n\n6. The Candelabra Gallery\n\nAs the name suggests, this gallery owes its name to the enormous marble candlesticks that you’ll find in each section as you walk down the hallway. The gallery was completely renovated during the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII Pecci (1878-1903), which is what you see today. It was meant to be built so that each piece is like a furnishing for the house. Be sure to see:\n\nArtemis of Ephesus\n\nLapus Lazuli Mosaic\n\nThe Persian Warrior\n\n7. The Gallery of Tapestries\n\nAs you walk through the gallery, you will see tapestries on the right-hand side dedicated to stories of the life of the Barberini Pope Urban VIII (17th century). On the left-hand side, are stories from the Bible whose original drawings were executed by the school of Raphael, then woven in Flanders.\n\nResurrection of Christ\n\n8. The Gallery of the Maps\n\nBy far one of the most over-the-top galleries as far as decor goes, this room is literally a gigantic mural with frescoes on both sides of maps depicting Italy. Pope Gregory XIII, also known as the calendar pope, commissioned this room to be painted so he could accurately study the lands in which he lived and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe Grotesques\n\nThe Ceiling\n\nMap of Sicily\n\nMap of Lazio\n\nVatican Radio Station (Out of the window to your right)\n\n9. Raphael Rooms\n\nThe four rooms known as the Raphael rooms were painted by Raphael and his students between 1508 and 1524. They were commissioned first by Pope Julius II (1503 to 1513), supposedly because he refused to live in the Borgia apartments on the floor below due to his hatred for the man. These rooms were also used by his successors, specifically Leo X the Medici Pope (1512-1521). Be sure to see:\n\nRoom of Constantine\n\nVision of the Cross\n\nBattle of Constantine against Maxentius\n\nThe Victory of Christianity over Paganism (Ceiling)\n\nRoom of Heliodorus\n\nLiberation of St.Peter\n\nEncounter of Leo the Great with Attila\n\nRoom of the Segnatura\n\nThe School of Athens\n\nRoom of the Fire in the Borgo\n\nFire in the Borgo\n\n10. The Sistine Chapel\n\nThis chapel needs no introduction. Originally named Capella Magna (Great Chapel), it was restored by Pope Sixtus IV (pontiff from 1471 to 1484) in 1480. Sixtus IV had famous early Renaissance artists, who lived a generation before Michelangelo and Raphael, paint the fake draperies, the life of Moses and Christ (side walls), and the Pope (above the windows) Sixtus’ nephew. Julius II had Michelangelo paint the ceiling in 1508. Be sure to see:\n\nThe Ceiling\n\nThe Central Panels\n\nThe Side Panels\n\nThe Stories of Moses\n\nThe Stories of Jesus\n\nThe Last Judgment\n\n11. St. Peter’s Basilica\n\nFor me personally, there is no church that compares in beauty. It is the ultimate expression of space, beauty, and monumental grandeur. It also happens to have an amazing history to it as well. When you’re there, be sure to see:\n\nLa Pieta\n\nLa Baldacchino\n\nSt. Peter’s Square\n\nVatican Tour Options\n\nNot sure if a Vatican tour is worth it? Beyond the explanations and local insight, a major advantage of a tour is that it provides you special access to many sites like St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nWithout a tour guide, you will have to exit the Vatican Museums from the entrance where you came in, which means about a mile of additional walking. Many of our tours provide direct access from the Sistine Chapel to St. Peter’s Basilica. Here are our best Vatican tours:\n\nColosseum, Roman Forum & Vatican Highlights Combo Tour (8 hours)\n\nThis tour is for the art-history buff, visiting the majority of the Vatican Museums including the Pinacoteca, Sistine Chapel, and more.

Here are a few recommendations for getting a bite to eat and some refreshments inside and nearby the Vatican.\n\nInside the Vatican\n\nCaffetteria Centrale: €€ | Coffee Shop—With sub-par reviews that you would expect in a cafeteria-style eatery, this coffee shop and light eatery will get the job done if you want to spend more than 4 or 5 hours inside the Vatican Museums. To find it, look for signs near the Pinacoteca.\n\nBar: €€ | Quick Snacks—There is a small bar for coffee and pastries located near the Sistine Chapel. Look for the signs as you get close.\n\nSt. Peter’s Dome Bar: €€ | Coffee Shop—Yep, you can get coffee on top of St. Peter’s Dome. There is a little bar open basically whenever they want to be open. But if it’s open, stop for a coffee and enjoy the view.\n\nNear the Vatican\n\nHostaria Dino e Toni: € | Roman Restaurant—Somehow this owner-operated and authentic Roman restaurant has yet to get touristy. They make good food with relatively friendly service, and they may just order for you. Come here for pizza, pasta, and apps.\n\n200 Gradi: €€ | Sandwich Shop—Have a big day of sightseeing planned after your Vatican visit? This sandwich shop is perfect. You can get really tasty to-go sandwiches or sit down inside. Super reasonably priced."
