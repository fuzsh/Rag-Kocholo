        "text": "The Most Beautiful Operas of all time series presents a selection of ten Major works among the most important of the operatic literature. The series features films about The Knight of the Rose by Richard Strauss, The Magic Flute and Don Giovanni by Mozart, Fidelio by Beethoven, La Bohème and Tosca by Puccini, La Traviata and Aida by Verdi, Lohengrin by Wagner and Carmen by Bizet. Far from being an exhaustive list of the great repertoire masterpieces, this selection will help the neophyte know and understand the basis of opera. But this series will also please the serious music lover, who will be able to watch excerpts from the best productions of these operas as well as hear interviews of such great interpreters as Renée Fleming, Diana Damrau, Jonas Kaufmann, Rolando Villazón, Daniel Barenboim, Thomas Hampson, Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta... Singers and conducts talk about these operas they know better than anyone else."
