Political-cultural magazine published by Giulio Einaudi and directed by Elio Vittorini (1908-1966). It started to be published with the name "Settimanale di Cultura" (Educational Weekly Periodical) on 29th September 1945, and kept this name up to the issue No. 28 released on 6th April 1946. The editors were: Franco Clamandrei, Franco Fortini, Vito Pandolfi, Albe Steiner, and Stefano Terra for a couple of months. The editorial secretary was Giuseppe Trevisani. "Il Politecnico" turned into the "Mensile di Cultura Contemporanea" (Monthly Periodical of Contemporary Culture) starting from the No. 29 released on 1st May 1946 and it kept a regular publication up to the issue No. 39 of December 1947.

Born in the immediate after-war period, it affirmed the need for the education to take all ethical and political responsibilities, deeply engaging in the battle for transforming the civil society. It claimed the acknowledgement of a sociologic power for the education, as an advanced top in the political war and an absolute autonomy versus the activities made by the politicians: these positions brought to the final battle between Vittorini and Togliatti and, as a consequence of this, to the end of the Magazine.
