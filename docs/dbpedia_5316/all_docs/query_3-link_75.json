        "text": "Within the influence of Gramsci’s pedagogical model in the work of Gianni Rodari, this article examines the novel Piccoli vagabondi (Small vagabonds) (1952-1953), a unicum in the author’s production of Grammatica della fantasia (The Grammar of Fantasy), as it is characterized by neorealistic themes and by a communicative style that uses “proletarian” rhetoric, progressive vision and utopian elements. After mentioning the national issue of the non-existence of children’s literature (which Gramsci mentions in his essays on popular literature) and the neorealistic traits present in Rodari, the paper enters more directly into the merit of the neorealist novel, which presents itself as a document of the pedagogical effort (even contradictory) made by the Partito Comunista Italiano (Italian Communist Party) in the political climate of the “cold war” and as a testimony to the origin of the author’s search to reconcile realism with fantasy, dream and invention.\n\nThis essay examines the cultural practices and prejudices that shaped the Italian reception of German Neue Sachlichkeit in the 1920s and explores their role in the development of Italian Neorealism in the 1940s. I argue that, precisely because Italian critics approached the German critical category – and indeed all critical categorisation – with scepticism, they facilitated the more indiscriminate use in Italian of the term «neorealismo», which originated, at least in part, as a calque for the German «Neue Sachlichkeit», but which came eventually to constitute a distinct – and distinctly Italian – critical category. Focusing in particular on Giovanni Necco’s 1933 essay Neorealismo made in Germany, I argue that, in the Italian context, questions of classification and definition were deemed peripheral to the critic’s task, meaning that references to «neorealismo», while customary, remained largely heuristic. As a result, Italian «neorealismo» was free gradually to shift and to expand towards its current definitions.\n\nLa corrispondenza inedita (1941-1961) tra Luciano Anceschi e Vittorio Bodini riguarda aspetti importanti della loro ricerca estetica e letteraria e più in generale della cultura poetica in Italia di fine Novecento. Il carteggio è una testimonianza della loro attività creativa e critica, e indica l'orizzonte estetico comune di una riflessione costante sulla poetica moderna, tra avanguardie e modernismo (Ermetismo), tradizione italiana ed europea (Barocco), nuova avanguardia e surrealismo. The unpublished correspondence (1941-1961) between Luciano Anceschi and Vittorio Bodini concerns important aspects of their aesthetic and literary research and more in general of the poetic culture in Italy in the late twentieth century. The correspondence is a testimony of their creative and critical activity, and indicates the common aesthetic horizon of a constant reflection about the modern poetics, between avant-garde and modernism (Hermeticism), the Italian tradition and the European one (Baroque), new avant-gardes and surrealism.\n\nIn the composition and structure of Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron we can identify a double articulation and a double setting, as well as a double audience. This article explores whether this choice is part of what Boccaccio was learning from his experience of reading the French fabliaux that constitute some of his sources. It offers a reader-oriented interpretation of the relation between the Decameron and the fabliau material, before focussing on the sixth novella of the ninth day – the story of Niccolosa and Pinuccio – and its antecedents, the anonymous fabliaux generally known as Le meunier et les deus clers, together with Jean Bodel’s Gombert. It also proposes a comparison with a text possibly deriving from these, Geoffrey Chaucer’s Reeve’s Tale.\n\nThis essay presents part of a larger study on Boccaccio's \"Filocolo\" (\"Per difetto rintegrare\", 2004). The essays deals in particular with the rewriting of the Old French romance \"Floire et Blancheflor\" in the \"Filocolo\" in the light of medieval epistemology and literary theory as Fiammetta's request to the composer of the work raises matters of interest to both narratology and poetics. I argue that before his defense of poetry in Book XIV of the Genealogie\", Boccaccio had already formulated his own literary theory and the premise of his defense of poetry: poetry has its own truth. The \"Filocolo\" through the voice of the poet-philosopher affirms the autonomy of poetry and its \"veritatis similima\", and most possible, reveals Boccaccio’s lifetime desire to be considered the “seventh” among “cotanto senno”."
