        "text": "Is feminist architecture possible? An all-women firm reimagines the field… Cierto Estudio are six female architects from Barcelona who face the issue head-on. Their gender, unfortunately, is a rarity in their industry. “We are well-known as a studio led by women. The fact that we’re six female partners puts us in the spotlight. People always ask us what it’s like to be six partners and women on top of that, as if that were very different from being six men.” But should we talk about a feminist architecture? “Surely we will do feminist architecture, because we understand that feminist architecture is architecture designed for everyone. But we are not alone. Many studios, including some led by men, do feminist architecture,” say the architects, who work as a cooperative and seek to change how we move through public and private space.\n\nKnow more about our #FEM.DES. Network Working Groups Our FEM. DESign Network is founded upon the moral imperative of promoting gender equity and inclusivity in urban spaces. With a diverse range of #feminist design #topics, #resources, and #tools, our network strives to empower feminist design and foster positive change mainly in the built environment. With over 240 global FEM. Experts from more than 55 cities around the world. We firmly believe in challenging and #dismantling the #systemic #barriers that perpetuate #genderinequalities within the built environment. FEM. DESign #Cities represents our commitment to expanding our impact, spreading awareness, and actively engaging in transformative practices across different local contexts. #Design and Urban Planning Group This subgroup focuses on the #physical aspects of urban spaces. Comprising architects, urban planners, and designers, co-led by our amazing FEM.Creators Belen Iturralde Nourhan Bassam ITZEL JULIETA FUENTES MORALES Alejandra Benoso Dr May Newisar Diana Ardila Luengas Dorsa Jalalian Javiera Paz Martínez Espinoza Julieta Impemba Vaishnavi Laddha its goal is to incorporate inclusive design principles into the planning process by assessing existing infrastructure and proposing innovative solutions to create gender-responsive and inclusive urban environments. It focuses mainly on integrating gender considerations into the design and development of cities. https://lnkd.in/geiZV2iT\n\nI was recently told by a dear client- along with being 'a very good #architect, you are 'hard headed’. I take this as a compliment. And knowing them, I know it was meant as a compliment! That said, would they have said the same thing to a male Architect who stands their ground to make sure they deliver their best work? Possibly not. The same compliment may have been delivered via a different choice of words. Earlier today, an The Architectural Review article, described Nguyễn Hà, the 2024 winner of the Moira Gemmill Prize (an Award given to Women Architects) as an “uncompromising architect, unafraid to step away from a project if she cannot find a common vision with the client.” This- the right way to describe a ‘hard headed’ Architect and their ideology. Two different ways of saying the same thing. But one, that does not judge on the basis of gender. It is precisely this reason why a single day celebration of Women, will remain necessary, until we truly achieve a world where profession/ work is gauged as gender neutral. Happy Women’s Day to all the women out there and our allies! https://lnkd.in/guXrkBiu #iwd2024 #womeninarchitecture #equityandinclusion #genderequality #architecture #design\n\nMy second interaction with Li Xiang, Founder of X+ Living Art, was much more refined from my end, having carefully studied her way of craftspersonship and attention to detail. I'm grateful to ArchNative for providing me a platform to have these conversations and showcase the brilliant ways in which females are leading the AEC industry. In a motivating way, Li says, \"In addition to uniting with the media to improve this situation, as a female practitioners in the architecture industry, I think we should use our own experience and achievements to inspire and encourage other women who wish to join this industry. At the same time, we should not let the gender labels tie our own hands, and focus more on improving our professional abilities.\" You could read the full interaction here: #architecturediscourse #femalesinAEC #aeco #aecindustry #architecturewriting\n\nYesterday Dezeen published a list with 50 most powerful women in architecture and design (according to Dezeen). It is a great list with gorgeous names, but I personally think that there are much more inspiring woman in design to mention (and not only once a year) and is also not very correct to mix a design curator with architect in one list. Anyway, it is known that women underrepresented in design today. &Walsh referring to 1% of woman founded creative agencies, different resources mentioning 11%-30% of the companies where women have leaderships positions in design and architecture. Taking into account that more than a half design/architect students in the universities are women I just say — as a media it will be great to show more opportunities and variations, taking into account that young women reading this. Say, start with 5 lists of 50 most powerful women in architecture and design. The current one is already great, but I believe, Dezeen, you can do better!"
