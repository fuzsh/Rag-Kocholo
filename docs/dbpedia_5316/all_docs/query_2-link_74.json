        "text": "The Free University of Bozen-Bolzano is located in one of the most fascinating European regions, at the crossroads between the German-speaking and Italian economies and cultures. Its trilingualism in teaching and research, its high level of internationalisation as well as an ideal study environment guaranteed by its excellent facilities are some of the reasons why unibz regularly reaches top positions in national and international rankings.\n\nInterdisciplinarity and sustainability, together with a local and international focus characterise the scientific research carried out in our five faculties and in the competence centres of unibz. Research is funded both internally and, more recently, also through national and European funding programmes and other sources.\n\nBesides teaching and research, another fundamental objective of unibz - the so called third mission - is to contribute to the economic, social and cultural development of our territory through collaborations with public institutions and private organisations.\n\nThis is made possible by the transfer of technical skills and knowledge, by collaborations with private companies, by a wide range of courses in the field of lifelong learning (JuniorUni, Studium Generale and Senior Student Card) and by partnerships with cultural institutions and events."
