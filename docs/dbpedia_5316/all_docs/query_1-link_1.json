In the debut editorial it was stated that the magazine was inspired by the homonymous journal which had been founded by Carlo Cattaneo in 1839 and published until 1845.[1] Although it was a short-lived publication, Il Politecnico was the most prominent magazine in Italy during its run.[2]\n\nHistory and profile\n\n[edit]\n\nIl Politecnico was first published in Milan as a weekly on 29 September 1945.[3][4] The magazine was openly affiliated with the Communist Party.[2] Giulio Einaudi was the publisher, and Elio Vittorini was the editor of the magazine.[3][5][6] Franco Fortini, an Italian poet and Marxist theorist, was one of the editorial board members of Il Politecnico.[7] From 1 May 1946 the magazine came out monthly.[2][6]\n\nThe idea behind the establishment of Il Politecnico was to rebuild Italian culture after the experience of Fascism.[3] This idea was originally developed by a communist Catholic philosopher Felice Balbo in 1945.[3] Il Politecnico also aimed at providing a democratic forum for literary discussions.[8] It considered culture as a guide to policy.[9] This approach was similar to that advocated by French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre and was totally opposite of Palmiro Togliatti's understanding of culture as something less important than party instructions.[9]\n\nIl Politecnico rejected not to cover the work by non-Communist artists and featured translations of famous authors such as Ernest Hemingway, T. S. Eliot, Franz Kafka and James Joyce.[5] Translated literary work by these and other international authors was one of the defining characteristics of the magazine.[2] It also published photo-stories of Luigi Crocenzi.[10][11] Italo Calvino was among the contributors and in fact, he started his career as a journalist in the magazine.[12]\n\nDue to the conflict between the Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti and Elio Vittorini[13] and its editorial policy Il Politecnico lost the support of the Communist Party.[5] The magazine eventually ceased publication in December 1947.[5] The 39th issue was the last one which did not announce the closing of the magazine.[7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of magazines in Italy"
