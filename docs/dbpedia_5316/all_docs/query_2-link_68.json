Her research revolves around forecasting in a broad variety of contexts and provides mathematical tools to tell when a prediction is \"good\".\n\nFraudsters, armed with just moderate technical skills and inexpensive technology, could use someone else’s payment card, mobile phone, or smartwatch to make contactless payments at a distant location without the victim’s consent. ETH Zurich researchers have developed a security solution that protects consumers against this threat."
