        "text": "Hired in 1955 by Dante Giacosa at FIAT, in 1959 he became head of style for the Bertone bodywork section: among other things, he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo 2000 Sprint and the Fiat 850 Spider. From 1965 he was director of the Ghia Style Centre (De Tomaso Mangusta, Maserati Ghibli). In 1967 he founded Ital Styling, and Italdesign in 1968 with Gianni Mantovani, offering design and engineering services to major European brands and creating cornerstones of automotive design such as the Golf, Panda, Passat, Thema and Uno.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nThe Compasso d’Oro for an Italian individual notable for a wide range of activities was awarded to Giorgetto Giugiaro for the impact and quality of design that has distinguished the success of his design group over the past few years and for the vast range of product categories produced both in and outside Italy. Giugiaro expresses the future of the profession of industrial designer, based on an interdisciplinary strategy and specific expertise in integrating many new technologies and disciplines with the typically Italian artisanal tradition and intuitive creativity. The remarkably high level of design engineering applied to such diverse products as cars, sewing machines and musical instruments exhibited in this exhibition clearly illustrates the jury’s opinion. In addition to the quality of the designed products, which often contributes to increased exports, the Ital-Design group has been particularly successful in professional design services. This invisible export of Italian ideas and designs may well become an important extension of a future economic renaissance as well as having an international impact perhaps greater than that of the products themselves exported and so highly appreciated abroad. In a country like ours which is based on an economy of transformation and in which design is fundamental, Giugiaro’s contribution expresses the maturity of Italian design in being able to explore the future in close collaboration with industrial and commercial activities and which ends up by being the truest expression of industrial design.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nGraduated in Architecture in Florence, in 1964 he was one of the founders of Archizoom Associati and in 1973 he moved to Milan, taking part in the Alchimia group activities. Co-founder of the Domus Academy in 1982, he edited the magazine Modo (1982 – 1984) and was a lecturer in Interior Design at the Milan Polytechnic as well as participating in the Memphis group.

His contribution to the cultural enrichment of design and the widening of problematic areas pertaining to it in a period of apparent crystallization of the trends practiced has been highly stimulating.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nGraduated in Architecture in Milan in 1947, in 1952 he founded the PFR studio with Ponti and Fenaroli, participating in the projects for the Pirelli skyscraper in Milan (1960). In 1954 he founded the Stile Industria magazine which he directed until its closure in 1963. His design creations include the Condor armchair (Arflex 1960), the Bar table (Kartell 1967), the Meteor bus (with Isao Hosoe, Orlandi 1970), the P110 armchairs (Saporiti 1971) and the Casa Mobile for the New Italian Landscape exhibition at MoMA in 1972. Among the founders of ADI, he was its first president (1956-1957) and with Marco Zanuso he created the three-dimensional version of the Compasso d ‘Oro based on a design by Albe Steiner.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nThe Jury of the 14th edition has decided to give the 1987 Compasso d’Oro Award to Alberto Rosselli. ” L’intervallo del tempo (The interval of time)”, to use one of the perfect terms that only Gillo Dorfles can come up with, sees the figure of Alberto Rosselli emerge in its entirety through his rigorous commitment to design as seen through his professional creations, the foundation of the Compasso d’Oro and ADI and the still unsurpassed intuition and intelligence of the magazine “Stile e Industria”.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nIn 1935 he was among the promoters of the Concrete Art movement in Argentina and in Germany in 1954 he was one of the founders of the Hochschule fur Gestatung in Ulm, where he taught until 1965, moving on to Princeton University until 1970.

Author of numerous essays, he was editor of Casabella magazine from 1979 to 1983.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nFor having illustrated the culture of industrial design through an entire life of studies and work and exercising an intellectual charm that constantly accompanied the development of Industrial Design at an international level. While the illuminating studies (both early and recent) from his vast oeuvre into material culture have been highlighted, mention should be made of his intense didactic activity which, masterfully expressed at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung in Ulm / Donau (1954-66) and then in Italy, went on to culminate in the recent establishment of the Industrial Design Course at the Politecnico di Milano.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nFantoni, awarded the Compasso d’Oro Career Award is a company that knows how to translate the activity of producing a material – Medium Density – into a piece of constant proactive, metaproject and design research, together with its appropriate translation into final products; evolving the all-Italian tradition of “primary design”.In terms of the evolution of a vast range of diverse types and rheological structures attributed to the specific destinations of the variants of the material and its finishes, Fantoni has explored and continues to explore not only the most convenient possibilities for their application, but also those for reducing environmental impact – from the forest, to production processes and to the final use of the materials themselves.Resulting from research into materials, the products that Fantoni presents directly to the end user also constitute paradigmatic proposals in accordance with the most advanced practices of “competitive collaboration”, as examples of possibilities elsewhere and which can be further developed.The Osoppo factory itself – conceived and designed by Gino Valle to grow over time, constitutes one of the main cases of an intelligent, sensitive and well developed integration into the landscape, to the point of positively demonstrating the well-known thesis in which the landscape it is primarily the result of the presence of man.The image of the company – resulting from the coherent expressive trait of all the creations – thus becomes an example of total design towards which all truly excellent companies are heading.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nFounded by Gio Ponti in 1932 as the “artistic” division of Luigi Fontana, Fontana Arte was a company that developed as a research centre into the particular characteristics of glass, with results that made it one of the leading figures of pre-war Italian design. The Compasso d’Oro for Lifetime Achievement at Fontana Arte – together with the memory of the now classic designs by Ponti and Pietro Chiesa – is intended above all to indicate, for example, the rigorous twenty-year-long intervention that, led by Carlo Guglielmi and his team of managers, was able to redeem the company and its name from past entrepreneurial and cultural mistakes through a radical change of orientation, the recovery of the culture of the company and a courageous thematic diversification that underwent continuous evolution. It also is intended to recognize how the predisposition of an intelligent creative climate has been able to adequately involve designers who, not only in the products, but in the graphics, the installations and in every communication gesture – in a word, in the overall image – have contributed to redevelop the top level one of the historical names of Italian production and prestige, and not just onf terms of furnishing.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nMechanical model maker attracted by industrial design, in 1951he moved from making foundry models to industrial models, collaborating with Nizzoli, Albini, the Castiglioni brothers, Sottsass, Zanuso, Giò Ponti and Munari for companies such as Olivetti (Lettera 22, 1950), Necchi (Mirella sewing machine, 1956), Brionvega (TV Doney, 1962), Siemens (Grillo telephone, 1965) and Alessi (Cupola coffee maker, 1988). At the end of his activity he had created 8,000 models and 25,000 design models.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nFor decades Giovanni Sacchi has represented the best in terms of designed product models. The first, exactly fifty years ago for Marcello Nizzoli at Olivetti was the Lexicon. The last is still to be done.\n\nFrom the outset his models were created from a partnership of work, sensitivity and thought: Sacchi is often the hand that thinks in wood together with the heads of others; which makes Denis de Rougemont’s penser avec les mains true by becoming the interlocutor of research without ever betraying it. Even when he made working models of Leonardo’s machines and guessed the solutions unexpressed in the drawings, it could be said that for Sacchi the Codex Atlanticus had fewer mysteries than for critics and scholars.\n\nFor the designer, his chisel becomes a pencil, and this becomes, through his hand, a tool; because – capable of simulating the final materials in wood – he knows how to overcome the abstract limits of design; he always knows how to become a collaborator; and what’s more, always available, dedicated and tireless. Without intentionally doing so Sacchi ended up choosing, due to his expertise, the high points of Italian design while many companies have decided to produce precisely on the basis of the perception and judgment induced by his model which therefore acts as an interface between the idea and the designer, and between this and the client. In this sense, the responsibility – and the merit – of many achievements are also due to him.\n\nTo this extraordinary and unique career which spread throughout collections, design studios and company archives, an ideal museum of final, provisional, transitory models and yet unrepeatable witnesses of the process that led to the final outcome – the Compasso d’Oro was obligatory in 1998, fifty years after his first success; and two-thirds of a century after his first work.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nA pioneer of Italian graphics, in 1939 he opened a studio in Milan with his wife Lica, creating the “Politecnico Biblioteca” series for Einaudi in 1945. From 1946 to 1948 he was in Mexico and returned to Milan where from 1950 to 1958 he was art director of La Rinascente, for which he designed the Compasso d ‘Oro brand. A founding member of ADI, he collaborated with cultural institutions and companies, dedicating himself in particular to editorial graphics for Feltrinelli (1955-1965) and Zanichelli. Until 1958 he taught at the Collegio Rinascita and from 1959 at the Scuola del Libro della Società Umanitaria.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nAlbe Steiner, born in 1913 and died prematurely in 1974, has characterized since 1933 an entire season of Italian graphics, intertwined in the most radical and advanced Rodcenko expressive tradition- with political and civil commitment.\n\nA man of vast cultural and social interests and convinced that “freedom is culture”, Albe Steiner set up Elio Vittorini’s legendary magazine “Il Politecnico” immediately after the war, created the Liberazione della Ricostruzione Exhibition with Gabriele Mucchi, collaborated with Hannes Meyer former director of the Bauhaus, and worked intensely in the Milan Umanitaria, also as director of his pet project, the Scuola del Libro.\n\nAnimator at the Triennale Study Centre and founder of the Artists Union, of the Graphic Studies Centre, the AGI (Alliance Graphique Internationale), ADI, ANEDI and ICTA as well as curating countless public, private and political publishing productions, he published the historical “distance” didactic lecture notes on the history and technique of the manifesto for the Accademia di Roma. He also edited Zanichelli’s ‘experimental scientific book’ and set up series and magazines for Feltrinelli. His contribution to la Rinascente, especially during the establishment of the Compasso d ‘Oro, gave an unmistakable character to the image of the award, while the other cultural and commercial achievements of the department store are also remembered for his always illuminating interventions, not only strictly graphic, which contributed in particular to distinguish it, also on the international scene.\n\nCollaborator of various Venice Biennials and with Coop, RAI, Pirelli, Olivetti, Bemberg, Linoleum, Heller, Bertelli, Geigy, Cedit, Necchi, Lark and Aurora, he conceived Pierrel’s corporate identity which remains a milestone in history not only in the context of pharmaceutical graphics and packaging. Enthusiastic, tireless, courageous, Albe Steiner was one of the great masters of life and knowledge, who knew how to accompany the profession and politics with the didactic commitment and generous care of young people. The vast book and newspaper library and the graphic collection that he left are, especially today, a precious reference point for the documentation of the successful years that saw him as a leading figure.\n\nWe cannot conclude this motivation for Albe, so pleonastic for those who know the history of design, without mentioning Lica, the apparently fragile companion who always supported him with great, even professional intelligence, with reciprocated affection and even with stubbornness in the difficult and painful phases. Lica Steiner, to whom the Prize is awarded so that she herself has it among the things she experienced with him and never lost.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nThe visual and expressive research of Pino Tovaglia, who died prematurely in 1977 at the age of 54, was among those dominant – yet discreetly and almost timidly, like its author – in the cultural landscape of the post-war development years and leaving indelible marks on graphic design culture, not only in Italy.\n\nOvercoming the distinctions between formal genres based solely on technical differences – as in the now famous Finmeccanica series in the years of Leonardo Sinisgalli in which, for the first time, line and “burnt” photography were integrated into the graphic context – Pino Tovaglia has greatly contributed in practice to the affirmation of the thesis against those “literary genres” which hindered expressive authenticity at that time.\n\nAuthor of memorable brands from those of Nebiolo and “Ottagono” to that of the new Alfa Romeo and co-author of the brand for the Lombardy Region, Pino Tovaglia developed famous advertising campaigns such as those for Pirelli in the years of Arturo Castellani, Splugen during the reign of Aldo Bassetti and for Total and Lanerossi; activities that earned him the Palme d’Or for advertising. Founder and president of the Art Director’s Club of Milan and the art director of magazines such as “Pirelli” and “RAI”, consultant at la Rinascente in the years of Giovanni Bordoli, and of Italia Nostra, Mondadori, Flos and Einaudi, he taught at the Scuola Superiore d’Arte del Castello, Umanitaria and at Urbino, then starting up the coordinated image course at the Nino Di Salvatore Polytechnic School of Design in Milan, helping to train an entire generation of graphic designers with a new globalized direction.\n\nAn advocate of team work, but self-taught and a researcher by instinct and reasoning; free and independent, logical and subtle, Pino Tovaglia has been able to translate the great themes into the experience of the “everyday” in an approach from which we all still have a lot to learn.\n\nIt is primarily for this reason that the Compasso d’Oro is intended to act in memoriam.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nGraduated in chemistry, he worked at Olivetti and then at La Rinascente (1955-1970) as a link between marketing, communication and products. He was one of the leading exponents of international design culture and one of the founders of ADI. Lecturer at the Polytechnic and IULM in Milan, and at the University of Virginia, he edited the second series of the Stileindustria magazine (1995-97). He was president of ADI (1992-98), the ICSID International Council of Industrial Design Companies (1997-2001) and the Milan Triennale (2000-2002).\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nThe cultural, organizational and managerial activities of Augusto Morello have always been intertwined with the planning dimension linked to design: from his experience with La Rinascente to the foundation of the Compasso d’Oro Award and ADI, of which he was president from 1993 to 1998, up to prestigious positions in Europe and internationally – in particular the presidency of ICSID – without forgetting his current position as president of the Triennale di Milano Foundation. Augusto Morello has always been one of the most important personalities on the strategic level of research and design, never forgetting the need to think alongside the dimension of doing.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nGraduated in Chemical Engineering in Milan in 1949, in the same year he founded Kartell, producing plastic car accessories. He was among the first to understand the potential of plastic in everyday objects, producing household items and furnishing accessories. From the 1960s he worked together with the best Italian and international designers, including the Castiglioni brothers, Aulenti, Colombo, Zanuso, Sapper and in 1956 he was one of the founders of ADI, of which he was president (1957-58) and vice president (1992 -98). In 2000 he founded the Kartell Museum in Noviglio (Milan). Kartell products have received three Compasso d’Oro awards.\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nThis special award, unanimously conferred by the ADI Executive Committee and the directors of the ADI Foundation for Italian Design to Giulio Castelli, engineer and founder of Kartell spa, is recognition for the tenacity of his work in the historic Association for Industrial Design from 1956, the year of its foundation, to today. A constant and passionate undertaking, conducted together with many others, in the deep conviction that only from the collective work of all those involved in the design system could the desire to witness be born in the preservation of the past and the development of the contents necessary to build the future. The nearly fifty years of history of ADI prove him right.\n\nPhoto: Chris Moyse\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nAfter attending the University of Grenoble, she began her business activity in the 1950s with an interest in Scandinavian design, of which she became the first importer in Italy with her company ICF De Padova.

From the mid-fifties to today, her research represents in an exemplary way the happy synthesis between design (company and product), manufacturing and distribution. Her in-depth knowledge of Scandinavian, American and Italian design, due to her collaboration with some of the greatest names in world design such as Alvar Aalto, Arne Jacobsen, Charles Eames, George Nelson, Dieter Rams, Achille Castiglioni and Vico Magistretti to name but a few, combined with her tireless energy, have made De Padova a world reference point for Italian design.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nGraduated from the Milan Polytechnic in 1951, she began her professional activity in 1963, working on civil architecture and industrial design.

This was due to the commitment of numerous individuals including Tomás Maldonado and Alberto Seassaro, first dean of the Faculty of Design. Design at the Politecnico di Milano is today an integrated system of skills that operates, between training and research, through its own structures such as the INDACO Department (Industrial Design, Arts, Communication and Fashion), with the Design Research Doctorate, the Laboratory System and the POLI.design Consortium.

It immediately became an unparalleled observatory of international youth creativity. Since then, more than 9,000 young people and 253 international design schools have met every April on this stage where Lorenzo Damiani, Patrick Jouin, Nendo, Satyendra Pakhalé, Harri Koskinen and Xavier Lust made their debut. The Selection Committee was also excellent and has seen all the major international players in the world of design. Since 2005, the event has also been held as part of the World Wide Salons in Moscow. In 2007, the tenth anniversary was celebrated with the Avverati exhibition: 450 objects put on the market by the best Italian and foreign companies. In order to constantly support young people, in 2010 the SaloneSatellite launched the I Saloni – SaloneSatellite Award competition.\n\nDiscover the career poster\n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nBorn in Munich in 1932, he began his career in the Daimler-Benz Style Centre in Stuttgart, then moved to Milan where he opened a studio in 1959.
