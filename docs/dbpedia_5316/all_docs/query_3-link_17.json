        "text": "It must have been hard to be a writer in 1945, and even worse in 1946. Not quite so bad perhaps for the younger ones, those who had not yet taken the fatal step of committing ink to page, but for the older ones, yes, the already established writers who were faced with the problem not of what to do, but what to do next, and some of whom had some explaining to do about what they had done before. It is fair to say that in the immediate postwar period, writers found themselves caught in the embrace of a powerful consensus: a consensus about the need to write, and, later, to some extent, about what to write. Such a position is not usually a comfortable one, and if there is an underlying theme, it is that of the pressure of various sorts to which writing is subject and of the spaces in which it actually takes place. For it has to be said that in speaking about the writing of this period, one has continually to acknowledge all that is not writing; it is not satisfactory to reduce literary history to a series of individual biographies and case-studies (which is the constant temptation, especially when one is dealing with a large body of material): one cannot not respect the dominant role of ideology, programmes, the social call. But it also has to be said that the cultural history of this period — as regards Italy at any rate — is always traced from the point of view of the programme, the project, that which the writer intends to do or ought to do, never what he or she actually does. It would be nice for once to descend into the magma of literary practice."
