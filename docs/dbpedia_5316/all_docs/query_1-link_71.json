        "text": "Italo Calvino\n\nDRAGON\n\nItalo Calvino\n\nBiography of Italo Calvino,\n\nItalian Novelist\n\nOne of the leading figures in the the post-modern literary era\n\nBy\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\nUpdated January 06, 2020\n\nChildhood and Early Adulthood\n\nCalvino was born in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba. The Calvinos relocated to the Italian Riviera soon after, and Calvino would eventually be caught up in Italy’s tumultuous politics. After serving as an obligatory member of Mussolini’s Young Fascists, Calvino joined the Italian Resistance in 1943 and participated in campaigns against the Nazi army.\n\nThis immersion in wartime politics had a significant impact on Calvino’s early ideas about writing and narrative. He would later claim that hearing fellow Resistance fighters recount their adventures awakened his understanding of storytelling. And the Italian Resistance also inspired his first novel, \"The Path to the Nest of Spiders\" (1957). Though both of Calvino’s parents were botanists, and though Calvino himself had studied agronomy, Calvino had more or less committed himself to literature by the mid-1940s. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Turin with a literature thesis. He joined the Communist Party that same year.\n\nCalvino's Evolving Style\n\nDuring the 1950s, Calvino absorbed new influences and progressively moved away from politically-motivated writing. Although Calvino continued to produce realistic short stories during the decade, his major project was a trilogy of whimsical, reality-bending novels (\"The Non-Existent Knight\", \"The Cloven Viscount\", and \"Baron in the Trees\"). These works would eventually be issued in a single volume under the title I nostri antenati (\"Our Ancestors\", published in Italy in 1959). Calvino’s exposure to \"Morphology of the Folktale\", a work of narrative theory by Russian Formalist Vladimir Propp, was partially responsible for his growing interest in fable-like and relatively non-political writing. Before 1960, he would also leave the Communist Party.\n\nTwo major changes in Calvino’s personal life took place in the 1960s. In 1964, Calvino married Chichita Singer, with whom he would have one daughter. Then, in 1967 Calvino took up residence in Paris. This change would also have an impact on Calvino’s writing and thinking. During his time in the French metropolis, Calvino associated with literary theorists such as Roland Barthes and Claude Lévi-Strauss and became familiar with groups of experimental writers, particularly Tel Quel and the Oulipo. Arguably, the nontraditional structures and painstaking descriptions of his later works are indebted to these contacts. But Calvino was also aware of the pitfalls of radical literary theory and poked fun at post-modern academia in his late novel \"If on a winter’s night a traveler\".\n\nCalvino's Final Novels\n\nIn the novels that he produced after 1970, Calvino explored issues and ideas that are at the heart of many definitions of “post-modern” literature. Playful reflections on the acts of reading and writing, an embrace of diverse cultures and genres, and intentionally disorienting narrative techniques are all characteristics of classic post-modernism. Calvino’s \"Invisible Cities\" (1974) is a dreamlike reflection on the fate of civilization. And \"If on a winter’s night a traveler\" (1983) mirthfully combines a detective narrative, a love story, and an elaborate satire on the publishing industry.\n\nCalvino re-settled in Italy in 1980. Yet his next novel, \"Mr. Palomar\" (1985), would touch upon Parisian culture and international travel. This book meticulously follows the thoughts of its title character, an introspective but well-off man, as he contemplates everything from the nature of the universe to expensive cheeses and comical zoo animals. \"Mr. Palomar\" would also be Calvino’s last novel. In 1985, Calvino suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died in Siena, Italy in September of that year.\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nItalo Calvino\n\nBy Way of an Autobiography\n\n(from The Uses of Literature)\n\nYou ask me for a biographical note—something that always embarrasses me. Biographical data, even those recorded in the public registers, are the most private things one has, and to declare them openly is rather like facing a psychoanalyst. At least I imagine so: I have never had myself psychoanalyzed.\n\nI will start by saying that I was born under the sign of Libra, so that in my character equilibrium and unbalance mutually correct each other’s excesses. I was born when my parents were about to come home after years spent in the Caribbean; hence the geographical instability that makes me forever long for somewhere else.\n\nMy parents’ knowledge was all concentrated on the vegetable kingdom, its marvels and its virtues. Attracted by another kind of vegetation, that of the written word, I turned my back on what they might have taught me; but wisdom in what is human also remained foreign to me.\n\nI grew up from infancy to youth in a town on the Riviera, huddled in its microclimate. Both the sea contained in its gulf and the massive mountains seemed to me protective and reassuring. I was separated from Italy by a narrow strip of coast road, and from the world by a nearby frontier. To leave that shell was for me to repeat the trauma of birth, but I only realize that now.\n\nHaving grown up in times of dictatorship, and being overtaken by total war when of military age, I still have the notion that to live in peace and freedom is a frail kind of good fortune that might be taken from me in an instant. Given this incentive, politics took up perhaps too great a part of the preoccupations of my youth. I mean too great for me, for what contribution I might have made, since things that seem distant from politics count far more as influences on the history (even political) of countries and of people.\n\nAs soon as the war was over, I felt the call of the big city more strongly than that of my provincial roots. I found myself hesitating for a while between Turin and Milan. My choice of Turin certainly had its own reasons and was not without consequences. Now I have forgotten both reasons and consequences, but for years I told myself that if I had chosen Milan, everything would have been quite different.\n\nI set my hand to the art of writing early on. Publishing was easy for me, and I at once found favor and understanding. But it was a long time before I realized and convinced myself that this was anything but mere chance.\n\nWorking in a publishing house, I spent more time with the books of others than with my own. I do not regret it: everything that is useful to the whole business of living together in a civilized way is energy well spent. From Turin, a city that is serious but sad, it often happened that I would slip down to Rome. (Incidentally, the only Italians I have ever heard speak of Rome in other than negative terms are the Turinese.) And so Rome is probably the Italian city where I have lived longest, without ever asking myself why.\n\nThe ideal place for me is the one in which it is most natural to live as a foreigner. Therefore, Paris is the city where I found my wife, set up home, and raised a daughter. My wife is a foreigner, too, and when the three of us are together, we talk in three different languages. Everything can change, but not the language that we carry inside us, like a world more exclusive and final than one’s mother’s womb.\n\nGrand Bazaar (Milan), September-October 1980. I realize that in this autobiography I have dwelt chiefly on the subject of birth, and talked about the later stages as of a continuation of my first seeing the light; and now I tend to go even further back, to the prenatal world. This is the risk run by every autobiography felt as an exploration of origins, like that of Tristram Shandy, who dwells on his antecedents and, when he gets to the point of having to begin to recount his life, finds nothing more to say\n\nItalo Calvin\n\nITALO CALVINO, THE NOVELIST, DEAD AT 61\n\nItalo Calvino, the master of allegorical fantasy who became Italy's leading contemporary novelist, died early today in a hospital in Siena, Italy, from the effects of a stroke he suffered on Sept. 6. He was 61 years old.\n\nMr. Calvino was among the handful of major novelists of international standing and was to have delivered the prestigious Norton lectures at Harvard this fall.\n\nJohn Updike, reviewing Mr. Calvino's ''Castle of Crossed Destinies,'' said that ''no living author is more ingenious.'' The novelist and critic John Gardner called Mr. Calvino ''possibly Italy's most brilliant living writer.''\n\nMr. Calvino was attracted to folk tales, knights and chivalry, social allegories and legends for our time: Fabulous and comic memory chips, slightly askew, seemed to be imbedded in his unprogrammed mind. His characters defied the malaise of daily life in the modern world.\n\nWhen The New York Times Book Review asked him last December what fictional character he would like to be, Mr. Calvino revealed himself and his artistic intentions in his answer:\n\n''Mercutio. Among his virtues, I admire above all his lightness in a world of brutality, his dreaming imagination - as the poet of Queen Mab - and at the same time his wisdom, as the voice of reason amid the fanatical hatreds of Capulets and Montagues. He sticks to the old code of chivalry at the price of his life, perhaps just the sake of style, and yet he is a modern man, skeptical and ironic - a Don Quixote who knows very well what dreams are and what reality is, and he lives both with open eyes.''\n\nMany Stories and Novels\n\nMr. Calvino has two books coming out in the United States this month. His new novel is ''Mr. Palomar.'' The title character, with a name that recalls the famous telescope, is a quester after knowledge, a visionary in a world sublime and ridiculous. He is impatient and taciturn in society, preferring to spin inner dialogues and listen to the silence of infinite spaces and the songs of birds.\n\nHis second book, also published here by Helen and Kurt Wolff Books, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, is a trade paperback edition of earlier stories titled ''Difficult Loves.'' Its characters include a soldier caught up in a private world of seduction and a middle-class woman who discovers she has lost the lower half of her bikini while swimming.\n\nMr. Calvino's other works include ''The Baron in the Trees,'' ''The Path to the Nest of Spiders,'' ''The Castle of Crossed Destinies,'' ''Invisible Cities,'' ''Italian Folktales,'' ''Cosmicomics'' and ''If on a Winter's Night a Traveler'' and ''Marcovaldo.'' The subjects range from takeoffs on Tarot cards to satires of literary styles.\n\nFor a while after World War II, he tried to write realistic stories. His early novel, ''The Path to the Nest of Spiders,'' described his experiences while fighting with the partisans against the Nazis and Fascists in the mountains of Liguria. Eventually, he came to realize that the only way for him to write was to invent. Straight science fiction seemed too remote. In ''Cosmicomics'' he came close to science fiction, inspired by the workings of the universe.\n\nFables Crisscrossing Time\n\nThereafter, he began to grapple with modern events in his own way through fables that often crisscross time. ''If the reader looks,'' he said, ''I think he will find plenty of moral and political ideas in my stories. I suffer from everyday life. When I'm depressed, I start with some euphoric image that transmits itself. Anyway, I'm sure that I'm a man of my times. The problems of our time appear in any story I write. Knights and chivalry - they are related to today's wars. No, I'm not writing in a vacuum. The fables just make use of a different language. Politics is marginal, but literature moves along by indirection.''\n\nBy contrast to his own work, Mr. Calvino ridiculed commercial fiction, including American novels. In ''If on a Winter's Night a Traveler,'' he invented a group called the Organization for the Electronic Production of Homogenized Literary Works. He said it was inspired by the market research conducted by the television networks and some book publishers to determine what audiences wanted to see and read - and then to manufacture it.\n\n''The Baron in the Trees'' is about a young Italian nobleman in the 18th century who rebels against parental authority and lives for the rest of his life in ''an ideal state in the trees.'' Louis Malle, the film director, has said he has long dreamed of turning the novel into a movie.\n\nTo help preserve literary traditions and promote new writers, Mr. Calvino edited a fiction series called ''Cento Pagi'' (One Hundred Pages), short novels that are published by Giulio Einaudi in Turin. He explained: ''Italian literature today does not have any real school or current but only complex personalities of writers who are so different. But difference is what is worth encouraging.''\n\nJoined Italian Resistance\n\nItalo Calvino was born on Oct. 15, 1923, in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba, of Italian parents, both of whom were tropical agronomists. Several years later they returned to San Remo, on the Italian Riviera. Mr. Calvino enrolled at the University of Turin, intending to study agronomy. After Italy's entry into World War II, as a compulsory member of the Young Fascists, he participated in the Italian occupation of the French Riviera, but in 1943 he joined the Italian Resistance and fought the Germans in the Ligurian mountains.\n\nIn 1945, he joined the Communist Party and began contributing to party journals. With the writers Cesare Pavese and Elio Vittorini, he shared an involvement in Socialist politics and in the neorealistic literary vogue. ''The Communist Party seemed to have the most realistic program for opposing a resurgence of Fascism and for rehabilitating Italy,'' he said, ''but I left the party in 1957, and today I am apolitical.''\n\nIn the opinion of his fellow-writers and critics, Mr. Calvino was a world-class author. His stories and especially his folk tales were translated in many countries.\n\nMargaret Atwood, the novelist, compared Mr. Calvino's urban landscapes to ''the early Fellini films.''\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, the American novelist whose work includes science fiction and fantasy, said, ''One of the innumerable delights of 'Italian Folk Tales' is its mixture of the deeply familiar with the totally unexpected. He is one of the best storytellers alive telling us some of the best stories in the world - what luck!''\n\n'A Valuable Service'\n\nCommenting on the same book, Anthony Burgess, the British novelist, said, ''Calvino has performed a valuable service to his own culture and, by extension, to our own. Reading his book, we are confirmed in our belief that human aspirations are everywhere much the same.''\n\nOf Mr. Calvino's ''If on a Winter's Night a Traveler,'' Michael Wood, the critic, wrote, ''Architect of scrupulously imagined, apparently fantastic, insidiously plausible words, Calvino occupies a literary space somewhere east of Jorge Luis Borges and west of Vladimir Nabokov. Borges dreams of libraries and Nabokov texts and commentaries, but Calvino pictures acres of vulnerable print, gathered into volumes but constantly menaced with dispersion or vertiginous error.''\n\nMr. Calvino himself talked enigmatically about his writing.\n\n''When I'm writing a book I prefer not to speak about it,'' he said, ''because only when the book is finished can I try to understand what I've really done and to compare my intentions with the result.''\n\nWhile he was writing ''Mr. Palomar'' two years ago, Mr. Calvino said, ''What can I say of the book I'm working on now is that it is a quite different one, but it also deals with the relations between a man and nature. Here the hero is called Mr. Palomar, like the astronomical observatory, but he observes only the nearest things around him.''\n\nMr. Calvino is survived by his wife, Chichita Singer, a former translator for Unesco in Paris whom he married in 1964, and a daughter, Giovanna.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on Sept. 19, 1985, Section B, Page 20 of the National edition with the headline: ITALO CALVINO, THE NOVELIST, DEAD AT 61.\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES"
