        "text": "Polytechnic culture progress requires an increasing interaction with human and social sciences, notably in the engineering field. This fructuous collaboration would be a fundamental tool in formulating innovative solutions to nowadays challenges. Due to this awareness, Politecnico di Torino founded, on October 2018, the SUSST (Human and Social Sciences for Science and Technology) group of work, which is rooted in the pioneering experience started 20 years ago by the Istituto Superiore di Scienze Umane, and which treasures PoliTO already existing experiences (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning and Department of Management and Production Engineering).\n\nSUSST core objective was to identify practical solutions that would place PoliTO among the best Northern-European Polytechnics, which in the last 20 years have been renewing their teaching offer, their research activities and their third mission. Following a well-established international path, they have been introducing the precious work of human and social scientists that operate in the field of science and technology. These actions are based on a number of fundamental assumptions:\n\nthe need to foster technical universities' social impact, adopting an interdisciplinary approach and a specific focus on nowadays controversies and challenges;\n\nthe will to shape high-level professionals and engineers, more aware of technology’s ethical, environmental and social impact;\n\nthe aim to strengthen student’s critical thinking and, more precisely, their overall comprehension of the techno-scientific solutions' framework, to get them more efficient.\n\nThe inclusion of social and human sciences into technical universities thus leads to a less sectorial teaching approach, contributing to the education of more flexible and high-skilled professionals, ready to faced nowadays complexities.\n\nConsidering this need of dialogue and confrontation with other Italian universities equally interested to renewing their teaching, SUSST group included various professors and experts: Juan Carlos De Martin (coordinator); Giovanni Durbiano (Politecnico di Torino); Giovanni Vincenzo Fracastoro (Politecnico di Torino); Vittorio Marchis (Politecnico di Torino); Maurizio Ferraris (Università degli studi di Torino); Peppino Ortoleva (Università degli studi di Torino); Cristina Becchio (IIT and Università degli studi di Torino); Paolo Volonté (Politecnico di Milano); Luca De Biase (journalist and writer).\n\nHere follows the outline review of SUSST activities:"
