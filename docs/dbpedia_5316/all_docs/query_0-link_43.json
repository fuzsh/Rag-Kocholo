        "text": "1923 Italo Calvino born in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba, to Mario Calvino, botanist and agronomist, and Evelina Mameli, professor of botany. In 1925 the family moves to San Remo, on the Italian Riviera, where Mario Calvino is curator of the botanical gardens. In 1927 his brother Floriano, a future geologist of international acclaim and prefect of the University of Genova, is born. Calvino spends his childhood on an estate abounding in exotic trees and plants, in the woods of the Maritime Alps, and on the rocks of the Italian Riviera. As a child, he prefers reading novels and poetry to the scientific studies his parents wish him to pursue. He remains in San Remo for twenty years. 1940 As a compulsory member of the Young Fascists, Calvino participates in the Italian occupation of the French Riviera. 1941 Starts studying agronomy at the University of Turin, where his father was professor of Tropical Agriculture. 1943 During the German occupation, Calvino joins the Italian Resistance and fights the Germans in the Ligurian mountains as a member of the Garibaldi Brigades. Calvino was later to write that it was during this time that he came to know the art of story-telling, when the partisans would recount their latest escapades over the campfire. 1944 Becomes a member of the Italian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Italiano, PCI). 1945 After the liberation, he settles in Turin where he studies Literature at the University. 1947 Graduates from the University with a thesis on Joseph Conrad.

Here he meets Cesare Pavese and Vittorini, two neo-realist writers who share literary ideas with Calvino and introduce him to Leftist politics. At Einaudi he develops friendships with Pavese, Vittorini, and Natalia Ginzburg, as well as with historians such as Franco Venturi and philosophers such as Norberto Bobbio and Felice Balbo.\n\nHe writes Sentiero dei nidi di ragno (The Path to the Nest of Spiders) in twenty days during December of 1946. It is the story of a boy from the slums who joins the partisans. It is published in 1947 and sells 6,000 copies, an unusually high number at that time. That same year he wins the Premio Riccione. Later, Calvino describes Path as \"the book of a very young man.\" The novel continues to fascinate, in part because the revised Italian editions of 1954 and 1964 were altered by Calvino. Also, either the translator or the publishers of the first English edition (1956) also altered or removed certain passages considered unsuitable for the sexual and political climate of the 1950s. To read the version revised by Calvino, as well as Calvino's revealing 1964 preface, see The Path to the Spiders' Nests, published in 1998 by Ecco Press. To better understand the author's voice at the time of the novel's writing, read the first English or American (1957) editions or, better yet, the 1947 Einaudi edition.\n\n1948 He leaves Einaudi to work full-time on the staff at L'Unita.

In September his tale Allez-hop is presented at the Fenice de Venecia. In November he visits the United States, where he remains for six months, four of them in New York City. The city creates quite an impression on Calvino (\"From the other side of the Atlantic, I feel a part of that majority of Italians who go to North America with such ease . . . and not of that minority who remain in Italy, perhaps because the first time I was in North America with my parents I was one-year-old. When for the first time I returned as an adult to the United States, I had a grant from the Ford Foundation which allowed me to wander throughout all of the United States without any obligation whatsoever. Naturally I visited the South and also California, but I always felt a New Yorker.

The death of Vittorini will mark a milestone in Calvino's life (\"the years immediately after his death coincided with a distancing on my part, with a change in rhythm . . . it's not that my interest in day-to-day living lessened, but I abandoned the impulse to be at the center first-hand. Primarily because, of course, I ceased to be young. Perhaps it's a metabolic process, something that comes with age, I'd been young for a long time, perhaps too long, suddenly I felt that I had to begin my old age, yes, old age, perhaps with the hope of prolonging it by beginning it early.\"). 1967 Calvino moves to Paris, where he stays, off and on, for the next fifteen years.
