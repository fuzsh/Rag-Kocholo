        "text": "Session: La trasmissione culturale durante il Ventennio Illustrazione e giornalismo come critica d’arte. Scipione e Mafai, «L’Italia Letteraria» e il racconto dell’arte europea nell’Italia fascista degli anni Trenta. Tra 1930 e 1931, Mario Mafai e Scipione (Gino Bonichi), protagonisti della Scuola di via Cavour (Scuola romana), il cui sviluppo fu seguito da vicino da Roberto Longhi, cominciano a collaborare continuativamente, l’uno come corrispondente da Parigi e l’altro come illustratore, con «L’Italia letteraria». Mafai firma importanti articoli dove è chiara l’adesione ad alcuni principi critici maturati all’interno del dibattito sull’arte e il Fascismo a partire dagli anni Venti. Parallelamente Scipione esegue e pubblica numerose illustrazioni satiriche, influenzate nello stile da precise personalità artistiche europee e dedicate a fatti e scenari nazionali e internazionali (Biennale, Quadriennale, Surrealismo, Galleria d’Arte Moderna di Roma, Reale Accademia d’Italia…) dove la sua capacità critica trova un’inaspettata e originale sintesi grafico-narrativa. Entrambi i contributi dei pittori romani meritano un più vasto approfondimento, ancora tralasciato dagli studi specialistici, e vanno inquadrati nell’ampio contesto culturale del Ventennio dai quali risultano profondamente influenzati. Le sortite critiche di Mafai e Scipione infatti, posseggono un alto valore esemplificativo all’interno del complesso sistema culturale dell’Italia entre-deux-guerres. L’intervento che propongo è quindi volto a dimostrare come la politica culturale fascista, col sostegno di molti intellettuali e artisti, fosse stata in grado, già nel 1930, di favorire l’elaborazione e l’applicazione di particolari strategie culturali e critiche finalizzate all’affermazione di un “primato” italiano anche in campo artistico-contemporaneo, per nulla disinteressato al contesto europeo. Illustration and journalism as art critic. Scipione and Mafai, «L’Italia Letteraria» and the story of European art in the fascist Italy of the thirties. Between 1930 and 1931, Mario Mafai and Scipione (Gino Bonichi), leaders of the Scuola di Via Cavour (Scuola Romana) - whose development was closely followed by Roberto Longhi – start to collaborate continuously with the review «L’Italia Letteraria». Mafai as correspondent from Paris and Scipione as illustrator. The first one signs important articles where it is clear his adherence to some critical principles matured in the debate on art and Fascism since the 1920s. At the same time Scipione performs and publishes numerous satirical illustrations, influenced by precise European artistic personalities and dedicated to national and international facts and scenarios (Bienniale of Venice, Quadrenniale of Rome, Surrealism, Gallery of Modern Art of Rome, Royal Academy of Italy …) where his critical ability finds an unexpected and original graphic-narrative synthesis. Both the contributions of the Roman painters deserve a broader study, still ignored by specialistic studies, and should be seen in the broad cultural context of the Fascist epoch from which they are deeply influenced. Mafai’s articles and Scipione’s illustrations, in fact, have an high exemplary value within the complex cultural system of the Italian entre-deux-guerres. The speech I propose is therefore aimed at demonstrating how the fascist cultural policy, with the support of many intellectuals and artists, was able, already in 1930, to promote the elaboration and the application of particular cultural and critical strategies aimed at the affirmation of an Italian \"primacy\" in the artistic-contemporary field, also in the European context.\n\nAngelo Rizzoli was one of Italy’s leading publishers in the interwar period and beyond, thanks to his business intuition and daring investments in the popular periodicals sector. In the 1920s and 1930s he published a galaxy of illustrated magazines aimed at the urban middle classes, which prove paradigmatic of a new form of Italian weeklies. The article posits that Rizzoli’s rotocalchi, based on entertaining content and photojournalism, were mediators par excellence in three areas. First, in publishing middlebrow fiction. Second, in translating short stories from linguistic and cultural milieus with a deliberate selection of specific literary genres, settings, and character types — a branding that emerges from investigating the weeklies Novella and Lei. Third, in the creation of a platform for interchange between literature, photography, and cinema, mainly in Cinema Illustrazione Presenta. Notwithstanding the obstacles put in their way by the Fascist regime and the censorship system...\n\nIn 1864 Florence briefly became the capital of the newly-founded Italian Kingdom. Though losing such a political status already in 1871, the city remained one of the intellectual hubs of the nation, ascending during the first decades of the XXth century to the role of Italy’s literary capital; there resided until WWII the most acclaimed writers, influential literary journals and prestigious literary publishers. This ascent began in 1903, when a 22 year-old aspiring philosopher, who will soon convert his rampant ambition to literary writing, Giovanni Papini (1881-1956), founded the philosophical journal «Leonardo» (1903-7), along with likely-minded peers. Around this journal and its successors «La Voce» (1908-1916) and «Lacerba» (1913-15) gathered a group of young intellectuals and artists, which I will define as the Florentine Avant-garde. Though usually not described as such by literary histories, this group of intellectuals can be read as a typical example of what the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu defines as an avant-garde: an alliance of new entrants in an intellectual field, whose interest in accumulating a symbolic capital of prestige and recognition explains their structural opposition to the dominant cultural hierarchy, as well as their need to overturn it. By drawing on Bourdieu’s sociological theory of cultural fields, I will explore the crucial role played by the journals «Leonardo», «La Voce» and «Lacerba» in the ascent of the Florentine Avant-garde. I will highlight its opposition not only to the established intellectual figures of the time, but also to another Avant-garde: the Futurists led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944). I will also recount how new periodicals were born from the struggles and secessions characterizing the life-span of this avant-garde, as well as of any other alliance of new entrants in a literary, artistic or intellectual field.\n\n“La Città di Riga” (literally, ‘The City of Riga’) is one of the most impressive and least-known Italian art magazines of the Seventies. Its only two issues, published in 1976 and 1977, saw the direct involvement of important Italian and international artists, critics, intellectuals, and militants: from Jannis Kounellis to Joseph Beuys, from Giorgio Agamben to Jasmina Tešanović, from Fabio Mauri to Bruce Nauman. The magazine acted at a peripheral level on many fronts: the magazine was printed by a small publishing house based in Pollenza - a village in the countryside of the peripheral region of the Marche - in years when the whole of Italy was still considered to be peripheral to the contemporary art system; additionally, the title of the magazine paid homage to a European city that was important for the cultural history of the twentieth century, but certainly peripheral compared to the great centres of the art world. The paper will present the history and main characteristics of the magazine, focusing on the reasons for its title and how its peripheral nature allowed it to meet the world of underground militancy and forge important political and cultural relationships. Through the magazine, it is hoped that a different image will emerge of Italian art in the late 1970s, a time of profound redefinition in which the peripheries played a decisive role, so much so that an Italian critic coined the term ‘provinciart’, referring to art produced and exhibited in provincial towns.\n\nIn 1903 Giovanni Papini, a 22 year-old aspiring philosopher who would soon channel his rampant ambition into literary writing, was a founder of the philosophy magazine Leonardo (1903-7). A group of young intellectuals and artists, here defined as the Florentine avant-garde, gathered around this periodical and its successors, La Voce (1908-1916) and Lacerba (1913-15). By drawing on Bourdieu’s sociological theory of cultural fields, this essay explores how the intellectuals writing for these periodicals established a powerful intellectual network and criticized the cultural institutions of the period: universities, the press, the literary and the artistic markets. By tracing individual biographies and intellectual trajectories, this essay also highlights the conflicts that arose within the Florentine avant-garde and between it and the Futurists led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti."
