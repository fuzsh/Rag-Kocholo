        "text": "Literature is an important source for sociological discourse, since in narratives it can find inspiration, a tool for comparison and a lively representation of its analytical categories. Thus, this paper aims to analyse some of the most important books of Italian mid-twentieth century industrial literature: Tempi Stretti and Donnarumma all’assalto by Ottiero Ottieri, first, then Il calzolaio di Vigevano and Il maestro di Vigevano by Lucio Mastronardi, and Memoriale by Paolo Volponi. The representations described in these books – immersed in the specific historical context of their time – reflect, consolidate, and interact with the categories and concepts through which many important sociological thinkers have interpreted industrial modernity. They can provide indications on the meanings through which it was possible to understand modern society. The main categories used in this analysis will be industrial work, the figure of the capitalist and social conflicts.\n\nThe end of World War II and the Liberation of Italy from the Nazi troops coincides with the emergence of a new role for intellectuals who try to juxtapose the physical liberation of the Italian peninsula with a cultural liberation. This is one of the reasons that led to the creation and circulation of many new journals that contributed to debates regarding contemporary society and the changes triggered by the advent of the &quot;second industrial revolution&quot;, the so-called &quot;Italian Miracle&quot;. One such journal, &quot;Il Politecnico&quot; (1945-1947) considers these changes by proposing an active role for the intellectual who must &quot;protect&quot; rather than &quot;console&quot; the human subject, as Elio Vittorini, the director of the periodical, states in the inaugural issue. This paper focuses on an excerpt from Franco Fortini&#39;s contribution to the final issue of the journal, his &quot;Diary of a Young Intellectual Bourgeois&quot;, in which he describes his exp...\n\nThis note focuses on two essays: 'La sfida al labirinto' by Italo Calvino and 'Del modo di formare come impegno sulla realtà' by Umberto Eco (henceforth 'Sfida' and 'Modo', respectively). Both essays were published in the Turin-based literary journal Il menabò in 1962, in the midst of a debate surrounding the connection between industry and literature that had originated in the previous number of the publication. From different angles, and with only partially divergent arguments, both essays discuss literary and cultural responses to Italian industrialization. The first section of this note will compare the two essays and analyse their paratexts. The second part will highlight the subtle, yet pervasive influence of 'Modo' in Eco's later works, before moving to a discussion of the double consonance between, on the one hand, Calvino's discussion of maps in 'Sfida' and Fredric Jameson's idea of cognitive mapping, and on the other hand, between Eco's analysis of creative exhaustion in 'Modo' and John Barth's 'literature of exhaustion'. The note ultimately argues that 'Sfida' and 'Modo' represent not only a key step in their authors' intellectual paths, but also the first stirrings of Italian postmodernism.\n\nThis book explores the representation of industrial labor in Italian literature and film from the 1950s through the 1970s. The first article of the postwar Italian Constitution states that the Republic is founded on labor. Forces across the political spectrum, from Catholic to communist, invested labor with the power to build a new national community after Fascism and war. The 1950s-1970s saw dramatic transformations, in economic, social and cultural terms, as labor moved from agriculture to industry and a whole generation of Italian writers and filmmakers used literature and cinema to interpret – and influence – these changes and to capture the new experiences of industrial labor. The essays in this book offer a comprehensive panorama of this generation’s work, examining key questions and texts, set against the context of history and theory, gender and class, geography and the environment, as well as their precursors and present-day successors.\n\nThis paper proposes a semiotic model for research in the field of Italian literature on the theme of work for the years 1995-2015. Focusing on Greimas' theory of semiotic squares and on the actantial model, I focused on three basic relationships within the labour market: the contrast between stories in the context of the factory and the office, between local and global settings, and between the inclusion and exclusion of the worker-figure. I obtained a general structure of the story comprising a sequence of six events: admission, convocation, trauma (or loosening of work relationships), suspension, rescue (true or false), and inertia. L'articolo propone un modello semiotico per la ricerca nel settore della narrativa italiana sul tema del lavoro degli anni 1995-2015. Riallacciandomi alle categorie greimasiane dei quadrati semiotici e del modello attanziale, mi sono concentrato su tre relazioni fondamentali interne al mondo del lavoro: le opposizioni tra racconto di fabbrica e di ufficio, tra ambientazione locale e globale, tra inclusione o esclusione del personaggio-lavoratore. Ne ho ricavato una struttura generale del racconto di sei sequenze: l'ammissione, la convocazione, il trauma (o allentamento del rapport di lavoro), la sospensione, il soccorso (vero o falso), l'inerzia."
