        "text": "Stormwater washing off land is the largest source of pollution to the White Clay Creek. Almost all of the rain falling on roofs, driveways, roads, parking lots, mowed lawns, and patios ends up as stormwater runoff.\n\nIn contrast, rain falling on forests and meadows gradually soaks into the sponge-like soils; pollutants are filtered out, groundwater is replenished, and stream water swings between flood and drought levels are evened out, preserving more constant stream flows and protecting aquatic life.\n\nGreen Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) practices can help capture, detain, and infiltrate rain, mimicking natural ecosystems. GSI systems are proven to simulate natural soil filtering and reduce stormwater volumes and speeds.\n\nYour green lawn is not so green; in fact, mowed lawns shed almost as much rain (~90%) as paved surfaces (100%)! Smaller lawns also cut down on mowing and fertilizer/pesticide applications.\n\nWell managed GSI projects also enhance community beauty, increase property values (5% or more), and provide vital habitat for birds and pollinators.\n\nCatch the Rain is for landowners in the White Clay watershed who are interested in beautifying their property while simultaneously managing stormwater runoff from rain events. It is especially applicable to older subdivisions and properties lacking existing stormwater management practices. Your project could be as simple as planting native shade trees over your driveway, installing an eye-catching bed of native wildflowers, or catching the rain from your roof to reuse on your lawn or garden. These small projects capture water at the source and are relatively inexpensive, with a large effect on runoff. Catch the Rain projects can ‘green’ your neighborhood, boost your property values, save you money, and help the White Clay flow clear.\n\nWant to learn more about Catch the Rain?\n\nLearn how the Catch the Rain Program works.
