        "text": "Northwest rain: too much in the winter, too little in summer\n\nThe Northwest gets a lot of rain in the winter, so much it causes problems like flooding, sewer overflows, stream erosion, and polluted runoff into our waterways. But all summer we get very little rain (less than Tucson, Arizona).\n\nIt’s hard to store enough rainwater to last long enough for summer irrigation. You need large cisterns or multiple rain-barrels to store enough water to make any difference. Simple practices like amending soil with compost, mulching, and smart watering are the first steps to storing and conserving water.\n\nUsing rainwater is easy and Seattle residents can get a great deal on rain barrels.\n\nBuy a rain barrel\n\nSeattle Rain Barrel User's Guide (PDF) - Learn more, including calculating how much rain you can gather and store.\n\nRain barrels and cisterns help reduce stormwater runoff and protect our waterways. Follow these links to learn about several ways you can help.\n\nManaging Stormwater at Home (PDF) - Tips for reducing runoff, like amending soil with compost, planting trees, and installing rain gardens and cisterns. And learn about RainWise rebates.\n\nPrevent Pollution - Tips for protecting our waterways in your yard, your neighborhood, and around Puget Sound.\n\nHow much rainwater can I catch?\n\nPuget Sound averages about 3 feet of rain per year, but 3/4 of it falls from October to March. Most areas in the region average less than 3 inches total rainfall for June, July, and August.\n\nTo determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain.\n\nThis formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch:\n\nRain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.623* x (portion of building footprint)\n\n*One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.623 gallons of water.\n\nFor example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event:\n\nRain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.623) x (1,400) = 218 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof)\n\nStorage is limited to the capacity of your system. Added capacity helps your system be prepared for dry spells. Practically though, most homeowners don’t have room to store the thousands of gallons they use in landscape irrigation through our dry summers, and the large cisterns to do it would take a very long time to pay back. Capacity and cost are directly related: decide how much you want to spend on storage. Natural Yard Care practices like building soil with compost and mulching, choosing low-water use plants, and Smart Watering practices all have much shorter paybacks—and grow healthier lawns and gardens too. So, you may want to choose to use all those practices and simple indoor water conservation practices before investing in big rainwater collection systems.\n\nSeattle Area Average Monthly Rainfall\n\nMonth Jan.
