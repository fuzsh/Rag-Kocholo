        "text": "Watching 'Twisters' at the drive in was an awesome experience, but an Oklahoma drive in had a very special guest at it this weekend.\n\nThe Original 'Twister' Drive In Scene\n\nOne of the more memorable scenes from the 1996 'Twister' movie is when a tornado touches down while the storms chasers are watching 'The Shining' at the drive in. In the film, The Galaxy Drive In is in Oklahoma. Sadly, the Galaxy Drive In is a fake drive in that the crew created in Guthrie, Oklahoma. However, Guthrie is home to a REAL drive in that is still open to this day.\n\nBeacon Drive In in Guthrie, Oklahoma\n\nThe Beacon Drive in has been open since 1950 in Guthrie, Oklahoma and I road tripped up to check out. It's not every day you can say you saw the Twister sequel in the town where they filmed the original one at. Plus, I found out a very special guest was in attendance and made the trip worth it.\n\nOriginal Twister Truck Was at the Beacon Drive In\n\nParked right in front of the screen was the original truck from the first 'Twister' movie. The truck that was originally used to transport Dorthy around before it flips over in the movie. The truck had a nice little sign in front that I will let you read below.\n\nDescription of Twister Truck\n\nAs you can see from the description, this truck has been through a lot. Looks like it spent sometime in a museum, then in California, and now it's back in Oklahoma where it deserves to be. Four trucks were used in filming, two were destroyed, and the only other one is in a car museum in Tennessee.\n\nDorothy Along for the Ride\n\nIf you had any doubt this was the Twister truck driving down the road. Dorothy II is hanging out in the back ready to enter the suck zone of a tornado.\n\nShameless Photo With the Truck\n\nHad to snag a photo with the truck. Was it worth the 2.5 hour drive to see Twisters at this drive in? Hell yeah it was! I got to see a piece of movie history and see Twisters under the stars, what could be better? The drive in itself had extremely nice staff and you can tell this place has been around since the 1950's. The food is pretty basic for a drive in. Just popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, and some packaged ice cream. Still, was great to check another drive in off the list. If you want to follow the Twister truck, it has it's own Facebook page. That's how I found out it was going to be at the Beacon.\n\nFollow the Twister Truck on Facebook"
