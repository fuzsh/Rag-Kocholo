Add that humidity, and heat index levels near 106 are expected both days.\n\n• Oriental NC Forecast\n\n• Oriental Weather Station\n\n2:22p The last time there was a chance of tropical storm formation was about 3 weeks ago. This time of year, it’s unusual for the Atlantic to be this quiet for so long.\n\nThere is now something brewing. From the National Hurricane Center:\n\nAn area of low pressure could form in the central portion of the Tropical Atlantic in a few days. Thereafter, environmental conditions appear generally favorable for some slow development of this system this weekend into early next week as it moves westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph.\n\n• Formation chance through 48 hours…low…near 0 percent.\n\n• Formation chance through 7 days…low…20 percent.\n\nWhile this could form, NHC still pegs it as 80% that nothing forms in the next week. There are other tropical waves moving west across Africa, however. A busy storm September on the Atlantic is more likely than not.\n\nNOAA’s Climate Prediction Center has a forecast graphic that peaks into September:\n\nIt seems likely that come September we will see storms moving across the Atlantic, with a question we’ve asked before: to the Gulf? veering north and staying at sea? or…\n\n• Hurricane Center\n\nMonday August 26, 2024\n\n4:07p A sail race with some history is coming to Oriental this weekend.\n\nThe “Oar Race” is Saturday Aug 31, from New Bern to Oriental. Sunday is the Lexus Cup (formerly the Michelob Cup) – the boats race from Oriental back to New Bern. More info is at this link.\n\nThe Oar Race is named for an oar. It’s not just any oar – it’s one that was on a small ship during the evacuation of Dunkirk in WW2.\n\nTownDock wrote a story about the history of the race back in 2010… read on.\n\n9:01a They were designed by iconic naval architect Carl Alberg, and dubbed as “America’s littlest yacht.”\n\nIt is the 19’ Cape Dory Typhoon. The folks at Bow To Stern in Oriental have a small fleet of them.\n\nEvery Monday night they are holding what is called “Open Sailing” – you get to go sailing for the evening on a Cape Dory Typhoon. 25 bucks. It starts at 5. More info here.\n\nIdeal conditions for a calm sail – 5 to 10 knots on the Neuse.\n\n7:16a Sunny and mid 80s today, then summer temps return Tuesday and for the rest of the week.\n\n• Oriental NC Forecast\n\n• Oriental Weather Station\n\n• Neuse River Marine Forecast\n\n7:11a Casa Que Pasa (aka the Taco truck) on Hodges St is getting set to open this morning. 8a-2p, Fri-Mon.\n\nSunday August 25, 2024\n\n10:18a Congratulations to the Oriental Dragon Masters, who reigned victorious in their division at Saturday’s 2024 Oriental Dragon Boat Festival @ River Dunes. The winning team:\n\nAnd a video of the race that won the day:\n\nHere are the results from all three divisions in the 2024 Oriental Dragon Boat Festival:\n\n9:47a Is this October? While some may miss the normal heat & humidity, this may be the most civilized run of August weather in memory.\n\nclick image for larger view\n\nWarmer today, but not much. High low 80s.\n\n• Oriental NC Forecast\n\n• Oriental Weather Station\n\n• Neuse River at Oriental Water Level Gauge\n\n• Neuse River Marine Forecast\n\nSaturday August 24, 2024\n\n9:24a The taco truck (“Casa Que Pasa”) on Hodges Street quietly opened this morning. TownDock crew was wandering by, and became their first cash customer:\n\nMartha, Pete (at the grill) and Cody Newman\n\n(click photos for larger view)\n\nThe shrimp burrito was delicious. Casa Que Pasa may only be open a few hours today. Martha Newman says they plan to be open 8a-2p, Fri-Mon, but initially there may be shorter hours.\n\nFriday August 23, 2024\n\n4:08p Dragon boat races and a charity golf tournament, live music and food trucks. It’s August in Oriental.\n\nThe Brewery features a new food truck tonight: Big E Dogs & Tacos, on site now until 8p.\n\nBrant Island Strings plays from 6-8 in the beer garden. Down the road at the Red Rooster, Ken Belangia starts at 7p.\n\nSaturday’s Oriental Farmer’s Market runs from 8-11a on Hodges Street. The Pamlico County Health Department offers free mammogram screenings from 9a-2p.\n\nOver at River Dunes, it’s the Oriental Dragon Boat Festival. Arrive early (9a) for opening ceremonies, the Parade of Teams, and to get a good spot – races run from 10a – noon, and 12:30p – 3p.\n\nOver in Minnesott Beach, the Oriental Woman’s Club hold their annual charity Golf Tournament. Play is $60, with a 50/50 raffle, a chance at a $10k hole-in-one, and more. Registration is 8-8:45. Shotgun start at 9a.\n\nJasmine Tasty Thai is at the Brewery Saturday from 4-8p, with Patrick Bliss in the beer garden from 5-8p.\n\nSunday, join Oriental United Methodist Church for riverside services in Lou Mac Park at 8:30a. At noon, join friends and family at the church for a memorial service for Rolf Anselm. His artworks will be on display, as will some of his gadgets. Rolf was 94.\n\nThe Brewery hosts a Potluck Social Sunday at 3p, followed by Trivia with Emily at 4p.\n\nIt’s all in What’s Happening.\n\n10:52a The TownDock landscape technology team has been in action this morning (two humans, a ladder and a Sawzall). The HarborCam view had been blocked by summer growth – all clear again:\n\n9:34a Hurricane season has been so quiet, we’ve overheard some folks postulating that “we’re not gonna get nothin’ this year.”\n\nThat could be true, but it might be best to assume otherwise.\n\nEarlier this year, NOAA (and others) put out dire hurricane season forecasts that this would be a super busy season. While TownDock Senior Management is not a fan of trying to forecast a season, there is still plenty of season ahead.\n\nThis NOAA graphic of when storms historically happen explains:\n\nNOAA’s Climate Prediction Center is hinting that there could be storm formation coming:\n\nMeanwhile, the Atlantic remains quiet.\n\n• Hurricane Center\n\n8:25a Oriental’s Dollar General is closed. The fire dept was called yesterday, reporting smoke in the air. No fire, but the air handling system had to be turned off. The store was closed as of about 10:30a Thursday.\n\nIt’s not clear when it will re-open.\n\nWednesday August 21, 2024\n\n9:55a Old Drum, Bluefish and Flounder – they’re all in the waters around Oriental. TownDock caught up with Keith Bruno at Endurance seafood to find out what he’s catching now, and what’s next.\n\nFor fresh fish, stop by Endurance Seafood and say hi to Keith & Zach. For recreational fishermen seeking bait – they have lots of mullet available. 252-249-2558.\n\nNote: Apologies for the microphone wind noise. TownDock has ordered a new wireless mic system that should solve this.\n\n8:47a An August luxury: it snuck down to 60 degrees early this morning. The unusually (for August) coolish temps will stay with us a few days, thanks to cool air delivered by northeast winds.\n\nThe Neuse marine forecast:\n\nThose winds will keep high temps near 80 til at least Saturday:\n\nThey are also nudging up water levels a bit.\n\n• Oriental NC Forecast\n\n• Oriental Weather Station\n\n• Neuse River at Oriental Water Level Gauge\n\n• Neuse River Marine Forecast\n\nOn the Atlantic: Bupkis. Nada. Zip. Nuttin’.\n\nFor now.\n\n• Hurricane Center\n\nTuesday August 20, 2024\n\n3:15p At last week’s town board meeting, a recommended member of a town auxiliary board was rejected by three members of the town board. No reason was stated.\n\nOriental resident Joe Valinoti writes in.\n\n11:20a Ernesto’s hurricane career is over.\n\nPost-tropical Ernesto is east of Newfoundland, and the storm’s remains appear to be bound for Scotland.\n\nNo disturbances (potential storm systems) on the Atlantic, for the moment. Names coming up for the 2024 season: Francine, Gordon, Helene, Isaac.\n\nSomeone is missing their experienced green dinghy. Found adrift just outside the harbor, now tied up near the town dock:\n\n7:06a Sometime between today and Thursday, Apple Lane at Mildred St will be closed (intermittently) to traffic. From Town Hall:\n\nBay River Metropolitan Sewer District (BRMSD) will be working at the cross section of Mildred St. Tuesday-Thursday (Aug 20-22), removing and replacing drain tile and sewer piping across Apple Lane. There will be a significant and uncrossable opening in the road for the duration of that work.\n\nTiming depends on the schedule of the contractor, but will be in the window above. It will NOT be the entire three days.\n\nLabyrinth, by Lynn Hines\n\nThe Community Labyrinth, installed in 2019, is starting to show signs of the many visitors who’ve walked its surface. With restoration in mind, OUMC is selling matted watercolor prints of the Labyrinth. Each print is $30.\n\nYou can also make a direct donation for the Labyrinth’s restoration and maintenance, or donate your time. Find out more here.\n\nThe Labyrinth was dedicated in April 2019. Here’s a video from that moment:\n\nTown & County announcements:\n\n• Pamlico County Health Department offers vaccines and long-acting birth control for insured, underinsured, and uninsured.
