These songs are a nice mix of beautiful odes to someoneâs life and ones that have stuck around for a while, for good reason:\n\n1. âYou Can Close Your Eyesâ â James Taylor James Taylor can sing this song at my funeral any day. Itâs a mix of everything youâd ever want from a funeral song â soft, acoustic, uplifting and thoughtful. Itâs sad, but not sad enough to make you want to curl up in a ball and cry.\n\n2. âTears in Heavenâ â Eric ClaptonThe first funeral I ever attended was for my grandfather, and my mom requested that they play this song in honor of him. Iâll never forget the feeling I felt when I first heard it. This will always be one of my top picks.\n\n3. âHallelujahâ â Jeff BuckleyJeff Buckley makes it on this list again with his rendition of âHallelujahâ. A funeral service isnât complete without this song, plus the words practically ooze out of his mouth. Simply amazing.\n\n4. âSomewhere Over the Rainbowâ â Israel KamakawiwoâOleAhhhh, this song. The ukeleighleigh, his comforting voice, the beautiful lyrics. I can just imagine the doves being released to this song on the day I leave this world. âAnd I think to myself, what a wonderful worldâ¦â.\n\nallowfullscreen=âallowfullscreenâ&gt;\n\nFuneral songs that will open the floodgates\n\nThese songs could help you to get all of the tears out of the way, which is very important at a service. Itâs good to feel your feelings, and these beautiful songs will take you there:\n\n5. âFeels Like Homeâ â Chantal Kreviazuk Thereâs a scene in the movie âMy Sisterâs Keeperâ where this song plays and I absolutely lost it the first time I heard it. Truly a classic.\n\n6. âAsleepâ â The SmithâsThe Smithâs are arguably one of the most talented bands of all time. This song is a little âdarkâ, but the lullaby-like melody make it a beautiful song to play at a funeral. Itâs comforting lyrics sing âDonât feel bad for me, I want you to know, deep in the cell of my heart, I really want to go. There is another world, there is a better worldâ.\n\n7. âSatisfied Mindâ â Jeff BuckleyThis song is easily the most beautiful song I have ever heard. I dare you to listen to this rendition and not cry. Seriously, it takes my breath away every time I hear it. Not only does it help you reflect the life lived, but it also inspires you to live a life based on love and compassion, not material things: âMoney canât buy back all your youth when youâre old, a friend when youâre lonely, or peace to your soulâ.\n\n8. âBlowerâs Daughterâ â Damien RiceAlthough the lyrics cut me deep, thereâs something about this song thatâs quite romantic. Itâs one of those songs I could imagine playing at a funeral where someoneâs life â and love â were cut short. Sad, yet beautiful.\n\nFuneral songs for the hopeless romantics\n\nIf you really want a good cry, or there is a beautiful romance that has been affected by the loss that deserves an ode, these songs will certainly fit the situation:\n\nâHalo (Acoustic)â â Beyonce\n\nThis version of the famously known song by the Queen of pop, Beyonce, was performed for a child who was terminally ill in the hospital, and it really touched our hearts. The lyrics, the way itâs delivered, and the love you can feel emanating from Beyonce.\n\nâOnly For Youâ â Heartless Bastards\n\nThis acoustic, yet modern song is a great expression of love without being all big and ballad-y. Really great for Indie lovers and people of all ages. The melody will take you into a love trance.\n\nâIâll Be Seeing Youâ â Billie Holiday\n\nAs it was so infamously played in the cry-festival of a movie, The Notebook, this one is a classic for long time lovers. We love a good romance story, and this is the perfect song that embodies romance.\n\nFuneral songs that are inspiring and uplifting\n\nOnce all the tears have been shed, itâs time to shake it up a little. After tears come, there is a beauty that is light and vulnerable, and these songs truly embody that:\n\nâFollow the Sunâ by Xavier Rudd\n\nThis song isnât about death or dying, but it really represents the circle of life that we find ourselves in these beautiful moments of coming together to celebrate life.\n\nâEverywhereâ â Michelle Branch\n\nââCause youâre everywhere to me / And when I close my eyes itâs you I see / Youâre everything I know / That makes me believe / Iâm not alone.â How can you argue with the inspirational spark these lyrics have? Sure, we can lose a loved one. But theyâre always with us, and this song says it beautifully so!\n\nâWherever You Will Goâ â The Calling\n\nJust like Michelle Branch says, this song really reminds us that we can always keep our loved oneâs with us. With a romantic tone to it, this song is really great for the times at a funeral where you are looking at photos, memories, and remembering in an uplifting kind of way.\n\nâSpirit In The Skyâ â Norman GreenbaumNot only is this song a crowd-pleaser, but the lyrics are perfect for an uplifting celebration of life: âWhen I die and they lay me to rest/ Gonna go to the place thatâs the best/ When I lay me down to die/ Goinâ up to the spirit in the skyâ.\n\nFuneral songs for a beautiful celebration of life\n\nIf youâre hosting a celebration of life, or a beautiful outdoor event packed with people, these songs will get people up out of their chairs and even dancing, if the mood strikes:\n\nâDrops of Jupiterâ â Train\n\nThis song is a really great song for a release of some sort â whether itâs balloons, confetti, or a dove. It really reminds us of the big open sky that shows us where heaven is. Plus, itâs a classic that everyone loves!\n\nâIâve Had The Time Of My Lifeâ â Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes\n\nWho do you know who doesnât love the movie Dirty Dancing? Itâs a classic! And if you have dancing at your celebration of life, this is the perfect last dance song!\n\nâForever Youngâ â Rod Stewart\n\nThese lyrics say it all: âMay good fortune be with you, may your guiding light be strong, / Build a stairway to heaven with a prince or a vagabond. / And may you never love in vain. / And in my heart you will remain. / Forever young.â\n\n19. âElephant Gunâ â BeirutThe lyrics have nothing to do with death at all, but thereâs something about this song that reminds me of a New Orleans jazz funeral procession, and I quite enjoy it. Give it a listen.\n\nFuneral songs that will make you laughâ¦\n\nNow that weâve got the sad stuff out of the way, letâs pick up the pace and look at some songs that truly define âcelebration of lifeâ. These songs are perfect for those who want anything but a traditional funeral, and certainly for people with a great sense of humor. Letâs check them out:\n\n20. âKeg On My Coffinâ â The Push StarsDespite its title, this song is oddly soft, sweet and soothingâ¦ and also my top light-hearted choice for a funeral song: âDrink up life like a river âtill the pizza man delivers/And smile and know I loved you âtil the endâ.\n\n21. âDropkick Me Jesusâ â Bobby BareThis song truly speaks for itself. A true classic. Ant the only way you can appreciate it is if you listen to the lyrics, so here you go:\n\nDropkick me, Jesus, through the goalposts of life / Bring on the brothers whoâve gone on before / And all of the sisters whoâve knocked on your door / All the departed, dear, loved ones of mine / Stick âem up front in the offensive line\n\n22. âRoll Me Up And Smoke Me When I Dieâ â Willie NelsonBecause everyone needs a little sense of humor, even during the saddest of times. This classic hit is perfect for a full-on fun family who can handle a little humor at a celebration of life.\n\n23. âProp Me Up Beside The Jukebox (If I Die)â â Joe DiffieThis is one of those songs that is guaranteed to get everyone talking about the good times at a funeral. Itâs uplifting, comforting and you canât beat Joe Diffieâs voice. My favorite part of the song? âFix me up with a mannequin, just remember, I like blondes/ Iâll be the life of the party, even when Iâm dead and gone.â\n\n24. âRing of Fireâ â Johnny CashA funeral director once told me this is one of his most popular off-beat requests for songs to play at a funeral. Something about this song makes me want to dance, and why not dance while celebrating someone who has a sense of humor?\n\nâHighway to Hellâ â ACDC\n\nPerhaps the most âedgyâ of the songs on here, this one is perfect for the funny father figure in the family who listened to rock music all day. A classic.\n\nThe official âTop Funeral Songs to Celebrate Lifeâ playlist\n\nPacked with tons of inspiration for your next celebration of life, give our free playlist a listen!\n\nFeeling inspired by all these funeral songs, but still not sure what kind of music to play at your next funeral service?
