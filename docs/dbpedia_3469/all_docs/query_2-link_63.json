        "text": "Storm Drainage System:\n\nEver wonder where the rain water runs off to when it storms? Rain that washes over the streets, lawns and parking lots flow directly in to the Merced River, through the Delta, and eventually into the ocean. This water is never cleaned and can pollute our surface waters with things like pet waste, litter, used oil, fertilizers, metals, soil and other potentially toxic substances.\n\nSo, who’s responsible for making sure the water our community depends on is clean?\n\nWe all are. And here’s the best part, it doesn’t require a lot of effort – just common sense. The following are some areas that we all can pitch in prevent pollution in our community and truly only send rain down the drain.\n\nILLICIT DISCHARGES:\n\nAn illicit discharge is an unlawful act of disposing, dumping, spilling, emitting, or other discharge of any substance other than storm water into the storm water drainage system. The storm water drainage system includes streets, ditches, catch basins, yard inlets, culverts, and rivers.\n\nBelow are some examples of illicit discharges:\n\nPaint being poured into or near the storm drainage system\n\nChanging oil or antifreeze over or near a storm drainage system\n\nWashing vehicles or equipment where the runoff could drain into the storm drainage system\n\nWashing dumpster pads and allowing the runoff to drain into the storm drainage system\n\nWhat information should be reported when calling in an illicit discharge to the Water Pollution Hotline (209) 394-8044\n\nWhat time did you see the discharge?\n\nIt is important that illicit discharges are reported immediately so the person(s) responsible can be found and the discharge can be cleaned up and corrected as soon as possible. We want to respond as quickly as possible to prevent pollution to our environment.\n\nWhere did you see the discharge?\n\nPlease give us an address, intersection, business name, or landmark to help us quickly find the illicit discharge.\n\nWhat do you think the discharge is?\n\nPlease let us know if you think it was a paint spill, oil spill, sewer leak, or another type of illicit discharge.\n\nWas there a business involved?\n\nPlease tell us the name of the business involved to help us eliminate the discharge as quickly as possible and provide enforcement action when needed.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the Illicit Discharge Ordinance (625, 12-1-2015)\n\nBelow are examples of exceptions:\n\nAir conditioning condensate\n\nFirefighting runoff\n\nDechlorinated swimming pool discharges\n\nGroundwater discharges from sump pumps\n\nRemember, exception flows are only considered allowable if they are not transporting or comingling with a pollutant source!\n\nILLICIT CONNECTIONS:\n\nAn illicit connection is an unlawful connection from the sanitary sewer system into the storm water drainage system or directly into lakes and streams.\n\nBelow are some examples of Illicit Connections:\n\nFloor drains from inside a building going into the storm drain system instead of the sanitary sewer system\n\nProviding a washing machine connection into a ditch or storm drain structure instead of the sanitary sewer system\n\nInstalling a new plumbing line from a toilet into a storm water drainage structure instead of the sanitary sewer system\n\nILLEGAL DUMPING / TRASH:\n\nIllegal dumping into storm drains is a huge problem. Used motor oil, discarded food, trash and other debris are just some of the items routinely dumped into storm drains throughout the city. Curbside catch basins are the entry points of the storm drain system, which eventually discharges out into the river. Additionally, catch basins filled with debris can create unhealthy conditions in residential neighborhoods by becoming a breeding ground for pests and disease.\n\nResidents are encouraged to report illegal dumping by calling the Water Pollution Hotline (209) 394-8044.\n\nI have some paint, paint thinner, chemicals, batteries at home that I need to dispose of. How do I do it?\n\nThe Merced County Regional Waste Authority ca n accept these items and more. Please visit their website to see a full list of accepted items and operating hours.\n\nhttp://www.mcrwma.org/\n\nFundraising Car Washes and Commercial Mobile Cleaning Pollution Prevention\n\nWash water from fundraising car washes and mobile cleaning / pressure washing activities produces runoff which carries pollutants such as oils, metals, sediment, and detergents into our community’s storm water conveyance system and eventually into our local waterways. In efforts to reduce discharges from these activities the following pollution prevention practices should be followed:"
