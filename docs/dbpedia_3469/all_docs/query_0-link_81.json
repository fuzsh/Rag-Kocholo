        "text": "The worst part about summer is everyone demanding that you go outside. Fortunately, here comes the Paramount to save all you indoor-loving film fans, with the announcement of the 2017 Summer Classic Film Series.\n\nThe begins on May 25 with a 75th anniversary screening of Casablanca, and that's just the first of three big birthday screenings that weekend, with Titanic hitting the big 2-0, and a glorious half-century for Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nThrow in Terrence Malick's Badlands, and that quartet makes up Star Crossed Lovers, just one of a broad selection of special programming that makes up the schedule at the Paramount and neighboring Stateside. Two giants of cinema get special nods, starting with Peter Sellers, Scene Stealer, followed by Hitchcock Week's celebration of one of the masters of crime cinema. Known for the wicked senses of humor, both would appreciate other program highlights like Woody Allen's Bananas and Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, thumbing their noses at oppression under the banner of Taking Down Dictation.\n\nAlongside Summer Film Series constants like the ongoing family festival and the celebration of foreign cinema, there are as always a few one-off special events. Austin Film Festival will be bringing in screenwriter Dale Launer for a special 25th anniversary screening of raucous legal comedy My Cousin Vinny, while Sam Beam (better known in musical circles and Iron and Wine) will present a 45th anniversary screening of John Huston's hard-hitting boxing drama Fat City.\n\nThe season winds down with the Taming of the West (including seminal Texas cowboy tale Red River and the state's defining epic Giant), before wrapping up on September 2 with Gone With the Wind. Coincidentally, the Civil War mainstay is just one of the titles whose props and production documents are stored at the Harry Ransom Center. So schedule a trip to the archives in June and July to see original material from Taxi Driver and A Streetcar Named Desire at the center's upcoming Stories to Tell exhibition before their screenings.\n\nThe Paramount Summer Classic Film Series presented by Capital Metro runs May 25 to Sept. 2. Read the full schedule below and film details pulled from the Paramount's press release. Tickets can be purchased at www.austintheatre.org/film/classic-film-series.\n\nCasablanca\n\n7pm Thurs 5/25.\n\n(1942, 102min/b&w, 35mm) Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. Directed by Michael Curtiz. The world may have changed since 1942, but weâve always had Casablanca. Celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, this mesmerizing classic continues to age well, thanks to Bogart and Bergman and Rains and the list goes on, not to mention a screenplay that will never be topped. If youâve never teared up to La Marseillaise and applauded the beginning of a beautiful friendship with a huge audience in a grand movie palace before, this is the year to do it! Film Fan Members will be treated to an Opening Night Party at 6pm before the screening with free beer/wine/popcorn and free admission.\n\nTitanic\n\n7:30pm Fri 5/26.\n\n(1997, 195min/color, DCP) Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, and Bill Paxton. Directed by James Cameron. Much like my heart, the legend of this blockbuster will go on and on. Thanks to the star-making performances of the perfectly-cast Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the measured direction of James Cameron, this disaster film takes great care to establish a captivating romance before fate steps in.\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\n2pm Sun 5/28.\n\n(1967, 111min/color, 35mm) Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Gene Wilder. Directed by Arthur Penn. With its frank discussions of sexuality and famously violent conclusion, Arthur Pennâs era-defining masterpiece suggested that, where Hollywood was going, strict censorship could not follow. This thrilling film made Faye Dunaway a star, announced the arrival of two Genes (Hackman and Wilder), and won Estelle Parsons an Academy Award.\n\nBadlands\n\n4:10pm Sun 5/28.\n\n(1973, 95min/color, DCP) Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek, Ramon Bieri, and Warren Oates. Directed by Terrence Malick. In 1973, this stunning film heralded first-time director Terrence Malick as an unmatched conjurer of cinematic beauty. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek star as young, disillusioned lovers who embark on a murderous journey based loosely on a real-life crime spree that rocked the country in the late 1950s. 4:10pm\n\nThe Lion in Winter\n\n7:30pm Tues 5/30.\n\n(1968, 134min/color, DCP) Peter OâToole, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Merrow, John Castle, Timothy Dalton, and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Anthony Harvey. If youâve always wanted a Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf set in Medieval times, have I got a movie for you! Cinematic titans Peter OâToole (as King Henry II) and Katherine Hepburn (as his estranged wife Eleanor of Aquitane) engage in deliciously written verbal warfare while their three sons each plot to assume the throne. This remarkable cast was playing a game of thrones before HBO was even born. OâTooleâs archives were recently acquired by the Ransom Center. 7:30pm Tues 5/30.\n\nTaxi Driver\n\n7pm Wed 5/31, 9:20pm Thurs 6/1.\n\n(1976, 114min/color, DCP) Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, and Cybill Shepherd. Directed by Martin Scorsese. Martin Scorsese etched himself into the Hollywood firmament with this portrait of an unstable cab driver who believes itâs his duty to rid New York City of riff-raff. Though a certain quote steals most of the press, the film has much more going for it, including gorgeous cinematography and a typically masterful score from Bernard Herrmann.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\n9:10pm Wed 5/31, 7pm Thurs 6/1.\n\n(1951, 122min/b&w, 35mm) Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden. Directed by Elia Kazan. As far as first impressions go, you could do worse than Brando does here in his first major movie role, screaming his wifeâs name so loudly that it still echoes today. Finally, moviegoers around the world could see what all the fuss was about on Broadway, with Kazanâs assured direction and Alex Northâs weary, sweat-drenched score elevating the Tennessee Williams play to new heights. Taxi Driver and A Streetcar Named Desire are both featured in the Ransom Centerâs current exhibition, Stories to Tell, which will be open through July 16.\n\nBananas\n\n7pm Mon 6/5.\n\n(1971, 82min/color, 35mm) Woody Allen, Louise Lasser, and Carlos Montalban. Directed by Woody Allen. After the surprise success of his mockumentary Take The Money And Run, Woody Allen received a bigger budget for this next film, a madcap, Marx Brothers-esque depiction of a New Yorker who becomes engulfed in a Latin American revolution. Allen continues to lay on the high-concept comedy, including a memorable scene involving sports commentator Howard Cosell.\n\nThe Great Dictator\n\n8:40pm Mon 6/5.\n\n(1940, 126min/b&w, 35mm) Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, and Jack Oakie. Directed by Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin finally took the plunge into talking pictures more than ten years after sound arrived in Hollywood, and he makes the biggest splash possible with this dark satire aimed squarely at Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. His ability to make serious political statements while retaining his unmatched sense of humor was another testament to his cinematic genius.\n\nPaths of Glory\n\n7pm Tues 6/6.\n\n(1957, 88min/b&w, DCP) Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, and Adolphe Menjou. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. This stunning anti-war film stars the always fascinating Kirk Douglas as a French colonel in World War I who must defend the soldiers under his command against unwarranted accusations of cowardice. If a film has this much to say, and says it with such panache, it must be a Stanley Kubrick film.\n\nFull Metal Jacket\n\n8:45pm Tues 6/6.\n\n(1987, 116min/color, DCP) Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent DâOnofrio, and Lee Ermey. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. 30 years after Paths of Glory, Kubrick returned to the battlefield with this Vietnam-set tale of U.S. Marine recruits who make their way from the training ground to a devastating warzone. The anti-war sentiment remained the same, though the laxer censorship of the 1980s allowed Kubrick to make his points more brutally.\n\nSchindlerâs List\n\n7pm Wed 6/7.\n\n(1993, 195min/b&w & color, DCP) Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Steven Spielberg. In what would prove to be the most personal undertaking of his career, director Steven Spielberg set out to depict the horrors of the Holocaust through the singular story of Oskar Schindler, an unsung hero who saved more than a thousand lives by employing Jewish refugees in his factory. A devastatingly emotional experience, and one of the greatest films ever made. All ticket proceeds will be donated to the Shoah Foundation.\n\nWings of Desire\n\n7pm Thurs 6/8.\n\n(1987, 127min/b&w & color/German w/English subtitles, DCP) Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, and Peter Falk. Directed by Wim Wenders. This hauntingly romantic film, set against the backdrop of a West Berlin still suffocated by the Berlin Wall, follows an angel named Damiel who struggles with the desire to become human and experience a normal life, especially after falling in love.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night\n\n7pm Tues 6/13, 9pm Thurs 6/15.\n\n(1967, 110min/color, DCP) Sidney Poitier, Rod Steiger, Warren Oates, and Lee Grant. Directed by Norman Jewison. As the brilliant detective Virgil Tibbs, Sidney Poitier finds himself stranded in a southern town overflowing with racial prejudice. As the local sheriff in over his head, Rod Steiger must decide whether to accept Tibbsâ help or let a murder go unsolved. Needless to say, sparks fly.\n\nThe French Connection\n\n9:05pm Tues 6/13, 7pm Thurs 6/15.\n\n(1971, 104min/color, DCP) Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey, and Roy Scheider. Directed by William Friedkin. Gene Hackman stars as Detective Jimmy âPopeyeâ Doyle, a hard-edged New York cop who snuffs out crime by any means necessary. This gritty thriller was the first R-rated movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and its car chase sequence is the stuff of legend.\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\n7pm Fri 6/16.\n\n(1982, 90min/color, DCP) Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Robert Romanus, and Phoebe Cates. Directed by Amy Heckerling. Sean Penn launched his career into the stratosphere with his starring role here as lovable stoner Jeff Spicoli, not to mention that this perfect teen comedy also marked the film debuts of Nicolas Cage and Forest Whitaker, the screenwriting debut of Cameron Crowe, and the feature-length debut of Amy Heckerling, whose Clueless screens later this summer.\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\n8:45pm Fri 6/16.\n\n(1998, 117min/color, DCP) Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. The stakes seemingly couldnât be lower, yet this enduring cult classic is absolutely riveting from start to finish. Jeff Bridges turns in a career-defining performance as The Dude, who abides over the strangest cast of characters ever assembled. Some may call it a âstoner comedy,â but, in the hands of the Coens, itâs so much more.\n\nJailhouse Rock\n\n3:15pm Sat 6/17.\n\n(1957, 96min/b&w, 35mm) Elvis Presley, Judy Tyler, Mickey Shaughnessy, and Dean Jones. Directed by Richard Thorpe. Though Elvis Presley starred in many musicals, arguably none were as entertaining as this black-and-white riot. As recently-paroled teenage crooner Vince Everett, Presley develops a rock-and-roll stage presence much like the one he thrilled audiences with in real life, leading to a hip-swiveling dance number that had the whole world talking. 3:15pm Sat 6/17.\n\nSaturday Night Fever\n\n5:05pm Sat 6/17.\n\n(1977, 118min/color, DCP) John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Barry Miller, and Donna Pescow. Directed by John Badham. John Travolta used the role of dancing king Tony Manero as a launchpad to the stars, turning the film into one of the most treasured artifacts of the disco era in the process. Of course, it didn't hurt to have some of the Bee Gees' catchiest tunes adorning the soundtrack.\n\nCool Hand Luke\n\n2pm Sun 6/18.\n\n(1967, 126min/color, 35mm) Paul Newman, George Kennedy, Strother Martin, and Jo Van Fleet. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg. What weâve got here is an absolute classic. Paul Newman gives a staggering performance as Luke, a man who refuses to cooperate with a failed system, eats a whole bunch of eggs, and recognizes that, sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand.\n\nDr. No\n\n4:25pm Sun 6/18.\n\n(1962, 110min/color, 35mm) Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Joseph Wiseman, Jack Lord, and Bernard Lee. Directed by Terence Young. James Bond roared onto the screen and never looked back in this thrilling debut, thanks in large part to Sean Conneryâs charismatic and captivating portrayal. Bond journeys deep underground to thwart the evil schemes of the villainous Dr. No, a founding member of the criminal group SPECTRE that continues to plague 007 to this very day.\n\nWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\n\n1pm Sat 6/17.\n\n(1971, 100min/color, DCP) Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson, and Peter Ostrum. Directed by Mel Stuart. Roald Dahl wasnât your typical childrenâs author, and no film adaptation has captured his perspective quite as well as this beloved musical. The key to its success is, of course, Gene Wilder in the title role â the twinkle in his eye and gentleness in his voice will never cease to capture the imagination.\n\nMy Cousin Vinny\n\n7pm Mon 6/19.\n\nThe Austin Film Festival presents a 25th anniversary screening with the screenwriter Dale Launer in attendance.\n\nSelena\n\n7pm Tues 6/20, 9:20pm Wed 6/21.\n\n(1997, 127min/color, 35mm) Jennifer Lopez, Jackie Guerra, Jon Seda, and Edward James Olmos. Directed by Gregory Nava. Though her life was tragically cut short at the age of 23, Tejano music sensation Selena left us a legacy defined by the pure joy of her stage presence and musicianship. In this poignant film, Jennifer Lopez, on the cusp of stardom herself, captures the generosity of spirit and raw talent that defined Selenaâs all-too-short career.\n\nCoal Minerâs Daughter\n\n9:25pm Tues 6/20, 7pm Wed 6/21.\n\n(1980, 125min/color, DCP) Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Levon Helm, and William Sanderson. Directed by Michael Apted. Setting a high standard that most biopics have since failed to meet, director Michael Apted expertly tells the story of Loretta Lynn and her remarkable rise to fame. Sissy Spacek received the Best Actress Oscar for her chameleonic work here, ably supported by Tommy Lee Jones as Lorettaâs (mostly) supportive husband Doolittle.\n\nWorking Girl\n\n7pm Thurs 6/22, 9:05pm Fri 6/23.\n\n(1988, 113min/color, DCP) Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Melanie Griffith, Alec Baldwin, Joan Cusack, and Kevin Spacey. Directed by Mike Nichols. In this dazzling romantic comedy, Melanie Griffith discovers that even her own ideas arenât safe in a workplace filled with traitorous bosses and lecherous coworkers. She finally decides to take matters into her own hands, and hilarity ensues in this third Best Picture nominee for director Mike Nichols.\n\n9 to 5\n\n9:10pm Thurs 6/22, 7pm Fri 6/23.\n\n(1980, 109min/color, DCP) Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, Dabney Coleman, and Sterling Hayden. Directed by Colin Higgins. Only a classic cinematic buffoon like Dabney Coleman would be foolish enough to cross Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton at the same time. Naturally, this terrific trio gives their boss exactly whatâs coming to him and revolutionize the workplace for the better, leaving a smile on our faces and a song permanently stuck in our heads.\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\n2pm Sat 6/24.\n\n(1965, 174min/color, DCP) Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, and Richard Haydn. Directed by Robert Wise. This beloved musical, full of unforgettable songs and sumptuously filmed on location in Austria, continues to win over generation after generation. Even as World War II looms on the horizon, the film canât help but be a joyous celebration of the healing power of music and the importance of family.\n\nThe Graduate\n\n5:30pm Sat 6/24, 4:15pm Sun 6/25.\n\n(1967, 106min/color, DCP) Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, and Katharine Ross. Directed by Mike Nichols. Dustin Hoffman soared to super-stardom with his iconic performance in this second smash directorial effort from Mike Nichols, who, along with screenwriters Calder Willingham and Buck Henry, created one of the most culturally relevant films ever made. Brand-new 4K DCP restoration courtesy of Rialto Pictures!\n\nTootsie\n\n7:30pm Sat 6/24, 2pm Sun 6/25.\n\n(1982, 116min/color, DCP) Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Bill Murray, Sydney Pollack, and Geena Davis. Directed by Sydney Pollack. This beloved comedy always appears near the top of every âFunniest Movies of All Timeâ list. Dustin Hoffman plays a struggling thespian who, in an act of career desperation, pretends to be a woman and gets a regular part on a soap opera. It goes without saying that some complications arise.\n\n8 1/2\n\n7:30pm Tues 6/27.\n\n(1963, 138min/b&w/Italian w/English subtitles, 35mm) Marcello Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, and Sandra Milo. Directed by Federico Fellini. A film director suffers an artistic crisis that quickly turns into a life crisis in this Federico Fellini masterpiece frequently named one of the ten best films of all time. Ask any filmmaker and theyâll likely cite this movie as a major inspiration.\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful\n\n7pm Wed 6/28.\n\n(1952, 118min/b&w, 35mm) Lana Turner, Kirk Douglas, Walter Pidgeon, and Dick Powell. Directed by Vincente Minnelli. A stunning look at the unsavory side of Hollywood, with Douglas as a shrewd film producer who will use and abuse anyone and everyone in his path to get to the top. If youâre looking for a lighthearted representation of the film industry, well ... weâre showing Singin' In The Rain this weekend.\n\nThe Player\n\n9:15pm Wed 6/28.\n\n(1992, 124min/color, DCP) Tim Robbins, Greta Scacchi, Fred Ward, Whoopi Goldberg, Peter Gallagher, and Vincent DâOnofrio. Directed by Robert Altman. Renowned director Robert Altman pulls no punches in this scathingly dark, satirical (hopefully?) takedown of Hollywood and the people who work there. Tim Robbins is pitch-perfect as a paranoid studio executive whoâs fending off a rival for his job while also fielding death threats from a screenwriter he once rejected.\n\nBoogie Nights\n\n7:30pm Thurs 6/29.\n\n(1997, 147min/color, 35mm) Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, and Heather Graham. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. P.T. Anderson won instant acclaim in 1996 for his debut Hard Eight, but that film in no way prepared audiences for this rollicking disco-era epic. Out of nowhere, here was a young filmmaker wielding a megawatt cast to tell a story about the porn industry in which sex is the least interesting part.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit\n\n3:05pm Sat 7/1, 4pm Sun 7/2.\n\n(1988, 104min/color, DCP) Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and Kathleen Turner. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Someone has pinned a murder on cartoon star Roger Rabbit, and anti-toon detective Bob Hoskins is the only man who can prove the beleaguered rabbitâs innocence. Kids will love the still-remarkable blend of live-action and animation, while adults will get a kick out of the references to Chinatown and other cinematic greats.\n\nSinginâ in the Rain\n\n5pm Sat 7/1, 2pm Sun 7/2.\n\n(1952, 103min/color, 35mm) Gene Kelly, Donald OâConnor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Cyd Charisse. Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. Take a plot about the arrival of talking pictures, throw in Gene Kellyâs choreography and a hit parade of great songs, and you get a film buffâs dream musical. From Kelly twirling in the rain to Jean Hagen throwing diction to the wind, is it any wonder this was declared the greatest American musical of all time?\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\n1pm Sat 7/1.\n\n(1999, 90min/color, DCP) Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Vin Diesel. Directed by Brad Bird. At the time of its release, this animated gem was under-promoted and under-seen; little did the moviegoing public know they were missing one of the smartest and most imaginative family films ever made. This poignant story of a young boy and his new robot friend from outer space is guaranteed not to leave a dry eye in the house.\n\nThe Seventh Seal\n\n7pm Wed 7/5.\n\n(1957, 96min/b&w/Swedish w/English subtitles, 35mm) Max Von Sydow, Bengt Ekerot, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Nils Poppe, and Bibi Andersson. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. A medieval knight arrives home from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged by the Black Death plague. He then encounters Death himself and tries to stall his own demise in Ingmar Bergmanâs remarkable masterpiece.\n\nWild Strawberries\n\n8:55pm Wed 7/5.\n\n(1957, 92min/b&w/Swedish w/English subtitles, 35mm) Victor Sjostrom, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Bjornstrand. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. In one of Ingmar Bergmanâs most poignant films, an old professor makes a long journey to his alma mater to receive an honorary degree. Along the way, he reevaluates his life and remembers his idyllic childhood. A contemplative gem.\n\nCleo from 5 to 7\n\n7pm Thurs 7/6, 9:05pm Fri 7/7.\n\n(1962, 89min/b&w/French w/English subtitles, DCP) Corinne Marchand, Jose Luis de Vilallonga, and Michel Legrand. Directed by Agnes Varda. In Agnes Vardaâs achingly poignant reflection on mortality, a young pop singer must kill two hours in Paris awaiting the results of a medical exam that may prove she has cancer. During that time, she meets friends and strangers, none of whom make the genuine connection she so desperately needs.\n\nJules and Jim\n\n8:45pm Thurs 7/6, 7pm Fri 7/7.\n\n(1962, 106min/b&w/French w/English subtitles, DCP) Jeanne Moreau, Oskar Werner, and Henri Serre. Directed by Francois Truffaut. Legendary director Francois Truffaut teamed with a mesmerizing trio of actors to create one of the most memorable love triangles in movie history and a defining work of the French New Wave, chock full of the visual and editorial touches that define the true art of filmmaking.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort\n\n4:40pm Sat 7/8.\n\n(1967, 126min/color/French w/English subtitles, DCP) Catherine Deneuve, George Chakiris, Francoise Dorleac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, and Gene Kelly. Directed by Jacques Demy. An unmistakable influence on last yearâs indie darling La La Land, this musical jaunt through the seaside town of Rochefort combines the insouciance of French youth with the athletic vitality of Gene Kellyâs American musical heyday. Of course, the fact that Kelly is actually in the picture doesnât hurt.\n\nBlack Narcissus\n\n7pm Sat 7/8.\n\n(1947, 102min/color, DCP) Deborah Kerr, Jean Simmons, Sabu, David Farrar, and Flora Robson. Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. A group of nuns attempt to create a convent in an isolated valley in the Himalayas, only to become increasingly distracted by matters of the heart. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgerâs sensuous classic might just be the reason they invented color.\n\nTokyo Story\n\n2pm Sun 7/9.\n\n(1953, 137min/b&w/Japanese w/English subtitles, DCP) Chishu Ryu, Chieko Higashiyama, and Setsuko Hara. Directed by Yasujiro Ozu. Often praised as one of the greatest films ever made, this Yasujiro Ozu masterpiece follows an elderly couple trying to visit their grown children, all of whom seem too busy with their own lives to spend time with their parents.\n\nSwiss Family Robinson\n\n2pm Sat 7/8.\n\n(1960, 126min/color, DCP) John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Sessue Hayakawa, and Tommy Kirk. Directed by Ken Annakin. Of the many smash-hit Disney literary adaptations of the Fifties and Sixties, this epic adventure story was one of the very best. When a seafaring family is chased off course by pirates and shipwrecks on a deserted island, they decide to make a new home for themselves far from civilization.\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\n7pm Mon 7/10.\n\n(1940, 112min/b&w, 35mm) Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey, and Roland Young. Directed by George Cukor. This love triangle has three sharp points, with Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart at their graceful, debonair best. Hepburn, having been labelled âbox office poisonâ in Hollywood, successfully engineered the transition of this comedy from stage to screen, earning herself an Oscar nomination and the adoration of audiences everywhere.\n\nThe Palm Beach Story\n\n9:10pm Mon 7/10.\n\n(1942, 88min/b&w, DCP) Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea, Mary Astor, and Rudy Vallee. Directed by Preston Sturges. Writer/director Preston Sturges works his usual screwball comedy magic in this dizzy tale of a married couple, played by Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea, whose relationship has soured. As in most screwball movies, a divorce proves exceedingly hard to come by, especially since theyâre both still in love.\n\nThe Awful Truth\n\n7pm Tues 7/11, 9:10pm Wed 7/12.\n\n(1937, 91min/b&w, DCP) Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, Alexander DâArcy, and Cecil Cunningham. Directed by Leo McCarey. Has any onscreen couple enjoyed better chemistry than Irene Dunne and Cary Grant do in this riotously funny comedy? Though theyâre at each otherâs throats and threatening divorce when we first meet them, it seems clear the two warring lovebirds are meant for each other. Watching them figure this out is cinematic bliss.\n\nAn Affair to Remember\n\n8:50pm Tues 7/11, 7pm Wed 7/12.\n\n(1957, 115min/color, DCP) Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, Richard Denning, Neva Patterson, and Cathleen Nesbitt. Directed by Leo McCarey. Twenty years after the comedic heights of THE AWFUL TRUTH, director Leo McCarey and star Cary Grant reteamed to explore the dramatic side of romance in this globetrotting love story. McCareyâs classic has proven to be an inspiration to modern romantic films, most noticeably Nora Ephronâs Sleepless In Seattle.\n\nTop Hat\n\n7pm Thurs 7/13.\n\n(1935, 99min/b&w, 35mm) Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes, and Eric Blore. Directed by Mark Sandrich. Whenever Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers meet, dazzling footwork and mistaken identities are sure to follow. Thatâs certainly the case in this film, one of the pairâs absolute best, as Astaireâs American dancer falls for Rogersâ British beauty. Featuring the legendary âCheek to Cheekâ sequence and many other equally fascinating rhythms.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee\n\n8:55pm Thurs 7/13.\n\n(1934, 107min/b&w, 35mm) Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes, and Eric Blore. Directed by Mark Sandrich. The brightest and breeziest of all the Astaire/Rogers pairings, this delightful film follows Rogers as she tries to get a divorce by any means necessary while Astaire falls head over heels for her. Featuring classics âNight and Dayâ and âThe Continental.â\n\nAn American in Paris\n\n3:15pm Sun 7/16.\n\n(1951, 113min/color, 35mm) Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, and Oscar Levant. Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Gene Kelly plays an American World War II vet focused on making it as a painter in Paris, at least until he becomes distracted by one of the locals played by Leslie Caron. Dancing and romance ensue, all set to the unmistakable music of George Gershwin.\n\nRoman Holiday\n\n5:20pm Sun 7/16.\n\n(1953, 118min/b&w, DCP) Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, and Eddie Albert. Directed by William Wyler. Audrey Hepburn won the Best Actress Oscar for her first major screen role in this story of a bored princess who yearns for a normal life and escapes to Rome, where she meets Gregory Peckâs roving reporter. Naturally, love is in the brisk Italian air.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\n1pm Sun 7/16.\n\n(1939, 101min/b&w and color, 35mm) Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton. Directed by Victor Fleming. Most of us have already fallen in love with this timeless film, thanks to countless television broadcasts and home video releases. But the Yellow Brick Road and those ruby slippers have never shimmered as brightly as they do on the Paramount screen in glorious 35mm!\n\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo\n\n7pm Tues 7/18.\n\n(1985, 82min/color and b&w, 35mm) Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, and Danny Aiello. Directed by Woody Allen. One of Woody Allenâs most imaginative films, this one stars Farrow as a depressed waitress stuck in an abusive marriage whose only escape is the adventure movies she loves to watch. When the hero of her favorite film suddenly emerges from the screen into the real world, she comes face to face with her dreams.\n\nPennies From Heaven\n\n8:40pm Tues 7/18.\n\n(1981, 108min/color and b&w, 35mm) Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters, Jessica Harper, and Vernel Bagneris. Directed by Herbert Ross. This astonishing tribute to Depression-era musicals features Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters lip-synching to period-appropriate songs and hoofing it to genuinely unforgettable choreography. The story itself is unavoidably sad, given the setting, but the musical numbers into which these despairing characters escape are lighter than air.\n\nManhattan\n\n7pm Wed 7/19.\n\n(1979, 97min/b&w, DCP) Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Michael Murphy, Mariel Hemingway, and Meryl Streep. Directed by Woody Allen. Thousands of films have been shot in the Big Apple, but none have so exquisitely captured the romance of this great American city quite like this breathtakingly filmed love letter. Woody Allen plays (believe it or not) a neurotic Manhattanite struggling with relationships, all set to one of Allenâs typically well-curated soundtracks.\n\nThe Godfather\n\n7:30pm Thurs 7/20.\n\n(1972, 175min/color, DCP) Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Marlon Brando roared back into the spotlight as mafia boss Vito Corleone in this gangster classic that also made a big star of Al Pacino, Brandoâs onscreen son who tries to avoid becoming part of the family business. Credit to director Francis Ford Coppola, who transformed Mario Puzoâs pulpy novel into a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nHarold and Maude\n\n7pm Fri 7/21.\n\n(1971, 91min/color, DCP) Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Vivian Pickles, and Cyril Cusack. Directed by Hal Ashby. Dissatisfied with life and ignored by his own mother (who barely even notices his elaborately staged fake suicides), Harold spends his time attending strangersâ funerals. So does Maude, a 79-year-old with an infectious lust for life. Together, they embark on one of the most extraordinary romances in the movies, all set to the blissful music of Cat Stevens.\n\nRaising Arizona\n\n8:50pm Fri 7/21.\n\n(1987, 94min/color, DCP) Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter, Trey Wilson, and John Goodman. Directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. After the dark, neo-noir approach of their directorial debut Blood Simple, the Coen brothers went in a more lighthearted direction with this unforgettable follow-up. Nicolas Cageâs ex-con and Holly Hunterâs ex-cop get married and discover theyâre unable to have a kid, leading them to pilfer someone elseâs.\n\nFat City\n\n2pm Sun 7/23.\n\nIron and Wine presents John Huston's 1972 boxing drama.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n\n7pm Tues 7/25.\n\n(1942, 88min/b&w, 35mm) Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt, and Agnes Moorehead. Directed by Orson Welles. If youâre Orson Welles, how do you follow Citizen Kane, the most audacious directorial debut of all time? With a literary adaptation about a spoiled rich kid ruining his motherâs life, of course! Though perhaps not as stylistically revolutionary as KANE had been, this period piece is compulsively watchable. If you binged Downton Abbey, youâll love this.\n\nAll That Heaven Allows\n\n8:45pm Tues 7/25.\n\n(1955, 89min/color, 35mm) Jane Wyman, Rock Hudson, and Agnes Moorehead. Directed by Douglas Sirk. Jane Wyman is unforgettable as a widow who falls in love with Rock Hudsonâs intelligent landscape designer, only to discover that her society friends and even her own children disapprove of the relationship. Master of melodrama Douglas Sirk paints a devastating picture of a woman whose choices are not her own, a concept with which we are sadly still too familiar.\n\nThe Pink Panther\n\n7pm Wed 7/26, 9pm Thurs 7/27.\n\n(1963, 121min/color, 35mm) David Niven, Peter Sellers, Robert Wagner, Capucine, and Claudia Cardinale. Directed by Blake Edwards. David Niven accepted the classy lead role of Sir Charles Lytton in this heist comedy thinking it would be a major boost for his career. But Peter Sellers had other plans, and the more director Blake Edwards saw of Sellersâ indomitable and hilarious Inspector Clouseau, the less screen time Niven received.\n\nA Shot in the Dark\n\n9:20pm Wed 7/26, 7pm Thurs 7/27.\n\n(1964, 103min/color, 35mm) Peter Sellers, Elke Sommer, George Sanders, and Herbert Lom. Directed by Blake Edwards. David Niven is nowhere to be seen in this Pink Panther sequel, with Peter Sellersâ Inspector Clouseau having run off with the first film and the entire franchise. The result: a film that is even funnier than the first, following Sellers as he rather unfortunately falls in love with the main suspect in a murder and works desperately to prove her innocence.\n\nLolita\n\n7pm Fri 7/28.\n\n(1962, 153min/b&w, DCP) James Mason, Shelley Winters, Sue Lyon, and Peter Sellers. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. In theory, this Stanley Kubrick adaptation of the legendary novel should focus on James Masonâs predatory professor and Sue Lyonâs title character. But guess who didnât do the reading? Peter Sellers manages to steal every scene heâs in and even plays multiple âcharactersâ two years before doing the same in Dr. Strangelove.\n\nBabe\n\n1pm Sat 7/29.\n\n(1995, 91min/color, DCP) James Cromwell, Magda Szubanski, and Christine Cavanaugh. Directed by Chris Noonan. Youâd think it would be difficult to take a movie filled with talking animals seriously. But, while this lovely family film is certainly very funny, it also manages to be profoundly touching, thanks to James Cromwellâs extraordinary performance as a farmer who teaches a pig how to herd sheep. Required viewing for kids and âkid-herdersâ alike.\n\nThe General\n\n3pm Sat 7/29.\n\n(1926, 78min/b&w/silent w/English intertitles, DCP) Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender, and Jim Farley. Directed by Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton. Buster Keatonâs masterpiece works not only as comedy but also as an edge-of-your-seat chase film. Keaton weaves Civil War intrigue into this tale of a young man whose services are rejected by the Army but nevertheless finds a way to contribute. Keatonâs daring stuntwork puts modern computer-aided action sequences to shame.\n\nCity Lights\n\n4:30pm Sat 7/29.\n\n(1931, 86min/b&w/silent w/English intertitles, DCP) Charles Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill, and Harry Myers. Directed by Charles Chaplin. Every film fan is entitled to their own favorite Chaplin movie. But if yours is something other than this poignant masterpiece, meet me in the lobby because we need to talk. This simple tale of the Little Tramp and the blind flower girl who captures his heart will have you laughing for 90 minutes and crying for the rest of the year.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffanyâs\n\n2pm Sun 7/30.\n\n(1961, 115min/color, DCP) Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Patricia Neal, and Buddy Ebsen. Directed by Blake Edwards. Audrey Hepburn may not have had the chops to sing her own songs in My Fair Lady, but she hits all the right notes in this career-topping performance, especially when she poignantly delivers her unforgettable rendition of âMoon River.â\n\nClueless\n\n6pm Sun 7/30.\n\n(1995, 97min/color, DCP) Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, and Paul Rudd. Directed by Amy Heckerling. As if â¦ you could pass up seeing this 1990s teen comedy classic on the Paramountâs big screen! Chock full of great quotes, one-liners, and unmistakable 90s fashion, this gem essentially gave us Alicia Silverstone AND Paul Rudd, not to mention firmly establishing director Amy Heckerling as a master of putting a smile on the face of teen angst.\n\nNetwork\n\n7pm Tues 8/1.\n\n(1976, 122min/color, Digital) Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall. Directed by Sidney Lumet. One of the greatest casts ever assembled reading one of the sharpest scripts ever written â no surprise that this is one of the greatest films ever made. Paddy Chayefskyâs screenplay is so eerily accurate about the future of television that you wonât believe it was written in the 1970s, and the four members of this titanic ensemble give a master class in cinematic performance.\n\nA Face in the Crowd\n\n9:20pm Tues 8/1.\n\n(1957, 125min/b&w, 35mm) Andy Griffith, Patricia Neal, Walther Matthau, and Lee Remick. Directed by Elia Kazan. If your only impression of Andy Griffith comes from the aptly named Andy Griffith Show, prepare to be amazed. Under Elia Kazanâs direction, Griffith delivers a stunning performance here as Lonesome Rhodes, an alcohol-soaked folk singer who nabs a radio appearance and charms his way into the hearts and minds of middle America, to the eventual misfortune of everyone.\n\nThere Will Be Blood\n\n7:30pm Wed 8/2.\n\n(2007, 158min/color, 35mm) Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Kevin J. OâConnor, Ciaran Hinds, and Dillon Freasier. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Set against the backdrop of turn of the century oil production, Daniel Day-Lewisâs ruthless businessman confronts Paul Danoâs local preacher in this bristling depiction of religion and capitalism in America. Day-Lewis certainly earns the bounty of awards he received for this towering performance.\n\nSweet Smell of Success\n\n7pm Thurs 8/3, 9:15pm Fri 8/4.\n\n(1957, 97min/b&w, DCP) Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison, and Martin Milner. Directed by Alexander Mackendrick. High above the bristling New York City streets (captured in gorgeous black and white by famed cinematographer James Wong Howe) sits Burt Lancasterâs J.J. Hunsecker, a powerful gossip columnist whose influence holds the entire city hostage, and you wonât believe the lengths to which Tony Curtisâ press agent will go to please him.\n\nCitizen Kane\n\n8:55pm Thurs 8/3, 7pm Fri 8/4.\n\n(1941, 119min/b&w, 35mm) Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, and Agnes Moorehead. Directed by Orson Welles. The âfavorite movieâ of sheepish film school freshmen everywhere, this landmark film truly deserves all the accolades. Orson Welles, as both star and director, tells the story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper magnate rather unsubtly based on William Randolph Hearst, with incisive writing and revolutionary cinematography.\n\nE.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\n\n1pm Sat 8/5.\n\n(1982, 115min/color, DCP) Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton, and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Few things tug at the heartstrings like a story about kids and their dogs, except maybe one about a kid and an alien trying to find its way home. Drawing on Steven Spielbergâs greatest strengths as a director, this iconic film has mesmerized generations of kids while reminding grownups of their own childhood, a time when everything seemed possible.\n\nBack to the Future\n\n3:30pm Sat 8/5, 4:10pm Sun 8/6.\n\n(1985, 116min/color, DCP) Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Time travel-obsessed filmmakers have tried and failed for years to top this ingenious comedy about a teenager who stumbles into the past and accidentally prevents his parents from falling in love, threatening his very existence. The cast is note-perfect from top to bottom, and the script never fails to impress no matter how many times youâve seen it.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\n5:40pm Sat 8/5, 2pm Sun 8/6.\n\n(1981, 115min/color, 35mm) Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davies, and Denholm Elliott. Directed by Steven Spielberg. After winning over audiences as the cocky Han Solo in Star Wars, Harrison Ford brought that swagger down to earth as the remarkably athletic archaeologist Indiana Jones. In this debut, Indy must find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do, dodging giant boulders and poisonous vipers along the way. No one said academia was easy.\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\n7:30pm Tues 8/8.\n\n(1997, 138min/color, 35mm) Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito. Directed by Curtis Hanson. A shimmering ensemble of unforgettable characters populate this expertly plotted story of corruption, celebrity, and the tabloids that cover them. Has there ever been a more perfectly cast movie? Each of these movie stars is given the perfect role to play, resulting in a thriller you canât take your eyes off of.\n\nOut of the Past\n\n7pm Wed 8/9, 8:50pm Thurs 8/10.\n\n(1947, 97min/b&w, 35mm) Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas. Directed by Jacques Tourneur. The image of Robert Mitchum on the poster of this film, lurking in the darkness with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, has become the visual representation of everything film noir represents. Femme fatales and foreboding shadows abound in this story of a man who canât seem to escape his past.\n\nTouch of Evil\n\n8:55pm Wed 8/9, 7pm Thurs 8/10.\n\n(1958, 95min/b&w, DCP) Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, and Orson Welles. Directed by Orson Welles. Orson Wellesâ stunner is often considered the âgreatest B-movie of all time,â a label that fits this pulpy, brilliant masterpiece just fine. Charlton Heston, sporting the very best mustache-and-sunglasses combo in movie history, plays a detective dealing with a double dose of murder and corruption in this stylish marvel.\n\nThe Parent Trap\n\n1pm Sun 8/13.\n\n(1961, 129min/color, DCP) Hayley Mills, Maureen OâHara, Brian Keith, and Una Merkel. Directed by David Swift. Trailers for this delightful family film declared âStarring Hayley Mills AND Hayley Mills,â and audiences couldnât wait to see how the latest spark of Disney magic would allow an actress to share the screen with herself. As it turned out, the magic came from Mills herself, who capably plays two very different twin sisters and will have you singing âLetâs Get Togetherâ for weeks.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\n3:45pm Sun 8/13.\n\n(1962, 129min/b&w, 35mm) Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters, and Robert Duvall. Directed by Robert Mulligan. One of the most beloved novels of all time transitions to the screen in this unforgettable adaptation. Gregory Peck is a soft-spoken powerhouse as devoted father and lawyer Atticus Finch, tasked with defending an African-American man against false charges in the Depression-era South. In carrying out his duty, he sets an example for us all.\n\n12 Angry Men\n\n6:05pm Sun 8/13.\n\n(1957, 93min/b&w, DCP) Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and E.G. Marshall. Directed by Sidney Lumet. This provocative drama observes 12 jurors as they debate whether to convict a young boy of murder. Every juror except the stalwart Henry Fonda is ready to vote guilty and go home, leaving Fonda with the task of defending the boyâs innocence and upholding the system of justice. An inspirational dose of Fondaâs typical heroism, and a thrilling glimpse of the fragility of justice.\n\nVertigo\n\n7:30pm Tues 8/15, 7:30pm Wed 8/16.\n\n(1958, 128min/color, 70mm) James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. If labeling this dizzyingly brilliant work the âbest Hitchcock filmâ doesnât do it for you, what if I told you itâs often considered the greatest film ever made, period? This story of detective Jimmy Stewart falling in love with the woman heâs been hired to follow has ascended to great critical heights over the years, and when you see it in glorious 70mm youâll know why.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n7:30pm Thurs 8/17, 7:30pm Fri 8/18.\n\n(1968, 149min/color, 70mm) Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. From its startling depiction of our origins to its extraordinary imagining of our final evolutionary stage, this mind-altering journey proves to be more than just mutinous computers and balletic spaceships. Itâs Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarkeâs best guess at what makes us tick and where we may be headed. If youâve only seen it home, you havenât seen it.\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\n3pm Sat 8/19, 2pm Sun 8/20.\n\n(1962, 216min/color, 70mm) Peter OâToole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, and Claude Rains. Directed by David Lean. Epic films often trip themselves up by focusing too much on the scope and grandeur and not enough on the intimate character details. Not so with this legendary adventure, thanks in large part to Peter OâTooleâs titanic performance as the hero of the title. No matter how vast the scenery, we never lose sight of the man.\n\nRope\n\n7pm Tues 8/22.\n\n(1948, 80min/color, 35mm) James Stewart, John Dall, and Farley Granger. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcockâs first use of Technicolor and his representation of real-time continuity through one (not quite) continuous shot marks an intriguing detour in the directorâs career. Jimmy Stewart stars as a prep-school housemaster who may have inspired his students to murder in this adaptation of a play inspired by the real-life story of Leopold and Loeb.\n\nFrenzy\n\n8:35pm Tues 8/22.\n\n(1972, 116min/color, 35mm) Jon Finch, Alec McCowen, and Barry Foster. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Made in the twilight of his directing days, this Hitchcock crime thriller turns the genre on its head, revealing the identity of the murderer to the audience at the very beginning of the film. This unique approach changes how we view the movie, inviting or perhaps even forcing us to identify with the man we know to be the killer.\n\nThe Birds\n\n7pm Wed 8/23, 9pm Thurs 8/24.\n\n(1963, 119min/color, 35mm) Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, and Suzanne Pleshette. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock adapts yet another Daphne du Maurier novel, this time resulting in a tense, richly metaphorical horror film about a series of increasingly violent bird attacks that plague the town of Bodega Bay in California. These bizarre incidents leave themselves open to a wide variety of thematic interpretations, which is usually the sign of a great work of art.\n\nStrangers on a Train\n\n9:15pm Wed 8/23, 7pm Thurs 8/24.\n\n(1951, 101min/b&w, 35mm) Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, and Robert Walker. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. As you might have guessed, two strangers meet on a train, each of whom has a person in his life he wishes would âdisappear.â When one suggests that they âexchange murders,â with both men killing the otherâs intended victim to avoid any links to motive, things start to go downhill in this quintessential Hitchcock thriller.\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\n7pm Fri 8/25, 4:10pm Sat 8/26.\n\n(1959, 136min/color, 35mm) Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Writer Ernest Lehman was determined to pen âthe Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures,â and, by succeeding, he etched his name onto one of the all-time-great screenplays. Wrapped up in all this magnificent intrigue is Cary Grant, who once again finds himself framed for crimes he didnât commit. Has anyone had worse luck than Cary Grant?\n\nPsycho\n\n9:35pm Fri 8/25, 2pm Sat 8/26.\n\n(1960, 109min/b&w, 35mm) Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Janet Leigh. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. If youâve never experienced this landmark thriller, and have somehow avoided spoilers until now, you might consider living under a rock until tonight rolls around. Thereâs nothing more exciting than uncovering the secrets of the Bates Motel for the first time. And remember â it is REQUIRED that you see Psycho from the very beginning!\n\nThe Lodger (feat. live musical accompaniment by Graham Reynolds)\n\n3pm Sun 8/27.\n\n(1927, 91min/b&w/silent w/English intertitles, DCP) Ivor Novello, Marie Ault, and Arthur Chesney. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In this, his third silent film and first masterpiece, Hitchcock was already reaching the pinnacle of cinematic suspense, even without the use of sound. A landlady suspects that her new tenant, the mysterious Ivor Novello, might be the murderer who has been terrorizing the town in this narratively thrilling and visually stunning film. Graham Reynolds will accompany the film with his brand-new score commissioned exclusively for the Paramount Summer Classic Film Series.\n\nRed River\n\n7pm Tues 8/29, 9pm Wed 8/30.\n\n(1948, 133min/b&w, 35mm) John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Joanne Dru, and Walter Brennan. Directed by Howard Hawks. The unlikely duo of John Wayne and Montgomery Clift portray a father and adopted son herding their livestock along the inaugural cattle drive from Texas to Kansas, at least until they start to disagree over how to run the show. In his very first film role, Clift gives as good as he gets from The Duke.\n\nShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon\n\n9:30pm Tues 8/29, 7pm Wed 8/30.\n\n(1949, 103min/color, 35mm) John Wayne, Joanne Dru, John Agar, Ben Johnson, and Harry Carey Jr. Directed by John Ford. In this middle film of John Fordâs âCavalry Trilogy,â John Wayne portrays cavalry captain Nathan Brittles, who is just a few days away from retirement. However, just when he thinks heâs out, the job pulls him back in to settle disputes with the local tribes.\n\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales\n\n7:30pm Thurs 8/31.\n\n(1976, 135min/color, DCP) Clint Eastwood, Chief Dan George, and Sondra Locke. Directed by Clint Eastwood. If you mixed Gladiator with the hard-boiled Westerns synonymous with Clint Eastwood, youâd get this story of a humble Missouri farmer whose wife and son are murdered by Union militants, leading him to seek revenge by any means necessary. Along the way, he assembles a wild gang of companions, turning this quest for vengeance into an unexpected ensemble film.\n\nGiant\n\n7pm Fri 9/1\n\n(1956, 198min/color, DCP) Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean. Directed by George Stevens. A marvelous cinematic epic made to the measurements of Texasâ grandeur, this film proved to be the last of James Deanâs short career. He certainly goes out with a bang as Jett Rink, a constant thorn in the sides of Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudsonâs married ranchers. If you ever plan on making a 200-minute-long movie, take note: This is how you do it right.\n\nGone With the Wind\n\n7pm Sat 9/2.\n\n(1939, 232min/color, 35mm) Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor Fleming. We say goodbye to summer with the defining romantic epic that has become a beloved Paramount tradition. If youâve never seen it before, join us and discover why everyone else in the room sees it every year. At 6pm, Film Fan Members will be treated to a Closing Night Party with free beer/wine/popcorn and free admission to the movie!"
