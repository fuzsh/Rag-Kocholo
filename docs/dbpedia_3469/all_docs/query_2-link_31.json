        "text": "Given that this film is a musical and a Gene Kelly musical, at that, and its profusion of classic song-and-dance sequences (but, you know the one I’m thinking about), there’s a bit less information online about the creative inspiration or the thought process behind the choreography in the movie than I had expected. And what I found didn’t exactly fill me with the joy I associate with this amazing production.\n\nAt the risk of depressing everyone who loves this movie, here’s what I found out.\n\nOne of the most amazing people in this film is Debbie Reynolds, who wasn’t even a dancer—really!? But she did more than a fair imitation of one, even if “dancer” wasn’t her official job title.\n\nGene Kelly reportedly denigrated Reynolds’ abilities, right to her face. So much so, that at one point, she broke down crying during the production, but like out of a Hollywood movie, Fred Astaire caught her crying and comforted her. Possibly had a quiet word with Kelly. Who knows? In her memoirs, Reynolds later wrote, “Singin’ in the Rain and childbirth were the two hardest things I ever had to do in my life.”\n\nAccording to one source, after performing and filming the “Good Morning” sequence (no doubt, after multiple practices and takes), Reynolds’ feet were bleeding. Another article describes her having “burst blood vessels” in her feet.\n\nAnd pity poor Donald O’Connor, whose dance sequence in “Make ‘Em Laugh” scarcely gets a mention, likely because they figured that bit came under “stunts,” not “dance.” So, he’s just a mere stuntman, is he? According to sources, O’Connor spent several days in the hospital on bed rest after filming that scene. I’ll bet.\n\nThere is no credit given on IMDB for choreography in this film. But one can easily imagine that Kelly (as co-director and a very definite dancer) took a hand in creating/coaching/demanding the dance moves.\n\nThere are two sources I found particularly interesting. One is “Dancing Happiness: Lyrics & Choreography in Singin’ in the Rain (1952)”. Using a lot of ten dollar words This is an in-depth look at the different ways each element of the iconic dance number (you know the one) expresses joy and happiness in contrast to the relatively dull street with one or two dull people who can’t quite get into the spirit and the inevitable police officer, doing his dull duty or whatever. (But then Kelly smiles and saunters off, giving his unused umbrella to a rando guy, thus we have a “Save the Drowning Cat” moment.)\n\nThen, there’s this one called “Love and Music in Singin’ in the Rain”, which basically says that this movie seems like a comical (satirical?) take on the transition from silents to sound, but a deeper truth lies beneath this message. It’s about Hollywood and fakery and being unable to simply be honest.\n\nThe article examines the “You Were Meant for Me” sequence, where Don (Gene Kelly) wants to reveal his feelings to Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), but feels compelled to do so with stage fakery—lights, props, scenery, the works! A great big show! He uses a fake front in which to express his real feelings.\n\nTo go back to the “iconic scene,” Don treats the street as if it were a stage. (Is all the world a stage? But there I go, being Shakespeare …) The article notes that “Don is treating that real environment as if it were a stage.” (Um, it actually is a … stage set.) The other people he encounters “aren’t particularly pleased to be in the rain.” So … this creates a visual clash between realism and optimism.\n\nWe would like to dance in the rain. We would like to profess happiness despite any dreary or uncomfortable aspects of our lives.\n\nWe would all like to toss our proverbial umbrellas aside and simply dance in a downpour. The scenario is so fantastic, we want to be Gene Kelly. Or, at least, we relate with his desire to keep upbeat despite being drenched.\n\nSo, this either represents a ray of hope when times are bad—an almost “in your face” happiness—or denial in its most entertaining form. 🙂\n\nLet’s go with hope, something that’s actually worth celebrating. Although, admittedly, denial can have its charms.\n\nIn conclusion, no matter what, I’ll always love this movie. And I don’t need a stage to tell you that.\n\nI’m submitting this as part of the Singin’ in the Rain Blogathon: 70 Years of That Glorious Feeling! Hope you enjoyed it or learned something or, at least, didn’t hate it.\n\n* * *"
