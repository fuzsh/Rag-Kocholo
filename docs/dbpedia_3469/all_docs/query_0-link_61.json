        "text": "Best Art Collective\n\n1. SITE Santa Fe\n\nSome three years after former SITE Santa Fe Executive Director Louis Grachos returned to Santa Fe to take over the Phillips executive director position, the Railyard-adjacent contemporary arts museum has entered a new era of accessibility and quality. “We’re an artist-centric organization,” Grachos says, “and that, for me, is deeply rooted in our values and how we really come together as a team.” Upcoming exhibits feature the likes of Erika Wanenmacher, Dakota Mace (Diné), Tristan Duke and so many more.\n\n1606 Paseo de Peralta, (505) 989-1199\n\n2. Santa Fe Artists Market\n\nWhat appears to be a smattering of booths manned by artists hawking their wares is actually a close-knit nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing visual arts into the non-traditional milieu of the Railyard roadside.\n\nNorth of the Water Tower in the West Casitas @The Railyard, santafeartistsmarket.com\n\n3. Meow Wolf\n\nWith newer locations in Colorado, Texas and Nevada—plus a Los Angeles installation on the horizon—the original Santa Fe location from the ever-growing arts company still boasts big patron numbers, rotating exhibits, constant live music, art, workshops and more.\n\n1352 Rufina Circle, (505) 395-6369\n\nBest Band\n\n1. The Boomroots Collective\n\nSure, they’ve been around for 15 years, but the last two have been pivotal for the rock/reggae/funk/ska/soul/punk supergroup featuring Alberto Zalma, Mark J Ortiz, Rama Kim Furst, Alex Cusick, Rob Kaufman and Sol Bentley. The boys even picked up their first New Mexico Music Award this year in the Best Reggae Song category for “What Ya Need Them For.” “We’ve been trying to get bigger and better and play more frequently while furthering our horizons so we’re not pigeonholed as some New Mexico bar band,” Zalma says. As for how it feels knowing you’re in your hometown’s favorite group? “I mean, it’s awesome,” Zalma adds.\n\ntheboomroots.com\n\n2. Mariachi Azteca of Santa Fe\n\nAs the band says on its website, Mariachi Azteca is committed to tradicíon mexicana.” Amen, friends, and your fans have taken notice over the past 30 years. The five piece act of Eddie Hernandez, Gary J. Gonzales, Gabe Tafoya, Karmela Gonzales and Gilbert Romero is also available for just about any event you might imagine.\n\nmariachiaztecadesantafe.com\n\n3. JJ & the Hooligans\n\nThis fearsome fivesome can be seen all across town all year long, and with their proven combo of high-energy covers and originals, it’s not hard to see why. Composed of singer Jay Heneghan, keyboardist and trumpet master Tom Rheam, guitarist Pete White, bassist Juan Aniceto and drummer Ben Baur, these guys make music to dance to, full stop.\n\njjandthehooligans.com\n\nBest Bar\n\n1. Cowgirl\n\nAnyone who has ever spent a magical evening kicking back Shiners and reveling in a little karaoke can tell you precisely why the good ol’ Cowgirl tops this list—and that’s a pretty regular night over there. “It all comes down to gratitude,” owner Patrick Lambert says. “We are so grateful for the continued support after 31 years.” Find a full bar of spirits, margaritas both frozen and not, plus oodles of beers, regular specials and happy hour times alongside a seemingly never-ending cavalcade of bands, solo artists and more. Don’t forget about the patio, which is not only gorgeous, but in full swing hang-wise right now.\n\n319 S Guadalupe St., (505) 982-2565\n\n2. Boxcar\n\nThe house that Sylwia Handzel and Tate Mruz built moved from the Railyard to the Plaza-adjacent Water Street late last year, celebrated nine years in business in 2024, brought on Dominick Gonzales (aka DJ D-Monic) as its entertainment coordinator and Kerry Young is the events coordinator. One of the most popular sports bar experiences and food menus in town. Salud!\n\n133 W Water St., (505) 988-7222\n\n3. Tumbleroot Brewery & Distillery\n\nNot only does the cavernous venue host any and all genres (Old 97′s one night, brutal metal another, for example), it boasts all the house-made spirits and beers you could ever want, a stunning patio, regular food and community events and markets—all while staying family-friendly and affordable.\n\n2791 Agua Fría St., (505) 303-3808\n\nBest Dance Company\n\n1. NDI New Mexico\n\nWith respect to everyone else who made this list, was there ever any doubt who’d take top prize? Nonprofit NDI has been kicking out the, well, kicks since 1994, with roots spanning back in time even further—and that’s 30-plus years of dance history. We’re talking about hundreds of kids trained, countless shows and recitals, so many awards for excellence and, now, the crown jewel in its long list of achievements: the love of SFR’s readers.1140 Alto St., (505) 983-7646\n\n2. Aspen Santa Fe Ballet\n\nIt was a real close call when the Aspen Santa Fe Ballet almost shuttered forever during the pandemic. But after returning to live performance in 2022, ASFB is only getting better with time and age. Don’t forget about classes for the up-and-comers, cultural dance programs, touring troupes and the annual Nutcracker show at the Lensic Performing Arts Center.\n\n550 St. Michael’s Drive, (970) 925-7175\n\n3. Belisama Irish Dance & Rhythm Sol\n\nNot only has there been an Irish dance school in Santa Fe since 2006, but the company added to its repertoire in 2021 with Rhythm Sol for all the would-be young dancers out there looking to merge play and exploration with movement.\n\n1225 Parkway Drive C, (505) 795-5424\n\nBest DJ\n\n1. DJ Raashan\n\nOnce again, Raashan Ahmad tops your list of favorite local DJs, and if the way he packs ‘em in for each and every show is any indication, there’s little wonder why. With a mix of soul, funk, R&B, hip-hop and more, Ahmad’s Love & Happiness events are downright legendary at this point—and his recent night presiding over the Pride After Dark party in June filled up Tumbleroot Brewery & Distillery in a way that has never been seen before. “I’m so damn passionate about it,” Ahmad says. “Beyond the music is the community. You ask how it feels? It makes me feel all the ways.” Keep an eye out for Ahmad’s forthcoming DJ school, too.\n\n2. DJ Sin\n\nOne of the minds behind the annual Lowrider Show at the Santa Fe Place mall, an accomplished concert promoter and now one of the top three most beloved DJs in town, Sin brings the jams to get you moving and the events acumen to keep the party going.\n\n3. DJ Optamystik\n\nA versatile decksmith with the chops to phase from private events to all-night dance jamz with ease, DJ Optamystik has built the type of reputation where, if you see the name on the flier, you know the night’s about to pop off.\n\nBest Gallery\n\n1. Hecho a Mano\n\nWhat started as a small Canyon Road bastion for mostly showcasing prints from Mexico has since expanded its repertoire and become a Plaza-adjacent gallery showing the likes of Vicente Telles, Zahra Marwan, Todd Ryan White, Terran Last Gun (Piikani) and so many more. “The fact that we’re getting this kind of support from locals feels great,” owner and curator Frank Rose says. “I’m not necessarily trying to cater to anyone aside from what moves me…so not trying to be successful [and] experiencing this kind of validation is energizing and makes me want to keep going.”\n\n129 W Palace Ave., (505) 916-1341\n\n2. Blue Rain Gallery\n\nIf Blue Rain in the Railyard only showed Erin Currier, it would be enough. If it only showed Tony Abeyta (Diné), it would be enough. If Blue Rain only showed Preston Singletary (Tlingit), Allan Houser (Chiricahua Apache), Jody Naranjo (Tewa), Billy Schenck, Vivian Wang or Helen Hardin (Santa Clara Pueblo), it would be enough. Then you realize it shows all of those artists, plus countless others.\n\n544 S Guadalupe St., (505) 954-9902\n\n3. smoke the moon\n\nOne of the newest galleries on Canyon Road, smoke the moon brings a dash of youth to the storied street for galleries, plus killer exhibits in recent memory from Emma Bagley, Grady Gordon, Kate Stringer, Alyse Ronayne and other talented locals. This is, frankly, Canyon Road at its best and more than worth a visit literally anytime.\n\n616 ½ Canyon Road, smokethemoon.com\n\nBest Hotel Bar\n\n1. La Reina @El Rey Court\n\nOne only needs to visit the intimate bar at the popular Midtown boutique motor court to understand how La Reina became such a smash hit with locals. Not only will you find friendly faces like the legendary Heather McKearnan tending bar, you’ll get local beers and spirits, live music from the likes of John Francis and the Poor Clares, pop-up food events with One Trick Pony Burger, Tender Fire Pizza and others; plus pleasant and minimalist decor and, more often than not, folks who know your name like you’re Norm Peterson or something.\n\n1862 Cerrillos Road, (505) 982-1931\n\n2. La Fiesta Lounge @La Fonda on the Plaza\n\nStiff drinks, beer options and live music in one of the most historic buildings in town? You bet! Catch live tunes from folks like Bill Hearne, Jasmin Williams or, if you’re really lucky, Diné jazz master Delbert Anderson, and revel in the one of the most Santa Fe feeling spots in the city.\n\n100 E San Francisco St., (505) 982-5511\n\n3. Anasazi Bar & Lounge @Rosewood Inn of the Anasazi\n\nWith high-end tequilas, guided tastings, a massive wine list and a laid-back you-can-wear-jeans atmosphere, the Anasazi finds that all-important middle ground between luxury and accessibility. Will it be a splurge for some folks? Yes. Will it be worth it? Resounding yes.\n\n113 Washington Ave., (505) 988-3030\n\nBest Instagram Feed\n\n1. @cowgirlsantafe\n\nWhen a restaurant just about takes up a city block, we can assume it’s because there’s a lot going on there beyond the food. Oh, don’t get us wrong—the Cowgirl menu is popular for a reason—but folks want a glimpse into the whole magilla from the bar and the patio to the pool room, the live bands and the clientele. Cowgirl’s Insta feed does just that. Sticking with the gratitude theme, owner Patrick Lambert tells SFR that he’s “just so grateful to the staff for being badass.” That applies to social media workers, too.\n\n319 S Guadalupe St., (505) 982-2565\n\n2. @santafeopera Never forget that the Santa Fe Opera is regarded as one of the premiere venues in the country. And should you wish to get an inside look at SFO’s work onstage and off, its Instagram feed is a great place to start.\n\n301 Opera Drive, (505) 986-5955\n\n3. @everythinglocal_nm\n\nA curated cross-section of the places, foods, venues, natural vistas—and lots of coffee—this Instagram page easily works for both locals and out-of-towners alike by showcasing the sites, sights, tastes and cultures that make Santa Fe one of the country’s most gorgeous and popular cities.\n\nBest Late Night Hangout\n\n1. Boxcar\n\nAfter years of holding down the nighttime party angle in the Railyard, Boxcar moved closer to the Plaza and kind of got bigger and better than ever. Between new events coordinator Dominick Gonzales (aka DJ D-Monic) throwing together tons of shows across the genre spectrum, dance parties, board game nights and a menu served late, this award was always gonna go to Boxcar. Try the chicken and waffles at night. Trust us.\n\n133 W Water St., (505) 988-7222\n\n2. The Matador\n\nThe concept is simple and has worked for well over a decade at this point: stiff drinks at a fair price while punk rock blares from the speakers. No frills, no fuss, no muss.\n\n116 W San Francisco St. (downstairs)\n\n3. Evangelo’s\n\nMany a local band cites owner Nick Klonis’ long-running San Francisco Street space as one of their fave places to play, and the likes-a-drink set has plenty to choose from just so long as they don’t try to order Budweiser.\n\n200 W San Francisco St., evangeloscocktaillounge.com\n\nBest Lecture Series\n\n1. El Rancho de las Golondrinas\n\nLiving history museum? Check. Wine festival? Check. Ren Faire? Check. Totally boss lecture series year after year? Double-check. When it comes to lecture events, Santa Fe thinks El Rancho de las Golondrinas is tops. “First of all, we’re honored to be included, and there are a lot of people doing great lecture things,” Museum Director Daniel Goodman says. “I think people enjoy our lectures because we try to present fascinating historical topics that people don’t always hear about, and we do them in the incredible…St. Francis Auditorium.” Mum’s the word on future lectures, but Goodman says “we promise to do our best to bring something fun and exciting.”\n\n334 Los Pinos Road, (505) 471-2261\n\n2. Santa Fe Institute\n\nAn indie theoretical research center in our own backyard? Heck, yeah! Founded in 1984, the Santa Fe Institute tackles the big Qs in the world of complexity, be they in the physical, biological, astrobiology, cultural, technical spheres; SFI’s lectures inform and astound.\n\n1399 Hyde Park Road, (505) 984-8800\n\n3. Lannan Foundation\n\nThough the Santa Fe-based org dedicated to cultural freedom and diversity announced two years back that it plans to shutter by 2032, it still delivers on the lecture front across a variety of topics and speaking styles. You will learn something cool.\n\n313 Read St., (505) 986-8160\n\nBest Market/Festival\n\n1. Santa Fe Farmers’ Market\n\nDuring the summer, the Santa Fe Farmers’ Market adds to its year-round Railyard iteration with Del Sur—the Southside version that kicks off a little later in the afternoon. We can only assume this is part of the venerable market’s win, but it could also have something to do with the dozens of vendors, doubled-up dollars for SNAP recipients and community-forward ethos.\n\n1607 Paseo de Peralta, (505) 983-4098\n\n2. SWAIA Indian Market\n\nWhen it comes to the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts’ Santa Fe Indian Market, envision more than 1,000 artists from more than 100 tribes descending upon downtown Santa Fe with nearly any kind of art one might imagine. Indian Market is not just one of the best places to see and be seen, it continues to serve as the launching pad for generation of Indigenous creators.\n\n121 Sandoval St., (505) 983-5520\n\n3. International Folk Art Market\n\nBy the time you read this, IFAM will have celebrated its 2024 20th anniversary, and continued its presence in the Railyard after ages on Museum Hill. It also imported more than 150 artists from more than 50 countries, hosted a lecture series and kicked off its first-ever free day for patrons and art lovers.\n\n620 Cerrillos Road, (505) 992-7600\n\nBest Movie House\n\n1. Violet Crown Cinema\n\n“This is a film-loving community,” Violet Crown Cinema owner Bill Banowsky says, “and it’s like few others I’ve ever seen.” Though Banowsky sold his stake in the chain’s Texas and West Virginia locations, he maintains his foothold in Santa Fe. “I’m all in on Santa Fe,” he says. “Our goal was and is to enhance the experience of going to the movies so it’s not a dumbed-down experience—it’s also a get-out-of-the-house experience; a ‘grab a beer or glass of wine and a good meal and run into your community’ experience.”\n\n1606 Alcaldesa St., (505) 216-5678\n\n2. Center for Contemporary Arts\n\nIt’s scary to think how close we came in 2022 to losing Santa Fe’s premiere cinema for art films, foreign films, indie films and their surrounding programming like panels, discussions, etc. Now in the capable hands of Cinema Director Justin Clifford Rhody and Cinema Manager Jayson Jacobsen, the future looks bright, and the programming enticing.\n\n1050 Old Pecos Trail, (505) 982-1338\n\n3. Jean Cocteau Cinema\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock, know that Game of Thrones writer George RR Martin went and bought himself a theater, and he’s since turned it into a space for live comedy, books, podcast recordings, throwback screenings, television premieres and more. Expect a full bar experience soon, too.\n\n418 Montezuma Ave., (505) 466-5528\n\nBest Museum\n\n1. Museum of International Folk Art\n\nThe Museum Hill anchor point drops ever-rotating exhibits on anything from tattoos and Japanese ghosts to papier-mâché, miniatures, clothing and more, and Santa Fe shows up every time. “Folk art resonates with people in a lot of different ways, and one of the primary reasons is because there’s this tangible connection to artists and the issues for the communities in which artists create,” Executive Director Charlie Lockwood says when asked to account for all the love. “It can also be whimsical and fun, and it’s most powerful when it’s hitting on multiple levels.”\n\n706 Camino Lejo, (505) 476-1204\n\n2. Georgia O’Keeffe Museum\n\nIs there an artist more associated with New Mexico than O’Keeffe? Hardly. In some ways, she put us on the map, and her enduring legacy easily fills a museum, from the paintings, writings and personal library to the classes, tours and beyond.\n\n217 Johnson St., (505) 946-1000\n\n3. El Rancho de Las Golondrinas\n\nThe folks at this museum really like to live up to its “living history” descriptor through a variety of daily and weekly happenings, plus so many special events and festivals—not to mention that award-winning lecture series we mentioned earlier in this issue.\n\n334 Los Pinos Road, (505) 471-2261\n\nBest Nonprofit for the Arts\n\n1. Lensic Performing Arts Center\n\nThe Lensic continues its run of in-house shows for dance fans, classical fans, lecture-lovers, book aficionados and so on, but its expansion with the Lensic 360 outfit for the Santa Fe Bandstand and Railyard Concert Series events really ups the game. “We know everyone finds their way to the arts in a bunch of different ways, and we deeply love the connection we have to community with the Lensic 360 programs,” Executive Director Joel Aalberts says. “If the public is excited about the things we have going on and they feel at home in the Lensic and out at Lensic 360 shows, that’s what we want. It’s all about community.”\n\n211 W San Francisco St., (505) 988-1234\n\n2. Center for Contemporary Arts\n\nFor longtime Santa Feans, the CCA is where we learned to appreciate non-mainstream cinema. Now, with nonprofits like the Exodus Ensemble theater troupe and neo-chamber music outfit Chatter making homes in the space’s Tank Garage, the story continues and expands in exciting new ways.\n\n1050 Old Pecos Trail, (505) 982-1338\n\n3. Santa Fe Desert Chorale\n\nSanta Fe Desert Chorale’s mission “is to excite, engage and inspire diverse audiences with the beauty and power of great choral music,” the organization says. Its summer festival, with concerts running from mid-July to early August, is one of the nation’s largest choral events.\n\n311 E Palace Ave., (505) 988-2282\n\nBest Outdoor Venue\n\n1. Santa Fe Railyard\n\nWhen the sun sinks behind the water tower and a band, big or small, takes the stage to the throngs lured sweetly by the promise of free music, Santa Fe crackles electric in our beautiful little community space. The trains still roll on by; the breweries serve up suds; someone snags a crepe or a pizza slice or an ice cream cone; children flit about in the twilight. If the goal was to create a space for congregation, then mission accomplished.\n\nCerrillos Road and Guadalupe St., (505) 982-3373\n\n2. Santa Fe Opera\n\nThe hybrid indoor/outdoor Crosby Theater at the Santa Fe Opera is legendary among theatergoers around the world. And in addition to the world-class operas year after year, the venue also plays hosts to concerts of all stripes. Rarely does it get more beautiful than that.\n\n301 Opera Drive, (505) 986-5955\n\n3. Santa Fe Bandstand on the Plaza\n\nYou know the drill by now: Each summer heralds an ongoing cavalcade of free concerts in Santa Fe’s original agora. It doesn’t matter where your tastes land, either, because they’ll have something for everyone at one point or another.\n\n63 Lincoln Ave., lensic360.org\n\nBest Performing Arts Venue\n\n1. Lensic Performing Arts Center\n\nEven a cursory glance at the Lensic site reveals a veritable cornucopia of enticing entertainment opportunities. This is the place that hosts The Nutcracker ballet and John Waters; theater simulcasts and screenings of films like Jurassic Park and Knives Out. The building is drop-dead gorgeous, too, and just about everything comes with affordable ticket options.\n\n211 W San Francisco St., (505) 988-1234\n\n2. Santa Fe Opera\n\nAs we said in the previous write-up, SFO keeps things real all year, not just during its annual summer season. Past shows have included Robert Plant, David Byrne, Al Green, Blondie, TV on the Radio and Bon Iver—who even knows what’s next?\n\n301 Opera Drive, (505) 986-5955\n\n3. Tumbleroot Brewery & Distillery\n\nThe cavernous Midtown space that can and does host a little bit of everything has proven a godsend for midsize show fans. Wanna catch The Old 97s or Rev. Peyton’s Big Damn Band? You can! Enjoy regular metal shows, too, plus beer and spirits and pop-up food events.\n\n2791 Agua Fría St., (505) 303-3808\n\nBest Theater Group\n\n1. Santa Fe Playhouse\n\nEven though the Playhouse lays claim to being oldest continuously operating theater west of the Mississippi, the folks calling the artistic shots still have a few tricks up their collective sleeve. Take, for example, the trio of artistic directors, Antonio Miniño, Anna M Hogan and David Stallings—a novel concept, indeed. “It’s exciting and humbling and really affirms that the work we’re doing is worth it,” Miniño says of the Best of Santa Fe honor. “Theater is for everybody—one of the art forms where the audience affects the result. We’re energized!” Miniño and company will announce the 2025 Playhouse lineup later this year, too.\n\n142 E DeVargas St., (505) 988-4262\n\n2. Teatro Paraguas\n\nOne of the most community centered theaters in Santa Fe history still welcomes crowds for locally produced and written shows, special events and readings, children’s theater and more, and it does it all with a bilingual focus and emphasis on Hispanic creators.\n\n3205 Calle Marie, (505) 424-1601\n\n3. New Mexico Actors Lab\n\nFounded by consummate theater pro Robert Benedetti, New Mexico Actors Lab might have officially kicked off in 2014, but its origins stretch back to 2012. That’s well over a decade of shows from the company, plus countless others."
