        "text": "Today we are celebrating World Rain Day! We had a chat to Declan Moore, Director of WTC’s Singin’ in the Rain to find out some of his history with the show.\n\nDon’t forget, you can get 20% off tickets to Singin’ in the Rain using the code \"RAIN20\" (enter your code at chekcout only). Offer ends 11:59PM Wednesday 31 July, so hurry!\n\nTell us about your time performing as Cosmo Brown in several productions of Singin' in the Rain?\n\nTo say it was ‘the best of times’ can sound like a total cliché, but it really was! It was generally a very exciting time back home in Northern Ireland. Lots of the classic big Broadway shows were all becoming available around that time and the chance to perform in and be part of them was simply incredible.\n\nCosmo Brown was of course a gift of a part. Funny, fast-talking, frenetic and fabulous! I absolutely loved playing him! I was cast in the Irish premiere production first and then hit the double whammy with being cast in the Northern Irish premiere. What a dream come true! Both companies were a joy to be part of. It was such a special, rewarding and wonderfully demanding show. We were exhausted and exhilarated all at once! My time playing him will always be a beautiful highlight of my stage experiences. Happy times!\n\nHow has your experience playing Cosmo Brown influenced your vision for this production of Singin' in the Rain, and are there any unique elements audiences can look forward to?\n\nIt has really coloured everything for me in directing and designing this production for WTC. I keep thinking back to my experiences with it and am constantly trying to capture that same sense of fun and joy I felt. It’s an important thing to try and achieve. So many people freely commit so much of their valuable time to these productions, so they should have the best experience possible. I take that responsibility very seriously and make sure I put as much work in as I can to deliver that to the cast and crew. That effort gets paid back hugely, when the cast and crew deliver such energetic performances!\n\nThere are indeed a few unique elements in the show, where we get to put an individual stamp on our production, but I’m not going to spoil those. You have to come along and see those for yourself! All I will say is that my wonderful key production team members (Jeremy Curtin & Amy Curtin) and I have definitely put a few fresh takes on some aspects of this wonderful show.\n\nWhat are you most excited to share with our audiences?\n\nWith the sheer size of our production, many of the required elements of sets & costumes didn’t really exist out there. Whilst making and sourcing all these elements from scratch has been a challenge, it also makes WTC’s production a unique one. I’m excited to share all these new carefully designed and crafted visual elements with our audiences. From the beautiful costumes and props (headed respectively by Catherine McKinnon & Wendy Walker), through to the imaginative lighting design (Matt Lutz) and particularly the completely new and clever set design by Neil Shotter. All of these new, never before seen elements excite me a lot!\n\nWhat has been the most rewarding part of working with the cast and crew of this production so far?\n\nThe huge amount of talent on show in our 50-strong cast is just amazing! I’m a lover of ‘characters’ in any show. Not just the main listed ones, but all the other supporting ones that make up the world that we are all trying to create on stage. With the fantastic quality of all our cast I’ve been able to go into character heaven! Rather than ‘crossing over the stage’ because the director said so, it’s been so pleasing to have the calibre of players to be able to craft a stage packed with fully-realised supporting characters.\n\nIt also has to be said that WTC is a production machine that’s really second to none! This isn’t a one-horse-town organisation. Getting to work with such an experienced, organised, and hard-working company is a reward all in itself. Anyone who has had the privilege of doing so knows exactly what I mean.\n\nWhat do you hope the audience takes away from this production of Singin' in the Rain?\n\nHopefully they will come out smiling, singing…and maybe even tapping! These classic large scale musicals were designed to please and if we hit things just right, you will definitely leave the theatre with a big smile on your face. The pure joy and delight in escaping into this glamorous, funny, and innocent world for a few hours is really worth the ticket price alone. There are so many real life issues that compete for our attention nowadays, that escaping into live theatre for a few hours can completely recharge and re-energise you.\n\nAre there any particular scenes or numbers in Singin' in the Rain that you are especially excited for the audience to see?\n\nI think it’s actually less about particular scenes or songs (though there are some personal favs in there of course!). I think I'm more excited to present the whole show experience itself. So many of the contemporary shows don’t allow or require you the scope that this one does. The large cast, big orchestra, and large-scale set pieces will all be impressive in themselves. The exciting opportunity to present this musical the way it was designed to be seen has been both the real challenge and the real joy of this production.\n\nOne element I’m very excited about is putting the “rain” into Singin’ in the Rain. Team leader Jordan Vassallo and his band of ‘rain makers’ will definitely provide the audience with a highly memorable sequence within the show! Cant wait for that!\n\nThese large scale productions are understandably becoming all too rare given the expense, workload, and commitment it takes to put them on. So do yourself a solid and make sure you don’t miss this one. It could be a while before seeing as big a production as this in the community theatre field.\n\nIf you could play any other character in Singin' in the Rain, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, good question! I think it would be either of the two vocal coaches. They get to deliver such funny tongue-twisting dialogue. Having to hold back your own laughter, whilst trying your devilish best to make the other characters break down and laugh - what a perfectly fun stage opportunity!\n\nCan you share a memorable moment or funny anecdote from your time performing as Cosmo Brown?\n\nI have both a funny one, and a memorable one!\n\nBack then it was traditional for the stage crew to play practical jokes on the lead cast during the last performance. Jumping through the fake wall in ‘Make em’ Laugh’, I found myself landing on my usual padded mat, but it had been COVERED in foam bubbles! Never mind the show song ‘You Stepped out of a Dream’ - I came back onstage looking like I’d just stepped out of a bubble bath!\n\nAs for “memorable”, sliding on my knees across the front of the stage, I shattered my knee cap on the metal grill designed to catch the rainfall! We adjusted all the dances for the rest of that night, then one quick bout of keyhole surgery the next day to remove some of the shattered pieces, and I returned to business as usual for the rest of the run (with the aid of crutches and padding). Memorable indeed!"
