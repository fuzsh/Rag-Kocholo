        "text": "“I’m in love with you girl…’ ran the opening of Milli Vanilli’s first hit single, which provides the title of writer/director Simon Verhoeven’s vigorous biopic, Girl You Know It’s True. And girl, you know it’s true, the fickly pop world seemed to fall in and out of love with two guys back in the 90’s, with Tijan Njie and Elan Ben Ali looking the part playing Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan. Two young men trying to make a musical dent in Munich, Germany, they fell under the wing of musical Svengali Frank Farian (Matthias Schweighöfer), who has sold 800 million records to date, famously via Boney M, a band whose music is regularly celebrated on this blog. Milli Vanilli was a collaboration which shook the world, musically at first, but hitting even more headlines when the boy-band fell from grace after backstage in-fighting led to the revelation that the two lads in question hadn’t actually contributed a single note to their own record.\n\nSo Milli Vanilli are the butt of many jokes to this day; the ignominy turned tragic when Rob Pilatus died at just 33, and his sister Carmen is a producer here. Juke-box musicals are often vapid, drama-averse affairs, but it’s credible here that we get a sympathetic, clear-eyed view of what happened, with the kind of bad behaviour, drugs, groupies and deceits that often get airbrushed out by officially sanctioned films. We start with two elements which represent what’s best in life; potato soup and Boney-M. Svengali Frank Fairan loves them both, the band were very much his project, but he takes offence when ice-cream-loving Milli (Bella Dayne) suggests that all he wants is ‘dancing puppets’. In the era of such luminaries as Roxette and Yazz, her discoveries Rob and Fabrice suggest an opportunity, they’ve got ‘something to prove’ and Morvan wants to do more than appalling his parents by ‘dancing in the pedestrian area’ of Munich city centre. Farian operates on the business of creating illusion, and even though their debut single was kinda stolen from another band, it launches Milli Vanilli into the stratosphere. The only catch is, the boys can’t sing, or even speak in public without their thick accents giving the game away…\n\nUnlike most music biopics, Girl You Know It’s True doubles down on the drama, since Milli Vanilli’s fall from grace was legendary. With classic songwriter Diane Warren contributing their next song Blame it On The Rain, they should have been made, but Milli Vanilli’s determination to sing for themselves proved their downfall; despite their protests, they were the first artists to be allowed to lip-sync at the Grammys, and that seems to have kick-started a huge reversal in fortune. ‘We interrupt our coverage of the Iraq war to bring you an update on Milli Vanilli’ runs a well-chosen clip here, and even those who didn’t care for their music knew all about the scandal. But there’s an element to which the boys are shown to be complicit in their own downfall; fame gets to them in a bad way, they’re rude to such sainted figures as Paula Abdul, and the boys fear that they hardly deserve to be sharing a stage with such serious-minded talents as Funky Cold Media star Tone Loc.\n\n‘Don’t get sucked into all this naive-ititiy!’ is a nice line here that reflects how the youthful positivity of the band became their downfall; the harder they pushed to do what they saw as the right thing, the more they were ignored and derided, slipping into substance abuse and internecine strife. In Hollywood, this kind of quirky narrative would be rife with in-jokes and SNL cameos, but this German film, largely in English, takes a more sobering route, but one that has more substance than you might expect. The direction and performances are sharp, and we get to hear a factual inside story about what happens when fame backfires. In the autotune era, this band’s problem wouldn’t have been such an issue, but rather than leave Milli Vanilli to be an unfortunate footnote in musical history, this entertaining, sympathetic bio-pic creates genuine drama from one of the music industry’s most cautionary tales."
