        "text": "The 1991 recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, and the longest running creative partnership in theatre history, began writing and performing their own satirical comic material in a group called The Revuers, which included the late Judy Holliday. They went on to collaborate with Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins on what was the first show for all of them, On The Town. Also with Mr. Bernstein they collaborated on the score for Wonderful Town. With Jule Styne they wrote the book and lyrics for Bells Are Ringing, Do Re Mi, Subways Are For Sleeping, Peter Pan, and more. They also wrote the book for Applause, the book and lyrics for On the Twenith Century, and the lyrics for The Will Rogers Follies (with Cy Coleman) and A Doll's Life. Five of these – Applause, Hallelujah Baby, Wonderful Town, On the Twentieth Century, The Will Rogers Follies – won them six Tony Awards, and A Doll's Life, a Tony nomination.\n\nTheir many film musicals include Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon, On the Town, Bells are Ringing, It's Always Fair Weather, Good News, and The Barkleys of Broadway. Their non-musicals include Auntie Mame and What a Way To Go. Two of these films – The Band Wagon, It's Always Fair Weather – received Academy Award nominations and On The Town won the Screen Writers' Guild Award.\n\nSingin' in the Rain was recently voted one of the 10 Best American Films ever made and, by a vote of international film critics conducted by the prestigious magazine Sight and Sound, was ranked third among the 10 Best Films of All Time.\n\nAs performers, Comden and Green appeared in On the Town and later did an evening at the Golden Theatre, \"A Party With Betty Comden and Adolph Green,\" comprised of material from their own shows and movies, and from their act, The Revuers. In 1977, they did a new version of A Party to unanimous acclaim at the Morosco Theatre, and toured with it. A Party received an Obie Award when it was first performed.\n\nThey are both members of the Council of the Dramatists Guild, have been elected to the Theatre Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and have received the Mayor of New York's Certificate of Excellence.\n\nMs. Comden received the Woman of the Year Award from the Alumni Association of New York University. She appeared in the films Garbo Talks and Slaves of New York, and on the stage in the Playwrights' Horizons production of Wendy Wasserstein's Isn't It Romantic? Mr. Green appeared in the films Simon, My Favorite Year, Garbo Talks, Lily In Love, and I Want To Go Home.\n\nSome of their best-known songs include \"Just In Time,\" \"The Party's Over,\" \"Make Someone Happy,\" \"New York, New York,\" \"Neverland,\" \"It's Love,\" \"Lonely Town,\" and \"Some Other Time.\"\n\nStars they have written for in their musicals and films include Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Lauren Bacall, Rosalind Russell, Judy Holliday, Mary Martin, Phil Silvers, Carol Burnett, and Nancy Walker.\n\nGene is best known for dancing through movie musicals of the 1940s and ‘50s, especially An American in Paris (1951) and Singin’ in the Rain (1952). He got his start on Broadway in the late 1930s, first as a dancer, then as a choreographer and actor. His star turn in My Pal Joey led to a Hollywood contract, and he first appeared in 1942’s For Me and My Gal (opposite Judy Garland).\n\nOver the next decade he became a major star, thanks especially to musicals: Anchors Aweigh (1945, famous for his scene dancing with Jerry, the cartoon mouse from Tom and Jerry), Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949); and three movies he made with director Stanley Donen — On the Town (1949), Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and It’s Always Fair Weather (1955).\n\nBuoyant and athletic, Kelly became the screen’s most famous dancer since Fred Astaire. An ambitious perfectionist, who produced, choreographed, acted, and directed, Kelly won a special Oscar in 1951. Although his career after the mid-1950s fizzled and he never made much of a mark as a dramatic actor, Kelly’s place in cinema history is secure because\n\nStanley landed in the chorus of George Abbott’s My Pal Joey (1940) which made a star of Gene Kelly. Donen and Kelly became friendly and when Kelly was choreographing the Broadway show Best Foot Forward (1941), he hired Donen as his assistant. When the feature version was made, Donen was hired as a chorus boy. He and Kelly worked on choreography for Cover Girl (1944). The following year, Donen worked on Anchors Aweigh (1945) and broke new ground with the now-famous sequence wherein Kelly danced with the animated Jerry mouse (of Tom and Jerry).\n\nHe continued to act as choreographer on a variety of films in the 1940s until making his film directing debut as Kelly’s full-fledged collaborator with the energetic On the Town (1949). Along with Vincente Minnelli, Donen became the star director of MGM musicals in the 50s. Among his best works are Singin’ in the Rain (1952), considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever made; Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954); his post-MGM romantic fairy tale, Funny Face (1956); and his spirited George Abbott collaborations, The Pajama Game (1957) and Damn Yankees (1958).\n\nIn 1959 he began working in England, turning out sophisticated comedies and thrillers, such as the polished Charade (1963) and the stylish romantic drama, Two for the Road (1966). His subsequent films, however, have met with lukewarm critical response. The Little Prince (1974), complete with a Lerner and Loewe score, attempted to film the unfilmable. Lucky Lady (1975) was a nostalgic throwback to the films of the ‘30s that seemed quaint and out of place with the grittier fare embraced by mid ‘70s audiences (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Nashville). Another exercise in nostalgia, Movie Movie (1978) was a gentle send-up of ‘30s-era Hollywood staples: the Warners’ melodramas and the Technicolor movie musical. His films in the 80s - Saturn 3 (1980) and Blame It on Rio (1984) - were box office and critical disappointments.\n\nIn 1993, Donen made his stage musical directing debut with the unsuccessful adaptation of the classic dance film The Red Shoes. He briefly romanced Elizabeth Taylor in 1951 and was formerly married to dancer Jeannie Coyne, who later wed Gene Kelly. His son Joshua, from his second marriage to actress Marion Marshal, is a film producer. Donen was also formerly married to actress Yvette Mimieux.\n\nMGM is an American media company, involved primarily in the production and distribution of films and television programs. MGM was founded in 1924 when the entertainment entrepreneur Marcus Loew gained control of Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures Corporation and Louis B. Mayer Pictures. Loew combined them into a new film company with Mayer as its head of production. The newly formed Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer was intended to provide quality feature films for the Loew’s Theatres chain and was wholly owned by Loew’s Incorporated.\n\nFrom the end of the silent film era through World War II, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the most prominent motion picture studio in Hollywood, with the greatest output of all of the studios: at its height, it released an average of one feature film a week, along with many short subjects and serials. A victim of the massive restructuring of the motion picture industry during the 1950s and 1960s, it was ultimately unable to cope with the loss of its theater chain-due to the U.S. Supreme Court decision United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948) and the power shift from studio bosses to independent producers and agents.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, the company was acquired by a partnership led by Sony Corporation of America and Comcast in association with Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital, L.P.) and Providence Equity Partners. MGM Mirage, a Las Vegas-based hotel and casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MGM,” is not currently affiliated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nEstablished in 1924, MGM is tied for the fifth-oldest movie studio in history with Columbia Pictures. The studio’s motto, “Arts Gratia Arts,” is Latin meaning “Art for art’s sake.” On April 16, 2009, MGM celebrated its 85th anniversary."
