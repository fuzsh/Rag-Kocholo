        "text": "With all the rain of late, many people may be wondering if it's safe to embrace the weather and indulge in activities like playing or exercising in the rain.\n\n\"So, rain itself does not make you sick,\" says Mayo Clinic Health System family nurse practitioner Tanner Dunn in Wisconsin, United States.\n\n\"However, the effects that rain can have on your body can make you more susceptible to illness.\"\n\nWhile getting caught in the rain doesn't directly cause illness, it can lead to a decreased body temperature.\n\nThis drop in temperature can create an environment where certain bacteria thrive and can weaken your immune system, potentially leading to cold-like symptoms.\n\nAddressing concerns for individuals with immune system issues, Dunn notes that colds are caused by viruses, not by getting wet.\n\n\"If you're out in the rain for long periods, especially in very cold conditions, it might affect you.\n\n\"But running errands in the rain here and there doesn't significantly increase your risk,\" he says.\n\nFor those who need to be outside in the rain, he recommends these practical tips:\n\nDress in layers\n\nUse water-repellent outer layers and waterproof footwear to stay dry.\n\nDry off promptly\n\nAfter being in the rain, dry off thoroughly and take a warm shower to help stabilise your body temperature and prevent illness.\n\nFlood safety\n\nAvoid floodwaters, which can be contaminated and pose hidden hazards.\n\n\"With the expected heavy rainfall, avoid driving through flooded areas and ensure you're not consuming contaminated water,\" Dunn advises.\n\nDespite the potential risks, there are positive aspects to being out in the rain.\n\n\"Many people find the sound of rain very therapeutic,\" he says.\n\n\"Additionally, exercising in the rain can be beneficial.\n\n\"The rain helps keep you cooler, allowing you to work out longer and more effectively.\"\n\nALSO READ: Walking in the rain can be therapeutic and liberating\n\nWalking in the rain also has respiratory benefits.\n\nRain washes away pollutants and allergens, leaving the air cleaner and potentially improving respiratory health.\n\n\"The sound of rain can act as a natural stress reliever, promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality,\" he shares.\n\n\"The steady sound of raindrops can provide a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\" â€“ Rick Thiesse/Mayo Clinic News Network/Tribune News Service"
