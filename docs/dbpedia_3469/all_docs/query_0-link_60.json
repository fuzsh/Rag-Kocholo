        "text": "REVIEW: Speaking out in Place in Place’s ‘A Light Under the Dome’\n\nPosted on\n\n‘A breath, a heartbeat, and a prayer’\n\nWise words spoken directly from Plays in Place’s A Light Under the Dome and it was just what it took to muster speaker Angelina Grimké ’s strength and courage. Stirringly portrayed by Amanda Collins, Grimké was the first woman to stand and speak out in front of the Massachusetts State Senate to fight for what is right. What was brought to light was Grimké’s careful strategy, passion and the surrounding events that unfolded around a handful of humble yet powerful women who historically embarked together to brave their own struggles for the sake of others.\n\nUnited we stand.\n\nDirected poignantly and powerfully by Courtney O’Connor and commissioned by the National Park Service, Plays in Place presented Patrick Gabridge’s A Light Under the Dome for a limited sold out run with waiting list availability only from August 12 to 15 live and in person at the Senate Chamber of the MA State House in Boston, Massachusetts. The production was approximately one hour with no intermission. Click here for more information and for more on Plays in Place.\n\nPlays in Place has been noted for taking a significant historical moment in time and infusing it with multiple perspectives as the audience witnesses it in the place where it happened. It is the first of three plays of the Suffrage in Black and White series commissioned by the National Park Service. A Light Under the Dome examines the scope of Grimké’s significant speech and its effects on this united group of women and the turmoil surrounding them. It was not just the reenactment of the speech itself, but included the build up and the fallout surrounding this occurrence.\n\nAmanda Mujica’s colorful period costumes ranged from stripes to plaids to puffed sleeves combined with Rachel Padula-Shufelt’s well coiffed wigs to make each well adorned and inspiring individual stand out in their own distinct way. Collins as Grimké embodied a string of emotions through wringing hands, hesitation and anxiety to make the speech of her life in front of thousands back in 1838 only held up by the women who supported her.\n\nThough it was not thousands that surrounded Collins’s exiled Southerner Grimké when she made her personable, articulate and convincing speech about women’s rights which included suffrage as well as abolishing slavery like it was on that pivotal day on February 21, 1838, it was no less an immersive experience as the audience was welcomed to open seating inside the pristine and regal senate chambers while these five individuals freely roamed the room. Surrounded by the detailed crown molding and towering chandelier in the Senate chambers, Andrew Duncan Will’s rich sound design articulated the commotion in the room and the looming chaos that erupted outdoors.\n\nAmerican educator and abolitionist Susan Paul (Thomika Marie Bridwell), Anti-slavery and absolutist Maria Weston Chapman (Marge Dunn), Vice President of the Convention 1838 Anti-Slavery Women Lydia Marie Child (Bridgette Hayes), and Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society member Julia Williams (Regine Vital) surrounded repentant slave owner Grimké and all had vested interest and offered unyielding support to Grimké as their unique stories were weaved into the production.\n\nDunn, having starred as Sherlock Holmes in Greater Boston Stage Company’s Miss Holmes Returns, still masters that commanding gleam in her eye and knowing grin. Chapman was a powerful and resourceful presence in the room and one that the other individuals looked to for guidance. Each individual shared their personal lives including a particular highlight as Bridgette Hayes as Lydia Marie Child reflected that she married a man who was good with dreams but bad with money. Regine Vital as Julia Williams was in a battle of her own fighting everyday to free her sister from slavery. However, the camaraderie between these women was never so well depicted than when they marched arm in arm during the 1838’s historical day of terror.\n\nGabridge’s script unveiled the hardships and grim reality of the freed in the north and the still enslaved in the south as the fight continued to abolish slavery and segregation. These influential women fought for everything they have and still faced oppression from every side. Gabridge’s script imbues a contemporary undertone that some aspects of Boston still have not changed including and not limited to Boston’s continuously sky high rent.\n\nA Light Under the Dome was an informative and eye-opening experience while also expressing to the contemporary viewer to continue to call for change in today’s society and fight for what is right as well as a firm plea to love thy neighbor as thyself.\n\nDirected poignantly and powerfully by Courtney O’Connor and commissioned by the National Park Service, Plays in Place presented Patrick Gabridge’s A Light Under the Dome for a limited sold out run with waiting list availability only from August 12 to 15 live and in person at the Senate Chamber of the MA State House in Boston, Massachusetts. The production was approximately one hour with no intermission.

An American in Paris is an eloquent and classic tale, but its true emotional core in Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston’s adaptation lies in Gershwin’s rich lyrics and Rachel Bertone’s sweeping choreography.\n\nWith book and lyrics by legendary composers George and Ira Gershwin with Rachel Bertone’s multi-faceted direction and choreography, Reagle Music Theatre saved the best for last in its 55th summer season with An American in Paris continuing through Sunday, August 18 live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts. This gorgeous production is approximately two hours 30 minutes with a 15 minute intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nBy the end of An American in Paris’s opening musical montage as people reunite with their loved ones while war tension is still in the air during the stirring number Concerto in F, Bertone’s powerful choreography has unexpectedly brought me to tears. Ranging from delicate to lively to showy to humorous, each superb dance montage expands into a stunning progression of the production while connecting a timeless statement about our world. Dancers utilize brightly-colored parasols, hats and scarves while Bertone’s choreography flows effortlessly and lightheartedly with each scene.\n\nA love story as well as a ballet within a musical, An American in Paris is a treasure trove of some of Gershwin’s classic tunes including They Can’t Take That Away from Me, But Not for Me, I Got Rhythm, S’Wonderful and Shall We Dance. In the past, I have been disappointed in the context of how some classic numbers actually apply to a particular musical, but each one of these classic tunes are lively, joyous, stirring and absolutely memorable. Without giving much away, a particular highlight is watching the cast make some makeshift music during I Got Rhythm. It’s simple and yet absolutely extraordinary.\n\nCameron McEachern’s watercolor-inspired sets are portraits in motion highlighted by a scene where detailed gold frames become props and also get swept up in a dance. Franklin Meissner’s soft yet vibrant multi-colored lighting not only enhances each beautiful skyline but depicts silhouettes, illuminates street lights, and keep the sparkling Seine visibly flowing in the background. Floral enhancements, Parisian furniture and an integral piano are elegantly swept on and off stage in the fanciful style of the Golden Age of Musicals. From flowing dresses to glittering gowns to various looks that come right out of the film of the same name, Emerald City Theatricals once again enlivens each landscape with personality and zeal.\n\nIt was a brand new experience watching Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston’s An American in Paris having not seen a stage production or the astronomically lauded, 1951 Academy Award-winning film featuring dance dynamos Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. However, anyone who knows of Gene Kelly or Leslie Caron’s work is aware that those are big shoes to fill. Without hesitation though, Jack Mullen as former GI turned artist Jerry Mulligan and Samantha Barnes as promising dancer Lise Dassin are a wonderful pair and fill those shoes with grace, brilliant charm and proficiency.\n\nJack Mullen as Jerry possesses a bit of Tom Holland charm, glowing charisma and an easy going demeanor which eases the pressures and aspirations that Barnes as Lise often feels to become as skilled a dancer as her lauded ballet dancer mother. They have endearing and playful chemistry right from Mullen’s teasing number I’ve Got Beginner’s Luck. Mullen rises to the challenge of the sheer stamina of this role, highlighted by a mischievous jazz-inspired number called Fidgety Feet in an enchanting and rollicking chair dance.\n\nJared Troilo, a fabulous dancer in his own right, takes on the part of narrator and composer Adam who has a disability and is often observing and composing the beauty in other people’s lives. It is a meaty role and Troilo’s humble and self-effacing delivery is never more moving than in the sympathetic number, But Not For Me.\n\nWith an amazing belt and unshakable self confidence, Rebekah Rae Robles shines as Milo Davenport, a woman ahead of her time especially for the potent number Shall We Dance. Carolyn Saxon as Madame Baurel and Jean-Alfred Chavier once again make a sweet pair reuniting as Henri’s parents in this production having portrayed a pair of love interests in Reagle’s All Shook Up. It took a minute to recognize him, but Christopher Lewis as secretive, anxious yet sophisticated Frenchman Henri also starred in Reagle’s All Shook Up as the Elvis figure Chad. Lewis again proves his wonderful comic timing and soaring vocals sharing some boisterous camaraderie with Troilo and Mullen for S Wonderful as a trio of inseparable friends, performs a grand and splashy version of (I’ll Build a) Stairway to Paradise, and a lovely rendition of The Man I Love with Barnes.\n\nBoasting an amazingly talented cast, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston’s An American in Paris is elegant, meaningful, and an absolute delight! Get swept up in this beautiful musical as soon as you can.\n\nWith book and lyrics by legendary composers George and Ira Gershwin and Rachel Bertone’s multi-faceted direction and choreography, Reagle Music Theatre saved the best for last in its 55th summer season with An American in Paris continuing through Sunday, August 18 live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts. This gorgeous production is approximately two hours 30 minutes with a 15 minute intermission.

Set in England, Brandon Wong portrays sensible marketing whiz Charlie, the son of the owner of his family’s men’s shoe factory business, Price and Sons. Price and Sons has been passed down through generations, yet Charlie is not so keen on the world’s obsession with shoes or shoe manufacturing. His wise and distinguished father, memorably portrayed and boasting deep rich vocals by Peter S. Adams, wants to pass the business down to Charlie, but business isn’t what it used to be.\n\nHowever, one chance encounter leads to a Eureka moment in spades.\n\nWith conscientious direction by Zoe Bradford, upbeat musical direction by Robert McDonough and creatively choreographed by Sally Ashton Forrest, The Company Theatre steps into musical comedy Kinky Boots through Sunday, August 18 live and in person at the Company Theatre in Norwell, Massachusetts. This layered rock musical has adult themes and runs approximately two hours and 15 minutes with one intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nOriginally a 2005 British film of the same name, Kinky Boots musical made its Broadway debut in 2013. Acclaimed singer-songwriter and She’s so Unusual singer Cyndi Lauper, who has always been driven by her unique individuality as much for her distinct talent, is a perfect fit for the musical’s score and became the first solo woman to ever win a Grammy for Best Music Theatre Album for Kinky Boots.\n\nIt was a delight to hear her pop synth and rock signature sound in a portion of the songs, especially evident in Charlie’s inspired rendition of Step One and in a standout performance by hilarious Liz Mongrello as Lauren expressively singing The History of Wrong Guys. Mongrello has a charismatic, edgy and lively vibe that was a hit with the audience and it’s easy to imagine a young Lauper in that role.\n\nBrandon Wong as humble and innovative Charlie’s best scenes are immediately evident with Gilbert Dabady as Simon aka drag queen performer Lola because most of their scenes are where both characters are at their most vulnerable. Wong’s Charlie has great ideas, but not without Dabady as Lola/Simon who builds and enriches those ideas and takes the big risks over Charlie’s hesitation. Along with a humorous performance by Dan Hannafin as factory manager George, their Eureka moment and niche market for saving the shoe company is building shoes for drag queens that accommodates the weight of a man. However, it is still a mystery how they sold the shoes they already had manufactured in the former style.\n\nThough being less of a fan of the more rambunctious portions of the musical such as the sultry The Sex is in the Heel, the spirited rendition of The Most Beautiful Thing, powerful duet for Not My Father’s Son, and the touching ballad The Soul of a Man resonates in each character’s struggle for authenticity. Gilbert Dabady is a remarkable Lola/Simon who commands the room most of the time delivering strong vocals, a sharp sense of humor, and clever quips such as ‘Room full of people who feel normal by comparison.’ Flashy with distinctive taste that does not conform to gender limitations, frank and outspoken Dabady as Lola/Simon has complex confidence that hides veiled insecurity and shines the most at Lola/Simon’s most vulnerable and forthright moments.\n\nAndrew Farina as macho Don also shares some humorous and thought-provoking scenes with Dabady including a tango-infused duet for What a Woman Wants which leads to a stunning revelation. Kat Murphy O’Connor compellingly portrays bubbly yet pushy with a taste for the finer things Nicola, Charlie’s girlfriend. Sporting a classic look, O’Connor only has eyes for her future.\n\nTackling an array of themes including grief and authenticity, Kinky Boots features some catchy tunes including Raise You Up/Just Be, the acoustically rich Take What You Got, and Everybody say Yeah’s notable choreography highlighted by some fancy footwork on conveyer belts.\n\nDean Palmer Jr. livens the production’s uplifting rock vibe through multicolored, mood-setting lighting that enhances set designer Ryan Barrow’s muted British shoe factory layered in steel and brick. The rolling set does have its own share of sparkle and is structured to make room for the real stars…the boots! Joe Michienzie’s dynamic costumes range from factory casual to flashy which includes sparking gowns, tiger furs, neon, and lace. However, the glittering, wildly stated, eye popping delights are the boots themselves.\n\nWith conscientious direction by Zoe Bradford, upbeat musical direction by Robert McDonough and creatively choreographed by Sally Ashton Forrest, The Company Theatre steps into musical comedy Kinky Boots through Sunday, August 18 live and in person at the Company Theatre in Norwell, Massachusetts. This layered rock musical has adult themes and runs approximately two hours and 15 minutes with one intermission.

She chases her dreams like only a queen can.\n\nWith music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, shrewdly directed by Michael Arden with dynamic choreography by Lauren Yalango-Grant and Christopher “Cree” Grant, The world premiere of The Queen of Versailles continues its pre-Broadway run live and in person at Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts through August 25. This impeccably well-timed show grandly opened during the Paris Olympics and runs two hours and 45 minutes including one 20 minute intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nFrom its French-inspired royal opening, The Queen of Versailles is a gorgeous sight to behold and it is immediately clear that Emerson Colonial Theatre and this pre-Broadway debut are made for each other. Emerson Colonial Theatre’s architectural design is patterned after elements of Versailles and The Louvre. This elegant baroque-style venue’s meticulously-detailed gold trim, ornate murals, and glittering chandeliers superbly match Dane Laffrey’s multi-layered video and opulent scenic design including its fine crown molding, candelabras and matching gold embellishments.\n\nThe Queen of Versailles delves into the love of wealth, excess, and consumption led by a sterling performance by Kristin Chenoweth as the self-proclaimed queen herself, Jaqueline Siegel, or Jackie. Small town New Yorker Jackie has tremendous dreams as well as the determination and ingenuity to make them all come true with a degree in computer engineering. However, things do not go quite as planned, and Jackie is left to think of a new way to achieve her ‘champagne wishes and caviar dreams’ as described by host Robin Leach on the inspiring 80’s TV show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous that Jackie watched growing up with her family. Chenoweth’s sunny disposition, rich vocals and sharp comic timing tempers Jackie’s seeming shallowness with irresistible charm to make determined, resourceful, and relentless Jackie an instantly likable lead. Chenoweth’s vocals are just as dynamic and powerful as ever with the hilarious opening number, Because I Can as she embraces and embodies this complex character that prefers her diet coke in a golden chalice.\n\nThough Chenoweth as Jackie and the cast seem to be speaking to the audience, Arden’s clever direction has the audience watching the making of The Queen of Versailles documentary where Jackie and her husband, F. Murray Abraham in an impressive portrayal as David, is in the process of building the biggest house in America patterned after Versailles and located in Orlando, Florida with a budget to the tune of 75 million and a Benihana in the basement. Leading to all this is a fascinating and vastly entertaining story based on Lauren Greenfield’s documentary film of the same name and the real life stories of Jackie and David Siegel. It’s a multilayered rags-to-riches-story….and that is only the beginning.\n\nBoasting a brilliant cast, The Queen of Versailles is both socially satirical and genuinely funny while delivering a meaty and heartfelt storyline. Sparkling Chenoweth meets her match in F. Murray Abraham as wildly successful, charismatic and equally ambitious Timeshare King David. A slick and charming businessman, Abraham and Chenoweth rapidly share a likeminded rapport and some powerful scenes. Abraham and the cast humorously perform The Ballad of the Timeshare King with Laffrey’s marvelous video projections, some onstage orchestrations, and Christian Cowan’s notable western-inspired costumes. From meticulously-detailed historical to outrageously fabulous as well as from glitzy to edgy, Cowan’s colorful assortment of standout and distinctive costumes with Cookie Jordan’s embellishing wigs enliven each compelling scene.\n\nNina White delivers a memorable performance as Jackie’s introspective daughter Victoria who feels like an outsider in her own home. Jackie has a complicated relationship with Victoria who likes to be called Ricky in spite of being named after the Queen. White’s soaring vocals lift stirring numbers Pretty Always Wins and Book of Random to another level as well as a stunning moment with Chenoweth for In Little Houses. White’s lighthearted duet with Tatum Grace Hopkins as struggling Jonquil for Poor Little Lizard bring some levity to the production’s more serious topics. White and Melody Butiu as a wonderful Sophia share a sweet camaraderie. Hopkins shares the stage with Chenoweth for a phenomenal rendition of I Could Get Used to This.\n\nThe supporting cast all have fabulous comic timing with a notable performance by Pablo David Laucerica in multiple roles including a smirking King Louis and as well as Andrew Kober as an over the top pageant host and others.\n\nWith gumption, determination, courage, and ambition, Chenoweth as Jackie candidly tells the audience you must thrust yourself onto greatness. Realizing your dream and what is truly important is quite a revelation and what a thrill to embark on this musical journey to chase a dream with the Queen of Versailles herself.\n\nWith music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, shrewdly directed by Michael Arden and dynamic choreography by Lauren Yalango-Grant and Christopher Cree Grant, The world premiere of The Queen of Versailles continues its pre-Broadway run live and in person at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts through August 25.

This semi-interactive production is approximately 90 minutes with no intermission and tickets are on a pay-what-you can basis. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nIt is quite a feat having to navigate each distinctive perspective of ’46 Plays for America’s First Ladies’ in a constrained and approximate 90 minute timeframe with no intermission, so this production hits the ground running. It serves more as a crash course for each first lady starting from Martha Washington literally framed elegantly with a classic side view as buntings hang above and the American flag is occasionally projected behind her. E. Rosser’s symbolic, patriotic and muted colonial style garments stay true to each setting with some occasional surprises along the way.\n\nWith a cast of five which includes Yasmeen Duncan, Lauren Elias, Eleni Kontzamanys, Sophia Mulharram, and Katie Pickett portraying multiple roles with time saving costume changes and Samantha Mastrati’s essential props efficiently hidden in various places on the stage ranging from historical to contemporary to absurd, these hard working and talented individuals still manage to make it look easy.\n\nFrom absurdity to solemnity to comedy to tragedy including a few music numbers, each play is creative and vastly different with modern nuances and exposing the herstory and women’s societal hierarchy as time marches on. Some of the production makes assumptions and analyses the perspectives of these ladies as modern observers. Much of it is surprising and at the same time sadly not given the tumultuous state of politics throughout history.\n\n’46 Plays for America’s First Ladies’ offers a wealth of information in its limited timeframe backed up by direct quotes from these ladies stylistically displayed as each play progresses. A vast array of scenarios took place in the White House (which was first deemed The White House by a First Lady) and the title ‘First Lady’ has its own interesting back story with some stories questioning who the first lady really was at the time.\n\nThe elicit affairs, the worries, the losses, unspeakable tragedies, disasters, emotional turmoil, the hospitality, the gossip, mudslinging and slander all had its place in the lives of the Presidents and their first ladies. Some did not know that their husband ran for President, some felt invisible while some reveled in their station as ambitious First Ladies and advised their husbands without getting credit, and some stuck to their domestic duties including one first lady who invented the pink bathroom. Some changed America forever for the better, one even deemed herself the Queen of America and that just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIt is not easy to delve into politics, especially these days. This fast paced production’s bold views are at times one sided and leading while exploring serious hot button issues in innovative and variety show style ways from vaudeville to comedic sketches to puppets to a play within a play and much more. While I enjoyed some parts more than others, the style of each play changes with each president and first lady with some revelations about these first ladies that just might unite us all.\n\nResourcefully directed by Ilyse Robbins, Hub Theatre Company of Boston continues politically satirical play, 46 Plays for America’s First Ladies live and in person at Club Café in Boston, Massachusetts through Saturday, August 3. This semi-interactive production is approximately 90 minutes with no intermission and tickets are pay-what-you can.

This swiftly paced production is approximately 50 minutes with no intermission and presented as an up close and personal theatre in the round. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nMeditative, enchanting, and complex, Origami Night: a choreopoem is an intense experience unlike anything I have seen before. It delves into powerful themes such as grief, war, passion, trauma, and sheer joy in a unique manner that is constantly evolving as the production journeys through a woman’s life. At first, dancer Elenaluisa Alvarez performs an interpretive dance to Annas-Lee’s dynamic sound design and Boston-based author and poet Pamela Annas’s contemplative work narrated rhythmically by Luz Nicolás, but Alvarez has a mind of her own as does her surroundings. It is an unpredictable piece as Christopher Annas-Lee’s thunderous, alarming, tumultuous, dreamlike, soothing, and flashing multicolor lighting becomes its own character. The lighting leads the dancer which is at times funny and unique, but that will change as well. Red circle lighting where the narrator mentions red heels is a nice touch as well as the notable vibrations depicted by Annas-Lee.\n\nFueled by Graham Cole’s emotive, symbolic and at times humorous and passionate choreography, Alvarez is coy, scowls, flaunts and it is easy to imagine her skipping along a windswept aqua coast as it is to visualize her charming playfulness during a dance contest to big band rhythms. Virginia Belt’s loose and symbolic clothing helps to maintain a dreamlike atmosphere as Alvarez spins elegantly and then at once contorts in tight movements from stress and exhaustion.\n\nOrigami Night is a lot to take in and although printing the verses in the background might have been helpful, it might have also been distracting with the activity coinciding onstage. The narrator is compelling with a balanced presentation where one does not get lost in the dance over the narration. However, the captivating lighting may ensnare you in places that lead to its intriguing conclusion.\n\nAnnas-Lee Design and Graham Cole continue ‘Origami Night: a new choreopoem’ live and in person at the Plaza Blackbox Theatre at Boston Center for the Arts in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, August 4. This swiftly paced production is approximately 50 minutes with no intermission and presented as an up close and personal theatre in the round.

I love my own hoops. Whether formal or casual, they go with everything and fit in for every occasion. Produced in all patterns, colors, and sizes, Hoops are unmistakable and certainly have a way of expressing themselves.\n\nSo it is no secret that this topic is right up my alley.\n\nHosted by DJ Brandie Blaze who is also part of the cast and enthusiastically directed by Tonasia Jones, Company One continues its 25th season with Hoops by Eliana Pipes live and in person at the historical Strand Theatre in Dorchester, MA. This semi-interactive production is free with pay-what-you-want options, contains some adult language and is a dense 90 minutes with no intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nLively and pulsing rhythms greet the audience as multi-talented DJ Brandie Blaze spins tunes by local Boston artists as the production begins. This is not the kind of show where one watches and remains silent. The audience is encouraged to get up and dance, clap and show their enthusiasm as Blaze introduces this fervent cast who uniquely take the stage in their own style.\n\nPart dance party, part testimonial and reflections, and part history lesson with a mix of comedic scenarios, the cast of Hoops share personal experiences, coming of age stories, and dig in deep into the idea that a piece of jewelry can make such an impact. Whether it is to feel closer to their family through an heirloom or to build confidence for an intimidating event, each individual has an original reflection on how their hoops made a difference in their lives. Sometimes the production gives hoops a bit too much credit, but it is effective serving as a reminder that they had the courage and power to get through these challenges within themselves.\n\nThe cheerful, hoop-inspired set design by Payton Tavares with Grace Kroeger has a bit of a ‘90s feel featuring bursts of neon green, pink, yellow and blue with dripping paint decorated on blocks. The DJ Booth is stylish and cozy featuring embellished shelves, vinyl, and flowers lining the walls. Each character decked out in their own signature pair of hoops, Erica Schoenberg’s colorful, urban and summer-inspired costumes makes each individual stand out as they portray various roles.\n\nIn large and sparkling hoops, affable Brandie Blaze hypes up the audience by singing and rapping to Blaze’s original music. Sharp and upbeat choreography by Jenny Oliver keeps the show exciting as Elijah Brown, Albamarina Nahar, Tiffany Santiago, Kaili Y. Turner, Karimah Williams and Beyoncé Martinez not only break out into dance, but collaborate well together onstage sharing a spectrum of stories and anecdotes about sharing hoops, breaking hoops, status, generational wealth and their own individual journeys.\n\nFunny, upbeat, and poignant, Hoops is a meaty exploration about feeling good about oneself while taking on the weight of the world with flourish.\n\nHosted by DJ Brandie Blaze who is also part of the cast and enthusiastically directed by Tonasia Jones, Company One continues its 25th season with Hoops by Eliana Pipes live and in person at the historical Strand Theatre in Dorchester, MA.

This family-friendly, semi-interactive production is approximately two hours including a 20 minute intermission. Click here to go Behind the Scenes with the Sleepless Critic and here for more information and for tickets.\n\nIn a world likened to the Brazilian rainforest, an “OVO” which is Portuguese for ‘egg’, is carried to an insect colony by a Blue Fly called The Foreigner. Master Flipo, a jeweled beetle and master of this colony along with the community, are immediately curious about this incredible egg. Featuring performers mimicking exotic creatures including a ladybug, red spider, laced fly, crickets and many others that roam, leap, bend, contort, bounce, climb, flip and hunt this fascinating and multi-colored lit OVO, Cirque du Soleil: OVO is part sweet love story and part athletic spectacle with a good dose of absorbing comedy that is sure to enchant the whole family.\n\nWhat keeps Cirque du Soleil both amusing and enthralling throughout the production is it never lingers on the comedy or the choreography. It keeps the bright and lively pace moving while always featuring something new to explore. As a big fan of gymnastics, it’s easy to see its influence on this production. The meticulous manner in which these wild creatures move with Liz Vandal’s innovative costumes lend to the flexibility and sprightly nature of each individual and most notably in the crickets. Each controlled movement is bold and expressive as the soft sparkling glow of fireflies light up the stage while demonstrating astonishing aerial feats. Vibrant, colorful, and camouflaged insects fiercely scale lighting designer Éric Champoux’s projected and realistic surfaces above and below sea level. Tropical flowers grow and bloom onstage as part of Gringo Cardia’s vivacious set and a flourishing backdrop feature rain-soaked leaves in fine detail as a royal red queen directs her minions and a psychedelic Creatura slinks rampantly.\n\nWarm yet strict Master Flipo shares some amusing encounters with the anxious and spiky Foreigner and the charming lady bug as they express themselves much like insects do. Keeping the jokes clownish and mostly kid friendly, the trio chirps, squirms, croons and shouts in their own language while miming their engaging intentions.\n\nSound designer Jonathan Deans and composer and music director Berna Ceppas navigate the on and offstage live orchestration that varies from soothing to edgy to ambient to electrifying. A playful onstage violinist, a drummer in a green mask, the haunting and soul-stirring harmonies of the red queen, an edgy and suspenseful guitar-tinged score as well as the immersive nights sounds of unique environments all bring this immense ecosystem to life in spectacular ways.\n\nThe laced fly spins like an ornament with the extension at the top of her head. The ballerina-like movements are graceful and delicate as it floats through the air and spins like a top. However, the red spider with a pink Mohawk crawls and glides urgently to edgy and captivating rhythms.\n\nCirque de Soleil: OVO revamped their show since taking a break during the pandemic with new acts and new music. What has not changed is the remarkable spirit of this wild ecosystem that learns to thrive in the brilliance in each other’s differences which all starts with an egg.\n\nBeautifully written, directed, and choreographed by Deborah Colker, Cirque de Soleil: OVO continues live and in person at the Agganis Arena in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, July 28 before continuing at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island August 1 through 4 and then to the SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire from August 8 through 11.

Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nGoing behind the scenes at Cirque du Soleil: OVO, some intriguing facts were unveiled about how this tremendous production comes together. From the preparation to the performers which includes two Olympians to Liz Vandal’s kaleidoscopic costumes from Montreal, this unique production is brought to life in distinctive venues all over the world. The following are some amazing facts from Senior Publicist Janie Mallet of OVO:\n\nCirque du Soleil is celebrating its 40th anniversary! OVO’s cast and crew is a multi-cultural group that has been traveling around the world since 2009. A quick paced touring production, OVO has spent fifteen years on the road changing city or country every single week. The show did break during the pandemic before returning in 2022 with a revamped production featuring new acts and new music.\n\n‘Ovo’ is Portuguese for ‘egg’. The production starts when The Foreigner arrives at this new colony of insects with an egg on his back. The show explores how we interact with one another and learn to accept and celebrate our differences. There is a love story, curiosities, and a bit of a confrontation in a world likened to a Brazilian rainforest.\n\nNot only does the production travel with a full gym backstage, but with a full time coach, access to nutritionists, two performance therapists, doctors and an artistic team of 100 people with 52 performing onstage.\n\nThe artists and athletes do their own cardio, strength training, and flexibility before attending meetings and trainings for the show. The performers expend so much energy and do not follow a diet. They eat what is best for them at their own discretion, but if they want to work on a specialized thing, they have three chefs and a catering team on hand.\n\nThe production has a lot of moving parts and the size and how the trucks are packed for the tours are different, especially if they fly across the ocean. Everything is meticulously labeled and the teams need to be ready to adapt to any last minute changes.\n\nThe production has over 1000 costumes. These costumes are built for the function of each performer and there are four full time technicians on tour to take care of the costumes. All the costumes require some training in order to wear them comfortably. The clowns have larger costumes while the crickets’ costumes are light and contain a lot of stretch for performing flips and jumps. The aerial acts also have lighter costumes as they fly from one platform to the next.\n\nThe production has six washers and three dryers that travel with them all over the world. Delicate costumes and wardrobes are dried with the fans and 60 loads of laundry are completed prior to each performance.\n\nGary portrays Master Flipo, the chief of the insect colony. Alongside Canadian poles artist acrobat David, they deliver some insight into their history in the circus, their favorite insects, and anticipating OVO’s opening night in Boston. In real life, Gary is from Austria and lives in Spain.\n\nGary: When I was 12, I decided I wanted to be a clown. I told my mom and never lost this dream. I ended up in a mime and circus school and then started to work in the circus before I joined Cirque de Soleil. They said, ‘We like your stupid face’ in 1992. I moved and did a show in Las Vegas and then back to Europe and then I’ve been here almost 7 years.\n\nDavid: I started in the circus quite late at the age of 20. Usually acrobats start at a much younger age with gymnastics but at 20, I started from nothing. I saw a circus show and said that I want to do that and found out there were circus schools. I didn’t know they existed in Quebec City so I trained really hard for two years to get in because I found out that there are people all over the world who are trying to enter these professional schools. You need to already be good at something to get in and then somehow I got in. I did my three years of circus school for like 40 hours a week of training. Ever since, I’ve been in the circus and working with different circuses. I’ve been with OVO since the re-launch in 2022 with new artists and music. I’m part of the new acts.\n\nWe are very excited about the show and don’t know how the public is going to react yet, but we’re all feeling super rested because we just came back from three weeks of tour break from home. We’re very happy to be in Boston with the beautiful summer weather. We’ve met Bostonians on the street and they seem very nice.\n\nGary: Especially for us clowns it is very interesting in Boston to find out where they laugh and where they don’t laugh. We have to adjust the timing and are already having butterflies.\n\nDavid: We toured with the show everywhere in the world. Depending on the different cultures, finding out how the audience will react is always our biggest concern.\n\nGary: What I anticipate sharing with the audience the most is always taking people onstage. Sometimes I have to improvise which I love and it challenges me. Generally, the whole show is a big festival of happiness. I don’t have favorites.\n\nDavid: I am excited about my act just because in the living arts and in the circus there is always a bit of modification. It is never one stable show. It is thousands of versions of the show, even though it’s the same show for the public. For us, it has little changes and our act has new music, so we work on it frequently and make little changes in the choreography. It’s going to be fresh, new and exciting.\n\nGary: I love the jeweled beetle so I love my colors.\n\nDavid: It’s a very beautiful insect.\n\nGary: But at the same time, I love the ladybug.\n\nDavid: I really like the laced fly. The lace fly is the hair extension act and I think her costume is just brilliant and so colorful. It’s a beautiful act.\n\nGary: I like the crickets for the costumes. How they have an engineered costume where I always think, ‘How is it possible to move in that?’\n\nDavid: Shout out to the Red Queen.\n\nGary: …and the clowns and the musicians.\n\nDavid: OVO is really about inclusion. It’s about accepting our differences and celebrating the whole of the colony, even the cockroaches. They are all our friends. It’s sort of hard to choose one specific insect because they are all amazing.\n\nDavid: The show takes years to train, but for this particular show, usually the creation of a Cirque de Soleil show is a few months. Like six months maybe and because the acrobats have been thinking about the show for a year or two, the physical preparation to get to this level takes years and years of training. Then we adapt the skills we have to the specific number and choreography that we need for the show, but it’s not like I train physically for years to be an insect. I train physically to be a circus acrobat and artist and then transfer the skills in a few months.\n\nGary: It’s the same thing with us…the clowns. We are being cast for that because our profile fits in it. The clown has his own profile for performing and stupidity. So I was cast because I am stupid and smart.\n\nDavid: (laughs) Maybe that is also why I was cast.\n\nGary: (laughs) Bingo!\n\nCirque de Soleil: OVO continues live and in person at the Agganis Arena in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, July 28 before continuing in at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island August 1 through 4 and then at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire August 8 through 11.

Turn up that jukebox. It’s time for a ride down memory lane.\n\nWith exuberant direction by Arthur Gomez, tight and sweeping choreography by Larry Sousa with upbeat music direction by Mindy Cimini, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston presents All Shook Up live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through July 21. This engaging musical comedy is approximately two hours with one 15 minute intermission and not for young children. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nVibrantly charged in florescent blue and red by Frank Meissner Jr, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston brings the 50’s back to life with Janie Howland’s vintage set design of Main Street USA which includes Sylvia’s Honkey Tonk, Jim’s Service Station, Main Street Museum and appropriately Town Shoes which is a hint for those blue suede shoes. Each locale plays an integral part in roustabout Chad’s wild journey.\n\nBoasting a Bye Bye Birdie vibe with Grease energy, All Shook Up looks at a small Midwestern town’s perspective on a summer day in 1955 when Chad, portrayed distinctly by Christopher Lewis, makes an instant impact. Lewis shakes up Main Street USA for the better while unearthing a guitar-tinged bebop vibe that self righteous and plotting Mayor Matilda, depicted with sharp comedic timing by Janis Hudson in a performance reminiscent of Joan Cusack, is determined to stop. In cat eye glasses and alongside James Turner the III as suspicious Sheriff Earl, Hudson shines in the fierce and catchy number The Devil in Disguise, humorously posing and barking out orders with zeal and authority.\n\nAll Shook Up is full of deadpan jokes and clever quips with Elvis song titles and lyrics. When a townsperson points out Chad’s blue suede shoes, Chad casually warns to lay off them. Part impersonation with the vocal chops to match, Chad embodies the larger than life qualities of Elvis, but takes it one step further making the part his own exemplified in a resonating rendition of I Don’t Want to demonstrating Lewis’s own unique and dynamic range.\n\nA storm of unrequited love and love triangles taken from a mix of Shakespearean comedies, this ‘50s musical comedy infuses a lot of elements into this lively tale and it works. Christopher Lewis as Chad makes a powerful impression on everyone he meets. Gwynne Wood as Natalie is the mechanic and is looking for more excitement than this little town can hold. Wood is endearing as Natalie who is sensible, timid, and resourceful with a powerful belt for One Night with You. Wood shares some charming chemistry with Jackson Jirard as best friend Dennis who only has eyes for Natalie. Jirard also shares some amusing scenes with Lewis, Wood, and Alfred-Jean Chavier’s Jim as the voice of reason.\n\nTader Shipley as vampy blond bombshell Miss Sandra also makes her own impression with a soaring rendition of Let Yourself Go and alongside the cast for a sassy take on Teddy Bear/Hound Dog.\n\nCarolyn Saxon brings sincerity and candidness to Sylvia and shares a varying yet sweet rapport with her daughter, Lorraine, depicted by Amaris Rios and Jean-Alfred Chavier as forthright and apprehensive widow Jim. Saxon performs a stunning rendition of There’s Always Me.\n\nThe production also flips the script in more ways than one while staying faithful to the Shakespearean twists. Rebellious Lorraine and Preston Karp as dutiful Dean share exciting chemistry and their rendition of It’s Now or Never is a delight alongside Sousa’s innovative bus choreography.\n\nC’mon everybody is a classic and vintage showstopper weaving in classic dance moves as Emerald City Theatrical does it again in vintage gleaming colored costumes ranging in plaids, bowling shirts, and gorgeous fit and flair crinoline dresses.\n\nAll Shook Up is bright, catchy and a lot of fun with an inherent message within an array of beloved Elvis hits that might lighten the weight of this world for awhile.\n\nWith exuberant direction by Arthur Gomez, amazing choreography by Larry Sousa with upbeat music direction by Mindy Cimini, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston presents All Shook Up live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through July 21.
