        "text": "Training Day\n\nTraining Day is Kendrick Lamar’s second mixtape, but formally considered by himself his debut mixtape, he was 18 at the time and went under the name “K-Dot.” In this mixtape, Kendrick raps to many old-school​ beats as well as some new ones, like The Notorious B.I.G’s “Who Shot Ya” and André 3000’s “Prototype.” It also features an interview with DJ Dave, one of the primary beat producers for this tape.\n\nNo Sleep 'Til NYC\n\nNo Sleep 'Til NYC is the third mixtape by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, then known as \"K.Dot\", and Jay Rock. It was released on November 13, 2007. The mixtape contains 26 tracks and features Punch on a handful of tracks.\n\nC4\n\nC4 is the fourth mixtape by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, then known as \"K.Dot\". It was released on January 30, 2009 through Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). The mixtape contains 17 tracks and includes guest appearances from Lamar's TDE label-mates Ab-Soul, Punch, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, and BO. The mixtape was heavily inspired by fellow American rapper Lil Wayne’s 2008 critically acclaimed album, Tha Carter III (C3), being mostly composed of freestyles over instrumentals from Wayne’s album in addition to a couple of original tracks.\n\nThe Kendrick Lamar EP\n\nKendrick Lamar is an EP by American rapper Kendrick Lamar that was released as a free digital download on December 31, 2009 by Top Dawg Entertainment. It is his first project to be released under his birth name, previously releasing music under the moniker K.Dot, from 2006 to mid 2009.\n\nCollaboration with J. Cole\n\nIn late 2010, Kendrick and J. Cole decided to work on a collab project. They were able to finish a couple of songs, with a couple beats laying around waiting to be used. It's been delayed since, possibly, 2013. The idea of the album coming into fruition is still possible, but as of right now neither Cole or Kendrick are focused on it. Kendrick put his focus on \"To Pimp A Butterfly\" and J. Cole put his focus on \"2014 Forest Hills Drive\". Although they would team up again for the \"Black Friday\" tracks teasing an album, no collab was released.\n\nSection.80\n\nSection.80 is the debut studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on July 2, 2011, by Top Dawg Entertainment. Leading up to its release, Lamar previously produced various mixtapes under the moniker K.Dot. Following the 2010 release of Overly Dedicated, Lamar began working on Section.80.\n\ngood kid, m.A.A.d city\n\ngood kid, m.A.A.d city is the second studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on October 22, 2012. The album features guest appearances from Drake, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Jay Rock, Anna Wise, and MC Eiht. It is Lamar's major label debut, after his independently released first album Section.80 in 2011 and his signing to Aftermath and Interscope the following year.\n\nTu Pimp A Caterpillar [V1]\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Kendrick worked on his next album titled \"Tu Pimp A Caterpillar\" in reference to the rapper Tupac. Work was proceeding like normal until Kendrick took a trip to South Africa in February 2014 to perform. When he visited, it moved him so much to the point where he completely scrapped the songs from this project for a more ambitious project. That project would turn into \"To Pimp A Butterfly\".\n\nTo Pimp A Butterfly [V2]\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly is the third studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on March 15, 2015. The album was recorded in studios throughout the United States, with production from Sounwave, Terrace Martin, Taz \"Tisa\" Arnold, Thundercat, Rahki, LoveDragon, Flying Lotus, Pharrell Williams, Boi-1da, Knxwledge, and several other high-profile hip hop producers.\n\nDAMN.\n\nDAMN. is the fourth studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on April 14, 2017. Lamar assembled numerous artists and producers to produce the album, including executive producer and Top Dawg Entertainment label-head Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, Sounwave, DJ Dahi, Mike Will Made It, and Ricci Riera The album features guest vocals from singers Rihanna and Top Dawg singer Zacari, along with Irish rock band U2.\n\nLook Woman\n\nDuring the early stages of Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Kendrick worked on a side project titled Look Woman, uncommonly titled Look Woman, Amen!. There was a tracklist made for the project and only a bit of work was put into it before being scrapped altogether to focus on Mr. Morale. It was originally claimed to be a horror album about women before being clarified that it was actually \"the opposite\". The remaining songs were given to other artists like Beyonce and Rihanna.\n\nMr. Morale [V1]\n\nAfter Black Panther: The Album, Kendrick works on his next album with much anticipation. One of the scrapped albums during this time was \"Look Woman\", it was never finished. He planned for the album to be more personal from the very start. Things were going smoothly with a 2019 release date in mind but Kendrick was not able to finish the album by then, continuing his work into 2020. It's assumed that Kendrick would've used pgLang's YouTube channel as a way to promote his and Baby Keem's next album due to the now deleted \"Visual Mission Statement\" video.\n\nMr. Morale [V2]\n\nDespite Kendrick's own delays and worldwide COVID lockdowns, he continued to work on the album at a steady pace. By May, the original album was finished and was in the process of being mixed and mastered. However, Kendrick's team would delay finishing the rest of the album after May 5th since they agreed that COVID was going to delay future plans anyway. Kendrick worked on the original album again around August 2020 to record the \"N95\" MV, but the original sounds of the album started changing.\n\nMr. Morale [V3]\n\nMr. Morale & The Big Steppers is the fifth studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, released on May 13, 2022, by PGLang, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. The double album is Lamar's first studio album release since DAMN. (2017), his first album release under his creative collective PGLang, and his final project with TDE (under which he released four albums and was one of their flagship artists)."
