Silent films were being replaced by sound films and dancer-turned-singer (Gene Kelly) is also caught up in this complicated transition, as is his friend (Donald O’Connor), girlfriend (Debbie Reynolds), and unpleasant costar (Jean Hagen).

More than just a cult film, Singin' in the Rain is the symbol of an era—the golden age of Hollywood studios—and a pioneer of musical films. After Singin' in the Rain, a long line of musical films appeared, including in France with two classics by Jacques Demy: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Les Parapluies de Cherbourg) (Palme d’or 1964), and The Young Girls of Rochefort (Les Demoiselles de Rochefort), in which Gene Kelly plays opposite the Dorléac sisters accompanied by the melodies of Michel Legrand. More recently, French-American director Damien Chazelle revived the trend with La La Land, whose choreography is inspired by 1950s classics such as Singin' in the Rain.
