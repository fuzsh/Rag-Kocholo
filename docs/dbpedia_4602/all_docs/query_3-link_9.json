        "text": "One of Bob Hope’s biggest hits. So if you’re trying to figure out why people liked him, this is an important document.\n\nThere are some comedians who are dynamos, otherworldly beings, and/or forces of nature - your Chaplins, your Keatons, your J. Lewises and Carreys - and then there are some who are normal guys who are a bit silly - your Harold Lloyds, your Sandlers, your Bill Murrays, and yes, your Bob Hopes. (There are lots of comedians who exist somewhere between these categories - your Eddie Murphys, your Stooges Three, etc, but work with me here.) The former category, you sit in awe of their talents; the latter, you just like hanging out with them. I actually don’t particularly like hanging out with Bob Hope, but facts is facts and numbers don’t lie: a lot of people did.\n\nI’ll be honest, I found the racism here pretty hard to take.\n\nJane Russell’s portrayal of Calamity Jane substantiated that she could commercially manage to play comical roles as she is sent covertly to carry out an inquiry into who's responsible for smuggling guns to a tribe of Native Americans. Cue deliberately clumsy comedy sequences and a large number of one-liners as she marries Bob Hope’s character, a travelling dentist named ”Painless\" Potter, to maintain her undercover commitments, which in turn draws out some absurdist routines.\n\nRussell and Hope generally have some decent moments together, and this satire on the western genre directed by Norman Z. McLeod was extremely popular at the time of its release. The Oscar-winning song Buttons and Bows by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans is weaved into the spoofing extravaganza and, despite it comprising a slightly built plot, it proved to be Hope's most significant box office success and sees him working his well known faint-hearted disposition into charismatic chemistry with Jane Russell.\n\nA.K.A. I start clearing out the DVR. While I still have two thirds free on it, it would be prudent of me to start watching the movies and TV shows I've had on there since last month so it can be cleared out. This was something recorded on TCM a few weeks ago; the comedic Western was of interest because I only knew of Bob Hope for being on TV hosting special events that served as entertainment for troops stationed overseas (this was decades after The Paleface was made)... and the comely charms of Jane Russell-no relation.\n\nMs. Russell was not just a sultry dame-she could also do comedy. Her role was that of real life frontierswoman Calamity Jane; she…\n\nA lot of modest pleasures here that don't really have anything to do with Bob Hope - nice pulp western plot setup, a cool action chase scene at the end, Jane Russell being a badass. As for Bob, eh, he does his thing in characteristic fashion, starting with a weirdly macabre bit involving his job in the movie as a frontier dentist, and continuing into the usual stuff as an arrogant, cowardly, stupid boob in an old west setting. Frank Tashlin's work on the script presumably is to thank for a couple cartoonish touches, but it's my understanding that the sequel I hope to see soon goes a lot farther in that direction.\n\nJane Russell is a sexy outlaw by the name of Calamity Jane with skills to envy, especially when working out the guns. Bob Hope is a clueless, very macabre dentist who sees himself involved in some legal troubles when Jane walks into his life.\n\nMy first introduction to the iconic Bob Hope, I can see why he was beloved by many. He knows how to walk the thin line between screwball, physical and the meta humor. He spits out jokes one right after the other, a few land and others don't. Jane is very good on her role as this tough pistolera.\n\nThe script is very good, though as one may expect, it has some very outdated content. The cinematography…\n\nComedy western, a vehicle for Bob Hope who stars as inept dentist 'Painless' Peter Potter opposite a feisty Jane Russell as Calamity Jane.\n\nI used to love watching this on the telly as a kid along with the follow-up 'Son of Paleface', thought they were the funniest films ever. A grown-up re-watch reveals the humour to be pretty lame but it still raises a few titters, particularly with one running gag, and it also features the Oscar winning song 'Buttons and Bows', which is now stuck in my head.\n\nEnjoyable nostalgia if you can ignore the politically incorrect depiction (and mass killing) of Native Americans. In fact, now that I think of it, it does have an extremely high body count for a family-friendly U certificate film."
