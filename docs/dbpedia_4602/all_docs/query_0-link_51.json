        "text": "Capturing Keaton’s first steps in front of a camera, this box set charts his early association with ex-Keystone Kop Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle through to starring in, headlining, and directing his own box office smash hits. Using Chaplin’s old Hollywood studios in 1920, Keaton’s sophisticated technical inventiveness coupled with his haunted-yet-handsome ‘Stone Face’ persona, created a succession of the most timeless, classic comedy shorts ever realised. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present these films on Blu-ray from meticulous restorations.\n\nFeaturing: The Butcher Boy (1917), The Rough House (1917), His Wedding Night (1917), Oh, Doctor!
