        "text": "The Western genre is made up of a diverse group of films, ranging from dramas that take on serious societal issues to comedies that skewer stock characters and static plot points. A summer block of Western comedies begins with The Paleface, one of the highest grossing Western parodies of all time.\n\nCalamity Jane (Russell) goes undercover in hopes of discovering who is illegally selling arms to Native Americans. When her partner is killed, Jane enlists the help of a hapless dentist (Hope) who is mistaken for a heroic gunslinger.\n\nArtifacts related to the Western genre are on display in the Imagination Gallery.\n\nWhat Is a Western? is an ongoing film series that examines a variety of movies about the American West. The majority of the films are traditional Westerns set in the nineteenth century; however, nontraditional Westerns and films outside of the Western genre that provide unique insights into the region are also featured."
