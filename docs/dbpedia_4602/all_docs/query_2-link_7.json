        "text": "I don't know who you are, but\n\nthanks. I'm goin' this way.\n\nYou're comin'\n\nwith us!\n\nCalamity Jane.\n\nAll right, boys.\n\nWait outside.\n\nJane, I'm Governor Johnson. This is\n\ncommissioner of Indian affairs, Mr. Emerson...\n\nand his secretary,\n\nMr. Martin.\n\nI'll come right to the point.\n\nWe staged that jailbreak.\n\nWe wanted it to look as\n\nif your friends broke you out.\n\nWe have a job for you which\n\nrequires absolute secrecy.\n\nHow 'bout that point\n\nyou were comin' to?\n\nA group of white renegades is\n\nsmuggling guns to the Indians.\n\nWe've got to find out who they are\n\nbefore we have an Indian war on our hands.\n\nSix months ago we sent two of our best agents.\n\nTheir bodies were found horribly mutilated.\n\nWe thought we'd send a woman. A\n\nwoman who can take care of herself.\n\nLike me, for instance?\n\nYes, Jane, like you.\n\nWe need your help\n\ndesperately.\n\nWhat's the price tag\n\non this?\n\nJane, you're facing a\n\njail sentence of ten years.\n\nYou get those men for us, and we'll\n\ngive you a pardon. A full pardon.\n\nGentlemen, I'd like to go on record\n\nas saying we can't trust this, this-\n\nCriminal.\n\nI think we can.\n\nHere's proof\n\nof my confidence.\n\nWell, it's mighty nice\n\nof you. Reach!\n\nThanks for the drink,\n\nGovernor.\n\nJane, outside that window\n\nthere's no pardon.\n\nUnless you help us, the West will be\n\ngraced with the blood of white settlers.\n\nThousands olives.\n\nWomen and children.\n\nYou could stand\n\na little practice, son.\n\nI'll take a look\n\nat that pardon.\n\nKeep talkin'. You'll\n\ntake the stage tonight.\n\nAt Fort Deerfield, contact\n\na lawyer named Jim Hunter.\n\nThere's a wagon train going west. You'll\n\njoin it. Hunter will pose as your husband.\n\nAs man and wife, you'll be lost\n\nin the crowd on that wagon train.\n\nYou'll get further instructions from\n\nHunter. We're dependin' on you, Jane.\n\nI'm depending on you.\n\nAnd I wouldn't advise you\n\nto cross me up, gents.\n\nSo she finally\n\nagreed to go.\n\nShe'll be traveling as a lady,\n\nbut she's a killer.\n\nA dead shot.\n\nI found that out.\n\nWe'll get her. But get her when you're\n\nsure she can't beat you to the draw.\n\nMr. Hunter.\n\nMr. Hunter.\n\nTake a seat over there, dearie.\n\nThere'll be one ready in a minute.\n\nNow, we'll take a- if you don't\n\nmind my telling you, it's the one-\n\nPlease, no clues.\n\nYou'll spoil all the fun.\n\nPardon me.\n\nOne can detect an ailing tooth by the dull\n\nsound that comes from it when struck by a hammer.\n\nHmm, that seems logical.\n\nYeah, here we go, please.\n\nAhh.\n\nAh, that's it!\n\nThere's the little doll\n\nright there. Now, we'll jus-\n\nStand by.\n\nAfter discovering the ailing tooth, the\n\nnext thing is to drill away the decay.\n\nIt doesn't seem logical,\n\nbut I'm game.\n\nWell... now.\n\nOpen. Open wide.\n\nThis won't hurt us\n\na bit.\n\nWhere'd you go?\n\nSteady now.\n\nWide.\n\nWhere's the guy who calls\n\nhimself a painless dentist?\n\nHey, I got a tooth that's\n\nkilling me. Sit down, you're next.\n\nI'll sit down.\n\nUh, uh. Oh, that's\n\nwhat I say, you're next.\n\nThat'll be two dollars, please.\n\nNever mind the two dollars.\n\nThanks. You're welcome. Hey.\n\nHurry up!\n\nOpen wide.\n\nThat's a happy\n\nlittle dungeon.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nThere's an echo in here.\n\nWell, now-\n\nNever mind about that. When a\n\ntooth's no good, you pull it!\n\nPlease, I'm the dentist.\n\nI know what I'm doing.\n\nWhat do you know,\n\nhe's right.\n\nWell, now.\n\nAll right, open wide.\n\nOh.\n\nIt's all right.\n\nWe'll get right into\n\nthe important stuff here.\n\nReal wide now. Get something\n\n- I thought you were gonna pull it.\n\nWell, I have to dig a little\n\ntoehold for the pliers.\n\nThis won't hurt us at all.\n\nJust-\n\nPlease, no singing.\n\nGot a tonsil. I'm sorry.\n\nHmm?\n\nAh, got hair on the\n\ninside too. There you are.\n\nNothing to it at all. Starting\n\nto burn a little wood here.\n\nSteady now.\n\nWe're getting warm. There\n\nyou are. There you are.\n\nNow, if you just-\n\nWha- -\n\nWould you mind moving your tongue over a\n\nlittle? I didn't think you were that tough.\n\nLet me see here.\n\nAh, ah, ah, don't swallow\n\nit. Don't swallow it, please.\n\nThat's funny. I have one\n\njust like it. I- Oh.\n\nHungry little thing, you.\n\nI wa- -\n\nWell.\n\nSo that's what\n\nHorace Greeley meant.\n\nI'll be with you in a minute. You've got\n\njust the kind of mouth I'd like to work on.\n\nI- -\n\nListen, weasel!\n\nI came here to get\n\na tooth pulled. This one.\n\nThe one next to the gold one.\n\nSawy? I know. We'll find it.\n\nDon't worry about a thing. It's a\n\ncinch. We'll get to it sooner or later.\n\nI'm a very sensitive man.\n\nDon't hurt me. Just relax.\n\nWhat's that? It's laughing gas. That's\n\nwhy they call me Painless Potter.\n\nI use it on all my patients. Is it safe?\n\nSafest thing in the world! Would\n\nyou mind paying me now? Come on!\n\nThe one next to the gold one. Okay.\n\nIs it coming through?\n\nFeel anything?\n\nHmm? Must be a leak around here.\n\nIs it doing it to you?\n\nHuh?\n\nBye-bye.\n\nCome on, dearie.\n\nYou're next.\n\nWhat do you know,\n\nI pulled the wrong tooth.\n\nI got the one\n\nwith the nugget in it.\n\nSo you pulled\n\nthe wrong tooth.\n\nHow about that!\n\nI'm gonna give you just 15\n\nminutes to get out of town.\n\nLast town they gave me\n\n20 minutes.\n\nAnd that scooped-nose quack\n\npulled the wrong tooth.\n\nShe can't take a bath\n\nwith her guns on. Come on.\n\nWill somebody come in here\n\nand scrub my back?\n\nPut it in number four.\n\nThis is the ladies' side. Come\n\non, come on, get out of here.\n\nYou lookin'\n\nfor someone?\n\nWho did the shooting?\n\nWho are they? Never saw them before.\n\nThey must be strangers.\n\nLook out! Look out!\n\nI wonder who did\n\nthe shooting.\n\nIt's Lance! He's still alive.\n\nAnybody got any whiskey?\n\nDad's got some.\n\nYeah, here.\n\nLance.\n\nDoc, get up!\n\nGet up!\n\nSay, I must be running out of\n\ncustomers. I'm pullin' my own teeth.\n\nOh, get up, Doc, hurry!\n\nThey're shootin' upstairs! Huh?\n\nCome on and do something! Shootin'?\n\nI'll do something all right.\n\nI'm outta here. I'm goin' back east where men\n\nmay not be men but they're not corpses either.\n\nI've had enough.\n\nDon't give\n\nyour right names.\n\nWarm up, kids.\n\nWe're movin' again.\n\nFederal agent\n\njoinin'...\n\nwagon train,\n\nBuffalo Flats.\n\nGiddyap.\n\nGet me out of this.\n\nHa!\n\nHey. Wait, I've been chased by women\n\nbefore but not while I was awake.\n\nI'll take over now! Yeah, you drive\n\na while. Who wants to watch the road?\n\nI'm gonna join that wagon train.\n\nCome on! Head 'em any way you like.\n\nWhat am I sayin'? That's Indian\n\ncountry. You're not afraid of Indians?\n\nIt's not the Indians, it's their\n\nattitudes. They're hatchet happy.\n\nI'm headin' back home, Washington,\n\nD.C. I'm gonna join that wagon train.\n\nYou can't join 'em\n\nwithout a wagon.\n\nMake up your mind.\n\nAre you going with me?\n\nYou got yourself\n\na traveling companion.\n\nKeep traveling.\n\nBoy, can you kiss!\n\nSorry I had to do that, son,\n\nbut this is a big job.\n\nThere's a wagon train going\n\nwest. You'll both join it.\n\nHunter will pose\n\nas your husband.\n\nIt's not speed that we're\n\ninterested in, it's secrecy.\n\nAs man and wife, you'll be lost\n\nin the crowd on that wagon train.\n\nYou wouldn't let a girl go on\n\na wagon train alone, would you?\n\nPainless, you're just the man"
