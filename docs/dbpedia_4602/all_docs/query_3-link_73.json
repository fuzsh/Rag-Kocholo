        "text": "It was 56 years ago, but Jane Russell\n\nremembers clearly the good time she had working with wisecracking Bob Hope on\n\nthe set of \"The Paleface.\"\n\nThe classic comedy Western, scheduled\n\nfor a showing Saturday night at University of the Pacific's Pacific Theatre,\n\nelicited fond memories and laughter from Russell, 83, one of the last surviving\n\nmovie queens from the golden age of Hollywood.\n\n\"The first two pictures I made,\n\nthey made us do takes over and over,\" she said. \"When I got to work with Bob,\n\nit was like I had died and gone to heaven. Everything was one take, not 18.\n\nAnd he was such fun to work with.\"\n\nRussell recalled Hope's good nature,\n\n\"wonderful sense of humor\" and his quickness.\n\n\"Those dark eyes were just floating\n\naround the room all the time,\" Russell said. \"He never missed a trick.\"\n\nSpeaking from her home in Santa\n\nMaria, Russell reacted happily to news that Hope's name will adorn the newly\n\nrefurbished Bob Hope Fox California Theater.\n\n\"That's fabulous!\" she said. \"I\n\nhaven't heard of any other theater doing that, so this is probably the first\n\ntime he's been honored that way.\"\n\n\"The Paleface\" led Russell to team\n\nup with Hope for a sequel (\"Son of Paleface\". The two also entertained troops\n\nat military bases around the country.\n\nOnce, someone in the audience shouted\n\nout for Russell to rate \"the best kisser\" she ever worked with. She named Hope\n\nand described his technique in glowing detail.\n\nHope stood silently until Russell\n\nfinished. He then brought the house down with four, well-chosen words: \"I wasn't\n\neven trying.\"\n\nRussell broke into films as the\n\nvoluptuous gal pal of Billy the Kid in Howard Hughes' history-bending Western\n\n\"The Outlaw.\"\n\nShe described Hughes as \"a very\n\nnice guy, sweet and polite,\" but plagued by his own inexperience and ineptness.\n\nRobert Mitchum and Clark Gable were\n\namong her favorite colleagues, she said, though Gable was \"one of the biggest\n\nteasers in the world.\" He once tried to embarrass her by bringing up the name\n\nof a boyfriend at the wrong time and place.\n\n\"I made a fist and threatened to\n\npunch him in the mouth,\" she said.\n\nActive in charity work, Russell\n\nstill appears at film events. On July 23, she spoke to a sold-out house in an\n\nonstage interview at San Francisco's Castro Theater.\n\nIn the film \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\"\n\nshe aided young co-star Marilyn Monroe, whom she remembered as \"very sweet and\n\nshy,\" afraid to leave her dressing room and emotionally dependent on her acting\n\ncoach.\n\n\"She was bound and determined to\n\nbe a good actress, but she did get her feelings hurt easily. She was very vulnerable,\n\nso I acted like a big sister,\" Russell said. \"We got along just fine.\"\n\nRussell said she enjoyed her years\n\nin Hollywood when the film studios ran the show.\n\n\"I know they had a great deal more\n\nsay about what you did, but they also paid for more,\" she said. \"Today, the\n\nagents run everything. In those days, your studio was your home away from home.\n\nI liked that feeling. The stories were usually good and some of them were wonderful.\n\nAnd working with Bob Hope, Mitchum and Gable, we just all had a very, very good\n\ntime.\"\n\nTo reach reporter Howard Lachtman,\n\nphone (209 546-8269 or e-mail lachtman@recordnet.com\n\nINFOBOX:\n\nPreview\n\n'THE PALEFACE'\n\nWHEN: 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.\n\nSaturday\n\nWHERE: Pacific Theatre, University\n\nof the Pacific\n\nTICKETS: $5 adults; $3 children\n\nyounger than 12.
