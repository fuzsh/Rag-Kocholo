        "text": "Film 190 in the “1001 Films to See Before You Die” challenge is 1948’s “The Paleface”. This Norman Z. McLeod western comedy is about a dentist being married to Calamity Jane who is on the hunt to find out who is selling dynamite to The Indians. This is my first look at Bob Hope and I rather liked his style of comedy. I found myself laughing throughout the film. Mostly because of Bob’s acting or his one-liners. I wasn’t quite sure why Peter needed the dentist gimmick apart from his nickname being “Painless”. I guess the joke is that going to the dentist is always painful… or painless… I’m not sure. Also, I would have liked to have seen the laughing machine Peter uses to come to use in a bigger role. In the film, an Indian discovers the machine and starts laughing. I would have liked to see him return at the end of the film with the machine and show it off to the rest of the tribe. Everyone starts laughing and Peter and Jane escape and put an end to the bad guy’s plan to sell The Indians dynamite and rifles. Apart from those little nip-picks, this is a fun film to watch and one I would recommend. This film had a sequel, 1952’s “Son of Paleface”. Is it any good? Should I watch it? This film would be remade in 1968 starring Don Knotts called “The Shakiest Gun in the West”. Is this film good? And should I watch that as well? If you have seen this film, or the sequel, or the Don Knotts remake, then let me know what you thought of them in the comments.
